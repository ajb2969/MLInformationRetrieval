<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, and <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, a <strong><a class="uri" href="Euclidean" title="wikilink">Euclidean</a> vector</strong> (sometimes called a <strong>geometric</strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or <strong>spatial vector</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> or—as here—simply a <strong>vector</strong>) is a geometric object that has <a href="Magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> (or <a href="euclidean_norm" title="wikilink">length</a>) and <a href="Direction_(geometry)" title="wikilink">direction</a> and can be added to other vectors according to <a href="Linear_algebra" title="wikilink">vector algebra</a>.

<p>A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point <em>A</em> to the point <em>B</em>; the Latin word <em>vector</em> means "carrier".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It was first used by 18th century astronomers investigating planet rotation around the Sun.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em>. Many <a href="algebraic_operation" title="wikilink">algebraic operations</a> on <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> such as <a class="uri" href="addition" title="wikilink">addition</a>, <a class="uri" href="subtraction" title="wikilink">subtraction</a>, <a class="uri" href="multiplication" title="wikilink">multiplication</a>, and <a class="uri" href="negation" title="wikilink">negation</a> have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of <a class="uri" href="commutativity" title="wikilink">commutativity</a>, <a class="uri" href="associativity" title="wikilink">associativity</a>, and <a class="uri" href="distributivity" title="wikilink">distributivity</a>. These operations and associated laws qualify <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean</a> vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a>.</p>

<p>Vectors play an important role in <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>: <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a> and <a class="uri" href="acceleration" title="wikilink">acceleration</a> of a moving object and <a href="force" title="wikilink">forces</a> acting on it are all described by vectors. Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example, <a href="position_(vector)" title="wikilink">position</a> or <a href="displacement_(vector)" title="wikilink">displacement</a>), their magnitude and direction can be still represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the <a href="coordinate_system" title="wikilink">coordinate system</a> used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include <a href="pseudovector" title="wikilink">pseudovectors</a> and <a href="tensor" title="wikilink">tensors</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The concept of vector, as we know it today, evolved gradually over a period of more than 200 years. About a dozen people made significant contributions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Giusto_Bellavitis" title="wikilink">Giusto Bellavitis</a> abstracted the basic idea in 1835 when he established the concept of <a href="equipollence_(geometry)" title="wikilink">equipollence</a>. Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of line segments of the same length and orientation. Essentially he realized an <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a> on the pairs of points in the plane and thus erected the first space of vectors in the plane.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The term <strong>vector</strong> was introduced by <a href="William_Rowan_Hamilton" title="wikilink">William Rowan Hamilton</a> as part of his system of <a href="quaternion" title="wikilink">quaternions</a> <em>q</em> = <em>s</em> + <em>v</em> where "scalar" s ∈ ℝ and "vector" <em>v</em> ∈ ℝ<sup>3</sup>. Thus Hamilton's vectors are 3-dimensional. Like Bellavitis, Hamilton viewed vectors as representative of <a href="equivalence_class" title="wikilink">classes</a> of equipollent directed segments. As <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a> use an <a href="imaginary_unit" title="wikilink">imaginary unit</a> to complement the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a>, Hamilton considered vectors <em>v</em> to be the "imaginary part" of quaternions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The algebraically imaginary part, being geometrically constructed by a straight line, or radius vector, which has, in general, for each determined quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, may be called the vector part, or simply the vector of the quaternion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Several other mathematicians developed vector-like systems in the middle of the nineteenth century, including <a href="Augustin_Cauchy" title="wikilink">Augustin Cauchy</a>, <a href="Hermann_Grassmann" title="wikilink">Hermann Grassmann</a>, <a href="August_Möbius" title="wikilink">August Möbius</a>, <a href="Comte_de_Saint-Venant" title="wikilink">Comte de Saint-Venant</a>, and <a href="Matthew_O'Brien_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Matthew O'Brien</a>. Grassmann's 1840 work <em>Theorie der Ebbe und Flut</em> (Theory of the Ebb and Flow) was the first system of spatial analysis similar to today's system and had ideas corresponding to the cross product, scalar product and vector differentiation. Grassmann's work was largely neglected until the 1870s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Peter_Guthrie_Tait" title="wikilink">Peter Guthrie Tait</a> carried the quaternion standard after Hamilton. His 1867 <em>Elementary Treatise of Quaternions</em> included extensive treatment of the nabla or <a href="del" title="wikilink">del operator</a> ∇.</p>

<p>In 1878 <em><a href="Elements_of_Dynamic" title="wikilink">Elements of Dynamic</a></em> was published by <a href="William_Kingdon_Clifford" title="wikilink">William Kingdon Clifford</a>. Clifford simplified the quaternion study by isolating the <a href="dot_product" title="wikilink">dot product</a> and <a href="cross_product" title="wikilink">cross product</a> of two vectors from the complete quaternion product. This approach made vector calculations available to engineers and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the fourth.</p>

<p><a href="Josiah_Willard_Gibbs" title="wikilink">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a>, who was exposed to quaternions through <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a>'s <em>Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</em>, separated off their vector part for independent treatment. The first half of Gibbs's <em>Elements of Vector Analysis</em>, published in 1881, presents what is essentially the modern system of vector analysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1901 <a href="Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson" title="wikilink">Edwin Bidwell Wilson</a> published <em><a href="Vector_Analysis" title="wikilink">Vector Analysis</a></em>, adapted from Gibb's lectures, which banished any mention of quaternions in the development of vector calculus.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> and <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, a vector is typically regarded as a geometric entity characterized by a <a href="magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> and a direction. It is formally defined as a directed <a href="line_segment" title="wikilink">line segment</a>, or arrow, in a <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In <a href="pure_mathematics" title="wikilink">pure mathematics</a>, a vector is defined more generally as any element of a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a>. In this context, vectors are abstract entities which may or may not be characterized by a magnitude and a direction. This generalized definition implies that the above-mentioned geometric entities are a special kind of vectors, as they are elements of a special kind of vector space called <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a>.</p>

<p>This article is about vectors strictly defined as arrows in Euclidean space. When it becomes necessary to distinguish these special vectors from vectors as defined in pure mathematics, they are sometimes referred to as <strong>geometric</strong>, <strong>spatial</strong>, or <strong>Euclidean</strong> vectors.</p>

<p>Being an arrow, a Euclidean vector possesses a definite <em>initial point</em> and <em>terminal point</em>. A vector with fixed initial and terminal point is called a <strong>bound vector</strong>. When only the magnitude and direction of the vector matter, then the particular initial point is of no importance, and the vector is called a <strong>free vector</strong>. Thus two arrows

 in space represent the same free vector if they have the same magnitude and direction: that is, they are equivalent if the quadrilateral <em>ABB′A′</em> is a <a class="uri" href="parallelogram" title="wikilink">parallelogram</a>. If the Euclidean space is equipped with a choice of <a href="origin_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">origin</a>, then a free vector is equivalent to the bound vector of the same magnitude and direction whose initial point is the origin.</p>

<p>The term <em>vector</em> also has generalizations to higher dimensions and to more formal approaches with much wider applications.</p>
<h3 id="examples-in-one-dimension">Examples in one dimension</h3>

<p>Since the physicist's concept of <a href="force_(physics)" title="wikilink">force</a> has a direction and a magnitude, it may be seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force <em>F</em> of 15 <a href="Newton_(unit)" title="wikilink">newtons</a>. If the positive <a href="axis_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">axis</a> is also directed rightward, then <em>F</em> is represented by the vector 15 N, and if positive points leftward, then the vector for <em>F</em> is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement Δ<em>s</em> of 4 <a href="meter_(unit)" title="wikilink">meters</a> to the right would be 4 m or −4 m, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.</p>
<h3 id="in-physics-and-engineering">In physics and engineering</h3>

<p>Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a>, the magnitude of which is <a class="uri" href="speed" title="wikilink">speed</a>. For example, the velocity <em>5 meters per second upward</em> could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive <em>y</em> axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a>, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, <a href="displacement_(vector)" title="wikilink">displacement</a>, <a href="linear_acceleration" title="wikilink">linear acceleration</a>, <a href="angular_acceleration" title="wikilink">angular acceleration</a>, <a href="linear_momentum" title="wikilink">linear momentum</a>, and <a href="angular_momentum" title="wikilink">angular momentum</a>. Other physical vectors, such as the <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric</a> and <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a>, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a <a href="vector_field" title="wikilink">vector field</a>. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: Angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.</p>
<h3 id="in-cartesian-space">In Cartesian space</h3>

<p>In the <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">Cartesian coordinate system</a>, a vector can be represented by identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point. For instance, the points <em>A</em> = (1,0,0) and <em>B</em> = (0,1,0) in space determine the free vector

 pointing from the point <em>x</em>=1 on the <em>x</em>-axis to the point <em>y</em>=1 on the <em>y</em>-axis.</p>

<p>Typically in Cartesian coordinates, one considers primarily bound vectors. A bound vector is determined by the coordinates of the terminal point, its initial point always having the coordinates of the origin <em>O</em> = (0,0,0). Thus the bound vector represented by (1,0,0) is a vector of unit length pointing from the origin along the positive <em>x</em>-axis.</p>

<p>The coordinate representation of vectors allows the algebraic features of vectors to be expressed in a convenient numerical fashion. For example, the sum of the vectors (1,2,3) and (−2,0,4) is the vector</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>(1, 2, 3) + (−2, 0, 4) = (1 − 2, 2 + 0, 3 + 4) = (−1, 2, 7).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="euclidean-and-affine-vectors">Euclidean and affine vectors</h3>

<p>In the geometrical and physical settings, sometimes it is possible to associate, in a natural way, a <em>length</em> or magnitude and a direction to vectors. In turn, the notion of direction is strictly associated with the notion of an <em>angle</em> between two vectors. When the length of vectors is defined, it is possible to also define a <a href="dot_product" title="wikilink">dot product</a> — a scalar-valued product of two vectors — which gives a convenient algebraic characterization of both length (the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself) and angle (a function of the dot product between any two non-zero vectors). In three dimensions, it is further possible to define a <a href="cross_product" title="wikilink">cross product</a> which supplies an algebraic characterization of the <a class="uri" href="area" title="wikilink">area</a> and <a href="orientation_(geometry)" title="wikilink">orientation</a> in space of the <a class="uri" href="parallelogram" title="wikilink">parallelogram</a> defined by two vectors (used as sides of the parallelogram).</p>

<p>However, it is not always possible or desirable to define the length of a vector in a natural way. This more general type of spatial vector is the subject of <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector spaces</a> (for bound vectors) and <a href="affine_space" title="wikilink">affine spaces</a> (for free vectors). An important example is <a href="Minkowski_space" title="wikilink">Minkowski space</a> that is important to our understanding of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, where there is a generalization of length that permits non-zero vectors to have zero length. Other physical examples come from <a class="uri" href="thermodynamics" title="wikilink">thermodynamics</a>, where many of the quantities of interest can be considered vectors in a space with no notion of length or angle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h3>

<p>In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a <a class="uri" href="tuple" title="wikilink">tuple</a> of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients for a set of <a href="basis_vector" title="wikilink">basis vectors</a>. When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called <em>covariant</em> or <em>contravariant</em> depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are "regular vectors" with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as <a class="uri" href="gradient" title="wikilink">gradient</a>. If you change units (a special case of a change of basis) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1 m becomes 1000 mm–a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1 <a href="Kelvin" title="wikilink">K</a>/m becomes 0.001 K/mm–a covariant change in value. See <a href="covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors" title="wikilink">covariance and contravariance of vectors</a>. <a href="Tensor" title="wikilink">Tensors</a> are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of <a class="uri" href="tensor" title="wikilink">tensor</a>.</p>

<p>In pure <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a vector is any element of a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> over some <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> and is often represented as a <a href="coordinate_vector" title="wikilink">coordinate vector</a>. The vectors described in this article are a very special case of this general definition because they are contravariant with respect to the ambient space. Contravariance captures the physical intuition behind the idea that a vector has "magnitude and direction".</p>

<p>Vectors are usually shown in graphs or other diagrams as arrows (directed <a href="line_segment" title="wikilink">line segments</a>), as illustrated in the figure. Here the point <em>A</em> is called the <em>origin</em>, <em>tail</em>, <em>base</em>, or <em>initial point</em>; point <em>B</em> is called the <em>head</em>, <em>tip</em>, <em>endpoint</em>, <em>terminal point</em> or <em>final point</em>. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's <a href="magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a>, while the direction in which the arrow points indicates the vector's direction.</p>

<p> On a two-dimensional diagram, sometimes a vector <a class="uri" href="perpendicular" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a> to the <a href="plane_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">plane</a> of the diagram is desired. These vectors are commonly shown as small circles. A circle with a dot at its centre (Unicode U+2299 ⊙) indicates a vector pointing out of the front of the diagram, toward the viewer. A circle with a cross inscribed in it (Unicode U+2297 ⊗) indicates a vector pointing into and behind the diagram. These can be thought of as viewing the tip of an <a href="arrow_(weapon)" title="wikilink">arrow</a> head on and viewing the flights of an arrow from the back.</p>

<p>  In order to calculate with vectors, the graphical representation may be too cumbersome. Vectors in an <em>n</em>-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as <a href="coordinate_vector" title="wikilink">coordinate vectors</a> in a <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">Cartesian coordinate system</a>. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of <em>n</em> real numbers (<em>n</em>-<a class="uri" href="tuple" title="wikilink">tuple</a>). These numbers are the <a href="Cartesian_coordinate" title="wikilink">coordinates</a> of the endpoint of the vector, with respect to a given <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">Cartesian coordinate system</a>, and are typically called the <strong><a href="scalar_component" title="wikilink">scalar components</a></strong> (or <strong>scalar projections</strong>) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.</p>

<p>As an example in two dimensions (see figure), the vector from the origin <em>O</em> = (0,0) to the point <em>A</em> = (2,3) is simply written as</p>

<h3 id="decomposition">Decomposition</h3>

<p>As explained <a href="Euclidean_vector#Representations" title="wikilink">above</a> a vector is often described by a set of vector components that <a href="#Addition_and_subtraction" title="wikilink">add up</a> to form the given vector. Typically, these components are the <a href="Vector_projection" title="wikilink">projections</a> of the vector on a set of mutually perpendicular reference axes (basis vectors). The vector is said to be <em>decomposed</em> or <em>resolved with respect to</em> that set.</p>

<p>However, the decomposition of a vector into components is not unique, because it depends on the choice of the axes on which the vector is projected.</p>

). The latter two choices are more convenient for solving problems which possess cylindrical or spherical symmetry respectively.</p>

<p>The choice of a basis doesn't affect the properties of a vector or its behaviour under transformations.</p>

<p>A vector can be also decomposed with respect to "non-fixed" basis vectors that change their <a href="orientation_(geometry)" title="wikilink">orientation</a> as a function of time or space. For example, a vector in three-dimensional space can be decomposed with respect to two axes, respectively <em>normal</em>, and <em>tangent</em> to a surface (see figure). Moreover, the <em>radial</em> and <em><a href="tangential_component" title="wikilink">tangential components</a></em> of a vector relate to the <em><a class="uri" href="radius" title="wikilink">radius</a> of <a class="uri" href="rotation" title="wikilink">rotation</a></em> of an object. The former is <a href="Parallel_(geometry)" title="wikilink">parallel</a> to the radius and the latter is <a href="Perpendicular" title="wikilink">orthogonal</a> to it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>In these cases, each of the components may be in turn decomposed with respect to a fixed coordinate system or basis set (e.g., a <em>global</em> coordinate system, or <a href="inertial_reference_frame" title="wikilink">inertial reference frame</a>).</p>

<p>The addition may be represented graphically by placing the tail of the arrow <strong>b</strong> at the head of the arrow <strong>a</strong>, and then drawing an arrow from the tail of <strong>a</strong> to the head of <strong>b</strong>.

<figcaption>The addition of two vectors <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong></figcaption>

<p>This addition method is sometimes called the <em>parallelogram rule</em> because <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> form the sides of a <a class="uri" href="parallelogram" title="wikilink">parallelogram</a> and <strong>a</strong> + <strong>b</strong> is one of the diagonals. If <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are bound vectors that have the same base point, this point will also be the base point of <strong>a</strong> + <strong>b</strong>. One can check geometrically that <strong>a</strong> + <strong>b</strong> = <strong>b</strong> + <strong>a</strong> and (<strong>a</strong> + <strong>b</strong>) + <strong>c</strong> = <strong>a</strong> + (<strong>b</strong> + <strong>c</strong>).</p>

<p>Subtraction of two vectors can be geometrically defined as follows: to subtract <strong>b</strong> from <strong>a</strong>, place the tails of <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> at the same point, and then draw an arrow from the head of <strong>b</strong> to the head of <strong>a</strong>. This new arrow represents the vector <strong>a</strong> − <strong>b</strong>, as illustrated below:</p>

<p>Intuitively, multiplying by a scalar <em>r</em> stretches a vector out by a factor of <em>r</em>. Geometrically, this can be visualized (at least in the case when <em>r</em> is an integer) as placing <em>r</em> copies of the vector in a line where the endpoint of one vector is the initial point of the next vector.</p>

<p>If <em>r</em> is negative, then the vector changes direction: it flips around by an angle of 180°. Two examples (<em>r</em> = −1 and <em>r</em> = 2) are given below:</p>

<p>Scalar multiplication is <a href="Distributivity" title="wikilink">distributive</a> over vector addition in the following sense: <em>r</em>(<strong>a</strong> + <strong>b</strong>) = <em>r<strong><em>a</em>' + ''r</strong></em>b''' for all vectors <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> and all scalars <em>r</em>. One can also show that <strong>a</strong> − <strong>b</strong> = <strong>a</strong> + (−1)<strong>b</strong>.</p>

<p>A <em>unit vector</em> is any vector with a length of one; normally unit vectors are used simply to indicate direction. A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create a unit vector. This is known as <em>normalizing</em> a vector. A unit vector is often indicated with a hat as in <strong>â</strong>.</p>

<p>To normalize a vector <strong>a</strong> = [<em>a</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>a</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>a</em><sub>3</sub>], scale the vector by the reciprocal of its length ||<strong>a</strong>||. That is:</p>

<h3 id="scalar-triple-product">Scalar triple product</h3>

<p>The <em>scalar triple product</em> (also called the <em>box product</em> or <em>mixed triple product</em>) is not really a new operator, but a way of applying the other two multiplication operators to three vectors. The scalar triple product is sometimes denoted by (<strong>a</strong> <strong>b</strong> <strong>c</strong>) and defined as:</p>

<p>It has three primary uses. First, the absolute value of the box product is the volume of the <a class="uri" href="parallelepiped" title="wikilink">parallelepiped</a> which has edges that are defined by the three vectors. Second, the scalar triple product is zero if and only if the three vectors are <a href="linear_independence" title="wikilink">linearly dependent</a>, which can be easily proved by considering that in order for the three vectors to not make a volume, they must all lie in the same plane. Third, the box product is positive if and only if the three vectors <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong> and <strong>c</strong> are right-handed.</p>

<p>In components (<em>with respect to a right-handed orthonormal basis</em>), if the three vectors are thought of as rows (or columns, but in the same order), the scalar triple product is simply the <a class="uri" href="determinant" title="wikilink">determinant</a> of the 3-by-3 <a href="Matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrix</a> having the three vectors as rows</p>

<p>where <strong>n</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>n</strong><sub>2</sub>, <strong>n</strong><sub>3</sub> form another orthonormal basis not aligned with <strong>e</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>e</strong><sub>2</sub>, <strong>e</strong><sub>3</sub>. The values of <em>u</em>, <em>v</em>, and <em>w</em> are such that the resulting vector sum is exactly <strong>a</strong>.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to encounter vectors known in terms of different bases (for example, one basis fixed to the Earth and a second basis fixed to a moving vehicle). In order to perform many of the operations defined above, it is necessary to know the vectors in terms of the same basis. One simple way to express a vector known in one basis in terms of another uses column matrices that represent the vector in each basis along with a third matrix containing the information that relates the two bases. For example, in order to find the values of <em>u</em>, <em>v</em>, and <em>w</em> that define <strong>a</strong> in the <strong>n</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>n</strong><sub>2</sub>, <strong>n</strong><sub>3</sub> basis, a matrix multiplication may be employed in the form</p>

<p>where each matrix element <em>c</em><sub><em>jk</em></sub> is the <a href="Direction_cosine#Cartesian_coordinates" title="wikilink">direction cosine</a> relating <strong>n</strong><sub><em>j</em></sub> to <strong>e</strong><sub><em>k</em></sub>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The term <em>direction cosine</em> refers to the <a class="uri" href="cosine" title="wikilink">cosine</a> of the angle between two unit vectors, which is also equal to their <a href="#Dot_product" title="wikilink">dot product</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>By referring collectively to <strong>e</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>e</strong><sub>2</sub>, <strong>e</strong><sub>3</sub> as the <em>e</em> basis and to <strong>n</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>n</strong><sub>2</sub>, <strong>n</strong><sub>3</sub> as the <em>n</em> basis, the matrix containing all the <em>c</em><sub><em>jk</em></sub> is known as the "<strong><a href="transformation_matrix" title="wikilink">transformation matrix</a></strong> from <em>e</em> to <em>n</em>", or the "<strong><a href="rotation_matrix" title="wikilink">rotation matrix</a></strong> from <em>e</em> to <em>n</em>" (because it can be imagined as the "rotation" of a vector from one basis to another), or the "<strong>direction cosine matrix</strong> from <em>e</em> to <em>n</em>"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> (because it contains direction cosines).</p>

<p>The properties of a <a href="rotation_matrix" title="wikilink">rotation matrix</a> are such that its <a href="matrix_inverse" title="wikilink">inverse</a> is equal to its <a href="matrix_transpose" title="wikilink">transpose</a>. This means that the "rotation matrix from <em>e</em> to <em>n</em>" is the transpose of "rotation matrix from <em>n</em> to <em>e</em>".</p>

<p>By applying several matrix multiplications in succession, any vector can be expressed in any basis so long as the set of direction cosines is known relating the successive bases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a href="seven-dimensional_cross_product" title="wikilink">seven-dimensional cross product</a> is similar to the cross product in that its result is a vector orthogonal to the two arguments; there is however no natural way of selecting one of the possible such products.</p>
<h2 id="physics">Physics</h2>

<p>Vectors have many uses in physics and other sciences.</p>
<h3 id="length-and-units">Length and units</h3>

<p>In abstract vector spaces, the length of the arrow depends on a <a href="Dimensionless_number" title="wikilink">dimensionless</a> <a href="Scale_(measurement)" title="wikilink">scale</a>. If it represents, for example, a force, the "scale" is of <a href="Dimensional_analysis" title="wikilink">physical dimension</a> length/force. Thus there is typically consistency in scale among quantities of the same dimension, but otherwise scale ratios may vary; for example, if "1 newton" and "5 m" are both represented with an arrow of 2 cm, the scales are 1:250 and 1 m:50 N respectively. Equal length of vectors of different dimension has no particular significance unless there is some <a href="proportionality_constant" title="wikilink">proportionality constant</a> inherent in the system that the diagram represents. Also length of a unit vector (of dimension length, not length/force, etc.) has no coordinate-system-invariant significance.</p>
<h3 id="vector-valued-functions">Vector-valued functions</h3>

<p>Often in areas of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time parameter <em>t</em>. For instance, if <strong>r</strong> represents the position vector of a particle, then <strong>r</strong>(<em>t</em>) gives a <a href="parametric_equation" title="wikilink">parametric</a> representation of the trajectory of the particle. Vector-valued functions can be <a href="derivative" title="wikilink">differentiated</a> and <a href="integral" title="wikilink">integrated</a> by differentiating or integrating the components of the vector, and many of the familiar rules from <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a> continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.</p>
<h3 id="position-velocity-and-acceleration">Position, velocity and acceleration</h3>

<p>The position of a point <strong>x</strong> = (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>) in three-dimensional space can be represented as a <a href="position_vector" title="wikilink">position vector</a> whose base point is the origin</p>

<h2 id="vectors-pseudovectors-and-transformations">Vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations</h2>

<p>An alternative characterization of Euclidean vectors, especially in physics, describes them as lists of quantities which behave in a certain way under a <a href="coordinate_system" title="wikilink">coordinate transformation</a>. A <em>contravariant vector</em> is required to have components that "transform opposite to the basis" under changes of <a href="Basis_(linear_algebra)" title="wikilink">basis</a>. The vector itself does not change when the basis is transformed; instead, the components of the vector make a change that cancels the change in the basis. In other words, if the reference axes (and the basis derived from it) were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in the opposite way to generate the same final vector. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector would reduce in an exactly compensating way. Mathematically, if the basis undergoes a transformation described by an <a href="invertible_matrix" title="wikilink">invertible matrix</a> <em>M</em>, so that a coordinate vector <strong>x</strong> is transformed to , then a contravariant vector <strong>v</strong> must be similarly transformed via . This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities. For example, if <em>v</em> consists of the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>-components of <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a>, then <em>v</em> is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector</a>, but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height. Examples of contravariant vectors include <a href="displacement_(vector)" title="wikilink">displacement</a>, <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a>, <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a>, <a class="uri" href="momentum" title="wikilink">momentum</a>, <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a>, and <a class="uri" href="acceleration" title="wikilink">acceleration</a>.</p>

<p>In the language of <a href="differential_geometry" title="wikilink">differential geometry</a>, the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a <em>contravariant vector</em> to be a <a class="uri" href="tensor" title="wikilink">tensor</a> of <a href="Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors" title="wikilink">contravariant</a> rank one. Alternatively, a contravariant vector is defined to be a <a href="tangent_space" title="wikilink">tangent vector</a>, and the rules for transforming a contravariant vector follow from the <a href="chain_rule" title="wikilink">chain rule</a>.</p>

<p>Some vectors transform like contravariant vectors, except that when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip <em>and</em> gain a minus sign. A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the <em><a href="orientation_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">orientation</a></em> of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a <em><a class="uri" href="pseudovector" title="wikilink">pseudovector</a></em> or an <em>axial vector</em>. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called <em>true vectors</em> or <em>polar vectors</em> to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the <a href="cross_product" title="wikilink">cross product</a> of two ordinary vectors.</p>

<p>One example of a pseudovector is <a href="angular_velocity" title="wikilink">angular velocity</a>. Driving in a <a class="uri" href="car" title="wikilink">car</a>, and looking forward, each of the <a href="wheel" title="wikilink">wheels</a> has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the <em>reflection</em> of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the <em>actual</em> angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the minus sign. Other examples of pseudovectors include <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a>, <a class="uri" href="torque" title="wikilink">torque</a>, or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.</p>

<p>This distinction between vectors and pseudovectors is often ignored, but it becomes important in studying <a class="uri" href="symmetry" title="wikilink">symmetry</a> properties. See <a href="parity_(physics)" title="wikilink">parity (physics)</a>.</p>
