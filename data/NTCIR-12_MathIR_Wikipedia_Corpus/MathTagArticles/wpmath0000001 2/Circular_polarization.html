<h1>Circular polarization</h1>
<hr/>

<p> In <a class="uri" href="electrodynamics" title="wikilink">electrodynamics</a>, <strong>circular polarization</strong> of an <a href="electromagnetic_wave" title="wikilink">electromagnetic wave</a> is a <a href="Polarization_(waves)" title="wikilink">polarization</a> in which the electric field of the passing wave does not change strength but only changes direction in a rotary manner.</p>

<p>In electrodynamics the strength and direction of an <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> is defined by what is called an <a href="electric_field_vector" title="wikilink">electric field vector</a>. In the case of a circularly polarized wave, as seen in the accompanying animation, the tip of the electric field <a href="Euclidean_vector" title="wikilink">vector</a>, at a given point in space, describes a circle as time progresses. If the wave is frozen in time, the electric field vector of the wave describes a helix along the direction of propagation.</p>

<p>Circular polarization is a <a href="limiting_case_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">limiting case</a> of the more general condition of <a href="elliptical_polarization" title="wikilink">elliptical polarization</a>. The other <a href="special_case" title="wikilink">special case</a> is the easier-to-understand <a href="linear_polarization" title="wikilink">linear polarization</a>.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of polarization arises as a consequence of the fact that <a href="Electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">light</a> behaves as a two-dimensional <a href="Transverse_wave#Explanation" title="wikilink">transverse wave</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-description">General description</h2>

<p>On the right is an illustration of the electric field <a href="Euclidean_vector" title="wikilink">vectors</a> of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The electric field vectors have a constant <a href="Magnitude_(vector)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given that this is a <a href="plane_wave" title="wikilink">plane wave</a>, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a <a href="Plane_wave#Polarized_electromagnetic_plane_waves" title="wikilink">circularly polarized plane wave</a>, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to <a href="Plane_wave#Polarized_electromagnetic_plane_waves" title="wikilink">these two images</a> in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an <a href="electromagnetic_wave" title="wikilink">electromagnetic wave</a> each <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a> vector that is at a <a href="right_angle" title="wikilink">right angle</a> to the electric field vector and <a href="Proportionality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">proportional</a> in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.</p>

<p>Circular polarization is often encountered in the field of optics and in this section, the electromagnetic wave will be simply referred to as <a class="uri" href="light" title="wikilink">light</a>.</p>

<p>The nature of circular polarization and its relationship to other polarizations is often understood by thinking of the electric field as being divided into two <a href="Vector_component#Vector_components" title="wikilink">components</a> which are at right angles to each other. Refer to the second illustration on the right. The vertical component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in blue while the horizontal component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in green. Notice that the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component leads the vertical component by one quarter of a <a class="uri" href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelength</a>. It is this <a href="quadrature_phase" title="wikilink">quadrature phase</a> relationship which creates the <a class="uri" href="helix" title="wikilink">helix</a> and causes the points of maximum magnitude of the vertical component to correspond with the points of zero magnitude of the horizontal component, and vice versa. The result of this alignment is that there are select vectors, corresponding to the helix, which exactly match the maxima of the vertical and horizontal components. (To minimize visual clutter these are the only helix vectors displayed.)</p>

<p>To appreciate how this quadrature <a href="phase_(waves)" title="wikilink">phase shift</a> corresponds to an electric field that rotates while maintaining a constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal <a href="Displacement_(vector)" title="wikilink">displacements</a> of the dot, relative to the center of the circle, vary <a class="uri" href="sinusoidally" title="wikilink">sinusoidally</a> in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.<br/>
 The next pair of illustrations is that of left-handed, counter-clockwise circularly polarized light when viewed by the receiver. Because it is left-handed, the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component is now <em>lagging</em> the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength rather than leading it.</p>
<h3 id="reversal-of-handedness-by-phase-shift">Reversal of Handedness by Phase Shift</h3>

<p>To convert a given handedness of polarized light to the other handedness one can use a <a href="half-wave_plate" title="wikilink">half-wave plate</a>. A half-wave plate shifts a given component of light one half of a wavelength relative to the component to which it is orthogonal.</p>
<h3 id="reversal-of-handedness-by-reflection">Reversal of Handedness by Reflection</h3>

<p>The handedness of polarized light is also reversed when it is reflected off of a surface at normal incidence. Upon such reflection, the rotation of the plane of polarization of the reflected light is identical to that of the incident field. However with propagation now in the <em>opposite</em> direction, the same rotation direction that would be described as "right handed" for the incident beam, is "left-handed" for propagation in the reverse direction, and vice versa. Aside from the reversal of handedness, the ellipticity of polarization is also preserved (except in cases of reflection by a <a class="uri" href="birefringent" title="wikilink">birefringent</a> surface).</p>

<p>Note that this principle only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the <a href="Brewster_angle" title="wikilink">Brewster angle</a>) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may be solved by decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the <a href="plane_of_incidence" title="wikilink">plane of incidence</a>, commonly denoted <em>p</em> and <em>s</em> respectively. The reflected components in the <em>p</em> and <em>s</em> linear polarizations are found by applying the <a href="Fresnel_coefficient" title="wikilink">Fresnel coefficients</a> of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, where there is no distinction between <em>p</em> and <em>s</em>, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.</p>

Note that without glasses both the beetles and their images have shiny color. The right-polarizer removes the color of the beetles but leaves the color of the images. The left-polarizer does the opposite showing reversal of handedness of the reflected light.</figcaption>

<h3 id="conversion-to-and-from-linear-polarization">Conversion to and from Linear Polarization</h3>

<p>Circularly polarized light can be converted into linearly polarized light by passing it through a <a href="quarter-wave_plate" title="wikilink">quarter-wave plate</a>. Passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-wave plate with its axes at 45° to its polarization axis will convert it to circular polarization. In fact, this is the most common way of producing circular polarization in practice. Note that passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-wave plate at an angle <em>other</em> than 45° will generally produce elliptical polarization.</p>

<p>Circular polarization may be referred to as right-handed or left-handed, and clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on the direction in which the electric field vector rotates. Unfortunately, two opposing historical conventions exist.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-point-of-view-of-the-source">From the point of view of the source</h3>

<p>Using this convention, polarization is defined from the point of view of the source. When using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one's left or right thumb <strong>away</strong> from the source, in the <strong>same</strong> direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one's fingers to the direction of the temporal rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while looking <strong>away</strong> from the source and in the <strong>same</strong> direction of the wave’s propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.</p>

<p>Using this convention, the electric field vector of a right handed circularly polarized wave is as follows:

<p>As a specific example, refer to the circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because from the point of view of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.</p>

<p>This convention is in conformity with the <a href="IEEE" title="wikilink">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</a> standard and as a result it is generally used in the engineering community.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Quantum physicists also use this convention of handedness because it is consistent with their convention of handedness for a particle’s spin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Radio astronomers also use this convention in accordance with an <a href="International_Astronomical_Union" title="wikilink">International Astronomical Union (IAU)</a> resolution made in 1973.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="from-the-point-of-view-of-the-receiver">From the point of view of the receiver</h3>

<p>In this alternative convention, polarization is defined from the point of view of the receiver. Using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one’s left or right thumb <strong>toward</strong> the source, <strong>against</strong> the direction of propagation, and then matching the curling of one's fingers to the temporal rotation of the field.</p>

<p>When using this convention, in contrast to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.</p>

<p>When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the receiver and, while looking <strong>toward</strong> the source, <strong>against</strong> the direction of propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.</p>

<p>Just as in the other convention, right-handedness corresponds to a clockwise rotation and left-handedness corresponds to an anti-clockwise rotation.</p>

<p>Many optics textbooks use this second convention.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="uses-of-the-two-conventions">Uses of the two conventions</h3>

<p>As stated earlier, there is significant confusion with regards to these two conventions. As a general rule the engineering, quantum physics, and radio astronomy communities use the first convention where the wave is observed from the point of view of the source.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In many physics textbooks dealing with optics the second convention is used where the light is observed from the point of view of the receiver.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>To avoid confusion, it is good practice to specify “as defined from the point of view of the source” or "as defined from the point of view of the receiver" when discussing polarization matters.</p>

<p>The archive of the <a href="http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/">US Federal Standard 1037C</a> proposes two contradictory conventions of handedness.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fm-radio">FM radio</h2>

<p>The term "circular polarization" is often used erroneously to describe mixed polarity signals used mostly in <a href="FM_radio" title="wikilink">FM radio</a> (87.5 to 108.0 MHz in the USA), where a vertical and a horizontal component are propagated simultaneously by a single or a combined array. This has the effect of producing greater penetration into buildings and difficult reception areas than a signal with just one plane of polarization. This would be an instance where the polarization would more appropriately be called random polarization because the polarization at a receiver, although constant, will vary depending on the direction from the transmitter and other factors in the transmitting antenna design. See <a href="Stokes_parameters" title="wikilink">Stokes parameters</a>.<br/>
The term "FM radio" above refers to broadcast radio, not 2-way radio (more properly called <a href="Land_Mobile_Radio" title="wikilink">Land Mobile Radio</a>), which uses vertical polarization almost exclusively.</p>
<h2 id="circular-dichroism">Circular dichroism</h2>

<p><strong>Circular dichroism (CD)</strong> is the differential absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarized <a class="uri" href="light" title="wikilink">light</a>. Circular dichroism is the basis of a form of <a class="uri" href="spectroscopy" title="wikilink">spectroscopy</a> that can be used to determine the <a href="optical_isomerism" title="wikilink">optical isomerism</a> and secondary structure of <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecules</a>.</p>

<p>In general, this phenomenon will be exhibited in absorption bands of any <a href="optical_activity" title="wikilink">optically active</a> molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by most biological molecules, because of the <a class="uri" href="dextrorotary" title="wikilink">dextrorotary</a> (e.g. some <a href="sugar" title="wikilink">sugars</a>) and <a class="uri" href="levorotary" title="wikilink">levorotary</a> (e.g. some <a href="amino_acid" title="wikilink">amino acids</a>) molecules they contain. Noteworthy as well is that a <a href="secondary_structure" title="wikilink">secondary structure</a> will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the <a href="alpha_helix" title="wikilink">alpha helix</a>, <a href="beta_sheet" title="wikilink">beta sheet</a> and <a href="random_coil" title="wikilink">random coil</a> regions of proteins and the <a href="double_helix" title="wikilink">double helix</a> of <a href="nucleic_acids" title="wikilink">nucleic acids</a> have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.</p>

<p>Also, under the right conditions, even non-chiral molecules will exhibit <a href="magnetic_circular_dichroism" title="wikilink">magnetic circular dichroism</a>, that is, circular dichroism induced by a magnetic field.</p>
<h2 id="circularly-polarized-luminescence">Circularly polarized luminescence</h2>

<p><em>Circularly polarized luminescence</em> (CPL) can occur when either a <a class="uri" href="luminophore" title="wikilink">luminophore</a> or an ensemble of luminophores is <a href="Chirality_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">chiral</a>. The extent to which emissions are polarized is quantified in the same way it is for <a href="circular_dichroism" title="wikilink">circular dichroism</a>, in terms of the <em>dissymmetry factor</em><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/dissymmetry-factor">3</a>, also sometimes referred to as the <em><a class="uri" href="anisotropy" title="wikilink">anisotropy</a> factor</em>.

<p>A number of different types of antenna elements can be utilized to produce circularly polarized (or nearly so) radiation; following Balanis,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> one can use <a href="Dipole_antenna" title="wikilink"><em>dipole elements</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"two crossed dipoles provide the two orthogonal field components... If the two dipoles are identical, the field intensity of each along zenith ... would be of the same intensity. Also, if the two dipoles were fed with a 90° degree time-phase difference (phase quadrature), the polarization along zenith would be circular... One way to obtain the 90° time-phase difference between the two orthogonal field components, radiated respectively by the two dipoles, is by feeding one of the two dipoles with a transmission line which is 1/4 wavelength longer or shorter than that of the other", p.80;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or <a href="Helical_antenna" title="wikilink"><em>helical elements</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"To achieve circular polarization [in axial or end-fire mode] ... the circumference <em>C</em> of the helix must be ... with <em>C</em>/wavelength = 1 near optimum, and the spacing about <em>S</em> = wavelength/4." p.571;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or <a href="Patch_antenna#Circular_polarization" title="wikilink"><em>patch elements</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"circular and elliptical polarizations can be obtained using various feed arrangements or slight modifications made to the elements... Circular polarization can be obtained if two orthogonal modes are excited with a 90° time-phase difference between them. This can be accomplished by adjusting the physical dimensions of the patch ... For a square patch element, the easiest way to excite ideally circular polarization is to feed the element at two adjacent edges ... The quadrature phase difference is obtained by feeding the element with a 90° power divider", p.859.</p>

<h2 id="quantum-mechanics">Quantum mechanics</h2>

<p>In the quantum mechanical view, light is composed of <a href="photon_polarization" title="wikilink">photons</a>. Polarization is a manifestation of the intrinsic angular momentum (the spin) of the photon. More specifically, in quantum mechanics the direction of spin of a photon is tied to the handedness of the circularly polarized light and the spin of a beam of photons is similar to the spin of a beam of particles, such as electrons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<figcaption>The <a href="Cetonia_aurata" title="wikilink">rose chafer</a>'s external surface reflects almost only left circularly polarized light.</figcaption>

<p>Only a few mechanisms in nature are known to systematically produce circularly polarized light. In 1911, <a href="Albert_Abraham_Michelson" title="wikilink">Albert Abraham Michelson</a> discovered that <a class="uri" href="light" title="wikilink">light</a> reflected from the golden scarab beetle <em><a href="Chrysina_resplendens" title="wikilink">Chrysina resplendens</a></em> is preferentially left-polarized. Since then, circular polarization has been measured in several other <a href="Scarabaeidae" title="wikilink">scarab beetles</a> like <em>Chrysina gloriosa</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> as well as some <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a> such as the <a href="mantis_shrimp" title="wikilink">mantis shrimp</a>.

For fireflies, it is more difficult to find a microscopic explanation for the polarization, because the left and right lanterns of the larvae were found to emit polarized light of opposite senses. The authors suggest that the light begins with a <a href="linear_polarization" title="wikilink">linear polarization</a> due to inhomogeneties inside aligned <a href="photocyte" title="wikilink">photocytes</a>, and it picks up circular polarization while passing through linearly <a class="uri" href="birefringent" title="wikilink">birefringent</a> tissue.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Water-air interfaces provide another source of circular polarization. Sunlight that gets scattered back up towards the surface is linearly polarized. If this light is then <a href="total_internal_reflection" title="wikilink">totally internally reflected</a> back down, its vertical component undergoes a phase shift. To an underwater observer looking up, the faint light outside <a href="Snell's_window" title="wikilink">Snell's window</a> therefore is (partially) circularly polarized.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>Weaker sources of circular polarization in nature include multiple scattering by linear polarizers, as in the circular polarization of starlight, and selective absorption by <a href="circular_dichroism" title="wikilink">circularly dichroic</a> media.</p>

<p>Two species of Mantis Shrimp have been reported to be able to detect circular polarized light.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="starlight">Starlight</h2>

<p>The <strong>circular polarization of starlight</strong> has been observed to be a function of the linear <a href="Polarization_(waves)" title="wikilink">polarization</a> of <a class="uri" href="starlight" title="wikilink">starlight</a>.</p>

<p>Starlight becomes partially linearly polarized by scattering from elongated <a href="interstellar_dust" title="wikilink">interstellar dust</a> grains whose long axes tend to be oriented perpendicular to the galactic <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a>. According to the Davis-Greenstein mechanism, the grains spin rapidly with their rotation axis along the magnetic field. Light polarized along the direction of the magnetic field <a class="uri" href="perpendicular" title="wikilink">perpendicular</a> to the line of sight is transmitted, while light polarized in the plane defined by the rotating grain is blocked. Thus the polarization direction can be used to map out the galactic magnetic field. The degree of polarization is on the order of 1.5% for stars at 1000 <a href="parsec" title="wikilink">parsecs</a> distance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Normally, a much smaller fraction of circular polarization is found in starlight. Serkowski, Mathewson and Ford<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> measured the polarization of 180 stars in UBVR filters. They found a maximum fractional circular polarization of

<p>The explanation is that the interstellar medium is optically thin. Starlight traveling through a kiloparsec column undergoes about a magnitude of extinction, so that the optical depth ~ 1. An optical depth of 1 corresponds to a mean free path, which is the distance, on average that a photon travels before scattering from a dust grain. So on average, a starlight photon is scattered from a single interstellar grain; multiple scattering (which produces circular polarization) is much less likely. Observationally,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> the linear polarization fraction p ~ 0.015 from a single scattering; circular polarization from multiple scattering goes as

<p>The interstellar medium can produce circularly polarized (CP) light from unpolarized light by sequential scattering from elongated interstellar grains aligned in different directions. One possibility is twisted grain alignment along the line of sight due to variation in the galactic magnetic field; another is the line of sight passes through multiple clouds. For these mechanisms the maximum expected CP fraction is

<p>Martin<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> showed that the interstellar medium can convert LP light to CP by scattering from partially aligned interstellar grains having a complex index of refraction.

<p>An optically thick circumstellar environment can potentially produce much larger CP than the interstellar medium.

The following resolution was adopted by Commissions 25 and 40: 'RESOLVED, that the frame of reference for the Stokes parameters is that of Right Ascension and Declination with the position angle of electric-vector maximum, q, starting from North and increasing through East. Elliptical polarization is defined in conformity with the definitions of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE Standard 211, 1969).

In general, the figure, i.e., polarization, is elliptical and is traced in a clockwise or anti-clockwise sense, as viewed in the direction of propagation. ... Rotation of the electric vector in a clockwise sense is designated right-hand polarization, and rotation in a anti-clockwise sense is designated left-hand polarization .
