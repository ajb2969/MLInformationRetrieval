<p><strong>Catherine "Kate" Bush</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">CBE</a> (born 30 July 1958)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is an English singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer known for her <a href="eclecticism_in_music" title="wikilink">eclectic</a> musical style and her <a href="Idiosyncrasy" title="wikilink">idiosyncratic</a> <a class="uri" href="soprano" title="wikilink">soprano</a> vocal performances.</p>

<p>In 1978, at the age of 19, Bush topped the <a href="UK_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Singles Chart</a> for four weeks with her debut single, "<a href="Wuthering_Heights_(song)" title="wikilink">Wuthering Heights</a>", becoming the first woman to have a UK number one with a self-written song.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> She has since released ten albums, three of which topped the <a href="UK_Albums_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Albums Chart</a>. She has had 25 UK <a href="Top_40" title="wikilink">Top 40</a> hit singles, including the Top 10 hits "<a href="Wuthering_Heights_(song)" title="wikilink">Wuthering Heights</a>", "<a href="The_Man_with_the_Child_in_His_Eyes" title="wikilink">The Man with the Child in His Eyes</a>", "<a href="Babooshka_(song)" title="wikilink">Babooshka</a>", "<a href="Running_Up_That_Hill" title="wikilink">Running Up That Hill</a>" (as well as its <a href="Running_Up_That_Hill#2012_remix" title="wikilink">2012 remix</a>), "<a href="Don't_Give_Up_(Peter_Gabriel_and_Kate_Bush_song)" title="wikilink">Don't Give Up</a>" (a duet with <a href="Peter_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Peter Gabriel</a>) and "<a href="King_of_the_Mountain_(song)" title="wikilink">King of the Mountain</a>".</p>

<p>Bush has been nominated 13 times for <a href="British_Phonographic_Industry" title="wikilink">British Phonographic Industry</a> accolades,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and in 1987 she won a <a href="Brit_Award" title="wikilink">Brit Award</a> for Best British Female Artist.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> During the course of her career, she has also been nominated for three <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a>. In 2002, she was recognised with an <a href="Ivor_Novello_Award" title="wikilink">Ivor Novello Award</a> for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. She is the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at Number 1.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> She is also the first (and to date only) female artist to have Top 5 albums in the UK charts in five successive decades.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In August 2014, she became the first female performer to have eight albums in the Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums (behind <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a> with 12 albums in 1977, and <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">The Beatles</a> in 2009 with 11 albums); altogether she had 11 albums in the top 50.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush was appointed <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the <a href="2013_New_Year_Honours" title="wikilink">2013 New Year Honours</a> for services to music.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> She received the award from Queen Elizabeth II on 10 April 2013 at Windsor Castle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Bush was born in <a class="uri" href="Bexleyheath" title="wikilink">Bexleyheath</a>, <a class="uri" href="Kent" title="wikilink">Kent</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> (now part of the London Borough of Bexley) to English medical doctor Robert Bush (1920-2008) and his Irish wife, Hannah Daly (1918-1992; from <a href="County_Waterford" title="wikilink">County Waterford</a>, <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> She was raised as a <a href="Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> in their farmhouse in <a href="East_Wickham" title="wikilink">East Wickham</a> with her older brothers, John and <a href="Paddy_Bush" title="wikilink">Paddy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was an accomplished traditional Irish dancer, her father was an accomplished pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk music</a> scene.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>John was a <a class="uri" href="karateka" title="wikilink">karateka</a> at <a href="Goldsmiths,_University_of_London" title="wikilink">Goldsmiths College</a> karate club and Kate also trained there, becoming known as "Ee-ee" because of her squeaky <a class="uri" href="kiai" title="wikilink">kiai</a>. One of the instructors, <a href="Dave_Hazard" title="wikilink">Dave Hazard</a>, later noted in his autobiography that her dance moves seemed to owe something to karate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Her family's musical influence inspired Bush to teach herself the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents' house and studied the violin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> She soon began writing her own tunes and eventually added <a class="uri" href="lyrics" title="wikilink">lyrics</a> to them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, <a href="Abbey_Wood" title="wikilink">Abbey Wood</a>, South East London, in the mid-1970s. During this time her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. <a href="David_Gilmour" title="wikilink">David Gilmour</a> of <a href="Pink_Floyd" title="wikilink">Pink Floyd</a> received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend <a href="Andrew_Powell" title="wikilink">Andrew Powell</a>, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and sound engineer <a href="Geoff_Emerick" title="wikilink">Geoff Emerick</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The tape was sent to <a class="uri" href="EMI" title="wikilink">EMI</a> executive Terry Slater.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> <a href="Progressive_rock" title="wikilink">Progressive rock</a> was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was good enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> For the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock <a href="GCE_Advanced_Level" title="wikilink">A-levels</a> and having gained ten GCE <a class="uri" href="O-Level" title="wikilink">O-Level</a> qualifications.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In 2005, Bush stated in an interview with <a href="Mark_Radcliffe" title="wikilink">Mark Radcliffe</a> on <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a> that she believed EMI signed her before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in <a href="interpretive_dance" title="wikilink">interpretive dance</a> classes taught by <a href="Lindsay_Kemp" title="wikilink">Lindsay Kemp</a>, a former teacher of <a href="David_Bowie" title="wikilink">David Bowie</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and mime training with <a href="Adam_Darius" title="wikilink">Adam Darius</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the <em>Phoenix Recordings</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses around London – specifically at the Rose of Lee public house (now Dirty South) in Lewisham. The other three band members were <a href="Del_Palmer" title="wikilink">Del Palmer</a> (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> although two tracks had been recorded during the summer of 1975.</p>
<h3 id="the-kick-inside-and-lionheart"><em>The Kick Inside</em> and <em>Lionheart</em></h3>

<p>As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, <em><a href="The_Kick_Inside" title="wikilink">The Kick Inside</a></em> (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the <a class="uri" href="balalaika" title="wikilink">balalaika</a> and <a class="uri" href="didgeridoo" title="wikilink">didgeridoo</a>. <a href="Stuart_Elliott_(drummer)" title="wikilink">Stuart Elliott</a> played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush released <em>The Kick Inside</em> when she was 19 years old, but some of the songs had been written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her début single, but Bush insisted that it should be "<a href="Wuthering_Heights_(song)" title="wikilink">Wuthering Heights</a>". Even at this early stage of her career, she had gained a reputation for her determination to have a say in decisions affecting her work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> "Wuthering Heights" topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Bush became the first woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self-penned song. Despite her considerable subsequent chart success it is still her only No. 1 single (as at 2015).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> A second single, "The Man with the Child in His Eyes", reached number six in the UK charts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> It also made it onto the American <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> Hot 100</a> where it reached number 85 in early 1979, and went on to win her an <a href="Ivor_Novello_Award" title="wikilink">Ivor Novello Award</a> in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Bob Mercer felt that Bush's relative lack of success in the United States compared to the rest of the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with <em><a class="uri" href="NME" title="wikilink">NME</a></em> magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating: "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, <em><a href="Lionheart_(Kate_Bush_album)" title="wikilink">Lionheart</a></em>, to take advantage of the success of <em>The Kick Inside</em>. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with <em>Lionheart</em>, feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably "<a href="Wow_(Kate_Bush_song)" title="wikilink">Wow</a>", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush was displeased with being rushed into making the second album. She set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the company's board of directors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> The tour, named <a href="The_Tour_of_Life" title="wikilink">The Tour of Life</a>, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician <a href="Simon_Drake" title="wikilink">Simon Drake</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Typical of her determination to have creative control, she was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a <a href="Wireless_microphone" title="wikilink">radio microphone</a> to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group <a href="the_Spotnicks" title="wikilink">the Spotnicks</a> used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="never-for-ever-and-the-dreaming"><em>Never for Ever</em> and <em>The Dreaming</em></h3>

<p>Released in September 1980, <em><a href="Never_for_Ever" title="wikilink">Never for Ever</a></em> saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on her <em><a href="On_Stage_(EP)" title="wikilink">Live on Stage</a></em> <a href="Extended_play" title="wikilink">EP</a>, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on <em>Never for Ever</em> is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "<a href="Army_Dreamers" title="wikilink">Army Dreamers</a>".</p>

<p><em>Never for Ever</em> was the first Kate Bush album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the <a href="Fairlight_CMI" title="wikilink">Fairlight CMI</a>, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on <a href="Peter_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Peter Gabriel</a>'s <a class="uri" href="eponymous" title="wikilink">eponymous</a> <a href="Peter_Gabriel_(1980_album)" title="wikilink">third album</a> in early 1980.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The top-selling single from the album was "<a href="Babooshka_(song)" title="wikilink">Babooshka</a>", which reached number five in the UK singles chart.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> In November 1980, she released the standalone <a href="Christmas_music" title="wikilink">Christmas single</a> "<a href="December_Will_Be_Magic_Again" title="wikilink">December Will Be Magic Again</a>", which reached number 29 in the UK charts.</p>

<p>September 1982 saw the release of <em><a href="The_Dreaming_(album)" title="wikilink">The Dreaming</a></em>, the first album Bush produced by herself.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. <em>The Dreaming</em> received a mixed critical reception in the UK, and many were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become "less accessible".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> In a 1993 interview with <em><a href="Q_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Q (magazine)</a></em>, Bush stated: "That was my 'She's gone mad' album."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> However, the album became her first to enter the US <a href="Billboard_200" title="wikilink"><em>Billboard</em> 200</a> chart, albeit only reaching number 157.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The album entered the UK album chart at number three, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering only a silver disc.</p>

<p>"<a href="Sat_in_Your_Lap" title="wikilink">Sat in Your Lap</a>" was the first single from the album to be released. It pre-dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The album's <a href="The_Dreaming_(song)" title="wikilink">title track</a>, featuring the talents of <a href="Rolf_Harris" title="wikilink">Rolf Harris</a> and <a href="Percy_Edwards" title="wikilink">Percy Edwards</a>, stalled at number 48, while the third single, "<a href="There_Goes_a_Tenner" title="wikilink">There Goes a Tenner</a>", failed to chart, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track "<a href="Suspended_in_Gaffa" title="wikilink">Suspended in Gaffa</a>" was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.</p>

<p>Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for "There Goes a Tenner", a documentary about the <a href="Vietnam_War" title="wikilink">war in Vietnam</a> for "Pull Out the Pin", and the plight of <a href="Indigenous_Australians" title="wikilink">Indigenous Australians</a> for "The Dreaming". "Houdini" is about <a href="Harry_Houdini" title="wikilink">the magician</a>'s death, and "Get Out of My House" was inspired by <a href="Stephen_King" title="wikilink">Stephen King</a>'s novel <em><a href="The_Shining_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Shining</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hounds-of-love-and-the-whole-story"><em>Hounds of Love</em> and <em>The Whole Story</em></h3>

<p><em><a href="Hounds_of_Love" title="wikilink">Hounds of Love</a></em> was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> <em>Hounds of Love</em> ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="wikilink">Madonna</a>'s <em><a href="Like_a_Virgin_(album)" title="wikilink">Like a Virgin</a></em> from the number one position.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, <em>Hounds of Love</em>, contains five "accessible" pop songs, including the four singles "<a href="Running_Up_that_Hill" title="wikilink">Running Up that Hill</a>", "<a class="uri" href="Cloudbusting" title="wikilink">Cloudbusting</a>", "<a href="Hounds_of_Love_(song)" title="wikilink">Hounds of Love</a>", and <a href="The_Big_Sky_(song)" title="wikilink">"The Big Sky"</a>. "Running Up that Hill" reached number 3 in the UK charts and re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to number 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the album, <em>The Ninth Wave</em>, takes its name from <a href="Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson" title="wikilink">Tennyson's</a> poem, "Idylls of the King", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 <a href="BRIT_Awards" title="wikilink">BRIT Awards</a>. In the same year, Bush and <a href="Peter_Gabriel" title="wikilink">Peter Gabriel</a> had a UK top ten hit with the duet "<a href="Don't_Give_Up_(Peter_Gabriel_and_Kate_Bush_song)" title="wikilink">Don't Give Up</a>" (<a href="Dolly_Parton" title="wikilink">Dolly Parton</a>, Gabriel's original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> and EMI released her "greatest hits" album, <em><a href="The_Whole_Story" title="wikilink">The Whole Story</a></em>. Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on "Wuthering Heights," and recorded a new single, "<a href="Experiment_IV" title="wikilink">Experiment IV</a>," for inclusion on the compilation. <a href="Dawn_French" title="wikilink">Dawn French</a> and <a href="Hugh_Laurie" title="wikilink">Hugh Laurie</a> were among those featured in the video for Experiment IV. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist.</p>
<h3 id="the-sensual-world-and-the-red-shoes"><em>The Sensual World</em> and <em>The Red Shoes</em></h3>

<p>The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's <em><a href="The_Sensual_World" title="wikilink">The Sensual World</a></em>. One of the quirkiest tracks on the album, touched by Bush's <a href="black_humour" title="wikilink">black humour</a>, is "Heads We're Dancing", about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is <a href="Adolf_Hitler" title="wikilink">Adolf Hitler</a>. The <a href="The_Sensual_World_(song)" title="wikilink">title track</a> drew its inspiration from <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a>'s novel <em><a href="Ulysses_(novel)" title="wikilink">Ulysses</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p><em>The Sensual World</em> went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number two position.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1990, the boxed-set <em><a href="This_Woman's_Work:_Anthology_1978–1990" title="wikilink">This Woman's Work</a></em> was released and included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs of all single B sides recorded from 1978 to 1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of Elton John's "<a href="Rocket_Man_(song)" title="wikilink">Rocket Man</a>", which reached number 12 in the UK singles chart,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> and went as high as number two in Australia, and in 2007, was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of <em><a href="The_Observer" title="wikilink">The Observer</a></em> newspaper.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> She recorded "Candle in the Wind", as the single's b-side.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush's seventh studio album, <em><a href="The_Red_Shoes_(album)" title="wikilink">The Red Shoes</a></em>, was released in November 1993. The album features more high-profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts, including contributions from composer and conductor <a href="Michael_Kamen" title="wikilink">Michael Kamen</a>, comedy actor <a href="Lenny_Henry" title="wikilink">Lenny Henry</a>, <a href="Prince_(musician)" title="wikilink">Prince</a>, <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Gary_Brooker" title="wikilink">Gary Brooker</a> of <a href="Procol_Harum" title="wikilink">Procol Harum</a>, Trevor Whittaker, and <a href="Jeff_Beck" title="wikilink">Jeff Beck</a>. Both <em>The Sensual World</em> and <em>The Red Shoes</em> featured contributions from <a href="Trio_Bulgarka" title="wikilink">Trio Bulgarka</a>, the Bulgarian female vocal trio, who sang on six tracks, including "You're The One" and "Rocket's Tail". The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number 28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was "Rubberband Girl", which peaked at number 88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number two, and the singles "Rubberband Girl", "The Red Shoes", "Moments of Pleasure", and "And So Is Love" all reached the top 30.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> In 1994, Bush released an accompanying short film, <em><a href="The_Line,_the_Cross_&amp;_the_Curve" title="wikilink">The Line, the Cross &amp; the Curve</a></em>. Written, directed by, and starring Bush, along with English actress <a href="Miranda_Richardson" title="wikilink">Miranda Richardson</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> the film was based around the concept of <em>The Red Shoes</em> and featured six of the songs from the album.</p>

<p>The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush deliberately aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re-create on stage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>This period had been a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist <a href="Alan_Murphy" title="wikilink">Alan Murphy</a>, who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Many of the people she lost are honoured in the ballad "Moments of Pleasure." However, Bush's mother was still alive when "Moments of Pleasure" was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, "Every old sock meets an old shoe," was hilarious and "couldn't stop laughing."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="aerial"><em>Aerial</em></h3>

<p>After the release of <em>The Red Shoes</em>, Kate Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. Bush had originally intended to take one year off but despite working on material twelve years passed before her next album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with <a href="Miss_Havisham" title="wikilink">Miss Havisham</a> from <a href="Charles_Dickens" title="wikilink">Charles Dickens</a>'s <em><a href="Great_Expectations" title="wikilink">Great Expectations</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In 1998, Bush had given birth to Albert, known as "Bertie", fathered by her guitarist and now husband Danny McIntosh.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> In 2001, Bush was awarded a <a href="Q_Awards" title="wikilink">Q Awards</a> as Classic Songwriter.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> In 2002, she was awarded an <a href="Ivor_Novello_Award" title="wikilink">Ivor Novello Award</a> for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed <a href="Comfortably_Numb" title="wikilink">Comfortably Numb</a> at David Gilmour's concert at the <a href="Royal_Festival_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Festival Hall</a> in London.</p>

<p>Kate Bush's eighth studio album, <em><a href="Aerial_(album)" title="wikilink">Aerial</a></em>, was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The first single from the album was "<a href="King_of_the_Mountain_(song)" title="wikilink">King of the Mountain</a>", which was played for the first time on <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a> on 21 September 2005.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>

<p>As on <em>Hounds of Love</em> (1985), the album is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled <em>A Sea of Honey</em>, features a set of unrelated themed songs, including "King of the Mountain"; "Bertie", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and "Joanni", based on the story of <a href="Joan_of_Arc" title="wikilink">Joan of Arc</a>.

The second disc, subtitled <em>A Sky of Honey</em>, features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of being outdoors after waking at dawn, moving through afternoon, dusk, to night, then back to the following dawn of single summer's day. All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to sky and sea in their lyrical content. Bush mixed her voice with cooing woodpigeons to repeat the phrases "A sea of honey, a sky of honey," and "You're full of beauty" throughout the piece, and uses recordings of actual birdsong throughout. <em>A Sky of Honey</em> features <a href="Rolf_Harris" title="wikilink">Rolf Harris</a> playing the <a class="uri" href="didgeridoo" title="wikilink">didgeridoo</a> on one track, and providing vocals on "The Painter's Link". Other artists making guest appearances on the album include <a href="Peter_Erskine" title="wikilink">Peter Erskine</a>, <a href="Eberhard_Weber" title="wikilink">Eberhard Weber</a>, <a href="Lol_Creme" title="wikilink">Lol Creme</a>, and Gary Brooker. Two tracks feature string arrangements by <a href="Michael_Kamen" title="wikilink">Michael Kamen</a>, performed by the <a href="London_Metropolitan_Orchestra" title="wikilink">London Metropolitan Orchestra</a>. A CD release of the single "King of the Mountain" included a cover of "Sexual Healing" by <a href="Marvin_Gaye" title="wikilink">Marvin Gaye</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>"King of the Mountain" entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six on 17 October 2005,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> and by 30 October it had become Bush's third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. <em>Aerial</em> entered the UK albums chart at number 3,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> and the US chart at number 48.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Bush herself carried out relatively little publicity for the album, only conducting a handful of magazine and radio interviews. <em>Aerial</em> earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 BRIT Awards, for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>In late 2007, Bush composed and recorded a new song, "Lyra", for the soundtrack to the fantasy film <em><a href="The_Golden_Compass_(film)" title="wikilink">The Golden Compass</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="directors-cut"><em>Director's Cut</em></h3>

<p>On 16 May 2011, Bush released the album <em><a href="Director's_Cut_(Kate_Bush_album)" title="wikilink">Director's Cut</a></em>. The album, which Bush has described as an entirely new project rather than a collection of mere remixes, contains 11 tracks of substantially reworked material from her earlier albums <em>The Sensual World</em> and <em>The Red Shoes</em>, all of which have been recorded using analogue, rather than digital, equipment to create "a warmer sound". All the tracks have new lead vocals, new drums, and radically reworked instrumentation. Some of them have been transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including "<a href="This_Woman's_Work" title="wikilink">This Woman's Work</a>", have been completely re-recorded, with lyrics often changed in places.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> The album has been met with a wide range of reviews with most reviewers a bit confused about the concept of the album itself, while responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm about its revamped tracks. Of particular note is the warmer, more intimate tone of the songs and the richer, more mature sound of her voice.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> This is the first album on her new label, Fish People, a division of EMI Records, with whom she's had a relationship since she started recording. In addition to the album <em>Director's Cut</em> in both its single CD form and in a box-set with <em>The Sensual World</em> and the analogue re-mastered <em>The Red Shoes</em>, Fish People will be releasing re-mastered editions of <em>The Hounds of Love</em> and <em>The Dreaming</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The album debuted at number 2 on the United Kingdom chart.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>The song "The Sensual World" has been renamed "Flower of the Mountain" and contains a passage of <a href="Molly_Bloom" title="wikilink">Molly Bloom</a>'s famous soliloquy from <a href="James_Joyce" title="wikilink">James Joyce</a>'s novel <em><a href="Ulysses_(novel)" title="wikilink">Ulysses</a></em>. Bush said, "Originally when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text from the end of <em>Ulysses</em>. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p>The first single released from the album was "<a href="Deeper_Understanding" title="wikilink">Deeper Understanding</a>" and contains a new chorus featuring computerised vocals from Bush's son, Albert. A video for the song, directed by Bush, has been released through her channel on <a class="uri" href="YouTube" title="wikilink">YouTube</a>. It features <a href="Robbie_Coltrane" title="wikilink">Robbie Coltrane</a> as a man consumed by his relationship with his computer (voiced by Bush's son). <a href="Frances_Barber" title="wikilink">Frances Barber</a> plays the man's wife, and <a href="Noel_Fielding" title="wikilink">Noel Fielding</a> also appears.</p>
<h3 id="words-for-snow"><em>50 Words for Snow</em></h3>

<p>Bush's next studio album, <em><a href="50_Words_for_Snow" title="wikilink">50 Words for Snow</a></em>, was released on 21 November 2011. The album contains seven new songs "set against a backdrop of falling snow," with a total running time of 65 minutes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> A radio edit of the first single, "Wild Man," was played on <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a>'s <em><a href="The_Ken_Bruce_Show" title="wikilink">The Ken Bruce Show</a></em> on 10 October.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> and was released as a digital download on 11 October.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The album is distributed in the United States by <a class="uri" href="Anti-Records" title="wikilink">Anti-Records</a>.</p>

<p>On 14 November 2011, <a class="uri" href="NPR" title="wikilink">NPR</a> played <em>50 Words for Snow</em> in its entirety for the first time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Australia's <a href="ABC_Radio_National" title="wikilink">ABC Radio National</a> declared <em>50 Words for Snow</em> album of the week of 12 November 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<p>The album's songs are built around Bush's quietly jazzy piano and <a href="Steve_Gadd" title="wikilink">Steve Gadd</a>'s drums, and utilise both sung and spoken word vocals in what <a href="Classic_Rock_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Classic Rock</a>'s <a href="Stephen_Dalton" title="wikilink">Stephen Dalton</a> calls "a ... supple and experimental affair, with a contemporary chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano, minimal percussion and light-touch electronics ... billowing jazz-rock soundscapes, interwoven with fragmentary narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to <a href="Laurie_Anderson" title="wikilink">Laurie Anderson</a>-style cooing."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> Bassist <a href="Danny_Thompson" title="wikilink">Danny Thompson</a> appears on the album, which also features performances by <a href="Elton_John" title="wikilink">Elton John</a> and actor <a href="Stephen_Fry" title="wikilink">Stephen Fry</a>.</p>

<p>On the first track, "Snowflake," in a song written specifically to use his still high choir-boy voice,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> Bush's son Albert (Bertie) sings the role of a falling snowflake in a song expressing the hope of a noisy world soon being hushed by snowfall. "Snowflake" drifts into "Lake Tahoe", where choral singer Stefan Roberts and Bush sing about a rarely seen ghost: a woman who appears in a Victorian gown to call to her dog, Snowflake. Bush explained to fellow musician <a href="Jamie_Cullum" title="wikilink">Jamie Cullum</a> in an interview on Dutch Radio<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> that she wished to explore using high male voices in contrast to her own, deeper, voice. "Misty" is about a snowman lover who melts away after a night of passion, while "Wild Man" tells the story of a group of climbers in the <a class="uri" href="Himalayas" title="wikilink">Himalayas</a> who, upon finding evidence of a nearby <a class="uri" href="Yeti" title="wikilink">Yeti</a>, erase all traces of it to protect it from discovery. Elton John and Bush as eternally divided lovers trade vocals on "Snowed in at Wheeler Street", while Stephen Fry recites the "50 Words for Snow". The quiet "Among Angels" finishes the album.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p><em>50 Words for Snow</em> received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 26 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> She was nominated for a <a href="Brit_Award" title="wikilink">Brit Award</a> in the "Best Female Artist" category,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> and the album won the 2012 Best Album at the South Bank Arts Awards,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> and was also nominated for Best Album at the Ivor Novello Awards.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush turned down an invitation by the organisers of the <a href="2012_Summer_Olympics_closing_ceremony" title="wikilink">2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony</a> to perform at the event. Instead a recording of a new remix of her 1985 hit "Running Up that Hill" was played at the end of the ceremony.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Bush released an exclusive limited-edition 10" picture disc of the 2012 remix as part of <a href="Record_Store_Day" title="wikilink">Record Store Day</a> 2013 on 20 April 2013.</p>
<h2 id="musical-style">Musical style</h2>

<p>Bush has a <a class="uri" href="soprano" title="wikilink">soprano</a> vocal range.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> Her musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together many diverse influences, drawing on <a href="classical_music" title="wikilink">classical music</a>, <a href="art_rock" title="wikilink">art rock</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> and a wide range of <a href="ethnic_music" title="wikilink">ethnic</a> and <a href="folk_music" title="wikilink">folk</a> sources. This would continue throughout her career. By the time of <em><a href="Never_for_Ever" title="wikilink">Never for Ever</a></em>, Bush had begun to make prominent use of the <a href="Fairlight_CMI" title="wikilink">Fairlight CMI</a> synthesizer, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Her career output has been broadly categorized as <a href="art_pop" title="wikilink">art pop</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> <a href="baroque_pop" title="wikilink">baroque pop</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> and <a href="art_rock" title="wikilink">art rock</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>

<p>Bush's vocals contain elements of British, <a class="uri" href="Anglo-Irish" title="wikilink">Anglo-Irish</a> and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its utilisation of musical instruments from many periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Elements of Bush's lyrics often employ historical or literary references and avoid autobiographical ones. She considers herself a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and strenuously rejects efforts by others to insist that her songs are autobiographical.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<p>In an interview with <em><a href="Melody_Maker" title="wikilink">Melody Maker</a></em> magazine in 1977, she revealed that male artists had more influence on her work than females, stating: "Every female you see at a piano is either <a href="Lynsey_de_Paul" title="wikilink">Lynsey de Paul</a>, or <a href="Carole_King" title="wikilink">Carole King</a>. And most male music—not all of it but the good stuff—really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn123" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>Reviewers have used the term "surreal" to describe her music.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn124" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Many of her songs have a melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn125" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> It has been observed that even the more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy, and even the most sorrowful pieces have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>Her lyrics have referenced a wide array of subject matter, often relatively obscure, as in <a href="G._I._Gurdjieff" title="wikilink">G. I. Gurdjieff</a> in the song "<a href="Them_Heavy_People" title="wikilink">Them Heavy People</a>", while "<a href="Deeper_Understanding" title="wikilink">Deeper Understanding</a>", from <em><a href="The_Sensual_World" title="wikilink">The Sensual World</a></em>, portrays a person who stays indoors, obsessively talking to a computer and shunning human contact. "<a class="uri" href="Cloudbusting" title="wikilink">Cloudbusting</a>" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, "Book of Dreams", about his relationship with his father, <a href="Wilhelm_Reich" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Reich</a>. In a retrospective review of "Cloudbusting", <em><a class="uri" href="AllMusic" title="wikilink">AllMusic</a></em> journalist Amy Hanson praised the song for "the rich earth of imagery that Bush has tilled throughout her entire career, emerging both tender and brutal." Commending the song for having "a thoughtful lyric and a compulsive cello-driven melody", Hanson wrote: "Even more startling, but hardly surprising, is the ease with which Bush was able to capture the moment when a child first realizes that adults are fallible and the parental cocoon is tenuous at best."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a></p>

<p>Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her work. She has cited <a href="Woody_Allen" title="wikilink">Woody Allen</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> <em><a href="Monty_Python" title="wikilink">Monty Python</a></em>, <em><a href="Fawlty_Towers" title="wikilink">Fawlty Towers</a></em>, and <em><a href="The_Young_Ones_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">The Young Ones</a></em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> as particular favourites. Horror movies are another interest of Bush's and have influenced the <a href="gothic_rock" title="wikilink">gothic</a> nature of several of her songs, such as "Hounds of Love", inspired by the 1957 horror movie <em><a href="Night_of_the_Demon" title="wikilink">Night of the Demon</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in "Coffee Homeground", an alcoholic mother in "Ran Tan Waltz" and the upbeat "The Wedding List", a song inspired by <a href="François_Truffaut" title="wikilink">François Truffaut</a>'s 1967 film of <a href="Cornell_Woolrich" title="wikilink">Cornell Woolrich</a>'s <em><a href="The_Bride_Wore_Black" title="wikilink">The Bride Wore Black</a></em> about the death of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn131" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>The length of time between album releases has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn139" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In the past, stories of weight gain or mental instability have been disproved by Bush's periodic reappearance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn140" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> In 2011 Bush told <a href="BBC_Radio_4" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 4</a> that the amount of time between album releases is extremely stressful noting: "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do ... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them." In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: "I think it's important that things are flawed ... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise," and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="live-performances">Live performances</h2>

<p>Bush's only tour took place 2 April – 13 May 1979; 35 years later she embarked on a series of 22 concerts at the <a href="Hammersmith_Apollo" title="wikilink">Hammersmith Apollo</a>, beginning 26 August 2014. Apart from these two concert series, she has only given occasional live performances. Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a rumour of a crippling fear of flying,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn142" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Duffield, her lighting engineer, was killed in an accident during her concert of 2 April 1979 at Poole Arts Centre.

Duffield would be honoured in two later songs: "Blow Away" on <em>Never for Ever</em> and "Moments of Pleasure" on <em>The Red Shoes</em>. Bush explained in a <a href="BBC_Radio_2" title="wikilink">BBC Radio 2</a> interview with <a href="Mark_Radcliffe" title="wikilink">Mark Radcliffe</a> that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour which was shown on the BBC Nationwide program as a 30-minute special.</p>

<p>During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances around the world, including <em><a href="Top_of_the_Pops" title="wikilink">Top of the Pops</a></em> in the United Kingdom, <em>Bios Bahnhof</em> in Germany, and <em><a href="Saturday_Night_Live" title="wikilink">Saturday Night Live</a></em> in the United States (with <a href="Paul_Shaffer" title="wikilink">Paul Shaffer</a> on piano).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the <em>Kate Bush Christmas Special</em>.

<p>After the Tour of Life, Bush desired to make two more albums before touring again. At that point, she got involved with production techniques and sound experimentation that took up a lot of time and prevented her from touring. She came close to touring again following the release of <em>The Dreaming</em> and <em>The Red Shoes</em>, but live shows never materialised.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn147" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of <a href="The_Prince's_Trust" title="wikilink">The Prince's Trust</a> alongside artists such as <a href="Madness_(band)" title="wikilink">Madness</a>, <a href="Midge_Ure" title="wikilink">Midge Ure</a>, <a href="Phil_Collins" title="wikilink">Phil Collins</a>, <a href="Mick_Karn" title="wikilink">Mick Karn</a> and <a href="Pete_Townshend" title="wikilink">Pete Townshend</a>.

<p>In 1978 Bush made her debut on Dutch television in "De Efteling Special", which was broadcast on 11 May 1978. The amusement park De Efteling served as a backdrop for six songs from <em>The Kick Inside</em>: "Moving", "Wuthering Heights", "Them Heavy People", "Strange Phenomena", "The Man With The Child In His Eyes" and "The Kick Inside". Why the Efteling Special? Early 1978 the amusement parks Haunted Castle was completed and the opening was scheduled on 10 May that year. Bush, who just had a big hit in the Netherlands with "Wuthering Heights", made her debut on Dutch television in this special.
