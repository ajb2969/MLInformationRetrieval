<p><strong>Fusion power</strong> is the generation of <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> by <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a>. Fusion reactions are high energy reactions in which two lighter <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">atomic nuclei</a> fuse to form a heavier nucleus. When they combine, some of the mass is lost. This is converted into energy through <a href="Mass–energy_equivalence" title="wikilink">

</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fusion power is a research effort to try and harness this energy to power large scale <a href="Sustainable_energy" title="wikilink">cleaner energy</a>. It is also a major part of <a href="plasma_physics" title="wikilink">plasma physics</a> research.</p>

<p>In large scale commercial proposals, <a class="uri" href="heat" title="wikilink">heat</a> from the fusion reaction is used to operate a <a href="steam_turbine" title="wikilink">steam turbine</a> that drives <a href="electrical_generator" title="wikilink">electrical generators</a>, as in existing <a href="fossil_fuel" title="wikilink">fossil fuel</a> and <a href="fission_power" title="wikilink">nuclear fission</a> <a href="power_station" title="wikilink">power stations</a>. Many different fusion concepts have come in and out of vogue over the years. The current leading designs are the <a class="uri" href="tokamak" title="wikilink">tokamak</a> and <a href="inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">inertial confinement fusion</a> (<a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a>) approaches. These technologies are not yet commercially viable. Currently, it takes more energy to initiate and contain a fusion reaction, than the energy it produces.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Binding energy for different atoms. Iron-56 has the highest, making it the most stable. Atoms to the left are likely to fuse; atoms to the right are likely to split.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h3>

<p>Fusion reactions occur when two (or more) atomic nuclei come close enough for the <a href="strong_interaction" title="wikilink">strong nuclear force</a> pulling them together to exceed the <a href="electrostatic_force" title="wikilink">electrostatic force</a> pushing them apart. This process takes light nuclei and forms a heavier one, through a nuclear reaction. For nuclei lighter than iron-56 this is <a class="uri" href="exothermic" title="wikilink">exothermic</a> and releases energy. For nuclei heavier than iron-56 this is <a class="uri" href="endothermic" title="wikilink">endothermic</a> and requires an external source of energy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 are more likely to fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.</p>

<p>To fuse, nuclei must be brought close enough together for the strong force to act, which occurs only at very short distances. The electrostatic force keeping them apart acts over long distances, so a significant amount of <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> is needed to overcome this "<a href="Coulomb_barrier" title="wikilink">Coulomb barrier</a>" before the reaction can take place. There are several ways of doing this, including speeding up atoms in a <a href="particle_accelerator" title="wikilink">particle accelerator</a>, or more commonly, heating them to very high temperatures.</p>

<p>Once an atom is heated above its <a class="uri" href="ionization" title="wikilink">ionization</a> energy, its <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> are stripped away, leaving just the bare nucleus: the <a class="uri" href="ion" title="wikilink">ion</a>. The result is a hot cloud of ions and the electrons formerly attached to them. This cloud is known as a <a href="plasma_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasma</a>. Because the charges are separated, plasmas are electrically conductive and magnetically controllable. Many fusion devices take advantage of this to control the particles as they are being heated.</p>

<p>Theoretically, any atom could be fused, if enough pressure and temperature was applied,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and studies have been made of the required conditions to create fusion conditions for a range of atoms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> For a power plant, however, we are currently limited to only the lightest elements. <a class="uri" href="Hydrogen" title="wikilink">Hydrogen</a> is ideal: because of its small charge, it is the easiest atom to fuse. This reaction produces <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cross-section">Cross section</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The deuterium-tritium fusion rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70 keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A reaction's <a href="cross_section_(physics)" title="wikilink">cross section</a>, denoted σ, is the measure of how likely a fusion reaction will happen. It is a probability, and it depends on the velocity of the two nuclei when they strike one another. If the atoms move faster, fusion is more likely. If the atoms hit head on, fusion is more likely. Cross sections for many different fusion reactions were measured mainly in the 1970s using particle beams.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A beam of ions of material A was fired at material B at different speeds, and the amount of neutrons coming off was measured. Neutrons are a key product of most fusion reactions.</p>

<p>In most cases, the nuclei are flying around in a hot cloud, with some distribution of velocities. If the plasma is thermalized, then the distribution looks like a <a href="Gaussian_function" title="wikilink">bell curve</a>, or maxwellian distribution. In this case, it is useful to take the average cross section over the velocity distribution. This is entered into the volumetric fusion rate:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="lawson-criterion">Lawson criterion</h3>

<p>This equation shows that energy varies with the temperature, density, speed of collision, and fuel used. This equation was central to John Lawsons' analysis of fusion power plants working with a hot plasma. Lawson assumed an <a href="First_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">energy balance</a>, shown below.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Net Power = Efficiency *(Fusion - Radiation Loss - Conduction Loss)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Net Power</strong> is the net power for any fusion power plant.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> how much energy is needed to drive the device and how well it collects power.</li>
<li><strong>Fusion</strong> is rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions.</li>
<li><strong>Radiation</strong> is the energy lost as light, leaving the plasma.</li>
<li><strong>Conduction</strong> is the energy lost, as mass leaves the plasma.</li>
</ol>

<p>Plasma clouds lose energy through <a href="Thermal_conduction" title="wikilink">conduction</a> and <a class="uri" href="radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Conduction is when <a href="ion" title="wikilink">ions</a>, <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> or <a href="neutral_particle" title="wikilink">neutrals</a> hit a surface and transfer a portion of their kinetic energy to the atoms of the surface. Radiation is when energy leaves the cloud as light. This can be in the visible, UV, IR or X-Ray light. Radiation increases as the temperature rises. To get net power from fusion, you must overcome these losses.</p>

<h3 id="plasma-behavior">Plasma behavior</h3>

<p>Plasma can be made by fully ionizing a gas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Plasma is a fluid which conducts electricity. In bulk, it is modeled using <a href="Magnetohydrodynamic" title="wikilink">Magnetohydrodynamics</a> which is a combination of the <a class="uri" href="Navier-Stokes" title="wikilink">Navier-Stokes</a> equations governing fluids and <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> governing how magnetic and electric fields behave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Fusion exploits several plasma properties, including:</p>

<p><strong>Self-Organization</strong> Plasma conducts electric and magnetic fields. This means that it can self-organize. Its motions can generate fields which can, in turn, self-contain it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="Diamagnetism" title="wikilink">Diamagnetic Plasma</a></strong> Plasma can generate its own internal magnetic field. This can reject an externally applied magnetic field, making it diagmagnetic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="energy-capture">Energy capture</h3>

<p>There are several proposals for energy capture. The simplest is using a <a href="heat_cycle" title="wikilink">heat cycle</a> to heat a fluid with fusion reactions. It has been proposed to use the neutrons generated by fusion to re-generate a spent fission fuel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> In addition, <a href="direct_energy_conversion" title="wikilink">direct energy conversion</a>, has been developed (at <a class="uri" href="LLNL" title="wikilink">LLNL</a> in the 1980s) as a method to maintain a voltage using the products of a fusion reaction.

<h3 id="magnetic-confinement-fusion">Magnetic confinement fusion</h3>

<p><strong><a class="uri" href="Tokamak" title="wikilink">Tokamak</a></strong> The most well developed and well funded approach to fusion energy. As of April 2012 there were an estimated 215 tokamaks either planned, decommissioned or currently operating (35 tokamaks), worldwide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> This method races hot plasma around in a magnetically confined ring, with an internal current.

<p><strong><a class="uri" href="Stellarator" title="wikilink">Stellarator</a></strong> These are twisted rings of hot plasma. The stellarator attempts to create a natural twist plasma path, using external magnets; while Tokamaks create those magnetic fields using an internal current. Stellarators were developed by <a href="Lyman_Spitzer" title="wikilink">Lyman Spitzer</a> in 1950 and have four designs: Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac and Helias.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Levitated_dipole" title="wikilink">Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX)</a></strong> These use a solid superconducting torus. This is magnetically levitated inside the reactor chamber. The superconductor forms an axisymmetric magnetic field that contains the plasma.

<p><strong><a href="Inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">Direct drive</a></strong> In this technique, lasers directly blast a pellet of fuel. The goal is to start ignition, a fusion chain reaction. Ignition was first suggested by John Nuckolls, in 1972.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Notable direct drive experiments have been conducted at the <a href="Laboratory_for_Laser_Energetics" title="wikilink">Laboratory for Laser Energetics</a>, <a href="Laser_Mégajoule" title="wikilink">Laser Mégajoule</a> and the <a href="GEKKO_XII" title="wikilink">GEKKO XII</a> facilities. Good implosions require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate an symmetrical inward <a href="shock_wave" title="wikilink">shock wave</a> and to produce the high-density plasma.</p>

<p><strong>Fast ignition</strong> This method uses two laser blasts. The first blast compresses the fusion fuel, while the second high energy pulse ignites it. Experiments have been conducted at the <a href="Laboratory_for_Laser_Energetics" title="wikilink">Laboratory for Laser Energetics</a> using the Omega and Omega EP systems and at the GEKKO XII laser at the institute for laser engineering in Osaka Japan.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">Indirect drive</a></strong> In this technique, lasers blasts a structure around the pellet of fuel.

<h3 id="heating">Heating</h3>

<p>Gas must be first heated to form a plasma. This then needs to be hot enough to start fusion reactions. A number of heating schemes have been explored:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="Dielectric_heating" title="wikilink">Radiofrequency Heating</a></strong> A radio wave is applied to the plasma, causing it to oscillate. This is basically the same concept as a <a href="microwave_oven" title="wikilink">microwave oven</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="Thomson_Scattering" title="wikilink">Thomson Scattering</a></strong> Certain wavelengths of light will scatter off a plasma.

In ICF systems, this can be done by firing a second beam into a gold foil adjacent to the target. This makes x-rays that scatter or traverse the plasma.

<p><strong><a href="Langmuir_probe" title="wikilink">Langmuir probe</a></strong> This is a metal object placed in a plasma.

<p><strong>Flux Loop</strong> A loop of wire is inserted into the magnetic field. As the field passes through the loop, a current is made.

<p><strong><a href="Steam_turbine" title="wikilink">Steam turbines</a></strong> It has been proposed <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> that steam turbines be used to convert the heat from the fusion chamber into electricity.

<p>Confinement refers to all the conditions necessary to keep a plasma dense and hot long enough to undergo fusion. Here are some general principles.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Mechanical_equilibrium" title="wikilink">Equilibrium</a>: The forces acting on the plasma must be balanced for containment. One exception is <a href="inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">inertial confinement</a>, where the relevant physics must occur faster than the disassembly time.</li>
<li><a href="Plasma_stability" title="wikilink">Stability</a>: The plasma must be so constructed so that disturbances will not lead to the plasma disassembling.</li>
<li>Transport or <a href="conduction_(heat)" title="wikilink">conduction</a>: The loss of material must be sufficiently slow.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> The plasma carries off energy with it, so rapid loss of material will disrupt any machines power balance. Material can be lost by transport into different regions or <a href="conduction_(heat)" title="wikilink">conduction</a> through a solid or liquid.</li>
</ul>

<p>To produce self-sustaining fusion, the energy released by the reaction (or at least a fraction of it) must be used to heat new reactant nuclei and keep them hot long enough that they also undergo fusion reactions.</p>
<h3 id="unconfined">Unconfined</h3>

<p>The first human-made, large-scale fusion reaction was the test of the <a href="hydrogen_bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bomb</a>, <a href="Ivy_Mike" title="wikilink">Ivy Mike</a>, in 1952. As part of the <a href="PACER_(fusion)" title="wikilink">PACER</a> project, it was once proposed to use hydrogen bombs as a source of power by detonating them in underground caverns and then generating electricity from the heat produced, but such a power plant is unlikely ever to be constructed.</p>
<h3 id="magnetic-confinement">Magnetic confinement</h3>

<p>At the temperatures required for fusion, the fuel is heated to a plasma state. In this state it has a very good <a href="electrical_conductivity" title="wikilink">electrical conductivity</a>. This opens the possibility of confining the plasma with <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic fields</a>. This is the case of magnetized plasma, where the magnetic fields and plasma intermix. This is generally known as <a href="magnetic_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">magnetic confinement</a>. The field lines put a <a href="Lorentz_force" title="wikilink">Lorentz force</a> on the plasma. The force works perpendicular to the magnetic fields, so one problem in magnetic confinement is preventing the plasma from leaking out the ends of the field lines. A general measure of magnetic trapping in fusion is the beta ratio:</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Magnetic Mirror</strong> One example of magnetic confinement is with the <a href="magnetic_mirror" title="wikilink">magnetic mirror</a> effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which was a series of large, expensive devices built at the <a href="Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> from the 1960s to mid 1980s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and <a href="Biconic_cusp" title="wikilink">Biconic cusp</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors would easier to construct and maintain and second <a href="Direct_energy_conversion" title="wikilink">direct conversion</a> energy capture, was easier to implement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.</p>

<p><strong>Magnetic Loops</strong> Another example of magnetic confinement is to bend the field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested <a href="torus" title="wikilink">toroidal</a> surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the <em><a class="uri" href="tokamak" title="wikilink">tokamak</a></em>, with the <em><a class="uri" href="stellarator" title="wikilink">stellarator</a></em> being next most advanced, followed by the <a href="Reversed_field_pinch" title="wikilink">Reversed field pinch</a>. <a href="Compact_toroid" title="wikilink">Compact toroids</a>, especially the <em><a href="Field-Reversed_Configuration" title="wikilink">Field-Reversed Configuration</a></em> and the <a class="uri" href="spheromak" title="wikilink">spheromak</a>, attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a <a href="simply_connected_space" title="wikilink">simply connected</a> (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.</p>
<h3 id="inertial-confinement">Inertial confinement</h3>

<p><a href="inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">Inertial confinement</a> is the use of rapidly imploding shell to heat and confine plasma. The shell is imploded using a direct laser blast (direct drive) or a secondary x-ray blast (indirect drive) or heavy ion beams. Theoretically, fusion using lasers would be done using tiny pellets of fuel that explode several times a second. To induce the explosion, the pellet must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams. If direct drive is used - the beams are focused directly on the pellet - it can in principle be very efficient, but in practice is difficult to obtain the needed uniformity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The alternative approach, indirect drive, uses beams to heat a shell, and then the shell radiates <a class="uri" href="x-rays" title="wikilink">x-rays</a>, which then implode the pellet. The beams are commonly laser beams, but heavy and light <a href="ion_beam" title="wikilink">ion beams</a> and electron beams have all been investigated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="electrostatic-confinement">Electrostatic confinement</h3>

<p>There are also <a href="Inertial_electrostatic_confinement" title="wikilink">electrostatic confinement fusion</a> devices. These devices confine <a href="ion" title="wikilink">ions</a> using electrostatic fields. The best known is the <a class="uri" href="Fusor" title="wikilink">Fusor</a>. This device has an cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high <a href="conduction_(heat)" title="wikilink">conduction</a> losses. Also, fusion rates in <a href="fusor" title="wikilink">fusors</a> are very low due to competing physical effects, such as energy loss in the form of light radiation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> a <a href="penning_trap" title="wikilink">penning trap</a> and the <a class="uri" href="polywell" title="wikilink">polywell</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-research">History of research</h2>
<h3 id="s">1920s</h3>

<p>Research into nuclear fusion started in the early part of the 20th century. In 1920 the British physicist <a href="Francis_William_Aston" title="wikilink">Francis William Aston</a> discovered that the total mass equivalent of four <a href="hydrogen_atom" title="wikilink">hydrogen atoms</a> (two protons and two neutrons) are heavier than the total mass of one <a href="helium_atom" title="wikilink">helium atom</a> (<a href="Helium-4" title="wikilink">He-4</a>), which implied that net energy can be released by combining hydrogen atoms together to form helium, and provided the first hints of a mechanism by which stars could produce energy in the quantities being measured. Through the 1920s, <a href="Arthur_Stanley_Eddington" title="wikilink">Arthur Stanley Eddington</a> became a major proponent of the <a href="proton–proton_chain_reaction" title="wikilink">proton–proton chain reaction</a> (PP reaction) as the primary system running the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s-1">1930s</h3>

<p>A theory was verified by <a href="Hans_Bethe" title="wikilink">Hans Bethe</a> in 1939 showing that <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> and <a href="quantum_tunneling" title="wikilink">quantum tunneling</a> in the <a href="solar_core" title="wikilink">Sun's core</a> might convert one of the protons into a <a class="uri" href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutron</a> and thereby producing <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> rather than a diproton. The deuterium would then fuse through other reactions to further increase the energy output. For this work, Bethe won the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s-2">1940s</h3>

<p>In 1942, nuclear fusion research was subsumed into the <a href="Manhattan_Project" title="wikilink">Manhattan Project</a> and the science became obscured by the <a class="uri" href="secrecy" title="wikilink">secrecy</a> surrounding the field. The first patent related to a fusion reactor was registered in 1946<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> by the <a href="United_Kingdom_Atomic_Energy_Authority" title="wikilink">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a>, the inventors being <a href="George_Paget_Thomson" title="wikilink">Sir George Paget Thomson</a> and <a href="Moses_Blackman" title="wikilink">Moses Blackman</a>. This was the first detailed examination of the <a class="uri" href="Z-pinch" title="wikilink">Z-pinch</a> concept.</p>

<p>Z-pinch is based on the fact that plasmas are electrically conducting. By running a current through the plasma, a magnetic field will be generated around the plasma. This field will, according to <a href="Lenz's_law" title="wikilink">Lenz's law</a>, create an inward directed force that causes the plasma to collapse inward, raising its density. Denser plasmas generate denser magnetic fields, increasing the inward force, leading to a <a href="chain_reaction" title="wikilink">chain reaction</a>. If the conditions are correct, this can lead to the densities and temperatures needed for fusion. The difficulty is getting the current into the plasma, which would normally melt any sort of mechanical <a class="uri" href="electrode" title="wikilink">electrode</a>. A solution emerges again due to the conducting nature of the plasma; by placing the plasma in the middle of an <a class="uri" href="electromagnet" title="wikilink">electromagnet</a>, <a href="Electromagnetic_induction" title="wikilink">induction</a> can be used to generate the current.</p>

<p>Starting in 1947, small experiments were carried out by two UK teams, who began building a series of ever-larger experiments. When the Huemul results hit the news (see below), <a href="James_L._Tuck" title="wikilink">James L. Tuck</a>, a UK physicist working at Los Alamos, introduced the pinch concept in the US and produced a series of machines known as the <a class="uri" href="Perhapsatron" title="wikilink">Perhapsatron</a>. In the Soviet Union, unbeknownst to the west, a series of similar machines were being built. All of these devices quickly demonstrated a series of instabilities when the pinch was applied, which broke up the plasma column long before it reached the densities and temperatures required for fusion.</p>
<h3 id="s-3">1950s</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>The <strong>first successful man-made fusion device</strong> was the <a href="boosted_fission_weapon" title="wikilink">boosted fission weapon</a> tested in 1951 in the <a href="Greenhouse_Item" title="wikilink">Greenhouse Item</a> test. This was followed by true fusion weapons in 1952's <a href="Ivy_Mike" title="wikilink">Ivy Mike</a>, and the first practical examples in 1954's <a href="Castle_Bravo" title="wikilink">Castle Bravo</a>. This was uncontrolled fusion. In these devices, the energy released by the fission explosion is used to compress and heat fusion fuel, starting a fusion reaction. Fusion releases <a href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutrons</a>. These <a href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutrons</a> hit the surrounding fission fuel, causing the atoms to split apart much faster than normal fission processes - almost instantly by comparison. This increases the effectiveness of bombs: normal fission weapons blow themselves apart before all their fuel is used; fusion/fission weapons do not have this practical upper limit.</p>

<p>In 1949 an expatriate German, <a href="Ronald_Richter" title="wikilink">Ronald Richter</a>, proposed the <a href="Huemul_Project" title="wikilink">Huemul Project</a> in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. These turned out to be fake, but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole. In particular, it prompted <a href="Lyman_Spitzer" title="wikilink">Lyman Spitzer</a> to begin considering ways to solve some of the more obvious problems involved in confining a hot plasma, and, unaware of the z-pinch efforts, he developed a new solution to the problem known as the <a class="uri" href="stellerator" title="wikilink">stellerator</a>. Spitzer applied to the US <a href="United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a> for funding to build a test device. During this period, <a href="James_L._Tuck" title="wikilink">Jim Tuck</a> who had worked with the UK teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> (LANL). When he heard of Spitzer's pitch for funding, he applied to build a machine of his own, the <a class="uri" href="Perhapsatron" title="wikilink">Perhapsatron</a>.</p>

<p>Spitzer's idea won funding and he began work on the stellarator under the code name Project Matterhorn. His work led to the creation of the <a href="Princeton_Plasma_Physics_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory</a>. Tuck returned to LANL and arranged local funding to build his machine. By this time, however, it was clear that all of the pinch machines were suffering from the same issues involving stability, and progress stalled. In 1953, Tuck and others suggested a number of solutions to the stability problems. This led to the design of a second series of pinch machines, led by the UK <a href="ZETA_(fusion_reactor)" title="wikilink">ZETA</a> and <a href="Sceptre_(fusion_reactor)" title="wikilink">Sceptre</a> devices.</p>

<p>Spitzer had planned an aggressive development project of four machines, A, B, C, and D. A and B were small research devices, C would be the prototype of a power-producing machine, and D would be the prototype of a commercial device. A worked without issue, but even by the time B was being used it was clear the stellarator was also suffering from instabilities and plasma leakage. Progress on C slowed as attempts were made to correct for these problems.</p>

<p>By the mid-1950s it was clear that the simple theoretical tools being used to calculate the performance of all fusion machines were simply not predicting their actual behavior. Machines invariably leaked their plasma from their confinement area at rates far higher than predicted. In 1954, <a href="Edward_Teller" title="wikilink">Edward Teller</a> held a gathering of fusion researchers at the Princeton Gun Club, near the Project Matterhorn (now known as <a href="Project_Sherwood" title="wikilink">Project Sherwood</a>) grounds. Teller started by pointing out the problems that everyone was having, and suggested that any system where the plasma was confined within concave fields was doomed to fail. Attendees remember him saying something to the effect that the fields were like rubber bands, and they would attempt to snap back to a straight configuration whenever the power was increased, ejecting the plasma. He went on to say that it appeared the only way to confine the plasma in a stable configuration would be to use convex fields, a "cusp" configuration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>When the meeting concluded, most of the researchers quickly turned out papers saying why Teller's concerns did not apply to their particular device. The pinch machines did not use magnetic fields in this way at all, while the mirror and stellarator seemed to have various ways out. This was soon followed by a paper by <a href="Martin_David_Kruskal" title="wikilink">Martin David Kruskal</a> and <a href="Martin_Schwarzschild" title="wikilink">Martin Schwarzschild</a> discussing pinch machines, however, which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design.</p>

<p>The largest "classic" pinch device was the <a href="ZETA_(fusion_reactor)" title="wikilink">ZETA</a>, including all of these suggested upgrades, starting operations in the UK in 1957. In early 1958, <a href="John_Cockcroft" title="wikilink">John Cockcroft</a> announced that fusion had been achieved in the ZETA, an announcement that made headlines around the world. When physicists in the US expressed concerns about the claims they were initially dismissed. US experiments soon demonstrated the same neutrons, although temperature measurements suggested these could not be from fusion reactions. The neutrons seen in the UK were later demonstrated to be from different versions of the same instability processes that plagued earlier machines. Cockcroft was forced to retract the fusion claims, and the entire field was tainted for years. ZETA ended its experiments in 1968.</p>

<p>The <strong>first controlled fusion experiment</strong> was accomplished using Scylla I at the <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in 1958. This was a pinch machine, with a cylinder full of deuterium. Electric current shot down the sides of the cylinder. The current made magnetic fields that compressed the plasma to 15 million degrees Celsius, squeezed the gas, fused it and produced neutrons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1950–1951 <a href="Igor_Tamm" title="wikilink">I.E. Tamm</a> and <a href="Andrei_Sakharov" title="wikilink">A.D. Sakharov</a> in the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a>, first discussed a <a class="uri" href="tokamak" title="wikilink">tokamak</a>-like approach. Experimental research on those designs began in 1956 at the <a href="Kurchatov_Institute" title="wikilink">Kurchatov Institute</a> in <a class="uri" href="Moscow" title="wikilink">Moscow</a> by a group of Soviet scientists led by <a href="Lev_Artsimovich" title="wikilink">Lev Artsimovich</a>. The tokamak essentially combined a low-power pinch device with a low-power simple stellarator. The key was to combine the fields in such a way that the particles orbited within the reactor a particular number of times, today known as the "<a href="Safety_factor_(plasma_physics)" title="wikilink">safety factor</a>". The combination of these fields dramatically improved confinement times and densities, resulting in huge improvements over existing devices.</p>
<h3 id="s-4">1960s</h3>

<p>A key plasma physics text was published by <a href="Lyman_Spitzer" title="wikilink">Lyman Spitzer</a> at Princeton in 1963.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Spitzer took the ideal gas laws and adopted them to an ionized plasma, developing many of the fundamental equations used to model a plasma.</p>

<p>Laser fusion was suggested in 1962 by scientists at <a href="Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, shortly after the invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. Laser fusion, formally known as <a href="inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">inertial confinement fusion</a>, involves <a href="Implosion_(mechanical_process)" title="wikilink">imploding</a> a target by using <a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a> beams. There are two ways to do this: indirect drive and direct drive. In direct drive, the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes <a class="uri" href="x-rays" title="wikilink">x-rays</a> that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.</p>

<p>At the <a href="1964_World's_Fair" title="wikilink">1964 World's Fair</a>, the public was given its first demonstration of nuclear fusion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> The device was a θ-pinch from General Electric. This was similar to the Scylla machine developed earlier at Los Alamos.</p>

<p>The <a href="magnetic_mirror" title="wikilink">magnetic mirror</a> was first published in 1967 by <a href="Richard_F._Post" title="wikilink">Richard F. Post</a> and many others at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The mirror consisted of two large magnets arranged so they had strong fields within them, and a weaker, but connected, field between them. Plasma introduced in the area between the two magnets would "bounce back" from the stronger fields in the middle.</p>

<p>The <a href="Andrei_Sakharov" title="wikilink">A.D. Sakharov</a> group constructed the first tokamaks, the most successful being the <a href="T-3_(tokamak)" title="wikilink">T-3</a> and its larger version <a href="T-4_(tokamak)" title="wikilink">T-4</a>. T-4 was tested in 1968 in <a class="uri" href="Novosibirsk" title="wikilink">Novosibirsk</a>, producing the world's first quasistationary fusion reaction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> When this were first announced, the international community was highly skeptical. A British team was invited to see T-3, however, and after measuring it in depth they released their results that confirmed the Soviet claims. A burst of activity followed as many planned devices were abandoned and new tokamaks were introduced in their place — the C model stellarator, then under construction after many redesigns, was quickly converted to the Symmetrical Tokamak.</p>

<p>In his work with vacuum tubes, <a href="Philo_Farnsworth" title="wikilink">Philo Farnsworth</a> observed that electric charge would accumulate in regions of the tube. Today, this effect is known as the <a href="Multipactor_effect" title="wikilink">Multipactor effect</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Farnsworth reasoned that if ions were concentrated high enough they could collide and fuse. In 1962, he filed a patent on a design using a positive inner cage to concentrate plasma, in order to achieve nuclear fusion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> During this time, <a href="Robert_L._Hirsch" title="wikilink">Robert L. Hirsch</a> joined the Farnsworth Television labs and began work on what became the fusor. Hirsch patented the design in 1966<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> and published the design in 1967.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="s-5">1970s</h3>

<p></p>

<p>In 1972, John Nuckolls outlined the idea of ignition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> This is a fusion chain reaction. Hot helium made during fusion reheats the fuel and starts more reactions. John argued that ignition would require lasers of about 1 kJ. This turned out to be wrong. Nuckolls's paper started a major development effort. Several laser systems were built at LLNL. These included the <a href="Argus_laser" title="wikilink">argus</a>, the <a href="Cyclops_laser" title="wikilink">Cyclops</a>, the <a href="Janus_laser" title="wikilink">Janus</a>, the <a href="Long_path_laser" title="wikilink">long path</a>, the <a href="Shiva_laser" title="wikilink">Shiva laser</a> and the <a href="Nova_(laser)" title="wikilink">Nova</a> in 1984. This prompted the UK to build the <a href="Central_Laser_Facility" title="wikilink">Central Laser Facility</a> in 1976.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>During this time, great strides in understanding the tokamak system were made. A number of improvements to the design are now part of the "advanced tokamak" concept, which includes non-circular plasma, internal diverters and limiters, often superconducting magnets, and operate in the so-called "H-mode" island of increased stability. Two other designs have also become fairly well studied; the compact tokamak is wired with the magnets on the inside of the vacuum chamber, while the <a href="spherical_tokamak" title="wikilink">spherical tokamak</a> reduces its cross section as much as possible.</p>

<p>In 1974 a study of the ZETA results demonstrated an interesting side-effect; after an experimental run ended, the plasma would enter a short period of stability. This led to the <a href="reversed_field_pinch" title="wikilink">reversed field pinch</a> concept, which has seen some level of development since. On May 1, 1974, the KMS fusion company (founded by <a href="Kip_Siegel" title="wikilink">Kip Siegel</a>) achieves <strong>the world's first laser induced fusion in a deuterium-tritium pellet</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p>In the mid-1970s, <a href="Project_PACER" title="wikilink">Project PACER</a>, carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small <a href="H-bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bombs</a> (fusion bombs) inside an underground cavity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. It would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, however, making the economics of such a system rather questionable.</p>

<p>In 1976, the two beam <a href="Argus_laser" title="wikilink">Argus laser</a> becomes operational at livermore. In 1977, The 20 beam <a href="Shiva_laser" title="wikilink">Shiva laser</a> at Livermore is completed, capable of delivering 10.2 kilojoules of infrared energy on target. At a price of $25 million and a size approaching that of a football field, Shiva is the first of the megalasers . That same year, the <a href="Joint_European_Torus" title="wikilink">JET</a> project is approved by the <a href="European_Commission" title="wikilink">European Commission</a> and a site is selected.</p>
<h3 id="s-6">1980s</h3>

<p>As a result of advocacy, the cold war, and the <a href="1970s_energy_crisis" title="wikilink">1970s energy crisis</a> a massive <a href="magnetic_mirror" title="wikilink">magnetic mirror</a> program was funded by the US federal government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This program resulted in a series of large magnetic mirror devices including: 2X,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Baseball I, Baseball II, the <a href="Tandem_Mirror_Experiment" title="wikilink">Tandem Mirror Experiment</a>, the Tandem mirror experiment upgrade, the <a href="Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility" title="wikilink">Mirror Fusion Test Facility</a> and the MFTF-B. These machines were built and tested at Livermore from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> A number of institutions collaborated on these machines, conducting experiments. These included the <a href="Institute_for_Advanced_Study" title="wikilink">Institute for Advanced Study</a> and the <a href="University_of_Wisconsin–Madison" title="wikilink">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>. The last machine, the <a href="Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility" title="wikilink">Mirror Fusion Test Facility</a> cost 372 million dollars and was, at that time, the most expensive project in Livermore history.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down. The reason given was to balance the United States federal budget. This program was supported from within the Carter and early Reagan administrations by <a href="Edwin_E._Kintner" title="wikilink">Edwin E. Kintner</a>, a US Navy captain, under <a href="Alvin_Trivelpiece" title="wikilink">Alvin Trivelpiece</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p>In Laser fusion progressed: in 1983, the <a href="NOVETTE_laser" title="wikilink">NOVETTE laser</a> was completed. The following December 1984, the ten beam <a href="NOVA_laser" title="wikilink">NOVA laser</a> was finished. Five years later, NOVA would produce a maximum of 120 kilojoules of infrared light, during a nanosecond pulse . Meanwhile, efforts focused on either fast delivery or beam smoothness. Both tried to deliver the energy uniformly to implode the target. One early problem was that the light in the <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> wavelength, lost lots of energy before hitting the fuel. Breakthroughs were made at the <a href="Laboratory_for_Laser_Energetics" title="wikilink">Laboratory for Laser Energetics</a> at the <a href="University_of_Rochester" title="wikilink">University of Rochester</a>. Rochester scientists used frequency-tripling crystals to transform the infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams. In 1985, Donna Strickland<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> and <a href="Gérard_Mourou" title="wikilink">Gérard Mourou</a> invented a method to amplify lasers pulses by "chirping". This method changes a single wavelength into a full spectrum. The system then amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color. Chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the National Ignition Facility and the Omega EP system. Most research into ICF was towards weapons research, because the implosion is relevant to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>During this time <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> constructed a series of laser facilities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> This included Gemini (a two beam system), Helios (eight beams), Antares (24 beams) and Aurora (96 beams).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The program ended in the early nineties with a cost on the order of one billion dollars.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1987, Akira Hasegawa <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> noticed that in a dipolar magnetic field, fluctuations tended compress the plasma without energy loss. This effect was noticed in data taken by <a href="Voyager_2" title="wikilink">Voyager 2</a>, when it encountered Uranus. This observation would become the basis for a fusion approach known as the <a href="Levitated_dipole" title="wikilink">Levitated dipole</a>.</p>

<p>In Tokamaks, the <a href="Tore_Supra" title="wikilink">Tore Supra</a> was under construction over the middle of the eighties (1983 to 1988). This was a <a class="uri" href="Tokamak" title="wikilink">Tokamak</a> built in <a class="uri" href="Cadarache" title="wikilink">Cadarache</a>, France.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> In 1983, the <a href="Joint_European_Torus" title="wikilink">JET</a> was completed and first plasmas achieved. In 1985, the Japanese tokamak, <a class="uri" href="JT-60" title="wikilink">JT-60</a> was completed. In 1988, the <a href="T-15_(reactor)" title="wikilink">T-15</a> a Soviet tokamak was completed. It was the first industrial fusion reactor to use <a class="uri" href="superconducting" title="wikilink">superconducting</a> magnets to control the plasma. These were Helium cooled.</p>

<p>In 1989, Pons and Fleischmann submitted papers to the <em>Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry</em> claiming that they had observed fusion in a room temperature device and disclosing their work in a press release.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Some scientists reported excess heat, neutrons, tritium, helium and other nuclear effects in so-called <a href="cold_fusion" title="wikilink">cold fusion</a> systems, which for a time gained interest as showing promise. Hopes fell when replication failures were weighed in view of several reasons cold fusion is not likely to occur, the discovery of possible sources of experimental error, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and cold fusion subsequently gained a reputation as <a href="pathological_science" title="wikilink">pathological science</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> However, a small community of researchers continues to investigate cold fusion<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> claiming to replicate Fleishmann and Pons' results including nuclear reaction byproducts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Claims related to cold fusion are largely disbelieved in the mainstream scientific community.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> In 1989, the majority of a review panel organized by the <a href="US_Department_of_Energy" title="wikilink">US Department of Energy</a> (DOE) found that the evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process was not persuasive. A second DOE review, convened in 2004 to look at new research, reached conclusions similar to the first.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL proposed<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> an alternate arrangement of the magnet coils that would greatly reduce the aspect ratio while avoiding the erosion issues of the compact tokamak: a <a href="Spherical_tokamak" title="wikilink">Spherical tokamak</a>. Instead of wiring each magnet coil separately, he proposed using a single large conductor in the center, and wiring the magnets as half-rings off of this conductor. What was once a series of individual rings passing through the hole in the center of the reactor was reduced to a single post, allowing for aspect ratios as low as 1.2.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The ST concept appeared to represent an enormous advance in tokamak design. However, it was being proposed during a period when US fusion research budgets were being dramatically scaled back. ORNL was provided with funds to develop a suitable central column built out of a high-strength copper alloy called "Glidcop". However, they were unable to secure funding to build a demonstration machine, "STX". Failing to build an ST at ORNL, Peng began a worldwide effort to interest other teams in the ST concept and get a test machine built. One way to do this quickly would be to convert a spheromak machine to the <a href="Spherical_tokamak" title="wikilink">Spherical tokamak</a> layout.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Peng's advocacy also caught the interest of <a href="Derek_Robinson_(physicist)" title="wikilink">Derek Robinson</a>, of the <a href="United_Kingdom_Atomic_Energy_Authority" title="wikilink">United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority</a> fusion center at <a class="uri" href="Culham" title="wikilink">Culham</a>.

Several parts of the machine were recycled from earlier projects, while others were loaned from other labs, including a 40 keV neutral beam injector from ORNL. Construction of <a href="Small_Tight_Aspect_Ratio_Tokamak" title="wikilink">START</a> began in 1990, it was assembled rapidly and started operation in January 1991.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1991 the Preliminary Tritium Experiment at the <a href="Joint_European_Torus" title="wikilink">Joint European Torus</a> in England achieved <strong>the world’s first controlled release of fusion power.</strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1992, a major article was published in Physics Today by Robert McCory at the <a href="Laboratory_for_laser_energetics" title="wikilink">Laboratory for laser energetics</a> outlying the current state of ICF and advocating for a national ignition facility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> This was followed up by a major review article, from John Lindl in 1995,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> advocating for <a href="National_Ignition_Facility" title="wikilink">NIF</a>.

<p>A 2012 paper demonstrated that a dense plasma focus had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees C, sufficient for boron fusion, and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained plasmoid, a necessary condition for net power.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn155" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> The focus consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure fusible gas.

<h2 id="fuels">Fuels</h2>

<p>By firing particle beams at targets, many fusion reactions have been tested, while the fuels considered for power have all been light elements like the isotopes of hydrogen—<a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> and <a class="uri" href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritium</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn163" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> Other reactions like the deuterium and Helium<sup>3</sup> reaction or the Helium<sup>3</sup> and Helium<sup>3</sup> reactions, would require a supply of Helium<sup>3</sup>. This can either come from other nuclear reactions or from extraterrestrial sources. Finally, researchers hope to do the p- reaction, because it does not directly produce neutrons, though side reactions can.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn164" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="deuterium-tritium">Deuterium, tritium</h3>

<p> The easiest nuclear reaction, at the lowest energy, is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>+  →  + </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This reaction is common in research, industrial and military applications, usually as a convenient source of neutrons. <a class="uri" href="Deuterium" title="wikilink">Deuterium</a> is a naturally occurring <a class="uri" href="isotope" title="wikilink">isotope</a> of hydrogen and is commonly available. The large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the difficult <a href="uranium_enrichment" title="wikilink">uranium enrichment</a> process. <a class="uri" href="Tritium" title="wikilink">Tritium</a> is a natural isotope of hydrogen, but due to its short <a class="uri" href="half-life" title="wikilink">half-life</a> of 12.32 years, is hard to find, store, produce, and is expensive. Consequently, the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the <a href="breeder_reactor" title="wikilink">breeding</a> of <a class="uri" href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritium</a> from <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a> using one of the following reactions:</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>+  →  + </p>
</dd>
<dd>

<p>+  →  +  + </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction shown above, and the one that has the greatest yield of energy. The reaction with <sup>6</sup>Li is <a href="exothermic_reaction" title="wikilink">exothermic</a>, providing a small energy gain for the reactor. The reaction with <sup>7</sup>Li is <a href="endothermic_reaction" title="wikilink">endothermic</a> but does not consume the neutron. At least some <sup>7</sup>Li reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements. Most reactor designs use the naturally occurring mix of lithium isotopes.</p>

<p>Several drawbacks are commonly attributed to D-T fusion power:</p>
<ol>
<li>It produces substantial amounts of neutrons that result in the <a href="neutron_activation" title="wikilink">neutron activation</a> of the reactor materials.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn165" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a></li>
<li>Only about 20% of the fusion energy yield appears in the form of charged particles with the remainder carried off by neutrons, which limits the extent to which direct energy conversion techniques might be applied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn166" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></li>
<li>It requires the handling of the radioisotope tritium. Similar to hydrogen, tritium is difficult to contain and may leak from reactors in some quantity. Some estimates suggest that this would represent a fairly large environmental release of radioactivity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn167" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></li>
</ol>

<p>The <a href="neutron_flux" title="wikilink">neutron flux</a> expected in a commercial D-T fusion reactor is about 100 times that of current fission power reactors, posing problems for <a href="plasma_facing_material" title="wikilink">material design</a>. After a series of D-T tests at <a href="Joint_European_Torus" title="wikilink">JET</a>, the vacuum vessel was sufficiently radioactive that remote handling was required for the year following the tests.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn168" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a></p>

<p>In a production setting, the neutrons would be used to react with <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a> in order to create more tritium. This also deposits the energy of the neutrons in the lithium, which would then be transferred to drive electrical production. The lithium neutron absorption reaction protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux. Newer designs, the advanced tokamak in particular, also use lithium inside the reactor core as a key element of the design. The plasma interacts directly with the lithium, preventing a problem known as "recycling". The advantage of this design was demonstrated in the <a href="Lithium_Tokamak_Experiment" title="wikilink">Lithium Tokamak Experiment</a>.</p>
<h3 id="deuterium">Deuterium</h3>

<p>This fuel is commonly used by <a href="fusor" title="wikilink">amateurs</a> who fuse. This is second easiest fusion reaction, fusing of deuterium with itself. This reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">
<p>D + D</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">
<p>→ T</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">
<p>+ <sup>1</sup>H</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">
<p>D + D</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">
<p>→ <sup>3</sup>He</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">
<p>+ n</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This reaction is also common in research. The optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15 keV, only slightly higher than the optimum for the D-T reaction. The first branch does not produce neutrons, but it does produce tritium, so that a D-D reactor will not be completely tritium-free, even though it does not require an input of tritium or lithium. Unless the tritons can be quickly removed, most of the tritium produced would be burned before leaving the reactor, which would reduce the handling of tritium, but would produce more neutrons, some of which are very energetic. The neutron from the second branch has an energy of only , whereas the neutron from the D-T reaction has an energy of , resulting in a wider range of isotope production and material damage. When the tritons are removed quickly while allowing the <sup>3</sup>He to react, the fuel cycle is called "tritium suppressed fusion"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> The removed tritium decays to <sup>3</sup>He with a 12.5 year half life. By recycling the <sup>3</sup>He produced from the decay of tritium back into the fusion reactor, the fusion reactor does not require materials resistant to fast  neutrons.</p>

<p>Assuming complete tritium burn-up, the reduction in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other advantages are independence from scarce lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less .</p>

<p>Assuming complete removal of tritium and recycling of <sup>3</sup>He, only 6% of the fusion energy is carried by neutrons. The tritium-suppressed D-D fusion requires an energy confinement that is 10 times longer compared to D-T and a plasma temperature that is twice as high.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="deuterium-helium-3">Deuterium, helium 3</h3>

<p>A second-generation approach to controlled fusion power involves combining <a class="uri" href="helium-3" title="wikilink">helium-3</a> (<sup>3</sup>He) and <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> (<sup>2</sup>H):</p>

<p>This reaction produces a helium-4 nucleus (<sup>4</sup>He) and a high-energy proton. As with the p-<sup>11</sup>B <a href="aneutronic_fusion" title="wikilink">aneutronic fusion</a> fuel cycle, most of the reaction energy is released as charged particles, reducing <a href="neutron_activation" title="wikilink">activation</a> of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient energy harvesting (via any of several speculative technologies). In practice, D-D side reactions produce a significant number of neutrons, resulting in p-<sup>11</sup>B being the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion.</p>
<h3 id="proton-boron-11">Proton, boron 11</h3>

<p>If <a href="aneutronic_fusion" title="wikilink">aneutronic fusion</a> is the goal, then the most promising candidate may be the Hydrogen-1 (proton)/<a class="uri" href="boron" title="wikilink">boron</a> reaction, which releases alpha (helium) particles, but does not rely on <a href="neutron_scattering" title="wikilink">neutron scattering</a> for energy transfer.</p>
<dl>
<dd><sup>1</sup>H + <sup>11</sup>B → 3 <sup>4</sup>He

<p>Under reasonable assumptions, side reactions will result in about 0.1% of the fusion power being carried by neutrons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> At 123 keV, the optimum temperature for this reaction is nearly ten times higher than that for the pure hydrogen reactions, the energy confinement must be 500 times better than that required for the D-T reaction, and the <a href="power_density" title="wikilink">power density</a> will be 2500 times lower than for D-T.</p>

<p>Since the confinement properties of conventional approaches to fusion such as the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal, most proposals for aneutronic fusion are based on radically different confinement concepts, such as the <a class="uri" href="Polywell" title="wikilink">Polywell</a> and the <a href="Dense_Plasma_Focus" title="wikilink">Dense Plasma Focus</a>.

<h2 id="material-selection">Material selection</h2>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>

<p>Any power plant using hot plasma, is going to have plasma facing walls. In even the simplest plasma approaches, the material will get blasted with matter and energy. This leads to a minimum list of considerations, including dealing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A heating and cooling cycle, up to a 10 MW/m² thermal load .</li>
<li><a href="Neutron_radiation" title="wikilink">Neutron radiation</a>, which over time leads to <a href="neutron_activation" title="wikilink">neutron activation</a> and <a class="uri" href="embrittlement" title="wikilink">embrittlement</a>.</li>
<li>High energy ions leaving at tens to hundreds of <a href="electronvolt" title="wikilink">electronvolts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="Alpha_particle" title="wikilink">Alpha particles</a> leaving at millions of <a href="electronvolt" title="wikilink">electronvolts</a>.</li>
<li>Electrons leaving at high energy.</li>
<li>Light radiation (IR, visible, UV, X-ray).</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the approach, these effects may be higher or lower than typical <a href="Nuclear_fission" title="wikilink">fission</a> reactors like the <a href="pressurized_water_reactor" title="wikilink">pressurized water reactor</a> (PWR).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> One estimate put the <a href="neutron_radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a> at 100 times the (PWR). Materials need to be selected or developed that can withstand these basic conditions. Depending on the approach, however, there may be other considerations such as <a href="electrical_conductivity" title="wikilink">electrical conductivity</a>, <a href="Vacuum_permeability" title="wikilink">magnetic permeability</a> and mechanical strength. There is also a need for materials whose primary components and impurities do not result in long-lived radioactive wastes.</p>
<h3 id="durability">Durability</h3>

<p>For long term use, each atom in the wall is expected to be hit by a neutron and displaced about a hundred times before the material is replaced. High-energy neutrons will produce hydrogen and helium by way of various nuclear reactions that tends to form bubbles at grain boundaries and result in swelling, blistering or embrittlement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>

<p>One can choose either a low-<a href="Atomic_number" title="wikilink">Z</a> material, such as <a class="uri" href="graphite" title="wikilink">graphite</a> or <a class="uri" href="beryllium" title="wikilink">beryllium</a>, or a high-<a href="Atomic_number" title="wikilink">Z</a> material, usually <a class="uri" href="tungsten" title="wikilink">tungsten</a> with <a class="uri" href="molybdenum" title="wikilink">molybdenum</a> as a second choice. Use of liquid metals (lithium, gallium, tin) has also been proposed, e.g., by injection of 1–5 mm thick streams flowing at 10 m/s on solid substrates.</p>

<p>If graphite is used, the gross erosion rates due to physical and chemical <a class="uri" href="sputtering" title="wikilink">sputtering</a> would be many meters per year, so one must rely on redeposition of the sputtered material. The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with the location of the sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is the tritium co-deposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary PFC material in a commercial reactor.</p>

<p>The sputtering rate of tungsten by the plasma fuel ions is orders of magnitude smaller than that of carbon, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten, making this a more attractive choice. On the other hand, tungsten impurities in a plasma are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering of tungsten can be high, so it will be necessary to ensure that the plasma in contact with the tungsten is not too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has disadvantages in terms of eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.</p>
<h2 id="safety-and-the-environment">Safety and the environment</h2>
<h3 id="nuclear-island">Nuclear island</h3>

<p>A fusion power plant may be designed with a nuclear island and the balance of plant. This is common in typical <a href="nuclear_power" title="wikilink">fission reactors</a>. The nuclear island has a plasma chamber with an associated vacuum system, surrounded by <a href="plasma-facing_components" title="wikilink">plasma-facing components</a> (<a href="first_wall" title="wikilink">first wall</a> and <a class="uri" href="divertor" title="wikilink">divertor</a>) maintaining the vacuum and absorbing the heat coming from the plasma. If magnetic confinement is used, a magnet system made from superconducting magnets will be needed, as well as systems for heating and refueling the plasma. If inertial confinement is used, it will require a driver (laser or accelerator) and a focusing system, as well as place to manufacture and position the target. The balance of plant converts heat into electricity via <a href="steam_turbine" title="wikilink">steam turbines</a>.</p>
<h3 id="accident-potential">Accident potential</h3>

<p>There is no possibility of a catastrophic accident in a fusion reactor resulting in major release of radioactivity to the environment or injury to non-staff, unlike modern fission reactors. The primary reason is that the requirements for nuclear fusion differ greatly from nuclear fission: fusion requires extremely precise and controlled temperature, pressure, and magnetic field parameters for any net energy to be produced, and a far smaller amount of fuel. If the reactor suffered damage or lost even a small degree of required control, fusion reactions and heat generation would rapidly cease.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a></p>

<p>Therefore, fusion reactors are considered extremely safe in this sense, making them favorable over fission reactors, which, in contrast, continue to generate heat through <a class="uri" href="beta-decay" title="wikilink">beta-decay</a> for several months after reactor shut-down, meaning that melting of fuel rods is possible even after the reactor has been stopped due to continued accumulation of heat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>

<p>There is also no risk of a runaway reaction in a fusion reactor. The <a href="plasma_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasma</a> is burnt at optimal conditions, and any significant change will render it unable to react or to produce excess heat. In fusion reactors the reaction process is so delicate that this level of safety is inherent; no elaborate failsafe mechanism is required. Although the plasma in a fusion power plant will have a volume of 1000 cubic meters or more, the density of the plasma is extremely low, and the total amount of fusion fuel in the vessel is very small, typically a few grams.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> If the fuel supply is closed, the reaction stops within seconds. In comparison, a fission reactor is typically loaded with enough fuel for several years, and no additional fuel is necessary to keep the reaction going.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>

<p>In the magnetic approach, strong fields are developed in coils that are held in place mechanically by the reactor structure. Failure of this structure could release this tension and allow the magnet to "explode" outward. The severity of this event would be similar to any other industrial accident or an <a class="uri" href="MRI" title="wikilink">MRI</a> machine quench/explosion, and could be effectively stopped with a <a href="containment_building" title="wikilink">containment building</a> similar to those used in existing (fission) nuclear generators. The laser-driven inertial approach is generally lower-stress. Although failure of the reaction chamber is possible, simply stopping fuel delivery would prevent any sort of catastrophic failure.</p>

<p>Most reactor designs rely on the use of liquid <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a> as both a coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into <a class="uri" href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritium</a>, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Lithium is highly flammable, and in the case of a fire it is possible that the lithium stored on-site could be burned up and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the lithium would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about 1 kg the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power plant would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the plant's <a href="perimeter_fence" title="wikilink">perimeter fence</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a></p>

<p>The likelihood of <em>small industrial</em> accidents including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff cannot be estimated yet. These would include accidental releases of lithium, tritium, or mis-handling of decommissioned radioactive components of the reactor itself.</p>
<h3 id="effluents-during-normal-operation">Effluents during normal operation</h3>

<p>The natural product of the fusion reaction is a small amount of <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a>, which is completely harmless to life. Of more concern is <a class="uri" href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritium</a>, which, like other isotopes of hydrogen, is difficult to retain completely. During normal operation, some amount of tritium will be continually released. There would be no acute danger, but the cumulative effect on the world's population from a fusion economy could be a matter of concern.</p>

<p>Although tritium is volatile and biologically active, the health risk posed by a release is much lower than that of most radioactive contaminants, due to tritium's short half-life (12.32 years), very low decay energy (~14.95 keV), and the fact that it does not <a href="bioaccumulation" title="wikilink">bioaccumulate</a> (instead being cycled out of the body as water, with a <a href="biological_half-life" title="wikilink">biological half-life</a> of 7 to 14 days).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> Current ITER designs are investigating total containment facilities for any tritium.</p>
<h3 id="waste-management">Waste management</h3>

<p>The large flux of high-energy neutrons in a reactor will make the structural materials radioactive. The radioactive inventory at shut-down may be comparable to that of a fission reactor, but there are important differences.</p>

<p>The half-life of the <a class="uri" href="radioisotopes" title="wikilink">radioisotopes</a> produced by fusion tends to be less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which would be dangerous for about 50 years, and low-level waste another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as <a href="coal_ash" title="wikilink">coal ash</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

<p>Additionally, the choice of materials used in a fusion reactor is less constrained than in a fission design, where many materials are required for their specific <a href="neutron_cross-section" title="wikilink">neutron cross-sections</a>. This allows a fusion reactor to be designed using materials that are selected specifically to be "low activation", materials that do not easily become radioactive. <a class="uri" href="Vanadium" title="wikilink">Vanadium</a>, for example, would become much less radioactive than <a href="stainless_steel" title="wikilink">stainless steel</a>. <a href="Carbon_fiber" title="wikilink">Carbon fiber</a> materials are also low-activation, as well as being strong and light, and are a promising area of study for laser-inertial reactors where a magnetic field is not required.</p>

<p>In general terms, fusion reactors would create far less radioactive material than a fission reactor, the material it would create is less damaging biologically, and the radioactivity "burns off" within a time period that is well within existing engineering capabilities for safe long-term waste storage.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-proliferation">Nuclear proliferation</h3>

<p>Although fusion power uses nuclear technology, the overlap with nuclear weapons would be limited. A huge amount of <a class="uri" href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritium</a> could be produced by a fusion power plant. Tritium is used in the trigger of <a href="hydrogen_bomb" title="wikilink">hydrogen bombs</a> and in a modern <a href="boosted_fission_weapon" title="wikilink">boosted fission weapon</a>. But tritium can be also produced by nuclear fission. The energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade <a class="uri" href="plutonium" title="wikilink">plutonium</a> or <a class="uri" href="uranium" title="wikilink">uranium</a> for an atomic bomb (for example by transmutation of U<sup>238</sup> to Pu<sup>239</sup>, or Th<sup>232</sup> to U<sup>233</sup>).</p>

<p>A study conducted 2011 assessed the risk of three scenarios:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use in small-scale fusion plant</strong>: Due to much higher power consumption, heat dissipation and a more unique design compared to enrichment <a href="gas_centrifuge" title="wikilink">gas centrifuges</a> this choice would be much easier to detect and therefore implausible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modifications to produce weapon-usable material in a commercial facility:</strong> The production potential is significant. But no fertile or fissile substances necessary for the production of weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all. If not shielded, a detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic gamma radiation. The underlying redesign could be detected by regular design information verifications. In the (technically more feasible) case of solid breeder blanket modules, it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of fertile material,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritizing a fast production of weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy:</strong> The fastest way to produce weapon usable material was seen in modifying a prior civil fusion power plant. Unlike in some nuclear power plants, there is no weapon compatible material during civil use. Even without the need for covert action this modification would still take about 2 months to start the production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount for weapon production. This was seen as enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of inevitable parts of the facility leaving out the reactor itself would be sufficient. This, together with the intrinsic safety of fusion power would only bear a low risk of radioactive contamination.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Another study concludes that "[..]large fusion reactors – even if not designed for fissile material breeding – could easily produce several hundred kg Pu per year with high weapon quality and very low source material requirements." It was emphasized that the implementation of features for intrinsic proliferation resistance might only be possible at this phase of research and development.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> The theoretical and computational tools needed for hydrogen bomb design are closely related to those needed for <a href="inertial_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">inertial confinement fusion</a>, but have very little in common with the more scientifically developed <a href="magnetic_confinement_fusion" title="wikilink">magnetic confinement fusion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-sustainable-energy-source">As a sustainable energy source</h3>

<p>Large-scale reactors using neutronic fuels (e.g. <a class="uri" href="ITER" title="wikilink">ITER</a>) and thermal power production (turbine based) are most comparable to <a href="nuclear_power" title="wikilink">fission power</a> from an engineering and economics viewpoint. Both fission and fusion power plants involve a relatively compact heat source powering a conventional steam turbine-based power plant, while producing enough neutron radiation to make <a href="neutron_activation" title="wikilink">activation</a> of the plant materials problematic. The main distinction is that fusion power produces no high-level radioactive waste (though activated plant materials still need to be disposed of). There are some power plant ideas that may significantly lower the cost or size of such plants; however, research in these areas is nowhere near as advanced as in <a href="tokamak" title="wikilink">tokamaks</a>.</p>

<p>Fusion power commonly proposes the use of <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a>, an <a class="uri" href="isotope" title="wikilink">isotope</a> of hydrogen, as fuel and in many current designs also use <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a>. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 <a href="exa-" title="wikilink">EJ</a>/yr (= 1 × 10<sup>20</sup> J/yr) and that this does not increase in the future, which is unlikely, then the known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years. Lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, however, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium from sea water would have fuel for 150 billion years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> To put this in context, 150 billion years is close to 30 times the remaining lifespan of the sun,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> and more than 10 times the estimated age of the universe.</p>
<h2 id="economics">Economics</h2>

<p>While fusion power is still in early stages of development, substantial sums have been and continue to be invested in research. In the EU almost  was spent on fusion research up to the end of the 1990s, and the new <a class="uri" href="ITER" title="wikilink">ITER</a> reactor alone is budgeted at <mtpl></mtpl>.</p>

<p>It is estimated that up to the point of possible implementation of electricity generation by nuclear fusion, R&amp;D; will need further promotion totalling around  over a period of  or so (of which  within the EU) based on a report from 2002.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> Nuclear fusion research receives  (excluding ITER funding) from the European Union, compared with  for sustainable energy research,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn191" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a> putting research into fusion power well ahead of that of any single rivaling technology. Indeed, the size of the investments and time frame of the expected results mean that fusion research is almost exclusively publicly funded, while research in other forms of energy can be done by the private sector.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Fusion power would provide more energy for a given weight of fuel than any fuel-consuming energy source currently in use,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> and the fuel itself (primarily <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a>) exists abundantly in the Earth's ocean: about 1 in 6500 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn193" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> Although this may seem a low proportion (about 0.015%), because nuclear fusion reactions are so much more energetic than chemical combustion and seawater is easier to access and more plentiful than fossil fuels, fusion could potentially supply the world's energy needs for millions of years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn194" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn195" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite being technically <a href="non-renewable_energy" title="wikilink">non-renewable</a>, fusion power has many of the benefits of renewable energy sources (such as being a long-term energy supply and emitting no <a href="greenhouse_gas" title="wikilink">greenhouse gases</a>) as well as some of the benefits of the resource-limited energy sources as hydrocarbons and nuclear fission (without <a href="Nuclear_reprocessing" title="wikilink">reprocessing</a>). Like these currently dominant energy sources, fusion could provide very high power-generation density and uninterrupted power delivery (due to the fact that it is not dependent on the <a class="uri" href="weather" title="wikilink">weather</a>, unlike wind and solar power).</p>

<p>Another aspect of fusion energy is that the cost of production does not suffer from <a href="diseconomies_of_scale" title="wikilink">diseconomies of scale</a>. The cost of water and wind energy, for example, goes up as the optimal locations are developed first, while further generators must be sited in less ideal conditions. With fusion energy the production cost will not increase much even if large numbers of plants are built, because the raw resource (seawater) is abundant and widespread.</p>

<p>Some problems that are expected to be an issue in this century, such as <a href="water_resources" title="wikilink">fresh water shortages</a>, can alternatively be regarded as problems of energy supply. For example, in <a class="uri" href="desalination" title="wikilink">desalination</a> plants, <a class="uri" href="seawater" title="wikilink">seawater</a> can be purified through <a class="uri" href="distillation" title="wikilink">distillation</a> or <a href="reverse_osmosis" title="wikilink">reverse osmosis</a>. Nonetheless, these processes are energy intensive. Even if the first fusion plants are not competitive with alternative sources, fusion could still become competitive if large-scale desalination requires more power than the alternatives are able to provide.</p>

<p>A scenario has been presented of the effect of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn196" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> ITER and later Demo are envisioned to bring online the first commercial nuclear fusion energy reactor by 2050. Using this as the starting point and the history of the uptake of nuclear fission reactors as a guide, the scenario depicts a rapid take up of nuclear fusion energy starting after the middle of this century.</p>

<p>Fusion power could be used in <a href="interstellar_space" title="wikilink">interstellar space</a>, where solar energy is not available.</p>

"Dr. Putterman's approach is to use sound waves, called sonofusion or bubble fusion, to expand and collapse tiny bubbles, generating ultrahot temperatures. At temperatures hot enough, atoms can literally fuse and release even more energy than when they split in nuclear fission, now used in nuclear power plants and weapons. Furthermore, fusion is clean in that it does not produce long-lived nuclear waste."<a href="#fnref37">↩</a></li>
