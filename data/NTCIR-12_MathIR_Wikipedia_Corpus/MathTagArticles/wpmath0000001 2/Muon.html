<p>The <strong>muon</strong> (; from the <a href="Greek_alphabet" title="wikilink">Greek</a> letter <a href="mu_(letter)" title="wikilink">mu</a> (μ) used to represent it) is an <a href="elementary_particle" title="wikilink">elementary particle</a> similar to the <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a>, with <a href="electric_charge" title="wikilink">electric charge</a> of −1 <em>e</em> and a <a href="spin-½" title="wikilink">spin of

</a>, but with a much greater mass (). It is classified as a <a class="uri" href="lepton" title="wikilink">lepton</a>, together with the <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a> (mass ), the <a href="tau_(particle)" title="wikilink">tau</a> (mass ), and the three <a href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a> (electron neutrino , muon neutrino  and tau neutrino ). As is the case with other leptons, the muon is not believed to have any sub-structure—that is, it is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles.</p>

<p>The muon is an unstable <a href="subatomic_particle" title="wikilink">subatomic particle</a> with a <a href="mean_lifetime" title="wikilink">mean lifetime</a> of . Among all known unstable <a href="subatomic_particle" title="wikilink">subatomic particles</a>, only the neutron (~15 minutes) and some <a href="atomic_nuclei" title="wikilink">atomic nuclei</a> have a longer decay lifetime; others decay significantly faster. The decay of the muon (as well as of the <a class="uri" href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutron</a>, the longest-lived unstable <a class="uri" href="baryon" title="wikilink">baryon</a>), is mediated by the <a href="weak_interaction" title="wikilink">weak interaction</a> exclusively. Muon decay always produces at least three particles, which must include an <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a> of the same charge as the muon and two <a href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrinos</a> of different types.</p>

<p>Like all elementary particles, the muon has a corresponding <a class="uri" href="antiparticle" title="wikilink">antiparticle</a> of opposite charge (+1 <em>e</em>) but equal <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> and spin: the <strong>antimuon</strong> (also called a <em>positive muon</em>). Muons are denoted by  and antimuons by . Muons were previously called <strong>mu mesons</strong>, but are not classified as <a href="meson" title="wikilink">mesons</a> by modern particle physicists (see ), and that name is no longer used by the physics community.</p>

<p>Muons have a <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> of , which is about 207 times that of the electron. Due to their greater mass, muons are not as sharply accelerated when they encounter electromagnetic fields, and do not emit as much <a class="uri" href="bremsstrahlung" title="wikilink">bremsstrahlung</a> (deceleration radiation). This allows muons of a given energy to penetrate far more deeply into matter than electrons, since the deceleration of electrons and muons is primarily due to energy loss by the bremsstrahlung mechanism. As an example, so-called "secondary muons", generated by <a href="cosmic_rays" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> hitting the atmosphere, can penetrate to the Earth's surface, and even into deep mines.</p>

<p>Because muons have a very large mass and energy compared with the <a href="decay_energy" title="wikilink">decay energy</a> of radioactivity, they are never produced by <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive decay</a>. They are, however, produced in copious amounts in high-energy interactions in normal matter, in certain <a href="particle_accelerator" title="wikilink">particle accelerator</a> experiments with <a href="hadron" title="wikilink">hadrons</a>, or naturally in <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic ray</a> interactions with matter. These interactions usually produce <a href="pi_meson" title="wikilink">pi mesons</a> initially, which most often decay to muons.</p>

<p>As with the case of the other charged leptons, the muon has an associated <a href="muon_neutrino" title="wikilink">muon neutrino</a>, denoted by , which is not the same particle as the <a href="electron_neutrino" title="wikilink">electron neutrino</a>, and does not participate in the same nuclear reactions.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Muons were discovered by <a href="Carl_D._Anderson" title="wikilink">Carl D. Anderson</a> and <a href="Seth_Neddermeyer" title="wikilink">Seth Neddermeyer</a> at Caltech in 1936, while studying <a href="cosmic_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic radiation</a>. Anderson had noticed particles that curved differently from electrons and other known particles when passed through a <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a>. They were negatively charged but curved less sharply than electrons, but more sharply than <a href="proton" title="wikilink">protons</a>, for particles of the same velocity. It was assumed that the magnitude of their negative electric charge was equal to that of the electron, and so to account for the difference in curvature, it was supposed that their mass was greater than an electron but smaller than a proton. Thus Anderson initially called the new particle a <em>mesotron</em>, adopting the prefix <em>meso-</em> from the Greek word for "mid-". The existence of the muon was confirmed in 1937 by <a href="J._Curry_Street" title="wikilink">J. C. Street</a> and E. C. Stevenson's cloud chamber experiment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>A particle with a mass in the meson range had been predicted before the discovery of any mesons, by theorist <a href="Hideki_Yukawa" title="wikilink">Hideki Yukawa</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"It seems natural to modify the theory of Heisenberg and Fermi in the following way. The transition of a heavy particle from neutron state to proton state is not always accompanied by the emission of light particles. The transition is sometimes taken up by another heavy particle."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of its mass, the mu meson was initially thought to be Yukawa's particle, but it later proved to have the wrong properties. Yukawa's predicted particle, the pi meson, was finally identified in 1947 (again from cosmic ray interactions), and shown to differ from the earlier-discovered mu meson by having the correct properties to be a particle which mediated the <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nuclear force</a>.</p>

<p>With two particles now known with the intermediate mass, the more general term <em><a class="uri" href="meson" title="wikilink">meson</a></em> was adopted to refer to any such particle within the correct mass range between electrons and nucleons. Further, in order to differentiate between the two different types of mesons after the second meson was discovered, the initial mesotron particle was renamed the <em>mu meson</em> (the Greek letter <em>μ</em> (<em>mu</em>) corresponds to <em>m</em>), and the new 1947 meson (Yukawa's particle) was named the <a href="pi_meson" title="wikilink">pi meson</a>.</p>

<p>As more types of mesons were discovered in accelerator experiments later, it was eventually found that the mu meson significantly differed not only from the pi meson (of about the same mass), but also from all other types of mesons. The difference, in part, was that mu mesons did not interact with the <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nuclear force</a>, as pi mesons did (and were required to do, in Yukawa's theory). Newer mesons also showed evidence of behaving like the pi meson in nuclear interactions, but not like the mu meson. Also, the mu meson's decay products included both a <a class="uri" href="neutrino" title="wikilink">neutrino</a> and an <a class="uri" href="antineutrino" title="wikilink">antineutrino</a>, rather than just one or the other, as was observed in the decay of other charged mesons.</p>

<p>In the eventual <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of particle physics codified in the 1970s, all mesons other than the mu meson were understood to be <a class="uri" href="hadrons" title="wikilink">hadrons</a>—that is, particles made of <a class="uri" href="quarks" title="wikilink">quarks</a>—and thus subject to the <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nuclear force</a>. In the quark model, a <em>meson</em> was no longer defined by mass (for some had been discovered that were very massive—more than <a href="nucleon" title="wikilink">nucleons</a>), but instead were particles composed of exactly two quarks (a quark and antiquark), unlike the <a href="baryon" title="wikilink">baryons</a>, which are defined as particles composed of three quarks (protons and neutrons were the lightest baryons). Mu mesons, however, had shown themselves to be fundamental particles (leptons) like electrons, with no quark structure. Thus, mu mesons were not <a href="meson" title="wikilink">mesons</a> at all, in the new sense and use of the term <em>meson</em> used with the quark model of particle structure.</p>

<p>With this change in definition, the term <em>mu meson</em> was abandoned, and replaced whenever possible with the modern term <em>muon</em>, making the term mu meson only historical. In the new quark model, other types of mesons sometimes continued to be referred to in shorter terminology (e.g., <em>pion</em> for pi meson), but in the case of the muon, it retained the shorter name and was never again properly referred to by older "mu meson" terminology.</p>

<p>The eventual recognition of the "mu meson" muon as a simple "heavy electron" with no role at all in the nuclear interaction, seemed so incongruous and surprising at the time, that Nobel laureate <a href="I._I._Rabi" title="wikilink">I. I. Rabi</a> famously quipped, "Who ordered that?"</p>

<p>In the <a href="Time_dilation_of_moving_particles" title="wikilink">Rossi–Hall experiment</a> (1941), muons were used to observe the <a href="time_dilation" title="wikilink">time dilation</a> (or alternately, <a href="length_contraction" title="wikilink">length contraction</a>) predicted by <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="muon-sources">Muon sources</h2>

<p>On Earth, most naturally occurring muons are created by <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a>, which consist mostly of protons, many arriving from deep space at very high energy<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>When a cosmic ray proton impacts atomic nuclei in the upper atmosphere, <a href="pion" title="wikilink">pions</a> are created. These decay within a relatively short distance (meters) into muons (their preferred decay product), and <a href="muon_neutrino" title="wikilink">muon neutrinos</a>. The muons from these high energy cosmic rays generally continue in about the same direction as the original proton, at a velocity near the speed of light. Although their lifetime <em>without</em> relativistic effects would allow a half-survival distance of only about 456 m (2,197 µs×ln(2) × 0,9997×c) at most (as seen from Earth) the <a href="time_dilation" title="wikilink">time dilation</a> effect of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> (from the viewpoint of the Earth) allows cosmic ray secondary muons to survive the flight to the Earth's surface, since in the Earth frame, the muons have a longer half life due to their velocity. From the viewpoint (<a href="inertial_frame" title="wikilink">inertial frame</a>) of the muon, on the other hand, it is the <a href="length_contraction" title="wikilink">length contraction</a> effect of special relativity which allows this penetration, since in the muon frame, its lifetime is unaffected, but the length contraction causes distances through the atmosphere and Earth to be far shorter than these distances in the Earth rest-frame. Both effects are equally valid ways of explaining the fast muon's unusual survival over distances.</p>

<p>Since muons are unusually penetrative of ordinary matter, like neutrinos, they are also detectable deep underground (700 meters at the <a href="Soudan_2" title="wikilink">Soudan 2</a> detector) and underwater, where they form a major part of the natural background ionizing radiation. Like cosmic rays, as noted, this secondary muon radiation is also directional.</p>

<p>The same nuclear reaction described above (i.e. hadron-hadron impacts to produce pion beams, which then quickly decay to muon beams over short distances) is used by particle physicists to produce muon beams, such as the beam used for the muon <a href="G-factor_(physics)" title="wikilink"><em>g</em> − 2 experiment</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="muon-decay">Muon decay</h2>

<p> Muons are unstable elementary particles and are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter than all other matter particles. They decay via the <a href="weak_interaction" title="wikilink">weak interaction</a>. Because <a href="lepton_number" title="wikilink">lepton numbers</a> must be conserved, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino (antimuon decay produces the corresponding antiparticles, as detailed below). Because charge must be conserved, one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon (a positron if it is a positive muon). Thus all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have no net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an electron-positron pair), are produced.</p>

<p>The dominant muon decay mode (sometimes called the Michel decay after <a href="Louis_Michel_(physicist)" title="wikilink">Louis Michel</a>) is the simplest possible: the muon decays to an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a muon neutrino. Antimuons, in mirror fashion, most often decay to the corresponding antiparticles: a <a class="uri" href="positron" title="wikilink">positron</a>, an electron neutrino, and a muon antineutrino. In formulaic terms, these two decays are:</p>

 is the fraction of the maximum energy transmitted to the electron.</p>

<p>The decay distributions of the electron in muon decays have been parameterised using the so-called <a href="Michel_parameters" title="wikilink">Michel parameters</a>. The values of these four parameters are predicted unambiguously in the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a>, thus muon decays represent a good test of the space-time structure of the <a href="weak_interaction" title="wikilink">weak interaction</a>. No deviation from the Standard Model predictions has yet been found.</p>

<p>For the decay of the muon, the expected decay distribution for the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> values of Michel parameters is</p>

<p>A change in the electron distribution computed using the standard, unprecessional, Michel Parameters can be seen displaying a periodicity of π <a href="radian" title="wikilink">radians</a>. This can be shown to physically correspond to a phase change of π, introduced in the electron distribution as the angular momentum is changed by the action of the <a href="charge_conjugation" title="wikilink">charge conjugation operator</a>, which is conserved by the weak interaction.</p>

<p>The observation of Parity violation in muon decay can be compared to the concept of violation of parity in weak interactions in general as an extension of <a href="The_Wu_Experiment" title="wikilink">The Wu Experiment</a>, as well as the change of angular momentum introduced by a phase change of π corresponding to the charge-parity operator being invariant in this interaction. This fact is true for all <a class="uri" href="lepton" title="wikilink">lepton</a> interactions in The Standard Model.</p>

<p>Certain neutrino-less decay modes are kinematically allowed but forbidden in the Standard Model. Examples forbidden by lepton flavour conservation are:</p>
<dl>
<dd>

<p>→  +  and</p>
</dd>
<dd>

<p>→  +  +  .</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Observation of such decay modes would constitute clear evidence for theories <a href="beyond_the_Standard_Model" title="wikilink">beyond the Standard Model</a>. Upper limits for the branching fractions of such decay modes were measured in many experiments starting more than 50 years ago. The current upper limit for the  →  +  branching fraction was measured 2013 in the <a href="Mu_to_E_Gamma" title="wikilink">MEG</a> experiment and is 5.7 × 10<sup>−13</sup>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="muonic-atoms">Muonic atoms</h2>

<p>The muon was the first <a href="elementary_particle" title="wikilink">elementary particle</a> discovered that does not appear in ordinary <a href="atom" title="wikilink">atoms</a>. Negative muons can, however, form muonic atoms (also called <a href="exotic_atom" title="wikilink">mu-mesic atoms</a>), by replacing an electron in ordinary atoms. Muonic hydrogen atoms are much smaller than typical hydrogen atoms because the much larger mass of the muon gives it a much more localized <a href="ground_state" title="wikilink">ground-state</a> <a class="uri" href="wavefunction" title="wikilink">wavefunction</a> than is observed for the electron. In multi-electron atoms, when only one of the electrons is replaced by a muon, the size of the atom continues to be determined by the other electrons, and the atomic size is nearly unchanged. However, in such cases the orbital of the muon continues to be smaller and far closer to the nucleus than the <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a> of the electrons.</p>

<p>Muonic <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a> is created by substituting a muon for one of the electrons in helium-4. The muon orbits much closer to the nucleus, so muonic helium can therefore be regarded like an isotope of helium whose nucleus consists of two neutrons, two protons and a muon, with a single electron outside. Colloquially, it could be called "helium 4.1", since the mass of the muon is roughly 0.1 <a href="atomic_mass_unit" title="wikilink">amu</a>. Chemically, muonic helium, possessing an unpaired <a href="valence_electron" title="wikilink">valence electron</a>, can <a href="chemical_bond" title="wikilink">bond</a> with other atoms, and behaves more like a hydrogen atom than an inert helium atom.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>A positive muon, when stopped in ordinary matter, can also bind an electron and form an exotic atom known as <a class="uri" href="muonium" title="wikilink">muonium</a> (Mu) atom, in which the muon acts as the nucleus. The positive muon, in this context, can be considered a pseudo-isotope of hydrogen with one ninth of the mass of the proton. Because the <a href="reduced_mass" title="wikilink">reduced mass</a> of muonium, and hence its <a href="Bohr_radius" title="wikilink">Bohr radius</a>, is very close to that of <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, this short-lived "atom" behaves chemically — to a first approximation — like <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> and <a class="uri" href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritium</a>.</p>

<p>The recent culmination of a twelve year experiment at investigating the proton's charge radius involved the use of <a href="muonic_hydrogen" title="wikilink">muonic hydrogen</a>. This form of hydrogen is composed of a muon orbiting a proton.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <a href="Lamb_shift" title="wikilink">Lamb shift</a> in muonic hydrogen was measured by driving the muon from its 2s state up to an excited 2<a href="azimuthal_quantum_number" title="wikilink">p</a> state using a laser. The frequency of the photon required to induce this transition was revealed to be 50 terahertz which, according to present theories of <a href="quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum electrodynamics</a>, yields a value of 0.84184 ± 0.00067 <a href="femtometre" title="wikilink">femtometres</a> for the charge radius of the proton.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment" title="wikilink">anomalous magnetic dipole moment</a> is the difference between the experimentally observed value of the magnetic dipole moment and the theoretical value predicted by the <a href="Dirac_equation" title="wikilink">Dirac equation</a>. The measurement and prediction of this value is very important in the <a href="precision_tests_of_QED" title="wikilink">precision tests of QED</a> (<a href="quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum electrodynamics</a>). The E821 experiment<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> at <a href="Brookhaven_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> (BNL) studied the precession of muon and anti-muon in a constant external magnetic field as they circulated in a confining storage ring.

<p>The prediction for the value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment includes three parts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>α<sub>μ</sub><sup>SM</sup> = α<sub>μ</sub><sup>QED</sup> + α<sub>μ</sub><sup>EW</sup> + α<sub>μ</sub><sup>had</sup>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The difference between the <a href="g-factor_(physics)" title="wikilink">g-factors</a> of the muon and the electron is due to their difference in mass. Because of the muon's larger mass, contributions to the theoretical calculation of its anomalous magnetic dipole moment from <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> <a href="weak_interaction" title="wikilink">weak interactions</a> and from contributions involving <a href="hadron" title="wikilink">hadrons</a> are important at the current level of precision, whereas these effects are not important for the electron. The muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment is also sensitive to contributions from new physics <a href="beyond_the_Standard_Model" title="wikilink">beyond the Standard Model</a>, such as <a class="uri" href="supersymmetry" title="wikilink">supersymmetry</a>. For this reason, the muon's anomalous magnetic moment is normally used as a probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model rather than as a test of QED.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> A new experiment at Fermilab using the E821 magnet will improve the precision of this measurement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="muon-radiography-and-tomography">Muon radiography and tomography</h2>

<p>Since muons are much more deeply penetrating than <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> or <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma rays</a>, muon imaging can be used with much thicker material or, with cosmic ray sources, larger objects. An important advantage of muon <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">non-ionizing radiation</a> is that it is safe for humans, plants, and animals. One example is commercial muon tomography used to image entire cargo containers to detect shielded <a href="Nuclear_material" title="wikilink">nuclear</a> material, as well as explosives or other contraband.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>The technique of muon transmission radiography based on cosmic ray sources was first used in the 1950s to measure the depth of the <a class="uri" href="overburden" title="wikilink">overburden</a> of a tunnel in Australia<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and in the 1960s to search for possible hidden chambers in the <a href="Pyramid_of_Chephren" title="wikilink">Pyramid of Chephren</a> in <a class="uri" href="Giza" title="wikilink">Giza</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2003, the scientists at <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> developed a new imaging technique: <strong>muon scattering tomography</strong>. With muon scattering tomography, both incoming and outgoing trajectories for each particle are reconstructed, such as with sealed aluminum <a href="drift_tube" title="wikilink">drift tubes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Since the development of this technique, several companies have started to use it.</p>

<p>In August 2014, Decision Sciences International Corporation announced it had been awarded a contract by <a class="uri" href="Toshiba" title="wikilink">Toshiba</a> for use of its muon tracking detectors in reclaiming the <a href="Fukushima_Daiichi" title="wikilink">Fukushima</a> nuclear complex.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The Fukushima Daiichi Tracker (FDT) was proposed to make a few months of muon measurements to show the distribution of the reactor cores.</p>

<p>In December 2014, <a class="uri" href="Tepco" title="wikilink">Tepco</a> reported that they would be using two different muon imaging techniques at Fukushima, "Muon Scanning Method" on Unit 1 (the most badly damaged, where the fuel may have left the reactor vessel) and "Muon Scattering Method" on Unit 2.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning <a class="uri" href="IRID" title="wikilink">IRID</a> in Japan and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization <a class="uri" href="KEK" title="wikilink">KEK</a> call the method they developed for Unit 1 the <strong>muon permeation method</strong>; 1,200 optical fibers for wavelength conversion light up when muons come into contact with them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> After a month of data collection, it is hoped to reveal the location and amount of fuel debris still inside the reactor. The measurements began in February 2015.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
