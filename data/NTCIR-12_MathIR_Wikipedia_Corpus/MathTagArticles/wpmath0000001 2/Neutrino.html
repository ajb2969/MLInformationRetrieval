<h1>Neutrino</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>neutrino</strong> ( or , in Italian ) is an electrically neutral <a href="elementary_particle" title="wikilink">elementary particle</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with <a href="spin-1/2" title="wikilink">half-integer spin</a>. The neutrino (meaning "little neutral one" in Italian) is denoted by the Greek letter ν (<em><a href="Nu_(letter)" title="wikilink">nu</a></em>). All evidence suggests that neutrinos have <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> but that their masses are tiny, even compared to other subatomic particles.</p>

<p>Neutrinos are <a class="uri" href="leptons" title="wikilink">leptons</a>, along with the charged <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a>, <a href="muon" title="wikilink">muons</a>, and <a href="tau_(particle)" title="wikilink">taus</a>, and come in three <a href="Flavor_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">flavors</a>: electron neutrinos (), muon neutrinos (), and tau neutrinos (). Each flavor is also associated with an <a class="uri" href="antiparticle" title="wikilink">antiparticle</a>, called an "antineutrino", which also has no electric charge and half-integer spin. Neutrinos are produced in a way that conserves <a href="lepton_number" title="wikilink">lepton number</a>; i.e., for every electron neutrino produced, a <a class="uri" href="positron" title="wikilink">positron</a> (anti-electron) is produced, and for every electron antineutrino produced, an electron is produced as well.</p>

<p>Neutrinos do not carry any <a href="electric_charge" title="wikilink">electric charge</a>, which means that they are not affected by the <a href="electromagnetic_force" title="wikilink">electromagnetic force</a> that acts on charged particles, and are <a class="uri" href="leptons" title="wikilink">leptons</a>, so they are not affected by the <a href="strong_force" title="wikilink">strong force</a> that acts on particles inside atomic nuclei. Neutrinos are therefore affected only by the <a href="weak_interaction" title="wikilink">weak subatomic force</a> and by <a class="uri" href="gravity" title="wikilink">gravity</a>. The weak force is a very short-range interaction, and gravity is extremely weak on the <a href="subatomic_scale" title="wikilink">subatomic scale</a>. Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and undetected.</p>

<p>Neutrinos can be created in several ways, including in certain types of <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive decay</a>, in <a href="nuclear_reaction" title="wikilink">nuclear reactions</a> such as those that take place in the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>, in <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactors</a>, when <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> hit atoms and in <a href="supernova" title="wikilink">supernovas</a>. The majority of neutrinos in the vicinity of the earth are from nuclear reactions in the Sun. In fact, about 65 billion () <a href="solar_neutrino" title="wikilink">solar neutrinos</a> per second pass through every square centimeter perpendicular to the direction of the Sun in the region of the Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Neutrinos are now understood to <a href="Neutrino_oscillation" title="wikilink">oscillate</a> between different flavors in flight. That is, an electron neutrino produced in a <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> reaction may arrive in a detector as a muon or tau neutrino. This oscillation requires that the different neutrino flavors have different masses, although these masses have been shown to be tiny. From <a href="cosmology" title="wikilink">cosmological</a> measurements, we know that the sum of the three neutrino masses must be less than one millionth that of the electron.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="paulis-proposal">Pauli's proposal</h3>

<p>The neutrino<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> was postulated first by <a href="Wolfgang_Pauli" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Pauli</a> in 1930 to explain how <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a> could conserve <a href="conservation_of_energy" title="wikilink">energy</a>, <a href="conservation_of_momentum" title="wikilink">momentum</a>, and <a href="conservation_of_angular_momentum" title="wikilink">angular momentum</a> (<a href="Spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a>). In contrast to <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a>, who proposed a statistical version of the conservation laws to explain the <a href="Event_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">event</a>, Pauli hypothesized an undetected particle that he called a "neutron" in keeping with convention employed for naming both the <a class="uri" href="proton" title="wikilink">proton</a> and the <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a>, which in 1930 were known to be respective products for alpha and beta decay. He considered that the new particle was emitted from the nucleus together with the electron or beta particle in the process of beta decay.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="James_Chadwick" title="wikilink">James Chadwick</a> discovered a much more massive nuclear particle in 1932 and also named it a <a class="uri" href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutron</a>, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name. Pauli earlier had used the term "neutron" for both the particle that conserved energy in beta decay, and a presumed neutral particle in the nucleus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The word "neutrino" entered the international vocabulary through <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a>, who used it during a conference in Paris in July 1932 and at the Solvay Conference in October 1933, where also Pauli employed it. The name (the <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a> equivalent of "little neutral one") was jokingly coined by <a href="Edoardo_Amaldi" title="wikilink">Edoardo Amaldi</a> during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick's neutron. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In Fermi's theory of beta decay, Chadwick's large neutral particle could decay to a proton, electron, and the smaller neutral particle:</p>

<p>Fermi's paper, written in 1934, unified Pauli's neutrino with <a href="Paul_Dirac" title="wikilink">Paul Dirac</a>'s <a class="uri" href="positron" title="wikilink">positron</a> and <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a>'s neutron–proton model and gave a solid theoretical basis for future experimental work. However, the journal <a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink">Nature</a> rejected Fermi's paper, saying that the theory was "too remote from reality". He submitted the paper to an Italian journal, which accepted it, but the general lack of interest in his theory at that early date caused him to switch to experimental physics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, even in 1934 there were hints that Bohr's idea that the energy conservation laws were not followed, was incorrect. At the <a href="Solvay_conference" title="wikilink">Solvay conference</a> of 1934, the first measurements of the energy spectra of beta decay were reported, and these spectra were found to impose a strict limit on the energy of electrons from each type of beta decay. Such a limit was not expected if the conservation of energy was not upheld, in which case any amount of energy would be expected to be statistically available in at least a few decays. The natural explanation of the beta decay spectrum as first measured in 1934 was that only a limited (and conserved) amount of energy was available, and a new particle was sometimes taking a varying fraction of this limited energy, leaving the rest for the beta particle. Pauli made use of the occasion to publicly emphasize that the still-undetected "neutrino" must be an actual particle.</p>
<h3 id="direct-detection">Direct detection</h3>

<p> In 1942 <a href="Wang_Ganchang" title="wikilink">Wang Ganchang</a> first proposed the use of <a href="Electron_capture" title="wikilink">beta capture</a> to experimentally detect neutrinos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In the 20 July 1956 issue of <a href="Science_(journal)" title="wikilink"><em>Science</em></a>, <a href="Clyde_Cowan" title="wikilink">Clyde Cowan</a>, <a href="Frederick_Reines" title="wikilink">Frederick Reines</a>, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D. McGuire published confirmation that they had detected the neutrino,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> a result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">1995 Nobel Prize</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>In this experiment, now known as the <a href="Cowan–Reines_neutrino_experiment" title="wikilink">Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment</a>, antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor by beta decay reacted with protons to produce <a href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutrons</a> and <a href="positron" title="wikilink">positrons</a>:</p>

<p>The positron quickly finds an electron, and they <a href="Annihilation" title="wikilink">annihilate</a> each other. The two resulting <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma rays</a> (γ) are detectable. The neutron can be detected by its capture on an appropriate nucleus, releasing a gamma ray. The coincidence of both events – positron annihilation and neutron capture – gives a unique signature of an antineutrino interaction.</p>
<h3 id="neutrino-flavor">Neutrino flavor</h3>

<p>The antineutrino discovered by Cowan and Reines is the antiparticle of the <a href="electron_neutrino" title="wikilink">electron neutrino</a>. In 1962, <a href="Leon_M._Lederman" title="wikilink">Leon M. Lederman</a>, <a href="Melvin_Schwartz" title="wikilink">Melvin Schwartz</a> and <a href="Jack_Steinberger" title="wikilink">Jack Steinberger</a> showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first detecting interactions of the <a class="uri" href="muon" title="wikilink">muon</a> neutrino (already hypothesised with the name <em>neutretto</em>),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> which earned them the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">1988 Nobel Prize in Physics</a>. When the third type of <a class="uri" href="lepton" title="wikilink">lepton</a>, the <a href="tau_(particle)" title="wikilink">tau</a>, was discovered in 1975 at the <a href="Stanford_Linear_Accelerator_Center" title="wikilink">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a>, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino (the tau neutrino). First evidence for this third neutrino type came from the observation of missing energy and momentum in tau decays analogous to the beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in summer of 2000 by the <a href="DONUT" title="wikilink">DONUT collaboration</a> at <a class="uri" href="Fermilab" title="wikilink">Fermilab</a>; its existence had already been inferred by both theoretical consistency and experimental data from the <a href="Large_Electron–Positron_Collider" title="wikilink">Large Electron–Positron Collider</a>.</p>
<h3 id="solar-neutrino-problem">Solar neutrino problem</h3>

<p>Starting in the late 1960s, several experiments found that the number of <a href="electron_neutrino" title="wikilink">electron neutrinos</a> arriving from the Sun was between one third and one half the number predicted by the <a href="Standard_Solar_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Solar Model</a>. This discrepancy, which became known as the <a href="solar_neutrino_problem" title="wikilink">solar neutrino problem</a>, remained unresolved for some thirty years. It was resolved by discovery of <a href="neutrino_oscillation" title="wikilink">neutrino oscillation</a> and mass. (The <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model of particle physics</a> had assumed that neutrinos are massless and cannot change <a href="Flavour_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">flavor</a>. However, if neutrinos had mass, they could change flavor, or <em>oscillate</em> between flavors).</p>
<h3 id="oscillation">Oscillation</h3>

<p>A practical method for investigating neutrino oscillations was first suggested by <a href="Bruno_Pontecorvo" title="wikilink">Bruno Pontecorvo</a> in 1957 using an analogy with <a class="uri" href="kaon" title="wikilink">kaon</a> <a href="kaon_oscillation" title="wikilink">oscillations</a>; over the subsequent 10 years he developed the mathematical formalism and the modern formulation of vacuum oscillations. In 1985 <a href="Stanislav_Mikheyev" title="wikilink">Stanislav Mikheyev</a> and <a href="Alexei_Smirnov_(physicist)" title="wikilink">Alexei Smirnov</a> (expanding on 1978 work by <a href="Lincoln_Wolfenstein" title="wikilink">Lincoln Wolfenstein</a>) noted that flavor oscillations can be modified when neutrinos propagate through matter. This so-called <a href="Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein_effect" title="wikilink">Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect</a> (MSW effect) is important to understand because many neutrinos emitted by fusion in the Sun pass through the dense matter in the <a href="solar_core" title="wikilink">solar core</a> (where essentially all solar fusion takes place) on their way to detectors on Earth.</p>

<p>Starting in 1998, experiments began to show that solar and atmospheric neutrinos change flavors (see <a class="uri" href="Super-Kamiokande" title="wikilink">Super-Kamiokande</a> and <a href="Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory" title="wikilink">Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</a>). This resolved the solar neutrino problem: the electron neutrinos produced in the Sun had partly changed into other flavors which the experiments could not detect.</p>

<p>Although individual experiments, such as the set of solar neutrino experiments, are consistent with non-oscillatory mechanisms of neutrino flavor conversion, taken altogether, neutrino experiments imply the existence of neutrino oscillations. Especially relevant in this context are the reactor experiment <a class="uri" href="KamLAND" title="wikilink">KamLAND</a> and the accelerator experiments such as <a class="uri" href="MINOS" title="wikilink">MINOS</a>. The KamLAND experiment has indeed identified oscillations as the neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved in the solar electron neutrinos. Similarly MINOS confirms the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos and gives a better determination of the mass squared splitting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="supernova-neutrinos">Supernova neutrinos</h3>

<p><a href="Raymond_Davis,_Jr." title="wikilink">Raymond Davis, Jr.</a> and <a href="Masatoshi_Koshiba" title="wikilink">Masatoshi Koshiba</a> were jointly awarded the 2002 <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>; Davis for his pioneer work on <a href="cosmic_neutrino" title="wikilink">cosmic neutrinos</a> and Koshiba for the first real time observation of <a href="supernova_neutrino" title="wikilink">supernova neutrinos</a>. The detection of <a href="solar_neutrino" title="wikilink">solar neutrinos</a>, and of neutrinos of the <a href="SN_1987A" title="wikilink">SN 1987A</a> <a class="uri" href="supernova" title="wikilink">supernova</a> in 1987 marked the beginning of <a href="neutrino_astronomy" title="wikilink">neutrino astronomy</a>.

) and is therefore a <a class="uri" href="fermion" title="wikilink">fermion</a>. Neutrinos interact primarily through the <a href="weak_nuclear_force" title="wikilink">weak force</a>. The discovery of <a href="neutrino_oscillation" title="wikilink">neutrino flavor oscillations</a> implies that neutrinos have mass. The existence of a neutrino mass strongly suggests the existence of a tiny neutrino magnetic moment<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> of the order of <mtpl></mtpl>, allowing the possibility that neutrinos may interact electromagnetically as well. An experiment done by <a href="C._S._Wu" title="wikilink">C. S. Wu</a> at <a href="Columbia_University" title="wikilink">Columbia University</a> showed that neutrinos always have left-handed <a href="chirality_(physics)" title="wikilink">chirality</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It is very hard to uniquely identify neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino with one of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.</p>
<h3 id="mikheyevsmirnovwolfenstein-effect">Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect</h3>

<p>Neutrinos traveling through matter, in general, undergo a process analogous to <a href="Speed_of_light#In_a_medium" title="wikilink">light traveling through a transparent material</a>. This process is not directly observable because it does not produce <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a>, but gives rise to the <a href="MSW_effect" title="wikilink">MSW effect</a>. Only a small fraction of the neutrino's energy is transferred to the material.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-reactions">Nuclear reactions</h3>

<p>Neutrinos can interact with a nucleus, changing it to another nucleus. This process is used in radiochemical <a href="neutrino_detector" title="wikilink">neutrino detectors</a>. In this case, the energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus have to be taken into account to estimate the probability for an interaction. In general the interaction probability increases with the number of neutrons and protons within a nucleus.</p>
<h3 id="induced-fission">Induced fission</h3>

<p>Very much like <a href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutrons</a> do in <a href="nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">nuclear reactors</a>, neutrinos can induce <a href="fission_reaction" title="wikilink">fission reactions</a> within heavy <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">nuclei</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> So far, this reaction has not been measured in a laboratory, but is predicted to happen within stars and supernovae.

<p>There are three known types (<em><a href="flavor_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">flavors</a></em>) of neutrinos: electron neutrino , muon neutrino  and tau neutrino , named after their partner <a href="lepton" title="wikilink">leptons</a> in the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> (see table at right). The current best measurement of the number of neutrino types comes from observing the decay of the <a href="W_and_Z_bosons" title="wikilink">Z boson</a>. This particle can decay into any light neutrino and its antineutrino, and the more types of light neutrinos<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> available, the shorter the lifetime of the Z boson. Measurements of the Z lifetime have shown that the number of light neutrino types is 3.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The correspondence between the six <a href="quark" title="wikilink">quarks</a> in the Standard Model and the six leptons, among them the three neutrinos, suggests to physicists' intuition that there should be exactly three types of neutrino. However, actual proof that there are only three kinds of neutrinos remains an elusive goal of particle physics.</p>

<p>The possibility of <a href="Sterile_neutrino" title="wikilink"><em>sterile</em> neutrinos</a>—relatively light neutrinos which do not participate in the weak interaction but which could be created through flavor oscillation (see below)—is unaffected by these Z-boson-based measurements, and the existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the <a class="uri" href="LSND" title="wikilink">LSND</a> experiment. However, the currently running <a class="uri" href="MiniBooNE" title="wikilink">MiniBooNE</a> experiment suggested, until recently, that sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> although the latest research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> A recent re-analysis of reference electron spectra data from the <a href="Institut_Laue-Langevin" title="wikilink">Institut Laue-Langevin</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> has also hinted at a fourth, sterile neutrino.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Recently analyzed data from the <a href="Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe" title="wikilink">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> of the <a href="Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic background radiation</a> is compatible with either three or four types of neutrinos. It is hoped that the addition of two more years of data from the probe will resolve this uncertainty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="antineutrinos">Antineutrinos</h3>

<p>Antineutrinos, the <a href="antiparticle" title="wikilink">antiparticles</a> of neutrinos, are <a href="electric_charge" title="wikilink">neutral</a> particles produced in <a href="nuclear_reaction" title="wikilink">nuclear</a> <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a>. These are emitted during <a href="beta_particle" title="wikilink">beta particle</a> emissions, in which a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. They have a <a href="spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a> of ½, and are part of the <a class="uri" href="lepton" title="wikilink">lepton</a> family of particles. All antineutrinos observed so far all have right-handed <a href="helicity_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">helicity</a> (i.e. only one of the two possible spin states has ever been seen), while neutrinos are left-handed. Antineutrinos, like neutrinos, interact with other <a class="uri" href="matter" title="wikilink">matter</a> only through the <a class="uri" href="gravitational" title="wikilink">gravitational</a> and <a href="weak_force" title="wikilink">weak forces</a>, making them very difficult to detect experimentally. <a href="Neutrino_oscillation" title="wikilink">Neutrino oscillation</a> experiments indicate that antineutrinos have <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a>, but beta decay experiments constrain that mass to be very small. A neutrino–antineutrino interaction has been suggested in attempts to form a composite photon with the <a href="neutrino_theory_of_light" title="wikilink">neutrino theory of light</a>.</p>

<p>Because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles, it is possible that they are actually the same particle. Particles that have this property are known as <a href="Majorana_particle" title="wikilink">Majorana particles</a>. Majorana neutrinos have the property that the neutrino and antineutrino could be distinguished only by <a href="chirality_(physics)" title="wikilink">chirality</a>; what experiments observe as a difference between the neutrino and antineutrino could simply be due to one particle with two possible chiralities. If neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, <a href="neutrinoless_double_beta_decay" title="wikilink">neutrinoless double beta decay</a>, as well as a range of other lepton number violating phenomena, would be allowed. Several experiments have been and are being conducted to search for this process.</p>

<p>Researchers around the world have begun to investigate the possibility of using antineutrinos for reactor monitoring in the context of preventing the <a href="nuclear_proliferation" title="wikilink">proliferation of nuclear weapons</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Antineutrinos were first detected as a result of their interaction with protons in a large tank of water. This was installed next to a nuclear reactor as a controllable source of the antineutrinos. (See: <a href="Cowan–Reines_neutrino_experiment" title="wikilink">Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment</a>)</p>

<p>Only antineutrinos, not neutrinos, take part in the <a href="Glashow_resonance" title="wikilink">Glashow resonance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="flavor-oscillations">Flavor oscillations</h3>

<p>Neutrinos are most often created or detected with a well defined <a href="Flavor_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">flavor</a> (electron, muon, tau). However, in a phenomenon known as neutrino flavor oscillation, neutrinos are able to oscillate among the three available flavors while they propagate through space. Specifically, this occurs because the neutrino flavor <a href="Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" title="wikilink">eigenstates</a> are not the same as the neutrino mass eigenstates (simply called 1, 2, 3). This allows for a neutrino that was produced as an electron neutrino at a given location to have a calculable probability to be detected as either a muon or tau neutrino after it has traveled to another location. This <a href="quantum_mechanical" title="wikilink">quantum mechanical</a> effect was first hinted by the discrepancy between the number of electron neutrinos detected from the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>'s core failing to match the expected numbers, dubbed as the "<a href="solar_neutrino_problem" title="wikilink">solar neutrino problem</a>". In the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> the existence of flavor oscillations implies nonzero differences between the neutrino masses, because the amount of mixing between neutrino flavors at a given time depends on the differences between their squared masses. There are other possibilities in which neutrino can oscillate even if they are massless. If Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry, neutrinos can experience <a href="Lorentz-violating_neutrino_oscillations" title="wikilink">Lorentz-violating oscillations</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>It is possible that the neutrino and antineutrino are in fact the same particle, a hypothesis first proposed by the Italian physicist <a href="Ettore_Majorana" title="wikilink">Ettore Majorana</a>. The neutrino could transform into an antineutrino (and vice versa) by flipping the orientation of its <a href="Spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a> state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>This change in spin would require the neutrino and antineutrino to have nonzero mass, and therefore travel slower than light, because such a spin flip, caused only by a change in point of view, can take place only if <a href="inertial_frame_of_reference" title="wikilink">inertial frames of reference</a> exist that move faster than the particle: such a particle has a spin of one orientation when seen from a frame which moves slower than the particle, but the opposite spin when observed from a frame that moves faster than the particle.</p>

<p>On July 19, 2013 the results from the <a href="T2K_experiment" title="wikilink">T2K experiment</a> presented at the <a href="European_Physical_Society" title="wikilink">European Physical Society</a> Conference on High Energy Physics in Stockholm, Sweden, confirmed neutrino oscillation theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>

<p>Before neutrinos were found to oscillate, they were generally assumed to be massless, propagating at the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>. According to the theory of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, the question of neutrino <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a> is closely related to their <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a>. If neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light. However, if they have mass, they cannot reach the speed of light.</p>

<p>Also some <a href="Lorentz_violation" title="wikilink">Lorentz-violating</a> variants of <a href="quantum_gravity" title="wikilink">quantum gravity</a> might allow faster-than-light neutrinos. A comprehensive framework for Lorentz violations is the <a href="Standard-Model_Extension" title="wikilink">Standard-Model Extension</a> (SME).</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, first measurements of neutrino speed were done using pulsed <a class="uri" href="pion" title="wikilink">pion</a> beams (produced by pulsed proton beams hitting a target). The pions decayed producing neutrinos, and the neutrino interactions observed within a time window in a detector at a distance were consistent with the speed of light. This measurement was repeated in 2007 using the <a class="uri" href="MINOS" title="wikilink">MINOS</a> detectors, which found the speed of  neutrinos to be  at 68% confidence level, and at 99% confidence level a range between  and . The central value is higher than the speed of light and is consistent with superluminal velocity; however, the uncertainty is great enough that the result also does not rule out speeds less than or equal to light at this high confidence level. This measurement set an upper bound on the mass of the muon neutrino of  at 99% <a href="confidence_interval" title="wikilink">confidence</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> After the detectors for the project were upgraded in 2012, MINOS corrected their initial result and found agreement with the speed of light, with limits for the difference in the arrival time of light and neutrinos of

<p>The same observation was made, on a somewhat larger scale, with <a href="supernova_1987A" title="wikilink">supernova 1987A</a> (SN 1987A). 10-MeV antineutrinos from the supernova were detected within a time window that was consistent with the speed of light for the neutrinos. So far, the question of neutrino masses cannot be decided based on measurements of the neutrino speed.</p>

<p>In September 2011, the <a href="OPERA_experiment" title="wikilink">OPERA collaboration</a> released calculations showing velocities of 17-GeV and 28-GeV neutrinos exceeding the speed of light in their experiments (see <a href="Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly" title="wikilink">Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly</a>). In November 2011, OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be determined individually for each detected neutrino. The results showed the same faster-than-light speed. However, in February 2012 reports came out that the results may have been caused by a loose fiber optic cable attached to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times of the neutrinos. An independent recreation of the experiment in the same laboratory by <a href="ICARUS_(experiment)" title="wikilink">ICARUS</a> found no discernible difference between the speed of a neutrino and the speed of light.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> In June 2012, CERN announced that new measurements conducted by four Gran Sasso experiments (OPERA, ICARUS, <a class="uri" href="Borexino" title="wikilink">Borexino</a> and <a href="Large_Volume_Detector" title="wikilink">LVD</a>) found agreement between the speed of light and the speed of neutrinos, finally refuting the initial OPERA result.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="mass">Mass</h3>

<p>The <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless. However the experimentally established phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, which mixes neutrino flavour states with neutrino mass states (analogously to <a href="Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa_matrix" title="wikilink">CKM mixing</a>), requires neutrinos to have nonzero masses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Massive neutrinos were originally conceived by <a href="Bruno_Pontecorvo" title="wikilink">Bruno Pontecorvo</a> in the 1950s. Enhancing the basic framework to accommodate their mass is straightforward by adding a <a href="Lagrangian_(field_theory)" title="wikilink">right-handed Lagrangian</a>. This can be done in two ways. If, like other fundamental Standard Model particles, mass is generated by the <a href="Dirac_fermion" title="wikilink">Dirac mechanism</a>, then the framework would require an <a href="Special_unitary_group#n_.3D_2" title="wikilink">SU(2) singlet</a>. This particle would have no other Standard Model interactions (apart from the <a href="Yukawa_interaction" title="wikilink">Yukawa interactions</a> with the neutral component of the <a href="Higgs_boson" title="wikilink">Higgs</a> <a href="Doublet_state" title="wikilink">doublet</a>), so is called a sterile neutrino. Or, mass can be generated by the <a href="Majorana_mass" title="wikilink">Majorana mechanism</a>, which would require the neutrino and antineutrino to be the same particle.</p>

<p>The strongest upper limit on the masses of neutrinos comes from <a href="physical_cosmology" title="wikilink">cosmology</a>: the <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a> model predicts that there is a fixed ratio between the number of neutrinos and the number of <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a> in the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background</a>. If the total energy of all three types of neutrinos exceeded an average of  per neutrino, there would be so much mass in the universe that it would collapse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> This limit can be circumvented by assuming that the neutrino is unstable; however, there are limits within the Standard Model that make this difficult. A much more stringent constraint comes from a careful analysis of cosmological data, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, <a href="galaxy_survey" title="wikilink">galaxy surveys</a>, and the <a href="Lyman-alpha_forest" title="wikilink">Lyman-alpha forest</a>. These indicate that the summed masses of the three neutrinos must be less than .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1998, research results at the <a class="uri" href="Super-Kamiokande" title="wikilink">Super-Kamiokande</a> neutrino detector determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, which requires that they must have a nonzero mass.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> While this shows that neutrinos have mass, the absolute neutrino mass scale is still not known. This is because neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to the difference in the squares of the masses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The best estimate of the difference in the squares of the masses of mass eigenstates 1 and 2 was published by <a class="uri" href="KamLAND" title="wikilink">KamLAND</a> in 2005: Δ<em>m</em> = <mtpl></mtpl>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In 2006, the <a class="uri" href="MINOS" title="wikilink">MINOS</a> experiment measured oscillations from an intense muon neutrino beam, determining the difference in the squares of the masses between neutrino mass eigenstates 2 and 3. The initial results indicate |Δ<em>m</em>| = <mtpl></mtpl>, consistent with previous results from Super-Kamiokande.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Since |Δ<em>m</em>| is the difference of two squared masses, at least one of them has to have a value which is at least the square root of this value. Thus, there exists at least one neutrino mass eigenstate with a mass of at least .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2009, lensing data of a galaxy cluster were analyzed to predict a neutrino mass of about .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> This surprisingly high value requires that the three neutrino masses be nearly equal, with neutrino oscillations of order meV. The masses lie below the Mainz-Troitsk upper bound of  for the electron antineutrino.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The latter will be tested in 2015 in the <a class="uri" href="KATRIN" title="wikilink">KATRIN</a> experiment, that searches for a mass between  and .</p>

<p>A number of efforts are under way to directly determine the absolute neutrino mass scale in laboratory experiments. The methods applied involve nuclear beta decay (<a class="uri" href="KATRIN" title="wikilink">KATRIN</a> and <a class="uri" href="MARE" title="wikilink">MARE</a>).</p>

<p>On 31 May 2010, <a href="OPERA_experiment" title="wikilink">OPERA</a> researchers observed the first <a href="tau_neutrino" title="wikilink">tau neutrino</a> candidate event in a <a href="muon_neutrino" title="wikilink">muon neutrino</a> beam, the first time this transformation in neutrinos had been observed, providing further evidence that they have mass.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>In July 2010 the 3-D MegaZ DR7 galaxy survey reported that they had measured a limit of the combined mass of the three neutrino varieties to be less than .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> A tighter upper bound yet for this sum of masses, , was reported in March 2013 by the <a href="Planck_(spacecraft)" title="wikilink">Planck collaboration</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> whereas a February 2014 result estimates the sum as 0.320 ± 0.081 eV based on discrepancies between the cosmological consequences implied by Planck's detailed measurements of the <a href="Cosmic_Microwave_Background" title="wikilink">Cosmic Microwave Background</a> and predictions arising from observing other phenomena, combined with the assumption that neutrinos are responsible for the observed weaker <a href="gravitational_lensing" title="wikilink">gravitational lensing</a> than would be expected from massless neutrinos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>If the neutrino is a <a href="Majorana_fermion" title="wikilink">Majorana particle</a>, the mass may be calculated by finding the <a href="half_life" title="wikilink">half life</a> of <a href="Double_beta_decay" title="wikilink">neutrinoless double-beta decay</a> of certain nuclei. As of 2015, the lowest upper limit on the Majorana mass of the neutrino has been set by <a class="uri" href="KamLAND" title="wikilink">KamLAND</a>-Zen: 0.12–0.25 eV.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>Standard Model neutrinos are fundamental point-like particles. An effective size can be defined using their electroweak <a href="Cross_section_(physics)" title="wikilink">cross section</a> (apparent size in <a href="electroweak_interaction" title="wikilink">electroweak interaction</a>). The average electroweak characteristic size is <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>n</em> × 10<sup>−33</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> (<em>n</em> × 1 <a href="Barn_(unit)" title="wikilink">nanobarn</a>), where <em>n</em> = 3.2 for electron neutrino, <em>n</em> = 1.7 for muon neutrino and <em>n</em> = 1.0 for tau neutrino; it depends on no other properties than mass.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> However, this is best understood as being relevant only to probability of scattering. Since the neutrino does not interact electromagnetically, and is defined quantum mechanically by a wavefunction, it does not have a size in the same sense as everyday objects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Furthermore, processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies to them that they travel at almost the speed of light. Nevertheless, neutrinos are fermions, and thus obey the <a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, i.e. that increasing their density forces them into progressively higher momentum states.</p>
<h3 id="chirality">Chirality</h3>

<p>Experimental results show that (nearly) all produced and observed neutrinos have left-handed <a href="Helicity_(particle_physics)" title="wikilink">helicities</a> (spins antiparallel to <a href="Momentum" title="wikilink">momenta</a>), and all antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible <a href="chirality_(physics)" title="wikilink">chiralities</a> is observed for either particle. These are the only chiralities included in the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of particle interactions.</p>

<p>It is possible that their counterparts (right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos) simply do not exist. If they do, their properties are substantially different from observable neutrinos and antineutrinos. It is theorized that they are either very heavy (on the order of <a href="GUT_scale" title="wikilink">GUT scale</a>—see <em><a href="Seesaw_mechanism" title="wikilink">Seesaw mechanism</a></em>), do not participate in weak interaction (so-called <a href="sterile_neutrino" title="wikilink">sterile neutrinos</a>), or both.</p>

<p>The existence of nonzero neutrino masses somewhat complicates the situation. Neutrinos are produced in weak interactions as chirality eigenstates. However, chirality of a massive particle is not a constant of motion; helicity is, but the chirality operator does not share eigenstates with the helicity operator. Free neutrinos propagate as mixtures of left- and right-handed helicity states, with mixing amplitudes on the order of <em>m</em><sub>ν</sub>/<em>E</em>. This does not significantly affect the experiments, because neutrinos involved are nearly always ultrarelativistic, and thus mixing amplitudes are vanishingly small. For example, most solar neutrinos have energies on the order of –, so the fraction of neutrinos with "wrong" helicity among them cannot exceed .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="artificial">Artificial</h3>
<h4 id="reactor-neutrinos">Reactor neutrinos</h4>

<p><a href="Nuclear_reactor" title="wikilink">Nuclear reactors</a> are the major source of human-generated neutrinos. Antineutrinos are made in the beta-decay of neutron-rich daughter fragments in the fission process. Generally, the four main isotopes contributing to the antineutrino flux are , ,  and  (i.e. via the antineutrinos emitted during <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta-minus decay</a> of their respective fission fragments). The average nuclear fission releases about  of energy, of which roughly 4.5% (or about )<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> is radiated away as antineutrinos. For a typical nuclear reactor with a thermal power of , meaning that the core produces this much heat, and an electrical power generation of , the total power production from fissioning atoms is actually , of which  is radiated away as antineutrino radiation and never appears in the engineering. This is to say,  of fission energy is <em>lost</em> from this reactor and does not appear as heat available to run turbines, since antineutrinos penetrate all building materials practically without interaction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>The antineutrino energy spectrum depends on the degree to which the fuel is burned (plutonium-239 fission antineutrinos on average have slightly more energy than those from uranium-235 fission), but in general, the <em>detectable</em> antineutrinos from fission have a peak energy between about 3.5 and , with a maximum energy of about .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> There is no established experimental method to measure the flux of low-energy antineutrinos. Only antineutrinos with an energy above threshold of  can be uniquely identified (see <em>neutrino detection</em> below). An estimated 3% of all antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry an energy above this threshold. Thus, an average nuclear power plant may generate over  antineutrinos per second above this threshold, but also a much larger number (97%/3% = ~30 times this number) below the energy threshold, which cannot be seen with present detector technology.</p>
<h4 id="accelerator-neutrinos">Accelerator neutrinos</h4>

<p>Some <a href="particle_accelerator" title="wikilink">particle accelerators</a> have been used to make neutrino beams. The technique is to collide <a href="proton" title="wikilink">protons</a> with a fixed target, producing charged <a href="pion" title="wikilink">pions</a> or <a href="kaon" title="wikilink">kaons</a>. These unstable particles are then magnetically focused into a long tunnel where they decay while in flight. Because of the <a href="Lorentz_transformation" title="wikilink">relativistic boost</a> of the decaying particle, the neutrinos are produced as a beam rather than isotropically. Efforts to construct an accelerator facility where neutrinos are produced through <a class="uri" href="muon" title="wikilink">muon</a> decays are ongoing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Such a setup is generally known as a <a href="Neutrino_Factory" title="wikilink">neutrino factory</a>.</p>
<h4 id="nuclear-bombs">Nuclear bombs</h4>

<p><a href="Nuclear_bomb" title="wikilink">Nuclear bombs</a> also produce very large quantities of neutrinos. <a href="Fred_Reines" title="wikilink">Fred Reines</a> and <a href="Clyde_Cowan" title="wikilink">Clyde Cowan</a> considered the detection of neutrinos from a bomb prior to their search for reactor neutrinos; a fission reactor was recommended as a better alternative by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Fission bombs produce antineutrinos (from the fission process), and fusion bombs produce both neutrinos (from the fusion process) and antineutrinos (from the initiating fission explosion).</p>
<h3 id="geologic">Geologic</h3>

<p>Neutrinos are part of the natural <a href="background_radiation" title="wikilink">background radiation</a>. In particular, the decay chains of  and  isotopes, as well as, include <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decays</a> which emit antineutrinos. These so-called geoneutrinos can provide valuable information on the Earth's interior. A first indication for geoneutrinos was found by the <a class="uri" href="KamLAND" title="wikilink">KamLAND</a> experiment in 2005. KamLAND's main background in the geoneutrino measurement are the antineutrinos coming from reactors. Several future experiments aim at improving the geoneutrino measurement and these will necessarily have to be far away from reactors. </p>
<h3 id="atmospheric">Atmospheric</h3>

<p>Atmospheric neutrinos result from the interaction of <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> with atomic nuclei in the <a href="Earth's_atmosphere" title="wikilink">Earth's atmosphere</a>, creating showers of particles, many of which are unstable and produce neutrinos when they decay. A collaboration of particle physicists from <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a> (India), <a href="Osaka_City_University" title="wikilink">Osaka City University</a> (Japan) and <a href="Durham_University" title="wikilink">Durham University</a> (UK) recorded the first cosmic ray neutrino interaction in an underground laboratory in <a href="Kolar_Gold_Fields" title="wikilink">Kolar Gold Fields</a> in India in 1965.</p>
<h3 id="solar">Solar</h3>

<p>Solar neutrinos originate from the <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a> powering the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> and other stars. The details of the operation of the Sun are explained by the <a href="Standard_Solar_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Solar Model</a>. In short: when four protons fuse to become one <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a> nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such conversion releases one electron neutrino.</p>

<p>The Sun sends enormous numbers of neutrinos in all directions. Each second, about 65 <a href="1000000000_(number)" title="wikilink">billion</a> () solar neutrinos pass through every square centimeter on the part of the Earth that faces the Sun.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Since neutrinos are insignificantly absorbed by the mass of the Earth, the surface area on the side of the Earth opposite the Sun receives about the same number of neutrinos as the side facing the Sun.</p>
<h3 id="supernovae">Supernovae</h3>

<p> In 1966 Colgate and White<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> calculated that neutrinos carry away most of the gravitational energy released by the collapse of massive stars, events now categorized as <a href="Type_Ib_and_Ic_supernovae" title="wikilink">Type Ib and Ic</a> and <a href="Type_II_supernova" title="wikilink">Type II</a> <a href="supernova" title="wikilink">supernovae</a>. When such stars collapse, matter <a class="uri" href="densities" title="wikilink">densities</a> at the core becomes so high () that the <a href="degeneracy_pressure" title="wikilink">degeneracy</a> of electrons is not enough to prevent protons and electrons from combining to form a neutron and an electron neutrino. A second and more important neutrino source is the thermal energy (100 billion <a href="kelvin" title="wikilink">kelvins</a>) of the newly formed neutron core, which is dissipated via the formation of neutrino–antineutrino pairs of all flavors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>

<p>Colgate and White's theory of supernova neutrino production was confirmed in 1987, when neutrinos from <a href="SN_1987A" title="wikilink">supernova 1987A</a> were detected. The water-based detectors <a href="Kamiokande_II" title="wikilink">Kamiokande II</a> and <a href="Irvine–Michigan–Brookhaven_(detector)" title="wikilink">IMB</a> detected 11 and 8 antineutrinos of thermal origin,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> respectively, while the scintillator-based <a href="Baksan_Neutrino_Observatory" title="wikilink">Baksan</a> detector found 5 neutrinos (<a href="lepton_number" title="wikilink">lepton number</a> = 1) of either thermal or electron-capture origin, in a burst lasting less than 13 seconds. The neutrino signal from the supernova arrived at earth several hours before the arrival of the first electromagnetic radiation, as expected from the evident fact that the latter emerges along with the shock wave. The exceptionally feeble interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos to pass through the churning mass of the exploding star, while the electromagnetic photons were slowed.</p>

<p>Because neutrinos interact so little with matter, it is thought that a supernova's neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions of the explosion. Much of the <em>visible</em> light comes from the decay of radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any electromagnetic waves, including visible light, gamma rays or radio waves. The exact time delay depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type II supernova, astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the stellar core collapse, while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the surface of the star. The <a href="Supernova_Early_Warning_System" title="wikilink">SNEWS</a> project uses a network of neutrino detectors to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will provide a useful advance warning of a star exploding in the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Although neutrinos pass through the outer gases of a supernova without scattering, they provide information about the deeper supernova core with evidence that here, even neutrinos scatter to a significant extent. In a supernova core the densities are those of a neutron star (which is expected to be formed in this type of supernova),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> becoming large enough to influence the duration of the neutrino signal by delaying some neutrinos. The length of the neutrino signal from SN 1987A, some 13 seconds, was far longer than it would take in theory for neutrinos to pass directly through the neutrino-generating core of a supernova, expected to be only 32 kilometers in diameter SN 1987A. The number of neutrinos counted was also consistent with a total neutrino energy of 2.2 x 10<sup>46</sup> joules, which was estimated to be nearly all of the total energy of the supernova.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="supernova-remnants">Supernova remnants</h3>

<p>The energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV. However, the sites where <a href="cosmic_rays" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> are accelerated are expected to produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic, produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova explosions: the <a href="supernova_remnant" title="wikilink">supernova remnants</a>. The origin of the cosmic rays was attributed to supernovas by <a href="Walter_Baade" title="wikilink">Walter Baade</a> and <a href="Fritz_Zwicky" title="wikilink">Fritz Zwicky</a>; this hypothesis was refined by <a href="Vitaly_L._Ginzburg" title="wikilink">Vitaly L. Ginzburg</a> and <a href="Sergei_I._Syrovatsky" title="wikilink">Sergei I. Syrovatsky</a> who attributed the origin to supernova remnants, and supported their claim by the crucial remark, that the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way is compensated, if the efficiency of acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent. Ginzburg and Syrovatskii's hypothesis is supported by the specific mechanism of "shock wave acceleration" happening in supernova remnants, which is consistent with the original theoretical picture drawn by <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a>, and is receiving support from observational data. The very-high-energy neutrinos are still to be seen, but this branch of neutrino astronomy is just in its infancy. The main existing or forthcoming experiments that aim at observing very-high-energy neutrinos from our galaxy are <a href="Baikal_Deep_Underwater_Neutrino_Telescope" title="wikilink">Baikal</a>, <a href="Antarctic_Muon_And_Neutrino_Detector_Array" title="wikilink">AMANDA</a>, <a class="uri" href="IceCube" title="wikilink">IceCube</a>, <a href="ANTARES_(telescope)" title="wikilink">ANTARES</a>, <a href="Neutrino_Mediterranean_Observatory" title="wikilink">NEMO</a> and <a href="Nestor_Project" title="wikilink">Nestor</a>. Related information is provided by <a href="ultra-high-energy_gamma_ray" title="wikilink">very-high-energy gamma ray</a> observatories, such as <a class="uri" href="VERITAS" title="wikilink">VERITAS</a>, <a href="High_Energy_Stereoscopic_System" title="wikilink">HESS</a> and <a href="MAGIC_(telescope)" title="wikilink">MAGIC</a>. Indeed, the collisions of cosmic rays are supposed to produce charged pions, whose decay give the neutrinos, and also neutral pions, whose decay give gamma rays: the environment of a supernova remnant is transparent to both types of radiation.</p>

<p>Still-higher-energy neutrinos, resulting from the interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays, could be observed with the <a href="Pierre_Auger_Observatory" title="wikilink">Pierre Auger Observatory</a> or with the dedicated experiment named <a href="ANtarctic_Impulse_Transient_Antenna" title="wikilink">ANITA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="big-bang">Big Bang</h3>

<p>It is thought that, just like the <a href="cosmic_microwave_background_radiation" title="wikilink">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> left over from the <a href="Big_Bang" title="wikilink">Big Bang</a>, there is a background of low-energy neutrinos in our Universe. In the 1980s it was proposed that these may be the explanation for the <a href="dark_matter" title="wikilink">dark matter</a> thought to exist in the universe. Neutrinos have one important advantage over most other dark matter candidates: it is known that they exist. However, this idea also has serious problems.</p>

<p>From particle experiments, it is known that neutrinos are very light. This means that they easily move at speeds close to the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>. For this reason, dark matter made from neutrinos is termed "<a href="hot_dark_matter" title="wikilink">hot dark matter</a>". The problem is that being fast moving, the neutrinos would tend to have spread out evenly in the <a class="uri" href="universe" title="wikilink">universe</a> before cosmological expansion made them cold enough to congregate in clumps. This would cause the part of <a href="dark_matter" title="wikilink">dark matter</a> made of neutrinos to be smeared out and unable to cause the large <a href="galaxy" title="wikilink">galactic</a> structures that we see.</p>

<p>Further, these same galaxies and <a href="galaxy_groups_and_clusters" title="wikilink">groups of galaxies</a> appear to be surrounded by dark matter that is not fast enough to escape from those galaxies. Presumably this matter provided the gravitational nucleus for <a href="galaxy_formation_and_evolution" title="wikilink">formation</a>. This implies that neutrinos cannot make up a significant part of the total amount of dark matter.</p>

<p>From cosmological arguments, relic background neutrinos are estimated to have density of 56 of each type per cubic centimeter and temperature  () if they are massless, much colder if their mass exceeds . Although their density is quite high, they have not yet been observed in the laboratory, as their energy is below thresholds of most detection methods, and due to extremely low neutrino interaction cross-sections at sub-eV energies. In contrast, <a class="uri" href="boron-8" title="wikilink">boron-8</a> solar neutrinos—which are emitted with a higher energy—have been detected definitively despite having a space density that is lower than that of relic neutrinos by some 6 orders of magnitude.</p>
<h2 id="detection">Detection</h2>

<p>Neutrinos cannot be detected directly, because they do not ionize the materials they are passing through (they do not carry electric charge and other proposed effects, like the MSW effect, do not produce traceable radiation). A unique reaction to identify antineutrinos, sometimes referred to as <a href="inverse_beta_decay" title="wikilink">inverse beta decay</a>, as applied by Reines and Cowan (see below), requires a very large detector in order to detect a significant number of neutrinos. All detection methods require the neutrinos to carry a minimum threshold energy. So far, there is no detection method for low-energy neutrinos, in the sense that potential neutrino interactions (for example by the MSW effect) cannot be uniquely distinguished from other causes. Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the detector from <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> and other background radiation.</p>

<p>Antineutrinos were first detected in the 1950s near a nuclear reactor. <a href="Frederick_Reines" title="wikilink">Reines</a> and <a href="Clyde_Cowan" title="wikilink">Cowan</a> used two targets containing a solution of <a href="cadmium_chloride" title="wikilink">cadmium chloride</a> in water. Two scintillation detectors were placed next to the cadmium targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the threshold of  caused charged current interactions with the protons in the water, producing positrons and neutrons. This is very much like  decay, where energy is used to convert a proton into a neutron, a <a class="uri" href="positron" title="wikilink">positron</a> () and an <a href="electron_neutrino" title="wikilink">electron neutrino</a> () is emitted:</p>

<p>From known  decay:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Energy +  →  +  + 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In the Cowan and Reines experiment, instead of an outgoing neutrino, you have an incoming antineutrino () from a nuclear reactor:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Energy (&gt;) +  +  →  + 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The resulting positron annihilation with electrons in the detector material created photons with an energy of about . Pairs of photons in coincidence could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in gamma rays of about  that were detected a few microseconds after the photons from a positron annihilation event.</p>

<p>Since then, various detection methods have been used. <a href="Super_Kamiokande" title="wikilink">Super Kamiokande</a> is a large volume of water surrounded by <a href="photomultiplier_tube" title="wikilink">photomultiplier tubes</a> that watch for the <a href="Cherenkov_radiation" title="wikilink">Cherenkov radiation</a> emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a> or <a class="uri" href="muon" title="wikilink">muon</a> in the water. The <a href="Sudbury_Neutrino_Observatory" title="wikilink">Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</a> is similar, but uses <a href="heavy_water" title="wikilink">heavy water</a> as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects, but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of <a class="uri" href="chlorine" title="wikilink">chlorine</a> or <a class="uri" href="gallium" title="wikilink">gallium</a> which are periodically checked for excesses of <a class="uri" href="argon" title="wikilink">argon</a> or <a class="uri" href="germanium" title="wikilink">germanium</a>, respectively, which are created by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. <a class="uri" href="MINOS" title="wikilink">MINOS</a> uses a solid plastic <a class="uri" href="scintillator" title="wikilink">scintillator</a> coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while <a class="uri" href="Borexino" title="wikilink">Borexino</a> uses a liquid <a class="uri" href="pseudocumene" title="wikilink">pseudocumene</a> scintillator also watched by photomultiplier tubes and the proposed <a class="uri" href="NOνA" title="wikilink">NOνA</a> detector will use liquid scintillator watched by <a href="avalanche_photodiode" title="wikilink">avalanche photodiodes</a>. The <a href="IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory" title="wikilink">IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> uses  of the <a href="Antarctic_ice_sheet" title="wikilink">Antarctic ice sheet</a> near the <a href="south_pole" title="wikilink">south pole</a> with photomultiplier tubes distributed throughout the volume.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-for-scientific-interest">Motivation for scientific interest</h2>

<p>Neutrinos' low mass and neutral charge mean they interact exceedingly weakly with other particles and fields. This feature of weak interaction interests scientists because it means neutrinos can be used to probe environments that other radiation (such as light or radio waves) cannot penetrate.</p>

<p>Using neutrinos as a probe was first proposed in the mid-20th century as a way to detect conditions at the core of the Sun. The solar core cannot be imaged directly because electromagnetic radiation (such as light) is diffused by the great amount and density of matter surrounding the core. On the other hand, neutrinos pass through the Sun with few interactions. Whereas photons emitted from the solar core may require 40,000 years to diffuse to the outer layers of the Sun, neutrinos generated in stellar fusion reactions at the core cross this distance practically unimpeded at nearly the speed of light.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Neutrinos are also useful for probing astrophysical sources beyond the Solar System because they are the only known particles that are not significantly <a href="attenuation" title="wikilink">attenuated</a> by their travel through the interstellar medium. Optical photons can be obscured or diffused by dust, gas, and background radiation. High-energy <a href="cosmic_rays" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a>, in the form of swift protons and atomic nuclei, are unable to travel more than about 100 <a href="megaparsec" title="wikilink">megaparsecs</a> due to the <a href="Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin_limit" title="wikilink">Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit</a> (GZK cutoff). Neutrinos, in contrast, can travel even greater distances barely attenuated.</p>

<p>The galactic core of the <a href="Milky_Way" title="wikilink">Milky Way</a> is fully obscured by dense gas and numerous bright objects. Neutrinos produced in the galactic core might be measurable by Earth-based <a href="neutrino_telescope" title="wikilink">neutrino telescopes</a>.</p>

<p>Another important use of the neutrino is in the observation of <a href="supernova" title="wikilink">supernovae</a>, the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. The core collapse phase of a supernova is an extremely dense and energetic event. It is so dense that no known particles are able to escape the advancing core front except for neutrinos. Consequently, supernovae are known to release approximately 99% of their radiant energy in a short (10-second) burst of neutrinos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> These neutrinos are a very useful probe for core collapse studies.</p>

<p>The rest mass of the neutrino (see above) is an important test of cosmological and astrophysical theories (see <em><a href="Dark_matter" title="wikilink">Dark matter</a></em>). The neutrino's significance in probing cosmological phenomena is as great as any other method, and is thus a major focus of study in astrophysical communities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>The study of neutrinos is important in <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> because neutrinos typically have the lowest mass, and hence are examples of the lowest-energy particles theorized in extensions of the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of particle physics.</p>

<p>In November 2012 American scientists used a particle accelerator to send a coherent neutrino message through 780 feet of rock. This marks the first use of neutrinos for communication, and future research may permit binary neutrino messages to be sent immense distances through even the densest materials, such as the Earth's core.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
