<p>The <strong>slide rule</strong>, also known colloquially in the United States as a <strong>slipstick</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a mechanical <a href="analog_computer" title="wikilink">analog computer</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The slide rule is used primarily for <a class="uri" href="multiplication" title="wikilink">multiplication</a> and <a href="division_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">division</a>, and also for functions such as <a href="Nth_root" title="wikilink">roots</a>, <a href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithms</a> and <a class="uri" href="trigonometry" title="wikilink">trigonometry</a>, but is not normally used for <a class="uri" href="addition" title="wikilink">addition</a> or <a class="uri" href="subtraction" title="wikilink">subtraction</a>. Though similar in name and appearance to a standard <a class="uri" href="ruler" title="wikilink">ruler</a>, the slide rule is not ordinarily used for measuring length or drawing straight lines.</p>
<p>Slide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings (scales) essential to performing mathematical computations. Slide rules manufactured for specialized fields such as <a class="uri" href="aviation" title="wikilink">aviation</a> or <a class="uri" href="finance" title="wikilink">finance</a> typically feature additional scales that aid in calculations common to those fields.</p>
<p>The Reverend <a href="William_Oughtred" title="wikilink">William Oughtred</a> and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on <a class="uri" href="logarithms" title="wikilink">logarithms</a> by <a href="John_Napier" title="wikilink">John Napier</a>. Before the advent of the <a href="calculator" title="wikilink">pocket calculator</a>, it was the most commonly used calculation tool in <a class="uri" href="science" title="wikilink">science</a> and <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as <a href="computer" title="wikilink">digital computing devices</a> were being gradually introduced; but around 1974 the electronic <a href="scientific_calculator" title="wikilink">scientific calculator</a> made it largely obsolete<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and most suppliers left the business.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts</h2>
<p> In its most basic form, the slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More elaborate slide rules allow other calculations, such as <a href="square_root" title="wikilink">square roots</a>, <a href="exponential_function" title="wikilink">exponentials</a>, logarithms, and <a href="trigonometric_function" title="wikilink">trigonometric functions</a>.</p>
<p>Scales may be grouped in decades, which are numbers ranging from 1 to 10 (i.e. 10<sup>n</sup> to 10<sup>n+1</sup>). Thus single decade scales C and D range from 1 to 10 across the entire width of the slide rule while double decade scales A and B range from 1 to 100 over the width of the slide rule.</p>
<p>In general, mathematical calculations are performed by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with a mark on one of the fixed strips, and then observing the relative positions of other marks on the strips. <a href="Number" title="wikilink">Numbers</a> aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the <a href="product_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">product</a>, <a class="uri" href="quotient" title="wikilink">quotient</a>, or other calculated result.</p>
<p>The user determines the location of the <a href="decimal_point" title="wikilink">decimal point</a> in the result, based on mental estimation. <a href="Scientific_notation" title="wikilink">Scientific notation</a> is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. <a class="uri" href="Addition" title="wikilink">Addition</a> and <a class="uri" href="subtraction" title="wikilink">subtraction</a> steps in a calculation are generally done <a href="Mental_calculation" title="wikilink">mentally</a> or on paper, not on the slide rule.</p>
<p>Most slide rules consist of three linear strips of the same length, aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.</p>
<p>Some slide rules ("duplex" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip (which can usually be pulled out, flipped over and reinserted for convenience), still others on one side only ("simplex" rules). A sliding <a href="Wikt:cursor" title="wikilink">cursor</a> with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.</p>
<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>This slide rule is positioned to yield several values: From C scale to D scale (multiply by 2), from D scale to C scale (divide by 2), A and B scales (multiply and divide by 4), A and D scales (squares and square roots).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h3>
<p>A logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules <span class="LaTeX">$\log(xy) = \log(x) + \log(y)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\log(x/y) = \log(x) - \log(y)$</span>. Moving the top scale to the right by a distance of <span class="LaTeX">$\log(x)$</span>, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> on the bottom, aligns each number <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>, at position <span class="LaTeX">$\log(y)$</span> on the top scale, with the number at position <span class="LaTeX">$\log(x) + \log(y)$</span> on the bottom scale. Because <span class="LaTeX">$\log(x) + \log(y) = \log(xy)$</span>, this position on the bottom scale gives <span class="LaTeX">$xy$</span>, the product of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span>. For example, to calculate 3×2, the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top. This works because the distances from the "1" are proportional to the logarithms of the marked values:</p>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Slide rule example2 with labels.svg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Operations may go "off the scale;" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2×7. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively dividing by 10 (by subtracting the full length of the C-scale) and then multiplying by 7, as in the illustration below:</p>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>slide rule example3.svg</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2×7, but instead we calculated (2/10)×7=0.2×7=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2×7; some other methods are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the double-decade scales A and B.</li>
<li>Use the folded scales. In this example, set the left 1 of C opposite the 2 of D. Move the cursor to 7 on CF, and read the result from DF.</li>
<li>Use the CI inverted scale. Position the 7 on the CI scale above the 2 on the D scale, and then read the result off of the D scale below the 1 on the CI scale. Since 1 occurs in two places on the CI scale, one of them will always be on-scale.</li>
<li>Use both the CI inverted scale and the C scale. Line up the 2 of CI with the 1 of D, and read the result from D, below the 7 on the C scale.</li>
<li>Using a circular slide rule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.</p>
<h3 id="division">Division</h3>
<p>The illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.</p>

<h3 id="other-operations">Other operations</h3>
<p>In addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a> encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular were <a href="trigonometric_function" title="wikilink">trigonometric</a>, usually <a class="uri" href="sine" title="wikilink">sine</a> and <a href="tangent_(trigonometric_function)" title="wikilink">tangent</a>, <a href="common_logarithm" title="wikilink">common logarithm</a> (log) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), <a href="natural_logarithm" title="wikilink">natural logarithm</a> (ln) and <a href="exponential_function" title="wikilink">exponential</a> (<em>e<sup>x</sup></em>) scales. Some rules include a <a href="Pythagoras" title="wikilink">Pythagorean</a> scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating <a href="hyperbolic_functions" title="wikilink">hyperbolic functions</a>. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:</p>

<p>The Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to <a href="fraction_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fractions</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="roots-and-powers">Roots and powers</h4>
<p>There are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute <span class="LaTeX">$x^2$</span>, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.</p>
<p>For <span class="LaTeX">$x^y$</span> problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with <em>x</em> on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find <em>y</em> on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with <em>x</em> on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If <em>y</em> is "off the scale," locate <span class="LaTeX">$x^{y/2}$</span> and square it using the A and B scales as described above. Alternatively, use the rightmost 1 on the C scale, and read the answer off the next higher LL scale. For example, aligning the rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, 3 on the C scale lines up with 8 on the LL3 scale.</p>
<h4 id="trigonometry">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The S, T, and ST scales are used for trig functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees.</p>
<p>For angles from around 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by comparing the S scale with C (or D) scale; though on many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A scale instead, and what follows must be adjusted appropriately. The S scale has a second set of angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found by comparing the T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as <span class="LaTeX">$k\sin x$</span> can be read directly from <em>x</em> on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C-scale index is set at <em>k</em>. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/<a class="uri" href="radian" title="wikilink">radian</a>. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.</p>
<p>Many slide rules have S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes (e.g. some Keuffel and Esser models, late-model Teledyne-Post Mannheim-type rules). So-called <em>decitrig</em> models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.</p>
<h4 id="logarithms-and-exponentials">Logarithms and exponentials</h4>
<p>Base-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e. Logarithms to any other base can be calculated by reversing the procedure for calculating powers of a number. For example, log2 values can be determined by lining up either leftmost or rightmost 1 on the C scale with 2 on the LL2 scale, finding the number whose logarithm is to be calculated on the corresponding LL scale, and reading the log2 value on the C scale.</p>
<h4 id="addition-and-subtraction">Addition and subtraction</h4>
<p>Slide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$x + y = \left(\frac{x}{y} + 1\right) y.$$</span></p>
<p>For subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$x - y = \left(\frac{x}{y} - 1\right) y.$$</span></p>
<p>This method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the <a href="logarithmic_number_system" title="wikilink">logarithmic number system</a> in specialized computer applications like the <a href="Gravity_Pipe" title="wikilink">Gravity Pipe</a> (GRAPE) supercomputer and <a href="hidden_Markov_models" title="wikilink">hidden Markov models</a>.</p>
<p>The second method utilizes a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.</p>
<h2 id="physical-design">Physical design</h2>
<h3 id="standard-linear-rules">Standard linear rules</h3>
<p> The width of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal width of the scales. Scales on the most common "10-inch" models are actually 25 cm, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed. Pocket rules are typically 5 inches. Models a couple of metres wide were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two <a href="significant_figures" title="wikilink">significant figures</a>, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifier cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch.</p>
<p>Various other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called "Darmstadt" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often "split" to get higher accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="circular-slide-rules">Circular slide rules</h3>
<p>Circular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors (left), and another with a free dish and one cursor (right). The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by holding a fast angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The onefold cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.</p>
<p>The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the widest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by <a href="pi" title="wikilink">π</a>). For example, a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision approximately equal to a 31.4 cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate "off-scale" calculations, because the scales were designed to "wrap around"; they never have to be reoriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale width is narrowed to make room for end margins.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1 mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2mm worst case alignment error. The pivot, however, does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than "split" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.</p>
<p>One slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the <a class="uri" href="E6B" title="wikilink">E6B</a>. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for <a class="uri" href="aircraft" title="wikilink">aircraft</a> <a href="aviator" title="wikilink">pilots</a> to help with <a href="dead_reckoning" title="wikilink">dead reckoning</a>. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, <a class="uri" href="compass" title="wikilink">compass</a> errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called "prayer wheel" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While <a href="Global_Positioning_System" title="wikilink">GPS</a> has reduced the use of <a href="dead_reckoning" title="wikilink">dead reckoning</a> for <a href="air_navigation" title="wikilink">aerial navigation</a>, and handheld <a class="uri" href="calculators" title="wikilink">calculators</a> have taken over many of its functions, the <a class="uri" href="E6B" title="wikilink">E6B</a> remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.</p>
<p>Proportion wheels are simple circular slide rules used in graphic design to broaden or slim images and photographs. Lining up the desired values on the emmer and inner wheels (which correspond to the original and desired sizes) will display the proportion as a percentage in a small window. They are not as common since the advent of computerized layout, but are still made and used.</p>
<p>In 1952, <a href="Switzerland" title="wikilink">Swiss</a> watch company <a href="Breitling_SA" title="wikilink">Breitling</a> introduced a pilot's <a class="uri" href="wristwatch" title="wikilink">wristwatch</a> with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a "navigation computer", featured <a class="uri" href="airspeed" title="wikilink">airspeed</a>, <a href="rate_of_climb" title="wikilink">rate</a>/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer—<a href="nautical_mile" title="wikilink">nautical mile</a> and <a class="uri" href="gallon" title="wikilink">gallon</a>—<a href="litre" title="wikilink">liter</a> fuel amount conversion functions.</p>

<h3 id="cylindrical-slide-rules">Cylindrical slide rules</h3>
<p>There are two main types of cylindrical slide rules: those with helical scales such as the Fuller, the <a href="Otis_King" title="wikilink">Otis King</a> and the <a href="Bygrave_slide_rule" title="wikilink">Bygrave slide rule</a>, and those with bars, such as the Thacher and some Loga models. In either case, the advantage is a much longer scale, and hence potentially greater precision, than afforded by a straight or circular rule.</p>

<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>Traditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as <a class="uri" href="mahogany" title="wikilink">mahogany</a> or <a href="boxwood_(genus)" title="wikilink">boxwood</a> with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a>.</p>
<p>In 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from <a class="uri" href="bamboo" title="wikilink">bamboo</a>, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of <a class="uri" href="celluloid" title="wikilink">celluloid</a>, plastic, or painted <a class="uri" href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminium</a>. Later cursors were <a href="acryl_group" title="wikilink">acrylics</a> or <a href="polycarbonate" title="wikilink">polycarbonates</a> sliding on <a href="polytetrafluoroethylene" title="wikilink">Teflon</a> bearings.</p>
<p>All premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other <a class="uri" href="resin" title="wikilink">resin</a>. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool. For painted slide rules use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p> The slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after <a href="John_Napier" title="wikilink">John Napier</a>'s publication of the concept of the <a class="uri" href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithm</a>. <a href="Edmund_Gunter" title="wikilink">Edmund Gunter</a> of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by <a href="Edmund_Wingate" title="wikilink">Edmund Wingate</a> (c.1593–1656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled <em>L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie</em>. The book contains a double scale, logarithmic on one side, tabular on the other. In 1630, <a href="William_Oughtred" title="wikilink">William Oughtred</a> of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld <a href="Gunter's_scale" title="wikilink">Gunter rules</a> to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a>, Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students. Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student <a href="Richard_Delamain" title="wikilink">Richard Delamain</a> and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.</p>
<p>In 1677, <a href="Henry_Coggeshall" title="wikilink">Henry Coggeshall</a> created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the <a href="Coggeshall_slide_rule" title="wikilink">Coggeshall slide rule</a>, expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.</p>
<p>In 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a "polyphase" rule.</p>
<p>In 1815, <a href="Peter_Mark_Roget" title="wikilink">Peter Mark Roget</a> invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.</p>
<p>In 1821, <a href="Nathaniel_Bowditch" title="wikilink">Nathaniel Bowditch</a>, described in the <em><a href="American_Practical_Navigator" title="wikilink">American Practical Navigator</a></em> a "sliding rule" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.</p>
<p>In 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a Nautical Slide-Rule capable of answering navigation questions, including <a href="right_ascension" title="wikilink">right ascension</a> and <a class="uri" href="declination" title="wikilink">declination</a> of the sun and principal stars.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="modern-form">Modern form</h3>
<p> A more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant <a href="Amédée_Mannheim" title="wikilink">Amédée Mannheim</a>, "who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery." It was around this time that <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a> became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe–but not in the United States. There Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by <a href="Keuffel_and_Esser_Co." title="wikilink">Keuffel and Esser Co.</a> of New York.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Astronomical work also required fine computations, and in 19th-century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory. It had a <a class="uri" href="microscope" title="wikilink">microscope</a> attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession in the same way the <a class="uri" href="stethoscope" title="wikilink">stethoscope</a> is of the medical profession's. German rocket scientist <a href="Wernher_von_Braun" title="wikilink">Wernher von Braun</a> brought two 1930s vintage <em>Nestler</em> slide rules with him when he moved to the U.S. after World War 2 to work on the American space effort. Throughout his life he never used any other pocket calculating device, even heading the <a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a> program that landed a man on the moon in 1969.</p>
<p>Aluminium <a href="Pickett_Incorporated" title="wikilink">Pickett</a>-brand slide rules were carried on <a href="Project_Apollo" title="wikilink">Project Apollo</a> space missions. The model N600-ES owned by <a href="Buzz_Aldrin" title="wikilink">Buzz Aldrin</a> that flew with him to the moon on <a href="Apollo_11" title="wikilink">Apollo 11</a> was sold at auction in 2007.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The model N600-ES taken along on <a href="Apollo_13" title="wikilink">Apollo 13</a> in 1970 is owned by the <a href="National_Air_and_Space_Museum" title="wikilink">National Air and Space Museum</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Some engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, a common sight on campuses even into the mid-1970s. Until the advent of the pocket digital calculator students also might keep a ten- or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.</p>
<p>In 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on <em><a class="uri" href="prosthaphaeresis" title="wikilink">prosthaphaeresis</a></em>, an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. However, there has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="specialized-calculators">Specialized calculators</h3>
<p>Slide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use, such as excise, proof calculation, engineering, navigation, etc., but some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications. For example, the John Rabone & Sons 1892 catalog lists a "Measuring Tape and Cattle Gauge", a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements.</p>
<p>There were many specialized slide rules for <a href="photography" title="wikilink">photographic</a> applications; for example, the <a class="uri" href="actinograph" title="wikilink">actinograph</a> of <a href="Hurter_and_Driffield" title="wikilink">Hurter and Driffield</a> was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating exposure from time of day, time of year, and latitude.</p>
<p>Specialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the <a href="Fisher_Controls" title="wikilink">Fisher Controls</a> company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control <a href="valve" title="wikilink">valves</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the <a href="US_Navy" title="wikilink">U.S. Navy</a> actually designed a generic slide rule "chassis" with an aluminium body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for <a class="uri" href="aircraft" title="wikilink">aircraft</a>, and then adapted to many other purposes.</p>
<p>The <a href="E6B" title="wikilink">E6-B</a> is a circular slide rule used by pilots & navigators.</p>

<h3 id="decline">Decline</h3>
<p> The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as <a href="electronic_computer" title="wikilink">electronic computers</a>, a new but rare resource in the 1950s, became more widely available to technical workers during the 1960s. (See <a href="History_of_computing_hardware_(1960s–present)" title="wikilink">History of computing hardware (1960s–present)</a>.)</p>
<p>Computers also changed the nature of calculation. With slide rules a great emphasis was put on working the algebra to get expressions into the most computable form. Users would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify a calculation. <a class="uri" href="FORTRAN" title="wikilink">FORTRAN</a> allowed complicated formulas to be typed in from textbooks without the effort of reformulation. <a href="Numerical_integration" title="wikilink">Numerical integration</a> was often easier than trying to find <a href="Closed-form_expression" title="wikilink">closed-form</a> solutions for difficult problems. The young engineer asking for computer time to solve a problem that could have been done by a few swipes on the slide rule became a humorous cliché.</p>
<p>The availability of mainframe computing did not however significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule until cheap hand held electronic <a href="calculator" title="wikilink">calculators</a> for scientific and engineering purposes became available in the mid-1970s, at which point it rapidly declined. The first included the <a href="Wang_Laboratories" title="wikilink">Wang Laboratories</a> LOCI-2,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> introduced in 1965, which used <a href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithms</a> for multiplication and division and the <a class="uri" href="Hewlett-Packard" title="wikilink">Hewlett-Packard</a> HP-9100, introduced in 1968.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The HP-9100 had <a href="trigonometric_function" title="wikilink">trigonometric functions</a> (sin, cos, tan) in addition to exponentials and logarithms. It used the <a class="uri" href="CORDIC" title="wikilink">CORDIC</a> (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.</p>
<p>As calculator price declined geometrically and functionality increased exponentially the slide rule's fate was sealed. The pocket-sized Hewlett-Packard <a class="uri" href="HP-35" title="wikilink">HP-35</a> scientific calculator cost <a href="United_States_dollar" title="wikilink">US$</a>395 in 1972, too expensive for most students. By 1975 basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for less than $50, and by 1976 the <a class="uri" href="TI-30" title="wikilink">TI-30</a> scientific calculator could be purchased for less than $25.</p>
<h2 id="compared-to-electronic-digital-calculators">Compared to electronic digital calculators</h2>
<p> Most people find slide rules difficult to learn and use. Even during their heyday, they never caught on with the general public.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Addition and subtraction are not well-supported operations on slide rules and doing a calculation on a slide rule tends to be slower than on a calculator.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> This led engineers to take mathematical shortcuts favoring operations that were easy on a slide rule, creating inaccuracies and mistakes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> On the other hand, the spatial, manual operation of slide rules cultivates in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital calculators often lack.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> A slide rule will also display all the terms of a calculation along with the result, thus eliminating uncertainty about what calculation was actually performed.</p>
<p>A slide rule requires the user to separately compute the <a href="order_of_magnitude" title="wikilink">order of magnitude</a> of the answer in order to position the decimal point in the results. For example, 1.5 × 30 (which equals 45) will show the same result as 1,500,000 × 0.03 (which equals 45,000). This separate calculation is less likely to lead to extreme calculation errors, but forces the user to keep track of magnitude in <a href="short-term_memory" title="wikilink">short-term memory</a> (which is error-prone), keep notes (which is cumbersome) or reason about it in every step (which distracts from the other calculation requirements).</p>
<p>The typical <a href="Arithmetic_precision" title="wikilink">precision</a> of a slide rule is about three <a href="significant_digits" title="wikilink">significant digits</a>, compared to many digits on digital calculators. As order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule, users are less likely to make errors of <a href="false_precision" title="wikilink">false precision</a>.</p>
<p>When performing a sequence of multiplications or divisions by the same number, the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation. This can be especially useful when calculating percentages (e.g. for test scores) or when comparing prices (e.g. in dollars per kilogram). Multiple speed-time-distance calculations can be performed hands-free at a glance with a slide rule. Other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations.</p>
<p>Being entirely mechanical, a slide rule does not depend on <a class="uri" href="electricity" title="wikilink">electricity</a> or batteries. However, mechanical imprecision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors.</p>
<p>Many sailors keep slide rules as backups for navigation in case of electric failure or battery depletion on long route segments. Slide rules are still commonly used in aviation, particularly for smaller planes. They are being replaced only by integrated, special purpose and expensive flight computers, and not general-purpose calculators. The <a class="uri" href="E6B" title="wikilink">E6B</a> circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models. Some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations. The Citizen Skyhawk AT is a notable example.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-slide-rule-today">The slide rule today</h2>
<p> Even today some people prefer a slide rule over an electronic calculator as a practical computing device. Others keep their old slide rules out of a sense of nostalgia, or collect them as a hobby.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>A popular collectible model is the <a href="Keuffel_&_Esser" title="wikilink">Keuffel & Esser</a> <em>Deci-Lon</em>, a premium scientific and engineering slide rule available both in a ten-inch "regular" (<em>Deci-Lon 10</em>) and a five-inch "pocket" (<em>Deci-Lon 5</em>) variant. Another prized American model is the eight-inch Scientific Instruments circular rule. Of European rules, <a class="uri" href="Faber-Castell" title="wikilink">Faber-Castell</a>'s high-end models are the most popular among collectors.</p>
<p>Although there is a large supply of slide rules circulating on the market, specimens in good condition tend to be expensive. Many rules found for sale on <a href=":Category:online_auction_websites" title="wikilink">online auction sites</a> are damaged or have missing parts, and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information. Replacement parts are scarce, expensive, and generally available only for separate purchase on individual collectors' web sites. The Keuffel and Esser rules from the period up to about 1950 are particularly problematic, because the end-pieces on the cursors, made of <a class="uri" href="celluloid" title="wikilink">celluloid</a>, tend to chemically break down over time.</p>
<p>There are still a handful of sources for brand new slide rules. The Concise Company of Tokyo, which began as a manufacturer of circular slide rules in July 1954,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> continues to make and sell them today. In September 2009, on-line retailer <a class="uri" href="ThinkGeek" title="wikilink">ThinkGeek</a> introduced its own brand of straight slide rules, described as "faithful replica[s]" that are "individually hand tooled".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> These are no longer available in 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In addition, Faber-Castell has a number of slide rules still in inventory, available for international purchase through their web store.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Proportion wheels are still used in graphic design.</p>
<p>Various simulator apps are available for Android-based smart phones.</p>

"With computation moving literally at a hand's pace and the lack of precision a given, mathematicians worked to simplify complex problems. Because linear equations were friendlier to slide rules than more complex functions were, scientists struggled to linearize mathematical relations, often sweeping high-order or less significant terms under the computational carpet. So a car designer might calculate gas consumption by looking mainly at an engine's power, while ignoring how air friction varies with speed. Engineers developed shortcuts and rules of thumb. At their best, these measures led to time savings, insight and understanding. On the downside, these approximations could hide mistakes and lead to gross errors."<a href="#fnref30">↩</a></li>

"One effect was that users felt close to the numbers, aware of rounding-off errors and systematic inaccuracies, unlike users of today's computer-design programs. Chat with an engineer from the 1950s, and you will most likely hear a lament for the days when calculation went hand-in-hand with deeper comprehension. Instead of plugging numbers into a computer program, an engineer would understand the fine points of loads and stresses, voltages and currents, angles and distances.
