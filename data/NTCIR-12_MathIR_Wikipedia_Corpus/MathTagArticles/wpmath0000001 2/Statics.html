<h1>Statics</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Statics</strong> is the branch of <a class="uri" href="mechanics" title="wikilink">mechanics</a> that is concerned with the analysis of loads (<a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a> and <a href="torque" title="wikilink">torque, or "moment"</a>) on <a href="physical_system" title="wikilink">physical systems</a> in static equilibrium, that is, in a state where the relative positions of subsystems do not vary over time, or where components and structures are at a constant velocity. When in static equilibrium, the system is either at rest, or its <a href="center_of_mass" title="wikilink">center of mass</a> moves at constant velocity.</p>

<p>By <a href="Newton's_laws_of_motion" title="wikilink">Newton's first law</a>, this situation implies that the net force and net torque (also known as moment of force) on every part of the system is zero. From this constraint, such quantities as <a href="stress_(physics)" title="wikilink">stress</a> or <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> can be derived. The net forces equaling zero is known as the <em>first condition for equilibrium,</em> and the net torque equaling zero is known as the <em>second condition for equilibrium.</em> See <a href="statically_determinate" title="wikilink">statically determinate</a>.</p>

The sum of force and moment is zero.</a> A scalar is a quantity, such as <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> or <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a>, which only has a <a href="Scalar_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a>. A <a href="vector_(mathematics_and_physics)" title="wikilink">vector</a> has a magnitude and a direction and obeys the parallelogram law. There are several notations to identify a vector, including:</p>

<p>Vectors are added using the <a href="parallelogram_law" title="wikilink">parallelogram law</a> or the <a href="Euclidean_vector" title="wikilink">triangle law</a>. Vectors contain components in <a class="uri" href="orthogonal" title="wikilink">orthogonal</a> bases. Unit vectors <strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong>, and <strong>k</strong> are, by convention, <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">along the x, y, and z axes</a>, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="force">Force</h2>

<p><strong>Force</strong> is the action of one body on another. A force is either a push or a pull. A force tends to move a body in the direction of its action. The action of a force is characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its point of application. Thus force is a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction as well as on the magnitude of the action.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Forces are classified as either contact or body forces. A contact force is produced by direct physical contact; an example is the force exerted on a body by a supporting surface. A body force is generated by virtue of the position of a body within a force field such as a gravitational, electric, or magnetic field. An example of a body force is the weight of a body in the Earth's gravitational pull.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="moment-of-a-force">Moment of a force</h2>

<p>In addition to the tendency to move a body in the direction of its application, a force can also tend to rotate a body about an axis. The axis may be any line which neither intersects nor is parallel to the <a href="line_of_action" title="wikilink">line of action</a> of the force. This rotational tendency is known as the <em>moment</em> (<strong>M</strong>) of the force. Moment is also referred to as <em>torque</em>.</p>
<h3 id="moment-about-a-point">Moment about a point</h3>

<p>The magnitude of the moment of a force at a point O, is equal to the perpendicular distance from O to the line of action of F, multiplied by the magnitude of the force: M = F * d, where</p>

<p>F = the force applied<br/>
d = the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force. This perpendicular distance is called the moment arm.</p>

<p>The direction of the moment is given by the right hand rule, where counter clockwise (CCW) is out of the page, and clockwise (CW) is into the page. The moment direction may be accounted for by using a stated sign convention, such as a plus sign (+) for counterclockwise moments and a minus sign (‚àí) for clockwise moments, or vice versa. Moments can be added together as vectors.</p>

<p>In vector format, the moment can be defined as the <a href="cross_product" title="wikilink">cross product</a> between the radius vector, <strong>r</strong> (the vector from point O to the line of action), and the force vector, <strong>F</strong>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="varignons-theorem">Varignon's theorem</h3>

<p><a href="Varignon's_theorem_(mechanics)" title="wikilink">Varignon's theorem</a> states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of the components of the force about the same point.</p>
<h2 id="equilibrium-equations">Equilibrium equations</h2>

<p>The static equilibrium of a particle is an important concept in statics. A particle is in equilibrium only if the resultant of all forces acting on the particle is equal to zero. In a rectangular coordinate system the equilibrium equations can be represented by three scalar equations, where the sums of forces in all three directions are equal to zero. An engineering application of this concept is determining the tensions of up to three cables under load, for example the forces exerted on each cable of a hoist lifting an object or of <a href="guy_wires" title="wikilink">guy wires</a> restraining a <a href="hot_air_balloon" title="wikilink">hot air balloon</a> to the ground.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="moment-of-inertia">Moment of inertia</h2>

<p>In classical mechanics, <a href="moment_of_inertia" title="wikilink">moment of inertia</a>, also called mass moment, rotational inertia, polar moment of inertia of mass, or the angular mass, (SI units kg¬∑m¬≤) is a measure of an object's resistance to changes to its rotation. It is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in linear dynamics, describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity, torque and angular acceleration, and several other quantities. The symbols I and J are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia or polar moment of inertia.</p>

<p>While a simple scalar treatment of the moment of inertia suffices for many situations, a more advanced tensor treatment allows the analysis of such complicated systems as spinning tops and gyroscopic motion.</p>

<p>The concept was introduced by <a href="Leonhard_Euler" title="wikilink">Leonhard Euler</a> in his 1765 book <em>Theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum</em>; he discussed the moment of inertia and many related concepts, such as the principal axis of inertia.</p>
<h2 id="solids">Solids</h2>

<p>Statics is used in the analysis of structures, for instance in <a href="architectural_engineering" title="wikilink">architectural</a> and <a href="structural_engineering" title="wikilink">structural engineering</a>. <a href="Strength_of_materials" title="wikilink">Strength of materials</a> is a related field of mechanics that relies heavily on the application of static equilibrium. A key concept is the <a href="center_of_gravity" title="wikilink">center of gravity</a> of a body at rest: it represents an imaginary point at which all the <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> of a body resides. The position of the point relative to the <a href="Foundation_(engineering)" title="wikilink">foundations</a> on which a body lies determines its <a href="Stability_theory" title="wikilink">stability</a> in response to external forces. If the center of gravity exists outside the foundations, then the body is unstable because there is a torque acting: any small disturbance will cause the body to fall or topple. If the center of gravity exists within the foundations, the body is stable since no net torque acts on the body. If the center of gravity coincides with the foundations, then the body is said to be <a class="uri" href="metastable" title="wikilink">metastable</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fluids">Fluids</h2>

<p><a class="uri" href="Hydrostatics" title="wikilink">Hydrostatics</a>, also known as <a href="fluid_statics" title="wikilink">fluid statics</a>, is the study of fluids at rest (i.e. in static equilibrium). The characteristic of any fluid at rest is that the force exerted on any particle of the fluid is the same at all points at the same depth (or altitude) within the fluid. If the net force is greater than zero the fluid will move in the direction of the resulting force. This concept was first formulated in a slightly extended form by <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> and <a class="uri" href="philosopher" title="wikilink">philosopher</a> <a href="Blaise_Pascal" title="wikilink">Blaise Pascal</a> in 1647 and became known as <a href="Pascal's_Law" title="wikilink">Pascal's Law</a>. It has many important applications in <a class="uri" href="hydraulics" title="wikilink">hydraulics</a>. <a class="uri" href="Archimedes" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a>, <a href="Ab≈´_RayhƒÅn_al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´" title="wikilink">Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´</a>, <a class="uri" href="Al-Khazini" title="wikilink">Al-Khazini</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo Galilei</a> were also major figures in the development of hydrostatics.</p>
