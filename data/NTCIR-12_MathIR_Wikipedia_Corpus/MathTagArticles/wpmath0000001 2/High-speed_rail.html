<h1>High-speed rail</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>High-speed rail</strong> is a type of <a href="rail_transport" title="wikilink">rail transport</a> that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized <a href="rolling_stock" title="wikilink">rolling stock</a> and dedicated tracks. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the <a href="Tōkaidō_Shinkansen" title="wikilink">bullet train</a>. High-speed trains normally operate on <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a> tracks of <a href="continuously_welded_rail" title="wikilink">continuously welded rail</a> on <a href="Grade_separation" title="wikilink">grade-separated</a> <a href="Right-of-way_(transportation)" title="wikilink">right-of-way</a> that incorporates a large <a href="Minimum_railway_curve_radius" title="wikilink">turning radius</a> in its design.</p>

<p>Many countries have developed high-speed rail to connect major cities, including <a href="Railjet" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Belgium" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Britain</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_China" title="wikilink">China (PRC)</a>, <a href="TGV" title="wikilink">France</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Italy" title="wikilink">Italy</a>, <a href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Japan</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Portugal" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Russia" title="wikilink">Russia</a>, <a href="Korea_Train_Express" title="wikilink">South Korea</a>, <a href="AVE" title="wikilink">Spain</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Sweden" title="wikilink">Sweden</a>, <a href="Taiwan_High_Speed_Rail" title="wikilink">Taiwan (ROC)</a>, <a href="High-speed_rail_in_Turkey" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>, and <a href="Tashkent–Samarkand_high-speed_rail_line" title="wikilink">Uzbekistan</a>. Only in Europe does HSR cross international borders.</p>

<p>While high-speed rail is usually designed for passenger travel, some high-speed systems also offer <a class="uri" href="freight" title="wikilink">freight</a> service.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>Multiple definitions for high-speed rail are in use worldwide.</p>

<p>The <a href="Directive_(European_Union)" title="wikilink">European Union Directive</a> <a href="Trans-European_high-speed_rail_network" title="wikilink">96/48/EC, Annex 1</a> defines high-speed rail as a set of three elements with precise criteria:</p>

<p>:# <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> track built specially for high-speed travel or specially upgraded for high-speed travel.</p>

<p>:# <strong>Minimum Speed Limit:</strong> Minimum speed of  on lines specially built for high speed <em>and</em> of order  on existing lines which have been specially upgraded. This must apply to at least one section of the line. Rolling stock must have a minimum speed of at least  to be considered high speed.</p>

<p>:# <strong>Operating conditions:</strong> Rolling stock must be designed alongside its infrastructure for complete compatibility, safety and quality of service.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="International_Union_of_Railways" title="wikilink">International Union of Railways</a> (UIC) prefers to use "definitions" (plural) because they consider that there is no single standard definition of high-speed rail, nor even standard usage of the terms ("high speed", or "very high speed"). They make use of the European EC Directive 96/48, stating that high speed is a combination of all the elements which constitute the system: infrastructure, rolling stock and operating conditions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The <a href="International_Union_of_Railways" title="wikilink">International Union of Railways</a> states that high-speed rail is a set of unique features, not merely a train travelling above a particular speed. Many conventionally hauled trains are able to reach  in commercial service but are not considered to be high-speed trains. These include the French <a class="uri" href="SNCF" title="wikilink">SNCF</a> <a class="uri" href="Intercités" title="wikilink">Intercités</a> and German <a href="Deutsche_Bahn" title="wikilink">DB</a> <a href="Intercity_(Deutsche_Bahn)" title="wikilink">IC</a>.</p>

<p>National domestic standards may vary from the international ones.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Railways were the first form of rapid land transportation and had an effective monopoly on passenger traffic until the development of the <a href="automobile" title="wikilink">motor car</a> and <a class="uri" href="airliners" title="wikilink">airliners</a> in the early-mid 20th century. Speed had always been an important factor for railroads and they constantly tried to achieve higher speeds and decrease journey times. Rail transportation in the late 19th Century was not much slower than non high-speed trains today and many railroads regularly operated relatively fast <em>express</em> trains which averaged speeds of around .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-research">Early research</h3>

<p> </p>
<h4 id="first-experiments">First experiments</h4>

<p>High-speed rail development began in Germany in 1899 when the <a href="Prussian_state_railways" title="wikilink">Prussian state railway</a> joined with ten electrical and engineering firms and electrified  of military owned railway between <a class="uri" href="Marienfelde" title="wikilink">Marienfelde</a> and <a class="uri" href="Zossen" title="wikilink">Zossen</a>. The line used <a href="Three-phase_electric_power" title="wikilink">three-phase current</a> at <a href="Volt" title="wikilink">10 kilovolts</a> and <a href="Hertz" title="wikilink">45 Hz</a>.</p>

<p>The Van der Zypen &amp; Charlier company of <a href="Deutz,_Cologne" title="wikilink">Deutz, Cologne</a> built two railcars, one fitted with electrical equipment from <a href="Siemens_&amp;_Halske" title="wikilink">Siemens-Halske</a>, the second with equipment from <em><a href="AEG" title="wikilink">Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft</a></em> (AEG), that were tested on the <a class="uri" href="Marienfelde" title="wikilink">Marienfelde</a>–<a class="uri" href="Zossen" title="wikilink">Zossen</a> line during 1902 and 1903.</p>

<p>On 23 October 1903, the S&amp;H-equipped; railcar achieved a speed of  and on 27 October the AEG-equipped railcar achieved .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These trains demonstrated the feasibility of electric high-speed rail; however, regularly scheduled electric high-speed rail travel was still more than 30 years away.</p>
<h4 id="early-german-high-speed-network">Early German high-speed network</h4>

<p>On May 15, 1933, the <a href="Deutsche_Reichsbahn" title="wikilink">Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft</a> company introduced the diesel-powered "<a href="DRG_Class_SVT_877" title="wikilink">Fliegender Hamburger</a>" in regular service between <a href="Berlin–Hamburg_Railway" title="wikilink">Hamburg and Berlin</a> (286 km), thereby establishing the fastest regular service in the world, with a regular top speed of . This train was a streamlined multi-powered unit, albeit diesel, and used <a href="Jakobs_bogie" title="wikilink">Jakobs bogies</a> some 47 years before the advent of the TGV.</p>

<p>Following the success of the Hamburg line, the steam-powered <a href="Henschel-Wegmann_Train" title="wikilink">Henschel-Wegmann Train</a> was developed and introduced in June 1936 for service from <a class="uri" href="Berlin" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> to <a class="uri" href="Dresden" title="wikilink">Dresden</a>, with a regular top speed of .</p>

<p>Further development allowed the usage of these "Fliegenden Züge" (flying trains) on a rail network across Germany.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The "Diesel-Schnelltriebwagen-Netz" had been in the planning since 1934 but it never reached its envisaged size.</p>

<p>All high-speed service stopped in August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-american-streamliners">The American Streamliners</h4>

<p>On 26 May 1934, one year after Fliegender Hamburger introduction, the <a href="Chicago,_Burlington_and_Quincy_Railroad" title="wikilink">Burlington Railroad's</a> set an average speed record on long distance with their new streamlined train, the <a href="Pioneer_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Zephyr</a>, at  with peaks at . The Zephyr was made of stainless steel, and like the Fliegender Hamburger, was diesel powered, articulated with <a href="Jacobs_bogie" title="wikilink">Jacobs bogies</a>, and could reach  as commercial speed.</p>

<p>The new service was inaugurated 11 November 1934, traveling between <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City</a> and <a href="Lincoln,_Nebraska" title="wikilink">Lincoln</a>, but at a lower speed than the record, on average speed .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1935, the <a href="Chicago,_Milwaukee,_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Milwaukee Road</a> introduced the <a href="Hiawatha_(passenger_train)" title="wikilink">Morning Hiawatha</a> service, hauled at  by steam locomotives. These were the last "high-speed" trains to use steam power. In 1936, the <a href="Twin_Cities_Zephyr" title="wikilink">Twin Cities Zephyr</a> entered service, from Chicago to Minneapolis, with an average speed of .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-italian-electric-and-the-last-steam-record">The Italian electric and the last steam record</h4>

<p>The German high-speed service was followed in Italy in 1938 with an electric-multiple-unit <a href="ETR_200" title="wikilink">ETR 200</a>, designed for , between Bologna and Naples. It too reached  in commercial service, and achieved a world mean speed record of  near Milan in 1938.</p>

<p>In Great Britain in the same year, the streamlined <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a> <em><a href="LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard" title="wikilink">Mallard</a></em> achieved the official <a href="Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles" title="wikilink">world speed record</a> for <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotives</a> at . The external combustion engines and boilers on steam locomotives were large, heavy and time consuming to maintain, and the days of steam for high speed were numbered.</p>
<h4 id="the-introduction-of-the-talgo-system">The introduction of the Talgo system</h4>

<p>In 1945, a Spanish engineer, <a href="Alejandro_Goicoechea" title="wikilink">Alejandro Goicoechea</a>, developed a streamlined articulated train able to run on existing tracks at higher speeds than contemporary passenger trains. This was achieved by providing the locomotive and cars with a unique <a class="uri" href="axle" title="wikilink">axle</a> system that used one axle set per car end, connected by a Y-bar coupler. Amongst other advantages, the centre of mass was only half as high as usual.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This system became famous under the name of <a class="uri" href="Talgo" title="wikilink">Talgo</a> (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol), and for half a century was the main Spanish provider of high-speed trains.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-very-high-speed-records">The first very-high-speed records</h4>

<p> In the early 1950s, the French National Railway started to receive their new powerful <a href="SNCF_Class_CC_7100" title="wikilink">CC 7100</a> electric locomotives, and began to study and evaluate running at very high speeds. In 1954, the CC 7121 hauling a full train achieved a record  during a test on standard track. The next year, two specially tuned electric locomotives, the CC 7107 and the prototype BB 9001, broke previous speed records, reaching respectively  and , again on standard track.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> For the first time,  was surpassed, allowing the idea of regular very high-speed services to be developed.</p>

<p>New engineering studies began for this purpose. Especially, during the 1955 records, very dangerous <a href="hunting_oscillation" title="wikilink">hunting oscillation</a>, the swaying of the <a href="bogie" title="wikilink">bogies</a> which at high speed leads to dynamic instability and potential derailment, was discovered, which led to the use of <em><a href="Yaw_damper_(railroad)" title="wikilink">yaw dampers</a></em> to solve this problem, enabling safe running speeds above  today. Important research was also made about "current harnessing" at high-speed by the pantographs, that was solved 20 years later by the Zébulon TGV's prototype.</p>

<h4 id="japanese-research-and-development">Japanese research and development</h4>

<p>With some 45 million people living in the densely populated <a class="uri" href="Tokyo" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>-to-<a class="uri" href="Osaka" title="wikilink">Osaka</a> corridor, congestion on road and rail became a serious problem after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and the Japanese government began thinking seriously about a new high-speed rail service.</p>

<p>Japan in the 1950s was a populous, resource-limited nation that for security reasons did not want to import <a class="uri" href="petroleum" title="wikilink">petroleum</a>, but needed a way to transport its millions of people in and between cities.</p>

<p><a href="Japanese_National_Railways" title="wikilink">Japanese National Railways</a> (JNR) engineers then began to study the development of a high-speed regular mass transit service. In 1955, they were present at the <a class="uri" href="Lille" title="wikilink">Lille</a>'s Electrotechnology Congress in France, and during a 6-month visit, the head engineer of JNR accompanied the deputy director Marcel Tessier at the DETE (<a class="uri" href="SNCF" title="wikilink">SNCF</a> Electric traction study department).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> JNR engineers returned to Japan with a number of ideas and technologies they would use on their future trains, including alternating current for rail traction, and international standard gauge.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-narrow-gauge-japanese-high-speed-service">The first narrow-gauge Japanese high-speed service</h4>

<p>In 1957, the engineers at the private <a href="Odakyu_Electric_Railway" title="wikilink">Odakyu Electric Railway</a> in <a href="Greater_Tokyo_area" title="wikilink">Greater Tokyo area</a> launched the <a href="Odakyu_3000_series_SE" title="wikilink">Odakyu 3000 series SE</a> EMU. This EMU set a world record for <a href="narrow_gauge" title="wikilink">narrow gauge</a> trains at , giving the Odakyu engineers confidence they could safely and reliably build even faster trains at standard gauge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The original Japanese railways generally used narrow gauge, but the increased stability offered by widening the rails to <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a> would make very high-speed rail much simpler, and thus <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a> was adopted for high-speed service.</p>
<h4 id="a-new-train-on-a-new-line">A new train on a new line</h4>

<p>The new service, named <a class="uri" href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Shinkansen</a> (meaning <em>new trunk line</em>) would provide a new alignment, 25% wider standard gauge, continuously welded rails between Tokyo and Osaka using new rolling stock, designed for . However, the <a href="World_Bank" title="wikilink">World Bank</a>, whilst supporting the project, considered the design of the equipment as unproven for that speed, and set the maximum speed to .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>After initial feasibility tests, the plan was fast-tracked and construction of the first section of the line started on 20 April 1959.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1963, on the new track, test runs hit a top speed of . Five years after the beginning of the construction work, in October 1964, just in time for the <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympic Games</a>, the first modern high-speed rail, the <a href="Tōkaidō_Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Tōkaidō Shinkansen</a>, was opened between the two cities.</p>

<p>The first Shinkansen trains, the <a href="0_Series_Shinkansen" title="wikilink">0 Series Shinkansen</a>, built by <a href="Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries" title="wikilink">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a>—in English often called "Bullet Trains", after the original Japanese name —outclassed the earlier fast trains in commercial service. They traversed the  distance in 3 hours 10 minutes, reaching a top speed of  and sustaining an average speed of  with stops at Nagoya and Kyoto.</p>
<h4 id="a-great-success">A great success</h4>

<p>But the speed was only a part of the Shinkansen revolution: the Shinkansen offered high-speed rail travel to the masses. The first <em>Bullet trains</em> had 12 cars and later versions had up to 16,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and double-deck trains further increased the capacity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>After three years, more than 100 million passengers had used the trains, and the milestone of the first one billion passengers was reached in 1976. In 1972, the line was extended a further , and further construction has resulted in the network expanding to  as at March 2015, with a further  of extensions currently under construction and due to open in stages between March 2016 and 2035. The cumulative patronage on the entire system since 1964 is over 10 billion, the equivalent of approximately 150% of the world's population, without a single train passenger fatality. (Suicides, passengers falling off the platforms, and industrial accidents have resulted in fatalities).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Since their introduction, Japan's Shinkansen systems have been undergoing constant improvement, not only increasing line speeds. Over a dozen train models have been produced, addressing diverse issues such as <a href="tunnel_boom" title="wikilink">tunnel boom</a> noise, vibration, aerodynamic drag, lines with lower patronage ("Mini shinkansen"), earthquake and typhoon safety, braking distance, problems due to snow, and energy consumption (newer trains are twice as energy efficient as the initial ones despite greater speeds).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>In Europe, high-speed rail began during the International Transport Fair in <a class="uri" href="Munich" title="wikilink">Munich</a> in June 1965, when Dr Öpfering, the director of <a href="Deutsche_Bundesbahn" title="wikilink">Deutsche Bundesbahn</a> (German Federal Railways), performed 347 demonstrations at  between Munich and <a class="uri" href="Augsburg" title="wikilink">Augsburg</a> by <a href="DB_Class_103" title="wikilink">DB Class 103</a> hauled trains.

<p>In 1966, French Infrastructure Minister Edgar Pisani consulted engineers and gave the French National Railways twelve months to raise speeds to .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The classic line <a class="uri" href="Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a>–<a class="uri" href="Toulouse" title="wikilink">Toulouse</a> was chosen, and fitted, to support  rather than . Some improvements were set, notably the signals system, development of on board "in-cab" signalling system, and curve revision.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="SNCF_Class_CC_7100#Speed_records" title="wikilink">1955 records</a>, two divisions of the <a class="uri" href="SNCF" title="wikilink">SNCF</a> began to study high-speed services. In 1964, the DETMT (petrol-engine traction studies department of SNCF) planned the use of <a href="gas_turbine" title="wikilink">gas turbines</a> : a diesel-powered railcar is modified with a gas-turbine, and is called "TGV" (Turbotrain Grande Vitesse).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> It reached  in 1967, and served as a basis for the future Turbotrain and the real TGV.

<h4 id="the-gas-turbine">The gas-turbine</h4>

<p>In 1969, the "C03 project" was transferred to public administration while a contract with <a href="Alstom" title="wikilink">Alsthom</a> was signed for them to build two gas-turbine high-speed train prototypes, named "TGV 001". The prototype consisted of a set of five carriages, plus a <a href="power_car" title="wikilink">power car</a> at each end, both powered by two gas-turbine engines. The sets used <a href="Jacobs_bogie" title="wikilink">Jacobs bogies</a>, which reduce drag and increase safety.</p>

At that time, the classic Paris-Lyon line was already congested and a new line was required; this busy corridor, neither too short (where car is preferred) nor too long (where planes are better), was the best choice for the new service.</p>

<p>The 1973 oil shock substantially increases oil prices. In the continuity of the <a href="Charles_de_Gaulle" title="wikilink">De Gaulle</a> "energy self-sufficiency" and nuclear-energy policy, a ministry decision switched the future TGV from now costly gas-turbine to full electric energy in 1974. An electric railcar named <em>Zébulon</em> was developed for testing at very high speeds, reaching a speed of . It was used to develop pantographs capable of withstanding speeds of over .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>After intensive tests with the gas-turbine "TGV 001" prototype, and the electric "Zébulon", in 1977, the SNCF placed an order to the group <a class="uri" href="Alstom" title="wikilink">Alstom</a>–<a class="uri" href="Francorail" title="wikilink">Francorail</a>–<a href="Matériel_de_Traction_Électrique" title="wikilink">MTE</a> for 87 <a href="SNCF_TGV_Sud-Est" title="wikilink">TGV Sud-Est</a> trainsets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> They used the "TGV 001" concept, with a permanently coupled set of eight cars, sharing "<a href="Jacobs_bogie" title="wikilink">Jacobs bogies</a>", and hauled by two electric power-cars, one at each end.</p>

<p>In 1981, the first section of the new <a href="LGV_Sud-Est" title="wikilink">Paris–Lyon High-Speed line</a> was inaugurated, with a  top speed (then  soon after). With a far greater top speed, a new dedicated high-speed line, and a complete compatibility with existing old lines, the TGV offered the ability to join every city in the country, using alternatively standard and high-speed line, in a shorter time than ever.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> After the introduction of the TGV on some routes, air traffic on these routes decreased, or even disappeared.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> At the same time, the TGV made history with its multiple, highly publicized <a href="TGV_world_speed_record" title="wikilink">speed records</a>: in 1981 with a record at , in 1990 at , and then in 2007 at .</p>

<p>Following the French TGV, in 1991 Germany was the second country in Europe to inaugurate a high-speed rail service, with the launch of the <a class="uri" href="Intercity-Express" title="wikilink">Intercity-Express</a> (ICE) on the new <a href="Hanover–Würzburg_high-speed_railway" title="wikilink">Hannover-Würzburg high-speed railway</a>, operating at a top speed of . The German ICE train was similar to the TGV, with dedicated streamlined power cars at both ends, but a variable number of trailers between them. Unlike the TGV, the trailers had two conventional bogies per car, and could be uncoupled, allowing the train to be lengthened or shortened. This introduction was the result of ten years of study with the ICE-V prototype, which broke the world speed record in 1988, reaching .</p>

<p>In 1992, just in time for the <a href="1992_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">Barcelona Olympic Games</a> and <a href="Seville_Expo_'92" title="wikilink">Seville Expo '92</a>, the <a href="Madrid–Seville_high-speed_rail_line" title="wikilink">Madrid–Seville high-speed rail line</a> opened in Spain with <a href="25_kV_AC" title="wikilink">25 kV AC</a> electrification, and <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a>, differing from all other Spanish lines which used <a href="Iberian_gauge" title="wikilink">Iberian gauge</a>. This allowed the <a class="uri" href="AVE" title="wikilink">AVE</a> rail service to begin operations using <a href="AVE_Class_100" title="wikilink">Class 100</a> train sets built by Alstom, directly derived in design from the French TGV trains. The service was very popular and development continued on <a href="high-speed_rail_in_Spain" title="wikilink">high-speed rail in Spain</a>.</p>

<p>In 2005, the Spanish Government announced an ambitious plan, (PEIT 2005–2020)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> envisioning that by 2020, 90 percent of the population would live within  of a station served by <a class="uri" href="AVE" title="wikilink">AVE</a>. Spain began building the largest HSR network in Europe: as of 2011, five of the new lines have opened (Madrid-Zaragoza-Lleida-Tarragona-Barcelona, Córdoba- Malaga, Madrid-Toledo, Madrid-Segovia-Valladolid, Madrid-Cuenca-Valencia) and another  were under construction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1992, the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a> authorized the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act to focus on <a class="uri" href="Amtrak" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a>'s service improvement on the segment between <a class="uri" href="Boston" title="wikilink">Boston</a> and <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> of the <a href="Northeast_Corridor" title="wikilink">Northeast Corridor</a>. The primary objectives were to electrify the line north of <a href="New_Haven,_Connecticut" title="wikilink">New Haven, Connecticut</a> and replace the then 30-year-old Metroliners with new trains to achieve shorter travel time.</p>

<p>Amtrak started testing two trains, the Swedish <a href="SJ_2000" title="wikilink">X2000</a> and the German <a href="ICE_train" title="wikilink">ICE 1</a>, in the same year along its fully electrified segment between New York City and <a href="Washington_DC" title="wikilink">Washington DC</a>. The officials favored the X2000 as it had a tilting mechanism. However, the Swedish manufacturer never bid on the contract as the burdensome United States railroad regulations required them to heavily modify the train resulting in added weight among other things. Eventually, a custom-made <a href="tilting_train" title="wikilink">tilting train</a> derived from TGV, manufactured by <a class="uri" href="Alstom" title="wikilink">Alstom</a> and <a href="Bombardier_Transportation" title="wikilink">Bombardier</a>, won the contract and was put into service in December 2000.</p>

The service did not meet the 3-hour travel time objective, between Boston and New York City.

<h4 id="the-south-korean-ktx">The South Korean KTX</h4>

<p> In South Korea, <a href="Korea_Train_Express" title="wikilink">Korea Train Express (KTX)</a> services were launched on 1 April 2004, on the Seoul-Busan corridor, Korea's busiest traffic corridor, between the two largest cities. In 1982, it represented 65.8% of South Korea's population, a number that grew to 73.3% by 1995, along with 70% of freight traffic and 66% of passenger traffic. With both the <a href="Gyeongbu_Expressway" title="wikilink">Gyeongbu Expressway</a> and <a class="uri" href="Korail" title="wikilink">Korail</a>'s <a href="Gyeongbu_Line" title="wikilink">Gyeongbu Line</a> congested as of the late 1970s, the government saw the pressing need for another form of transportation.</p>

<p>Construction began on the high-speed line from <a class="uri" href="Seoul" title="wikilink">Seoul</a> to <a class="uri" href="Busan" title="wikilink">Busan</a> in 1992 with the first commercial service launching in 2004.

The initial rolling stock was based on <a class="uri" href="Alstom" title="wikilink">Alstom</a>'s <a href="SNCF_TGV_Réseau" title="wikilink">TGV Réseau</a>, and was partly built in Korea. The domestically developed <a class="uri" href="HSR-350x" title="wikilink">HSR-350x</a>, which achieved  in tests, resulted in a second type of high-speed trains now operated by Korail, the <a href="KTX_Sancheon" title="wikilink">KTX Sancheon</a>.

<h4 id="the-chinese-crh">The Chinese CRH</h4>

<p>High-speed rail was introduced to China only in the last 20 years but has rapidly developed into the <a href="High-speed_rail_by_country#High_Speed_Rail_by_Country" title="wikilink">world's most extensive network</a>. As of December 2013, the country had  of track in operation, accounting for about half of the world's total at the time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 2013, high-speed trains carried 530 million passenger-trips, about one quarter of all train trips taken in China that year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>State planning for high-speed railway began in the early 1990s, and the country's first high-speed rail line, the <a href="Qinhuangdao–Shenyang_Passenger_Railway" title="wikilink">Qinhuangdao–Shenyang Passenger Railway</a>, was built in 1999 and opened to commercial operation in 2003. This line could accommodate commercial trains running at up to . Planners also considered <a class="uri" href="Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a>'s <a class="uri" href="Transrapid" title="wikilink">Transrapid</a> <a class="uri" href="maglev" title="wikilink">maglev</a> technology and built the <a href="Shanghai_Maglev_Train" title="wikilink">Shanghai Maglev Train</a>, which runs on a  track linking the <a href="Shanghai" title="wikilink">city</a> and its <a href="Pudong_International_Airport" title="wikilink">international airport</a>. The maglev train service began operating in 2004 with trains reaching a top speed of , and remains the fastest high-speed service in the world. Maglev, however, was not adopted nationally and all subsequent expansion features high-speed rail on conventional tracks.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, China's domestic train production industry designed and produced <a href="Fastest_trains_in_China" title="wikilink">a series of high-speed train prototypes</a> but few were used in commercial operation and none were mass-produced. The Chinese Ministry of Railways (MOR) then arranged for the purchase of foreign high-speed trains from French, German, and Japanese manufacturers along with certain technology transfers and joint ventures with domestic trainmakers. In 2007, the MOR introduced the <a href="China_Railway_High-speed" title="wikilink">China Railways High-speed (CRH)</a> service, also known as "Harmony Trains" (和谐号), using trains with foreign technology.</p>

<p>In 2008, high-speed trains began running at a top speed of  on the <a href="Beijing–Tianjin_Intercity_Railway" title="wikilink">passenger dedicated line between Beijing and Tianjin</a>, which opened during the <a href="2008_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games</a>. The following year, trains on the newly opened <a href="Wuhan–Guangzhou_High-Speed_Railway" title="wikilink">Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway</a> set a world record for average speed over an entire trip, at 312.5 km/h (194.2 mph) over 968 km (601 mi.). In July 2011, however, top train speeds were lowered to .</p>

<p>A <a href="Wenzhou_train_collision" title="wikilink">collision of high-speed trains</a> on 23 July 2011 in eastern China, which killed 40 and injured 195, raised concerns about operational safety. A credit crunch later that year slowed the construction of new lines. But by 2012, the high-speed rail boom had renewed with new lines and new rolling stock by domestic producers that had indigenized foreign technology. On 25 December 2012, China opened the <a href="Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong_Kong_High-Speed_Railway" title="wikilink">world's longest high-speed rail line</a>, which runs  from the country's capital <a href="Beijing_West_Railway_Station" title="wikilink">Beijing</a> in the north to <a href="Shenzhen_North_Railway_Station" title="wikilink">Shenzhen</a> on the southern coast.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The network is still rapidly expanding to create the <a href="High-speed_rail_in_China#National_high-speed_rail_grid_(4+4)" title="wikilink">4+4 National High Speed Rail Grid</a> by 2015.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="dedicated-tracks">Dedicated tracks</h4>

<p> As defined by Europe and UIC, generally the high-speed rail is a set including a high-speed rolling-stock and a dedicated high-speed line.</p>

<p>Japan was the first nation to build a totally new and dedicated lines and network for its Shinkansen. It was followed by France, then Germany, Spain, etc. Most countries today with high-speed rail have dedicated high-speed tracks. Notable exceptions are the USA and Russia. In certain cases, in particular in England in the 1970s for the HST, and in China recently, classic old lines have been upgraded to support new high-speed trains, often up to . For unconventional trains, such as Aérotrains and Maglev, the use of viaduct-dedicated tracks is necessary.</p>
<h4 id="tracks-design">Tracks design</h4>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>A German high-speed line, with tracks directly on concrete tiles</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="Continuous_welded_rail" title="wikilink">Continuous welded rail</a> is generally used to reduce track vibrations and misalignment. Almost all high-speed lines are electrically driven via overhead cables, have <a href="in-cab_signalling" title="wikilink">in-cab signalling</a>, and use advanced switches using very low entry and <a href="Switch_frog" title="wikilink">frog</a> angles.</p>

<p>Constrictions, such as at-grade crossings, where lines intersect other lines and/or roadways are eliminated. For this reason, Japan and China typically build their high-speed lines on elevated viaducts. High-speed lines avoid tight curves, which reduce speed. Curve radius is typically above , and for lines supporting  speeds, typically at . The lines may rest on <a href="Track_(rail_transport)#Traditional_track_structure" title="wikilink">traditional sleeper and ballast</a> or on concrete tiles and fences prevent access to the tracks on foot.</p>
<h4 id="road-rail-parallel-layout">Road-rail parallel layout</h4>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>A German high-speed line being built along a highway</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Road Rail Parallel Layout uses land beside highways for railway lines. Examples include Paris/Lyon and <a href="Köln–Frankfurt_high-speed_rail_line" title="wikilink">Köln - Frankfurt</a> in which 15% and 70% of the track runs beside highways, respectively.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="track-sharing">Track sharing</h4>

<p>High-speed lines may be exclusive or open to standard speed trains.</p>
<ul>
<li>In France, high-speed lines use standard gauge like the rest of the network, but are used only by passenger TGV, and by the Postal TGV.</li>
<li>In Germany, high-speed lines are shared between ICE, international high-speed trains, regional trains and freight trains.</li>
<li>In China, high-speed lines at speeds between  may carry freight or passengers., <a href="High-speed_rail_in_China" title="wikilink">Lines</a> operating at speeds of  are used only by passenger CRH trains.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></li>
<li>In Japan and Spain, high-speed lines use standard gauge as opposed to the rest of their respective networks and are thus dedicated to high-speed trains.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing a line between fast and slow traffic reduces its maximum carrying capacity by a very large factor, by forcing much longer intervals between trains at the two different speeds.</p>
<h4 id="construction-costs">Construction costs</h4>

<p>Japanese systems are often more expensive than their counterparts, because they run on dedicated elevated guideways, avoid traffic crossings and incorporate disaster monitoring systems. The largest part of Japan's cost is for boring tunnels through mountains, as was also true in <a class="uri" href="Taiwan" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>.</p>

<p>In France, the cost of construction (which was €10 million/km (US$15.1 million/km) for <a href="LGV_Est" title="wikilink">LGV Est</a>) is minimized by adopting steeper grades rather than building tunnels and viaducts. However, in mountainous Switzerland, tunnels are inevitable. Because the lines are dedicated to passengers, gradients of 3.5%, rather than the previous maximum of 1–1.5% for mixed traffic, are used. More expensive land may be required in order to minimize curves. This increases speed, reduces construction costs and lowers operating and maintenance costs. In other countries high-speed rail was built without those economies so that the railway can also support other traffic, such as freight.</p>

<p>Experience has shown however, that running trains of significantly different speeds on one line substantially decreases capacity. As a result, mixed-traffic lines usually reserve daytime for high-speed trains and run freight at night.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-stock">Rolling stock</h2>

<p>Key technologies include tilting trainsets, aerodynamic designs (to reduce drag, lift, and noise), <a href="Railway_air_brake" title="wikilink">air brakes</a>, <a href="regenerative_braking" title="wikilink">regenerative braking</a>, engine technology and <a href="dynamic_weight_shifting" title="wikilink">dynamic weight shifting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-with-other-modes-of-transport">Comparison with other modes of transport</h2>
<h3 id="optimal-distance">Optimal distance</h3>

<p>While commercial high-speed trains have lower maximum speeds than jet aircraft, they offer shorter total trip times than air travel for short distances. They typically connect city centre rail stations to each other, while air transport connects airports that are typically farther from city centres.</p>

<p>High-speed rail (HSR) is best suited for journeys of 1 to 4½ hours (about ), for which the train can beat air and car trip time. For trips under about , the process of checking in and going through airport security, as well as traveling to and from the airport, makes the total air journey time equal to or slower than HSR. European authorities treat HSR as competitive with passenger air for HSR trips under 4½ hours.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>HSR eliminated most air transport from between Paris-Lyon, Paris-Brussels, Cologne-Frankfurt, Madrid-Barcelona, Nanjing-Wuhan, Chongqing-Chengdu,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Tokyo-Nagoya, Tokyo-Sendai and Tokyo-Niigata. China Southern Airlines, China's largest airline, expects the construction of China's high-speed railway network to impact 25% of its route network in the coming years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="market-shares">Market shares</h3>

<p>European data indicate that air traffic is more sensitive than road traffic (car and bus) to competition from HSR, at least on journeys of  and more – perhaps because cars and buses are far more flexible than planes, though cost certainly plays a part as well. TGV Sud-Est reduced the travel time Paris–Lyon from almost four to about two hours. Market share rose from 40 to 72%. Air and road market shares shrunk from 31 to 7% and from 29 to 21%, respectively. On the Madrid–Sevilla link, the AVE connection increased share from 16 to 52%; air traffic shrunk from 40 to 13%; road traffic from 44 to 36%, hence the rail market amounted to 80% of combined rail and air traffic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> This figure increased to 89% in 2009, according to Spanish rail operator <a class="uri" href="RENFE" title="wikilink">RENFE</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Peter Jorritsma, the rail market share <em>s</em>, as compared to planes, can be computed approximately as a function of the travelling time in minutes <em>t</em> by the formula<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="energy-efficiency">Energy efficiency</h3>

<p>Travel by rail is more competitive in areas of higher population density or where gasoline is expensive, because conventional trains are more fuel-efficient than cars when ridership is high, similar to other forms of mass transit. Very few high-speed trains consume <a href="diesel_fuel" title="wikilink">diesel</a> or other <a href="fossil_fuel" title="wikilink">fossil fuels</a> but the power stations that provide electric trains with power can consume fossil fuels. In Japan and France, with very extensive high-speed rail networks, a large proportion of electricity comes from <a href="nuclear_power" title="wikilink">nuclear power</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> On the Eurostar, which primarily runs off the French grid, emissions from travelling by train from London to Paris are 90% lower than by flying.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Even using electricity generated from coal or oil, high-speed trains are significantly more fuel-efficient per passenger per kilometre traveled than the typical automobile because of <a href="economies_of_scale" title="wikilink">economies of scale</a> in generator technology<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> as well as lower air friction at the same speed. Rail networks, like highways, require large fixed capital investments and thus require a blend of high density and government investment to be competitive against existing capital infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="automobiles-and-buses">Automobiles and buses</h3>

<p>High-speed rail can accommodate more passengers at far higher speeds than automobiles. Generally, the longer the journey, the better the time advantage of rail over road if going to the same destination. However, high-speed rail can be competitive with cars on shorter distances, , for example for commuting, given road congestion or expensive parking fees.</p>

<p>Moreover, typical passenger rail carries 2.83 times as many passengers per hour per metre width as a road. A typical capacity is the <a href="Eurostar#Rolling_stock" title="wikilink">Eurostar</a>, which provides capacity for 12 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train, totaling 9,600 passengers per hour in each direction. By contrast, the <a href="Highway_Capacity_Manual" title="wikilink">Highway Capacity Manual</a> gives a maximum capacity of 2,250 passenger cars per hour per lane, excluding other vehicles. Assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57 people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> A standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way), while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometre of direct/indirect land consumption). The Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, has a much higher ratio (with as many as 20,000 passengers per hour per direction). Similarly commuter roads tend to carry fewer than 1.57 persons per vehicle (Washington State Department of Transportation, for instance, uses 1.2 persons per vehicle) during commute times.</p>
<h3 id="air-travel">Air travel</h3>

<p>Although air transit moves at higher speeds, its total time to destination can be increased by check-in, baggage handling, security and boarding. These procedures also add cost to air travel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Trains are preferred in shorter, mid range distances since rail stations are typically closer to urban centers than airports.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Likewise, air travel needs longer distances to have a speed advantage after accounting for both processing time and travel to the airport.</p>

<p>Rail travel also requires less weather dependency than air travel. A well designed and operated rail system can only be affected by severe weather conditions, such as heavy snow, heavy fog, and major storm. Flights however, generally face cancellations or delays under less severe conditions. High-speed trains also have comfort advantages, since train passengers are allowed to move freely about the train at any point in the journey.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The seats are also less subject to weight restrictions than on planes, and as such may have more padding and legroom. Technology advances such as <a href="continuously_welded_rail" title="wikilink">continuously welded rail</a> have minimized the <a href="Hunting_oscillation" title="wikilink">vibration</a> found on slower railways, while air travel remains affected by <a class="uri" href="turbulence" title="wikilink">turbulence</a> when adverse wind conditions arise. Trains can also accommodate intermediate stops at lower time and energetic costs than planes, though this applies less to HSR than to the slower conventional trains.</p>

<p>On particular busy air-routes - those that HSR has historically been most successful on - trains are also less prone to delays due to congested airports. A train that is late by a couple of minutes will not have to wait for another slot to open up, unlike airplanes at congested airports. Furthermore, many airlines see short haul flights as increasingly uneconomic and in some countries airlines rely on High speed rail instead of short haul flights for connecting services.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="safety">Safety</h3>

<p>HSR is much simpler to control due to its predictable course. High-speed rail systems reduce (but do not eliminate)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> collisions with automobiles or people, by using non-grade level track and eliminating grade-level crossings. To date the only two deadly accidents involving a high speed train on high speed tracks were the 1998 <a href="Eschede_train_disaster" title="wikilink">Eschede train disaster</a> and the 2011 <a href="Wenzhou_train_collision" title="wikilink">Wenzhou train collision</a> (in which speed was not a factor).</p>
<h2 id="accidents">Accidents</h2>

<p>High-speed rail is one of the safest modes of transportation. The first high-speed rail network, the Japanese <a class="uri" href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Shinkansen</a> has not had any fatal accidents involving passengers since it began operating in 1964.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>Notable major accidents involving high-speed trains include the following.</p>
<h3 id="the-1998-eschede-accident">The 1998 Eschede accident</h3>

<p>In 1998, after over thirty years of high-speed rail operations worldwide without fatal accidents, the Eschede accident occurred in Germany: a poorly designed ICE 1 wheel broke at  near <a class="uri" href="Eschede" title="wikilink">Eschede</a>, resulting in the derailment and destruction of almost the entire full set of 16 cars and the subsequent death toll of 101 people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-2011-wenzhou-accident">The 2011 Wenzhou accident</h3>

<p>On 23 July 2011, 13 years after the Eschede train accident, a Chinese CRH2 traveling at  collided with a CRH1 which was stopped on a viaduct in the suburbs of Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, China. The two trains derailed, and four cars fell off the viaduct. 40 people were killed, at least 192 were injured, 12 of which were severe injuries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>The disaster led to a number of changes in management and exploitation of high-speed rail in China. Despite the fact that high speed was not a factor in the accident, one of the major changes was the lowering by  of all maximum speeds in China HST,  becoming 300,  becoming 200, and  becoming 160.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-2013-santiago-de-compostela-accident">The 2013 Santiago de Compostela accident</h3>

<p>In July 2013, a high-speed train in Spain attempted to round a curve which had a speed limit of  at , leading to 78 fatalities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Normally high-speed rail has automatic speed limiting restrictions, but this track section is a conventional section and in this case the automatic speed limit was said to be disabled by the driver several kilometers before the station. A few days later, the train worker's union claimed that the speed limiter didn't work properly because of lack of proper funding, acknowledging the budget cuts made by the current government.  Two days after the accident, the driver was provisionally charged with homicide by negligence. This is the first accident that occurred with a Spanish high-speed train, but it occurred in a section that was not high speed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Market segmentation has principally focused on the business travel market.

Pleasure travel was a secondary market; now many of the French extensions connect with vacation beaches on the <a href="Atlantic_Ocean" title="wikilink">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Mediterranean_Sea" title="wikilink">Mediterranean</a>, as well as major <a href="amusement_park" title="wikilink">amusement parks</a> and also the ski resorts in France and Switzerland. Friday evenings are the peak time for TGVs (<em>train à grande vitesse</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> The system lowered prices on long distance travel to compete more effectively with air services, and as a result some cities within an hour of Paris by TGV have become commuter communities, increasing the market while restructuring <a href="land_use" title="wikilink">land use</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

<p>On the Paris – Lyon service, the number of passengers grew sufficiently to justify the introduction of double-decker coaches. Later high-speed rail lines, such as the LGV Atlantique, the LGV Est, and most high-speed lines in France, were designed as feeder routes branching into conventional rail lines, serving a larger number of medium-sized cities.</p>
<h4 id="germany">Germany</h4>

<p>Germany's first high-speed lines ran north-south, for historical reasons, and later developed east-west after German unification.</p>
<h4 id="italy">Italy</h4>

<p>During the 1920s and '30s, Italy was one of the first countries to develop the technology for high-speed rail. The country constructed the <em>Direttissime</em> railways connecting major cities on dedicated electrified high-speed track (although not as high-speed as would nowadays be called high-speed rail) and developed the fast <a href="ETR_200" title="wikilink">ETR 200</a> trainset. After the Second World War and the fall of the fascist regime, interest in high-speed rail dwindled, with the successive governments considering it too costly and developing the tilting <a class="uri" href="Pendolino" title="wikilink">Pendolino</a>, to run at medium-high speed (up to ) on conventional lines, instead. The only exception was the <em>Direttissima</em> between Florence and Rome, but it was not conceived to be part of a high-speed line on large scale.</p>

<p>A true dedicated high-speed rail network was developed during the 80s and the 1990s, and in 2010  of high-speed rail were fully operational. Frecciarossa services are operated with <a href="ETR_500" title="wikilink">ETR 500</a> non-tilting trains at 25kVAC, 50 Hz power. The operational speed of the service is of . ETR1000 trainsets are currently under construction and were developed by the consortium formed by AnsaldoBreda and <a href="Bombardier_Transportation" title="wikilink">Bombardier</a>. Based on the <a href="Bombardier_Zefiro" title="wikilink">Bombardier Zefiro</a> trainset, it will operate up to  on the existing high-speed rail system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

It uses <a href="standard_gauge" title="wikilink">standard gauge</a> in opposite to the <a href="Iberian_gauge" title="wikilink">Iberian gauge</a> used in the most of the national railway network, meaning that the high-speed railways are separated and has almost only high-speed trains, no local trains and no freight.

The new lines, in particular the <a href="Gotthard_Base_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Gotthard Base Tunnel</a>, are built for . But the short high-speed parts and the mix with freight will lower the average speeds. The limited size of the country gives fairly short domestic travel times anyway.</p>
