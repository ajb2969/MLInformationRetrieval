<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>quaternions</strong> are a <a href="number_system" title="wikilink">number system</a> that extends the <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>. They were first described by Irish mathematician <a href="William_Rowan_Hamilton" title="wikilink">William Rowan Hamilton</a> in 1843<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and applied to <a class="uri" href="mechanics" title="wikilink">mechanics</a> in <a href="three-dimensional_space" title="wikilink">three-dimensional space</a>. A feature of quaternions is that multiplication of two quaternions is <a class="uri" href="noncommutative" title="wikilink">noncommutative</a>. Hamilton defined a quaternion as the <a class="uri" href="quotient" title="wikilink">quotient</a> of two directed lines in a three-dimensional space<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> or equivalently as the quotient of two <a href="vector_(geometry)" title="wikilink">vectors</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Quaternions find uses in both theoretical and applied mathematics, in particular for <a href="quaternions_and_spatial_rotation" title="wikilink">calculations involving three-dimensional rotations</a> such as in <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">three-dimensional computer graphics</a>, <a href="computer_vision" title="wikilink">computer vision</a> and <a href="Texture_(crystalline)" title="wikilink">crystallographic texture</a> analysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In practical applications, they can be used alongside other methods, such as <a href="Euler_angles" title="wikilink">Euler angles</a> and <a href="rotation_matrix" title="wikilink">rotation matrices</a>, or as an alternative to them, depending on the application.</p>

<p>In modern mathematical language, quaternions form a four-<a href="dimension_(vector_space)" title="wikilink">dimensional</a> associative <a href="composition_algebra" title="wikilink">normed division algebra</a> over the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a>, and therefore also a <a href="domain_(ring_theory)" title="wikilink">domain</a>. In fact, the quaternions were the first <a href="division_algebra" title="wikilink">noncommutative division algebra</a> to be discovered. The algebra of quaternions is often denoted by <strong>H</strong> (for <em>Hamilton</em>), or in <a href="blackboard_bold" title="wikilink">blackboard bold</a> by

It can also be given by the <a href="Clifford_algebra" title="wikilink">Clifford algebra</a> <a href="Classification_of_Clifford_algebras" title="wikilink">classifications</a> <mtpl></mtpl>. The algebra <strong>H</strong> holds a special place in analysis since, according to the <a href="Frobenius_theorem_(real_division_algebras)" title="wikilink">Frobenius theorem</a>, it is one of only two finite-dimensional <a href="division_ring" title="wikilink">division rings</a> containing the <a href="real_numbers" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> as a proper <a class="uri" href="subring" title="wikilink">subring</a>, the other being the complex numbers.

<p>Quaternion algebra was introduced by Hamilton in 1843.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Important precursors to this work included <a href="Euler's_four-square_identity" title="wikilink">Euler's four-square identity</a> (1748) and <a href="Olinde_Rodrigues" title="wikilink">Olinde Rodrigues</a>' <a href="Euler–Rodrigues_parameters" title="wikilink">parameterization of general rotations by four parameters</a> (1840), but neither of these writers treated the four-parameter rotations as an algebra.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> had also discovered quaternions in 1819, but this work was not published until 1900.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Hamilton knew that the <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a> could be interpreted as <a href="point_(geometry)" title="wikilink">points</a> in a <a href="plane_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">plane</a>, and he was looking for a way to do the same for points in three-dimensional <a class="uri" href="space" title="wikilink">space</a>. Points in space can be represented by their coordinates, which are triples of numbers, and for many years he had known how to add and subtract triples of numbers. However, Hamilton had been stuck on the problem of multiplication and division for a long time. He could not figure out how to calculate the <a class="uri" href="quotient" title="wikilink">quotient</a> of the coordinates of two points in space.</p>

<p>The great breakthrough in quaternions finally came on Monday 16 October 1843 in <a class="uri" href="Dublin" title="wikilink">Dublin</a>, when Hamilton was on his way to the <a href="Royal_Irish_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Irish Academy</a> where he was going to preside at a council meeting. As he walked along the towpath of the <a href="Royal_Canal" title="wikilink">Royal Canal</a> with his wife, the concepts behind quaternions were taking shape in his mind. When the answer dawned on him, Hamilton could not resist the urge to carve the formula for the quaternions,</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>into the stone of <a href="Broom_Bridge" title="wikilink">Brougham Bridge</a> as he paused on it.</p>

<p>On the following day, Hamilton wrote a letter to his friend and fellow mathematician, John T. Graves, describing the train of thought that led to his discovery. This letter was later published in the <em>London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science</em>, vol. xxv (1844), pp 489–95. In the letter, Hamilton states,</p>

<p>Hamilton called a quadruple with these rules of multiplication a <em>quaternion</em>, and he devoted most of the remainder of his life to studying and teaching them. <a href="Classical_Hamiltonian_quaternions" title="wikilink">Hamilton's treatment</a> is more <a href="Geometry" title="wikilink">geometric</a> than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions' <a href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebraic</a> properties. He founded a school of "quaternionists", and he tried to popularize quaternions in several books. The last and longest of his books, <em>Elements of Quaternions</em>, was 800 pages long; it was published shortly after his death.</p>

<p>After Hamilton's death, his student <a href="Peter_Guthrie_Tait" title="wikilink">Peter Tait</a> continued promoting quaternions. At this time, quaternions were a mandatory examination topic in Dublin. Topics in physics and geometry that would now be described using vectors, such as <a class="uri" href="kinematics" title="wikilink">kinematics</a> in space and <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a>, were described entirely in terms of quaternions. There was even a professional research association, the <a href="Quaternion_Society" title="wikilink">Quaternion Society</a>, devoted to the study of quaternions and other <a href="hypercomplex_number" title="wikilink">hypercomplex number</a> systems.</p>

<p>From the mid-1880s, quaternions began to be displaced by <a href="vector_analysis" title="wikilink">vector analysis</a>, which had been developed by <a href="Josiah_Willard_Gibbs" title="wikilink">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a>, <a href="Oliver_Heaviside" title="wikilink">Oliver Heaviside</a>, and <a href="Hermann_von_Helmholtz" title="wikilink">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>. Vector analysis described the same phenomena as quaternions, so it borrowed some ideas and terminology liberally from the literature of quaternions. However, vector analysis was conceptually simpler and notationally cleaner, and eventually quaternions were relegated to a minor role in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> and <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>. A side-effect of this transition is that <a href="classical_Hamiltonian_quaternions" title="wikilink">Hamilton's work</a> is difficult to comprehend for many modern readers. Hamilton's original definitions are unfamiliar and his writing style was wordy and difficult to understand.</p>

<p>However, quaternions have had a revival since the late 20th century, primarily due to their utility in describing spatial rotations. The representations of rotations by quaternions are more compact and quicker to compute than the representations by matrices. In addition, unlike <a href="Euler_angles" title="wikilink">Euler angles</a> they are not susceptible to <a href="gimbal_lock" title="wikilink">gimbal lock</a>. For this reason, quaternions are used in <a href="computer_graphics" title="wikilink">computer graphics</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="computer_vision" title="wikilink">computer vision</a>, <a class="uri" href="robotics" title="wikilink">robotics</a>, <a href="control_theory" title="wikilink">control theory</a>, <a href="signal_processing" title="wikilink">signal processing</a>, <a href="attitude_control" title="wikilink">attitude control</a>, <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, <a class="uri" href="bioinformatics" title="wikilink">bioinformatics</a>, <a href="molecular_dynamics" title="wikilink">molecular dynamics</a>, <a href="computer_simulation" title="wikilink">computer simulations</a>, and <a href="orbital_mechanics" title="wikilink">orbital mechanics</a>. For example, it is common for the attitude-control systems of spacecraft to be commanded in terms of quaternions. Quaternions have received another boost from <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a> because of their relationships with the <a href="quadratic_form" title="wikilink">quadratic forms</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1989, the Department of Mathematics of the <a href="National_University_of_Ireland,_Maynooth" title="wikilink">National University of Ireland, Maynooth</a> has organized a pilgrimage, where scientists (including the physicists <a href="Murray_Gell-Mann" title="wikilink">Murray Gell-Mann</a> in 2002, <a href="Steven_Weinberg" title="wikilink">Steven Weinberg</a> in 2005, and the mathematician <a href="Andrew_Wiles" title="wikilink">Andrew Wiles</a> in 2003) take a walk from <a href="Dunsink_Observatory" title="wikilink">Dunsink Observatory</a> to the Royal Canal bridge. Hamilton's carving is no longer visible.</p>

<p>P.R. Girard’s essay <em>The quaternion group and modern physics</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> discusses some roles of quaternions in physics. It "shows how various physical covariance groups: SO(3), the Lorentz group, the general relativity group, the Clifford algebra SU(2), and the conformal group can be readily related to the <a href="quaternion_group" title="wikilink">quaternion group</a>" in <a href="Abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">modern algebra</a>. Girard began by discussing <a href="group_representation" title="wikilink">group representations</a> and by representing some <a href="space_group" title="wikilink">space groups</a> of <a class="uri" href="crystallography" title="wikilink">crystallography</a>. He proceeded to <a class="uri" href="kinematics" title="wikilink">kinematics</a> of <a href="rigid_body" title="wikilink">rigid body</a> motion. Next he used complex quaternions (<a href="biquaternion" title="wikilink">biquaternions</a>) to represent the <a href="Lorentz_group" title="wikilink">Lorentz group</a> of special relativity, including the <a href="Thomas_precession" title="wikilink">Thomas precession</a>. He cited five authors, beginning with <a href="Ludwik_Silberstein" title="wikilink">Ludwik Silberstein</a>, who used a <a class="uri" href="potential" title="wikilink">potential</a> function of one <a href="quaternion_variable" title="wikilink">quaternion variable</a> to express <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> in a single <a href="differential_equation" title="wikilink">differential equation</a>. Concerning general relativity, he expressed the <a href="Runge–Lenz_vector" title="wikilink">Runge–Lenz vector</a>. He mentioned the Clifford biquaternions (<a href="split-biquaternion" title="wikilink">split-biquaternions</a>) as an instance of <a href="Clifford_algebra" title="wikilink">Clifford algebra</a>. Finally, invoking the reciprocal of a biquaternion, Girard described <a href="conformal_map" title="wikilink">conformal maps</a> on <a class="uri" href="spacetime" title="wikilink">spacetime</a>. Among the fifty references, Girard included <a href="Alexander_Macfarlane_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Alexander Macfarlane</a> and his <em>Bulletin</em> of the <a href="Quaternion_Society" title="wikilink">Quaternion Society</a>. In 1999 he showed how Einstein's equations of general relativity could be formulated within a Clifford algebra that is directly linked to quaternions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>A more personal view of quaternions was written by <a href="Joachim_Lambek" title="wikilink">Joachim Lambek</a> in 1995. He wrote in his essay <em>If Hamilton had prevailed: quaternions in physics</em>: "My own interest as a graduate student was raised by the inspiring book by Silberstein". He concluded by stating "I firmly believe that quaternions can supply a shortcut for pure mathematicians who wish to familiarize themselves with certain aspects of theoretical physics."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>As a set, the quaternions <strong>H</strong> are equal to <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>, a four-dimensional <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> over the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a>. <strong>H</strong> has three operations: addition, scalar multiplication, and quaternion multiplication. The sum of two elements of <strong>H</strong> is defined to be their sum as elements of <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>. Similarly the product of an element of <strong>H</strong> by a real number is defined to be the same as the product by a scalar in <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>. To define the product of two elements in <strong>H</strong> requires a choice of <a href="basis_(linear_algebra)" title="wikilink">basis</a> for <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>. The elements of this basis are customarily denoted as 1, <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>k</em>. Every element of <strong>H</strong> can be uniquely written as a <a href="linear_combination" title="wikilink">linear combination</a> of these basis elements, that is, as , where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a>. The basis element 1 will be the <a href="identity_element" title="wikilink">identity element</a> of <strong>H</strong>, meaning that multiplication by 1 does nothing, and for this reason, elements of <strong>H</strong> are usually written , suppressing the basis element 1. Given this basis, <a href="Associativity" title="wikilink">associative</a> quaternion multiplication is defined by first defining the products of basis elements and then defining all other products using the distributive law.</p>

<p>Unlike multiplication of real or complex numbers, multiplication of quaternions is not <a class="uri" href="commutative" title="wikilink">commutative</a>. For example, , while . The noncommutativity of multiplication has some unexpected consequences, among them that <a class="uri" href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomial</a> equations over the quaternions can have more distinct solutions than the degree of the polynomial. The equation <mtpl></mtpl>, for instance, has infinitely many quaternion solutions  with <mtpl></mtpl>, so that these solutions lie on the two-dimensional surface of a sphere centered on zero in the three-dimensional subspace of quaternions with zero real part.

<h3 id="scalar-and-vector-parts">Scalar and vector parts</h3>

<p>A number of the form , where <em>a</em> is a real number, is called <strong>real</strong>, and a number of the form , where <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are real numbers, and at least one of <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> or <em>d</em> is nonzero, is called <strong>pure imaginary</strong>. If  is any quaternion, then <em>a</em> is called its <strong>scalar part</strong> and <em>bi</em> + <em>cj</em> + <em>dk</em> is called its <strong>vector part</strong>. The scalar part of a quaternion is always real, and the vector part is always pure imaginary. Even though every quaternion can be viewed as a vector in a four-dimensional vector space, it is common to define a <strong>vector</strong> to mean a pure imaginary quaternion. With this convention, a vector is the same as an element of the vector space <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>It is important to note, however, that the vector part of a quaternion is, in truth, an "axial" vector or "pseudovector", <em>not</em> an ordinary or "polar" vector, as was formally proven by S.L. Altmann in Ch. 12 of his 1986 book, "Rotations, Quaternions and Double Groups". A polar vector can be represented in calculations (for example, when rotated by a quaternion "similarity transform") by a pure quaternion, with no loss of information, but the two should not be confused. The axis of a "binary" (180 deg) rotation quaternion corresponds to the direction of the represented polar vector in such a case.</p>

<p>Hamilton called pure imaginary quaternions <strong>right quaternions</strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and real numbers (considered as quaternions with zero vector part) <strong>scalar quaternions</strong>.</p>

<p>If a quaternion is divided up into a scalar part and a vector part, i.e.</p>

. Conjugation is an <a href="involution_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">involution</a>, meaning that it is its own inverse, so conjugating an element twice returns the original element. The conjugate of a product of two quaternions is the product of the conjugates <em>in the reverse order</em>. That is, if <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are quaternions, then <mtpl></mtpl>, not <em>p</em><sup>∗</sup><em>q</em><sup>∗</sup>.</p>

<p>Unlike the situation in the complex plane, the conjugation of a quaternion can be expressed entirely with multiplication and addition:</p>

<p>Conjugation can be used to extract the scalar and vector parts of a quaternion. The scalar part of <em>p</em> is <mtpl></mtpl>, and the vector part of <em>p</em> is <mtpl></mtpl>.</p>

<p>The square root of the product of a quaternion with its conjugate is called its <strong><a href="norm_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">norm</a></strong> and is denoted ||<em>q</em>|| (Hamilton called this quantity the <a href="Tensor_of_a_quaternion" title="wikilink"><em>tensor</em> of <em>q</em></a>, but this conflicts with modern meaning of "<a class="uri" href="tensor" title="wikilink">tensor</a>").

<p>The set <strong>H</strong> of all quaternions is a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> over the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> with <a href="Hamel_dimension" title="wikilink">dimension</a> 4. (In comparison, the real numbers have dimension 1, the complex numbers have dimension 2, and the <a href="octonion" title="wikilink">octonions</a> have dimension 8.) Multiplication of quaternions, for example, is associative and distributes over vector addition, but it is not commutative. Therefore, the quaternions <strong>H</strong> are a non-commutative <a href="associative_algebra" title="wikilink">associative algebra</a> over the real numbers. Even though <strong>H</strong> contains copies of the complex numbers, it is not an associative algebra over the complex numbers.</p>

<p>Because it is possible to divide quaternions, they form a <a href="division_algebra" title="wikilink">division algebra</a>. This is a structure similar to a <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> except for the non-commutativity of multiplication. Finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers are very rare. The <a href="Frobenius_theorem_(real_division_algebras)" title="wikilink">Frobenius theorem</a> states that there are exactly three: <strong>R</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>H</strong>. The norm makes the quaternions into a <a href="composition_algebra" title="wikilink">normed algebra</a>, and normed division algebras over the reals are also very rare: <a href="Hurwitz's_theorem_(composition_algebras)" title="wikilink">Hurwitz's theorem</a> says that there are only four: <strong>R</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>H</strong>, and <strong>O</strong> (the <a class="uri" href="octonions" title="wikilink">octonions</a>). The quaternions are also an example of a <a href="composition_algebra" title="wikilink">composition algebra</a> and of a unital <a href="Banach_algebra" title="wikilink">Banach algebra</a>.</p>

<p>Because the product of any two basis vectors is plus or minus another basis vector, the set  forms a <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">group</a> under multiplication. This group is called the <a href="quaternion_group" title="wikilink">quaternion group</a> and is denoted Q<sub>8</sub>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The real <a href="group_ring" title="wikilink">group ring</a> of Q<sub>8</sub> is a ring <strong>R</strong>[Q<sub>8</sub>] which is also an eight-dimensional vector space over <strong>R</strong>.

<h2 id="quaternions-and-the-geometry-of-r3">Quaternions and the geometry of R<sup>3</sup></h2>

<p>Because the vector part of a quaternion is a vector in <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup>, the geometry of <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup> is reflected in the algebraic structure of the quaternions. Many operations on vectors can be defined in terms of quaternions, and this makes it possible to apply quaternion techniques wherever spatial vectors arise. For instance, this is true in <a class="uri" href="electrodynamics" title="wikilink">electrodynamics</a> and <a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">3D computer graphics</a>.</p>

<p>For the remainder of this section, <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>k</em> will denote both imaginary<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> basis vectors of <strong>H</strong> and a basis for <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup>. Notice that replacing <em>i</em> by −<em>i</em>, <em>j</em> by −<em>j</em>, and <em>k</em> by −<em>k</em> sends a vector to its additive inverse, so the additive inverse of a vector is the same as its conjugate as a quaternion. For this reason, conjugation is sometimes called the <em>spatial inverse</em>.</p>

 This shows that the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication comes from the multiplication of pure imaginary quaternions. It also shows that two quaternions commute if and only if their vector parts are collinear.</p>

<p>For further elaboration on modeling three-dimensional vectors using quaternions, see <a href="quaternions_and_spatial_rotation" title="wikilink">quaternions and spatial rotation</a>. A possible visualisation was introduced by Andrew J. Hanson.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="matrix-representations">Matrix representations</h2>

<p>Just as complex numbers can be <a href="Complex_number#Matrix_representation_of_complex_numbers" title="wikilink">represented as matrices</a>, so can quaternions. There are at least two ways of representing quaternions as <a href="matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrices</a> in such a way that quaternion addition and multiplication correspond to matrix addition and <a href="matrix_multiplication" title="wikilink">matrix multiplication</a>. One is to use 2 × 2 <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex</a> matrices, and the other is to use 4 × 4 <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> matrices. In each case, the representation given is one of a family of linearly related representations. In the terminology of <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>, these are <a href="injective_function" title="wikilink">injective</a> <a href="homomorphism" title="wikilink">homomorphisms</a> from <strong>H</strong> to the <a href="matrix_ring" title="wikilink">matrix rings</a>  and , respectively.</p>

<p>Using 2 × 2 complex matrices, the quaternion  can be represented as</p>

<p>This representation has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constraining any two of <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> to zero produces a representation of <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a>. For example, setting  produces a diagonal complex matrix representation of complex numbers, and setting  produces a real matrix representation.</li>
<li>The norm of a quaternion (the square root of the product with its conjugate, as with complex numbers) is the square root of the <a class="uri" href="determinant" title="wikilink">determinant</a> of the corresponding matrix.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></li>
<li>The conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the <a href="conjugate_transpose" title="wikilink">conjugate transpose</a> of the matrix.</li>
<li>By restriction this representation yields an <a href="group_isomorphism" title="wikilink">isomorphism</a> between the subgroup of unit quaternions and their image <a class="uri" href="SU(2)" title="wikilink">SU(2)</a>. Topologically, the unit quaternions are the <a class="uri" href="3-sphere" title="wikilink">3-sphere</a>, so the underlying space of SU(2) is also a 3-sphere. The group SU(2) is important for describing <a href="spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a> in <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>; see <a href="Pauli_matrices" title="wikilink">Pauli matrices</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using 4 × 4 real matrices, that same quaternion can be written as</p>

As well as being an elegant theorem in its own right, Lagrange's four square theorem has useful applications in areas of mathematics outside number theory, such as <a href="combinatorial_design" title="wikilink">combinatorial design</a> theory.

 If we define <mtpl></mtpl> and , then we can multiply two vectors using the distributive law. Writing <em>k</em> in place of the product <em>ij</em> leads to the same rules for multiplication as the usual quaternions. Therefore, the above vector of complex numbers corresponds to the quaternion . If we write the elements of <strong>C</strong><sup>2</sup> as ordered pairs and quaternions as quadruples, then the correspondence is</p>

<p>In the complex numbers, there are just two numbers, <em>i</em> and −<em>i</em>, whose square is −1 . In <strong>H</strong> there are infinitely many square roots of minus one: the quaternion solution for the square root of −1 is the unit <a class="uri" href="sphere" title="wikilink">sphere</a> in <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup>. To see this, let  be a quaternion, and assume that its square is −1. In terms of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em>, this means</p>

 To satisfy the last three equations, either  or <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are all 0. The latter is impossible because <em>a</em> is a real number and the first equation would imply that <mtpl></mtpl>. Therefore,  and <mtpl></mtpl>. In other words, a quaternion squares to −1 if and only if it is a vector (that is, pure imaginary) with norm 1. By definition, the set of all such vectors forms the unit sphere.</p>

<p>Only negative real quaternions have an infinite number of square roots. All others have just two (or one in the case of 0).</p>

<p>The identification of the square roots of minus one in <strong>H</strong> was given by Hamilton<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> but was frequently omitted in other texts. By 1971 the sphere was included by Sam Perlis in his three-page exposition included in <em>Historical Topics in Algebra</em> (page 39) published by the <a href="National_Council_of_Teachers_of_Mathematics" title="wikilink">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics</a>. More recently, the sphere of square roots of minus one is described in <a href="Ian_R._Porteous" title="wikilink">Ian R. Porteous</a>'s book <em>Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups</em> (Cambridge, 1995) in proposition 8.13 on page 60. Also in Conway (2003) <em>On Quaternions and Octonions</em> we read on page 40: "any imaginary unit may be called i, and perpendicular one j, and their product k", another statement of the sphere.</p>

<p>Each pair of square roots of −1 creates a distinct copy of the complex numbers inside the quaternions. If <mtpl></mtpl>, then the copy is determined by the function</p>

Specifically, since two quaternions <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> commute () only if they lie in the same complex subplane of <strong>H</strong>, the profile of <strong>H</strong> as a union of complex planes arises when one seeks to find all commutative subrings of the quaternion <a href="ring_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">ring</a>.

All <a href="conjugacy_class" title="wikilink">elements that are conjugate to a given element</a> (in this sense of the word conjugate) have the same real part and the same norm of the vector part.

<p>Thus the multiplicative group of non-zero quaternions acts by conjugation on the copy of <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup> consisting of quaternions with real part equal to zero. Conjugation by a unit quaternion (a quaternion of absolute value 1) with real part cos(θ) is a rotation by an angle 2θ, the axis of the rotation being the direction of the imaginary part. The advantages of quaternions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nonsingular representation (compared with <a href="Euler_angles" title="wikilink">Euler angles</a> for example).</li>
<li>More compact (and faster) than <a href="matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrices</a>.</li>
<li>Pairs of unit quaternions represent a rotation in <a href="Four-dimensional_space" title="wikilink">4D</a> space (see <em><a href="Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#Algebra_of_4D_rotations" title="wikilink">Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space: Algebra of 4D rotations</a></em>).</li>
</ol>

<p>The set of all unit quaternions (<a href="versor" title="wikilink">versors</a>) forms a <a class="uri" href="3-sphere" title="wikilink">3-sphere</a> <em>S</em><sup>3</sup> and a <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">group</a> (a <a href="Lie_group" title="wikilink">Lie group</a>) under multiplication, <a href="Covering_space#Elementary_properties" title="wikilink">double covering</a> the group  of real orthogonal 3×3 <a href="orthogonal_matrix" title="wikilink">matrices</a> of <a class="uri" href="determinant" title="wikilink">determinant</a> 1 since <em>two</em> unit quaternions correspond to every rotation under the above correspondence.</p>

<p>The image of a subgroup of versors is a <a href="Point_groups_in_three_dimensions" title="wikilink">point group</a>, and conversely, the preimage of a point group is a subgroup of versors. The preimage of a finite point group is called by the same name, with the prefix <strong>binary</strong>. For instance, the preimage of the <a href="icosahedral_group" title="wikilink">icosahedral group</a> is the <a href="binary_icosahedral_group" title="wikilink">binary icosahedral group</a>.</p>

<p>The versors' group is isomorphic to SU(2), the group of complex <a href="unitary_matrix" title="wikilink">unitary</a> 2×2 matrices of <a class="uri" href="determinant" title="wikilink">determinant</a> 1.</p>

<p>Let <em>A</em> be the set of quaternions of the form  where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are either all <a href="integer" title="wikilink">integers</a> or all <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> with odd numerator and denominator 2.

<p>If <em>F</em> is any <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> with characteristic different from 2, and <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are elements of <em>F</em>, one may define a four-dimensional unitary <a href="associative_algebra" title="wikilink">associative algebra</a> over <em>F</em> with basis 1, <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>ij</em>, where <mtpl></mtpl>, <mtpl></mtpl> and  (so <mtpl></mtpl>).

<p>In this picture, quaternions correspond not to vectors but to <a href="bivector" title="wikilink">bivectors</a> – quantities with magnitude and orientations associated with particular 2D <em>planes</em> rather than 1D <em>directions</em>. The relation to <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex numbers</a> becomes clearer, too: in 2D, with two vector directions σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub>, there is only one bivector basis element σ<sub>1</sub>σ<sub>2</sub>, so only one imaginary. But in 3D, with three vector directions, there are three bivector basis elements σ<sub>1</sub>σ<sub>2</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>σ<sub>3</sub>, σ<sub>3</sub>σ<sub>1</sub>, so three imaginaries.</p>

<p>This reasoning extends further. In the Clifford algebra Cℓ<sub>4,0</sub>(<strong>R</strong>), there are six bivector basis elements, since with four different basic vector directions, six different pairs and therefore six different linearly independent planes can be defined. Rotations in such spaces using these generalisations of quaternions, called <a href="rotor_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">rotors</a>, can be very useful for applications involving <a href="homogeneous_coordinates" title="wikilink">homogeneous coordinates</a>. But it is only in 3D that the number of basis bivectors equals the number of basis vectors, and each bivector can be identified as a <a class="uri" href="pseudovector" title="wikilink">pseudovector</a>.</p>

<p>Dorst <em>et al.</em> identify the following advantages for placing quaternions in this wider setting:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rotors are natural and non-mysterious in geometric algebra and easily understood as the encoding of a double reflection.</li>
<li>In geometric algebra, a rotor and the objects it acts on live in the same space. This eliminates the need to change representations and to encode new data structures and methods (which is required when augmenting linear algebra with quaternions).</li>
<li>A rotor is universally applicable to any element of the algebra, not just vectors and other quaternions, but also lines, planes, circles, spheres, rays, and so on.</li>
<li>In the <a href="conformal_geometry" title="wikilink">conformal</a> model of Euclidean geometry, rotors allow the encoding of rotation, translation and scaling in a single element of the algebra, universally acting on any element. In particular, this means that rotors can represent rotations around an arbitrary axis, whereas quaternions are limited to an axis through the origin.</li>
<li>Rotor-encoded transformations make interpolation particularly straightforward.</li>
</ul>

Explicitly, the <a href="Brauer_group" title="wikilink">Brauer group</a> of the reals consists of two classes, represented by the reals and the quaternions, where the Brauer group is the set of all CSAs, up to equivalence relation of one CSA being a <a href="matrix_ring" title="wikilink">matrix ring</a> over another. By the <a href="Artin–Wedderburn_theorem" title="wikilink">Artin–Wedderburn theorem</a> (specifically, Wedderburn's part), CSAs are all matrix algebras over a division algebra, and thus the quaternions are the only non-trivial division algebra over the reals.</p>

<p>CSAs – rings over a field, which are <a href="simple_algebra" title="wikilink">simple algebras</a> (have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as with fields) whose center is exactly the field – are a noncommutative analog of <a href="extension_field" title="wikilink">extension fields</a>, and are more restrictive than general ring extensions. The fact that the quaternions are the only non-trivial CSA over the reals (up to equivalence) may be compared with the fact that the complex numbers are the only non-trivial field extension of the reals.</p>
<h2 id="quotations">Quotations</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I regard it as an inelegance, or imperfection, in quaternions, or rather in the state to which it has been hitherto unfolded, whenever it becomes or seems to become necessary to have recourse to x, y, z, etc." — William Rowan Hamilton (<em>ed</em>. Quoted in a letter from Tait to Cayley).</li>
<li>"Time is said to have only one dimension, and space to have three dimensions. […] The mathematical quaternion partakes of both these elements; in technical language it may be said to be "time plus space", or "space plus time": and in this sense it has, or at least involves a reference to, four dimensions. And how the One of Time, of Space the Three, Might in the Chain of Symbols girdled be." — William Rowan Hamilton (Quoted in R.P. Graves, "Life of Sir William Rowan Hamilton").</li>
<li>"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and, though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">Clerk Maxwell</a>." — <a href="Lord_Kelvin" title="wikilink">Lord Kelvin</a>, 1892.</li>
<li>"I came later to see that, as far as the vector analysis I required was concerned, the quaternion was not only not required, but was a positive evil of no inconsiderable magnitude; and that by its avoidance the establishment of vector analysis was made quite simple and its working also simplified, and that it could be conveniently harmonised with ordinary Cartesian work." <a href="Oliver_Heaviside" title="wikilink">Oliver Heaviside</a>, <em>Electromagnetic Theory,</em> Volume I, pp. 134–135 (<em>The Electrician</em> Printing and Publishing Company, London, 1893).</li>
<li>"Neither matrices nor quaternions and ordinary vectors were banished from these ten [additional] chapters. For, in spite of the uncontested power of the modern Tensor Calculus, those older mathematical languages continue, in my opinion, to offer conspicuous advantages in the restricted field of special relativity. Moreover, in science as well as in every-day life, the mastery of more than one language is also precious, as it broadens our views, is conducive to criticism with regard to, and guards against hypostasy [weak-foundation] of, the matter expressed by words or mathematical symbols." — <a href="Ludwik_Silberstein" title="wikilink">Ludwik Silberstein</a>, preparing the second edition of his <a href="List_of_important_publications_in_physics#The_Theory_of_Relativity" title="wikilink">Theory of Relativity</a> in 1924.</li>
<li>"... quaternions appear to exude an air of nineteenth century decay, as a rather unsuccessful species in the struggle-for-life of mathematical ideas. Mathematicians, admittedly, still keep a warm place in their hearts for the remarkable algebraic properties of quaternions but, alas, such enthusiasm means little to the harder-headed physical scientist." — <a href="Simon_L._Altmann" title="wikilink">Simon L. Altmann</a>, 1986.</li>
