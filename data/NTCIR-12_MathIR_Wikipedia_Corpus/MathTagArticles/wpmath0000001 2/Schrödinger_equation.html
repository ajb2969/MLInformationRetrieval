<h1>Schrödinger equation</h1>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>In <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>, the <strong>Schrödinger equation</strong> is a <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a> that describes how the <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">quantum state</a> of a <a href="physical_system" title="wikilink">physical system</a> changes with time. It was formulated in late 1925, and published in 1926, by the Austrian physicist <a href="Erwin_Schrödinger" title="wikilink">Erwin Schrödinger</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In <a href="classical_mechanics" title="wikilink">classical mechanics</a>, the <a href="equation_of_motion" title="wikilink">equation of motion</a> is <a href="Newton's_second_law" title="wikilink">Newton's second law</a>, (<span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ F } = m \mathbf{ a } $</span>), used to mathematically predict what the system will do at any time after the initial conditions of the system. In quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schrödinger's equation for a quantum system (usually atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles whether free, bound, or localized). It is not a simple algebraic equation, but in general a <a href="linear_differential_equation" title="wikilink">linear</a> <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a>, describing the time-evolution of the system's <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a> (also called a "state function").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The concept of a wavefunction is a fundamental <a href="Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">postulate of quantum mechanics</a>. Schrödinger's equation is also often presented as a separate postulate, but some authors<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> assert it can be derived from symmetry principles. Generally, "derivations" of the Schrödinger equation demonstrate its mathematical plausibility for describing <a href="wave–particle_duality" title="wikilink">wave–particle duality</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="Copenhagen_interpretation" title="wikilink">standard interpretation of quantum mechanics</a>, the wave function is the most complete description that can be given of a physical system. Solutions to Schrödinger's equation describe not only <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecular</a>, <a href="atom" title="wikilink">atomic</a>, and <a href="subatomic_particle" title="wikilink">subatomic</a> systems, but also <a href="macroscopic_scale" title="wikilink">macroscopic systems</a>, possibly even the whole <a class="uri" href="universe" title="wikilink">universe</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Schrödinger equation, in its most general form, is consistent with both classical mechanics and <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, but the original formulation by Schrödinger himself was non-relativistic.</p>
<p>The Schrödinger equation is not the only way to make predictions in quantum mechanics - other formulations can be used, such as <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a>'s <a href="matrix_mechanics" title="wikilink">matrix mechanics</a>, and <a href="Richard_Feynman" title="wikilink">Richard Feynman</a>'s <a href="path_integral_formulation" title="wikilink">path integral formulation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="equation">Equation</h2>
<h3 id="time-dependent-equation">Time-dependent equation</h3>
<p>The form of the Schrödinger equation depends on the physical situation (see below for special cases). The most general form is the <a href="Schrödinger_equation#Time_dependent" title="wikilink">time-dependent Schrödinger equation</a>, which gives a description of a system evolving with time:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span> is the <a href="imaginary_unit" title="wikilink">imaginary unit</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$ħ$</span> is the <a href="Planck_constant" title="wikilink">Planck constant</a> divided by <span class="LaTeX">$2 \pi$</span>, the symbol ∂/∂<em>t</em> indicates a <a href="partial_derivative" title="wikilink">partial derivative</a> with respect to time <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> (the Greek letter <a href="Psi_(letter)" title="wikilink">Psi</a>) is the <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a> of the quantum system, and <span class="LaTeX">$Ĥ$</span> is the <a href="Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> <a href="operator_(physics)" title="wikilink">operator</a> (which characterizes the total energy of any given wave function and takes different forms depending on the situation).</p>
<p> The most famous example is the <a href="relativistic_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">non-relativistic</a> Schrödinger equation for a single particle moving in an <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> (but not a <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a>; see the <a href="Pauli_equation" title="wikilink">Pauli equation</a>):</p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$μ$</span> is the particle's "<a href="reduced_mass" title="wikilink">reduced mass</a>", <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is its <a href="potential_energy" title="wikilink">potential energy</a>, <mtpl></mtpl> is the <a class="uri" href="Laplacian" title="wikilink">Laplacian</a> (a differential operator), and <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> is the wave function (more precisely, in this context, it is called the "position-space wave function"). In plain language, it means "total energy equals <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> plus <a href="potential_energy" title="wikilink">potential energy</a>", but the terms take unfamiliar forms for reasons explained below.</p>
<p>Given the particular differential operators involved, this is a <a href="linear_differential_equation" title="wikilink">linear</a> <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a>. It is also a <a href="diffusion_equation" title="wikilink">diffusion equation</a>, but unlike the <a href="heat_equation" title="wikilink">heat equation</a>, this one is also a wave equation given the <a href="imaginary_unit" title="wikilink">imaginary unit</a> present in the transient term.</p>
<p>The term <em>"Schrödinger equation"</em> can refer to both the general equation (first box above), or the specific nonrelativistic version (second box above and variations thereof). The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the <a href="Dirac_equation" title="wikilink">Dirac equation</a> to <a href="quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">quantum field theory</a>, by plugging in various complicated expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is a simplified approximation to reality, which is quite accurate in many situations, but very inaccurate in others (see <a href="relativistic_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">relativistic quantum mechanics</a> and <a href="relativistic_quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">relativistic quantum field theory</a>).</p>
<p>To apply the Schrödinger equation, the Hamiltonian operator is set up for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energy of the particles constituting the system, then inserted into the Schrödinger equation. The resulting partial differential equation is solved for the wave function, which contains information about the system.</p>
<h3 id="time-independent-equation">Time-independent equation</h3>
<p> The time-independent Schrödinger equation predicts that wave functions can form <a href="standing_wave" title="wikilink">standing waves</a>, called <a href="stationary_state" title="wikilink">stationary states</a> (also called "orbitals", as in <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a> or <a href="molecular_orbital" title="wikilink">molecular orbitals</a>). These states are important in their own right, and if the stationary states are classified and understood, then it becomes easier to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for <em>any</em> state. The <em>time-independent Schrödinger equation</em> is the equation describing stationary states. (It is only used when the <a href="Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> itself is not dependent on time. However, even in this case the total wave function still has a time dependency.)</p>
<p>In words, the equation states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><em>When the Hamiltonian operator acts on a certain wave function <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span>, and the result is proportional to the same wave function <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span>, then <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> is a <a href="stationary_state" title="wikilink">stationary state</a>, and the proportionality constant, <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span>, is the energy of the state <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span>.</em>
</dd>

</dl>
<p>The time-independent Schrödinger equation is discussed further <a href="#Time_independent" title="wikilink">below</a>. In <a href="linear_algebra" title="wikilink">linear algebra</a> terminology, this equation is an <a href="Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" title="wikilink">eigenvalue equation</a>.</p>
<p>As before, the most famous manifestation is the <a href="relativistic_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">non-relativistic</a> Schrödinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):</p>
<p>with definitions as above.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>The Schrödinger equation and its solutions introduced a breakthrough in thinking about physics. Schrödinger's equation was the first of its type, and solutions led to consequences that were very unusual and unexpected for the time.</p>
<h3 id="total-kinetic-and-potential-energy">Total, kinetic, and potential energy</h3>
<p>The <em>overall</em> form of the equation is <em>not</em> unusual or unexpected as it uses the principle of the <a href="conservation_of_energy" title="wikilink">conservation of energy</a>. The terms of the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation can be interpreted as total energy of the system, equal to the system <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> plus the system <a href="potential_energy" title="wikilink">potential energy</a>. In this respect, it is just the same as in classical physics.</p>
<h3 id="quantization">Quantization</h3>
<p>The Schrödinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be <em>quantized</em>, meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is <em>energy quantization</em>: the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the <a href="Energy_level" title="wikilink">quantized energy levels</a>, a fact discovered via <a href="atomic_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">atomic spectroscopy</a>. (Energy quantization is discussed <a href="#Time_independent" title="wikilink">below</a>.) Another example is <a href="angular_momentum_operator" title="wikilink">quantization of angular momentum</a>. This was an <em>assumption</em> in the earlier <a href="Bohr_model" title="wikilink">Bohr model of the atom</a>, but it is a <em>prediction</em> of the Schrödinger equation.</p>
<p>Another result of the Schrödinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="measurement-and-uncertainty">Measurement and uncertainty</h3>
<p>In classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change <a href="determinism" title="wikilink">deterministically</a> as the particle moves according to <a href="Newton's_laws" title="wikilink">Newton's laws</a>. In quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a <a href="probability_distribution" title="wikilink">probability distribution</a>. The Schrödinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.</p>
<p>The <a href="Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a> is the statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The Schrödinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a> of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-tunneling">Quantum tunneling</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption><a href="Quantum_tunneling" title="wikilink">Quantum tunneling</a> through a barrier. A particle coming from the left does not have enough energy to climb the barrier. However, it can sometimes "tunnel" to the other side. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In classical physics, when a ball is rolled slowly up a large hill, it will come to a stop and roll back, because it doesn't have enough <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> to get over the top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called <a href="quantum_tunneling" title="wikilink">quantum tunneling</a>. It is related to the distribution of energy: Although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.</p>
<h3 id="particles-as-waves">Particles as waves</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation is a type of <a href="partial_differential_equation" title="wikilink">partial differential equation</a> called a <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a>. Therefore it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In most modern interpretations this description is reversed – the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior.</p>
<p><a href="Double-slit_experiment" title="wikilink">Two-slit diffraction</a> is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.</p>
<p>However, since the Schrödinger equation is a <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a>, a single particle fired through a double-slit <em>does</em> show this same pattern (figure on right). Note: The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. The appearance of the pattern proves that each electron passes through <em>both</em> slits simultaneously.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, <a href="electron_diffraction" title="wikilink">electron diffraction</a> and <a href="neutron_diffraction" title="wikilink">neutron diffraction</a> are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.</p>
<p>Related to <a class="uri" href="diffraction" title="wikilink">diffraction</a>, particles also display <a href="Superposition_principle#Application_to_waves" title="wikilink">superposition</a> and <a href="Interference_(wave_propagation)" title="wikilink">interference</a>.</p>
<p>The superposition property allows the particle to be in a <a href="quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">quantum superposition</a> of two or more states with different classical properties at the same time. For example, a particle can have several different energies at the same time, and can be in several different locations at the same time. In the above example, a particle can pass through two slits at the same time. This superposition is still a single quantum state, as shown by the interference effects, even though that conflicts with classical intuition.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation-of-the-wave-function">Interpretation of the wave function</h2>
<p>The Schrödinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schrödinger equation does not directly say <em>what</em>, exactly, the wave function is. <a href="Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">Interpretations of quantum mechanics</a> address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.</p>
<p>An important aspect is the relationship between the Schrödinger equation and <a href="wavefunction_collapse" title="wikilink">wavefunction collapse</a>. In the oldest <a href="Copenhagen_interpretation" title="wikilink">Copenhagen interpretation</a>, particles follow the Schrödinger equation <em>except</em> during wavefunction collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of <a href="quantum_decoherence" title="wikilink">quantum decoherence theory</a> allowed alternative approaches (such as the <a href="Everett_many-worlds_interpretation" title="wikilink">Everett many-worlds interpretation</a> and <a href="consistent_histories" title="wikilink">consistent histories</a>), wherein the Schrödinger equation is <em>always</em> satisfied, and wavefunction collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schrödinger equation.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background-and-development">Historical background and development</h2>
<p>Following <a href="Max_Planck" title="wikilink">Max Planck</a>'s quantization of light (see <a href="black_body_radiation" title="wikilink">black body radiation</a>), <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> interpreted Planck's <a href="quantum" title="wikilink">quanta</a> to be <a href="photon" title="wikilink">photons</a>, <a href="corpuscular_theory_of_light" title="wikilink">particles of light</a>, and proposed that the <a href="Planck_relation" title="wikilink">energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency</a>, one of the first signs of <a href="wave–particle_duality" title="wikilink">wave–particle duality</a>. Since <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> and <a class="uri" href="momentum" title="wikilink">momentum</a> are related in the same way as <a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a> and <a class="uri" href="wavenumber" title="wikilink">wavenumber</a> in <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, it followed that the momentum <span class="LaTeX">$p$</span> of a photon is inversely proportional to its <a class="uri" href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelength</a> <span class="LaTeX">$λ$</span>, or proportional to its <a class="uri" href="wavenumber" title="wikilink">wavenumber</a> <span class="LaTeX">$k$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$p = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \hbar k$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$h$</span> is <a href="Planck's_constant" title="wikilink">Planck's constant</a>. <a href="Louis_de_Broglie" title="wikilink">Louis de Broglie</a> hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons. He showed that, assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle counterparts, electrons form <a href="standing_wave" title="wikilink">standing waves</a>, meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus of an atom are allowed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> These quantized orbits correspond to discrete <a href="energy_level" title="wikilink">energy levels</a>, and de Broglie reproduced the <a href="Bohr_model" title="wikilink">Bohr model</a> formula for the energy levels. The Bohr model was based on the assumed quantization of angular momentum <span class="LaTeX">$L$</span> according to:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$L = n{h \over 2\pi} = n\hbar.$$</span> According to de Broglie the electron is described by a wave and a whole number of wavelengths must fit along the circumference of the electron's orbit:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$n \lambda = 2 \pi r.\,$$</span></p>
<p>This approach essentially confined the electron wave in one dimension, along a circular orbit of radius <span class="LaTeX">$r$</span>.</p>
<p>In 1921, prior to de Broglie, Arthur C. Lunn at the University of Chicago had used the same argument based on the completion of the relativistic energy–momentum 4-vector to derive what we now call the de Broglie relation<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Unlike de Broglie, Lunn went on to formulate the differential equation now known as the Schrödinger equation, and solve for its energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen atom. Unfortunately the paper was rejected by the Physical Review, as recounted by Kamen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Following up on de Broglie's ideas, physicist <a href="Peter_Debye" title="wikilink">Peter Debye</a> made an offhand comment that if particles behaved as waves, they should satisfy some sort of wave equation. Inspired by Debye's remark, Schrödinger decided to find a proper 3-dimensional wave equation for the electron. He was guided by <a href="William_Rowan_Hamilton" title="wikilink">William R. Hamilton</a>'s analogy between <a class="uri" href="mechanics" title="wikilink">mechanics</a> and <a class="uri" href="optics" title="wikilink">optics</a>, encoded in the observation that the zero-wavelength limit of optics resembles a mechanical system — the trajectories of light rays become sharp tracks that obey <a href="Fermat's_principle" title="wikilink">Fermat's principle</a>, an analog of the <a href="principle_of_least_action" title="wikilink">principle of least action</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> A modern version of his reasoning is reproduced below. The equation he found is:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t)=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t) + V(\mathbf{r})\Psi(\mathbf{r},\,t).$$</span></p>
<p>However, by that time, <a href="Arnold_Sommerfeld" title="wikilink">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> had <a href="Sommerfeld–Wilson_quantization" title="wikilink">refined the Bohr model</a> with <a href="fine_structure" title="wikilink">relativistic corrections</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Schrödinger used the relativistic energy momentum relation to find what is now known as the <a href="Klein–Gordon_equation" title="wikilink">Klein–Gordon equation</a> in a <a href="Coulomb_potential" title="wikilink">Coulomb potential</a> (in <a href="natural_units" title="wikilink">natural units</a>):</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\left(E + {e^2\over r} \right)^2 \psi(x) = - \nabla^2\psi(x) + m^2 \psi(x).$$</span></p>
<p>He found the standing waves of this relativistic equation, but the relativistic corrections disagreed with Sommerfeld's formula. Discouraged, he put away his calculations and secluded himself in an isolated mountain cabin in December 1925.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>While at the cabin, Schrödinger decided that his earlier non-relativistic calculations were novel enough to publish, and decided to leave off the problem of relativistic corrections for the future. Despite the difficulties in solving the differential equation for hydrogen (he had sought help from his friend the mathematician <a href="Hermann_Weyl" title="wikilink">Hermann Weyl</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>) Schrödinger showed that his non-relativistic version of the wave equation produced the correct spectral energies of hydrogen in a paper published in 1926.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In the equation, Schrödinger computed the <a href="hydrogen_spectral_series" title="wikilink">hydrogen spectral series</a> by treating a <a href="hydrogen_atom" title="wikilink">hydrogen atom</a>'s <a class="uri" href="electron" title="wikilink">electron</a> as a wave <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ( x , t )$</span>, moving in a <a href="potential_well" title="wikilink">potential well</a> <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>, created by the <a class="uri" href="proton" title="wikilink">proton</a>. This computation accurately reproduced the energy levels of the <a href="Bohr_model" title="wikilink">Bohr model</a>. In a paper, Schrödinger himself explained this equation as follows:</p>

<p>This 1926 paper was enthusiastically endorsed by Einstein, who saw the matter-waves as an intuitive depiction of nature, as opposed to Heisenberg's <a href="matrix_mechanics" title="wikilink">matrix mechanics</a>, which he considered overly formal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The Schrödinger equation details the behavior of <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> but says nothing of its <em>nature</em>.

<p>Louis de Broglie in his later years proposed a real valued <a href="wave_function" title="wikilink">wave function</a> connected to the complex wave function by a proportionality constant and developed the <a href="De_Broglie–Bohm_theory" title="wikilink">De Broglie–Bohm theory</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-wave-equation-for-particles">The wave equation for particles</h2>
<p>The Schrödinger equation is a <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equation</a>, since the <em>solutions</em> are functions which describe wave-like motions. Wave equations in physics can normally be derived from other physical laws – the wave equation for <a href="Vibration" title="wikilink">mechanical vibrations</a> on strings and in matter can be derived from <a href="Newton's_laws" title="wikilink">Newton's laws</a> – where the wave function represents the <a href="Displacement_(vector)" title="wikilink">displacement</a> of matter, and <a href="electromagnetic_waves" title="wikilink">electromagnetic waves</a> from <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a>, where the wave functions are <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric</a> and <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic</a> fields. The basis for Schrödinger's equation, on the other hand, is the energy of the system and a separate <a href="Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics#Postulates_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">postulate of quantum mechanics</a>: the wave function is a description of the system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> The Schrödinger equation is therefore a new concept in itself; as Feynman put it:</p>

<p>The foundation of the equation is structured to be a linear differential equation based on classical energy conservation, and consistent with the De Broglie relations. The solution is the wave function <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span>, which contains all the information that can be known about the system.

<p>The Schrödinger equation was developed principally from the <a href="De_Broglie_hypothesis" title="wikilink">De Broglie hypothesis</a>, a wave equation that would describe particles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> and can be constructed as shown informally in the following sections.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> For a more rigorous description of Schrödinger's equation, see also.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>The total <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> of a particle is the sum of kinetic energy <span class="LaTeX">$T$</span> and potential energy <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>, this sum is also the frequent expression for the <a href="Hamiltonian_mechanics#Basic_physical_interpretation" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> in classical mechanics:</p>

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E = \frac{p^2}{2m}+V(x,t)=H.$$</span></p>
<p>For three dimensions, the <a href="position_vector" title="wikilink">position vector</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ r } $</span> and momentum vector <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ p } $</span> must be used:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E = \frac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V(\mathbf{r},t)=H$$</span></p>
<p>This formalism can be extended to any fixed number of particles: the total energy of the system is then the total kinetic energies of the particles, plus the total potential energy, again the Hamiltonian. However, there can be <a href="interactions#Physics" title="wikilink">interactions</a> between the particles (an <a href="many_body_problem" title="wikilink"><em>N</em>-body problem</a>), so the potential energy <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> can change as the spatial configuration of particles changes, and possibly with time. The potential energy, in general, is <em>not</em> the sum of the separate potential energies for each particle, it is a function of all the spatial positions of the particles. Explicitly:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E=\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{\mathbf{p}_n\cdot\mathbf{p}_n}{2m_n} + V(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2\cdots\mathbf{r}_N,t) = H \,\!$$</span></p>
<h3 id="linearity">Linearity</h3>
<p>The simplest wavefunction is a <a href="plane_wave" title="wikilink">plane wave</a> of the form:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = A e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>where the <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> is the amplitude, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span> the wavevector, and <span class="LaTeX">$ω$</span> the angular frequency, of the plane wave. In general, physical situations are not purely described by plane waves, so for generality the <a href="superposition_principle" title="wikilink">superposition principle</a> is required; any wave can be made by superposition of sinusoidal plane waves. So if the equation is linear, a <a href="linear_combination" title="wikilink">linear combination</a> of plane waves is also an allowed solution. Hence a necessary and separate requirement is that the Schrödinger equation is a <a href="linear_differential_equation" title="wikilink">linear differential equation</a>.</p>
<p>For discrete <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span> the sum is a <a href="superposition_principle#Application_to_waves" title="wikilink">superposition</a> of plane waves:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n e^{i(\mathbf{k}_n\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega_n t)} \,\!$$</span></p>

<p><a href="Photoelectric_effect" title="wikilink">Einstein's light quanta hypothesis</a> (1905) states that the energy <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> of a photon is proportional to the <a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a> <span class="LaTeX">$ν$</span> (or <a href="angular_frequency" title="wikilink">angular frequency</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$ω = 2 \pi ν$</span>) of the corresponding quantum wavepacket of light:</p>

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$p = \frac{h}{\lambda} =  \hbar k\;,$$</span> while in three dimensions, wavelength <span class="LaTeX">$λ$</span> is related to the magnitude of the <a class="uri" href="wavevector" title="wikilink">wavevector</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathbf{p} = \hbar \mathbf{k}\,,\quad |\mathbf{k}| = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \,.$$</span></p>
<p>The Planck–Einstein and de Broglie relations illuminate the deep connections between energy with time, and space with momentum, and express <a href="wave–particle_duality" title="wikilink">wave–particle duality</a>. In practice, <a href="natural_units" title="wikilink">natural units</a> comprising <span class="LaTeX">$ħ = 1$</span> are used, as the De Broglie <em>equations</em> reduce to <em>identities</em>: allowing momentum, wavenumber, energy and frequency to be used interchangeably, to prevent duplication of quantities, and reduce the number of dimensions of related quantities. For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.</p>
<p>Schrödinger's insight, late in 1925, was to express the <a href="Phase_(waves)" title="wikilink">phase</a> of a <a href="plane_wave" title="wikilink">plane wave</a> as a <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex</a> <a href="phase_factor" title="wikilink">phase factor</a> using these relations:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}-Et)/\hbar}$$</span></p>
<p>and to realize that the first order <a href="partial_derivatives" title="wikilink">partial derivatives</a> were:</p>
<p>with respect to space:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\nabla\Psi = \dfrac{i}{\hbar}\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}-Et)/\hbar} = \dfrac{i}{\hbar}\mathbf{p}\Psi$$</span></p>
<p>with respect to time:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\dfrac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\dfrac{i E}{\hbar} Ae^{i(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}-Et)/\hbar} = -\dfrac{i E}{\hbar} \Psi$$</span></p>
<p>Another postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by <a href="linear_operator" title="wikilink">linear</a> <a href="Self-adjoint_operator" title="wikilink">Hermitian operators</a> which act on the wavefunction, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the <a href="energy_operator" title="wikilink">energy operator</a>, corresponding to the time derivative,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{E} \Psi = i\hbar\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = E\Psi$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> are the energy <a href="eigenvalue" title="wikilink">eigenvalues</a>, and the <a href="momentum_operator" title="wikilink">momentum operator</a>, corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the <a href="del" title="wikilink">gradient</a> <span class="LaTeX">$∇$</span>),</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{\mathbf{p}} \Psi = -i\hbar\nabla \Psi = \mathbf{p} \Psi$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ p } $</span> is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the "<a href="circumflex" title="wikilink">hats</a>" ( <span class="LaTeX">$^$</span> ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are <em><a href="differential_operators" title="wikilink">differential operators</a></em>, while the potential energy function <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is just a multiplicative factor.</p>
<p>Substituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E= \dfrac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \quad \rightarrow \quad \hat{E} = \dfrac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V$$</span></p>
<p>so in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wavefunction <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ$</span> immediately led Schrödinger to his equation:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$i\hbar\dfrac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}= -\dfrac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi +V\Psi$$</span></p>
<p>Wave–particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy <span class="LaTeX">$T$</span> is related to the square of momentum <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ p } $</span>. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wavenumber <span class="LaTeX">$| \mathbf{ k } |$</span> increases the wavelength <span class="LaTeX">$λ$</span> decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p} \propto \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} \propto T \propto \dfrac{1}{\lambda^2}$$</span></p>
<p>The kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the <em><a class="uri" href="curvature" title="wikilink">curvature</a></em> of the wave, in terms of operators:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{T} \Psi = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla\cdot\nabla  \Psi \, \propto \, \nabla^2 \Psi \,.$$</span></p>
<p>As the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="wave-and-particle-motion">Wave and particle motion</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Schrödinger required that a <a href="wave_packet" title="wikilink">wave packet</a> solution near position <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ r } $</span> with wavevector near <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span> will move along the trajectory determined by classical mechanics for times short enough for the spread in <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span> (and hence in velocity) not to substantially increase the spread in <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ r } $</span>. Since, for a given spread in <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ k } $</span>, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <span class="LaTeX">$ħ$</span>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <span class="LaTeX">$ħ$</span> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Great care is required in how that limit is taken, and in what cases.</p>
<p>The limiting short-wavelength is equivalent to <span class="LaTeX">$ħ$</span> tending to zero because this is limiting case of increasing the wave packet localization to the definite position of the particle (see images right). Using the <a href="Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a> for position and momentum, the products of uncertainty in position and momentum become zero as <span class="LaTeX">$ħ → 0$</span>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sigma(x) \sigma(p_x) \geqslant \frac{\hbar}{2} \quad \rightarrow \quad \sigma(x) \sigma(p_x) \geqslant 0 \,\!$$</span></p>

<p>The Schrödinger equation in its general form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) = \hat{H} \Psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>is closely related to the <a href="Hamilton–Jacobi_equation" title="wikilink">Hamilton–Jacobi equation</a> (HJE)</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\left(q_i,\frac{\partial S}{\partial q_i},t \right) \,\!$$</span></p>

<p>Substituting</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi = \sqrt{\rho(\mathbf{r},t)} e^{iS(\mathbf{r},t)/\hbar}\,\!$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$ρ$</span> is the probability density, into the Schrödinger equation and then taking the limit <span class="LaTeX">$ħ → 0$</span> in the resulting equation, yields the Hamilton–Jacobi equation.</p>
<p>The implications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The motion of a particle, described by a (short-wavelength) wave packet solution to the Schrödinger equation, is also described by the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of motion.</li>
<li>The Schrödinger equation includes the wavefunction, so its wave packet solution implies the position of a (quantum) particle is fuzzily spread out in wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics">Non-relativistic quantum mechanics</h2>
<p>The quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, for example particles propagating at speeds much less than <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">light</a>, is known as <strong>non-relativistic quantum mechanics</strong>. Following are several forms of Schrödinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and <span class="LaTeX">$N$</span> particles.</p>
<p>In actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="time-independent">Time independent</h3>
<p>If the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, the equation is <a href="Separation_of_variables" title="wikilink">separable</a> into a product of spatial and temporal parts. In general, the wavefunction takes the form:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(\text{space coords},t)=\psi(\text{space coords})\tau(t)\,.$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$ψ (space coords)$</span> is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and <span class="LaTeX">$τ ( t )$</span> is a function of time only.</p>
<p>Substituting for <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> into the Schrödinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by <a href="separation_of_variables" title="wikilink">separation of variables</a> implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(\text{space coords},t) = \psi(\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\hbar}} \,.$$</span></p>
<p>Since the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator <span class="LaTeX">$Ê = iħ ∂\frac{∂}{t}$</span> can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span>, thus the time independent Schrödinger equation is an <a class="uri" href="eigenvalue" title="wikilink">eigenvalue</a> equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{H} \psi = E \psi$$</span></p>
<p>This is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the <a href="standing_wave" title="wikilink">standing wave</a> solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called "<a href="stationary_state" title="wikilink">stationary states</a>" or "<a href="energy_eigenstate" title="wikilink">energy eigenstates</a>"; in chemistry they are called "<a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic orbitals</a>" or "<a href="molecular_orbital" title="wikilink">molecular orbitals</a>". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.</p>
<p>The energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete <a href="Spectrum_(functional_analysis)" title="wikilink">spectrum</a> of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis – any wavefunction may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is the <a href="spectral_theorem" title="wikilink">spectral theorem</a> in mathematics, and in a finite state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a <a href="Hermitian_matrix" title="wikilink">Hermitian matrix</a>.</p>
<h3 id="one-dimensional-examples">One-dimensional examples</h3>
<p>For a particle in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \,, \quad \hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{d}{d x}$$</span></p>
<p>and substituting this into the general Schrödinger equation gives:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{d x^2}\psi(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)$$</span></p>
<p>This is the only case the Schrödinger equation is an <a href="ordinary_derivative" title="wikilink">ordinary</a> differential equation, rather than a <a href="partial_derivative" title="wikilink">partial</a> differential equation. The general solutions are always of the form:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(x,t)=\psi(x) e^{-iEt/\hbar} \, .$$</span></p>
<p>For <span class="LaTeX">$N$</span> particles in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{H} = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{\hat{p}_n^2}{2m_n} + V(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N) \,,\quad \hat{p}_n = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}$$</span></p>
<p>where the position of particle <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> is <mtpl></mtpl>. The corresponding Schrödinger equation is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{m_n}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_n^2}\psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N) + V(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N)\psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N) = E\psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N) \, .$$</span></p>
<p>so the general solutions have the form:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N,t) = e^{-iEt/\hbar}\psi(x_1,x_2\cdots x_N)$$</span></p>
<p>For non-interacting distinguishable particles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> the potential of the system only influences each particle separately, so the total potential energy is the sum of potential energies for each particle:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$V(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N) = \sum_{n=1}^N V(x_n) \, .$$</span></p>
<p>and the wavefunction can be written as a product of the wavefunctions for each particle:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(x_1,x_2,\cdots x_N,t) = e^{-i{E t/\hbar}}\prod_{n=1}^N\psi(x_n) \, ,$$</span></p>
<p>For non-interacting <a href="identical_particles" title="wikilink">identical particles</a>, the potential is still a sum, but wavefunction is a bit more complicated - it is a sum over the permutations of products of the separate wavefunctions to account for particle exchange. In general for interacting particles, the above decompositions are <em>not</em> possible.</p>

<p>For no potential, <span class="LaTeX">$V = 0$</span>, so the particle is free and the equation reads:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>The Schrödinger equation has the following properties: some are useful, but there are shortcomings. Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and solutions to the equation.</p>
<h3 id="linearity-1">Linearity</h3>
<p>In the development above, the Schrödinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions <mtpl></mtpl> and <mtpl></mtpl> are solutions, then so is any <a href="linear_combination" title="wikilink">linear combination</a> of the two:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \psi = a\psi_1 + b \psi_2$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wavefunctions). This property allows <a href="Quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">superpositions of quantum states</a> to be solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schrödinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ( x , t )$</span> such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Shrödinger equation are given by <mtpl></mtpl> with amplitude <mtpl></mtpl> and time dependent phase factor is given by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$e^{{-iE_n t}/\hbar},$$</span></p>
<p>then a valid general solution is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \Psi(x,t) = \sum\limits_{n} A_n \psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\hbar}.$$</span></p>
<p>Additionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions <mtpl></mtpl>, then</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \Psi = \sum\limits_{n} A_n \psi_n$$</span></p>
<p>can be normalized by ensuring that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \sum\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1.$$</span></p>
<p>This is much more convenient than having to verify that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\Psi(x)|^2\,dx = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi(x)\Psi^{*}(x)\,dx = 1.$$</span></p>
<h3 id="real-energy-eigenstates">Real energy eigenstates</h3>
<p>For the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions <mtpl></mtpl> and <mtpl></mtpl> are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span>, then so is any linear combination:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat H (a\psi_1 + b \psi_2 ) = a \hat H \psi_1 + b \hat H \psi_2 = E (a \psi_1 + b\psi_2).$$</span></p>
<p>Two different solutions with the same energy are called <em>degenerate</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>In an arbitrary potential, if a wave function <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> solves the time-independent equation, so does its <a href="complex_conjugate" title="wikilink">complex conjugate</a>, denoted <span class="LaTeX">$ψ *$</span>. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.</p>
<p>In the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ( x , t )$</span> is one solution, then so is <span class="LaTeX">$Ψ( x , – t )$</span>. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called <a href="T-symmetry" title="wikilink">time-reversal symmetry</a>.</p>

<p>The Schrödinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).</p>
<p>Explicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates – the equation is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$i\hbar{\partial \Psi \over \partial t} = - {\hbar^2\over 2m} \left ( {\partial^2 \Psi \over \partial x^2} + {\partial^2 \Psi \over \partial y^2} + {\partial^2 \Psi \over \partial z^2} \right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\Psi.\,\!$$</span></p>
<p>The first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at <span class="LaTeX">$t = 0$</span>) of the wavefunction</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Psi(x,y,z,0) \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>is an arbitrary constant. Likewise – the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wavefunction <em>and</em> its first order spatial derivatives</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align} 
& \Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\
& \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) 
\end{align} \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>are all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where <mtpl></mtpl>, <mtpl></mtpl>, <mtpl></mtpl> are a set of points describing boundary <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span> (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the <a href="step_potential" title="wikilink">step potential</a> and <a href="particle_in_a_box" title="wikilink">particle in a box</a> respectively.</p>
<p>As the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wavefunction can be a <a href="Smooth_function" title="wikilink">continuously differentiable function</a> of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wavefunction can be matched.</p>
<p>On the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually <em>second order in time</em>, notable are the family of classical <a href="wave_equation" title="wikilink">wave equations</a> and the quantum <a href="Klein–Gordon_equation" title="wikilink">Klein–Gordon equation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="local-conservation-of-probability">Local conservation of probability</h3>
<p>The Schrödinger equation is consistent with <a href="conservation_of_probability" title="wikilink">probability conservation</a>. Multiplying the Schrödinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wavefunction, and multiplying the wavefunction to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schrödinger equation, and subtracting, gives the <a href="Continuity_equation#Quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">continuity equation</a> for probability:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$${ \partial \over \partial t} \rho\left(\mathbf{r},t\right) + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} = 0,$$</span> where</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\rho=|\Psi|^2=\Psi^*(\mathbf{r},t)\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\,\!$$</span> is the <a href="probability_density_function" title="wikilink">probability density</a> (probability per unit volume, <span class="LaTeX">$*$</span> denotes <a href="complex_conjugate" title="wikilink">complex conjugate</a>), and</p>

<p>Hence predictions from the Schrödinger equation do not violate probability conservation.</p>
<h3 id="positive-energy">Positive energy</h3>
<p>If the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the <a href="variational_principle" title="wikilink">variational principle</a>, as follows. (See also below).</p>
<p>For any linear operator <span class="LaTeX">$Â$</span> <a href="Bounded_operator" title="wikilink">bounded</a> from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> that minimizes the quantity</p>

<p>(using <a href="integration_by_parts" title="wikilink">integration by parts</a>). Due to the <a href="Absolute_value#Complex_numbers" title="wikilink">complex modulus</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> squared (which is positive definite), the right hand side always greater than the lowest value of <span class="LaTeX">$V ( x )$</span>. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when <span class="LaTeX">$V ( x )$</span> is everywhere positive.</p>
<p>For potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wavefunction is real and positive definite – meaning the wavefunction can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wavefunction) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schrödinger equation if this wavefunction is positive definite.</p>
<p>The lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span>, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.</p>
<h3 id="analytic-continuation-to-diffusion">Analytic continuation to diffusion</h3>
<p>The above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the <a href="analytic_continuation" title="wikilink">analytic continuation</a> of the Schrödinger equation to be identified as a <a href="stochastic_process" title="wikilink">stochastic process</a>. This can be interpreted as the <a href="Huygens–Fresnel_principle" title="wikilink">Huygens–Fresnel principle</a> applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability amplitudes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="relativistic-quantum-mechanics">Relativistic quantum mechanics</h2>
<p><a href="Relativistic_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">Relativistic quantum mechanics</a> is obtained where quantum mechanics and <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a> simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build <a href="relativistic_wave_equations" title="wikilink">relativistic wave equations</a> from the relativistic <a href="energy–momentum_relation" title="wikilink">energy–momentum relation</a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \, ,$$</span></p>
<p>instead of classical energy equations. The <a href="Klein–Gordon_equation" title="wikilink">Klein–Gordon equation</a> and the <a href="Dirac_equation" title="wikilink">Dirac equation</a> are two such equations. The Klein–Gordon equation was the first such equation to be obtained, even before the non-relativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the "square root" of the Klein–Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators – one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation.</p>
<p>The general form of the Schrödinger equation remains true in relativity, but the Hamiltonian is less obvious. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass <span class="LaTeX">$m$</span> and electric charge <span class="LaTeX">$q$</span> in an electromagnetic field (described by the <a href="electromagnetic_potential" title="wikilink">electromagnetic potentials</a> <span class="LaTeX">$φ$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ A } $</span>) is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\hat{H}_{\text{Dirac}}= \gamma^0 \left[c  \boldsymbol{\gamma}\cdot\left(\hat{\mathbf{p}} - q \mathbf{A}\right) + mc^2 + \gamma^0q \phi \right]\,,$$</span></p>
<p>in which the <mtpl> (<em>γ</em><sup>1</sup>, <em>γ</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>γ</em><sup>3</sup>)}}</mtpl> and <mtpl></mtpl> are the Dirac <a href="gamma_matrices" title="wikilink">gamma matrices</a> related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all  particles, and the solutions to the equation are  <a href="spinor_field" title="wikilink">spinor fields</a> with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the <a class="uri" href="antiparticle" title="wikilink">antiparticle</a>.</p>
<p>For the Klein–Gordon equation, the general form of the Schrödinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a <a href="Lagrangian_(field_theory)" title="wikilink">Lagrangian density</a> and using the <a href="Euler-Lagrange_equation" title="wikilink">Euler-Lagrange equations</a> for fields, or use the <a href="representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group" title="wikilink">representation theory of the Lorentz group</a> in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).</p>
<p>In general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schrödinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin <span class="LaTeX">$s$</span>, are complex-valued  <a href="spinor_field" title="wikilink">spinor fields</a>.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-field-theory">Quantum field theory</h2>
<p>The general equation is also valid and used in <a href="quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">quantum field theory</a>, both in relativistic and non-relativistic situations. However, the solution <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> is no longer interpreted as a "wave", but should be interpreted as an operator acting on states existing in a <a href="Fock_space" title="wikilink">Fock space</a>.</p>
