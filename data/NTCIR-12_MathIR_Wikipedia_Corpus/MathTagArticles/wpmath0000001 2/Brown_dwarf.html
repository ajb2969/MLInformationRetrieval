<h1>Brown dwarf</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Brown dwarfs</strong> are <a href="substellar_object" title="wikilink">substellar objects</a> not massive enough to sustain <a class="uri" href="hydrogen-1" title="wikilink">hydrogen-1</a> <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">fusion</a> reactions in their cores, unlike <a href="main_sequence" title="wikilink">main-sequence</a> <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a>. They occupy the mass range between the heaviest <a href="gas_giant" title="wikilink">gas giants</a> and the lightest stars, with an upper limit around 75<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to 80 <a href="Jupiter_mass" title="wikilink">Jupiter masses</a> (). Brown dwarfs heavier than about  are thought to <a href="deuterium_burning" title="wikilink">fuse deuterium</a> and those above , <a href="lithium_burning" title="wikilink">fuse lithium</a> as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Brown dwarfs may be fully <a class="uri" href="convective" title="wikilink">convective</a>, with no layers or chemical differentiation by depth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The defining differences between a very-low-mass brown dwarf and a <a href="gas_giant" title="wikilink">giant planet</a> () are debated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> One school of thought is based on formation; the other, on the physics of the interior.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Part of the debate concerns whether "brown dwarfs" must, by definition, have experienced fusion at some point in their history.</p>

<p>Stars are categorized by <a href="spectral_classification" title="wikilink">spectral class</a>, with brown dwarfs being designated as types M, L, T, and Y.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Despite their name, brown dwarfs are of different colors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Many brown dwarfs would likely appear <a class="uri" href="magenta" title="wikilink">magenta</a> to the human eye,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> or possibly orange/red.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Brown dwarfs are not very luminous at visible wavelengths.</p>

<p>Some planets are known to orbit brown dwarfs: <a class="uri" href="2M1207b" title="wikilink">2M1207b</a>, <a class="uri" href="MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb" title="wikilink">MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb</a>, and <a href="2MASS_J044144b" title="wikilink">2MASS J044144b</a></p>

<p>At a distance of about 6.5 light years, the nearest known brown dwarf is <a href="Luhman_16" title="wikilink">Luhman 16</a>, a binary system of brown dwarfs discovered in 2013. One brown dwarf, <a href="DENIS-P_J082303.1-491201_b" title="wikilink">DENIS-P J082303.1-491201 b</a>, from an ultracool binary system, has a mass of about , making it the largest known <a href="List_of_exoplanet_extremes#Planetary_characteristics" title="wikilink">exoplanet</a> (as of March 2014).</p>

<p>The objects now called "brown dwarfs" were theorized to exist in the 1960s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> They were originally called <a href="black_dwarf" title="wikilink">black dwarfs</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> a classification for dark substellar objects floating freely in space that were not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion. However: a) the term <a href="black_dwarf" title="wikilink">black dwarf</a> was already in use to refer to a cold <a href="white_dwarf" title="wikilink">white dwarf</a>; b) <a href="red_dwarf" title="wikilink">red dwarfs</a> fuse hydrogen, and c) these objects may be luminous at visible wavelengths early in their lives. Because of this, alternate names for these objects were proposed, including <a href="Planetar_(astronomy)" title="wikilink">planetar</a> and <a href="Substellar_object" title="wikilink">substar</a>. But in 1975, <a href="Jill_Tarter" title="wikilink">Jill Tarter</a> suggested the term "brown dwarf", using brown as an approximate color.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> This has been the term used in astronomy ever since.</p>

<p>The term black dwarf still refers to a <a href="white_dwarf" title="wikilink">white dwarf</a> that has cooled to the point that it no longer emits significant light.</p>

<p>Early theories concerning the nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a <a href="Population_I" title="wikilink">Population I</a> object with a mass less than 0.07 <a href="solar_mass" title="wikilink">solar masses</a> () or a <a href="Population_II" title="wikilink">Population II</a> object less than  would never go through normal <a href="stellar_evolution" title="wikilink">stellar evolution</a> and would become a completely <a href="degenerate_star" title="wikilink">degenerate star</a> (Kumar 1963).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The first self-consistent calculation of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass confirmed a value between 0.08 and 0.07 solar masses for population I objects (Hayashi and Nakano 1963).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The discovery of <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a>-burning down to 0.012 <a href="solar_mass" title="wikilink">solar masses</a> and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer <a href="atmosphere" title="wikilink">atmospheres</a> of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question. However, such objects were hard to find because they emit almost no visible light. Their strongest emissions are in the <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> (IR) spectrum, and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs.</p>

<p>Since then, numerous searches by various methods have sought to find these objects. These methods included multi-color imaging surveys around field stars, imaging surveys for faint companions to <a href="main_sequence" title="wikilink">main-sequence</a> dwarfs and <a href="white_dwarfs" title="wikilink">white dwarfs</a>, surveys of young star clusters, and <a href="radial_velocity" title="wikilink">radial velocity</a> monitoring for close companions.</p>

<p>For many years, efforts to discover brown dwarfs were fruitless. In 1988, however, <a href="University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">University of California, Los Angeles</a> professors <a href="Eric_Becklin" title="wikilink">Eric Becklin</a> and <a href="Benjamin_Zuckerman" title="wikilink">Ben Zuckerman</a> identified a faint companion to a star known as <a href="GD_165" title="wikilink">GD 165</a> in an infrared search of white dwarfs. The spectrum of the companion GD 165B was very red and enigmatic, showing none of the features expected of a low-mass <a href="red_dwarf" title="wikilink">red dwarf</a>. It became clear that GD 165B would need to be classified as a much cooler object than the latest M dwarfs then known. GD 165B remained unique for almost a decade until the advent of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (<a class="uri" href="2MASS" title="wikilink">2MASS</a>) when <a href="J._Davy_Kirkpatrick" title="wikilink">Davy Kirkpatrick</a>, of the <a href="California_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">California Institute of Technology</a>, and others discovered many objects with similar colors and spectral features.</p>

<p>Today, GD 165B is recognized as the prototype of a class of objects now called "L dwarfs".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Although the discovery of the coolest dwarf was highly significant at the time, it was debated whether GD 165B would be classified as a brown dwarf or simply a very-low-mass star, because observationally it is very difficult to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>Soon after the discovery of GD 165B, other brown-dwarf candidates were reported. Most failed to live up to their candidacy, however, because the absence of lithium showed them to be stellar objects. True stars <a href="lithium_burning" title="wikilink">burn their lithium</a> within a little over 100 <a class="uri" href="Myr" title="wikilink">Myr</a>, whereas brown dwarfs (which can, confusingly, have temperatures and luminosities similar to true stars) will not. In other words, the detection of lithium in the atmosphere of a candidate object ensures that, as long as it is older than the relatively young age of 100 Myr, it is a brown dwarf.</p>

<p>In 1995, the study of brown dwarfs changed substantially with the discovery of two incontrovertible substellar objects (<a href="Teide_1" title="wikilink">Teide 1</a> and <a href="Gliese_229B" title="wikilink">Gliese 229B</a>),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> which were identified by the presence of the 670.8 nm lithium line. The more notable of these objects was the latter, which was found to have a temperature and luminosity well below the stellar range. Remarkably, its near-infrared spectrum clearly exhibited a methane absorption band at 2 micrometres, a feature that had previously only been observed in the atmospheres of giant planets and that of <a class="uri" href="Saturn" title="wikilink">Saturn</a>'s moon <a href="Titan_(moon)" title="wikilink">Titan</a>. Methane absorption is not expected at the temperatures of main-sequence stars. This discovery helped to establish yet another spectral class even cooler than L dwarfs, known as "T dwarfs", for which Gliese 229B is the prototype.</p>

<p>The first confirmed brown dwarf was discovered by Spanish astrophysicists <a href=":es:Rafael_Rebolo_López" title="wikilink">Rafael Rebolo</a> (head of team), Maria Rosa Zapatero Osorio, and Eduardo Martín in 1994.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> They called this object <a href="Teide_1" title="wikilink">Teide 1</a> and it was found in the <a class="uri" href="Pleiades" title="wikilink">Pleiades</a> open cluster. The discovery article was submitted to <em>Nature</em> in spring 1995, and published on September 14, 1995.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> <em>Nature</em> highlighted "Brown dwarfs discovered, official" in the front page of that issue.</p>

<p>Teide 1 was discovered in images collected by the <a href="Instituto_de_Astrofísica_de_Canarias" title="wikilink">IAC</a> team on January 6, 1994 using the 80 cm telescope (IAC 80) at <a href="Teide_Observatory" title="wikilink">Teide Observatory</a> and its spectrum was first recorded in December 1994 using the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope at <a href="Roque_de_los_Muchachos_Observatory" title="wikilink">Roque de los Muchachos Observatory</a> (La Palma). The distance, chemical composition, and age of Teide 1 could be established because of its membership in the young Pleiades star cluster. Using the most advanced stellar and substellar evolution models at that moment, the team estimated for Teide 1 a mass of , which is clearly below the stellar-mass limit. The object became a reference in subsequent young brown dwarf related works.</p>

<p>In theory, a brown dwarf below  is unable to burn lithium by thermonuclear fusion at any time during its evolution. This fact is one of the lithium test principles to examine the substellar nature in low-luminosity and low-surface-temperature astronomical bodies.</p>

<p>High-quality spectral data acquired by the Keck 1 telescope in November 1995 showed that Teide 1 had kept the initial lithium amount of the original molecular cloud from which Pleiades stars formed, proving the lack of thermonuclear fusion in its core. These observations confirmed that Teide 1 is a brown dwarf, as well as the efficiency of the spectroscopic <a href="Lithium_burning" title="wikilink">lithium test</a>.</p>

<p>For some time, Teide 1 was the smallest known object outside the Solar System that had been identified by direct observation. Since then, over 1,800 brown dwarfs have been identified,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> even some very close to Earth like <a href="Epsilon_Indi" title="wikilink">Epsilon Indi</a> Ba and Bb, a pair of brown dwarfs gravitationally bound to a Sun-like star around 12 light-years from the Sun, and <a href="Luhman_16" title="wikilink">Luhman 16</a>, a binary system of brown dwarfs about 6.5 light-years away.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

<p>The standard mechanism for <a href="stellar_evolution" title="wikilink">star birth</a> is through the gravitational collapse of a cold interstellar cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud contracts it heats due to the <a href="Kelvin–Helmholtz_mechanism" title="wikilink">Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism</a>. Early in the process the contracting gas quickly radiates away much of the energy, allowing the collapse to continue. Eventually, the central region becomes sufficiently dense to trap radiation. Consequently, the central temperature and density of the collapsed cloud increases dramatically with time, slowing the contraction, until the conditions are hot and dense enough for thermonuclear reactions to occur in the core of the <a class="uri" href="protostar" title="wikilink">protostar</a>. For most stars, gas and radiation pressure generated by the <a href="thermonuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">thermonuclear fusion</a> reactions within the core of the star will support it against any further gravitational contraction. <a href="Hydrostatic_equilibrium" title="wikilink">Hydrostatic equilibrium</a> is reached and the star will spend most of its lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium as a main-sequence star.</p>

<p>If, however, the mass of the protostar is less than about , normal hydrogen <a href="thermonuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">thermonuclear fusion</a> reactions will not ignite in the core. Gravitational contraction does not heat the small <a class="uri" href="protostar" title="wikilink">protostar</a> very effectively, and before the temperature in the core can increase enough to trigger fusion, the density reaches the point where electrons become closely packed enough to create quantum <a href="electron_degeneracy_pressure" title="wikilink">electron degeneracy pressure</a>. According to the brown dwarf interior models, typical conditions in the core for density, temperature and pressure are expected to be the following:</p>

<p>This means that the protostar is not massive enough and not dense enough to ever reach the conditions needed to sustain hydrogen fusion. The infalling matter is prevented, by electron degeneracy pressure, from reaching the densities and pressures needed.</p>

<p>Further gravitational contraction is prevented and the result is a "failed star", or brown dwarf that simply cools off by radiating away its internal thermal energy.</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="Lithium" title="wikilink">Lithium</a> is generally present in brown dwarfs and not in low-mass stars. Stars, which reach the high temperature necessary for fusing hydrogen, rapidly deplete their lithium. This occurs by a collision of <a class="uri" href="lithium-7" title="wikilink">lithium-7</a> and a <a class="uri" href="proton" title="wikilink">proton</a> producing two <a class="uri" href="helium-4" title="wikilink">helium-4</a> nuclei. The temperature necessary for this reaction is just below the temperature necessary for hydrogen fusion. Convection in low-mass stars ensures that lithium in the whole volume of the star is depleted. Therefore, the presence of the lithium <a href="spectral_line" title="wikilink">line</a> in a candidate brown dwarf's spectrum is a strong indicator that it is indeed substellar. The use of lithium to distinguish candidate brown dwarfs from low-mass stars is commonly referred to as the <strong>lithium test</strong>, and was pioneered by <a href="Rafael_Rebolo" title="wikilink">Rafael Rebolo</a>, <a href="Eduardo_Martín" title="wikilink">Eduardo Martín</a> and <a href="Antonio_Magazzu" title="wikilink">Antonio Magazzu</a>. However, lithium is also seen in very young stars, which have not yet had enough time to burn it all. Heavier stars, like the Sun, can retain lithium in their outer atmospheres, which never get hot enough for lithium depletion, but those are distinguishable from brown dwarfs by their size. On the contrary, brown dwarfs at the high end of their mass range can be hot enough to deplete their lithium when they are young. Dwarfs of mass greater than  can burn off their lithium by the time they are half a billion years old,<ref></ref></li>
</ul>

<p> thus this test is not perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike stars, older brown dwarfs are sometimes cool enough that, over very long periods of time, their atmospheres can gather observable quantities of <a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a>. Dwarfs confirmed in this fashion include <a href="Gliese_229B" title="wikilink">Gliese 229B</a>.</li>
<li>Main-sequence stars cool, but eventually reach a minimum <a href="bolometric_luminosity" title="wikilink">bolometric luminosity</a> that they can sustain through steady fusion. This varies from star to star, but is generally at least 0.01% that of the Sun. Brown dwarfs cool and darken steadily over their lifetimes: sufficiently old brown dwarfs will be too faint to be detectable.</li>
<li><a href="Iron_rain" title="wikilink">Iron rain</a> as part of atmospheric convection processes is possible only in brown dwarfs, and not in small stars. The spectroscopy research into iron rain is still ongoing—and not all brown dwarfs will always have this atmospheric anomaly. In 2013, a heterogeneous iron-containing atmosphere was imaged around the B component in the close <a href="Luhman_16" title="wikilink">Luhman 16</a> system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></li>

<p>A remarkable property of brown dwarfs is that they are all roughly the same radius as Jupiter. At the high end of their mass range (), the volume of a brown dwarf is governed primarily by <a href="degenerate_matter" title="wikilink">electron-degeneracy</a> pressure,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> as it is in white dwarfs; at the low end of the range (), their volume is governed primarily by <a href="Coulomb_barrier" title="wikilink">Coulomb pressure</a>, as it is in planets. The net result is that the radii of brown dwarfs vary by only 10–15% over the range of possible masses. This can make distinguishing them from planets difficult.</p>

<p>In addition, many brown dwarfs undergo no fusion; those at the low end of the mass range (under ) are never hot enough to <a href="deuterium_burning" title="wikilink">fuse even deuterium</a>, and even those at the high end of the mass range (over ) cool quickly enough that they no longer undergo fusion after a period of time on the order of 10 million years.</p>

<p>X-ray and infrared spectra are telltale signs. Some brown dwarfs emit <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a>; and all "warm" dwarfs continue to glow tellingly in the red and <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> spectra until they cool to planetlike temperatures (under 1000 K).</p>

<p><a href="Gas_giant" title="wikilink">Gas giants</a> have some of the characteristics of brown dwarfs. For example, <a class="uri" href="Jupiter" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a> and <a class="uri" href="Saturn" title="wikilink">Saturn</a> are both made primarily of hydrogen and helium, like the Sun. Saturn is nearly as large as Jupiter, despite having only 30% the mass. Three of the giant planets in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, and <a class="uri" href="Neptune" title="wikilink">Neptune</a>) emit much more heat than they receive from the Sun.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> And all four giant planets have their own "planetary systems"—their moons. Brown dwarfs form independently, like stars, but lack sufficient mass to "ignite" as stars do. Like all stars, they can occur singly or in close proximity to other stars. Some orbit stars and can, like planets, have eccentric orbits.</p>

<p>Currently, the <a href="International_Astronomical_Union" title="wikilink">International Astronomical Union</a> considers an object with a mass above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be  for objects of solar metallicity) to be a brown dwarf, whereas an object under that mass (and orbiting a star or stellar remnant) is considered a planet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the 13 Jupiter mass value is somewhere in between.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a> and <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the radiative cooling rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Extrasolar_Planets_Encyclopaedia" title="wikilink">Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia</a> includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, and the <a href="Exoplanet_Data_Explorer" title="wikilink">Exoplanet Data Explorer</a> up to 24 Jupiter masses.</p>

<p>A <strong>sub-brown dwarf</strong> or <strong>planetary-mass brown dwarf</strong> is an astronomical object formed in the same manner as <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a> and brown dwarfs (i.e. through the collapse of a <a href="nebula" title="wikilink">gas cloud</a>) but that has a <a href="planetary_mass_object" title="wikilink">mass below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion</a> of <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a> (about ).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> Some researchers call them free-floating planets<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> whereas others call them planetary-mass brown dwarfs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>The defining characteristic of <a href="spectral_class" title="wikilink">spectral class</a> M, the coolest type in the long-standing classical stellar sequence, is an optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of <a href="titanium(II)_oxide" title="wikilink">titanium(II) oxide</a> (TiO) and <a href="vanadium(II)_oxide" title="wikilink">vanadium(II) oxide</a> (VO) molecules. However, <a href="GD_165B" title="wikilink">GD 165B</a>, the cool companion to the white dwarf <a href="GD_165" title="wikilink">GD 165</a>, had none of the hallmark TiO features of M dwarfs. The subsequent identification of many field counterparts to GD 165B ultimately led Kirkpatrick and others to the definition of a new <a href="spectral_class" title="wikilink">spectral class</a>, the <strong>L dwarfs</strong>, defined in the red optical region not by weakening metal-oxide bands (TiO, VO), but strong metal <a class="uri" href="hydride" title="wikilink">hydride</a> bands (<a href="iron(I)_hydride" title="wikilink">FeH</a>, <a href="chromium_hydride" title="wikilink">CrH</a>, <a href="magnesium_hydride" title="wikilink">MgH</a>, <a href="calcium_hydride" title="wikilink">CaH</a>) and prominent <a href="alkali_metal" title="wikilink">alkali metal</a> lines (Na I, K I, Cs I, Rb I). , over 900 L dwarfs have been identified,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> most by wide-field surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (<a class="uri" href="2MASS" title="wikilink">2MASS</a>), the Deep Near Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky (<a href="Deep_Near_Infrared_Survey" title="wikilink">DENIS</a>), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (<a href="Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey" title="wikilink">SDSS</a>).</p>

<p>As GD 165B is the prototype of the L dwarfs, <a href="Gliese_229" title="wikilink">Gliese 229B</a> is the prototype of a second new spectral class, the <strong>T dwarfs</strong>. Whereas <a class="uri" href="near-infrared" title="wikilink">near-infrared</a> (NIR) spectra of L dwarfs show strong absorption bands of H<sub>2</sub>O and <a href="carbon_monoxide" title="wikilink">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), the NIR spectrum of Gliese 229B is dominated by absorption bands from <a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a> (CH<sub>4</sub>), features that were only found in the giant planets of the Solar System and <a href="Titan_(moon)" title="wikilink">Titan</a>. CH<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and molecular <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> (H<sub>2</sub>) collision-induced absorption (CIA) give Gliese 229B blue near-infrared colors. Its steeply sloped red optical spectrum also lacks the FeH and CrH bands that characterize L dwarfs and instead is influenced by exceptionally broad absorption features from the <a class="uri" href="alkali" title="wikilink">alkali</a> metals <a href="sodium" title="wikilink">Na</a> and <a href="potassium" title="wikilink">K</a>. These differences led Kirkpatrick to propose the T spectral class for objects exhibiting H- and K-band CH<sub>4</sub> absorption. , 355 T dwarfs are known.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> NIR classification schemes for T dwarfs have recently been developed by Adam Burgasser and Tom Geballe. Theory suggests that L dwarfs are a mixture of very-low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs), whereas the T dwarf class is composed entirely of brown dwarfs. Because of the absorption of <a class="uri" href="sodium" title="wikilink">sodium</a> and <a class="uri" href="potassium" title="wikilink">potassium</a> in the green part of the spectrum of T dwarfs, the actual appearance of T dwarfs to human <a href="visual_perception" title="wikilink">visual perception</a> is estimated to be not brown, but the color of <a href="Magenta_(color)#Magenta_dye_(1860)" title="wikilink">magenta coal tar dye</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> T-class brown dwarfs, such as <a href="WISE_0316+4307" title="wikilink">WISE 0316+4307</a>, have been detected over 100 light-years from the Sun.</p>

<p>The majority of flux emitted by L and T dwarfs is in the 1 to 2.5 micrometre near-infrared range.

<p>X-ray flares detected from brown dwarfs since 1999 suggest changing <a href="magnetic_field_of_celestial_bodies" title="wikilink">magnetic fields</a> within them, similar to those in very-low-mass stars.</p>

<p>With no strong central nuclear energy source, the interior of a brown dwarf is in a rapid boiling, or convective state. When combined with the rapid rotation that most brown dwarfs exhibit, <a class="uri" href="convection" title="wikilink">convection</a> sets up conditions for the development of a strong, tangled <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a> near the surface. The flare observed by <a href="Chandra_X-ray_Observatory" title="wikilink">Chandra</a> from LP 944-20 could have its origin in the turbulent magnetized hot material beneath the brown dwarf's surface. A sub-surface flare could conduct heat to the atmosphere, allowing electric currents to flow and produce an X-ray flare, like a stroke of <a class="uri" href="lightning" title="wikilink">lightning</a>. The absence of X-rays from LP 944-20 during the non-flaring period is also a significant result. It sets the lowest observational limit on steady X-ray power produced by a brown dwarf, and shows that coronas cease to exist as the surface temperature of a brown dwarf cools below about 2800K and becomes electrically neutral.</p>

Astronomers from <a href="Pennsylvania_State_University" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania State University</a> have detected what they believe to be a disk of gas and dust similar to the one hypothesized to have formed the Solar System. Cha 110913-773444 is the smallest brown dwarf found to date (), and if it formed a planetary system, it would be the smallest known object to have one. Their findings were published in the December 10, 2005 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>Recent observations of known brown dwarf candidates have revealed a pattern of brightening and dimming of infrared emissions that suggests relatively cool, opaque cloud patterns obscuring a hot interior that is stirred by extreme winds. The weather on such bodies is thought to be extremely violent, comparable to but far exceeding Jupiter's famous storms.</p>

<p>On January 8, 2013 astronomers using NASA's <a href="Hubble_space_telescope" title="wikilink">Hubble</a> and <a href="Spitzer_space_telescope" title="wikilink">Spitzer</a> space telescopes probed the stormy atmosphere of a brown dwarf named <a href="2MASS_J22282889-431026" title="wikilink">2MASS J22282889-431026</a>, creating the most detailed "weather map" of a brown dwarf thus far. It shows wind-driven, planet-sized clouds. The new research is a stepping stone toward a better understanding not only brown dwarfs, but also of the atmospheres of planets beyond the Solar System.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a>'s <a href="Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer" title="wikilink">WISE</a> mission has detected 200 new brown dwarfs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="planets-around-brown-dwarfs">Planets around brown dwarfs</h2>

<p> The planetary-mass objects <a class="uri" href="2M1207b" title="wikilink">2M1207b</a> and <a href="2MASS_J044144" title="wikilink">2MASS J044144</a> that are orbiting brown dwarfs at large orbital distances may have formed by <a href="cloud_collapse" title="wikilink">cloud collapse</a> rather than accretion and so may be <a href="sub-brown_dwarf" title="wikilink">sub-brown dwarfs</a> rather than <a href="planet" title="wikilink">planets</a>, which is inferred from relatively large masses and large orbits. The first discovery of a low-mass companion orbiting a brown dwarf (<a class="uri" href="ChaHα8" title="wikilink">ChaHα8</a>) at a small orbital distance using the <a href="Doppler_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">radial velocity technique</a> paved the way for the detection of planets around brown dwarfs on orbits of a few AU or smaller.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> However, with a mass ratio between the companion and primary in <a class="uri" href="ChaHα8" title="wikilink">ChaHα8</a> of about 0.3, this system rather resembles a binary star. Then, in 2013, the first planetary-mass companion (OGLE-2012-BLG-0358L b) in a relatively small orbit was discovered orbiting a brown dwarf.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="circumstellar_disk" title="wikilink">Disks</a> around brown dwarfs have been found to have many of the same features as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> If a giant planet orbits a brown dwarf across our line of sight, then, because they have approximately the same diameter, this would give a large signal for <a href="Transit_method" title="wikilink">detection by transit</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> The accretion zone for planets around a brown dwarf is very close to the brown dwarf itself, so tidal forces would have a strong effect.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p>Planets around brown dwarfs are likely to be <a href="carbon_planet" title="wikilink">carbon planets</a> depleted of water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="habitability">Habitability</h3>

<p>Habitability for hypothetical planets orbiting brown dwarfs has been studied. Computer models suggesting conditions for these bodies to have <a href="habitable_planet" title="wikilink">habitable planets</a> are very stringent, the <a href="habitable_zone" title="wikilink">habitable zone</a> being narrow and decreasing with time, due to the cooling of the brown dwarf. The <a href="orbit" title="wikilink">orbits</a> there would have to be of <em>very</em> low <a href="Eccentricity_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">eccentricity</a> (of the order of 10<sup>−6</sup>) to avoid strong <a href="tidal_force" title="wikilink">tidal forces</a> that would trigger a <a href="greenhouse_effect" title="wikilink">greenhouse effect</a> on the planets, rendering them uninhabitable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<li>In 1984, it was postulated by some astronomers that the Sun may be orbited by an undetected brown dwarf (sometimes referred to as <a href="Nemesis_(hypothetical_star)" title="wikilink">Nemesis</a>) that could interact with the <a href="Oort_cloud" title="wikilink">Oort cloud</a> just as <a href="List_of_nearest_stars#Future_and_past" title="wikilink">passing stars</a> can.
