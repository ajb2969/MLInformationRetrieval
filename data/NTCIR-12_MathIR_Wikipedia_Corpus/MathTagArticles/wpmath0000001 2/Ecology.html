<h1>Ecology</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Ecology</strong> (from , "house"; -λογία, "study of") is the <a href="science" title="wikilink">scientific</a> analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an <a class="uri" href="interdisciplinary" title="wikilink">interdisciplinary</a> field that includes <a class="uri" href="biology" title="wikilink">biology</a> and <a href="Earth_science" title="wikilink">Earth science</a>. Ecology includes the study of interactions <a href="organism" title="wikilink">organisms</a> have with each other, other organisms, and with <a href="abiotic_component" title="wikilink">abiotic components</a> of their <a href="environment_(biophysical)" title="wikilink">environment</a>. Topics of interest to ecologists include the <a href="biodiversity" title="wikilink">diversity</a>, distribution, amount (<a class="uri" href="biomass" title="wikilink">biomass</a>), and number (<a class="uri" href="population" title="wikilink">population</a>) of particular organisms; as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. <a class="uri" href="Ecosystems" title="wikilink">Ecosystems</a> are composed of dynamically interacting parts including <a class="uri" href="organisms" title="wikilink">organisms</a>, the <a href="Community_(ecology)" title="wikilink">communities</a> they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as <a href="primary_production" title="wikilink">primary production</a>, <a class="uri" href="pedogenesis" title="wikilink">pedogenesis</a>, <a href="nutrient_cycling" title="wikilink">nutrient cycling</a>, and various <a href="niche_construction" title="wikilink">niche construction</a> activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. <a class="uri" href="Biodiversity" title="wikilink">Biodiversity</a>, which refers to the varieties of <a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a>, <a href="gene" title="wikilink">genes</a>, and <a href="ecosystem" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a>, enhances certain <a href="ecosystem_services" title="wikilink">ecosystem services</a>.</p>

<p>Ecology is not synonymous with environment, <a class="uri" href="environmentalism" title="wikilink">environmentalism</a>, natural history, or <a href="environmental_science" title="wikilink">environmental science</a>. It is closely related to <a href="evolutionary_biology" title="wikilink">evolutionary biology</a>, <a class="uri" href="genetics" title="wikilink">genetics</a>, and <a class="uri" href="ethology" title="wikilink">ethology</a>. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Life processes, interactions and <a class="uri" href="adaptations" title="wikilink">adaptations</a></li>
<li>The movement of materials and <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> through living communities</li>
<li>The <a href="ecological_succession" title="wikilink">successional</a> development of ecosystems</li>
<li>The <a href="Abundance_(ecology)" title="wikilink">abundance</a> and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the context of the <a href="environment_(biophysical)" title="wikilink">environment</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ecology is a human science as well. There are many practical applications of ecology in <a href="conservation_biology" title="wikilink">conservation biology</a>, wetland management, <a href="natural_resource_management" title="wikilink">natural resource management</a> (<a class="uri" href="agroecology" title="wikilink">agroecology</a>, <a class="uri" href="agriculture" title="wikilink">agriculture</a>, <a class="uri" href="forestry" title="wikilink">forestry</a>, <a class="uri" href="agroforestry" title="wikilink">agroforestry</a>, <a class="uri" href="fisheries" title="wikilink">fisheries</a>), city planning (<a href="urban_ecology" title="wikilink">urban ecology</a>), <a href="community_health" title="wikilink">community health</a>, <a href="Ecological_economics" title="wikilink">economics</a>, <a href="basic_science" title="wikilink">basic</a> and <a href="applied_science" title="wikilink">applied science</a>, and human social interaction (<a href="human_ecology" title="wikilink">human ecology</a>). For example, the <em><a href="Circles_of_Sustainability" title="wikilink">Circles of Sustainability</a></em> approach treats ecology as more than the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and <a href="Resource_(biology)" title="wikilink">resources</a> compose <a href="ecosystem" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a> which, in turn, maintain <a href="Biophysics" title="wikilink">biophysical</a> feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living (<a href="Biotic_component" title="wikilink">biotic</a>) and non-living (<a class="uri" href="abiotic" title="wikilink">abiotic</a>) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce <a href="natural_capital" title="wikilink">natural capital</a> like biomass production (food, fuel, fiber and medicine), the regulation of <a class="uri" href="climate" title="wikilink">climate</a>, global <a href="biogeochemical_cycles" title="wikilink">biogeochemical cycles</a>, <a href="water_filtration" title="wikilink">water filtration</a>, <a href="soil_formation" title="wikilink">soil formation</a>, erosion control, flood protection and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.</p>

<p>The word "ecology" ("Ökologie") was coined in <a class="uri" href="1866" title="wikilink">1866</a> by the German scientist <a href="Ernst_Haeckel" title="wikilink">Ernst Haeckel</a> (1834–1919). Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ancient Greek philosophers such as <a class="uri" href="Hippocrates" title="wikilink">Hippocrates</a> and <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a>. Modern ecology became a much more rigorous <a href="natural_sciences" title="wikilink">science</a> in the late 19th century. <a href="Evolution" title="wikilink">Evolutionary</a> concepts relating to adaptation and <a href="natural_selection" title="wikilink">natural selection</a> became the cornerstones of modern <a href="Theoretical_ecology" title="wikilink">ecological theory</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Ecosystems regenerate after a disturbance such as fire, forming <a href="Mosaic_(ecology)" title="wikilink">mosaics</a> of different age groups structured across a <a href="Landscape_ecology" title="wikilink">landscape</a>. Pictured are different seral stages in forested ecosystems starting from pioneers colonizing a disturbed site and maturing in <a href="succession(ecology)" title="wikilink">successional stages</a> leading to <a href="old-growth_forests" title="wikilink">old-growth forests</a>.</figcaption>

<p>The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., <a href="cell_(biology)" title="wikilink">cells</a>) to planetary scale (e.g., <a href="Earth's_spheres" title="wikilink">biosphere</a>) <a class="uri" href="phenomena" title="wikilink">phenomena</a>. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic <a href="Resource_(biology)" title="wikilink">resources</a> and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into <a href="population" title="wikilink">populations</a> which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain <a href="ecological_succession" title="wikilink">successional stages</a> of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Several generations of an <a class="uri" href="aphid" title="wikilink">aphid</a> population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse <a href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacterial</a> communities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="hierarchical-ecology">Hierarchical ecology</h3>

<p>The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system, such as aphids migrating on a single tree, while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences, such as atmosphere or climate. Hence, ecologists classify <a class="uri" href="ecosystems" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a> hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, <a class="uri" href="landscape" title="wikilink">landscape</a>, and chronological scales.</p>

<p>To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a <a href="Biological_classification" title="wikilink">nested hierarchy</a>, ranging in scale from <a href="gene" title="wikilink">genes</a>, to <a href="cell_(biology)" title="wikilink">cells</a>, to <a href="tissue_(biology)" title="wikilink">tissues</a>, to <a href="Organ_(anatomy)" title="wikilink">organs</a>, to <a href="organism" title="wikilink">organisms</a>, to <a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a>, to <a href="population_ecology" title="wikilink">populations</a>, to <a href="Community_(ecology)" title="wikilink">communities</a>, to <a href="ecosystem" title="wikilink">ecosystems</a>, to <a href="biome" title="wikilink">biomes</a>, and up to the level of the <a class="uri" href="biosphere" title="wikilink">biosphere</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This framework forms a <a class="uri" href="panarchy" title="wikilink">panarchy</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and exhibits <a class="uri" href="non-linear" title="wikilink">non-linear</a> behaviors; this means that "effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of <a href="nitrogen_fixation" title="wikilink">nitrogen fixers</a>, can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="biodiversity">Biodiversity</h3>

<p>Biodiversity (an abbreviation of "biological diversity") describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization. The term has several interpretations, and there are many ways to index, measure, characterize, and represent its complex organization.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Biodiversity includes <a href="species_diversity" title="wikilink">species diversity</a>, <a href="ecosystem_diversity" title="wikilink">ecosystem diversity</a>, and <a href="genetic_diversity" title="wikilink">genetic diversity</a> and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Biodiversity plays an important role in <a href="ecosystem_service" title="wikilink">ecosystem services</a> which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Preventing <a href="extinction" title="wikilink">species extinctions</a> is one way to preserve biodiversity and that goal rests on techniques that preserve genetic diversity, habitat and the ability for species to migrate. Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity. <a href="Natural_capital" title="wikilink">Natural capital</a> that supports populations is critical for maintaining <a href="ecosystem_services" title="wikilink">ecosystem services</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and species <a href="Animal_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> (e.g., riverine fish runs and avian insect control) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications for species and ecosystem-level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to consulting firms, governments, and industry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="habitat">Habitat</h3>

<p>The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> More specifically, "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a <a href="Montane_ecology" title="wikilink">montane</a> or <a href="alpine_climate" title="wikilink">alpine</a> ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizards (<em>Tropidurus hispidus</em>) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. <a class="uri" href="Biotope" title="wikilink">Biotope</a> and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Additionally, some species are <a href="ecosystem_engineer" title="wikilink">ecosystem engineers</a>, altering the environment within a localized region. For instance, beavers manage water levels by building dams which improves their habitat in a landscape.</p>

<p>Definitions of the niche date back to 1917,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> but <a href="G._Evelyn_Hutchinson" title="wikilink">G. Evelyn Hutchinson</a> made conceptual advances in 1957<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> by introducing a widely adopted definition: "the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub-divided into the <em>fundamental</em> and the <em>realized</em> niche. The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a "<a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean</a> <a href="N-dimensional_space" title="wikilink">hyperspace</a> whose <em>dimensions</em> are defined as environmental variables and whose <em>size</em> is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has <em>positive fitness</em>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Biogeography" title="wikilink">Biogeographical</a> patterns and <a href="Range_(biology)" title="wikilink">range</a> distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species' <a href="trait_(biology)" title="wikilink">traits</a> and niche requirements.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, <a class="uri" href="phenotype" title="wikilink">phenotype</a>, or <a href="Phenotypic_trait" title="wikilink">characteristic</a> of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The <a href="competitive_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">competitive exclusion principle</a> states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting <a href="Resource_(biology)" title="wikilink">resource</a>; one will always outcompete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the coevolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The habitat plus the niche is called the <a class="uri" href="ecotope" title="wikilink">ecotope</a>, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="niche-construction">Niche construction</h3>

<p>Organisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The <a href="negative_feedback" title="wikilink">regulatory feedback</a> between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a <a class="uri" href="beaver" title="wikilink">beaver</a> <a class="uri" href="pond" title="wikilink">pond</a>) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or <a class="uri" href="silica" title="wikilink">silica</a> skeleton deposits from marine organisms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The process and concept of <a href="ecosystem_engineering" title="wikilink">ecosystem engineering</a> is related to <a href="niche_construction" title="wikilink">niche construction</a>, but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: "organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term "niche construction" is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of <a href="social_insects" title="wikilink">social insects</a>, including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent <a class="uri" href="homeostasis" title="wikilink">homeostasis</a> or <a class="uri" href="homeorhesis" title="wikilink">homeorhesis</a> in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="biome">Biome</h3>

<p>Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include <a href="tropical_rainforest" title="wikilink">tropical rainforest</a>, <a href="temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest" title="wikilink">temperate broadleaf and mixed forest</a>, <a href="temperate_deciduous_forest" title="wikilink">temperate deciduous forest</a>, <a class="uri" href="taiga" title="wikilink">taiga</a>, <a class="uri" href="tundra" title="wikilink">tundra</a>, <a href="hot_desert" title="wikilink">hot desert</a>, and <a href="polar_desert" title="wikilink">polar desert</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic <a href="microbiome" title="wikilink">microbiomes</a>. To a microbe, the human body is a habitat and a landscape.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in <a href="molecular_genetics" title="wikilink">molecular genetics</a>, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="biosphere">Biosphere</h3>

<p>The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. <a href="Ecological_relationship" title="wikilink">Ecological relationships</a> regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the <a href="Gaia_hypothesis" title="wikilink">Gaia hypothesis</a> is an example of <a class="uri" href="holism" title="wikilink">holism</a> applied in ecological theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent <a href="feedback_loop" title="wikilink">feedback loop</a> generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="population-ecology">Population ecology</h3>

<p>Population ecology studies the dynamics of specie populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact and migrate through the same niche and habitat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>A primary law of population ecology is the <a href="Malthusian_growth_model" title="wikilink">Malthusian growth model</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> which states, "a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Simplified population <a href="Scientific_modelling" title="wikilink">models</a> usually start with four variables: death, birth, <a class="uri" href="immigration" title="wikilink">immigration</a>, and <a class="uri" href="emigration" title="wikilink">emigration</a>.</p>

<p>An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that <a class="uri" href="random" title="wikilink">random</a> processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:</p>

<p>Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include <a href="Biological_life_cycle" title="wikilink">life history</a>, <a class="uri" href="fecundity" title="wikilink">fecundity</a>, and survivorship, and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as <a href="matrix_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">matrix algebra</a>. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> In cases where basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods, such as the <a href="Akaike_information_criterion" title="wikilink">Akaike information criterion</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> or use models that can become mathematically complex as "several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="metapopulations-and-migration">Metapopulations and migration</h4>

<p>The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> as "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in <a href="conservation_biology" title="wikilink">conservation research</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement because it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration because it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>In metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of <a href="Juvenile_(organism)" title="wikilink">juveniles</a> that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and <a href="field_study" title="wikilink">field studies</a> to explain metapopulation structure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>Ecosystems are habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes. The underlying concept can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of <a href="George_Perkins_Marsh" title="wikilink">George Perkins Marsh</a> ("Man and Nature").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales of time and space.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Ecosystems are broadly categorized as <a href="Terrestrial_ecosystem" title="wikilink">terrestrial</a>, <a href="Freshwater_ecosystem" title="wikilink">freshwater</a>, atmospheric, or <a href="Marine_ecosystem" title="wikilink">marine</a>.

<h4 id="food-webs">Food webs</h4>

<p>A food web is the archetypal <a href="ecological_network" title="wikilink">ecological network</a>. Plants capture <a href="solar_energy" title="wikilink">solar energy</a> and use it to synthesize <a href="simple_sugars" title="wikilink">simple sugars</a> during <a class="uri" href="photosynthesis" title="wikilink">photosynthesis</a>. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing <a class="uri" href="herbivores" title="wikilink">herbivores</a>, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal <a href="trophic_species" title="wikilink">trophic species</a> to a top consumer is called the <a href="food_chain" title="wikilink">food chain</a>. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of <a href="concept_map" title="wikilink">concept map</a> or a <a class="uri" href="heuristic" title="wikilink">heuristic</a> device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>

<p>Food webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web <a href="Microcosm_(experimental_ecosystem)" title="wikilink">microcosm</a> studies are extrapolated to larger systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., <a class="uri" href="omnivores" title="wikilink">omnivores</a>) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., <a href="predator" title="wikilink">primary predators</a>). Theoretical and empirical studies identify <a href="Random#In_biology" title="wikilink">non-random</a> emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups.

The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown to the right of the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of numbers, 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A trophic level (from Greek <em>troph</em>, τροφή, trophē, meaning "food" or "feeding") is "a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the adjacent level nearer the abiotic source."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or <a class="uri" href="trophism" title="wikilink">trophism</a> among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the <a href="Relative_species_abundance" title="wikilink">abundance</a> or biomass at each level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a 'pyramid of numbers'.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

<p>Species are broadly categorized as <a class="uri" href="autotrophs" title="wikilink">autotrophs</a> (or <a href="primary_producers" title="wikilink">primary producers</a>), <a class="uri" href="heterotrophs" title="wikilink">heterotrophs</a> (or <a href="consumer" title="wikilink">consumers</a>), and <a href="Detritivore" title="wikilink">Detritivores</a> (or <a class="uri" href="decomposers" title="wikilink">decomposers</a>). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or <a class="uri" href="chemosynthesis" title="wikilink">chemosynthesis</a>. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including <a href="primary_consumers" title="wikilink">primary consumers</a> (strict herbivores), <a href="Trophic_dynamics" title="wikilink">secondary consumers</a> (<a class="uri" href="carnivorous" title="wikilink">carnivorous</a> predators that feed exclusively on herbivores) and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores they are relatively inefficient at grazing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p>Trophic levels are part of the <a class="uri" href="holistic" title="wikilink">holistic</a> or <a href="complex_systems" title="wikilink">complex systems</a> view of ecosystems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems.

<h4 id="keystone-species">Keystone species</h4>

<p> A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the <a class="uri" href="food-web" title="wikilink">food-web</a>. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Sea_otter" title="wikilink">Sea otters</a> (<em>Enhydra lutris</em>) are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species because they limit the density of <a href="sea_urchins" title="wikilink">sea urchins</a> that feed on <a class="uri" href="kelp" title="wikilink">kelp</a>. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear and this has a dramatic effect on community structure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have indirectly led to the extinction of the <a href="Steller's_Sea_Cow" title="wikilink">Steller's Sea Cow</a> (<em>Hydrodamalis gigas</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a <a href="Conservation_biology" title="wikilink">conservation</a> tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ecological-complexity">Ecological complexity</h2>

<p>Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This <a class="uri" href="biocomplexity" title="wikilink">biocomplexity</a> stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or <a class="uri" href="ecotones" title="wikilink">ecotones</a> spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. "What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="holism">Holism</h3>

<p>Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies. Holism addresses the <a href="Biological_organisation" title="wikilink">biological organization</a> of life that <a href="Systems_biology" title="wikilink">self-organizes</a> into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to nonreducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an <a class="uri" href="ecosystem" title="wikilink">ecosystem</a>, cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn125" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> "New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to <a class="uri" href="reductionistic" title="wikilink">reductionistic</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a <a href="metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysical</a> hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from <a class="uri" href="mysticism" title="wikilink">mysticism</a> that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species.

<h3 id="coevolution">Coevolution</h3>

<p> Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a <a href="host_(biology)" title="wikilink">host</a> and an associate relationship.

Examples of mutualism include <a href="fungus-growing_ants" title="wikilink">fungus-growing ants</a> employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the <a href="fig_wasp" title="wikilink">fig wasp</a> and <a href="yucca_moth" title="wikilink">yucca moth</a> pollination complex, <a href="lichen" title="wikilink">lichens</a> with fungi and photosynthetic <a class="uri" href="algae" title="wikilink">algae</a>, and <a href="coral" title="wikilink">corals</a> with photosynthetic algae.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn168" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called <a class="uri" href="symbiosis" title="wikilink">symbiosis</a>. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with <a href="arbuscular_mycorrhizal_fungi" title="wikilink">arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi</a> living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for <a href="nutrients" title="wikilink">mineral nutrients</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

<p>Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called <a class="uri" href="commensalism" title="wikilink">commensalism</a> because many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called <a class="uri" href="parasitism" title="wikilink">parasitism</a>. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or <a href="propagule" title="wikilink">propagules</a>, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a> Coevolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space.

<h3 id="biogeography">Biogeography</h3>

<p>Biogeography (an amalgamation of <em>biology</em> and <em>geography</em>) is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> The <em><a href="Journal_of_Biogeography" title="wikilink">Journal of Biogeography</a></em> was established in 1974.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a> Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, <a href="Island_biogeography" title="wikilink">the theory of island biogeography</a>, published by the mathematician Robert MacArthur and ecologist <a href="Edward_O._Wilson" title="wikilink">Edward O.

<p>Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as <a href="Animal_migration" title="wikilink">migration</a> and <a href="Biological_dispersal" title="wikilink">dispersal</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called <a href="Allopatric_speciation" title="wikilink">vicariance biogeography</a> and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes.

<h4 id="rk-selection-theory">r/K-Selection theory</h4>

<p>A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory, one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain <a href="Life_history_theory" title="wikilink">life-history evolution</a>. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to <a href="population_densities" title="wikilink">population density</a>. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available <a href="Resource_(biology)" title="wikilink">resources</a> for rapid population growth. These early phases of <a href="population_growth" title="wikilink">population growth</a> experience <em>density-independent</em> forces of natural selection, which is called <em>r</em>-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called <em>K</em>-selection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<p>In the <em>r/K</em>-selection model, the first variable <em>r</em> is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable <em>K</em> is the carrying capacity of a population.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An <em>r</em>-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of <a class="uri" href="fecundity" title="wikilink">fecundity</a> in <em>r</em>-selected species. Many kinds of insects and <a href="invasive_species" title="wikilink">invasive species</a> exhibit <em>r</em>-selected <a href="Phenotypic_trait" title="wikilink">characteristics</a>. In contrast, a <em>K</em>-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting <em>K</em>-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a></p>

<p>The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the <a href="Polymerase_chain_reaction" title="wikilink">polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</a>. The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication <em><a href="Molecular_Ecology" title="wikilink">Molecular Ecology</a></em> in 1992.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a> <a href="Molecular_ecology" title="wikilink">Molecular ecology</a> uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context.

<h2 id="relation-to-the-environment">Relation to the environment</h2>

<p>The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains <a href="Resource_(biology)" title="wikilink">resources</a> for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn210" id="fnref210"><sup>210</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn211" id="fnref211"><sup>211</sup></a> Like "ecology," the term "environment" has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of "nature."

<p>The distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of <a class="uri" href="thermodynamics" title="wikilink">thermodynamics</a>, for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated <a href="materialism" title="wikilink">material</a> parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes, however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or <em>holocoenotic</em> system as it was once called.

<p>The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature.

Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of <a href="solar_radiation" title="wikilink">solar radiation</a>. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a> greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of <a class="uri" href="biodiversity" title="wikilink">biodiversity</a> and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. <a class="uri" href="Poikilotherms" title="wikilink">Poikilotherms</a>, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment.

<p>Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air.

<h4 id="soils">Soils</h4>

<p>Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet.

The <a class="uri" href="decomposition" title="wikilink">decomposition</a> of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing <a class="uri" href="minerals" title="wikilink">minerals</a> and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the <a class="uri" href="pedosphere" title="wikilink">pedosphere</a> where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain.

As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called <a class="uri" href="bioturbation" title="wikilink">bioturbation</a>. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil <a class="uri" href="microorganisms" title="wikilink">microorganisms</a> are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem.

<p>The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry.

Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of <a class="uri" href="permafrost" title="wikilink">permafrost</a> are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions.

He and his student <a class="uri" href="Theophrastus" title="wikilink">Theophrastus</a> made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations, biogeography, physiology, and on their behaviour, giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn295" id="fnref295"><sup>295</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn296" id="fnref296"><sup>296</sup></a></p>

<p>Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developed in the 1700s, through the published works of microscopist <a href="Antoni_van_Leeuwenhoek" title="wikilink">Antoni van Leeuwenhoek</a> (1632–1723) and botanist <a href="Richard_Bradley_(botanist)" title="wikilink">Richard Bradley</a> (1688?–1732).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn297" id="fnref297"><sup>297</sup></a> Biogeographer <a href="Alexander_von_Humboldt" title="wikilink">Alexander von Humboldt</a> (1769–1859) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients, where species are replaced or altered in form along <a href="environmental_gradient" title="wikilink">environmental gradients</a>, such as a <a href="cline_(biology)" title="wikilink">cline</a> forming along a rise in elevation. Humboldt drew inspiration from <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> as he developed a form of "terrestrial physics." In Newtonian fashion, he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species-to-area relationships.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn298" id="fnref298"><sup>298</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn299" id="fnref299"><sup>299</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn300" id="fnref300"><sup>300</sup></a> Natural historians, such as Humboldt, <a href="James_Hutton" title="wikilink">James Hutton</a> and <a href="Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" title="wikilink">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> (among others) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn301" id="fnref301"><sup>301</sup></a> The term "ecology" () is of a more recent origin and was first coined by the German biologist <a href="Ernst_Haeckel" title="wikilink">Ernst Haeckel</a> in his book <em>Generelle Morphologie der Organismen</em> (1866).

<p>From Aristotle until Darwin, the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging. Prior to <em>The Origin of Species</em>, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn313" id="fnref313"><sup>313</sup></a> An exception is the 1789 publication <em>Natural History of Selborne</em> by <a href="Gilbert_White" title="wikilink">Gilbert White</a> (1720–1793), considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn314" id="fnref314"><sup>314</sup></a> While <a href="Charles_Darwin" title="wikilink">Charles Darwin</a> is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn315" id="fnref315"><sup>315</sup></a> he was one of the founders of <a href="soil_ecology" title="wikilink">soil ecology</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn316" id="fnref316"><sup>316</sup></a> and he made note of the first ecological experiment in <em>The Origin of Species</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn317" id="fnref317"><sup>317</sup></a> Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn318" id="fnref318"><sup>318</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="since-1900">Since 1900</h3>

<p>Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century (around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest). Notable scientist <a href="Ellen_Swallow_Richards" title="wikilink">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> may have first introduced the term "<a class="uri" href="oekology" title="wikilink">oekology</a>" (which eventually morphed into <a href="home_economics" title="wikilink">home economics</a>) in the U.S. as early 1892.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn319" id="fnref319"><sup>319</sup></a></p>

<p>In the early 20th century, ecology transitioned from a more <a href="metaphysics" title="wikilink">descriptive form</a> of <a href="natural_history" title="wikilink">natural history</a> to a more <a href="scientific_method" title="wikilink">analytical form</a> of <em>scientific natural history</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn320" id="fnref320"><sup>320</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn321" id="fnref321"><sup>321</sup></a> <a href="Frederic_Clements" title="wikilink">Frederic Clements</a> published the first American ecology book in 1905,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn322" id="fnref322"><sup>322</sup></a> presenting the idea of plant communities as a <a class="uri" href="superorganism" title="wikilink">superorganism</a>. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of <a href="seral_development" title="wikilink">seral development</a> that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by <a href="Henry_Gleason" title="wikilink">Henry Gleason</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn323" id="fnref323"><sup>323</sup></a> who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn324" id="fnref324"><sup>324</sup></a></p>

<p>The Clementsian superorganism theory was an overextended application of an <a href="idealism" title="wikilink">idealistic form</a> of holism.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn325" id="fnref325"><sup>325</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn326" id="fnref326"><sup>326</sup></a> The term "holism" was coined in 1926 by <a href="Jan_Christiaan_Smuts" title="wikilink">Jan Christiaan Smuts</a>, a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements' superorganism concept.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn327" id="fnref327"><sup>327</sup></a> Around the same time, <a href="Charles_Sutherland_Elton" title="wikilink">Charles Elton</a> pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book <em>Animal Ecology</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn328" id="fnref328"><sup>328</sup></a> Elton<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn329" id="fnref329"><sup>329</sup></a> defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains, food cycles, and food size, and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance. Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn330" id="fnref330"><sup>330</sup></a> <a href="Alfred_J._Lotka" title="wikilink">Alfred J. Lotka</a> brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology.</p>

<p>In 1942, <a href="Raymond_Lindeman" title="wikilink">Raymond Lindeman</a> wrote a landmark paper on the <a href="Trophic_dynamics#Trophic_dynamics" title="wikilink">trophic dynamics</a> of ecology, which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis. Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems. <a href="Robert_E._MacArthur" title="wikilink">Robert E. MacArthur</a> advanced mathematical theory, predictions and tests in ecology in the 1950s, which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn331" id="fnref331"><sup>331</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn332" id="fnref332"><sup>332</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn333" id="fnref333"><sup>333</sup></a> Ecology also has developed through contributions from other nations, including Russia's <a href="Vladimir_Vernadsky" title="wikilink">Vladimir Vernadsky</a> and his founding of the biosphere concept in the 1920s<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn334" id="fnref334"><sup>334</sup></a> and Japan's <a href="Kinji_Imanishi" title="wikilink">Kinji Imanishi</a> and his concepts of harmony in nature and habitat segregation in the 1950s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn335" id="fnref335"><sup>335</sup></a> Scientific recognition of contributions to ecology from non-English-speaking cultures is hampered by language and translation barriers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn336" id="fnref336"><sup>336</sup></a></p>

<p>Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960–1970s <a href="environmental_movement" title="wikilink">environmental movement</a>. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn337" id="fnref337"><sup>337</sup></a> The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by notable ecologists in the history of <a href="conservation_biology" title="wikilink">conservation biology</a>, such as <a href="Aldo_Leopold" title="wikilink">Aldo Leopold</a> and <a href="Arthur_Tansley" title="wikilink">Arthur Tansley</a>, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn338" id="fnref338"><sup>338</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn339" id="fnref339"><sup>339</sup></a> Palamar (2008)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn340" id="fnref340"><sup>340</sup></a> notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called <a class="uri" href="euthenics" title="wikilink">euthenics</a>)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn341" id="fnref341"><sup>341</sup></a> and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as <a href="Ellen_Swallow_Richards" title="wikilink">Ellen Swallow Richards</a> and <a href="Julia_Lathrop" title="wikilink">Julia Lathrop</a>, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.</p>

<p>In 1962, marine biologist and ecologist <a href="Rachel_Carson" title="wikilink">Rachel Carson</a>'s book <em><a href="Silent_Spring" title="wikilink">Silent Spring</a></em> helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic <a class="uri" href="pesticides" title="wikilink">pesticides</a>, such as <a class="uri" href="DDT" title="wikilink">DDT</a>, <a href="Bioaccumulation" title="wikilink">bioaccumulating</a> in the environment.

Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge their understanding of the degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn342" id="fnref342"><sup>342</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn343" id="fnref343"><sup>343</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn344" id="fnref344"><sup>344</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn345" id="fnref345"><sup>345</sup></a></p>
