<p>A <strong>hybrid rocket</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="rocket" title="wikilink">rocket</a> with a <a href="rocket_motor" title="wikilink">rocket motor</a> which uses <a href="rocket_propellants" title="wikilink">rocket propellants</a> in two different phases. - <a href="solid_rocket_propellant" title="wikilink">one solid</a> and the other either gas or <a href="liquid_rocket_propellant" title="wikilink">liquid</a>. The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back at least 75 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Hybrid rockets exhibit advantages over both <a href="Liquid-fuel_rocket" title="wikilink">liquid rockets</a> and <a href="solid_rocket" title="wikilink">solid rockets</a> especially in terms of simplicity, safety, and cost.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Because it is nearly impossible for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids. Like liquid rocket motors, but unlike solid rocket motors, hybrid rocket motors can be shut down easily and the thrust can be controlled with a simple throttle.

</figure>

<p>In its simplest form a hybrid rocket consists of a <a href="pressure_vessel" title="wikilink">pressure vessel</a> (tank) containing the liquid <a href="rocket_propellant" title="wikilink">propellant</a>, the <a href="combustion_chamber" title="wikilink">combustion chamber</a> containing the solid <a href="rocket_propellant" title="wikilink">propellant</a>, and a valve isolating the two. When thrust is desired, a suitable ignition source is introduced in the combustion chamber and the valve is opened. The liquid propellant (or gas) flows into the combustion chamber where it is vaporized and then reacted with the solid propellant. <a class="uri" href="Combustion" title="wikilink">Combustion</a> occurs in a <a href="boundary_layer" title="wikilink">boundary layer</a> <a href="diffusion_flame" title="wikilink">diffusion flame</a> adjacent to the surface of the solid propellant.</p>

<p>Generally the liquid propellant is the <a class="uri" href="oxidizer" title="wikilink">oxidizer</a> and the solid propellant is the <a class="uri" href="fuel" title="wikilink">fuel</a> because solid oxidizers are <a href="Ammonium_Perchlorate_Composite_Propellant#Environmental_and_other_concerns" title="wikilink">problematic</a> and <a href="rocket_propellant#Advantages_2" title="wikilink">lower performing</a> than liquid oxidizers. Furthermore, using a solid fuel such as <a href="Hydroxyl-terminated_polybutadiene" title="wikilink">Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene</a> (HTPB) or <a href="paraffin_wax" title="wikilink">paraffin wax</a> allows for the incorporation of high-energy fuel additives such as <a class="uri" href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminium</a>, <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a>, or <a href="metal_hydrides" title="wikilink">metal hydrides</a>.</p>

<p>Common oxidizers include gaseous or liquid <a class="uri" href="oxygen" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> or <a href="nitrous_oxide" title="wikilink">nitrous oxide</a>. Common fuels include <a class="uri" href="polymers" title="wikilink">polymers</a> such as <a class="uri" href="polyethylene" title="wikilink">polyethylene</a>, <a href="cross-link" title="wikilink">cross-linked</a> <a href="rubbers" title="wikilink">rubber</a> such as HTPB or liquefying fuels such as <a href="paraffin_wax" title="wikilink">paraffin wax</a>.</p>

<p>Hybrid rocket motors exhibit some obvious as well as some subtle advantages over <a href="liquid-fuel_rocket" title="wikilink">liquid-fuel rockets</a> and <a href="solid-fuel_rocket" title="wikilink">solid-fuel rockets</a>. A brief summary of some of these is given below:</p>

<li>Mechanically simpler - requires only a single liquid propellant resulting in less plumbing, fewer valves, and simpler operations.</li>
<li>Denser fuels - fuels in the solid <a href="phase_(matter)" title="wikilink">phase</a> generally have higher density than those in the liquid phase, reducing overall system volume.</li>

)</a>, density specific impulse, or both.</li>
<li>Combustion instabilities - Hybrid rockets do not typically exhibit high frequency combustion instabilities that plague liquid rockets.</li>
<li>Propellant pressurization - One of the most difficult to design portions of a liquid rocket system are the <a class="uri" href="turbopumps" title="wikilink">turbopumps</a>. Turbopumps design is complex as it has to precisely and efficiently pump and keep separated two fluids of different properties in precise ratios at very high volumetric flow rates, often cryogenic temperatures, and highly volatile chemicals while combusting those same fluids in order to power itself. Hybrids have far less fluid to move and can often be pressurized by either blow-down or pressurized feed systems which would be prohibitively heavy in a liquid rocket.</li>
<li>Cooling - Liquid rockets often depend on one of the propellants, typically the fuel, to cool the combustion chamber, <a class="uri" href="nozzle" title="wikilink">nozzle</a>, and bell due to the very high heat fluxes and vulnerability of the metal walls to oxidation and stress cracking. Hybrid rockets have combustion chamber that are lined with the solid propellant which shields it from the product gases. Their nozzles and bells are often graphite or coated in ablative materials similarly to solid rockets. The design, construction, and testing of liquid cooling flows is complex and the system is prone to failure.</li>

<li>Less explosion hazard - Propellant grain more tolerant of processing errors such as cracks. Propellant grain cannot be ignited by stray electrical charge.</li>
<li>Fewer handling and storage issues - Ingredients in solid rockets are often incompatible chemically and thermally. Repeated changes in temperature can cause distortion of the grain. Antioxidants and coatings are used to keep the grain from breaking down or decomposing.</li>
<li>More controllable - Stop/restart and <a href="Rocket_engine#Throttling" title="wikilink">throttling</a> are all easily incorporated into most designs. Solid rockets rarely can be shut down easily and almost never have throttling or restart capabilities.</li>
<li>Can be transported to site in a benign form and loaded with oxidizer remotely immediately before launch, improving safety.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-of-hybrid-rockets">Disadvantages of hybrid rockets</h3>

<p>Hybrid rockets also exhibit some disadvantages when compared with liquid and solid rockets. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxidizer-to-fuel ratio shift ("O/F shift") - with a constant oxidizer flow-rate, the ratio of fuel production rate to oxidizer flow rate will change as a grain regresses. This leads to off-peak operation from a chemical performance point of view.</li>
<li>Low regression-rate (rate at which the solid phase recedes) fuels often drive multi-port fuel grains. Multi-port fuel grains have poor volumetric efficiency and, often, structural deficiencies. High regression-rate liquefying fuels developed in the late 1990s offer a potential solution to this problem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>Compared with liquid-based propulsion, re-fuelling a partially or totally depleted hybrid rocket would present significant challenges, as the solid propellant cannot simply be pumped into a fuel tank. This may or may not be an issue, depending upon how the rocket is planned to be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a well-designed hybrid, O/F shift has a very small impact on performance because

 is insensitive to O/F shift near the peak.</p>

<p>In general, much less development work has been performed with hybrids than liquids or solids and it is likely that some of these disadvantages could be rectified through further investment in <a href="research_and_development" title="wikilink">research and development</a>.</p>

<p>One problem in designing large hybrid orbital rockets is that turbopumps become necessary to achieve high flow rates and pressurization of the oxidizer. This turbopump must be powered by something. In a traditional liquid-propellant rocket, the turbopump uses the same fuel and oxidizer as the rocket, since they are both liquid and can be fed to the pre-burner. But in a hybrid, the fuel is solid and cannot be fed to a turbopump's engine. Some hybrids use an oxidizer that can also be used as a <a class="uri" href="monopropellant" title="wikilink">monopropellant</a>, such as <a class="uri" href="nitromethane" title="wikilink">nitromethane</a> or <a href="hydrogen_peroxide" title="wikilink">hydrogen peroxide</a>, and so a turbopump can run on it alone. But nitromethane and hydrogen peroxide are significantly less efficient than liquid oxygen, which cannot be used alone to run a turbopump. Another fuel would be needed, requiring its own tank and decreasing rocket performance.</p>
<h2 id="hybrid-safety">Hybrid safety</h2>

<p>Generally, well designed and carefully constructed hybrids are very safe. The primary hazards associated with hybrids are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pressure vessel failures</strong> - Chamber insulation failure may allow hot combustion gases near the chamber walls leading to a "burn-through" in which the vessel ruptures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blow back</strong> - For oxidizers that decompose exothermically such as nitrous oxide or <a href="hydrogen_peroxide" title="wikilink">hydrogen peroxide</a>, flame or hot gasses from the combustion chamber can propagate back through the injector, igniting the oxidizer and leading to a tank explosion. Blow-back requires gases to flow back through the injector due to insufficient pressure drop which can occur during periods of unstable combustion. Blow back is inherent to specific oxidizers and is not possible with oxidizers such as <a class="uri" href="oxygen" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> or <a href="nitrogen_tetroxide" title="wikilink">nitrogen tetroxide</a> unless fuel is present in the oxidizer tank.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard starts</strong> - An excess of oxidizer in the combustion chamber prior to ignition, particularly for monopropellants such as nitrous oxide, can result in a temporary over-pressure or "spike" at ignition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the fuel in a hybrid does not contain an oxidizer, it will not combust explosively on its own. For this reason, hybrids are classified as having no <a href="TNT_equivalent" title="wikilink">TNT equivalent</a> explosive power. In contrast, <a href="solid_rocket" title="wikilink">solid rockets</a> often have TNT equivalencies similar in magnitude to the mass of the propellant grain. <a href="Liquid-fuel_rocket" title="wikilink">Liquid-fuel rockets</a> typically have TNT equivalencies calculated based on the amount of fuel and oxidizer which could realistically intimately combine before igniting explosively; this is often taken to be 10–20% of the total propellant mass. For hybrids, even filling the combustion chamber with oxidizer prior to ignition will not generally create an explosion with the solid fuel, the explosive equivalence is often quoted as 0%.</p>

<p>In 1998 <a class="uri" href="SpaceDev" title="wikilink">SpaceDev</a> acquired all of the intellectual property, designs, and test results generated by over 200 hybrid rocket motor firings by the <a href="American_Rocket_Company" title="wikilink">American Rocket Company</a> over its eight-year life. <a class="uri" href="SpaceShipOne" title="wikilink">SpaceShipOne</a>, the first private manned spacecraft, was powered by SpaceDev's hybrid rocket motor burning HTPB with nitrous oxide. However, nitrous oxide was the prime substance responsible for the explosion that killed three in the development of the successor of SpaceShipOne at <a href="Scaled_Composites" title="wikilink">Scaled Composites</a> in 2007.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <a href="Virgin_Galactic" title="wikilink">Virgin Galactic</a> <a class="uri" href="SpaceShipTwo" title="wikilink">SpaceShipTwo</a> follow-on commercial suborbital spaceplane uses a scaled-up hybrid motor.</p>

<p>SpaceDev was developing the <a href="SpaceDev_Streaker" title="wikilink">SpaceDev Streaker</a>, an expendable small launch vehicle, and <a href="SpaceDev_Dream_Chaser" title="wikilink">SpaceDev Dream Chaser</a>, capable of both suborbital and orbital human space flight. Both Streaker and Dream Chaser use hybrid rocket motors that burn nitrous oxide and the synthetic rubber HTPB. SpaceDev was acquired by <a href="Sierra_Nevada_Corporation" title="wikilink">Sierra Nevada Corporation</a> in 2009, becoming its Space Systems division, which continues to develop Dream Chaser for NASA's <a href="Commercial_Crew_Development" title="wikilink">Commercial Crew Development</a> contract. Sierra Nevada also developed <a class="uri" href="RocketMotorTwo" title="wikilink">RocketMotorTwo</a>, the hybrid engine for <a class="uri" href="SpaceShipTwo" title="wikilink">SpaceShipTwo</a>. On October 31, 2014 <a class="uri" href="SpaceShipTwo" title="wikilink">SpaceShipTwo</a> was lost, initial speculation had suggested that its hybrid engine had in fact exploded and killed one test pilot and seriously injured the other. However investigation data now indicates an early deployment of the SpaceShip-Two feather system was the cause for aerodynamic breakup of the vehicle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>U.S. Rockets <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> manufactures and deploys hybrids using self-pressurizing nitrous oxide N<sub>2</sub>O and HTPB as well as HTP and HTPB. The High Test Hydrogen Peroxide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 86% and Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and aluminum hybrids developed by U.S. Rockets produce a sea level delivered specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>) of 240, well above the typical 180 of N<sub>2</sub>O-HTPB hybrids. In addition to that, they are self-starting, restartable, have considerably lower combustion instability making them suitable for fragile or manned missions such as Bloodhound SSC, SpaceShip Two or SpaceShip Three. The company has successfully tested<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and deployed both pressure fed and pump fed versions of the latter HTP-HTPB style. Deliverables to date have ranged from 6 inch to 18 inch diameter, and development units up to 54 inch diameter. The vendor claims scalability to over 5 meters diameter with regression rates approaching solids, according to literature distributed at the November 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency meeting for XS-1.</p>

Both teams employed nitrous oxide/HTPB propellant system with different improvement schemes. One team (NCKU) added 50 percent of paraffin in the solid grain for boosting the regression rates. The other team (<a href="Advanced_Rocket_Research_Center" title="wikilink">ARRC</a>/NCTU) incorporated innovative mixing enhancement devices to push the overall combustion efficiency towards the theoretical value. This team takes full advantage of high-fidelity simulations and experimental works for very cost-effective developments. Several hybrid rockets have been successfully launched so far, reaching altitudes of 10~20 km. Their plans include attempting 100~200 km altitude launch to test nanosatellites by the end of 2014, and developing orbital launch capabilities for nanosatellites in the long run. A sub-scale N2O/PE Dual-Vortical-Flow (DVF) hybrid engine hot-fire test in 2014 has delivered an averaged sea-level Isp of 280 sec, which indicates that the system has reached around 97% combustion efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In 1953 Pacific Rocket Society (est. 1943) was developing the XDF-23, a 4" x 72" hybrid rocket, designed by Jim Nuding, using LOX and rubber polyall called "Thiokol". They had already tried other fuels in prior iterations including cotton, <a href="paraffin_wax" title="wikilink">paraffin wax</a> and wood. The XDF name itself comes from eXperimental Douglas Fir from one of the first units.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Korey Kline of Environmental Aeroscience Corporation (eAc) first fired a gaseous oxygen and rubber hybrid in 1982 at Lucerne Dry Lake, CA, after discussions on the technology with Bill Wood, formerly with Westinghouse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The first SpaceShipOne hybrid tests were successfully conducted by Kline and eAc at Mojave, CA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="American_Rocket_Company" title="wikilink">American Rocket Company</a> fired the first very large hybrids and tailored N<sub>2</sub>O and HTPB hybrids to government uses with limited adoption due to combustion instability and low I<sub>sp</sub>.</p>
<h2 id="in-popular-culture">In popular culture</h2>

<p>An October 26, 2005 episode of the Television show <em><a class="uri" href="MythBusters" title="wikilink">MythBusters</a></em> entitled "<a href='MythBusters_(2005_season)#Episode_40_–_"Confederate_Rocket"' title="wikilink">Confederate Rocket</a>" featured a hybrid rocket motor using liquid nitrous oxide and <a href="paraffin_wax" title="wikilink">paraffin wax</a>. The myth purported that during the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, the <a href="Confederate_States_Army" title="wikilink">Confederate Army</a> was able to construct a rocket of this type. The myth was revisited in a later episode entitled <em><a href="MythBusters_(2006_season)#Salami_Rocket" title="wikilink">Salami Rocket</a></em>, using hollowed out dry <a class="uri" href="salami" title="wikilink">salami</a> as the solid fuel.</p>

<p>In the February 18, 2007 episode of <a href="Top_Gear_(current_format)" title="wikilink">Top Gear</a>, a <a href="Reliant_Robin" title="wikilink">Reliant Robin</a> was used by <a href="Richard_Hammond" title="wikilink">Richard Hammond</a> and <a href="James_May" title="wikilink">James May</a> in an attempt to modify a normal K-reg Robin into a reusable <a href="space_shuttle" title="wikilink">space shuttle</a>. Steve Holland, a professional <a href="radio-controlled_aircraft" title="wikilink">radio-controlled aircraft</a> pilot, helped Hammond to work out how to land a Robin safely. The craft was built by Senior members of the <a href="United_Kingdom_Rocketry_Association" title="wikilink">United Kingdom Rocketry Association</a> (UKRA) and achieved a successful launch, flew for several seconds into the air and managed to successfully jettison the solid-fuel rocket boosters on time. This was the largest rocket launched by a non-government organisation in Europe. It used 6 x 40960 NS O Contrail Rockets motors giving a maximum thrust of 8 metric tons. However, the car failed to separate from the large external fuel tank due to faulty explosive bolts between the Robin and the external tank and the Robin subsequently crashed into the ground and <em>seemed</em> to have exploded soon after. In fact this explosion was added for dramatic effect as neither Reliant Robins nor hybrid rocket motors explode in the way depicted.</p>
