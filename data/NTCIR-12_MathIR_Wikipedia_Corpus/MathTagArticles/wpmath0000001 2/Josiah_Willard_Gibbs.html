<h1>Josiah Willard Gibbs</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Josiah Willard Gibbs</strong> (February 11, 1839 – April 28, 1903) was an American scientist who made important theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of <a class="uri" href="thermodynamics" title="wikilink">thermodynamics</a> was instrumental in transforming <a href="physical_chemistry" title="wikilink">physical chemistry</a> into a rigorous deductive science. Together with <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a> and <a href="Ludwig_Boltzmann" title="wikilink">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>, he created <a href="statistical_mechanics" title="wikilink">statistical mechanics</a> (a term that he coined), explaining the <a href="laws_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">laws of thermodynamics</a> as consequences of the statistical properties of large <a href="Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics)" title="wikilink">ensembles</a> of particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> to problems in <a href="physical_optics" title="wikilink">physical optics</a>. As a mathematician, he invented modern <a href="vector_calculus" title="wikilink">vector calculus</a> (independently of the British scientist <a href="Oliver_Heaviside" title="wikilink">Oliver Heaviside</a>, who carried out similar work during the same period).</p>

<p>In 1863, <a href="Yale_University" title="wikilink">Yale</a> awarded Gibbs the first American <a href="Doctor_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">doctorate</a> in <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was professor of <a href="mathematical_physics" title="wikilink">mathematical physics</a> from 1871 until his death. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> as "the greatest mind in American history".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1901 Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the <a href="Copley_Medal" title="wikilink">Copley Medal</a> of the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> of London,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> "for his contributions to mathematical physics".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Commentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's quiet, solitary life in turn of the century <a href="New_England" title="wikilink">New England</a> and the great international impact of his ideas. Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to <a href="Robert_Andrews_Millikan" title="wikilink">Robert A. Millikan</a>, in pure science Gibbs "did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what <a href="Pierre-Simon_Laplace" title="wikilink">Laplace</a> did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="family-background">Family background</h3>

<p>Gibbs belonged to an old <a class="uri" href="Yankee" title="wikilink">Yankee</a> family that had produced distinguished American clergymen and academics since the 17th century. He was the fourth of five children and the only son of <a href="Josiah_Willard_Gibbs,_Sr." title="wikilink">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a> and his wife Mary Anna, <em>née</em> Van Cleve. On his father's side, he was descended from <a href="Samuel_Willard" title="wikilink">Samuel Willard</a>, who served as acting <a href="President_of_Harvard_University" title="wikilink">President of Harvard College</a> from 1701 to 1707. On his mother's side, one of his ancestors was the Rev. <a href="Jonathan_Dickinson_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Jonathan Dickinson</a>, the first president of the College of New Jersey (later <a href="Princeton_University" title="wikilink">Princeton University</a>). Gibbs's given name, which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family, derived from his ancestor Josiah Willard, who had been Secretary of the <a href="Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay" title="wikilink">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> in the 18th century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>  The elder Gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as "Josiah", while the son was called "Willard".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Josiah Gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at <a href="Yale_Divinity_School" title="wikilink">Yale Divinity School</a> from 1824 until his death in 1861. He is chiefly remembered today as the <a href="Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">abolitionist</a> who found an interpreter for the African passengers of the ship <em><a href="La_Amistad" title="wikilink">Amistad</a></em>, allowing them to testify during <a href="United_States_v._The_Amistad" title="wikilink">the trial</a> that followed their rebellion against being sold as slaves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>

<p> Willard Gibbs was educated at the <a href="Hopkins_School" title="wikilink">Hopkins School</a> and entered <a href="Yale_College" title="wikilink">Yale College</a> in 1854, aged 15. He graduated in 1858 near the top of his class, and was awarded prizes for excellence in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> and <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He remained at Yale as a graduate student at the <a href="Sheffield_Scientific_School" title="wikilink">Sheffield Scientific School</a>. At age 19, soon after his graduation from college, Gibbs was inducted into the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of the Yale faculty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Relatively few documents from the period survive and it is impossible to reconstruct the details of Gibbs's early career with precision.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs's principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician <a href="Hubert_Anson_Newton" title="wikilink">Hubert Anson Newton</a>, a leading authority on <a href="Meteoroid" title="wikilink">meteors</a>, who remained Gibbs's lifelong friend and confidant.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>Recurrent <a href="Lung" title="wikilink">pulmonary</a> trouble ailed the young Gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to <a class="uri" href="tuberculosis" title="wikilink">tuberculosis</a>, which had killed his mother.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He also suffered from <a href="Astigmatism_(eye)" title="wikilink">astigmatism</a>, whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to <a href="Ophthalmology" title="wikilink">oculists</a>, so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Though in later years he used <a class="uri" href="glasses" title="wikilink">glasses</a> only for reading or other close work,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Gibbs's delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> of 1861–65.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> He was not <a href="Conscription_in_the_United_States#Civil_War" title="wikilink">conscripted</a> and he remained at Yale for the duration of the war.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1863, Gibbs received the first <a href="Doctorate_of_Philosophy" title="wikilink">Doctorate of Philosophy</a> (Ph.D.) in engineering granted in the US, for a thesis entitled "On the Form of the Teeth of Wheels in Spur Gearing", in which he used geometrical techniques to investigate the optimum design for <a href="gear" title="wikilink">gears</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In 1861, Yale had become the first US university to offer a Ph.D. degree<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and Gibbs's was only the fifth Ph.D. granted in the US in any subject.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> After graduation, Gibbs was appointed as tutor at the College for a term of three years. During the first two years he taught Latin and during the third "natural philosophy" (i.e., physics).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1866 he patented a design for a <a href="railway_brake" title="wikilink">railway brake</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and read a paper before the Connecticut Academy, entitled "The Proper Magnitude of the Units of Length", in which he proposed a scheme for rationalizing the system of units of measurement used in mechanics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>After his term as tutor ended, Gibbs traveled to Europe with his sisters. They spent the winter of 1866–67 in Paris, where Gibbs attended lectures at the <a href="University_of_Paris" title="wikilink">Sorbonne</a> and the <a href="Collège_de_France" title="wikilink">Collège de France</a>, given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as <a href="Joseph_Liouville" title="wikilink">Joseph Liouville</a> and <a href="Michel_Chasles" title="wikilink">Michel Chasles</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Having undertaken a punishing regime of study, Gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor, fearing tuberculosis, advised him to rest on the <a href="French_Riviera" title="wikilink">Riviera</a>, where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Moving to <a class="uri" href="Berlin" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>, Gibbs attended the lectures taught by mathematicians <a href="Karl_Weierstrass" title="wikilink">Karl Weierstrass</a> and <a href="Leopold_Kronecker" title="wikilink">Leopold Kronecker</a>, as well as by chemist <a href="Heinrich_Gustav_Magnus" title="wikilink">Heinrich Gustav Magnus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> In August 1867, Gibbs's sister Julia was married in Berlin to Addison Van Name, who had been Gibbs's classmate at Yale. The newly married couple returned to New Haven, leaving Gibbs and his sister Anna in Germany.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> In <a href="Heidelberg_University" title="wikilink">Heidelberg</a>, Gibbs was exposed to the work of physicists <a href="Gustav_Kirchhoff" title="wikilink">Gustav Kirchhoff</a> and <a href="Hermann_von_Helmholtz" title="wikilink">Hermann von Helmholtz</a>, and chemist <a href="Robert_Bunsen" title="wikilink">Robert Bunsen</a>. At the time, German academics were the leading authorities in the natural sciences, especially chemistry and <a class="uri" href="thermodynamics" title="wikilink">thermodynamics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and briefly taught French to engineering students.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> It was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam-engine <a href="Governor_(device)" title="wikilink">governor</a>, his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In 1871 he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale, the first such professorship in the United States. Gibbs, who had independent means and had yet to publish anything, was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired without salary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Unsalaried teaching positions were common in German universities, on which the system of graduate scientific instruction at Yale was then being modeled.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs published his first work in 1873, at the unusually advanced age of 34.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His papers on the geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the <em>Transactions of the Connecticut Academy</em>. This journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, but he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a> at <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge</a>. Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct. He then produced three plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Maxwell included a chapter on Gibbs's work in the next edition of his <em>Theory of Heat</em>, published in 1875. He explained the usefulness of Gibbs's graphical methods in a lecture to the <a href="Chemical_Society" title="wikilink">Chemical Society</a> of London and even referred to it in the article on "Diagrams" that he wrote for the <em><a href="Encyclopædia_Britannica" title="wikilink">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell's early death in 1879, aged 48. The joke later circulated in New Haven that "only one man lived who could understand Gibbs's papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi-phase chemical systems (i.e., to systems composed of more than one kind of matter) and considered a variety of concrete applications. He described that research in a monograph titled "<a href="On_the_Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous_Substances" title="wikilink">On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances</a>", published by the Connecticut Academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878. That work, which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> begins with a quotation from <a href="Rudolf_Clausius" title="wikilink">Rudolf Clausius</a> that expresses what would later be called the first and second <a href="laws_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">laws of thermodynamics</a>: "The <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> of the world is constant. The <a class="uri" href="entropy" title="wikilink">entropy</a> of the world tends towards a maximum."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs's monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to the interpretation of physico-chemical phenomena, explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> The work has been described as "the <em><a href="Philosophiæ_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica" title="wikilink">Principia</a></em> of thermodynamics" and as a work of "practically unlimited scope".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <a href="Wilhelm_Ostwald" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>, who translated Gibbs's monograph into German, referred to Gibbs as the "founder of chemical energetics".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> According to modern commentators,</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Gibbs continued to work without pay until 1880, when the new <a href="Johns_Hopkins_University" title="wikilink">Johns Hopkins University</a> in <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore, Maryland</a> offered him a position paying $3,000 per year. In response, Yale offered him an annual salary of $2,000, which he was content to accept.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1880 to 1884, Gibbs worked on developing the <a href="exterior_algebra" title="wikilink">exterior algebra</a> of <a href="Hermann_Grassmann" title="wikilink">Hermann Grassmann</a> into a <a href="vector_calculus" title="wikilink">vector calculus</a> well-suited to the needs of physicists. With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the <a href="Dot_product" title="wikilink">dot</a> and <a href="cross_product" title="wikilink">cross products</a> of two vectors and introduced the concept of <a class="uri" href="dyadics" title="wikilink">dyadics</a>. Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer <a href="Oliver_Heaviside" title="wikilink">Oliver Heaviside</a>. Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the vectorial approach over the <a href="quaternion" title="wikilink">quaternionic</a> calculus of <a href="William_Rowan_Hamilton" title="wikilink">William Rowan Hamilton</a>, which was then widely used by British scientists. This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with <a href="Peter_Guthrie_Tait" title="wikilink">Peter Guthrie Tait</a> and others in the pages of <em><a href="Nature_(journal)" title="wikilink">Nature</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs's lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for the use of his students, and were later adapted by <a href="Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson" title="wikilink">Edwin Bidwell Wilson</a> into a textbook, <em><a href="Vector_Analysis" title="wikilink">Vector Analysis</a></em>, published in 1901.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> That book helped to popularize the "<a class="uri" href="del" title="wikilink">del</a>" notation that is widely used today in <a href="Classical_electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electrodynamics</a> and <a href="fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">fluid mechanics</a>. In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the "<a href="Gibbs_phenomenon" title="wikilink">Gibbs phenomenon</a>" in the theory of <a href="Fourier_series" title="wikilink">Fourier series</a> (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, <a href="Henry_Wilbraham" title="wikilink">Henry Wilbraham</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

</figure>

<p>From 1882 to 1889, Gibbs wrote five papers on <a href="physical_optics" title="wikilink">physical optics</a>, in which he investigated <a class="uri" href="birefringence" title="wikilink">birefringence</a> and other optical phenomena and defended Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light against the mechanical theories of <a href="William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin" title="wikilink">Lord Kelvin</a> and others.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> In his work on optics just as much as in his work on thermodynamics, Gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about the microscopic structure of matter,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> which proved a wise course in view of the revolutionary developments in <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a> that began around the time of his death.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs coined the term <em>statistical mechanics</em> and introduced key concepts in the corresponding mathematical description of physical systems, including the notions of <a href="chemical_potential" title="wikilink">chemical potential</a> (1876), <a href="Statistical_ensemble_(mathematical_physics)" title="wikilink">statistical ensemble</a> (1878), and <a href="phase_space" title="wikilink">phase space</a> (1902).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Gibbs's derivation of the phenomenological laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems with many particles was presented in his highly-influential textbook <em>Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics</em>, published in 1902, a year before his death.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs's retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students. His principal protégé was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that "except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, toward the end of the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his home—a little exercise between work and dinner—and one might occasionally come across him at that time."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by <a href="Irving_Fisher" title="wikilink">Irving Fisher</a> in 1891.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his <em>Collected Works</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Another distinguished student was <a href="Lee_De_Forest" title="wikilink">Lee De Forest</a>, later a pioneer of radio technology.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs died in New Haven on April 28, 1903, at the age of 64, victim of an acute intestinal obstruction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> A funeral was conducted two days later at his home on 121 High Street<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> and his body was buried in the nearby <a href="Grove_Street_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Grove Street Cemetery</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> In May, Yale organized a memorial meeting at the Sloane Laboratory.

<p>Gibbs never married, living all his life in his childhood home with his sister Julia and her husband Addison Van Name, who was the Yale librarian. Except for his customary summer vacations in the <a href="Adirondack_Mountains" title="wikilink">Adirondacks</a> (at <a href="Keene_Valley,_New_York" title="wikilink">Keene Valley, New York</a>) and later at the <a href="White_Mountains_(New_Hampshire)" title="wikilink">White Mountains</a> (in <a href="Intervale,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Intervale, New Hampshire</a>),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> his sojourn in Europe in 1866–69 was almost the only time that Gibbs spent outside New Haven.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> He joined Yale's College Church (a <a href="Congregational_church" title="wikilink">Congregational church</a>) at the end of his freshman year<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> and remained a regular attendant for the rest of his life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Gibbs generally voted for the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> candidate in presidential elections but, like other "<a href="Mugwump" title="wikilink">Mugwumps</a>", his concern over the growing corruption associated with <a href="Political_machine" title="wikilink">machine politics</a> led him to support <a href="Grover_Cleveland" title="wikilink">Grover Cleveland</a>, a conservative <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democrat</a>, in the <a href="United_States_presidential_election,_1884" title="wikilink">election of 1884</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Little else is known of his religious or political views, which he mostly kept to himself.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Beyond the technical writings concerning his research, he published only two other pieces: a brief obituary for Rudolf Clausius, one of the founders of the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, and a longer biographical memoir of his mentor at Yale, H.

<h3 id="statistical-mechanics">Statistical mechanics</h3>

<p>Together with James Clerk Maxwell and <a href="Ludwig_Boltzmann" title="wikilink">Ludwig Boltzmann</a>, Gibbs founded "statistical mechanics", a term that he coined to identify the branch of theoretical physics that accounts for the observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of the statistics of large ensembles of particles. He introduced the concept of <a href="phase_space" title="wikilink">phase space</a> and used it to define the <a href="microcanonical_ensemble" title="wikilink">microcanonical</a>, <a href="canonical_ensemble" title="wikilink">canonical</a>, and <a href="grand_canonical_ensemble" title="wikilink">grand canonical ensembles</a>, thus obtaining a more general formulation of the statistical properties of many-particle systems than Maxwell and Boltzmann had achieved before him.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>According to <a href="Henri_Poincaré" title="wikilink">Henri Poincaré</a>, writing in 1904, even though Maxwell and Boltzmann had previously explained the <a href="Irreversible_process" title="wikilink">irreversibility</a> of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms, "the one who has seen it most clearly, in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read, is Gibbs, in his <em>Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics</em>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Gibbs's analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann's <a class="uri" href="H-theorem" title="wikilink">H-theorem</a> and of the <a href="ergodic_hypothesis" title="wikilink">ergodic hypothesis</a>, were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs was well aware that the application of the <a href="equipartition_theorem" title="wikilink">equipartition theorem</a> to large systems of classical particles failed to explain the measurements of the <a href="Heat_capacity" title="wikilink">specific heats</a> of both solids and gases, and he argued that this was evidence of the danger of basing thermodynamics on "hypotheses about the constitution of matter".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> Gibbs's own framework for statistical mechanics was so carefully constructed that it could be carried over almost intact after the discovery that the microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules, rather than the classical laws known to Gibbs and to his contemporaries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> His resolution of the so-called "<a href="Gibbs_paradox" title="wikilink">Gibbs paradox</a>", about the entropy of the mixing of gases, is now often cited as a prefiguration of the <a href="Identical_particles" title="wikilink">indistinguishability of particles</a> required by quantum physics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="vector-analysis">Vector analysis</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>

</figure>

<p>British scientists, including Maxwell, had relied on Hamilton's <a href="quaternion" title="wikilink">quaternions</a> in order to express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. Gibbs, however, noted that the product of quaternions always had to be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (scalar) quantity and a three-dimensional <a href="Euclidean_vector" title="wikilink">vector</a>, so that the use of quaternions introduced mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. He therefore proposed defining distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced the now common notation for them. He was also largely responsible for the development of the <a href="vector_calculus" title="wikilink">vector calculus</a> techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.</p>

<p>While he was working on vector analysis in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his "multiple algebra".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. To establish Grassmann's priority, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay on <a href="tide" title="wikilink">tides</a> that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the <a href="University_of_Berlin" title="wikilink">University of Berlin</a>, in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>As Gibbs had advocated in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of the vectorial approach developed by him and, independently, by Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet <a href="orbit" title="wikilink">orbits</a>. He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in <a class="uri" href="crystallography" title="wikilink">crystallography</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>

<p>Though Gibbs's research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work, it made a significant contribution to classical <a class="uri" href="electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a> by applying <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a> to the theory of optical processes such as <a class="uri" href="birefringence" title="wikilink">birefringence</a>, <a href="Dispersion_(optics)" title="wikilink">dispersion</a>, and <a href="Optical_rotation" title="wikilink">optical activity</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell's equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or about the nature of the medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called <a href="Luminiferous_aether" title="wikilink">luminiferous ether</a>). Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a <a href="longitudinal_wave" title="wikilink">longitudinal</a> electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of <a class="uri" href="light" title="wikilink">light</a>, is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell's equations (by virtue of what is now called their "<a href="Gauge_fixing" title="wikilink">gauge invariance</a>"), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin's, it must be imposed as an <em>ad hoc</em> condition on the properties of the aether.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>In his last paper on physical optics, Gibbs concluded that</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by the experiments of <a href="Heinrich_Hertz" title="wikilink">Heinrich Hertz</a> in Germany.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="scientific-recognition">Scientific recognition</h2>

<p>Gibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in the United States. His research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> His seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in the <em>Transactions of the Connecticut Academy</em>, a journal edited by his librarian brother-in-law, which was little read in the USA and even less so in Europe. When Gibbs submitted his long paper on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to the Academy, both <a href="Elias_Loomis" title="wikilink">Elias Loomis</a> and H. A. Newton protested that they did not understand Gibbs's work at all, but they helped to raise the money needed to pay for the typesetting of the many mathematical symbols in the paper. Several Yale faculty members, as well as business and professional men in New Haven, contributed funds for that purpose.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

<p>Even though it had been immediately embraced by Maxwell, Gibbs's graphical formulation of the laws of thermodynamics only came into widespread use in the mid 20th century, with the work of <a href="László_Tisza" title="wikilink">László Tisza</a> and <a href="Herbert_Callen" title="wikilink">Herbert Callen</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> According to James Gerald Crowther,</p>

<p>On the other hand, Gibbs did receive the major honors then possible for an academic scientist in the US. He was elected to the <a href="National_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">National Academy of Sciences</a> in 1879 and received the 1880 <a href="Rumford_Prize" title="wikilink">Rumford Prize</a> from the <a href="American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="wikilink">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> for his work on chemical thermodynamics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> He was also awarded honorary doctorates by Princeton University and <a href="Williams_College" title="wikilink">Williams College</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>In his autobiography, mathematician <a href="Gian-Carlo_Rota" title="wikilink">Gian-Carlo Rota</a> tells of casually browsing the mathematical stacks of <a href="Sterling_Library" title="wikilink">Sterling Library</a> and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list, attached to some of Gibbs's course notes, which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day, including Poincaré, Boltzmann, <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">David Hilbert</a>, and <a href="Ernst_Mach" title="wikilink">Ernst Mach</a>.

<h2 id="influence">Influence</h2>

<p>Gibbs's most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics, two disciplines which he greatly helped to found. During Gibbs's lifetime, his phase rule was experimentally validated by Dutch chemist <a href="Hendrik_Willem_Bakhuis_Roozeboom" title="wikilink">H. W.

Guggenheim</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Under the influence of Lewis, <a href="William_Giauque" title="wikilink">William Giauque</a> (who had originally wanted to be a <a href="chemical_engineer" title="wikilink">chemical engineer</a>) went on to become a professor of chemistry at <a href="University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="wikilink">Berkeley</a> and won the 1949 <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for his investigations into the properties of matter at temperatures close to absolute zero, studies guided by the <a href="third_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">third law of thermodynamics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs's work on statistical ensembles, as presented in his 1902 textbook, has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> According to mathematical physicist <a href="Arthur_Wightman" title="wikilink">Arthur Wightman</a>,</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Initially unaware of Gibbs's contributions in that field, <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a> wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904. After reading Gibbs's textbook (which was translated into German by <a href="Ernst_Zermelo" title="wikilink">Ernst Zermelo</a> in 1905), Einstein declared that Gibbs's treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known Gibbs's work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn123" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs's early papers on the use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call "<a href="convex_analysis" title="wikilink">convex analysis</a>",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn124" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> including ideas that, according to <a href="Barry_Simon" title="wikilink">Barry Simon</a>, "lay dormant for about seventy-five years".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn125" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Important mathematical concepts based on Gibbs's work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include the <a href="Gibbs_lemma" title="wikilink">Gibbs lemma</a> in <a href="game_theory" title="wikilink">game theory</a>, the <a href="Gibbs'_inequality" title="wikilink">Gibbs inequality</a> and <a href="Gibbs_algorithm" title="wikilink">Gibbs algorithm</a> in <a href="information_theory" title="wikilink">information theory</a>, as well as <a href="Gibbs_sampling" title="wikilink">Gibbs sampling</a> in <a href="computational_statistics" title="wikilink">computational statistics</a>.</p>

<p>The development of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook <em><a href="Vector_Analysis" title="wikilink">Vector Analysis</a></em>, based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, did much to propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>At Yale, Gibbs was also mentor to Lee De Forest, who went on to invent the <a class="uri" href="triode" title="wikilink">triode</a> amplifier and has been called the "father of radio".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> De Forest credited Gibbs's influence for the realization "that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the <a href="Electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">higher theory of waves</a> and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Another student of Gibbs who played a significant role in the development of radio technology was Lynde Wheeler.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics. He supervised the thesis of <a href="Irving_Fisher" title="wikilink">Irving Fisher</a>, who received the first Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1891. In that work, published in 1892 as <em>Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices</em>, Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the <a href="General_equilibrium_theory" title="wikilink">general equilibrium</a> of markets, and he used Gibbs's vectorial notation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn131" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> Gibbs's protegé Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate <a href="Paul_Samuelson" title="wikilink">Paul Samuelson</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn132" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> In 1947, Samuelson published <em><a href="Foundations_of_Economic_Analysis" title="wikilink">Foundations of Economic Analysis</a></em>, based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as <a href="Epigraph_(literature)" title="wikilink">epigraph</a> a remark attributed to Gibbs: "Mathematics is a language." Samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his "debts were not primarily to <a href="Vilfredo_Pareto" title="wikilink">Pareto</a> or <a href="Eugen_Slutsky" title="wikilink">Slutsky</a>, but to the great thermodynamicist, Willard Gibbs of Yale."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn133" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a></p>

<p>Mathematician <a href="Norbert_Wiener" title="wikilink">Norbert Wiener</a> cited Gibbs's use of probability in the formulation of statistical mechanics as "the first great revolution of twentieth century physics" and as a major influence on his conception of <a class="uri" href="cybernetics" title="wikilink">cybernetics</a>. Wiener explained in the preface to his book <em><a href="The_Human_Use_of_Human_Beings" title="wikilink">The Human Use of Human Beings</a></em> that it was "devoted to the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life, both through the substantive changes it has made to working science, and through the changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn134" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1945, Yale University created the J. Willard Gibbs Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry, held until 1973 by <a href="Lars_Onsager" title="wikilink">Lars Onsager</a>.

<p>Edward Guggenheim introduced the symbol <em>G</em> for the Gibbs free energy in 1933, and this was used also by <a href="Dirk_ter_Haar" title="wikilink">Dirk ter Haar</a> in 1966.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a> This notation is now universal and is recommended by the <a href="International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry" title="wikilink">IUPAC</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> In 1960, William Giauque and others suggested the name "gibbs" (abbreviated gbs.) for the unit of entropy, <a class="uri" href="calorie" title="wikilink">calorie</a> / <a class="uri" href="Kelvin" title="wikilink">Kelvin</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> but this usage did not become common and the corresponding <a href="International_System_of_Units" title="wikilink">SI</a> unit, <a class="uri" href="Joule" title="wikilink">Joule</a> / Kelvin, carries no special name.</p>

<p>In 1954, a year before his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known.

<p>In 1909, the American historian and novelist <a href="Henry_Adams" title="wikilink">Henry Adams</a> finished an essay entitled "The Rule of Phase Applied to History", in which he sought to apply Gibbs's phase rule and other thermodynamic concepts to a general theory of human history. <a href="William_James" title="wikilink">William James</a>, Henry Bumstead, and others criticized both Adams's tenuous grasp of the scientific concepts that he invoked, as well as the arbitrariness of his application of those concepts as metaphors for the evolution of human thought and society.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn148" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a> The essay remained unpublished until it appeared posthumously in 1919, in <em>The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma</em>, edited by Henry Adams's younger brother <a href="Brooks_Adams" title="wikilink">Brooks</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn149" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 1930s, feminist poet <a href="Muriel_Rukeyser" title="wikilink">Muriel Rukeyser</a> became fascinated by Willard Gibbs and wrote a long poem about his life and work ("Gibbs", included in the collection <em>A Turning Wind</em>, published in 1939), as well as a book-length biography (<em>Willard Gibbs</em>, 1942).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn150" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> According to Rukeyser:</p>

<p><mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>In 1946, <em><a href="Fortune_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Fortune</a></em> magazine illustrated a cover story on "Fundamental Science" with a representation of the <a href="Maxwell's_thermodynamic_surface" title="wikilink">thermodynamic surface</a> that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs's proposal. Rukeyser had called this surface a "statue of water"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn151" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a> and the magazine saw in it "the abstract creation of a great American scientist that lends itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn152" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs's mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a <a class="uri" href="radar" title="wikilink">radar</a> screen, an <a class="uri" href="oscilloscope" title="wikilink">oscilloscope</a> waveform, <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Newton's</a> apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn153" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></p>

<p>Gibbs's nephew, Ralph Gibbs Van Name, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, was unhappy with Rukeyser's biography, in part because of her lack of scientific training. Van Name had withheld the family papers from her and, after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews, he tried to encourage Gibbs's former students to produce a more technically oriented biography.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn154" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> Rukeyser's approach to Gibbs was also sharply criticized by Gibbs's former student and protégé Edwin Wilson.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn155" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> With Van Name's and Wilson's encouragement, physicist Lynde Wheeler published a new biography of Gibbs in 1951.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn156" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn157" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
