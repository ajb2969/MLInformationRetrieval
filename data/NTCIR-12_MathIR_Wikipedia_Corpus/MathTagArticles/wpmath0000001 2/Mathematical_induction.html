<p><strong>Mathematical induction</strong> is a method of <a href="mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">mathematical proof</a> typically used to establish a given statement for all <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>. It is a form of <a href="direct_proof" title="wikilink">direct proof</a>, and it is done in two steps. The first step, known as the <strong>base case</strong>, is to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the <strong>inductive step</strong>, is to prove that the given statement for any one natural number <a href="material_conditional" title="wikilink">implies</a> the given statement for the next natural number. From these two steps, mathematical induction is the <a href="Rule_of_inference" title="wikilink">rule</a> from which we infer that the given statement is established for all natural numbers.</p>
<p>The method can be extended to prove statements about more general <a class="uri" href="well-founded" title="wikilink">well-founded</a> structures, such as <a href="tree_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">trees</a>; this generalization, known as <a href="structural_induction" title="wikilink">structural induction</a>, is used in <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> and <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>. Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to <a class="uri" href="recursion" title="wikilink">recursion</a>. Mathematical induction, in some form, is the foundation of all correctness proofs for computer programs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Although its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be misconstrued as a form of <a href="inductive_reasoning" title="wikilink">inductive reasoning</a> (also see <a href="Problem_of_induction" title="wikilink">Problem of induction</a>). Mathematical induction is an <a href="inference_rule" title="wikilink">inference rule</a> used in proofs. In mathematics, proofs including those using mathematical induction are examples of <a href="deductive_reasoning" title="wikilink">deductive reasoning</a>, and inductive reasoning is excluded from proofs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In 370 BC, <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a>'s <a href="Parmenides_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Parmenides</a> may have contained an early example of an implicit inductive proof.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The earliest implicit traces of mathematical induction can be found in <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a>'s<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> proof that the number of primes is infinite and in <a href="Bhāskara_II" title="wikilink">Bhaskara</a>'s "<a href="Chakravala_method" title="wikilink">cyclic method</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> An opposite iterated technique, counting <em>down</em> rather than up, is found in the <a href="Sorites_paradox" title="wikilink">Sorites paradox</a>, where one argued that if 1,000,000 grains of sand formed a heap, and removing one grain from a heap left it a heap, then a single grain of sand (or even no grains) forms a heap.</p>
<p>An implicit <a href="Mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">proof</a> by mathematical induction for <a href="Arithmetic_progression" title="wikilink">arithmetic sequences</a> was introduced in the <em>al-Fakhri</em> written by <a class="uri" href="al-Karaji" title="wikilink">al-Karaji</a> around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the <a href="binomial_theorem" title="wikilink">binomial theorem</a> and properties of <a href="Pascal's_triangle" title="wikilink">Pascal's triangle</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>None of these ancient mathematicians, however, explicitly stated the inductive hypothesis. Another similar case (contrary to what Vacca has written, as Freudenthal carefully showed) was that of <a href="Francesco_Maurolico" title="wikilink">Francesco Maurolico</a> in his <em>Arithmeticorum libri duo</em> (1575), who used the technique to prove that the sum of the first <em>n</em> odd integers is <em>n</em><sup>2</sup>. The first explicit formulation of the principle of induction was given by <a href="Blaise_Pascal" title="wikilink">Pascal</a> in his <em>Traité du triangle arithmétique</em> (1665). Another Frenchman, <a class="uri" href="Fermat" title="wikilink">Fermat</a>, made ample use of a related principle, indirect proof by infinite descent. The inductive hypothesis was also employed by the Swiss <a href="Jakob_Bernoulli" title="wikilink">Jakob Bernoulli</a>, and from then on it became more or less well known. The modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the principle came only in the 19th century, with <a href="George_Boole" title="wikilink">George Boole</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Augustus_de_Morgan" title="wikilink">Augustus de Morgan</a>, <a href="Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="wikilink">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a href="Giuseppe_Peano" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Peano</a>, and <a href="Richard_Dedekind" title="wikilink">Richard Dedekind</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The simplest and most common form of mathematical induction infers that a statement involving a natural number <em>n</em> holds for all values of <em>n</em>. The proof consists of two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <strong>basis</strong> (<strong>base case</strong>): prove that the statement holds for the first natural number <em>n</em>. Usually, <em>n</em> = 0 or <em>n</em> = 1, rarely, <em>n</em> = –1 (although not a natural number, the extension of the natural numbers to –1 is still a well-ordered set).</p></li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>inductive step</strong>: prove that, if the statement holds for some natural number <em>n</em>, then the statement holds for <em>n</em> + 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The hypothesis in the inductive step that the statement holds for some <em>n</em> is called the <strong>induction hypothesis</strong> (or <strong>inductive hypothesis</strong>). To perform the inductive step, one assumes the induction hypothesis and then uses this assumption to prove the statement for <em>n</em> + 1.</p>
<p>Whether <em>n</em> = 0 or <em>n</em> = 1 depends on the definition of the <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>. If 0 is considered a natural number, as is common in the fields of <a class="uri" href="combinatorics" title="wikilink">combinatorics</a> and <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a>, the base case is given by <em>n</em> = 0. If, on the other hand, 1 is taken as the first natural number, then the base case is given by <em>n</em> = 1.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Mathematical induction can be used to prove that the following statement, which we will call <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>), holds for all natural numbers <em>n</em>.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\,.$$</span></p>
<p><em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) gives a formula for the sum of the <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> less than or equal to number <em>n</em>. The proof that <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) is true for each natural number <em>n</em> proceeds as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Basis</strong>: Show that the statement holds for <em>n</em> = 0.<br/>
<em>P</em>(0) amounts to the statement:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$0 = \frac{0\cdot(0 + 1)}{2}\,.$$</span> In the left-hand side of the equation, the only term is 0, and so the left-hand side is simply equal to 0.<br/>
In the right-hand side of the equation, 0·(0 + 1)/2 = 0.<br/>
The two sides are equal, so the statement is true for <em>n</em> = 0. Thus it has been shown that <em>P</em>(0) holds.</p>
<p><strong>Inductive step</strong>: Show that <em>if</em> <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>) holds, then also  holds. This can be done as follows.</p>
<p>Assume <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>) holds (for some unspecified value of <em>k</em>). It must then be shown that  holds, that is:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + k )+ (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)((k+1) + 1)}{2}.$$</span> Using the induction hypothesis that <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>) holds, the left-hand side can be rewritten to:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k+1)\,.$$</span></p>
<p>Algebraically:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}
\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k+1) & = \frac {k(k+1)+2(k+1)} 2 \\
& = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\
& = \frac{(k+1)((k+1) + 1)}{2}
\end{align}$$</span></p>
<p>thereby showing that indeed  holds.</p>
<p>Since both the basis and the inductive step have been performed, by mathematical induction, the statement <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) holds for all natural <em>n</em>. <a class="uri" href="Q.E.D." title="wikilink">Q.E.D.</a></p>
<h2 id="axiom-of-induction">Axiom of induction</h2>
<p>Mathematical induction as an inference rule can be formalized as a <a href="second-order_logic" title="wikilink">second-order</a> <a class="uri" href="axiom" title="wikilink">axiom</a>. The <em><a class="uri" href="axiom" title="wikilink">axiom</a> of induction</em> is, in <a href="Table_of_logic_symbols" title="wikilink">logical symbols</a>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\forall P.\,[[P(0) \land \forall (k \in \mathbb{N}).\,[P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)]] \Rightarrow \forall (n \in \mathbb{N}).\,P(n)]$$</span></p>
<p>where <em>P</em> is any predicate and <em>k</em> and <em>n</em> are both <a href="natural_numbers" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>.</p>
<p>In words, the basis <em>P</em>(0) and the inductive step (namely, that the inductive hypothesis <em>P</em>(<em>k</em>) implies <em>P</em>(<em>k</em> + 1)) together imply that <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) for any natural number <em>n</em>. The axiom of induction asserts that the validity of inferring that <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) holds for any natural number <em>n</em> from the basis and the inductive step.</p>
<p>Note that the first quantifier in the axiom ranges over <em>predicates</em> rather than over individual numbers. This is a second-order quantifier, which means that this axiom is stated in <a href="second-order_logic" title="wikilink">second-order logic</a>. Axiomatizing arithmetic induction in <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order logic</a> requires an <a href="axiom_schema" title="wikilink">axiom schema</a> containing a separate axiom for each possible predicate. The article <a href="Peano_axioms" title="wikilink">Peano axioms</a> contains further discussion of this issue.</p>
<h3 id="characterizing-the-structure-of-n-by-the-induction-axiom">Characterizing the structure of N by the induction axiom</h3>
<p>Having proven the base case and the inductive step, then the structure of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{N}$</span> is such that any value can be obtained by performing the inductive step repeatedly. It may be helpful to think of the <a href="domino_effect" title="wikilink">domino effect</a>. Consider a half line of dominoes each standing on end, and extending infinitely to the right (see picture). Suppose that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first domino falls right.</li>
<li>If a (fixed but arbitrary) domino falls right, then its next neighbor also falls right.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these assumptions one can conclude (using mathematical induction) that all of the dominoes will fall right.</p>
<p>If the dominoes are arranged in another way, this conclusion needn't hold (see <a href="Peano_axioms#Formulation" title="wikilink">Peano axioms#Formulation</a> for a counter example). Similarly, the induction axiom describes an essential property of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbb{N}$</span>, viz. that each of its members can be reached from 0 by sufficiently often adding 1. While there is only one structure that satisfies all <a href="Peano_axioms" title="wikilink">Peano axioms</a> (including induction),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> there is no set of only first-order axioms that fulfils the same task.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="variants">Variants</h2>
<p>In practice, proofs by induction are often structured differently, depending on the exact nature of the property to be proved.</p>
<h3 id="induction-basis-other-than-0-or-1">Induction basis other than 0 or 1</h3>
<p>If we want to prove a statement not for all natural numbers but only for all numbers greater than or equal to a certain number <em>b</em> then the proof by induction consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Showing that the statement holds when <em>n</em> = <em>b</em>.</li>
<li>Showing that if the statement holds for <em>n</em> = <em>m</em> ≥ <em>b</em> then the same statement also holds for <em>n</em> = <em>m</em> + 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be used, for example, to show that <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> ≥ 3<em>n</em> for <em>n</em> ≥ 3. A more substantial example is a proof that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$${n^n \over 3^n} < n! < {n^n \over 2^n}\mbox{ for }n\ge 6.$$</span></p>
<p>In this way we can prove that <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) holds for all <em>n</em> ≥1, or even <em>n</em> ≥−5. This form of mathematical induction is actually a special case of the previous form because if the statement that we intend to prove is <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>) then proving it with these two rules is equivalent with proving <em>P</em>(<em>n</em> + <em>b</em>) for all natural numbers <em>n</em> with the first two steps.</p>
<h3 id="induction-basis-equal-to-2">Induction basis equal to 2</h3>
<p>In mathematics, many standard functions, including operations such as "+" and relations such as "=", are binary, meaning that they take two arguments. Often these functions possess properties that implicitly extend them to more than two arguments. For example, once addition <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> is defined and is known to satisfy the <a class="uri" href="associativity" title="wikilink">associativity</a> property (<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>) + <em>c</em> = <em>a</em> + (<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>), then the ternary addition <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> makes sense, either as (<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>) + <em>c</em> or as <em>a</em> + (<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>). Similarly, many axioms and theorems in mathematics are stated only for the binary versions of mathematical operations and relations, and implicitly extend to higher-<a class="uri" href="arity" title="wikilink">arity</a> versions.</p>
<p>Suppose that we wish to prove a statement about an <em>n</em>-ary operation implicitly defined from a binary operation, using mathematical induction on <em>n</em>. In this case it is natural to take 2 for the induction basis.</p>
<h4 id="example-product-rule-for-the-derivative">Example: product rule for the derivative</h4>
<p>In this example, the binary operation in question is multiplication (of functions). The usual <a href="product_rule" title="wikilink">product rule</a> for the <a class="uri" href="derivative" title="wikilink">derivative</a> taught in <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a> states:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(fg)' = f'g + g'f. \!$$</span></p>
<p>or in logarithmic derivative form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(fg)'/ (fg) = f'/f + g'/g. \!$$</span></p>
<p>This can be generalized to a product of <em>n</em> functions. One has</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(f_1 f_2 f_3 \cdots f_n)' \!$$</span></p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$= (f_1' f_2 f_3 \cdots f_n) + (f_1 f_2' f_3 \cdots  f_n) + (f_1 f_2 f_3' \cdots  f_n) + \cdots +(f_1 f_2 \cdots f_{n-1} f_n').$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>or in logarithmic derivative form</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(f_1 f_2 f_3 \cdots f_n)'/(f_1 f_2 f_3 \cdots f_n) \!$$</span></p>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$= (f_1'/f_1) + (f_2'/f_2) + (f_3'/f_3) + \cdots + (f_n'/f_n).$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In each of the <em>n</em> terms of the usual form, just one of the factors is a derivative; the others are not.</p>
<p>When this general fact is proved by mathematical induction, the <em>n</em> = 0 case is trivial,<span class="LaTeX">$(1)' = 0 \!$</span> (since the <a href="empty_product" title="wikilink">empty product</a> is 1, and the <a href="empty_sum" title="wikilink">empty sum</a> is 0). The <em>n</em> = 1 case is also trivial, <span class="LaTeX">$f_1' = f_1' \!.$</span> And for each <em>n</em> ≥ 3, the case is easy to prove from the preceding <em>n</em> − 1 case. The real difficulty lies in the <em>n</em> = 2 case, which is why that is the one stated in the standard product rule.</p>
<h3 id="induction-on-more-than-one-counter">Induction on more than one counter</h3>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to prove a statement involving two natural numbers, <em>n</em> and <em>m</em>, by iterating the induction process. That is, one performs a basis step and an inductive step for <em>n</em>, and in each of those performs a basis step and an inductive step for <em>m</em>. See, for example, the <a href="Proofs_involving_the_addition_of_natural_numbers" title="wikilink">proof of commutativity</a> accompanying <em><a href="addition_of_natural_numbers" title="wikilink">addition of natural numbers</a></em>. More complicated arguments involving three or more counters are also possible.</p>
<h3 id="infinite-descent">Infinite descent</h3>
<p>The method of infinite descent was one of <a href="Pierre_de_Fermat" title="wikilink">Pierre de Fermat</a>'s favorites. This method of proof can assume several slightly different forms. For example, it might begin by showing that if a statement is true for a natural number <em>n</em> it must also be true for some smaller natural number <em>m</em> (<em>m</em> \forall k (P(k) \to P(k+1))</p>
<p>or equivalently</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\forall k (P(k-1) \to P(k))$$</span></p>
<p>whereupon the induction principle "automates" n applications of this inference in getting from <em>P</em>(0) to <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>). This could be called "predecessor induction" because each step proves something about a number from something about that number's predecessor.</p>
<p>A variant of interest in computational complexity is "prefix induction", in which one needs to prove</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\forall k (P(k) \to P(2k) \land P(2k+1))$$</span></p>
<p>or equivalently</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\forall k \left( P \left(\left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor \right) \to P(k) \right)$$</span></p>
<p>The induction principle then "automates" log <em>n</em> applications of this inference in getting from <em>P</em>(0) to <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>). (It is called "prefix induction" because each step proves something about a number from something about the "prefix" of that number formed by truncating the low bit of its binary representation.)</p>
<p>If traditional predecessor induction is interpreted computationally as an <em>n</em>-step loop, prefix induction corresponds to a log <em>n</em>-step loop, and thus proofs using prefix induction are "more feasibly constructive" than proofs using predecessor induction.</p>
<p>Predecessor induction can trivially simulate prefix induction on the same statement. Prefix induction can simulate predecessor induction, but only at the cost of making the statement more syntactically complex (adding a bounded universal quantifier), so the interesting results relating prefix induction to polynomial-time computation depend on excluding unbounded quantifiers entirely, and limiting the alternation of bounded universal and existential quantifiers allowed in the statement. See <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>One could take it a step farther to "prefix of prefix induction": one must prove</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\forall k \left( P \left( \left\lfloor \sqrt{k} \right\rfloor \right) \to P(k) \right)$$</span></p>
<p>whereupon the induction principle "automates" log log <em>n</em> applications of this inference in getting from <em>P</em>(0) to <em>P</em>(<em>n</em>). This form of induction has been used, analogously, to study log-time parallel computation.</p>
<h3 id="complete-induction">Complete induction</h3>
<p>Another variant, called <strong>complete induction</strong>, <strong>course of values induction</strong> or <strong>strong induction</strong> (in contrast to which the basic form of induction is sometimes known as <strong>weak induction</strong>) makes the inductive step easier to prove by using a stronger hypothesis: one proves the statement P(<em>m+1</em>) under the assumption that P(<em>n</em>) holds for <strong>all</strong> natural <em>n</em> less than <em>m+1</em>; by contrast, the basic form only assumes P(<em>m</em>). The name "strong induction" does not mean that this method can prove more than "weak induction", but merely refers to the stronger hypothesis used in the inductive step; in fact the two methods are equivalent, as explained below. In this form of complete induction one still has to prove the base case, P(0), and it may even be necessary to prove extra base cases such as P(1) before the general argument applies, as in the example below of the Fibonacci number <em>F<sub>n</sub></em>.</p>
<p>Although the form just described requires one to prove the base case, this is unnecessary if one can prove P(<em>m</em>) (assuming P(<em>n</em>) for all lower <em>n</em>) for all <em>m</em> ≥ 0. This is a special case of <a href="#Transfinite_induction" title="wikilink">transfinite induction</a> as described below. In this form the base case is subsumed by the case <em>m</em> = 0, where P(0) is proved with no other P(<em>n</em>) assumed; this case may need to be handled separately, but sometimes the same argument applies for <em>m</em> = 0 and <em>m</em> > 0, making the proof simpler and more elegant. In this method it is, however, vital to ensure that the proof of P(<em>m</em>) does not implicitly assume that <em>m</em> > 0, e.g. by saying "choose an arbitrary <em>n</em>  F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\varphi - \psi} where <em>F<sub>n</sub></em> is the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> <a href="Fibonacci_number" title="wikilink">Fibonacci number</a>, φ = (1 + √5)/2 (the <a href="golden_ratio" title="wikilink">golden ratio</a>) and ψ = (1 − √5)/2 are the roots of the polynomial <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>x</em> − 1. By using the fact that <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 2</sub> = <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub> + <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> for each <em>n</em> ∈ <strong>N</strong>, the identity above can be verified by direct calculation for <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 2</sub> if we assume that it already holds for both <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub> and <em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. To complete the proof, the identity must be verified in the two base cases <em>n</em> = 0 and <em>n</em> = 1.</p>
<p>Another proof by complete induction uses the hypothesis that the statement holds for <em>all</em> smaller <em>n</em> more thoroughly. Consider the statement that "every <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural number</a> greater than 1 is a product of (one or more) <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a>", and assume that for a given <em>m</em> > 1 it holds for all smaller <em>n</em> > 1. If <em>m</em> is prime then it is certainly a product of primes, and if not, then by definition it is a product: <em>m</em> = <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>, where neither of the factors is equal to 1; hence neither is equal to <em>m</em>, and so both are smaller than <em>m</em>. The induction hypothesis now applies to <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>, so each one is a product of primes. Thus <em>m</em> is a product of products of primes; i.e. a product of primes.</p>
<h4 id="transfinite-induction">Transfinite induction</h4>
<p>The last two steps can be reformulated as one step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Showing that if the statement holds for all <em>n</em> < <em>m</em> then the same statement also holds for <em>n</em> = <em>m</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This form of mathematical induction is not only valid for statements about natural numbers, but for statements about elements of any <a href="well-founded_set" title="wikilink">well-founded set</a>, that is, a set with an <a href="reflexive_relation" title="wikilink">irreflexive relation</a> . Reprinted in <em>A Random Walk in Science</em> (R. L. Weber, ed.), Crane, Russak & Co., 1973.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basis: If there is only <em>one</em> horse, there is only one color.</li>
<li>Induction step: Assume as induction hypothesis that within any set of <em>n</em> horses, there is only one color. Now look at any set of <em>n</em> + 1 horses. Number them: 1, 2, 3, ..., <em>n</em>, <em>n</em> + 1. Consider the sets {1, 2, 3, ..., <em>n</em>} and {2, 3, 4, ..., <em>n</em> + 1}. Each is a set of only <em>n</em> horses, therefore within each there is only one color. But the two sets overlap, so there must be only one color among all <em>n</em> + 1 horses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basis case <em>n</em> = 1 is trivial (as any horse is the same color as itself), and the inductive step is correct in all cases <em>n</em> > 1. However, the logic of the inductive step is incorrect for <em>n</em> = 1, because the statement that "the two sets overlap" is false (there are only <em>n</em> + 1 = 2 horses prior to either removal, and after removal the sets of one horse each do not overlap).</p>

The theorem is proved to be true when <em>n</em> = 1. <em>2ndly</em>. It is proved that if the theorem is true when <em>n</em> is a given whole number, it will be true if <em>n</em> is the next greater integer. Hence the theorem is true universally. . ..
