<h1>Zhang Heng</h1>

<p><strong>Zhang Heng</strong> (<a href="Chinese_language" title="wikilink">Chinese</a>: <small><a href="traditional_characters" title="wikilink">t</a></small> , <small><a href="simplified_characters" title="wikilink">s</a></small> , <small><a href="pinyin" title="wikilink">p</a></small> <em>Zhāng Héng</em>; AD 78–139), formerly <a href="romanization_of_Chinese" title="wikilink">romanized</a> as <strong>Chang Hêng</strong>, was a <a href="Han_Chinese" title="wikilink">Han Chinese</a> <a class="uri" href="polymath" title="wikilink">polymath</a> from <a href="Nanyang,_Henan" title="wikilink">Nanyang</a> who lived during the <a href="Eastern_Han_dynasty" title="wikilink">Han dynasty</a>. Educated in the capital cities of <a class="uri" href="Luoyang" title="wikilink">Luoyang</a> and <a class="uri" href="Chang'an" title="wikilink">Chang'an</a>, he achieved success as an <a href="Chinese_astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomer</a>, <a href="Chinese_mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, <a class="uri" href="scientist" title="wikilink">scientist</a>, <a class="uri" href="engineer" title="wikilink">engineer</a>, <a class="uri" href="inventor" title="wikilink">inventor</a>, <a class="uri" href="geographer" title="wikilink">geographer</a>, <a href="History_of_cartography#China" title="wikilink">cartographer</a>, <a href="Chinese_painting" title="wikilink">artist</a>, <a href="Chinese_poetry" title="wikilink">poet</a>, statesman, and literary scholar.</p>

<p>Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure, preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian. His political rivalry with the palace <a href="eunuch" title="wikilink">eunuchs</a> during the reign of <a href="Emperor_Shun_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Shun</a> (r. 125–144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of <a class="uri" href="Hejian" title="wikilink">Hejian</a> in <a class="uri" href="Hebei" title="wikilink">Hebei</a>. Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138. He died there a year later, in 139.</p>

<p>Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first <a href="Hydraulics" title="wikilink">water-powered</a> <a href="armillary_sphere" title="wikilink">armillary sphere</a> to assist astronomical observation;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> improved the inflow <a href="water_clock" title="wikilink">water clock</a> by adding another tank;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and invented the world's first <a class="uri" href="seismometer" title="wikilink">seismometer</a>, which discerned the <a href="cardinal_direction" title="wikilink">cardinal direction</a> of an <a class="uri" href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a>  away.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He improved previous Chinese calculations for <a class="uri" href="pi" title="wikilink">pi</a>. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in his extensive <a href="star_catalog" title="wikilink">star catalog</a>, Zhang also posited theories about the <a class="uri" href="Moon" title="wikilink">Moon</a> and its relationship to the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>: specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the <a href="Lunar_phase" title="wikilink">hidden nature</a> of the other, and the nature of <a href="Solar_eclipse" title="wikilink">solar</a> and <a href="lunar_eclipse" title="wikilink">lunar</a> <a href="eclipse" title="wikilink">eclipses</a>. His <em><a href="fu_(poetry)" title="wikilink">fu</a></em> (rhapsody) and <em><a href="shi_(poetry)" title="wikilink">shi</a></em> poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman <a class="uri" href="Ptolemy" title="wikilink">Ptolemy</a> (AD 86–161).</p>

<h3 id="official-career">Official career</h3>

<p>In 112, Zhang was summoned to the court of <a href="Emperor_An_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor An</a> (r. 106–125), who had heard of his expertise in mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage—a symbol of his official status—to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the <a href="Three_Excellencies" title="wikilink">Imperial Secretariat</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115–120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126–132.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of <a href="Nine_Ministers" title="wikilink">Nine Ministers</a> ranked just below the Three Excellencies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the <a class="uri" href="Censorate" title="wikilink">Censorate</a>, both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 <a href="Chinese_characters" title="wikilink">characters</a> and all major writing styles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving <a href="memorials_to_the_throne" title="wikilink">memorials to the throne</a> (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p> When the government official Dan Song proposed the <a href="Chinese_calendar" title="wikilink">Chinese calendar</a> should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain <a href="Apocrypha" title="wikilink">apocryphal teachings</a>, Zhang opposed the idea. He considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Others shared Zhang's opinion and the calendar was not altered, yet Zhang's proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> The officials Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu, members of a committee to compile the dynastic history <em>Dongguan Hanji</em> (), sought permission from the court to consult Zhang Heng.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> However, Zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of <a href="Emperor_Gengshi_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Gengshi's</a> (r. 23–25) role in the restoration of the Han Dynasty as lesser than Emperor Guangwu's.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu were Zhang's only historian allies at court, and after their deaths Zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>Despite this setback in his official career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after <a href="Emperor_Shun_of_Han" title="wikilink">Emperor Shun of Han</a> (r. 125–144) ascended to the throne.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> His intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600 bushels, or <em><a href="Government_of_the_Han_Dynasty#Salaries" title="wikilink">shi</a></em>, of grain (mostly commuted to <a href="Chinese_coins" title="wikilink">coin cash</a> or bolts of <a class="uri" href="silk" title="wikilink">silk</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100 bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000 bushels during the Han.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>In 132, Zhang introduced an intricate <a class="uri" href="seismometer" title="wikilink">seismometer</a> to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant <a class="uri" href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400 km (248 mi) to 500 km (310 mi) northwest of Luoyang in <a class="uri" href="Gansu" title="wikilink">Gansu</a> province.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p> A year after Zhang presented his seismometer to the court, officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's <a href="memorial_to_the_throne" title="wikilink">memorial</a> discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title "<a href="Xiaolian" title="wikilink">Filial and Incorrupt</a>" at age forty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant, a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000 bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>As Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court <a href="eunuch" title="wikilink">eunuchs</a> represented a threat to the imperial court. Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs, and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang, who responded with a <em>fu</em> rhapsody called "<em>Fu</em> on Pondering the Mystery", which vents his frustration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> <a href="Rafe_de_Crespigny" title="wikilink">Rafe de Crespigny</a> states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to <a href="Qu_Yuan" title="wikilink">Qu Yuan</a>'s (340–278 BC) poem "<a href="Li_Sao" title="wikilink">Li Sao</a>" and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> </p>

<p> While working for the central court, Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the <em><a href="Records_of_the_Grand_Historian" title="wikilink">Records of the Grand Historian</a></em> by <a href="Sima_Qian" title="wikilink">Sima Qian</a> (145–90 BC) and the <em><a href="Book_of_Han" title="wikilink">Book of Han</a></em> by <a href="Ban_Gu" title="wikilink">Ban Gu</a> (AD 32–92) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> His account was preserved and recorded in the 5th century text of the <em><a href="Book_of_Later_Han" title="wikilink">Book of Later Han</a></em> by <a href="Fan_Ye_(historian)" title="wikilink">Fan Ye</a> (398–445).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> His <a href="Rhapsody_(music)" title="wikilink">rhapsodies</a> and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts, <a href="Chinese_philosophy" title="wikilink">Chinese philosophy</a>, and <a href="Twenty-Four_Histories" title="wikilink">histories</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> He also compiled a commentary on the <em>Taixuan</em> (, "Great Mystery") by the <a href="Taoism" title="wikilink">Daoist</a> author <a href="Yang_Xiong_(author)" title="wikilink">Yang Xiong</a> (53 BC–AD 18).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

Zhang's rhapsodies (, <em><a href="fu_(literature)" title="wikilink">fu</a></em>) include "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (西京賦), "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody" (東京賦), "Southern Capital Rhapsody" (南都賦), "Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery" (思玄賦), and "<a href="Return_to_the_Field_(rhapsody)" title="wikilink">Rhapsody on Returning to the Fields</a>" (歸田賦).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The latter fuses <a href="Daoism" title="wikilink">Daoist</a> ideas with <a class="uri" href="Confucianism" title="wikilink">Confucianism</a> and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry, according to Liu Wu-chi.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> A set of four short lyric poems (<em><a href="shi_(poetry)" title="wikilink">shi</a></em> <a href="shi_(poetry)" title="wikilink">詩</a>) entitled "Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows" (四愁詩), is also included with Zhang's preface.

<p>Zhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls.

<blockquote>

<p>The Sun is like fire and the Moon like water. The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself—this is called 'an-xu', a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) then there is a solar eclipse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn136" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p>Zhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn137" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies. The <a href="Music_theory" title="wikilink">music theorist</a> and mathematician <a href="Jing_Fang" title="wikilink">Jing Fang</a> (78–37 BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The Moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn138" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theory posited by Zhang and Jing was supported by later pre-modern scientists such as <a href="Shen_Kuo" title="wikilink">Shen Kuo</a> (1031–1095), who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun and Moon were spherical.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn139" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn158" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a></p>

<p>Zhang did not initiate the Chinese tradition of <a href="hydraulic_engineering" title="wikilink">hydraulic engineering</a>, which began during the mid Zhou Dynasty (c. 6th century BC), through the work of engineers such as <a href="Sunshu_Ao" title="wikilink">Sunshu Ao</a> and <a href="Ximen_Bao" title="wikilink">Ximen Bao</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn159" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a> Zhang's contemporary, <a href="Du_Shi" title="wikilink">Du Shi</a>, (d. AD 38) was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the <a class="uri" href="bellows" title="wikilink">bellows</a> of a <a href="blast_furnace" title="wikilink">blast furnace</a> to make <a href="pig_iron" title="wikilink">pig iron</a>, and the <a href="cupola_furnace" title="wikilink">cupola furnace</a> to make <a href="cast_iron" title="wikilink">cast iron</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn160" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn161" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Zhang provided a valuable description of his water-powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125, stating:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn162" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>

<p>Zhang Heng's water-powered armillary sphere had profound effects on Chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations.

<p>From the earliest times, the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's <em>Records of the Grand Historian</em> of 91 BC that in 780 BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn167" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a> It was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of <a href="tectonic_plate" title="wikilink">tectonic plates</a> in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic <a href="yin_and_yang" title="wikilink">yin and yang</a>, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn168" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the <em><a href="I_Ching" title="wikilink">Yijing</a></em> (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the <a href="Ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">ancient Greeks</a>. <a class="uri" href="Anaxagoras" title="wikilink">Anaxagoras</a> (c. 500–428 BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; <a class="uri" href="Democritus" title="wikilink">Democritus</a> (c. 460–370 BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; <a href="Anaximenes_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Anaximenes</a> (c. 585–c. 525 BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> (384–322 BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (<em>pneuma</em>) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

<p>During the Han Dynasty, many learned scholars—including Zhang Heng—believed in the "<a href="oracle" title="wikilink">oracles</a> of the winds".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a> These oracles of the occult observed the direction, force, and timing of the winds, to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> These ideas influenced Zhang Heng's views on the cause of earthquakes. Against the grain of earlier theories proposed by his fellow Chinese and contemporary Greeks, Zhang Heng believed that earthquakes were caused by wind and air, writing:</p>

<p>In 132, Zhang Heng presented to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first <a class="uri" href="seismometer" title="wikilink">seismometer</a>. It was named "earthquake weathervane" (<em>houfeng didongyi</em> 候風地動儀, lit. instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> and it was able to roughly determine the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> According to the <em><a href="Book_of_Later_Han" title="wikilink">Book of Later Han</a></em> (compiled by <a href="Fan_Ye_(historian)" title="wikilink">Fan Ye</a> in the 5th century), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a swinging pendulum inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> The <em>Book of Later Han</em> records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern <a href="Gansu_Province" title="wikilink">Gansu Province</a>), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a></p>

<p>To indicate the direction of a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a <a href="compass_rose" title="wikilink">compass rose</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a> When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<dd>Based on the theories of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.

<dd>Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn233" id="fnref233"><sup>233</sup></a>

In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above, the <a href="Eastern_Wu" title="wikilink">Eastern Wu</a> official <a href="Xue_Zong" title="wikilink">Xue Zong</a> (d. 237) wrote commentary on Zhang's poems "Dongjing fu" and "Xijing fu".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn234" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its "curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity", in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn235" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong "avoided inflated language, aiming chiefly at simplicity", and adding that their "compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet, serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn236" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="posthumous-honors">Posthumous honors</h3>

<p>Zhang was given great honors in life and in death. The philosopher and poet <a href="Fu_Xuan" title="wikilink">Fu Xuan</a> (217–278) of the <a href="Cao_Wei" title="wikilink">Wei</a> and <a href="Jin_Dynasty_(265–420)" title="wikilink">Jin</a> dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the <a href="Nine_Ministers" title="wikilink">Ministry of Works</a>. Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd-century mechanical engineer Ma Jun, Fu Xuan wrote, "Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works, and their ingenuity did not benefit the world. When (authorities) employ personnel with no regard to special talent, and having heard of genius neglect even to test it—is this not hateful and disastrous?"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn237" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a></p>

<p>In honor of Zhang's achievements in science and technology, his friend Cui Ziyu (Cui Yuan) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele, which has been preserved in the <em>Guwen yuan</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn238" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Cui stated, "[Zhang Heng's] mathematical computations exhausted (the riddles of) the heavens and the earth. His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change. The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn239" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a> The minor official Xiahou Zhan (243–291) of the Wei Dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng's tomb. It read: "Ever since gentlemen have composed literary texts, none has been as skillful as the Master [Zhang Heng] in choosing his words well ... if only the dead could rise, oh I could then turn to him for a teacher!"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn240" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>

<p>Several things have been named after Zhang in modern times, including the lunar crater <a href="Chang_Heng_(crater)" title="wikilink">Chang Heng</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn241" id="fnref241"><sup>241</sup></a> the asteroid <a href="1802_Zhang_Heng" title="wikilink">1802 Zhang Heng</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn242" id="fnref242"><sup>242</sup></a> and the mineral <a class="uri" href="Zhanghengite" title="wikilink">Zhanghengite</a>.</p>
