<h1>Vilfredo Pareto</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto</strong> (born <em>Wilfried Fritz Pareto</em>; ; 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian <a class="uri" href="engineer" title="wikilink">engineer</a>, <a class="uri" href="sociologist" title="wikilink">sociologist</a>, <a class="uri" href="economist" title="wikilink">economist</a>, political scientist, and <a class="uri" href="philosopher" title="wikilink">philosopher</a>. He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals' choices. He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term "<a class="uri" href="elite" title="wikilink">elite</a>" in social analysis.</p>

<p>He introduced the concept of <a href="Pareto_efficiency" title="wikilink">Pareto efficiency</a> and helped develop the field of <a class="uri" href="microeconomics" title="wikilink">microeconomics</a>. He was also the first to discover that <a class="uri" href="income" title="wikilink">income</a> follows a <a href="Pareto_distribution" title="wikilink">Pareto distribution</a>, which is a <a href="power_law" title="wikilink">power law</a> probability distribution. The <a href="Pareto_principle" title="wikilink">Pareto principle</a> was named after him and built on observations of his such as that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of <a class="uri" href="sociology" title="wikilink">sociology</a> and <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. According to the mathematician <a href="Benoit_Mandelbrot" title="wikilink">Benoit Mandelbrot</a> and Richard L. Hudson:</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Pareto was born of an exiled noble <a href="Genoa" title="wikilink">Genoese</a> family in 1848 in Paris, the centre of the popular revolutions of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812–1882), was an Italian civil engineer and Ligurian marquis who had left Italy much like <a href="Giuseppe_Mazzini" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Mazzini</a> and other Italian nationalists.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the <a href="Revolutions_of_1848_in_the_German_states" title="wikilink">1848 German revolution</a>, his parents named him Fritz Wilfried, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family's move back to Italy in 1858.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education. In 1869, he earned a doctor's degree in engineering from what is now the <a href="Politecnico_di_Torino" title="wikilink">Polytechnic University of Turin</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> His dissertation was entitled "The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies". His later interest in equilibrium analysis in <a href="Economic_equilibrium" title="wikilink">economics</a> and <a href="Social_equilibrium" title="wikilink">sociology</a> can be traced back to this paper.</p>
<h3 id="from-civil-engineer-to-liberal-and-then-to-economist">From Civil engineer to liberal, and then to economist</h3>

<p>For some years after graduation, he worked as a <a href="civil_engineer" title="wikilink">civil engineer</a>, first for the state-owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry. He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>He did not begin serious work in economics until his mid-forties. He started his career a fiery <a href="classical_liberalism" title="wikilink">liberal</a>, besting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the <a href="free_market" title="wikilink">free market</a>. In 1886 he became a lecturer on economics and <a class="uri" href="management" title="wikilink">management</a> at the <a href="University_of_Florence" title="wikilink">University of Florence</a>. His stay in <a class="uri" href="Florence" title="wikilink">Florence</a> was marked by political activity, much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle, quitting his job and marrying a Russian, Alessandrina Bakunin. She left him in 1902 for a young servant.</p>
<h3 id="economics-and-sociology">Economics and sociology</h3>

<p>In 1893, he succeeded <a href="Léon_Walras" title="wikilink">Léon Walras</a> to the chair of Political Economy at the <a href="University_of_Lausanne" title="wikilink">University of Lausanne</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1906, he made the famous observation that twenty percent of the population owned eighty percent of the property in Italy, later generalised by <a href="Joseph_M._Juran" title="wikilink">Joseph M. Juran</a> into the <a href="Pareto_principle" title="wikilink">Pareto principle</a> (also termed the <a href="80–20_rule" title="wikilink">80–20 rule</a>). In one of his books published in 1909 he showed the <a href="Pareto_distribution" title="wikilink">Pareto distribution</a> of how wealth is distributed, he believed "through any human society, in any age, or country".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists, but always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed. He later became suspicious of their humanitarian motives and denounced socialist leaders as an 'aristocracy of brigands' who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of <a href="Giovanni_Giolitti" title="wikilink">Giovanni Giolitti</a> for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes. Growing unrest among labor in Italy led him to the anti-socialist and anti-democratic camp.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> His attitude toward <a class="uri" href="fascism" title="wikilink">fascism</a> in his last years is a matter of controversy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="personal-life">Personal life</h3>

<p>In 1923 Pareto remarried with Jeanne Regis, just before he died in <a class="uri" href="Geneva" title="wikilink">Geneva</a>, Switzerland, 19 August 1923,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> "among a menagerie of cats that he and his French lover kept" in their villa; "the local divorce laws prevented him from divorcing his wife and remarrying until just a few months prior to his death".</p>
<h2 id="sociology">Sociology</h2>

<p>Pareto's later years were spent in collecting the material for his best-known work, <em>Trattato di sociologia generale</em> (1916) (<em>The Mind and Society</em>, published in 1935). His final work was <em>Compendio di sociologia generale</em> (1920).</p>

<p>In his <em>Trattato di Sociologia Generale</em> (1916, rev. French trans. 1917), published in English by <a href="Harcourt,_Brace" title="wikilink">Harcourt, Brace</a> in a four-volume edition edited by <a href="Arthur_Livingston" title="wikilink">Arthur Livingston</a> under the title <em><a href="The_Mind_and_Society" title="wikilink">The Mind and Society</a></em> (1935), Pareto developed the notion of the <a href="circulation_of_elite" title="wikilink">circulation of elites</a>, the first <a href="social_cycle_theory" title="wikilink">social cycle theory</a> in sociology. He is famous for saying "history is a graveyard of aristocracies".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Pareto seems to have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his abstract mathematical economic theories did not work out in practice, in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened. His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non-rational actions. We are driven, he taught, by certain "residues" and by "derivations" from these residues. The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk-taking, and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite, which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the "foxes" or speculators. A catastrophe results, with a return to conservatism; the "lion" mentality follows. This cycle might be broken by the use of force, says Pareto, but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Pareto's sociology was introduced to the United States by <a href="George_C._Homans" title="wikilink">George Homans</a> and <a href="Lawrence_Joseph_Henderson" title="wikilink">Lawrence J. Henderson</a> at Harvard, and had considerable influence, especially on Harvard sociologist <a href="Talcott_Parsons" title="wikilink">Talcott Parsons</a>, who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the status quo is usually functional.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Pareto was a lifelong <a href="Anti-Marxism" title="wikilink">opponent of Marxism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fascism-and-power-distribution">Fascism and power distribution</h2>

<p><a href="Benoît_Mandelbrot" title="wikilink">Benoît Mandelbrot</a> writes:</p>

<p>Pareto's discovery that <a href="power_law" title="wikilink">power laws</a> applied to income distribution embroiled him in political change and the nascent <a class="uri" href="Fascist" title="wikilink">Fascist</a> movement, whether he really sided with the Fascists or not. Fascists such as <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Mussolini</a> found inspiration for their own economic ideas in his discoveries. He had discovered something that was harsh and <a class="uri" href="Darwinian" title="wikilink">Darwinian</a>, in Pareto's view. And this fueled both the anger and the energy of the Fascist movement because it fueled their economic and social views. He wrote that, as Mandelbrot summarizes:</p>

<p>Pareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled. For this reason he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Benito Mussolini</a>'s rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the "pure" economic forces.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>To quote Pareto's biographer: <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p><a href="Karl_Popper" title="wikilink">Karl Popper</a> dubbed him the "theoretician of totalitarianism",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> but there is no evidence in Popper's published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgment in anti-fascist circles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>It is true that Pareto regarded Mussolini's triumph as a confirmation of certain of his ideas, largely because Mussolini demonstrated the importance of force and shared his contempt for <a href="bourgeoisie" title="wikilink">bourgeois</a> <a class="uri" href="parliamentarism" title="wikilink">parliamentarism</a>. He accepted a "royal" nomination to the Italian senate from Mussolini. But he died less than a year into the new regime's existence.</p>

<p>Some fascist writers were much enamored of Pareto, writing such paeans as: <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>But many modern historians reject the notion that Pareto's thought was essentially fascistic or that he is properly regarded as a supporter of fascism.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="economic-concepts">Economic concepts</h2>

<p><strong>Pareto Theory Of Maximum Economics</strong></p>

<p>Pareto turned his interest to economic matters and he became an advocate of free trade, finding himself in difficulty with the Italian government. His writings reflected the ideas of <a href="Léon_Walras" title="wikilink">Léon Walras</a> that economics is essentially a mathematical science. Pareto was a leader of the "<a href="Lausanne_School" title="wikilink">Lausanne School</a>" and represents the second generation of the <a href="Neoclassical_Revolution" title="wikilink">Neoclassical Revolution</a>. His "tastes-and-obstacles" approach to <a href="general_equilibrium_theory" title="wikilink">general equilibrium theory</a> were resurrected during the great "Paretian Revival" of the 1930s and have influenced theoretical economics since.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>In his <em>Manual of Political Economy</em> (1906) the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of "objectives and constraints". He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth (1881) extensively, for the theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer. He gave the first presentation of the trade-off box now known as the "Edgeworth-Bowley" box.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Pareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> – that is, it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that, only that he preferred X of this to Y of that. Utility was a preference-ordering. With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics, but he also demolished the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy (which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number; Pareto said "good" cannot be measured). He replaced it with the notion of <em>Pareto-optimality</em>, the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory. A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>

<p>Some economic concepts in current use are based on his work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Pareto_index" title="wikilink">Pareto index</a> is a measure of the inequality of income distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>He argued that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth. He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern:</p>

"Abstract. Vilfredo Pareto has been labeled a fascist and 'a precursor of fascism' largely because he welcomed the advent of fascism in Italy and was honored by the new regime. Some have seen in his sociological works the foundations of fascism. This is not correct. Even fascist writers did not find much merit in these works, and definitely condemned his economic theories. As a political thinker he remained a radical libertarian till the end, and continued to express serious reservations about fascism, and to voice opposition to its basic policies. This is evident from his correspondence with his close friends. There are strong reasons to believe that, had he lived long enough, Pareto would have revolted against fascism." —See also Stuart L.
