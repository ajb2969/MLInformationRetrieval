<h1>Mössbauer effect</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Mössbauer effect</strong>, or <strong>recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence</strong>, is a physical phenomenon discovered by <a href="Rudolf_Mössbauer" title="wikilink">Rudolf Mössbauer</a> in 1958. It involves the resonant and <a href="Atomic_recoil" title="wikilink">recoil</a>-free emission and absorption of <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma radiation</a> by atomic nuclei bound in a solid. Its main application is in <a href="Mössbauer_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">Mössbauer spectroscopy</a>.</p>

<p>In the Mössbauer effect the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type.</p>

<p>The emission and absorption of <a href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-rays</a> by gases had been observed previously, and it was expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma rays</a>, which are created by <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">nuclear</a> transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electronic</a> transitions). However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma-rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the <a href="Doppler_effect" title="wikilink">Doppler effect</a> also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum). Mössbauer was able to observe resonance in nuclei of solid <a class="uri" href="iridium" title="wikilink">iridium</a>, which raised the question of why gamma-ray resonance was possible in solids, but not in gases. Mössbauer proposed that, for the case of atoms bound into a solid, under certain circumstances a fraction of the nuclear events could occur essentially without recoil. He attributed the observed resonance to this recoil-free fraction of nuclear events.</p>

<p>The Mössbauer effect was one of the last major discoveries in physics to be originally reported in the German language. The first report in English was a letter describing a repetition of the experiment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The discovery was rewarded with the <a href="Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1961 together with <a href="Robert_Hofstadter" title="wikilink">Robert Hofstadter</a>'s research of <a href="electron_scattering" title="wikilink">electron scattering</a> in atomic nuclei.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p> The Mössbauer Effect is a process in which a nucleus emits or absorbs gamma rays without loss of energy to a nuclear recoil. It was discovered by the German physicist Rudolf L. Mössbauer in 1958 and has proved to be remarkably useful for basic research in physics and chemistry. It has been used, for instance, in precisely measuring small energy changes in nuclei, atoms, and crystals induced by electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields. In a transition of a nucleus from a higher to a lower energy state with accompanying emission of gamma rays, the emission generally causes the nucleus to recoil, and this takes energy from the emitted gamma rays. Thus the gamma rays do not have sufficient energy to excite a target nucleus to be examined. However, Mössbauer discovered that it is possible to have transitions in which the recoil is absorbed by a whole crystal in which the emitting nucleus is bound. Under these circumstances, the energy that goes into the recoil is a negligible portion of the energy of the transition. Therefore the emitted gamma rays carry virtually all of the energy liberated by the nuclear transition. The gamma rays thus are able to induce a reverse transition, under similar conditions of negligible recoil, in a target nucleus of the same material as the emitter but in a lower energy state. In general, gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions from an unstable high-energy state, to a stable low-energy state. The energy of the emitted gamma ray corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, minus an amount of energy that is lost as recoil to the emitting atom. If the lost "recoil energy" is small compared with the energy <a class="uri" href="linewidth" title="wikilink">linewidth</a> of the nuclear transition, then the gamma ray energy still corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, and the gamma ray can be absorbed by a second atom of the same type as the first. This emission and subsequent absorption is called <a href="resonance" title="wikilink">resonant</a> <a class="uri" href="fluorescence" title="wikilink">fluorescence</a>. Additional recoil energy is also lost during absorption, so in order for resonance to occur the recoil energy must actually be less than half the linewidth for the corresponding nuclear transition.</p>

<p>The amount of energy in the recoiling body (<mtpl></mtpl>) can be found from momentum conservation:</p>

(Note that the same equation applies for recoil energy losses in x-rays, but the photon energy is much less, resulting in a lower energy loss, which is why gas-phase resonance could be observed with x-rays.)</p>

<p>In a solid, the nuclei are bound to the lattice and do not recoil in the same way as in a gas. The lattice as a whole recoils but the recoil energy is negligible because the

 in the above equation is the mass of the whole lattice. However, the energy in a decay can be taken up or supplied by lattice vibrations. The energy of these vibrations is quantised in units known as <em>phonons</em>. The Mössbauer effect occurs because there is a finite probability of a decay occurring involving no phonons. Thus in a fraction of the nuclear events (the <strong>recoil-free fraction</strong>, given by the <a href="Lamb–Mössbauer_factor" title="wikilink">Lamb–Mössbauer factor</a>), the entire crystal acts as the recoiling body, and these events are essentially recoil-free. In these cases, since the recoil energy is negligible, the emitted gamma rays have the appropriate energy and resonance can occur.</p>

<p>In general (depending on the half-life of the decay), gamma rays have very narrow linewidths. This means they are very sensitive to small changes in the energies of nuclear transitions. In fact, gamma rays can be used as a probe to observe the effects of interactions between a nucleus and its electrons and those of its neighbors. This is the basis for Mössbauer spectroscopy, which combines the Mössbauer effect with the <a href="Doppler_effect" title="wikilink">Doppler effect</a> to monitor such interactions.</p>

<p><a href="Zero-phonon_line_and_phonon_sideband" title="wikilink">Zero-phonon optical transitions</a>, a process closely analogous to the Mössbauer effect, can be observed in lattice-bound <a href="chromophore" title="wikilink">chromophores</a> at low temperatures.</p>
