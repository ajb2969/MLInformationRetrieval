<h1>Copenhagen interpretation</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Copenhagen interpretation</strong> is a loosely-knit informal collection of axioms or doctrines that attempt to express in everyday language the mathematical formalism of <a href="interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>. The interpretation was largely devised in the years 1925–1927 by <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a>. It is fundamental to the Copenhagen interpretation that the results of experiments must be reported in ordinary language, not relying on arcane terminology or words that refer only to clusters of mathematical symbols.</p>

<p>The fundamental axiom of the Copenhagen interpretation is the "postulate of the quantum", that subatomic events are only perceptible as <a href="indeterminism" title="wikilink">indeterministic</a> physically discontinuous transitions between discrete <a href="stationary_state" title="wikilink">stationary states</a>. Various consequences are inferred from this postulate of unpredictable physical discontinuity.</p>

<p>Another axiom is that incompatible <a href="conjugate_variables" title="wikilink">conjugate properties</a> cannot be measured with arbitrary precision at the same time. This is expressed in detail as Heisenberg's <a href="uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">uncertainty principle</a>.</p>

<p>A major reason why interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism is needed is that such interpretation provides an account in general not separable in time and space, because the domain of the wave function (the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics) is configuration space (a schematic description), not the "real" physical space–time familiar to the human mind.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Copenhagen interpretation also attempts to reconcile the <a href="wave–particle_duality" title="wikilink">apparent dualism of "wave" and "particle"</a> in a fashion suitable to human understanding.</p>

<p>The presence in daily language of the term 'quantum leap' bears witness to the extent to which the concept of the quantum has penetrated the popular mind.</p>

<p>There have been many objections to the Copenhagen Interpretation over the years. Some have objected to the discontinuous jumps when there is an observation, or the probabilistic element that is introduced upon observation. Others have objected to the subjectiveness of requiring an observer, the difficulty of defining a measuring device, or persistence of classical physics to describe the "laboratory" in which the results are measured. Others have observed that there is little consensus as to the physical meaning of <a href="wave–particle_duality" title="wikilink">wave–particle duality</a>. Some researchers aspire (controversially) to call into question whether incompatible conjugate properties (e.g., momentum and position) can indeed never be defined for the same time. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">Alternatives</a> to the Copenhagen Interpretation include the <a href="many-worlds_interpretation" title="wikilink">many-worlds interpretation</a>, the <a href="De_Broglie-Bohm_theory" title="wikilink">De Broglie-Bohm (pilot-wave) interpretation</a>, and <a href="quantum_decoherence" title="wikilink">quantum decoherence</a> theories.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In the early work of <a href="Max_Planck" title="wikilink">Max Planck</a>, <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a>, and <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a>, the occurrence of energy in discrete quantities was postulated in order to explain phenomena such as the spectrum of <a href="black-body_radiation" title="wikilink">black-body radiation</a>, the <a href="photoelectric_effect" title="wikilink">photoelectric effect</a>, and the stability and <a class="uri" href="spectrum" title="wikilink">spectrum</a> of atoms. These phenomena had eluded explanation by classical physics and even appeared to be in contradiction with it. While elementary particles show predictable properties in many experiments, they become thoroughly unpredictable in others, such as attempts to identify individual particle trajectories through a simple physical apparatus.</p>

<p><a href="Classical_physics" title="wikilink">Classical physics</a> draws a distinction between particles and waves. It also relies on continuity, and on determinism, in natural phenomena. In the early twentieth century, newly discovered atomic and subatomic phenomena seemed to defy those conceptions. In 1925–1926, quantum mechanics was invented as a mathematical formalism that accurately describes the experiments, yet appears to reject those classical conceptions. Instead, it posits that probability, and discontinuity, are fundamental in the physical world. Classical physics also relies on causality. The standing of causality for quantum mechanics is disputed.</p>

<p>Quantum mechanics cannot easily be reconciled with everyday language and observation. Its interpretation has often seemed counter-intuitive to physicists, including its inventors.</p>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="Copenhagen" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a> interpretation intends to indicate the proper ways of thinking and speaking about the physical meaning of the <a class="uri" href="mathematical" title="wikilink">mathematical</a> formulations of quantum mechanics and the corresponding experimental results. It offers due respect to discontinuity, probability, and a conception of wave–particle dualism. In some respects, it denies standing to causality.</p>
<h2 id="origin-of-the-term">Origin of the term</h2>

<p><a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a> had been an assistant to <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a> at <a href="Niels_Bohr_Institute" title="wikilink">his institute</a> in <a class="uri" href="Copenhagen" title="wikilink">Copenhagen</a> during part of the 1920s, when they helped originate quantum mechanical theory. In 1929, Heisenberg gave a series of invited lectures at the University of Chicago explaining the new field of quantum mechanics. The lectures then served as the basis for his textbook, <em><a href="The_Physical_Principles_of_the_Quantum_Theory" title="wikilink">The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory</a></em>, published in 1930.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the book's preface, Heisenberg wrote:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On the whole the book contains nothing that is not to be found in previous publications, particularly in the investigations of Bohr. The purpose of the book seems to me to be fulfilled if it contributes somewhat to the diffusion of that 'Kopenhagener Geist der Quantentheorie' [i.e., Copenhagen spirit of quantum theory] if I may so express myself, which has directed the entire development of modern atomic physics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term 'Copenhagen interpretation' suggests something more than just a spirit, such as some definite set of rules for interpreting the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, presumably dating back to the 1920s. However, no such text exists, apart from some informal popular lectures by Bohr and Heisenberg, which contradict each other on several important issues. It appears that the particular term, with its more definite sense, was coined by Heisenberg in the 1950s,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> while criticizing alternate "interpretations" (e.g., <a href="David_Bohm" title="wikilink">David Bohm</a>'s<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>) that had been developed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Lectures with the titles 'The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory' and 'Criticisms and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation', that Heisenberg delivered in 1955, are reprinted in the collection <em>Physics and Philosophy</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Before the book was released for sale, Heisenberg privately expressed regret for having used the term, due to its suggestion of the existence of other interpretations, that he considered to be "nonsense".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="current-status-of-the-term">Current status of the term</h2>

<p>According to an opponent of the Copenhagen interpretation, <a href="John_G._Cramer" title="wikilink">John G. Cramer</a>, "Despite an extensive literature which refers to, discusses, and criticizes the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, nowhere does there seem to be any concise statement which defines the full Copenhagen interpretation."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<p>Because it consists of the views developed by a number of scientists and philosophers during the second quarter of the 20th Century, there is no uniquely definitive statement of the Copenhagen interpretation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Moreover, by different commentators and researchers, various ideas have been associated with it; <a href="Asher_Peres" title="wikilink">Asher Peres</a> remarked that very different, sometimes opposite, views are presented as "the Copenhagen interpretation" by different authors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Nonetheless, there are several basic principles that are generally accepted as being part of the interpretation:</p>

</math>

</a> represents the <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">state</a> of the system. It exhausts what can be known in advance of an observation, about a particular occasion of occurrence of a system, and beyond it there are no "hidden parameters".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> While it is isolated from other systems, it evolves smoothly in time, but is unobservable.</li>
<li>The properties of the system, as represented in the wave function, and in physical actuality, are subject to a principle of incompatibility. The properties occur in conjugate pairs, which cannot be jointly defined for the same time and place. The incompatibility is expressed quantitatively by <a href="Heisenberg's_uncertainty_principle" title="wikilink">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a>. For example, if a particle at a particular instant has a particular definite location, it is meaningless to speak of its momentum at that instant.</li>
<li>For a quantum phenomenon,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> or occasion of <a href="Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">observation</a>, the system must interact with a laboratory device. When that device is suitably constructed, for example containing a birefringent crystal, the wave function is said to <a href="wave_function_collapse" title="wikilink">collapse, or irreversibly reduce</a> to an <a href="Introduction_to_eigenstates" title="wikilink">eigenstate</a>, also called a pure case, of the <a class="uri" href="observable" title="wikilink">observable</a> that is registered.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>
<li>The registrations provided by observing devices are essentially classical, and must be described in ordinary language. If the device is suitably constructed, its output registration makes fair sense in terms of classical physics, and consequently the ordinary language description is intelligible and useful in physics. This was particularly emphasized by Bohr, and was accepted by Heisenberg.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
<li>A pure case wave function may be considered as a coherent superposition of other compatible pure case wave functions. This can for example describe the passage of the quantal system through a smooth classical magnetic field. Incompatible wave functions cannot be superposed.</li>
<li>There is a distinction between an atomic or subatomic or quantal system on the one hand, and a laboratory-scale observing device on the other. For an observation, a particular such device must be chosen, and the quantal system must then interact with it. For example, a device might test position. A different device would be needed to test momentum. One and the same device can be used, on different occasions, to test different quantal systems, and one and the same quantal system can be tested, on different occasions, with different devices. This is implicit, for example, in the discussions offered by Bohr.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
<li>Different wave functions can be linked in a so-called tensor product. If the observing apparatus is considered in isolation, and in a quantum mechanical picture, it has its own wave function, separate from and incoherent with that of the quantal system that is being tested. In this case, when the device and the quantal system are made to interact, then two incoherent wave functions are brought into a new joint system, that needs a jointly coherent wave function, which is the tensor product.</li>
<li>The description given by the wave function is probabilistic. This principle is called the <a href="Born_rule" title="wikilink">Born rule</a>, after <a href="Max_Born" title="wikilink">Max Born</a>.</li>
<li>The wave function expresses a necessary and fundamental <a href="wave–particle_duality" title="wikilink">wave–particle duality</a>. This should be reflected in ordinary language accounts of experiments. An experiment can show particle-like properties, or wave-like properties, according to the <a href="complementarity_principle" title="wikilink">complementarity principle</a> of <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></li>
<li>The interpretation asserts that the inner workings of atomic and subatomic processes are necessarily and essentially inaccessible to direct observation. They are not open to visualization in ordinary space–time or causal pictures. There are also limitations on the visualizability of interactions between atomic and subatomic entities on the one hand and macroscopic apparatus on the other. This is the fundamental reason why quantum mechanics is needed to replace the old quantum theory. It is a key concept of quantum theory, expressed in quantum mechanics by the non-separable characteristic of the wave function, that its domain is configuration space, not ordinary physical space–time.</li>
<li>When quantum numbers are large, they refer to properties which closely match those of the classical description. This is the <a href="correspondence_principle" title="wikilink">correspondence principle</a> of Bohr and Heisenberg.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="metaphysics-of-the-wave-function">Metaphysics of the wave function</h2>

<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation denies that the wave function is anything more than a theoretical concept, or is at least noncommittal about its being a discrete entity or a discernible component of some discrete entity.</p>

<p>The <strong>subjective</strong> view, that the wave function is merely a mathematical tool for calculating the probabilities in a specific experiment, has some similarities to the <a href="ensemble_interpretation" title="wikilink">ensemble interpretation</a> in that it takes probabilities to be the essence of the quantum state, but unlike the ensemble interpretation, it takes these probabilities to be perfectly applicable to single experimental outcomes, as it interprets them in terms of <a href="subjective_probability" title="wikilink">subjective probability</a>.</p>

<p>There are some who say that there are <strong>objective</strong> variants of the Copenhagen Interpretation that allow for a "real" wave function, but it is questionable whether that view is really <a class="uri" href="consistent" title="wikilink">consistent</a> with some of Bohr's statements. Bohr emphasized that science is concerned with predictions of the outcomes of experiments, and that any additional propositions offered are not scientific but metaphysical. Some authors have proposed that Bohr was influenced by <a class="uri" href="positivism" title="wikilink">positivism</a> (or even <a class="uri" href="pragmatism" title="wikilink">pragmatism</a>). On the other hand, Bohr and Heisenberg were not in complete agreement, and they held different views at different times. Heisenberg in particular was prompted to move towards <a href="Philosophical_realism" title="wikilink">realism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Even if the wave function is not regarded as real, there is still a divide between those who treat it as definitely and entirely subjective, and those who are noncommittal or agnostic about the subject. An example of the <a href="agnosticism" title="wikilink">agnostic view</a> is given by <a href="Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizsäcker" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker</a>, who, while participating in a colloquium at Cambridge, denied that the Copenhagen interpretation asserted "What cannot be observed does not exist." He suggested instead that the Copenhagen interpretation follows the principle "What is observed certainly exists; about what is not observed we are still free to make suitable assumptions. We use that freedom to avoid paradoxes."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="born-rule">Born rule</h2>

<p>Max Born speaks of his probability interpretation as a "statistical interpretation" of the wave function,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and the Born rule is essential to the Copenhagen interpretation. But writers do not all follow the same terminology.</p>

<p>The phrase 'statistical interpretation' often indicates an interpretation of the Born rule somewhat different from the Copenhagen interpretation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> For the Copenhagen interpretation, it is axiomatic that the wave function exhausts all that can ever be known in advance about a particular occurrence of the system. The 'statistical' or 'ensemble' interpretation, on the other hand, is explicitly agnostic about whether the information in the wave function is exhaustive of what might be known in advance. It sees itself as more 'minimal' than the Copenhagen interpretation in its claims. It only goes as far as saying that on every occasion of observation, some actual value of some property is found, and that such values are found probabilistically, as detected by many occasions of observation of the same system. The many occurrences of the system are said to constitute an 'ensemble', and they jointly reveal the probability through these occasions of observation. Though they all have the same wave function, the elements of the ensemble might not be identical to one another in all respects, according to the 'agnostic' interpretations. They may, for all we know, beyond current knowledge and beyond the wave function, have individual distinguishing properties. For present-day science, the experimental significance of these various forms of Born's rule is the same, since they make the same predictions about the probability distribution of outcomes of observations, and the unobserved or unactualized potential properties are not accessible to experiment.</p>
<h2 id="nature-of-collapse">Nature of collapse</h2>

<p>Those who hold to the Copenhagen interpretation are willing to say that a wave function involves the various probabilities that a given event will proceed to certain different outcomes. But when the apparatus registers one of those outcomes, no probabilities or <a href="quantum_superposition" title="wikilink">superposition</a> of the others linger.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Howard, wave function collapse is not mentioned in the writings of Bohr.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Some argue that the concept of the collapse of a "real" wave function was introduced by Heisenberg and later developed by <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">John von Neumann</a> in 1932.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> However, Heisenberg spoke of the wavefunction as representing available knowledge of a system, and did not use the term "collapse" per se, but instead termed it "reduction" of the wavefunction to a new state representing the change in available knowledge which occurs once a particular phenomenon is registered by the apparatus (often called "measurement").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1952 <a href="David_Bohm" title="wikilink">David Bohm</a> developed <a class="uri" href="decoherence" title="wikilink">decoherence</a>, an <em>explanatory mechanism</em> for the <em>appearance</em> of wave function collapse. Bohm applied decoherence to <a href="Louis_DeBroglie" title="wikilink">Louis DeBroglie</a>'s <a href="pilot_wave" title="wikilink">pilot wave</a> theory, producing <a href="Bohmian_mechanics" title="wikilink">Bohmian mechanics</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> the first successful hidden variables interpretation of quantum mechanics. Decoherence was then used by <a href="Hugh_Everett" title="wikilink">Hugh Everett</a> in 1957 to form the core of his <a href="many-worlds_interpretation" title="wikilink">many-worlds interpretation</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> However decoherence was largely<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> ignored until the 1980s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="non-separability-of-the-wave-function">Non-separability of the wave function</h2>

<p>The domain of the wave function is configuration space, an abstract object quite different from ordinary physical space–time. At a single "point" of configuration space, the wave function collects probabilistic information about several distinct particles, that respectively have physically space-like separation. So the wave function is said to supply a non-separable representation. This reflects a feature of the quantum world that was recognized by Einstein as early as 1905.</p>

<p>In 1927, Bohr drew attention to a consequence of non-separability. The evolution of the system, as determined by the Schrödinger equation, does not display particle trajectories through space–time. It is possible to extract trajectory information from such evolution, but not simultaneously to extract energy–momentum information. This incompatibility is expressed in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The two kinds of information have to be extracted on different occasions, because of the non-separability of the wave function representation. In Bohr's thinking, space–time visualizability meant trajectory information. Again, in Bohr's thinking, 'causality' referred to energy–momentum transfer; in his view, lack of energy–momentum knowledge meant lack of 'causality' knowledge. Therefore Bohr thought that knowledge respectively of 'causality' and of space–time visualizability were incompatible but complementary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="waveparticle-dilemma">Wave–particle dilemma</h2>

<p>The term 'Copenhagen interpretation' was, it seems, invented by Heisenberg in 1955. It is often assumed that the 'Copenhagen interpretation' was agreed between Bohr and Heisenberg, with perhaps Born included. The term Copenhagen interpretation, however, is not well defined when one asks about the wave–particle dilemma, because Bohr and Heisenberg had different or perhaps disagreeing views on it. Which was the true 'Copenhagenist'? Which is the true 'Copenhagen' position on this? What is the true "orthodoxy"?</p>

<p>According to Camilleri, Bohr thought that the distinction between a wave view and a particle view was defined by a distinction between experimental setups, while, differing, Heisenberg thought that it was defined by the possibility of viewing the mathematical formulas as referring to waves or particles. Bohr thought that a particular experimental setup would display either a wave picture or a particle picture, but not both. Heisenberg thought that every mathematical formulation was capable of both wave and particle interpretations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Looking at it slightly differently, Heisenberg's view was about quantum field theory. Thus one is left in a dilemma to know whether the 'Copenhagen interpretation' is the one of Bohr (one or the other) or the one of Heisenberg (always both).</p>

<p><a href="Alfred_Landé" title="wikilink">Alfred Landé</a> was for a long time considered orthodox. He did, however, take the Heisenberg viewpoint, in so far as he thought that the wave function was always mathematically open to both interpretations. Eventually this led to his being considered unorthodox, partly because he did not accept Bohr's one-or-the-other view, preferring Heisenberg's always-both view. Another part of the reason for branding Landé unorthodox was that he recited, as did Heisenberg, the <a href="Quantal_translative_momentum_transfer" title="wikilink">1923 work</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> of old-quantum-theorist <a href="William_Duane_(physicist)" title="wikilink">William Duane</a>, which anticipated a quantum mechanical theorem that had not been recognized by Born. That theorem seems to make the always-both view, like the one adopted by Heisenberg, rather cogent. One might say "It's there in the mathematics", but that is not a physical statement that would have convinced Bohr. Perhaps the main reason for attacking Landé is that his work demystified the phenomenon of diffraction of particles of matter, such as buckyballs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="acceptance-among-physicists">Acceptance among physicists</h2>

<p>Throughout much of the twentieth century the Copenhagen interpretation had overwhelming acceptance among physicists. Although astrophysicist and science writer <a href="John_Gribbin" title="wikilink">John Gribbin</a> described it as having fallen from primacy after the 1980s,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> according to a poll conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 1997,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> the Copenhagen interpretation remained the most widely accepted specific interpretation of quantum mechanics among physicists. In more recent polls conducted at various quantum mechanics conferences, varying results have been found.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Often, as is the case with the 4 referenced sources, the acceptance of the Copenhagen interpretation as the preferred view of the underlying nature was below 50% amongst the surveyed.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>The nature of the Copenhagen Interpretation is exposed by considering a number of experiments and paradoxes.</p>

<dd>This <a href="thought_experiment" title="wikilink">thought experiment</a> highlights the implications that accepting uncertainty at the microscopic level has on macroscopic objects. A cat is put in a sealed box, with its life or death made dependent on the state of a subatomic particle. Thus a description of the cat during the course of the experiment—having been entangled with the state of a subatomic particle—becomes a "blur" of "living and dead cat." But this can't be accurate because it implies the cat is actually both dead and alive until the box is opened to check on it. But the cat, if it survives, will only remember being alive. Schrödinger resists "so naively accepting as valid a 'blurred model' for representing reality."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> <em>How can the cat be both alive and dead?</em>

<dl>
<dd>Entangled "particles" are emitted in a single event. Conservation laws ensure that the measured spin of one particle must be the opposite of the measured spin of the other, so that if the spin of one particle is measured, the spin of the other particle is now instantaneously known. The most discomforting aspect of this paradox is that the effect is instantaneous so that something that happens in one galaxy could cause an instantaneous change in another galaxy. But, according to <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a>'s theory of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>, no information-bearing signal or entity can travel at or faster than the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>, which is finite. Thus, it seems as if the Copenhagen interpretation is inconsistent with special relativity.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><u>The Copenhagen Interpretation</u>: Assuming wave functions are not real, wave-function collapse is interpreted subjectively. The moment one observer measures the spin of one particle, he knows the spin of the other. However, another observer cannot benefit until the results of that measurement have been relayed to him, at less than or equal to the speed of light.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Copenhagenists claim that interpretations of quantum mechanics where the wave function is regarded as real have problems with EPR-type effects, since they imply that the laws of physics allow for influences to propagate at speeds greater than the speed of light. However, proponents of <a href="many_worlds" title="wikilink">many worlds</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and the <a href="transactional_interpretation" title="wikilink">transactional interpretation</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> (TI) maintain that Copenhagen interpretation is fatally non-local.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The claim that EPR effects violate the principle that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light have been countered by noting that they cannot be used for signaling because neither observer can control, or predetermine, what he observes, and therefore cannot manipulate what the other observer measures. However, this is a somewhat spurious argument, in that the speed of light limitation applies to all information, not to what can or cannot be subsequently done with the information. On the other hand, the special theory of relativity contains no notion of information at all. The fact that no classical body can exceed the speed of light (no matter how much acceleration is applied) is a consequence of classical relativistic mechanics. As the correlation between the two particles in an EPR experiment is most probably not established by classical bodies or light signals, the displayed non-locality is not at odds with special relativity.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A further argument against Copenhagen interpretation is that relativistic difficulties about establishing which measurement occurred first or last, or whether they occurred quite at the same time, also undermine the idea that in "different" instants and measurements different outcomes can occur. The spin would be kept as a "constant" for a continuous interval of time, i.e. as a real <em>variable</em>, and thus it would seem to violate the general rule (of the classic Copenhagen interpretation) that every measurement gives nothing else than a random outcome subject to certain probabilities.

<p>The completeness of quantum mechanics (thesis 1) was attacked by the <a href="EPR_paradox" title="wikilink">Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen thought experiment</a> which was intended to show that quantum mechanics could not be a complete theory.</p>

<p><a href="bell_test_experiments" title="wikilink">Experimental tests of</a> <a href="Bell's_inequality" title="wikilink">Bell's inequality</a> using particles have supported the quantum mechanical prediction of entanglement.</p>

<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation gives special status to measurement processes without clearly defining them or explaining their peculiar effects. In his article entitled "Criticism and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory," countering the view of Alexandrov that (in Heisenberg's paraphrase) "the wave function in configuration space characterizes the objective state of the electron." Heisenberg says,</p>

<p>Many <a href="physicist" title="wikilink">physicists</a> and <a href="philosopher" title="wikilink">philosophers</a> have objected to the Copenhagen interpretation, both on the grounds that it is non-deterministic and that it includes an undefined measurement process that converts probability functions into non-probabilistic measurements. <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein's</a> comments "I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and "Do you really think the moon isn't there if you aren't looking at it?"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> exemplify this. Bohr, in response, said, "Einstein, don't tell God what to do."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Steven_Weinberg" title="wikilink">Steven Weinberg</a> in "Einstein's Mistakes", <em><a href="Physics_Today" title="wikilink">Physics Today</a></em>, November 2005, page 31, said:</p>

<p>The problem of thinking in terms of classical measurements of a quantum system becomes particularly acute in the field of <a href="quantum_cosmology" title="wikilink">quantum cosmology</a>, where the quantum system is the universe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="E._T._Jaynes" title="wikilink">E. T. Jaynes</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> from a Bayesian point of view, argued that probability is a measure of a state of information about the physical world. Quantum mechanics under the Copenhagen Interpretation interpreted probability as a physical phenomenon, which is what Jaynes called a Mind Projection Fallacy.</p>

<p>Common criticisms of the Copenhagen interpretation often lead to the problem of <a href="Cardinality_of_the_continuum" title="wikilink">continuum</a> of random occurrences: whether in time (as subsequent measurements, which under certain interpretations of the <a href="measurement_problem" title="wikilink">measurement problem</a> may happen continuously) or even in space. If such worldview is proved better – i.e. that a particle is in fact a continuum of points capable of acting independently but under a common wavefunction – it would support rather theories such as <a href="De_Broglie–Bohm_theory" title="wikilink">Bohm's one</a> (with its guiding towards the centre of orbital and spreading of physical properties over it) than interpretations which presuppose full randomness, because with the latter it will be problematic to demonstrate universally and in all practical cases how can a particle remain coherent in time, in spite of non-zero probabilities of its individual points going into regions distant from the centre of mass (through a continuum of different random determinations).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> An alternative possibility would be to assume that there is a finite number of instants/points within a given time or area, but theories which try to quantize the space or time itself seem to be fatally incompatible with the <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>.</p>

<p>The view that particle diffraction logically guarantees the need for a wave interpretation has been questioned. A recent experiment has carried out the two-slit protocol with helium atoms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> The basic physics of quantal momentum transfer considered here was originally pointed out in 1923, by <a href="William_Duane_(physicist)" title="wikilink">William Duane</a>, before quantum mechanics was invented.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> It was later recognized by <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Heisenberg</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> and by <a href="Linus_Pauling" title="wikilink">Pauling</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> It was championed against orthodox ridicule by <a href="Alfred_Landé" title="wikilink">Alfred Landé</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It has also recently been considered by <a href="Carolyne_Van_Vliet" title="wikilink">Van Vliet</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> If the diffracting slits are considered as classical objects, theoretically ideally seamless, then a wave interpretation seems necessary, but if the diffracting slits are considered physically, as quantal objects exhibiting collective quantal motions, then the particle-only and wave-only interpretations seem perhaps equally valid.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>The <a href="Ensemble_interpretation" title="wikilink">Ensemble interpretation</a> is similar; it offers an interpretation of the wave function, but not for single particles. The <a href="consistent_histories" title="wikilink">consistent histories</a> interpretation advertises itself as "Copenhagen done right". Although the Copenhagen interpretation is often confused with the idea that <a href="consciousness_causes_collapse" title="wikilink">consciousness causes collapse</a>, it defines an "observer" merely as that which collapses the wave function.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> <a href="Quantum_information" title="wikilink">Quantum information</a> theories are more recent, and have attracted growing support.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>Under <a href="Philosophical_realism" title="wikilink">realism</a> and <a class="uri" href="indeterminism" title="wikilink">indeterminism</a>, if the wave function is regarded as ontologically real, and collapse is entirely rejected, a <a href="many_worlds" title="wikilink">many worlds</a> theory results. If wave function collapse is regarded as ontologically real as well, an <a href="objective_collapse_theory" title="wikilink">objective collapse theory</a> is obtained. Under <a href="Philosophical_realism" title="wikilink">realism</a> and <a class="uri" href="determinism" title="wikilink">determinism</a> (as well as non-localism), a <a href="hidden_variable_theory" title="wikilink">hidden variable theory</a> exists, e.g., the <a href="De_Broglie–Bohm_theory" title="wikilink">de Broglie–Bohm interpretation</a>, which treats the wavefunction as real, position and momentum as definite and resulting from the expected values, and physical properties as spread in space. For an atemporal indeterministic interpretation that “makes no attempt to give a ‘local’ account on the level of determinate particles”,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> the conjugate wavefunction, ("advanced" or <a href="retrocausality" title="wikilink">time-reversed</a>) of the relativistic version of the wavefunction, and the so-called "retarded" or time-forward version<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> are both regarded as real and the <a href="transactional_interpretation" title="wikilink">transactional interpretation</a> results.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Many physicists have subscribed to the <a href="instrumentalism" title="wikilink">instrumentalist interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics, a position often equated with eschewing all interpretation.

("[The] determination of the position selects a definite "<em>q</em>" from the totality of possibilities and limits the options for all subsequent measurements. ... [T]he results of later measurements can only be calculated when one again ascribes to the electron a "smaller" wavepacket of extension λ (wavelength of the light used in the observation).

Paul Arthur Shilpp, Harper, 1949, p. 211: "...in spite of all divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit animated the discussions. On his side, Einstein mockingly asked us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities took recourse to dice-playing ("<em>ob der liebe Gott würfelt</em>"), to which I replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in everyday language." Werner Heisenberg, who also attended the congress, recalled the exchange in <em>Encounters with Einstein</em>, Princeton University Press, 1983, p. 117,: "But he [Einstein] still stood by his watchword, which he clothed in the words: 'God does not play at dice.' To which Bohr could only answer: 'But still, it cannot be for us to tell God, how he is to run the world.'"<a href="#fnref52">↩</a></li>
