<h1>Magnetism</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Magnetism</strong> is a class of physical phenomena that are mediated by <a href="magnetic_field" title="wikilink">magnetic fields</a>. Electric currents and the <a href="magnetic_moment" title="wikilink">magnetic moments</a> of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Every material is influenced to some extent by a magnetic field. The most familiar effect is on permanent <a href="magnet" title="wikilink">magnets</a>, which have persistent magnetic moments caused by <a class="uri" href="ferromagnetism" title="wikilink">ferromagnetism</a>. Most materials do not have permanent moments. Some are attracted to a magnetic field (<a class="uri" href="paramagnetism" title="wikilink">paramagnetism</a>); others are repulsed by a magnetic field (<a class="uri" href="diamagnetism" title="wikilink">diamagnetism</a>); others have a more complex relationship with an applied magnetic field (<a href="spin_glass" title="wikilink">spin glass</a> behavior and <a class="uri" href="antiferromagnetism" title="wikilink">antiferromagnetism</a>). Substances that are negligibly affected by magnetic fields are known as <em>non-magnetic</em> substances. These include <a class="uri" href="copper" title="wikilink">copper</a>, <a class="uri" href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminium</a>, <a class="uri" href="gases" title="wikilink">gases</a>, and <a class="uri" href="plastic" title="wikilink">plastic</a>. Pure <a class="uri" href="oxygen" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> exhibits magnetic properties when cooled to a <a class="uri" href="liquid" title="wikilink">liquid</a> state.</p>

<p>The magnetic state (or magnetic phase) of a material depends on temperature and other variables such as pressure and the applied magnetic field. A material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism as these variables change.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> attributed the first of what could be called a scientific discussion on magnetism to <a class="uri" href="Thales" title="wikilink">Thales</a> of <a class="uri" href="Miletus" title="wikilink">Miletus</a>, who lived from about 625 BC to about 545 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Around the same time, in <a href="History_of_India" title="wikilink">ancient India</a>, the <a href="Ayurveda" title="wikilink">Indian surgeon</a>, <a class="uri" href="Sushruta" title="wikilink">Sushruta</a>, was the first to make use of the magnet for surgical purposes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="History_of_China#Ancient_China" title="wikilink">ancient China</a>, the earliest literary reference to magnetism lies in a 4th-century BC book named after its author, <em>The Master of Demon Valley</em> (鬼谷子): "The <a class="uri" href="lodestone" title="wikilink">lodestone</a> makes iron come or it attracts it."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The earliest mention of the attraction of a needle appears in a work composed between AD 20 and 100 (<em>Louen-heng</em>): "A lodestone attracts a needle."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <a href="History_of_science_and_technology_in_China" title="wikilink">Chinese scientist</a> <a href="Shen_Kuo" title="wikilink">Shen Kuo</a> (1031–1095) was the first person to write of the magnetic needle compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the <a class="uri" href="astronomical" title="wikilink">astronomical</a> concept of <a href="true_north" title="wikilink">true north</a> <em>(<a href="Dream_Pool_Essays" title="wikilink">Dream Pool Essays</a></em>, AD 1088), and by the 12th century the Chinese were known to use the lodestone <a class="uri" href="compass" title="wikilink">compass</a> for navigation. They sculpted a directional spoon from lodestone in such a way that the handle of the spoon always pointed south.</p>

<p><a href="Alexander_Neckam" title="wikilink">Alexander Neckam</a>, by 1187, was the first in Europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation. In 1269, <a href="Peter_of_Maricourt" title="wikilink">Peter Peregrinus de Maricourt</a> wrote the <em>Epistola de magnete</em>, the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets. In 1282, the properties of magnets and the dry compass were discussed by Al-Ashraf, a <a href="Islamic_physics" title="wikilink">Yemeni physicist</a>, <a href="Islamic_astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomer</a>, and <a href="Islamic_geography" title="wikilink">geographer</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="File:M_Faraday_Th_Phillips_oil_1842.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=0.75|Michael Faraday, 1842</a></p>

<p>In 1600, <a href="William_Gilbert_(astronomer)" title="wikilink">William Gilbert</a> published his <em><a href="De_Magnete" title="wikilink">De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure</a></em> (<em>On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth</em>). In this work he describes many of his experiments with his model earth called the <a class="uri" href="terrella" title="wikilink">terrella</a>. From his experiments, he concluded that the <a href="Earth's_magnetic_field" title="wikilink">Earth</a> was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses pointed north (previously, some believed that it was the pole star (<a class="uri" href="Polaris" title="wikilink">Polaris</a>) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass).</p>

<p>An understanding of the relationship between <a class="uri" href="electricity" title="wikilink">electricity</a> and magnetism began in 1819 with work by <a href="Hans_Christian_Ørsted" title="wikilink">Hans Christian Ørsted</a>, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who discovered more or less by accident that an electric current could influence a compass needle. This landmark experiment is known as Ørsted's Experiment. Several other experiments followed, with <a href="André-Marie_Ampère" title="wikilink">André-Marie Ampère</a>, who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed-path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path; <a href="Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>; <a href="Jean-Baptiste_Biot" title="wikilink">Jean-Baptiste Biot</a> and <a href="Félix_Savart" title="wikilink">Félix Savart</a>, both of whom in 1820 came up with the <a href="Biot–Savart_law" title="wikilink">Biot–Savart law</a> giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire; <a href="Michael_Faraday" title="wikilink">Michael Faraday</a>, who in 1831 found that a time-varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage, and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity. <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a> synthesized and expanded these insights into <a href="Maxwell's_equations" title="wikilink">Maxwell's equations</a>, unifying electricity, magnetism, and <a class="uri" href="optics" title="wikilink">optics</a> into the field of <a class="uri" href="electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>. In 1905, <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a> used these laws in motivating his theory of <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">special relativity</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> requiring that the laws held true in all <a href="inertial_reference_frame" title="wikilink">inertial reference frames</a>.</p>

<p>Electromagnetism has continued to develop into the 21st century, being incorporated into the more fundamental theories of <a href="gauge_theory" title="wikilink">gauge theory</a>, <a href="quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum electrodynamics</a>, <a href="electroweak_theory" title="wikilink">electroweak theory</a>, and finally the <a href="standard_model" title="wikilink">standard model</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-magnetism">Sources of magnetism</h2>

<p>Magnetism, at its root, arises from two sources:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="Electric_current" title="wikilink">Electric current</a> (see <em><a href="Electron_magnetic_moment" title="wikilink">Electron magnetic moment</a></em>).</li>
<li><a href="Spin_magnetic_moment" title="wikilink">Spin magnetic moments</a> of <a href="elementary_particles" title="wikilink">elementary particles</a>. The magnetic moments of the nuclei of atoms are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons' magnetic moments, so they are negligible in the context of the magnetization of materials. Nuclear magnetic moments are very important in other contexts, particularly in <a href="nuclear_magnetic_resonance" title="wikilink">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> (NMR) and <a href="magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="wikilink">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI).</li>
</ol>

<p>Ordinarily, the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments (both orbital and intrinsic) cancel out. This is due, to some extent, to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments as a result of the <a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a> (see <em><a href="electron_configuration" title="wikilink">electron configuration</a></em>), or combining into filled <a href="electron_subshell" title="wikilink">subshells</a> with zero net orbital motion. In both cases, the electron arrangement is so as to exactly cancel the magnetic moments from each electron. Moreover, even when the <a href="electron_configuration" title="wikilink">electron configuration</a> <em>is</em> such that there are unpaired electrons and/or non-filled subshells, it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different, random directions, so that the material will not be magnetic.</p>

<p>However, sometimes—either spontaneously, or owing to an applied external magnetic field—each of the electron magnetic moments will be, on average, lined up. Then the material can produce a net total magnetic field, which can potentially be quite strong.</p>

<p>The magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure, particularly its <a href="electron_configuration" title="wikilink">electron configuration</a>, for the reasons mentioned above, and also on the temperature. At high temperatures, random <a href="thermal_motion" title="wikilink">thermal motion</a> makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment.</p>
<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p><a href="File:Magnetism.svg" title="wikilink">thumb|center|upright=2.7|Hierarchy of types of magnetism.</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="diamagnetism">Diamagnetism</h3>

<p>Diamagnetism appears in all materials, and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field, and therefore, to be repelled by a magnetic field. However, in a material with paramagnetic properties (that is, with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field), the paramagnetic behavior dominates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Thus, despite its universal occurrence, diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material. In a diamagnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect. In these cases, the magnetization arises from the electrons' orbital motions, which can be understood <a href="classical_physics" title="wikilink">classically</a> as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When a material is put in a magnetic field, the electrons circling the nucleus will experience, in addition to their <a href="Coulomb's_law" title="wikilink">Coulomb</a> attraction to the nucleus, a <a href="Lorentz_force" title="wikilink">Lorentz force</a> from the magnetic field. Depending on which direction the electron is orbiting, this force may increase the <a href="centripetal_force" title="wikilink">centripetal force</a> on the electrons, pulling them in towards the nucleus, or it may decrease the force, pulling them away from the nucleus. This effect systematically increases the orbital magnetic moments that were aligned opposite the field, and decreases the ones aligned parallel to the field (in accordance with <a href="Lenz's_law" title="wikilink">Lenz's law</a>). This results in a small bulk magnetic moment, with an opposite direction to the applied field.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that this description is meant only as an <a class="uri" href="heuristic" title="wikilink">heuristic</a>; a proper understanding requires a <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum-mechanical</a> description.</p>

<p>Note that all materials undergo this orbital response. However, in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, the diamagnetic effect is overwhelmed by the much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons.</p>
<h3 id="paramagnetism">Paramagnetism</h3>

<p>In a paramagnetic material there are <em>unpaired electrons</em>, i.e. <a href="atomic_orbital" title="wikilink">atomic</a> or <a href="molecular_orbital" title="wikilink">molecular orbitals</a> with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons are required by the <a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a> to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field, thus reinforcing it.</p>
<h3 id="ferromagnetism">Ferromagnetism</h3>

<p><a href="File:Ferromagneses_penzermek_1.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=0.9|A permanent magnet holding up several coins</a>  A ferromagnet, like a paramagnetic substance, has unpaired electrons. However, in <em>addition</em> to the electrons' intrinsic magnetic moment's tendency to be parallel to an <em>applied field</em>, there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to <em>each other</em> to maintain a lowered-energy state. Thus, even in the absence of an applied field, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another.</p>

<p>Every ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature, called the <a href="Curie_temperature" title="wikilink">Curie temperature</a>, or Curie point, above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties. This is because the thermal tendency to disorder overwhelms the energy-lowering due to ferromagnetic order.</p>

<p>Ferromagnetism only occurs in a few substances; the common ones are <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a>, <a class="uri" href="nickel" title="wikilink">nickel</a>, <a class="uri" href="cobalt" title="wikilink">cobalt</a>, their <a href="alloy" title="wikilink">alloys</a>, and some alloys of <a href="rare_earth_element" title="wikilink">rare earth</a> metals.</p>
<h4 id="magnetic-domains">Magnetic domains</h4>

<p>  The magnetic moments of atoms in a <a href="Ferromagnetism" title="wikilink">ferromagnetic</a> material cause them to behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called <a href="magnetic_domains" title="wikilink">magnetic domains</a> or <a href="Weiss_domains" title="wikilink">Weiss domains</a>. Magnetic domains can be observed with a <a href="magnetic_force_microscope" title="wikilink">magnetic force microscope</a> to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.</p>

<p>When a domain contains too many molecules, it becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned in opposite directions so that they stick together more stably as shown at the right.</p>

<p>When exposed to a magnetic field, the domain boundaries move so that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure (dotted yellow area) as shown at the left. When the magnetizing field is removed, the domains may not return to an unmagnetized state. This results in the ferromagnetic material's being magnetized, forming a permanent magnet.</p>

<p>When magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain, the material is <a href="Saturation_(magnetic)" title="wikilink">magnetically saturated</a>. When a magnetized ferromagnetic material is heated to the <a href="Curie_point" title="wikilink">Curie point</a> temperature, the molecules are agitated to the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization and the magnetic properties they cause cease. When the material is cooled, this domain alignment structure spontaneously returns, in a manner roughly analogous to how a liquid can <a href="freezing" title="wikilink">freeze</a> into a crystalline solid.</p>
<h3 id="antiferromagnetism">Antiferromagnetism</h3>

<p>  In an antiferromagnet, unlike a ferromagnet, there is a tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in <em>opposite</em> directions. When all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is 'anti-aligned', the substance is <strong>antiferromagnetic</strong>. Antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment, meaning no field is produced by them. Antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors, and are mostly observed at low temperatures. In varying temperatures, antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic properties.</p>

<p>In some materials, neighboring electrons want to point in opposite directions, but there is no geometrical arrangement in which <em>each</em> pair of neighbors is anti-aligned. This is called a <a href="spin_glass" title="wikilink">spin glass</a>, and is an example of <a href="geometrical_frustration" title="wikilink">geometrical frustration</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ferrimagnetism">Ferrimagnetism</h3>

<p>  Like ferromagnetism, <strong>ferrimagnets</strong> retain their magnetization in the absence of a field. However, like antiferromagnets, neighboring pairs of electron spins like to point in opposite directions. These two properties are not contradictory, because in the optimal geometrical arrangement, there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction, than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Most <a href="Ferrite_(magnet)" title="wikilink">ferrites</a> are ferrimagnetic. The first discovered magnetic substance, <a class="uri" href="magnetite" title="wikilink">magnetite</a>, is a ferrite and was originally believed to be a ferromagnet; <a href="Louis_Néel" title="wikilink">Louis Néel</a> disproved this, however, after discovering ferrimagnetism.</p>
<h3 id="superparamagnetism">Superparamagnetism</h3>

<p>When a ferromagnet or ferrimagnet is sufficiently small, it acts like a single magnetic spin that is subject to <a href="Brownian_motion" title="wikilink">Brownian motion</a>. Its response to a magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the response of a paramagnet, but much larger.</p>

<h2 id="electromagnet">Electromagnet</h2>

<p> An <em><a class="uri" href="electromagnet" title="wikilink">electromagnet</a></em> is a type of <a class="uri" href="magnet" title="wikilink">magnet</a> whose magnetism is produced by the flow of electric <a href="Current_(electricity)" title="wikilink">current</a>. The magnetic field disappears when the current ceases.</p>
<h2 id="magnetism-electricity-and-special-relativity">Magnetism, electricity, and special relativity</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Magnetism from length-contraction.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity, electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked. Both magnetism lacking electricity, and electricity without magnetism, are inconsistent with special relativity, due to such effects as <a href="length_contraction" title="wikilink">length contraction</a>, <a href="time_dilation" title="wikilink">time dilation</a>, and the fact that the <a href="magnetic_force" title="wikilink">magnetic force</a> is velocity-dependent. However, when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account, the resulting theory (electromagnetism) is fully consistent with special relativity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In particular, a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another, or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference. Thus, special relativity "mixes" electricity and magnetism into a single, inseparable phenomenon called electromagnetism, analogous to how relativity "mixes" space and time into <a class="uri" href="spacetime" title="wikilink">spacetime</a>.</p>

<p>All observations on electromagnetism apply to what might be considered to be primarily magnetism, e.g. perturbations in the magnetic field are necessarily accompanied by a nonzero electric field, and propagate at the <a href="speed_of_light" title="wikilink">speed of light</a>.</p>

<h2 id="magnetic-force">Magnetic force</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The phenomenon of magnetism is "mediated" by the magnetic field. An electric current or magnetic dipole creates a magnetic field, and that field, in turn, imparts magnetic forces on other particles that are in the fields.</p>

<p>Maxwell's equations, which simplify to the <a href="Biot–Savart_law" title="wikilink">Biot–Savart law</a> in the case of steady currents, describe the origin and behavior of the fields that govern these forces. Therefore magnetism is seen whenever electrically <a href="electric_charge" title="wikilink">charged particles</a> are in <a href="Motion_(physics)" title="wikilink">motion</a>—for example, from movement of electrons in an <a href="electric_current" title="wikilink">electric current</a>, or in certain cases from the orbital motion of electrons around an atom's nucleus. They also arise from "intrinsic" <a href="magnetic_dipole" title="wikilink">magnetic dipoles</a> arising from quantum-mechanical <a href="Spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a>.</p>

<p>The same situations that create magnetic fields—charge moving in a current or in an atom, and intrinsic magnetic dipoles—are also the situations in which a magnetic field has an effect, creating a force. Following is the formula for moving charge; for the forces on an intrinsic dipole, see magnetic dipole.</p>

<p>When a charged particle moves through a <a href="Magnetic_field#B_and_H" title="wikilink">magnetic field</a> <strong>B</strong>, it feels a <a href="Lorentz_force" title="wikilink">Lorentz force</a> <strong>F</strong> given by the <a href="cross_product" title="wikilink">cross product</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="magnetic-dipoles">Magnetic dipoles</h2>

<p>A very common source of magnetic field shown in nature is a <a class="uri" href="dipole" title="wikilink">dipole</a>, with a "<a href="South_pole" title="wikilink">South pole</a>" and a "<a href="North_pole" title="wikilink">North pole</a>", terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses, interacting with the <a href="Earth's_magnetic_field" title="wikilink">Earth's magnetic field</a> to indicate North and South on the <a class="uri" href="globe" title="wikilink">globe</a>. Since opposite ends of magnets are attracted, the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet. The Earth's <a href="North_Magnetic_Pole" title="wikilink">North Magnetic Pole</a> (currently in the Arctic Ocean, north of Canada) is physically a south pole, as it attracts the north pole of a compass. A magnetic field contains <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a>, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, a <em>magnetic dipole</em> tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.</p>
<h3 id="magnetic-monopoles">Magnetic monopoles</h3>

<p>Since a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar, when a bar magnet is cut in half, each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet. Even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole, these two poles cannot be separated from each other. A monopole—if such a thing exists—would be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object. It would act as an isolated north pole, not attached to a south pole, or vice versa. Monopoles would carry "magnetic charge" analogous to electric charge. Despite systematic searches since 1931, , they have never been observed, and could very well not exist.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, some <a href="theoretical_physics" title="wikilink">theoretical physics</a> models predict the existence of these <a href="magnetic_monopoles" title="wikilink">magnetic monopoles</a>. <a href="Paul_Dirac" title="wikilink">Paul Dirac</a> observed in 1931 that, because electricity and magnetism show a certain <a class="uri" href="symmetry" title="wikilink">symmetry</a>, just as <a href="Quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum theory</a> predicts that individual <a href="positive_charge" title="wikilink">positive</a> or <a href="negative_charge" title="wikilink">negative</a> electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge, isolated South or North magnetic poles should be observable. Using quantum theory Dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist, then one could explain the quantization of electric charge—that is, why the observed <a href="elementary_particles" title="wikilink">elementary particles</a> carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron.</p>

<p>Certain <a href="grand_unified_theories" title="wikilink">grand unified theories</a> predict the existence of monopoles which, unlike elementary particles, are <a class="uri" href="solitons" title="wikilink">solitons</a> (localized energy packets). The initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the <a href="big_bang" title="wikilink">big bang</a> contradicted cosmological observations—the monopoles would have been so plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion of the universe. However, the idea of <a href="Cosmic_inflation" title="wikilink">inflation</a> (for which this problem served as a partial motivation) was successful in solving this problem, creating models in which monopoles existed but were rare enough to be consistent with current observations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="quantum-mechanical-origin-of-magnetism">Quantum-mechanical origin of magnetism</h2>

<p>In principle all kinds of magnetism originate (similar to <a class="uri" href="superconductivity" title="wikilink">superconductivity</a>) from specific quantum-mechanical phenomena (e.g. <a href="Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics</a>, in particular the chapters on <a href="spin_(physics)" title="wikilink">spin</a> and on the <a href="Pauli_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli principle</a>). A successful model was developed already in 1927, by <a href="Walter_Heitler" title="wikilink">Walter Heitler</a> and <a href="Fritz_London" title="wikilink">Fritz London</a>, who derived quantum-mechanically, how hydrogen molecules are formed from hydrogen atoms, i.e. from the atomic hydrogen orbitals

. The "<a href="singlet_state" title="wikilink">singlet state</a>", i.e. the − sign, means: the spins are <em>antiparallel</em>, i.e. for the solid we have <a class="uri" href="antiferromagnetism" title="wikilink">antiferromagnetism</a>, and for two-atomic molecules one has <a class="uri" href="diamagnetism" title="wikilink">diamagnetism</a>. The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: the formation of a <em>symmetric</em> molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results through the Pauli principle automatically in an <em>antisymmetric</em> spin state (i.e. with the − sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an <em>antisymmetric</em> orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a <em>symmetric</em> spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called "<a href="triplet_state" title="wikilink">triplet functions</a>"). Thus, now the spins would be <em>parallel</em> (<a class="uri" href="ferromagnetism" title="wikilink">ferromagnetism</a> in a solid, <a class="uri" href="paramagnetism" title="wikilink">paramagnetism</a> in two-atomic gases).</p>

<p>The last-mentioned tendency dominates in the metals <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a>, <a class="uri" href="cobalt" title="wikilink">cobalt</a> and <a class="uri" href="nickel" title="wikilink">nickel</a>, and in some rare earths, which are <em>ferromagnetic</em>. Most of the other metals, where the first-mentioned tendency dominates, are <em>nonmagnetic</em> (e.g. <a class="uri" href="sodium" title="wikilink">sodium</a>, <a class="uri" href="aluminium" title="wikilink">aluminium</a>, and <a class="uri" href="magnesium" title="wikilink">magnesium</a>) or <em>antiferromagnetic</em> (e.g. <a class="uri" href="manganese" title="wikilink">manganese</a>). Diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic, and not paramagnetic. However, the oxygen molecule, because of the involvement of π-orbitals, is an exception important for the life-sciences.</p>

<p>The Heitler-London considerations can be generalized to the <a href="Heisenberg_model_(classical)" title="wikilink">Heisenberg model</a> of magnetism (Heisenberg 1928).</p>

<p>The explanation of the phenomena is thus essentially based on all subtleties of quantum mechanics, whereas the electrodynamics covers mainly the phenomenology.</p>
