<h1>Co-NP</h1>

<p>In <a href="computational_complexity_theory" title="wikilink">computational complexity theory</a>, <strong>co-NP</strong> is a <a href="complexity_class" title="wikilink">complexity class</a>. A <a href="decision_problem" title="wikilink">decision problem</a>

 is in the complexity class <strong><a href="NP_(complexity)" title="wikilink">NP</a></strong>. In simple terms, <strong>co-NP</strong> is the class of problems for which efficiently verifiable proofs of "no" instances, sometimes called counterexamples, exist. Equivalently, <strong>co-NP</strong> is the set of decision problems where the "no" instances can be accepted in polynomial time by a <a href="non-deterministic_Turing_machine" title="wikilink">non-deterministic Turing machine</a>.</p>

<p>An example of an <a href="NP-complete" title="wikilink"><strong>NP</strong>-complete</a> problem is the <a href="subset_sum_problem" title="wikilink">subset sum problem</a>: given a finite set of integers, is there a non-empty subset that sums to zero? To give a proof of a "yes" instance, one must specify a non-empty subset that does sum to zero. The complementary problem is in <strong>co-NP</strong> and asks: "given a finite set of integers, does every non-empty subset have a non-zero sum?" This problem is not obviously seen to be in <strong>NP</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-to-other-classes">Relationship to other classes</h2>

<p><a href="P_(complexity)" title="wikilink"><strong>P</strong></a>, the class of polynomial time solvable problems, is a subset of both <strong>NP</strong> and <strong>co-NP</strong>. <strong>P</strong> is thought to be a strict subset in both cases (and demonstrably cannot be strict in one case and not strict in the other). <strong>NP</strong> and <strong>co-NP</strong> are also thought to be unequal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> If so, then no <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem can be in <strong>co-NP</strong> and no <a href="co-NP-complete" title="wikilink"><strong>co-NP</strong>-complete</a> problem can be in <strong>NP</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>This can be shown as follows. Suppose there exists an <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem

  <mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ùí≥</mi>
  <annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content">

  <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
   {\mathcal{X}}
  </annotation>

</math>

 that is in <strong>co-NP</strong>. Since all problems in <strong>NP</strong> can be reduced to 

<math display="inline" id="Co-NP:3">
 <semantics>
  <mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">ùí≥</mi>
  <annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content">

, it follows that for every problem in <strong>NP</strong> we can construct a <a href="non-deterministic_Turing_machine" title="wikilink">non-deterministic Turing machine</a> that decides its complement in polynomial time, i.e., <strong>NP</strong> ‚äÜ <strong>co-NP</strong>. From this it follows that the set of complements of the problems in <strong>NP</strong> is a subset of the set of complements of the problems in <strong>co-NP</strong>, i.e., <strong>co-NP</strong> ‚äÜ <strong>NP</strong>. Thus <strong>co-NP</strong> = <strong>NP</strong>. The proof that no <strong>co-NP</strong>-complete problem can be in <strong>NP</strong> if <strong>NP</strong> ‚â† <strong>co-NP</strong> is symmetrical.</p>

<p>If a problem can be shown to be in both <strong>NP</strong> and <strong>co-NP</strong>, that is generally accepted as strong evidence that the problem is probably not <strong>NP</strong>-complete (since otherwise <strong>NP</strong> = <strong>co-NP</strong>).</p>

<p>An example of a problem that is known to belong to both <strong>NP</strong> and in <strong>co-NP</strong> is <a href="integer_factorization" title="wikilink">integer factorization</a>: given positive integers <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> determine if <em>m</em> has a factor less than <em>n</em> and greater than one. Membership in <strong>NP</strong> is clear; if <em>m</em> does have such a factor then the factor itself is a certificate. Membership in <strong>co-NP</strong> is also straightforward: one can just list the prime factors of <em>m</em>, which the verifier can confirm to be valid by multiplication and the <a href="AKS_primality_test" title="wikilink">AKS primality test</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Integer_factorization" title="wikilink">Integer factorization</a> is closely related to the <a class="uri" href="primality" title="wikilink">primality</a> problem. Both primality testing and factorization have long been known to be <strong>NP</strong> and <strong>co-NP</strong> problems. The <a href="AKS_primality_test" title="wikilink">AKS primality test</a>, published in 2002, proves that primality testing also lies in <strong>P</strong>, while factorization may or may not have a polynomial-time algorithm.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
