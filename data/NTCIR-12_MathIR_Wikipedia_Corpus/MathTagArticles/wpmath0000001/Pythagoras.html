<h1>Pythagoras</h1>

<p><strong>Pythagoras of Samos</strong> (;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> , or simply ; Πυθαγόρης in <a href="Ionian_Greek" title="wikilink">Ionian Greek</a>;  )<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> was an <a href="Ionians" title="wikilink">Ionian</a> <a href="Ancient_Greeks" title="wikilink">Greek</a> <a href="Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">philosopher</a>, <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, and has been credited as the founder of the movement called <a class="uri" href="Pythagoreanism" title="wikilink">Pythagoreanism</a>. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of <a class="uri" href="Samos" title="wikilink">Samos</a>, and traveled, visiting <a class="uri" href="Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> and <a class="uri" href="Greece" title="wikilink">Greece</a>, and maybe <a class="uri" href="India" title="wikilink">India</a>, and in 520 BC returned to Samos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Around 530 BC, he moved to <a href="Crotone" title="wikilink">Croton</a>, in <a href="Magna_Graecia" title="wikilink">Magna Graecia</a>, and there established some kind of school or guild.</p>

<p>Pythagoras made influential contributions to <a class="uri" href="philosophy" title="wikilink">philosophy</a> and <a class="uri" href="religion" title="wikilink">religion</a> in the late 6th century BC. He is often revered as a great <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a> and <a class="uri" href="scientist" title="wikilink">scientist</a> and is best known for the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a> which bears his name. However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other <a href="Pre-Socratic_philosophy" title="wikilink">pre-Socratic philosophers</a>, one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> or <a href="natural_philosophy" title="wikilink">natural philosophy</a>. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues and successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a>, and through him, all of <a href="Western_philosophy" title="wikilink">Western philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>The stories which were created were eagerly sought by the <a class="uri" href="Neoplatonist" title="wikilink">Neoplatonist</a> writers who provide most of the details about Pythagoras, but who were uncritical concerning anything which related to the <a href="Greek_gods" title="wikilink">gods</a> or which was considered divine.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Thus many myths were created – such as that <a class="uri" href="Apollo" title="wikilink">Apollo</a> was his father; that Pythagoras gleamed with a <a class="uri" href="supernatural" title="wikilink">supernatural</a> brightness; that he had a golden <a class="uri" href="thigh" title="wikilink">thigh</a>; that <a href="Abaris_the_Hyperborean" title="wikilink">Abaris</a> came flying to him on a golden <a class="uri" href="arrow" title="wikilink">arrow</a>; that he was seen in different places at the same time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> With the exception of a few remarks by <a class="uri" href="Xenophanes" title="wikilink">Xenophanes</a>, <a class="uri" href="Heraclitus" title="wikilink">Heraclitus</a>, <a class="uri" href="Herodotus" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>, <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a>, <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Isocrates" title="wikilink">Isocrates</a>, we are mainly dependent on <a href="Diogenes_Laërtius" title="wikilink">Diogenes Laërtius</a>, <a href="Porphyry_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Porphyry</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Iamblichus" title="wikilink">Iamblichus</a> for biographical details.

<p>Aristotle had written a separate work <em>On the Pythagoreans</em>, which unfortunately has not survived.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> However, the <a href="Protrepticus_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Protrepticus</a> possibly contains parts of On the Pythagoreans.

These writers, late as they are, were among the best sources from whom Porphyry and Iamblichus drew, while still adding some legendary accounts and their own inventions to the mix. Hence, historians are often reduced to considering the statements based on their inherent probability, but even then, if all the credible stories concerning Pythagoras were supposed true, his range of activity would be impossibly vast.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p> According to <a href="Clement_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Clement of Alexandria</a>, Pythagoras is reported to have been a disciple of Soches, the Egyptian archprohet, and Plato of Sechnuphis of Heliopolis. <a class="uri" href="Herodotus" title="wikilink">Herodotus</a>, <a class="uri" href="Isocrates" title="wikilink">Isocrates</a>, and other early writers all agree that Pythagoras was born on <a class="uri" href="Samos" title="wikilink">Samos</a>, the Greek island in the eastern <a href="Aegean_Sea" title="wikilink">Aegean</a>, and we also learn that Pythagoras was the son of <a class="uri" href="Mnesarchus" title="wikilink">Mnesarchus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> His father was a gem-engraver or a merchant. His name led him to be associated with <a href="Pythia" title="wikilink">Pythian</a> <a class="uri" href="Apollo" title="wikilink">Apollo</a>; <a class="uri" href="Aristippus" title="wikilink">Aristippus</a> explained his name by saying, "He spoke (<em>agor-</em>) the truth no less than did the Pythian (<em>Pyth-</em>)", and <a class="uri" href="Iamblichus" title="wikilink">Iamblichus</a> tells the story that the Pythia prophesied that his pregnant mother would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A late source gives his mother's name as Pythais.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> As to the date of his birth, <a class="uri" href="Aristoxenus" title="wikilink">Aristoxenus</a> stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of <a class="uri" href="Polycrates" title="wikilink">Polycrates</a>, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Concerning the fate of Pythagoras himself, the accounts varied. Some say that he perished in the temple with his disciples,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> others that he fled first to <a href="Taranto" title="wikilink">Tarentum</a>, and that, being driven from there, he escaped to <a class="uri" href="Metapontum" title="wikilink">Metapontum</a>, and there according to <em>Diogenes Laërtius</em>, starved himself to death.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> His tomb was shown at Metapontum in the time of <a class="uri" href="Cicero" title="wikilink">Cicero</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Walter Burkert (1972)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dd><em>Most obvious is the contradiction between Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus, regarding the catastrophe that overwhelmed the Pythagorean society. One of the two reports must be basically wrong: either Pythagoras withdrew to Metapontum before the outbreak of the unrest and died there (as Aristoxenus says) or he and his fellowers were hounded from city to city (as Dicaearchus has it). Like his doctrines, the life of Pythagoras also becomes a mirror image of real controversies in the schools. On the one hand there is the controversy over the primacy of the theoretical or practical life. In this respect <a href="Heraclides_Ponticus" title="wikilink">Heraclides</a> thinks Pythagoras as the <a class="uri" href="apostle" title="wikilink">apostle</a> of pure "theory".</em>

<p>According to <a class="uri" href="Iamblichus" title="wikilink">Iamblichus</a> (ca. 250-330 BC, 1918 translation) in <em>The life of Pythagoras</em>, translated by <a href="Thomas_Taylor_(neoplatonist)" title="wikilink">Thomas Taylor</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<dd>''Twenty-two years Pythagoras remained in Egypt, pursuing closely his investigations, visiting every place famous for its teachings, every person celebrated for wisdom. Astronomy and geometry he especially studied and he was thoroughly initiated in all the mysteries of the gods, till, having been taken captive by the soldiers of <a class="uri" href="Cambyses" title="wikilink">Cambyses</a>, he was carried to <a class="uri" href="Babylon" title="wikilink">Babylon</a>.

<h3 id="family">Family</h3>

<p>According to some accounts Pythagoras married <a href="Theano_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Theano</a>, and it has been said that she was first his pupil, a lady of Croton. According to <a href="Mary_Ritter_Beard" title="wikilink">Mary Ritter Beard</a>, Theano told <a href="Hippodamus_of_Thurium" title="wikilink">Hippodamus of Thurium</a> (may be <a href="Hippodamus_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Hippodamus of Miletus</a>, who according to Aristotle planned the city of <a href="Thurii" title="wikilink">Thurium</a> in 440 BC),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> the treatise <em>On Virtue</em>, she wrote, contains the doctrine of the <a href="golden_mean_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">golden mean</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>According to Thesleff, Stobaeus, and Heeren, Theano wrote in <em>On Piety</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<dl>
<dd><em>I have learned that many of the Greeks believe Pythagoras said all things are generated from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did not say that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number - on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.</em>

<p>Their children are variously stated to have included a son, <a class="uri" href="Telauges" title="wikilink">Telauges</a>, and three daughters, <a href="Damo_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Damo</a>, <a class="uri" href="Arignote" title="wikilink">Arignote</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Myia" title="wikilink">Myia</a> (married to <a href="Milo_of_Croton" title="wikilink">Milo of Croton</a>). Milo was said to be an associate of Pythagoras. One story tells of the wrestler saving the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Arignote wrote a <em>Bacchica</em> concerning the mysteries of <a class="uri" href="Demeter" title="wikilink">Demeter</a>, and a work called <em>The Rites of</em> <a class="uri" href="Dionysus" title="wikilink">Dionysus</a>. Among the Pythagorean <em>Sacred Discourses</em> there is a dictum attributed to Arignote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>The eternal essence of number is the most providential cause of the whole heaven, earth and the region in between. Likewise it is the root of the continued existence of the gods and daimones, as well as that of divine men.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Though, Brewer (1894,page 2293) mentioned <em>Pythagoras taught that the sun is a movable sphere in the centre of the universe, and that all the planets revolve round it.</em> Thus, it would appear that Arignote's quote above is not entirely in alignment with his model of the universe, since it is limited to Earth orbit.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="influence">Influence</h3>

<p> Before 520 AD, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, <em>Boyer, C. B.</em> (1968) mentioned that Pythagoras might have met the ca. 54 years older <a href="Thales_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Thales of Miletus</a>, it is said they have learned geometry in Egypt. Thales was a philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Thales is also known for the <a href="Thales'_Theorem" title="wikilink">Thales' Theorem</a>.

<p>In the absence of reliable information, however, a huge range of teachers were assigned to Pythagoras.

<p>According to R.D.

<p>There is little direct evidence as to the kind and amount of knowledge which Pythagoras acquired, or as to his definite philosophical views. Everything of the kind mentioned by <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a> and <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> is attributed not to Pythagoras, but to the Pythagoreans. <a class="uri" href="Heraclitus" title="wikilink">Heraclitus</a> stated that he was a man of extensive learning;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> and <a class="uri" href="Xenophanes" title="wikilink">Xenophanes</a> claimed that he believed in the <a href="metempsychosis" title="wikilink">transmigration of souls</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Xenophanes mentions the story of his interceding on behalf of a <a class="uri" href="dog" title="wikilink">dog</a> that was being beaten, professing to recognise in its cries the voice of a departed friend.

Possibly the tyranny of <a class="uri" href="Polycrates" title="wikilink">Polycrates</a> in Samos made it difficult for him to achieve his schemes there.

Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speech in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>According to <em>Diogenes Laërtius</em>, his followers established a select brotherhood or club (see below school) for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic practices which developed. According to <em>Diogenes Laërtius</em>, what was done and taught among the members was kept a secret. The <a class="uri" href="esoteric" title="wikilink">esoteric</a> teachings may have concerned science and mathematics, or religious doctrines, and may have been connected with the worship of Apollo.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Temperance of all kinds seems to have been strictly urged. There is disagreement among the biographers as to whether Pythagoras forbade all animal food,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> or only certain types.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> The club was in practice at once "a philosophical school, a religious brotherhood, and a political association".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>Conflict seems to have broken out between the towns of <a class="uri" href="Sybaris" title="wikilink">Sybaris</a> and Croton. The forces of Croton were headed by the Pythagorean <a href="Milo_of_Croton" title="wikilink">Milo</a>, and it is likely that the members of the brotherhood took a prominent part. After the decisive victory by Croton, a proposal for establishing a more democratic constitution, was unsuccessfully resisted by the Pythagoreans. Their enemies, headed by <a href="Cylon" title="wikilink">Cylon of Croton</a> and <a href="Ninon_of_Croton" title="wikilink">Ninon</a>, the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from the brotherhood, roused the populace against them. An attack was made upon them while assembled either in the house of Milo, or in some other meeting-place. The building was set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the younger and more active escaping.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Similar commotions ensued in the other cities of Magna Graecia in which Pythagorean clubs had been formed.</p>

<p>As an active and organised brotherhood the Pythagorean order was everywhere suppressed, and did not again revive. Still the Pythagoreans continued to exist as a sect, the members of which kept up among themselves their religious observances and scientific pursuits, while individuals, as in the case of <a class="uri" href="Archytas" title="wikilink">Archytas</a>, acquired now and then great political influence.</p>

<p>While the theorem that now bears his name was known and previously utilized by the <a href="Babylonian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Babylonians</a> and <a href="Indian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Indians</a>, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, be stressed that the way in which the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) <a class="uri" href="cuneiform" title="wikilink">cuneiform</a> sources.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem.

Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a> over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras.

<h3 id="musical-theories-and-investigations">Musical theories and investigations</h3>

<p>  According to legend, the way Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations was when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and thought that the sounds emanating from their anvils were beautiful and harmonious and decided that whatever scientific law caused this to happen must be mathematical and could be applied to music. He went to the blacksmiths to learn how the sounds were produced by looking at their tools. He discovered that it was because the <a href="Pythagorean_hammers" title="wikilink">hammers</a> were "simple ratios of each other, one was half the size of the first, another was 2/3 the size, and so on".</p>

<p>This legend has since proven to be false by virtue of the fact that these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a <a class="uri" href="monochord" title="wikilink">monochord</a>), and not to hammer weight.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> However, it may be that Pythagoras was indeed responsible for discovering the properties of string length.</p>

<p>Pythagoreans elaborated on a theory of numbers, the exact meaning of which is still debated among scholars. Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "<a href="Musica_universalis" title="wikilink">harmony of the spheres</a>". Thus the planets and stars moved according to mathematical equations, which corresponded to musical notes and thus produced a symphony.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Aristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> and Cicero repeats this claim: <em>Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia</em> ("They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Bertrand Russell</a>, in his <em><a href="A_History_of_Western_Philosophy" title="wikilink">A History of Western Philosophy</a></em>, contended that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential of all Western philosophers.</p>

<p>Pythagoras was the first person known to have taught the earth was spherical, with <a class="uri" href="antipodes" title="wikilink">antipodes</a> and that it revolved around the sun. Pythagoras was also said to have spread the seeds of political liberty to Crotona, Sybaris, Meapontum, Rhegium, Sicily, Tauromenium, Catana, Agrigentum and Himera.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="influence-on-greek-art">Influence on Greek art</h3>

<p> In the arts the Greeks searched some reality behind the appearances of things. The early <a href="Archaic_Greece" title="wikilink">Archaic</a> sculpture represents life in simple forms, and it seems that it was influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> There was a general Greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms, and it was represented by a type (εἶδος), which was mathematically calculated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a> This can be observed in the construction of the first temples. The original forms were considered divine, and the forms of the later marble or stone elements indicate that there was an original wooden prototype.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> When the dimensions changed, the architects searched in mathematics some permanent principles behind the appearances of things. <a href="Maurice_Bowra" title="wikilink">Maurice Bowra</a> believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students who asserted that "all things are numbers".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>During the 6th century BC, there was an evolution in the arts from the natural philosophies to the metaphysical theory of Pythagoras.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> The Greek sculptors and architects, tried to find the mathematical relation (<a href="aesthetic_canon" title="wikilink">canon</a>), which would lead to the esthetic perfection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> The sculptor <a class="uri" href="Polykleitos" title="wikilink">Polykleitos</a> in his <em>Canon</em> wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. It seems that he was influenced by the theories of Pythagoras.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> The numbers were extensively used in the Greek architectural orders. In the architectural canons every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. The universe was controlled by the order, and even the sounds were functions of number and ratio. <a href="Rhys_Carpenter" title="wikilink">Rhys Carpenter</a> says that he ratio 2:1 was the generative ratio of the <a href="Doric_order" title="wikilink">Doric order</a>, and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn71">From Christoph Riedweg , <em>Pythagoras, His Life, Teaching and Influence</em>, Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2005: "Had Pythagoras and his teachings not been since the early Academy overwritten with Plato's philosophy, and had this 'palimpsest' not in the course of the Roman Empire achieved unchallenged authority among Platonists, it would be scarcely conceivable that scholars from the Middle Ages and modernity down to the present would have found the Presocratic charismatic from Samos so fascinating. In fact, as a rule it was the image of Pythagoras elaborated by Neopythagoreans and Neoplatonists that determined the idea of what was Pythagorean over the centuries."<a href="#fnref71">↩</a></li>
