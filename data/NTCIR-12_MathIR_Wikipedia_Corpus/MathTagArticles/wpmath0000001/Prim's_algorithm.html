<h1>Prim's algorithm</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>, <strong>Prim's algorithm</strong> is a <a href="greedy_algorithm" title="wikilink">greedy algorithm</a> that finds a <a href="minimum_spanning_tree" title="wikilink">minimum spanning tree</a> for a <a href="Weighted_graph" title="wikilink">weighted</a> <a href="undirected_graph" title="wikilink">undirected graph</a>. This means it finds a subset of the <a href="edge_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">edges</a> that forms a <a href="Tree_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">tree</a> that includes every <a href="Vertex_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">vertex</a>, where the total weight of all the <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">edges</a> in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.</p>
<p>The algorithm was developed in 1930 by <a href="Czech_people" title="wikilink">Czech</a> mathematician <a href="Vojtěch_Jarník" title="wikilink">Vojtěch Jarník</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and later rediscovered and republished by <a href="computer_scientist" title="wikilink">computer scientists</a> <a href="Robert_C._Prim" title="wikilink">Robert C. Prim</a> in 1957<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and <a href="Edsger_W._Dijkstra" title="wikilink">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> in 1959.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Therefore, it is also sometimes called the <strong>DJP algorithm</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <strong>Jarník's algorithm</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> the <strong>Prim–Jarník algorithm</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> or the <strong>Prim–Dijkstra algorithm</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Other well-known algorithms for this problem include <a href="Kruskal's_algorithm" title="wikilink">Kruskal's algorithm</a> and <a href="Borůvka's_algorithm" title="wikilink">Borůvka's algorithm</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> These algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected graph; in contrast, the most basic form of Prim's algorithm only finds minimum spanning trees in connected graphs. However, running Prim's algorithm separately for each <a href="Connected_component_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">connected component</a> of the graph, it can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In terms of their asymptotic <a href="time_complexity" title="wikilink">time complexity</a>, these three algorithms are equally fast for <a href="sparse_graph" title="wikilink">sparse graphs</a>, but slower than other more sophisticated algorithms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, for graphs that are sufficiently dense, Prim's algorithm can be made to run in <a href="linear_time" title="wikilink">linear time</a>, meeting or improving the time bounds for other algorithms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The algorithm may informally be described as performing the following steps: </p>
<p>In more detail, it may be implemented following the <a class="uri" href="pseudocode" title="wikilink">pseudocode</a> below. </p>
<p>As described above, the starting vertex for the algorithm will be chosen arbitrarily, because the first iteration of the main loop of the algorithm will have a set of vertices in <em>Q</em> that all have equal weights, and the algorithm will automatically start a new tree in <em>F</em> when it completes a spanning tree of each connected component of the input graph. The algorithm may be modified to start with any particular vertex <em>s</em> by setting <em>C</em>[<em>s</em>] to be a number smaller than the other values of <em>C</em> (for instance, zero), and it may be modified to only find a single spanning tree rather than an entire spanning forest (matching more closely the informal description) by stopping whenever it encounters another vertex flagged as having no associated edge.</p>
<p>Different variations of the algorithm differ from each other in how the set <em>Q</em> is implemented: as a simple <a href="linked_list" title="wikilink">linked list</a> or <a href="Array_data_structure" title="wikilink">array</a> of vertices, or as a more complicated <a href="priority_queue" title="wikilink">priority queue</a> data structure. This choice leads to differences in the <a href="time_complexity" title="wikilink">time complexity</a> of the algorithm. In general, a priority queue will be quicker at finding the vertex <em>v</em> with minimum cost, but will entail more expensive updates when the value of <em>C</em>[<em>w</em>] changes.</p>

<p>The time complexity of Prim's algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight, which can be done using a <a href="priority_queue" title="wikilink">priority queue</a>. The following table shows the typical choices.</p>

<p>A simple implementation of Prim's, using an <a href="adjacency_matrix" title="wikilink">adjacency matrix</a> or an <a href="adjacency_list" title="wikilink">adjacency list</a> graph representation and linearly searching an array of weights to find the minimum weight edge, to add requires <a href="Big-O_notation" title="wikilink">O</a>(|V|<sup>2</sup>) running time. However, this running time can be greatly improved further by using <a href="Heap_(data_structure)" title="wikilink">heaps</a> to implement finding minimum weight edges in the algorithm's inner loop.</p>
<p>A first improved version uses a heap to store all edges of the input graph, ordered by their weight. This leads to an O(|E| log |E|) worst-case running time. But storing vertices instead of edges can improve it still further. The heap should order the vertices by the smallest edge-weight that connects them to any vertex in the partially constructed <a href="minimum_spanning_tree" title="wikilink">minimum spanning tree</a> (MST) (or infinity if no such edge exists). Every time a vertex <em>v</em> is chosen and added to the MST, a decrease-key operation is performed on all vertices <em>w</em> outside the partial MST such that <em>v</em> is connected to <em>w</em>, setting the key to the minimum of its previous value and the edge cost of (<em>v</em>,<em>w</em>).</p>
<p>Using a simple <a href="binary_heap" title="wikilink">binary heap</a> data structure, Prim's algorithm can now be shown to run in time <a href="Big-O_notation" title="wikilink">O</a>(|E| log |V|) where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. Using a more sophisticated <a href="Fibonacci_heap" title="wikilink">Fibonacci heap</a>, this can be brought down to <a href="Big-O_notation" title="wikilink">O</a>(|E| + |V| log |V|), which is <a href="Asymptotic_computational_complexity" title="wikilink">asymptotically faster</a> when the graph is <a href="Dense_graph" title="wikilink">dense</a> enough that |E| is <a href="Big-O_notation#Family_of_Bachmann.E2.80.93Landau_notations" title="wikilink">ω</a>(|V|), and <a href="linear_time" title="wikilink">linear time</a> when |E| is at least |V| log |V|. For graphs of even greater density (having at least |V|<sup><em>c</em></sup> edges for some <em>c</em> > 1), Prim's algorithm can be made to run in linear time even more simply, by using a <a href="d-ary_heap" title="wikilink"><em>d</em>-ary heap</a> in place of a Fibonacci heap.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="proof-of-correctness">Proof of correctness</h2>
<p>Let <em>P</em> be a connected, weighted <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph</a>. At every iteration of Prim's algorithm, an edge must be found that connects a vertex in a subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph. Since <em>P</em> is connected, there will always be a path to every vertex. The output <em>Y</em> of Prim's algorithm is a <a href="Tree_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">tree</a>, because the edge and vertex added to tree <em>Y</em> are connected. Let <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em> be a minimum spanning tree of graph P. If <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em>=<em>Y</em> then <em>Y</em> is a minimum spanning tree. Otherwise, let <em>e</em> be the first edge added during the construction of tree <em>Y</em> that is not in tree <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em>, and <em>V</em> be the set of vertices connected by the edges added before edge <em>e</em>. Then one endpoint of edge <em>e</em> is in set <em>V</em> and the other is not. Since tree <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em> is a spanning tree of graph <em>P</em>, there is a path in tree <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em> joining the two endpoints. As one travels along the path, one must encounter an edge <em>f</em> joining a vertex in set <em>V</em> to one that is not in set <em>V</em>. Now, at the iteration when edge <em>e</em> was added to tree <em>Y</em>, edge <em>f</em> could also have been added and it would be added instead of edge <em>e</em> if its weight was less than <em>e</em>, and since edge <em>f</em> was not added, we conclude that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$w(f) \ge w(e).$$</span></p>
<p>Let tree <em>Y<sub>2</sub></em> be the graph obtained by removing edge <em>f</em> from and adding edge <em>e</em> to tree <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em>. It is easy to show that tree <em>Y<sub>2</sub></em> is connected, has the same number of edges as tree <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em>, and the total weights of its edges is not larger than that of tree <em>Y<sub>1</sub></em>, therefore it is also a minimum spanning tree of graph <em>P</em> and it contains edge <em>e</em> and all the edges added before it during the construction of set <em>V</em>. Repeat the steps above and we will eventually obtain a minimum spanning tree of graph <em>P</em> that is identical to tree <em>Y</em>. This shows <em>Y</em> is a minimum spanning tree.</p>
