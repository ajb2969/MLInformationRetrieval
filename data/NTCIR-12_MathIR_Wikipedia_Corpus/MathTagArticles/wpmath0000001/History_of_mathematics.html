<h1>History of mathematics</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The area of study known as the <strong>history of mathematics</strong> is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the <a href="History_of_mathematical_notation" title="wikilink">mathematical methods and notation of the past</a>.</p>

<p>Before the <a href="modern_age" title="wikilink">modern age</a> and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. The most ancient mathematical texts available are <em><a href="Plimpton_322" title="wikilink">Plimpton 322</a></em> (<a href="Babylonian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Babylonian mathematics</a> c. 1900 BC),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the <em><a href="Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus" title="wikilink">Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</a></em> (Egyptian mathematics c. 2000-1800 BC)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the <em><a href="Moscow_Mathematical_Papyrus" title="wikilink">Moscow Mathematical Papyrus</a></em> (<a href="Egyptian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Egyptian mathematics</a> c. 1890 BC). All of these texts concern the so-called <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a>, which seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.</p>

<p>The study of mathematics as a subject in its own right begins in the 6th century BC with the <a class="uri" href="Pythagoreans" title="wikilink">Pythagoreans</a>, who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient Greek <em>μάθημα</em> (<em>mathema</em>), meaning "subject of instruction".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="Greek_mathematics" title="wikilink">Greek mathematics</a> greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and <a href="mathematical_rigor" title="wikilink">mathematical rigor</a> in <a href="mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">proofs</a>) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="Chinese_mathematics" title="wikilink">Chinese mathematics</a> made early contributions, including a <a href="place_value_system" title="wikilink">place value system</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The <a href="Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system" title="wikilink">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a> and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in <a href="Indian_mathematics" title="wikilink">India</a> and were transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics through the work of <a href="Muḥammad_ibn_Mūsā_al-Khwārizmī" title="wikilink">Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <a href="Islamic_mathematics" title="wikilink">Islamic mathematics</a>, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then <a href="Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century" title="wikilink">translated into Latin</a>, which led to further development of mathematics in <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval Europe</a>.</p>

<p>From ancient times through the <a href="postclassical_age" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a> <a class="uri" href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italy</a> in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an <a href="exponential_growth" title="wikilink">increasing pace</a> that continues through the present day.</p>
<h2 id="prehistoric-mathematics">Prehistoric mathematics</h2>

<p>The origins of mathematical thought lie in the concepts of <a class="uri" href="number" title="wikilink">number</a>, <a href="magnitude_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magnitude</a>, and <a href="Configuration_(geometry)" title="wikilink">form</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to humans. Such concepts would have been part of everyday life in hunter-gatherer societies. The idea of the "number" concept evolving gradually over time is supported by the existence of languages which preserve the distinction between "one", "two", and "many", but not of numbers larger than two.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Prehistory" title="wikilink">Prehistoric</a> <a href="artifact_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">artifacts</a> discovered in Africa, dated <a href="Upper_Paleolithic" title="wikilink">20,000</a> years old or more suggest early attempts to <a href="Quantification_(science)" title="wikilink">quantify</a> time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Most evidence is against the <a href="Lebombo_bone" title="wikilink">Lebombo bone</a> (ca. 43,500 yr BC) being a mathematical object, but the <a href="Ishango_bone" title="wikilink">Ishango bone</a>, found near the headwaters of the <a class="uri" href="Nile" title="wikilink">Nile</a> river (northeastern <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="wikilink">Congo</a>), may be more than <a href="Upper_Paleolithic" title="wikilink">20,000</a> years old and consists of a series of tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the bone. Common interpretations are that the Ishango bone shows either the earliest known demonstration of <a href="sequence" title="wikilink">sequences</a> of <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> or a six-month lunar calendar.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In the book <em>How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years</em>, Peter Rudman argues that the development of the concept of prime numbers could only have come about after the concept of division, which he dates to after 10,000 BC, with prime numbers probably not being understood until about 500 BC. He also writes that "no attempt has been made to explain why a tally of something should exhibit multiples of two, prime numbers between 10 and 20, and some numbers that are almost multiples of 10."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Ishango bone, according to scholar <a href="Alexander_Marshack" title="wikilink">Alexander Marshack</a>, may have influenced the later development of mathematics in Egypt as, like some entries on the Ishango bone, Egyptian arithmetic also made use of multiplication by 2; this, however, is disputed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Predynastic_Egypt" title="wikilink">Predynastic Egyptians</a> of the 5th millennium BC pictorially represented <a href="Geometry" title="wikilink">geometric</a> designs. It has been claimed that <a href="megalith" title="wikilink">megalithic</a> monuments in <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a> and <a class="uri" href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>, dating from the 3rd millennium BC, incorporate geometric ideas such as <a href="circle" title="wikilink">circles</a>, <a href="ellipse" title="wikilink">ellipses</a>, and <a href="Pythagorean_triple" title="wikilink">Pythagorean triples</a> in their design.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>All of the above are disputed however, and the currently oldest undisputed mathematical usage is in Babylonian and dynastic Egyptian sources.</p>
<h2 id="babylonian-mathematics">Babylonian mathematics</h2>

<p> <a href="Babylonia" title="wikilink">Babylonian</a> mathematics refers to any mathematics of the peoples of <a class="uri" href="Mesopotamia" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a> (modern <a class="uri" href="Iraq" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>) from the days of the early <a href="Sumer" title="wikilink">Sumerians</a> through the <a href="Hellenistic_period" title="wikilink">Hellenistic period</a> almost to the dawn of <a class="uri" href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christianity</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It is named Babylonian mathematics due to the central role of <a class="uri" href="Babylon" title="wikilink">Babylon</a> as a place of study. Later under the <a href="Caliphate" title="wikilink">Arab Empire</a>, Mesopotamia, especially <a class="uri" href="Baghdad" title="wikilink">Baghdad</a>, once again became an important center of study for <a href="Islamic_mathematics" title="wikilink">Islamic mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast to the sparsity of sources in <a href="Egyptian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Egyptian mathematics</a>, our knowledge of Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Written in <a href="Cuneiform_script" title="wikilink">Cuneiform script</a>, tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.</p>

<p>The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient <a href="Sumer" title="wikilink">Sumerians</a>, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of <a class="uri" href="metrology" title="wikilink">metrology</a> from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote <a href="multiplication_table" title="wikilink">multiplication tables</a> on clay tablets and dealt with <a href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometrical</a> exercises and <a href="Division_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">division</a> problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The majority of recovered clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of <a href="Regular_number" title="wikilink">regular</a> <a href="Multiplicative_inverse" title="wikilink">reciprocal</a> <a href="Twin_prime" title="wikilink">pairs</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving <a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear</a> and <a href="quadratic_equation" title="wikilink">quadratic equations</a>. The Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places.</p>

<p>Babylonian mathematics were written using a <a class="uri" href="sexagesimal" title="wikilink">sexagesimal</a> (base-60) <a href="numeral_system" title="wikilink">numeral system</a>. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the <a class="uri" href="decimal" title="wikilink">decimal</a> system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. On the other hand, this "defect" is equivalent to the modern-day usage of floating point arithmetic; moreover, the use of base 60 means that any reciprocal of an integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 necessarily has a finite expansion to the base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Accordingly, there is a strong argument that arithmetic Old Babylonian style is considerably more sophisticated than that of current usage.</p>

<p>The interpretation of Plimpton 322 was the source of controversy for many years after its significance in the context of Pythagorean triangles was realized. In historical context, inheritance problems involving equal-area subdivision of triangular and trapezoidal fields (with integer length sides) quickly convert into the need to calculate the <a href="square_root_of_2" title="wikilink">square root of 2</a>, or to solve the "Pythagorean equation" in integers.</p>

<p>Rather than considering a square as the sum of two squares, we can equivalently consider a square as a difference of two squares. Let a, b and c be integers that form a Pythagorean Triple: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Then c^2 - a^2 = b^2, and using the expansion for the difference of two squares we get (c-a)(c+a)= b^2. Dividing by b^2, it becomes the product of two rational numbers giving 1: (c/b - a/b)(c/b + a/b) = 1. We require two rational numbers which are reciprocals and which differ by 2(a/b). This is easily solved by consulting a table of reciprocal pairs. E.g., (1/2) (2) = 1 is a pair of reciprocals which differ by 3/2 = 2(a/b) Thus a/b = 3/4, giving a=3, b=4 and so c=5.</p>

<p>Solutions of the original equation are thus constructed by choosing a rational number x, from which Pythagorean-triples are 2x, x^2-1, x^2+1. Other triples are made by scaling these by an integer (the scaling integer being half the difference between the largest and one other side). All Pythagorean triples arise in this way, and the examples provided in Plimpton 322 involve some quite large numbers, by modern standards, such as (4601, 4800, 6649) in decimal notation.</p>
<h2 id="egyptian-mathematics">Egyptian mathematics</h2>

<p> <a href="Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> mathematics refers to mathematics written in the <a href="Egyptian_language" title="wikilink">Egyptian language</a>. From the <a href="Hellenistic_period" title="wikilink">Hellenistic period</a>, <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> replaced Egyptian as the written language of <a href="Egyptians" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> scholars. Mathematical study in <a class="uri" href="Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a> later continued under the <a href="Caliphate" title="wikilink">Arab Empire</a> as part of <a href="Islamic_mathematics" title="wikilink">Islamic mathematics</a>, when <a class="uri" href="Arabic" title="wikilink">Arabic</a> became the written language of Egyptian scholars.</p>

<p>The most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is the <a href="Rhind_papyrus" title="wikilink">Rhind papyrus</a> (sometimes also called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the <a href="Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Middle Kingdom</a> of about 2000-1800 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> including <a href="composite_number" title="wikilink">composite</a> and <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime numbers</a>; <a href="arithmetic_mean" title="wikilink">arithmetic</a>, <a href="geometric_mean" title="wikilink">geometric</a> and <a href="harmonic_mean" title="wikilink">harmonic means</a>; and simplistic understandings of both the <a href="Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" title="wikilink">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> and <a href="Perfect_number" title="wikilink">perfect number theory</a> (namely, that of the number 6).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> It also shows how to solve first order <a href="linear_equation" title="wikilink">linear equations</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> as well as <a href="arithmetic_series" title="wikilink">arithmetic</a> and <a href="geometric_series" title="wikilink">geometric series</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Another significant Egyptian mathematical text is the <a href="Moscow_papyrus" title="wikilink">Moscow papyrus</a>, also from the <a href="Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Middle Kingdom</a> period, dated to c. 1890 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> It consists of what are today called <em>word problems</em> or <em>story problems</em>, which were apparently intended as entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a <a class="uri" href="frustum" title="wikilink">frustum</a>: "If you are told: A truncated pyramid of 6 for the vertical height by 4 on the base by 2 on the top. You are to square this 4, result 16. You are to double 4, result 8. You are to square 2, result 4. You are to add the 16, the 8, and the 4, result 28. You are to take one third of 6, result 2. You are to take 28 twice, result 56. See, it is 56. You will find it right."</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="Berlin_Papyrus_6619" title="wikilink">Berlin Papyrus 6619</a> (c. 1800 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a second-order <a href="algebraic_equation" title="wikilink">algebraic equation</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="greek-mathematics">Greek mathematics</h2>

<p> Greek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in the <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek language</a> from the time of <a href="Thales_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Thales of Miletus</a> (~600 BC) to the closure of the <a href="Platonic_Academy" title="wikilink">Academy of Athens</a> in 529 AD.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek mathematics of the period following <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a> is sometimes called Hellenistic mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Greek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used <a href="mathematical_rigor" title="wikilink">mathematical rigor</a> to <a href="mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">prove</a> them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>Greek mathematics is thought to have begun with <a href="Thales_of_Miletus" title="wikilink">Thales of Miletus</a> (c. 624–c.546 BC) and <a href="Pythagoras_of_Samos" title="wikilink">Pythagoras of Samos</a> (c. 582–c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by <a href="Egyptian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a> and <a href="Babylonian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Babylonian mathematics</a>. According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.</p>

<p> Thales used <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a> to solve problems such as calculating the height of <a class="uri" href="pyramids" title="wikilink">pyramids</a> and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to <a href="Thales'_Theorem" title="wikilink">Thales' Theorem</a>. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Pythagoras established the <a href="Pythagoreans" title="wikilink">Pythagorean School</a>, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of <a href="irrational_numbers" title="wikilink">irrational numbers</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a> (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for inspiring and guiding others.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> His <a href="Platonic_Academy" title="wikilink">Platonic Academy</a>, in <a class="uri" href="Athens" title="wikilink">Athens</a>, became the mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the leading mathematicians of the day, such as <a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>, came.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Plato also discussed the foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a line as "breadthless length"), and reorganized the assumptions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">analytic method</a> is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his name.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus</a> (408–c.355 BC) developed the <a href="method_of_exhaustion" title="wikilink">method of exhaustion</a>, a precursor of modern <a href="Integral" title="wikilink">integration</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of <a href="incommensurable_magnitudes" title="wikilink">incommensurable magnitudes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> (384—c.322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was the <a class="uri" href="Musaeum" title="wikilink">Musaeum</a> of <a class="uri" href="Alexandria" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> It was there that <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a> (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the <em><a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Elements</a></em>, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The <em>Elements</em> introduced <a href="mathematical_rigor" title="wikilink">mathematical rigor</a> through the <a href="axiomatic_method" title="wikilink">axiomatic method</a> and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof.

<h2 id="chinese-mathematics">Chinese mathematics</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Early Chinese mathematics is so different from that of other parts of the world that it is reasonable to assume independent development.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> The oldest extant mathematical text from China is the <em><a href="Zhou_Bi_Suan_Jing" title="wikilink">Chou Pei Suan Ching</a></em>, variously dated to between 1200 BC and 100 BC, though a date of about 300 BC appears reasonable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>Of particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called "rod numerals" in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for "1", followed by the symbol for "100", then the symbol for "2" followed by the symbol for "10", followed by the symbol for "3". This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Rod numerals allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the <em><a href="suanpan" title="wikilink">suan pan</a></em>, or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the <em>suan pan</em> is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in Xu Yue's <em>Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures</em>.</p>

<p>The oldest existent work on <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a> in China comes from the philosophical <a href="Mohism" title="wikilink">Mohist</a> canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of <a class="uri" href="Mozi" title="wikilink">Mozi</a> (470–390 BC). The <em>Mo Jing</em> described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>In 212 BC, the Emperor <a href="Qin_Shi_Huang" title="wikilink">Qin Shi Huang</a> (Shi Huang-ti) commanded all books in the Qin Empire other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the <a href="Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars" title="wikilink">book burning</a> of 212 BC, the <a href="Han_dynasty" title="wikilink">Han dynasty</a> (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is <em><a href="The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art" title="wikilink">The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</a></em>, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for <a href="Chinese_pagoda" title="wikilink">Chinese pagoda</a> towers, engineering, <a class="uri" href="surveying" title="wikilink">surveying</a>, and includes material on <a href="right_triangle" title="wikilink">right triangles</a> and values of <a class="uri" href="π" title="wikilink">π</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> It created mathematical proof for the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a>, and a mathematical formula for <a href="Gaussian_elimination" title="wikilink">Gaussian elimination</a>. <a href="Liu_Hui" title="wikilink">Liu Hui</a> commented on the work in the 3rd century AD, and gave a value of π accurate to 5 decimal places.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD <a href="Zu_Chongzhi" title="wikilink">Zu Chongzhi</a> computed the value of π to seven decimal places, which remained the most accurate value of π for almost the next 1000 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> He also established a method which would later be called <a href="Cavalieri's_principle" title="wikilink">Cavalieri's principle</a> to find the volume of a <a class="uri" href="sphere" title="wikilink">sphere</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>The high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurs in the 13th century (latter part of the <a href="Song_dynasty" title="wikilink">Song period</a>), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the <em>Precious Mirror of the Four Elements</em> by Chu Shih-chieh (fl. 1280-1303), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to <a href="Horner's_method" title="wikilink">Horner's method</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The <em>Precious Mirror</em> also contains a diagram of <a href="Pascal's_triangle" title="wikilink">Pascal's triangle</a> with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the <a href="magic_square" title="wikilink">magic square</a> and <a href="Magic_circle_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">magic circles</a>, described in ancient times and perfected by <a href="Yang_Hui" title="wikilink">Yang Hui</a> (AD 1238–1298).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p>Even after European mathematics began to flourish during the <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>, European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards. <a class="uri" href="Jesuit" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a> missionaries such as <a href="Matteo_Ricci" title="wikilink">Matteo Ricci</a> carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>

<p>  The earliest civilization on the Indian subcontinent is the <a href="Indus_Valley_Civilization" title="wikilink">Indus Valley Civilization</a> that flourished between 2600 and 1900 BC in the <a href="Indus_river" title="wikilink">Indus river</a> basin. Their cities were laid out with geometric regularity, but no known mathematical documents survive from this civilization.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p>The Hindu-Arabic numerals were invented by mathematicians in India. They were called "Hindu numerals". They were later called "Arabic" numerals by Europeans, because they were introduced in the West by Arab merchants.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p>Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the <a href="Brahmi_numeral" title="wikilink">Brahmi numerals</a>. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs (as one will note when perusing Unicode character charts). This table shows two examples:</p>

<p>The oldest extant mathematical records from India are the <a href="Sulba_Sutras" title="wikilink">Sulba Sutras</a> (dated variously between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century AD),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> appendices to religious texts which give simple rules for constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and others.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> As with Egypt, the preoccupation with temple functions points to an origin of mathematics in religious ritual.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> The Sulba Sutras give methods for constructing a <a href="squaring_the_circle" title="wikilink">circle with approximately the same area as a given square</a>, which imply several different approximations of the value of <a class="uri" href="π" title="wikilink">π</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> In addition, they compute the <a href="square_root" title="wikilink">square root</a> of 2 to several decimal places, list Pythagorean triples, and give a statement of the <a href="Pythagorean_theorem" title="wikilink">Pythagorean theorem</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> All of these results are present in Babylonian mathematics, indicating Mesopotamian influence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> It is not known to what extent the Sulba Sutras influenced later Indian mathematicians.

<p>The next significant mathematical documents from India after the <em>Sulba Sutras</em> are the <em>Siddhantas</em>, astronomical treatises from the 4th and 5th centuries AD (<a href="Gupta_period" title="wikilink">Gupta period</a>) showing strong Hellenistic influence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> They are significant in that they contain the first instance of trigonometric relations based on the half-chord, as is the case in modern trigonometry, rather than the full chord, as was the case in Ptolemaic trigonometry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Through a series of translation errors, the words "sine" and "cosine" derive from the Sanskrit "jiya" and "kojiya".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p> The <a href="Caliphate" title="wikilink">Islamic Empire</a> established across <a class="uri" href="Persia" title="wikilink">Persia</a>, the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a>, <a href="Central_Asia" title="wikilink">Central Asia</a>, <a href="North_Africa" title="wikilink">North Africa</a>, <a href="Iberian_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Iberia</a>, and in parts of <a href="History_of_India" title="wikilink">India</a> in the 8th century made significant contributions towards mathematics. Although most Islamic texts on mathematics were written in <a href="Arabic_language" title="wikilink">Arabic</a>, most of them were not written by <a href="Arab" title="wikilink">Arabs</a>, since much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time. <a href="Persian_people" title="wikilink">Persians</a> contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.</p>

<p>In the 9th century, the <a href="Persian_people" title="wikilink">Persian</a> mathematician  wrote several important books on the Hindu-Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book <em>On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals</em>, written about 825, along with the work of <a class="uri" href="Al-Kindi" title="wikilink">Al-Kindi</a>, were instrumental in spreading <a href="Indian_mathematics" title="wikilink">Indian mathematics</a> and <a href="Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system" title="wikilink">Indian numerals</a> to the West. The word <em><a class="uri" href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithm</a></em> is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word <em><a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a></em> from the title of one of his works, <em><a href="The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing" title="wikilink">Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala</a></em> (<em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em>). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> and he was the first to teach algebra in an <a href="Elementary_algebra" title="wikilink">elementary form</a> and for its own sake.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> He also discussed the fundamental method of "<a href="Reduction_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">reduction</a>" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khwārizmī originally described as <em>al-jabr</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of problems to be resolved, but an <a href="Expository_writing" title="wikilink">exposition</a> which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study." He also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a></p>

<p>In Egypt, <a href="Abu_Kamil" title="wikilink">Abu Kamil</a> extended algebra to the set of <a href="irrational_numbers" title="wikilink">irrational numbers</a>, accepting square roots and fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables.

<p>Further developments in algebra were made by <a class="uri" href="Al-Karaji" title="wikilink">Al-Karaji</a> in his treatise <em>al-Fakhri</em>, where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. Something close to a <a href="Mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">proof</a> by <a href="mathematical_induction" title="wikilink">mathematical induction</a> appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the <a href="binomial_theorem" title="wikilink">binomial theorem</a>, <a href="Pascal's_triangle" title="wikilink">Pascal's triangle</a>, and the sum of <a class="uri" href="integral" title="wikilink">integral</a> <a href="Cube_(algebra)" title="wikilink">cubes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> The <a class="uri" href="historian" title="wikilink">historian</a> of mathematics, F.

Also in the 10th century, <a href="Abul_Wafa" title="wikilink">Abul Wafa</a> translated the works of <a class="uri" href="Diophantus" title="wikilink">Diophantus</a> into Arabic. <a href="Ibn_al-Haytham" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Haytham</a> was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to find the volume of a <a class="uri" href="paraboloid" title="wikilink">paraboloid</a>, and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of <a href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomials</a> up to the <a href="Quartic_polynomial" title="wikilink">fourth degree</a>.

<p>In the late 11th century, <a href="Omar_Khayyam" title="wikilink">Omar Khayyam</a> wrote <em>Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid</em>, a book about what he perceived as flaws in <a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Euclid's <em>Elements</em></a>, especially the <a href="parallel_postulate" title="wikilink">parallel postulate</a>.

<h2 id="medieval-european-mathematics">Medieval European mathematics</h2>

<p>Medieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified by <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a>'s <em><a href="Timaeus_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Timaeus</a></em> and the biblical passage (in the <em><a href="Book_of_Wisdom" title="wikilink">Book of Wisdom</a></em>) that God had <em>ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Boethius" title="wikilink">Boethius</a> provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term <em><a class="uri" href="quadrivium" title="wikilink">quadrivium</a></em> to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote <em>De institutione arithmetica</em>, a free translation from the Greek of <a class="uri" href="Nicomachus" title="wikilink">Nicomachus</a>'s <em>Introduction to Arithmetic</em>; <em>De institutione musica</em>, also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a>'s <em><a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Elements</a></em>.

<p>In the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily <a href="Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century" title="wikilink">seeking scientific Arabic texts</a>, including <a class="uri" href="al-Khwārizmī" title="wikilink">al-Khwārizmī</a>'s <em><a href="The_Compendious_Book_on_Calculation_by_Completion_and_Balancing" title="wikilink">The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</a></em>, translated into Latin by <a href="Robert_of_Chester" title="wikilink">Robert of Chester</a>, and the complete text of <a href="Euclid's_Elements" title="wikilink">Euclid's <em>Elements</em></a>, translated in various versions by <a href="Adelard_of_Bath" title="wikilink">Adelard of Bath</a>, <a href="Herman_of_Carinthia" title="wikilink">Herman of Carinthia</a>, and <a href="Gerard_of_Cremona" title="wikilink">Gerard of Cremona</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a> </p>

<p>These new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics. <a class="uri" href="Fibonacci" title="wikilink">Fibonacci</a>, writing in the <em><a href="Liber_Abaci" title="wikilink">Liber Abaci</a></em>, in 1202 and updated in 1254, produced the first significant mathematics in Europe since the time of <a class="uri" href="Eratosthenes" title="wikilink">Eratosthenes</a>, a gap of more than a thousand years. The work introduced <a href="Hindu-Arabic_numerals" title="wikilink">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> to Europe, and discussed many other mathematical problems.</p>

<p>The 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn131" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a> One important contribution was development of mathematics of local motion.</p>

<p><a href="Thomas_Bradwardine" title="wikilink">Thomas Bradwardine</a> proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion.

<p>Heytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by <a href="Integral" title="wikilink">integration</a>), stating that "a moving body uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a [distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn135" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a></p>

<p>During the <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>, the development of mathematics and of <a class="uri" href="accounting" title="wikilink">accounting</a> were intertwined.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn138" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a> While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in <a class="uri" href="Flanders" title="wikilink">Flanders</a> and <a class="uri" href="Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a>) or <a href="abacus_school" title="wikilink">abacus schools</a> (known as <em>abbaco</em> in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. There is probably no need for algebra in performing <a class="uri" href="bookkeeping" title="wikilink">bookkeeping</a> operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of <a href="compound_interest" title="wikilink">compound interest</a>, a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.</p>

<p><a href="Luca_Pacioli" title="wikilink">Luca Pacioli</a>'s <em><a href="Summa_de_arithmetica" title="wikilink">Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità</a></em> (Italian: "Review of <a class="uri" href="Arithmetic" title="wikilink">Arithmetic</a>, <a class="uri" href="Geometry" title="wikilink">Geometry</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ratio" title="wikilink">Ratio</a> and <a href="Proportionality_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">Proportion</a>") was first printed and published in <a class="uri" href="Venice" title="wikilink">Venice</a> in 1494.

It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the <a href="mathematical_puzzles" title="wikilink">mathematical puzzles</a> it contained, and to aid the education of their sons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn139" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a> In <em>Summa Arithmetica</em>, Pacioli introduced symbols for <a href="plus_and_minus" title="wikilink">plus and minus</a> for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. <em>Summa Arithmetica</em> was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain <a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a>. It is important to note that Pacioli himself had borrowed much of the work of <a href="Piero_Della_Francesca" title="wikilink">Piero Della Francesca</a> whom he plagiarized.</p>

<p>In Italy, during the first half of the 16th century, <a href="Scipione_del_Ferro" title="wikilink">Scipione del Ferro</a> and <a href="Niccolò_Fontana_Tartaglia" title="wikilink">Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia</a> discovered solutions for <a href="cubic_equation" title="wikilink">cubic equations</a>. <a href="Gerolamo_Cardano" title="wikilink">Gerolamo Cardano</a> published them in his 1545 book <em><a href="Ars_Magna_(Gerolamo_Cardano)" title="wikilink">Ars Magna</a></em>, together with a solution for the <a href="quartic_equation" title="wikilink">quartic equations</a>, discovered by his student <a href="Lodovico_Ferrari" title="wikilink">Lodovico Ferrari</a>.

<p><a href="Simon_Stevin" title="wikilink">Simon Stevin</a>'s book <em>De Thiende</em> ('the art of tenths'), first published in Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment of <a href="decimal_notation" title="wikilink">decimal notation</a>, which influenced all later work on the <a href="real_number_system" title="wikilink">real number system</a>.</p>

<p>Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas, <a class="uri" href="trigonometry" title="wikilink">trigonometry</a> grew to be a major branch of mathematics. <a href="Bartholomaeus_Pitiscus" title="wikilink">Bartholomaeus Pitiscus</a> was the first to use the word, publishing his <em>Trigonometria</em> in 1595. Regiomontanus's table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn140" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a></p>

<p>During the Renaissance the desire of artists to represent the natural world realistically, together with the rediscovered philosophy of the Greeks, led artists to study mathematics. They were also the engineers and architects of that time, and so had need of mathematics in any case. The art of painting in perspective, and the developments in geometry that involved, were studied intensely.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="th-century">17th century</h3>

<p> The 17th century saw an unprecedented explosion of mathematical and scientific ideas across Europe. <a class="uri" href="Galileo" title="wikilink">Galileo</a> observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. <a href="Tycho_Brahe" title="wikilink">Tycho Brahe</a> had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. By his position as Brahe's assistant, <a href="Johannes_Kepler" title="wikilink">Johannes Kepler</a> was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler's calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of <a href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithms</a> by <a href="John_Napier" title="wikilink">John Napier</a> and <a href="Jost_Bürgi" title="wikilink">Jost Bürgi</a>.

<p>Building on earlier work by many predecessors, <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> discovered the laws of physics explaining <a href="Kepler's_Laws" title="wikilink">Kepler's Laws</a>, and brought together the concepts now known as <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a>. Independently, <a href="Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>, who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, <a href="applied_mathematics" title="wikilink">applied mathematics</a> began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of <a href="Pierre_de_Fermat" title="wikilink">Pierre de Fermat</a> and <a href="Blaise_Pascal" title="wikilink">Blaise Pascal</a>.

<h3 id="th-century-2">19th century</h3>

<p> Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. In the 19th century lived <a href="Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> (1777–1855). Leaving aside his many contributions to science, in <a href="pure_mathematics" title="wikilink">pure mathematics</a> he did revolutionary work on <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a> of <a href="complex_variable" title="wikilink">complex variables</a>, in <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, and on the convergence of <a href="series_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">series</a>. He gave the first satisfactory proofs of the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_algebra" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> and of the <a href="quadratic_reciprocity_law" title="wikilink">quadratic reciprocity law</a>.</p>

<p> This century saw the development of the two forms of <a href="non-Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">non-Euclidean geometry</a>, where the <a href="parallel_postulate" title="wikilink">parallel postulate</a> of <a href="Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">Euclidean geometry</a> no longer holds. The Russian mathematician <a href="Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lobachevsky" title="wikilink">Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky</a> and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician <a href="János_Bolyai" title="wikilink">János Bolyai</a>, independently defined and studied <a href="hyperbolic_geometry" title="wikilink">hyperbolic geometry</a>, where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180°. <a href="Elliptic_geometry" title="wikilink">Elliptic geometry</a> was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Bernhard Riemann</a>; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180°. Riemann also developed <a href="Riemannian_geometry" title="wikilink">Riemannian geometry</a>, which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a>, which generalizes the ideas of <a href="curve" title="wikilink">curves</a> and <a href="surface" title="wikilink">surfaces</a>.</p>

<p>The 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>. <a href="Hermann_Grassmann" title="wikilink">Hermann Grassmann</a> in Germany gave a first version of <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector spaces</a>, <a href="William_Rowan_Hamilton" title="wikilink">William Rowan Hamilton</a> in Ireland developed <a href="noncommutative_algebra" title="wikilink">noncommutative algebra</a>. The British mathematician <a href="George_Boole" title="wikilink">George Boole</a> devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called <a href="Boolean_algebra" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a>, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> and has important applications in <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Augustin-Louis_Cauchy" title="wikilink">Augustin-Louis Cauchy</a>, <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Bernhard Riemann</a>, and <a href="Karl_Weierstrass" title="wikilink">Karl Weierstrass</a> reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.</p>

<p>Also, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. <a href="Niels_Henrik_Abel" title="wikilink">Niels Henrik Abel</a>, a Norwegian, and <a href="Évariste_Galois" title="wikilink">Évariste Galois</a>, a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (<a href="Abel–Ruffini_theorem" title="wikilink">Abel–Ruffini theorem</a>). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to <a href="trisect_an_arbitrary_angle" title="wikilink">trisect an arbitrary angle</a>, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three <a href="dimension" title="wikilink">dimensions</a> in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of <a href="parameter_space" title="wikilink">parameter space</a> and <a href="hypercomplex_number" title="wikilink">hypercomplex numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Abel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of <a href="group_theory" title="wikilink">group theory</a>, and the associated fields of <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study <a class="uri" href="symmetry" title="wikilink">symmetry</a>.</p>

<p>In the later 19th century, <a href="Georg_Cantor" title="wikilink">Georg Cantor</a> established the first foundations of <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>, which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> in the hands of <a class="uri" href="Peano" title="wikilink">Peano</a>, <a href="L._E._J._Brouwer" title="wikilink">L. E. J. Brouwer</a>, <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">David Hilbert</a>, <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Bertrand Russell</a>, and <a href="A.N._Whitehead" title="wikilink">A.N. Whitehead</a>, initiated a long running debate on the <a href="foundations_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">foundations of mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>The 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the <a href="London_Mathematical_Society" title="wikilink">London Mathematical Society</a> in 1865, the <a href="Société_Mathématique_de_France" title="wikilink">Société Mathématique de France</a> in 1872, the <a href="Circolo_Matematico_di_Palermo" title="wikilink">Circolo Matematico di Palermo</a> in 1884, the <a href="Edinburgh_Mathematical_Society" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Mathematical Society</a> in 1883, and the <a href="American_Mathematical_Society" title="wikilink">American Mathematical Society</a> in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the <a href="Quaternion_Society" title="wikilink">Quaternion Society</a>, was formed in 1899, in the context of a <a href="hyperbolic_quaternion#Historical_review" title="wikilink">vector controversy</a>.</p>

<p>In 1897, Hensel introduced <a href="p-adic_number" title="wikilink">p-adic numbers</a>.</p>

<p>The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in <a href="Klein's_encyclopedia" title="wikilink">Klein's encyclopedia</a>.</p>

<p>In a 1900 speech to the <a href="International_Congress_of_Mathematicians" title="wikilink">International Congress of Mathematicians</a>, <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">David Hilbert</a> set out a list of <a href="Hilbert's_problems" title="wikilink">23 unsolved problems in mathematics</a>. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.</p>

<p>Notable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, <a href="Wolfgang_Haken" title="wikilink">Wolfgang Haken</a> and <a href="Kenneth_Appel" title="wikilink">Kenneth Appel</a> used a computer to prove the <a href="four_color_theorem" title="wikilink">four color theorem</a>. <a href="Andrew_Wiles" title="wikilink">Andrew Wiles</a>, building on the work of others, proved <a href="Fermat's_Last_Theorem" title="wikilink">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> in 1995. <a href="Paul_Cohen_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Paul Cohen</a> and <a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Kurt Gödel</a> proved that the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a> is <a href="logical_independence" title="wikilink">independent</a> of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the <a href="ZFC" title="wikilink">standard axioms of set theory</a>. In 1998 <a href="Thomas_Callister_Hales" title="wikilink">Thomas Callister Hales</a> proved the <a href="Kepler_conjecture" title="wikilink">Kepler conjecture</a>.</p>

<p>Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the <a href="classification_of_finite_simple_groups" title="wikilink">classification of finite simple groups</a> (also called the "enormous theorem"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including <a href="Jean_Dieudonné" title="wikilink">Jean Dieudonné</a> and <a href="André_Weil" title="wikilink">André Weil</a>, publishing under the <a class="uri" href="pseudonym" title="wikilink">pseudonym</a> "<a href="Nicolas_Bourbaki" title="wikilink">Nicolas Bourbaki</a>", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p> <a href="Differential_geometry" title="wikilink">Differential geometry</a> came into its own when <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a> used it in <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>. Entire new areas of mathematics such as <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a>, <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>, and <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">John von Neumann</a>'s <a href="game_theory" title="wikilink">game theory</a> changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of <a href="Mathematical_structure" title="wikilink">structures</a> were abstracted using axioms and given names like <a href="metric_space" title="wikilink">metric spaces</a>, <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological spaces</a> etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a>. <a class="uri" href="Grothendieck" title="wikilink">Grothendieck</a> and <a href="Jean-Pierre_Serre" title="wikilink">Serre</a> recast <a href="algebraic_geometry" title="wikilink">algebraic geometry</a> using <a href="Sheaf_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">sheaf theory</a>. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of <a href="dynamical_systems_theory" title="wikilink">dynamical systems</a> that <a href="Henri_Poincaré" title="wikilink">Poincaré</a> had begun in the 1890s. <a href="Measure_theory" title="wikilink">Measure theory</a> was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the <a href="Lebesgue_integral" title="wikilink">Lebesgue integral</a>, <a class="uri" href="Kolmogorov" title="wikilink">Kolmogorov</a>'s axiomatisation of <a href="probability_theory" title="wikilink">probability theory</a>, and <a href="ergodic_theory" title="wikilink">ergodic theory</a>. <a href="Knot_theory" title="wikilink">Knot theory</a> greatly expanded. <a href="Quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">Quantum mechanics</a> led to the development of <a href="functional_analysis" title="wikilink">functional analysis</a>. Other new areas include, <a href="Laurent_Schwartz" title="wikilink">Laurent Schwartz</a>'s <a href="Distribution_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">distribution theory</a>, <a href="Fixed-point_theorem" title="wikilink">fixed point theory</a>, <a href="singularity_theory" title="wikilink">singularity theory</a> and <a href="René_Thom" title="wikilink">René Thom</a>'s <a href="catastrophe_theory" title="wikilink">catastrophe theory</a>, <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>, and <a href="Benoit_Mandelbrot" title="wikilink">Mandelbrot</a>'s <a class="uri" href="fractals" title="wikilink">fractals</a>. <a href="Lie_theory" title="wikilink">Lie theory</a> with its <a href="Lie_group" title="wikilink">Lie groups</a> and <a href="Lie_algebra" title="wikilink">Lie algebras</a> became one of the major areas of study.</p>

<p><a href="Non-standard_analysis" title="wikilink">Non-standard analysis</a>, introduced by <a href="Abraham_Robinson" title="wikilink">Abraham Robinson</a>, rehabillitated the <a class="uri" href="infinitesimal" title="wikilink">infinitesimal</a> approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of <a href="Limit_of_a_function" title="wikilink">limits</a>, by extending the field of real numbers to the <a href="Hyperreal_number" title="wikilink">Hyperreal numbers</a> which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the <a href="surreal_number" title="wikilink">surreal numbers</a> were discovered by <a href="John_Horton_Conway" title="wikilink">John Horton Conway</a> in connection with <a href="combinatorial_game" title="wikilink">combinatorial games</a>.</p>

<p>The development and continual improvement of <a href="computer" title="wikilink">computers</a>, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed <a class="uri" href="industry" title="wikilink">industry</a> to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: <a href="Alan_Turing" title="wikilink">Alan Turing</a>'s <a href="computability_theory" title="wikilink">computability theory</a>; <a href="Computational_complexity_theory" title="wikilink">complexity theory</a>; <a href="Derrick_Henry_Lehmer" title="wikilink">Derrick Henry Lehmer</a>'s use of <a class="uri" href="ENIAC" title="wikilink">ENIAC</a> to further number theory and the <a href="Lucas-Lehmer_test" title="wikilink">Lucas-Lehmer test</a>; <a href="Claude_Shannon" title="wikilink">Claude Shannon</a>'s <a href="information_theory" title="wikilink">information theory</a>; <a href="signal_processing" title="wikilink">signal processing</a>; <a href="data_analysis" title="wikilink">data analysis</a>; <a href="Mathematical_optimization" title="wikilink">optimization</a> and other areas of <a href="operations_research" title="wikilink">operations research</a>. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a> and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of <a href="discrete_mathematics" title="wikilink">discrete</a> concepts and the expansion of <a class="uri" href="combinatorics" title="wikilink">combinatorics</a> including <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph theory</a>. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as <a href="numerical_analysis" title="wikilink">numerical analysis</a> and <a href="symbolic_computation" title="wikilink">symbolic computation</a>. Some of the most important methods and <a href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithms</a> of the 20th century are: the <a href="simplex_algorithm" title="wikilink">simplex algorithm</a>, the <a href="Fast_Fourier_Transform" title="wikilink">Fast Fourier Transform</a>, <a href="error-correcting_code" title="wikilink">error-correcting codes</a>, the <a href="Kalman_filter" title="wikilink">Kalman filter</a> from <a href="control_theory" title="wikilink">control theory</a> and the <a href="RSA_algorithm" title="wikilink">RSA algorithm</a> of <a href="public-key_cryptography" title="wikilink">public-key cryptography</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a> plus one of addition and multiplication, was <a href="Decidability_(logic)" title="wikilink">decidable</a>, i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, <a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Kurt Gödel</a> found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as <a href="Peano_arithmetic" title="wikilink">Peano arithmetic</a>, was in fact <a href="incompleteness_theorem" title="wikilink">incompletable</a>. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, including the notion of <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime number</a>.) A consequence of Gödel's two <a href="incompleteness_theorem" title="wikilink">incompleteness theorems</a> is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">analysis</a> and <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that <a href="Incompleteness_theorem" title="wikilink">cannot be proved</a> within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">David Hilbert</a>'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.</p>

<p> One of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was <a href="Srinivasa_Aiyangar_Ramanujan" title="wikilink">Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan</a> (1887–1920), an Indian <a class="uri" href="autodidact" title="wikilink">autodidact</a> who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of <a href="highly_composite_number" title="wikilink">highly composite numbers</a>, the <a href="partition_function_(number_theory)" title="wikilink">partition function</a> and its <a class="uri" href="asymptotics" title="wikilink">asymptotics</a>, and <a href="Ramanujan_theta_function" title="wikilink">mock theta functions</a>. He also made major investigations in the areas of <a href="gamma_function" title="wikilink">gamma functions</a>, <a href="modular_form" title="wikilink">modular forms</a>, <a href="divergent_series" title="wikilink">divergent series</a>, <a href="General_hypergeometric_function" title="wikilink">hypergeometric series</a> and <a href="prime_number" title="wikilink">prime number</a> theory.</p>

<p><a href="Paul_Erdős" title="wikilink">Paul Erdős</a> published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the <a href="Kevin_Bacon_Game" title="wikilink">Kevin Bacon Game</a>, which leads to the <a href="Erdős_number" title="wikilink">Erdős number</a> of a mathematician. This describes the "collaborative distance" between a person and Paul Erdős, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.</p>

<p><a href="Emmy_Noether" title="wikilink">Emmy Noether</a> has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> she revolutionized the theories of <a href="ring_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">rings</a>, <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fields</a>, and <a href="algebra_over_a_field" title="wikilink">algebras</a>.</p>

<p>As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the <a href="Mathematics_Subject_Classification" title="wikilink">Mathematics Subject Classification</a> was dozens of pages long.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> More and more <a href="mathematical_journal" title="wikilink">mathematical journals</a> were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the <a href="world_wide_web" title="wikilink">world wide web</a> led to online publishing.</p>
<h3 id="st-century">21st century</h3>

<p>In 2000, the <a href="Clay_Mathematics_Institute" title="wikilink">Clay Mathematics Institute</a> announced the seven <a href="Millennium_Prize_Problems" title="wikilink">Millennium Prize Problems</a>, and in 2003 the <a href="Poincaré_conjecture" title="wikilink">Poincaré conjecture</a> was solved by <a href="Grigori_Perelman" title="wikilink">Grigori Perelman</a> (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).</p>

<p>Most mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards <a href="Open_access_(publishing)" title="wikilink">open access publishing</a>, first popularized by the <a class="uri" href="arXiv" title="wikilink">arXiv</a>.</p>
<h2 id="future-of-mathematics">Future of mathematics</h2>

<p>There are many observable trends in mathematics, the most notable being that the subject is growing ever larger, computers are ever more important and powerful, the application of mathematics to bioinformatics is rapidly expanding, the volume of data to be analyzed being produced by science and industry, facilitated by computers, is explosively expanding.</p>

Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius." - Pierre Simon Laplace <a class="uri" href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html">http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html</a><a href="#fnref8">↩</a></li>
