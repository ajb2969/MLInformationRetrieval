<h1>Tonic (music)</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="music" title="wikilink">music</a>, the <strong>tonic</strong> is the first <a href="degree_(music)" title="wikilink">scale degree</a> of a <a href="diatonic_scale" title="wikilink">diatonic scale</a> and the <a href="tonality" title="wikilink">tonal</a> center or final <a href="resolution_(music)" title="wikilink">resolution</a> tone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The <a href="triad_(music)" title="wikilink">triad</a> formed on the tonic note, the <strong>tonic chord</strong>, is thus the most significant <a href="chord_(music)" title="wikilink">chord</a>. More generally, the tonic is the <a href="pitch_(music)" title="wikilink">pitch</a> upon which all other pitches of a piece are <a href="hierarchy" title="wikilink">hierarchically</a> referenced. Scales are named after their tonics, thus the tonic of the scale of C is the note C.</p>

<p>The tonic is often confused with the <a href="root_(chord)" title="wikilink">root</a>, which is the reference note of a chord, rather than that of the scale. It is also represented with the <a href="Roman_numeral_analysis" title="wikilink">Roman numeral</a> I.</p>
<h2 id="importance-and-function">Importance and function</h2>

<p>In western European tonal <a class="uri" href="music" title="wikilink">music</a> of the 18th and 19th centuries, the tonic center was the most important of all the different tone centers which a <a class="uri" href="composer" title="wikilink">composer</a> used in a piece of music, with most pieces beginning and ending on the tonic, usually modulating to the <a href="dominant_(music)" title="wikilink">dominant</a> (the fifth above the tonic, or the fourth note down from the tonic) in between.</p>

<p>Two <a href="parallel_key" title="wikilink">parallel keys</a> have the same tonic. For example, in both C major and C minor, the tonic is C. However, <a href="relative_key" title="wikilink">relative keys</a> (two different scales that share a <a href="key_signature" title="wikilink">key signature</a>) have different tonics. For example, C major and A minor share a key signature that feature no sharps or flats, despite having different tonic pitches (C and A, respectively).</p>

<p><em>Tonic</em> may be reserved exclusively for use in tonal contexts while <strong><em>tonal center</em></strong> and/or <strong><em>pitch center</em></strong> may be used in post- and atonal music: "For purposes of non-tonal centric music, it might be a good idea to have the term 'tone center' refer to the more general class of which 'tonics' (or tone centers in tonal contexts) could be regarded as a subclass."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Thus a pitch center may function referentially or contextually in an <a class="uri" href="atonal" title="wikilink">atonal</a> context, often acting as axis or line of symmetry in an <a href="interval_cycle" title="wikilink">interval cycle</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <strong><em>Pitch centricity</em></strong> was coined by <a href="Arthur_Berger" title="wikilink">Arthur Berger</a> in his "Problems of Pitch Organization in Stravinsky".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The tonic <a href="diatonic_function" title="wikilink">diatonic function</a> includes four separate activities or roles as the principal goal tone, initiating event, generator of other tones, and the stable center neutralizing the tension between dominant and subdominant.</p>
