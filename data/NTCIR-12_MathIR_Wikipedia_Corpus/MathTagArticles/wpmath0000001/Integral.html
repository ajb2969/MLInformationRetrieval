<h1>Integral</h1>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>integral</strong> is an important concept in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. Integration is one of the two main operations in <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a>, with its inverse, <a href="derivative" title="wikilink">differentiation</a>, being the other. Given a <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> of a <a href="Real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> <a href="variable_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">variable</a> <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> and an <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a> <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> of the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a>, the <strong>definite integral</strong></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx$$</span></p>
<p>is defined informally as the signed <a href="area_(geometry)" title="wikilink">area</a> of the region in the <span class="LaTeX">$xy$</span>-plane that is bounded by the <a href="Graph_of_a_function" title="wikilink">graph</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>, the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis and the vertical lines <span class="LaTeX">$x = a$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$x = b$</span>. The area above the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis adds to the total and that below the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis subtracts from the total.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the operation of integration is the reverse of differentiation. For this reason, the term <em>integral</em> may also refer to the related notion of the <a class="uri" href="antiderivative" title="wikilink">antiderivative</a>, a function <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> whose <a class="uri" href="derivative" title="wikilink">derivative</a> is the given function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. In this case, it is called an <em><a href="indefinite_integral" title="wikilink">indefinite integral</a></em> and is written:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$F(x) = \int f(x)\,dx.$$</span> The integrals discussed in this article are those termed <em>definite integrals</em>. It is the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is a continuous real-valued function defined on a <a href="closed_interval" title="wikilink">closed interval</a> <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span>, then, once an antiderivative <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is known, the definite integral of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> over that interval is given by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).$$</span></p>
<p>The principles of integration were formulated independently by <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Leibniz</a> in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of <a class="uri" href="infinitesimal" title="wikilink">infinitesimal</a> width. A rigorous mathematical definition of the integral was given by <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Bernhard Riemann</a>. It is based on a limiting procedure which approximates the area of a <a class="uri" href="curvilinear" title="wikilink">curvilinear</a> region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the <a href="Domain_of_a_function" title="wikilink">domain</a> over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A <a href="line_integral" title="wikilink">line integral</a> is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> is replaced by a certain <a class="uri" href="curve" title="wikilink">curve</a> connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a <a href="surface_integral" title="wikilink">surface integral</a>, the curve is replaced by a piece of a <a class="uri" href="surface" title="wikilink">surface</a> in the three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Integrals of <a href="differential_form" title="wikilink">differential forms</a> play a fundamental role in modern <a href="differential_geometry" title="wikilink">differential geometry</a>. These generalizations of integrals first arose from the needs of <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, and they play an important role in the formulation of many <a href="physical_laws" title="wikilink">physical laws</a>, notably those of <a href="Classical_electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electrodynamics</a>. There are many modern concepts of integration, among these, the most common is based on the abstract mathematical theory known as <a href="Lebesgue_integration" title="wikilink">Lebesgue integration</a>, developed by <a href="Henri_Lebesgue" title="wikilink">Henri Lebesgue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="pre-calculus-integration">Pre-calculus integration</h3>
<p>The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the <a href="method_of_exhaustion" title="wikilink">method of exhaustion</a> of the <a href="ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">ancient Greek</a> astronomer <a href="Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" title="wikilink">Eudoxus</a> (<em>ca.</em> 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by <a class="uri" href="Archimedes" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a> in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for <a href="parabola" title="wikilink">parabolas</a> and an approximation to the area of a circle. Similar methods were independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by <a href="Liu_Hui" title="wikilink">Liu Hui</a>, who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians <a href="Zu_Chongzhi" title="wikilink">Zu Chongzhi</a> and <a href="Zu_Geng_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Zu Geng</a> to find the volume of a sphere (; ).</p>
<p>The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 16th century. At this time the work of <a href="Bonaventura_Cavalieri" title="wikilink">Cavalieri</a> with his <a href="method_of_Indivisibles" title="wikilink">method of Indivisibles</a>, and work by <a href="Pierre_de_Fermat" title="wikilink">Fermat</a>, began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of <mtpl></mtpl> up to degree <span class="LaTeX">$n = 9$</span> in <a href="Cavalieri's_quadrature_formula" title="wikilink">Cavalieri's quadrature formula</a>. Further steps were made in the early 17th century by <a href="Isaac_Barrow" title="wikilink">Barrow</a> and <a href="Evangelista_Torricelli" title="wikilink">Torricelli</a>, who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and <a href="Differential_calculus" title="wikilink">differentiation</a>. Barrow provided the first proof of the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>. <a href="John_Wallis" title="wikilink">Wallis</a> generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.</p>
<h3 id="newton-and-leibniz">Newton and Leibniz</h3>
<p>The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> by <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Newton</a> and <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Leibniz</a>. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern <a class="uri" href="calculus" title="wikilink">calculus</a>, whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.</p>
<h3 id="formalization">Formalization</h3>
<p>While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of <a href="Rigor#Mathematical_rigour" title="wikilink">rigour</a>. <a href="George_Berkeley" title="wikilink">Bishop Berkeley</a> memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them "<a href="The_Analyst#Content" title="wikilink">ghosts of departed quantities</a>". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of <a href="Limit_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">limits</a>. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by <a href="Bernhard_Riemann" title="wikilink">Riemann</a>. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of <a href="Fourier_analysis" title="wikilink">Fourier analysis</a>—to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and <a href="Henri_Lebesgue" title="wikilink">Lebesgue</a> formulated a different definition of integral, founded in <a href="Measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure theory</a> (a subfield of <a href="real_analysis" title="wikilink">real analysis</a>). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the <a href="standard_part" title="wikilink">standard part</a> of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the <a href="hyperreal_number" title="wikilink">hyperreal number</a> system.</p>
<h3 id="historical-notation">Historical notation</h3>
<p><a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with <span class="LaTeX">$$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$x ′$</span>, which Newton used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.</p>
<p>The modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by <a href="Gottfried_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Gottfried Leibniz</a> in 1675 (; ). He adapted the <a href="integral_symbol" title="wikilink">integral symbol</a>, <strong>∫</strong>, from the letter <em>ſ</em> (<a href="long_s" title="wikilink">long s</a>), standing for <em>summa</em> (written as <em>ſumma</em>; Latin for "sum" or "total"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by <a href="Joseph_Fourier" title="wikilink">Joseph Fourier</a> in <em>Mémoires</em> of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in his book of 1822 (; ).</p>
<h2 id="terminology-and-notation">Terminology and notation</h2>
<p>The simplest case, the integral with respect to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> of a real-valued function <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span>, is written as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int f(x)\,dx .$$</span></p>
<p>The integral sign <span class="LaTeX">$∫$</span> represents integration. The symbol <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> (explained below) indicates the variable of integration, <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>. The function <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span> which is to be integrated is called the <em>integrand</em>. In correct mathematical typography, the <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown). Some authors use an upright <span class="LaTeX">$d$</span> (that is, <span class="LaTeX">$d x$</span> instead of <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span>). Also, some authors place the symbol <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> before <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span> rather than after it. Because there is no domain specified, the above integral is called an <em>indefinite integral</em>.</p>
<p>When integrating over a specified domain, we speak of a <em>definite integral</em>. Integrating over a domain <span class="LaTeX">$D$</span> is written as <span class="LaTeX">$\int_D f(x)\,dx$</span>. If <em>D</em> is an interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> of the real line, the integral is usually written <span class="LaTeX">$\displaystyle \int_a^b f(x)\,dx$</span>. The domain <span class="LaTeX">$D$</span> or the interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> is called the <em>domain of integration</em>.</p>
<p>If a function has an integral, it is said to be <em>integrable</em>. In general, the integrand may be a function of more than one variable, and the domain of integration may be an area, volume, a higher-dimensional region, or even an abstract space that does not have a geometric structure in any usual sense (such as a <a href="sample_space" title="wikilink">sample space</a> in probability theory).</p>
<p>In <a href="modern_Arabic_mathematical_notation" title="wikilink">modern Arabic mathematical notation</a>, a reflected integral symbol  is used .</p>
<p>The symbol <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> has different interpretations depending on the theory being used. In Leibniz's notation, <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> is interpreted as an infinitesimal change in <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>. Although Leibniz's interpretation <a href="The_Analyst#Content" title="wikilink">lacks rigour</a>, his integration notation is the most common one in use today. If the underlying theory of integration is not important, <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> can be seen as strictly a notation indicating that <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is a <a href="bound_variable" title="wikilink">dummy variable</a> of integration; if the integral is seen as a <a href="Riemann_integral" title="wikilink">Riemann integral</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> indicates that the sum is over subintervals in the domain of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>; in a <a href="Riemann–Stieltjes_integral" title="wikilink">Riemann–Stieltjes integral</a>, it indicates the weight applied to a subinterval in the sum; in <a href="Lebesgue_integration" title="wikilink">Lebesgue integration</a> and its extensions, <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> is a <a href="measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure</a>, a type of function which assigns sizes to sets; in <a href="non-standard_analysis" title="wikilink">non-standard analysis</a>, it is an <a class="uri" href="infinitesimal" title="wikilink">infinitesimal</a>; and in the theory of <a href="differentiable_manifold" title="wikilink">differentiable manifolds</a>, it is often a <a href="differential_form" title="wikilink">differential form</a>, a quantity which assigns numbers to <a href="tangent_vector" title="wikilink">tangent vectors</a>. Depending on the situation, the notation may vary slightly to capture the important features of the situation. For instance, when integrating a variable <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> with respect to a measure <span class="LaTeX">$μ$</span>, the notation <span class="LaTeX">$dμ($</span> is sometimes used to emphasize the dependence on <em>x</em>.</p>
<h2 id="interpretations-of-the-integral">Interpretations of the integral</h2>
<p>Integrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but <a href="precision_engineering" title="wikilink">precision engineering</a> (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.</p>
<p> To start off, consider the curve <span class="LaTeX">$y = f ( x )$</span> between <span class="LaTeX">$x = 0$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$x = 1$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x ) = \sqrt{x}$</span> (see figure). We ask:</p>
<dl>
<dd>What is the area under the function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>, in the interval from 0 to 1?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>and call this (yet unknown) area the (definite) <strong>integral</strong> of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. The notation for this integral will be</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_0^1 \sqrt x \, dx \,\!.$$</span></p>
<p>As a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides <span class="LaTeX">$x = 0$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$x = 1$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$y = f (0) = 0$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$y = f (1) = 1$</span>. Its area is exactly 1. As it is, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles shall give a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{1/5}$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{2/5}$</span>, and so on to <span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{1} = 1$</span>. Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\textstyle \sqrt {\frac {1} {5}} \left ( \frac {1} {5} - 0 \right ) + \sqrt {\frac {2} {5}} \left ( \frac {2} {5} - \frac {1} {5} \right ) + \cdots + \sqrt {\frac {5} {5}} \left ( \frac {5} {5} - \frac {4} {5} \right ) \approx 0.7497.\,\!$$</span></p>
<p>We are taking a sum of finitely many function values of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>, multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will never be exact: replacing the 5 subintervals by twelve in the same way, but with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203, which is too small. The key idea is the transition from adding <em>finitely many</em> differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or <em><a class="uri" href="infinitesimal" title="wikilink">infinitesimal</a></em> steps.</p>
<p>As for the <em>actual calculation of integrals</em>, the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>, due to Newton and Leibniz, is the fundamental link between the operations of <a href="Derivative" title="wikilink">differentiating</a> and integrating. Applied to the square root curve, <mtpl> <em>x</em><sup>1/2</sup>}}</mtpl>, it says to look at the <a class="uri" href="antiderivative" title="wikilink">antiderivative</a> <mtpl> <em>x</em><sup>3/2</sup>}}</mtpl>, and simply take <span class="LaTeX">$F (1) − F (0)$</span>, where 0 and 1 are the boundaries of the <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a> [0, 1]. So the <em>exact</em> value of the area under the curve is computed formally as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_0^1 \sqrt x \,dx = \int_0^1 x^{1/2} \,dx = F(1)- F(0) = \frac{2}{3}.$$</span></p>
<p>(This is a case of a general rule, that for <mtpl> <em>x</em><sup><em>q</em></sup>}}</mtpl>, with <span class="LaTeX">$q ≠ −1$</span>, the related function, the so-called antiderivative is <mtpl> <em>x</em><sup><em>q</em> + 1</sup>/(<em>q</em> + 1).}}</mtpl>)</p>
<p>The notation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int f(x) \, dx \,\!$$</span> conceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated <span class="LaTeX">$s$</span>, of function values, <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span>, multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called <em>differentials</em>, denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span>. The multiplication sign is usually omitted.</p>
<p>Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a <a href="limit_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">limit</a> of weighted sums, so that the <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann's dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the <a href="Lebesgue_integration" title="wikilink">Lebesgue integral</a>, which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of "measure" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_A f(x) \, d\mu \,\!$$</span> refers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with <span class="LaTeX">$μ$</span> measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> denotes the region of integration.</p>
<p><a href="Differential_geometry" title="wikilink">Differential geometry</a>, with its "calculus on <a href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifolds</a>", gives the familiar notation yet another interpretation. Now <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$dx$</span> become a <a href="differential_form" title="wikilink">differential form</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$ω = f ( x ) dx$</span>, a new <a href="differential_operator" title="wikilink">differential operator</a> <span class="LaTeX">$d$</span>, known as the <a href="exterior_derivative" title="wikilink">exterior derivative</a> is introduced, and the fundamental theorem becomes the more general <a href="Stokes'_theorem" title="wikilink">Stokes' theorem</a>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_{A} d\omega = \int_{\part A} \omega , \,\!$$</span> from which <a href="Green's_theorem" title="wikilink">Green's theorem</a>, the <a href="divergence_theorem" title="wikilink">divergence theorem</a>, and the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> follow.</p>
<p>More recently, infinitesimals have reappeared with rigor, through modern innovations such as <a href="non-standard_analysis" title="wikilink">non-standard analysis</a>. Not only do these methods vindicate the intuitions of the pioneers; they also lead to new mathematics.</p>
<p>Although there are differences between these conceptions of integral, there is considerable overlap. Thus, the area of the surface of the oval swimming pool can be handled as a geometric ellipse, a sum of infinitesimals, a Riemann integral, a Lebesgue integral, or as a manifold with a differential form. The calculated result will be the same for all. </p>

<h2 id="formal-definitions">Formal definitions</h2>
<p>There are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.</p>
<h3 id="riemann-integral">Riemann integral</h3>
<p>The Riemann integral is defined in terms of <a href="Riemann_sum" title="wikilink">Riemann sums</a> of functions with respect to <em>tagged partitions</em> of an interval. Let <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> be a <a href="Interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">closed interval</a> of the real line; then a <em>tagged partition</em> of <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> is a finite sequence</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$a = x_0 \le t_1 \le x_1 \le t_2 \le x_2 \le \cdots \le x_{n-1} \le t_n \le x_n = b . \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>This partitions the interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> into <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> sub-intervals <mtpl></mtpl> indexed by <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span>, each of which is "tagged" with a distinguished point <mtpl></mtpl>. A <em>Riemann sum</em> of a function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i) \Delta_i ;$$</span> thus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let <mtpl> <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>−<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em>−1</sub>}}</mtpl> be the width of sub-interval <span class="LaTeX">$i$</span>; then the <em>mesh</em> of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, <mtpl>1…<em>n</em> Δ<sub><em>i</em></sub>}}</mtpl>. The <em>Riemann integral</em> of a function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> over the interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> is equal to <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> if:</p>
<dl>
<dd>For all <span class="LaTeX">$ε > 0$</span> there exists <span class="LaTeX">$δ > 0$</span> such that, for any tagged partition <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> with mesh less than <span class="LaTeX">$δ$</span>, we have
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\left| S - \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i)\Delta_i \right| < \varepsilon.$$</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower) <a href="Darboux_integral" title="wikilink">Darboux sum</a>, suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the <a href="Darboux_integral" title="wikilink">Darboux integral</a>.</p>
<h3 id="lebesgue-integral">Lebesgue integral</h3>

</figure>
<p>It is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated .</p>
<p>Such an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus <a href="Henri_Lebesgue" title="wikilink">Henri Lebesgue</a> introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to <a href="Paul_Montel" title="wikilink">Paul Montel</a>: </p>
<dl>
<dd><small><em>Source</em>: </small>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As  puts it, "To compute the Riemann integral of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>, one partitions the domain <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> into subintervals", while in the Lebesgue integral, "one is in effect partitioning the range of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a <a href="measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure</a>, μ. In the simplest case, the <a href="Lebesgue_measure" title="wikilink">Lebesgue measure</a> <span class="LaTeX">$μ ( A )$</span> of an interval <span class="LaTeX">$A = a a , b$</span> is its width, <span class="LaTeX">$b − a$</span>, so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.</p>
<p>Using the "partitioning the range of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>" philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function <span class="LaTeX">$f : \mathbf{ R } → \mathbf{ R } $</span> should be the sum over <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span> of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between <span class="LaTeX">$ y = t$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$ y = t + dt$</span>. This area is just . Let }. The Lebesgue integral of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is then defined by </p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int f = \int_0^\infty f^*(t)\,dt$$</span> where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral (<mtpl></mtpl> is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a well-defined improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the <a href="measurable_function" title="wikilink">measurable functions</a>) this defines the Lebesgue integral.</p>
<p>A general measurable function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is Lebesgue integrable if the area between the graph of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> and the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis is finite:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_E |f|\,d\mu < + \infty.$$</span> In that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis and the area below the <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>-axis:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_E f \,d\mu = \int_E f^+ \,d\mu - \int_E f^- \,d\mu$$</span> where</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}

<p>The collection of Riemann integrable functions on a closed interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> forms a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> under the operations of <a href="pointwise_addition" title="wikilink">pointwise addition</a> and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration</p>

<p>is a <a href="linear_functional" title="wikilink">linear functional</a> on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking <a href="linear_combination" title="wikilink">linear combinations</a>; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_a^b (\alpha f + \beta g)(x) \, dx = \alpha \int_a^b f(x) \,dx + \beta \int_a^b g(x) \, dx. \,$$</span></p>

In this situation the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> (i.e. "finite"). The most important special cases arise when <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span> is <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ R } $</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ C } $</span>, or a finite extension of the field <mtpl></mtpl> of <a href="p-adic_number" title="wikilink">p-adic numbers</a>, and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a finite-dimensional vector space over <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span>, and when <span class="LaTeX">$K = \mathbf{ C } $</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a complex <a href="Hilbert_space" title="wikilink">Hilbert space</a>.</p>
<p>Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of "simple" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral.

<h3 id="inequalities">Inequalities</h3>
<p>A number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a> defined on a <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed</a> and <a href="bounded_set" title="wikilink">bounded</a> <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a> <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Upper and lower bounds.</em> An integrable function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> on <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span>, is necessarily <a href="bounded_function" title="wikilink">bounded</a> on that interval.

Since the lower and upper sums of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> over <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> are therefore bounded by, respectively, <span class="LaTeX">$m ( b − a )$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$M ( b − a )$</span>, it follows that</li>

<li><em>Inequalities between functions.</em> If <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x ) ≤ g ( x )$</span> for each <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> then each of the upper and lower sums of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span>.

<ul>
<li><em>Products and absolute values of functions.</em> If <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span> are two functions then we may consider their <a href="pointwise_product" title="wikilink">pointwise products</a> and powers, and <a href="absolute_value" title="wikilink">absolute values</a>:</li>

<h3 id="conventions">Conventions</h3>
<p>In this section <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is a <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real-valued</a> Riemann-integrable <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a>. The integral</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$$</span> over an interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> is defined if <span class="LaTeX">$a . This means that the upper and lower sums of the function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> are evaluated on a partition <mtpl> <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> ≤ <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> ≤ . . . ≤ <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> {{=}} <em>b</em>}}</mtpl> whose values <mtpl></mtpl> are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place "left to right", evaluating <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> within intervals <mtpl></mtpl> where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span>, the end-points of the <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">interval</a>, are called the <a href="limits_of_integration" title="wikilink">limits of integration</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. Integrals can also be defined if <span class="LaTeX">$a > b$</span>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reversing limits of integration.</em> If <span class="LaTeX">$a > b$</span> then define</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = - \int_b^a f(x) \, dx.$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This, with <span class="LaTeX">$a = b$</span>, implies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Integrals over intervals of length zero.</em> If <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span> is a <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real number</a> then</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\int_a^a f(x) \, dx = 0.$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span>; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a <a href="Point_(geometry)" title="wikilink">point</a>, should be <a href="0_(number)" title="wikilink">zero</a>. One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> on an interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span> implies that <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is integrable on any subinterval <span class="LaTeX">$c c , d$</span>, but in particular integrals have the property that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Additivity of integration on intervals.</em> If <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span> is any <a href="element_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">element</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span>, then</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \int_a^c f(x) \, dx + \int_c^b f(x) \, dx.$</span>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With the first convention the resulting relation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}
 \int_a^c f(x) \, dx &{}= \int_a^b f(x) \, dx - \int_c^b f(x) \, dx \\
 &{} = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx + \int_b^c f(x) \, dx
\end{align}$$</span> is then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$b$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$c$</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of viewing the above as conventions, one can also adopt the point of view that integration is performed of differential forms on <a href="Orientability" title="wikilink"><em>oriented</em> manifolds</a> only. If <span class="LaTeX">$M$</span> is such an oriented <span class="LaTeX">$m$</span>-dimensional manifold, and <span class="LaTeX">$M ′$</span> is the same manifold with opposed orientation and <span class="LaTeX">$ω$</span> is an <span class="LaTeX">$m$</span>-form, then one has:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_M \omega = - \int_{M'} \omega \,.$$</span> These conventions correspond to interpreting the integrand as a differential form, integrated over a <a href="Chain_(algebraic_topology)" title="wikilink">chain</a>. In <a href="measure_theory" title="wikilink">measure theory</a>, by contrast, one interprets the integrand as a function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> with respect to a measure <span class="LaTeX">$μ$</span> and integrates over a subset <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>, without any notion of orientation; one writes <span class="LaTeX">$\textstyle{\int_A f\,d\mu = \int_{[a,b]} f\,d\mu}$</span> to indicate integration over a subset <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span>. This is a minor distinction in one dimension, but becomes subtler on higher-dimensional manifolds; see <a href="Differential_form#Relation_with_measures" title="wikilink">Differential form: Relation with measures</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-theorem-of-calculus">Fundamental theorem of calculus</h2>
<p>The <em>fundamental theorem of calculus</em> is the statement that <a href="derivative" title="wikilink">differentiation</a> and integration are inverse operations: if a <a href="continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuous function</a> is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved.

<h3 id="improper-integrals">Improper integrals</h3>
<p> A "proper" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the <a href="limit_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">limit</a> of a <a class="uri" href="sequence" title="wikilink">sequence</a> of proper <a href="Riemann_integral" title="wikilink">Riemann integrals</a> on progressively larger intervals.</p>
<p>If the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx$$</span> If the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance <mtpl></mtpl>, then again a limit may provide a finite result.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{a+\epsilon}^{b} f(x)\,dx$$</span></p>
<p>That is, the improper integral is the <a href="limit_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">limit</a> of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real number</a>, or <span class="LaTeX">$∞$</span>, or <span class="LaTeX">$−∞$</span>. In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the function <span class="LaTeX">$1/(( x + 1) \sqrt{x} )$</span> integrated from 0 to <span class="LaTeX">$∞$</span> (shown right). At the lower bound, as <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> goes to 0 the function goes to <span class="LaTeX">$∞$</span>, and the upper bound is itself <span class="LaTeX">$∞$</span>, though the function goes to 0. Thus this is a doubly improper integral. Integrated, say, from 1 to 3, an ordinary Riemann sum suffices to produce a result of <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>/6. To integrate from 1 to <span class="LaTeX">$∞$</span>, a Riemann sum is not possible. However, any finite upper bound, say <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span> (with <span class="LaTeX">$t > 1$</span>), gives a well-defined result, <span class="LaTeX">$2 arctan( \sqrt{t} ) − \pi /2$</span>. This has a finite limit as <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span> goes to infinity, namely <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>/2. Similarly, the integral from 1/3 to 1 allows a Riemann sum as well, coincidentally again producing <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>/6. Replacing 1/3 by an arbitrary positive value <span class="LaTeX">$s$</span> (with <span class="LaTeX">$s ) is equally safe, giving <span class="LaTeX">$\pi /2 − 2 arctan( \sqrt{s} )$</span>. This, too, has a finite limit as <span class="LaTeX">$s$</span> goes to zero, namely <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>/2. Combining the limits of the two fragments, the result of this improper integral is</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}
 \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}} &{} = \lim_{s \to 0} \int_{s}^{1} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}}
   + \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{dx}{(x+1)\sqrt{x}} \\
  &{} = \lim_{s \to 0} \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \arctan{\sqrt{s}} \right)
   + \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(2 \arctan{\sqrt{t}} - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \\
  &{} = \frac{\pi}{2} + \left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \\
  &{} = \frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} \\
  &{} = \pi .
\end{align}$$</span> This process does not guarantee success; a limit might fail to exist, or might be unbounded. For example, over the bounded interval from 0 to 1 the integral of 1/<span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> does not converge; and over the unbounded interval from 1 to <span class="LaTeX">$∞$</span> the integral of 1/<span class="LaTeX">$\sqrt{x}$</span> does not converge.</p>
<p> It might also happen that an integrand is unbounded at an interior point, in which case the integral must be split at that point. For the integral as a whole to converge, the limit integrals on both sides must exist and must be bounded. For example:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}
 \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}} &{} = \lim_{s \to 0} \int_{-1}^{-s} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}}
   + \lim_{t \to 0} \int_{t}^{1} \frac{dx}{\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\
  &{} = \lim_{s \to 0} 3(1-\sqrt[3]{s}) + \lim_{t \to 0} 3(1-\sqrt[3]{t}) \\
  &{} = 3 + 3 \\
  &{} = 6.
\end{align}$$</span> But the similar integral</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{dx}{x} \,\!$$</span> cannot be assigned a value in this way, as the integrals above and below zero do not independently converge. (However, see <a href="Cauchy_principal_value" title="wikilink">Cauchy principal value</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="multiple-integration">Multiple integration</h3>
<p> Integrals can be taken over regions other than intervals. In general, an integral over a <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a> <span class="LaTeX">$E$</span> of a function <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> is written:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_E f(x) \, dx.$$</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> need not be a real number, but can be another suitable quantity, for instance, a <a href="Vector_(geometric)" title="wikilink">vector</a> in <mtpl></mtpl>. <a href="Fubini's_theorem" title="wikilink">Fubini's theorem</a> shows that such integrals can be rewritten as an <em><a href="Multiple_integral" title="wikilink">iterated integral</a></em>. In other words, the integral can be calculated by integrating one coordinate at a time.</p>
<p>Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the <a class="uri" href="area" title="wikilink">area</a> of the region between the graph of the function and the <em>x</em>-axis, the <em>double integral</em> of a positive function of two variables represents the <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a> of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane which contains its <a href="domain_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">domain</a>. (The same volume can be obtained via the <em>triple integral</em> — the integral of a function in three variables — of the constant function <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x , y , z ) = 1$</span> over the above-mentioned region between the surface and the plane.) If the number of variables is higher, then the integral represents a <a href="Four-dimensional_space" title="wikilink">hypervolume</a>, a volume of a solid of more than three dimensions that cannot be graphed.</p>
<p>For example, the volume of the <a class="uri" href="cuboid" title="wikilink">cuboid</a> of sides 4 × 6 × 5 may be obtained in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By the double integral</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\iint_D 5 \ dx\, dy$</span>

</dd>
<dd>of the function <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x , y ) = 5$</span> calculated in the region <span class="LaTeX">$D$</span> in the <em>xy</em>-plane which is the base of the cuboid. For example, if a rectangular base of such a cuboid is given via the <span class="LaTeX">$xy$</span> inequalities <span class="LaTeX">$3 ≤ x ≤ 7, 4 ≤ y ≤ 10$</span>, our above double integral now reads
</dd>

<dl>
<dd><dl>
<dd><span class="LaTeX">$\int_4^{10}\left[ \int_3^7 \ 5 \ dx\right] dy.$</span>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From here, integration is conducted with respect to either <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> first; in this example, integration is first done with respect to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> as the interval corresponding to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is the inner integral. Once the first integration is completed via the <span class="LaTeX">$F ( b ) − F ( a )$</span> method or otherwise, the result is again integrated with respect to the other variable. The result will equate to the volume under the surface.

<h3 id="line-integrals">Line integrals</h3>
<p> The concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with <a href="vector_field" title="wikilink">vector fields</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>line integral</em> (sometimes called a <em>path integral</em>) is an integral where the <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> to be integrated is evaluated along a <a class="uri" href="curve" title="wikilink">curve</a>. Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a <em>contour integral</em>.</p>
<p>The function to be integrated may be a <a href="scalar_field" title="wikilink">scalar field</a> or a <a href="vector_field" title="wikilink">vector field</a>. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly <a href="arc_length" title="wikilink">arc length</a> or, for a vector field, the <a href="Inner_product_space" title="wikilink">scalar product</a> of the vector field with a <a href="Differential_(infinitesimal)" title="wikilink">differential</a> vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on <a href="interval_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">intervals</a>. Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that <a href="Mechanical_work" title="wikilink">work</a> is equal to <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a>, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ F } $</span>, multiplied by displacement, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ s } $</span>, may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$W=\mathbf F\cdot\mathbf s.$$</span> For an object moving along a path <span class="LaTeX">$C$</span> in a <a href="vector_field" title="wikilink">vector field</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ F } $</span> such as an <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> or <a href="gravitational_field" title="wikilink">gravitational field</a>, the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ s } $</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ s } + d \mathbf{ s } $</span>. This gives the line integral</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$W=\int_C \mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf s.$$</span></p>
<h3 id="surface-integrals">Surface integrals</h3>
<p> A <em>surface integral</em> is a definite integral taken over a <a class="uri" href="surface" title="wikilink">surface</a> (which may be a curved set in <a class="uri" href="space" title="wikilink">space</a>); it can be thought of as the <a href="Multiple_integral" title="wikilink">double integral</a> analog of the <a href="line_integral" title="wikilink">line integral</a>. The function to be integrated may be a <a href="scalar_field" title="wikilink">scalar field</a> or a <a href="vector_field" title="wikilink">vector field</a>. The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.</p>
<p>For an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ v } $</span> on a surface <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>; that is, for each point <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ v } ( x )$</span> is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span>, such that <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ v } ( x )$</span> determines the velocity of the fluid at <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>. The <a class="uri" href="flux" title="wikilink">flux</a> is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the <a href="dot_product" title="wikilink">dot product</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{ v } $</span> with the unit <a href="Normal_(geometry)" title="wikilink">surface normal</a> to <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_S {\mathbf v}\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}}.$$</span> The fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, particularly with the <a href="classical_theory" title="wikilink">classical theory</a> of <a class="uri" href="electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>.</p>
<h3 id="integrals-of-differential-forms">Integrals of differential forms</h3>
<p>A <a href="differential_form" title="wikilink">differential form</a> is a mathematical concept in the fields of <a href="multivariable_calculus" title="wikilink">multivariable calculus</a>, <a href="differential_topology" title="wikilink">differential topology</a> and <a href="tensor" title="wikilink">tensors</a>. The modern notation for the differential form, as well as the idea of the differential forms as being the <a href="Exterior_algebra" title="wikilink">wedge products</a> of <a href="exterior_derivative" title="wikilink">exterior derivatives</a> forming an <a href="exterior_algebra" title="wikilink">exterior algebra</a>, was introduced by <a href="Élie_Cartan" title="wikilink">Élie Cartan</a>.</p>
<p>We initially work in an <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open set</a> in <mtpl></mtpl>. A 0-form is defined to be a <a href="smooth_function" title="wikilink">smooth function</a> <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. When we integrate a <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span> over an <span class="LaTeX">$m$</span>-<a href="dimension" title="wikilink">dimensional</a> subspace <span class="LaTeX">$S$</span> of <mtpl></mtpl>, we write it as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_S f\,dx^1 \ldots dx^m.$$</span></p>
<p>(The superscripts are indices, not exponents.) We can consider <mtpl></mtpl> through <mtpl></mtpl> to be formal objects themselves, rather than tags appended to make integrals look like <a href="Riemann_sum" title="wikilink">Riemann sums</a>. Alternatively, we can view them as <a href="One-form" title="wikilink">covectors</a>, and thus a <a href="measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure</a> of "density" (hence integrable in a general sense). We call the <mtpl></mtpl> <em>basic</em> <a href="one-form" title="wikilink">1-<em>forms</em></a>.</p>
<p>We define the <a href="Exterior_algebra" title="wikilink">wedge product</a>, "<span class="LaTeX">$∧$</span>", a bilinear "multiplication" operator on these elements, with the <em>alternating</em> property that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$dx^a \wedge dx^a = 0 \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>for all indices <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>. Alternation along with linearity and associativity implies <mtpl> −<em>dx</em><sup><em>a</em></sup> ∧ <em>dx</em><sup><em>b</em></sup>}}</mtpl>. This also ensures that the result of the wedge product has an <a href="Orientation_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">orientation</a>.</p>
<p>We define the set of all these products to be <em>basic</em> 2-<em>forms</em>, and similarly we define the set of products of the form <mtpl></mtpl> to be <em>basic</em> 3-<em>forms</em>. A general <em>k</em>-form is then a weighted sum of basic <em>k-</em>forms, where the weights are the smooth functions <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. Together these form a <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> with basic <em>k</em>-forms as the basis vectors, and 0-forms (smooth functions) as the field of scalars. The wedge product then extends to <em>k</em>-forms in the natural way. Over <mtpl></mtpl> at most <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> covectors can be linearly independent, thus a <em>k-</em>form with <span class="LaTeX">$k > n$</span> will always be zero, by the alternating property.</p>
<p>In addition to the wedge product, there is also the <a href="exterior_derivative" title="wikilink">exterior derivative</a> operator <span class="LaTeX">$d$</span>. This operator maps <em>k</em>-forms to (<em>k</em>+1)-forms. For a <em>k</em>-form <mtpl> <em>f</em> <em>dx<sup>a</sup></em>}}</mtpl> over <mtpl></mtpl>, we define the action of <span class="LaTeX">$d$</span> by:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$d\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} dx^i \wedge dx^a.$$</span></p>
<p>with extension to general <em>k</em>-forms occurring linearly.</p>
<p>This more general approach allows for a more natural coordinate-free approach to integration on <a href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifolds</a>. It also allows for a natural generalisation of the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>, called <a href="Stokes'_theorem" title="wikilink">Stokes' theorem</a>, which we may state as</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_{\Omega} d\omega = \int_{\partial\Omega} \omega \,\!$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$ω$</span> is a general <em>k</em>-form, and <span class="LaTeX">$∂Ω$</span> denotes the <a href="boundary_(topology)" title="wikilink">boundary</a> of the region <span class="LaTeX">$Ω$</span>. Thus, in the case that <span class="LaTeX">$ω$</span> is a 0-form and <span class="LaTeX">$Ω$</span> is a closed interval of the real line, this reduces to the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>. In the case that <span class="LaTeX">$ω$</span> is a 1-form and <span class="LaTeX">$Ω$</span> is a two-dimensional region in the plane, the theorem reduces to <a href="Green's_theorem" title="wikilink">Green's theorem</a>. Similarly, using 2-forms, and 3-forms and <a href="Hodge_dual" title="wikilink">Hodge duality</a>, we can arrive at <a href="Stokes'_theorem" title="wikilink">Stokes' theorem</a> and the <a href="divergence_theorem" title="wikilink">divergence theorem</a>. In this way we can see that differential forms provide a powerful unifying view of integration.</p>
<h3 id="summations">Summations</h3>
<p>The discrete equivalent of integration is <a class="uri" href="summation" title="wikilink">summation</a>. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of <a href="Lebesgue_integral" title="wikilink">Lebesgue integrals</a> or <a href="time_scale_calculus" title="wikilink">time scale calculus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation</h2>
<h3 id="analytical">Analytical</h3>
<p>The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_calculus" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>. Let <span class="LaTeX">$f ( x )$</span> be the function of <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> to be integrated over a given interval <span class="LaTeX">$a a , b$</span>. Then, find an antiderivative of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>; that is, a function <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$F ′ = f$</span> on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no <a href="Mathematical_singularity" title="wikilink">singularities</a> on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\textstyle\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b)-F(a).$$</span></p>
<p>The integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals.</p>
<p>The most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>. It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include:</p>

<p>Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many <a href="nonelementary_integral" title="wikilink">nonelementary integrals</a> can be expanded in a <a href="Taylor_series" title="wikilink">Taylor series</a> and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using <a href="Meijer_G-function" title="wikilink">Meijer G-functions</a> can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, <a href="Parseval's_identity" title="wikilink">Parseval's identity</a> can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see <a href="Gaussian_integral" title="wikilink">Gaussian integral</a>.</p>
<p>Computations of volumes of <a href="solid_of_revolution" title="wikilink">solids of revolution</a> can usually be done with <a href="disk_integration" title="wikilink">disk integration</a> or <a href="shell_integration" title="wikilink">shell integration</a>.</p>
<p>Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the <a href="Lists_of_integrals" title="wikilink">list of integrals</a>.</p>
<h3 id="symbolic">Symbolic</h3>
<p>Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive <a href="Lists_of_integrals" title="wikilink">tables of integrals</a> have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of <a href="computer" title="wikilink">computers</a>, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to <a href="computer_algebra_system" title="wikilink">computer algebra systems</a> that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like <a class="uri" href="Macsyma" title="wikilink">Macsyma</a>.</p>
<p>A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions <mtpl></mtpl> and <span class="LaTeX">$(sin x )/ x$</span> cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only <a href="rational_function" title="wikilink">rational</a> and <a href="exponential_function" title="wikilink">exponential</a> functions, <a class="uri" href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithm</a>, <a href="trigonometric_function" title="wikilink">trigonometric</a> and <a href="inverse_trigonometric_function" title="wikilink">inverse trigonometric functions</a>, and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in <a href="elementary_function" title="wikilink">elementary functions</a>, which are the functions which may be built from rational functions, <a href="Root_of_a_function" title="wikilink">roots of a polynomial</a>, logarithm, and exponential functions. The <a href="Risch_algorithm" title="wikilink">Risch algorithm</a> provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The <a href="Risch_algorithm" title="wikilink">Risch algorithm</a>, implemented in <a class="uri" href="Mathematica" title="wikilink">Mathematica</a> and other <a href="computer_algebra_system" title="wikilink">computer algebra systems</a>, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions, <a href="Nth_root" title="wikilink">radicals</a>, logarithm, and exponential functions.</p>
<p>Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the <a href="special_functions" title="wikilink">special functions</a> of <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> (like the <a href="Associated_Legendre_function" title="wikilink">Legendre functions</a>, the <a href="hypergeometric_function" title="wikilink">hypergeometric function</a>, the <a href="Gamma_function" title="wikilink">Gamma function</a>, the <a href="Incomplete_Gamma_function" title="wikilink">Incomplete Gamma function</a> and so on — see <a href="Symbolic_integration" title="wikilink">Symbolic integration</a> for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.</p>
<p>More recently a new approach has emerged, using <a href="D-finite_function" title="wikilink"><em>D</em>-finite function</a>, which are the solutions of <a href="linear_differential_equation" title="wikilink">linear differential equations</a> with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are <em>D</em>-finite and the integral of a <em>D</em>-finite function is also a <em>D</em>-finite function. This provide an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a <em>D</em>-finite function as the solution of a differential equation.</p>
<p>This theory allows also to compute a definite integrals of a <em>D</em>-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients and an algorithm to compute any coefficient.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="numerical">Numerical</h3>
<p>The integrals encountered in a basic calculus course are deliberately chosen for simplicity; those found in real applications are not always so accommodating. Some integrals cannot be found exactly, some require special functions which themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical methods for approximating integrals, which today use <a href="Floating_point" title="wikilink">floating-point arithmetic</a> on digital electronic computers. Many of the ideas arose much earlier, for hand calculations; but the speed of general-purpose computers like the <a class="uri" href="ENIAC" title="wikilink">ENIAC</a> created a need for improvements.</p>
<p>The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality. Sophisticated methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures (; ; ). Consider, for example, the integral</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_{-2}^{2} \tfrac{1}{5} \left( \tfrac{1}{100}(322 + 3 x (98 + x (37 + x))) - 24 \frac{x}{1+x^2} \right) dx$$</span> which has the exact answer . (In ordinary practice the answer is not known in advance, so an important task — not explored here — is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A “calculus book” approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.</p>

<p> Using the left end of each piece, the <a href="rectangle_method" title="wikilink">rectangle method</a> sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width, <span class="LaTeX">$h$</span>, here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2<sup>18</sup> pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.</p>
<p>A better approach replaces the horizontal tops of the rectangles with slanted tops touching the function at the ends of each piece. This <a href="trapezium_rule" title="wikilink">trapezium rule</a> is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2<sup>10</sup> pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="Romberg's_method" title="wikilink">Romberg's method</a> builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by <mtpl></mtpl>, and so on, where <mtpl></mtpl> is half of <mtpl></mtpl>. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to <a href="Interpolation" title="wikilink">interpolate</a> a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to <span class="LaTeX">$T (0)$</span>. With this method a numerically <em>exact</em> answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The <a href="Lagrange_polynomial" title="wikilink">Lagrange polynomial</a> interpolating  {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148<mtpl></mtpl>, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at <span class="LaTeX">$h = 0$</span>.</p>
<p><a href="Gaussian_quadrature" title="wikilink">Gaussian quadrature</a> often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> positions, <span class="LaTeX">$±2 ⁄ \sqrt{3}$</span>, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in error analysis, and a little luck. An <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span>-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to <span class="LaTeX">$2 n − 1$</span>. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)</p>
<p>Shifting the range left a little, so the integral is from −2.25 to 1.75, removes the symmetry. Nevertheless, the trapezoid method is rather slow, the polynomial interpolation method of Romberg is acceptable, and the Gaussian method requires the least work — if the number of points is known in advance. As well, rational interpolation can use the same trapezoid evaluations as the Romberg method to greater effect.</p>

<p>In practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular <a href="Gauss–Kronrod_quadrature_formula" title="wikilink">Gauss–Kronrod quadrature formulae</a>. Symmetry can still be exploited by splitting this integral into two ranges, from −2.25 to −1.75 (no symmetry), and from −1.75 to 1.75 (symmetry). More broadly, <a href="adaptive_quadrature" title="wikilink">adaptive quadrature</a> partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most.</p>
<p><a href="Simpson's_rule" title="wikilink">Simpson's rule</a>, named for <a href="Thomas_Simpson" title="wikilink">Thomas Simpson</a> (1710–1761), uses a parabolic curve to approximate integrals. In many cases, it is more accurate than the <a href="trapezoidal_rule" title="wikilink">trapezoidal rule</a> and others. The rule states that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{b-a}{6}\left[f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)+f(b)\right],$$</span> with an error of</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\left|-\frac{(b-a)^5}{2880} f^{(4)}(\xi)\right|.$$</span></p>
<p>The computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as <a href="Monte_Carlo_integration" title="wikilink">Monte Carlo integration</a>.</p>
<p>A calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage.</p>
