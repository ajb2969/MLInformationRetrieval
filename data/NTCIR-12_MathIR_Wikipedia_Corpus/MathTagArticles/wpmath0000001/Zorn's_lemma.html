<h1>Zorn's lemma</h1>
<hr/>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Zorn's lemma can be used to show that every connected <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> has a <a href="spanning_tree" title="wikilink">spanning tree</a>. The set of all sub-graphs that are trees is ordered by inclusion, and the union of a chain is an upper bound. Zorn's lemma says that a maximal tree must exist, which is a spanning tree since the graph is connected. Zorn's lemma is not needed for finite graphs, such as the one pictured here.</figcaption>

<p><strong>Zorn's lemma</strong>, also known as the <strong>Kuratowski–Zorn lemma</strong>, is a proposition of <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a> that states:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Suppose a <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered set</a> <em>P</em> has the property that every chain (i.e. <a href="Total_order" title="wikilink">totally ordered</a> <a class="uri" href="subset" title="wikilink">subset</a>) has an <a href="upper_bound" title="wikilink">upper bound</a> in <em>P</em>. Then the set <em>P</em> contains at least one <a href="maximal_element" title="wikilink">maximal element</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is named after the <a href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematicians</a> <a href="Max_August_Zorn" title="wikilink">Max Zorn</a> and <a href="Kazimierz_Kuratowski" title="wikilink">Kazimierz Kuratowski</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The terms used in the statement of the <a href="Lemma_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">lemma</a> are defined as follows. Suppose (<em>P</em>,≤) is a <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered set</a>. A subset <em>T</em> is <em>totally ordered</em> if for any <em>s</em>, <em>t</em> in <em>T</em> we have <em>s</em> ≤ <em>t</em> or <em>t</em> ≤ <em>s</em>. Such a set <em>T</em> has an <em>upper bound</em> <em>u</em> in <em>P</em> if <em>t</em> ≤ <em>u</em> for all <em>t</em> in <em>T</em>. Note that <em>u</em> is an element of <em>P</em> but need not be an element of <em>T</em>. An element <em>m</em> of <em>P</em> is called a <em>maximal element</em> (or <em>non-dominated</em>) if there is no element <em>x</em> in <em>P</em> for which <em>m</em>  Suppose a non-empty partially ordered set <em>P</em> has the property that every non-empty chain has an upper bound in <em>P</em>. Then the set <em>P</em> contains at least one maximal element.</p>

<p>The distinction may seem subtle, but proofs involving Zorn's lemma often involve taking a union of some sort to produce an upper bound. The case of an empty chain, hence empty union is a boundary case that is easily overlooked.</p>

<p>Zorn's lemma is equivalent to the <a href="well-ordering_theorem" title="wikilink">well-ordering theorem</a> and the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a>, in the sense that any one of them, together with the <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_axioms" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms</a> of <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>, is sufficient to prove the others. It occurs in the proofs of several theorems of crucial importance, for instance the <a href="Hahn–Banach_theorem" title="wikilink">Hahn–Banach theorem</a> in <a href="functional_analysis" title="wikilink">functional analysis</a>, the theorem that every <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> has a <a href="basis_(linear_algebra)" title="wikilink">basis</a>, <a href="Tychonoff's_theorem" title="wikilink">Tychonoff's theorem</a> in <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> stating that every product of <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact spaces</a> is compact, and the theorems in <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a> that every nonzero <a href="ring_(algebra)" title="wikilink">ring</a> has a <a href="maximal_ideal" title="wikilink">maximal ideal</a> and that every <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> has an <a href="algebraic_closure" title="wikilink">algebraic closure</a>.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Zorn's lemma can be used to show that every nontrivial ring <em>R</em> with <a href="Unital_ring" title="wikilink">unity</a> contains a <a href="maximal_ideal" title="wikilink">maximal ideal</a>. In the terminology above, the set <em>P</em> consists of all (two-sided) <a href="ideal_(ring_theory)" title="wikilink">ideals</a> in <em>R</em> except <em>R</em> itself, which is not empty since it contains at least the trivial ideal {0}. This set is partially ordered by <a href="subset" title="wikilink">set inclusion</a>. Finding a maximal ideal is the same as finding a maximal element in <em>P</em>. The ideal <em>R</em> was excluded because maximal ideals by definition are not equal to <em>R</em>.</p>

<p>To apply Zorn's lemma, take a non-empty totally ordered subset <em>T</em> of <em>P</em>. It is necessary to show that <em>T</em> has an upper bound, i.e. that there exists an ideal <em>I</em> ⊆ <em>R</em> which is bigger than all members of <em>T</em> but still smaller than <em>R</em> (otherwise it would not be in <em>P</em>). Take <em>I</em> to be the <a href="union_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">union</a> of all the ideals in <em>T</em>. Because <em>T</em> contains at least one element, and that element contains at least 0, the union <em>I</em> contains at least 0 and is not empty. To prove that <em>I</em> is an ideal, note that if <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are elements of <em>I</em>, then there exist two ideals <em>J</em>, <em>K</em> ∈ <em>T</em> such that <em>a</em> is an element of <em>J</em> and <em>b</em> is an element of <em>K</em>. Since <em>T</em> is totally ordered, we know that <em>J</em> ⊆ <em>K</em> or <em>K</em> ⊆ <em>J</em>. In the first case, both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are members of the ideal <em>K</em>, therefore their sum <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> is a member of <em>K</em>, which shows that <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> is a member of <em>I</em>. In the second case, both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are members of the ideal <em>J</em>, and thus <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> ∈ <em>I</em>. Furthermore, if <em>r</em> ∈ <em>R</em>, then <em>ar</em> and <em>ra</em> are elements of <em>J</em> and hence elements of <em>I</em>. Thus, <em>I</em> is an ideal in <em>R</em>.</p>

<p>Now, an ideal is equal to <em>R</em> <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> it contains 1. (It is clear that if it is equal to <em>R</em>, then it must contain 1; on the other hand, if it contains 1 and <em>r</em> is an arbitrary element of <em>R</em>, then <em>r1</em> = <em>r</em> is an element of the ideal, and so the ideal is equal to <em>R</em>.) So, if <em>I</em> were equal to <em>R</em>, then it would contain 1, and that means one of the members of <em>T</em> would contain 1 and would thus be equal to <em>R</em> – but <em>R</em> is explicitly excluded from <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>The condition of Zorn's lemma has been checked, and thus there is a maximal element in <em>P</em>, in other words a maximal ideal in <em>R</em>.</p>

<p>Note that the proof depends on the fact that our ring <em>R</em> has a multiplicative unit 1. Without this, the proof wouldn't work and indeed the statement would be false. For example, the ring with

<h2 id="sketch-of-proof">Sketch of proof</h2>

<p>A sketch of the proof of Zorn's lemma follows, assuming the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a>. Suppose the lemma is false. Then there exists a partially ordered set, or poset, <em>P</em> such that every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, and every element has a bigger one. For every totally ordered subset <em>T</em> we may then define a bigger element <em>b</em>(<em>T</em>), because <em>T</em> has an upper bound, and that upper bound has a bigger element. To actually define the <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> <em>b</em>, we need to employ the axiom of choice.</p>

<p>Using the function <em>b</em>, we are going to define elements <em>a</em><sub>0</sub> 1 2 3 i'' are defined by <a href="transfinite_recursion" title="wikilink">transfinite recursion</a>: we pick <em>a</em><sub>0</sub> in <em>P</em> arbitrary (this is possible, since <em>P</em> contains an upper bound for the empty set and is thus not empty) and for any other ordinal <em>w</em> we set <em>a</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> = <em>b</em>({<em>a</em><sub><em>v</em></sub>: <em>v</em> <em>v</em> are totally ordered, this is a well-founded definition.</p>

<p>This proof shows that actually a slightly stronger version of Zorn's lemma is true: </p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The <a href="Hausdorff_maximal_principle" title="wikilink">Hausdorff maximal principle</a> is an early statement similar to Zorn's lemma.</p>

<p><a href="Kazimierz_Kuratowski" title="wikilink">K. Kuratowski</a> proved in 1922<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> a version of the lemma close to its modern formulation (it applied to sets ordered by inclusion and closed under unions of well-ordered chains). Essentially the same formulation (weakened by using arbitrary chains, not just well-ordered) was independently given by <a href="Max_August_Zorn" title="wikilink">Max Zorn</a> in 1935,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> who proposed it as a new <a class="uri" href="axiom" title="wikilink">axiom</a> of set theory replacing the well-ordering theorem, exhibited some of its applications in algebra, and promised to show its equivalence with the axiom of choice in another paper, which never appeared.</p>

<p>The name "Zorn's lemma" appears to be due to <a href="John_Tukey" title="wikilink">John Tukey</a>, who used it in his book <em>Convergence and Uniformity in Topology</em> in 1940. <a class="uri" href="Bourbaki" title="wikilink">Bourbaki</a>'s <em>Théorie des Ensembles</em> of 1939 refers to a similar maximal principle as "le théorème de Zorn".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The name "<a href=":pl:lemat_Kuratowskiego-Zorna" title="wikilink">Kuratowski–Zorn lemma</a>" prevails in Poland and Russia.</p>
<h2 id="equivalent-forms-of-zorns-lemma">Equivalent forms of Zorn's lemma</h2>

<p>Zorn's lemma is equivalent (in <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">ZF</a>) to three main results:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="Hausdorff_maximal_principle" title="wikilink">Hausdorff maximal principle</a></li>
<li><a href="Axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">Axiom of choice</a></li>
<li><a href="Well-ordering_theorem" title="wikilink">Well-ordering theorem</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Moreover, Zorn's lemma (or one of its equivalent forms) implies some major results in other mathematical areas. For example,</p>
<ol>
<li>Banach's extension theorem which is used to prove one of the most fundamental results in functional analysis, the <a href="Hahn–Banach_theorem" title="wikilink">Hahn–Banach theorem</a></li>
<li>Every vector space has a <a href="Hamel_basis" title="wikilink">Hamel basis</a>, a result from linear algebra (to which it is equivalent<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>)</li>
<li>Every commutative unital ring has a <a href="maximal_ideal" title="wikilink">maximal ideal</a>, a result from ring theory</li>
<li><a href="Tychonoff's_theorem" title="wikilink">Tychonoff's theorem</a> in topology (to which it is also equivalent<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>)</li>

<p>In this sense, we see how Zorn's lemma can be seen as a powerful tool, especially in the sense of unified mathematics.</p>
