<h1>Rheology</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Rheology</strong> (; from <a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Greek</a> ῥέω <em>rhéō</em>, "flow" and -λoγία, -<em>logia</em>, "study of") is the study of the flow of matter, primarily in a liquid state, but also as 'soft solids' or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It applies to substances which have a complex microstructure, such as <a href="mud" title="wikilink">muds</a>, <a href="sludge" title="wikilink">sludges</a>, <a href="Suspension_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">suspensions</a>, <a href="polymer" title="wikilink">polymers</a> and other <a href="Glass_transition" title="wikilink">glass formers</a> (<em>e.g.,</em> silicates), as well as many foods and additives, <a href="bodily_fluid" title="wikilink">bodily fluids</a> (<em>e.g.,</em> blood) and other biological materials or other materials which belong to the class of <a href="soft_matter" title="wikilink">soft matter</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Newtonian_fluids" title="wikilink">Newtonian fluids</a> can be characterized by a single coefficient of <a class="uri" href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscosity</a> for a specific temperature. Although this viscosity will change with temperature, it does not change with the <a href="strain_rate" title="wikilink">strain rate</a>. Only a small group of fluids exhibit such constant viscosity. The large class of fluids whose viscosity changes with the strain rate (the relative <a href="flow_velocity" title="wikilink">flow velocity</a>) are called non-Newtonian fluids.</p>

<p>Rheology generally accounts for the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strain or strain rates. For example, <a class="uri" href="ketchup" title="wikilink">ketchup</a> can have its viscosity reduced by shaking (or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, like <a class="uri" href="yoghurt" title="wikilink">yoghurt</a> and <a class="uri" href="emulsion" title="wikilink">emulsion</a> <a class="uri" href="paint" title="wikilink">paint</a> (US terminology <a href="latex_paint" title="wikilink">latex paint</a> or <a href="acrylic_paint" title="wikilink">acrylic paint</a>), exhibiting <a class="uri" href="thixotropy" title="wikilink">thixotropy</a>, where an increase in relative flow velocity will cause a reduction in viscosity, for example, by stirring. Some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior: viscosity going up with relative deformation, which are called shear thickening or <a class="uri" href="dilatant" title="wikilink">dilatant</a> materials. Since Sir <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a> originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain rate dependent viscosity is also often called <em><a href="non-Newtonian_fluid" title="wikilink">Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The term <em><a href="wikt:rheology" title="wikilink">rheology</a></em> was coined by <a href="Eugene_C._Bingham" title="wikilink">Eugene C. Bingham</a>, a professor at <a href="Lafayette_College" title="wikilink">Lafayette College</a>, in 1920, from a suggestion by a colleague, <a href="Markus_Reiner" title="wikilink">Markus Reiner</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The term was inspired by the <a class="uri" href="aphorism" title="wikilink">aphorism</a> of <a href="Simplicius_of_Cilicia" title="wikilink">Simplicius</a> (often attributed to <a class="uri" href="Heraclitus" title="wikilink">Heraclitus</a>), <em><a href='Heraclitus#Panta_rhei,_"everything_flows"' title="wikilink">panta rhei</a>,</em> "everything flows"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The experimental characterization of a material's rheological behaviour is known as <em><a class="uri" href="rheometry" title="wikilink">rheometry</a></em>, although the term <em>rheology</em> is frequently used synonymously with rheometry, particularly by experimentalists. Theoretical aspects of rheology are the relation of the flow/deformation behaviour of material and its internal structure (e.g., the orientation and elongation of polymer molecules), and the flow/deformation behaviour of materials that cannot be described by classical fluid mechanics or elasticity.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending <a href="continuum_mechanics" title="wikilink">continuum mechanics</a> to characterize flow of materials, that exhibits a combination of elastic, viscous and plastic behavior by properly combining <a href="theory_of_elasticity" title="wikilink">elasticity</a> and (<a href="Newtonian_fluid" title="wikilink">Newtonian</a>) <a href="fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">fluid mechanics</a>. It is also concerned with establishing predictions for mechanical behavior (on the continuum mechanical scale) based on the micro- or nanostructure of the material, e.g. the <a href="Molecule" title="wikilink">molecular</a> size and architecture of <a href="polymer" title="wikilink">polymers</a> in solution or the particle size distribution in a solid suspension. Materials with the characteristics of a fluid will flow when subjected to a <a href="Stress_(physics)" title="wikilink">stress</a> which is defined as the force per area. There are different sorts of stress (e.g. shear, torsional, etc.) and materials can respond differently for different stresses. Much of theoretical rheology is concerned with associating external forces and torques with internal stresses and internal strain gradients and flow velocities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>

<p>Rheology unites the seemingly unrelated fields of <a href="plasticity_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasticity</a> and <a href="non-Newtonian_fluid" title="wikilink">non-Newtonian fluid</a> dynamics by recognizing that materials undergoing these types of deformation are unable to support a stress (particularly a <a href="shear_stress" title="wikilink">shear stress</a>, since it is easier to analyze shear deformation) in static <a href="Mechanical_equilibrium" title="wikilink">equilibrium</a>. In this sense, a solid undergoing plastic deformation is a <a class="uri" href="fluid" title="wikilink">fluid</a>, although no viscosity coefficient is associated with this flow. Granular rheology refers to the continuum mechanical description of <a href="granular_material" title="wikilink">granular materials</a>.</p>

<p>One of the major tasks of rheology is to empirically establish the relationships between <a href="Strain_(materials_science)" title="wikilink">deformations</a> (or rates of deformation) and stresses, by adequate measurements, although a number of theoretical developments (such as assuring frame invariants) are also required before using the empirical data. These experimental techniques are known as <a class="uri" href="rheometry" title="wikilink">rheometry</a> and are concerned with the determination with well-defined <em>rheological material functions</em>. Such relationships are then amenable to mathematical treatment by the established methods of <a href="continuum_mechanics" title="wikilink">continuum mechanics</a>.</p>

<p>The characterization of flow or deformation originating from a simple shear stress field is called shear rheometry (or shear rheology). The study of extensional flows is called extensional rheology. Shear flows are much easier to study and thus much more experimental data are available for shear flows than for extensional flows.</p>
<h2 id="rheologist">Rheologist</h2>

<p>A rheologist is an <a class="uri" href="interdisciplinary" title="wikilink">interdisciplinary</a> scientist or engineer who studies the flow of complex liquids or the deformation of soft solids. It is not a primary degree subject; there is no qualification of rheologist as such. Most rheologists have a qualification in mathematics, the physical sciences (e.g. <a class="uri" href="chemistry" title="wikilink">chemistry</a>, <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>, <a class="uri" href="biology" title="wikilink">biology</a>), engineering (e.g. <a href="Mechanical_engineering" title="wikilink">mechanical</a>, <a href="Chemical_engineering" title="wikilink">chemical</a>, <a href="Materials_science" title="wikilink">materials science and engineering</a> or <a href="civil_engineering" title="wikilink">civil engineering</a>), <a class="uri" href="medicine" title="wikilink">medicine</a>, or certain technologies, notably <a href="Materials_science" title="wikilink">materials</a> or <a href="Food_science" title="wikilink">food</a>. Typically, a small amount of rheology may be studied when obtaining a degree, but a person working in rheology will extend this knowledge during postgraduate research or by attending short courses and by joining a professional association (see below).</p>
<h2 id="viscoelasticity">Viscoelasticity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fluid and solid character are relevant at long times:<br/>
We consider the application of a constant stress (a so-called <em>creep experiment</em>):
<ul>
<li>if the material, after some deformation, eventually resists further deformation, it is considered a solid</li>
<li>if, by contrast, the material flows indefinitely, it is considered a fluid</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By contrast, <em>elastic and viscous</em> (or intermediate, <a class="uri" href="viscoelastic" title="wikilink">viscoelastic</a>) behaviour is relevant at short times (<em>transient behaviour</em>):<br/>
We again consider the application of a constant stress:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>if the material deformation strain increases linearly with increasing applied stress, then the material is linear elastic within the range it shows recoverable strains. Elasticity is essentially a time independent processes, as the strains appear the moment the stress is applied, without any time delay.</li>
<li>if the material deformation rate increases linearly with increasing applied stress, then the material is viscous in the Newtonian sense. These materials are characterized due to the time delay between the applied constant stress and the maximum strain.</li>
<li>if the materials behaves as a combination of viscous and elastic components, then the material is viscoelastic. Theoretically such materials can show both instantaneous deformation as elastic material and a delayed time dependent deformation as in fluids.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="Plasticity_(physics)" title="wikilink">Plasticity</a> is the behavior observed after the material is subjected to a <em>yield stress</em>:<br/>
A material that behaves as a solid under low applied stresses may start to flow above a certain level of stress, called the <em><a href="yield_stress" title="wikilink">yield stress</a></em> of the material. The term <em>plastic solid</em> is often used when this plasticity threshold is rather high, while <em>yield stress fluid</em> is used when the threshold stress is rather low. However, there is no fundamental difference between the two concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>Rheology has applications in <a href="materials_science" title="wikilink">materials science</a> <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, <a class="uri" href="geophysics" title="wikilink">geophysics</a>, <a class="uri" href="physiology" title="wikilink">physiology</a>, human <a class="uri" href="biology" title="wikilink">biology</a> and <a class="uri" href="pharmaceutics" title="wikilink">pharmaceutics</a>. <a href="Materials_science" title="wikilink">Materials science</a> is utilized in the production of many industrially important substances, such as <a class="uri" href="cement" title="wikilink">cement</a>, <a class="uri" href="paint" title="wikilink">paint</a>, and <a class="uri" href="chocolate" title="wikilink">chocolate</a>, which have complex flow characteristics. In addition, <a href="Plasticity_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasticity</a> theory has been similarly important for the design of metal forming processes. The science of rheology and the characterization of viscoelastic properties in the production and use of <a href="polymer" title="wikilink">polymeric</a> materials has been critical for the production of many products for use in both the industrial and military sectors. Study of flow properties of liquids is important for pharmacists working in the manufacture of several dosage forms, such as simple liquids, ointments, creams, pastes etc. The flow behavior of liquids under applied stress is of great relevance in the field of pharmacy. Flow properties are used as important quality control tools to maintain the superiority of the product and reduce batch to batch variations.</p>

<h4 id="polymers">Polymers</h4>

<p>Examples may be given to illustrate the potential applications of these principles to practical problems in the processing<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and use of rubbers, plastics, and fibers. Polymers constitute the basic materials of the rubber and plastic industries and are of vital importance to the textile, petroleum, automobile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Their viscoelastic properties determine the mechanical performance of the final products of these industries, and also the success of processing methods at intermediate stages of production.</p>

<p>In <a href="Viscoelasticity" title="wikilink">viscoelastic</a> materials, such as most <a href="polymer" title="wikilink">polymers</a> and plastics, the presence of liquid-like behaviour depends on the properties of and so varies with rate of applied load, i.e., how quickly a force is applied. The <a class="uri" href="silicone" title="wikilink">silicone</a> toy '<a href="Silly_Putty" title="wikilink">Silly Putty</a>' behaves quite differently depending on the time rate of applying a force. Pull on it slowly and it exhibits continuous flow, similar to that evidenced in a highly viscous liquid. Alternatively, when hit hard and directly, it shatters like a silicate glass.</p>

<p>In addition, conventional <a class="uri" href="rubber" title="wikilink">rubber</a> undergoes a <a href="glass_transition" title="wikilink">glass transition</a>, (often called a <em>rubber-glass transition</em>). E.G. The <a href="Space_Shuttle_Challenger" title="wikilink">Space Shuttle Challenger</a> disaster was caused by rubber O-rings that were being used well below their glass transition temperature on an unusually cold Florida morning, and thus could not flex adequately to form proper seals between sections of the two <a href="Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster" title="wikilink">solid-fuel rocket boosters</a>.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Geophysics" title="wikilink">Geophysics</a> includes the flow of molten <a class="uri" href="lava" title="wikilink">lava</a> and debris flows (fluid mudslides). Also included in this disciplinary branch are solid Earth materials which only exhibit flow over extended time scales. Those that display viscous behaviour are known as <a href="rheid" title="wikilink">rheids</a>. E.G. <a class="uri" href="granite" title="wikilink">granite</a> can flow plastically with a negligible yield stress at room temperatures, (i.e. a viscous flow). Long term creep experiments (~ 10 years) indicate that the viscosity of granite and glass under ambient conditions are on the order of 10<sup>20</sup> poises.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="physiology">Physiology</h3>

<p>Physiology includes the study of many bodily fluids that have complex structure and composition, and thus exhibit a wide range of viscoelastic flow characteristics. In particular there is a specialist study of blood flow called <a class="uri" href="hemorheology" title="wikilink">hemorheology</a>. This is the study of flow properties of blood and its elements (<a href="Blood_plasma" title="wikilink">plasma</a> and formed elements, including <a href="red_blood_cell" title="wikilink">red blood cells</a>, <a href="white_blood_cell" title="wikilink">white blood cells</a> and <a href="platelet" title="wikilink">platelets</a>). <a href="Blood_viscosity" title="wikilink">Blood viscosity</a> is determined by plasma viscosity, <a class="uri" href="hematocrit" title="wikilink">hematocrit</a> (volume fraction of red blood cell, which constitute 99.9% of the cellular elements) and mechanical behaviour of red blood cells. Therefore, red blood cell mechanics is the major determinant of flow properties of blood.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="food-rheology">Food rheology</h3>

<p><a href="Food_rheology" title="wikilink">Food rheology</a> is important in the manufacture and processing of food products, e.g. cheese.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Thickening_agents" title="wikilink">Thickening agents</a>, or <a class="uri" href="thickeners" title="wikilink">thickeners</a>, are substances which, when added to an aqueous mixture, increase its <a class="uri" href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscosity</a> without substantially modifying its other properties, such as taste. They provide body, increase <a href="strength_of_materials" title="wikilink">stability</a>, and improve <a href="suspension_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">suspension</a> of added ingredients. Thickening agents are often used as <a href="food_additive" title="wikilink">food additives</a> and in <a class="uri" href="cosmetics" title="wikilink">cosmetics</a> and <a href="personal_hygiene_product" title="wikilink">personal hygiene products</a>. Some thickening agents are <strong>gelling agents</strong>, forming a <a class="uri" href="gel" title="wikilink">gel</a>. The agents are materials used to thicken and stabilize liquid solutions, <a href="emulsion" title="wikilink">emulsions</a>, and <a href="suspension_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">suspensions</a>. They dissolve in the liquid phase as a <a class="uri" href="colloid" title="wikilink">colloid</a> mixture that forms a weakly cohesive internal structure. <a href="Food_thickeners" title="wikilink">Food thickeners</a> frequently are based on either <a href="polysaccharide" title="wikilink">polysaccharides</a> (<a href="starch" title="wikilink">starches</a>, <a href="vegetable_gum" title="wikilink">vegetable gums</a>, and <a class="uri" href="pectin" title="wikilink">pectin</a>), or <a href="protein" title="wikilink">proteins</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="concrete-rheology">Concrete rheology</h3>

<p><a class="uri" href="Concrete" title="wikilink">Concrete</a>'s and <a href="Mortar_(masonry)" title="wikilink">mortar</a>'s workability is related to the rheological properties of the fresh <a class="uri" href="cement" title="wikilink">cement</a> paste. The mechanical properties of hardened concrete increase if less water is used in the concrete mix design, however reducing the water-to-cement ratio may decrease the ease of mixing and application. To avoid these undesired effects, <a href="superplasticizer" title="wikilink">superplasticizers</a> are typically added to decrease the apparent yield stress and the viscosity of the fresh paste. Their addition highly improves concrete and mortar properties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filled-polymer-rheology">Filled polymer rheology</h3>

<p>The use of various types of <a href="Filler_(materials)" title="wikilink">fillers</a> incorporated into the <a class="uri" href="polymer" title="wikilink">polymer</a> has become quite common as a means of reducing cost and to impart certain desirable mechanical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties to the polymers. The advantages that filled polymer systems have to offer are normally offset to some extent by the increased complexity in the rheological behavior that is introduced by the inclusion of the fillers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Usually when the use of fillers is considered, a compromise has to be made between the improved mechanical properties in the solid state, the increased difficulty in melt processing, the problem of achieving uniform <a href="dispersion_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">dispersion</a> of the filler in the polymer matrix and the economics of the process due to the added step of compounding. The rheological properties of filled polymers are determined, not only by the type of the filler, but also by its size, shape, size distribution and amount. A key factor in the use of fillers without affecting the material properties is the <a href="stress_(mechanics)" title="wikilink">stress</a> transfer at the filler-polymer interface. The interfacial adhesion can be substantially enhanced via a coupling agent that adheres well to both the polymer and the filler particles. The type and amount of <a href="surface_treatment" title="wikilink">surface treatment</a> on the filler are thus additional parameters affecting the rheological properties of filled polymeric systems.</p>
<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>

<p><a href="Rheometer" title="wikilink">Rheometers</a> are instruments used to characterize the rheological properties of materials, typically fluids that are melts or solution. These instruments impose a specific stress field or deformation to the fluid, and monitor the resultant deformation or stress. Instruments can be run in steady flow or oscillatory flow, in both shear and extension.</p>

<p>In 1932 Fritz Höppler got a patent for the Falling Ball viscometer, named after him – the worldwide first viscometer to determine the dynamic viscosity.</p>
<h2 id="dimensionless-numbers">Dimensionless numbers</h2>
<h3 id="deborah-number">Deborah number</h3>

<p>On one end of the spectrum we have an <a href="inviscid_flow" title="wikilink">inviscid</a> or a simple Newtonian fluid and on the other end, a rigid solid; thus the behaviour of all materials fall somewhere in between these two ends. The difference in material behaviour is characterized by the level and nature of elasticity present in the material when it deforms, which takes the material behaviour to the non-Newtonian regime. The non-dimensional Deborah number is designed to account for the degree of non-Newtonian behaviour in a flow. The Deborah number is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time of relaxation (which purely depends on the material and other conditions like the temperature) to the characteristic time of experiment or observation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Small Deborah numbers represent Newtonian flow, while non-Newtonian (with both viscous and elastic effects present) behaviour occurs for intermediate range Deborah numbers, and high Deborah numbers indicate an elastic/rigid solid. Since Deborah number is a relative quantity, the numerator or the denominator can alter the number. A very small Deborah number can be obtained for a fluid with extremely small relaxation time or a very large experimental time, for example.</p>
<h3 id="reynolds-number">Reynolds number</h3>

<p>In <a href="fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">fluid mechanics</a>, the <a href="Reynolds_number" title="wikilink">Reynolds number</a> is a measure of the <a class="uri" href="ratio" title="wikilink">ratio</a> of <a href="inertia" title="wikilink">inertial</a> <a href="force" title="wikilink">forces</a> (<em>v<sub>s</sub>ρ</em>) to <a href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscous</a> forces (<em>μ/L</em>) and consequently it quantifies the relative importance of these two types of effect for given flow conditions. Under low Reynolds numbers viscous effects dominate and the flow is <a href="Laminar_flow" title="wikilink">laminar</a>, whereas at high Reynolds numbers inertia predominates and the flow may be <a class="uri" href="turbulent" title="wikilink">turbulent</a>. However, since rheology is concerned with fluids which do not have a fixed viscosity, but one which can vary with flow and time, calculation of the Reynolds number can be complicated.</p>

<p>It is one of the most important <a href="dimensionless_number" title="wikilink">dimensionless numbers</a> in <a href="fluid_dynamics" title="wikilink">fluid dynamics</a> and is used, usually along with other dimensionless numbers, to provide a criterion for determining <a href="dynamic_similitude" title="wikilink">dynamic similitude</a>. When two geometrically similar flow patterns, in perhaps different fluids with possibly different flow rates, have the same values for the relevant dimensionless numbers, they are said to be dynamically similar.</p>
