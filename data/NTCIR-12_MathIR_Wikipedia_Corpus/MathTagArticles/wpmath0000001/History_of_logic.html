<h1>History of logic</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>history of logic</strong> is the study of the development of the science of valid inference (<a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a>). Formal logic was developed in ancient times in <a href="Logic_in_China" title="wikilink">China</a>, <a href="Indian_logic" title="wikilink">India</a>, and <a href="Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">Greece</a>. Greek logic, particularly <a href="Aristotelian_logic" title="wikilink">Aristotelian logic</a>, found wide application and acceptance in science and mathematics.</p>

<p>Aristotle's logic was further developed by <a href="Logic_in_Islamic_philosophy" title="wikilink">Islamic</a> and <a href="Christian_philosophy" title="wikilink">Christian</a> philosophers in the <a href="Medieval_philosophy#High_Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a>, reaching a high point in the mid-fourteenth century. The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century was largely one of decline and neglect, and is regarded as barren by at least one historian of logic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Logic was revived in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period when the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. The development of the modern "symbolic" or "mathematical" logic during this period is the most significant in the two-thousand-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Progress in <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> in the first few decades of the twentieth century, particularly arising from the work of <a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Gödel</a> and <a href="Alfred_Tarski" title="wikilink">Tarski</a>, had a significant impact on <a href="analytic_philosophy" title="wikilink">analytic philosophy</a> and <a href="philosophical_logic" title="wikilink">philosophical logic</a>, particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as <a href="modal_logic" title="wikilink">modal logic</a>, <a href="temporal_logic" title="wikilink">temporal logic</a>, <a href="deontic_logic" title="wikilink">deontic logic</a>, and <a href="relevance_logic" title="wikilink">relevance logic</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prehistory-of-logic">Prehistory of logic</h2>

<p>Valid reasoning has been employed in all periods of human history. However, logic studies the <em>principles</em> of valid reasoning, inference and demonstration. It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, which originally meant the same as "land measurement".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In particular, the <a href="ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">ancient Egyptians</a> had <a href="empirical" title="wikilink">empirically</a> discovered <a href="Egyptian_mathematics" title="wikilink">some truths of geometry</a>, such as the formula for the volume of a <a href="Frustum" title="wikilink">truncated pyramid</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Another origin can be seen in <a class="uri" href="Babylonia" title="wikilink">Babylonia</a>. <a class="uri" href="Esagil-kin-apli" title="wikilink">Esagil-kin-apli</a>'s medical <em>Diagnostic Handbook</em> in the 11th century BC was based on a logical set of <a href="axiom" title="wikilink">axioms</a> and assumptions,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> while <a href="Babylonian_astronomy" title="wikilink">Babylonian astronomers</a> in the 8th and 7th centuries BC employed an <a href="internal_logic" title="wikilink">internal logic</a> within their predictive planetary systems, an important contribution to the <a href="philosophy_of_science" title="wikilink">philosophy of science</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="logic-in-greek-philosophy">Logic in Greek philosophy</h2>
<h3 id="before-plato">Before Plato</h3>

<p>While the ancient Egyptians empirically discovered some truths of geometry, the great achievement of the ancient Greeks was to replace empirical methods by demonstrative science. The systematic study of this seems to have begun with the school of <a class="uri" href="Pythagoras" title="wikilink">Pythagoras</a> in the late sixth century BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The three basic principles of geometry are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain propositions must be accepted as true without demonstration; such a proposition is known as an <a class="uri" href="axiom" title="wikilink">axiom</a> of geometry.</li>
<li>Every proposition that is not an axiom of geometry must be demonstrated as following from the axioms of geometry; such a demonstration is known as a <a class="uri" href="proof" title="wikilink">proof</a> or a "derivation" of the proposition.</li>
<li>The proof must be <em>formal</em>; that is, the derivation of the proposition must be independent of the particular subject matter in question.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Fragments of early proofs are preserved in the works of Plato and Aristotle,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and the idea of a deductive system was probably known in the Pythagorean school and the <a href="Platonic_Academy" title="wikilink">Platonic Academy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Separately from geometry, the idea of a standard argument pattern is found in the method of proof known as <em><a href="reductio_ad_absurdum" title="wikilink">reductio ad absurdum</a></em>, which was used by <a href="Zeno_of_Elea" title="wikilink">Zeno of Elea</a>, a <a class="uri" href="pre-Socratic" title="wikilink">pre-Socratic</a> philosopher of the fifth century BC. This is the technique of drawing an obviously false (that is, "absurd") conclusion from an assumption, thus demonstrating that the assumption is false.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Plato's <a href="Parmenides_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Parmenides</a> portrays Zeno as claiming to have written a book defending the <a class="uri" href="monism" title="wikilink">monism</a> of Parmenides by demonstrating the absurd consequence of assuming that there is plurality. Other philosophers who practised such <em>dialectic</em> reasoning were the "minor Socratics", including <a href="Euclid_of_Megara" title="wikilink">Euclid of Megara</a>, who were probably followers of Parmenides and Zeno. The members of this school were called "dialecticians" (from a Greek word meaning "to discuss").</p>

<p>Further evidence that pre-Aristotelian thinkers were concerned with the principles of reasoning is found in the fragment called <em><a href="dissoi_logoi" title="wikilink">dissoi logoi</a></em>, probably written at the beginning of the fourth century BC. This is part of a protracted debate about truth and falsity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>In the case of the classical Greek city-states, interest in argumentation was also stimulated by the activities of the <a href="Rhetoric" title="wikilink">Rhetoricians</a> or Orators and the <a class="uri" href="Sophists" title="wikilink">Sophists</a>, who used arguments to defend or attack a thesis, both in legal and political contexts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="platos-logic">Plato's logic</h3>

<p>None of the surviving works of the great fourth-century philosopher <a class="uri" href="Plato" title="wikilink">Plato</a> (428–347 BC) include any formal logic,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> but they include important contributions to the field of <a href="philosophical_logic" title="wikilink">philosophical logic</a>. Plato raises three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is it that can properly be called true or false?</li>
<li>What is the nature of the connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion?</li>
<li>What is the nature of definition?</li>
</ul>

<p>The first question arises in the dialogue <em><a href="Theaetetus_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Theaetetus</a></em>, where Plato identifies thought or opinion with talk or discourse (<em>logos</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The second question is a result of Plato's <a href="theory_of_Forms" title="wikilink">theory of Forms</a>. Forms are not things in the ordinary sense, nor strictly ideas in the mind, but they correspond to what philosophers later called <a class="uri" href="universals" title="wikilink">universals</a>, namely an abstract entity common to each set of things that have the same name. In both the <em><a href="The_Republic_(Plato)" title="wikilink">Republic</a></em> and the <em><a href="Sophist_(dialogue)" title="wikilink">Sophist</a></em>, Plato suggests that the necessary connection between the assumptions of a valid argument and its conclusion corresponds to a necessary connection between "forms".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The third question is about <a class="uri" href="definition" title="wikilink">definition</a>. Many of Plato's dialogues concern the search for a definition of some important concept (justice, truth, the Good), and it is likely that Plato was impressed by the importance of definition in mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> What underlies every definition is a Platonic Form, the common nature present in different particular things. Thus, a definition reflects the ultimate object of understanding, and is the foundation of all valid inference. This had a great influence on Aristotle, in particular Aristotle's notion of the <a class="uri" href="essence" title="wikilink">essence</a> of a thing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="aristotles-logic">Aristotle's logic</h3>

<p> The logic of <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>, and particularly his theory of the <a class="uri" href="syllogism" title="wikilink">syllogism</a>, has had an enormous influence in <a href="Western_thought" title="wikilink">Western thought</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> His logical works, called the <em><a class="uri" href="Organon" title="wikilink">Organon</a></em>, are the earliest formal study of logic that have come down to modern times. Though it is difficult to determine the dates, the probable order of writing of Aristotle's logical works is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="Categories_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">The Categories</a></em>, a study of the ten kinds of primitive term.</li>
<li><em><a href="Topics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">The Topics</a></em> (with an appendix called <em><a href="On_Sophistical_Refutations" title="wikilink">On Sophistical Refutations</a></em>), a discussion of dialectics.</li>
<li><em><a href="De_Interpretatione" title="wikilink">On Interpretation</a></em>, an analysis of simple <a href="categorical_proposition" title="wikilink">categorical propositions</a> into simple terms, negation, and signs of quantity. It also contains a comprehensive treatment of the notions of <a href="Square_of_opposition" title="wikilink">opposition</a> and conversion; chapter 7 is at the origin of the <a href="square_of_opposition" title="wikilink">square of opposition</a> (or logical square); chapter 9 contains the beginning of <a href="modal_logic" title="wikilink">modal logic</a>.</li>
<li><em><a href="Prior_Analytics" title="wikilink">The Prior Analytics</a></em>, a formal analysis of what makes a <a class="uri" href="syllogism" title="wikilink">syllogism</a> (a valid argument, according to Aristotle).</li>
<li><em><a href="Posterior_Analytics" title="wikilink">The Posterior Analytics</a></em>, a study of scientific demonstration, containing Aristotle's mature views on logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>These works are of outstanding importance in the history of logic. Aristotle was the first logician to attempt a systematic analysis of <a href="logical_syntax" title="wikilink">logical syntax</a>, of noun (or <em><a href="terminology" title="wikilink">term</a></em>), and of verb. In the <em>Categories</em>, he attempts to discern all the possible things to which a term can refer; this idea underpins his philosophical work <em><a href="Metaphysics_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">Metaphysics</a></em>, which itself had a profound influence on Western thought. He was the first to deal with the principles of <a href="Principle_of_contradiction" title="wikilink">contradiction</a> and <a href="Law_of_excluded_middle" title="wikilink">excluded middle</a> in a systematic way. He was the first <em>formal logician</em>, in that he demonstrated the principles of reasoning by employing variables to show the underlying <a href="logical_form" title="wikilink">logical form</a> of an argument. He was looking for relations of dependence which characterise necessary inference, and distinguished the <a class="uri" href="validity" title="wikilink">validity</a> of these relations, from the truth of the premises (the <a class="uri" href="soundness" title="wikilink">soundness</a> of the argument). The <em>Prior Analytics</em> contains his exposition of the "syllogism", where three important principles are applied for the first time in history: the use of variables, a purely formal treatment, and the use of an axiomatic system. He also developed a theory of non-formal logic (<em>i.e.,</em> the theory of fallacies), which is presented in <em>Topics</em> and <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="stoic-logic">Stoic logic</h3>

<p> The other great school of Greek logic is that of the <a href="Stoicism" title="wikilink">Stoics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Stoic logic traces its roots back to the late 5th century BC philosopher <a href="Euclid_of_Megara" title="wikilink">Euclid of Megara</a>, a pupil of <a class="uri" href="Socrates" title="wikilink">Socrates</a> and slightly older contemporary of Plato. His pupils and successors were called "<a href="Megarian_school" title="wikilink">Megarians</a>", or "Eristics", and later the "Dialecticians". The two most important dialecticians of the Megarian school were <a href="Diodorus_Cronus" title="wikilink">Diodorus Cronus</a> and <a href="Philo_the_Dialectician" title="wikilink">Philo</a>, who were active in the late 4th century BC. The Stoics adopted the Megarian logic and systemized it. The most important member of the school was <a class="uri" href="Chrysippus" title="wikilink">Chrysippus</a> (c. 278–c. 206 BC), who was its third head, and who formalized much of Stoic doctrine. He is supposed to have written over 700 works, including at least 300 on logic, almost none of which survive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Unlike with Aristotle, we have no complete works by the Megarians or the early Stoics, and have to rely mostly on accounts (sometimes hostile) by later sources, including prominently <a href="Diogenes_Laertius" title="wikilink">Diogenes Laertius</a>, <a href="Sextus_Empiricus" title="wikilink">Sextus Empiricus</a>, <a class="uri" href="Galen" title="wikilink">Galen</a>, <a href="Aulus_Gellius" title="wikilink">Aulus Gellius</a>, <a href="Alexander_of_Aphrodisias" title="wikilink">Alexander of Aphrodisias</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Cicero" title="wikilink">Cicero</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Three significant contributions of the Stoic school were (i) their account of <a href="Modal_logic" title="wikilink">modality</a>, (ii) their theory of the <a href="Material_conditional" title="wikilink">Material conditional</a>, and (iii) their account of <a href="Meaning_(philosophy_of_language)" title="wikilink">meaning</a> and <a class="uri" href="truth" title="wikilink">truth</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Modality</em>. According to Aristotle, the Megarians of his day claimed there was no distinction between <a href="Potentiality_and_actuality_(Aristotle)" title="wikilink">potentiality and actuality</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Diodorus Cronus defined the possible as that which either is or will be, the impossible as what will not be true, and the contingent as that which either is already, or will be false.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Diodorus is also famous for what is known as his <a href="Master_argument_(Diodorus_Cronus)" title="wikilink">Master argument</a>, which states that each pair of the following 3 propositions contradicts the third proposition:</li>
</ul>

<p>:* Everything that is past is true and necessary.</p>

<p>:* The impossible does not follow from the possible.</p>

<p>:* What neither is nor will be is possible.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Diodorus used the plausibility of the first two to prove that nothing is possible if it neither is nor will be true.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Chrysippus, by contrast, denied the second premise and said that the impossible could follow from the possible.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><em>Conditional statements</em>. The first logicians to debate <a href="Material_conditional" title="wikilink">conditional statements</a> were Diodorus and his pupil Philo of Megara. Sextus Empiricus refers three times to a debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true <a href="antecedent_(logic)" title="wikilink">antecedent</a> and a false <a class="uri" href="consequent" title="wikilink">consequent</a>. Precisely, let <em>T<sub>0</sub></em> and <em>T<sub>1</sub></em> be true statements, and let <em>F<sub>0</sub></em> and <em>F<sub>1</sub></em> be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):</li>
</ul>

<p>:* If <em>T<sub>0</sub></em>, then <em>T<sub>1</sub></em></p>

<p>:* If <em>F<sub>0</sub></em>, then <em>T<sub>0</sub></em></p>

<p>:* If <em>F<sub>0</sub></em>, then <em>F<sub>1</sub></em></p>
<dl>
<dd>The following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:
<ul>
<li>If ''T<sub>0</sub>, then <em>F<sub>0</sub></em></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Indeed, Sextus says "According to [Philo], there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a <a class="uri" href="truth-functional" title="wikilink">truth-functional</a> definition of "if ... then"; it is the definition used in <a href="predicate_logic" title="wikilink">modern logic</a>.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> A century later, the <a href="Stoicism" title="wikilink">Stoic</a> philosopher <a class="uri" href="Chrysippus" title="wikilink">Chrysippus</a> attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><em>Meaning and truth</em>. The most important and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern <a href="propositional_logic" title="wikilink">propositional logic</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Stoics distinguished between utterance (<em>phone</em>), which may be noise, speech (<em>lexis</em>), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (<em>logos</em>), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory is the idea that what is expressed by a sentence, called a <em>lekton</em>, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a <em>proposition</em>. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word <em>Dion</em>, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="logic-in-asia">Logic in Asia</h2>
<h3 id="logic-in-india">Logic in India</h3>

<p>Logic began independently in <a href="History_of_India" title="wikilink">ancient India</a> and continued to develop to early modern times without any known influence from Greek logic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> <a href="Medhatithi_Gautama" title="wikilink">Medhatithi Gautama</a> (c. 6th century BC) founded the <em>anviksiki</em> school of logic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> The <em><a class="uri" href="Mahabharata" title="wikilink">Mahabharata</a></em> (12.173.45), around the 5th century BC, refers to the <em>anviksiki</em> and <em>tarka</em> schools of logic.  (c. 5th century BC) developed a form of logic (to which <a href="Boolean_logic" title="wikilink">Boolean logic</a> has some similarities) for his formulation of <a href="Vyakarana" title="wikilink">Sanskrit grammar</a>. Logic is described by <a class="uri" href="Chanakya" title="wikilink">Chanakya</a> (c. 350-283 BC) in his <em><a class="uri" href="Arthashastra" title="wikilink">Arthashastra</a></em> as an independent field of inquiry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>Two of the six Indian schools of thought deal with logic: <a class="uri" href="Nyaya" title="wikilink">Nyaya</a> and <a class="uri" href="Vaisheshika" title="wikilink">Vaisheshika</a>. The <a href="Nyaya_Sutras" title="wikilink">Nyaya Sutras</a> of <a href="Aksapada_Gautama" title="wikilink">Aksapada Gautama</a> (c. 2nd century AD) constitute the core texts of the Nyaya school, one of the six orthodox schools of <a class="uri" href="Hindu" title="wikilink">Hindu</a> philosophy. This <a href="Philosophical_realism" title="wikilink">realist</a> school developed a rigid five-member schema of <a class="uri" href="inference" title="wikilink">inference</a> involving an initial premise, a reason, an example, an application, and a conclusion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The <a href="Idealism" title="wikilink">idealist</a> <a href="Buddhist_philosophy" title="wikilink">Buddhist philosophy</a> became the chief opponent to the Naiyayikas. <a class="uri" href="Nagarjuna" title="wikilink">Nagarjuna</a> (c. 150-250 AD), the founder of the <a class="uri" href="Madhyamika" title="wikilink">Madhyamika</a> ("Middle Way") developed an analysis known as the <a class="uri" href="catuṣkoṭi" title="wikilink">catuṣkoṭi</a> (Sanskrit), a "four-cornered" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination and rejection of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, <em>P</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>P</em>; that is, being.</li>
<li>not <em>P</em>; that is, not being.</li>
<li><em>P</em> and not <em>P</em>; that is, being and not being.</li>
<li>not (<em>P</em> or not <em>P</em>); that is, neither being nor not being.It is interesting to note that under <a href="propositional_logic" title="wikilink">propositional logic</a>, <a href="De_Morgan's_laws" title="wikilink">De Morgan's laws</a> imply that this is equivalent to the third case (<em>P</em> and not <em>P</em>), and is therefore superfluous; there are actually only 3 cases to consider.
</li>
</ol>

<p>However, <a class="uri" href="Dignaga" title="wikilink">Dignaga</a> (c 480-540 AD) is sometimes said to have developed a formal syllogism,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and it was through him and his successor, <a class="uri" href="Dharmakirti" title="wikilink">Dharmakirti</a>, that <a href="Buddhist_logic" title="wikilink">Buddhist logic</a> reached its height; it is contested whether their analysis actually constitutes a formal syllogistic system. In particular, their analysis centered on the definition of an inference-warranting relation, "<a class="uri" href="vyapti" title="wikilink">vyapti</a>", also known as invariable concomitance or pervasion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> To this end, a doctrine known as "apoha" or differentiation was developed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> This involved what might be called inclusion and exclusion of defining properties.</p>

<p>The difficulties involved in this enterprise, in part, stimulated the neo-scholastic school of <a class="uri" href="Navya-Nyāya" title="wikilink">Navya-Nyāya</a>, which developed a formal analysis of inference in the sixteenth century. This later school began around <a href="East_India" title="wikilink">eastern India</a> and <a class="uri" href="Bengal" title="wikilink">Bengal</a>, and developed theories resembling modern logic, such as <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Gottlob Frege</a>'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number," as well as the Navya-Nyaya theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as <a href="Charles_Babbage" title="wikilink">Charles Babbage</a>, <a href="Augustus_De_Morgan" title="wikilink">Augustus De Morgan</a>, and particularly <a href="George_Boole" title="wikilink">George Boole</a>, as confirmed by his wife <a href="Mary_Everest_Boole" title="wikilink">Mary Everest Boole</a>, who wrote in 1901 an "open letter to Dr Bose", which was titled "Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century" and stated:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> "Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830-1865".</p>

<p>Dignāga's famous "wheel of reason" (<em><a class="uri" href="Hetucakra" title="wikilink">Hetucakra</a></em>) is a method of indicating when one thing (such as smoke) can be taken as an invariable sign of another thing (like fire), but the inference is often inductive and based on past observation. Matilal remarks that Dignāga's analysis is much like John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition, the traditional five-member Indian syllogism, though deductively valid, has repetitions that are unnecessary to its logical validity. As a result, some commentators see the traditional Indian syllogism as a rhetorical form that is entirely natural in many cultures of the world, and yet not as a logical form—not in the sense that all logically unnecessary elements have been omitted for the sake of analysis.</p>

<p>"Medieval logic" (also known as "Scholastic logic") generally means the form of <a href="Organon" title="wikilink">Aristotelian logic</a> developed in <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval Europe</a> throughout roughly the period 1200–1600.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> For centuries after Stoic logic had been formulated, it was the dominant system of logic in the classical world. When the study of logic resumed after the <a href="Dark_Ages_(historiography)" title="wikilink">Dark Ages</a>, the main source was the work of the Christian philosopher <a class="uri" href="Boethius" title="wikilink">Boethius</a>, who was familiar with some of Aristotle's logic, but almost none of the work of the Stoics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Until the twelfth century, the only works of Aristotle available in the West were the <em>Categories</em>, <em>On Interpretation</em>, and Boethius's translation of the <a class="uri" href="Isagoge" title="wikilink">Isagoge</a> of <a href="Porphyry_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Porphyry</a> (a commentary on the Categories). These works were known as the "Old Logic" (<em>Logica Vetus</em> or <em>Ars Vetus</em>). An important work in this tradition was the <em>Logica Ingredientibus</em> of <a href="Peter_Abelard" title="wikilink">Peter Abelard</a> (1079–1142). His direct influence was small,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> but his influence through pupils such as <a href="John_of_Salisbury" title="wikilink">John of Salisbury</a> was great, and his method of applying rigorous logical analysis to theology shaped the way that theological criticism developed in the period that followed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>

<p>By the early thirteenth century, the remaining works of Aristotle's <em>Organon</em> (including the <em><a href="Prior_Analytics" title="wikilink">Prior Analytics</a></em>, <em><a href="Posterior_Analytics" title="wikilink">Posterior Analytics</a></em>, and the <em><a href="Sophistical_Refutations" title="wikilink">Sophistical Refutations</a></em>) had been recovered in the West.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> Logical work until then was mostly paraphrasis or commentary on the work of Aristotle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The period from the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the fourteenth century was one of significant developments in logic, particularly in three areas which were original, with little foundation in the Aristotelian tradition that came before. These were:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The theory of <a href="Supposition_theory" title="wikilink">supposition</a>. Supposition theory deals with the way that predicates (<em>e.g.,</em> 'man') range over a domain of individuals (<em>e.g.,</em> all men).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> In the proposition 'every man is an animal', does the term 'man' range over or 'supposit for' men existing just in the present, or does the range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual? Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order logic</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> "The theory of supposition with the associated theories of <em>copulatio</em> (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), <em>ampliatio</em> (widening of referential domain), and <em>distributio</em> constitute one of the most original achievements of Western medieval logic".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The theory of <a href="Syncategorematic_term" title="wikilink">syncategoremata</a>. Syncategoremata are terms which are necessary for logic, but which, unlike <em>categorematic</em> terms, do not signify on their own behalf, but 'co-signify' with other words. Examples of syncategoremata are 'and', 'not', 'every', 'if', and so on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The theory of <a href="Logical_consequence" title="wikilink">consequences</a>. A consequence is a hypothetical, conditional proposition: two propositions joined by the terms 'if ... then'. For example 'if a man runs, then God exists' (<em>Si homo currit, Deus est</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> A fully developed theory of consequences is given in Book III of <a href="William_of_Ockham" title="wikilink">William of Ockham</a>'s work <a href="Summa_Logicae" title="wikilink">Summa Logicae</a>. There, Ockham distinguishes between 'material' and 'formal' consequences, which are roughly equivalent to the modern <a href="Material_conditional" title="wikilink">material implication</a> and <a href="logical_implication" title="wikilink">logical implication</a> respectively. Similar accounts are given by <a href="Jean_Buridan" title="wikilink">Jean Buridan</a> and <a href="Albert_of_Saxony" title="wikilink">Albert of Saxony</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last great works in this tradition are the <em>Logic</em> of John Poinsot (1589–1644, known as <a href="John_of_St_Thomas" title="wikilink">John of St Thomas</a>), the <em>Metaphysical Disputations</em> of <a href="Francisco_Suarez" title="wikilink">Francisco Suarez</a> (1548–1617), and the <em>Logica Demonstrativa</em> of <a href="Giovanni_Girolamo_Saccheri" title="wikilink">Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri</a> (1667–1733).</p>
<h2 id="traditional-logic">Traditional logic</h2>
<h3 id="the-textbook-tradition">The textbook tradition</h3>

<p> <em>Traditional logic</em> generally means the textbook tradition that begins with <a href="Antoine_Arnauld" title="wikilink">Antoine Arnauld</a>'s and <a href="Pierre_Nicole" title="wikilink">Pierre Nicole</a>'s <em>Logic, or the Art of Thinking</em>, better known as the <em><a href="Port-Royal_Logic" title="wikilink">Port-Royal Logic</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic in England until the nineteenth century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval <a href="term_logic" title="wikilink">term logic</a>. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> The account of <a href="proposition" title="wikilink">propositions</a> that <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">Locke</a> gives in the <em>Essay</em> is essentially that of Port-Royal: "Verbal propositions, which are words, [are] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for agree or disagree." (Locke, <em>An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>, IV. 5. 6)</p>

<p>Another influential work was the <em><a href="Novum_Organum" title="wikilink">Novum Organum</a></em> by <a href="Francis_Bacon" title="wikilink">Francis Bacon</a>, published in 1620. The title translates as "new instrument". This is a reference to <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>'s work known as the <em><a class="uri" href="Organon" title="wikilink">Organon</a></em>. In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle in favor of an alternative procedure "which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> This method is known as <a href="inductive_reasoning" title="wikilink">inductive reasoning</a>, a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced. For example, in finding the cause of a <em>phenomenal nature</em> such as heat, 3 lists should be constructed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence list: a list of every situation where heat is found.</li>
<li>The absence list: a list of every situation that is similar to at least one of those of the presence list, except for the lack of heat.</li>
<li>The variability list: a list of every situation where heat can vary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, the <em>form nature</em> (or cause) of heat may be defined as that which is common to every situation of the presence list, and which is lacking from every situation of the absence list, and which varies by degree in every situation of the variability list.</p>

<p>Other works in the textbook tradition include <a href="Isaac_Watts" title="wikilink">Isaac Watts</a>'s <em>Logick: Or, the Right Use of Reason</em> (1725), <a href="Richard_Whately" title="wikilink">Richard Whately</a>'s <em>Logic</em> (1826), and <a href="John_Stuart_Mill" title="wikilink">John Stuart Mill</a>'s <em>A System of Logic</em> (1843). Although the latter was one of the last great works in the tradition, Mill's view that the foundations of logic lie in introspection<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> influenced the view that logic is best understood as a branch of psychology, a view which dominated the next fifty years of its development, especially in Germany.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="logic-in-hegels-philosophy">Logic in Hegel's philosophy</h3>

<p> <a href="G.W.F._Hegel" title="wikilink">G.W.F. Hegel</a> indicated the importance of logic to his philosophical system when he condensed his extensive <em><a href="Science_of_Logic" title="wikilink">Science of Logic</a></em> into a shorter work published in 1817 as the first volume of his <em>Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences.</em> The "Shorter" or "Encyclopaedia" <em>Logic</em>, as it is often known, lays out a series of transitions which leads from the most empty and abstract of categories—Hegel begins with "Pure Being" and "Pure Nothing"—to the "<a href="Absolute_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">Absolute</a>, the category which contains and resolves all the categories which preceded it. Despite the title, Hegel's <em>Logic</em> is not really a contribution to the science of valid inference. Rather than deriving conclusions about concepts through valid inference from premises, Hegel seeks to show that thinking about one concept compels thinking about another concept (one cannot, he argues, possess the concept of "Quality" without the concept of "Quantity"); this compulsion is, supposedly, not a matter of individual psychology, because it arises almost organically from the content of the concepts themselves. His purpose is to show the rational structure of the "Absolute"—indeed of rationality itself. The method by which thought is driven from one concept to its contrary, and then to further concepts, is known as the Hegelian <a class="uri" href="dialectic" title="wikilink">dialectic</a>.</p>

<p>Although Hegel's <em>Logic</em> has had little impact on mainstream logical studies, its influence can be seen elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Karl_von_Prantl" title="wikilink">Carl von Prantl</a>'s <em>Geschichte der Logik in Abendland</em> (1855–1867).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></li>
<li>The work of the <a href="British_Idealism" title="wikilink">British Idealists</a>, such as F.H. Bradley's <em>Principles of Logic</em> (1883).</li>
<li>The economic, political, and philosophical studies of <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a>, and in the various schools of <a class="uri" href="Marxism" title="wikilink">Marxism</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logic-and-psychology">Logic and psychology</h3>

<p>Between the work of Mill and Frege stretched half a century during which logic was widely treated as a descriptive science, an empirical study of the structure of reasoning, and thus essentially as a branch of <a class="uri" href="psychology" title="wikilink">psychology</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> The German psychologist <a href="Wilhelm_Wundt" title="wikilink">Wilhelm Wundt</a>, for example, discussed deriving "the logical from the psychological laws of thought", emphasizing that "psychological thinking is always the more comprehensive form of thinking."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> This view was widespread among German philosophers of the period:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Theodor_Lipps" title="wikilink">Theodor Lipps</a> described logic as "a specific discipline of psychology".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Christoph_von_Sigwart" title="wikilink">Christoph von Sigwart</a> understood logical necessity as grounded in the individual's compulsion to think in a certain way.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Benno_Erdmann" title="wikilink">Benno Erdmann</a> argued that "logical laws only hold within the limits of our thinking".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Such was the dominant view of logic in the years following Mill's work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> This psychological approach to logic was rejected by <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Gottlob Frege</a>. It was also subjected to an extended and destructive critique by <a href="Edmund_Husserl" title="wikilink">Edmund Husserl</a> in the first volume of his <em>Logical Investigations</em> (1900), an assault which has been described as "overwhelming".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> Husserl argued forcefully that grounding logic in psychological observations implied that all logical truths remained unproven, and that <a class="uri" href="skepticism" title="wikilink">skepticism</a> and <a class="uri" href="relativism" title="wikilink">relativism</a> were unavoidable consequences.</p>

<p>Such criticisms did not immediately extirpate what is called "<a class="uri" href="psychologism" title="wikilink">psychologism</a>". For example, the American philosopher <a href="Josiah_Royce" title="wikilink">Josiah Royce</a>, while acknowledging the force of Husserl's critique, remained "unable to doubt" that progress in psychology would be accompanied by progress in logic, and vice versa.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rise-of-modern-logic">Rise of modern logic</h2>

<p>The period between the fourteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century had been largely one of decline and neglect, and is generally regarded as barren by historians of logic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> The revival of logic occurred in the mid-nineteenth century, at the beginning of a revolutionary period where the subject developed into a rigorous and formalistic discipline whose exemplar was the exact method of proof used in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. The development of the modern "symbolic" or "mathematical" logic during this period is the most significant in the 2000-year history of logic, and is arguably one of the most important and remarkable events in human intellectual history.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>

<p>A number of features distinguish modern logic from the old Aristotelian or traditional logic, the most important of which are as follows:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Modern logic is fundamentally a <em>calculus</em> whose rules of operation are determined only by the <em>shape</em> and not by the <em>meaning</em> of the symbols it employs, as in mathematics. Many logicians were impressed by the "success" of mathematics, in that there had been no prolonged dispute about any truly mathematical result. <a href="Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="wikilink">C.S. Peirce</a> noted<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> that even though a mistake in the evaluation of a definite integral by <a class="uri" href="Laplace" title="wikilink">Laplace</a> led to an error concerning the moon's orbit that persisted for nearly 50 years, the mistake, once spotted, was corrected without any serious dispute. Peirce contrasted this with the disputation and uncertainty surrounding traditional logic, and especially reasoning in <a class="uri" href="metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysics</a>. He argued that a truly "exact" logic would depend upon mathematical, i.e., "diagrammatic" or "iconic" thought. "Those who follow such methods will ... escape all error except such as will be speedily corrected after it is once suspected". Modern logic is also "constructive" rather than "abstractive"; i.e., rather than abstracting and formalising theorems derived from ordinary language (or from psychological intuitions about validity), it constructs theorems by formal methods, then looks for an interpretation in ordinary language. It is entirely symbolic, meaning that even the logical constants (which the medieval logicians called "<a href="Syncategorematic_term" title="wikilink">syncategoremata</a>") and the categoric terms are expressed in symbols.</p>
<h2 id="periods-of-modern-logic">Periods of modern logic</h2>

<p>The development of modern logic falls into roughly five periods:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>embryonic period</strong> from <a href="Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Leibniz</a> to 1847, when the notion of a logical calculus was discussed and developed, particularly by Leibniz, but no schools were formed, and isolated periodic attempts were abandoned or went unnoticed.</li>
<li>The <strong>algebraic period</strong> from <a class="uri" href="Boole" title="wikilink">Boole</a>'s Analysis to <a href="Ernst_Schröder" title="wikilink">Schröder</a>'s <em>Vorlesungen</em>. In this period, there were more practitioners, and a greater continuity of development.</li>
<li>The <strong><a class="uri" href="logicist" title="wikilink">logicist</a> period</strong> from the <a class="uri" href="Begriffsschrift" title="wikilink">Begriffsschrift</a> of <a class="uri" href="Frege" title="wikilink">Frege</a> to the <em><a href="Principia_Mathematica" title="wikilink">Principia Mathematica</a></em> of <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Russell</a> and <a href="A.N._Whitehead" title="wikilink">Whitehead</a>. The aim of the "logicist school" was to incorporate the logic of all mathematical and scientific discourse in a single unified system which, taking as a fundamental principle that all mathematical truths are logical, did not accept any non-logical terminology. The major logicists were <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Frege</a>, <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Russell</a>, and the early <a href="Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="wikilink">Wittgenstein</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> It culminates with the <em>Principia</em>, an important work which includes a thorough examination and attempted solution of the <a href="antinomy" title="wikilink">antinomies</a> which had been an obstacle to earlier progress.</li>
<li>The <strong>metamathematical period</strong> from 1910 to the 1930s, which saw the development of <a class="uri" href="metalogic" title="wikilink">metalogic</a>, in the <a class="uri" href="finitist" title="wikilink">finitist</a> system of <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">Hilbert</a>, and the non-finitist system of <a href="Leopold_Löwenheim" title="wikilink">Löwenheim</a> and <a class="uri" href="Skolem" title="wikilink">Skolem</a>, the combination of logic and metalogic in the work of <a class="uri" href="Gödel" title="wikilink">Gödel</a> and <a href="Alfred_Tarski" title="wikilink">Tarski</a>. Gödel's <a href="incompleteness_theorem" title="wikilink">incompleteness theorem</a> of 1931 was one of the greatest achievements in the history of logic. Later in the 1930s, Gödel developed the notion of <a href="set-theoretic_constructibility" title="wikilink">set-theoretic constructibility</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>period after World War II</strong>, when <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>, <a href="proof_theory" title="wikilink">proof theory</a>, <a href="computability_theory" title="wikilink">computability theory</a>, and <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>, and its ideas and methods began to influence <a class="uri" href="philosophy" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="embryonic-period">Embryonic period</h3>

<p> The idea that inference could be represented by a purely mechanical process is found as early as <a href="Ramon_Llull" title="wikilink">Raymond Llull</a>, who proposed a (somewhat eccentric) method of drawing conclusions by a system of concentric rings. The work of logicians such as the <a href="Oxford_Calculators" title="wikilink">Oxford Calculators</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> led to a method of using letters instead of writing out logical calculations (<em>calculationes</em>) in words, a method used, for instance, in the <em>Logica magna</em> by <a href="Paul_of_Venice" title="wikilink">Paul of Venice</a>. Three hundred years after Llull, the English philosopher and logician <a href="Thomas_Hobbes" title="wikilink">Thomas Hobbes</a> suggested that all logic and reasoning could be reduced to the mathematical operations of addition and subtraction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The same idea is found in the work of <a href="Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" title="wikilink">Leibniz</a>, who had read both Llull and Hobbes, and who argued that logic can be represented through a combinatorial process or calculus. But, like Llull and Hobbes, he failed to develop a detailed or comprehensive system, and his work on this topic was not published until long after his death. Leibniz says that ordinary languages are subject to "countless ambiguities" and are unsuited for a calculus, whose task is to expose mistakes in inference arising from the forms and structures of words;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> hence, he proposed to identify an <a href="alphabet_of_human_thought" title="wikilink">alphabet of human thought</a> comprising fundamental concepts which could be composed to express complex ideas,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> and create a <em>calculus ratiocinator</em> that would make all arguments "as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Joseph_Diaz_Gergonne" title="wikilink">Gergonne</a> (1816) said that reasoning does not have to be about objects about which one has perfectly clear ideas, because algebraic operations can be carried out without having any idea of the meaning of the symbols involved.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> <a href="Bernard_Bolzano" title="wikilink">Bolzano</a> anticipated a fundamental idea of modern proof theory when he defined logical consequence or "deducibility" in terms of variables:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is now known as <a href="semantic_validity" title="wikilink">semantic validity</a>.</p>
<h3 id="algebraic-period">Algebraic period</h3>

<p> Modern logic begins with what is known as the "algebraic school", originating with Boole and including <a href="Charles_Sanders_Peirce" title="wikilink">Peirce</a>, <a href="William_Stanley_Jevons" title="wikilink">Jevons</a>, <a href="Ernst_Schröder" title="wikilink">Schröder</a>, and <a href="John_Venn" title="wikilink">Venn</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a> Their objective was to develop a calculus to formalise reasoning in the area of classes, propositions, and probabilities. The school begins with Boole's seminal work <em>Mathematical Analysis of Logic</em> which appeared in 1847, although <a href="Augustus_De_Morgan" title="wikilink">De Morgan</a> (1847) is its immediate precursor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> The fundamental idea of Boole's system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations. This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in <a href="Lincoln,_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Lincoln, Lincolnshire</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> For example, let x and y stand for classes let the symbol <em>=</em> signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on. Boole calls these <em>elective symbols</em>, i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an <em>elective function</em>, and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an <em>elective equation</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> The theory of elective functions and their "development" is essentially the modern idea of <a href="truth-function" title="wikilink">truth-functions</a> and their expression in <a href="disjunctive_normal_form" title="wikilink">disjunctive normal form</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

<p>Boole's system admits of two interpretations, in class logic, and propositional logic. Boole distinguished between "primary propositions" which are the subject of syllogistic theory, and "secondary propositions", which are the subject of propositional logic, and showed how under different "interpretations" the same algebraic system could represent both. An example of a primary proposition is "All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics." An example of a secondary proposition is "Either all inhabitants are Europeans or they are all Asiatics."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn114" id="fnref114"><sup>114</sup></a> These are easily distinguished in modern propositional calculus, where it is also possible to show that the first follows from the second, but it is a significant disadvantage that there is no way of representing this in the Boolean system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn115" id="fnref115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>

<p>In his <em>Symbolic Logic</em> (1881), <a href="John_Venn" title="wikilink">John Venn</a> used diagrams of overlapping areas to express Boolean relations between classes or truth-conditions of propositions. In 1869 Jevons realised that Boole's methods could be mechanised, and constructed a "logical machine" which he showed to the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> the following year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn116" id="fnref116"><sup>116</sup></a> In 1885 <a href="Allan_Marquand" title="wikilink">Allan Marquand</a> proposed an electrical version of the machine that is still extant (<a href="http://finelib.princeton.edu/instruction/wri172_demonstration.php">picture at the Firestone Library</a>).</p>

<p>The defects in Boole's system (such as the use of the letter <em>v</em> for existential propositions) were all remedied by his followers. Jevons published <em>Pure Logic, or the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity</em> in 1864, where he suggested a symbol to signify <a href="exclusive_or" title="wikilink">exclusive or</a>, which allowed Boole's system to be greatly simplified.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> This was usefully exploited by Schröder when he set out theorems in parallel columns in his <em>Vorlesungen</em> (1890–1905). Peirce (1880) showed how all the Boolean elective functions could be expressed by the use of a single primitive binary operation, "<a href="Logical_NOR" title="wikilink">neither ... nor ...</a>" and equally well "<a href="Sheffer_stroke" title="wikilink">not both ... and ...</a>",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a> however, like many of Peirce's innovations, this remained unknown or unnoticed until <a href="Henry_M._Sheffer" title="wikilink">Sheffer</a> rediscovered it in 1913.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> Boole's early work also lacks the idea of the <a href="logical_sum" title="wikilink">logical sum</a> which originates in Peirce (1867), <a href="Ernst_Schröder" title="wikilink">Schröder</a> (1877) and Jevons (1890),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn120" id="fnref120"><sup>120</sup></a> and the concept of <a href="Inclusion_(logic)" title="wikilink">inclusion</a>, first suggested by Gergonne (1816) and clearly articulated by Peirce (1870).</p>

<p>The success of Boole's algebraic system suggested that all logic must be capable of algebraic representation, and there were attempts to express a logic of relations in such form, of which the most ambitious was Schröder's monumental <em>Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik</em> ("Lectures on the Algebra of Logic", vol iii 1895), although the original idea was again anticipated by Peirce.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>Boole's unwavering acceptance of Aristotle's logic is emphasized by the historian of logic <a href="John_Corcoran_(logician)" title="wikilink">John Corcoran</a> in an accessible introduction to <em>Laws of Thought</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a> Corcoran also wrote a point-by-point comparison of <em>Prior Analytics</em> and <em>Laws of Thought</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn123" id="fnref123"><sup>123</sup></a> According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole's goals were "to go under, over, and beyond" Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations, 2) extending the class of problems it could treat — from assessing validity to solving equations — and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle — e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.</p>

<p>More specifically, Boole agreed with what <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a> said; Boole's 'disagreements', if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced the four propositional forms of <a href="Aristotle's_logic" title="wikilink">Aristotle's logic</a> to formulas in the form of equations — by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic — another revolutionary idea — involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the "perfect syllogisms") must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce "No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus" from "No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle" or from "No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle".</p>

<p>After Boole, the next great advances were made by the German mathematician <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Gottlob Frege</a>. Frege's objective was the program of <a class="uri" href="Logicism" title="wikilink">Logicism</a>, i.e. demonstrating that arithmetic is identical with logic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn124" id="fnref124"><sup>124</sup></a> Frege went much further than any of his predecessors in his rigorous and formal approach to logic, and his calculus or <a class="uri" href="Begriffsschrift" title="wikilink">Begriffsschrift</a> is important.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn125" id="fnref125"><sup>125</sup></a> Frege also tried to show that the concept of <a class="uri" href="number" title="wikilink">number</a> can be defined by purely logical means, so that (if he was right) logic includes arithmetic and all branches of mathematics that are reducible to arithmetic. He was not the first writer to suggest this. In his pioneering work <em>Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik</em> (The Foundations of Arithmetic), sections 15–17, he acknowledges the efforts of Leibniz, <a href="J.S._Mill" title="wikilink">J.S. Mill</a> as well as Jevons, citing the latter's claim that "algebra is a highly developed logic, and number but logical discrimination."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn126" id="fnref126"><sup>126</sup></a></p>

<p>Frege's first work, the <em>Begriffsschrift</em> ("concept script") is a rigorously axiomatised system of propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of inference (<em>modus ponens</em> and substitution), and six axioms. Frege referred to the "completeness" of this system, but was unable to prove this.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn127" id="fnref127"><sup>127</sup></a> The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the <a href="Quantifier_(logic)" title="wikilink">quantifier</a> in terms of mathematical functions. Traditional logic regards the sentence "Caesar is a man" as of fundamentally the same form as "all men are mortal." Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as "every Caesar is a man".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn128" id="fnref128"><sup>128</sup></a> Frege argued that the quantifier expression "all men" does not have the same logical or semantic form as "all men", and that the universal proposition "every A is B" is a complex proposition involving two <em>functions</em>, namely ' – is A' and ' – is B' such that whatever satisfies the first, also satisfies the second. In modern notation, this would be expressed as</p>
<dl>
<dd>(x) Ax -&gt; Bx
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In English, "for all x, if Ax then Bx". Thus only singular propositions are of subject-predicate form, and they are irreducibly singular, i.e. not reducible to a general proposition. Universal and particular propositions, by contrast, are not of simple subject-predicate form at all. If "all mammals" were the logical subject of the sentence "all mammals are land-dwellers", then to negate the whole sentence we would have to negate the predicate to give "all mammals are <em>not</em> land-dwellers". But this is not the case.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn129" id="fnref129"><sup>129</sup></a> This functional analysis of ordinary-language sentences later had a great impact on philosophy and <a class="uri" href="linguistics" title="wikilink">linguistics</a>.</p>

<p>This means that in Frege's calculus, Boole's "primary" propositions can be represented in a different way from "secondary" propositions. "All inhabitants are either Europeans or Asiatics" is</p>
<dl>
<dd>(x) [ I(x) -&gt; (E(x) v A(x)) ]
</dd>
</dl>

<p>whereas "All the inhabitants are Europeans or all the inhabitants are Asiatics" is</p>
<dl>
<dd>(x) (I(x) -&gt; E(x)) v (x) (I(x) -&gt; A(x))
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As Frege remarked in a critique of Boole's calculus:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The real difference is that I avoid [the Boolean] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot. In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the mirror image of the other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it'<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn130" id="fnref130"><sup>130</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>As well as providing a unified and comprehensive system of logic, Frege's calculus also resolved the ancient <a href="problem_of_multiple_generality" title="wikilink">problem of multiple generality</a>. The ambiguity of "every girl kissed a boy" is difficult to express in traditional logic, but Frege's logic captures this through the different scope of the quantifiers. Thus</p>
<dl>
<dd>(x) [ girl(x) -&gt; E(y) (boy(y) &amp; kissed(x,y)) ]
</dd>
</dl>

<p>means that to every girl there corresponds some boy (any one will do) who the girl kissed. But</p>
<dl>
<dd>E(x) [ boy(x) &amp; (y) (girl(y) -&gt; kissed(y,x)) ]
</dd>
</dl>

<p>means that there is some particular boy whom every girl kissed. Without this device, the project of logicism would have been doubtful or impossible. Using it, Frege provided a definition of the <a href="ancestral_relation" title="wikilink">ancestral relation</a>, of the <a href="Injective_function" title="wikilink">many-to-one relation</a>, and of <a href="mathematical_induction" title="wikilink">mathematical induction</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn131" id="fnref131"><sup>131</sup></a></p>

<p>This period overlaps with the work of what is known as the "mathematical school", which included <a href="Richard_Dedekind" title="wikilink">Dedekind</a>, <a href="Moritz_Pasch" title="wikilink">Pasch</a>, <a href="Giuseppe_Peano" title="wikilink">Peano</a>, <a href="David_Hilbert" title="wikilink">Hilbert</a>, <a href="Ernst_Zermelo" title="wikilink">Zermelo</a>, <a href="Edward_Vermilye_Huntington" title="wikilink">Huntington</a>, <a href="Oswald_Veblen" title="wikilink">Veblen</a> and <a href="Arend_Heyting" title="wikilink">Heyting</a>. Their objective was the axiomatisation of branches of mathematics like geometry, arithmetic, analysis and set theory.</p>

<p>The logicist project received a near-fatal setback with the discovery of a paradox in 1901 by <a href="Bertrand_Russell" title="wikilink">Bertrand Russell</a>. This proved that the Frege's <a href="naive_set_theory" title="wikilink">naive set theory</a> led to a contradiction. Frege's theory is that for any formal criterion, there is a set of all objects that meet the criterion. Russell showed that a set containing exactly the sets that are not members of themselves would contradict its own definition (if it is not a member of itself, it is a member of itself, and if it is a member of itself, it is not).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn132" id="fnref132"><sup>132</sup></a> This contradiction is now known as <a href="Russell's_paradox" title="wikilink">Russell's paradox</a>. One important method of resolving this paradox was proposed by <a href="Ernst_Zermelo" title="wikilink">Ernst Zermelo</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn133" id="fnref133"><sup>133</sup></a> <a href="Zermelo_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo set theory</a> was the first <a href="axiomatic_set_theory" title="wikilink">axiomatic set theory</a>. It was developed into the now-canonical <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> (ZF).</p>

<p>The monumental <a href="Principia_Mathematica" title="wikilink">Principia Mathematica</a>, a three-volume work on the <a href="foundations_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">foundations of mathematics</a>, written by Russell and <a href="Alfred_North_Whitehead" title="wikilink">Alfred North Whitehead</a> and published 1910–13 also included an attempt to resolve the paradox, by means of an elaborate <a href="system_of_types" title="wikilink">system of types</a>: a set of elements is of a different type than is each of its elements (set is not the element; one element is not the set) and one cannot speak of the "<a href="set_of_all_sets" title="wikilink">set of all sets</a>". The <em>Principia</em> was an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of <a href="axiom" title="wikilink">axioms</a> and <a href="inference_rule" title="wikilink">inference rules</a> in <a href="Mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">symbolic logic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="metamathematical-period">Metamathematical period</h3>

<p> The names of <a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Gödel</a> and <a href="Alfred_Tarski" title="wikilink">Tarski</a> dominate the 1930s,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn134" id="fnref134"><sup>134</sup></a> a crucial period in the development of <a class="uri" href="metamathematics" title="wikilink">metamathematics</a> – the study of mathematics using mathematical methods to produce <a href="metatheory" title="wikilink">metatheories</a>, or mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Early investigations into metamathematics had been driven by <a href="Hilbert's_program" title="wikilink">Hilbert's program</a>. which sought to resolve the ongoing crisis in the foundations of mathematics by grounding all of mathematics to a finite set of axioms, proving its consistency by "finitistic" means and providing a procedure which would decide the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. Work on metamathematics culminated in the work of Gödel, who in 1929 showed that a given <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order sentence</a> is <a href="Provability_logic" title="wikilink">deducible</a> if and only if it is logically valid – i.e. it is true in every <a href="structure_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">structure</a> for its language. This is known as <a href="Gödel's_completeness_theorem" title="wikilink">Gödel's completeness theorem</a>. A year later, he proved two important theorems, which showed Hibert's program to be unattainable in its original form. The first is that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an <a href="Effective_method" title="wikilink">effective procedure</a> such as an <a class="uri" href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithm</a> or computer program is capable of proving all facts about the <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>. For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second is that if such a system is also capable of proving certain basic facts about the natural numbers, then the system cannot prove the consistency of the system itself. These two results are known as <a href="Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems" title="wikilink">Gödel's incompleteness theorems</a>, or simply <em>Gödel's Theorem</em>. Later in the decade, Gödel developed the concept of <a href="set-theoretic_constructibility" title="wikilink">set-theoretic constructibility</a>, as part of his proof that the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a> and the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a> are consistent with <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="proof_theory" title="wikilink">proof theory</a>, <a href="Gerhard_Gentzen" title="wikilink">Gerhard Gentzen</a> developed <a href="natural_deduction" title="wikilink">natural deduction</a> and the <a href="sequent_calculus" title="wikilink">sequent calculus</a>. The former attempts to model logical reasoning as it 'naturally' occurs in practice and is most easily applied to intuitionistic logic, while the latter was devised to clarify the derivation of logical proofs in any formal system. Since Gentzen's work, natural deduction and sequent calculi have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic and computer science. Gentzen also proved normalization and cut-elimination theorems for intuitionistic and classical logic which could be used to reduce logical proofs to a normal form.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn135" id="fnref135"><sup>135</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn136" id="fnref136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Alfred_Tarski" title="wikilink">Alfred Tarski</a>, a pupil of <a href="Jan_Łukasiewicz" title="wikilink">Łukasiewicz</a>, is best known for his definition of truth and <a href="logical_consequence" title="wikilink">logical consequence</a>, and the semantic concept of <a href="Open_sentence" title="wikilink">logical satisfaction</a>. In 1933, he published (in Polish) <em>The concept of truth in formalized languages</em>, in which he proposed his <a href="semantic_theory_of_truth" title="wikilink">semantic theory of truth</a>: a sentence such as "snow is white" is true if and only if snow is white. Tarski's theory separated the <a class="uri" href="metalanguage" title="wikilink">metalanguage</a>, which makes the statement about truth, from the <a href="object_language" title="wikilink">object language</a>, which contains the sentence whose truth is being asserted, and gave a correspondence (the <a class="uri" href="T-schema" title="wikilink">T-schema</a>) between phrases in the object language and elements of an <a href="interpretation_(logic)" title="wikilink">interpretation</a>. Tarski's approach to the difficult idea of explaining truth has been enduringly influential in logic and philosophy, especially in the development of <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn137" id="fnref137"><sup>137</sup></a> Tarski also produced important work on the methodology of deductive systems, and on fundamental principles such as <a href="completeness_(logic)" title="wikilink">completeness</a>, <a href="decidability_(logic)" title="wikilink">decidability</a>, <a class="uri" href="consistency" title="wikilink">consistency</a> and <a href="Structure_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">definability</a>. According to Anita Feferman, Tarski "changed the face of logic in the twentieth century".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn138" id="fnref138"><sup>138</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Alonzo_Church" title="wikilink">Alonzo Church</a> and <a href="Alan_Turing" title="wikilink">Alan Turing</a> proposed formal models of computability, giving independent negative solutions to Hilbert's <em><a class="uri" href="Entscheidungsproblem" title="wikilink">Entscheidungsproblem</a></em> in 1936 and 1937, respectively. The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> asked for a procedure that, given any formal mathematical statement, would algorithmically determine whether the statement is true. Church and Turing proved there is no such procedure; Turing's paper introduced the <a href="halting_problem" title="wikilink">halting problem</a> as a key example of a mathematical problem without an algorithmic solution.</p>

<p>Church's system for computation developed into the modern <a class="uri" href="λ-calculus" title="wikilink">λ-calculus</a>, while the <a href="Turing_machine" title="wikilink">Turing machine</a> became a standard model for a general-purpose computing device. It was soon shown that many other proposed models of computation were equivalent in power to those proposed by Church and Turing. These results led to the <a href="Church–Turing_thesis" title="wikilink">Church–Turing thesis</a> that any deterministic <a class="uri" href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithm</a> that can be carried out by a human can be carried out by a Turing machine. Church proved additional undecidability results, showing that both <a href="Peano_arithmetic" title="wikilink">Peano arithmetic</a> and <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order logic</a> are <a href="Undecidable_problem" title="wikilink">undecidable</a>. Later work by <a href="Emil_Post" title="wikilink">Emil Post</a> and <a href="Stephen_Cole_Kleene" title="wikilink">Stephen Cole Kleene</a> in the 1940s extended the scope of computability theory and introduced the concept of <a href="degrees_of_unsolvability" title="wikilink">degrees of unsolvability</a>.</p>

<p>The results of the first few decades of the twentieth century also had an impact upon <a href="analytic_philosophy" title="wikilink">analytic philosophy</a> and <a href="philosophical_logic" title="wikilink">philosophical logic</a>, particularly from the 1950s onwards, in subjects such as <a href="modal_logic" title="wikilink">modal logic</a>, <a href="temporal_logic" title="wikilink">temporal logic</a>, <a href="deontic_logic" title="wikilink">deontic logic</a>, and <a href="relevance_logic" title="wikilink">relevance logic</a>.</p>

<p>After World War II, <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> branched into four inter-related but separate areas of research: <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>, <a href="proof_theory" title="wikilink">proof theory</a>, <a href="computability_theory" title="wikilink">computability theory</a>, and <a href="set_theory" title="wikilink">set theory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn139" id="fnref139"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

<p>In set theory, the method of <a href="Forcing_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">forcing</a> revolutionized the field by providing a robust method for constructing models and obtaining independence results. <a href="Paul_Cohen_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Paul Cohen</a> introduced this method in 1962 to prove the independence of the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a> and the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a> from <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn140" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> His technique, which was simplified and extended soon after its introduction, has since been applied to many other problems in all areas of mathematical logic.</p>

<p>Computability theory had its roots in the work of Turing, Church, Kleene, and Post in the 1930s and 40s. It developed into a study of abstract computability, which became known as <a href="recursion_theory" title="wikilink">recursion theory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a> The <a href="Turing_degree" title="wikilink">priority method</a>, discovered independently by <a href="Albert_Muchnik" title="wikilink">Albert Muchnik</a> and <a href="Richard_Friedberg" title="wikilink">Richard Friedberg</a> in the 1950s, led to major advances in the understanding of the <a href="degrees_of_unsolvability" title="wikilink">degrees of unsolvability</a> and related structures. Research into higher-order computability theory demonstrated its connections to set theory. The fields of <a href="constructive_analysis" title="wikilink">constructive analysis</a> and <a href="computable_analysis" title="wikilink">computable analysis</a> were developed to study the effective content of classical mathematical theorems; these in turn inspired the program of <a href="reverse_mathematics" title="wikilink">reverse mathematics</a>. A separate branch of computability theory, <a href="computational_complexity_theory" title="wikilink">computational complexity theory</a>, was also characterized in logical terms as a result of investigations into <a href="descriptive_complexity" title="wikilink">descriptive complexity</a>.</p>

<p>Model theory applies the methods of mathematical logic to study models of particular mathematical theories. Alfred Tarski published much pioneering work in the field, which is named after a series of papers he published under the title <em>Contributions to the theory of models</em>. In the 1960s, <a href="Abraham_Robinson" title="wikilink">Abraham Robinson</a> used model-theoretic techniques to develop calculus and analysis based on <a href="non-standard_analysis" title="wikilink">infinitesimals</a>, a problem that first had been proposed by Leibniz.</p>

<p>In proof theory, the relationship between classical mathematics and intuitionistic mathematics was clarified via tools such as the <a class="uri" href="realizability" title="wikilink">realizability</a> method invented by <a href="Georg_Kreisel" title="wikilink">Georg Kreisel</a> and Gödel's <a href="Dialectica_interpretation" title="wikilink"><em>Dialectica</em> interpretation</a>. This work inspired the contemporary area of <a href="proof_mining" title="wikilink">proof mining</a>. The <a href="Curry-Howard_correspondence" title="wikilink">Curry-Howard correspondence</a> emerged as a deep analogy between logic and computation, including a correspondence between systems of natural deduction and <a href="typed_lambda_calculus" title="wikilink">typed lambda calculi</a> used in computer science. As a result, research into this class of formal systems began to address both logical and computational aspects; this area of research came to be known as modern type theory. Advances were also made in <a href="ordinal_analysis" title="wikilink">ordinal analysis</a> and the study of independence results in arithmetic such as the <a href="Paris–Harrington_theorem" title="wikilink">Paris–Harrington theorem</a>.</p>

<p>This was also a period, particularly in the 1950s and afterwards, when the ideas of mathematical logic begin to influence philosophical thinking. For example, <a href="tense_logic" title="wikilink">tense logic</a> is a formalised system for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. The philosopher <a href="Arthur_Prior" title="wikilink">Arthur Prior</a> played a significant role in its development in the 1960s. <a href="Modal_logic" title="wikilink">Modal logics</a> extend the scope of formal logic to include the elements of <a href="Linguistic_modality" title="wikilink">modality</a> (for example, <a href="Logical_possibility" title="wikilink">possibility</a> and <a href="Necessary_and_sufficient_conditions#Necessary_conditions" title="wikilink">necessity</a>). The ideas of <a href="Saul_Kripke" title="wikilink">Saul Kripke</a>, particularly about <a href="possible_world" title="wikilink">possible worlds</a>, and the formal system now called <a href="Kripke_semantics" title="wikilink">Kripke semantics</a> have had a profound impact on <a href="analytic_philosophy" title="wikilink">analytic philosophy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn142" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> His best known and most influential work is <em><a href="Naming_and_Necessity" title="wikilink">Naming and Necessity</a></em> (1980).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> <a href="Deontic_logic" title="wikilink">Deontic logics</a> are closely related to modal logics: they attempt to capture the logical features of <a class="uri" href="obligation" title="wikilink">obligation</a>, <a href="Permission_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">permission</a> and related concepts. Although some basic novelties <a href="syncretism" title="wikilink">syncretizing</a> mathematical and philosophical logic were shown by <a href="Bernard_Bolzano#Metaphysics" title="wikilink">Bolzano</a> in the early 1800s, it was <a href="Ernst_Mally" title="wikilink">Ernst Mally</a>, a pupil of <a href="Alexius_Meinong" title="wikilink">Alexius Meinong</a>, who was to propose the first formal deontic system in his <em>Grundgesetze des Sollens</em>, based on the syntax of Whitehead's and Russell's <a href="propositional_calculus" title="wikilink">propositional calculus</a>.</p>

<p>Another logical system founded after World War II was <a href="fuzzy_logic" title="wikilink">fuzzy logic</a> by Azerbaijani mathematician <a href="Lotfi_Asker_Zadeh" title="wikilink">Lotfi Asker Zadeh</a> in 1965.</p>
