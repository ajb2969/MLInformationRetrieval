<h1>Tychonoff space</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> and related branches of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <strong>Tychonoff spaces</strong> and <strong>completely regular spaces</strong> are kinds of <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological spaces</a>. These conditions are examples of <a href="separation_axiom" title="wikilink">separation axioms</a>.</p>

<p>Tychonoff spaces are named after <a href="Andrey_Nikolayevich_Tychonoff" title="wikilink">Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff</a>, whose <a href="Russian_language" title="wikilink">Russian</a> name (Тихонов) is variously rendered as "Tychonov", "Tikhonov", "Tihonov", "Tichonov" etc.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>Suppose that <em>X</em> is a topological space.</p>

<p><em>X</em> is a <em>completely regular space</em> if given any <a href="closed_set" title="wikilink">closed set</a> <em>F</em> and any <a href="Point_(geometry)" title="wikilink">point</a> <em>x</em> that does not belong to <em>F</em>, then <a href="existential_quantification" title="wikilink">there is</a> a <a href="continuous_function_(topology)" title="wikilink">continuous function</a> <em>f</em> from <em>X</em> to the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a> <strong>R</strong> such that <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) is  and, <a href="universal_quantification" title="wikilink">for every</a> <em>y</em> in <em>F</em>, <em>f</em>(<em>y</em>) is . In other terms, this condition says that <em>x</em> and <em>F</em> can be <a href="separated_sets" title="wikilink">separated by a continuous function</a>.</p>

<p><em>X</em> is a <em>Tychonoff space</em>, or <em>T<sub>3½</sub> space</em>, or <em>T<sub>π</sub> space</em>, or <em>completely T<sub>3</sub> space</em> if it is both completely regular and <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff</a>.</p>

<p>Note that some mathematical literature uses different definitions for the term "completely regular" and the terms involving "T". The definitions that we have given here are the ones usually used today; however, some authors switch the meanings of the two kinds of terms, or use all terms synonymously for only one condition. In Wikipedia, we will use the terms "completely regular" and "Tychonoff" freely, but we'll avoid the less clear "T" terms. In other literature, you should take care to find out which definitions the author is using. (The phrase "completely regular Hausdorff", however, is unambiguous, and always means a Tychonoff space.) For more on this issue, see <a href="History_of_the_separation_axioms" title="wikilink">History of the separation axioms</a>.</p>

<p>Completely regular spaces and Tychonoff spaces are related through the notion of <a href="Kolmogorov_equivalence" title="wikilink">Kolmogorov equivalence</a>. A topological space is Tychonoff if and only if it's both completely regular and <a href="Kolmogorov_space" title="wikilink">T<sub>0</sub></a>. On the other hand, a space is completely regular if and only if its <a href="Kolmogorov_quotient" title="wikilink">Kolmogorov quotient</a> is Tychonoff.</p>
<h2 id="examples-and-counterexamples">Examples and counterexamples</h2>

<p>Almost every topological space studied in <a href="mathematical_analysis" title="wikilink">mathematical analysis</a> is Tychonoff, or at least completely regular. For example, the <a href="real_line" title="wikilink">real line</a> is Tychonoff under the standard <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean topology</a>. Other examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every <a href="metric_space" title="wikilink">metric space</a> is Tychonoff; every <a href="pseudometric_space" title="wikilink">pseudometric space</a> is completely regular.</li>
<li>Every <a href="locally_compact" title="wikilink">locally compact</a> <a href="regular_space" title="wikilink">regular</a> space is completely regular, and therefore every locally compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff.</li>
<li>In particular, every <a href="topological_manifold" title="wikilink">topological manifold</a> is Tychonoff.</li>
<li>Every <a href="totally_ordered_set" title="wikilink">totally ordered set</a> with the <a href="order_topology" title="wikilink">order topology</a> is Tychonoff.</li>
<li>Every <a href="topological_group" title="wikilink">topological group</a> is completely regular.</li>
<li>Generalising both the metric spaces and the topological groups, every <a href="uniform_space" title="wikilink">uniform space</a> is completely regular. The converse is also true: every completely regular space is uniformisable.</li>
<li>Every <a href="CW_complex" title="wikilink">CW complex</a> is Tychonoff.</li>
<li>Every <a href="normal_space" title="wikilink">normal</a> regular space is completely regular, and every normal Hausdorff space is Tychonoff.</li>
<li>The <a href="Niemytzki_plane" title="wikilink">Niemytzki plane</a> is an example of a Tychonoff space which is not <a href="normal_space" title="wikilink">normal</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<h3 id="preservation">Preservation</h3>

<p>Complete regularity and the Tychonoff property are well-behaved with respect to <a href="initial_topology" title="wikilink">initial topologies</a>. Specifically, complete regularity is preserved by taking arbitrary initial topologies and the Tychonoff property is preserved by taking point-separating initial topologies. It follows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every <a href="subspace_(topology)" title="wikilink">subspace</a> of a completely regular or Tychonoff space has the same property.</li>
<li>A nonempty <a href="product_space" title="wikilink">product space</a> is completely regular (resp. Tychonoff) if and only if each factor space is completely regular (resp. Tychonoff).</li>
</ul>

<p>Like all separation axioms, complete regularity is not preserved by taking <a href="final_topology" title="wikilink">final topologies</a>. In particular, <a href="Quotient_space_(topology)" title="wikilink">quotients</a> of completely regular spaces need not be <a href="regular_space" title="wikilink">regular</a>. Quotients of Tychonoff spaces need not even be <a href="Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">Hausdorff</a>. There are closed quotients of the <a href="Moore_plane" title="wikilink">Moore plane</a> which provide counterexamples.</p>
<h3 id="real-valued-continuous-functions">Real-valued continuous functions</h3>

<p>For any topological space <em>X</em>, let <em>C</em>(<em>X</em>) denote the family of real-valued <a href="continuous_function_(topology)" title="wikilink">continuous functions</a> on <em>X</em> and let <em>C</em>*(<em>X</em>) be the subset of <a href="bounded_function" title="wikilink">bounded</a> real-valued continuous functions.</p>

<p>Completely regular spaces can be characterized by the fact that their topology is completely determined by <em>C</em>(<em>X</em>) or <em>C</em>*(<em>X</em>). In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>A space <em>X</em> is completely regular if and only if it has the <a href="initial_topology" title="wikilink">initial topology</a> induced by <em>C</em>(<em>X</em>) or <em>C</em>*(<em>X</em>).</li>
<li>A space <em>X</em> is completely regular if and only if every closed set can be written as the intersection of a family of <a href="zero_set" title="wikilink">zero sets</a> in <em>X</em> (i.e. the zero sets form a basis for the closed sets of <em>X</em>).</li>
<li>A space <em>X</em> is completely regular if and only if the <a href="cozero_set" title="wikilink">cozero sets</a> of <em>X</em> form a <a href="basis_(topology)" title="wikilink">basis</a> for the topology of <em>X</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given an arbitrary topological space (<em>X</em>, τ) there is a universal way of associating a completely regular space with (<em>X</em>, τ). Let ρ be the initial topology on <em>X</em> induced by <em>C</em><sub>τ</sub>(<em>X</em>) or, equivalently, the topology generated by the basis of cozero sets in (<em>X</em>, τ). Then ρ will be the <a href="finest_topology" title="wikilink">finest</a> completely regular topology on <em>X</em> which is coarser than τ. This construction is <a href="universal_property" title="wikilink">universal</a> in the sense that any continuous function</p>

 to a completely regular space <em>Y</em> will be continuous on (<em>X</em>, ρ). In the language of <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a>, the <a class="uri" href="functor" title="wikilink">functor</a> which sends (<em>X</em>, τ) to (<em>X</em>, ρ) is <a href="left_adjoint" title="wikilink">left adjoint</a> to the inclusion functor <strong>CReg</strong> → <strong>Top</strong>. Thus the category of completely regular spaces <strong>CReg</strong> is a <a href="reflective_subcategory" title="wikilink">reflective subcategory</a> of <strong>Top</strong>, the <a href="category_of_topological_spaces" title="wikilink">category of topological spaces</a>. By taking <a href="Kolmogorov_quotient" title="wikilink">Kolmogorov quotients</a>, one sees that the subcategory of Tychonoff spaces is also reflective.</p>

<p>One can show that <em>C</em><sub>τ</sub>(<em>X</em>) = <em>C</em><sub>ρ</sub>(<em>X</em>) in the above construction so that the rings <em>C</em>(<em>X</em>) and <em>C</em>*(<em>X</em>) are typically only studied for completely regular spaces <em>X</em>.</p>

<p>The category of <a href="Realcompact_space" title="wikilink">real compact</a> Tychonoff spaces is anti-equivalent to the category of the rings <em>C</em>(<em>X</em>) (where <em>X</em> is real compact) together with ring homomorphisms as maps. For example one can reconstruct $X$ from <em>C</em>(<em>X</em>) when <em>X</em> is (real) compact. The algebraic theory of these rings is therefore subject of intensive studies. A vast generalisation of this class of rings which still resembles many properties of Tychonoff spaces but is also applicable in <a href="real_algebraic_geometry" title="wikilink">real algebraic geometry</a>, is the class of <a href="real_closed_ring" title="wikilink">real closed rings</a>.</p>
<h3 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h3>

<p>Tychonoff spaces are precisely those spaces which can be <a href="embedding" title="wikilink">embedded</a> in <a href="compact_Hausdorff_space" title="wikilink">compact Hausdorff spaces</a>. More precisely, for every Tychonoff space <em>X</em>, there exists a compact Hausdorff space <em>K</em> such that <em>X</em> is <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> to a subspace of <em>K</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, one can always choose <em>K</em> to be a <a href="Tychonoff_cube" title="wikilink">Tychonoff cube</a> (i.e. a possibly infinite product of <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit intervals</a>). Every Tychonoff cube is compact Hausdorff as a consequence of <a href="Tychonoff's_theorem" title="wikilink">Tychonoff's theorem</a>. Since every subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff one has:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>A topological space is Tychonoff if and only if it can be embedded in a Tychonoff cube</em>.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="compactifications">Compactifications</h3>

<p>Of particular interest are those embeddings where the image of <em>X</em> is <a href="dense_subset" title="wikilink">dense</a> in <em>K</em>; these are called Hausdorff <a href="Compactification_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">compactifications</a> of <em>X</em>. Given any embedding of a Tychonoff space <em>X</em> in a compact Hausdorff space <em>K</em> the <a href="closure_(topology)" title="wikilink">closure</a> of the image of <em>X</em> in <em>K</em> is a compactification of <em>X</em>.</p>

<p>Among those Hausdorff compactifications, there is a unique "most general" one, the <a href="Stone–Čech_compactification" title="wikilink">Stone–Čech compactification</a> β<em>X</em>. It is characterised by the <a href="universal_property" title="wikilink">universal property</a> that, given a continuous map <em>f</em> from <em>X</em> to any other compact Hausdorff space <em>Y</em>, there is a <a class="uri" href="unique" title="wikilink">unique</a> continuous map <em>g</em> from β<em>X</em> to <em>Y</em> that extends <em>f</em> in the sense that <em>f</em> is the <a href="composition_(functions)" title="wikilink">composition</a> of <em>g</em> and <em>j</em>.</p>
<h3 id="uniform-structures">Uniform structures</h3>

<p>Complete regularity is exactly the condition necessary for the existence of <a href="uniform_structure" title="wikilink">uniform structures</a> on a topological space. In other words, every <a href="uniform_space" title="wikilink">uniform space</a> has a completely regular topology and every completely regular space <em>X</em> is <a class="uri" href="uniformizable" title="wikilink">uniformizable</a>. A topological space admits a separated uniform structure if and only if it is Tychonoff.</p>

<p>Given a completely regular space <em>X</em> there is usually more than one uniformity on <em>X</em> that is compatible with the topology of <em>X</em>. However, there will always be a finest compatible uniformity, called the <a href="fine_uniformity" title="wikilink">fine uniformity</a> on <em>X</em>. If <em>X</em> is Tychonoff, then the uniform structure can be chosen so that β<em>X</em> becomes the <a href="completion_(topology)" title="wikilink">completion</a> of the uniform space <em>X</em>.</p>
