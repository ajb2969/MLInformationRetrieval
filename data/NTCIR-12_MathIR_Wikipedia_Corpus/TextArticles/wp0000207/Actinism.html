<h1>Actinism</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Actinism</strong> is the property of <a href="solar_radiation" title="wikilink">solar radiation</a> that leads to the production of <a href="photochemistry" title="wikilink">photochemical</a> and <a href="photobiology" title="wikilink">photobiological</a> effects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Actinism</em> is derived from the Greek ακτίς, ακτῖνος (a ray or beam). The word <em>actinism</em> is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp. photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and <a class="uri" href="chemistry" title="wikilink">chemistry</a> (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of actinism is applied, for example, in <a href="Photography#Chemical_Photography" title="wikilink">chemical photography</a> and <a class="uri" href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-ray</a> imaging.</p>
<p>Actinic chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals.</p>
<h2 id="in-chemistry">In chemistry</h2>
<p>In chemical terms, actinism is the property of radiation that lets it be absorbed by a molecule and cause a photochemical reaction as a result. <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a> was the first to correctly theorize that each photon would be able to cause only one molecular reaction. This distinction separates photochemical reactions from exothermic reduction reactions triggered by radiation.</p>
<p>For general purposes, <em>photochemistry</em> is the commonly used vernacular rather than <em>actinic</em> or <em>actino-chemistry</em>, which are again more commonly seen used for photography or imaging.</p>
<h2 id="in-medicine">In medicine</h2>
<p>In medicine, actinic effects are generally described in terms of the dermis or outer layers of the body, such as eyes (see: <a href="Actinic_conjunctivitis" title="wikilink">Actinic conjunctivitis</a>) and upper tissues that the sun would normally affect, rather than deeper tissues that higher-energy shorter-wavelength radiation such as x-ray and gamma might affect (see <a href="actinic_keratosis" title="wikilink">actinic keratosis</a>).</p>
<p>The term <em>actinic rays</em> is used to refer to this phenomenon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="in-biology">In biology</h2>
<p>In biology, "actinic light" denotes light from solar or other sources that can cause photochemical reactions such as <a class="uri" href="photosynthesis" title="wikilink">photosynthesis</a> in a species.</p>
<h2 id="in-manufacturing">In manufacturing</h2>
<p>Actinic inspection of masks in computer chip manufacture refers to inspecting the mask with the same wavelength of light that the lithography system will use.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-lighting">Artificial lighting</h2>
<p>"Actinic" lights are a high-color-temperature blue light.</p>
<p>They are also used in <a href="Bug_zapper" title="wikilink">electric fly killers</a> to attract flies.</p>
<h2 id="in-aquaculture">In aquaculture</h2>
<p>Actinic lights are used in aquariums, primarily because they make fluorescent coral "pop" to the eye, but in some cases also to promote the growth of deeper-water coral that is specialized in photosynthesis using blue light.</p>
