<p>Born in <a class="uri" href="Prague" title="wikilink">Prague</a>, then in <a class="uri" href="Czechoslovakia" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a>, Dubs was one of 669 Czech, mainly <a href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jewish</a>, children saved by English stockbroker <a href="Nicholas_Winton" title="wikilink">Nicholas Winton</a>, and others, from the <a href="Nazism" title="wikilink">Nazis</a> on the '<a class="uri" href="Kindertransport" title="wikilink">Kindertransport</a>'. His father had fled to England the day the Nazis arrived in Czechoslovakia and young Alf was to meet him at <a href="Liverpool_Street_station" title="wikilink">Liverpool Street station</a>. He later said that he clearly remembered leaving Prague station at age six and not touching the food pack given to him by his mother for the next two days. His mother was initially denied a visa but was able to join him and his father in London shortly afterwards.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

He later met Winton in person and campaigned for him to be honoured.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Winton was eventually <a href="Knight_Bachelor" title="wikilink">knighted</a> in 2002.</p>

He was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the <a href="Northern_Ireland_Office" title="wikilink">Northern Ireland Office</a> from May 1997 to December 1999.</p>

<p>While Dubs was still in the House of Commons, <a href="John_O'Farrell_(author_and_broadcaster)" title="wikilink">John O'Farrell</a> worked in his office and was a Labour activist in Battersea. O'Farrell described in his book <em>Things Can Only Get Better</em> the events leading up to Dubs's shock defeat by the Conservative <a href="John_Bowis" title="wikilink">John Bowis</a> at the 1987 general election. Dubs stood for Battersea again at the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election,_1992" title="wikilink">1992 election</a>, only to see the Conservative majority increase, against the national trend. Subsequently, he was given a <a href="life_peer" title="wikilink">life peerage</a>.</p>

<p>Dubs has served on an Area Health Authority and more recently on a Mental Health Trust.

<p>In 2008 Dubs was still an active member of the House of Lords, participating in 42 debates, well above average for all peers. He has spoken on many varied subjects including the <a href="National_Probation_Service" title="wikilink">National Probation Service</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and <a href="Road_Safety" title="wikilink">Road Safety</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Lord Dubs was Chair of the <a href="Road_Safety_Foundation" title="wikilink">Road Safety Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Dubs lists his main home as a cottage in the Lake District in <a class="uri" href="Cumbria" title="wikilink">Cumbria</a>, which enabled him to claim over £26,000 of overnight subsistence expenses in 2007/2008<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> although he has lived in Notting Hill, west London, since 1964. He argued in justification in May 2009 that Lords regard the overnight allowance as a payment in lieu of salary. "We are the only legislators in the world that don’t get paid," he said. "The overnight thing is quite generous because it compensates for not having a salary. In practice that’s how it works."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Lord Dubs is a Vice-President of the Debating Group.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He is a member of the <a href="Henry_Jackson_Society" title="wikilink">Henry Jackson Society</a>'s Political Council.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
