<h1>Contact image sensor</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Contact Image Sensors</strong> (CIS) are image sensors used in <a href="Image_scanner" title="wikilink">flatbed scanners</a> almost in direct contact with the object to be scanned. <a href="Charge-coupled_device" title="wikilink">CCDs</a>, often used for this application, use mirrors to bounce light to a stationary sensor. CISs are much smaller than CCDs, use typically a tenth as much power, and are particularly suitable for low power and portable applications, often powered over <a class="uri" href="USB" title="wikilink">USB</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p> A CIS typically consists of a linear array of detectors, covered by focusing lenses and flanked by red, green, and blue <a href="LED" title="wikilink">LEDs</a> for illumination. The use of LEDs allows the CIS to be highly power efficient, allowing scanners to be powered through the minimal line voltage supplied via a <a class="uri" href="USB" title="wikilink">USB</a> connection. CIS devices typically produce lower image quality compared to CCD devices; in particular, the depth of field is greatly limited, which poses a problem for material that is not perfectly flat. However, a CIS contact sensor is smaller and lighter than a CCD line sensor, and allows all the necessary optical elements to be included in a compact module, thus helping to simplify the inner structure of the scanner. With a CIS contact sensor, the scanner can be portable, with a height of only around 30 mm. CIS is both a key component of, and widely used in, scanners (especially portable scanners), electrographs, bar code readers and optical identification technology.</p>
