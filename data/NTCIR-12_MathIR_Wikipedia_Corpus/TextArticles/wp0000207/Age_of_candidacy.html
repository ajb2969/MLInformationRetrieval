<h1>Age of candidacy</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Age of candidacy</strong> is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be <a href="nomination_rules" title="wikilink">eligible to stand</a> for an election or be granted <a href="ballot_access" title="wikilink">ballot access</a>.</p>
<p>The first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the <em>Lex Villia Annalis</em>, a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial <a href="Roman_Magistrates" title="wikilink">magistrates</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="controversies">Controversies</h2>
<p> Many <a href="youth_rights" title="wikilink">youth rights</a> groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified <a href="Ageism" title="wikilink">age discrimination</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they don't know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.</p>
<p>In 1934, <a href="Rush_D._Holt,_Sr." title="wikilink">Rush Holt</a> of West Virginia was elected to the <a href="Senate_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Senate of the United States</a> at the age of 29. Since the <a href="United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">U.S. Constitution</a> requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1954, <a href="Richard_Fulton" title="wikilink">Richard Fulton</a> won election to the <a href="Tennessee_Senate" title="wikilink">Tennessee Senate</a>. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time. The <a href="Tennessee_State_Constitution" title="wikilink">Tennessee State Constitution</a> required that senators be at least 30.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, <a href="Clifford_Allen" title="wikilink">Clifford Allen</a>, was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">US House of Representatives</a> where he served for 10 years.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but too young according to the State Constitution, Mike Laughlin in 1969 and <a href="William_Jennings_Bryan_Dorn" title="wikilink"> Bryan Dorn</a> (later a US Congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>On several occasions, the <a href="Socialist_Workers_Party_(USA)" title="wikilink">Socialist Workers Party (USA)</a> has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, <a href="Linda_Jenness" title="wikilink">Linda Jenness</a> ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was only 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive <a href="ballot_access" title="wikilink">ballot access</a> in several states in which she otherwise qualified.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 2004, the SWP nominated <a href="Arrin_Hawkins" title="wikilink">Arrin Hawkins</a> as the party's vice-presidential candidate, although she was only 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reform-efforts">Reform efforts</h2>
<p>In the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, <a href="South_Dakota" title="wikilink">South Dakota</a> voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 25 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, <a class="uri" href="Oregon" title="wikilink">Oregon</a> voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.</p>
<p>During the early 2000s, the <a href="British_Youth_Council" title="wikilink">British Youth Council</a> and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>, <a class="uri" href="Wales" title="wikilink">Wales</a> and <a class="uri" href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> on 1 January 2007,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> when section 17 of the <a href="Electoral_Administration_Act" title="wikilink">Electoral Administration Act 2006</a> entered into force.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
