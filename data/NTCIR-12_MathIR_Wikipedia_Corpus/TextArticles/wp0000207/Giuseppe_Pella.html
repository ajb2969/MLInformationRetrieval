<hr/>

<p><strong>Giuseppe Pella</strong> (18 April 1902 – 31 May 1981) was an Italian <a href="Christian_Democracy_(Italy)" title="wikilink">Christian Democratic</a> politician who served as the <a href="List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Italy" title="wikilink">32nd</a> <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Italy" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of Italy</a> from 1953 to 1954. He was also <a href="President_of_the_European_Parliament" title="wikilink">President of the European Parliament</a> from 1954 to 1956 after the death of <a href="Alcide_De_Gasperi" title="wikilink">Alcide De Gasperi</a>.</p>

<p>He was born in <a class="uri" href="Valdengo" title="wikilink">Valdengo</a>, Piedmont. After graduation in Economy and Commerce, he adhered to the Christian Democracy (DC), in the right wing of the party. His first government position was as under-secretary of Finances in the II and III <a href="De_Gasperi" title="wikilink">De Gasperi</a> cabinets. In the IV De Gasperi he was Minister of Finances.</p>

<p>Pella was Minister of Treasure in 1948–1953, gaining the enmity of the <a href="Italian_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Communist</a> and <a href="italian_Socialist_Party" title="wikilink">Socialist</a> parties, as well as some DC members due to his liberal and monetarist policies. After the political crisis caused by the failure of the <a href="Cheat_Law" title="wikilink">Cheat Law</a>, Pella was appointed Prime Minister in a deliberately provisional government. Pella gained further critics when, by issuing nationalistic declarations, he created strife with <a href="Josip_Broz_Tito" title="wikilink">Josip Broz Tito</a> regarding the <a href="Free_Territory_of_Trieste" title="wikilink">Free Territory of Trieste</a>. Pella resigned on 12 January 1954.</p>

<p>Later he was Minister of Foreign Affairs under <a href="Adone_Zoli" title="wikilink">Adone Zoli</a> (1957–1958) and <a href="Antonio_Segni" title="wikilink">Antonio Segni</a> (1959–1960), and Minister of Balance under <a href="Amintore_Fanfani" title="wikilink">Amintore Fanfani</a> (1960–1962). Hostile to the alliance between DC and the Socialist Party, he retreated from frontline politics until 1972, when he became minister of Finances in the short-lived government led by <a href="Giulio_Andreotti" title="wikilink">Giulio Andreotti</a>.</p>

<p>Pella was Senator until 1976. He died in Rome in 1981.</p>
