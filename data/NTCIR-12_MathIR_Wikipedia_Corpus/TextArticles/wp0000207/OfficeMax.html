<p>OfficeMax grew by acquisition with Office World first in November 1990, with Office World executive and <a href="Montgomery_Ward" title="wikilink">Montgomery Ward</a> becoming minority shareholders.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1990, <a href="Office_Square" title="wikilink">Office Square</a> stores were purchased from <a class="uri" href="Kmart" title="wikilink">Kmart</a>, in exchange for a 22% equity stake.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1991, <a class="uri" href="Kmart" title="wikilink">Kmart</a> increased its stake in OfficeMax to 92%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In January 1992, OfficeMax acquired five sites from <a href="Highland_Superstores" title="wikilink">Highland Superstores</a> in Boston. OW Office Warehouse, a Virginia-based regional chain, was acquired in June 30, 1992.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The company then acquired BizMart, its largest acquisition (104 stores) to date, in 1993 from Intelligent Electronics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> On August 16, 1993, OfficeMax joined Kmart and most of its other specialty stores in the "largest power center" in <a href="Utica,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Utica, Michigan</a> and joined by <a href="Best_Buy" title="wikilink">Best Buy</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> OfficeMax acquires a 19% stake in Corporate Express, a contract stationer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In May 1994, Kmart put a plan in front of its stockholders to sell 20% to 30% of each of its specialty store subsidiaries <a class="uri" href="shares" title="wikilink">shares</a> on the open market to pay down debt and fund future expansion of the subsidiaries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Kmart's shareholders turn down the proposal at their June 3 annual meeting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In November 1994, FurnitureMax store within a store concept begins testing in the Cleveland market.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1995, Kmart sold off 51% of OfficeMax shares, spinning off the company and became a <a class="uri" href="NYSE" title="wikilink">NYSE</a>-(OMX)-publicly-traded corporation, based in <a href="Shaker_Heights,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Shaker Heights, Ohio</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
