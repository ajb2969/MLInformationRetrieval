<hr/>

<p><strong>Samuel Rutherford</strong> ( – 19 March 1661) was a Scottish <a class="uri" href="Presbyterian" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a> pastor, <a href="theology" title="wikilink">theologian</a> and author, and one of the Scottish Commissioners to the <a href="Westminster_Assembly" title="wikilink">Westminster Assembly</a>.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>Samuel Rutherford, a little, fair haired man <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was born in the village of <a href="Nisbet,_Roxburghshire" title="wikilink">Nisbet, Roxburghshire</a>, in the <a href="Scottish_Borders" title="wikilink">Scottish Borders</a> area of <a class="uri" href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. Rutherford was educated at <a href="Jedburgh_Grammar_School" title="wikilink">Jedburgh Grammar School</a> and <a href="Edinburgh_University" title="wikilink">Edinburgh University</a>, where he became Regent of Humanity (<a class="uri" href="Professor" title="wikilink">Professor</a> of <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a>) in 1623. In 1627 he was settled as minister of <a class="uri" href="Anwoth" title="wikilink">Anwoth</a> in <a class="uri" href="Kirkcudbrightshire" title="wikilink">Kirkcudbrightshire</a>, <a class="uri" href="Galloway" title="wikilink">Galloway</a>, where it was said of him 'he was always praying, always preaching, always visiting the sick, always catechising, always writing and studying',<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and from where he was banished to <a class="uri" href="Aberdeen" title="wikilink">Aberdeen</a> for <a href="nonconformism" title="wikilink">nonconformity</a>, 'being very powerful on the side of the Reformed faith and of God living',<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> there in Aberdeen, 'his writing desk', was said to be, 'perhaps the most effective and widely resounding pulpit then in Christendom'.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His patron in Galloway was <a href="John_Gordon,_1st_Viscount_of_Kenmure" title="wikilink">John Gordon, 1st Viscount of Kenmure</a>. On the re-establishment of <a class="uri" href="Presbyterianism" title="wikilink">Presbyterianism</a> in 1638 he was made Professor of <a class="uri" href="Divinity" title="wikilink">Divinity</a> at <a href="University_of_St_Andrews" title="wikilink">St. Andrews</a>.</p>

<p>Rutherford was chosen as one of the four main Scottish Commissioners to the <a href="Westminster_Assembly" title="wikilink">Westminster Assembly</a> of Divines in London taking part in in formulating the <a href="Westminster_Confession_of_Faith" title="wikilink">Westminster Confession of Faith</a> completed in 1647,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and after his return to Scotland he became Rector of St. Mary's College at St. Andrews in 1651. Rutherford was a staunch Protester during the controversy in the Scottish Presbyterian church between the Resolutioners and Protesters in the 1650s, and at the <a href="Restoration_(1660)" title="wikilink">Restoration</a> of Charles II his Lex Rex was burnt by the hand of the common hangman, and the "Drunken Parliament" deprived him of all his offices and voted that he not be permitted to die in the college. His epitaph on his tombstone concluded 'Acquainted with Immanuel's song'.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>There is a monument to Rutherford, on the hilltop overlooking his former parish at Anwoth, in the village of <a href="Gatehouse_of_Fleet" title="wikilink">Gatehouse of Fleet</a>, southwest Scotland.</p>
<h2 id="writings">Writings</h2>

<p>Rutherford's has been described as 'Prince of Letter writers' <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and <a href="Charles_Spurgeon" title="wikilink">C. H. Spurgeon</a> described Rutherford's letters to be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> continuing in an 1891 review of Rutherford's (posthumously published <em>Letters</em> (1664) 'when we are dead and gone let the world know that Spurgeon held Rutherford’s Letters to be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men'. <a href="Andrew_Thomson_(Broughton)" title="wikilink">Andrew Thomson</a>, a Scottish minister, in a 19th-century biography observed 'the letters flash upon the reader with original thoughts and abound in lofty feeling clothed in the radiant garb of imagination in which there is everything of poetry but the form. Individual sentences that supplied the germ-thought of some of the most beautiful spiritual in modern poetry' continuing 'a bundle of myrrh whose ointment and perfume would revive and gladden the hearts of many generations, each letter full of hope and yet of heartbreak, full of tender pathos of the here and the hereafter.' <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Rutherford was also known for other spiritual and devotional works, such as <em>Christ Dying and drawing Sinners to Himself</em>, "The Trial and Triumph of Faith".</p>

<p>Rutherford's political book <em><a href="Lex,_Rex" title="wikilink">Lex, Rex</a></em> was written in response to John Maxwell's "Sacro-Sanctum Regus Majestas" and presented a theory of <a href="limited_government" title="wikilink">limited government</a> and <a class="uri" href="constitutionalism" title="wikilink">constitutionalism</a> raised Rutherford to merited eminence as a philosophical thinker.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> After the <a href="Restoration_(1660)" title="wikilink">Restoration</a>, the authorities burned <em>Lex, Rex</em> and cited Rutherford for <a href="high_treason" title="wikilink">high treason</a>, but his death intervened before the charge could be tried. Rutherford was vehemently opposed to liberty of conscience and his <em>A Free Disputation against Pretended Liberty of Conscience</em> raised the ire of <a href="John_Milton" title="wikilink">John Milton</a>, who named Rutherford in his sonnet on the forcers of conscience in the Long Parliament. Rutherford also was a strong supporter of the divine right of Presbyterianism (the idea that the Presbyterian form of church government is mandated in the Bible). Rutherford was involved in written controversies over church government with the New England Independents (or Congregationalists). His "A Peaceable Plea for Paul's Presbytery in Scotland" (1642) was followed by his <em>Due Right of Presbyteries</em> (1644), <em>Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication" (1648) and "A Survey of 'A Survey of that Sum of Church Discipline' penned by Thomas Hooker</em> (1655), with not only <a href="Thomas_Hooker" title="wikilink">Hooker</a>, but <a href="John_Cotton_(Puritan)" title="wikilink">John Cotton</a> and <a href="Richard_Mather" title="wikilink">Richard Mather</a> also writing books against Rutherford's view of church government.</p>
