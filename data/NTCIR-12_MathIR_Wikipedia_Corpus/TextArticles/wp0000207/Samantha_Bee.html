<p>In December 2005, on <em><a href="The_O'Reilly_Factor" title="wikilink">The O'Reilly Factor</a></em>, <a href="Bill_O'Reilly_(commentator)" title="wikilink">Bill O'Reilly</a> used a clip of Bee from <em>The Daily Show</em> as an example of "<a href="Secularization_of_Christmas#2004-2005_Fox_News_campaign" title="wikilink">The War on Christmas</a>", presenting it as having aired recently. The satirical clip featured Bee mentioning how <a class="uri" href="Christmas" title="wikilink">Christmas</a> was the only religious holiday that's also a <a href="Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">federal holiday in the United States</a>, with O'Reilly talking about "<a href="Secularity" title="wikilink">Secular</a> Central...excuse me, Comedy Central".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">Jon Stewart</a> discussed this on the air, claiming he could not recall doing that piece. Stewart invited Bee out, and unlike in the clip that aired on <em>Factor</em>, Bee was visibly eight months pregnant. Though the two were coy insofar as explicitly mentioning her pregnancy, Bee joked it was obvious that the footage O'Reilly showed was a year old (it originally aired in 2004) because she had slightly different highlights in her hair, before stating that her water had just broken.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
