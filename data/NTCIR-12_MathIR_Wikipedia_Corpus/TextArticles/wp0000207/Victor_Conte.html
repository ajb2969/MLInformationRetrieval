<p>In 2009, in the aftermath of the investigation, Conte's book <em>BALCO: The Straight Dope on Barry Bonds, Marion and What We Can Do to Save Sports</em> was intended to be co-written with author <a href="Nathan_Jendrick" title="wikilink">Nathan Jendrick</a>, and was not published.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The book was never published at all.</p>

After prison, he has researched and developed legal-to-use sports supplements. One writer for one sports website believes that baseball commissioner <a href="Bud_Selig" title="wikilink">Bud Selig</a> should hire Conte, someone who has previously circumvented the drug regulations of several sports leagues, to develop a more foolproof drug policy for sports.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
