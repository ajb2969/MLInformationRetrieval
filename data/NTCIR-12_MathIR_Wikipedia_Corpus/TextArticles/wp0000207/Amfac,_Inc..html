<p>German immigrant Heinrich Hackfeld and his brother-in-law J. C. Pflueger founded a dry goods store called H. Hackfeld and Company in 1849 in <a class="uri" href="Honolulu" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a>. Hackfeld later became the business agent for <a href="Old_Sugar_Mill_of_Koloa" title="wikilink">Kōloa Plantation</a> on the island of <a href="Kauai" title="wikilink">Kauai</a>. <a href="Paul_Isenberg" title="wikilink">Paul Isenberg</a> (1837–1903) became a partner in 1881.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>During <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">World War I</a>, the company was seized by the U.S. government <a href="Alien_Property_Custodian" title="wikilink">Alien Property Custodian</a>. It was later sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to "American Factors". In 1966, the name was further shortened to "Amfac". Henry Alexander Walker became president in the 1930s. The family estate known as the <a href="H._Alexander_Walker_Residence" title="wikilink">H. Alexander Walker Residence</a>, was developed into a showcase garden.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1968 to 1972 under president Henry Alexander Walker Jr. Amfac acquired 42 different companies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Ronald L. Sloan was removed as president November 20, 1987 and replaced by Richard L. Griffith (Walker was still chairman of the board). The company announced it was selling its non-Hawaii business units.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Amfac was bought by <a class="uri" href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>-based <a href="JMB_Realty" title="wikilink">JMB Realty</a> in 1988 for USD $920 million.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As the sugar industry in Hawaii declined after statehood, so did the fortunes of Amfac. Amfac's assets were gradually sold off. Liberty House went into bankruptcy in 1998 (it was later acquired by <a href="Federated_Department_Stores" title="wikilink">Federated Department Stores</a> and now carries the <a class="uri" href="Macy's" title="wikilink">Macy's</a> brand name), and Amfac Hawaii went into <a href="Chapter_11_bankruptcy" title="wikilink">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> in 2002.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Amfac Hotels &amp; Resorts was retained by JMB and was renamed <a href="Xanterra_Parks_and_Resorts" title="wikilink">Xanterra Parks and Resorts</a>.
