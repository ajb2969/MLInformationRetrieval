<h1>Day-tripper</h1>
<hr/>
<p>A <strong>day-tripper</strong> is a person who visits a <a href="tourist_destination" title="wikilink">tourist destination</a> or <a href="visitor_attraction" title="wikilink">visitor attraction</a> from his/her home and returns home on the same day.</p>
<p>Such an excursion does not involve a night away from home such as experienced on a <a class="uri" href="holiday" title="wikilink">holiday</a>. The <strong>day trip</strong> or <strong>daycation</strong> is a popular form of <a class="uri" href="recreation" title="wikilink">recreation</a> and <a class="uri" href="leisure" title="wikilink">leisure</a> for families who care for young children or people who are too frail to travel easily or who own pets, or for whom the logistics or cost of a night away from home may be prohibitive.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="Medieval" title="wikilink">Medieval</a> days a destination for such days out would be <a class="uri" href="religious" title="wikilink">religious</a> (to a nearby <a class="uri" href="shrine" title="wikilink">shrine</a>) or commercial, for example to a seasonal <a class="uri" href="fair" title="wikilink">fair</a>. Later, in England, visits to <a href="stately_home" title="wikilink">stately homes</a> by those who regarded themselves <a href="middle_class" title="wikilink">middle class</a> became frequent and it was the tradition to reward the <a class="uri" href="butler" title="wikilink">butler</a> or housekeeper with a tip for providing access to their employers' home. As such homes were meant for show it is unlikely that the owning family would object, provided they were not in residence at the time.</p>
<p>The arrival of the <a href="railway_excursion" title="wikilink">railway excursion</a>, often using Day Tripper tickets, in the mid 19th century saw the blossoming of a distinctive day-tripper industry. Trippers also travelled in their thousands by <a class="uri" href="paddlesteamer" title="wikilink">paddlesteamer</a> or <a class="uri" href="steamship" title="wikilink">steamship</a> to the many <a href="pier" title="wikilink">piers</a> around <a href="Victorian_era" title="wikilink">Victorian era</a> <a href="seaside_resort" title="wikilink">seaside resorts</a>. The <a href="General_Slocum" title="wikilink">General Slocum</a> excursion was an example.</p>
<p><a class="uri" href="Cycling" title="wikilink">Cycling</a> became a very popular day-tripper activity, especially amongst <a href="urban_area" title="wikilink">urban</a> and <a class="uri" href="suburban" title="wikilink">suburban</a> workers from the mid-1880s onwards.</p>
<p><a href="Coach_(vehicle)" title="wikilink">Coach</a> and <a class="uri" href="charabanc" title="wikilink">charabanc</a> outings followed as the <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a> became reliable enough to get the paying customers out and back again. Works outings and church or chapel excursions were extremely popular until the 1970s.</p>
<p>While all of the foregoing still exist, the modern day-tripper experience is usually by <a href="motor_car" title="wikilink">motor car</a> as a result of the growth of car ownership. Also, <a href="airline" title="wikilink">airlines</a> such as <a class="uri" href="Palmair" title="wikilink">Palmair</a> promote day trips.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
