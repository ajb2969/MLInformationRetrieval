<p>The place was first mentioned in 1174. Also in the 12th century, a water castle was built, that was destroyed at the end of the 15th century.</p>

<p>In 1747, under the regency of <a href="Maria_Theresa_of_Austria" title="wikilink">Maria Theresa</a>, the needle factory <em>Nadelburg</em> was established. The factory was expanded with a cotton mill in the early 19th century. A workers' settlement grew around the factories. The Nadelburg was closed in 1930. It is now a museum.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Lichtenwörth became a market town in 1992.</p>

<p>Lichtenworth is also very much remembered for its concentration slave labor camp during the Third Reich. It was a sub-camp of Mauthausen. Mainly Jewish women were force marched from Budapest. The conditions were brutal and many died there.</p>
