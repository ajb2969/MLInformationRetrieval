<h1>Cowan rail accident</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Cowan rail accident</strong> occurred at 7:20pm on 6 May 1990 when the <a href="3801_Limited" title="wikilink">3801 Limited</a> special <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam</a> <a href="passenger_train" title="wikilink">passenger train</a> returning from the <a href="Maitland,_New_South_Wales#Morpeth_Jazz_Festival" title="wikilink">Morpeth Jazz Festival</a> was struck in the rear by the following <a class="uri" href="CityRail" title="wikilink">CityRail</a> <a href="Intercity_rail" title="wikilink">inter-urban</a> passenger service. The steam train had stalled while attempting to climb the steep <a class="uri" href="gradient" title="wikilink">gradient</a> from the <a href="Hawkesbury_River" title="wikilink">Hawkesbury River</a> to <a href="Cowan,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Cowan, New South Wales</a>, and it was found that sand applied to the rails to regain traction had interfered with the <a href="Railway_signal" title="wikilink">signals</a> and given the following train a <a href="Wrong-side_failure" title="wikilink">false clear indication</a>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The crash occurred approximately  south of <a href="Brooklyn,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Brooklyn, New South Wales</a>, near the Boronia No. 3 <a class="uri" href="tunnel" title="wikilink">tunnel</a>. The railway line at this point, known as the <a href="Cowan_Bank" title="wikilink">Cowan Bank</a>, is 2.5% (1 in 40) <a href="Grade_(slope)" title="wikilink">grade</a> and, as the special hauled by <a href="38_class" title="wikilink">C38-class</a> <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a> <a class="uri" href="3801" title="wikilink">3801</a> passed southwards through the No. 3 tunnel, the wheels of the locomotive started to <a href="Slip_(vehicle_dynamics)" title="wikilink">slip</a>. The driver of 3801 applied <a href="Sandbox_(railways)" title="wikilink">sand</a> to the rails to improve <a href="traction_(engineering)" title="wikilink">traction</a>, but the train came to a complete stop approximately 50 metres clear of the tunnel. Passengers on the steam train reported seeing a signal fluctuating <a href="Railway_signal" title="wikilink">aspects</a> between green and yellow. The following <a href="CityRail_V_set" title="wikilink">CityRail V set</a> inter-urban train, which had been halted at the northern entrance to Boronia No. 4 tunnel for 10 minutes by a red stop <a href="Railway_signal" title="wikilink">signal</a>, received a green indication and proceeded, colliding with the steam train shortly after.</p>

<p>The impact killed the driver of the inter-urban, Gordon Hill, and a passenger who was riding in the inter-urban's cab, as well as four passengers in the rear carriage of 3801's train. The passengers killed included the recently retired <a href="Vice_Chancellor" title="wikilink">Vice Chancellor</a> of the <a href="University_of_Sydney" title="wikilink">University of Sydney</a>, <a href="John_Manning_Ward" title="wikilink">John Manning Ward</a>, his wife and daughter, and the wife of the University's <a href="Registrar_(education)" title="wikilink">Registrar</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> 99 passengers were injured, 11 of those seriously. The force of the crash completely destroyed the last carriage of the steam train, and was enough to break the locomotive <a href="Railway_coupler" title="wikilink">coupling</a> and push the engine 12 metres forward.</p>

<p>A subsequent <a href="Coroner's_Court_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">coronial inquiry</a>, headed by NSW State Coroner Derrick Hand, found in December 1990 that the sand that had been applied to the track by 3801 to aid traction had <a href="Insulator_(electrical)" title="wikilink">insulated</a> the train from the rails, meaning that the <a href="track_circuits" title="wikilink">track circuits</a> failed to detect the presence of the first train, allowing the following inter-urban train to be given a false green (clear) aspect (known as a <a href="wrong-side_failure" title="wikilink">wrong-side failure</a>). Mr Hand also considered it likely that a passenger on 3801 had applied a <a href="Parking_brake" title="wikilink">handbrake</a> on the third carriage, and that this, combined with the heavy load, the steep grade and the curvature of the line, had prevented the steam train from restarting. No fault was found with the signalling system, although the coroner recommended that it be upgraded as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-factors">Contributing factors</h2>

<p>Contributing factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">AC</a> <a href="track_circuit" title="wikilink">track circuits</a>, which are less sensitive at detecting <a href="rail_vehicles" title="wikilink">rail vehicles</a>.</li>
<li>No indication of track circuit state to the controlling <a href="signal_box" title="wikilink">signal box</a>, which might have alerted the <a href="signalman_(rail)" title="wikilink">signalman</a> of a possible <a href="Shunt_(electrical)" title="wikilink">shunting</a> problem caused by sanding.</li>
<li>The signalling system was two-aspect colour light - a three aspect colour light may have provided the driver of the following train with more warning.</li>
<li>No sand removal system fitted to 3801.</li>
<li>No mechanism (at the time) for train-to-train or train-to-signalman communication (communication with signal boxes was only possible by track-side phones).</li>
<li>It is believed that the handbrakes on one of the carriages may have been applied as a stunt.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the NSW railway system. The ban was lifted 9 months later.</li>
<li>Operators were required to use one State Rail employee on each train</li>
<li>Operators were required to carry insurance cover of $10 million. The government agreed to underwrite any claims exceeding that amount.</li>
