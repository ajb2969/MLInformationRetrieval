<p><strong>Horwich</strong>  is a town and <a href="Civil_parishes_in_England" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> in the <a href="Metropolitan_Borough_of_Bolton" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Borough of Bolton</a>, in <a href="Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Greater Manchester</a>, England.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="Historic_counties_of_England" title="wikilink">Historically</a> in <a class="uri" href="Lancashire" title="wikilink">Lancashire</a>, it is  southeast of <a class="uri" href="Chorley" title="wikilink">Chorley</a>,  northwest of <a class="uri" href="Bolton" title="wikilink">Bolton</a> and  northwest of <a class="uri" href="Manchester" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>. It lies at the southern edge of the <a href="West_Pennine_Moors" title="wikilink">West Pennine Moors</a> with the <a href="M61_motorway" title="wikilink">M61 motorway</a> passing close to the south and west. According to the <a href="United_Kingdom_Census_2001" title="wikilink">United Kingdom Census 2001</a>, Horwich had a population of 19,312.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Horwich emerged in the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> as a hunting chase. Streams flowing from the moors were harnessed to provide power for bleachworks and other industry at the start of the <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="wikilink">Industrial Revolution</a>. The textile industry became a major employer and after 1884 the construction of the railway works caused the population of the town to increase dramatically. The old industries have closed and <a href="urban_regeneration" title="wikilink">urban regeneration</a> has been led by out of town developments, particularly at <a href="Middlebrook,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Middlebrook</a>, which, since 1997 has been the base of <a href="Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." title="wikilink">Bolton Wanderers</a> football club, who play at the <a href="Macron_Stadium" title="wikilink">Macron Stadium</a>, having moved from <a href="Burnden_Park" title="wikilink">Burnden Park</a> near <a class="uri" href="Bolton" title="wikilink">Bolton</a> town centre.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The name Horwich derives from the <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> <em>har</em> and <em>wice</em>, meaning the place at the grey <a href="Ulmus_glabra" title="wikilink">wych-elm</a> and in 1221 was recorded as <em>Horewic</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The name was recorded as <em>Harewych</em> in 1277 and <em>Horewyche</em> in 1327.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">Middle Ages</a> Horwich originated as a <a href="Chase_(land)" title="wikilink">hunting chase</a> for the <a href="baron" title="wikilink">barons</a> of <a class="uri" href="Manchester" title="wikilink">Manchester</a>. It was held by <a href="Albert_de_Gresle" title="wikilink">Albert de Gresle</a> between 1086 and 1100.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1249 <a href="Henry_III_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry III</a> granted Thomas Gresle <a href="Warren_(free)" title="wikilink">free warren</a> over his lands in "Horewich". The barons appointed foresters and trespassers in the forest were brought before the <a href="court_baron" title="wikilink">court baron</a> or <a href="court_leet" title="wikilink">court leet</a> for punishment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In 1277 Robert Gresle the 7th baron prosecuted Martin de <a class="uri" href="Rumworth" title="wikilink">Rumworth</a> for carrying off deer in Horwich Chase<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> which was described in 1322 as being within "a circuit of sixteen <a href="League_(unit)" title="wikilink">leagues</a>, and is yearly worth in <a class="uri" href="pannage" title="wikilink">pannage</a>, <a href="nest" title="wikilink">aeries</a> of eagles, herons and goshawks, in honey, millstones, and iron mines, in charcoal-burning, and the like issues, 60 shillings; of which the vesture in oaks, elms and wholly covered with such, 160 <a href="Mark_(money)" title="wikilink">marks</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1598 a number of men were presented at the court leet for tithing and in 1621 the court leet recorded "paid for <a href="hue_and_cry" title="wikilink">hue and crye</a> that came from Horwich after the man who made an escape forth of ye <a class="uri" href="stocks" title="wikilink">stocks</a> for stealing certain lynen cloth 8<a href="Penny" title="wikilink">d</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> By the 17th century the amount of woodland in the Horwich forest was reduced by house building and for fuel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Horwich Moor was enclosed between 1815 and 1818 and race meetings were held between 1837 and 1847.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The manor became the property of the Andertons of Lostock Hall, <a href="Lostock,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Lostock</a>, who purchased it in 1599 from Nicholas and Elizabeth Mosley. These lands were confiscated by the crown in 1715 after the <a href="Battle_of_Preston_(1715)" title="wikilink">Battle of Preston</a>. They were leased to the Blundells whose coat of arms is displayed above the door at the Blundell Arms on Chorley Old Road.</p>

<p>The Pilkingtons were farmers who became gentry, Richard Pilkington was owner of rights in the Horwich Manor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> William Pilkington (1765–1831) became a physician and <a class="uri" href="apothecary" title="wikilink">apothecary</a> in St Helens and his sons Richard (1795–1869) and William (1800–1872) were the founders of <a href="Pilkington_Glass" title="wikilink">Pilkington Glass</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Ridgways provided land for the early 19th century Club Houses, a grid pattern development of streets of stone built cottages south of Church Street. Some had basements for hand loom weaving. In 1851 the occupants were crofters, stovers and bleachers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> In 1881 the population of 3,761 lived in 900 houses, and had remained stable for fifty years. A rapid increase in population over the next ten years was caused by the arrival of the railway works and W.T. Taylor's cotton mill. In the late 19th century, brick terraced houses, in streets named after famous engineers, were built near to Horwich Works on both sides of Chorley New Road (<a href="A673_road" title="wikilink">A673</a>) on company land.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> By 1891 Horwich was transformed into a town of 12,850 people.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="horwich-works">Horwich Works</h3>

<p>  In spring 1884 the <a href="Lancashire_and_Yorkshire_Railway" title="wikilink">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (L&amp;YR;) began construction of a large complex for building and maintaining locomotives to replace its works at <a href="Miles_Platting" title="wikilink">Miles Platting</a>. Horwich Works was built on 142 hectares of land bought for £36,000. The first workshop, Rivington House opened in February 1887. It is 106.7 metres long by 16.8 metres wide. The long brick built workshops had full-height arched windows and were separated by tram and rail tracks. Work to construct the three-bay, 463.3 metres long, 36 metres wide, erecting shop began in March 1885. Inside it were 20 overhead cranes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> By November 1886 the first locomotives arrived at the works for repair. The first Horwich built locomotive, Number 1008, left the works in 1887 and is preserved at the <a href="National_Railway_Museum" title="wikilink">National Railway Museum</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="First_World_War" title="wikilink">First</a> and <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World Wars</a>, the works played a part in the war effort manufacturing <a href="tank" title="wikilink">tanks</a> and <a href="munition" title="wikilink">munitions</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>The L&amp;YR; amalgamated with the <a href="London_and_North_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">London and North Western Railway</a> in 1922 becoming a constituent of the <a href="London,_Midland_and_Scottish_Railway" title="wikilink">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>, (LMS) in 1923. Horwich Works continued to build and repair locomotives for the LMS until the company was <a class="uri" href="nationalised" title="wikilink">nationalised</a> in 1948 by the <a href="Transport_Act_1947" title="wikilink">Transport Act 1947</a>, becoming <a href="British_Railways" title="wikilink">British Railways</a>. In 1962, British Railways transferred control of its main works to British Railways Workshops Division, with its headquarters in <a class="uri" href="Derby" title="wikilink">Derby</a>. In 1970 it was renamed <a href="British_Rail_Engineering_Limited" title="wikilink">British Rail Engineering Limited</a> (BREL).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>The last steam locomotive built at Horwich Works left on 27 November 1957 and the last diesel built there left on 28 December 1962. It was reduced to repairing engines and maintaining railway wagons. On 18 February 1983 <a class="uri" href="BREL" title="wikilink">BREL</a> announced that the works would close at the end of the year. Protest marches and spirited <a href="trade_union" title="wikilink">trade union</a> resistance failed to alter the decision and at 1 pm on Friday, 23 December 1983 Horwich Works closed after 97 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The freehold of the railway works site was transferred from British Rail to Bolton Council in the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>Many of Horwich's traditional industries, Horwich Works and W.T. Taylor's cotton mill closed in the late 20th century. Regeneration was led by the construction of the Macron Stadium for Bolton Wanderers at <a href="Middlebrook,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Middebrook</a> in 1995.

<p>It is not known when Horwich's first <a class="uri" href="chapel" title="wikilink">chapel</a> was built. It was a <a href="chapel_of_ease" title="wikilink">chapel of ease</a> to <a href="St._Mary_the_Virgin,_Deane" title="wikilink">St Mary's Church</a> in <a href="Deane,_Greater_Manchester" title="wikilink">Deane</a>, but in 1565 the commissioners for "removing superstitious ornaments" took various idolatrous items from the chapel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> In 1669 a <a class="uri" href="conventicle" title="wikilink">conventicle</a>, meeting of <a class="uri" href="nonconformists" title="wikilink">nonconformists</a>, was reported at Horwich and the ringleaders were prosecuted. A chapman, Philip Martindale, was among those whose estates were sequestrated for 'delinquency' by Parliament during the Civil Wars. In 1672 a nonconformist service was held at Old Lord's Farm, the home of <a href="Thomas_Willoughby,_11th_Baron_Willoughby_of_Parham" title="wikilink">Thomas Willoughby</a>. After the <a href="English_Civil_War" title="wikilink">civil war</a>, with the contrivance of Thomas Willoughby and the connivance of the vicar of Deane,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> the chapel was used by nonconformists.</p>

<p>In 1716 <a href="Francis_Gastrell" title="wikilink">Bishop Gastrell of Chester</a> recovered the chapel for the established church.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> The chapel was replaced in 1782 and rebuilt as <a href="Holy_Trinity_Church,_Horwich" title="wikilink">Holy Trinity Church</a>, a <a href="Commissioners'_Church" title="wikilink">Commissioners' Church</a>, in 1831.

<p>After being ejected from Horwich Chapel, Richard Pilkington built "New Chapel" for the nonconformists between 1716 and 1719. It was enlarged in 1805. In the 18th and 19th centuries other nonconformist churches and chapels were built.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Horwich Lee Chapel was formed in 1754 by <a class="uri" href="Presbyterian" title="wikilink">Presbyterian</a> members of the congregation of <a href="Rivington_Unitarian_Chapel" title="wikilink">Rivington Unitarian Chapel</a>. A chapel was erected in 1856, replacing one built in 1774. It became Lee Lane Congregational Church and closed in 2005. A preacher from Bolton introduced <a class="uri" href="Methodism" title="wikilink">Methodism</a> in the early 19th century and a chapel opened in about 1810. The Independent Methodist chapel in Lee Lane was built in 1867, "the congregation having originated some years earlier in a gathering of teetotallers". Primitive Methodists had a chapel on Horwich Moor and a <a href="Baptists" title="wikilink">Baptist</a> church was built in 1890.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>

<p>Before 1884 Roman Catholics attended mass at Anderton Hall. In 1886, Father Hampson opened St Mary's Roman Catholic Church on Chorley New Road. The church and presbytery built by Father McGrath date from 1906. Its two altars are the work of Ferdinando Stuflesser.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
