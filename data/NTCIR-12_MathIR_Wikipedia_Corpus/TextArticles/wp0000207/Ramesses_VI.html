<h1>Ramesses VI</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun</strong> (also written <strong>Ramses</strong> and <strong>Rameses</strong>) was the fifth ruler of the <a href="Twentieth_dynasty_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">Twentieth dynasty of Egypt</a> who reigned from <a href="1145_BC" title="wikilink">1145 BC</a> to <a href="1137_BC" title="wikilink">1137 BC</a> and a son of <a href="Ramesses_III" title="wikilink">Ramesses III</a> by <a href="Iset_Ta-Hemdjert" title="wikilink">Iset Ta-Hemdjert</a>. His royal tomb, <a class="uri" href="KV9" title="wikilink">KV9</a>, is located near <a class="uri" href="Tutankhamun" title="wikilink">Tutankhamun</a>'s tomb in the <a href="Valley_of_the_Kings" title="wikilink">Valley of the Kings</a>.</p>

<p>Ramesses' prenomen or royal name was Nebmaatre-meryamun meaning "Lord of Justice is Re, Beloved of Amun" while his royal epithet—Amunherkhepshef Netjer-heqa-iunu—translates as "Amun is his Strength, God Ruler of Heliopolis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The first to establish beyond doubt that Ramesses VI lived into his 8th Regnal Year was the Dutch Egyptologist Jac. J. Janssen. He based this on Ostracon IFAO 1425, which mentions the loan of an ox in year 8 of a king which can only have been Ramesses VI.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> His 8th Regnal Year also seems to be attested in Theban <a href="Graffito_(archaeology)" title="wikilink">graffito</a> 1860a, which names the then serving <a href="High_Priest_of_Amun" title="wikilink">High Priest of Amun</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ramessesnakht" title="wikilink">Ramessesnakht</a>. In the past, this graffito has been ascribed to Ramesses X,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but this interpretation has been abandoned and its ascription to Ramesses VI seems by far the best solution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Raphael Ventura's interesting reconstruction of a damaged sum in <em>Turin Papyrus 1907+1908</em>, also seems to suggest that Ramesses VI enjoyed a reign of 8 full years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The latest scholarly publication on Egyptian chronology in 2006 also assigned Ramesses VI 8 years of rule, based on the aforementioned sources.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Ramesses VI probably lived for two months into his brief 9th regnal year before he died and was succeeded by his son, <a href="Ramesses_VII" title="wikilink">Ramesses VII</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Ramesses VI's chief queen was <a class="uri" href="Nubkhesbed" title="wikilink">Nubkhesbed</a> who is "mentioned on a stela of Iset E (her daughter; name also spelled as Isis) from <a href="Qift" title="wikilink">Koptos</a>, and also in tomb <a class="uri" href="KV13" title="wikilink">KV13</a> in the Valley of the Kings."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This pharaoh would be succeeded on the throne by his son <a href="Ramesses_VII" title="wikilink">Ramesses VII</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reign">Reign</h2>

<p> Egypt's political and economic decline continued unabated during Ramesses VI's reign; he is the last king of Egypt's New Kingdom whose name is attested in the <a class="uri" href="Sinai" title="wikilink">Sinai</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> At Thebes, the power of the chief priests of Amun <a class="uri" href="Ramessesnakht" title="wikilink">Ramessesnakht</a> grew at the expense of Pharaoh despite the fact that <a href="Iset_(priestess)" title="wikilink"> Iset</a>, Ramesses VI's daughter, was connected to the Amun priesthood "in her role as <a href="God's_Wife_of_Amun" title="wikilink">God's Wife of Amun</a> or Divine Adoratice."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Shortly after his burial, his tomb was penetrated and ransacked by grave robbers who hacked away at his hands and feet in order to gain access to his jewelry. A medical examination of his mummy which was found in <a class="uri" href="KV35" title="wikilink">KV35</a> in 1898 revealed severe damage to his body, with the head and torso being broken into several pieces by an axe used by the tomb robbers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The creation of Ramesses VI's tomb, however, protected <a class="uri" href="Tutankhamun" title="wikilink">Tutankhamun</a>'s own intact tomb from grave robbers since debris from its formation was dumped over the tomb entrance to the boy king's tomb.</p>
