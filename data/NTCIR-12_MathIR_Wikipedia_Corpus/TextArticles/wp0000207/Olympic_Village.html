<h1>Olympic Village</h1>
<hr/>

<p>An <strong>Olympic Village</strong> is an accommodation center built for the <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympic Games</a>, usually within an Olympic Park or elsewhere in a host city. Olympic Villages are built to house all participating athletes, as well as officials and athletic trainers. After the <a href="Munich_Massacre" title="wikilink">Munich Massacre</a> at the <a href="1972_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1972 Olympics</a>, the Villages have been made extremely secure. Only athletes, trainers and officials are allowed to room at the Village, though family members and former Olympic athletes are allowed inside with proper checks. Press and media are also barred.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The idea of the Olympic Village comes from Pierre de Coubertin. Up until the <a href="1924_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1924 Summer Olympic Games</a>, National Olympic Committees rented locations around the host city to house participants, which was expensive. For the 1924 Summer Olympics, the organizers built cabins near the Stade Olympique de Colombes to allow the athletes to easily access the Games' venues. The Olympic Village of the <a href="1932_Summer_Olympics" title="wikilink">1932 Summer Olympics</a> served as the model of today's Olympic Villages; it consisted of a group of buildings with rooms to lodge athletes, and buildings with other accommodations.</p>
<h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>

<p>It has been widely reported that large amounts of partying and sexual intercourse occur at Olympic Villages.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> For the 2014 games in Sochi, 100,000 free condoms were provided by the IOC for the 6,000 athletes in attendance (a rough average of about 16 condoms per athlete); for the 2012 games in London, 150,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Despite seemingly large numbers, several instances have occurred where smaller orders have resulted in shortages. Sydney famously only provided 70,000 condoms but ran out, discovering the need to order 20,000 more.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
