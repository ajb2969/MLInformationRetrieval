<h1>Pink-eared duck</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>pink-eared duck</strong> (<em>Malacorhynchus membranaceus</em>) is a species of <a class="uri" href="duck" title="wikilink">duck</a> found in <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a>. It has a large spatulate bill like the <a href="Australasian_shoveler" title="wikilink">Australasian shoveler</a>, but is smaller at 38–40 cm length. Its brown back and crown, black and white barred sides and black eye patches on its otherwise white face make this <a class="uri" href="bird" title="wikilink">bird</a> unmistakable. Juveniles are slightly duller, but otherwise all plumages are similar. Its vernacular name refers to a pink spot in the corner formed by the black head pattern; it is only noticeable at close distance however, making the seldom-used Australian name of zebra duck more appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="taxonomy-and-systematics">Taxonomy and systematics</h2>

<p>It is the only living member of the genus <em>Malacorhynchus</em>; a closely related, but slightly larger extinct form from <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> was described as <a href="Scarlett's_duck" title="wikilink">Scarlett's duck</a> (<em>Malacorhynchus scarletti</em>). This peculiar duck may be most closely related to the <a href="Tadorninae" title="wikilink">shelducks</a> but its relationships are enigmatic. It may be closer to the <a href="musk_duck" title="wikilink">musk duck</a> and the <a href="stiff-tail" title="wikilink">stiff-tails</a> (Sraml <em>et al.</em> 1996) and, formerly placed in the <a class="uri" href="paraphyletic" title="wikilink">paraphyletic</a> "<a href="perching_duck" title="wikilink">perching ducks</a>"; it is in any case not close to the <a href="dabbling_duck" title="wikilink">dabbling ducks</a>.</p>

<p>This species is the only member of the order Anseriformes known to have carotenoid pigments in its feathers, in the characteristic pink "ear" spot.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The pink-eared duck was reportedly known as the New Holland duck by early colonists in Western Australia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>

<p>Widely distributed throughout Australia and highly mobile, these ducks can appear anywhere there is standing water, especially in dry inland regions, where annual rainfall rarely exceeds .</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>

<p> They are dependent on <a class="uri" href="plankton" title="wikilink">plankton</a>, as well as <a href="crustacean" title="wikilink">crustaceans</a>, <a href="mollusk" title="wikilink">mollusks</a> and <a href="insect" title="wikilink">insects</a>. Their bill is well designed for straining minute organisms, with pliable <a href="mandible" title="wikilink">mandibular</a> flaps that channel water in a manner that allow the ducks to filter algae and other plankton efficiently. They also feed by vortexing, in which two ducks spin about a central point with the head of one opposite the tail of the other, concentrating food in a gyrating water column.</p>
<h2 id="breeding">Breeding</h2>

<p>Nesting is stimulated by the drying and filling of pools that promote increased levels of organic material. In good years, large numbers of pink-eared ducks concentrate in shallow flood plains. However, when conditions do not meet specifications, reproduction may be completely curtailed.</p>
