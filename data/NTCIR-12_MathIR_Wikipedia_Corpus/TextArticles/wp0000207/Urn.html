<h1>Urn</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p>An <strong>urn</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="vase" title="wikilink">vase</a>, ordinarily covered, that usually has a narrowed neck above a footed <a class="uri" href="pedestal" title="wikilink">pedestal</a>.</p>

<p>In Classical terms, an urn is a large decorative covered container of wood, metal, pottery, etc. In furniture, it was a large wooden vase-like container which was usually set on a pedestal on either side of a side table. This was the characteristic of <a href="Adam_style" title="wikilink">Adam</a> designs and also of <a href="George_Hepplewhite" title="wikilink">Hepplewhite</a>'s work. Urns were also used as decorative turnings at the cross points of stretchers in 16th and 17th century furniture designs. The urn and the vase were often set on the central pedestal in a "broken" or "swan's" neck pediment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>Funerary urns</strong> (also called <strong>cinerary urns</strong> and <strong>burial urns</strong>) were used by many civilizations. After a person died, survivors <a class="uri" href="cremated" title="wikilink">cremated</a> the body and collected the ashes in an urn. Pottery urns, dating from about 7000 BC, have been found in an early <a class="uri" href="Jiahu" title="wikilink">Jiahu</a> site in China, where a total of 32 burial urns are found,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and another early finds are in Laoguantai, <a class="uri" href="Shaanxi" title="wikilink">Shaanxi</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> There are about 700 burial urns unearthed over the <a href="Yangshao_culture" title="wikilink">Yangshao</a> (5000–3000 BC) areas and consisting more than 50 varieties of form and shape. The burial urns were used mainly for children, but also sporadically for adults.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In ancient Greece, the <em><a class="uri" href="lekythos" title="wikilink">lekythos</a></em>, a type of <a href="Pottery_of_ancient_Greece" title="wikilink">pottery in ancient Greece</a>, was used for holding oil in funerary rituals. In the <a href="Bavaria" title="wikilink">Bavarian</a> tradition, a king's heart would be placed in the urn upon his death (as happened with King <a href="Otto_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Otto of Bavaria</a> in 1916). Cremation urns were also commonly used in early <a href="Anglo-Saxon_paganism" title="wikilink">Anglo Saxon</a> <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and in many <a href="Pre-Columbian_culture" title="wikilink">Pre-Columbian cultures</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Romans</a> placed the urns in a niche in a collective <a class="uri" href="tomb" title="wikilink">tomb</a> called a <em><a class="uri" href="columbarium" title="wikilink">columbarium</a></em> (literally, <a class="uri" href="dovecote" title="wikilink">dovecote</a>). The interior of a dovecote usually has niches to house <a class="uri" href="doves" title="wikilink">doves</a>.</p>

<p>The discovery of a <a href="Bronze_Age" title="wikilink">Bronze Age</a> urn burial in <a href="Norfolk,_England" title="wikilink">Norfolk, England</a>, prompted Sir <a href="Thomas_Browne" title="wikilink">Thomas Browne</a> to carefully describe the antiquities found. He expanded his study to survey burial and funerary customs, ancient and current, and published it as <em><a href="Hydriotaphia,_Urn_Burial" title="wikilink">Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial</a></em> (1658).</p>

<p>In the modern <a href="Death_care_industry" title="wikilink">funeral industry</a>, cremation urns of varying quality, elaborateness, and cost are offered, and urns are another source of potential profit for an industry concerned that a trend toward cremation might threaten profits from traditional burial ceremonies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Biodegradable_urn" title="wikilink">Biodegradable urns</a> are sometimes used for both human and animal burial. They are made from <a href="Environmentally_friendly" title="wikilink">eco-friendly</a> materials such as recycled or handmade paper, salt, cellulose or other natural products that are capable of <a href="Biodegradation" title="wikilink">decomposing</a> back into natural elements, and sometimes include a seed intended to grow into a tree at the site of the burial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Besides the traditional funeral or cremation ashes urns, it is also possible to keep a part of the ashes of the loved one or beloved pet in keepsake urns or ash jewelry. It is even possible to place the ashes of two people in so-called companion urns. <a href="http://artisurn.com/pages/types-of-urns">Source</a> Cremation or funeral urns are made from a variety of materials such as wood, nature stone, ceramic, glass, or steel.</p>

<p>Scattering of ashes has become popular over the last decade. As a result, urns designed to scatter the ashes from have been developed. Some are eco-friendly, affordable and can be recycled after being used.</p>

<p>A tea urn is a heated metal container traditionally used to brew tea or boil water in large quantities in factories, canteens or churches. They are not usually found in domestic use. Like a <a class="uri" href="samovar" title="wikilink">samovar</a> it has a small tap near the base for extracting either tea or hot water. Unlike an <a href="electric_water_boiler" title="wikilink">electric water boiler</a>, tea may be brewed in the vessel itself, although they are equally likely to be used to fill a large <a class="uri" href="teapot" title="wikilink">teapot</a>.</p>

<p>"Knife urns" placed on pedestals flanking a dining-room <a class="uri" href="sideboard" title="wikilink">sideboard</a> were an English innovation for high-style <a href="dining_room" title="wikilink">dining rooms</a> of the late 1760s. They went out of fashion in the following decade, in favour of knife boxes that were placed on the sideboard.</p>
