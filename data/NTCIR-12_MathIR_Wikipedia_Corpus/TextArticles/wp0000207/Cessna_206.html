<p>The <strong>Cessna 205</strong>, <strong>206</strong>, and <strong>207</strong>, known variously as the <strong>Super Skywagon</strong>, <strong>Skywagon</strong>, <strong>Stationair</strong>, and <strong>Super Skylane</strong> are a family of single-engined, general aviation aircraft with fixed landing gear, used in commercial air service and also for personal use. The family was originally developed from the popular retractable-gear <a href="Cessna_210" title="wikilink">Cessna 210</a> and is produced by <a class="uri" href="Cessna" title="wikilink">Cessna</a>.</p>

<p>The line's combination of a powerful engine, rugged construction and a large cabin has made these aircraft popular <a href="bush_plane" title="wikilink">bush planes</a>. Cessna describes the 206 as "the sport-utility vehicle of the air." These airplanes are also used for aerial photography, skydiving and other utility purposes. They can also be equipped with floats, amphibious floats and skis. Alternatively, they can be fitted with luxury appointments for use as a personal air transport.</p>

<p>From 1962 to 2006 Cessna produced 8,509 aircraft in the 205, 206 and 207 variants.</p>

<p> The Cessna 205 was introduced late in 1962 as a 1963 <a href="model_year" title="wikilink">model year</a>. The six-seat aircraft was essentially a Cessna 210 with fixed landing gear and with changes to the crew and passenger door arrangement, being officially designated by Cessna as a "Model 210-5".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The 205 retained the early 210’s engine <a class="uri" href="cowling" title="wikilink">cowling</a> bulge, originally where the 210 stowed its nosewheel on retraction. This distinctive cowling was made more streamlined on the later Cessna 206.</p>

<p>The 205 is powered by a <a href="Continental_O-470" title="wikilink">Continental IO-470-S</a> engine producing .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The 205 was produced in only two model years - 1963 and 1964 before being replaced in production by the Cessna 206. A total of 576 Cessna 205s were produced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cessna-206">Cessna 206</h3>

<p>The six-seat Model 206 was introduced as a 1964 model and was built until 1986, when Cessna halted production of its single-engined product line. It was then re-introduced in 1998 and remains in production in 2013.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>There were many sub-variants, including the U206, P206 all certified to CAR3 standards and later 206H certified to <a href="Federal_Aviation_Regulations" title="wikilink">FAR</a> Part 23.</p>

<p>The total Model 206 production between 1964 and 2004 was 6,581 aircraft.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="cessna-u206">Cessna U206</h4>

<p>The original 1964 model was the U206, powered by a  <a href="Continental_O-520" title="wikilink">Continental IO-520-A</a>. The “U” designation indicated “utility” and this model was equipped with a pilot side door and large clamshell rear door serving the back two rows of seats, allowing easy loading of oversized cargo.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>There was a TU206 turbocharged version powered by the <a href="Continental_O-520" title="wikilink">Continental TSIO-520-C</a> engine producing . After 1967 the turbo TU206 was powered by a TSIO-520-F of  (the extra  were obtained by turning the engine at a higher rpm, and was only allowed for five minutes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Due to the large propeller diameter, the additional engine speed meant that the propeller tips were pushed to transonic speeds, which required much more power.</p>

<p>From 1964 to 1969 the U206 was known as the “Super Skywagon”. From 1970 it was named the “Stationair”, a contraction of “Station Wagon of the Air”, which is a good description of the aircraft's intended role. Sub-variants were designated U206 to U206G.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1977 the U206 had its engine upgraded to a Continental IO-520-F of  (continuous rating, obtained at a lower speed than the previous IO-520-F) and the TU206 powerplant was changed to the TSIO-520-M producing .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Production of all versions of the U206 was halted in 1986 when Cessna stopped manufacturing all piston-engined aircraft. A total of 5,208 U206s had been produced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="cessna-p206">Cessna P206</h4>

<p>1965 saw the P206 added to the line. In this case the “P” stood for “people”, as the P206 had passenger doors similar to the Cessna 210 from which it was derived, on both sides.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>The P206 was produced from 1965 to 1970 and was powered by a Continental IO-520-A of . There was a turbocharged model designated TP206 which was powered by a Continental TSIO-520-A also of .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>647 P206s were produced under the name “Super Skylane” which made it sound like a version of the <a href="Cessna_182" title="wikilink">Cessna 182</a>, which it was not. Sub-variants were designated P206 to P206E.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="cessna-206h">Cessna 206H</h4>

<p>After a production hiatus of twelve years, Cessna started manufacturing a new version of the venerable 206 in 1998, with the introduction of the newly certified 206H.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The “H” model is generally similar to the previous U206 configuration, with a pilot entry door and a rear double clamshell door for access to the middle and back seats. The "H" is marketed under the name "Stationair".</p>

<p>The 206H is powered by a <a href="Lycoming_O-540" title="wikilink">Lycoming IO-540-AC1A</a> powerplant producing . The turbocharged T206H is powered by a <a href="Lycoming_O-540" title="wikilink">Lycoming TSIO-540-AJ1A</a> engine of .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Even though the Cessna 206H is certified as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, <a href="Transport_Canada" title="wikilink">Transport Canada</a> has only certified it to carry five people in <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>. This is due to concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the flaps extended. Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; it was a hot summer day). A switch was added to the flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. The other part of the problem is that if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about ) then open the rear door and restow the rear door handle. This then gives enough clearance to open the rear part of the door.</p>

<p>Both the 206H and the T206H remain in production in 2013. By the end of 2004 Cessna had produced 221 206Hs and 505 T206Hs, for a total production of 726 "H" models.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>Cessna has indicated that they do not intend to produce a P206-configuration aircraft in the future, due to lack of market demand.</p>
<h3 id="cessna-207">Cessna 207</h3>

<p>The Model 207 was a seven- and later eight-seat development of the 206, achieved by stretching the design further by <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> to allow space for more seats. The nose section was extended  by adding a constant-section nose baggage compartment between the passenger compartment and the engine firewall; the aft section was extended by <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> by inserting a constant-area section in the fuselage area just aft of the aft wing attach point. Thus the propeller's ground clearance was unaffected by the change (the nosewheel had moved forward the same distance as the propeller), but the tail moved aft relative to the mainwheel position, which made landing (without striking the tailskid on the runway) a greater challenge. The move gave that airplane a larger turning radius, since the distance between mainwheels and nosewheel increased by  but the nosewheel's maximum allowed deflection was not increased.</p>

<p>The 207 was introduced as a 1969 model featuring a Continental IO-520-F engine of . A turbocharged version was equipped with a TSIO-520-G of the same output.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>At the beginning of production the model was called a Cessna 207 “Skywagon”, but in 1977 the name was changed to “Stationair 7”. 1977 also saw a change of engine on the turbocharged version to a Continental TSIO-520-M producing  – the same engine used in the TU206 of the same vintage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The 207 added a seat in 1980 and was then known as the “Stationair 8”. Production of the 207 was completed in 1984, just two years before U206 production halted. A total of 626 Cessna 207s were manufactured.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The Cessna Model 207 has been popular with air taxi companies, particularly on short runs where its full seating capacity could be used. Very few of these aircraft have seen private use.</p>
<h3 id="modifications">Modifications</h3>

<p>In April 2007 <a class="uri" href="Thielert" title="wikilink">Thielert</a> announced that the <a href="European_Aviation_Safety_Agency" title="wikilink">European Aviation Safety Agency</a> had granted a <a href="Supplemental_Type_Certificate" title="wikilink">Supplemental Type Certificate</a> (STC) for conversion of Cessna 206s to the Thielert V-8 diesel powerplant. The STC allows conversion of the following models: U206F and TU206F with the  powerplant, and the U206G, TU206G, 206H and T206H with the  version.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> This modification does not require any changes to the engine cowling. In May 2008, Thielert entered insolvency proceedings, so the future availability of this diesel conversion is uncertain.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Soloy Aviation Solutions offers a <a class="uri" href="turboprop" title="wikilink">turboprop</a> conversion for some 206/207 models based on the  Allison C20S engine/gearbox package. However, extensive engine cowl modifications are required.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Atlantic Aero offers an FAA <a href="Supplemental_Type_Certificate" title="wikilink">STC</a> conversion to the <a href="Continental_IO-550" title="wikilink">Continental IO-550</a> powerplant. No cowl modifications are required.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Both Kenmore Air (<a href="Edo_floats" title="wikilink">Edo floats</a>) and Wipaire (Wipline floats) offer seaplane conversions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
