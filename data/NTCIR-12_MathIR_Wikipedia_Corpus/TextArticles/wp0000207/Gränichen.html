<p>Near the southern border, at an average distance of two kilometers, there are three hamlets, which also belong to the <a href="municipalities_of_Switzerland" title="wikilink">municipality</a> of Gränichen: Rütihof () on Moorbergs, Bleien () and Refental () between Breitenberg, Dossen and Surberg.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>History's first mention of Gränichen was around 1184 under the name of <em>Cranechon</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, archaeological discoveries dating from the <a class="uri" href="Neolithic" title="wikilink">Neolithic</a>, as well as the remains of a <a href="Celts" title="wikilink">Celtic</a> castle, show that the area around Gränichen has been settled for quite some time.</p>

<p>In the 12th century Gränichen belonged to the <a href="monastery_of_Engelberg" title="wikilink">monastery of Engelberg</a> and later came under the reign of the <a href="Habsburg" title="wikilink">Habsburgs</a>, who passed the government of the village to the Lords of the Castle of <a class="uri" href="Liebegg" title="wikilink">Liebegg</a>. After 1415, Gränichen belonged to <a class="uri" href="Bern" title="wikilink">Bern</a>.</p>

<p>The construction of the <a class="uri" href="Wynentalbahn" title="wikilink">Wynentalbahn</a> railway in 1904 promoted the settlement of local industries.</p>
<h2 id="coat-of-arms">Coat of arms</h2>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="blazon" title="wikilink">blazon</a> of the municipal <a href="coat_of_arms" title="wikilink">coat of arms</a> is <em>Per bend sinister Or and Azure a Bend counterchanged.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="points-of-interest">Points of interest</h2>

<p> The castle of Liebegg resides on a hill close to the border to <a class="uri" href="Teufenthal" title="wikilink">Teufenthal</a>, about three kilometers south-south-east of the village center. The Castle, which dates from the 11th century, is nowadays used as a center for culture, meetings and congresses.</p>

<p>Near the village center one finds the "Chornhaus", which, built in 1695, looks very similar to a small castle, because of its tower. Until 1798 it served as a granary and was thereafter used by the municipal administration department for over a century. Since the new parish hall was completed in 1995 it contains a small village museum.</p>

<p>The Reformed Church was built from 1661 to 1663 on the site where the previous church had collapsed. It is one of the main works of Protestant church building in the canton of Aargau, and is listed as a <a href="Swiss_inventory_of_cultural_property_of_national_and_regional_significance" title="wikilink">heritage site of national significance</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
