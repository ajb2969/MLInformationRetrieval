LMU's  campus borders on <a href="Cumberland_Gap_National_Historical_Park" title="wikilink">Cumberland Gap National Historical Park</a>. As a whole, LMU is <a href="school_accreditation" title="wikilink">accredited</a> by the <a href="Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools" title="wikilink">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACS). In December 2014, the law school received provisional accreditation by the <a href="American_Bar_Association" title="wikilink">American Bar Association</a>.</p>

<p>LMU's <a href="Abraham_Lincoln_Library_and_Museum" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> houses a large collection of memorabilia relating to the school's namesake, <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>. The collection was initially formed from donations by the school's early benefactor, General <a href="Oliver_O._Howard" title="wikilink">Oliver O. Howard</a>, and his friends.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>As of fall 2014, it has 1,699 undergraduate, 933 graduate and 1,103 professional students.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In the 1880s, an energetic entrepreneur named <a href="Alexander_Arthur" title="wikilink">Alexander Arthur</a> (1846–1912) and several associates established a firm called American Association, Ltd., the primary purpose of which was to develop the iron ore and coal resources of the Cumberland Gap area. Arthur founded <a href="Middlesboro,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Middlesboro, Kentucky</a> for the company's employees and furnaces, and constructed a railroad line connecting Middlesboro with <a href="Knoxville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>. Arthur believed Middlesboro would grow into a large industrial city, the so-called "Pittsburgh of the South." In 1888, he founded the city of Harrogate, which he envisioned would someday be a suburb for Middlesboro's elite.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Arthur and American Association spent some two million dollars developing Harrogate, the jewel of which was the Four Seasons Hotel, a 700-room structure believed to have been the largest hotel in the U.S. at the time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The hotel included a lavish dining hall, a casino, and a separate <a href="sanatorium" title="wikilink">sanitarium</a>. The economic panic of the early 1890s and the subsequent collapse of Arthur's London financial backers doomed American Associates and the Four Seasons was sold and dismantled.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1896, General Oliver O. Howard, a former <a href="Union_(American_Civil_War)" title="wikilink">Union</a> officer who had helped establish <a href="Howard_University" title="wikilink">Howard University</a> (named for him), embarked on a lecture tour. Howard's agent, Cyrus Kehr, suggested Howard establish a university as a living memorial to President <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="wikilink">Abraham Lincoln</a>. On June 18, 1896, Howard spoke at the Harrow School, an elementary school at <a href="Cumberland_Gap,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Cumberland Gap</a> founded a few years earlier by Reverend A. A. Myers. After the lecture, Myers asked Howard for assistance in establishing a college for the Cumberland Gap region. Howard related to Myers a conversation he had with Lincoln in 1863 in which the president expressed a desire to do something to help the people of <a href="East_Tennessee" title="wikilink">East Tennessee</a>, a majority of whom remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War in spite of the greater state's secession, and, remembering Kehr's suggestion, agreed to help Myers establish a university in Lincoln's honor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>With the help of Howard and Kehr, Myers purchased the Four Seasons property, although the sanitarium building was all that remained of the once lavish hotel. Lincoln Memorial University was chartered on February 12, 1897— Lincoln's 88th birthday— with Cyrus Kehr as its first president. Howard joined the university as its managing director in 1898, and under his leadership the university expanded,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> acquiring among other places Alexander Arthur's house, which the university used as a <a href="College_or_university_school_of_music" title="wikilink">conservatory</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Howard mentioned the university and its purpose in a speech at <a href="Carnegie_Hall" title="wikilink">Carnegie Hall</a> in 1901, which helped raise money and allowed the university to pay off its debts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1902, the sanitarium building burned, and its surviving blocks were used to build Grant-Lee Hall, which has since been placed on the <a href="National_Register_of_Historic_Places" title="wikilink">National Register of Historic Places</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Arthur's house also burned, but its tower, now called "Conservatory Tower," still stands.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> In April 1917, British folklorist <a href="Cecil_Sharp" title="wikilink">Cecil Sharp</a> spent several days at Lincoln Memorial University, where he collected 22 local versions of "old world" ballads such as "<a href="Lord_Thomas_and_Fair_Annet" title="wikilink">Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor</a>," "<a href="The_Daemon_Lover" title="wikilink">The Daemon Lover</a>," and "<a href="Lady_Isabel_and_the_Elf_Knight" title="wikilink">Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="literary-legacy-and-the-mountain-heritage-literary-festival">Literary Legacy and The Mountain Heritage Literary Festival</h2>

<p>LMU is known for a rich literary history that includes such renowned authors as <a href="James_Still" title="wikilink">James Still</a> (River of Earth, The Wolfpen Poems), <a href="Jesse_Stuart" title="wikilink">Jesse Stuart</a> (Taps for Private Tussie, The Thread That Runs So True), <a href="Don_West_(educator)" title="wikilink">Don West</a> (Clods of Southern Earth), and <a href="George_Scarbrough" title="wikilink">George Scarbrough</a> (Tellico Blue). At one point, <a href="Emma_Bell_Miles" title="wikilink">Emma Bell Miles</a>, author and painter, served as Artist-in-Residence at the university, a position that went unfilled until it was taken over by bestselling novelist <a href="Silas_House" title="wikilink">Silas House</a> (Clay's Quilt, The Coal Tattoo) in 2005. House started the Mountain Heritage Literary Festival that same year and the gathering has grown steadily, featuring the region's most celebrated writers (<a href="Lee_Smith_(fiction_author)" title="wikilink">Lee Smith</a>, <a href="Earl_Hamner,_Jr." title="wikilink">Earl Hamner, Jr.</a>, <a href="Ron_Rash" title="wikilink">Ron Rash</a>, <a href="Sheila_Kay_Adams" title="wikilink">Sheila Kay Adams</a>, <a href="Denise_Giardina" title="wikilink">Denise Giardina</a>, etc.) and becoming one of the premier events of Appalachian literature.</p>
<h2 id="college-of-veterinary-medicine">College of Veterinary Medicine</h2>

<p>The College of Veterinary Medicine is located on the campus of LMU in Harrogate. Classes are taught in the MANS Building, completed in 2012, which is the largest building on the LMU campus. The MANS building also provides faculty and student research facilities. The Veterinary Teaching and Research Center (VMTRC) is located 12 miles from Harrogate in <a href="Ewing,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Ewing, Virginia</a>. The facilities, housed on 700 acres, provide extensive hands-on experience and educational opportunities with a wide variety of species. The Large Animal Component of the VTRC provides a “working farm” environment with a large herd of cattle, and provides a "hands-on" education site where anatomy, clinical, and surgical skills are taught for dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and sheep.</p>
<h2 id="debusk-college-of-osteopathic-medicine">DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine</h2>

<p> The initial plans to open Lincoln Memorial University-DeBusk College of <a href="Osteopathic_Medicine" title="wikilink">Osteopathic Medicine</a> (LMU-DCOM) began in 2004. <a href="Autry_O.V._Pete_DeBusk" title="wikilink">Autry O.V. Pete DeBusk</a>, the Chairman of the LMU Board of Trustees and LMU alumnus, was interested in starting a college of osteopathic medicine at LMU. After conducting a year-long feasibility study, LMU announced it was pursuing the development of a college of osteopathic medicine and named Ray Stowers, <a href="Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine" title="wikilink">D.O.</a>, F.A.C.O.F.P., a rural <a href="family_physician" title="wikilink">family physician</a>, as vice president and dean.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The college was named DeBusk College of Osteopathic Medicine in honor of its initiator. The four-story,  building was opened to its inaugural class of osteopathic medical students on August 1, 2007.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>The Debusk College of Osteopathic Medicine offers two degrees, a <a href="Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine" title="wikilink">Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine</a>, and a <a href="Master_of_Science" title="wikilink">Master of Science</a> in <a href="Physician_Assistant" title="wikilink">Physician Assistant</a> Studies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The college is accredited by the <a href="Commission_on_Osteopathic_College_Accreditation" title="wikilink">Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation</a> (COCA) and the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The curriculum is divided into preclinical sciences (years 1 and 2), and the clinical experiences (years 3 and 4). To help the students develop diagnostic and problem solving skills, the curricula at DCOM emphasizes the integration of the basic and clinical sciences in medical practice. </p>

<p>In the spring of 2008, Lincoln Memorial University announced plans to seek approval to offer legal education leading to the <a href="Juris_Doctor" title="wikilink">Juris Doctor</a> degree. The law school, named in honor of Tennessee Congressman <a href="John_James_Duncan,_Jr." title="wikilink">John James Duncan, Jr.</a>, is located in downtown <a href="Knoxville,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Knoxville, Tennessee</a> in the building commonly referred to as “<a href="Old_City_Hall_(Knoxville)" title="wikilink">Old City Hall</a>.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The entering class of the Fall 2011 full-time program had an average LSAT score of 147 while the part-time program had an average LSAT score of 145.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> These scores represent 33rd and 26th percentile of all LSAT test takers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The average GPA for the entering class of 2011 is 3.01 for the full-time program and 2.99 for the part-time program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

In December 2011, the American Bar Association refused the school's application for provisional accreditation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> In reaction, the Duncan School decided to forego the ABA's administrative appeal process and instead sued the ABA, alleging that the ABA was using accreditation to limit the production of new lawyers, thus violating federal <a class="uri" href="antitrust" title="wikilink">antitrust</a> laws.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> In January 2012, after a judge denied the school's requests for an injunction and temporary restraining order against the ABA, the school filed an appeal with the ABA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> As a result of the ABA's denial of provisional accreditation, numerous students withdrew or sought to transfer from Duncan School of Law.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>In February 2012, Duncan School of Law was sued by a former student for "negligent enrollment."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p>Lincoln Memorial University’s Knoxville law school has received provisional accreditation, ending a three-year bid for approval that included multiple applications, a federal lawsuit and changes in the school’s leadership.</p>
<h2 id="athletics">Athletics</h2>

<p>Sports teams, called the "Railsplitters", compete in <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> <a href="Division_II_(NCAA)" title="wikilink">Division II</a> in the <a href="South_Atlantic_Conference" title="wikilink">South Atlantic Conference</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years the teams have enjoyed great success on the field and in the classroom. Academically, the 2000–01 women's basketball team led the NCAA Division II in team GPA and both soccer teams' 3.0 or better cumulative GPA have won them recognition from the <a class="uri" href="NSCAA" title="wikilink">NSCAA</a> for the past few years.</p>
