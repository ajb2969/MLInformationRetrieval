<h1>Ann Arbor Railroad (1895–1976)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Ann Arbor Railroad</strong>  was a former <a href="Class_I_railroad" title="wikilink">Class I Railroad</a> that operated from <a href="Toledo,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Toledo</a> to <a href="Elberta,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Elberta</a>, a distance of about 300 miles. From <a href="Elberta,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Elberta</a>, the <a href="Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1895-1976)" title="wikilink">AA</a> operated several <a href="Train_ferry" title="wikilink">car ferry</a> routes until 1982. The <a href="Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1895-1976)" title="wikilink">AA</a> was absorbed by <a href="Consolidated_Rail_Corporation" title="wikilink">Conrail</a> on April 1, 1976 and then by the <a href="Michigan_Interstate_Railway_Company" title="wikilink">Michigan Interstate Railway Company</a> on October 1, 1977. On September 30, 1982, <a href="Michigan_Interstate_Railway_Company" title="wikilink">Michigan Interstate Railway Company</a> operations ceased north of <a href="Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor</a>. The remaining portions of the <a href="Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1895-1976)" title="wikilink">AA</a> from <a href="Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor</a> to <a href="Elberta,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Elberta</a> were split between the <a href="Tuscola_and_Saginaw_Bay_Railway" title="wikilink">Tuscola and Saginaw Bay Railway</a>, running from <a href="Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor</a> to <a href="Alma,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Alma</a>, and the <a href="Michigan_Northern_Railway" title="wikilink">Michigan Northern Railway</a>, running from <a href="Alma,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Alma</a> to <a href="Elberta,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Elberta</a>. Today, the only portion of railroad operated under the <a href="Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1988)" title="wikilink">AA</a> name is the portion from <a href="Toledo,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Toledo</a> to <a href="Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The history of the Ann Arbor Railroad (AA) began with two companies organized in 1869 and 1872 to build a railroad between <a href="Toledo,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Toledo, Ohio</a> and <a href="Ann_Arbor,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, approximately . The <a href="Panic_of_1873" title="wikilink">Panic of 1873</a> killed one of those two companies; it took another 20 years and 12 companies, most of them named Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; something, for the railroad to reach the eastern shore of <a href="Lake_Michigan" title="wikilink">Lake Michigan</a> at <a href="Elberta,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Elberta, Michigan</a>. (The Toledo-Elberta line was the railroad's sole route until the 1960s, when it acquired its only branch, a  <a href="New_York_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central Railroad</a> remnant from Pittsfield to <a href="Saline,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Saline, Michigan</a>.) From <a href="Elberta,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Elberta</a>, across a small inlet from Elberta, the Ann Arbor operated <a href="train_ferry" title="wikilink">train ferry</a> lines to <a href="Kewaunee,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Kewaunee</a> and <a href="Manitowoc,_Wisconsin" title="wikilink">Manitowoc, Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="Menominee,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Menominee</a> and <a href="Manistique,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Manistique, Michigan</a>. The AA was incorporated in 1895 as a reorganization of the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Detroit,_Toledo_and_Ironton_Railroad" title="wikilink">Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton Railway</a> (DT&amp;I;) obtained control of the AA in 1905 but sold its interests in 1910. In 1911 the AA purchased all the capital stock of the <a href="Manistique_and_Lake_Superior_Railroad" title="wikilink">Manistique &amp; Lake Superior Railroad</a> (M&amp;LS;), which extended north from the <a href="Manistique,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Manistique, Michigan</a>, to connections with the <a href="Duluth,_South_Shore_and_Atlantic_Railway" title="wikilink">Duluth, South Shore &amp; Atlantic Railway</a> and the <a href="Lake_Superior_and_Ishpeming_Railroad" title="wikilink">Lake Superior &amp; Ishpeming Railroad</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1925 the <a href="Wabash_Railroad" title="wikilink">Wabash Railroad</a>, which was controlled by <a href="Pennsylvania_Railroad" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> (PRR) interests, acquired control of the AA. By 1930 it held more than 97% of AA's stock. AA was in <a class="uri" href="receivership" title="wikilink">receivership</a> from December 4, 1931, to January 1, 1943 but did not reorganize.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Never a major passenger carrier, AA discontinued its last passenger train in 1950 and gave its to full attention to freight service, which was largely made up of through freight using the Lake Michigan ferries to bypass Chicago and take advantage of lower rates. The railroad was completely dieselized by 1951.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1963, the Wabash sold the AA to the DT&amp;I; (which was owned by the Wabash and the PRR). The M&amp;LS; and the connecting  train ferry route were abandoned in 1968. In 1970 the <a href="Interstate_Commerce_Commission" title="wikilink">Interstate Commerce Commission</a> authorized abandonment of the ferry route between <a href="Frankfort,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Frankfort</a> and Menominee () and the facilities at Menominee.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>On October 16, 1973, AA declared bankruptcy. AA ceased operation as a railroad on April 1, 1976; <a class="uri" href="Conrail" title="wikilink">Conrail</a> assumed operations that day. The state of Michigan then purchased the railroad from the DT&amp;I; and arranged for its operation by Michigan Interstate Railway. The remaining train ferry lines from Elberta to Manitowoc () and Kewaunee () ceased operation in April 1982. In 1983 because of disputes over terms and payments, the operation was split among three railroads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michigan Interstate Railway</li>
<li><a href="Great_Lakes_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">Tuscola &amp; Saginaw Bay Railway</a> (T&amp;SB;)</li>
<li><a href="Michigan_Northern_Railway" title="wikilink">Michigan Northern Railway</a> (MN)</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1984 T&amp;SB; took over MN's portion of the AA.</p>

<p>On October 7, 1988 a new <a href="Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1988)" title="wikilink">Ann Arbor Railroad</a> began operating the portion south of Ann Arbor; the <a href="Great_Lakes_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">Great Lakes Central Railroad</a> (the former T&amp;SB;) currently serves the remaining portions of the line. Some sections have been abandoned: from <a href="Yuma,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Yuma</a> to Elberta and Frankfort (approximately ), approximately  in <a href="Shiawassee_County,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Shiawassee County, Michigan</a> (in three discontinuous sections), and the trackage around the now-demolished Cherry Street Station in Toledo.</p>

<p>AA's Lake Michigan train ferry fleet started in November 1892 when the Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; Northern Michigan Railway acquired its first two boats, <em>Ann Arbor 1</em> and <em>Ann Arbor 2</em>. At its height, the AA served four ports on the west of Lake Michigan:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Kewaunee (1892) - <a href="Kewaunee,_Green_Bay_and_Western_Railroad" title="wikilink">Kewaunee, Green Bay &amp; Western Railroad</a></li>
