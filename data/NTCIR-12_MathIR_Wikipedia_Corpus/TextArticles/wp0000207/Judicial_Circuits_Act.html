<h1>Judicial Circuits Act</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Judicial Circuits Act</strong> of 1866 (ch. 210, ) reorganized the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> <a href="United_States_Circuit_Court" title="wikilink">circuit courts</a> and provided for the gradual elimination of several seats on the <a href="Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. It was signed into law on July 23, 1866, by <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">President</a> <a href="Andrew_Johnson" title="wikilink">Andrew Johnson</a>. It denied him the opportunity of appointing any justices to the Supreme Court. It was the first major legislation dealing with the judiciary following the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>.</p>

<p>The Act redrew the boundaries of the judicial circuits and reduced the number of circuits from ten to nine. It also provided for the gradual reduction in the number of seats on the Supreme Court from the ten that had been authorized in 1863 to seven and established in large measure the geographical outlines of the circuits ever since. Although Congress increased the size of the Supreme Court just three years later with the <a href="Circuit_Judges_Act_of_1869" title="wikilink">Circuit Judges Act of 1869</a>, the geographical outline of the circuits has only been altered by the addition of new states to circuits and the division of two large circuits in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>After establishing nine circuits in 1837, Congress in 1842 shifted several southern states in order to accommodate transportation routes used by the justices when traveling on circuit. In 1862 Congress incorporated five additional states into a restructured system of nine circuits, and within another year had abolished the California Circuit, placed California and Oregon in a Tenth Circuit, and reorganized the mid-western states. The 1866 Act ended a period in which the arrangement of the states into circuits was frequently reorganized.</p>

<p>The geographical reorganization of the circuits in 1866 coincided with the broader effort of the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican</a> majority in Congress to reduce what it considered the disproportionate influence the <a href="U.S._Southern_States" title="wikilink">southern states</a> enjoyed before the Civil War. Between 1837 and 1862, five of the nine circuits comprised exclusively slave states. The tradition of appointing a justice from each circuit allowed Southern slaveowners to dominate the Supreme Court. After reducing the number of all-southern circuits in 1862, Congress in 1866 left only two circuits that comprised only former slave states, and only one that comprised only former <a href="Confederate_States_of_America" title="wikilink">Confederate states</a>.</p>

<p>The reduction in the size of the Supreme Court nullified the pending nomination of <a href="Henry_Stanbery" title="wikilink">Henry Stanbery</a> to the tenth seat on the Court and prevented President Andrew Johnson from appointing a justice during the remainder of his term. The legislation owed less to the Republican opposition and to Johnson, who signed the act, than to the efforts of Chief Justice <a href="Salmon_P._Chase" title="wikilink">Salmon P. Chase</a>. The first draft of the bill proposed a return to nine justices, thus preventing tie votes on the Court and providing a justice for each circuit. In private communication with influential members of Congress and fellow justices, Chase urged a further reduction in the number of seats in hopes of winning approval for an increase in the justices' salaries. Congress did not approve an increase in judicial salaries until 1871, after it had returned the size of the Court to nine seats.</p>
