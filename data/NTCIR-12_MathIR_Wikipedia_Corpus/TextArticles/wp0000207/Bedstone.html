<p>Bedstone is home to Bedstone College, an independent boarding and day school founded in 1948, which is run by a non-profit educational trust (Bedstone Educational Trust).

<p>Educating around 220 day and boarding students, the College is not selective and does not require pupils to sit an entrance exam. It offers a broad curriculum from nursery through to A Level. Physical education and extra-curricular activities are an integral part of the school week, which includes Saturday morning lessons and five afternoons set aside for sports and a choice of activities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bedstone House - for junior girls</li>
<li>Wilson House - for senior girls</li>
<li>Rutter House - for junior boys</li>
<li>Pearson House - for senior boys</li>
