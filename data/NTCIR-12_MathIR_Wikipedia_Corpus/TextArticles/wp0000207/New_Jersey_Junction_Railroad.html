<h1>New Jersey Junction Railroad</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>New Jersey Junction Railroad</strong> (NJJ) was part of the <a href="New_York_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central Railroad</a> and ran along the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a> in <a href="Hudson_County,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hudson County, New Jersey</a>, from the <a href="West_Shore_Railroad" title="wikilink">West Shore Railroad</a> (NYCRR) yards at <a href="Weehawken_Terminal" title="wikilink">Weehawken Terminal</a> south to <a href="Jersey_City,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Jersey City</a>. It later owned an extension to the north, separated by the <a href="Weehawken,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Weehawken</a> yard from the original line.</p>

<p>The company was incorporated under the laws of <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a> on February 27, 1886. On July 1, 1886, it was leased for 100 years to the <a href="New_York_Central_and_Hudson_River_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central and Hudson River Railroad</a>. The line opened for freight in May 1887 and passengers in June 1887.</p>

<p>About .24 mile of the <a href="New_York_and_Fort_Lee_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York and Fort Lee Railroad</a> was leased to the New Jersey Junction Railroad on June 30, 1886.</p>

<p>The NJJ owned the entire stock of the <a href="New_Jersey_Shore_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">New Jersey Shore Line Railroad</a>, <a href="Jersey_City_and_Bayonne_Railroad" title="wikilink">Jersey City and Bayonne Railroad</a>, and <a href="State_Line_and_Stony_Point_Railroad" title="wikilink">State Line and Stony Point Railroad</a>; only the former constructed track. On October 24, 1914, the NJJ was reorganized as a merger with the <a href="New_Jersey_Shore_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">New Jersey Shore Line Railroad</a>.</p>

<p>In 1952, the <a href="New_York_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central Railroad</a> officially swallowed up the New Jersey Junction Railroad, which it had controlled since its beginning. The line eventually passed under control of <a class="uri" href="CSX" title="wikilink">CSX</a> and <a href="Norfolk_Southern" title="wikilink">Norfolk Southern</a> as their River Line and Weehawken Branch. The southern section is now being used for <a href="New_Jersey_Transit" title="wikilink">New Jersey Transit</a>'s <a href="Hudson-Bergen_Light_Rail" title="wikilink">Hudson-Bergen Light Rail</a>, from <a href="North_Bergen" title="wikilink">North Bergen</a>, south to <a href="Hoboken,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Hoboken</a>, with freight now running along the former <a href="Northern_Railroad_of_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Northern Railroad of New Jersey</a> on the other side of the <a href="New_Jersey_Palisades" title="wikilink">New Jersey Palisades</a>.</p>
