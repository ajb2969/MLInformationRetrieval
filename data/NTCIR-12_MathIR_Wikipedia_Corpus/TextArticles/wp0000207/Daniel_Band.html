<h1>Daniel Band</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Daniel Band</strong> is a Canadian <a href="Christian_metal" title="wikilink">Christian metal</a> group formed in 1979 in <a class="uri" href="Toronto" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>. They played in the <a href="contemporary_Christian_music" title="wikilink">contemporary Christian music</a> industry with a sound that ranged from hard rock to <a href="heavy_metal_music" title="wikilink">heavy metal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The group originated in 1979 in suburban <a class="uri" href="Toronto" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ontario" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>, and were based out of a Brethren Assembly in <a href="Scarborough,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Scarborough, Ontario</a> called Bendale Bible Chapel which held a weekly coffeehouse, The One Way Inn, in its church basement, that featured various Christian rock groups, that the band members played in.</p>

<p>The band placed as a top three finalist in the 1982 <em>Homegrown concert</em> sponsored by Toronto radio station <a href="CILQ-FM" title="wikilink">Q107</a>, and played at the <a href="El_Mocambo" title="wikilink">El Mocambo</a> with the champion, Oliver Heavyside (listed in <a href="1980s_One-hit_wonders_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">One-Hit Wonders--US</a> and, as the <a href="Partland_Brothers" title="wikilink">Partland Brothers</a>, as <a href="One-hit_wonders_in_Canada" title="wikilink">One-hit wonders in Canada</a>) and runner-up, The <a href="Cameo_Blues_Band" title="wikilink">Cameo Blues Band</a>, both longtime professional bar bands on the Toronto scene.</p>

<p>Their first album, <em>On Rock</em> (1982), offered a <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a> sound that was typical of the era, in the tradition of <a href="April_Wine" title="wikilink">April Wine</a> and <a href="Boston_(band)" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, but with a harder edge. The solid rock guitar and high register vocals reminded fans of the Canadian rock group <a href="Rush_(band)" title="wikilink">Rush</a>. Their sound grew heavier with <em>Straight Ahead</em> (1983), and by the time of their third album <em>Run from the Darkness</em> (1984) they were a heavy metal act with all the trappings. This was their spandex and studded dog collar stage, with a sound that was closer to <a class="uri" href="AC/DC" title="wikilink">AC/DC</a>.</p>

<p>The band has never officially broken up, although a "farewell concert" was held in Toronto in April 1988, and its members have been involved with various projects in Churches, including Bendale, and Schools where the members now live. Tony Rossi released a blues based album on <a href="R.E.X._Records" title="wikilink">R.E.X. Records</a> in 1990. Dan McCabe was involved with a band called Dreamer which released one album in 1991 titled <em>Full Metal Racket</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> released a solo CD and played with his older children in a band called Nine-O-Five.</p>

<p>In 2000, Daniel Band played at the <a href="Cornerstone_Festival" title="wikilink">Cornerstone Festival</a> in Illinois,, where the listed <em>Live at Cornerstone CD</em> was recorded.</p>

<p>In November 2006, Daniel Band was featured as the opening group for <a href="Audio_Adrenaline" title="wikilink">Audio Adrenaline</a>'s farewell tour concert in <a class="uri" href="Toronto" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, along with <a href="Geoff_Moore" title="wikilink">Geoff Moore</a>. Earlier in the year, there were two appearances in <a class="uri" href="Sarnia" title="wikilink">Sarnia</a>, including an August festival that also saw a reunion of a local (<a href="Arkona,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Arkona, Ontario</a>) group named <em>Elim Hall</em>, who were contemporaries of Daniel Band in the mid-1980s, and <a href="Glenn_Kaiser" title="wikilink">Glenn Kaiser Band</a> (featuring two members of Resurrection Band).</p>

<p>In 2007, the band played at a May celebration of the One Way Inn's (now a drop-in) 35th Anniversary and the 50th Anniversary of Bendale Bible Chapel, and <em>Freedom Festival Canada</em> in <a class="uri" href="Oro-Medonte" title="wikilink">Oro-Medonte</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ontario" title="wikilink">Ontario</a> during August. They also played a show in Ajax in February 2009 with Glenn Kaiser opening, and in May 2009, again at Bendale. In July 2010, the band travelled to <a class="uri" href="Chibougamau" title="wikilink">Chibougamau</a>, <a class="uri" href="Quebec" title="wikilink">Quebec</a>.</p>

<p>In October 2011, the band was awarded the <a href="GMA_Canada" title="wikilink">GMA Canada</a> <a href="GMA_Canada_Lifetime_Achievement_Award" title="wikilink">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> recognizing their pioneering influence on Christian rock.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Earlier in the year, they played with <a class="uri" href="X-Sinner" title="wikilink">X-Sinner</a> over a Spring weekend in Southern Ontario (at Toronto's El Mocambo, St. Catharines, Ottawa, and Kitchener).</p>
