<h1>Mexican duck</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Mexican duck</strong> (<em>Anas diazi</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and see below) is a <a href="dabbling_duck" title="wikilink">dabbling duck</a> in the genus <em>Anas</em> which breeds in <a class="uri" href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexico</a> and the southern <a class="uri" href="USA" title="wikilink">USA</a>. Most of the population is resident, but some northern birds <a href="bird_migration" title="wikilink">migrate</a> south to Mexico in winter.</p>

<p>It is a bird of most <a class="uri" href="wetlands" title="wikilink">wetlands</a>, including <a href="pond" title="wikilink">ponds</a> and rivers, and usually feeds by dabbling for plant food or grazing. It nests usually on a river bank, but not always particularly near water.</p>

<p>Both sexes of this 51–56 cm length <a class="uri" href="bird" title="wikilink">bird</a> resemble a female <a class="uri" href="mallard" title="wikilink">mallard</a>, but with a slightly darker body. The Mexican duck is mainly brown, with a blue <a href="speculum_feathers" title="wikilink">speculum</a> edged with white, obvious in flight or at rest. The male has a brighter yellow bill than the female.</p>

<p>The male has a nasal call, whereas the female has the very familiar "quack" commonly associated with ducks.</p>

<p>This species was formerly—and sometimes still is—considered a <a class="uri" href="subspecies" title="wikilink">subspecies</a> of the mallard, as <em>Anas platyrhynchos diazi</em> (AOU 1983). This may not be correct, however, as careful analysis of <a class="uri" href="mtDNA" title="wikilink">mtDNA</a> <a href="control_region" title="wikilink">control region</a> <a href="DNA_sequence" title="wikilink">sequence</a> data—taking into account <a href="Hybrid_(biology)" title="wikilink">hybridization</a> events—indicates it is the southwestern relative of the <a href="American_black_duck" title="wikilink">American black duck</a> and shares a fairly recent common ancestry with this species (McCracken <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p>

<p>Including the Mexican duck in the mallard is a relic from the usual practice of much of the mid-late 20th century, when all <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North American</a> "mallardines" as well as the <a href="Hawaiian_duck" title="wikilink">Hawaiian</a> and <a href="Laysan_duck" title="wikilink">Laysan ducks</a> were included in the mallard proper as subspecies. This was based on the assumption that hybridization, producing <a href="fertility" title="wikilink">fertile</a> offsprings, is an indicator of lack of <a class="uri" href="speciation" title="wikilink">speciation</a>.</p>

<p>Rather, in these birds it indicates a fairly recent <a class="uri" href="allopatric" title="wikilink">allopatric</a> <a href="adaptive_radiation" title="wikilink">radiation</a>, which has not yet established solid barriers against <a href="gene_flow" title="wikilink">gene flow</a> on the molecular level; <a href="mate_choice" title="wikilink">mate choice</a> is conferred by cues of <a class="uri" href="behavior" title="wikilink">behavior</a> and plumage in the mallardine ducks, and this, under natural conditions, has precluded a strong <a href="Selection_(biology)" title="wikilink">selective</a> pressure towards establishment of genetic incompatibility.</p>
<h2 id="conservation-status">Conservation status</h2>

<p>Although a species of least concern, the Mexican duck is undergoing a slow but marked decline due to destruction of <a href="Habitat_(ecology)" title="wikilink">habitat</a> and overhunting. It hybridizes with mallards which are better-adapted to utilizing habitat altered by human activity and thus are spreading throughout this range. Concern has been expressed that this combination of factors may ultimately lead to the disappearance of the Mexican duck as a recognizable <a href="Taxonomy_(biology)" title="wikilink">taxonomic</a> entity (Rhymer &amp; Simberloff 1996, McCracken <em>et al.</em> 2001, Rhymer 2006), but fairly limited measures such as wetland preservation and preferential hunting of drake mallards would prevent this. The Mexican duck was listed as endangered species at the <a href="United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service" title="wikilink">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> in 1967 but was removed in 1978.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
