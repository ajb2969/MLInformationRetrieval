<h1>Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy</strong> (<strong>BHRT</strong>), also known as <strong>bioidentical hormone therapy</strong> or <strong>natural hormone therapy</strong>, is a poorly defined term referring to the use of <a href="hormone" title="wikilink">hormones</a> that are identical, on a <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecular</a> level, with <a href="endogeny" title="wikilink">endogenous</a> hormones in <a href="hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)" title="wikilink">hormone replacement therapy</a>. The term is also associated with pharmacy <a class="uri" href="compounding" title="wikilink">compounding</a>, blood or <a href="saliva_testing" title="wikilink">saliva testing</a>, efforts to reach a targeted level of hormones in the body (as established through blood or saliva testing) and unfounded claims of safety and efficacy. Specific hormones used in BHRT include <a class="uri" href="estrone" title="wikilink">estrone</a>, <a class="uri" href="estradiol" title="wikilink">estradiol</a>, <a class="uri" href="progesterone" title="wikilink">progesterone</a> (which are available both in <a href="approved_drug" title="wikilink">FDA-approved</a> manufactured products and as pharmacy-compounded products), <a class="uri" href="testosterone" title="wikilink">testosterone</a>, <a class="uri" href="dehydroepiandrosterone" title="wikilink">dehydroepiandrosterone</a> (both products have more limited availability and approval in Canada and the United States) and <a class="uri" href="estriol" title="wikilink">estriol</a> (which is available in Europe but is not approved in Canada and the United States).</p>

<p>Custom-compounded BHRT is a practice almost wholly restricted to the United States.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> BHRT is a form of <a href="alternative_medicine" title="wikilink">alternative medicine</a>, and has been promoted as a <a href="panacea_(medicine)" title="wikilink">panacea</a> for many diseases rather than a means of relieving the symptoms of <a class="uri" href="menopause" title="wikilink">menopause</a> and/or reducing the risk of <a class="uri" href="osteoporosis" title="wikilink">osteoporosis</a> (the goals of traditional hormone replacement therapy). There is no evidence to support these claims; the hormones are expected to have the same risks and benefits of comparable approved drugs for which there is an <a href="Evidence-based_medicine" title="wikilink">evidence base</a> and extensive research and regulation. The exception is progesterone, which may have an improved safety profile, though direct comparisons with <a href="progestin" title="wikilink">progestins</a> have not been made. Bioidentical hormones may also present extra risks, due to the process of compounding. In addition, the accuracy and efficacy of saliva testing has not been definitively proven, and the long-term effects of using blood testing to reach target levels of hormones have not been researched.</p>

<p>The International Menopause Society, <a href="American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists" title="wikilink">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, <a href="Society_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynaecologists_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada</a>, <a href="The_Endocrine_Society" title="wikilink">The Endocrine Society</a>, <a href="North_American_Menopause_Society" title="wikilink">the North American Menopause Society (NAMS)</a>, <a href="United_States_Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">United States Food and Drug Administration</a>, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, <a href="American_Medical_Association" title="wikilink">American Medical Association</a>, <a href="American_Cancer_Society" title="wikilink">American Cancer Society</a> and the <a href="Mayo_Clinic" title="wikilink">Mayo Clinic</a> have released statements that there is a lack of evidence that the benefits and risks of bioidentical hormones are different from well-studied nonbioidentical counterparts; until such evidence is produced the risks should be treated as if they were similar; and that compounded hormone products may have additional risks related to compounding. A major safety concern in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is that there is no requirement to include package inserts, despite the potential for serious adverse effects (including life-threatening adverse effects) associated with HRT. This can lead to consumers' being deceived (and harmed), as they are misled into believing that BHRT is safe and has no side effects. Regulatory bodies require pharmacies to include important safety information with conventional hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) via package inserts.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Bioidentical hormones were first used for menopausal symptom relief in the 1930s,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> after Canadian researcher <a href="James_Collip" title="wikilink">James Collip</a> developed a method to extract an orally active estrogen from the urine of pregnant women and marketed it as the active agent in a product called Emmenin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> It was supplanted on the market when its manufacturer, Ayerst (later <a class="uri" href="Wyeth" title="wikilink">Wyeth</a> Pharmaceuticals), began producing the more easily manufactured conjugated <a class="uri" href="equine" title="wikilink">equine</a> estrogens in 1941 under the brand name <a class="uri" href="Premarin" title="wikilink">Premarin</a>; by 1992, Premarin was the most widely prescribed drug in the United States.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In the 1970s, research and reports indicating risks from synthetic conjugated estrogens began to appear. Investigation determined that the addition of a <a class="uri" href="progestogen" title="wikilink">progestogen</a> to estrogen treatment reduced the risks. As early as 1980, the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (now <em><a class="uri" href="BMJ" title="wikilink">BMJ</a></em>) recommended oral bioidentical progesterone as an option when side effects from synthetic progestogens otherwise mandated discontinuing treatment. Starting in 1980, side effects caused by synthetic progestin use prompted more research into bioidentical progesterone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In May 1998 the FDA approved <a class="uri" href="Prometrium" title="wikilink">Prometrium</a>, an oral bioidentical progesterone product produced by <a href="Solvay_(company)" title="wikilink">Solvay Pharmaceutical</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Physicians John R. Lee and <a href="Jonathan_Wright_(physician)" title="wikilink">Jonathan Wright</a> were pioneers in the area of BHRT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Lee authored several popular books on BHRT<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and promoted custom-compounded BHRT, with the goal of achieving what he called a "natural hormone balance". He based this goal on the clinical testing of saliva to establish where "deficiencies" existed, though agencies such as the FDA and the <a href="American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists" title="wikilink">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> state that blood and saliva testing is unreliable and biologically meaningless.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Lee also believed that progesterone acted as a <a href="panacea_(medicine)" title="wikilink">panacea</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and general health tonic for many health conditions; he based his claims on anecdotal data rather than peer-reviewed research,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and there have been no clinical trials demonstrating this to be true.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Wright also authored a popular book on BHRT;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> he promoted a triple-estrogen formula he called "Triest", which combined the three estrogens (of over 25 types) found in human females: <a class="uri" href="estriol" title="wikilink">estriol</a>, <a class="uri" href="estradiol" title="wikilink">estradiol</a> and <a class="uri" href="estrone" title="wikilink">estrone</a>. Previous bioidential formulas had used only estradiol. This triple formula was based on a single unpublished study whose conclusions did not take into account how estrogens are processed and excreted in the body—particularly how the liver processes oral estrogens, converting many of them to estrone. No followup was performed by Wright to replicate these observations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Wright may have been the first proponent of BHRT to use the term "bioidentical"—the word he coined to describe unpatentable, plant-derived molecules he believed were identical to human hormones. However, no <a href="Crystallography" title="wikilink">structural crystallographic</a> evidence has been used to support the idea that these molecules are actually identical to endogenous human hormones. When the <a href="Women's_Health_Initiative" title="wikilink">Women's Health Initiative</a>'s reports on the unappreciated risks of equine estrogens were released, many prescribers of BHRT used Wright's assertions (and his terminology) to proclaim the superiority of bioidentical molecules despite a lack of scientifically supported evidence. Following the publication of a popular book written by actress <a href="Suzanne_Somers" title="wikilink">Suzanne Somers</a> in 2006, the term "bioidentical" gained more prominence in popular consciousness as a "poorly understood new adjective" regarding hormone replacement therapy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>There is no single definition for the term "bioidentical hormone replacement therapy" (BHRT); it is generally used to refer to 17β-estradiol, but other uses include plant-based or compounded estrogen products that blend estradiol with estriol and sometimes with estrone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> A "bioidentical hormone" is defined as a molecule identical to a hormone <a href="endogeny" title="wikilink">produced by the human body</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> (though not all allegedly bioidentical hormones sold by custom-compounding pharmacies are necessarily molecularly identical to endogenous humans<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>). Despite the term "bioidentical" being used in FDA packaging inserts since before 1998,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the FDA considers "BHRT" to be a marketing term and does not recognize its use.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> The meaning of "plant-derived" has also been attached to the term "bioidentical",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> and it may also mean that the hormones are "natural"; throughout the 1990s plant-derived, compounded hormones were referred to as "natural hormone therapy".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However, the term "natural" can be applied to all products where the principal ingredient originates from an animal, plant, or mineral source, and both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones can be produced from the same plant sources.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>"BHRT" is often used to refer to a set of diagnostic, prescribing, preparation and marketing practices including <a class="uri" href="compounding" title="wikilink">compounding</a> (the preparation of custom-mixed hormones by a pharmacist, according to a prescription), saliva testing, and efforts to counter the effects of aging rather than relieving the symptoms of menopause. This compounded BHRT package has been promoted by Suzanne Sommers, Oprah Winfrey and other proponents as safer and more effective than CHRT,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> though there is no evidence to support these claims. Compounded BHRT has been marketed on the internet by pharmacies which make unfounded claims for its safety and its effectiveness for a variety of conditions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>The lack of distinction between FDA-approved bioidentical hormones and compounded bioidentical hormones as part of a package that includes saliva testing and compounding has resulted in considerable confusion regarding exactly what BHRT is.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>There are a variety of FDA-approved products made using bioidentical estrogens and micronized progesterone, used to treat the symptoms of menopause:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>The term "synthetic" is also used incorrectly by lay "experts" in two different ways - to refer to the process used to manufacture all estrogens, including bioidentical estrogens, and to compounds that interact with estrogen receptors similar to estrogen molecules but are not found in nature. Examples of the latter two include <a class="uri" href="diethylstilbestrol" title="wikilink">diethylstilbestrol</a> and <a class="uri" href="ethinylestradiol" title="wikilink">ethinylestradiol</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>

<p>BHRT is used to reduce the symptoms of menopause. It is also promoted by some practitioners for anti-aging purposes and as providing benefits beyond menopausal symptom relief—improving the quality of life, though there is <a href="#Lack_of_evidence_for_claims" title="wikilink">little evidence to support these claims</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="components-and-compounding">Components and compounding</h2>

<p>Typically, compounded preparations of bioidentical hormones include <a class="uri" href="estriol" title="wikilink">estriol</a>, <a class="uri" href="estrone" title="wikilink">estrone</a>, <a class="uri" href="estradiol" title="wikilink">estradiol</a>, <a class="uri" href="testosterone" title="wikilink">testosterone</a>, <a class="uri" href="progesterone" title="wikilink">progesterone</a> and sometimes <a class="uri" href="dehydroepiandrosterone" title="wikilink">dehydroepiandrosterone</a> (DHEA), either individually or in some combination.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> They are promoted as natural, safer and (in some cases) more efficacious than CHT; however, there are no scientific studies to support claims of superiority of BHs over CHRT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Estimates from sales of bulk hormones for compounding suggest that more than one million women may be using compounded BHRT in the U.S.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> Bioidentical hormones are expected to have the same risks as conventional hormones made with the same products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="estrogens">Estrogens</h3>

<p>In premenopausal women the majority of <a class="uri" href="estrogen" title="wikilink">estrogen</a> produced by the body is estradiol (produced primarily in the ovaries), while in postmenopausal women estrone (produced in fat cells) is the type of estrogen present in the greatest amount; however, the body is able to convert one type of estrogen into another to a certain extent. Because of the limited research into potency, delivery methods and conversion of the various estrogens, a valid scientific understanding of compounded estrogen products has not been achieved.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Synthetic estradiol, taken orally, splits when absorbed in the <a href="Human_gastrointestinal_tract" title="wikilink">gastrointestinal tract</a> and delivers bioidentical estradiol to the bloodstream.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>The hormone <a class="uri" href="estriol" title="wikilink">estriol</a>, produced during <a class="uri" href="pregnancy" title="wikilink">pregnancy</a>, is frequently compounded into bioidentical preparations in the United States. While some think it to be a weaker estrogen, with a more limited period of effectiveness than estradiol, it has been demonstrated to be a stronger estrogen in certain ways.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Though initial research in the 1970s suggested possible use, follow-up studies have failed to confirm this potential.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> Estriol is not found in any FDA-approved drug, and its safety and effectiveness as a hormone supplement is unknown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>Estriol was part of the <a href="United_States_Pharmacopeia" title="wikilink">United States Pharmacopeia</a> before FDA approval was needed for its use. Its approval was grandfathered by the FDA until 2008 when the agency banned its use, stating that manufacturers of estriol would have to create a new application and estriol would be treated as a new drug.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> Its use is not approved by <a href="Health_Canada" title="wikilink">Health Canada</a>; estriol is not available as a pharmaceutical preparation in Canada or the United States, but is a commonly prescribed conventional treatment in other countries and is available as a cream or vaginal suppository in the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> Estradiol is available as brand-name products in both oral and transdermal forms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="progesterone">Progesterone</h3>

<p><a class="uri" href="Progesterone" title="wikilink">Progesterone</a> is used both orally and transdermally. Oral progesterone is micronized (ground) to increase availability, and is approved by the FDA to treat endometrial hyperplasia when used in opposition to estrogen. It has also been approved to relieve menopausal symptoms, either alone or in combination with estrogen. It is more reliable in treating menopausal sleep disorders than synthetic progestins. Transdermal progesterone is often used as a component of compounded BHRT but has not been clinically proven to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, as oral progesterone has.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The <a href="Editor_in_chief" title="wikilink">editors-in-chief</a> of the <a href="scientific_journal" title="wikilink">scientific journal</a> <em><a href="Climacteric_(journal)" title="wikilink">Climacteric</a></em> state that the greatest difference in function between bioidentical and synthetic hormones may be found in progesterone's behavior compared with <a class="uri" href="progestin" title="wikilink">progestin</a>. Laboratory studies have suggested that bioidentical progesterone binds primarily to progesterone <a href="receptor_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">receptors</a>, while synthetic <a href="progestin" title="wikilink">progestins</a> activate other receptors with a variety of effects. The editors suggested that progesterone may have neutral-to-positive effects on the cardiovascular system, and induce <a class="uri" href="apoptosis" title="wikilink">apoptosis</a> in breast epithelial cells. They also called for more research to examine and confirm the effects of progesterone on health, and for continued use of regulated (rather than unregulated) individually compounded products provided by pharmacies. These compounds have not been directly compared with each other in appropriate scientific tests, though as of 2010 trials had begun.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Progesterone is approved for use by both the FDA and Health Canada as a brand-name oral preparation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> The <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> <a href="epidemiology" title="wikilink">epidemiological</a> study <em>Etude Epidemiologique aupres de femmes de l’Education Nationale</em> suggested micronized progesterone may offer a reduced risk of breast cancer compared to other progestins, though large-scale clinical trials have not yet been conducted.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> A 2012 practice advisory published by the journal <em><a href="Canadian_Family_Physician" title="wikilink">Canadian Family Physician</a></em> concluded "...there is no convincing evidence that bioidentical hormones are safer or more effective than synthetic HRT."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="administration">Administration</h2>

<p>Hormones can be administered in a variety of ways, including percutaneous skin and vaginal creams, oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Though all preparations of a given type of estrogen (e.g. estradiol) may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the <a class="uri" href="liver" title="wikilink">liver</a> before entering the <a href="blood" title="wikilink">bloodstream</a> and in this process, most is converted to estrone. However, estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver and entering through the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and gels applied to the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> Pharmaceutical compounding is frequently used to modify the dose, form, and additives of the preparations, based on instructions from a health-care practitioner.</p>
<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<p>The primary difference between the popular promotions of CHRT and compounded BHRT involves BHRT advocates' use of regular testing of blood or saliva-bound hormone levels, use of individualized compounding rather than standard doses, dosing to attain certain levels in the body rather than for symptom relief, and the use of hormones for purposes other than relief of menopausal symptoms. Proponents of compounded BHRT have been criticized by many mainstream medical sources for making unsubstantiated claims about its effectiveness for a variety of purposes, and for promoting it as more safe and "natural" than CHRT.</p>

<p>Advocates for BHRT have claimed that commonly compounded BHRT preparations are not commercially available; this is false, as there are many FDA-approved hormone preparations containing bioidentical molecules available both as proprietary or generic brands. The exception is estriol, used in the compounded bioidentical preparations Triest and Biest—in 2008, the FDA banned estriol until a <a href="New_Drug_Application" title="wikilink">New Drug Application</a> had been completed; these preparations are not approved by either the FDA, or <a href="Health_Canada" title="wikilink">Health Canada</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Some advocates of compounding have also falsely claimed that customized compounding provides customized results; this is incorrect since it is aimed at producing a single hormone profile with absolute blood or saliva levels—which has not been demonstrated to be better than CHRT—and does not consider the rate at which individuals will differ in the activity, metabolism and excretion of the hormones. There have been no <a href="clinical_trial" title="wikilink">clinical trials</a> directly comparing the effectiveness or efficacy of bioidentical versus nonbioidentical compounds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>A 2010 article published in <em><a href="The_Medical_Letter_on_Drugs_and_Therapeutics" title="wikilink">The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics</a></em> concluded "There is no acceptable evidence that 'bioidentical' hormones are safe or effective.

<h3 id="salivary-testing-and-compounding">Salivary testing and compounding</h3>

<p>BHRT is frequently associated with testing of saliva to establish a baseline hormone level and <a class="uri" href="compounding" title="wikilink">compounding</a> of the substances by pharmacists (according to a doctor's advice) to produce preparations (and blood levels) of hormones that are individualized to the patients. There is no research demonstrating any benefit to either of these practices.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Though promoters of BHRT claim that saliva testing can be used to "customize" the level of hormones for individuals, and tests are used to determine which hormones are supposed to be deficient and require supplementation, there is no scientific basis to support the use of saliva testing. Estrogens are secreted in pulses within and over days, resulting in varying saliva levels.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Certain compounding formulations also attempt to use a single profile for all women, with no evidence that a specific profile is beneficial in all cases and no recognition that women differ in their sensitivity to hormones and metabolic rate. Testing-based customizing also does not account for much of the effects, and synthesis of hormones occurs within <a href="tissue_(biology)" title="wikilink">tissues</a> rather than in the blood; therefore, blood or saliva levels of hormones may not necessarily reflect actual biological activity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Other concerns include lack of evidence that samples are stable during storage and transportation, poor replication of results and considerable variation among <a href="assay" title="wikilink">assays</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a> There are also no studies that link symptoms with blood or saliva levels of hormones.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a> The FDA recommends, instead, adjusting hormone therapy to the symptoms of the patient,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and there is no reason to adjust the dosing or monitor patients receiving BHRT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> Skeptics of BHRT have also pointed out that there is no certainty regarding hormone levels in the body.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> The <a href="North_American_Menopause_Society" title="wikilink">North American Menopause Society</a> has supported warnings about the potential harm BHRT could cause, as it unnecessarily compounds drugs that are already FDA-approved in ways that lack an evidence base of safety or harm;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> this warning is supported by the <a href="Society_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynaecologists_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

Rosenthal has also described problematic issues with BHRT including patients receiving information from popular books while lacking the scientific literacy to separate rhetoric from evidence about hormone replacement, illegitimate claims of a "big pharam" conspiracy to suppress bioidentical prescribing, the extra and unnecessary cost of the products that are often not covered by insurance plans, and the inaccurate depiction of bioidentical prescribing as "cutting edge science" rather than unproven alternative medicine.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn148" id="fnref148"><sup>148</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="natural-claims">"Natural" claims</h3>

<p>Bioidentical hormones are frequently marketed as being "natural", or more natural than conventional HRT. The term "natural" can be used to suggest or emphasize a variety of different ideas—similarity with endogenous hormones, extraction from a plant-based source, and that the hormones are not manufactured or synthesized.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn149" id="fnref149"><sup>149</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="Endogeny" title="wikilink">Endogeny</a> - this meaning of "natural" implies that the hormones are molecularly identical to those found within the body. However, BHRT (like all types of HRT used in naturally menopausal women) is unnatural in that it opposes the biologically determined declining levels of fertility hormones in aging women and medicalizes a stage of human life that is probably normal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn150" id="fnref150"><sup>150</sup></a> In addition, most of the conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) extracted from pregnant horse urine (such as <a class="uri" href="Premarin" title="wikilink">Premarin</a>) are converted to human estrogens once they enter the body. However, not all are converted, and BHRT advocates allege that the small amount that is not converted may have some harmful effects. This is still being studied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn151" id="fnref151"><sup>151</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Plant-derived - Women who purchase compounded BHRT are more likely to associate the term "natural" with the idea that the hormones are derived from plant sources.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn152" id="fnref152"><sup>152</sup></a> However, both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones are sourced from the same plants, generally <a href="soy_bean" title="wikilink">soy beans</a> or <a href="Yam_(vegetable)" title="wikilink">yams</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn153" id="fnref153"><sup>153</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing - both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones are synthesized using the same chemical precursors; <a class="uri" href="diosgenin" title="wikilink">diosgenin</a> is extracted from soy or yam plants, converted into <a class="uri" href="progesterone" title="wikilink">progesterone</a> and used as a hormone <a href="precursor_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">chemical precursor</a> to create the final product.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn154" id="fnref154"><sup>154</sup></a> "Natural" is also used to promote the idea of being unmodified, and containing the "goodness" of a pure substance. However, this argument simultaneously draws upon a scientific discourse and methodology; even hormones called "bioidentical" have been heavily processed and converted in a pharmaceutical lab.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn155" id="fnref155"><sup>155</sup></a> Premarin (conjugated estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant horses) contains the only truly "natural" hormones—natural in the sense of being completely unmodified beyond blending the estrogens to achieve a specific ratio.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn156" id="fnref156"><sup>156</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The monthly newsletter <em>Harvard Women's Health Watch</em>, published by <a href="Harvard_Medical_School" title="wikilink">Harvard Medical School</a>, states that "natural" does not automatically mean "safe", and that "natural" can be used to indicate any product with an animal, plant, or mineral source—including hormones that are not bioidentical (such as <a class="uri" href="Premarin" title="wikilink">Premarin</a>), as well as the molecules extracted from soybean and yam sources used in many bioidentical and nonbioidentical commercial preparations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn157" id="fnref157"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>Compounded BHRT is more expensive than conventional, FDA-approved HRT, and is often not covered by health insurance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn158" id="fnref158"><sup>158</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn159" id="fnref159"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

<p>Bioidentical hormones are expected to carry the same risks and benefits as their non-bioidentical counterparts, but there have been no studies that directly compare compounded bioidentical hormones with their non-bioidentical counterparts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn160" id="fnref160"><sup>160</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn161" id="fnref161"><sup>161</sup></a> Hormones—as used in CHRT—have been studied for years and their risk, benefit, and effectiveness profiles are known and demonstrated through considerable research.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn162" id="fnref162"><sup>162</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2002, the <a href="Women's_Health_Initiative" title="wikilink">Women's Health Initiative</a> study (WHI), which was designed to demonstrate additional benefits for conventional hormone therapy (study participants were given Prempro or a placebo), was terminated prematurely after preliminary data indicated small increases in the risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke in older women using Prempro.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn163" id="fnref163"><sup>163</sup></a> The early termination of the WHI study (which used conjugated equine estrogens) and the subsequent publicity about these previously unappreciated risks led to a decline in prescriptions for CHRT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn164" id="fnref164"><sup>164</sup></a> The results of the WHI were used by BHRT prescribers to promote bioidentical hormones as safer than the FDA-regulated preparations despite a lack of evidence;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn165" id="fnref165"><sup>165</sup></a> according to the FDA, the results found by the study apply to all estrogens.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn166" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a> BHRT has since been strongly promoted as a natural alternative with fewer risks than CHRT, though there is no evidence to support this claim. BHRT practitioners recommend compounded products due to their claim that they more closely mimic the composition and ratio of circulating hormones in a woman's body than do commercially manufactured products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn167" id="fnref167"><sup>167</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="The_Endocrine_Society" title="wikilink">The Endocrine Society</a> issued a position statement that bioidentical hormones carry essentially the same risks and benefits as non-bioidentical molecules.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn168" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a> In February 2009 the <a href="American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists" title="wikilink">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> re-iterated its position (of November 2005) that there are no proven benefits in regard to the safety or efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormones, nor are there any benefits in salivary testing of hormone levels or customized dosing of hormones.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a> The <a href="Mayo_Clinic" title="wikilink">Mayo Clinic</a> states that there is no evidence that pharmacy-compounded BHRT is safer or more effective than conventional hormone replacement, and that some bioidentical hormones are already available in certain FDA-approved products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> The <a href="American_Cancer_Society" title="wikilink">American Cancer Society</a> also stated that "natural" and "bioidentical" hormones present the same risks as synthetic hormone replacement therapy such as heart disease, blood clots, strokes and an increased risk of breast cancer with long-term use.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)" title="wikilink">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> has warned several pharmacies about making unsubstantiated claims about the safety and effectiveness of compounded hormone products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a> The <a href="North_American_Menopause_Society" title="wikilink">North American Menopause Society</a> has stated that compounded bioidentical hormones have not been approved by the FDA; there is no guarantee of purity, potency, efficacy or safety, and they may contain unknown contaminants.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a> The Australian Menopause Society has similarly stated that there is no evidence that bioidentical hormones administered using <a href="Throat_lozenge" title="wikilink">lozenges</a> are any safer than their approved counterparts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> The International Menopause Society has stated "There are no medical or scientific reasons to recommend unregistered 'bioidentical hormones'.

These ‘customized’ hormonal preparations have not been tested in studies and their purity and risks are unknown."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a></p>

<p>In November 2006, the <a href="American_Medical_Association" title="wikilink">American Medical Association</a> adopted a policy requesting that the FDA better monitor and regulate bioidentical hormones,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> releasing an editorial stating that compounded bioidentical molecules were expected to have the same risks as conventional hormones until proven otherwise.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn178" id="fnref178"><sup>178</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Erika_Schwartz" title="wikilink">Erika Schwartz</a> and <a href="Kent_Holtorf" title="wikilink">Kent Holtorf</a> published papers stating that there is evidence to support a superior safety profile for bioidentical hormones when compared with non-bioidentical hormones, as well as improved relief of postmenopausal symptoms and better bone density and serum <a class="uri" href="lipoprotein" title="wikilink">lipoprotein</a> levels.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn179" id="fnref179"><sup>179</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a> <a href="Deborah_Moskowitz" title="wikilink">Deborah Moskowitz</a> also published an article stating that bioidentical hormones are superior to non-bioidentical hormones in safety and effectiveness,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> though this review was criticized for "[attempting] to demonstrate that BHRT has a good safety profile, but the data presented only serve to demonstrate similar risks to conventional HRT."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a></p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Quackwatch" title="wikilink">Quackwatch</a> recommends against the use of bioidentical hormones due to lack of quality control over compounding, posing the same risks as conventional hormones, the use of unnecessary saliva testing, and for including the non-FDA-approved hormone <a class="uri" href="estriol" title="wikilink">estriol</a>. <a href="Stephen_Barrett" title="wikilink">Stephen Barrett</a>, the site's owner, concludes his review with the statement "The bottom line for consumers is very simple: Steer clear of anyone who prescribes "bioidentical" hormones or recommends saliva testing as the basis for evaluating hormone status."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="regulatory-status-in-the-united-states">Regulatory status in the United States</h2>

<p>Compounded BHRT is used almost exclusively in the United States,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a> and many FDA-approved formulations that are wholly or partially made of bioidentical hormones are available.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a> Topical hormone preparations such as progesterone, estrogen and DHEA creams can be purchased in stores or over the internet and are not regulated by the FDA, as they are generally considered cosmetic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a></p>

<p>When prescribed by a licensed practitioner, the compounding of bioidentical hormones is controlled by the state pharmacy boards rather than the FDA,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> and <a href="pharmacist" title="wikilink">pharmacists</a> are permitted to adjust dose and delivery method according to the prescription.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> However, the FDA does have authority over the compounded product.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a> In 2001 the FDA surveyed a limited number of compounded preparations, including eight hormone compounds. All three estradiol products passed every test; however, two out of five progesterone products failed at least one test of potency, content or uniformity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn190" id="fnref190"><sup>190</sup></a></p>

<p>In October 2005 <a class="uri" href="Wyeth" title="wikilink">Wyeth</a> Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of both FDA-approved bioidentical and nonbioidentical HRT preparations, filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA asking for enforcement action against compounding pharmacies which dispensed BHRT, and to investigate labeling and advertising guidelines. Soon after, the FDA took a number of enforcement actions against several (primarily Internet-based) pharmacies that were producing compounded BHRT and in 2008, banned the use of estriol in the US.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn191" id="fnref191"><sup>191</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a> The FDA stated that they did not take these regulatory actions against compounded bioidentical hormones in response to Wyeth's request, since that is not the purpose of a citizen petition. They said that they had an ongoing investigation when they received the petition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn193" id="fnref193"><sup>193</sup></a> The FDA has acknowledged that they are unaware of any adverse events connected to the use of estriol, but ordered pharmacies to discontinue its use.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn194" id="fnref194"><sup>194</sup></a> The agency's Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance stated that use of estriol would require a permit for research and a new drug application. The FDA also stated that it has not approved any drug containing estriol and that no information had been submitted to the FDA regarding its safety and effectiveness.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn195" id="fnref195"><sup>195</sup></a> The FDA's concerns over the marketing and use of bioidentical hormones were supported by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn196" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> In response to the FDA's actions, the <a href="International_Academy_of_Compounding_Pharmacists" title="wikilink">International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists</a> began a letter-writing campaign to the FDA to reverse this action, citing Wyeth's attempt as a "self-serving, and at times duplicitous, campaign to restrict patients’ access to alternatives to its own products".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn197" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a></p>

<p>In November 2006, the <a href="American_Medical_Association" title="wikilink">American Medical Association</a> adopted a policy urging the Food and Drug Administration to survey compounded BHRT products for purity and dosage; to maintain a registry and require mandatory adverse event reporting by manufacturers and compounding pharmacies related to bioidentical hormones; to mandate the inclusion of uniform patient information, including warnings and precautions regarding bioidentical products; and to prohibit use of the term "bioidentical hormones" unless the agency has approved the preparation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn198" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a></p>

<p>On July 18, 2008, a US Appeals Court issued a ruling stating that new drug approval processes should not be applied to compounded drugs that complied with established guidelines, and also that provisions of the regulations relevant to the use of estriol were still in effect, preventing the FDA from taking action against pharmacies using estriol in compounded products.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn199" id="fnref199"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
