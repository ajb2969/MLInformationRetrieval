<p>The <strong>Stinson 108</strong> was a popular <a href="general_aviation" title="wikilink">general aviation</a> <a class="uri" href="aircraft" title="wikilink">aircraft</a> produced by the <a href="Stinson_Aircraft_Company" title="wikilink">Stinson</a> division of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> airplane company <a href="Consolidated_Vultee" title="wikilink">Consolidated Vultee</a>, from immediately after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> to <a href="1950_in_aviation" title="wikilink">1950</a>. It was developed from the prewar <a href="Stinson_Voyager" title="wikilink">Model 10A Voyager</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Stinson was bought by <a href="Piper_Aircraft" title="wikilink">Piper Aircraft</a> in 1949. All Stinson model 108, 108-1, 108-2, 108-3 and 108-4 aircraft were built by Stinson at Wayne, Michigan. When Stinson sold the type certificate to Piper in 1949, approximately 325 airplanes of the 5,260 model 108s built by Stinson were complete but unsold. These 325 model 108s went to Piper as part of the sale. Piper then sold that inventory as the Piper-Stinson over the next few years.</p>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="fuselage" title="wikilink">fuselage</a> was of fabric-covered steel tube. Aftermarket modifiers have obtained <a href="Type_certificate" title="wikilink">supplemental type certificates</a> (STC) allowing conversion to an aluminum covering. Many different engines have been installed in the 108 by STC such as the <a href="Lycoming_O-360" title="wikilink">Lycoming O-360</a>, <a href="Franklin_Engine_Company" title="wikilink">Franklin</a> 220|220, <a href="Continental_O-470" title="wikilink">Continental O-470</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>One distinctive feature was the <a href="Leading_edge_slot" title="wikilink">partial leading edge slot</a> installed on the wings and aligned with the <a class="uri" href="ailerons" title="wikilink">ailerons</a> on the trailing edge, ensuring that the portion of the wing containing the aileron remains unstalled at higher <a href="Angle_of_attack" title="wikilink">angles of attack</a>, thus contributing to docile <a href="Stall_(flight)" title="wikilink">stall</a> behavior.</p>

<p>Total new production of the Stinson Model 108, by Stinson, was 5,260, total does not include the 2 converted prototypes. Stinson delivered approximately 4,935 aircraft and Piper delivered approximately 325 aircraft.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Piper later sold the type certificate to <a href="Univair_Aircraft_Corporation" title="wikilink">Univair Aircraft Corporation</a>. Univair built and certified the model 108-5, 1 built. Total new model production by Stinson and Univair is 5,261 aircraft.</p>
<h2 id="variants">Variants</h2>

<p>   The 108 variants closely resemble each other but can be visually distinguished by their design changes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Prototype 108</dt>
<dd>Two prototype model 108s were converted from Stinson model 10A airframes. FAA records show NX31519 was model 108 serial number 1, and NX31532 is model 108 serial number 2. Both registrations later changed to NC. The production model straight 108 would also use serial number 1 and 2, so there was for a short period 2 duplicate serial numbers;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</dd>
<dt>108</dt>
<dd>The 108 does not have a right-side cargo door on the fuselage, 741 built;
</dd>
<dt>108-1</dt>
<dd>The 108-1 up to s/n 108-1469 does not have a right side baggage door, s/n 108-1470 and above has a right-side baggage door on the fuselage, 1507 built;
</dd>
<dt>108-2</dt>
<dd>The 108-2 was essentially the same as 108-1, with exception of  replacing the  engine &amp; inflight adjustable rudder trim, 1252 built. There was a conversion kit to add the rudder trim to the earlier airplanes advertised.

<dl>
<dt>108-3</dt>
<dd>The 108-3 introduced a taller <a href="Vertical_stabilizer" title="wikilink">vertical fin</a> with a <a class="uri" href="rudder" title="wikilink">rudder</a> featuring a straight trailing edge. Larger fuel tanks ( versus ) were also incorporated into the wings. The -3 has a higher gross weight than its predecessors of , allowing full fuel, four  occupants, and  baggage allowance, 1759 built.
</dd>
<dt>108-4</dt>
<dd>The 108-4 was a higher powered model 108, sn 108-4693, NX149C, not certified, flown experimentally by Stinson, later by Piper, 1 built.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
</dd>
<dt>Flying Station Wagon</dt>
<dd>The "Flying Station Wagon" version was an option available with the -1, -2 and -3 models, had a utility interior <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> incorporated wood paneling and a reinforced floor, allowing  of baggage in the passenger compartment. The aircraft could be fitted with wheel, float or ski landing gear. The single 108-4 built was a Flying Station Wagon.
</dd>
<dt>108-5</dt>
<dd>The 108-5 was built by Univair, similar to the 108-3 with a  Franklin engine. Univair purchased the Stinson 108 type certificate from Piper, 1 built in about 1975. This airplane brings total model 108 production to 5,261, of which 5,260 were built by Stinson, 1 by Univair.
