<h1>Henry Hudson Parkway</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Henry Hudson Parkway</strong> is an  <a class="uri" href="parkway" title="wikilink">parkway</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. The southern terminus is at <a href="72nd_Street_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">West 72nd Street</a> in <a class="uri" href="Manhattan" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, where the parkway continues south as the <a href="West_Side_Highway" title="wikilink">West Side Highway</a>. It is often erroneously referred to as the West Side Highway throughout its entire course in Manhattan. The northern terminus is at the <a class="uri" href="Bronx" title="wikilink">Bronx</a>–<a href="Westchester_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Westchester</a> county boundary, where it continues north as the <a href="Saw_Mill_River_Parkway" title="wikilink">Saw Mill River Parkway</a>. All of the parkway is designated <strong>New York State Route 907V</strong> (<strong>NY 907V</strong>), an unsigned <a href="reference_route_(New_York)" title="wikilink">reference route</a>; however, all but the northernmost mile of the road is also designated as part of the signed <a href="New_York_State_Route_9A" title="wikilink">NY 9A</a>.</p>

<p>The owners of the parkway are the <a href="New_York_State_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">New York State Department of Transportation</a>, <a href="New_York_City_Department_of_Transportation" title="wikilink">New York City Department of Transportation</a>, <a href="New_York_City_Department_of_Parks_and_Recreation" title="wikilink">New York City Department of Parks and Recreation</a>, <a href="Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a>, <a class="uri" href="Amtrak" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a>, and <a href="Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. The Henry Hudson Parkway was created by the Henry Hudson Parkway Authority, which was run by "master builder" <a href="Robert_Moses" title="wikilink">Robert Moses</a>. The highway itself was constructed from 1934–1937.</p>
<h2 id="route-description">Route description</h2>

<p>  The Henry Hudson Parkway begins at an interchange with West 72nd Street in <a href="Riverside_Park_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Riverside Park</a>, which also serves as the north end of the <a href="West_Side_Highway" title="wikilink">West Side Highway</a> and the last remaining section of the West Side Highway's predecessor, the <a href="West_Side_Elevated_Highway" title="wikilink">Miller Highway</a>. The junction is numbered as exit 9, continuing the numbering scheme used on the West Side Highway. It heads northward along the west side of <a class="uri" href="Manhattan" title="wikilink">Manhattan</a>, connecting to West 79th Street with a large interchange and to other surface streets with more intermittent exits along the way. The parkway continues in a northerly direction, running almost parallel to Riverside Drive north of West 158th Street. It passes under <a href="Interstate_95_in_New_York" title="wikilink">Interstate 95</a> (I-95) and the <a href="George_Washington_Bridge" title="wikilink">George Washington Bridge</a> as it continues its progression through <a href="Fort_Washington_(New_York)" title="wikilink">Fort Washington Park</a>, <a href="Fort_Tryon_Park" title="wikilink">Fort Tryon Park</a>, and <a href="Inwood_Hill_Park" title="wikilink">Inwood Hill Park</a>. It then runs northward across the <a href="Henry_Hudson_Bridge" title="wikilink">Henry Hudson Bridge</a> into the <a class="uri" href="Bronx" title="wikilink">Bronx</a>.</p>

<p>Upon entering the Bronx, the parkway passes through <a href="Spuyten_Duyvil,_Bronx" title="wikilink">Spuyten Duyvil</a> and <a href="Riverdale,_Bronx" title="wikilink">Riverdale</a> as it continues northward, edging slightly to the northeast. At exit 23, NY 9A leaves the parkway for <a href="U.S._Route_9_in_New_York" title="wikilink">U.S. Route 9</a> (US 9) while the parkway enters <a href="Van_Cortlandt_Park" title="wikilink">Van Cortlandt Park</a>. Soon after it enters the park, the parkway has an interchange with the <a href="Mosholu_Parkway" title="wikilink">Mosholu Parkway</a>, which connects it to <a href="Interstate_87" title="wikilink">I-87</a>. Less than a mile further, the parkway becomes the <a href="Saw_Mill_River_Parkway" title="wikilink">Saw Mill River Parkway</a> as it enters Westchester County.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> The Parkway was completed on October 12, 1937, under New York master builder <a href="Robert_Moses" title="wikilink">Robert Moses</a>. It cost $109 million, twice as expensive as the $49 million <a href="Hoover_Dam" title="wikilink">Hoover Dam</a> that was built in the same period. The Parkway was part of Moses's "West Side Improvement" and included covering the <a href="New_York_Central_Railroad" title="wikilink">New York Central Railroad</a>'s <a href="West_Side_Line_(NYCRR)" title="wikilink">West Side Line</a>, creating the <a href="Freedom_Tunnel" title="wikilink">Freedom Tunnel</a>. The covered portion is partially used for the highway and also expands the <a href="Riverside_Park_(Manhattan)" title="wikilink">Riverside Park</a> designed by <a href="Frederick_Law_Olmsted" title="wikilink">Frederick Law Olmsted</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>  On May 12, 2005, part of a retaining wall at <a href="Castle_Village" title="wikilink">Castle Village</a> collapsed onto the northbound lanes of the parkway, just north of the <a href="George_Washington_Bridge" title="wikilink">George Washington Bridge</a>, shutting it down shortly before rush hour. The clean-up began quickly, and the road re-opened on May 15.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>The Henry Hudson Parkway is a candidate for designation as a New York State <a href="Scenic_route" title="wikilink">Scenic Byway</a>, the first in New York City. At the request of the Henry Hudson Parkway Task Force, in 2005 the <a href="New_York_Metropolitan_Transportation_Council" title="wikilink">New York Metropolitan Transportation Council</a> approved funding to develop a comprehensive corridor management plan, a requirement for its designation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> {{-}}</p>
