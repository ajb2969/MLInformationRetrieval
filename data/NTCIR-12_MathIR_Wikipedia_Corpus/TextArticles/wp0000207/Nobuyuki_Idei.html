<p><strong>Nobuyuki Idei</strong> (出井 伸之, <em>Idei Nobuyuki</em>; born November 22, 1937) was a former <a class="uri" href="Chairman" title="wikilink">Chairman</a> and Group Chief Executive Officer of <a href="Sony_Corporation" title="wikilink">Sony Corporation</a> until the 7th March 2005.

His sweeping reorganizations of the company included trimming the board of directors from 38 members dominated by company management to 10 with a substantial presence of outsiders.

<p>In 2003, on Ohga's retirement, Idei became the sole Chairman, and the title of Chief Executive Officer was altered to Group Chief Executive Officer. On March 7, 2005, it was announced that Idei would be succeeded on June 22 by <a href="Sir_Howard_Stringer" title="wikilink">Sir Howard Stringer</a>.</p>

<p>In 2006, Idei joined the board leading <a class="uri" href="Accenture" title="wikilink">Accenture</a>. On September 28, 2011, Idei joined the Board of Directors of <a class="uri" href="Lenovo" title="wikilink">Lenovo</a>.</p>

<p>On July 15, 2014, Idei joined the Board of Directors of <a href="ZL_Technologies" title="wikilink">ZL Technologies</a>. ZL Technologies' CEO Kon Leong noted that "Mr. Idei joins an advisory board at ZL represented by thought-leaders from diverse backgrounds and industries.

We are excited to welcome Mr. Idei, who ranks among the top strategic advisors in the business world."</p>
