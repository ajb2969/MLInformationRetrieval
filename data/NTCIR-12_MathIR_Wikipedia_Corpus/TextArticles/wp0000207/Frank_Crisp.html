Crisp's mother died when he was three years old and as a result he was brought up by his grandfather, <a href="John_Filby_Childs" title="wikilink">John Filby Childs</a>. He resolved to take up the <a class="uri" href="law" title="wikilink">law</a> and at 16 was articled to a firm of <a href="solicitor" title="wikilink">solicitors</a>. He also studied at the <a href="University_of_London" title="wikilink">University of London</a>, obtaining the degrees of <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">BA</a> in 1864 and <a class="uri" href="LLB" title="wikilink">LLB</a> in 1865. In 1867 he married Catherine Howes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>He qualified as a solicitor in 1869 and his reputation soon grew, acting in many important commercial contracts. He counted several foreign <a class="uri" href="railroad" title="wikilink">railroad</a> companies and the <a href="Imperial_Japanese_Navy" title="wikilink">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> among his clients, and drew up the contract for the cutting of the <a href="Cullinan_diamond" title="wikilink">Cullinan diamond</a>. He received his <a href="baronet" title="wikilink">baronetcy</a> in 1913 for services as legal advisor to the <a href="Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1889, he bought <a href="Friar_Park" title="wikilink">Friar Park</a> in <a class="uri" href="Henley-on-Thames" title="wikilink">Henley-on-Thames</a>, where he entertained the great and the good. He was a keen <a href="horticulture" title="wikilink">horticulturalist</a> and developed spectacular public gardens there, including an <a href="rock_garden" title="wikilink">alpine</a> garden featuring a 20-foot (6-metre) replica of the <a class="uri" href="Matterhorn" title="wikilink">Matterhorn</a>. He published an exhaustive survey of <a href="medieval_gardening" title="wikilink">medieval gardening</a> titled <em>Mediaeval Gardens</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He commissioned <a href="Henry_Ernest_Milner" title="wikilink">Henry Ernest Milner</a> to design the gardens.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Former <a href="The_Beatles" title="wikilink">Beatle</a> <a href="George_Harrison" title="wikilink">George Harrison</a> purchased Friar Park as his new home in January 1970. He wrote a tribute to Crisp called "<a href="Ballad_of_Sir_Frankie_Crisp_(Let_It_Roll)" title="wikilink">Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)</a>", which appeared on the album <em><a href="All_Things_Must_Pass" title="wikilink">All Things Must Pass</a></em> and later provided part of the title for his 2009 career-spanning compilation <em><a href="Let_It_Roll:_Songs_by_George_Harrison" title="wikilink">Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison</a></em>. In addition, Harrison's 1974 hit single "<a href="Ding_Dong,_Ding_Dong" title="wikilink">Ding Dong, Ding Dong</a>" contains the lyrical refrain "<em>Ring out the old, ring in the new / Ring out the false, ring in the true</em>", which was taken from one of a number of inscriptions Crisp had engraved in the house and grounds of the property. (It is actually from <a href="Ring_Out,_Wild_Bells" title="wikilink">Ring Out, Wild Bells</a>, a section of the <a class="uri" href="Tennyson" title="wikilink">Tennyson</a> poem <em>In Memoriam</em>.) The lyrics and title of another Harrison track, "<a href="The_Answer's_at_the_End" title="wikilink">The Answer's at the End</a>", were also inspired by the writings of Frank Crisp: "<em>Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass / Life is one long enigma, my friend / So read on, read on, the answer's at the end.</em>"</p>
