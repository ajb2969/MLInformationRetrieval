<hr/>

<p><strong>CHYK-FM</strong> is a <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> radio station, which broadcasts at <a href="FM_radio" title="wikilink">FM</a> 104.1 in <a class="uri" href="Timmins" title="wikilink">Timmins</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ontario" title="wikilink">Ontario</a>. It broadcasts a <a class="uri" href="francophone" title="wikilink">francophone</a> <a href="hot_adult_contemporary" title="wikilink">hot adult contemporary</a> format for the city's <a class="uri" href="Franco-Ontarian" title="wikilink">Franco-Ontarian</a> community. It is owned by <a href="Le5_Communications" title="wikilink">Le5 Communications</a>, and branded as <strong>Le Loup 104.1</strong>.</p>

<p>CHYK and its <a href="Greater_Sudbury" title="wikilink">Sudbury</a> and <a href="West_Nipissing" title="wikilink">Nipissing</a> sister stations <a href="CHYC-FM" title="wikilink">CHYC</a>, <a href="CHYQ-FM" title="wikilink">CHYQ</a> are the only francophone commercial stations programmed entirely in Ontario. Apart from commercials and separate morning shows, the three stations in fact simulcast the same programming at almost all times, although all three stations produce a portion of the shared broadcast schedule.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The station was originally established on December 23, 1951 by <a href="J._Conrad_Lavigne" title="wikilink">J. Conrad Lavigne</a>, with the callsign <strong>CFCL</strong> at 580 kHz. It operated as a private affiliate of <a href="Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">Radio-Canada</a>'s <a href="Ici_Radio-Canada_Première" title="wikilink">French radio network</a>, and was one of the few private affiliate stations of a CBC radio network anywhere in Canada. CFLH in Hearst began broadcasting the same year. In 1956, Lavigne also established <a class="uri" href="CFCL-TV" title="wikilink">CFCL-TV</a>, a private <a href="CBC_Television" title="wikilink">CBC Television</a> affiliate, in the city.</p>

<p>In 1957, CFLK began broadcasting in <a class="uri" href="Kapuskasing" title="wikilink">Kapuskasing</a>. In 1960, CFCL moved from 580 to 620 <a class="uri" href="kHz" title="wikilink">kHz</a>.</p>

<p>On July 28, 1975, Lavigne was denied an application to change CFCL's frequency from 620 kHz to 850 kHz with an increase in night-time power from 5,000 to 10,000 watts, with daytime power remaining at 10,000 watts. The station would have switched from different day and night patterns to directional at night only, to protect <a href="Clear-channel_station" title="wikilink">Class-A clear-channel</a> station <a href="KOA_(AM)" title="wikilink">KOA</a> in <a class="uri" href="Denver" title="wikilink">Denver</a>. The partner application to use the 620 kHz frequency in Sudbury with 10,000 watts day and 5,000 watts night (single directional pattern) was also denied.</p>

<p>In 1979, Lavigne again attempted to change CFCL's frequency and launch a new station in Sudbury. The application, which was identical to the one filed in 1975, was yet again denied. That year, competing broadcasters CKAP Kapuskasing (which had proposed a rebroadcast station in Timmins on 1450 kHz with 10,000 watts day and 5,000 watts at night) and Lavigne and Cambrian Broadcasting (competing for a license for a new AM station at 730 kHz with 10,000 watts in North Bay) also had their applications denied.</p>

<p>In 1980, Lavigne's broadcast holdings were eventually merged into the <a href="Mid-Canada_Communications" title="wikilink">Mid-Canada Communications</a> system. When that company acquired several other radio stations in 1985, CFCL became a commercial station as part of the <a href="Mid-Canada_Radio" title="wikilink">Mid-Canada Radio</a> network, and disaffiliated from Radio-Canada.</p>

<p>Mid-Canada Radio was sold to the <a href="Pelmorex_Radio_Network" title="wikilink">Pelmorex Radio Network</a> in 1990. Because the radio and television station no longer had common ownership, the radio station's callsign was subsequently changed to <strong>CKOY</strong>. CFLH in Hearst later adopted the call sign CHOH, and was converted to FM in 1995,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> while CFLK in Kapuskasing adopted the call sign CHYK.</p>

<p>Pelmorex, in turn, sold its stations to the <a href="Haliburton_Broadcasting_Group" title="wikilink">Haliburton Broadcasting Group</a> in 1999. CKOY was converted to 104.1 FM, and took over the CHYK callsign from its rebroadcaster in Kapuskasing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Kapuskasing rebroadcaster was in turn converted to FM in 2003 and later adopted its current callsign CHYX-FM.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2008, Haliburton announced a deal to sell the CHYC stations to Le5 Communications, a firm owned by Sudbury lawyer Paul Lefebvre. This deal was approved by the <a href="Canadian_Radio-Television_and_Telecommunications_Commission" title="wikilink">CRTC</a> on October 31, 2008.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Le5 Communications rebranded the station as Le Loup in early 2009.</p>

<p>In 2010, Le5 Communications also launched the weekly community newspaper <em><a href="L'Express_de_Timmins" title="wikilink">L'Express de Timmins</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>On March 2, 2012, Le5 Communications received approval from the CRTC to change the authorized contours of the station's rebroadcaster in Hearst, by changing the antenna radiation pattern from directional to non-directional, increasing the average <a href="effective_radiated_power" title="wikilink">effective radiated power</a> (ERP) from 140 to 172 watts (maximum ERP from 140 to 221 watts), decreasing the effective height of antenna above average terrain from 56.6 to 43 metres and relocating the antenna site.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>A historical plaque in the city's Mattagami Park commemorates the station's historic role in the local Franco-Ontarian community.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
