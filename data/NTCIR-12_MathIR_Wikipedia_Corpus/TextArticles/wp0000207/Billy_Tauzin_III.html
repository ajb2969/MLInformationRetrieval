<h1>Billy Tauzin III</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Wilbert Joseph "Billy" Tauzin III</strong> was born December 1, 1973 in <a href="Thibodaux,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Thibodaux, Louisiana</a>, the son of Congressman <a href="Billy_Tauzin" title="wikilink">Billy Tauzin</a> and Gayle Clement Tauzin. After graduating from Bishop O'Connell High School in Arlington, VA, as a National Honor Society Student and 3 sport lettermen (football, wrestling and lacrosse), Tauzin accepted an appointment to the <a href="United_States_Coast_Guard_Academy" title="wikilink">United States Coast Guard Academy</a> in New London, Connecticut.</p>

<p>After resigning from the Coast Guard Academy his junior year, Tauzin finished his bachelor's degree in marketing at <a href="Louisiana_State_University" title="wikilink">Louisiana State University</a> in 1996. He worked for Bell Atlantic Wireless in Virginia and later BellSouth in Metairie, Louisiana.</p>

<p>In a decision that provoked internal dissension in the Louisiana Republican Party, the 30-year-old Tauzin was endorsed by the <a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Republican Party</a> executive committee as its candidate to fill the open seat caused by his father's 2004 retirement from the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a> due to his battle with intestinal cancer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Tauzin bested a crowded field in the primary and faced Democratic challenger <a href="Charlie_Melancon" title="wikilink">Charlie Melancon</a>, a long-time lobbyist for the sugar cane industry, in the runoff. The hotly contested race ended with both candidates receiving 50% but Melancon edging Tauzin by over 300 votes out of over 100,000 votes cast.</p>

<p>Tauzin finished his Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from Nicholls State University in 2006 and currently works for AT&amp;T; (merged with BellSouth) as a district manager in <a href="San_Antonio,_Texas" title="wikilink">San Antonio, Texas</a>.
