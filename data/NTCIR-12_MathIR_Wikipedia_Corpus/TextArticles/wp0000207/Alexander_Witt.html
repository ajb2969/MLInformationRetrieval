And, we moved to Mexico, from Mexico in '73 I moved to Europe, where I started working in film. I started with <a href="Arri" title="wikilink">Arriflex</a>, the company that makes the cameras. I was there for a year and I did kind of a trainee type of year where I was in the sound department, in the lab, in the studio working with the actual productions and also assembling cameras. And then I moved to Europe, where I lived three years, and then, back in '76, I did my first movie as a camera assistant, which was <em><a href="21_Hours_at_Munich" title="wikilink">21 Hours at Munich</a></em>. And then, I kept on going, I moved up to focus puller or first AC, and then operating and then DP-ing. And then I was DP-ing commercials and then I started directing commercials in the late 80's and beginning of [the] 90's. I was working with <a href="Jan_De_Bont" title="wikilink">Jan De Bont</a> and doing his second unit as a DP while he was a DP He is the one that really gave me the break on <em><a href="Speed_(1994_film)" title="wikilink">Speed</a></em> to start directing second unit."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
