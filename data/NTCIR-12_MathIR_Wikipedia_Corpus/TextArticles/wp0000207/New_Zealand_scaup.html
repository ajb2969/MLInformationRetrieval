<p>Overall dark brown/black colours. The male has a striking yellow eye and a dark coloured (greenish) head.

<h2 id="feeding">Feeding</h2>

<p>The scaup is a diving duck which may submerge for twenty to thirty seconds and go down three metres to look for aquatic plants, small fish, water snails, mussels and insects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is sometimes seen with the Australian coot (<em>Fulica atra</em>); it is thought that the scaup takes advantage of the food stirred up by the coots as they fossick for shrimps.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>

<p>It is found throughout both the North and South Islands of New Zealand in deep freshwater lakes and ponds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Unlike other members of this genus, the scaup is not migratory, although it does move to open water from high country lakes if they become frozen in winter.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="life-cycle">Life cycle</h2>

<p>They nest from October to March. They lay five to eight cream/white eggs in a nest close to water, often under banks or thick cover. The nest is usually lined with grass and down.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The eggs are incubated for four weeks by the female. The newly hatched ducklings begin diving for food on their first outing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
