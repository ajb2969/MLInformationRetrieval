<h1>Clay–water interaction</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Clay-water interaction</strong> is an all-inclusive term to describe various progressive interactions between <a href="clay_mineral" title="wikilink">clay minerals</a> and <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a>. In the dry state, clay packets exist in face-to-face stacks like a deck of playing cards, but clay packets begin to change when exposed to water. Five descriptive terms describe the progressive interactions that can occur in a clay-water system, such as a water mud.</p>

<p>(1) <a href="Mineral_hydration" title="wikilink">Hydration</a> occurs as clay packets absorb water and swell.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="Dispersion_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">Dispersion</a> (or disaggregation) causes clay platelets to break apart and disperse into the water due to loss of attractive forces as water forces the platelets farther apart.</p>

<p>(3) <a class="uri" href="Flocculation" title="wikilink">Flocculation</a> begins when mechanical shearing stops and platelets previously dispersed come together due to the attractive force of surface charges on the platelets.</p>

<p>(4) <a class="uri" href="Deflocculation" title="wikilink">Deflocculation</a>, the opposite effect, occurs by addition of chemical deflocculant to flocculated mud; the positive edge charges are covered and attraction forces are greatly reduced.</p>

<p>(5) <a href="Particle_aggregation" title="wikilink">Aggregation</a>, a result of ionic or thermal conditions, alters the hydrational layer around clay platelets, removes the deflocculant from positive edge charges and allows platelets to assume a face-to-face structure.</p>
