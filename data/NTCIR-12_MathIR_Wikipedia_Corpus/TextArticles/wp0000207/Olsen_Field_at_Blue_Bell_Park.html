<h1>Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Olsen Field</strong> is a <a href="baseball_stadium" title="wikilink">baseball stadium</a> in <a href="College_Station" title="wikilink">College Station</a>, <a class="uri" href="Texas" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, that is home to the <a href="Texas_A&amp;M;_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M;</a> baseball program. The <a class="uri" href="stadium" title="wikilink">stadium</a> was dedicated on March 21, 1978, and is named in honor of <a href='C._E._"Pat"_Olsen' title="wikilink">C. E. "Pat" Olsen</a>, a 1923 graduate of <a href="Texas_A&amp;M;_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M; University</a> and a former <a class="uri" href="baseball" title="wikilink">baseball</a> player in the <a href="New_York_Yankees" title="wikilink">New York Yankees</a> farm system. Olsen Field has served as an <a href="National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="wikilink">NCAA</a> regional site five times and had its 1999 regional attendance ranked second with 53,287. The first NCAA Regional Tournament held at Olsen Field was in 1989.</p>

<p>In 2004 <em><a href="Sports_Illustrated_on_Campus" title="wikilink">Sports Illustrated on Campus</a></em> ranked Olsen Field "the best college baseball venue". Aggie baseball fans called <a href="List_of_Texas_Aggie_terms#R" title="wikilink">RAggies</a> have a reputation of fiercely "ragging" opponents.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Olsen Field underwent a major renovation that began on June 7, 2011, funded in part by donations from the owners of <a href="Blue_Bell_Creameries" title="wikilink">Blue Bell Creameries</a> (who thus gained naming rights). Some new features of the stadium included an expanded concourse and concessions area, luxury suites, a new press box, club seating, two grass berms, expanded locker rooms and coaches offices, a student athletic center, and extended seating closer to the field. However, the seating capacity was decreased from 7,000 to 5,400 to accommodate the changes (although with standing room only will still hold over 7,000). Olsen Field reopened on February 17, 2012 for the first game of the 2012 baseball season even though some projects were not completely finished; the remaining work was completed on non-game days.</p>

<p>In 2013, the Aggies ranked 9th among <a href="List_of_NCAA_Division_I_baseball_programs" title="wikilink">Division I baseball programs</a> in attendance, averaging 4,523 per home game.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
