<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="youth-and-college">Youth and college</h3>

<p>Hernández was a student at <a href="John_Tyler_High_School" title="wikilink">John Tyler High School</a> and played youth soccer for the <a href="Dallas_Texans_Soccer_Club" title="wikilink">Dallas Texans Soccer Club</a>. He played <a href="college_soccer" title="wikilink">college soccer</a> at <a href="Southern_Methodist_University" title="wikilink">Southern Methodist University</a> from 1994 to 1997, where he was a <a href="Division_I_First-Team_All-American_(soccer)" title="wikilink">First Team All-American</a> as an attacking midfielder.</p>
<h3 id="professional">Professional</h3>

<p>Upon graduating from SMU, Hernández was drafted in the second round of the <a href="1998_MLS_College_Draft" title="wikilink">1998 MLS College Draft</a> by the <a href="Los_Angeles_Galaxy" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Galaxy</a> of <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a>. He saw little playing time in the Galaxy, appearing mostly a substitute, before being traded to the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Mutiny" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Mutiny</a> in exchange for <a href="Jorge_Salcedo" title="wikilink">Jorge Salcedo</a>. Hernández hardly played for the Mutiny either, appearing in only four games, and was traded the next year to the <a class="uri" href="MetroStars" title="wikilink">MetroStars</a> for the rights to <a href="Daniel_Alvarez_(soccer)" title="wikilink">Daniel Alvarez</a>.</p>

<p>With the MetroStars, Hernández finally came into his own, earning a starting position, first in central defense, and then becoming one of the league's most dangerous <a href="defensive_midfielder" title="wikilink">defensive midfielders</a>. He stayed with the MetroStars from 2000 to 2002, but was a part of a blockbuster trade in the middle of 2002, which sent him along with <a href="Brian_Kamler" title="wikilink">Brian Kamler</a> and <a href="Diego_Serna" title="wikilink">Diego Serna</a> to the New England Revolution for <a href="Mamadou_Diallo" title="wikilink">Mamadou Diallo</a>, <a href="Andy_Williams_(soccer)" title="wikilink">Andy Williams</a>, and <a href="Ted_Chronopoulos" title="wikilink">Ted Chronopoulos</a>. Despite being a starter for the Revolution, Hernández expressed displeasure with his situation, requesting a trade to his home state <a href="FC_Dallas" title="wikilink">Dallas Burn</a>. The Burn, however, were unwilling to make such a trade, and upon the emergence of an adequate replacement for him in <a href="Shalrie_Joseph" title="wikilink">Shalrie Joseph</a>, Hernández was transferred to <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> club <a class="uri" href="Necaxa" title="wikilink">Necaxa</a> mid-season 2003. In six seasons in MLS, he totalled four goals and 15 assists in league play.</p>

<p>To the surprise of many, Hernández - called <strong>Demetrio</strong> in Mexico - earned a starting position as a central defender on the club. According to Hernández, his profile in his hometown of Tyler has increased enormously since his arrival in the <a href="Primera_División_de_México" title="wikilink">Primera División</a>. However, in 2005, he came back to MLS, re-signing with New England. In 2007, he was waived by the Revolution.</p>

<p>After brief stints back in Mexico with <a href="Puebla_F.C." title="wikilink">Puebla</a> and <a href="Chiapas_F.C." title="wikilink">Chiapas F.C.</a> in 2007 and 2008, Hernández signed with <a href="FC_Dallas" title="wikilink">FC Dallas</a> in September 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> With Dallas, Hernandez has been a key player playing as the teams primary defensive midfielder. Following the 2011 season, Hernández signed an extension with the club that saw him also become an assistant coach as part of a transition out of his playing career.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Hernández announced his retirement from playing professional soccer on November 21, 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="coaching">Coaching</h3>

<p>Upon retiring as a player, it was announced Hernández would have a full-time coaching role, also with FC Dallas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> However, just a few weeks after being hired Hernández was fired from his coaching job with FC Dallas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
