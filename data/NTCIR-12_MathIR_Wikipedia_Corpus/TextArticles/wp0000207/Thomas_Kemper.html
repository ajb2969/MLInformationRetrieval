<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><strong>1990:</strong> The first batch of Thomas Kemper Soda, Thomas Kemper Root Beer, was created for the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest. Since 1989, the Thomas Kemper Brewing Company, one of the Northwest's first Microbreweries, held an annual Oktoberfest celebration at their brewery. Starting out as a small event, the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest soon was adding thousands of extra people to the population of Poulsbo, WA each autumn.</p>

<p><strong>1991:</strong> Having done so well at the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest, the Thomas Kemper Soda Company was formed. With very little advertising or marketing dollars, the young company relies on a "grassroots" campaign to get the word on its sodas out to consumers.</p>

<p><strong>1992:</strong> The Thomas Kemper Brewing Company starts to grow, but is in need of the means to do it. Washington's Hart Brewery buys Thomas Kemper and one of the craft beer industry's first mergers takes place. Since the Soda operation had been separated from the parent firm, as a result of a divorce action between firm owners, it was not part of this deal and the folks at Hart will have to wait a few years to re-unite the sibling breweries.</p>

<p><strong>1996:</strong> Thomas Kemper Sodas made the Guinness Book of World Records for creating the world's largest root beer float. Using a 4,000-ton carbonating tank and 900 gallons of ice cream, Thomas Kemper made a 2,166.5 gallon root beer float.</p>

<p><strong>1997:</strong> Thomas Kemper Sodas are re-united with the Thomas Kemper Beer when Pyramid Breweries Inc. buys Thomas Kemper Sodas. The move provides resources to help the soda company grow.</p>

<p><strong>1997:</strong> To kick-off the summer, Thomas Kemper Sodas introduces its Thomas Kemper Orange Cream Soda.</p>

<p><strong>1998:</strong> Thomas Kemper introduces its next flavor, Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda.</p>

<p><strong>2001:</strong> Thomas Kemper launches two new soda fountain classics, Ginger Ale and Grape.</p>

<p><strong>2007:</strong> Thomas Kemper is sold by Pyramid. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><strong>2011:</strong> Thomas Kemper is sold to <a href="Big_Red_(drink)" title="wikilink">Big Red, Inc.</a></p>
