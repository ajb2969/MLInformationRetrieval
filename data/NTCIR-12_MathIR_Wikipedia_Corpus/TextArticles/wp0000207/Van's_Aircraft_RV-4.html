<h1>Van's Aircraft RV-4</h1>
<hr/>

<p>{| |}</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="Van's_Aircraft" title="wikilink">Van's</a> RV-4</strong> is a light <a href="homebuilt_aircraft" title="wikilink">homebuilt aircraft</a> supplied in kit form. It seats two people in a <a class="uri" href="tandem" title="wikilink">tandem</a> seating configuration with the pilot accommodated in the front seat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Van's RV series has become the most popular kit-built aircraft in the world. The RV-4 is the second most popular RV model, outsold only by the now discontinued <a href="Van's_Aircraft_RV-6" title="wikilink">RV-6</a>.</p>

<p>As of November 2014, 1372 RV-4s had been completed and flown worldwide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p><a href="Richard_VanGrunsven" title="wikilink">Richard VanGrunsven</a> designed the RV-4 in the mid 1970s as a two-seat development of the single-seat <a href="Van's_Aircraft_RV-3" title="wikilink">RV-3</a>. The RV-4 prototype first flew in August <a href="1979_in_aviation" title="wikilink">1979</a>.</p>

<p>The RV-4 is a new design based upon the concepts proven in the RV-3 and is not merely a stretched RV-3. The RV-4 airframe will accept a range of engines up to , including the <a href="Lycoming_O-360" title="wikilink">Lycoming O-360</a>. The RV-4 has a new wing, with increased wingspan and wing area over the RV-3. The RV-4 is designed for sport aerobatics.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The RV-4 has proven to be a capable cross country aircraft in service, able to carry two modest sized people and baggage on longer trips. RV-4s have been flown around the world, notably by an Australian, <a href="Jon_Johanson" title="wikilink">Jon Johanson</a>, who completed world-girdling RV-4 flights on two occasions.</p>

<p>Many larger people find the RV-4 cockpit design physically constraining, and as a result VanGrunsven has designed an entire family of derivative designs. The <a href="Van's_Aircraft_RV-6" title="wikilink">RV-6</a> was designed to allow side-by-side seating, and the <a href="Van's_Aircraft_RV-8" title="wikilink">RV-8</a> was created as an enlarged aircraft that follows the RV-4's philosophy and offers tandem seating in a bigger aircraft.</p>

<p>Unlike most later RV series designs, RV-4 kits are only available with <a href="conventional_landing_gear" title="wikilink">conventional landing gear</a>, although some may have been constructed in <a href="Tricycle_gear" title="wikilink">tricycle configuration</a> by builders. At least two RV-4s have also been built with retractable landing gear (mostly for the engineering challenge, as the performance gains were modest).</p>
