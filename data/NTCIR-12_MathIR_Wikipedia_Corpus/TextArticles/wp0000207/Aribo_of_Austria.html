<h1>Aribo of Austria</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Aribo</strong> (or <strong>Arbo</strong>) (c. 850 – 909) was the margrave (<em>comes terminalis</em>, "frontier count") of the <a href="March_of_Pannonia" title="wikilink">March of Pannonia</a>, from 871 until his death. In his day, the <em>march orientalis</em> corresponded to a front along the <a class="uri" href="Danube" title="wikilink">Danube</a> from the <a href="Traun" title="wikilink">Traungau</a> to the <a class="uri" href="Szombathely" title="wikilink">Szombathely</a> and <a class="uri" href="Rába" title="wikilink">Rába</a> rivers and including the <a class="uri" href="Vienna" title="wikilink">Vienna</a> basin.</p>

<p>Aribo was originally appointed to succeed the brothers <a href="William_(marcha_orientalis)" title="wikilink">William</a> and <a href="Engelschalk_I" title="wikilink">Engelschalk I</a> after they died on campaign against <a class="uri" href="Moravia" title="wikilink">Moravia</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This has been used to support the hypothesis that he was a brother-in-law of the two margraves. Aribo maintained peace with <a href="Svatopluk_of_Moravia" title="wikilink">Svatopluk of Moravia</a> and it paid off when, in 882, the son of the late margrave Engelschalk, <a href="Engelschalk_II" title="wikilink">Engelschalk II</a>, rebelled against him, claiming the rights to the march. The emperor <a href="Charles_the_Fat" title="wikilink">Charles the Fat</a> confirmed Aribo's position and Engelschalk turned to <a href="Arnulf_of_Carinthia" title="wikilink">Arnulf of Carinthia</a>, Aribo's southern neighbour, for support. Svatopluk, however, entered the so-called <a href="Wilhelminer_War" title="wikilink">Wilhelminer War</a> on the side of Aribo and the emperor. In 884, peace returned to the <em>marcha</em>.</p>

<p>A sign of Aribo's strength after this was that he was unable to be unseated by Arnulf when the latter succeeded to the <a href="German_throne" title="wikilink">German throne</a> in 887. In 893, Arnulf appointed Engelschalk II to a portion of the Pannonian march over Aribo's head.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Aribo never reconciled with Arnulf after the Wilhelimner War and his contacts with the Moravians were kept secure. After his falling out, his son <a class="uri" href="Isanrich" title="wikilink">Isanrich</a> got Moravian support against Arnulf. Aribo's descendants formed the <a href="Aribonids" title="wikilink">Aribonid</a> family. They held the <a href="Archbishopric_of_Salzburg" title="wikilink">Archbishopric of Salzburg</a> in the 10th century, but were pushed out of power in the <a href="Duchy_of_Bavaria" title="wikilink">Duchy of Bavaria</a> by the <a class="uri" href="Liutpoldings" title="wikilink">Liutpoldings</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
