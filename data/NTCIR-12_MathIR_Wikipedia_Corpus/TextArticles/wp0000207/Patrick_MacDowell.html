<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>He was born in Belfast in 1799. His father dies whilst he was young and the family lived in relative poverty.</p>

<p>From 1807 to 1811 he boarded at a school in Belfast, run by an engraver named Gordon, who encouraged his attempts at drawing, and from 1811 to 1813 he was under the tuition of a clergyman in Hampshire. </p>

<p>Around 1811 he moved with his mother to <a class="uri" href="Hampshire" title="wikilink">Hampshire</a> in <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>, where they had relatives. In 1813, aged 14 (the then standard age to begin apprenticeships), he was apprenticed to a coach-builder in <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>. However, his master went bankrupt and his training as a coach-builder ended abruptly.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> During this time he was lodging in the house of <a href="Pierre_Francois_Chenu" title="wikilink">Pierre Francois Chenu</a>, the sculptor. It is presumed that this engendered an interest in sculpture within the young MacDowell.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of <a href="John_Constable" title="wikilink">John Constable</a> the painter, he went to the <a href="Royal_Academy" title="wikilink">Royal Academy</a> Schools and he exhibited at the Academy from 1822 until his death.</p>

<p>He was elected a Member on 10 February 1846 and presented as his diploma work a "Nymph.".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>MacDowell died in London on 9 December 1870.</p>

It was moved to Belfast City Hall.</p>
