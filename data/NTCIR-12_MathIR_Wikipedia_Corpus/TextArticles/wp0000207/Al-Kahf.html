<h2 id="circumstances-of-revelation">Circumstances of revelation</h2>

<p>Muslim historian and <a class="uri" href="hagiographer" title="wikilink">hagiographer</a>, <a href="Ibn_Ishaq" title="wikilink">Muhammad bin Ishaq</a>, reported in his book <em><a href="Sirah_Rasul_Allah" title="wikilink">Sira</a></em> that the eighteenth chapter of the Qur'an (which includes the story of Dhu l-Qarnayn) was revealed to the Islamic prophet <a class="uri" href="Muhammad" title="wikilink">Muhammad</a> by Allah on account of some questions posed by <a href="rabbi" title="wikilink">rabbis</a> residing in the city of <a class="uri" href="Medina" title="wikilink">Medina</a> – the verse was revealed during the <a href="Makkan_sura" title="wikilink">Meccan period</a> of Muhammad's life. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad's tribe, the powerful <a href="Quraysh_(tribe)" title="wikilink">Quraysh</a>, were greatly concerned about their tribesman who had started claiming prophethood and wished to consult rabbis about the matter. The Quraysh sent two men to the rabbis of Medina, reasoning that they had superior knowledge of the scriptures and about the prophets of God. The two Quraysh men described their tribesman, Muhammad, to the rabbis.</p>

<p>The rabbis told the men to ask Muhammad three questions:<mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>According to Ibn Ishaq, when Muhammad was informed of the three questions from the rabbis, he said that he would have the answers in the morning but did not say "if God wills it". For fifteen days, Muhammad awaited eagerly for the revelation. Muhammad did not answer the question until then. Doubt in Muhammad began to grow amongst the people of <a class="uri" href="Mecca" title="wikilink">Mecca</a>. Then, after fifteen days, Muhammad received the revelation of <em>al-Kahf</em> as an answer to the questions.</p>
