<hr/>

<p><strong>Joseph Albert Wapner</strong> (born November 15, 1919) is a <a class="uri" href="retired" title="wikilink">retired</a> <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a class="uri" href="judge" title="wikilink">judge</a> and former television judge. He is the first <a href="TV_personality" title="wikilink">star</a> of the ongoing <a href="court_show" title="wikilink">reality courtroom series</a> <em><a href="The_People's_Court" title="wikilink">The People's Court</a></em>. The court show's first run in syndication, with Wapner presiding as judge, lasted from 1981 to 1993, for 12 seasons and 2,484 episodes. Unlike the show's second run which has been presided over by multiple judges, Wapner was the sole judge to preside during the court show's first run.</p>

<p>Wapner's tenure on the program made him the first jurist of <a href="Judge_show#Arbitration-based_reality_court_show" title="wikilink">arbitration-based reality</a> court shows, what is now a most popular trend in the judicial genre. Until the summer of 2013, Wapner also held the title of longest reigning arbiter over <em>The People's Court</em>. However, by completion of the court show's 2012-2013 season, <a href="Marilyn_Milian" title="wikilink">Marilyn Milian</a> captured this title from him and became the longest-reigning judge over the series. Five years after presiding over the <em><a href="The_People's_Court" title="wikilink">The People's Court</a></em>, Wapner returned to television as a judge on the <a href="court_show#List_of_originally_nontraditional_court_shows" title="wikilink">nontraditional courtroom series</a>, <em><a href="Judge_Wapner's_Animal_Court" title="wikilink">Judge Wapner's Animal Court</a></em>, lasting for 2 seasons (1998-1999 and 1999-2000).</p>

After a 4-year hiatus, beginning in 1993, <em>The People's Court</em> returned to the air in 1997, though without Wapner, and still runs today.</p>

Wapner was critical of Sheindlin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>On November 13, 2009, in honor of his 90th birthday on November 15, Wapner made a one-time-only return to the court show, acting as a guest judge, presiding over a case in the current <a href="Marilyn_Milian" title="wikilink">Marilyn Milian</a> era of <em>The People's Court</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

The People's Court is instead a criminal court that hands out long prison sentences, and he is referred as "Commissar Wapner" rather than judge. On August 9, 2008, Wapner appeared as Judge in a <em><a href="Major_League_Baseball_on_Fox" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball on Fox</a></em> Pregame <em>People's Court</em> parody segment called "The Players Court". </p>
