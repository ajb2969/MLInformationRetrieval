<p><strong>Hong Kong Railway Museum</strong> () is a <a href="railway_museum" title="wikilink">railway museum</a> in <a href="Tai_Po" title="wikilink">Tai Po</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, <a class="uri" href="China" title="wikilink">China</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It is now under the management of the <a href="Leisure_and_Cultural_Service_Department" title="wikilink">Leisure and Cultural Service Department</a>. Opened on 20 December 1986, it is located at the site where the <strong>Old Tai Po Market Railway Station</strong> was built in 1913. Admission to the museum is free.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The <a href="Kowloon-Canton_Railway" title="wikilink">Kowloon-Canton Railway</a> (British Section) opened in 1910 in Tai Po Market was one of the stops in the <a href="New_Territories" title="wikilink">New Territories</a>. The station building was erected in 1913. Since then, it acted as a centre of administration and trade which indirectly boosted Tai Po Market's economy by bringing traders there.</p>

<p>The KCR was electrified in 1983 and the station was taken out of service, with new stations being opened to the north (Tai Wo) and south (Tai Po Market) of it. One year later, the Old Tai Po Market Railway Station was <a href="Declared_monuments_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">declared a monument</a>. The site, together with the buildings and relevant exhibits, were then given to the government by the <a href="Kowloon-Canton_Railway_Corporation" title="wikilink">KCRC</a> for the construction of the Museum.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>The building of the station is unique in the way of architectural style among original Kowloon-Canton Railway (British Section). It is of <a href="Lingnan_culture#Architecture" title="wikilink">indigenous Chinese</a> architectural style, with many small figures decorating the exterior, such as are commonly found in existing old southern Chinese temples.</p>

<p>On the left of the museum, there is an exhibition room of train tickets and train models of not only KCR trains but also Japanese <a class="uri" href="Shinkansen" title="wikilink">Shinkansen</a> and <a class="uri" href="Eurostar" title="wikilink">Eurostar</a>. The further internal part of the room is a refurbished ticket office and signalling house.</p>

<p>Two locomotives are on exhibition at the museum:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="EMD_G12" title="wikilink">EMD G12</a> Diesel-electric locomotive #51, introduced in Hong Kong in 1955, which is called "Sir Alexander", named after former <a href="Governors_of_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Governor</a> <a href="Alexander_Grantham" title="wikilink">Alexander Grantham</a></li>
<li>A W. G. Bagnall 0-4-4T narrow gauge <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a>, restored from <a href="the_Philippines" title="wikilink">the Philippines</a> in 1995. The locomotive is one of two that formerly ran on the <a href="narrow_gauge_railway" title="wikilink">narrow gauge</a> <a href="Sha_Tau_Kok_Railway" title="wikilink">Sha Tau Kok Railway</a> line between <a class="uri" href="Fanling" title="wikilink">Fanling</a> and <a href="Sha_Tau_Kok" title="wikilink">Sha Tau Kok</a>. When that closed, they were used by sugar mills in the Philippines. The other locomotive of the pair was also brought back to Hong Kong and is reported to be undergoing restoration.</li>
