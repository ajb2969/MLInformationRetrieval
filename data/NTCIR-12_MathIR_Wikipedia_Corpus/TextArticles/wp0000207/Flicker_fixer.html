<h1>Flicker fixer</h1>
<hr/>

<p> A <strong>flicker fixer</strong> or scan doubler is a piece of <a href="computer_hardware" title="wikilink">computer hardware</a> that <a href="deinterlacing" title="wikilink">de-interlaces</a> an output video signal. The flicker fixer accomplishes this by adjusting the timing of the natively interlaced <a class="uri" href="video" title="wikilink">video</a> <a href="Signalling_(telecommunication)" title="wikilink">signal</a> to suit the needs of a progressive display Ex: <a href="cathode_ray_tube" title="wikilink">CRT</a> computer monitor. Flicker fixers in essence create a progressive frame of video from two interlaced fields of video.</p>

<p>Flicker fixers <a href="sampling_(signal_processing)" title="wikilink">sample</a> the NTSC/PAL output from the output device and store each scan line from the field currently being displayed in <a href="Random_access_memory" title="wikilink">RAM</a> while simultaneously outputting the line alternately with the corresponding neighboring lines from the field stored previously (<em><a href="Deinterlacing#Field_combination_deinterlacing" title="wikilink">weaving</a></em>). Some more advanced flicker fixers integrated in add-on graphics cards use more sophisticated methods. Outputting the image at double scan rate essentially composes a progressive display with all lines from both fields at full vertical refresh rate. This promotes the horizontal <a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a> of the signal from 15.734 kHz to 31.47 kHz (in the NTSC case, numbers for PAL are slightly lower), which can be the used to drive a <a href="Video_Graphics_Array" title="wikilink">VGA</a> monitor from an output device.</p>
<h2 id="instances-of-use">Instances of Use</h2>

<p>One example of a computer that was capable of producing an interlaced image is the <a href="Commodore_International" title="wikilink">Commodore</a> <a class="uri" href="Amiga" title="wikilink">Amiga</a>. The Amiga's default video mode is <a class="uri" href="PAL" title="wikilink">PAL</a> or <a class="uri" href="NTSC" title="wikilink">NTSC</a>. NTSC and PAL interlaced screens have two fields called odd and even. The fields switch every 1/60th of a <a class="uri" href="second" title="wikilink">second</a> on NTSC, or 1/50th of a second on PAL, which allows for more higher resolution while using a narrower signal <a href="Bandwidth_(signal_processing)" title="wikilink">bandwidth</a> than full 50 or 60 <a href="frame_rate" title="wikilink">FPS</a> progressive video would require, but it can also produce an alarming <a href="jitter" title="wikilink">jittering</a> effect for graphics with high contrast details between fields. This NTSC/PAL compatibility gave the Amiga a distinct edge in uses such as television production or <a href="computer_game" title="wikilink">gaming</a>, however since the original Amigas were unable to produce vertically high resolutioned displays without flickering this was unsuitable for other, office-like uses, where there's a need to work with clear high resolution image often for several hours in order to perform typical tasks. Flicker fixers were devised to remedy this.</p>

<p>The later iteration of the Amiga - the <a href="Amiga_3000" title="wikilink">Amiga 3000</a> had a custom chip called <a href="Amiga_custom_chips#Amber" title="wikilink">Amber</a> which could perform flicker-fixing on any signal. The <a href="Enhanced_Chip_Set" title="wikilink">ECS</a> and <a href="Advanced_Graphics_Architecture" title="wikilink">AGA</a> <a class="uri" href="chipset" title="wikilink">chipset</a> could also output VGA display modes. Commodore offered the A2320 Display Enhancer Board for this purpose,<a href="http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=360"></a> The board fit neatly in a video graphics adapter slot on the A2000 series computer. It supported the new video modes offered by the <a href="Amiga_Enhanced_Chip_Set" title="wikilink">Enhanced Chip Set</a> (ECS) and <a class="uri" href="AmigaOS" title="wikilink">AmigaOS</a> 2.0, including the Productivity Mode. Also, the earlier A2024 'Hedley' greyscale monitor featured an integrated flicker fixer, supporting up to 8 shades of grey.</p>
