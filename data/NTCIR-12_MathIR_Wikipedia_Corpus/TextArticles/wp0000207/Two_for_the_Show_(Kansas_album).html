<h1>Two for the Show (Kansas album)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Two for the Show</em></strong> is a double-live album by American <a href="progressive_rock" title="wikilink">progressive rock</a> band <a href="Kansas_(band)" title="wikilink">Kansas</a>, released in 1978. The album was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2008. Recorded over the course of the band's three previous tours in 1977 and 1978, it was Kansas' first live album. It was certified Gold and then Platinum shortly after its release.</p>

<p>One single, "Lonely Wind," was released from the album. The single version was edited to under 3 minutes, and included a small amount of the piano solo that precedes it on the album. It received a reasonable amount of airplay and rose to #60 on the pop charts.</p>

<p>In addition, Kirshner Records issued a promotional album of edited selections from the release, entitled "Kansas Mini Concert" on the spine and label, and "Two for the Show Special Limited Edition" on the cover. It features "Lonely Wind," "Dust in the Wind," "Song For America," and "The Wall." The same songs appear on both sides, and the first side is unbanded, meaning there is no indication on the vinyl of where each song begins.</p>

<p>All of the bonus tracks were recorded for the album but omitted from the original album due to time constraints. Different versions of "Bringing It Back", "Down The Road", "Cheyenne Anthem" and "Sparks of the Tempest" appeared as bonus tracks on the remastered versions of <em><a href="Kansas_(Kansas_album)" title="wikilink">Kansas</a></em>, <em><a href="Song_for_America" title="wikilink">Song for America</a></em>, <em><a class="uri" href="Leftoverture" title="wikilink">Leftoverture</a></em> and <em><a href="Point_of_Know_Return" title="wikilink">Point of Know Return</a></em> respectively. A different, earlier live version of "Lonely Street" appears as a bonus track on the later recorded <em>Live at the Whiskey</em>.</p>

<p>In 2010, Legacy released the Kansas entry in Legacy's Boxed Set series known as The Music of Kansas. The 3rd of 3 discs from this Boxed Set is culled entirely from the double CD version of this album, featuring live cuts from both the original and expanded release, marking the first compilation to feature any of the previously unreleased tracks.</p>
