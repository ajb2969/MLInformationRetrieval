<h1>Conan (talk show)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Conan</em></strong> is a <a href="late-night_talk_show" title="wikilink">late-night talk show</a> airing each Monday through Thursday on <a href="TBS_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">TBS</a> in the United States. The hour-long show premiered on November 8, 2010, and is hosted by writer, comedian and performer <a href="Conan_O'Brien" title="wikilink">Conan O'Brien</a>.</p>

<p>Describing itself as a traditional late-night talk show, <em>Conan</em> draws its comedy from recent news stories, political figures and prominent celebrities, as well as aspects of the <a href="Self-referential_humor" title="wikilink">show itself</a>. The show typically opens with a <a class="uri" href="monologue" title="wikilink">monologue</a> from Conan O'Brien relating to recent headlines and frequently features exchanges with his sidekick, <a href="Andy_Richter" title="wikilink">Andy Richter</a>, and members of the audience. The next segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to media personalities and political figures. The show then closes with either a musical or comedy performance.</p>

<p>On TBS, <em>Conan</em> airs Monday through Thursday beginning at 11:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern_Time" title="wikilink">eastern time</a>. Comedian and actor <a href="Andy_Richter" title="wikilink">Andy Richter</a> continues his role as sidekick to O'Brien, and as the show's announcer. Conan's long-time house band continues with the host under the new moniker <a href="Jimmy_Vivino_and_the_Basic_Cable_Band" title="wikilink">Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band</a>, with <a href="Max_Weinberg" title="wikilink">Max Weinberg</a> being replaced as bandleader by guitarist <a href="Jimmy_Vivino" title="wikilink">Jimmy Vivino</a> and as drummer by regular substitute <a href="James_Wormworth" title="wikilink">James Wormworth</a>, both of whom regularly substituted for Weinberg during his brief departures.</p>

<p>On May 14, 2014, TBS renewed the show through 2018.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="episode-format">Episode format</h2>

<p><em>Conan</em> follows the established six-piece format used during O'Brien's tenure as host of <em>The Tonight Show</em> and <em>Late Night</em>, as well as numerous other talk shows across various networks. Each episode of <em>Conan</em> is 60 minutes in length, including commercials,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and typically features two celebrity interviews and a following musical performance or stand-up comedy act.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes and political figures. Taping of each episode begins at 4:30 p.m. PST, which usually follows a rehearsal, lasting from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="opening-titles">Opening titles</h3>

<p>The show opens with Richter proclaiming "Coming you from <a href="Warner_Bros._Studios" title="wikilink">Warner Brothers Studios</a> in Burbank, it's <em>Conan</em>!", and introducing O'Brien, The Basic Cable Band, as well as that night's guests. Originally, each episode of <em>Conan</em> had a title, unlike most late-night talk shows, which Richter announces at the end of the opening sequence. The titles were in the style of old fashioned murder-mystery radio shows, television sitcoms, or other assorted jokes. The episode titles were dropped in early 2014.</p>

<p>The title sequence was designed by Rob Ashe, a designer who had previously worked on Conan's Legally Prohibited tour, along with Dan Dome and Eric McGilloway, who worked as lead editor and motion graphics designer, respectively, for <em>The Tonight Show</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> There were several different variations of the opening credits, with the final product being inspired by graphic designer <a href="Saul_Bass" title="wikilink">Saul Bass</a>. The opening design process was described by Ashe as utilizing "organic-looking textures made of construction paper, soak them in soda, and light them in <a href="Adobe_Photoshop" title="wikilink">Photoshop</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="monologue">Monologue</h3>

<p>O'Brien opens each episode with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. The monologue is sometimes accompanied by clips and brief comedy skits,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> in addition to occasional interactions between O'Brien and Richter, and the audience.</p>
<h3 id="sketches-and-comedy-bits">Sketches and comedy bits</h3>

<p>One or more comedy bits follow the monologue. Following the monologue, some comedy bits (such as those based on video clips) are presented from the monologue stage. Following the first commercial break, additional comedy sketches are typically presented from the desk area. Some sketches are original and appear only once. Occasionally an additional sketch will air between the first and second guest.</p>

<h3 id="tbs-announcement">TBS announcement</h3>

<p> Following the <a href="2010_Tonight_Show_conflict" title="wikilink">2010 Tonight Show conflict</a>, O'Brien announced on the first day of <a href="The_Legally_Prohibited_from_Being_Funny_on_Television_Tour" title="wikilink">The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour</a> that he had signed a deal with cable network TBS to host a talk show on their late-night lineup, beginning in November 2010. Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian <a href="George_Lopez" title="wikilink">George Lopez</a>'s show, <em><a href="Lopez_Tonight" title="wikilink">Lopez Tonight</a></em>, one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Lopez went on to state, "I can't think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in  It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, "Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation. TBS already has a huge audience of young comedy lovers, and Conan’s show will give these fans even more reasons to watch our network."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>In his own statement about the deal, O'Brien stated, "In three months I’ve gone from network television to Twitter to performing live in theaters, and now I’m headed to <a href="basic_cable" title="wikilink">basic cable</a>. My plan is working perfectly."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> O'Brien's production company, <a class="uri" href="Conaco" title="wikilink">Conaco</a>, reportedly owns all rights to the show.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> In addition to the announcement of the television series, TBS also announced a one-hour TBS Special, featuring several writers for <em>Conan</em>, as well as comedian Reggie Watts, who participated in O'Brien's Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The show was broadcast on June 27, 2010, leading up to the beginning of <em>Conan</em> in early-November.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Additionally, in preparation for the show, a 24-hour "Live-Coco Cam" was set up on October 20, 2010,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and featured various characters and staff members of <em>Conan</em>, including <a href="Richie_Rosenberg" title="wikilink">Richie Rosenberg</a>, otherwise known as "LaBamba,"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> as well as a short online broadcast from O'Brien's office entitled "Show Zero" on November 1, 2010. The show featured O'Brien as host, and was accompanied by Andy Richter, as well as Jerry Vivino, a member of the Basic Cable Band. The broadcast hosted several guests, including actor <a href="Jim_Parsons" title="wikilink">Jim Parsons</a> and indie rock band <a href="Steel_Train" title="wikilink">Steel Train</a>, and lasted a total of four minutes, and 51 seconds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Weeks before the premiere, an orange <a href="Conan_blimp" title="wikilink"><em>Conan</em> blimp</a> was introduced to further promote the show. Designed by Blue Sky, an Atlanta firm,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> the dirigible provided aerial footage for 2010 <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> postseason games airing on TBS. It has since been incorporated into sketches on <em>Conan</em>, including a running gag where the blimp would follow actor <a href="Gary_Busey" title="wikilink">Gary Busey</a> around southern California, much to his chagrin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>The first episode of <em>Conan</em>, entitled "Baa Baa Blackmail",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> premiered on Monday, November 8, 2010 at 11 p.m. <a href="Eastern_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">EST</a> on TBS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The episode's first guest was Arlene Wagner, the curator of <a href="Leavenworth,_Washington" title="wikilink">Leavenworth</a>, <a href="Washington_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Washington</a>'s <a href="Nutcracker_Museum" title="wikilink">Nutcracker Museum</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Wagner's position as <em>Conan</em>{{'}}s debut guest was chosen by fans through a "rigged" poll at Conan O'Brien's official website, TeamCoco.com.

<p>Reviews of the premiere episode by television critics were positive, calling it "a looser, quirkier take on a late-night talk show, but still a late-night talk show."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> James Poniewozik of <em><a href="Time_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Time</a></em> found the episode to be enjoyable, and compared it to O'Brien's tenure during <em>Late Night</em>. Itzkoff went on to state, "The message, overall  is that <em>Conan</em> the show is not so much about a reinvention of the talk show form as a restoration of Conan. He was doing something he wanted to do, a late-night talk show, and NBC made him stop doing it." He also praised the opening monologue, and Conan's performance with Jack White during the episode's conclusion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Frazier Moore of the <em><a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a></em> went on to call the episode "a stylishly back-to-basics hour that radiated hard-won lessons from his brief stay hosting <em>The Tonight Show</em>," in addition to admiring O'Brien's "appealingly stoked yet comfortable" appearance on the show.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> Ken Tucker of <em><a href="Entertainment_Weekly" title="wikilink">Entertainment Weekly</a></em> also appreciated the Masturbating Bear cameo, and went on to call the show "pleasant, if a bit underwhelming."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> Less positive assessments of the show included Tom Gliatto of <em><a href="People_Magazine" title="wikilink">People</a></em>, who accused the show of being a "modest, lowkey and slightly awkward affair."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="ratings">Ratings</h2>

<p>In overnight <a href="Nielsen_Ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Ratings</a>, the series premiere of <em>Conan</em> drew 4,100,000 viewers, leading all late-night talk shows, more than tripling the audience of its direct competition, <em><a href="The_Daily_Show" title="wikilink">The Daily Show</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Colbert_Report" title="wikilink">The Colbert Report</a></em> on <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a>. In the 18-49 demographic, <em>Conan</em> drew a 2.5 rating and 3,285,000 viewers. It was also watched by 2,451,000 adults in the 18-34 demographic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> Ratings throughout the rest of the week fell, and ended with over 2.02 million viewers on Thursday, November 11, 2010. The fourth episode still led every talk show in the 18-34 and 18-49 demographics, however, delivering 980,000 adults and 1,361,000 adults respectively.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The median viewer age for the first week of shows was projected to be at 32,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> significantly younger than that of <em>The Tonight Show</em> and CBS's'' Late Show ''.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The show also premiered in Canada, on <a href="The_Comedy_Network" title="wikilink">The Comedy Network</a> at midnight, drawing 171,000 viewers, and the repeat broadcast at 1 AM on <a href="CTV_television_network" title="wikilink">CTV</a> drew 302,000 viewers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>During O'Brien's second week, ratings remained somewhat consistent, and peaked on November 16, 2010, with 1.84 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The week would go on to average 1.7 million viewers, and earn an average rating of 1.0 in the 18-49 demographic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> During the week of December 13–17, 2010, <em>Conan</em> has fallen behind in the weekly overnight <a href="Nielsen_Ratings" title="wikilink">Nielsen Ratings</a>, averaging only 1.3 million viewers, compared to NBC's <em>The Tonight Show</em> (4.2 million), CBS's <em>Late Show</em> (3.6 million), ABC's <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> (1.6 million), and Comedy Central's <em>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</em> (1.6 million).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>In January 2011, Michael Wright, head of programming of TBS, said the show was "landing right about where we expected it to. At this number, Conan will run as long as he wants it to."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>For the month of June 2011, <em>Conan</em> fell for the first time to fourth among U.S. late-night cable talk shows, behind <em><a href="The_Daily_Show" title="wikilink">The Daily Show</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Colbert_Report" title="wikilink">The Colbert Report</a></em>, and <a href="Chelsea_Handler" title="wikilink">Chelsea Handler</a>'s <em><a href="Chelsea_Lately" title="wikilink">Chelsea Lately</a></em>; <em>Conan</em> attracted an average of 743,000 total viewers, compared with 808,000 viewers for <em>Chelsea Lately</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> Among viewers 18-to-49, O'Brien averaged 503,000 viewers vs. Handler's 559,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<p>Following the cancellation of <em>Lopez Tonight</em>, Steve Koonin of <a href="Turner_Entertainment" title="wikilink">Turner Entertainment</a> stated he "could not be happier with <em>Conan</em> as a show or Conan O'Brien and Team Coco as people and an organization," going on to say that "what Conan has already won is the absolute [embrace] of young people."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 2011, TBS secured the cable syndication rights to <em><a href="The_Big_Bang_Theory" title="wikilink">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> at a reported $4 million per episode to serve as a lead-in to <em>Conan</em> three nights a week. "[O'Brien's] program is the signature show of our line-up and the centerpiece of our network," Koonin said in an interview with <em><a href="The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="wikilink">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>

<p>In March 2012, it was revealed that <em>Conan</em> draws more <a class="uri" href="Hispanic" title="wikilink">Hispanic</a> viewers than any other late night program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>On May 14, 2014, TBS renewed the show through 2018.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>For January—October 2013, <em>Conan</em> attracted $67.4 million in advertising for an audience that is the youngest compared with seven late-night shows on CBS, NBC, ABC, Comedy Central, and E!.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Viewership in 2013 was 808,000, down from 914,000 in 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> <em>Conan</em> does well in ratings among low income <a href="inner_city" title="wikilink">inner city</a> viewers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> As a result many of the show's advertisers often use <em>Conan</em> as a bridge to reach them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p> On May 16, 2010, it was announced that O'Brien would launch his new show at Stage 15 on the <a href="Warner_Bros." title="wikilink">Warner Bros.</a> lot in <a href="Burbank,_California" title="wikilink">Burbank, California</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> the soundstage where films such as <em><a href="Calamity_Jane" title="wikilink">Calamity Jane</a></em>, <em><a href="The_Music_Man_(1962_film)" title="wikilink">The Music Man</a></em>, <em><a href="Blazing_Saddles" title="wikilink">Blazing Saddles</a></em>, <em><a class="uri" href="Ghostbusters" title="wikilink">Ghostbusters</a></em> and the <em><a href="Ocean's_Trilogy" title="wikilink">Ocean's Trilogy</a></em> were shot.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>O'Brien has made explicit that the staff has made an effort thus far to not to reuse any of the previous <em><a href="List_of_Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien_sketches" title="wikilink">Late Night</a></em> or <em><a href="List_of_The_Tonight_Show_with_Conan_O'Brien_sketches" title="wikilink">Tonight Show</a></em> sketches although noted this was sometimes difficult and they were unsure if some sketches were going to work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> However he stated in the past, such as in an interview with Larry King during his last week on CNN, that he possibly would bring back certain bits in time. Indeed, O'Brien has brought back several skits and characters he and his writers created on NBC, even if used less frequently than in the past. These characters and bits include The Masturbating Bear, Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog, Celebrity Survey, Clutch Cargo interviews, and an update on the "Late Night" sketch If They Mated called If They Melded.</p>

<p>Prior to the show's airing, interviews with O'Brien and Richter indicated that the show would more closely represent <em>Late Night</em> than <em>Tonight</em> in regards to content and material, meaning that edgier or questionable content excised as a result of the move to the earlier time slot will no longer be an issue at TBS. On the July 12, 2010 episode of <a href="Marc_Maron" title="wikilink">Marc Maron</a>'s <em>WTF</em> <a class="uri" href="podcast" title="wikilink">podcast</a>, Andy Richter said that they no longer have to "worry about living up to a respected franchise", and that on <em>The Tonight Show</em> certain sketches "that just felt too 12:30" would be cut and how "it'll be nice to not have to worry about that anymore". During an appearance at the 2010 San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival, O'Brien told the audience he was "no longer interested in 'broadening' the audience or trying to reach everybody of all ages," further implying the content will not be toned-down. As the show is on cable, fewer restrictions will apply to the show in regards to explicit content, such as swearing and racier material.</p>

<p>On September 1, 2010, O'Brien officially announced via a <a class="uri" href="YouTube" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> video that the new show's title was simply <em>Conan</em>. <em>Conan</em> as the title required the consent of <a href="Conan_Properties_International" title="wikilink">Conan Properties International</a>, the owners of the <em><a href="Conan_the_Barbarian" title="wikilink">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> franchise, including a "Conan" <a class="uri" href="trademark" title="wikilink">trademark</a> covering certain types of TV series.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to the show's broadcast, it was stated that the set for the show, designed by the same designer of Conan's previous sets, John Shaffner, would be inspired by The Legally Prohibited Tour, adopting more of a "theatre" appearance than the previous shows. Shaffner commented on the choice of the show's chair, stating, "You find one that you like and then you build it yourself to make it a little shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer  But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they’ll say, 'Oooh this is a hard chair.'"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The rest of the set has been described as being "filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens," and has been compared to the set of his most recent stint on <em>The Tonight Show</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The new set features several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Additionally, Andy Richter, who remained behind a <a class="uri" href="lectern" title="wikilink">lectern</a> during <em>The Tonight Show</em>{{'}}s seven-month run, now joins O'Brien during celebrity interviews on the main set.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p>Conan O'Brien's longtime band, originally known as The Max Weinberg 7, then The Tonight Show Band, and later as the Legally Prohibited Band, serve as the <em>Conan</em> house band, and are fronted by longtime guitarist <a href="Jimmy_Vivino" title="wikilink">Jimmy Vivino</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The band also consists of <a href="Richie_Rosenberg" title="wikilink">Richie "LaBamba" Rosenberg</a> on <a class="uri" href="trombone" title="wikilink">trombone</a>, <a href="Scott_Healy" title="wikilink">Scott Healy</a> on <a href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">keyboard</a>, <a href="Mike_Merritt_(musician)" title="wikilink">Mike Merritt</a> on <a href="bass_guitar" title="wikilink">bass guitar</a>, <a href="Mark_Pender" title="wikilink">Mark Pender</a> on <a class="uri" href="trumpet" title="wikilink">trumpet</a> and <a href="Jerry_Vivino" title="wikilink">Jerry Vivino</a> on <a href="woodwind" title="wikilink">woodwinds</a>. When the group moved to Los Angeles to play for <em>The Tonight Show</em>, they added an eighth member, <a href="James_Wormworth" title="wikilink">James Wormworth</a>, on percussion. <a href="Max_Weinberg" title="wikilink">Max Weinberg</a>, who had served as O'Brien's bandleader and drummer since 1993, does not appear on the new program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Weinberg was not a part of the Legally Prohibited Tour, and remained vague throughout most of 2010 about the possibility of his participation in the new TBS show.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> Weinberg's decision was influenced by a combination of a major <a href="heart_surgery" title="wikilink">heart surgery</a> he had in February 2010, and the fact that his family never left their native <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>, even during the <em>Tonight Show</em> period, both issues that he kept private until an October 2010 interview.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a> Percussionist James Wormworth, who often acted as Weinberg's on-air substitute, serves as the band's permanent drummer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>

<p>Following Weinberg's exit, O'Brien sought to revamp the show's title theme song. In an interview with <em><a href="New_York_(magazine)" title="wikilink">New York Magazine</a></em>, O'Brien expressed his desire to create a new introduction from the previous <em>Late Night</em> and <em>Tonight</em> compositions, which were used for O'Brien's entire 17-year relationship with NBC, and ultimately unveil a new signature sound for the show. The new theme song was co-written by bandleader Jimmy Vivino, and O'Brien himself. Despite no obvious copyright issues to continue using the previous theme, which was written by <a href="Howard_Shore" title="wikilink">Howard Shore</a> and <a href="John_Lurie" title="wikilink">John Lurie</a>, O'Brien stated of the transition to a new composition, "it just felt like the right thing to do  There's this feeling of, 'Let's try and build something new.' I came out to that theme for seventeen years and it does feel like, you know what? Let's try some new stuff. Let's try and change it up."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> However, the closing theme from his previous NBC shows was retained in a slightly altered form.</p>

<p> In <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a>, the program now airs on <a href="Go!_(Australian_TV_channel)" title="wikilink">GO!</a>, a <a href="Freeview_(Australia)" title="wikilink">multichannel</a> of the <a href="Nine_Network" title="wikilink">Nine Network</a> from August 2012 following the <a href="2012_Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">2012 Olympic Games</a>. Originally it was intended to screen within 12 hours after its original U.S. broadcast at 11:30pm weeknights,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> however GO! will now screen the program approximately 36 hours later, beginning on Wednesday, November 10, meaning the program will also air on Saturday nights. <a href="The_Comedy_Channel" title="wikilink">The Comedy Channel</a> which aired the previous versions of Conan's shows announced it would not air the program as the Nine Network had exclusive rights to Time Warner programs. Between November 2010 to July 2012, Conan was aired on <a href="GEM_(Australian_TV_channel)" title="wikilink">GEM</a>.</p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="Israel" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, the program began airing in early 2011 on the newly-launched <a href="Comedy_Central_Israel" title="wikilink">Comedy Central Israel</a> channel. episodes were aired 4-5 days after their original TBS broadcasts. However, the channel has discontinued airing <em>Conan</em> in October 2011.</p>

<p>From November 8, 2010 to August 30, 2013, the program aired in <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a> on cable channel <a href="The_Comedy_Network" title="wikilink">The Comedy Network</a> on Monday to Thursday nights (Tuesday to Friday mornings) at midnight ET/PT, with a repeat on broadcast network <a href="CTV_Television_Network" title="wikilink">CTV</a> at 1:07 a.m. local time. The program was only initially announced for CTV, leading to some concern about the unusually late time slot, two hours after its airing in the United States for viewers in the <a href="Eastern_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">Eastern Time Zone</a> (the program airs on <a href="CTV_Atlantic" title="wikilink">CTV Atlantic</a> at 1:05 a.m. <a href="Atlantic_Time_Zone" title="wikilink">AT</a> / 12:05 a.m. ET). This is due to local and <a href="CTV_News" title="wikilink">national</a> newscasts in the 11:00 p.m. hour, and CTV's commitments to <em><a href="The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart" title="wikilink">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a></em> at 12:05 a.m. and <em><a href="The_Colbert_Report" title="wikilink">The Colbert Report</a></em> at 12:35 a.m.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> CTV executives later said the program would likely air earlier on The Comedy Network, which is owned by CTV.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> However, that channel also had a conflict, since it has long aired both <em>Daily</em> and <em>Colbert</em> during the 11:00 p.m. ET hour, simulcasting the Comedy Central feed.<br/>
The Comedy Network then attempted to move up both programs to 10:00 p.m. ET beginning in September 2010, presumably to make room for <em>Conan</em> at 11:00; however, there were intermittent "technical difficulties" with getting the shows in time for the earlier airing, particularly for a series of special live <em>Daily</em> episodes in late October, which meant re-runs were aired in their place. After viewer complaints about the missed episodes, Comedy elected to move both shows back to their previous timeslots, meaning that <em>Conan</em> was rescheduled on that channel to midnight, on a one-hour delay from TBS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> On September 3, 2013, <a href="Much_Music" title="wikilink">Much Music</a> began broadcasting the program every Monday to Thursday at 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. Pacific),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> though it was moved back to its time-delayed midnight airing the following month. The repeat on CTV now airs at 1:37 a.m. after <em><a href="Late_Night_with_Seth_Meyers" title="wikilink">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a></em>. On September 3, 2014, the program began airing on Much at 12:30 a.m. after <em><a class="uri" href="@midnight" title="wikilink">@midnight</a></em>.</p>

<p>Selling rights to a Canadian channel was necessary, since TBS ceased being available in Canada in October 2007. The local Atlanta station through which Canadian cable subscribers had previously received TBS programming then adopted a distinct schedule as <a class="uri" href="WPCH-TV" title="wikilink">WPCH-TV</a>. Some speculated that WPCH might pick up the program anyway, since the revamped station continues to air some of the same syndicated series as TBS, but WPCH later indicated explicitly that it had no plans to broadcast the new O'Brien program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<p>In the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a> and <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="wikilink">Ireland</a> the show airs on the channel <a class="uri" href="truTV" title="wikilink">truTV</a> since its launch in August, 2014. It airs Tuesdays to Fridays at 1am.</p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portugal</a>, <em>Conan</em> is retitled <em>Conan O'Brien</em>. The show is aired on <a href="SIC_Radical" title="wikilink">SIC Radical</a>, in the same timeslot as his previous NBC shows, with daily broadcasts beginning in October 5 2009. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> The show airs Monday to Friday beginning around 20h45 to 21h30, following <a href="The_Daily_Show_with_John_Stewart" title="wikilink">The Daily Show with John Stewart</a>, with occasional reruns interspersed among new shows. New episodes air about two weeks after US broadcast.</p>

<p>The show will be aired in <a class="uri" href="Indonesia" title="wikilink">Indonesia</a> on <a href="FX_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">FX</a> &amp; NET. It will be aired Monday on FX, while NET will be aired sometime later.</p>
