<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>William Roper the second was the eldest son of John Roper (d. 1524), <a href="Attorney-General#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Attorney-General</a> to <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry VIII</a>, and his wife Jane (died c.1544), daughter and coheir of <a href="John_Fyneux" title="wikilink">Sir John Fyneux</a>, Chief Justice of <a href="Queen's_Bench" title="wikilink">King's Bench</a>. The Ropers were an ancient <a href="Kent" title="wikilink">Kentish</a> family, owners of the manor of St Dunstan outside the West Gate of <a class="uri" href="Canterbury" title="wikilink">Canterbury</a>, since known as the Roper Gate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He was educated at one of the <a href="England" title="wikilink">English</a> universities and the studied law at <a href="Lincoln's_Inn" title="wikilink">Lincoln's Inn</a>, being <a href="called_to_the_bar" title="wikilink">called to the bar</a> in 1525. He was appointed Clerk of the Pleas in the <a href="Court_of_King's_Bench" title="wikilink">Court of King's Bench</a>, a post previously held by his father, holding the post until shortly before his death. Aged about twenty-three it is thought he joined the household of Sir Thomas More, marrying Margaret, More's eldest daughter, in 1521.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Desiderius_Erasmus" title="wikilink">Erasmus</a>, who knew More and his family well, described Roper as a young man "who is wealthy, of excellent and modest character and not unacquainted with literature".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Roper became a convert to the <a href="Lutheranism" title="wikilink">Lutheran</a> doctrine of <a href="Justification_(theology)" title="wikilink">Justification by Faith</a> and spoke so freely of his belief that he was summoned to appear before <a href="Thomas_Wolsey" title="wikilink">Cardinal Wolsey</a> on an accusation of <a class="uri" href="heresy" title="wikilink">heresy</a>. More often disputed with Roper over his belief. He said to his daughter,  To these prayers by More, Roper attributed his return to <a href="Roman_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>He was a member of various Parliaments (as MP for several constituencies including Rochester and Canterbury) between 1529 and 1558 and appointed <a href="High_Sheriff_of_Kent" title="wikilink">High Sheriff of Kent</a> for 1554–55.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Although he remained a Roman Catholic, he was permitted to retain his office of <a class="uri" href="prothonotary" title="wikilink">prothonotary</a> of the <a href="Court_of_King's_Bench" title="wikilink">Court of King's Bench</a> after the accession of <a href="Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Elizabeth I</a>. However, his diatribe against Elizabeth's late mother, <a href="Anne_Boleyn" title="wikilink">Anne Boleyn</a>, in his biography of More earned him the enmity of many Elizabethan loyalists and Protestants.</p>

<p>His <a class="uri" href="biography" title="wikilink">biography</a> of Sir Thomas More was written during the reign of <a href="Mary_I_of_England" title="wikilink">Mary I</a> nearly twenty years after More's death, but was not printed until 1626, when it became a primary source for More's earliest biographers because of Roper's intimate knowledge of his father-in-law.</p>

<p>Roper is an important character in <a href="Robert_Bolt" title="wikilink">Robert Bolt</a>'s famous play <em><a href="A_Man_for_All_Seasons" title="wikilink">A Man for All Seasons</a></em>, being portrayed as a contrarian, somewhat thick-headed man who would always oppose whatever doctrine was the established one. After arguing theology with Roper, More says, "They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers, always swimming against the stream. Old Roper was the same."</p>

<p>In the <a href="A_Man_for_All_Seasons_(1966_film)" title="wikilink">1966 film adaptation</a> Roper was portrayed by <a href="Corin_Redgrave" title="wikilink">Corin Redgrave</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
