<h2 id="youth">Youth</h2>

<p>In 1989, Ammann, younger brother of <a href="Bob_Ammann" title="wikilink">Bob Ammann</a>, played for the <a href="Los_Angeles_Heat" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Heat</a> in the <a href="Western_Soccer_League" title="wikilink">Western Soccer League</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1990, Ammann graduated from <a href="Mater_Dei_High_School_(Santa_Ana,_California)" title="wikilink">Mater Dei High School</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He entered <a href="California_State_University,_Fullerton" title="wikilink">Cal State-Fullerton</a> where he played on the men's soccer team from 1990 to 1993. In 1993, the Titans went to the NCAA <a href="NCAA_Men's_Soccer_Championship" title="wikilink">Final Four</a>. That year, he also played for the <a href="East_Los_Angeles_Cobras" title="wikilink">East Los Angeles Cobras</a> in the <a class="uri" href="USISL" title="wikilink">USISL</a>.</p>
<h2 id="professional">Professional</h2>

<p>In 1994, Mike Stevens, the director of <a href="Charlton_Athletic_F.C." title="wikilink">Charlton Athletic F.C.</a> saw Ammann play in the NCAA Final Four. He contacted Ammann and offered him a trial with Charlton. Ammann played for Charlton Athletic from 1994 to 1996. When <a href="Major_League_Soccer" title="wikilink">Major League Soccer</a> started in 1996, Ammann signed with the then-<a href="Kansas_City_Wizards" title="wikilink">Kansas City Wiz</a> late in the inaugural season. In 1997, he set a league record (since broken) of twenty-one wins. Before the 1999 season, Ammann was traded to the <a class="uri" href="MetroStars" title="wikilink">MetroStars</a> with <a href="Mark_Chung" title="wikilink">Mark Chung</a> for <a href="Tony_Meola" title="wikilink">Tony Meola</a> and <a href="Alexi_Lalas" title="wikilink">Alexi Lalas</a>. That season the MetroStars squad finished with the worst record in league history. However, Ammann played well despite the lack of success.</p>

<p>The 2000 season was Ammann's best as the Metros went through a rebirth. Ammann was selected to the 2000 MLS All Star game and starting in goal for the Eastern Conference. However, Ammann missed the last five weeks of the season after an incident involving <a href="Mamadou_Diallo" title="wikilink">Mamadou Diallo</a>. In a game against the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Mutiny" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Mutiny</a>, Diallo stepped on the Metro goalie, breaking three ribs, puncturing his lung, and giving him a concussion. The incident, which was dubbed <strong><em>Crime of the Century</em></strong> by Metro teammate <a href="Mike_Petke" title="wikilink">Mike Petke</a>, saw Diallo receive no punishment. Ammann, on the other hand, had to miss the rest of the regular season, returning for the playoffs and shutting out the <a href="Chicago_Fire_S.C." title="wikilink">Chicago Fire</a> 2-0.</p>

<p>With the emergence of <a href="Tim_Howard" title="wikilink">Tim Howard</a> for the MetroStars, Ammann was traded to <a href="D.C._United" title="wikilink">D.C. United</a> for <a href="Richie_Williams" title="wikilink">Richie Williams</a> and an <a href="allocation_(MLS)" title="wikilink">allocation</a> before the 2001 MLS season. Injuries dogged him, however, and he retired after not playing a minute in 2002. Ammann's doctor had never performed the procedure prior to operating on Ammann and left him permanently disabled. Ammann suffers disabilities in his right and left arms and hands. Dr. Hazel was found guilty by a jury of Malpractice in D.C. Courts. Although Ammann received a favorable decision, his fees outweighed the verdict adding another hardship to his removal from the game. He has since been outspoken about some of the problems of MLS.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
