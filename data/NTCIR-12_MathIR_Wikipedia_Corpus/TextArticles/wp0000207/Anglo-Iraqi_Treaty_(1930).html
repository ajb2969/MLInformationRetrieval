<h1>Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Anglo-Iraqi Treaty</strong> of 1930 was a treaty of alliance between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the <a href="British_Mandate_of_Mesopotamia" title="wikilink">British-Mandate</a>-controlled administration of the <a class="uri" href="Hashemite" title="wikilink">Hashemite</a> <a href="Kingdom_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">Kingdom of Iraq</a>. The treaty was between the governments of <a href="George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">George V of the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Faisal_I_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">Faisal I of Iraq</a>. High Commissioner <a href="Francis_Humphrys" title="wikilink">Francis Humphrys</a> signed for the United Kingdom and <a href="List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Nuri_as-Said" title="wikilink">Nuri as-Said</a> signed for Iraq. The 1930 treaty was based upon an earlier <a href="Anglo-Iraqi_Treaty" title="wikilink">Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922</a> but took into account <a href="Iraq_Petroleum_Company" title="wikilink">Iraq's increased importance to British interests given new oil finds made in 1927</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>During the <a href="Mesopotamian_campaign" title="wikilink">Mesopotamian Campaign</a> of World War I, armed forces of the United Kingdom, fighting for the <a href="Allies_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">Allies</a>, defeated the forces of the <a href="Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire</a>, fighting for the <a href="Central_Powers" title="wikilink">Central Powers</a>. After the <a href="Aftermath_of_World_War_I" title="wikilink">war ended</a>, armed forces of the United Kingdom remained in the area that was to become the Kingdom of Iraq. In 1920, after the <a href="Partitioning_of_the_Ottoman_Empire" title="wikilink">Ottoman Empire was partitioned</a>, the United Kingdom formally occupied what was to become Iraq under a <a href="League_of_Nations_mandate" title="wikilink">mandate</a> from the <a href="League_of_Nations" title="wikilink">League of Nations</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Kingdom of Iraq began with the coronation of <a href="List_of_Kings_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">King</a> <a href="Faisal_I_of_Iraq" title="wikilink">Faisal I</a> on 23 August 1921. The 1930 treaty provided a path towards nominal independence for Iraq two years later at the termination of the mandate and upon the entry of Iraq itself as a member of the League of Nations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The main purpose of the treaty was to give the British a variety of commercial and military rights within the country after independence in exchange for which Iraq would get nothing. Critics point out that the treaty was not negotiated, but rather dictated to the British-controlled government so as to avoid any possibility of real negotiations with a post-independence government.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> was to write that the 1930 treaty provided that the British could maintain <a href="Royal_Air_Force_station" title="wikilink">air bases</a> near <a class="uri" href="Basra" title="wikilink">Basra</a> and <a href="Habbaniyah" title="wikilink">Habbaniya</a> "in times of peace" and have the right of transit for military forces and supplies "at all times." In addition, Churchill indicated that the treaty would provide "all possible facilities" including the use of railways, rivers, ports, and airways for the passage of armed forces "during times of war."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The treaty gave the British almost unlimited rights to base military forces in Iraq. It further provided for the unconditional and unlimited right of the British to move troops into or through Iraq. In 1941, the terms of the treaty were used to justify a <a href="Anglo-Iraqi_War" title="wikilink">British invasion</a> and occupation of Iraq after a <a href="1941_Iraqi_coup_d'état" title="wikilink">nationalist coup</a> whose leaders had contacts among the Axis powers. The British used the terms of the treaty as a basis for an occupation that lasted until end of 1947. As they prepared to depart Iraq, an attempt was made to get the British installed government of Iraq to sign a new military treaty giving the British even more powers than under then 1930 treaty. While the treaty was approved, it never came into effect because of unrest and large demonstrations in Iraq against it.</p>

<p>Critics consider the treaty a document which was nothing more than a cover for the British to permanently limit the independence of Iraq and to give themselves a right to intervene in the internal affairs of Iraq as they pleased. The treaties always revolved around protecting the access to Iraqi oil resources by British companies by giving the British the right of military intervention in the country.</p>

<p>Whereas the mandatory responsibilities accepted by His Britannic Majesty in respect of 'Iraq will automatically terminate upon the admission of 'Iraq to the League of Nations; and Whereas His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of 'Iraq consider that the relations which will subsist between them as independent sovereigns should be defined by the conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance and Amity:</p>

There shall be established between the High Contracting Parties a close alliance in consecration of their friendship, their cordial understanding and their good relations, and there shall be full and frank consultation between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests.</p>

<p>Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or might create difficulties for the other party thereto.</p>
<h3 id="article-2.">Article 2.</h3>

<p>Each High Contracting Party will be represented at the Court of the other High Contracting Party by a diplomatic representative duly accredited.</p>
<h3 id="article-3.">Article 3.</h3>

<p>Should any dispute between 'Iraq and a third State produce a situation which involves the risk of a rupture with that State, the High Contracting Parties will concert together with a view to the settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of any other international obligation which may be applicable to the case.</p>
<h3 id="article-4.">Article 4.</h3>

<p>Should, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 above, either of the High Contracting Parties become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will, subject always to the provisions of Article 9 below, immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally. In the event of an imminent menace of war the High Contracting Parties will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence.

<h3 id="article-5.">Article 5.</h3>

<p>It is understood between the High Contracting Parties that responsibility for the maintenance of internal order in 'Iraq and, subject to the provisions of Article 4 above, for the defence of 'Iraq from external aggression rests with His Majesty the King of 'Iraq. Nevertheless His Majesty the King of 'Iraq recognises that the permanent maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essential communications of His Britannic Majesty is in the common interest of the High Contracting Parties.</p>

<p>For this purpose and in order to facilitate the discharge of the obligations of His Britanic Majesty under Article 4 above His Majesty the King of 'Iraq undertakes to grant to His Britannic Majesty for the duration of the Alliance sites for air bases to be selected by His Britannic Majesty at or in the vicinity of Basra and for an air base to be selected by His Britannic Majesty to the west of the Euphrates. His Majesty the King of 'Iraq further authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain forces upon 'Iraq territory at the above localities in accordance with the provisions of the Annexure of this Treaty on the understanding that the presence of those forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of 'Iraq.</p>
<h3 id="article-6.">Article 6.</h3>

<p>The Annexure hereto shall be regarded as an integral part of the present Treaty.</p>
<h3 id="article-7.">Article 7.</h3>

<p>The High Contracting Parties recognise that, upon the entry into force of this Treaty, all responsibilities devolving under the Treaties and Agreements referred to in Article 7 hereof upon His Britannic Majesty in respect of 'Iraq will, in so far as His Britannic Majesty is concerned, then automatically and completely come to an end, and that such responsibilities, in so far as they continue at all, will devolve upon His Majesty the King of 'Iraq alone.</p>

<p>It is also recognised that all responsibilities devolving upon His Britannic Majesty in respect of 'Iraq under any other international instrument, in so far as they continue at all, should similarly devolve upon His Majesty the King of 'Iraq alone, and the High Contracting Parties shall immediately take such steps as may be necessary to secure the transference to His Majesty the King of 'Iraq of these responsibilities.</p>
<h3 id="article-9.">Article 9.</h3>

<p>Nothing in the present Treaty is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the High Contracting Parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the twenty-seventh day of August, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight.</p>
<h3 id="article-10.">Article 10.</h3>

<p>Should any difference arise relative to the application or the interpretation of this Treaty and should the High Contracting Parties fail to settle such difference by direct negotiation, then it shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations.</p>

In case of disagreement in this matter the difference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations. In faith whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty and have affixed thereto their seals. Done at Baghdad in duplicate this thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and thirty, of the Christian Era, corresponding to the fourth day of Safar, One thousand three hundred and forty-nine, Hijrah.</p>

<h4 id="clause-7.">Clause 7.</h4>
