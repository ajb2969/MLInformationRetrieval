<h1>Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30</em></strong> is a <a href="first-person_shooter" title="wikilink">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video_game" title="wikilink">video game</a> developed by <a href="Gearbox_Software" title="wikilink">Gearbox Software</a> and published by <a class="uri" href="Ubisoft" title="wikilink">Ubisoft</a> for <a href="Xbox_(console)" title="wikilink">Xbox</a>, <a href="Microsoft_Windows" title="wikilink">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="OS_X" title="wikilink">OS X</a>. It is the first game in the <a href="Brothers_in_Arms_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Brothers in Arms</em> series</a>. The game takes place during <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> and focuses on tactics. It was ported to the <a class="uri" href="Wii" title="wikilink">Wii</a> in 2008, as part of the <em><a href="Brothers_in_Arms:_Double_Time" title="wikilink">Brothers in Arms: Double Time</a></em> compilation.</p>

<p><em>Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30</em> was also used to recreate scenarios in a 2005 <a href="History_(TV_channel)" title="wikilink">History Channel</a> special, also titled <em>Brothers in Arms</em>.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p>In most levels of <em>Brothers in Arms</em>, the player is in command of one or two separate 1-3 man teams, with the exception of several sections in which the player is not in command of any unit. There are two types of teams, which are automatically provided before each mission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire team: Made up of soldiers with the <a href="M1_Garand" title="wikilink">M1 Garand</a> and the <a href="M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle" title="wikilink">Browning Automatic Rifle</a> and used to fix the enemy with <a href="suppressive_fire" title="wikilink">suppressive fire</a>.</li>
<li>Assault team: Made up of soldiers usually with the <a href="M1A1_Carbine" title="wikilink">M1A1 Carbine</a> and the <a href="Thompson_submachine_gun" title="wikilink">Thompson submachine gun</a> and is good for <a href="Flanking_maneuver" title="wikilink">flanking</a> the enemy while they are pinned down by the player's fire team.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, some levels provide the player with a tank in lieu of a team, providing players with heavy firepower and mobile cover. The player can also man the pintle-mounted <a href="M1919_Browning_machine_gun" title="wikilink">M1919 Browning machine gun</a> on the tank for additional suppression.</p>

<p><em>Brothers in Arms</em> is notable for its intuitive command system. Teams and tanks can be ordered to move, lay suppressive fire, rally, find cover, and charge the enemy. The game stresses at multiple points the effectiveness of fire and maneuver tactics, known as the Four Fs actually used by the military during World War II, expressed in the game tutorial as "Find, Fix, Flank, Finish" describing the steps in suppressing and flanking an enemy.</p>

<p>The focus on team command is emphasized by providing the player with an inaccurate aim. Instead of having almost perfect accuracy with weapons in games like <em><a href="Call_of_Duty" title="wikilink">Call of Duty</a></em> and <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor_(series)" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a></em>, <em>Brothers in Arms</em> models weapons with erratic accuracy, and enemy fire can interfere with a player's aim to simulate the effects of suppressive fire. The relative lack of accuracy is designed to simulate the difficulty in hitting targets in a combat situation as well as forcing the player to use team members to engage enemy units and provide better tactical opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p><em>Brothers in Arms</em> is based on the true story of the <a href="502nd_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)" title="wikilink">502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment</a> of the famed <a href="101st_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="wikilink">101st Airborne Division</a> who were dropped behind German lines on <a href="Normandy_landings" title="wikilink">D-Day</a>. The game is based on the historical <a href="Mission_Albany" title="wikilink">Mission Albany</a>, in which the player has to complete true-to-life missions of the 101st.</p>

<p>The game starts the player, Sergeant Matt Baker of the <a href="502nd_Infantry_Regiment" title="wikilink">502nd Infantry Regiment</a> at the climax of the <a href="Battle_of_Bloody_Gulch" title="wikilink">Battle of Bloody Gulch</a>. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Paratroopers make a desperate stand as Leggett, the squads radioman makes a frantic request for tank support. Unable to raise support or reinforcements, the situation for the Paratroopers only gets worse when a <a href="Panzer_IV" title="wikilink">Panzer IV</a> fires directly at them, incapacitating Baker. An unhinged Leggett is seen firing his <a href="Colt_45" title="wikilink">Colt 45</a> pistol at the tank, only for him to be instantly killed by another shot. Platoon Sergeant "Mac" is seen trying to resuscitate Baker before fading into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The game then snaps back to the <a href="American_airborne_landings_in_Normandy" title="wikilink">initial jump off</a>, taking place hours before the <a href="Normandy_Landings" title="wikilink">Normandy Landings</a>. Baker, along with the rest of the squad are preparing to disembark from the <a class="uri" href="C-47" title="wikilink">C-47</a>, when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire. Baker is thrown from the plane, although loosing his kit in the drop he manages to land safely. Managing to find Mac, the pair search for the others, eventually finding Leggett and Cole using the <a href="Countersign_(military)" title="wikilink">Thunder, Flash</a> acknowledgement. Despite being way off course, the group led by Mac destroy several <a href="Flak_38" title="wikilink">Flak 38</a> anti-aircraft guns using satchel explosives. By morning, more of the squad has managed to find one another, including Corporal Hartsock, who Mac delegates to Baker to clear an important road leading to <a href="Utah_Beach" title="wikilink">Utah Beach</a>. After fighting their way through several German soldiers, as well as a mortar team, Baker and Hartsock link up with Allen and Garnett, two other members of their squad. Using a <a href="Browning_30._Calibre_Machine_Gun" title="wikilink">Browning 30. Calibre Machine Gun</a>, the four troops defend against a counterattack from the beach and succeed in securing the main road, therefore securing the landing at Utah.</p>

<p>With the beachhead secure, Baker is tasked to clear out a makeshift barracks used by the Germans with Hartsock assisting. Along the way they intervene in Allen and Garnett almost being killed by the barracks garrison (Allen and Garnett were attempting to destroy the structure with a <a class="uri" href="Bazooka" title="wikilink">Bazooka</a>). With no hindrance to their advance, the 502nd are now able to press on to securing <a class="uri" href="Foucarville" title="wikilink">Foucarville</a>, still being contested by the Germans and the Paratroopers. Alongside Hartsock, Allen and Garnett, Baker succeeds in engaging a larger force of German soldiers, and also manages to destroy several mortar positions and a tank before once again linking up with Mac. At the end of the mission, Mac confesses to Baker that he assumed he was too shy to handle being squad leader (a fact Baker still isn't comfortable in handling) but his doubts have been now made unfound because of his abilities to fight effectively.</p>

<p>The next mission has Baker and his team destroying poles erected in clear fields so that the <a href="Glider_Infantry" title="wikilink">Glider Infantry</a> can land safely in the area. The task is complicated however because the Germans have plenty of reinforcements, and enough <a href="MG42_Machine_Gun" title="wikilink">MG42 Machine Gun</a> emplacements to defend the fields effectively. Nevertheless, Baker succeeds and the <a href="Glider_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">gliders</a> land with ease. The 502nd are then tasked with clearing the town of <a class="uri" href="Vierville" title="wikilink">Vierville</a> on D-Day+1, with assistance from an <a href="M3_Stuart_Tank" title="wikilink">M3 Stuart Tank</a> whose Commander happens to be Baker's best friend, Sergeant George Risner. Baker's squad, as well as heavy fire support from George manage to clear the town, as well as repel an armoured counterattack before embarking on the tank to secure a vital crossroad near <a href="St._Come_du_Mont" title="wikilink">St. Come du Mont</a> in the next mission. Although successful in breaking through the heavy German defenses, George's tank is ambushed by a <a class="uri" href="Panzerfaust" title="wikilink">Panzerfaust</a>, rendering the tank immobile. George makes a heroic last stand to ensure Baker survives, although it costs him his life.</p>

<p>On D-Day+2, still dealing with the death of his best friend, Baker and the regrouped 502nd are prepared to liberate <a href="St._Come_du_Mont" title="wikilink">St. Come du Mont</a>, but Mac instructs Baker to first clear out a German machine gun nest which has been making transit in the area risky for the troops. Baker and squad succeeds in doing so, the road to <a href="St._Come_du_Mont" title="wikilink">St. Come du Mont</a> is opened. However, taking the town proves to be challenging as the <a class="uri" href="Fallschirmjäger" title="wikilink">Fallschirmjäger</a> is defending, with armour support. Despite having the odds against them, the 502nd succeed in capturing the town. The next day, Baker's squad is ordered to secure a barn, with <a href="Sherman_Tank" title="wikilink">Sherman Tank</a> support. The relatively easy task is completed, but not before Leggett can be heard shouting for Baker, who is surrounded by the dead bodies of Allen and Garnett. Distraught by the loss of life, Baker, Hartsock and Desola express their anger at Leggett, who is seen alone and inconsolable at what has occurred. Bakers team fights through the remaining stragglers from <a class="uri" href="Vierville" title="wikilink">Vierville</a> including <a href="Stug_IV" title="wikilink">Stug IV</a> tanks to secure a bridge being used to transport German armour towards the beaches. With Sherman support, Baker wrestles control of the bridge from the heavily fortified Germans and destroys it as intended by Mac.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Carentan" title="wikilink">Carentan</a>, the crossroad town linking Utah and Omaha beaches is the next designated target for the 502nd. On D-Day+4, Baker links up with Cole to secure a causeway leading to Carentan, engaging several German soldiers in the process. <a href="Stuka_dive_bombers" title="wikilink">Stuka dive bombers</a> make crossing one of the bridges incredibly risky, one bomb being able to knock Baker unconscious. Baker comes too the next day, only to find out that Private Desola was killed inches from him. Cole leads an attack on a heavily defended German farmhouse, using smoke barrages to conceal themselves from the numerous machine gun emplacements. The charge is successful, Mac going so far as to congratulate Baker for a fine execution of command under pressing circumstances. Two hours pass after the charge, and the men of the 502nd are weary and exhausted. Hopes to earn rest are soon dashed, as the farmhouse comes under attack by German forces. To make matters worse, a detachment of troops has been pinned down by the enemy advance, meaning defending the farmhouse for those that remain will be even harder whilst Baker is sent with Hartsock, Obrieski and Zanovich to the rescue of Lt. Combs. Returning with Combs, Baker and his team takes up defensive positions around the farmhouse as swarms of German infantry attack. The attack is heavy, but Baker and the rest of the 502nd manage to repel the attack.</p>

<p>The next day, D-Day+6, Baker and the 502nd push into <a class="uri" href="Carentan" title="wikilink">Carentan</a>, destroying German armour and making steady progress.</p>

<p>The sequel <em><a href="Brothers_in_Arms:_Earned_in_Blood" title="wikilink">Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood</a></em> is also based on the last missions of the 101st, such as link up with <a href="82nd_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="wikilink">82nd Airborne Division</a> and capture of <a class="uri" href="Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte" title="wikilink">Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte</a> (which historically did not involve the 101st A/B as a whole, but some members volunteered to assist the undermanned 82nd Division). The player takes the role of Matt Baker, a <a class="uri" href="paratrooper" title="wikilink">paratrooper</a> (based on <a href="Harrison_C._Summers" title="wikilink">Harrison C. Summers</a> and various other people) and leader of an <a href="airborne_forces" title="wikilink">airborne</a> squad from Fox Company. The missions range from dropping into France on June 6 to the final defense of Hill 30 eight days later. Baker must lead his men through troubled times and make decisions that may result in the death of a paratrooper, which causes him much heartache.</p>

<p><em><a href="Maxim_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Maxim</a></em> gave the PS2 and Xbox versions a score of eight out of ten and stated: "Gamers with short attention spans will likely find all the squad management tedious, but we think it adds a much-needed dimension to a very stale genre."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="wikilink">The Sydney Morning Herald</a></em> also gave the game four stars out of five, stating: "Enemies are intelligent, using cover effectively. Unfortunately, most encounters are overcome using the same method: laying suppressing fire and flanking."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> <em><a href="Detroit_Free_Press" title="wikilink">Detroit Free Press</a></em> gave the Xbox version three stars out of four and stated that it "could have been a four-star game, were it not for a couple of things that don't work well. You can press a button to give you an overhead view during missions. But instead of helping to advance the plot, the swirling, zooming view left me dizzy. And the enemy intelligence is set pretty low, meaning they don't pursue you with much cunning."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> </p>
