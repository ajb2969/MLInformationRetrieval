<h3 id="elections">Elections</h3>

<p>Manchin announced his intention to challenge incumbent <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">Democratic</a> Governor, <a href="Bob_Wise" title="wikilink">Bob Wise</a>, in the 2004 Democratic <a href="primary_election" title="wikilink">primary election</a> in May 2003. Wise decided not to seek re-election after a scandal, and Manchin won both the Democratic primary and general election by large margins. His election marked the first time that two people of the same political party followed one another in the West Virginia Governor's office since 1964. After the election, he was criticized in the press for using taxpayer funds to purchase 17 flat screen TVs for the Governors Mansion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Manchin won re-election to a second term as Governor in 2008, capturing 70 percent of the vote.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tenure">Tenure</h3>

<p> Manchin was a member of the <a href="National_Governors_Association" title="wikilink">National Governors Association</a>, the <a href="Southern_Governors'_Association" title="wikilink">Southern Governors' Association</a>, and the <a href="Democratic_Governors_Association" title="wikilink">Democratic Governors Association</a>. He was also chairman of the Southern States Energy Board, state's chair of the <a href="Appalachian_Regional_Commission" title="wikilink">Appalachian Regional Commission</a> and chairman of the Interstate Mining Compact Commission.</p>

<p>In July 2005, <a href="Massey_Energy" title="wikilink">Massey Energy</a> <a href="chief_executive_officer" title="wikilink">CEO</a> <a href="Don_Blankenship" title="wikilink">Don Blankenship</a> sued Manchin, alleging that Manchin had violated Blankenship's <a href="First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="wikilink">First Amendment</a> rights by threatening increased government scrutiny of his coal operations due to Blankenship's political activities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Blankenship had donated substantial funds into campaigns to defeat a proposed pension bond amendment and oppose the re-election of <a href="Supreme_Court_of_Appeals_of_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">state Supreme Court</a> Justice <a href="Warren_McGraw" title="wikilink">Warren McGraw</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and he fought against a proposed increase in the <a href="severance_tax" title="wikilink">severance tax</a> on extraction of mineral resources.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Soon after defeat of the pension bond amendment, the state Division of Environmental Protection (DEP) revoked a permit approval for controversial new <a href="silo" title="wikilink">silos</a> near Marsh Fork Elementary School in <a href="Raleigh_County,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Raleigh County</a>. While area residents had complained for some time that the coal operation there endangered their children, Blankenship claimed that the DEP acted in response to his opposition to the bond amendment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>During the <a href="2006_Sago_Mine_disaster" title="wikilink">Sago Mine disaster</a> of early January 2006 in <a href="Upshur_County,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Upshur County, West Virginia</a>, Manchin initially appeared to confirm incorrect reports that 12 miners had survived; in actuality only one survived. Manchin later acknowledged that an unintentional miscommunication had occurred with rescue teams within the mine. On February 1, 2006, he ordered a stop to all coal production in West Virginia, pending safety checks, after two more miners were killed in separate accidents.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> A total of 16 West Virginia coal miners died from mining accidents in early 2006. Manchin's overall handling of the Sago mine incident may have enhanced his popularity. In November 2006, <a class="uri" href="SurveyUSA" title="wikilink">SurveyUSA</a> ranked him as one of the most popular governors in the country with a 74 percent approval rating.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2007, a controversy arose after Manchin's daughter, <a href="Heather_Bresch" title="wikilink">Heather Manchin Bresch</a>, claimed to have earned an <a class="uri" href="MBA" title="wikilink">MBA</a> degree from <a href="West_Virginia_University" title="wikilink">West Virginia University</a> (WVU). However, after information emerged detailing the fallacy of the statement, Manchin placed the blame on WVU. In the wake of the controversy, WVU President Mike Garrison, Garrison's legal counsel and the Dean of the Business School resigned, amongst others. A panel was convened to fully investigate the measure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The issue hurt the credibility of the university, which placed pressure on the board to take action and remedy the situation. Bresch currently serves as CEO of <a href="Mylan_Inc." title="wikilink">Mylan Inc.</a>, the third largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturer in the U.S. with headquarters in Morgantown, WV adjacent to WVU campus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

</figure>

<p>Due to the declining health of U.S. Senator <a href="Robert_Byrd" title="wikilink">Robert Byrd</a>, speculation focused on what Manchin's response would be if Byrd died. The governor consistently refused to comment on the subject prior to Byrd's death, except for stating that he would not appoint himself to the position.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Byrd died on June 28, 2010,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and Manchin appointed <a href="Carte_Goodwin" title="wikilink">Carte Goodwin</a>, his 36-year-old legal adviser, on July 16.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

Manchin named Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis to be his chief of staff. Kofinis was formerly an adviser to <a href="Wesley_Clark" title="wikilink">Wesley Clark</a> and <a href="John_Edwards" title="wikilink">John Edwards</a>.

<p>In June 2011, Manchin joined Senator <a href="Charles_Schumer" title="wikilink">Charles Schumer</a> (D-NY) in seeking a crackdown on <a href="Bitcoin" title="wikilink">Bitcoin currency transactions</a>, saying that they facilitated <a href="illegal_drug_trade" title="wikilink">illegal drug trade</a> transactions. "The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] <a href="money_trail" title="wikilink">money trail</a> for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment," using an "'<a href="anonymity" title="wikilink">anonymizing</a> network' known as <a href="Tor_(anonymity_network)" title="wikilink">Tor</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> One opinion website said the Senators wanted "to disrupt [the] <a href="Silk_Road_(marketplace)" title="wikilink">Silk Road drug website</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="senior-citizens">Senior citizens</h4>

<p>To help locate missing senior citizens, Manchin introduced the <a href="Silver_Alert" title="wikilink">Silver Alert</a> Act in July 2011 to create a nationwide network for locating missing adults and senior citizens modeled after the <a href="AMBER_Alert" title="wikilink">AMBER Alert</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Manchin also sponsored the National Yellow Dot Act to create a voluntary program that would alert emergency services personnel responding to car accidents of the availability of personal and medical information on the car's owner.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="energy">Energy</h4>

<p>Manchin sits on the <a href="http://www.energy.senate.gov/public/">Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee</a> and supports a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy approach that uses coal.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Manchin's first bill in the Senate dealt with what he calls the EPA's overreach. After the EPA vetoed a previously-approved permit for the Spruce Mine in Logan County, West Virginia, Senator Manchin offered the "EPA Fair Play Act."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>The bill would "clarify and confirm the authority of the Environment Protection Agency to deny or restrict the use of defined areas as disposal sites for the discharge of dredged or filled material."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Manchin said the bill would prevent the agency from "changing its rules on businesses after permits have already been granted."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>On November 14, 2011, Manchin chaired his first-ever field hearing of that committee in Charleston, West Virginia, to focus on Marcellus Shale natural gas development and production.

We need to work together to chart a path forward in a safe and responsible way that lets us produce energy right here in America."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>Manchin supports building the <a href="http://www.transcanada.com/keystone.html">Keystone XL Pipeline</a> from Canada. Manchin has said, "It makes so much common sense that you want to buy [oil] off your friends and not your enemies." The pipeline would span over 2,000 miles across the United States.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p>On November 9, 2011, Manchin introduced the "Fair Compliance Act" with Senator Dan Coats (R-IN). Their bill would "lengthen timelines and establish benchmarks for utilities to comply with two major Environmental Protection Agency air pollution rules.

<p>Manchin introduced the "American Alternative Fuels Act" on May 10, 2011 with Senator John Barrasso (R-WY). The bill would remove restrictions to the development of alternative fuels, repeal part of the 2007 energy bill restricting the federal government from buying alternative fuels and encourages the development of algae-based fuels and synthetic natural gas. Regarding the bill, Manchin said, "Our unacceptably high gas prices are hurting not only West Virginians, but all Americans, and they underscore a critical need: the federal government needs to be a partner, not an obstacle, for businesses that can transform our domestic energy resources into gas."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="bipartisanship">Bipartisanship</h4>

<h4 id="afghanistan">Afghanistan</h4>

<p>On June 21, 2011, Manchin delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling for a "substantial and responsible reduction in the United States' military presence in Afghanistan." He said, "We can no longer afford to rebuild Afghanistan and America. We must choose. And I choose America."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>

<p>Manchin has introduced legislation to reduce the use of overseas service and security contractors. He successfully amended the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act to cap contractors' taxpayer funded salaries at $230,000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="gun-laws">Gun laws</h4>

<p>In 2012 Manchin's candidacy was endorsed by the <a href="National_Rifle_Association" title="wikilink">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA), who gave him an "A" rating.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Following the <a href="Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting" title="wikilink">Sandy Hook shooting</a>, Manchin partnered with Republican Senator <a href="Pat_Toomey" title="wikilink">Pat Toomey</a> to introduce a bill that would have strengthened background checks on gun sales. Though the legislation never acquired enough votes to win Senate passage, the NRA targeted him in an attack ad.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
<h3 id="coal-industry">Coal industry</h3>

<p>On October 6, 2010, Manchin directed a lawsuit aimed at overturning new federal rules concerning <a href="mountaintop_removal_mining" title="wikilink">mountaintop removal mining</a>. Filed by the state Department of Environmental Protection, the lawsuit "accuses U.S. EPA of overstepping its authority and asks the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to throw out the federal agency's new guidelines for issuing <a href="Clean_Water_Act" title="wikilink">Clean Water Act</a> permits for coal mines." In order to qualify for the permits, mining companies need to prove their projects would not cause the concentration of pollutants in the local water to rise 5 times past the normal level. <em><a href="The_New_York_Times" title="wikilink">The New York Times</a></em> reported that EPA Administrator <a href="Lisa_P._Jackson" title="wikilink">Lisa Jackson</a> said the new legislation would protect 95 percent of aquatic life by banning operators from dumping mine waste into streams.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<p>Manchin has received criticism from environmentalists due to his close family ties to the coal industry. He served as president of Energysystems in the late 1990s before becoming active in politics. On his financial disclosures in 2009 and 2010, his reported earnings from the company were $1,363,916 and $417,255 respectively.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> Critics have stated his opposition to health regulations that would raise expenses for the industry are due to his stake in the industry; Jim Sconyers, chairman of West Virginia‚Äôs <a href="Sierra_Club" title="wikilink">Sierra Club</a> chapter stated that "he‚Äôs been nothing but a mouthpiece for the coal industry his whole public life."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> However, opinions on the subject are mixed; <em><a href="The_Charleston_Gazette" title="wikilink">The Charleston Gazette</a></em> noted "the prospect that Manchin‚Äôs $1.7 million-plus in recent Enersystems earnings might tilt him even more strongly pro-coal might seem remote, given the deep economic and cultural connections that the industry maintains in West Virginia."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>In a lawsuit filed in July 2014, Dr. John Manchin II, one of Joe Manchin's brothers, sued Joe Manchin together with his other brother, Roch Manchin, over a $1.7 million loan.
