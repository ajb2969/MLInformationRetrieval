<p>The show took a one-year hiatus in 1985, during which the Smiths and their children Max and David starred in the family sitcom <em><a href="Me_&_Max" title="wikilink">Me & Max</a></em>. After that show ended its run, Steve and Morag revived <em>Smith & Smith</em> under the new title <em><a href="The_Comedy_Mill" title="wikilink">The Comedy Mill</a></em>. In 1991, Morag retired from performing and Steve launched his most famous series, <em><a href="The_Red_Green_Show" title="wikilink">The Red Green Show</a></em>. <a href="Red_Green_(character)" title="wikilink">Red Green</a> was originally created as a recurring character on <em>Smith & Smith</em>.</p>

<p>Each show also included a humorous musical number, performed in costume, focusing on a famous couple in history, as well as a mailbag segment. The latter was retained in <em><a href="The_Red_Green_Show" title="wikilink">The Red Green Show</a></em>, albeit in less earnest form.</p>
