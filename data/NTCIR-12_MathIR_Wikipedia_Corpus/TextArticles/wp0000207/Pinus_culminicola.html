<h1>Pinus culminicola</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Pinus culminicola</em></strong>, commonly known as <strong>Potosi pinyon</strong>, is a <a class="uri" href="pine" title="wikilink">pine</a> in the <a href="pinyon_pine" title="wikilink">pinyon pine</a> group, native and <a href="endemism" title="wikilink">endemic</a> to northeast <a class="uri" href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. The range is highly localised, confined to a small area of high summits in the northern <a href="Sierra_Madre_Oriental" title="wikilink">Sierra Madre Oriental</a> in <a class="uri" href="Coahuila" title="wikilink">Coahuila</a> and <a href="Nuevo_León" title="wikilink">Nuevo León</a>, and only abundant on the highest peak, <a href="Cerro_Potosí" title="wikilink">Cerro Potosí</a> (3713 m). It occurs at very high altitudes, from 3000-3700 m, in cool, moist subalpine climate conditions.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>It is a medium-size <a class="uri" href="shrub" title="wikilink">shrub</a>, reaching 1.5–5 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 25 cm. The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The <a href="leaf" title="wikilink">leaves</a> ('needles') are in fascicles of five, slender, 3–5.5 cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with <a class="uri" href="stomata" title="wikilink">stomata</a> confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces.</p>

<p>The <a href="conifer_cone" title="wikilink">cones</a> are globose, 3–4 cm long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16–18 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6–14 fertile scales. The cones open to 4–6 cm broad when mature, holding the <a href="seed" title="wikilink">seeds</a> on the scales after opening. The seeds are 9–12 mm long, with a thick shell, a white <a class="uri" href="endosperm" title="wikilink">endosperm</a>, and a vestigial 1–2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the <a href="Clark's_Nutcracker" title="wikilink">Clark's Nutcracker</a> and <a href="Mexican_Jay" title="wikilink">Mexican Jay</a>, which pluck the seeds out of the open cones. The jays, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, store many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Because of its isolation on a handful of remote mountain summits, Potosi pinyon escaped discovery until 1959. It differs from most other pinyon species in needle number, with 5 per fascicle, rather than 1–4, and in its consistently shrubby stature. It is most closely related to <a href="Johann's_pinyon" title="wikilink">Johann's pinyon</a> and <a href="Orizaba_pinyon" title="wikilink">Orizaba pinyon</a>, like them having the leaf stomata confined to the inner faces; it also differs from the latter in its smaller cones and seeds. Like these two, the white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive slow-growing shrub, suitable for small <a href="garden" title="wikilink">gardens</a>.</p>

<p>Like other pinyons, the <a href="pine_nut" title="wikilink">pine nut</a> seeds are edible, but the inaccessibility of the plants prevents significant collection for food.</p>
