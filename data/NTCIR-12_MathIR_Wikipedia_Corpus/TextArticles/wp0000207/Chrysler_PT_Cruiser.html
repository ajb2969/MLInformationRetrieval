<p>The <strong>Chrysler PT Cruiser</strong> is a <a href="retro_style" title="wikilink">retro styled</a> compact <a class="uri" href="automobile" title="wikilink">automobile</a> launched by <a href="Chrysler_(division)" title="wikilink">Chrysler</a> as a 5-door <a class="uri" href="hatchback" title="wikilink">hatchback</a> in early 2000 (for the 2001 <a href="model_year" title="wikilink">model year</a>) and as a 2-door <a href="convertible_(car)" title="wikilink">convertible</a> in early 2005 (added to the 2005 model lineup).</p>

<p>Originally conceived as a <a href="Plymouth_(automobile)" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a> model, the PT Cruiser received the Chrysler nameplate on introduction in anticipation of the 2001 discontinuation of the Plymouth brand. The PT Cruiser was designed by <a href="Bryan_Nesbitt" title="wikilink">Bryan Nesbitt</a>, who later also styled the <a href="Chevrolet_HHR" title="wikilink">Chevrolet HHR</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The name "PT Cruiser" includes the <a href="Acronym_and_initialism" title="wikilink">initialism</a> PT, standing for "Personal Transport" and designating the car's <a href="automobile_platform" title="wikilink">platform</a> as well as production code.</p>

<p>A four-seat convertible model was added for 2005. It is a two-door with an integrated "sport bar" for added rigidity and rollover protection. The sport bar also caused air to flow over the rear seat passengers. Convertible production ended December 21, 2007, but the last 2007 convertibles were marketed as 2008 models. On January 12, 2009, Chrysler LLC, under the private equity firm of <a href="Cerberus_Capital_Management" title="wikilink">Cerberus Capital Management</a>, announced the gradual discontinuation of the main model.</p>

<p>On July 6, 2009, after reorganization into the "New Chrysler", the company changed plans to discontinue the model by specifying that it will do so for Canadian and Mexican markets only. On July 9, 2010 the PT Cruiser ended production.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Worldwide production totaled 1.35 million units.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The PT Cruiser is a <a href="front-wheel_drive" title="wikilink">front-wheel drive</a> 5-passenger vehicle, classified as a truck in the U.S. by the <a href="National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="wikilink">NHTSA</a> for <a href="Corporate_Average_Fuel_Economy" title="wikilink">CAFE</a> <a href="fuel_economy_in_automobiles" title="wikilink">fuel economy</a> calculations but as a car by most other metrics. Chrysler specifically designed the PT Cruiser to fit the NHTSA criteria for a light truck in order to bring the average fuel efficiency of the company's light truck fleet into compliance with CAFE standards. A <a href="turbocharger" title="wikilink">turbocharged</a> GT model was introduced for the 2003 model year. A <a href="convertible_(car)" title="wikilink">convertible</a> was introduced for the 2005 model year.</p>

<p>The PT Cruiser was manufactured at <a href="Toluca_Car_Assembly" title="wikilink">Toluca Car Assembly</a> in <a class="uri" href="Toluca" title="wikilink">Toluca</a>, <a class="uri" href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexico</a>. On March 8, 2006, <a class="uri" href="DaimlerChrysler" title="wikilink">DaimlerChrysler</a> announced that it had built 1,000,000 PT Cruisers at the Toluca plant.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>  The PT Cruiser was also assembled at the <a href="EUROSTAR" title="wikilink">EUROSTAR Automobilwerk</a> in <a class="uri" href="Graz" title="wikilink">Graz</a>, <a class="uri" href="Austria" title="wikilink">Austria</a>, for global markets (outside North America) in 2002, using the production code PG. European PT Cruisers built in 2001 or from 2003 onwards were built in Mexico under the PT production code. The U.S. version came standard with a 2.4 L four-cylinder <a href="Four-stroke_cycle" title="wikilink">gasoline engine</a>. In addition to this standard model, a 2.2 L <a href="Inline-four_engine" title="wikilink">four-cylinder</a> <a href="diesel_engine" title="wikilink">diesel engine</a> built by <a href="Mercedes_Benz" title="wikilink">Mercedes Benz</a> was also available in Europe, Asia, and <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>. A 2.0 L engine (<a href="Chrysler_1.8,_2.0_&amp;_2.4_engine" title="wikilink">D4RE</a>) was also available outside the U.S. It produced  SAE at 6500 rpm with  of torque at 4800 rpm.  In July of 2000, the PT Cruiser replaced the <a href="Chrysler_Neon" title="wikilink">Neon</a> in Japan as their small car offering. Chrysler sold over 10,000 PT Cruisers in Japan, despite its high cost liability to Japanese consumers because the width measurements didn't comply with Japanese Government <a href="Vehicle_size_class#Japan" title="wikilink">dimension regulations</a> which Japanese consumers were liable for a yearly tax. Both the four door sedan and the two door convertible, and the GT turbo engine package were sold in Japan in right hand drive configurations. Japanese versions were manufactured at the Austrian factory and were equipped very similar to European specifications.</p>

<p>From 2002 until 2007, the PT Cruiser was used in the city of <a class="uri" href="Urayasu" title="wikilink">Urayasu</a>, <a href="Chiba_Prefecture" title="wikilink">Chiba Prefecture</a> by the Maihama Resort Cab company to serve as a taxi in the vicinity of <a href="Tokyo_Disneyland" title="wikilink">Tokyo Disneyland</a> because of its fun, retro appearance. Due to its use as a taxi, the annual <a href="Road_tax#Japan" title="wikilink">road tax</a> was not as expensive as private ownership. The PT Cruiser taxis augmented the <a href="Maihama_Resort_Line" title="wikilink">Maihama Resort Line</a> service to Tokyo Disneyland. Unfortunately, the PT Cruiser wasn't built for the rigors of taxi service, and the fleet became expensive to maintain, with eventual retirement in 2007. The PT Cruiser was offered in Japan until April 2010, when it was replaced by the <a href="Dodge_Caliber" title="wikilink">Dodge Caliber</a>.</p>

<p>In 2001 <em><a href="Car_and_Driver" title="wikilink">Car and Driver</a></em> acknowledged the PT Cruiser on its <a href="Car_and_Driver_Ten_Best" title="wikilink">Ten Best list</a> and the PT Cruiser also won the <a href="North_American_Car_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">North American Car of the Year</a>. In 2013, <a href="Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)" title="wikilink">Top Gear</a> named the PT Cruiser Convertible as the worst car of the last twenty years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The PT Cruiser was originally conceived as a <a href="Plymouth_(automobile)" title="wikilink">Plymouth</a> model, before Chrysler's merger with <a class="uri" href="Daimler-Benz" title="wikilink">Daimler-Benz</a>. At the time, Chrysler had planned a new look for Plymouth, previewed by the <a href="Plymouth_Prowler" title="wikilink">Plymouth Prowler</a> "<a href="hot_rod" title="wikilink">hot rod</a>". Styling cues from the Prowler, particularly the grille, were used to create the <a href="Plymouth_Pronto" title="wikilink">Plymouth Pronto</a> <a href="concept_car" title="wikilink">concept car</a> in 1997. The look was refined, and in 1998, another Plymouth concept called the <a href="Chrysler_Pronto_Cruizer" title="wikilink">Pronto Cruizer</a> directly previewed the styling of the PT Cruiser. The Pronto Cruizer was designed as a modern interpretation of the <a href="Chrysler_Airflow" title="wikilink">Chrysler Airflow</a> with <a href="Dodge_Neon" title="wikilink">Dodge Neon</a> components, but the final design used a separate platform. The new DaimlerChrysler firm did not have much faith in Plymouth as a separate entity, and began steps to rationalize and cancel the marque. Consequently, the PT Cruiser appeared in public only as a Chrysler.</p>

<p>The PT Cruiser also resembles the 1997 <a href="Chrysler_CCV" title="wikilink">Chrysler CCV</a> prototype – which would evolve into the styling of the PT Cruiser.</p>

<p>Intended to evoke an old gangster getaway car or a street rod based on a 1930s car, the 2000 PT Cruiser grew out of a collaboration among <a href="Robert_A._Lutz" title="wikilink">Robert A. Lutz</a>, who was an executive at Chrysler at the time, <a href="Bryan_Nesbitt" title="wikilink">Bryan Nesbitt</a>, a designer, as well as Dr. <a href="Clotaire_Rapaille" title="wikilink">Clotaire Rapaille</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>While the body style remained consistent from year to year, there were multiple versions of the PT Cruiser, designated by badges in the lower left hand corner of the rear lift-gate. Models included the Classic Edition, Limited Edition, Touring Edition, "Dream Cruiser", "Street Cruiser", "Pacific Coast Highway Edition" and PT Cruiser GT. Non-GT Turbo (180 hp) edition models (introduced in 2004) were identified by a "2.4L Turbo" badge on the lower right hand corner of the rear lift-gate. The GT model (introduced in 2003) has a "2.4L Turbo High Output" badge on the right hand corner of the lift-gate indicating the 215-230 hp engine version.</p>

<p>The PT Cruiser was updated for 2006 to include scalloped headlights, a new 'chrome' grille (that no longer extended below the "bumper"), new lower front fascia which eliminated the patented brake cooling ducts (US patent #6,315,091), available round fog lamps and redesigned taillights. Interior updates included an updated dash, new materials, and an analog clock to the center stack. The audio system featured a line-in jack for <a href="MP3_player" title="wikilink">MP3 players</a> integrated into the dash. The turbocharged 2.4 L <a href="Inline-four_engine" title="wikilink">four-cylinder engine</a> was available in  or "High-Output"  versions. A "<a class="uri" href="Mopar" title="wikilink">Mopar</a>" cruise control unit became available as an after market unit on 2007 models. Also in 2007, Chrysler dealers were permitted to order vehicles with separate options (un-bundled options from option packages) such as <a href="anti-lock_brakes" title="wikilink">anti-lock brakes</a> and Side Impact Airbags. <a href="Sirius_Satellite_Radio" title="wikilink">Sirius Satellite Radio</a> radio also became an option that could be installed as a dealer option with a factory appearance (i.e. roof mount satellite antenna).</p>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

<p>In 2002 <a href="Euro_NCAP" title="wikilink">Euro NCAP</a> gave the PT Cruiser a three (out of five) stars rating. The car received bad results in the frontal impact test (6 out of 16 possible points). Height of the seats and side airbags helped to attain a maximum score of 16 points in the side impact test. The low frontal scores are in part explained by the cushioning near the knees, designed to protect unbelted occupants, which is a factor in US safety regulations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>For 2009, the <a href="Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety" title="wikilink">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> gave the PT Cruiser the highest rating of <em>Good</em> overall for occupant protection in frontal crashes and the lowest overall rating of <em>Poor</em> for side crashes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> It was the only small car to earn <em>Poor</em> marks in both side and rear evaluations as well as the only small car to not offer <a href="electronic_stability_control" title="wikilink">electronic stability control</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="pt-cruiser-gt">PT Cruiser GT</h2>

<p>The <strong>PT Cruiser GT</strong> (also known as the GT Cruiser) is a high output <a class="uri" href="turbocharged" title="wikilink">turbocharged</a> variant of the PT Cruiser introduced as a 2003 model. Much like the Dodge Neon SRT-4, the PT Cruiser GT uses the same 2.4L turbocharged I4 engine. The engine is upgraded over the standard PT with improved cooling, oiling, an aluminum cylinder block with steel sleeves, and forged internals. The PT Cruiser GT is much more powerful than the standard model and has the potential to make significantly more power with available and relatively simple performance upgrades. Upgrades such as MOPAR Stage 1 and supporting turbo components are common. Most performance parts from the Dodge NEON SRT-4 are compatible with the PT Cruiser GT.</p>
