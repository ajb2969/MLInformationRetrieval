<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies</strong> (, abbreviated <em>ASE</em>) is a public <a class="uri" href="university" title="wikilink">university</a> in <a class="uri" href="Bucharest" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>, <a class="uri" href="Romania" title="wikilink">Romania</a>. Founded in 1913 as the <em>Academy of Higher-level Commercial and Industrial Studies</em> (<em>Academia de Înalte Studii Comerciale și Industriale</em> (AISCI)),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> it has become one of the largest higher education institutes in both Romania and South-Eastern Europe.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Established on 6 April 1913 by the <a href="Royal_Decree" title="wikilink">Royal Decree</a> of <a href="Carol_I_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Carol I of Romania</a>, the Academy of Higher-level Commercial and Industrial Studies was the first economic higher education institution established in Romania.</p>

<p>In 1947, the Academy was reorganised and merged with the Academy of Cooperative Studies to form the <em>Academy of Commercial and Cooperative Studies</em>. During the Communist Era, in August 1948, it turned into the <em>Institute for Economic Sciences and Planning</em>, according to the model provided by the Soviet higher education institutions.</p>

<p>During the 1967-1968 academic year, the Institute was reorganised again and became the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, a name which the university still holds today.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="institution">Institution</h2>

<p> The Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies has 22,684 students (undergraduate and graduate levels) in eleven faculties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The Academy has positioned itself as a research institution, hosting 13 centers of research acknowledged and endorsed by the National Council of Scientific Research in Higher Education.</p>

<p>A notable presence inside ASE is the Business Information Technology department (Romanian: Informatică Economică) which is an entity that promotes an educational philosophy based on combining economics and software development as a way of creating experts suitable for the <a href="Information_Age" title="wikilink">Information Age</a>.</p>
<h2 id="format-and-length-of-studies">Format and length of studies</h2>

<p>In the 70's and 80's Masters degrees in Economics were awarded to full-time students after 4 years of study, except for the Faculty of 'Cibernetics and Informatics', which required one additional year.</p>

<p>After 1990, Undergraduate studies at the Academy of Economic Studies ended with a <a href="Bachelor's_degree" title="wikilink">Bachelor's degree</a> in Economics, while acquiring a second specialization according to the department where they were enrolled. Up to 2005, undergraduate studies at the Academy of Economic Studies consisted of a four-year cycle (five-year cycle for the Faculty of 'Cibernetics and Informatics'). Master studies would continue for two more years, and doctoral programmed would normally be three years long.</p>

<p>Since 2005 however, the Academy has adopted the <a href="Bologna_declaration" title="wikilink">Bologna declaration</a> and undergraduate studies are now three-year long, followed by 2-year Master programmes. In this format, undergraduate studies finalize with a total of 180 credits, graduate programmes require a completion of 120 credits. The PhD programmes remain with a length of minimum three years.</p>
