<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The history of <strong>Portuguese Guyanese</strong> community relates directly with the end of <a class="uri" href="slavery" title="wikilink">slavery</a>. After the abolition of slavery in 1834, the planters of <a href="British_Guiana" title="wikilink">British Guiana</a> sought alternative sources of labour. They were eager to recruit white labourers in order to bolster the proportion of white to <a href="Colored" title="wikilink">coloured</a> residents in the colony.</p>

<p>In 1834, the first <a href="Portuguese_people" title="wikilink">Portuguese people</a> arrived from the <a href="Portugal" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a> island of <a class="uri" href="Madeira" title="wikilink">Madeira</a>, having been sponsored by a coalition of planters and by the colonial government. Between 1834 and 1882, some 30,645 Portuguese arrived in Guyana, the vast majority from Madeira, but others from the <a class="uri" href="Azores" title="wikilink">Azores</a> Islands. Mixed race Portuguese speaking elements from <a href="Cape_Verde" title="wikilink">Cape Verde</a> and <a class="uri" href="Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazil</a> also were brought in.</p>

<p>The Madeiran Portuguese, or simply <a href="Madeiran" title="wikilink">Madeirans</a> as they came to be known, soon shunned working in the fields given the high mortality rate due to tropical diseases. They settled in <a href="Georgetown,_Guyana" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a>, <a href="New_Amsterdam,_Guyana" title="wikilink">New Amsterdam</a> and other towns in Guyana and dedicated themselves into the venture of the retail and wholesale trades. By 1851, 173 out of 296 shops in Georgetown were Portuguese-owned, while the figure was 28 out of 52 in New Amsterdam. In 1891, Portuguese numbered 4.3% of the population of Guyana.</p>

<p>The Portuguese of Guiana faced considerable discrimination from both the <a href="Black_people" title="wikilink">black</a> <a href="Creole_peoples" title="wikilink">Creoles</a> and the <a href="white_British" title="wikilink">white British</a> ruling class. The former believed them to be opportunists and lackies of the white establishment while the latter considered the Portuguese inferior due to their <a class="uri" href="Catholic" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> and <a href="Mediterranean_race" title="wikilink">Mediterranean racial</a> roots. The Portuguese are <a href="White_people" title="wikilink">white</a>, but the white ruling class knew that, although the Portuguese were racially <a href="European_ethnic_groups" title="wikilink">European</a>, they were also indigent peasants from Madeira.</p>

<p>Tensions boiled over on a number of occasions and Georgetown experienced a spate of race riots, most notably in 1856 and 1898. On both occasions, disgruntled black Creoles directed their anger against Portuguese-owned shops and widespread looting occurred leading to damages of over $30,000 and over $200,000 respectively.</p>

<p>Eventually, although the Portuguese were called by the British as inferior, the Portuguese were given more privileges by other whites and assimilated becoming part of Guyanese society. They <a href="Anglicisation" title="wikilink">anglicized</a> their surnames and began to speak <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> as their primary language. However, during the struggle for independence, the Portuguese came to be identified with the British colonial establishment while the ethnic <a class="uri" href="Indo-Guyanese" title="wikilink">Indo-Guyanese</a> and <a class="uri" href="Afro-Guyanese" title="wikilink">Afro-Guyanese</a> fought over power. The 1964 killing of the civil servant <a href="Arthur_Abraham" title="wikilink">Arthur Abraham</a>, an ethnic Portuguese, led many to emigrate before Britain introduced restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>

<p>Many Portuguese Guyanese now live in <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a class="uri" href="Toronto" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>, other parts of the Caribbean and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Today they make up a small percent of the population of the country, and are demanding that they should be called Europeans. There may be a little bit higher birthrate among them in present.</p>

<p>Some have advanced the idea that the Portuguese presence in the Guianas predates 1834. Portuguese <a class="uri" href="Sephardic" title="wikilink">Sephardic</a> Jews had settled in neighbouring <a href="Surinam_(Dutch_colony)" title="wikilink">Dutch Guiana</a> in the 17th century before the Dutch arrived. <a href="Spanish_and_Portuguese_Jews" title="wikilink">Portuguese Jewish</a> communities also exist in <a class="uri" href="Aruba" title="wikilink">Aruba</a>, <a class="uri" href="Barbados" title="wikilink">Barbados</a> and <a class="uri" href="Curaçao" title="wikilink">Curaçao</a>. Some of the Portuguese in Guyana may have their origins in these Dutch-speaking Portuguese groups. They were known as the "Curaçao Portuguese" within the larger Portuguese community.</p>

<p>The number of Portuguese Guyanese (4.3% of the population in 1891) has been declining constantly over the decades.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Another riot between Portuguese and Africans occurred in 1889 when a Portuguese was set free after killing his coloured wife. He was set free not long after a coloured man was hanged for killing his Portuguese wife. The Africans and the coloured people saw this as discrimination against them, so they attacked the Portuguese shops and stalls, after a rumour had started that a Portuguese shopkeeper had murdered an African boy.</p>
