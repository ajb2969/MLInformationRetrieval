<h1>Frederick Traugott Pursh</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Frederick Traugott Pursh</strong> (or Friedrich Traugott Pursch) (February 4, 1774 – July 11, 1820) was a <a href="German_people" title="wikilink">German</a>–<a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a class="uri" href="botanist" title="wikilink">botanist</a>.</p>

<p>Born in <a class="uri" href="Großenhain" title="wikilink">Großenhain</a>, <a class="uri" href="Saxony" title="wikilink">Saxony</a>, under the name Friedrich Traugott Pursh, he was educated at <a href="Dresden_Botanical_Gardens" title="wikilink">Dresden Botanical Gardens</a>, and emigrated to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> in 1799. From 1802 to 1805, he worked in <a class="uri" href="Philadelphia" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a> as the botanical manager of the extensive gardens of William Hamilton, Esq., "<a href="The_Woodlands_(Philadelphia)" title="wikilink">The Woodlands</a>." By 1805, he was working for <a href="Benjamin_Smith_Barton" title="wikilink">Benjamin Smith Barton</a> on a new <a href="Flora_(publication)" title="wikilink">flora</a> of <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, under whom he studied the plants collected on the <a href="Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition" title="wikilink">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>. is work with Barton allowed him to travel farther afield. In 1805, he traveled south from <a class="uri" href="Maryland" title="wikilink">Maryland</a> to the Carolinas and, in 1806, he traveled north from the mountains of <a class="uri" href="Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania</a> to <a href="New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a>. He made both trips principally on foot, with only his dog and a gun, covering over three thousand miles each season.</p>

<p>Barton's proposed flora was never written, but Pursh, who then moved to <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>, <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>, did make a major contribution to North American botany in his <em>; or A Systematic Arrangement and Description of The Plants of North America</em> (variously dated as published in 1813 or 1814). He then returned to America, moving to <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a> in 1816. He botanized a great deal in <a class="uri" href="Quebec" title="wikilink">Quebec</a>, but all the material he accumulated was destroyed by fire before it could be organized into suitable form for publication. His hopes of carrying out further major work were prevented by ill health due to <a class="uri" href="alcoholism" title="wikilink">alcoholism</a>.</p>

<p>He was so destitute when he died in <a class="uri" href="Montreal" title="wikilink">Montreal</a> that his funeral expenses had to be defrayed by his friends. His remains lay in the Papineau Road cemetery until 1857, when they were moved to the <a href="Mount_Royal_Cemetery" title="wikilink">Mount Royal Cemetery</a>. A proper monument was paid for by subscription. It read as follows:</p>
