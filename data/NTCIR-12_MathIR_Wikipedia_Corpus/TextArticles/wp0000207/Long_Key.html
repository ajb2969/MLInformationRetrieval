<p><strong>Long Key</strong> is an island in the middle <a href="Florida_Keys" title="wikilink">Florida Keys</a>. Long Key was called Cayo Vivora (Rattlesnake Key) by early Spanish explorers, a reference to the shape of the island, which resembles a snake with its jaws open, rather than to its denizens. The city of <a href="Layton,_Florida" title="wikilink">Layton</a> is located on Long Key. The  state park (3.9 km²) was dedicated October 1, 1969.</p>
