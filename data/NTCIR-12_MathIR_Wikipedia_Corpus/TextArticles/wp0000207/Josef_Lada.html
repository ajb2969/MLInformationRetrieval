<p>Born in the small village of Hrusice in a cobbler's family, he went to Prague at the age of 14 to become an apprentice binder. Entirely self-taught, he created his own style as a caricaturist for newspapers, and later as an illustrator. He produced landscapes, created frescoes and designed costumes for plays and films. Over the years he created a series of paintings and drawings depicting traditional Czech occupations, and wrote and illustrated the adventures of <em>Mikeš</em>, a little black cat who could talk.</p>

<p>Lada produced nearly 600 cartoons of the Švejk characters, depicting <a class="uri" href="Austria-Hungary" title="wikilink">Austria-Hungary</a> officers and civil servants as incompetent, abusive and often drunk.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> All subsequent editions of Švejk used Lada's illustrations, except for the 2008/2009 Czech edition illustrated by Petr Urban.</p>
