<h1>Katmandu (comics)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Katmandu</em></strong> is a <a href="Furry_fandom" title="wikilink">furry</a> <a href="comic_book" title="wikilink">comic book</a> set in a fantasy world populated by <a class="uri" href="anthropomorphic" title="wikilink">anthropomorphic</a> <a href="felidae" title="wikilink">feline</a> and <a class="uri" href="rodent" title="wikilink">rodent</a> species. It was created by <a href="Carole_Curtis" title="wikilink">Carole Curtis</a> and originally drawn by <a href="Terrie_Smith" title="wikilink">Terrie Smith</a> and is one of two key titles published by <a href="Shanda_Fantasy_Arts" title="wikilink">Shanda Fantasy Arts</a> — along with the publisher's namesake <em>Shanda the Panda</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The original story introduced the framing story characters, Leahtrah and Thorin. They were members of warring cat nations; loosely modeled as the equivalent of the <a href="Arab-Israeli_conflict" title="wikilink">Arab-Israeli conflict</a> in the <a href="Middle_East" title="wikilink">Middle East</a> after World War II. That first story arc involves their adventures in the desert which lead to them falling in love and marrying.</p>

<p>However, the primary focus of the series is the stories Leahtrah tells about her ancestor, Liska. Liska was a noted warrior chief who was first captured in a raid and kept as a slave. She is based loosely on <a href="Woman_Chief" title="wikilink">Woman Chief</a> the Absaroka Amazon, of the <a href="Crow_Nation" title="wikilink">Crow</a> <a href="Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Native American</a> nation. Reviews have praised the book for its presentation of a detailed fictional setting and its characterization.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
