<h3 id="clarke-institute-of-psychiatry">Clarke Institute of Psychiatry</h3>

<p> <a href="Centre_for_Addiction_and_Mental_Health_(College_Street_site)" title="wikilink">The hospital</a> was founded in 1966 and named the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, after <a href="Charles_Kirk_Clarke" title="wikilink">Charles Kirk Clarke</a>, a pioneer in mental health in Canada.</p>

<h3 id="addiction-research-foundation">Addiction Research Foundation</h3>

<p>The Addiction Research Foundation (ARF), then named the Alcoholism Research Foundation was founded in 1949, when H.

His mandate was to determine the scope of alcoholism in Ontario. He was named executive director when ARF opened and remained in that post until 1976. Focusing initially on outpatient treatment, their first facility was <a href="Brookside_Hospital" title="wikilink">Brookside Hospital</a> in 1951, expanding to branch offices and new locations in 1954, the same year they set up in-house research.

In 1978 ARF opened the <a href="School_for_Addiction_Studies" title="wikilink">School for Addiction Studies</a> and expanded their international role in policy development and research.
