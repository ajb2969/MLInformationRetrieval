<h1>Strake Jesuit College Preparatory</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Strake Jesuit College Preparatory</strong> (commonly referred to as Strake Jesuit or simply Strake) is a <a class="uri" href="Jesuit" title="wikilink">Jesuit</a>, <a href="college-preparatory_school" title="wikilink">college-preparatory school</a> for males, grades 9-12, in the <a href="Chinatown,_Houston" title="wikilink">Chinatown</a> area and in the <a href="Greater_Sharpstown" title="wikilink">Greater Sharpstown</a> district of <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston, Texas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is located in proximity to <a href="Alief,_Houston" title="wikilink">Alief</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>With over 900 students, it is the largest <a href="Catholicism" title="wikilink">Catholic</a> high school in Houston. It boasts a large collection of art installed around the campus, both inside and out. Its collection is so extensive that the <a href="City_of_Houston" title="wikilink">City of Houston</a> has classified the campus as an art museum<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> for which the school maintains a full-time curator. The school is located within the <a href="Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Galveston-Houston" title="wikilink">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston</a>. It is one of only two private schools in Texas that are members of the <a href="University_Interscholastic_League" title="wikilink">University Interscholastic League</a> (the other being <a href="Dallas_Jesuit" title="wikilink">Dallas Jesuit</a>), which allows it to compete athletically against the largest public schools.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The school was founded by Father Michael Kenelley, S.J.,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> on June 21, 1960, in land donated by Frank Sharp on what was then the undeveloped, west side of Houston.</p>

<p>During a three-year period until 1993, the number of applications submitted to Strake Jesuit doubled. Father Brian Zinnamon, the school President, said during the year that there were two times the number of applicants compared to available spots. At the time, tuition was $4,700 per year, described by Stephanie Asin of the <em><a href="Houston_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Houston Chronicle</a></em> as being steep.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Father Zinnamon said, "Certainly what is going on in the public schools is a factor. Parents are choosing a safe environment where they know their children are getting Christian values."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="athletics">Athletics</h2>

<p>The "Fighting Crusaders" were one of many Catholic high schools that originally competed in the now defunct T.C.I.L. (Texas Christian Interscholastic League) The league began in 1935 under the direction of Albert Mitchell (then principal of <a href="Central_Catholic_Marianist_High_School" title="wikilink">Central Catholic</a>, <a href="San_Antonio" title="wikilink">San Antonio</a>) Strake Jesuit's last year of competition in the T.C.I.L. concluded when the league came to a close in the 1999-2000 athletic season with the baseball team capturing the final T.C.I.L State Championship in any sport. In the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2003, the Crusaders competed as an independent in all sports until their admission into the University Interscholastic League (U.I.L.). They began competing in their listed district of 19-5A in the fall of 2003. The Crusader's own numerous District, Regional and State Championships in their various sports that date back from over the past 50 years in their old league. The Crusaders also won several District and Regional Championships along with a State Championship, State runners-up and State semi-finalists within the past eight years in the U.I.L. The "Fighting Crusaders" athletic department provides 13 different programs which include: Baseball, Basketball, Cross-Country, Football, Golf, Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer, Swimming &amp; Diving, Tennis, Track &amp; Field, Water Polo, and Wrestling.</p>
<h3 id="rivalry">Rivalry</h3>

<p>Despite moving to the U.I.L., Strake Jesuit still maintains its rivalry with <a href="St._Thomas_High_School_(Houston,_Texas)" title="wikilink">Saint Thomas High School</a> (STH). Since 1964 Strake has a record of 23-26-1 against STH.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Another less noted rivalry is the one between Strake and Dallas Jesuit. Since 1970 Strake has gone 10-14 against <a href="Dallas_Jesuit" title="wikilink">Dallas Jesuit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cross-country-track">Cross Country / Track</h3>

<p>The Cross Country Team won 22 straight TCIL State titles starting in 1972.</p>
<h2 id="spiritual-life">Spiritual Life</h2>
<h3 id="retreats">Retreats</h3>

<p>All students and members of faculty and staff take part in a <a href="Retreat_(spiritual)" title="wikilink">retreat</a> at some point during the school year. Apart from taking part in their own retreat, many teachers are involved in retreats for students.</p>

<p>Freshmen participate in a three day retreat, led by juniors and seniors who spend several months in preparation. Sophomores are responsible for the 'nuts and bolts' dimension of the retreat such as errands, meals and cleaning. Freshmen gather in homes, spend a night at school, visit <a href="nursing_homes" title="wikilink">nursing homes</a> and engage in various activities designed to promote spiritual growth and class bonding.</p>

<p>Sophomores take part in a retreat with their fathers or father-figures. The purpose of the sophomore retreat is to develop the relationship between father and son as well as the <a href="Christian_spirituality" title="wikilink">spirituality</a> of the student.</p>

<p>Juniors have a choice of retreat. One is a three day retreat experience, the first day of which is spent with the disadvantaged members of the Houston area. Afterwards, juniors spend two days reflecting on the experience, upon the brokenness of the world, and how <a class="uri" href="Christ" title="wikilink">Christ</a> may or may not be present in the poorest. Another option is the prayer-styles retreat, which was begun in 1996 after requests from students over 2–3 years. During this three day residential retreat, juniors discover and experience a variety of prayer methods such as <a class="uri" href="meditation" title="wikilink">meditation</a>, praying with music, through nature, the <a class="uri" href="psalms" title="wikilink">psalms</a> and using such things as play-dough as creative prayer.</p>

<p>Seniors participate in the four day Kairos Retreat, during which they, together with faculty, share their lives particularly those moments when they have experienced <a href="God_the_Father" title="wikilink">God</a>, emptiness, joy, pain or healing. The purpose is for students to see how <a href="God_the_Holy_Spirit" title="wikilink">the Spirit of God</a> is present in all aspects of life. There is a special session of this retreat held each year that is also open to juniors, often referred to as "Junior Kairos".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="community-service">Community Service</h3>

<p>Catholicism embraces a preferential option for the poor, and the <a href="Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church" title="wikilink">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a> states that a healthy spirituality is expressed in a concern for the social aspects of life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Strake Jesuit embraces this concept, and was one of the first Catholic schools in Texas to require its students to engage in community service in order to graduate.</p>

<p>Freshmen visit nursing homes, sophomores collect Christmas gifts for underprivileged children, juniors engage in various projects and seniors are required to spend 100 hours of <a href="community_service" title="wikilink">community service</a> in such places as soup kitchens, camps for special needs children and missions abroad. Seniors are also required to produce a reflection paper on the experience.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>The Strake Jesuit website states: <em>Strake Jesuit College Preparatory is grounded in the conviction of St. <a href="Ignatius_of_Loyola" title="wikilink">Ignatius of Loyola</a> that God is to be found in all things. All activities of the school, from biology to band, from football to forensics, have this objective: to find God in all of God's wondrous creation.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> It is the declared goal of the Pastoral Department to foster this aim.</p>
