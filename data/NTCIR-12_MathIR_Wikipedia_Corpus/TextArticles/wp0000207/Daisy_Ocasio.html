<p><strong>Daisy Ocasio</strong> (born November 3, 1964) is a well known <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rican</a> athlete. A participant of <a href="Marathon_(sport)" title="wikilink">Marathon</a> and <a href="Track_and_Field" title="wikilink">Track and Field</a> races, she is also a former <a href="Women's_boxing" title="wikilink">female boxer</a>.</p>

<p>Ocasio was born in <a href="Vega_Baja,_Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Vega Baja</a>, to the north coast of <a href="Puerto_Rico" title="wikilink">Puerto Rico</a>. Although she and <a href="Ossie_Ocasio" title="wikilink">Ossie Ocasio</a> shared one <a href="sports" title="wikilink">sport</a>, <a class="uri" href="boxing" title="wikilink">boxing</a>, it is not known whether the two have a family connection.</p>

<p>Daisy Ocasio had an accomplished career in the running fields, holding various records at different international races. In 1991, she participated as a Track and Field runner at the <a href="Havana,_Cuba" title="wikilink">Havana, Cuba</a> <a href="Pan_American_Games" title="wikilink">Pan American Games</a>. She also participated at various <a href="Olympic_Games" title="wikilink">Olympics</a>.</p>

<p>Ocasio's photos were commonly seen on Puerto Rican newspapers during the early 1990s, when she was at the top of her career as a runner. She continued on running, and winning races, until the late 1990s. Many Puerto Ricans came to identify her, just as they did with <a href="Angelita_Lind" title="wikilink">Angelita Lind</a> during the 1980s, as one of the most important runners of Puerto Rico. That's why, when she announced she would become a female boxer, she caused some shock among many of her fans.</p>

<p>On July 23, 1998, she debuted as a boxer, defeating <a href="Andrea_Figueroa" title="wikilink">Andrea Figueroa</a> by a <a class="uri" href="knockout" title="wikilink">knockout</a> in round two at Vega Baja. Only nineteen days later, she beat <a href="Lizette_Pizarro" title="wikilink">Lizette Pizarro</a> by a knockout in the first round, also in her hometown.</p>

<p>On November 7 of that year, she beat <a href="Marischa_Sjau" title="wikilink">Marischa Sjau</a>, in <a href="Lake_Worth,_Florida" title="wikilink">Lake Worth, Florida</a>, to mark her <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> debut. By then, she had moved to <a class="uri" href="Florida" title="wikilink">Florida</a> to <a href="Boxing_training" title="wikilink">train</a>.</p>

<p>On March 3, 1999, she beat <a href="Pamela_Clarke" title="wikilink">Pamela Clarke</a>, by then considered a top fighter, by a knockout in three rounds at Miami. Then, on December 8 came what could be considered as her best victory: facing future world champion <a href="Patricia_Demick" title="wikilink">Patricia Demick</a> of <a class="uri" href="Chile" title="wikilink">Chile</a>, Ocasio won by a six round unanimous decision.</p>

<p>On April 15, 2004, in what would turn out to be her last fight, she was knocked out by future world champion <a href="Britt_Van_Buskirk" title="wikilink">Britt Van Buskirk</a>, in <a href="Temecula,_California" title="wikilink">Temecula, California</a>.</p>

<p>She retired from women's boxing with a record of five wins and one loss, with three knockout wins.</p>

<p>Currently in her 40s, Ocasio now leads a relatively quiet life, and has returned to live full-time in Puerto Rico.</p>
