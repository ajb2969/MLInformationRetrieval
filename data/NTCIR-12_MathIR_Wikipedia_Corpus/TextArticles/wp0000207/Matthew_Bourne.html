<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Matthew Bourne was born in <a href="Hackney,_London" title="wikilink">Hackney, London</a>, England, in 1960. He went to William Fitt and Sir George Monoux School in <a class="uri" href="Walthamstow" title="wikilink">Walthamstow</a>, London. From the ages of 14 to 16 he was an avid autograph hunter, attending most West End opening nights and waiting outside Stage Doors and top London hotels. In 1978 he left full-time education and worked in various jobs at the BBC (filing clerk), Keith Prowse Theatre Agents (selling theatre tickets) and The National Theatre (bookshop and ushering). Despite having never done a dance class, he ran and directed various amateur Dance Companies in his teenage years. In 1982 he enrolled at the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance (now <a href="Trinity_Laban_Conservatoire_of_Music_and_Dance" title="wikilink">Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance</a>) in <a class="uri" href="Deptford" title="wikilink">Deptford</a>, southeast London, where he was awarded a BA in Dance Theatre. For his final year (1986) he danced with the Laban Centre's Transitions Dance Company. After graduation he formed the dance company, Adventures in Motion Pictures (AMP), with fellow directors, and friends, Emma Gladstone and David Massingham. Bourne has worked as a professional choreographer and director since 1987, becoming sole artistic director of AMP in 1991 and New Adventures in 2002. He now lives in Islington, London and Brighton, East Sussex.</p>
<h2 id="choreographer">Choreographer</h2>

He has been said to be the most audience-conscious artist. He does not go into detail about his works because he wants the audience to have their own interpretations.</p>

<p>Bourne started training as a dancer at the relatively late age of 22. He studied Dance Theatre and Choreography at <a href="Laban_(college)" title="wikilink">Laban</a>, graduating in 1985 but spending a further year with the college's performance company Transitions. He danced professionally for 14 years, creating many roles in his own work. In 1999 he gave his final performance, playing The Private Secretary in the Broadway production of <em>Swan Lake</em>.</p>

<p>In 2007 Bourne was contemplating a gay version of <em><a href="Romeo_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>. Despite the success of his <em>Swan Lake</em>, in which he altered the traditional story to be about a human male falling in love with a male swan, Bourne acknowledged the challenge of a gay <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. "It's more to do with dancing than with sexuality," he said "A male dancer, whether gay or straight, fits into a relationship with a female partner very happily. It's something you're taught, and it fits, it feels right, the lifting and all that stuff. Getting away from that, making a convincing love duet, a romantic, sexual duet, for two men that is comfortable to do and comfortable to watch–I don't know if you can. I've never seen it done."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>His latest hit show for New Adventures, <em>Dorian Gray</em>, based on Oscar Wilde’s gothic masterpiece, premiered at the 2008 Edinburgh Festival, and became the most successful dance production in the Festival’s 62-year history. Later in 2008 he co-directed and choreographed <a href="Cameron_Mackintosh" title="wikilink">Cameron Mackintosh</a>'s latest revival of <em>Oliver!</em> with <a href="Rowan_Atkinson" title="wikilink">Rowan Atkinson</a>, which is currently playing at London's <a href="Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane" title="wikilink">Drury Lane Theatre</a>. In 2010, New Adventures Performed an adaptation of William Golding's Lord of the Flies, it was put together in 3 weeks of rehearsing, and was performed in The Theatre Royal in Glasgow.</p>
