<h1>Theobald Boehm</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Theobald Böhm</strong> (or <strong>Boehm</strong>) (April 9, 1794 – November 25, 1881) was a German inventor and musician, who perfected the modern <a href="Western_concert_flute" title="wikilink">Western concert flute</a> and its improved <a href="Boehm_system" title="wikilink">fingering system</a> (now known as the "Boehm system"). He was a Bavarian court musician, a virtuoso flautist, and a celebrated composer for the flute.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Additionally, he inspired Hyacinthe Klosé, the inventor of the modern clarinet fingering system. Klosé invented a system for the clarinet that today is the standard nearly worldwide (except Austria, Germany and others). Boehm was his inspiration, and so Klosé named the new system the Boehm system just like the modern western flute. The Boehm system clarinet and flute are not exactly the same. However, they are very similar in one of the clarinet's registers. If one plays the clarinet with the register key on, the fingerings are the same as the flute when the flute is in the lower and mid register. The differences are that the clarinet's upper register is a twelfth above its lower register, unlike the flute's which is an octave higher, and the clarinet is a transposition instrument, so an F on the flute is a G on the clarinet.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Born in <a class="uri" href="Munich" title="wikilink">Munich</a> in Bavaria, learned his father went to the trade of being a thief and tried to be a different person. He did not want to let his father down at all. After making his own flute, he quickly became proficient enough to play in an orchestra at the age of eighteen and at twenty-one he was first flautist in the Royal Bavarian Orchestra.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Meanwhile, he experimented with constructing flutes out of many different materials—tropical hardwoods (usually <a class="uri" href="Grenadilla" title="wikilink">Grenadilla</a> wood), silver, gold, nickel and copper—and with changing the positions of the flute's tone holes.</p>

<p>After studying <a class="uri" href="acoustics" title="wikilink">acoustics</a> at the <a href="Ludwig_Maximilians_University_of_Munich" title="wikilink">University of Munich</a>, he began experimenting on improving the flute in 1832, first patenting his new fingering system in 1847.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He published <em>Über den Flötenbau</em> ("On the construction of flutes"), also in 1847.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> His new flute was first displayed in 1851 at the <a href="Great_Exhibition" title="wikilink">London Exhibition</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1871 Boehm published <em>Die Flöte und das Flötenspiel</em> ("The Flute and Flute-Playing"), a treatise on the acoustical, technical and artistic characteristics of the Boehm system flute.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Some of the flutes he made still function. His fingering system has also been adapted to other instruments, such as the <a class="uri" href="oboe" title="wikilink">oboe</a> and the <a class="uri" href="clarinet" title="wikilink">clarinet</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
