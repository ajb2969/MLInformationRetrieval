<p>Schneider called his Peace Corps service "the most illuminating, rewarding and exhausting period of my life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I saw the constant struggle to survive in the developing world -- children without enough to eat, mothers without access to health care, fathers unable to find work to earn the income to care for their families."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Returning from the Peace Corps, Schneider earned a <a href="Master's_degree" title="wikilink">Master's degree</a> in <a href="political_science" title="wikilink">political science</a> from <a href="San_José_State_University" title="wikilink">San Jose State</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

From the Honorable R. Sargent Shriver to Loret Ruppe and Senator Paul Coverdell to Carol Bellamy and my immediate predecessor, Mark Gearan, there is an enormous legacy to which I pledge to contribute to the best of my ability," Schneider added.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Schneider was the second returned Volunteer (El Salvador, 1966–1968) to head the agency and the first practicing <a class="uri" href="Jew" title="wikilink">Jew</a> to head the agency.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Schneider credits his parents and their Jewish values with motivating him to join the Peace Corps.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> "I actually do think that the ethics and values that come out of my religious background are reflected in what the Peace Corps does and what the Peace Corps is," Schneider said.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="digital-peace-corps">Digital Peace Corps</h3>

<h3 id="expansion-of-the-peace-corps">Expansion of the Peace Corps</h3>

<p>On July 25, 2007 Schneider testified before Senator <a href="Chris_Dodd" title="wikilink">Chris Dodd</a>'s Senate Subcommittee in support of the Peace Corps Volunteer Empowerment Act and said he was convinced the new legislation contained three critical elements that would enable the Peace Corps to double in size to 15,000 Volunteers by the time it celebrates its 50th anniversary on 1 March 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> "Those elements are first, authorizing the necessary funds; second, empowering Volunteers which will mean better management, improved programming and site selection, safer and more satisfied Volunteers and third, removal of financial, medical, and bureaucratic obstacles to recruiting senior Volunteers," said Schneider.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="situation-in-pakistan">Situation in Pakistan</h3>

<p>In an Op-ed piece in the August 15, 2007 issue of the <em>Boston Globe</em>, "Getting answers on Pakistan," Schneider argued that time is running out on the military dictatorship in Pakistan and that the United States can either support a return to democracy or sit on the sidelines and watch Pakistan slide in chaos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> "If Bhutto and Sharif are not allowed to participate in October's election, their mainstream moderate parties will be further alienated, leaving the political field open to Islamist forces," said Schneider.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> "The Pakistani people have registered their desire for a democratic transition with street protests, which have been met by guns and gas. This increasingly vocal opposition, spearheaded by the bar associations, human rights groups, and the media, is channeling public resentment to military rule," Schneider added.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-activities">Other activities</h2>

<p>On November 29, 2007 the State Department announced that Schneider had joined the Democracy Network, a network of former government officials, academics and members of nongovernmental organizations created to help <a href="Latin_America" title="wikilink">Latin American</a> and <a class="uri" href="Caribbean" title="wikilink">Caribbean</a> nations deal with issues related to promoting and defending democracy in the region.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The network will advise governments issues like electoral and constitutional reform, access to justice, good governance, citizen participation, transparency and efforts to combat corruption.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
