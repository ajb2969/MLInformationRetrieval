<h1>Horn (anatomy)</h1>
<hr/>

<p>   A <strong>horn</strong> is a pointed projection on the head of various animals consisting of a covering of <a class="uri" href="keratin" title="wikilink">keratin</a> and other <a href="protein" title="wikilink">proteins</a> surrounding a core of live <a class="uri" href="bone" title="wikilink">bone</a>. In mammals, true horns are found mainly among the <a class="uri" href="ruminant" title="wikilink">ruminant</a> <a href="artiodactyl" title="wikilink">artiodactyls</a>, in the families <a class="uri" href="Antilocapridae" title="wikilink">Antilocapridae</a> (<a class="uri" href="pronghorn" title="wikilink">pronghorn</a>) and <a class="uri" href="Bovidae" title="wikilink">Bovidae</a> (<a class="uri" href="cattle" title="wikilink">cattle</a>, <a href="goat" title="wikilink">goats</a>, <a class="uri" href="antelope" title="wikilink">antelope</a> etc.).</p>

<p>One pair of horns is usual; however, two or more pairs occur in a few wild species and <a href="Domestication" title="wikilink">domesticated</a> breeds of sheep. Polycerate (multi-horned) sheep breeds include the <a href="Hebridean_(sheep)" title="wikilink">Hebridean</a>, <a href="Icelandic_sheep" title="wikilink">Icelandic</a>, <a href="Jacob_(sheep)" title="wikilink">Jacob</a>, <a href="Manx_Loaghtan" title="wikilink">Manx Loaghtan</a>, and the <a href="Navajo-Churro_sheep" title="wikilink">Navajo-Churro</a>.</p>

<p>Horns usually have a curved or <a class="uri" href="spiral" title="wikilink">spiral</a> shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth, and continue to grow throughout the life of the animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called <em>scurs</em>. Similar growths on other parts of the body are not usually called horns, but <a href="Spur_(zoology)" title="wikilink">spurs</a>, <a href="claw" title="wikilink">claws</a> or <a href="hoof" title="wikilink">hoofs</a> depending on the part of the body on which they occur.</p>
<h2 id="other-hornlike-growths">Other hornlike growths</h2>

<p>The term "horn" is also popularly applied to other hard and pointed features attached to the head of animals in various other families:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="Giraffidae" title="wikilink">Giraffidae</a>: <a href="Giraffe" title="wikilink">Giraffes</a> have one or more pairs of bony bumps on their heads, called <a href="ossicone" title="wikilink">ossicones</a>. These are covered with furred skin.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Cervidae" title="wikilink">Cervidae</a>: Most <a class="uri" href="deer" title="wikilink">deer</a> have <a href="antler" title="wikilink">antlers</a>, which are not true horns. When fully developed, antlers are dead bone without a horn or skin covering; they are borne only by adults (usually males, except for <a class="uri" href="reindeer" title="wikilink">reindeer</a>) and are shed and regrown each year.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Rhinocerotidae" title="wikilink">Rhinocerotidae</a>: The <a href="rhinoceros_horn" title="wikilink">"horns" of rhinoceroses</a> are made of <a class="uri" href="keratin" title="wikilink">keratin</a>, the same substance as fingernails, and grow continuously, but do not have a bone core.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Chamaeleonidae" title="wikilink">Chamaeleonidae</a>: Many <a class="uri" href="chameleons" title="wikilink">chameleons</a>, most notably the <a href="Jackson's_Chameleon" title="wikilink">Jackson's Chameleon</a>, possess horns on their skulls, and have a keratin covering.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Ceratopsidae" title="wikilink">Ceratopsidae</a>: The "horns" of the <em><a class="uri" href="Triceratops" title="wikilink">Triceratops</a></em> were extensions of its skull bones although debate exists over whether they had a keratin covering.</li>
<li><a href="Horned_lizard" title="wikilink">Horned lizards</a> (<em>Phrynosoma</em>): These lizards have horns on their heads which have a hard keratin covering over a bony core, like mammalian horns.</li>
<li>Insects: Some insects (such as <a href="rhinoceros_beetle" title="wikilink">rhinoceros beetles</a>) have horn-like structures on the head or <a class="uri" href="thorax" title="wikilink">thorax</a> (or both). These are pointed outgrowths of the hard <a href="chitin" title="wikilink">chitinous</a> <a class="uri" href="exoskeleton" title="wikilink">exoskeleton</a>. Some (such as <a href="stag_beetle" title="wikilink">stag beetles</a>) have greatly enlarged jaws, also made of chitin.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Canidae" title="wikilink">Canidae</a>: <a href="Golden_jackal" title="wikilink">Golden jackals</a> are known to occasionally develop a <a href="Jackal's_Horn" title="wikilink">horny growth</a> on the skull, which is associated with magical powers in south-eastern Asia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Many mammal species in various families have <a href="tusk" title="wikilink">tusks</a>, which often serve the same functions as horns, but are in fact oversize teeth. These include the <a class="uri" href="Moschidae" title="wikilink">Moschidae</a> (Musk deer, which are ruminants), <a class="uri" href="Suidae" title="wikilink">Suidae</a> (<a href="Wild_Boar" title="wikilink">Wild Boars</a>), <a class="uri" href="Proboscidea" title="wikilink">Proboscidea</a> (<a href="Elephant" title="wikilink">Elephants</a>), <a class="uri" href="Monodontidae" title="wikilink">Monodontidae</a> (<a href="Narwhal" title="wikilink">Narwhals</a>) and <a class="uri" href="Odobenidae" title="wikilink">Odobenidae</a> (<a href="Walrus" title="wikilink">Walruses</a>).  <a href="Polled_livestock" title="wikilink">Polled</a> animals or <em>pollards</em> are those of normally-horned (mainly <a class="uri" href="domesticated" title="wikilink">domesticated</a>) species whose horns have been removed, or which have not grown. In some cases such animals have small horny growths in the skin where their horns would be – these are known as <em>scurs</em>.</p>
<h3 id="on-humans">On humans</h3>

<p><a href="Cutaneous_horn" title="wikilink">Cutaneous horns</a> are the only examples of horns growing on people. They are most often benign growths and can be removed by a razor.</p>

<p>Cases of people growing horns have been historically described, sometimes with mythical status. Researchers have not however discovered photographic evidence of the phenomenon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> There are human cadaveric specimens that show outgrowings, but these are instead classified as <a href="osteoma" title="wikilink">osteomas</a> or other <a href="wikt:excrescence" title="wikilink">excrescences</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The phenomenon of humans with horns has been observed in countries lacking advanced medicine. There are living people, several in China, with cases of cutaneous horns, most common in the elderly.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Some people, notably <a href="The_Enigma_(performer)" title="wikilink">The Enigma</a>, have horn implants; that is, they have implanted silicone beneath the skin as a form of <a href="body_modification" title="wikilink">body modification</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The erect penis is sometimes referred to in slang use as a "horn", but it normally contains no keratin. However, a cutaneous horn can grow <em>on</em> the penis, which may indicate <a class="uri" href="cancer" title="wikilink">cancer</a>. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="animal-uses-of-horns">Animal uses of horns</h2>

<p> Animals have a variety of uses for horns and antlers, including defending themselves from predators and fighting members of their own species (<em>horn fighting</em>) for territory, dominance or <a class="uri" href="mating" title="wikilink">mating</a> priority.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Horns are usually present only in males but in some species, females too may possess horns. It has been theorized by researchers that taller species living in the open are more visible from longer distances and more likely to benefit from horns to defend themselves against predators. Female bovids that are not hidden from predators due to their large size or open <a class="uri" href="Savannah" title="wikilink">Savannah</a> like habitat are more likely to bear horns than small or camouflaged species.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition, horns may be used to root in the soil or strip bark from trees. In animal <a class="uri" href="courtship" title="wikilink">courtship</a> many use horns in displays. For example, the male <a href="blue_wildebeest" title="wikilink">blue wildebeest</a> reams the bark and branches of trees to impress the female and lure her into his <a href="territory_(animal)" title="wikilink">territory</a>. Some animals with true horns use them for cooling. The blood vessels in the bony core allow the horns to function as a <a class="uri" href="radiator" title="wikilink">radiator</a>.</p>

<p>After the death of a horned animal the keratin may be consumed by the larvae of the <a href="Ceratophaga_vastella" title="wikilink">Horn Moth</a>.</p>

<li>Some cultures use bovid horns as <a href="musical_instrument" title="wikilink">musical instruments</a>, for example the <a class="uri" href="shofar" title="wikilink">shofar</a>. These have evolved into <a href="brass_instrument" title="wikilink">brass instruments</a> in which, unlike the <a class="uri" href="trumpet" title="wikilink">trumpet</a>, the bore gradually increases in width through most of its length—that is to say, it is <a href="Cone_(geometry)" title="wikilink">conical</a> rather than <a href="Cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylindrical</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href="Drinking_horn" title="wikilink">Drinking horns</a> are bovid horns removed from the bone core, cleaned and polished and used as <a href="drinking_vessel" title="wikilink">drinking vessels</a>. (See also the legend of the <em>Horn of plenty</em>, or <em><a class="uri" href="Cornucopia" title="wikilink">Cornucopia</a></em>).

<li>Horns consist of <a class="uri" href="keratin" title="wikilink">keratin</a>, and the term "horn" is used to refer to this material, sometimes including similarly solid keratin from other parts of animals, such as <a href="hoof" title="wikilink">hoofs</a>. Horn may be used as a material in tools, <a href="Horn_furniture" title="wikilink">furniture</a> and decoration, among other uses. In these applications, horn is valued for its hardness, and it has given rise to the expression <em>hard as horn</em>. Horn is somewhat <a class="uri" href="thermoplastic" title="wikilink">thermoplastic</a> and (like <a href="Tortoiseshell_material" title="wikilink">tortoiseshell</a>) was formerly used for many purposes where <a class="uri" href="plastic" title="wikilink">plastic</a> would now be used. Horn may be used to make <a class="uri" href="glue" title="wikilink">glue</a>.</li>

<li><a href="Composite_bow" title="wikilink">Horn bows</a> are bows made from a combination of horn, <a class="uri" href="sinew" title="wikilink">sinew</a> and usually wood. These materials allow more energy to be stored in a short bow than wood alone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Horns and horn tips from various animals have been used for centuries in the manufacture of scales, grips, or handles for <a class="uri" href="knives" title="wikilink">knives</a> and other weapons, and beginning in the 19th century, for the handle scales of <a href="handgun" title="wikilink">handguns</a>.</li>
