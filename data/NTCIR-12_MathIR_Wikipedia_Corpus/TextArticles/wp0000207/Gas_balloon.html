<p>A <strong>gas balloon</strong> is a <a class="uri" href="balloon" title="wikilink">balloon</a> that stays in the air because it is filled with a gas less dense than air or <a href="lighter_than_air" title="wikilink">lighter than air</a> (such as <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a> or <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>). A gas balloon may also be called a <em><a href="Robert_brothers#First_manned_hydrogen_balloon_flight" title="wikilink">Charlière</a></em> for its inventor, the Frenchman <a href="Jacques_Charles" title="wikilink">Jacques Charles</a>. Today, familiar gas balloons include large <a href="blimp" title="wikilink">blimps</a> and small rubber party balloons. Blimps have displaced <a href="zeppelin" title="wikilink">zeppelins</a> (which are not balloons) as the dominant form of <a class="uri" href="airship" title="wikilink">airship</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The <a href="Robert_brothers#First_hydrogen_balloon" title="wikilink">first gas balloon</a> made its flight in August 1783. Designed by professor <a href="Jacques_Charles" title="wikilink">Jacques Charles</a> and <a href="Les_Frères_Robert" title="wikilink">Les Frères Robert</a>, it carried no passengers or cargo. On 1 December 1783 their second hydrogen-filled balloon made a manned flight piloted by Jacques Charles and <a href="Nicolas-Louis_Robert" title="wikilink">Nicolas-Louis Robert</a>, 10 days after the first manned flight in a <a class="uri" href="Montgolfier" title="wikilink">Montgolfier</a> <a href="hot_air_balloon" title="wikilink">hot air balloon</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><ref name="Sci&amp;Soc/"><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></ref></p>

<p>The next project of Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers was <em><a href="Robert_brothers#Further_ballooning_activities_-_La_Caroline" title="wikilink">La Caroline</a></em>, an elongated steerable craft that followed <a href="Jean_Baptiste_Meusnier" title="wikilink">Jean Baptiste Meusnier</a>'s proposals for a dirigible balloon, incorporating internal <a href="ballonnet" title="wikilink">ballonnets</a> (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> On September 19, 1784 the brothers and M. Collin-Hullin flew for 6 hours 40 minutes, covering 186 km from Paris to <a class="uri" href="Beuvry" title="wikilink">Beuvry</a> near <a class="uri" href="Béthune" title="wikilink">Béthune</a>. This was the first flight over 100 km.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Gas balloons remained popular throughout the age before powered flight. They could fly higher and further than hot-air balloons, but were more dangerous as they were filled with hydrogen or <a href="coal_gas" title="wikilink">coal gas</a>. Tehered gas balloons were used for observation purposes in the <a href="Napoleonic_Wars" title="wikilink">Napoleonic Wars</a> (to very limited extent) and in the <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">American Civil War</a>, flown by <a href="Thaddeus_Lowe" title="wikilink">Thaddeus Lowe</a> and throughout the 19th century by hobbyists and show performers such as the <a href="Jean-Pierre_Blanchard" title="wikilink">Blanchards</a>.</p>

<p>Gas ballooning has been popular in Europe, most notably in Germany, using hydrogen as a lifting gas. Several gas balloon clubs exist throughout the country with well organized launch sites and well defined infrastructure making flights relatively easy to do. Rough estimates show 150 active gas pilots in Europe. In stark contrast, gas ballooning in the USA might have at most 30 active pilots who typically fly only once a year at the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta in October. This is primarily due to the prohibitively high cost of helium (~$8,000 for a single flight as of 2008), the lifting gas that most American pilots must use because of the design of their balloons. This is starting to change with the introduction of hydrogen as a lifting gas, but there are still only a handful of hydrogen-rated balloons in the country. The German gas community has been a valuable resource in helping the US pilots gain skills in flying gas balloons and working with hydrogen as a lifting gas. Many US gas pilots have been and are currently participating in training flights in Germany.  A gas balloon can also be tethered. <em><a class="uri" href="Aerophile" title="wikilink">Aerophile</a></em> is the world's largest lighter-than-air carrier, flying 300,000 passengers every year through its 8 operations in Walt Disney World, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Smoky Mountains &amp; Irvine in the USA and Paris, Disney Land Paris and Parc du Petit Prince in France…</p>

<p>The altitude record for a manned balloon flight was set at 39.045 kilometers on October 14, 2012 by <a href="Felix_Baumgartner" title="wikilink">Felix Baumgartner</a> breaking a record of 34.7 kilometers on May 4, 1961 by <a href="Malcolm_Ross_(balloonist)" title="wikilink">Malcolm Ross</a> and <a href="Victor_Prather" title="wikilink">Victor Prather</a> in a balloon launched from the deck of the  in the <a href="Gulf_of_Mexico" title="wikilink">Gulf of Mexico</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The altitude record for an unmanned balloon is 53.0 kilometers. It was reached by a Fujikura balloon with a volume of 60 thousand cubic metres, launched in May 2002 from <a class="uri" href="Sanriku" title="wikilink">Sanriku</a>, <a href="Iwate_Prefecture" title="wikilink">Iwate</a>, Japan. This is the greatest height ever obtained by an atmospheric vehicle.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Only <a href="rocket" title="wikilink">rockets</a>, <a href="rocket_plane" title="wikilink">rocket planes</a>, and <a href="ballistics" title="wikilink">ballistic</a> projectiles have flown higher.</p>

<p>In 2015, the two pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in <a href="Baja_California" title="wikilink">Baja California</a>, Mexico after a journey of 11,265 km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours, the balloon named "Two Eagles" arrived in Mexico, which is a new long-distance record.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>The Russian <a href="space_probe" title="wikilink">space probes</a> <a href="Vega_1" title="wikilink">Vega 1</a> and <a href="Vega_2" title="wikilink">Vega 2</a> each dropped a helium balloon with scientific experiments into the <a href="atmosphere_of_Venus" title="wikilink">atmosphere of Venus</a> in 1985. The balloons first <a href="atmospheric_reentry" title="wikilink">entered the atmosphere</a> and descended to about 50 km, then inflated for level flight. Otherwise the flight was uncontrolled.

<li id="fn7">Nicholas Piantanida, while attempting to set a new skydiving jump record, is claimed to have reached 123,800 feet (37.73 km) on February 2, 1966. Piantanida was unable to disconnect his breathing apparatus from the gondola, so the ground crew jettisoned the balloon at the flight ceiling. The flight did not set a flight record because he descended without the balloon. See excerpts from Craig Ryan's description of Piantanida's flight and harrowing descent: <a href="#fnref7">↩</a></li>
