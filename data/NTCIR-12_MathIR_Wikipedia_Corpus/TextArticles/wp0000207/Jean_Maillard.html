<p><strong>Jean Maillard</strong> (c. 1515 – after 1570) was a <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> <a class="uri" href="composer" title="wikilink">composer</a> of the <a href="Renaissance_music" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>.</p>

<p>While little is known with certainty about his life, he may have been associated with the French royal court, since he wrote at least one <a class="uri" href="motet" title="wikilink">motet</a> for them. Most likely he lived and worked in <a class="uri" href="Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a>, based on evidence of his print editions, which were prepared there. Since later in his career he set verse by <a class="uri" href="Huguenot" title="wikilink">Huguenot</a> poet <a href="Guillaume_Guéroult" title="wikilink">Guillaume Guéroult</a>, as well as <a href="Clément_Marot" title="wikilink">Clément Marot</a>, he may have either become a <a class="uri" href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> or had Protestant sympathies; this could explain his disappearance from Paris around 1570. If he did leave the city then, his destination is unknown. No record of him after that year has been found.</p>

<p>Maillard is mentioned by <a class="uri" href="Rabelais" title="wikilink">Rabelais</a> in <em><a href="Gargantua_and_Pantagruel" title="wikilink">Gargantua and Pantagruel</a></em>, and also by <a class="uri" href="Ronsard" title="wikilink">Ronsard</a> in his <em>Livre des Mélanges</em> (1560 and 1572). He was evidently famous during his time, and many of his motets were used as source material for <a href="parody_mass" title="wikilink">parody masses</a> by composers as distinguished as <a href="Giovanni_Pierluigi_da_Palestrina" title="wikilink">Palestrina</a>; in addition <a href="Orlande_de_Lassus" title="wikilink">Lassus</a> reworked some of his music. <a href="Claude_Goudimel" title="wikilink">Claude Goudimel</a> also used a secular <a class="uri" href="chanson" title="wikilink">chanson</a> of Maillard's as source material for a <a href="mass_(music)" title="wikilink">mass</a>.</p>

<p>Six of Maillard's masses have survived, and two others are known to have been lost. Considerable other music of his has survived in printed editions, including eighty-six motets, settings of the <em><a class="uri" href="Magnificat" title="wikilink">Magnificat</a>,</em> <a href="lamentations_(music)" title="wikilink">lamentations</a>, <em>chansons spirituelles</em>, and secular <a href="chanson" title="wikilink">chansons</a>. Stylistically, his sacred music is more closely related to the contemporary <a href="Dutch_School_(music)" title="wikilink">Franco-Flemish</a> idiom of pervasive, dense, complex <a class="uri" href="polyphony" title="wikilink">polyphony</a> than to the relatively clear and succinct style of his fellow French composers. In particular, he used short motifs in close <a href="imitation_(music)" title="wikilink">imitation</a>, and often used strict canonic devices. About half of his motets are for four voices; the rest are for five or six, with one motet for seven voices. Many of his motets have the <a href="cantus_firmus" title="wikilink">cantus firmus</a> in long note values in the highest voice, while the other voices carry on in a polyphonic, imitative texture.</p>

<p>His <em>Missa pro mortuis</em> was an early <a href="Requiem_mass_setting" title="wikilink">Requiem mass setting</a>, and one of the only examples from France in the 16th century.</p>

<p>Unlike his sacred music, his secular music was in the prevailing popular idiom of the 1540s.</p>
<h2 id="modern-editions">Modern editions</h2>

<p>Maillard's sacred works are being edited for publication by Raymond H. Rosenstock. His editions of motets already published several years ago by A-R Editions in the USA provide useful further information and authoritative modern transcriptions; he has also edited Maillard's masses, published by The Institute of Mediaeval Music in Canada.</p>
