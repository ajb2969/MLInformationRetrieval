<h2 id="bloc-party">Bloc Party</h2>

<p>Moakes became a member of <a href="Bloc_Party" title="wikilink">Bloc Party</a> after responding to an advertisement placed in the <a class="uri" href="NME" title="wikilink">NME</a> music magazine by <a href="Kele_Okereke" title="wikilink">Kele Okereke</a> and <a href="Russell_Lissack" title="wikilink">Russell Lissack</a>, who were seeking a <a class="uri" href="bassist" title="wikilink">bassist</a>. Although not originally a bassist, Moakes was the only player the band auditioned who was able to play the <a class="uri" href="bassline" title="wikilink">bassline</a> for a song that Okereke and Lissack had presented. In 2002, Moakes, Lissack, and Okereke formed the first incarnation of <a href="Bloc_Party" title="wikilink">Bloc Party</a>—known as The Angel Range—and played shows across <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>. Moakes also ran and updated the band's <a class="uri" href="website" title="wikilink">website</a> at the time.</p>

<p>Moakes shares co-writing credits with Okereke on some of the band's earlier lyrics. In the early days of the band, he contributed lyrics mostly to the band's more political songs, and he composed a song titled "Diet".</p>

<p>His bass playing is often sparse and usually involves very little playing until latter verses, such as in "<a href="Like_Eating_Glass" title="wikilink">Like Eating Glass</a>", "<a href="Banquet/Staying_Fat" title="wikilink">Banquet</a>", and "<a href="Hunting_for_Witches" title="wikilink">Hunting for Witches</a>".</p>

<p>Moakes added new instruments to his repertoire on <a href="Bloc_Party" title="wikilink">Bloc Party</a>'s second and third albums, <em><a href="A_Weekend_in_the_City" title="wikilink">A Weekend in the City</a></em> and <em><a href="Intimacy_(Bloc_Party_album)" title="wikilink">Intimacy</a></em>. He played <a href="Drum_kit" title="wikilink">drums</a> on "Sunday", <a href="electronic_drum" title="wikilink">electronic drums</a> on "Ares", <a class="uri" href="glockenspiel" title="wikilink">glockenspiel</a> on "Waiting for the 7.18" and "SRXT", and a <a class="uri" href="microKORG" title="wikilink">microKORG</a> <a class="uri" href="synthesizer" title="wikilink">synthesizer</a> on "<a href="Flux_(song)" title="wikilink">Flux</a>" (although he now uses a Korg X50).</p>

<p>He is also a backing vocalist and his voice can be heard in many of the band's songs often in contrast with Okereke's lead vocals.</p>

<p>He remixed their song "<a href="Talons_(song)" title="wikilink">Talons</a>" from their album <em><a href="Intimacy_(Bloc_Party_album)" title="wikilink">Intimacy</a></em>. The remix was featured on the songs download &amp; vinyl single.</p>

<p>Gordon has confirmed that he has left the band to focus on his side project <a href="Young_Legionnaire" title="wikilink">Young Legionnaire</a> and will not be involved in the band's upcoming fifth studio album and all other future efforts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> This makes him the second member to leave the group after drummer Matt Tong. It remains unclear who will take Gordon's place in the band. Moakes currently resides in Austin, Texas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
