<p>Reinerová grew up in a German-speaking Jewish family, her mother a German-Bohemian from Saaz (<a class="uri" href="Žatec" title="wikilink">Žatec</a>) and her father an ironware dealer from Prague. Prior to <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, she worked as a translator, an interpreter and an editor for the <em>Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung</em>. She fled to <a class="uri" href="Paris" title="wikilink">Paris</a> in 1938 and later travelled to <a class="uri" href="Morocco" title="wikilink">Morocco</a>. She was visiting Mexico with the journalist and writer <a href="Egon_Erwin_Kisch" title="wikilink">Egon Erwin Kisch</a> in March 1939 and was the only member of her family to survive the <a class="uri" href="Holocaust" title="wikilink">Holocaust</a>. She returned to what was then <a class="uri" href="Czechoslovakia" title="wikilink">Czechoslovakia</a> after 1948. In the 1950s, she was jailed by Czechoslovakia's <a class="uri" href="Stalinist" title="wikilink">Stalinist</a> authorities and spent 15 months in prison; she recorded this experience in one of her novels, <em><a href="Alle_Farben_der_Sonne_und_der_Nacht" title="wikilink">Alle Farben der Sonne und der Nacht</a></em>. After her release she published sporadically. Beginning in 1968, she was not allowed to publish at all until the fall of <a class="uri" href="communism" title="wikilink">communism</a>. Her works are mostly published at Aufbau Verlagsgruppe, <a class="uri" href="Berlin" title="wikilink">Berlin</a>.</p>

<p>On January 25, 2008, a speech Reinerová wrote but could not longer deliver personally due to ill health was read in German <a href="Bundestag" title="wikilink">parliament</a> in the course of an hour of remembrance for the victims of the <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi regime</a>.</p>

<p>In 1999, she was awarded the <a href="Schiller_Prize" title="wikilink">Schiller Prize</a>. In 2003, she won the prestigious <a href="Goethe_Medal" title="wikilink">Goethe Medal</a>.</p>

<p>Reinerová had been largely a recluse ever since a spell in hospital in 2007, with the cause of her death not immediately known. Lucie Cernhousova, head of Literaturhaus, the Prague publisher of German-language writers, disclosed her death.</p>

<p>Reinerová, the oldest living German-language writer in Prague, died June 27, 2008, in Prague, in her apartment, at 92.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
