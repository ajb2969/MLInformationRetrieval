<p>White tie. The copyright holder has been contacted by me and agrees to its usage.</p>

<p>Not all those appearing in the image are in white tie: some of the men are wearing black tie (a <a href="tuxedo_(clothing)" title="wikilink">tuxedo</a>), which is not considered formal enough for full evening dress.   "</p>
