<p><strong>Dire Dawa</strong> (, , <small>lit.</small> "Place of Remedy",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> , <small>meaning</small> "Limit of the Dir"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>) is one of two <a href="Administrative_divisions_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">chartered cities</a> (<em>astedader akabibi</em>) in <a class="uri" href="Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Ethiopia</a> (the other being the capital, <a href="Addis_Ababa" title="wikilink">Addis Ababa</a>). It is divided administratively into two <a href="woreda" title="wikilink">woredas</a>, the city proper and the non-urban woreda of <a class="uri" href="Gurgura" title="wikilink">Gurgura</a>.</p>
<p>Dire Dawa lies in the eastern part of the nation, on the <a href="Dechatu_River" title="wikilink">Dechatu River</a>, at the foot of a ring of cliffs that has been described as "somewhat like a cluster of tea-leaves in the bottom of a slop-basin."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> At a latitude and longitude of , it is the second largest city in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The city is an industrial centre, home to several <a href="market_(place)" title="wikilink">markets</a> and the <a href="Aba_Tenna_Dejazmach_Yilma_International_Airport" title="wikilink">Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport</a>. <a href="Haramaya_University" title="wikilink">Haramaya University</a> is 40 kilometers away.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p> First negotiated in 1897 after the establishment of <a href="Alfred_Ilg" title="wikilink">Alfred Ilg</a>'s <a href="Imperial_Railway_Company_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia</a>, Dire Dawaoriginally known by its period French spelling <strong><em>Dire-Daoua</em></strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>grew up at the site of a former village known as <strong>Addis Harar</strong> (<a class="uri" href="Amharic" title="wikilink">Amharic</a> for "New Harar") upon the line's arrival in 1902.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The company (which went bankrupt four years later) was already having financial difficulty and Ilg received permission from <a href="emperor_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Emperor</a> <a href="Menelik_II" title="wikilink">Menelik II</a> not to complete the expensive climb to nearby <a class="uri" href="Harar" title="wikilink">Harar</a> at its higher elevation. Instead, Addis Harar served as the terminus for the line linking the area with the French port at <a class="uri" href="Djibouti" title="wikilink">Djibouti</a> and the potentially confusing name was changed to that of another nearby village, Dire Dawa.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Harar's governor <a href="Ras_Makonnen" title="wikilink">Ras Makonnen</a> then linked the two cities with a new road.   Dire Dawa's first governor was <a href="Ato_Mersha_Nahusenay" title="wikilink">Ato Mersha Nahusenay</a>, who was also instrumental in the construction of the first railway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The imperial railway company (Cie) played a key role in the early development of the city, particularly Gezira (aka Kezira), under the authority of the Ethiopian government. The original failed company was reörganized as the joint-government <a href="Franco-Ethiopian_Railway" title="wikilink">Franco-Ethiopian Railway</a> in 1908 and, after a period of financial negotiation and recapitalization, construction began anew, linking the city with the Ethiopian capital <a href="Addis_Ababa" title="wikilink">Addis Ababa</a> in 1917. The Dire Dawa-Harar road was improved in 1928, shortening the travel time to only a few hours.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 1931, the <a href="Bank_of_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">Bank of Ethiopia</a> opened its first branch in the city<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and, a generation later, the writer C.F. Rey described the city as the most "advanced" urban center in the area, with good roads, electric lights, and piped water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>  During the <a href="Second_Italo-Abyssinian_War" title="wikilink">Italian invasion</a>, <a href="Benito_Mussolini" title="wikilink">Mussolini</a> ordered that Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa be spared air attacks (which included the use of <a href="chemical_weapons" title="wikilink">chemical weapons</a> such as <a href="mustard_gas" title="wikilink">mustard gas</a>) and other destruction as a response to the demands of the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> and certain European countries for the safety of their citizens. The Italian army entered the country from the colonies of <a href="Italian_Eritrea" title="wikilink">Eritrea</a> in the north and <a href="Italian_Somaliland" title="wikilink">Somalia</a> in the southeast. Following all major engagements of the war, Dire Dawa was the location of the meeting of the two Italian forces. General <a class="uri" href="Graziani" title="wikilink">Graziani</a>'s units, advancing from Harar, reached the city's barbed-wire fence on 6 May 1936, the day after the occupation of <a href="Addis_Ababa" title="wikilink">Addis Ababa</a> and Emperor <a href="Haile_Selassie" title="wikilink">Haile Selassie</a>'s flight along the railroad to <a class="uri" href="Djibouti" title="wikilink">Djibouti</a> and <a href="British_Palestine" title="wikilink">Palestine</a>. They were met by two French armed cars: the railway remained under French administration and they had remained to protect the French interests. The next day, the first train under Italian control left Addis Ababa: it brought Italy's 46th Infantry Regiment and finally closed the pincers of the two Italian invasion forces. The occupation of the town was more or less a formality,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> although resistance fighters known as <em>Arbegnoch</em> ("Patriots") continued to operate throughout the conflict. It was officially known by its Italian spelling <em>Dire Daua</em> during the occupation.</p>
<p>Following the restoration of the empire in 1941, Dire Dawa was among the early provincial towns to have its own <a class="uri" href="soccer" title="wikilink">soccer</a> league. Around 1947, their teamthe Taffariparticipated in the <a href="Ethiopian_Football_Federation" title="wikilink">Ethiopian Championship series</a>. That same year, the <a href="Railroad_Workers_Syndicate_of_Dire_Dawa" title="wikilink">Railroad Workers Syndicate of Dire Dawa</a>, a <a href="Trade_unions_in_Ethiopia" title="wikilink">labor union</a>, was formed for welfare purposes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Although its leadership coöperated with the government, its attempt to strike in 1949 was brutally suppressed by imperial troops; at the time, all strikes were seen as forms of insurrection or treason.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square to receive and rebroadcast state radio transmissions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="Ethiopian_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Ethiopian revolution</a> affected the city in many ways. Starting March 1974, there was some worker unrest; six people were wounded when police opened fire on demonstrating railwaymen and students on 17 April. Many Europeans, Yemeni Arabs, and Indians left Dire Dawa; the Greek and Armenian churches were eventually closed due to dwindling membership. On 3 February 1975, the <a class="uri" href="Derg" title="wikilink">Derg</a> announced that the Cotton Company of Ethiopia was among 14 textile enterprises to be fully <a href="nationalization" title="wikilink">nationalized</a>. The <a href="portland_cement" title="wikilink">cement</a> factory was also later nationalized. In August 1976, the entire leadership of the local branch of the <a href="Ethiopian_Teachers'_Association" title="wikilink">teachers' union</a> was sacked for alleged anti-revolutionary activities. Ten new officials were appointed pending fresh elections.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>According to Gebru Tareke, the success of the <a href="Ethiopian_Army" title="wikilink">Ethiopian Army</a> in holding Dire Dawa (17–18 August 1977) against the <a href="Somali_Army" title="wikilink">Somali Army</a> was decisive in winning the <a href="Ogaden_War" title="wikilink">Ogaden War</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The war led to <a href="Somali_diaspora" title="wikilink">widespread dislocation</a> of Ethiopia's native Somali population and subsequent repopulation from other areas of the country greatly decreased their importance around Dire Dawa.</p>
<p>Dire Dawa was occupied by the <a class="uri" href="EPRDF" title="wikilink">EPRDF</a> on 31 May 1991. There were reports of about 100 people killed resisting the EPRDF. In 1991, when the <a href="Somali_National_Movement" title="wikilink">Somali National Movement</a> took control of northern <a class="uri" href="Somalia" title="wikilink">Somalia</a>, they dismantled and sold the only publicly owned industry in the whole Somali northern region, a cement factory near Berbera, which was shipped off to help expand the cement factory in Dire Dawa.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Both the <a href="Issa_and_Gurgura_Liberation_Front" title="wikilink">Issa and Gurgura Liberation Front</a> and the <a href="Oromo_Liberation_Front" title="wikilink">Oromo Liberation Front</a> claimed the city. As a result, there were numerous clashes between the two groups from 1991 until 1993. This ongoing violence and the fear of protracted ethnic conflict caused the city to be designated federally administered.</p>
<p>Dire Dawa was separated from the <a href="Oromia_Region" title="wikilink">Oromia Region</a> around 1998 to become a chartered city.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>On June 24, 2002, a small explosive was detonated at the headquarters of the Ethiopian Railway Commission in Dire Dawa. The <a href="Oromo_Liberation_Front" title="wikilink">Oromo Liberation Front</a> (OLF) afterwards claimed responsibility for this attack in retaliation "for the continuing harassment of Oromo students, merchants, and farmers by the Ethiopian government." Although blamed for other isolated incidents, this was the latest bombing inside Ethiopia for which the OLF claimed responsibility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>The city was <a href="flood" title="wikilink">flooded</a> in August 2006 when the <a href="Dechatu_River" title="wikilink">Dechatu River</a> overflowed its banks. About 200 people were reported dead, thousands were displaced and there was extensive damage to homes and markets. Floods are fairly common during the June–September <a href="wet_season" title="wikilink">rainy season</a>; over 200 people in the region had been killed by flooding in 2005 that did millions of dollars in damage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>An overturned truck, heading from <a class="uri" href="Dengego" title="wikilink">Dengego</a> to Dire Dawa, killed 41 people 4 March 2009. The truck was carrying an unknown number of day laborers when the accident happened, and 38 were immediately killed and as many as 50 were injured. Dead and injured were taken to Dil-chora Hospital in Dire Dawa. The cause was not immediately known.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
