<h1>Eternia</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Eternia</strong> is the name of the <a href="Planets_in_science_fiction" title="wikilink">fictional planet</a> that serves as a setting for the <a href="Masters_of_the_Universe" title="wikilink">Masters of the Universe</a> toy collection and animated series.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>

<p>According to the 36th produced episode of the 1980s series, "The Search", and the 1987 motion picture, Eternia is at the center of the universe. Although little mentioned in the franchise, at the planet's center lies the Star Seed, a spark left over from the creation of the universe. Possessing it would grant infinite power to its holder. <a class="uri" href="Skeletor" title="wikilink">Skeletor</a>, upon discovering this information, tries to obtain it, but <a class="uri" href="He-Man" title="wikilink">He-Man</a> is able to get it first. After resisting its corrupting influence, he then gives it to <a class="uri" href="Zodac" title="wikilink">Zodac</a>, who disposes of it. In another episode it is noted that Eternia exists at the juncture of alternate universes, which is an explanation for why the laws governing both magic and science work on Eternia.</p>
<h3 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h3>

<p>Eternia's prehistoric era is known as "Preternia." It seems to have featured <a class="uri" href="dinosaur" title="wikilink">dinosaur</a>-like monsters, including some <a href="bionics" title="wikilink">bionic</a> variations of unknown origin, <a href="giant_(mythology)" title="wikilink">giants</a>, and <a href="caveman" title="wikilink">cavemen</a>. Some of these dinosaurs are preserved within Eternia's Tar Swamp.</p>

<p>According to the Filmation series bible, Eternia used to be an incredibly advanced civilization that evolved through centuries of barbarism, enlightenment and scientific technology.</p>

<p>Some of Eternia's ancient civilizations possessed very advanced technology, and left many ruins and artifacts behind. One such race is the <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Egyptian</a>-like Osirians, who used to live in the Sands of Time.</p>

<p>The oldest being still alive on Eternia is an enormous sentient tree named Skytree. The second oldest is <a class="uri" href="Granamyr" title="wikilink">Granamyr</a>, ruler of the Dragons of Darksmoke, who has always envied the tree's status.</p>

<p>Earlier drafts of the 1987 live-action film's script (great portions of which take place on <a class="uri" href="Earth" title="wikilink">Earth</a>) reveal that the Eternians in this version are descendants of <a href="human" title="wikilink">Earthlings</a>, and feature a <a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a> <a href="space_probe" title="wikilink">space probe</a> and <a href="US_flag" title="wikilink">US flag</a> being found in the vaults of <a href="Castle_Grayskull" title="wikilink">Castle Grayskull</a>, prompting the explanation that human life arrived on Eternia when it was colonized by a space exploration team from Earth's future. This scene appears in the comic adaptation of the movie.</p>
<h3 id="castle-grayskull">Castle Grayskull</h3>

<p>In the original series, <a href="Castle_Grayskull" title="wikilink">Castle Grayskull</a> was a fortress of mystery and power, and to control it was to control the universe. At least once, it was described as a storehouse for the Ancients' knowledge and power. Beyond that, not much was revealed about the castle's origins in the original series.</p>

<p>In keeping with the notion detailed above, the 2002 series explained that Castle Grayskull held the Orb of Power, in which dwelled the knowledge and power of the Council of Elders. It was also the place where <a href="King_Grayskull" title="wikilink">King Grayskull</a>'s <a href="Sword_of_Power" title="wikilink">Sword of Power</a> was stored until the day it was claimed by <a href="Prince_Adam" title="wikilink">Prince Adam</a>. This sword contained the very essence of King Grayskull's noble attributes and strengths, and allows its wielder to call upon those same gifts.</p>

<p>According to both series, Castle Grayskull is protected by a powerful guardian.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Typically, this person is a woman who calls herself the <a href="Sorceress_of_Castle_Grayskull" title="wikilink">Sorceress of Castle Grayskull</a>, who will occasionally adopt a falcon-like guise known as <a href="Zoar_(Masters_of_the_Universe)" title="wikilink">Zoar</a> in order to travel the planes of Eternia.</p>
<h3 id="modern-eternia">Modern Eternia</h3>

<p>The original concept of Eternia is as a world with a <a href="barbarian" title="wikilink">barbaric</a> civilization, recovering from an ambiguous Great War, that has wiped out advanced civilizations, but has left behind advanced <a class="uri" href="technology" title="wikilink">technology</a>, vehicles and machinery, as well as powerful <a href="magic_(paranormal)" title="wikilink">magic</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In the animated series, the concept of a Great War was abandoned, instead focusing on a stable society and its constant battle against the forces of evil, led by Skeletor. Eternia features an incredible variety of lifeforms, from monsters to sentient races, including non-humanoids, and hidden civilizations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>In both series depictions, Eternia also appears to be a comparatively small planet; as characters are often seen traversing between locations in far-flung regions of the planet, in short amounts of time. This is also supported by the fact that nearly all Eternian creatures seem capable of jumping extraordinary heights and distances, relative to their own size—as a smaller planet would also have comparatively weak gravity.</p>

<p>Frequently visited locations in the modern age of Eternia include Castle Grayskull, the Evergreen Forest, the Vine Jungle, the Palace of Eternia, the Mystic Mountains, and Snake Mountain. It should be noted that there seem to be very few "modern" or contemporary locations in Eternia. Many, if not most, of the cities, castles, and regions are very ancient.</p>

<p>In the 2002 cartoon series, the planet is seen to have two very distinctive regions—the Dark Hemisphere and the Light Hemisphere (something that was mentioned in some earlier incarnations but seldom played upon). In the episode <em>Separation</em> the <a href="Sorceress_of_Castle_Grayskull" title="wikilink">Sorceress</a> tells <a class="uri" href="He-Man" title="wikilink">He-Man</a> that long ago <a class="uri" href="Hordak" title="wikilink">Hordak</a> and his minions used the Triad of Discidium to create the Dark Hemisphere in an effort to give his army a place to grow and thrive. Unfortunately, the magic he unleashed was beyond his ability to control, and the spell nearly destroyed all of Eternia. In more recent times, the dark half of the planet has served as Skeletor's domain, and a place to be avoided at all costs.</p>
