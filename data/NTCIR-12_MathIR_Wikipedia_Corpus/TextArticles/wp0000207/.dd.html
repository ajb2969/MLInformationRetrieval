'''.dd''' was the assigned [[country code top-level domain]] (ccTLD) for the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany). It was chosen based on the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code for the [[German Democratic Republic]], the letters coming from the [[German language|German]] name of the country: ''{{lang|de|'''D'''eutsche '''D'''emokratische Republik}}''. In accordance with [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] policy, '''.dd''' was therefore available to be assigned as the [[country code top-level domain]] (ccTLD) for East Germany. However, this was never done, and so .dd was never added to the [[root nameserver]]s. Its only use was internally at the universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] and [[Dresden University of Technology|Dresden]].<ref>[http://internet.robert-scheck.de/tld-dd/ Information site about .dd in German language]</ref>

With the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]], East Germany became part of the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], which had already been assigned the ccTLD [[.de]]. The ISO 3166-1 code "DD" was withdrawn in 1990.<ref>[http://www.statoids.com/w3166his.html Changes in ISO 3166-1 (annotated summary of RIPE documents)]</ref>
