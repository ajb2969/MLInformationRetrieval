<h1>Yiwu</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Yiwu</strong> () is a city of about 1.2 million people<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in central <a class="uri" href="Zhejiang" title="wikilink">Zhejiang</a> province, <a href="People's_Republic_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Republic of China</a>. Its built-up (<em>or metro</em>) area made of Yiwu and Dongyang cities was home to 2,038,413 inhabitants at the 2010 census. The city is famous for its small commodity trade and vibrant market and is a regional tourist destination. Although administratively Yiwu is a <a href="county-level_city" title="wikilink">county-level city</a> under the jurisdiction of <a class="uri" href="Jinhua" title="wikilink">Jinhua</a>, it is more well-known than Jinhua nationally and internationally.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Yiwu was founded in the <a href="Qin_dynasty" title="wikilink">Qin dynasty</a>, around 222 BC. Yiwu's long history flourished as early as the <a href="Neolithic_Age" title="wikilink">Neolithic Age</a>. Yiwu first became a county in 222 BC and was renamed Yiwu County in the year 624 AD. Trade has been historically important in Yiwu since the surrounding area has little arable soil. Even before 1600s, Yiwu men would carry sewing needles, threads, sugar chunks and other small commodities in their bamboo baskets, using a shoulder-pole, and travel to surrounding rural villages in exchange for chicken feathers. Chicken feathers could be either used as a fertilizer for their own lands, or made into feather dusters for exporting. This "Sugar-For-Chicken Feathers" tradition had become part of Yiwu culture. As the trading population grew larger, the earliest wholesale markets emerged in Yiwu around 1700s. After the founding of People's Republic of China in 1949, the free market was once considered capitalistic and hence officially suppressed, forcing Yiwu people to continue their trade secretly. It was only after <a href="Deng_Xiaoping" title="wikilink">Deng Xiaoping</a>'s <a href="Chinese_economic_reform" title="wikilink">economic reform</a> in 1978 did the Yiwu market thrive again, becoming one of the first free marketplaces in PRC's history. The cement boards over a stinky ditch nearby Huqingmen street, set up by the local government as the first marketplace in 1982, later became the present day <a href="Yiwu_market#Yiwu_International_Trade_Mart" title="wikilink">Yiwu International Trade Mart</a> after 27 years of development.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In May 1988 the former Yiwu County was upgraded to a county-level city. In 1995 Yiwu ranked the 47th among China's 100 most powerful counties/cities regarding comprehensive economic strength and in the same year listed as Zhejiang's sole city among the nation's experimental counties/cities of comprehensive reform. In 2001 Yiwu's overall economy ranked 19th of all counties (cities) of China.</p>

<p>Yiwu's early culture has given birth to a number of notable figures in literature, art, military, education and engineering.
