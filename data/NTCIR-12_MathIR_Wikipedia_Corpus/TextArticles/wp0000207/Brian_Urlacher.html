<p><strong>Brian Urlacher</strong> (; born May 25, 1978) is a former <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">American football</a> <a class="uri" href="linebacker" title="wikilink">linebacker</a> who spent his entire 13-year career playing for the <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a> of the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a> (NFL). He played <a href="college_football" title="wikilink">college football</a> for the <a href="University_of_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">University of New Mexico</a>, where he was recognized as a consensus <a class="uri" href="All-American" title="wikilink">All-American</a> and became one of the school's most decorated athletes.</p>

<p>The Bears selected Urlacher with the ninth overall pick in the <a href="2000_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2000 NFL Draft</a>. Urlacher quickly established himself as one of the NFL's most productive defensive players. After winning the <a href="NFL_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NFL Rookie of the Year Award</a> in <a href="2000_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2000</a>, he was elected to eight <a href="Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowls</a>, and won the <a href="NFL_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">NFL Defensive Player of the Year</a> award in <a href="2005_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2005</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His playing style, accomplishments and reputation have made him one of the team's most popular players.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After retiring from playing football, he was briefly an analyst for <a href="Fox_Sports_1" title="wikilink">Fox Sports 1</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Urlacher was born to Bradley and Lavoyda Urlacher in <a href="Pasco,_Washington" title="wikilink">Pasco, Washington</a>, and his parents raised him with his younger brother <a href="Casey_Urlacher" title="wikilink">Casey</a>. After his parents separated, Lavoyda raised Urlacher and his siblings in <a href="Lovington,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Lovington, New Mexico</a>. He spent his youth immersed in sports, and developed an interest in <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a>, <a class="uri" href="basketball" title="wikilink">basketball</a>, <a href="track_and_field" title="wikilink">track</a> and later <a href="table_tennis" title="wikilink">table tennis</a>; he graduated from <a href="Lovington_High_School" title="wikilink">Lovington High School</a> in 1996. While his mother worked several jobs to keep her family afloat, Urlacher spent his teenage years playing sports for Lovington High School and training in <a href="weight_room" title="wikilink">weight rooms</a>. The training helped Urlacher gain the speed, stamina, and strength he would need to solidify his football career.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>As he progressed through high school, Urlacher gained experience in all three phases of football. He saw playing time as a <a href="running_back" title="wikilink">running back</a>, <a href="wide_receiver" title="wikilink">wide receiver</a>, <a href="Special_Teams" title="wikilink">return specialist</a>, and <a href="defensive_back" title="wikilink">defensive back</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Urlacher led the Lovington High Wildcats to an undefeated 14–0 season, and a division 3-A state championship.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He finished the season with twelve <a class="uri" href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdown</a> receptions, six touchdown returns, and two rushing touchdowns.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He additionally merited state-recognized honors in <a href="American_football" title="wikilink">football</a>, as well as <a class="uri" href="basketball" title="wikilink">basketball</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Lovington has since recognized Urlacher's accomplishments by retiring his high-school jersey number, and naming a holiday after him.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Urlacher wanted to attend <a href="Texas_Tech_University" title="wikilink">Texas Tech University</a>, but the school did not offer him an athletic scholarship.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="college-career">College career</h2>

<p>Urlacher enrolled at the <a href="University_of_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">University of New Mexico</a>, majored in <a class="uri" href="criminology" title="wikilink">criminology</a>, and played for the <a href="New_Mexico_Lobos_football" title="wikilink">New Mexico Lobos football</a> team.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The Lobos' head coach, <a href="Dennis_Franchione" title="wikilink">Dennis Franchione</a>, converted Urlacher to <a class="uri" href="linebacker" title="wikilink">linebacker</a>, but often left him on the sidelines in favor of more experienced players.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The team finished with winning records during Urlacher's first two years and even made a trip to the 1997 <a href="Insight.com_Bowl" title="wikilink">Insight.com Bowl</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The team's success prompted Franchione to leave New Mexico in favor of <a href="Texas_Christian_University" title="wikilink">Texas Christian University</a>. His departure prompted the school to hire <a href="Rocky_Long" title="wikilink">Rocky Long</a>, a former coach at <a href="University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">UCLA</a>.</p>

<p>Urlacher flourished under Long's tenure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Urlacher not only received more playing time, but also played a more versatile role on both offense and defense. Long converted Urlacher into a "Lobo-Back",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> a cross between a linebacker and <a href="free_safety" title="wikilink">free safety</a>, and placed him in a <a href="American_football_strategy" title="wikilink">3-3-5 defense scheme</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He spent significant time training with the team's <a href="defensive_coordinator" title="wikilink">defensive coordinator</a>, <a href="Bronco_Mendenhall" title="wikilink">Bronco Mendenhall</a>, who helped Urlacher refine his skills as a <a href="defensive_back" title="wikilink">defensive back</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Long also used Urlacher as a <a href="kick_returner" title="wikilink">return specialist</a> and <a href="wide_receiver" title="wikilink">wide receiver</a> throughout his final two years with the Lobos.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Despite Long's extensive changes to the team's roster, formations, and <a href="work_ethic" title="wikilink">work ethic</a>, the Lobos' performance declined. However, Urlacher became one of the team's most productive players during this time. He finished his career with 442 <a href="tackle_(football_move)" title="wikilink">tackles</a>, three <a href="interception" title="wikilink">interceptions</a>, 11 <a href="Quarterback_sack" title="wikilink">sacks</a> and 11 forced <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">fumbles</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Outside of defense, he caught six <a class="uri" href="touchdown" title="wikilink">touchdown</a> passes, and returned five kicks for touchdowns.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>After the 1999 season, he was one of the finalists for the <a href="Jim_Thorpe_Award" title="wikilink">Jim Thorpe Award</a>, and finished twelfth on the <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> ballot.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> Urlacher received <a class="uri" href="All-American" title="wikilink">All-American</a> honors from <a href="Walter_Camp" title="wikilink">Walter Camp</a>, <a href="Football_Writers_Association_of_America" title="wikilink">Football Writers Association of America</a>, and the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He played his final collegiate game at the 2000 <a href="Senior_Bowl" title="wikilink">Senior Bowl</a>, where he was one of the game's top players.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Urlacher led the nation with 178 tackles during his junior year, and also set a school record for most tackles in a single season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> He finished with the third most career tackles in the University of New Mexico's history.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The school has honored Urlacher on several occasions. They awarded him with the Male Athlete of the Year Award in 2000,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and held a special halftime ceremony to honor his success in 2006.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Urlacher was also the first person to be inducted into the University of New Mexico's Football Wall of Fame.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On November 9, 2013, during halftime of New Mexico's game against <a href="Air_Force_Falcons_football" title="wikilink">Air Force</a>, the school retired Urlacher's No. 44 jersey.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="nfl-draft">NFL Draft</h3>

<p>Urlacher was considered one of the most talented collegiate prospects in the <a href="2000_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2000 NFL Draft</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and impressed spectators and analysts at the <a href="NFL_Scouting_Combine" title="wikilink">NFL Scouting Combine</a> by <a href="bench_press" title="wikilink">bench pressing</a> 225 <a href="pound_(mass)" title="wikilink">pounds</a> twenty-seven times, and completing the <a href="40_yard_dash" title="wikilink">forty-yard dash</a> in 4.57 seconds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> The <a href="Chicago_Bears" title="wikilink">Chicago Bears</a>, who were in need of a defensive playmaker after having the 29th ranked defense in 1999,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> selected Urlacher in the first round, as the draft's ninth overall pick.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="section">2000–2004</h3>

<p> He signed a five-year contract, which was worth nearly eight million <a href="USD" title="wikilink">dollars</a> with a five and a half million dollar signing bonus, within two months of the draft.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> <a href="Dick_Jauron" title="wikilink">Dick Jauron</a>, who was then the Bears' <a href="head_coach" title="wikilink">head coach</a>, recognized Urlacher's versatility as a middle and outside <a class="uri" href="linebacker" title="wikilink">linebacker</a>, and appointed him as the team's starting strongside linebacker.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, and lost his starting position to <a href="Rosevelt_Colvin" title="wikilink">Rosevelt Colvin</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the <a href="Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers" title="wikilink">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> shut out the Bears, 41–0.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>He managed to regain a starting spot on the Bears' roster, after <a href="Barry_Minter" title="wikilink">Barry Minter</a>, the team's veteran middle linebacker, was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position, and recorded 46 <a href="tackle_(football_move)" title="wikilink">tackles</a>, six <a href="quarterback_sacks" title="wikilink">sacks</a>, and one <a class="uri" href="interception" title="wikilink">interception</a> in his next five starts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Not even a <a href="human_rib_cage" title="wikilink">rib cage</a> injury hindered his performance during this period, as Urlacher went on to win the league's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks, both of which surpassed the franchise's previous rookie records.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5–11 record, Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season. Many news organizations, such as the <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">Associated Press</a> and <em><a href="The_Sporting_News" title="wikilink">The Sporting News</a></em> named him as the 2000 <a href="National_Football_League_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Defensive Rookie of the Year</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the <a href="2001_Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">2001 Pro Bowl</a> as an alternate middle linebacker.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Urlacher's successful rookie campaign served as the foundation for his professional career and reputation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>Urlacher further distinguished himself as one of the Bears' most productive playmakers during the <a href="2001_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2001 season</a>. He had one of the best games of his career on October 7, against the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>. Urlacher held Falcons quarterback <a href="Michael_Vick" title="wikilink">Michael Vick</a>, who was well known for his <a href="Quarterback_scramble" title="wikilink">scrambling</a> abilities, to 18 rushing yards,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> and recorded a <a href="fumble" title="wikilink">forced fumble</a> and sack.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> He also returned one of Vick's fumbles for a 90-yard touchdown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Two weeks later, Urlacher helped set up a Bears comeback victory against the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="wikilink">San Francisco 49ers</a> by intercepting a pass, and later setting up a game winning touchdown return for <a href="Mike_Brown_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Mike Brown</a>, after causing 49ers <a href="wide_receiver" title="wikilink">wide receiver</a> <a href="Terrell_Owens" title="wikilink">Terrell Owens</a> to lose control of a pass.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> He also caught a touchdown pass from punter <a href="Brad_Maynard" title="wikilink">Brad Maynard</a> off a <a href="trick_play" title="wikilink">fake field goal</a> attempt against the <a href="Washington_Redskins" title="wikilink">Washington Redskins</a> in Week 14, which clinched a first-round bye.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Urlacher concluded the season with three interceptions, six sacks, and was a candidate for 2001 <a href="NFL_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> <em><a href="Football_Digest" title="wikilink">Football Digest</a></em> named Urlacher their publication's defensive player of the year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The 2001 Chicago Bears won 13 games, marking the team's best finish since 1986, but lost to the <a href="Philadelphia_Eagles" title="wikilink">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in the NFC Divisional Playoffs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 winning season would be followed by three years of mediocrity.

<p>In 2005, Urlacher won the <a href="NFL_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year" title="wikilink">NFL Defensive Player of the Year</a> after playing for a defensive team that allowed the fewest points per game, and created the most <a href="turnover_(football)" title="wikilink">turnovers</a> in the <a href="National_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">National Football Conference</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Urlacher himself recorded at least 10 tackles in six consecutive games, while finishing the season with a team high 121 tackles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> He was also credited as one of the team's leaders, whose audibles and experience helped develop several younger teammates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Urlacher led the Bears to an 11-5 record, marking their best finish since <a href="2001_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2001</a>. Urlacher played his second career playoff game against the <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Carolina Panthers</a> on January 15, 2006. He recorded seven tackles and one interception in a 29–21 loss.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Urlacher was also selected to the <a href="2006_Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">2006 Pro Bowl</a>, but declined the position on account of an injury.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p>The team continued their resurgence into the <a href="2006_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2006 season</a>, finishing with a record of 13–3. During the season, Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the <a href="Arizona_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Arizona Cardinals</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> He helped the Bears <a href="2006_Chicago_Bears–Arizona_Cardinals_game" title="wikilink">overcome a 20-point deficit</a> by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> Teammate <a href="Devin_Hester" title="wikilink">Devin Hester</a> commented on Urlacher's performance, stating, "We watched the film and everybody was saying that he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game, just killing people and running over and tackling whoever had the ball."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The Bears won the <a href="NFC_Championship" title="wikilink">NFC Championship</a> against the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a>, 39–14, but lost <a href="Super_Bowl_XLI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLI</a> to the <a href="Indianapolis_Colts" title="wikilink">Indianapolis Colts</a>, 29–17. Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles. He was elected to the <a href="2006_All-Pro_Team" title="wikilink">2006 All-Pro Team</a> and <a href="2007_Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">2007 Pro Bowl</a>, while also earning consideration for the League's Defensive Player of the Year award.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>The Bears were unable to replicate their success in the <a href="2007_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2007 season</a>, and finished last in the <a href="NFC_North" title="wikilink">NFC North</a>. In the middle of the season, Urlacher admitted that he had been suffering from an <a href="arthritis" title="wikilink">arthritic back</a>, but later claimed the ailment was not serious.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Nevertheless, he finished the season on a high note, registering five interceptions, five sacks, one fumble recovery, 123 tackles, and a defensive touchdown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Following the season's conclusion, Urlacher received minor neck surgery to treat his arthritic back.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> During the off season, Urlacher revised his contract with the Bears, who granted him a $6 million signing bonus with a $1 million increase in salary each of the next four years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>Urlacher dislocated his wrist in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He underwent surgery, and went on to miss the remainder of the season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of <a class="uri" href="quarterback" title="wikilink">quarterback</a> <a href="Jay_Cutler_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Jay Cutler</a> had changed the team's identity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> He went on to say, "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that's the truth."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Urlacher and Cutler later made amends.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.</p>

<p>After recovering from the injury, Urlacher stated, "I feel more powerful. I’m running to the football, my keys are a lot more clear now, and I’m playing downhill... So I think it did help my body kind of calm down and relax a little bit.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> " During the 2010 offseason, Bears <a href="general_manager" title="wikilink">general manager</a> <a href="Jerry_Angelo" title="wikilink">Jerry Angelo</a> bolstered the team's defense by signing free agent <a href="Julius_Peppers" title="wikilink">Julius Peppers</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>With Peppers' help, Urlacher and the Bears improved to an 11–5 record in the 2010 NFL season, winning the NFC North and earning a first-round <a href="bye_(sports)" title="wikilink">bye</a> for the 2011 Playoffs. After leading the NFC in tackles (49) during the period, Urlacher was recognized as the NFC Defensive Player of the Month during December/January.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> It was the first time winning the award in his career. Urlacher was also voted to his seventh <a href="Pro_Bowl" title="wikilink">Pro Bowl</a> for his stellar defensive efforts during the year.</p>
