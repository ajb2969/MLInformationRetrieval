<h1>Joseph Skipsey</h1>
<hr/>

<p>''' Joseph Skipsey ''' (1832 – 1903) was a <a class="uri" href="Northumberland" title="wikilink">Northumberland</a> born poet and songwriter in the middle and late 19th century. His best known work is arguably "The Hartley Calamity" about the <a href="Hartley_Colliery_Disaster" title="wikilink">Hartley Colliery Disaster</a>, a devastating <a href="mining_accident" title="wikilink">mining accident</a> in <a href="Hartley,_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Hartley, Northumberland</a>, <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a> in 1862 in which 220 lives were lost.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>He was known as "The Pitman Poet".</p>
<h2 id="birth-and-early-life">Birth and early life</h2>

<p>Joseph Skipsey was born in Percy Village (generally known after the name of the colliery <a href="Percy_Main_Metro_station" title="wikilink">Percy Main</a>), in the Parish of <a class="uri" href="Tynemouth" title="wikilink">Tynemouth</a> on 17 March 1832. His father Cuthbert, an overman<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> at Percy Main Colliery, and mother, Isabella, had many children, on which Joseph was the eighth.</p>

<p>Joseph Skipsey faced an early tragedy when his father, Cuthbert, was shot dead on 8 July 1832 in the wake of a long and bitter miners' strike. On the Sunday evening, an "affray" occurred between a group of miners and special constables. Cuthbert Skipsey, an overman and someone who the pitmen would look up to, stepped forward in an attempt to defuse the situation. One of the specials, George Weddell, pushed him away and shot him with his pistol. Weddell was arrested, tried, found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to six months hard labour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Like many children of that era, Joseph Skipsey started work in the local pit. He started at the age of seven as a trapper,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> teaching himself to read and write using pieces of discarded newspaper, adverts etc. progressing to some of the classical British authors and then to write his own stories, poems and later songs.</p>

<p>In 1852 he walked to London in his search for work and found employment there on the railways. It was here that he met his future bride-to-be. They returned North and he found a job at <a class="uri" href="Choppington" title="wikilink">Choppington</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and then Pembroke Colliery, near <a href="City_of_Sunderland" title="wikilink">Sunderland</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Joseph Skipsey married Sarah Ann (née Fendley - born ca1829) from <a href="Watlington,_Norfolk" title="wikilink">Watlington</a>, <a class="uri" href="Norfolk" title="wikilink">Norfolk</a> on December 1868 and she bore him five sons (including Joseph b1869 and Cuthbert b1872) and three daughters (including Elizabeth Ann b1860 and who was living at Harraton at the time of her father’s death). The three named children were the only ones to outlive their father.</p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>

<p>His first volume of his own works was published in <a href="Morpeth,_Northumberland" title="wikilink">Morpeth</a> in 1859, a copy of which came to the attention of <a href="James_Thomas_Clephan" title="wikilink">James Thomas Clephan</a>, at that time editor of the "Gateshead Observer", a relatively new newspaper and the first in <a class="uri" href="Gateshead" title="wikilink">Gateshead</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> When told by Skipsey of his dire situation, Clephan obtained a job for him at Hawks Crawshay and Son ironworks in <a class="uri" href="Gateshead" title="wikilink">Gateshead</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> All copies of this publication appear to have been lost,</p>

<p>Following the death of one of his children, Skipsey moved to <a href="Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Newcastle</a> in 1863 and became an assistant Librarian at the <a href="Literary_and_Philosophical_Society_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne</a> for a short time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The job did not seem to suit him, and as the pay was poor, he returned to a job in the pits, this time at <a class="uri" href="Backworth" title="wikilink">Backworth</a>, where he remained until 1882.</p>

<p>On the death of three of his children within the space of a month, he wrote in the family bible: "On October 16th my son Cuthbert died in his fourteenth year, on the 24th of the same month so did my little Emma 1 year and 9 months old and the 30th our dear Harriet in her seventh year leaving us with our Elizabeth Ann Pringle only. The children died from scarletina. Let me say that three more lovely and affectionate children were never born in this world. Their loss has bowed their parents head down to dust of our reflections and their deaths have enlikened the belief that the dear jewels were wrongly treated. Joseph Skipsey. March 8th 1869. Also William - he was killed by a waggon on the Tyne Main Way near Gateshead on 7 September 1860."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>By 1882 he was 50 years old and starting to feel his age, and so when a position of caretaker became vacant at a new Board School at Mill Lane, Newcastle, he applied for, and won the post. This school was very successful and grew in size, until the workload became too much for him and his wife</p>

<p>In September 1888 he moved to the position of Porter at the newly extended Armstrong College, but even this was hardly the job for a man of letters.</p>

<p>He moved to <a class="uri" href="Stratford-upon-Avon" title="wikilink">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in 1889 after he and his wife were appointed joint custodians of <a href="Shakespeare's_Birthplace" title="wikilink">Shakespeare's Birthplace</a>, being chosen from a list of 132 applicants. After less than two years he became disenchanted with his job which (he confided in a letter not to be opened until after his death) involved dealing with relics which had "no definite history" and having to "perpetuate error and fraud" on the visitors and general public. Skipsey's experience probably inspired <a href="Henry_James" title="wikilink">Henry James</a>' story "The Birthplace".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>He and his wife returned to <a class="uri" href="Tyneside" title="wikilink">Tyneside</a> where they lived off his pension, residing, in turns, at the homes of their surviving children.</p>

He was interred in Gateshead Cemetery. Two of his five sons and the eldest of three daughters survived him.</p>
