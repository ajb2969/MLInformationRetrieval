<h3 id="oregon">Oregon</h3>

<p><a href="University_of_Oregon" title="wikilink">University of Oregon</a> head coach <a href="Rich_Brooks" title="wikilink">Rich Brooks</a> hired Bellotti as offensive coordinator in <a href="1989_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">1989</a>. Bellotti remained in that position through the <a href="1994_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">1994 season</a>, when Brooks left to coach in the <a href="National_Football_League" title="wikilink">National Football League</a>, and Bellotti was promoted to head coach starting with the 1995 season.</p>

<p>Bellotti's record at Oregon stands at 116–55. In 2006, he passed his former boss, Rich Brooks, as the winningest football coach in Oregon's history. He led the Ducks to their first four ten-win seasons in school history (<a href="2000_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">2000</a>, <a href="2001_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">2001</a>, <a href="2005_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">2005</a>, <a href="2008_Oregon_Ducks_football_team" title="wikilink">2008</a>). He led the Ducks to 12 bowl games, three more than they had attended in their entire history before his arrival. His best season was 2001, when he led the Ducks to an 11-1 record and a victory in the <a href="2002_Fiesta_Bowl" title="wikilink">Fiesta Bowl</a>. They finished second in both major polls, the highest final ranking in school history. The 11 wins would remain a school record until the 2010 team's 12-win season.</p>

<p>Bellotti also led Oregon to a regular season #2 ranking in the 2007 season, albeit very briefly. After achieving that ranking, the Ducks lost <a href="Heisman_Trophy" title="wikilink">Heisman Trophy</a> candidate quarterback <a href="Dennis_Dixon" title="wikilink">Dennis Dixon</a> to a season-ending knee injury, and Oregon proceeded to lose three straight games to Arizona, UCLA and archrival Oregon State to close out the regular season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Earlier that season, Bellotti led Oregon to a resounding 39–7 victory over Michigan at <a href="Michigan_Stadium" title="wikilink">"The Big House"</a>, earning the Ducks and Dixon much national attention. Oregon also defeated #9 USC and #6 Arizona State in back-to-back games at <a href="Autzen_Stadium" title="wikilink">Autzen Stadium</a> earlier that season. The Ducks recovered from their three-game losing streak following the Dixon injury by defeating <a href="2007_South_Florida_Bulls_football_team" title="wikilink">South Florida</a> in the <a href="Sun_Bowl" title="wikilink">Sun Bowl</a> in dominating fashion (56–21), thus reversing a trend of four straight bowl losses. In 2008, the Ducks recovered strongly from a mid-season lull to win their last four games against solid competition, including a <a href="Holiday_Bowl" title="wikilink">Holiday Bowl</a> win over No. 13 ranked <a href="2008_Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football_team" title="wikilink">Oklahoma State</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Although he only won two <a href="Pac-10_Conference" title="wikilink">Pac-10 Conference</a> titles due to the latter half of his tenure being occupied by <a href="USC_Trojans_football" title="wikilink">USC</a>'s dominance of the league, he is credited with building Oregon into a major football power.</p>
<h2 id="oregon-athletic-director">Oregon athletic director</h2>

<p>On December 2, 2008, shortly after defeating the <a href="2008_Oregon_State_Beavers_football_team" title="wikilink">Oregon State Beavers</a> in the <a href="Civil_War_(college_football_game)" title="wikilink">Civil War</a> to prevent them from clinching a <a href="Rose_Bowl_(game)" title="wikilink">Rose Bowl</a> berth, the university announced that Bellotti would pass the head coaching position on to Offensive Coordinator <a href="Chip_Kelly" title="wikilink">Chip Kelly</a> at some undetermined point in the future and take over as the university's Athletic Director at that time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>During his tenure as athletic director, Bellotti dealt with a number of disciplinary issues involving members of the football program, including <a href="LeGarrette_Blount" title="wikilink">LeGarrette Blount</a>, <a href="LaMichael_James" title="wikilink">LaMichael James</a>, and <a href="Jeremiah_Masoli" title="wikilink">Jeremiah Masoli</a>, and fired long-time basketball coach <a href="Ernie_Kent" title="wikilink">Ernie Kent</a>, whose teams had performed poorly in recent seasons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> After just nine months on the job, Bellotti announced his resignation March 19, 2010 to join ESPN as a college football analyst. Bellotti had agreed to terms with UO officials, but there was no written contract stating his salary and the $2.3 million severance payout. The resignation agreement, including the payout terms, was placed on paper and signed by Bellotti on March 16, with university president Richard Lariviere signing it on March 19. Because of the lack of an initial written contract, the Oregon Justice Department confirmed it planned to review the $2.3 million severance payment from the University of Oregon to the former athletic director.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2009, Bellotti was named third vice president of the <a href="American_Football_Coaches_Association" title="wikilink">American Football Coaches Association</a>. According to AFCA tradition, he would move up to second vice president in 2010, first vice president in 2011 and <a href="List_of_presidents_of_the_American_Football_Coaches_Association" title="wikilink">president</a> in 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
