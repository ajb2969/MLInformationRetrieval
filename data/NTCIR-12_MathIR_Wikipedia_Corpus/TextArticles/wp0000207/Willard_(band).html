<h1>Willard (band)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Willard</strong> was an American rock band from <a href="Seattle,_Washington" title="wikilink">Seattle, Washington</a>, formed around 1989. Though they sought to challenge the grunge image"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of Seattle, they are acknowledged as a part of the <a class="uri" href="grunge" title="wikilink">grunge</a> music scene of the late 80's and early 90's.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Jeff Gilbert and <a href="Tad_Doyle" title="wikilink">Tad Doyle</a> were instrumental in their first record deal which resulted in their one and only <a href="Jack_Endino" title="wikilink">Jack Endino</a> produced album, <a href="Steel_Mill_(album)" title="wikilink">Steel Mill</a> in 1992. They had previously released a self-titled 4 song EP.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After performing an outdoor show for the "Pain in the Grass" Festival at the <a href="Seattle_Center" title="wikilink">Seattle Center</a>, Willard was banned from further performances by the <a href="Seattle_Police_Department" title="wikilink">Seattle Police Department</a> and the City of Seattle. Willard T shirts soon proudly said "Banned by the SPD"! To Willard it was the equivalent of a gold album!.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Their music sounded similar to another Seattle band, entitled <a class="uri" href="Melvins" title="wikilink">Melvins</a>. Steve Wied was the original <a href="Tad_(band)" title="wikilink">Tad</a> drummer before joining Willard.</p>

<p>They disbanded after recording a second record, <em>Bone Grinder</em>, which was never released. Only the demo version of one song, "Larie" was released on a "Seattle Music Scene CD".</p>
