It was localized in North America, Europe and Australia by <a class="uri" href="Activision" title="wikilink">Activision</a>. This game was originally developed by a Japanese video game studio, Climax Graphics, and designed by then Climax CEO, Shinya Nishigaki.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Sixty-five million years ago, a <a class="uri" href="meteorite" title="wikilink">meteorite</a> crashes into the <a href="Yucatán_Peninsula" title="wikilink">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, subsequently wiping out the <a href="dinosaur" title="wikilink">dinosaurs</a> and paving the way for humans. Now, in 2000, an island emerges where the meteorite is thought to have landed, and is granted the name "Dinasaur Island." A <a href="Biotechnology" title="wikilink">biotech</a> corporation then takes up shop on the island. In 2018, Eliot Ballade, an elite member of the ESER (Emergency Sea Evacuation and Rescue) forces, is vacationing near Dinasaur Island when something falls from the sky and leaves the island sealed under a mysterious dome of energy. When a mysterious, ethereal being called Nephilim shows up to chase Ballade, he takes it upon himself to solve the enigma of Dinasaur Island.</p>
<h2 id="plot-summary">Plot Summary</h2>

<p>Eliot Ballade is on vacation off the coast of Dinosaur Island with his friend Billy fishing on a boat. However, a meteorite crashes into the island and sends a large barrier out which cuts Eliot's boat in half leaving him inside of the barrier. Just then a mysterious light approaches and takes the form of Billy's good luck charm "Nephilim", shortly afterward several creatures storm toward the boat and destroy it. Eliot swims to shore. On shore, Eliot is assisted by Nephilim and meets Dogs Bower, an original discoverer of the island and a local sea captain. The two team up as they explore the island and confront the monsters and mutations that have taken it over.</p>

<p>Saved by a woman named Jeanine King, the duo head to the control center of KIMRAs base. There, they meet Jeanine formally and discuss what to do. Dogs suggests heading into town to find survivors and to head to Rats Bar for more information. With no better plan, the two set off. Conquering the various monsters while exploring a shopping center, freezer, and saving several others the duo eventually arrive at Rats Bar. Meeting Rats, the owner, he gives the duo a Lab Keycard he was holding as collateral. The duo reconvene inside the control center and discuss with Jeanine what their next plan of action is. Jeanine attempts to use the keycard to gain access to the secure information inside the computer. However, there is not enough power, and suggests heading to the power station.</p>

<p>Inside the power station, the duo turn the power on after defeating several mutated beetles that were absorbing the power. The duo head back to the control room and Jeanine uses the keycard to access information involving the "Gigadent". However, most of the information is blocked and can only be accessed inside of the KIMRA labs. Using a jeep, the duo gain access the labs and enter after crossing through a clean room. After fighting a large gelatinous blob, Eliot accidentally swallows monster vomit and begins to change into a mutant. Dogs assures Eliot he'll take care of him. Meeting a doctor, the two eventually meet Dr. Jacob the lead scientist on the "Gigadent". Already mutated, Eliot kills Jacob and takes his disk. Realizing that the mutation is from a virus KIMRA discovered on the island, the duo make a vaccine to cure Eliot and escape the labs.</p>

<p>Back in to control center, Jeanine uses the disk from Dr. Jacob to gather more information. The meteor that hit Earth 65 million years ago was actually an egg. Inside the egg is a large dinosaur like monster that the scientists dubbed "Jascony". The virus and subsequent mutations it caused were side effects to allow "Jascony" to easier absorb the planet and move onto the next. Nephilim is actually revealed to be the spirit of the meteorite that hit the Gigadent in order to destroy Jascony, however it hit a satellite and was slowed and slightly altered her course causing her to get jammed inside of the shaft leading to the base of the Gigadent. With this information, Jeanine concocts a plan, using her sniper rifle, she will go to the top of a wave tower near the Gigadent. She will then shoot a pressure release on the shutter the meteroite is jammed on. She sends Eliot and Dogs to her apartment to get her rifle.</p>

<p>At the apartment, Eliot learns that Dogs is Jeanine's father, her mother having died of a disease years ago. Getting the rifle, the duo heads back to the control room. Eliot leaves Dogs and Jeanine alone where to two have a reconciliation. With the plan set, the group begins to head to the wave tower. The quickest route is through a water coolant tunnel. However, the only boat will hold 2 people. Eliot elects to swim since Jeanine is injured and Dogs cannot. Eliot arrives at the tower and climbs the wreckage as the elevator is stuck with Jeanine and Dogs inside. Jeanine begins to line up her shot, and asks the duo to protect her while she sets up. After a rough battle with a seeming never ending wave of monsters, Jeanine shoots the release. Nephilim flies back into the meteor as Jascony wakes up. The meteor pierces Jascony and Nephilim evolves into a similar monster to battle Jascony but loses. The group flees the tower while the two battle, and after arriving on the ground come face to face with Jascony. Utilizing every weapon in their arsenal, Eliot and Dogs manage to defeat Jascony. Nephilim absorbs Jascony, and after a brief moment flies away from Earth. As the barrier around the island fades, Eliot wonders if he'll see Nephilim again, while Dogs assures he most likely won't and the trio leave together. We also see Billy on debris floating in the water alive. He recognizes Nephilim before she flies away.</p>

<p>An after credits scene shows Nephilim in an unknown part of space. She then transforms into a meteor surrounded by more stingers. The meteor launches followed shortly by the stingers. The camera shifts and we see several more launchers, indicating this isn't the first time these events have happened.</p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p>The North American port of the game removed the original cinematic style <a href="camera_system" title="wikilink">camera system</a>, instead using a fixed, behind-the-player third-person view, such as that of <em><a href="Tomb_Raider" title="wikilink">Tomb Raider</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This revamped camera style was met with both critical acclaim and criticism. Some argued that the change took away from the dramatic tension for which the Japanese version had become famous. However, others celebrated the new camera style as a feature that gave the game an edge over survival horror games that utilized fixed angles, such as <em><a href="Resident_Evil" title="wikilink">Resident Evil</a></em>.</p>
