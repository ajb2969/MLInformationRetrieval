<h1>Daifuku</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong></strong>, or <strong></strong> (literally "great luck"), is a <a href="wagashi" title="wikilink">Japanese confection</a> consisting of a small round <a href="Mochi_(food)" title="wikilink">mochi</a> (<a href="glutinous_rice" title="wikilink">glutinous rice</a> cake) stuffed with sweet filling, most commonly <em><a href="red_bean_paste" title="wikilink">anko</a></em>, sweetened red bean paste made from <a href="azuki_bean" title="wikilink">azuki beans</a>.</p>

<p>Daifuku comes in many varieties. The most common is white-, pale green-, or pale pink-colored mochi filled with anko. These come in two sizes, one approximately 3cm (1.2in) diameter, the other palm-sized. Nearly all daifuku are covered in a fine layer of <a href="Maize" title="wikilink">corn</a> or <a class="uri" href="potato" title="wikilink">potato</a> starch to keep them from sticking to each other, or to the fingers. Though <a class="uri" href="mochitsuki" title="wikilink">mochitsuki</a> is the traditional method of making <a class="uri" href="mochi" title="wikilink">mochi</a> and daifuku, they can also be cooked in the microwave.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Mochi and daifuku are very popular in Japan.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Daifuku was originally called  (belly thick rice cake) because of its filling nature. Later, the name was changed to  (big belly rice cake). Since the pronunciations of  (belly) and  (luck) are the same in Japanese, the name was further changed to  (great luck rice cake), a bringer of good luck. By the end of the 18th century, Daifuku were gaining popularity and people began eating them toasted. They were also used for gifts in ceremonial occasions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
