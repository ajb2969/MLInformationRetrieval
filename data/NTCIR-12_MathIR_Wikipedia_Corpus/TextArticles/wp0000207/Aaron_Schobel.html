<p>Schobel earned his first Pro Bowl appearance in 2006. His best season as a pro came in 2006 when he posted a career high 14 sacks. Since the 2001 season he ranks second in total sacks, only behind <a href="Jason_Taylor_(American_football)" title="wikilink">Jason Taylor</a>.</p>
<p>Schobel, a first team alternate for the 2007 Pro Bowl, was called upon to relieve an injured Jason Taylor in the Pro Bowl. This was his second consecutive year in the Pro Bowl.</p>
<p>He started in 116 consecutive games with the Bills from 2003<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> until 2008, when he was on the inactive list for a game against the <a href="San_Diego_Chargers" title="wikilink">San Diego Chargers</a> due to an injured foot. After a team-leading, 10-sack 2009 season, Schobel informed the Bills that he was considering retirement. To add on, new coach Gailey said that he was looking to switch from a 4-3 to 3-4 defense.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was reported by the Buffalo News on May 10, 2010 that Schobel & his wife June had sold their Orchard Park house, further adding to the speculation of his impending departure from the Bills. On July 27, 2010 Aaron Schobel announced he was 70/30 on returning to the Bills.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>On August 4, 2010, the Buffalo Bills released Aaron Schobel. He never signed with any other team; being released instead cemented his decision to retire, which he did on August 16.</p>
