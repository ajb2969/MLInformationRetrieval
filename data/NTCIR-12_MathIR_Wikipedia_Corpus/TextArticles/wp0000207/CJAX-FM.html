It broadcasts at 96.9 MHz on the <a href="FM_radio" title="wikilink">FM</a> band with an <a href="effective_radiated_power" title="wikilink">effective radiated power</a> of 75,000 watts from a transmitter on Mount Seymour in the <a href="North_Vancouver_(district_municipality)" title="wikilink">District of North Vancouver</a>.

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>CKLG was the first conventional radio station in <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> to adopt the <a href="Jack_FM" title="wikilink">Jack FM</a> brand, officially classified as a "variety hits" or "<a href="adult_hits" title="wikilink">adult hits</a>" format. Jack stations play a mix of 1960s to 1990s hits, as well as some current adult contemporary singles. It formerly used the slogan "Playing what we want", promoting itself as having a larger and more varied playlist than other commercial radio stations. In the early days in the 60's when the station was an AM station in North Vancouver - Don North who later went on to become a famous war correspondent for a large US national TV network was the sound engineer. Jack Ammon has a weekly radio show as a keyboards accompanist for singers Gary Lee and Bob Stone.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In 1980, <a href="Selkirk_Communications" title="wikilink">Selkirk Communications</a> launched <strong>CJAZ-FM</strong> at 92.1 MHz FM in Vancouver, with an all-<a class="uri" href="jazz" title="wikilink">jazz</a> music format, transmitting from Salt Spring Island at a power of 100,000 watts. Although overall regional coverage was very good, poor stereo reception in the key Vancouver area led the station to change frequencies and transmitter site to 96.9 MHz and Mt Seymour in 1984, transmitting at 75,000 watts. Low ratings led to a format change on September 15, 1985, when the station adopted an <a href="urban_adult_contemporary" title="wikilink">urban adult contemporary</a> format (the first in <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>), rebranded as FM 97 and the call sign was changed to <strong>CKKS-FM</strong>. This was followed about a year later by a switch to the "<a href="adult_contemporary_music" title="wikilink">adult contemporary music</a>" format and another on-air rebranding as "97 Kiss FM". Four years later, the station was sold to Maclean-Hunter Ltd, and in <a href="1994_in_radio" title="wikilink">1994</a> it became a part of Rogers Broadcasting. The <a href="adult_contemporary" title="wikilink">adult contemporary</a> format would also arrive on <a class="uri" href="CHQM-FM" title="wikilink">CHQM-FM</a>, which dropped its <a href="easy_listening" title="wikilink">easy listening</a> format in <a href="1992_in_radio" title="wikilink">1992</a>, and surpassed CKKS as Vancouver's leading AC station, becoming Vancouver's most-listened-to FM station later on.</p>

<p>In 1988, West Coast Community T.V. Association received CRTC approval to add a very low-power transmitter at 102.7 MHz in <a href="Ucluelet,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Ucluelet</a> to rebroadcast the programming of CKKS-FM.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The call sign for the Ucluelet transmitter (currently <a href="dark_(broadcasting)" title="wikilink">dark</a>) is CIWC-FM.  In December of <a href="2002_in_radio" title="wikilink">2002</a>, the station's adult contemporary format was dropped in favour of <a href="Christmas_music" title="wikilink">Christmas music</a>, followed by the "Jack FM" <a href="adult_hits" title="wikilink">adult hits</a> format on <a href="Boxing_Day" title="wikilink">Boxing Day</a> at 8 AM. It ended the 10-year <a href="adult_contemporary" title="wikilink">adult contemporary</a> war in <a class="uri" href="Vancouver" title="wikilink">Vancouver</a>, which meant that <a href="CHQM-FM" title="wikilink">103.5 QM/FM</a> is now the only AC station in the Vancouver market. Given the "attitude" inherent in the Jack brand, it was felt that the call sign "CKKS" would maintain an undesirable association with Kiss-FM's "soft favourites" identity. As it turned out, in 2001, Corus Entertainment had abandoned the old <strong>CKLG</strong> call sign formerly assigned to one of its Vancouver AM stations (<a href="CHMJ" title="wikilink">Mojo AM 730</a>). Rogers applied to transfer these letters to Jack FM, and the station's call sign became <strong>CKLG-FM</strong> shortly thereafter. This was in part an attempt to trade on <a href="CHMJ" title="wikilink">CKLG-AM</a>'s history as a popular Vancouver music station in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The move was successful, as Jack-FM's ratings increased dramatically, at one point briefly surpassing traditional market leader <a class="uri" href="CKNW" title="wikilink">CKNW</a> before settling into the upper rankings in the Vancouver market. The CKKS callsign was subsequently given to a <a href="Sechelt,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Sechelt</a> rebroadcaster of <a class="uri" href="CISQ-FM" title="wikilink">CISQ-FM</a> in <a href="Squamish,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Squamish, British Columbia</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the <a href="Jack_FM" title="wikilink">Jack FM</a> format was cloned on a <a class="uri" href="Calgary" title="wikilink">Calgary</a> radio station April 1, 2003, on the same frequency as CKLG, and also owned by <a href="Rogers_Communications" title="wikilink">Rogers Communications</a>. That station was formerly urban CHRK (Kiss FM), as the station changed calls to <a class="uri" href="CKIS-FM" title="wikilink">CKIS-FM</a> and later to <a class="uri" href="CJAQ-FM" title="wikilink">CJAQ-FM</a> (after swapping callsigns with Toronto's Jack FM as that station flipped back to <a href="top_40" title="wikilink">top 40</a> as <strong>KiSS FM</strong>). As a result, Jack FM Toronto was the third Jack FM outlet in Canada.</p>

<p>In July 2012, the station adopted the "Playing whatever! Whenever!" slogan. The station also added in more current <a href="adult_contemporary" title="wikilink">adult contemporary</a>/<a href="hot_adult_contemporary" title="wikilink">hot adult contemporary</a> songs from artists such as <a href="Carly_Rae_Jepsen" title="wikilink">Carly Rae Jepsen</a>, <a class="uri" href="Rihanna" title="wikilink">Rihanna</a>, <a class="uri" href="fun." title="wikilink">fun.</a>, and <a href="LMFAO_(band)" title="wikilink">LMFAO</a>.</p>

<p>On May 22, 2013, the CRTC approved Rogers' application to relocate its Whistler transmitter, CKLG-FM-1, from its current location to the <a href="Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="wikilink">CBC</a>-owned tower in Whistler. This relocation will result in a decrease in the average <a href="effective_radiated_power" title="wikilink">effective radiated power</a> (ERP) from 586 to 474 watts (directional antenna with a decrease in the maximum ERP from 1,430 to 1,000 watts) as well as an increase in the <a href="effective_height_of_antenna_above_average_terrain" title="wikilink">effective height of antenna above average terrain</a> from -306.2 to -238.3 metres.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In August 2014, the stations changed its call sign from CKLG-FM to CJAX-FM. The CKLG-FM call sign was transferred to Rogers-owned CIEG-FM Egmont (rebroadcaster of <a class="uri" href="CISQ-FM" title="wikilink">CISQ-FM</a> <a href="Squamish,_British_Columbia" title="wikilink">Squamish</a>).</p>
<h2 id="controversy">Controversy</h2>

<p>In 2005, some members of Vancouver's <a class="uri" href="Indo-Canadian" title="wikilink">Indo-Canadian</a> community accused the station of racial insensitivity with regards to its advertising strategy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The ads in question featured Vijay Chandra, a Fijian radio engineer for the station with a strong Indian accent, singing to promote Jack-FM's "Larry and Willy show".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The complaints stem from a perception that viewers are intended to laugh at Chandra's accent, rather than at the ad copy itself, and that similar lyrics performed without an accent would not be considered humorous.</p>
