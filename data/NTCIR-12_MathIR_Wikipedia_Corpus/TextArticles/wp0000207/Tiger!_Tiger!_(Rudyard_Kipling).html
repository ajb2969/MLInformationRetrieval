<p><strong>"Tiger! Tiger!"</strong> is a <a href="short_story" title="wikilink">short story</a> by <a href="Rudyard_Kipling" title="wikilink">Rudyard Kipling</a>. A direct sequel to "<a href="Mowgli's_Brothers" title="wikilink">Mowgli's Brothers</a>", it was published in magazines in 1893â€“94 before appearing as the third story in <em><a href="The_Jungle_Book" title="wikilink">The Jungle Book</a></em> (1894), following "<a href="Kaa's_Hunting" title="wikilink">Kaa's Hunting</a>". The title is derived from <a href="William_Blake" title="wikilink">William Blake</a>'s <a href="Poetry" title="wikilink">poem</a> "<a href="The_Tyger" title="wikilink">The Tyger</a>".</p>
<h2 id="story">Story</h2>

<p>After driving out the <a class="uri" href="tiger" title="wikilink">tiger</a> <a href="Shere_Khan" title="wikilink">Shere Khan</a>, <a class="uri" href="Mowgli" title="wikilink">Mowgli</a> leaves the <a class="uri" href="wolf" title="wikilink">wolf</a> pack that has raised him and makes his way to a human village to be with his own (biological) kind. There he is <a href="Adoption" title="wikilink">adopted</a> by a bereaved couple, <a href="Messua_(Jungle_books)" title="wikilink">Messua</a> and <a href="Messua's_husband" title="wikilink">her husband</a>, who believe he is their long-lost son <a class="uri" href="Nathoo" title="wikilink">Nathoo</a>. The village priest agrees to this because it will keep Messua's rich husband happy.</p>

<p>For three months Mowgli learns human language and customs such as wearing <a href="Clothing" title="wikilink">clothes</a>, <a href="plough" title="wikilink">ploughing</a>, <a class="uri" href="money" title="wikilink">money</a> and <a class="uri" href="caste" title="wikilink">caste</a> divisions, few of which impress him. He is also disrespectful to the village elders when they tell fanciful tales of the jungle, since he has first-hand experience of what the jungle is really like. This earns him the particular contempt of <a class="uri" href="Buldeo" title="wikilink">Buldeo</a>, the village's chief <a href="Hunting" title="wikilink">hunter</a> who claims that the tiger is the <a class="uri" href="reincarnation" title="wikilink">reincarnation</a> of a lame <a href="Usury" title="wikilink">money-lender</a>. What is not fanciful is the 100-<a class="uri" href="rupee" title="wikilink">rupee</a> reward for the tiger's skin.</p>

<p>During this period, Mowgli regularly sneaks out of the village to meet his wolf friend <a href="Grey_Brother" title="wikilink">Grey Brother</a> who brings him news of the jungle.</p>

<p>To keep Mowgli out of trouble the village elders decide to put him to work herding <a href="Bubalus" title="wikilink">buffalo</a>. One day while taking a break from this task he meets Grey Brother again. The wolf tells him that Shere Khan has returned and is planning to kill Mowgli.</p>

<p>For the next few weeks Grey Brother keeps watch on Shere Khan while Mowgli goes about his tasks in the village. Eventually he meets Mowgli again and tells him that Shere Khan is hiding in a nearby ravine in preparation to attack. Mowgli learns that Grey Brother obtained this information from Shere Khan's accomplice <a class="uri" href="Tabaqui" title="wikilink">Tabaqui</a> the <a class="uri" href="jackal" title="wikilink">jackal</a>, before killing him.</p>

<p>With the aid of <a href="Akela_(Jungle_Book)" title="wikilink">Akela</a>, Mowgli and Grey Brother divide the buffalo herd in two and <a class="uri" href="stampede" title="wikilink">stampede</a> them from opposite ends of the ravine, trampling the tiger to death between them.</p>

<p>Mowgli, who has promised to lay Shere Khan's skin on the wolf pack's Council Rock, sets about skinning the tiger. Buldeo has been told of the stampede by the other village boys, and soon arrives to chastise Mowgli. Buldeo demands that Mowgli hand the skin over to him for the reward. Mowgli refuses, and summons Akela to restrain him.</p>

<p>When Mowgli and Akela let him go the hunter returns to the village and tells the villagers Mowgli is a <a class="uri" href="shapeshifting" title="wikilink">shapeshifting</a> <a href="Magic_(paranormal)" title="wikilink">sorcerer</a>. By the time the unsuspecting Mowgli returns with the buffalo, Buldeo has turned the entire village except Messua against him and they drive him away.</p>

<p>Confused and disgusted by their behaviour, Mowgli fulfils his promise to lay out Shere Khan's hide on Council Rock and dances upon it, singing of his emotional confusion. The pack offers to take Mowgli back, but he refuses to forgive them for casting him out earlier. Instead he decides that from now on he will hunt alone, except for his four wolf-brothers who refuse to be parted from him.</p>
