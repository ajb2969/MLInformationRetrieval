<h1>SULFA</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>SULFA</strong>, short for <strong>Surrendered ULFA</strong>, i.e. members of the group known as the <a href="United_Liberation_Front_of_Asom" title="wikilink">United Liberation Front of Asom</a> that have surrendered to the Indian government.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1990, the Government of <a class="uri" href="India" title="wikilink">India</a> has been attempting to capture members of ULFA. In 1992, a large group of high-ranking leaders and members surrendered to government authorities, thus earning the name SULFA. However,these former members were allowed to retain their weapons in order to defend themselves against their former colleagues. They were also offered bank loans without any liabilities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This loose group of surrendered ULFA members has become an important element in the situation of armed politics and business in <a class="uri" href="Assam" title="wikilink">Assam</a>. Supplied with large amounts of illegally obtained money, the sulfa members conduct what they like to call 'business' with forays into property development,constructions etc. But not all sulfa members have come into such prosperity, as many others lead a life of penury and disillusionment.</p>
