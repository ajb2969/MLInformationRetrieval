<h1>Bocchus II</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Bocchus II</strong> was king of <a class="uri" href="Mauretania" title="wikilink">Mauretania</a>. Son of <a href="Bocchus_I" title="wikilink">Bocchus I</a> (Sosus of Mauretania Mastanesosus), who was dead in 49 BC. In the early years of Bocchus's reign, Mauretania was jointly ruled between Bocchus and his younger brother <a class="uri" href="Bogud" title="wikilink">Bogud</a>, with Bocchus ruling east of the Mulucha River and his brother west. As enemies of the senatorial party, their title was recognized by <a href="Julius_Caesar" title="wikilink">Julius Caesar</a> (49 BC). During the African war they invaded Numidia and conquered <a class="uri" href="Cirta" title="wikilink">Cirta</a>, the capital of the kingdom of <a href="Juba_I_of_Numidia" title="wikilink">Juba</a>, who was thus obliged to abandon the idea of joining <a href="Metellus_Scipio" title="wikilink">Metellus Scipio</a> against Caesar. At the end of the war, Caesar bestowed upon Bocchus part of the territory of <a class="uri" href="Massinissa" title="wikilink">Massinissa</a>, Juba's ally, which was recovered by Massinissa's son Arabion after Caesar's murder.</p>

<p><a href="Dio_Cassius" title="wikilink">Dio Cassius</a> says that Bocchus sent his sons to support <a href="Sextus_Pompeius" title="wikilink">Sextus Pompeius</a> in Spain, while Bogud fought on the side of Caesar, and there is no doubt that after Caesar's death Bocchus supported <a href="Caesar_Augustus" title="wikilink">Octavian</a>, and Bogud <a href="Mark_Antony" title="wikilink">Antony</a>.</p>

<p>During Bogud's absence in Spain, his brother seized the whole of <a class="uri" href="Numidia" title="wikilink">Numidia</a>, and was confirmed sole ruler by Octavian. After his death in 33, Numidia was made a Roman province.</p>
