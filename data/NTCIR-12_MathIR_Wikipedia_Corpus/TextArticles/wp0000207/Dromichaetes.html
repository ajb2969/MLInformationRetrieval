<h1>Dromichaetes</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Dromichaetes</strong> () was king of the <a class="uri" href="Getae" title="wikilink">Getae</a> on both sides of the lower <a class="uri" href="Danube" title="wikilink">Danube</a> (present day <a class="uri" href="Romania" title="wikilink">Romania</a> and <a class="uri" href="Bulgaria" title="wikilink">Bulgaria</a>) around 300 BC.</p>

<p>The Getae had been federated in the <a href="Odrysian_kingdom" title="wikilink">Odrysian kingdom</a> in the 5th century BC. It is not known how the relations between Getae and Odrysians developed. The Balkan campaigns of <a href="Philip_II_of_Macedon" title="wikilink">Philip II of Macedon</a> between 352 and 340 BC shattered the Odrysian authority and the Getae profited of the situation. By the second half of the 4th century, the Getae occupied sites on both banks of the lower Danube and this region flourished as never before. The new <a href="Macedon" title="wikilink">Macedonian</a> conquests, secured with considerable military power, caused uproar in the adjoining territories and thus stimulated the political fusion of the <a href="Getic_tribes" title="wikilink">Getic tribes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>

<p>There is no consensus on the etymology of the name Δρομιχαίτης (<em>Dromichaites</em>). It can be a Greek name (δρόμος "run" + χαιτήεις "long-haired"), a <a href="Thracian_language" title="wikilink">Thracian</a> name, or a Thracian name formed with Greek elements (Δρομο- and Χαιτο-, -χαιτης).</p>

<h2 id="reign">Reign</h2>

<p>Not much is known about the reign of Dromichaetes, his court and his kingdom. The most detailed account is provided by two fragments from the <a href="Bibliotheca_historica" title="wikilink">history</a> of <a href="Diodorus_Siculus" title="wikilink">Diodorus Siculus</a>. But it must be treated with caution, as the interference of <a href="motif_(narrative)" title="wikilink">literary motifs</a> lessens its value as historical evidence.</p>

<p>According to Diodorus, the main residence of Dromichaetes was named Helis. Traditionally, Helis and the kingdom of Dromichaetes have been placed beyond the Danube, in the <a href="Romanian_Plain" title="wikilink">Romanian Plain</a>. Thus Helis was variously located at <a href="Dacian_Fortresses_of_Crăsanii_de_Jos" title="wikilink">Piscul Crăsani</a> on <a href="Ialomița_River" title="wikilink">Ialomița River</a>, at <a href="Mihăileşti" title="wikilink">Popeşti</a> on <a href="Argeş_River" title="wikilink">Argeş River</a>, at <a class="uri" href="Zimnicea" title="wikilink">Zimnicea</a> on the <a href="river" title="wikilink">left bank</a> of Danube, or identified with one of the several earth-walled fortifications from the <a href="Alexandria,_Romania" title="wikilink">Alexandria</a>-<a href="Roşiorii_de_Vede" title="wikilink">Roşiorii de Vede</a> complex. It was also suggested Helis was located in the <a href="Moldavian_Plateau" title="wikilink">Moldavian Plateau</a> in a cluster of fortified settlements dated between the 6th and the 3rd century BC, where two royal treasures were also found at <a href="Cucuteni" title="wikilink">Cucuteni Băiceni</a> and <a href="Mihai_Eminescu,_Botoşani" title="wikilink">Stânceşti</a>.</p>

<p>The Getic tomb at <a class="uri" href="Sveshtari" title="wikilink">Sveshtari</a> (discovered in 1982) in the western <a class="uri" href="Ludogorie" title="wikilink">Ludogorie</a> in Bulgaria is also supposed to have been near the location of Helis; in the vicinity of the mausoleum, the remains of a large ancient city were found along with dozens of other Getic mound tombs. The settlement is situated in a natural stronghold, a plateau surrounded like a <a class="uri" href="peninsula" title="wikilink">peninsula</a> by the ravines of <a href="Krapinets_River" title="wikilink">Krapinets River</a>. The outer <a href="stone_wall" title="wikilink">stone wall</a>, up to 4m thick, follows the edges of the peninsula and defends a territory of about 10 <a href="hectare" title="wikilink">hectares</a>. The inner wall, of similar construction, encloses a roughly <a class="uri" href="quadrilateral" title="wikilink">quadrilateral</a> area of about 5 hectares. The fortified territory was relatively densely occupied by dwellings connected by a thoroughfare network. Dating finds such as <a href="amphora" title="wikilink">amphorae</a> stamps and <a href="coin" title="wikilink">coins</a> indicate that this settlement existed between c. 335 and c. 250 BC.</p>

<p>The settlement enjoyed economic prosperity and sustained active trade relations with the <a href="Colonies_in_antiquity#Greek_colonies" title="wikilink">Greek colonies</a> in the <a href="Aegean_Sea" title="wikilink">Aegean</a> and the <a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Black Sea</a> region. The imported goods were found in abundance: <a href="Attica" title="wikilink">Attic</a> black-glazed ceramics, amphorae from <a class="uri" href="Thassos" title="wikilink">Thassos</a>, <a href="Sinop,_Turkey" title="wikilink">Sinope</a> and <a href="Heraclea_Pontica" title="wikilink">Heraclea Pontica</a> and pottery of probable West-<a href="Black_Sea" title="wikilink">Pontic</a> colonial origin.  It was also an important production center with metalworking, bone and pottery workshops.</p>

<p>In 313 BC, during the <a href="Wars_of_the_Diadochi#Third_War_of_the_Diadochi,_314–311_BC" title="wikilink">Third War of the Diadochi</a>, the Greek colonies of the western Black Sea shores revolted against <a class="uri" href="Lysimachus" title="wikilink">Lysimachus</a>, a former general of <a href="Alexander_the_Great" title="wikilink">Alexander the Great</a>, and expelled the military garrisons imposed by him. Lysimachus besieged successively <a class="uri" href="Odessus" title="wikilink">Odessus</a> and <a href="Histria_(ancient_city)" title="wikilink">Histria</a> and forced them to capitulate. A peace treaty was drawn up in 311, but the siege of <a class="uri" href="Callatis" title="wikilink">Callatis</a> continued until 310 or 309 BC.  No other action of Lysimachus is known north of <a href="Balkan_mountains" title="wikilink">Haemus</a> until the clash with Dromichaetes in the 290s BC.</p>

<p>The evidence for the conflict is incomplete and contradictory, although attested by a number of ancient authors. It was probably provoked by the territorial expansion of Lysimachus and the control of the Greek colonies was perhaps the issue at stake.</p>

<p>The two fragments of Diodorus' history suggest two separate campaigns. During the first the Getae captured <a href="Agathocles_(son_of_Lysimachus)" title="wikilink">Agathocles</a>, the son of Lysimachus, but later set him free hoping to recover the territories lost to Lysimachus. During the second Lysimachus himself was taken prisoner and then released under similar conditions. However <a href="Pausanias_(geographer)" title="wikilink">Pausanias</a>, mentioning the same two episodes, implies they are parallel versions of one and the same event.</p>

<p>The campaign in which Lysimachus fell captive to the Getae is dated by scholars variously between 294 and 291 BC. Lysimachus invaded with significant forces and his offensive enjoyed some early success before ending in disaster. According to <a class="uri" href="Polyaenus" title="wikilink">Polyaenus</a>, Seuthes, a general of Dromichaetes, presented himself as a deserter, deceived Lysimachus and led him into difficult terrain. Attacked by Dromichaetes, the army of Lysimachus was defeated and the king had to surrender.</p>

<p>Diodorus gives our only account of the captivity and subsequent release of Lysimachus. Dromichaetes succeeded in persuading the assembly of his compatriots that the release of the enemy king would bring them greater political advantage than his punishment. Dromichaetes also set out a feast to demonstrate the barbarian ways and the poverty of his people, using different furniture, tableware and food.  He then asked Lysimachus:</p>

<p>Dromichaetes crowned Lysimachus with a wreath and then set him free, after receiving promises of loyalty and friendship and the return of the Getic territories occupied by Lysimachus. As precaution, the Getae held some high-born hostages like <a href="Clearchus_of_Heraclea" title="wikilink">Clearchus</a>, the son of the <a class="uri" href="tyrant" title="wikilink">tyrant</a> <a href="Dionysius_of_Heraclea" title="wikilink">Dionysius of Heraclea</a>. Lysimachus also had to give his daughter in marriage to Dromichaetes.</p>
<h3 id="death-and-burial">Death and burial</h3>

<p>The great tomb in <a href="Ginina_mound" title="wikilink">Ginina mound</a> near Sveshtari is among the most proeminent <a href="Thracian_tomb" title="wikilink">Thracian tombs</a> with its unique architecture and luxurious decoration. It is dated approximately to early 3rd century BC. A painted scene, interpreted as either one of heroization or investiture, points to its probable royal character. The man and the woman buried here were tentatively identified with Dromichaetes and his consort. The unfinished details of its sculptured and painted decoration indicate a hasty and premature burial. The woman was probably murdered to accompany her royal husband in the grave.</p>

<p>The <a href="Roman_citizenship" title="wikilink">Roman</a> historian <a href="Justin_(historian)" title="wikilink">Justin</a> mentions a large army of <a class="uri" href="Celts" title="wikilink">Celts</a> defeating both <a class="uri" href="Triballi" title="wikilink">Triballi</a> and Getae before attacking <a href="Antigonus_Gonatas" title="wikilink">Antigonus Gonatas</a> in 279 BC. Based on this account, Peter Delev argued that Dromichaetes could have fallen in battle against these Celts.</p>

<h3 id="classical-world">Classical world</h3>

<p>The captivity of Lysimachus was echoed in the Classical Greek literature as a <a href="morality" title="wikilink">moralizing</a> story about the punishment of pride and the virtues of barbarians. Diodorus' story of Dromichaetes' banquet for his royal prisoner is probably a <a href="literary_device" title="wikilink">literary device</a>, contrasting Macedonian opulence with Thracian frugality.</p>
