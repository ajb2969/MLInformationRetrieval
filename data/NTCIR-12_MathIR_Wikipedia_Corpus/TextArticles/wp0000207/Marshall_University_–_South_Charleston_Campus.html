<h1>Marshall University – South Charleston Campus</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Marshall University – South Charleston Campus</strong> is a non-residential branch campus of <a href="Marshall_University" title="wikilink">Marshall University</a> located in <a href="South_Charleston,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">South Charleston, West Virginia</a>, which is primarily focused on extension graduate programs.</p>

<p>The institution traces its roots to extension graduate programs offered by both Marshall University and <a href="West_Virginia_University" title="wikilink">West Virginia University</a> throughout West Virginia, and particularly in the metropolitan <a href="Charleston,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Charleston, West Virginia</a> area prior to 1969.</p>

<p>In that year, the state reorganized its extension graduate system. WVU was limited to, except in a few subjects, offering extension programs in the northern part of the state, MU was limited to the four counties surrounding the main campus in Huntington, and a graduate only <em>College of Graduate Studies</em> (sometime incorrectly called the "The West Virginia College of Graduate Studies") was founded. Thllege had no campus of its own, and almost no faculty. It had some offices at <a href="West_Virginia_State_College" title="wikilink">West Virginia State College</a> and offered classed on that campus and at locations throughout the rest of southern West Virginia, drawing its faculty from those of West Virginia State College, <a href="Concord_University" title="wikilink">Concord College</a>, <a href="Bluefield_State_College" title="wikilink">Bluefield State College</a>, <a href="Glenville_State_College" title="wikilink">Glenville State College</a> and other institutions. The college also utilized adjunct faculty drawn from industry in the Kanawha Valley.</p>

<p>The name, which lacked a geographic identifier, as well as the "impact" of a well-known college, was later briefly changed to first to <em>The University of West Virginia College of Graduate Studies</em> and then to the <em>West Virginia Graduate College</em>.</p>

<p>In 1992 the school got a campus of its own, moving to land donated by the <a href="Union_Carbide_Corporation" title="wikilink">Union Carbide Corporation</a> near its research facility. The next year, the state again reorganized its graduate education system, merging the West Virginia Graduate College and the on-campus graduate programs of Marshall University under the name <em>Marshall University Graduate College</em>.</p>

<p>In 2010 the state authorized Marshall to begin offering extension undergraduate programs at the South Charleston location, and the facility was renamed the "Marshall University - South Charleston Campus", and commonly now known as "Marshall-South Charleston".</p>
