<p>The <strong>Charlottetown Festival</strong> is a seasonal <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> <a href="musical_theater" title="wikilink">musical</a> <a class="uri" href="theatre" title="wikilink">theatre</a> festival which runs from late May to mid-October every year since 1965.</p>

<p>Named after its host city, <a class="uri" href="Charlottetown" title="wikilink">Charlottetown</a>, <a href="Prince_Edward_Island" title="wikilink">Prince Edward Island</a>, since its inception the festival has showcased Canada's musical, <em><a href="Anne_of_Green_Gables_–_The_Musical" title="wikilink">Anne of Green Gables – The Musical</a></em>, as well as having sought out and commissioned new Canadian musicals.</p>

<p>Hosted in the <a href="Confederation_Centre_of_the_Arts" title="wikilink">Confederation Centre of the Arts</a>, every year the Charlottetown Festival features some of Canada's performers, designers, playwrights, composers, and directors in a showcase of musical theatre and comedy.</p>

<p>Past Artistic Directors of the Festival include <a href="Mavor_Moore" title="wikilink">Mavor Moore</a>, <a href="Alan_Lund" title="wikilink">Alan Lund</a>, and <a href="Walter_Learning" title="wikilink">Walter Learning</a>. Learning ignited controversy in 1987 when he presented the <a href="Alan_Bleasdale" title="wikilink">Alan Bleasdale</a> musical <em>Are You Lonesome Tonight?</em> a tough look at the life of <a href="Elvis_Presley" title="wikilink">Elvis Presley</a>. Objections to the rough language and adult subject matter were brought up in the <a href="Legislative_Assembly_of_Prince_Edward_Island" title="wikilink">provincial legislature</a>. However, the musical was a success for the Charlottetown Festival.</p>
