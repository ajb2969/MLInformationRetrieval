<p>Warfarin tablets, 5, 3 and 1mg, photo by Gonegonegone, taken this date.</p>

<p>Sorry about the distortion! If you can fix it, please do.</p>

<p>It's in the <a class="uri" href="Warfarin" title="wikilink">Warfarin</a> article but pink = 5mg, blue = 3mg, brown = 1mg. Now also available (in the UK at least) is 0.5mg which are white but I don't have any! :) <a href="User:Gonegonegone" title="wikilink">Gonegonegone</a> 17:24, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC) "</p>
