<p><strong>Homi Jehangir Bhabha</strong>, <a href="Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society" title="wikilink">FRS</a> (; 30 October 1909 – 24 January 1966) was an Indian <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physicist</a>, <a href=":Category:Institute_directors" title="wikilink">founding director</a>, and professor of physics at the <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Colloquially known as "<a href="List_of_national_founders" title="wikilink">father</a> of <a href="Indian_nuclear_programme" title="wikilink">Indian nuclear programme</a>",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Bhabha was the founding director of two well-known research institutions, namely the <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a> (TIFR) and the <a href="Bhabha_Atomic_Research_Centre" title="wikilink">Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment</a> (now <a href="Bhabha_Atomic_Research_Centre" title="wikilink">named after him</a>); both sites were the cornerstone of Indian development of nuclear weapons which Bhabha also supervised as its director.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>Starting his scientific career in <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a> from Great Britain, Bhabha returned to India for his annual vacation prior to start of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> in September 1939, prompting Bhabha to remain in India, and accepted a post of reader in physics at the <a href="Indian_Institute_of_Science" title="wikilink">Indian Institute of Science</a> in <a class="uri" href="Bengaluru" title="wikilink">Bengaluru</a>, headed by <a href="List_of_Nobel_laureates" title="wikilink">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="C._V._Raman" title="wikilink">C.V. Raman</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> During this time, Bhabha played a key role in convincing the <a href="Indian_National_Congress_-_Freedom_Era" title="wikilink">Congress Party</a>'s senior leaders, most notable <a href="Jawaharlal_Nehru" title="wikilink">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> who later served as India's first Prime Minister, to start the ambitious nuclear programme. As part of this vision, Bhabha established the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the institute, began to work on the theory of the movement of <a href="point_particles" title="wikilink">point particles</a>, while independently conduct research on nuclear weapons in 1944.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1945, he established the <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a> in Bombay, and the <a href="Atomic_Energy_Commission_of_India" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission</a> in 1948, serving as its first chairman.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1948, Nehru led the appointment of Bhabha as the director of the nuclear programme and tasked Bhabha to develop the nuclear weapons soon after.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the 1950s, Bhabha represented India in <a href="International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" title="wikilink">IAEA</a> conferences, and served as President of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in <a href="Geneva,_Switzerland" title="wikilink">Geneva, Switzerland</a> in 1955. During this time, he intensified his lobbying for developing the nuclear weapons, and soon after the <a href="Sino-Indian_War" title="wikilink">Sino-Indo war</a>, Bhabha aggressively and publicly began to call for the nuclear weapons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Bhabha gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as <a href="Bhabha_scattering" title="wikilink">Bhabha scattering</a>. His major contribution included his work on <a href="Compton_scattering" title="wikilink">Compton scattering</a>, <a class="uri" href="R-process" title="wikilink">R-process</a>, and furthermore the advancement of nuclear physics. He was awarded <a href="Padma_Bhushan" title="wikilink">Padma Bhushan</a> by Government of India in 1954. He later served as the member of the <a href="Union_Cabinet_of_India" title="wikilink">Indian Cabinet</a>'s Scientific Advisory Committee and provided the pivotal role to <a href="Vikram_Sarabhai" title="wikilink">Vikram Sarabhai</a> to set up the <a href="Indian_National_Committee_for_Space_Research" title="wikilink">Indian National Committee for Space Research</a>. In January 1966, Bhabha died in a <a href="Air_India_Flight_101" title="wikilink">plane crash</a> near <a href="Mont_Blanc" title="wikilink">Mont Blanc</a>, while heading to <a class="uri" href="Vienna" title="wikilink">Vienna</a>, Austria to attend a meeting of the <a href="International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" title="wikilink">International Atomic Energy Agency</a>'s Scientific Advisory Committee.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born into a wealthy and prominent industrial <a class="uri" href="Parsi" title="wikilink">Parsi</a> family, through which he was related to <a href="Dinshaw_Maneckji_Petit" title="wikilink">Dinshaw Maneckji Petit</a>, and <a href="Dorabji_Tata" title="wikilink">Dorabji Tata</a>. He was born on 30 October 1909, in an illustrious family with a long tradition of learning and service to the country. His father was Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, a well known lawyer and his mother was Meheren <http: press29.htm="" press_releases="" www.igcar.ernet.in="">. He received his early education at Bombay's <a href="Cathedral_and_John_Connon_School" title="wikilink">Cathedral and John Connon School</a> and entered <a href="Elphinstone_College" title="wikilink">Elphinstone College</a> at age 15 after passing his <a href="Senior_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Senior Cambridge Examination</a> with Honors. His fathers name, Jehangir, is from Persian (جهانگیر), meaning "conqueror of the world."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></http:></p>

<p>He then attended the <a href="Institute_of_Science" title="wikilink">Royal Institute of Science</a> until 1927 before joining <a href="Gonville_and_Caius_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Caius College</a> of <a href="University_of_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Cambridge University</a>. This was due to the insistence of his father and his uncle <a href="Dorab_Tata" title="wikilink">Dorab Tata</a>, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in <a href="Mechanical_engineering" title="wikilink">Mechanical engineering</a> from Cambridge and then return to India, where he would join the <a href="Tata_Steel" title="wikilink">Tata Steel Mills</a> in <a class="uri" href="Jamshedpur" title="wikilink">Jamshedpur</a> as a <a href="Metallurgy" title="wikilink">metallurgist</a>.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-university-of-cambridge">At the University of Cambridge</h2>

<p>Bhabha's father understood his son's predicament, and he agreed to finance his studies in mathematics provided that he obtain first class on his Mechanical Sciences <a class="uri" href="Tripos" title="wikilink">Tripos</a> exam. Bhabha took the Tripos exam in June 1930 and passed with first class. Afterwards, he embarked on his mathematical studies under <a href="Paul_Dirac" title="wikilink">Paul Dirac</a> to complete the Mathematics Tripos. Meanwhile, he worked at the <a href="Cavendish_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Cavendish Laboratory</a> while working towards his doctorate in theoretical physics. At the time, the laboratory was the center of a number of scientific breakthroughs. <a href="James_Chadwick" title="wikilink">James Chadwick</a> had discovered the <a class="uri" href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutron</a>, <a href="John_Cockcroft" title="wikilink">John Cockcroft</a> and <a href="Ernest_Walton" title="wikilink">Ernest Walton</a> <a href="nuclear_transmutation" title="wikilink">transmuted</a> <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a> with high-energy protons, and <a href="Patrick_Blackett,_Baron_Blackett" title="wikilink">Patrick Blackett</a> and <a href="Giuseppe_Occhialini" title="wikilink">Giuseppe Occhialini</a> used <a href="cloud_chamber" title="wikilink">cloud chambers</a> to demonstrate the production of <a href="lone_pair" title="wikilink">electron pairs</a> and <a href="particle_shower" title="wikilink">showers</a> by gamma radiation.</p>

<p>During the 1931–1932 academic year, Bhabha was awarded the Salomons Studentship in Engineering. In 1932, he obtained first class on his <a href="Cambridge_Mathematical_Tripos" title="wikilink">Mathematical Tripos</a> and was awarded the <a href="W._W._Rouse_Ball" title="wikilink">Rouse Ball</a> traveling studentship in mathematics. During this time, the nuclear physics was attracting the greatest minds and it was one of the most significantly emerging fields as compared to theoretical physics, the <a href="German_physics" title="wikilink">opposition</a> towards theoretical physics attacked the fields as it was lenient towards theories rather than proving the natural phenomenon through experiments. Conducting experiments on particles which also released tremendous amount of radiation, was lifelong passion of Bhabha, and his leading edge research and experiments brought great laurels to Indian physicists who particularly switched their fields to nuclear physics, one of the most notable being <a href="Piara_Singh_Gill" title="wikilink">Piara Singh Gill</a>.</p>
<h3 id="research-in-nuclear-physics">Research in Nuclear physics</h3>

<p>In January 1933, Bhabha received his doctorate in nuclear physics after publishing his first scientific paper, "<em>The Absorption of Cosmic radiation</em>". In the publication, Bhabha offered an explanation of the absorption features and <a href="electron_shower" title="wikilink">electron shower</a> production in <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a>. The paper helped him win the Isaac Newton Studentship in 1934, which he held for the next three years. The following year, he completed his doctoral studies in theoretical physics under <a href="Ralph_H._Fowler" title="wikilink">Ralph H. Fowler</a>. During his studentship, he split his time working at Cambridge and with <a href="Niels_Bohr" title="wikilink">Niels Bohr</a> in Copenhagen. In 1935, Bhabha published a paper in the <em><a href="Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Society,_Series_A" title="wikilink">Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A</a></em>, in which performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named <a href="Bhabha_scattering" title="wikilink">Bhabha scattering</a>, in honor of his contributions in the field.</p>

<p>In 1936, the two published a paper, "The Passage of Fast Electrons and the Theory of Cosmic Showers"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A</em>, in which they used their theory to describe how primary cosmic rays from outer space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler then made numerical estimates of the number of electrons in the cascade process at different altitudes for different electron initiation energies. The calculations agreed with the experimental observations of cosmic ray showers made by <a href="Bruno_Rossi" title="wikilink">Bruno Rossi</a> and <a href="Pierre_Victor_Auger" title="wikilink">Pierre Victor Auger</a> a few years before. Bhabha later concluded that observations of the properties of such particles would lead to the straightforward experimental verification of <a href="Albert_Einstein" title="wikilink">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="theory_of_relativity" title="wikilink">theory of relativity</a>. In 1937, Bhabha was awarded the Senior Studentship of the 1851 exhibition, which helped him continue his work at Cambridge until the outbreak of <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> in 1939.</p>
<h2 id="return-to-india">Return to India</h2>

<p>In September 1939, Bhabha was in India for a brief holiday when World War II started, and he decided not to return to England for the time being. He accepted an offer to serve as the Reader in the Physics Department of the <a href="Indian_Institute_of_Science" title="wikilink">Indian Institute of Science</a>, then headed by renowned physicist <a href="C._V._Raman" title="wikilink">C. V. Raman</a>. He received a special research grant from the Sir Dorab Tata Trust, which he used to establish the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute. Bhabha selected a few students, including <a class="uri" href="Harish-Chandra" title="wikilink">Harish-Chandra</a>, to work with him. Later, on 20 March 1941, he was elected a Fellow of the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> . With the help of <a href="J._R._D._Tata" title="wikilink">J. R. D. Tata</a>, he played an instrumental role in the establishment of the <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a> in Bombay.</p>
<h2 id="atomic-energy-in-india">Atomic Energy in India</h2>

<p>When Bhabha was working at the India Institute of Science, there was no institute in India which had the necessary facilities for original work in nuclear physics, cosmic rays, high energy physics, and other frontiers of knowledge in physics. This prompted him to send a proposal in March 1944 to the Sir <a href="Dorabji_Tata" title="wikilink">Dorabji Jamsetji Tata</a>. Tata Trust for establishing 'a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics'. In his proposal he wrote :  The trustees of Sir Dorabji Jamsetji. Tata Trust decided to accept Bhabha's proposal and financial responsibility for starting the Institute in April 1944. <a class="uri" href="Bombay" title="wikilink">Bombay</a> was chosen as the location for the prosed Institute as the Government of Bombay showed interest in becoming a joint founder of the proposed institute. The institute, named <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a>, was inaugurated in 1945 in 540 square meters of hired space in an existing building. In 1948 the Institute was moved into the old buildings of the Royal Yacht club. When Bhabha realized that technology development for the atomic energy programme could no longer be carried out within TIFR he proposed to the government to build a new laboratory entirely devoted to this purpose. For this purpose, 1200 acres of land was acquired at Trombay from the Bombay Government. Thus the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET) started functioning in 1954. The same year the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was also established.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> He represented India in International Atomic Energy Forums, and as President of the <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a> Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in <a class="uri" href="Geneva" title="wikilink">Geneva</a>, Switzerland in 1955. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the <a href="American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="wikilink">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1958.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="visionary-behind-indias-three-stage-nuclear-power-programme">Visionary behind India's Three Stage Nuclear Power Programme</h2>

<p>Bhabha is generally acknowledged as the father of Indian nuclear power. Moreover, he is credited with formulating a strategy of focussing on extracting power from the country's vast <a href="thorium#IAEA_Assessment" title="wikilink">thorium reserves</a> rather than its meagre <a href="List_of_countries_by_uranium_reserves" title="wikilink">uranium reserves</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> This thorium focused strategy was in marked contrast to all other countries in the world. The approach proposed by Bhabha to achieve this strategic objective became <a href="India's_three_stage_nuclear_power_programme" title="wikilink">India's three stage nuclear power programme</a>.</p>

<p>Bhabha paraphrased the three-stage approach as follows: <mtpl></mtpl></p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<p>He died when <a href="Air_India" title="wikilink">Air India</a> <a href="Air_India_Flight_101" title="wikilink">Flight 101</a> crashed near <a href="Mont_Blanc" title="wikilink">Mont Blanc</a> on 24 January 1966.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="assassination-conspiracy-theories">Assassination conspiracy theories</h3>

<p>Many possible theories have been advanced for the air crash, including a conspiracy theory in which Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is involved in order to paralyze India's nuclear program.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> While an Indian diplomatic bag containing newspapers, calendars and a personal letter was recovered near the crash site in 2012, it was a "Type C" diplomatic bag containing no documents of importance.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Gregory Douglas, a journalist who taped his interviews with former CIA operative, <a href="Robert_Crowley_(CIA)" title="wikilink">Robert Crowley</a>, over a period of 4 years, recorded their telephonic conversations and later published their transcribes in a book titled <em>Conversations with the Crow</em>. Crowley claimed that CIA was responsible for eliminating Dr. Homi Bhabha, Indian nuclear scientist whose plane crashed into Alps, when he was going to attend a Vienna conference and <a href="Death_of_Lal_Bhadur_Shastri" title="wikilink">Lal Bahadur Shastri</a>, who died at Tashkent summit in 1966. Crowley said that a bomb in the cargo section of the plane went off in mid-air, bringing down the commercial Boeing 707 airliner in Alps with little evidence left to be retrieved. Crowley claimed that U.S. was wary of Indian nuclear progress and the defeat of their ally Pakistan, in 1965 war. U.S. was worried that India could well be the chief in South Asian continent along with Russian think-tanks, if India develops nuclear capabilities, thus bringing instability to the region.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

<p> After his death, the Atomic Energy Establishment at Bombay was renamed as the <a href="Bhabha_Atomic_Research_Centre" title="wikilink">Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</a> in his honour. In addition to being an able scientist and administrator, Bhabha was also a painter and a classical music and opera enthusiast, besides being an amateur botanist.He is one of the most prominent scientists that India has ever had. Bhabha also encouraged research in <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, <a href="space_science" title="wikilink">space science</a>, <a href="radio_astronomy" title="wikilink">radio astronomy</a> and <a class="uri" href="microbiology" title="wikilink">microbiology</a>. The famed <a href="Ooty_Radio_Telescope" title="wikilink">radio telescope</a> at <a class="uri" href="Ooty" title="wikilink">Ooty</a>, India was his initiative, and it became a reality in 1970. The Homi Bhabha Fellowship Council has been giving the Homi Bhabha Fellowships since 1967 Other noted institutions in his name are the <a href="Homi_Bhabha_National_Institute" title="wikilink">Homi Bhabha National Institute</a>, an Indian deemed university and the <a href="Homi_Bhabha_Centre_for_Science_Education" title="wikilink">Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education</a>, <a class="uri" href="Mumbai" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a>, India.</p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>

<p>On 13 March 2014, <a href="The_Times_of_India" title="wikilink">The Times of India</a> reported that <a href="The_National_Centre_for_the_Performing_Arts" title="wikilink">The National Centre for the Performing Arts</a> (NCPA) had issued a public notice inviting developers and investors interested in purchasing <em>Mehrangir</em>, the sprawling colonial bungalow at <a href="Malabar_Hill" title="wikilink">Malabar Hill</a> where Bhabha, spent most of his life. The bungalow has a builtup area of 13,953 sq feet and a plot measuring 17,150 sq feet.</p>

<p>After Bhabha died in 1966, his brother Jamshed became the custodian of the Bhabha estate. Being an avid patron of arts and culture, Jamshed Bhabha, who died in 2007, aged 93, had willed the property along with paintings, jewellery, artefacts and furniture to the NCPA, which he had established. Located at a stone's throw from <a href="Hanging_Gardens_of_Mumbai" title="wikilink">Hanging Gardens</a>, the property is estimated to be valued at over Rs 257 crore (as of March 2014) <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> and was sold to <a href="Godrej_family" title="wikilink">Godrej family</a> for Rs 372 crore <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> by the NCPA on 18 June 2014.</p>

<p>The employees and scientists working for <a href="Department_of_Atomic_Energy,_Government_of_India" title="wikilink">Department of Atomic Energy</a> and <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a>, which Bhabha founded, have protested against the sale of the bungalow to private developers as they believe that the bungalow should be preserved as a memorial.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> However NCPA chairman K N Suntook said that such sentiments “were misplaced”. He said that that Homi Bhabha, the architect of India’s nuclear power programme, was only a part owner of the property and after his demise, the property “devolved solely upon his brother Jamshed, who bequeathed it absolutely to the NCPA by his will, which has since been probated”.</p>

<p>Suntook said he was sad that eminent scientists were supporting this movement and that BARC has lot of funds and they could have used that to bid for the bungalow. While there were eight bidders originally, three turned up for the auction. Suntook added that Homi Bhabha was a great lover of culture himself and both brothers would have been disappointed with the opposition to the auction.</p>
