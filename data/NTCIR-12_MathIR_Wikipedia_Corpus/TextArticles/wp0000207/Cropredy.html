<p><strong>Cropredy</strong> ( ) is a village and <a href="Civil_parishes_in_England" title="wikilink">civil parish</a> on the <a href="River_Cherwell" title="wikilink">River Cherwell</a>,  north of <a class="uri" href="Banbury" title="wikilink">Banbury</a> in <a class="uri" href="Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Oxfordshire</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The village has <a href="Anglo-Saxon_England" title="wikilink">Anglo-Saxon</a> origins and is recorded in the <a href="Domesday_Book" title="wikilink">Domesday Book</a>. The <a href="Toponymy" title="wikilink">toponym</a> comes from the <a href="Old_English" title="wikilink">Old English</a> words <em>cropp</em> (a hill) and <em>ridig</em> (a stream).</p>

<p>From 1519 onwards <a href="Brasenose_College,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Brasenose College, Oxford</a> owned extensive land in Cropredy. Manor Farm was built in 1693 and Prescote <a href="Manorialism" title="wikilink">Manor</a> was built in 1721.</p>

<p><a href="Cropredy_Bridge" title="wikilink">Cropredy Bridge</a> on the River Cherwell was the site of a major <a href="Battle_of_Cropredy_Bridge" title="wikilink">battle</a> in 1644 during the <a href="English_civil_war" title="wikilink">English civil war</a>. <a href="Charles_I_of_England" title="wikilink">King Charles</a> engaged the <a href="Roundhead" title="wikilink">Parliamentarian</a> army led by Sir <a href="William_Waller" title="wikilink">William Waller</a>. The battle was a <a class="uri" href="stalemate" title="wikilink">stalemate</a>; the Parliamentarian side suffered heavy casualties but ultimately prevented the King's forces from crossing the bridge. A plaque on the bridge bears the inscription: <em>“Site of the Battle of Cropredy Bridge 1644. From Civil War deliver us.”</em> Before the battle, some of the church valuables were hidden in the River Cherwell; these included the brass <a href="eagle_lectern" title="wikilink">eagle lectern</a>, which was not recovered for fifty years, during which time it was damaged.</p>
<h2 id="church-and-chapels">Church and chapels</h2>

<p>The <a href="Church_of_England_parish_church" title="wikilink">Church of England parish church</a> of <a href="Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)" title="wikilink">Saint Mary the Virgin</a> is built of the local <a class="uri" href="ironstone" title="wikilink">ironstone</a>, which is a ferrous <a class="uri" href="Jurassic" title="wikilink">Jurassic</a> limestone. Parts of the south <a href="Aisle#Architecture" title="wikilink">aisle</a> date from the 13th century. However, most of the present building is <a href="Decorated_Gothic" title="wikilink">Decorated Gothic</a> and was built in the 14th century, including the <a class="uri" href="chancel" title="wikilink">chancel</a> arch, <a class="uri" href="nave" title="wikilink">nave</a> arcades, east window and most of the windows in the south aisle. In the 15th century <a href="Perpendicular_Gothic" title="wikilink">Perpendicular Gothic</a> alterations were made including a <a class="uri" href="clerestory" title="wikilink">clerestory</a> added above the nave, the north aisle rebuilt with new windows, and both aisles extended eastwards to form side chapels.</p>

<p>The church had a clock by 1512, when the vicar, Roger Lupton, left £6 13s 4d in his will in trust for the churchwardens to pay someone to keep the clock running and chiming every quarter hour and the village curfew. Lupton's will prescribed that the wardens be fined 6s 8d <em>per</em> month of £10 <em>per</em> year if they were to fail. A new clock may have been installed around 1700, and Lupton's clock may then have been transferred to <a href="Claydon,_Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Claydon</a>. The later clock was itself replaced in 1831 with a new one made by John Moore and Sons of <a class="uri" href="Clerkenwell" title="wikilink">Clerkenwell</a>, London.</p>

<p>The <a href="bell_tower" title="wikilink">bell tower</a> has a <a href="Change_ringing" title="wikilink">ring</a> of bells. There were six, but in 2007 two new treble bells increased this to eight.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> One of the new bells is named <em>St Mary</em>; the other <em>Fairport Convention Festival Bell</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>St. Mary's parish is now part of the <a href="Benefice#Church_of_England" title="wikilink">Benefice</a> of Shires' Edge along with those of <a href="Claydon,_Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Claydon</a>, <a href="Great_Bourton" title="wikilink">Great Bourton</a>, <a href="Mollington,_Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Mollington</a> and <a class="uri" href="Wardington" title="wikilink">Wardington</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>By the 13th century Cropredy was associated with the legend of <a href="Saint_Fremund" title="wikilink">Saint Fremund</a>, a <a href="Mercia" title="wikilink">Mercian</a> who was said to have been martyred in the 9th century. Fremund's relics are supposed to have been moved from <a class="uri" href="Offchurch" title="wikilink">Offchurch</a> in <a class="uri" href="Warwickshire" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> to <a class="uri" href="Prescote" title="wikilink">Prescote</a>, where they were lost for a time and then rediscovered and moved to Cropredy. They were then moved to the <a href="Augustinians" title="wikilink">Augustinian</a> <a href="Dunstable_Priory" title="wikilink">Priory at Dunstable</a>, probably in 1207, but an association with Fremund remained at Cropredy. There are records of gifts to a chapel and <a class="uri" href="shrine" title="wikilink">shrine</a> to the saint here in 1488 and 1539, and a <a class="uri" href="chantry" title="wikilink">chantry</a> priest serving in St. Fremund's chapel in 1489. During the <a href="English_Reformation" title="wikilink">English Reformation</a> under <a href="Edward_VI_of_England" title="wikilink">Edward VI</a> <a href="the_Crown" title="wikilink">the Crown</a> sold the chapel and its contents in 1549 and it was probably demolished. No trace remains, its site is unknown and it is not clear whether the shrine chapel was at St. Mary's church or elsewhere in the parish.</p>

<p>A <a href="Methodist_Church_of_Great_Britain" title="wikilink">Methodist</a> chapel had been built by 1822. The congregation outgrew it so a larger chapel was built on a new site in 1881.</p>

<p> Building of the <a href="Oxford_Canal" title="wikilink">Oxford Canal</a> began at <a href="Hawkesbury_Junction" title="wikilink">Hawkesbury Junction</a> on the <a href="Coventry_Canal" title="wikilink">Coventry Canal</a> in 1769 and reached Cropredy in October 1777. The canal passes between the River Cherwell and the village. There is a <a href="canal_lock" title="wikilink">canal lock</a> here, and at the south end of the village a wharf was built. This originally handled coal from the <a class="uri" href="Coventry" title="wikilink">Coventry</a> coalfield, and now serves the canal's popular leisure traffic. The wharf was briefly the canal's terminus, until the section from Cropredy to Banbury opened in March 1778. The canal finally reached <a class="uri" href="Oxford" title="wikilink">Oxford</a> and the <a href="River_Thames" title="wikilink">River Thames</a> at the end of 1789.</p>

<p>The <a href="Oxford_and_Rugby_Railway" title="wikilink">Oxford and Rugby Railway</a> had been built from  northwards past Cropredy by 1852. It never reached , but at  it met the <a href="Birmingham_and_Oxford_Junction_Railway" title="wikilink">Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway</a> and thus became part of an important north-south main line. The <a href="Great_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Western Railway</a> took over the O&amp;RR; before it was completed, and opened <a href="Cropredy_railway_station" title="wikilink">Cropredy railway station</a> to serve the village. The <a href="British_Rail" title="wikilink">British Railways</a> closed the station in 1956, but the railway remains open as part of the <a href="Chiltern_Main_Line" title="wikilink">Chiltern Main Line</a></p>

<p>A <a href="National_school_(England_and_Wales)" title="wikilink">National School</a>, Cropredy and <a href="Bourton,_Cherwell" title="wikilink">Bourton</a> School, was opened in Cropredy in 1855. In 1867 it was renamed simply Cropredy School and a second classroom was added. In 1947 it was reorganised as a junior and infant school. Today it is a <a href="Voluntary_controlled_school" title="wikilink">Church of England</a> <a href="Primary_school#United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">primary school</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
