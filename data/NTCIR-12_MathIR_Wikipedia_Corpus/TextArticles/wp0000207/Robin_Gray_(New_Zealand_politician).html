<h1>Robin Gray (New Zealand politician)</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Sir Robert "Robin" McDowall Gray</strong> (born 2 July 1931) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1978 to 1996, and served as <a href="Speaker_of_the_New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House of Representatives</a> between 1990 and 1993.</p>

<p>Gray was born in <a href="Borgue,_Stewartry_of_Kirkcudbright" title="wikilink">Borgue</a>, Scotland. After serving in the British Army, he moved to New Zealand to take up farming in 1952, eventually settling in <a class="uri" href="Mosgiel" title="wikilink">Mosgiel</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>He joined the <a href="New_Zealand_National_Party" title="wikilink">National Party</a> in 1956, and held a number of positions in its internal hierarchy. In the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1978" title="wikilink">1978 elections</a>, he was elected to replace <a href="Peter_Gordon_(New_Zealand_politician)" title="wikilink">Peter Gordon</a> as MP for <a href="Clutha_(New_Zealand_electorate)" title="wikilink">Clutha</a>.</p>

<p>When National won <a href="Fourth_National_Government_of_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">office</a> in the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1990" title="wikilink">1990 elections</a>, Gray was made <a href="Speaker_of_the_New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House of Representatives</a>. After the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1993" title="wikilink">1993 elections</a>, however, the National Party held a majority of only a single seat – as the Speaker could not vote, re-appointing Gray to the Speakership would leave Parliament deadlocked. National therefore offered the Speakership to <a href="Peter_Tapsell_(New_Zealand_politician)" title="wikilink">Peter Tapsell</a> of the <a href="New_Zealand_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a>. Gray was appointed to the <a class="uri" href="sinecure" title="wikilink">sinecure</a> of Minister of State, and also became Associate <a href="Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand)" title="wikilink">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="1994_New_Year_Honours" title="wikilink">1994 New Year Honours</a>, Gray was made a <a href="Knight_Bachelor" title="wikilink">Knight Bachelor</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He retired from politics at the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1996" title="wikilink">1996 elections</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href="Speaker_of_the_New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House of Representatives</a>, Gray was entitled to the title of <a href="The_Honourable#New_Zealand" title="wikilink">The Honourable</a> and became <strong>The Hon. Sir Robert "Robin" McDowall Gray</strong> which is a title he was granted for the rest of his life<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> after leaving parliament.</p>
<h2 id="life-after-parliament">Life After Parliament</h2>

<p>Gray effectively retired following his stepping down as an MP but still makes occasional appearances and commentary at various Conferences around New Zealand. He has undertaken mild criticsm aimed at the <a href="National_Party_of_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">National Party</a> for failing to promote Members interests at conferences to which he achieved a degree of success in ensuring Delegate's had more opportunity for engagement at the formal meetings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Gray also sits as the Founding President on the Board of Trustees for the New Zealand Business and Parliament Trust <a href="http://www.nzbpt.org.nz/about-us/history/">1</a>.</p>
