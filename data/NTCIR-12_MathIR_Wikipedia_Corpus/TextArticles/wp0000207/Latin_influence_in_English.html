<p><a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English</a> is a <a href="Germanic_languages" title="wikilink">Germanic</a> language, having a grammar and core vocabulary inherited from <a class="uri" href="Proto-Germanic" title="wikilink">Proto-Germanic</a>. However, a significant portion of the English vocabulary comes from <a href="Romance_languages" title="wikilink">Romance</a> and Latinate sources. Estimates of native words (derived from <a href="Old_English_language" title="wikilink">Old English</a>) range from 20%–33%, with the rest made up of outside borrowings. A portion of these borrowings come directly from <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a>, or through one of the Romance languages, particularly <a href="Anglo-Norman_language" title="wikilink">Anglo-Norman</a> and <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>, but some also from <a href="Italian_language" title="wikilink">Italian</a>, <a href="Portuguese_language" title="wikilink">Portuguese</a>, and <a href="Spanish_language" title="wikilink">Spanish</a>; or from other languages (such as <a href="Gothic_language" title="wikilink">Gothic</a>, <a href="Old_Frankish" title="wikilink">Frankish</a> or <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a>) into Latin and then into English. The influence of Latin in English, therefore, is primarily lexical in nature, being confined mainly to words derived from Latin roots.</p>
<h2 id="word-origins">Word origins</h2>

<p>A computerised survey of about 80,000 words in the old <em>Shorter Oxford Dictionary</em> (3rd ed.) was published in <em>Ordered Profusion</em> by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that estimated the origin of English words as follows:</p>

<h2 id="early-middle-ages">Early Middle Ages</h2>

<p>The <a href="Germanic_tribes" title="wikilink">Germanic tribes</a> who would later give rise to the English language (the <a class="uri" href="Angles" title="wikilink">Angles</a>, <a href="Saxons" title="wikilink">Saxon</a> and <a class="uri" href="Jutes" title="wikilink">Jutes</a>) traded and fought with the Latin speaking <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Roman Empire</a>. Many words (some originally from Greek) for common objects therefore entered the vocabulary of these Germanic people via Latin even before the tribes reached Britain (what is known as the Continental or Zero Period): <em>anchor</em>, <em>butter</em>, <em>camp</em>, <em>cheese</em>, <em>chest</em>, <em>cook</em>, <em>copper</em>, <em>devil</em>, <em>dish</em>, <em>fork</em>, <em>gem</em>, <em>inch</em>, <em>kitchen</em>, <em>mile</em>, <em>mill</em>, <em>mint</em> (coin), <em>noon</em>, <em>pillow</em>, <em>pound</em> (unit of weight), <em>punt</em> (boat), <em>sack</em>, <em>street</em>, <em>wall</em>, <em>wine</em>. Cognates of virtually all of these English words exist in the other Germanic languages.</p>

<p>Christian missionaries coming to Britain in the 6th century and 7th century brought with them Latin religious terms which entered the English language: <em>abbot</em>, <em>altar</em>, <em>apostle</em>, <em>candle</em>, <em>clerk</em>, <em>mass</em>, <em>minister</em>, <em>monk</em>, <em>nun</em>, <em>pope</em>, <em>priest</em>, <em>school</em>, <em>shrive</em>. Some of these words are ultimately of Greek origin, as much of the technical language of Christianity developed from the Greek of the New Testament and the works of those Fathers of the Church who wrote in Greek.</p>

<p>During this time, the Catholic Church had great influence on the development and expansion of the Old English language. Catholic monks mainly wrote or copied text in Latin, the prevalent Medieval <a href="lingua_franca" title="wikilink">lingua franca</a> of Europe. However, when monks occasionally wrote in the vernacular, Latin words were translated by finding suitable Old English equivalents. Often, a Germanic word was adapted and given a new shade of meaning in the process. Such was the case with Old English <em>gōdspell</em> ("gospel") for Latin <em>evangelium</em>. Previously, the Old English word simply meant "good news," but its meaning was extended in Old English to fit a religious context. The same occurred for the Old Germanic pagan word <em>blētsian</em>, which meant "to sacrifice, consecrate by shedding blood". It was adapted by Old English scribes and christened to become the word <em>bless</em>. Similarly <em>fullwiht</em> (literally, "full-being") and the verb <em>fullian</em> came to mean "baptism" and "to baptize" respectively, but probably originally referred to some kind of rite of passage.</p>

<p>Whenever a suitable Old English substitute could not be found, a Latin word could be chosen instead, and many Latin words entered the Old English lexicon in this way. Such words include: <em>biscop</em> "bishop" from Latin <em>episcopus</em>, Old English <em>teped</em> "carpet" from Latin <em>tapetum</em>, and Old English <em>sigel</em> "brooch" from Latin <em>sigillum</em>. Other words came in, even though an adequate Old English term already existed, and this caused enrichment of the Old English vocabulary: <em>culcer</em> and <em>læfel</em> "spoon" from Latin <em>coclearium</em> and <em>labellum</em> beside Old English <em>spōn</em> and <em>hlædel</em> (Modern English <em>ladle</em>); Old English <em>forca</em> from Latin <em>furca</em> "fork" next to Old English <em>gafol</em>; Old English <em>scamol</em> "chair, stool" from Latin <em>scamellum</em> beside native <em>stōl</em>, <em>benc</em> and <em>setl</em>. All told, approximately 600 words were borrowed from Latin during the Old English period.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Often, the Latin word was severely restricted in sense, and was not widespread in use among the general populace. Latin words tended to be literary or scholarly terms and were not very common. The majority of them did not survive into the Middle English Period.</p>
<h2 id="middle-ages">Middle Ages</h2>

<p>The <a href="Norman_Conquest" title="wikilink">Norman Conquest</a> of 1066 gave England a two tiered society with an aristocracy which spoke <a href="Anglo-Norman_language" title="wikilink">Anglo-Norman</a> and a lower class which spoke English. From 1066 until <a href="Henry_IV_of_England" title="wikilink">Henry IV of England</a> ascended the throne in 1399, the royal court of England spoke a <a href="Norman_language" title="wikilink">Norman</a> language that became progressively <a class="uri" href="Gallicised" title="wikilink">Gallicised</a> through contact with <a href="French_language" title="wikilink">French</a>. However, the Norman rulers made no attempt to suppress the English language, apart from not using it at all in their court. In 1204, the <a href="Anglo-Norman" title="wikilink">Anglo-Normans</a> lost their continental territories in Normandy and became wholly English. By the time <a href="Middle_English" title="wikilink">Middle English</a> arose as the dominant language in the late 14th century, the Normans had contributed roughly 10,000 words to English of which 75% remain in use today. Continued use of Latin by the Church and centres of learning brought a steady, though dramatically reduced, influx of new Latin lexical borrowings.</p>
<h2 id="renaissance">Renaissance</h2>

<p>During the <a href="English_Renaissance" title="wikilink">English Renaissance</a>, from around 1500–1650, some 10,000 to 12,000 words entered the English lexicon, including <em>lexicon</em>. Some examples include: aberration, allusion, anachronism, democratic, dexterity, enthusiasm, imaginary, juvenile, pernicious, sophisticated. Many of these words were borrowed directly from Latin, both in its classical and medieval forms. In turn, <a href="Late_Latin" title="wikilink">Late Latin</a> also included borrowings from Greek.</p>
<h2 id="industrial-age">Industrial Age</h2>

<p>The dawn of the age of scientific discovery in the 17th and 18th centuries created the need for new words to describe newfound knowledge. Many words were borrowed from Latin, while others were coined from Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes, and Latin word elements freely combine with elements from all other languages including native Anglo-Saxon words. Some of the words which entered English at this time are: apparatus, aqueous, carnivorous, component, corpuscle, data, experiment, formula, incubate, machinery, mechanics, molecule, nucleus, organic, ratio, structure, vertebra.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-english">Consequences for English</h2>

<p>In addition to the large number of historical borrowings and coinages, today Latinate words continue to be coined in English – see <a href="classical_compound" title="wikilink">classical compounds</a> – particularly in technical contexts. A number of more subtle consequences include: numerous <a href="Doublet_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">doublets</a> – two or more cognate terms from both a Germanic and Latinate source (or Latinate sources), such as cow/beef; numerous cases of etymological unrelated terms for closely related concepts, notably Germanic nouns with a Latin adjective, such as bird/avian or hand/manual; complicated etymologies due to indirect borrowings (via Romance) or multiple borrowings; and usage controversies over the perceived complexity of Latinate terms.</p>

<p>Most of the vocabulary of pre-school children is made up of native English words, rather than foreign-derived words.</p>
<h3 id="nounadjective-doublets">Noun/adjective doublets</h3>

<p>As with <a href="List_of_Germanic_and_Latinate_equivalents_in_English" title="wikilink">Latinate/Germanic</a> <a href="Doublet_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">doublets</a> from the Norman period, the use of Latinate words in the sciences gives us pairs with a native Germanic noun and a Latinate adjective:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>animals:</strong> ant/formic, bee/apian, bird/avian, crow/corvine, cod/gadoid, carp/cyprine, fish/piscine, gull/larine, wasp/vespine, butterfly/papilionaceous, worm/vermian, spider/arachnid, snake/anguine, tortoise (or turtle)/testudinal, cat/feline, rabbit/cunicular, hare/leporine, dog/canine, deer/cervine, reindeer/rangiferine, fox/vulpine, wolf/lupine, goat/caprine, sheep/ovine, swan/cygnean, duck/anatine, starling/sturnine, goose/anserine, ostrich/struthious, horse/equine, chicken/gallinaceous, cattle/bovine, pig/porcine, whale/cetacean, ape/simian, bear/ursine, man/human or hominid (<em>gender specific</em>: man/masculine, woman/feminine).</li>
<li><strong>physiology:</strong> head/capital, body/corporal, ear/aural, tooth/dental, tongue/lingual, lips/labial, neck/cervical, finger/digital, hand/manual, arm/brachial, foot/pedal, sole of the foot/plantar, leg/crural, eye/ocular or visual, mouth/oral, chest/pectoral, nipple/papillary, brain/cerebral, mind/mental, nail/ungual, hair/pilar, lung/pulmonary, kidney/renal, blood/sanguine.</li>
<li><strong>astronomy:</strong> moon/lunar, sun/solar, earth/terrestrial, star/stellar.</li>
<li><strong>sociology:</strong> son or daughter/filial, mother/maternal, father/paternal, brother/fraternal, sister/sororal, wife/uxorial.</li>
<li><strong>other:</strong> book/literary, edge/marginal, fire/igneous, water/aquatic, wind/vental, ice/glacial, boat/naval, house/domestic, door/portal, town/urban, sight/visual, tree/arboreal, marsh/paludal, sword/gladiate, king/regal, fighter/military, bell/tintinnabulary, clothes/sartorial.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this is a common linguistic phenomenon, called a <a href="stratum_(linguistics)" title="wikilink">stratum</a> in linguistics – one sees analogous phenomena in <a href="Japanese_language" title="wikilink">Japanese</a> (borrowing from Chinese for scientific vocabulary, and now English), and in <a class="uri" href="Hindi" title="wikilink">Hindi</a>/<a class="uri" href="Urdu" title="wikilink">Urdu</a> (<a class="uri" href="Sanskrit" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a>, with many Persian borrowings), among many others.</p>
<h3 id="indirect-influence">Indirect Influence</h3>

<p>It is not always easy to tell at what point a word entered English, or in what form. Some words have come into English from Latin more than once, through French or another Romance language at one time and directly from Latin at another. Thus we have pairs like fragile/frail, army/armada, corona/crown, ratio/reason, and rotund/round. The first word in each pair came directly from Latin, while the second entered English from French (or Spanish, in the case of <em>armada</em>). In addition, some words have entered English twice from French, with the result that they have the same source, but different pronunciations reflecting changing pronunciation in French, for example chief/chef (the former a Middle English borrowing and the latter modern). Multiple borrowings explain other word pairs and groups with similar roots but different meanings and/or pronunciations: canal/channel, poor/pauper, coy/quiet, disc/disk/dish/desk/dais/discus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="opposition">Opposition</h3>

<p>Linguistic purism in the English language is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly Romantic, Latin and Greek). "Native" can mean "Anglo-Saxon" or it can be widened to include all Germanic words. In its mild form, it merely means using existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones (such as using begin instead of commence). In its more extreme form, it involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as ettle for intend) and/or coining new words from Germanic roots (such as word stock for vocabulary). This dates at least to the <a href="inkhorn_term" title="wikilink">inkhorn term</a> debate of the 16th and 17th century, where some authors rejected the foreign influence, and has continued to this day, being most prominent in <a href="Plain_English" title="wikilink">Plain English</a> advocacy to avoid Latinate terms if a simple native alternative exists.</p>
