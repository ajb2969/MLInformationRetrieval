<p><strong><em>Coryat's Crudities: Hastily gobled up in Five Moneth's Travels</em></strong> is a travelogue published in 1611 by <a href="Thomas_Coryat" title="wikilink">Thomas Coryat</a> of <a class="uri" href="Odcombe" title="wikilink">Odcombe</a>, an English traveller and mild <a href="eccentricity_(behaviour)" title="wikilink">eccentric</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The book is an account of a journey undertaken, much of it on foot, in 1608 through France, Italy, Germany, and other European countries by Thomas Coryat of Odcombe. Among other things, it introduced the use of the <a class="uri" href="fork" title="wikilink">fork</a> to England<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and, in its support of continental travel, helped to popularize the idea of the <a href="Grand_Tour" title="wikilink">Grand Tour</a> that rose in popularity later in the century. It represents a contemporary account of the music of Giovanni Gabrieli performed in the Scuola di San Rocco. It was likely the earliest English rendering of the legend of William Tell. It was only twice reprinted before modern facsimiles (1776 &amp; 1905, those including the later trip to Persia &amp; India, where Coryat died), and the first edition is quite rare today.</p>

<p>Coryat (sometimes also spelled "Coryate" or "Coriat") conceived of the 1,975-mile (3,175 km) voyage to <a class="uri" href="Venice" title="wikilink">Venice</a> and back in order to write the subsequent travelogue dedicated to <a href="Henry_Frederick_Stuart" title="wikilink">Henry, Prince of Wales</a>, at whose court he was regarded as somewhat of a buffoon and jester, rather than the <a class="uri" href="wit" title="wikilink">wit</a> and intellectual he considered himself. The extent to which Coryat invited such ridicule in pursuit of patronage and court favor is unclear.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The title, however, implies the use of <em>crudity</em> related to "imperfectly digested" or "indigestible" (<em><a href="Oxford_English_Dictionary" title="wikilink">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em>).</p>
<h2 id="commendatory-verses">"Commendatory" verses</h2>

<p>A custom of <a href="Renaissance_humanist" title="wikilink">Renaissance humanists</a> was to contribute <a href="commendatory_verse" title="wikilink">commendatory verses</a> that would preface the works of their friends. In the case of this book, a playful inversion of this habit led to a poetic collection that firstly refused to take the author seriously; and then took on a life of its own. Prince Henry as Coryat's patron controlled the situation; and willy-nilly Coryat had to accept the publication with his book of some crudely or ingeniously false <a href="panegyric" title="wikilink">panegyrics</a>. Further, the book was loaded with another work, <a href="Henry_Peacham_(born_1578)" title="wikilink">Henry Peacham</a>'s <em>Sights and Exhibitions of England</em>, complete with a description of a <a href="perpetual_motion_machine" title="wikilink">perpetual motion machine</a> by <a href="Cornelis_Drebbel" title="wikilink">Cornelis Drebbel</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Coryat, therefore, was jokingly mocked by a panel of contemporary wits and poets of his acquaintance. At the behest of the teenage prince, a series of verses was commissioned, of which 55 were finally included for publication. The authors of these verses, which included <a href="John_Donne" title="wikilink">John Donne</a>, <a href="Ben_Jonson" title="wikilink">Ben Jonson</a>, <a href="Inigo_Jones" title="wikilink">Inigo Jones</a>, and <a href="Sir_Thomas_Roe" title="wikilink">Sir Thomas Roe</a>, among others, took especial liberties with personal anecdotes, finding Coryat's self-importance a ripe source of humour. The literary men known to Coryate were typically courtiers, or those whom he had met through <a href="Edward_Phelips_(speaker)" title="wikilink">Edward Phelips</a> of the <a href="Middle_Temple" title="wikilink">Middle Temple</a>, a patron from Somerset.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> A full list of the authors (translated from Latin originals) is given in the margin in a 1905 edition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>There were poems in seven languages. Donne wrote in an English/French/Italian/Latin/Spanish <a href="macaronic_language" title="wikilink">macaronic language</a>. Peacham's was in what he called "Utopian", which was partly <a class="uri" href="gibberish" title="wikilink">gibberish</a>, and the pseudonymous Glareanus Vadianus (tentatively <a href="John_Sandford_(poet)" title="wikilink">John Sanford</a>) wrote something close to <a href="literary_nonsense" title="wikilink">literary nonsense</a>. The contribution of <a href="John_Hoskins_(poet)" title="wikilink">John Hoskyns</a> is called by <a href="Noel_Malcolm" title="wikilink">Noel Malcolm</a> "the first specimen of full-blown literary English <a href="nonsense_poetry" title="wikilink">nonsense poetry</a> in the seventeenth century".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Coryat had to take this all in good part. The book appeared with engravings by <a href="William_Hole_(engraver)" title="wikilink">William Hole</a>, and the author received a pension.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Shortly a pirate version of the verses appeared, published by <a href="Thomas_Thorpe" title="wikilink">Thomas Thorpe</a>, under the title <em>The Odcombian Banquet</em> (1611).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
