<h1>Federation of Australia</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Federation of Australia</strong> was the process by which the six separate <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> <a href="self-governing_colony" title="wikilink">self-governing colonies</a> of <a href="Queensland#Colony_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">Queensland</a>, <a href="Colony_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, <a href="Victoria_(Australia)#Creation_of_separate_colony_of_Victoria" title="wikilink">Victoria</a>, <a href="Colony_of_Tasmania" title="wikilink">Tasmania</a>, <a href="History_of_South_Australia#The_Proclamation_of_South_Australia_(1836)" title="wikilink">South Australia</a>, and <a href="History_of_Western_Australia#British_Colony" title="wikilink">Western Australia</a> agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia, establishing a system of <a href="federalism_in_Australia" title="wikilink">federalism in Australia</a>. <a class="uri" href="Fiji" title="wikilink">Fiji</a> and <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a> were originally part of this process, but they decided not to join the federation. Following federation, the six colonies that united to form the Commonwealth of Australia as states kept the systems of government (and the bicameral legislatures) that they had developed as separate colonies, but they also agreed to have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the <a href="Constitution_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Constitution of Australia</a> came into force, on 1 January 1901, the colonies collectively became <a href="States_and_territories_of_Australia" title="wikilink">states</a> of the <a href="Australia" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of Australia</a>.</p>

<p>The efforts to bring about federation in the mid-19th century were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement. A number of conventions were held during the 1890s to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. Sir <a href="Henry_Parkes" title="wikilink">Henry Parkes</a>, Premier of <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, was instrumental in this process. Sir <a href="Edmund_Barton" title="wikilink">Edmund Barton</a>, second only to Parkes in the length of his commitment to the federation cause, was the caretaker <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of Australia</a> at the inaugural <a href="Australian_federal_election,_1901" title="wikilink">national election in 1901</a> in March 1901. The election returned Barton as prime minister, though without a majority.</p>

<p>This period has lent its name to an architectural style prevalent in Australia at that time, known as <a href="Federation_architecture" title="wikilink">Federation architecture</a>, or Federation style.</p>

<p>A serious movement for Federation of the colonies arose in the late 1880s, a time when there was increasing <a class="uri" href="nationalism" title="wikilink">nationalism</a> amongst Australians, the great majority of whom were native-born. The idea of being "Australian" began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a <a class="uri" href="telegraph" title="wikilink">telegraph</a> system between the colonies in 1872. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations which had emerged around the world, notably in <a class="uri" href="Argentina" title="wikilink">Argentina</a>, <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a class="uri" href="Switzerland" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a> and the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>.</p>

<p>Sir <a href="Henry_Parkes" title="wikilink">Henry Parkes</a>, then Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in 1867. After it was rejected by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the <a href="Richard_Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville,_3rd_Duke_of_Buckingham_and_Chandos" title="wikilink">Duke of Buckingham</a>, Parkes brought up the issue again at a conference in 1880, this time as the <a href="Premier_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Premier of New South Wales</a>. At the conference, representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia considered a number of issues including federation, communication, Chinese immigration, vine diseases and uniform <a class="uri" href="tariff" title="wikilink">tariff</a> rates. The Federation had the potential to ensure that throughout the continent, trade, and <a href="interstate_commerce" title="wikilink">interstate commerce</a> would be unaffected by <a class="uri" href="protectionism" title="wikilink">protectionism</a> and measurement and transport would be standardised.</p>

<p>The final (and successful) push for the Federal Council came at a conference in 1883, called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the <a href="German_Empire" title="wikilink">German</a> and <a href="French_Third_Republic" title="wikilink">French</a> in <a href="New_Guinea" title="wikilink">New Guinea</a> and in <a href="New_Hebrides" title="wikilink">New Hebrides</a>. Sir <a href="Samuel_Griffith" title="wikilink">Samuel Griffith</a>, the <a href="Premier_of_Queensland" title="wikilink">Premier of Queensland</a>, drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council. The conference successfully petitioned the <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Imperial Parliament</a> to enact the bill as the <em><a href="Federal_Council_of_Australasia_Act_1885" title="wikilink">Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>As a result, a <a href="Federal_Council_of_Australasia" title="wikilink">Federal Council of Australasia</a> was formed, to represent the affairs of the colonies in their relations with the <a href="Australasia" title="wikilink">South Pacific</a> islands. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join. The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the <a href="crown_colony" title="wikilink">Crown Colonies</a> of Western Australia and <a class="uri" href="Fiji" title="wikilink">Fiji</a>, became involved. South Australia was briefly a member between 1888 and 1890. The Federal Council had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, such as in relation to <a class="uri" href="extradition" title="wikilink">extradition</a>, regulation of fisheries, and so on, but it did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers, or any revenue of its own. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was the first major form of inter-colonial cooperation. It provided an opportunity for <a href="Federalist" title="wikilink">Federalists</a> from around the country to meet and exchange ideas. The means by which the Council was established endorsed the continuing role that the Imperial Parliament would have in the development of Australia's constitutional structure. In terms of the <em>Federal Council of Australia Act</em>, the Australian drafters established a number of powers dealing with their "common interest" which would later be replicated in the Australian Constitution, especially <a href="Section_51_of_the_Australian_Constitution" title="wikilink">section 51</a>.</p>
<h3 id="early-opposition">Early opposition</h3>

<p>The individual colonies, Victoria excepted, were somewhat wary of Federation. Politicians from the smaller colonies, in particular, disliked the very idea of delegating power to a national government; they feared that any such government would inevitably be dominated by the more populous New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland, for its part, worried that the advent of national legislation (see <a href="White_Australia_Policy" title="wikilink">White Australia Policy</a>) would restrict the importing of <a href="Kanaka_(Pacific_Island_worker)" title="wikilink">kanaka</a> labourers, thereby jeopardising its <a href="sugar_cane" title="wikilink">sugar cane</a> industry.</p>

<p>These were not the only concerns of those resistant to federation. Smaller colonies also worried about the abolition of <a href="tariff" title="wikilink">tariffs</a>, which would deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue, and leave their commerce at the mercy of the larger states. New South Wales, traditionally free-trade in its outlook, wanted to be satisfied that the federation's tariff policy would not be protectionist. Victorian Premier <a href="James_Service" title="wikilink">James Service</a> described <a href="fiscal_union" title="wikilink">fiscal union</a> as "the lion in the way" of federation.</p>

<p>A further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies there was the possibility (which eventually became an actuality) that they could be required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.</p>

<p>Even without the concerns, there was debate about the form of government that a federation would take. Experience of other federations was less than inspiring. In particular, the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> had experienced the traumatic <a href="American_Civil_War" title="wikilink">Civil War</a>.</p>

<p>The nascent <a href="Australian_labour_movement" title="wikilink">Australian labour movement</a> was less than wholly committed in its support for federation. On the one hand, nationalist sentiment was strong within the labour movement and there was much support for the idea of <a href="White_Australia" title="wikilink">White Australia</a>. On the other hand, labour representatives feared that federation would distract attention from the need for <a href="reform_movement" title="wikilink">social</a> and <a href="Labor_relations" title="wikilink">industrial</a> reform, and further entrench the power of the <a href="Conservatism" title="wikilink">conservative</a> forces. The federal conventions included no representatives of organised labour. In fact, the proposed federal constitution was criticised by labour representatives as being too conservative. These representative wanted to see a federal government with more power to legislate on issues such as wages and prices. They also regarded the proposed senate as much too powerful, with the capacity to block attempts at social and political reform, much as the colonial upper houses were quite openly doing at that time.</p>

<p>Religious factors played a small but not trivial part in disputes over whether federation was desirable or even possible. As a general rule, pro-federation leaders were Protestants, while Catholics' enthusiasm for federation was much weaker, not least because Parkes had been militantly anti-Catholic for decades (and because the labour movement was disproportionately Catholic in its membership).</p>
<h2 id="early-constitutional-conventions">Early constitutional conventions</h2>

<p>In the early 1890s two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur. An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890. This led to the first <a href="Constitutional_Convention_(Australia)" title="wikilink">National Australasian Convention</a>, meeting in <a class="uri" href="Sydney" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> in 1891. New Zealand was represented at both the conference and the Convention, although its delegates indicated that it would be unlikely to join the Federation at its foundation, but it would probably be interested in doing so at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="the-conference-of-1890">The Conference of 1890</h3>

<p>The Conference of 1890 was organised at the instigation of Parkes. The account of the calling of the 1890 conference usually begins with <a href="Robert_Wynn_Carrington,_1st_Marquess_of_Lincolnshire" title="wikilink">Lord Carrington</a>, the <a href="Governor_of_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Governor of New South Wales</a>, goading the ageing Parkes at a luncheon on 15 June 1889. Parkes reportedly boasted that he "could confederate these colonies in twelve months". Carrington retorted, "Then why don't you do it? It would be a glorious finish to your life."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Parkes the next day wrote to the <a href="Premier_of_Victoria" title="wikilink">Premier of Victoria</a>, <a href="Duncan_Gillies" title="wikilink">Duncan Gillies</a>, offering to advance the cause of Federation. Gillies's response was predictably cool, given the reluctance of Parkes to bring <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a> into the Federal Council. In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Griffith and Sir <a href="Thomas_McIlwraith" title="wikilink">Thomas McIlwraith</a>. On the return journey, he stopped just south of the colonial border, and delivered the historic <a href="Tenterfield_Oration" title="wikilink">Tenterfield Oration</a> on 24 October 1889, stating that the time had come for the colonies to consider Australian federation.</p>

<p>Through the latter part of 1889 the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called. The membership was: New South Wales, Parkes (Premier) and <a href="William_McMillan_(Australian_politician)" title="wikilink">William McMillan</a> (Colonial Treasurer); Victoria, Duncan Gillies (Premier) and <a href="Alfred_Deakin" title="wikilink">Alfred Deakin</a> (Chief Secretary); Queensland, Sir <a href="Samuel_Griffith" title="wikilink">Samuel Griffith</a> (Leader of the Opposition) and <a href="John_Murtagh_Macrossan" title="wikilink">John Murtagh Macrossan</a> (Colonial Secretary); South Australia, Dr. <a href="John_Cockburn_(Australian_politician)" title="wikilink">John Cockburn</a> (Premier) and <a href="Thomas_Playford_II" title="wikilink">Thomas Playford</a> (Leader of the Opposition); Tasmania, <a href="Andrew_Inglis_Clark" title="wikilink">Andrew Inglis Clark</a> (Attorney-General) and <a href="Stafford_Bird" title="wikilink">Stafford Bird</a> (Treasurer); Western Australia, Sir <a href="James_George_Lee_Steere" title="wikilink">James George Lee Steere</a> (Speaker); New Zealand, Captain <a href="William_Russell_(New_Zealand_politician)" title="wikilink">William Russell</a> (Colonial Secretary) and Sir <a href="John_Hall_(New_Zealand)" title="wikilink">John Hall</a>.  When the conference met at the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne on 6 February, the delegates were confronted with a scorching summer maximum temperature of  in the shade. The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation.</p>

<p>While some of the delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic. Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles. Similarly, Sir James Lee Steere from Western Australia and the New Zealand delegates suggested there was little support for federation in their respective colonies.</p>

<p>A basic question at this early assembly was how to structure the federation within the <a href="Westminster_system" title="wikilink">Westminster</a> tradition of government. The <em><a href="Constitution_Act,_1867" title="wikilink">British North America Act</a></em> (1867), which had confederated the <a href="provinces_and_territories_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian provinces</a>, provided a model with respect to the relations between the federation and the Crown. There was less enthusiasm, however, for the <a href="centralization" title="wikilink">centralism</a> of the <a href="Constitution_of_Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian Constitution</a>, especially from the smaller states. Following the conference of 1890, the Canadian federal model was no longer considered appropriate for the Australian situation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the <a href="Swiss_Federal_Constitution" title="wikilink">Swiss Federal Constitution</a> provided another example, it was inevitable that the delegates should look to the <a href="Constitution_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Constitution of the United States</a> as the other major model of a federation within the English-speaking world. It gave just a few powers to the federal government and left the majority of matters within the legislative competence of the states. It also provided that the Senate should consist of an equal number of members from each State while the Lower House should reflect the national distribution of population. <a href="Andrew_Inglis_Clark" title="wikilink">Andrew Inglis Clark</a>, a long-time admirer of American federal institutions, introduced the <a href="U.S._Constitution" title="wikilink">U.S. Constitution</a> as an example of the protection of States' rights. He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was "an instance of amalgamation rather than Federation."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The introduction by Deakin of <a href="James_Bryce,_1st_Viscount_Bryce" title="wikilink">James Bryce</a>'s <em>The American Commonwealth</em> also had far-reaching influence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The conference in Melbourne ended with an agreement by the delegates that the time for federation had arrived.</p>
<h3 id="clarks-draft-constitution">Clark's draft constitution</h3>

<p>A. I. Clark had given considerable thought towards a suitable constitution for Australia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In May 1890, he travelled to <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a> to conduct an appeal on behalf of the <a href="Government_of_Tasmania" title="wikilink">Government of Tasmania</a> before the <a href="Privy_Council" title="wikilink">Privy Council</a>. During this trip, he began writing a draft constitution, taking the main provisions of the <a href="British_North_America_Act" title="wikilink">British North America Act</a> and its supplements up through 1890, the U.S. Constitution, the <a href="Federal_Council_of_Australasia_Act" title="wikilink">Federal Council of Australasia Act</a>, and various Australian colonial constitutions. Clark returned from London by way of <a class="uri" href="Boston" title="wikilink">Boston</a>, Massachusetts, where he held discussions about his draft with <a href="Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr." title="wikilink">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a>, and <a href="Moncure_Conway" title="wikilink">Moncure Conway</a> among others.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Clark's draft introduced the nomenclature and form which was subsequently adopted:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Australian Federation is described as the Commonwealth of Australia</li>
<li>There are three separate and equal branches - the Parliament, the Executive, and the Judicature.</li>
<li>The Legislature consists of a House of Representatives and a Senate</li>
<li>It specified the <a href="Separation_of_powers_in_Australia" title="wikilink">separation of powers</a> and the <a href="Federalism_in_Australia" title="wikilink">division of powers</a> between the Federal and State governments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon his return to Hobart in early November 1890, with the technical aid of <a href="W._O._Wise" title="wikilink">W. O. Wise</a>, the Tasmanian Parliamentary Draftsman, Clark completed the final form of the Draft Constitution and had a number of copies printed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> In February 1891, Inglis Clark circulated copies of his draft to Parkes, Barton and probably Playford as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This draft was always intended to be a private working document, and never has been published.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The importance of the draft Constitution of 1891 was recognised by <a href="John_La_Nauze" title="wikilink">John La Nauze</a> when he flatly declared that "The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Indeed, 86 Sections (out of a total of 128) of the final Australian Constitution are recognisable in Clark's draft.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-convention-of-1891">The Convention of 1891</h3>

<p>The <a href="Parliament_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Parliament</a> proposed at the Convention of 1891 was to adopt the nomenclature of the <a href="United_States_Congress" title="wikilink">United States Congress</a>. This proposal provided the broad outline of a Federal government. Its lower house was to be elected by districts drawn up on the basis of their population, while in the Senate there was to be equal representation for each "province". This American model was mixed with the <a href="Westminster_system" title="wikilink">Westminster system</a> by which the <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a> and other <a href="minister_(government)" title="wikilink">ministers</a> would be appointed by the representative of the <a href="British_Crown" title="wikilink">British Crown</a> from among the members of the <a href="political_party" title="wikilink">political party</a> holding a majority in the lower House.</p>

<p>Griffith identified with great clarity at the Sydney Convention perhaps the greatest problem of all: how to structure the relationship between the lower and upper houses within the Federal Parliament. The main division of opinion centred on the contention of <a href="Alfred_Deakin" title="wikilink">Alfred Deakin</a>, that the lower house must be supreme, as opposed to the views of Barton, <a href="John_Cockburn_(Australian_politician)" title="wikilink">John Cockburn</a> and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential. Griffith himself recommended that the doctrine of responsible government should be left open, or substantially modified to accord with the Federal structure.</p>

<p>Over the Easter weekend in 1891, Griffith edited Clark's draft aboard the Queensland Government's steam yacht <em><a href="Lucinda_(steam_yacht)" title="wikilink">Lucinda</a></em>. (Clark was not present, as he was ill with influenza in Sydney). Griffith's draft Constitution was submitted to colonial parliaments but it lapsed in <a href="New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">New South Wales</a>, after which the other colonies were unwilling to proceed.</p>
<h2 id="later-constitutional-conventions">Later constitutional conventions</h2>

<p>The revival of the federal movement stemmed from the growth of federal leagues and nationalist organisations that were committed to federation, such as the <a href="Australian_Natives'_Association" title="wikilink">Australian Natives' Association</a>. There were two so-called People's Conventions held in <a class="uri" href="Corowa" title="wikilink">Corowa</a> and <a href="Bathurst,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Bathurst</a>.  In 1893 <a href="John_Quick_(politician)" title="wikilink">John Quick</a>, who had attended the Corowa convention, drew up a bill which became the basis of discussion at the Adelaide Convention (see below) and is considered to have contributed largely to the eventual constitution. Quick with <a href="Robert_Garran" title="wikilink">Robert Garran</a> went on to publish <em>The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth</em> in 1901, which is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative works on the Australian Constitution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1895 a proposal was accepted by the premiers of the Australian colonies to establish a new Convention by popular vote, with the resulting draft of the constitution being submitted to the electors of each colony in a <a class="uri" href="referendum" title="wikilink">referendum</a>. The Convention held meetings over the course of a year, beginning first in <a class="uri" href="Adelaide" title="wikilink">Adelaide</a> in 1897, later meeting in Sydney, and culminating in Melbourne in March 1898. After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial Parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging Bill and to suggest changes. The basic principles discussed in 1891 were adopted, with the addition of the principle of <a href="responsible_government" title="wikilink">responsible government</a>. There was also a consensus for more democracy in the constitutional structure. It was agreed that the Senate should be chosen by popular vote with the voters in each State acting as one electorate.</p>

<p>A draft bill was drawn up in 1898, and then sent to each colony to be ratified by the electorate. Referendums were held in four of the colonies in June 1898. There were majority votes in all four of them. However, it failed because the "yes" vote total of 80,000 had not been not reached in New South Wales. In June 1899, the referendum was held again in all the colonies except for <a href="Western_Australia" title="wikilink">Western Australia</a>, where the vote was not held until the following year. The majority vote was "yes" in all the colonies.</p>

<p>The Bill as accepted by the colonies went to Britain for ratification by the British Parliament.</p>
<h2 id="the-federal-constitution">The Federal Constitution</h2>

<p>    The <em>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (UK)</em> was passed on 5 July 1900 and given <a href="Royal_Assent" title="wikilink">Royal Assent</a> by <a href="Queen_Victoria" title="wikilink">Queen Victoria</a> on 9 July 1900. It was proclaimed on 1 January 1901 in <a href="Centennial_Park,_New_South_Wales" title="wikilink">Centennial Park</a>, Sydney. Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim <a href="Prime_Minister_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Prime Minister</a>, leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.</p>

<p>The new constitution established a <a class="uri" href="bicameral" title="wikilink">bicameral</a> Parliament, containing a <a href="Australian_Senate" title="wikilink">Senate</a> and a <a href="Australian_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">House of Representatives</a>. The office of <a href="Governor-General_of_Australia" title="wikilink">Governor-General</a> was established as the Queen's representative; initially, this person was considered a representative of the British government. The Constitution also established a <a href="High_Court_of_Australia" title="wikilink">High Court</a>, and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government.</p>

<p>The site of a federal capital was disputed heavily between the two arch-rivals <a class="uri" href="Sydney" title="wikilink">Sydney</a> and <a class="uri" href="Melbourne" title="wikilink">Melbourne</a>; the compromise was that a separate territory (the <a href="Australian_Capital_Territory" title="wikilink">Australian Capital Territory</a>) would be established within New South Wales to hold a new capital, while Parliament would sit in Melbourne until the new city was constructed. The site eventually chosen for the city became <a class="uri" href="Canberra" title="wikilink">Canberra</a>.</p>
