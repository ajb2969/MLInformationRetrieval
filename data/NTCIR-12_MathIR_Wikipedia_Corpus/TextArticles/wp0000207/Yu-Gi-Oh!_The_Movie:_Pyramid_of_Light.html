<p><strong><em>Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light</em></strong>, later released in Japan as  is a 2004 Japanese-American <a href="Anime_film" title="wikilink">anime</a> <a href="Adventure_film" title="wikilink">adventure</a> <a href="fantasy_film" title="wikilink">fantasy film</a> produced by <a href="Nihon_Ad_Systems" title="wikilink">Nihon Ad Systems</a> based on the <em><a href="Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters" title="wikilink">Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters</a></em> TV series.</p>

<p>The film was released in the United States before Japan, as it was commissioned by <a href="4Licensing_Corporation" title="wikilink">4Kids Entertainment</a>, and was released in theaters in 13 August 2004. The characters are the same as the English release of the <em>Duel Monsters</em> television show and their names retain their regional changes (i.e., Téa is Anzu in the Japanese version and Téa in all other versions). Unlike the TV series, the cards retain their appearance to their <a href="Yu-Gi-Oh!_Trading_Card_Game" title="wikilink">real world counterparts</a> in the English version. The film was released in Japan in 3 November 2004 and aired on TV Tokyo on 2 January 2005, which utilized the names, original sound effects and original soundtrack from the Japanese anime and featured twelve minutes of additional animation.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p>The story takes places in the middle of the <a href="Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters" title="wikilink">second anime</a>, between the <a href="List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters_episodes_(season_3)" title="wikilink">third</a> and the <a href="List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters_episodes_(season_4)" title="wikilink">fourth</a> seasons, according to original chronology in Japan.</p>

<p>The film starts telling the five thousand years story of a brave Pharaoh who killed and imprisoned <a href="List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_characters#Anubis" title="wikilink">Anubis</a> the Egyptian god of death after he tried to destroy the world by persuading the kings to play the forbidden and devastating Shadow Games. In the present day, Anubis' tomb is uncovered by archaeologists, amazed with his most valuable treasure, the Pyramid of Light. A devastating spiritual force unleashes from the relic and liberates the Egyptian god. Anubis, now free, is willing to conclude his plan.</p>

<p>Moving ahead to the present, the Battle City, a Duel Monsters card game tournament has concluded, and <a href="Yugi_Mutou" title="wikilink">Yugi Mutou</a> has achieved international fame by defeating his rival <a href="Seto_Kaiba" title="wikilink">Seto Kaiba</a> and obtaining the three powerful Egyptian God Cards. Determined to defeat Yugi, Kaiba turns to <a href="Maximillion_Pegasus" title="wikilink">Maximillion Pegasus</a>, the now retired creator of Duel Monsters, in order to obtain any new cards designed to defeat the god cards. Pegasus says he has the card Kaiba is searching for, but will only give it to Kaiba if defeated in a duel. Then the two duel with Kaiba winning and taking two cards, although Pegasus claims he only created one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yugi and <a href="Téa_Gardner" title="wikilink">Téa Gardner</a> go to the local museum where Anubis' corpse and the Pyramid of Light are on display, meeting up with Yugi's Grandpa, who reads a prophecy describing a clairvoyant eye which will prevent the world's destruction if blinded. Anubis' spirit attacks the group with Yugi having a vision of Anubis himself manipulating Kaiba and him in a Shadow Game death match. He awakens to find Anubis and the Pyramid of Light missing. Kaiba's brother Mokuba arrives, and Yugi is taken to Kaiba's duel dome with his friends <a href="Joey_Wheeler" title="wikilink">Joey Wheeler</a> and <a href="Tristan_Taylor" title="wikilink">Tristan Taylor</a> in pursuit. Kaiba arrogantly and ignorantly forces Yami Yugi into a duel, unaware that Anubis is manipulating him into using one of the two new cards, <em>Pyramid of Light</em>, which covers the field in a huge replica of the actual pyramid and destroys the God Cards. Yugi, Joey and Tristan are sucked into the pyramid while Mokuba flees the crumbling building.</p>

<p>Yugi, Joey, and Tristan awaken within the Millennium Puzzle, finding Anubis' tomb within. Anubis reveals that his monsters will destroy the modern world. Yami Yugi and Kaiba continue their duel, each blow to their in-game Life Points actually draining away their physical energy. To make matters worse, Kaiba manages to eliminate half of Yami Yugi's deck through Deck Destruction Virus, leaving him with barely any cards. Kaiba uses the second new card, the <em>Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon</em>, to destroy Yami's last monster and dropping his Life Points to 200. Téa, Solomon, and Mokuba escape the collapsing dome in Pegasus' helicopter, Pegasus having figured out what is going on. Téa's soul is sent into the Millennium Puzzle to aid Yugi, Joey and Tristan. Yugi finds the Dagger of Fate within Anubis' tomb, and uses it to destroy the all-seeing eye in the tomb as per the prophecy.</p>

<p>Anubis materializes behind Kaiba as he tries to alter the duel's path, casting him aside and taking command of the duel. Yami, reunited with Yugi, destroys the Pyramid of Light card with the <em>Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon</em> and then uses Kaiba's planned strategy to summon the God Cards and end the duel by destroying Anubis. However, Anubis revealed his true form, The End of Anubis. This proves to be his undoing when Yugi and Yami summon the <em>Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon</em> to seal Anubis. Kaiba departs promising to defeat Yugi, Yugi thanking Yami and his friends for their help and companionship.</p>
