<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p>Arthur (<a href="Ken_Campbell_(actor)" title="wikilink">Ken Campbell</a>) and George (<a href="Vas_Blackwood" title="wikilink">Vas Blackwood</a>), who discover a tunnel in one of the walls that neither of them is familiar with. Arthur enters and George follows. He soon discovers Arthur, injured and in a state of shock. Moments later, a similarly injured young woman jumps out in front of them, crying for help, only to be pulled back into the darkness.</p>

<p>The focus then shifts to a young German woman, Kate (<a href="Franka_Potente" title="wikilink">Franka Potente</a>), at a party. After hearing that her friend, Gemma, went to another party with George without her even though they planned to go together, she decides to travel there. She heads to <a href="Charing_Cross_tube_station" title="wikilink">Charing Cross tube station</a>, but soon falls asleep on the platform while waiting for the train. When she awakens, she is alone and finds the entire station locked up for the night. Another empty train arrives and she boards it, but it stops abruptly.</p>

<p>Kate flees from the train and runs into a homeless couple, Jimmy (Paul Rattray) and Mandy (Kelly Scott), and their dog, a <a href="Jack_Russell_terrier" title="wikilink">Jack Russell terrier</a> called Ray. Kate explains what has happened and Jimmy reluctantly agrees to help her after she pays him. Meanwhile, Mandy is also attacked while alone. Kate flees into the sewer system below the station, but is soon captured by the killer; a hideously deformed, <a href="mentally_ill" title="wikilink">mentally ill</a> <a class="uri" href="hermit" title="wikilink">hermit</a> named "Craig" AKA The Creep (<a href="Sean_Harris" title="wikilink">Sean Harris</a>).</p>

<p>Tattered and filthy, she collapses on a platform and Ray appears, curling onto her lap. The film ends when a man waiting for a train puts a coin next to her, thinking she is a beggar, and she breaks into hysterical giggles and tears.</p>

<p>The storyline has been compared to the 1972 film <em><a href="Death_Line" title="wikilink">Death Line</a></em>, also set on the London Underground and featuring a <a href="cannibalism" title="wikilink">cannibalistic</a> killer. Director Smith, who had not seen <em>Death Line</em>, attributes his inspiration to a scene in <em><a href="An_American_Werewolf_in_London" title="wikilink">An American Werewolf in London</a></em> set in the London Underground.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>

<p><em>Creep</em> has received generally mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 43% 'rotten' rating on <a href="review_aggregator" title="wikilink">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Rotten_Tomatoes" title="wikilink">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 14 reviews.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p><em><a href="Time_Out_(company)" title="wikilink">Time Out</a></em> gave the film a negative review, writing, "this London Underground-set slasher squanders a promising premise [...] for trashy shocks, old-school nastiness and a fistful of genre clichés. "<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="AllRovi" title="wikilink">AllMovie</a>'s review was favourable, writing, "this pared-down shocker might be light on plot, but it's packed with creepy frights and psychopathic attitude from its mean main monster. "<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Matthew Turner <em>ViewLondon</em> said "The performances are good, particularly Potente, who avoids scream queen clichés by making her character surprisingly unlikeable - Kate is rude and arrogant in her early scenes and the fact that she's German is, of course, a coincidence."</p>
