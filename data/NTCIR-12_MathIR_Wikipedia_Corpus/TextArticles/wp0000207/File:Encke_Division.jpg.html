<p>An intriguing knotted ringlet within the Encke Gap is the main attraction in this <a href="Cassini-Huygens_Mission" title="wikilink">Cassini</a> image. The Encke Gap is a small division near the outer edge of Saturn's rings that is about 300 kilometers (190 miles) wide. The tiny moon <a href="Pan_(moon)" title="wikilink">Pan</a> (20 kilometers, or 12 miles across) orbits within the gap and maintains it. Many waves produced by orbiting moons are visible.</p>

<p>The image was taken in <a href="visible_light" title="wikilink">visible light</a> with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on October 29, 2004, at a distance of about 807,000 kilometers (501,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) per pixel.</p>
