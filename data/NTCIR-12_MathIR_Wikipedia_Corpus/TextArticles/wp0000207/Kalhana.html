<h1>Kalhana</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Kalhana</strong> (sometimes spelled <strong>Kalhan</strong> or <strong>Kalhan'a</strong>) (c. 12th century), a <a href="Kashmiri_people" title="wikilink">Kashmiri</a>, was the author of <em><a class="uri" href="Rajatarangini" title="wikilink">Rajatarangini</a></em> (<em>River of Kings</em>), an account of the <a href="History_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir" title="wikilink">history of Kashmir</a>. He wrote the work in <a class="uri" href="Sanskrit" title="wikilink">Sanskrit</a> between 1148 and 1149.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> All information regarding his life has to be deduced from his own writing, a major scholar of which is <a href="Mark_Aurel_Stein" title="wikilink">Mark Aurel Stein</a>. Robin Donkin has argued that with the exception of Kalhana, "there are no [native Indian] literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed much sense of place, before the thirteenth century".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>Kalhana was born to a Kashmiri minister, Canpaka, who probably served king Harsa of the <a href="Lohara_dynasty" title="wikilink">Lohara dynasty</a>. It is possible that his birthplace was <a class="uri" href="Parihasapura" title="wikilink">Parihasapura</a> and his birth would have been very early in the 12th century. It is extremely likely that he was of the Hindu <a class="uri" href="Brahmin" title="wikilink">Brahmin</a> <a class="uri" href="caste" title="wikilink">caste</a>, suggested in particular by his knowledge of Sanskrit. The introductory verses to each of the eight Books in his <em>Rajatarangini</em> are prefaced with prayers to <a class="uri" href="Shiva" title="wikilink">Shiva</a>, a Hindu deity. In common with many Hindus in Kashmir at that time, he was also sympathetic to Buddhism, and Buddhists tended to reciprocate this feeling towards Hindus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Even in relatively modern times, Buddha's birthday has been a notable event for Kashmiri Brahmins and well before Kalhana's time Buddha had been accepted by Hindus as an <a class="uri" href="avatar" title="wikilink">avatar</a> of <a class="uri" href="Vishnu" title="wikilink">Vishnu</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Kalhana was familiar with earlier epics such as the <em>Vikramankadevacharita</em> of <a class="uri" href="Bilhana" title="wikilink">Bilhana</a>, the <em><a class="uri" href="Ramayana" title="wikilink">Ramayana</a></em> and the <em><a class="uri" href="Mahabharata" title="wikilink">Mahabharata</a></em>, to all of which he alludes in his own writings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> However, his own writings did not employ what Stein has described as "the very redundant praise and flattery which by custom and literary tradition Indian authors feel obliged to bestow on their patrons". From this comes Stein's deduction that Kalhana was not a part of the circle surrounding Jayasimha, the ruling monarch at the time when he was writing the <em>Rajatarangini</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
