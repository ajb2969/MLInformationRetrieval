<h1>Nu‘uanu Pali</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Nuuanu Pali</strong> is a section of the windward cliff (<em>pali<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></em> in <a href="Hawaiian_language" title="wikilink">Hawaiian</a>) of the <a href="Koolau_Range" title="wikilink">Koolau</a> mountain located at the head of Nuuanu Valley<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the island of <a href="Oahu" title="wikilink">Oahu</a>. It has a panoramic view of the windward (northeast) coast of Oahu. The Pali Highway (<a href="Hawaii_State_Highway_61" title="wikilink">Hawaii State Highway 61</a>) connecting <a href="Kailua,_Honolulu_County,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kailua</a>/<a href="Kāne'ohe,_Hawai'i" title="wikilink">Kāneohe</a> with downtown <a class="uri" href="Honolulu" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> runs through the <a href="Nu‘uanu_Pali_Tunnels" title="wikilink">Nuuanu Pali Tunnels</a> bored into the cliffside.</p>

<p>The area is also the location of the Nuuanu Freshwater Fish Refuge<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and the Nuuanu Reservoir<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in the jurisdiction of the <a href="Hawai'i_Department_of_Land_and_Natural_Resources" title="wikilink">Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Nuuanu Pali State Wayside</strong> is a lookout above the tunnels where there is a panoramic view of the Oahu's windward side with views of Kāneohe, <a href="Kāne'ohe_Bay" title="wikilink">Kāneohe Bay</a>, and Kailua. It is also well known for strong <a href="trade_wind" title="wikilink">trade winds</a> that blow through the pass (now bypassed by the <a href="Nu‘uanu_Pali_Tunnels" title="wikilink">Nuuanu Pali Tunnels</a>).</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> The Nuuanu Pali has been a vital pass from <a href="ancient_Hawaii" title="wikilink">ancient times</a> to the present because it is a low, traversable section of the <a href="Koʻolau_Range" title="wikilink">Koolau mountain range</a> that connects the leeward side of the mountains, <a class="uri" href="Honolulu" title="wikilink">Honolulu</a> to the windward side, <a href="Kailua,_Honolulu_County,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kailua</a> and <a href="Kaneohe,_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kāneohe</a>. The route drew settlers who formed villages in the area and populated Nuuanu Valley for a thousand years.</p>

<p>The Nuuanu Pali was the site of the <a href="Battle_of_Nu'uanu" title="wikilink">Battle of Nuuanu</a>, one of the bloodiest battles in Hawaiian history, in which <a href="Kamehameha_I_of_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Kamehameha I</a> conquered the island of Oahu, bringing it under his rule. In 1795 <a href="Kamehameha_I" title="wikilink">Kamehameha I</a> sailed from his home island of <a href="Hawaii_(island)" title="wikilink">Hawaii</a> with an army of 10,000 warriors, including a handful of non-Hawaiian foreigners. After conquering the islands of <a class="uri" href="Maui" title="wikilink">Maui</a> and <a href="Molokai" title="wikilink">Molokai</a>, he moved on to Oahu. The pivotal battle for the island occurred in Nuuanu Valley, where the defenders of Oahu, led by <a class="uri" href="Kalanikūpule" title="wikilink">Kalanikūpule</a>, were driven back up into the valley where they were trapped above the cliff. More than 400 of Kalanikūpule's soldiers were driven off the edge of the 1,000-foot cliff to their deaths.</p>

<p>In 1845 the first road was built over the Nuuanu Pali, to connect Windward Oahu with Honolulu. In 1898, as this road was developed into a highway, workers found 800 human skulls—believed to be the remains of the warriors who fell to their deaths from the cliff above.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> This road was later replaced by the <a href="Hawaii_Route_61" title="wikilink">Pali Highway</a> and the <a href="Nu‘uanu_Pali_Tunnels" title="wikilink">Nuuanu Pali Tunnels</a> in 1959, which is the route used today.</p>

<p>The now extinct bird, the <a href="Oʻahu_Nukupuʻu" title="wikilink">Oahu nukupuu</a>, was last collected in this valley. </p>
<h2 id="nuuanu-reservoir">Nuuanu Reservoir</h2>

<p>The Nuuanu Reservoir is is located up the Nuuanu Pali heading towards Kailua, in the valley jungle. This small body of water holds various species of catfish, and Peacock Bass. In efforts towards preserving the Reservoir, appointments must be made half a year prior to the visiting date. This ensures a controlled amount of residents that fish out of the waters, preventing overfishing. A fresh water game fishing license and an entry fishing card are required to fish there. There is a two fish per license limit, and any catfish that is 16 inches or larger must be kept.</p>
<h2 id="nuuanu-trail">Nuuanu Trail</h2>

<p>The trail to Nuuuanu began at Kalanikahua and led north of Kaumakapili Church to below the stream stream which flowed out of Kamanuwai pond. There the trail turned slightly to the right, went along the edge of the pond, and down into the water. Then, coming up on the bank onto Waiakemi, it led on to Waakekupua, along the bank of the taro patches, to the Pauoa stream, up to Pualoalo, and on to the gap at Nuuanu Pali.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="superstition">Superstition</h2>

<p> Two large stones near the back of Nuuanu Valley, Hapuu and Ka-lae-hau-ola, were said to represent a pair of goddesses who were guardians of the passage down the pali. Travellers would leave offerings of flowers or <em><a class="uri" href="kapa" title="wikilink">kapa</a></em> (bark cloth) to ensure a safe trip, and parents buried the umbilical cords of newborns under the stones as a protection against evil.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>It is said there is a moo wahine (lizard woman) who lingers around the pass. A moo wahine is <a href="mythical_creature" title="wikilink">mythical creature</a> who takes the form of a beautiful woman and leads male travelers to their deaths off the cliff. She is similar to a western <a class="uri" href="poltergeist" title="wikilink">poltergeist</a> or <a class="uri" href="mermaid" title="wikilink">mermaid</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Folklore_in_Hawaii" title="wikilink">Hawaiian folklore</a> holds that people should never carry <a class="uri" href="pork" title="wikilink">pork</a> over Nuuanu Pali, especially at night. <a href="Pele_(deity)" title="wikilink">Pele</a> (a more powerful and influential goddess than the moo wahine) was said to be responsible for this to prevent the passage of pork over the Pali. It was said Pele, the volcano goddess, was responsible for preventing passage due to her contest with <a class="uri" href="Kamapua'a" title="wikilink">Kamapua'a</a>, a half human, half hog god, and would not allow him (in the form of pork) to <a class="uri" href="trespass" title="wikilink">trespass</a> on her side of the island.</p>
