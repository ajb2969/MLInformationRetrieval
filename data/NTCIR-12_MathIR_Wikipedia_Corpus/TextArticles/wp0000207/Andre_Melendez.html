<p> <strong>Andre Melendez</strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (c. May 1, 1971 – March 17, 1996), better known as <strong>Angel Melendez</strong>, was a member of the <a href="Club_Kids" title="wikilink">Club Kids</a> and drug dealer who lived and worked in New York City. Melendez and his family arrived in New York from Colombia when Melendez was eight years old. Melendez became a drug dealer during the early 1990s after he met <a href="Peter_Gatien" title="wikilink">Peter Gatien</a>, owner of the <a href="The_Limelight" title="wikilink">Limelight Club</a> in New York, and became a regular dealer in Gatien's clubs. He was frequently seen at Manhattan clubs wearing his signature feathered wings.</p>

<p>Melendez met <a href="Michael_Alig" title="wikilink">Michael Alig</a>, a socialite and drug customer. Alig became an important customer, leading Melendez to the world of the Club Kids, including <a href="James_St._James" title="wikilink">James St. James</a> and <a href="DJ_Keoki" title="wikilink">DJ Keoki</a>. Melendez was murdered by Alig and Robert "Freez" Riggs after going to Alig's apartment to collect on a delinquent drug debt. He was hit on the head with a hammer, restrained with duct tape and either injected with or forced to drink <a class="uri" href="Drano" title="wikilink">Drano</a>. Later his body was dismembered and dumped in the <a href="Hudson_River" title="wikilink">Hudson River</a>. At first, Alig claimed it was self-defense, but later admitted to the murder.</p>

<p>On October 1, 1997 Michael Alig and Robert Riggs were sentenced to ten to twenty years in prison for Melendez's murder after each pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter.</p>

<p>Alig's murder of Angel Melendez is documented in the memoir <em><a href="Disco_Bloodbath" title="wikilink">Disco Bloodbath</a></em>, written by James St. James. The book chronicled the life of Michael Alig and the Club Kids. A 1998 documentary film titled <em><a href="Party_Monster:_The_Shockumentary" title="wikilink">Party Monster: The Shockumentary</a></em> was based on the events leading up to and surrounding the murder. A feature film titled <em><a href="Party_Monster_(2003_film)" title="wikilink">Party Monster</a></em> was later released, starring <a href="Wilson_Cruz" title="wikilink">Wilson Cruz</a> in the role of Melendez. His murder was also covered in an episode of Investigation Discovery's <a href="Deadly_Devotion" title="wikilink">Deadly Devotion</a>.</p>

<p>Robert Riggs was released from prison in 2010. Michael Alig was released from prison on May 5, 2014.</p>
