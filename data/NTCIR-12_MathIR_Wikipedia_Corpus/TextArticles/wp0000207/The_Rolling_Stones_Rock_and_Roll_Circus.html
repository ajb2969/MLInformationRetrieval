<h1>The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</em></strong> is a film released in 1996 of an 11 December 1968 event organized by <a href="the_Rolling_Stones" title="wikilink">the Rolling Stones</a>. The event comprised two concerts on a circus stage and included such acts as <a href="the_Who" title="wikilink">the Who</a>, <a href="Taj_Mahal_(musician)" title="wikilink">Taj Mahal</a>, <a href="Marianne_Faithfull" title="wikilink">Marianne Faithfull</a>, and <a href="Jethro_Tull_(band)" title="wikilink">Jethro Tull</a>. <a href="John_Lennon" title="wikilink">John Lennon</a> and his <a class="uri" href="fiancee" title="wikilink">fiancee</a> <a href="Yoko_Ono" title="wikilink">Yoko Ono</a> performed as part of a <a href="Supergroup_(music)" title="wikilink">supergroup</a> called <a href="the_Dirty_Mac" title="wikilink">the Dirty Mac</a>, along with <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Mitch_Mitchell" title="wikilink">Mitch Mitchell</a>, and <a href="Keith_Richards" title="wikilink">Keith Richards</a>. The original line up was going to be the Faces, the Rolling Stones and the Who and the concept of a circus was first thought up between Mick Jagger, Pete Townshend and Ronnie Lane and was originally meant to be aired on the <a class="uri" href="BBC" title="wikilink">BBC</a>, but the Rolling Stones withheld it. The Stones contended they did so due to their substandard performance, because they had taken the stage early in the morning and were clearly exhausted. Many others believe that the true reason for not releasing the video was that the Who, who were fresh off a concert tour, upstaged the Stones on their own production. Led Zeppelin were also originally considered but the idea was also dropped <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="concept-and-performance">Concept and performance</h2>

<p>The project was originally conceived by <a href="Mick_Jagger" title="wikilink">Mick Jagger</a> as a way of branching out from conventional records and concert performances. Jagger approached <a href="Michael_Lindsay-Hogg" title="wikilink">Michael Lindsay-Hogg</a>, who had directed two promos for Stones songs, to make a full-length TV show for them. According to Lindsay-Hogg, the idea of combining rock music and a <a href="Circus_(performing_art)" title="wikilink">circus</a> setting came to him when he was trying to come up with ideas; he drew a circle on a piece of paper and <a href="Free_association_(psychology)" title="wikilink">free-associated</a>.</p>

<p>The Stones and their guests performed in a replica of a seedy <a href="big_top_(circus)" title="wikilink">big top</a> on a British <a href="sound_stage" title="wikilink">sound stage</a> - the Intertel (V.T.R. Services) Studio, Wycombe Road, Wembley <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> - in front of an invited audience. The performances began at around 2 pm on 11 December 1968, but setting up between acts took longer than planned and the cameras kept breaking down, which meant that the final performances took place at almost 5 o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>By that time the audience and most of the Stones were exhausted; Jagger's sheer stamina managed to keep them going until the end. Jagger was reportedly so disappointed with his and the band's performance that he cancelled the airing of the film, and kept it from public view. This was the last public performance of <a href="Brian_Jones" title="wikilink">Brian Jones</a> with the Rolling Stones, and for much of the Stones performance he is inaudible, although his slide guitar on "<a href="No_Expectations" title="wikilink">No Expectations</a>", maracas on "Sympathy for the Devil", and rhythm guitar on "Jumpin' Jack Flash" and "Parachute Woman" remain clear. The last song, "<a href="Salt_of_the_Earth_(song)" title="wikilink">Salt of the Earth</a>", was sung live by Keith Richards and Mick Jagger to the pre-recorded tape from the <em><a href="Beggars_Banquet" title="wikilink">Beggars Banquet</a></em> studio album where the song had been released.</p>

<p>According to <a href="Bill_Wyman" title="wikilink">Bill Wyman</a>'s book, <em>Rolling with the Stones</em>, the Stones also performed "Confessing the Blues", "<a href="Route_66_(song)" title="wikilink">Route 66</a>" and an alternative take of "Sympathy for the Devil" with <a href="Brian_Jones" title="wikilink">Brian Jones</a> on guitar.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="footage">Footage</h2>

<p>Some of the footage of the concert was thought to be lost until 1989, when it was found in a bin in the Who's private film vault. A significant segment of footage of The Who from the production was actually shown theatrically in the documentary <em><a href="The_Kids_Are_Alright_(film)" title="wikilink">The Kids Are Alright</a></em> (1979), the only public viewing of the film until its eventual release. The Stones' film was restored and finally released on <a class="uri" href="CD" title="wikilink">CD</a> and <a href="VHS" title="wikilink">video</a> in 1996. Included on the recordings are the introductions for each act, including some entertaining banter between Jagger and Lennon.</p>

<p>This concert is the only footage of <a href="Black_Sabbath" title="wikilink">Black Sabbath</a> guitarist <a href="Tony_Iommi" title="wikilink">Tony Iommi</a> performing as a member of <a href="Jethro_Tull_(band)" title="wikilink">Jethro Tull</a>; he was a member for this show only as a favour to <a href="Ian_Anderson" title="wikilink">Ian Anderson</a> while they looked for a replacement for <a href="Mick_Abrahams" title="wikilink">Mick Abrahams</a>. The band <a href="Lip_sync#Lip-synching_in_music" title="wikilink">mimed</a> to the album version of "A Song for Jeffrey" and "Fat Man" as the Stones told them to cut their time down and it would save time on rehearsing, "Fat Man" never made the final release. This footage also included some of Ian Anderson's first attempts of his now famous flute-playing position, with one leg in the air.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p>In a 1996 review, <a href="Janet_Maslin" title="wikilink">Janet Maslin</a> called the film an "uneven but ripely nostalgic show"; although "rumor had it that the Stones... thought they looked tired and felt upstaged by the high-energy Who", "it hardly looks that way as Mick Jagger's fabulous performance nearly turns this into a <a href="one-man_show" title="wikilink">one-man show</a>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> She called Jethro Tull's performance a "shaky start" by "arguably the most unbearable band of their day", said The Who "turn up early and stop traffic, delivering a fiery [performance]", and notes Yoko Ono's "glass-shattering shrieks" are "dutifully" backed by <a href="the_Dirty_Mac" title="wikilink">the Dirty Mac</a>. She calls the concert-ending <a class="uri" href="sing-along" title="wikilink">sing-along</a> of "<a href="Salt_of_the_Earth_(song)" title="wikilink">Salt of the Earth</a>" smug and condescending, a "song about little people living in the real world".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="home-videodvd">Home video/DVD</h2>

<p>In October 1996, following two days of screenings at the <a href="Walter_Reade_Theater" title="wikilink">Walter Reade Theater</a> as part of the <a href="New_York_Film_Festival" title="wikilink">New York Film Festival</a>, <em>The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</em> was released on <a class="uri" href="VHS" title="wikilink">VHS</a> and <a class="uri" href="laserdisc" title="wikilink">laserdisc</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a class="uri" href="DVD" title="wikilink">DVD</a> version was released in October 2004,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> with audio remixed into <a href="Dolby_Surround" title="wikilink">Dolby Surround</a>. The DVD includes footage of the show, along with extra features which include previously "lost" performances, an <a class="uri" href="interview" title="wikilink">interview</a> with <a href="Pete_Townshend" title="wikilink">Pete Townshend</a>, and three <a href="Audio_commentary" title="wikilink">audio commentaries</a>. Of particular interest in the Townshend interview is his description of the genesis of the Circus project, which he claims was initially meant to involve the performers travelling across the United States via train (a concept used for a short concert series in Canada that was later documented in the feature film <em><a href="Festival_Express" title="wikilink">Festival Express</a></em>). The remastered DVD also includes a special four-camera view of The Dirty Mac's performance of <a href="the_Beatles" title="wikilink">the Beatles</a>' "Yer Blues" (showing Yoko Ono kneeling on the floor in front of the musicians, completely covered in a black sheet).</p>
