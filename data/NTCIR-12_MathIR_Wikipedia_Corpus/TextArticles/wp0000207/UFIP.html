<p><strong>UFIP</strong>, <a class="uri" href="acronym" title="wikilink">acronym</a> for "<strong>U</strong>nione <strong>F</strong>abbricanti <strong>I</strong>taliani <strong>P</strong>iatti" (translation: <em>Italian Cymbal Manufacturers Union</em>), is an Italian <a class="uri" href="cymbal" title="wikilink">cymbal</a> manufacturer, based in <a class="uri" href="Pistoia" title="wikilink">Pistoia</a>, <a class="uri" href="Tuscany" title="wikilink">Tuscany</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In the early 20th century the "Agati-Tronci" company, a known <a href="pipe_organ" title="wikilink">pipe organ</a> manufacturer, began the production of cymbals, as they were difficult to import from <a class="uri" href="Turkey" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. In 1926 a worker for the Tronci family, Fiorello Zanchi, left the company to start a new cymbal manufacturer with Manlio Biasei, the "Zanchi &amp; Biasei" company. A number of cymbals manufacturers were founded in Pistoia after the <a href="World_War_I" title="wikilink">First World War</a>, starting a competition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On January 6, 1931 four companies (Marradi-Benti, Zanchi &amp; Biasei, Rosati Leopoldo and A. &amp; B. Fratelli Tronci) founded a <a href="cooperative_society" title="wikilink">cooperative society</a> called UFIP to stop the competition between cymbals manufacturers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1947 Zanchi left UFIP to start his own company, <a href="Zanchi_(cymbals)" title="wikilink">Zanchi</a> (later spelled "Zanki").<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In 1968 UFIP changed from a cooperative society to an actual production company.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The grandson of Rosati, Buiani, co-founded with Giovanni Spadacini the Tosco company in 1974. In 1979, <a href="Robert_Zildjian" title="wikilink">Robert Zildjian</a> took over Tosco and transformed it in a <a class="uri" href="Sabian" title="wikilink">Sabian</a> subsidiary. One of the main innovation designed by Tosco is the Octagonal cymbal. This particular design inspired the Sabian <a href="China_cymbal#Rocktagon" title="wikilink">Rocktagon</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>At the beginning UFIP sold his cymbals under commission of various drums companies, initially with Turkish sounding names such as "Zinjian" (commissioned by <a href="Pearl_Drums" title="wikilink">Pearl</a>, <a href="Ludwig-Musser" title="wikilink">Ludwig</a> and <a href="Premier_Percussion" title="wikilink">Premier</a>), "Kashian" (commissioned by <a href="Slingerland_Drum_Company" title="wikilink">Slingerland</a>), "Pasha" (commissioned by <a href="Rogers_Drums" title="wikilink">Rogers</a>), "Ajaha" (commissioned by <a href="Gretsch_Drums" title="wikilink">Gretsch</a>) and "Super Constantinoples" (commissioned by Dolnet).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In the United States UFIP cymbals were sold as "Atlas" and "Abraxis" until, in the early nineties, the company began to use the "UFIP" name internationally.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h2>

<p>UFIP is known for using the "<a href="Centrifugal_casting_(industrial)" title="wikilink">Rotocasting</a>" technique. This technique was patented by the Zanchi brothers in the seventies. Rotocasting consists in casting molten <a class="uri" href="bronze" title="wikilink">bronze</a> in a cymbal mold mounted on a centrifuge that spins approximately a thousand revolutions per minute.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This particular technique reduces air pockets in the alloy and ensures a thicker bell-to-bow ratio.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Most of the UFIP top level cymbal series are manufactured using the Rotocasting technique.</p>
