<h1>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</h1>
<hr/>

<p>is a video game that was released in Japan on September 12, 2003 for the <a class="uri" href="GameCube" title="wikilink">GameCube</a>, and on November 11, 2004 for the <a href="PlayStation_2" title="wikilink">PlayStation 2</a>. It was developed by <a href="Marvelous_Interactive_Inc." title="wikilink">Marvelous Interactive Inc.</a> and released by <a href="Natsume_Co.,_Ltd" title="wikilink">Natsume</a>, and is part of the long-running <a href="Story_of_Seasons_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Story of Seasons</em></a> series of video games. The GameCube version offers connectivity with the <a href="Game_Boy_Advance" title="wikilink">Game Boy Advance</a> game <em><a href="Harvest_Moon:_Friends_of_Mineral_Town" title="wikilink">Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p>The player starts the game with one cow, and can later acquire additional, higher-quality cattle as well as male sheep, male and female chickens, and a male horse. The cow will stop producing milk after 40 days, and will have to be impregnated for her to continue making milk. In addition to these traditional <em>Harvest Moon</em> animals, this is also the first game in the series to feature ducks and a goat. The ducks appear not to incubate eggs of their own, but after acquiring ducks, some of the eggs the player harvests from chickens will hatch as ducklings. It is notable that no fertile eggs are produced in the absence of a male chicken, despite the presence of female ducks. The goat produces milk for one year then stops, and may be sold in <em>A Wonderful Life Special Edition</em> for 1000G.</p>

<p>The player also starts the game with a dog, and has the choice of floppy or pointed ears. Later in the game, the player may receive a cat from Romana. Also seen in the wilderness are a tanuki, a lizard, and a turtle, as well as a <a href="Chihuahua_(dog)" title="wikilink">chihuahua</a> that appears to be a pet at the dig site.</p>

<p>Also notable is the Mukumuku, who resembles an <a href="abominable_snowman" title="wikilink">abominable snowman</a>. The Mukumuku can only be seen during Winter near the tree in which the Harvest Sprites live, and the surrounding area commonly referred to as "the forest."</p>

<p>The player's farm has three fields, with varying levels of fertility. Plants must be watered more than once per day and nourished with fertilizer to obtain high-quality fruits and vegetables. Each crop has its ideal growing season, and will do poorly if planted at the wrong time of year. To obtain the highest quality crops and seeds, the player must water and fertilize the crops every day.</p>

<p>The game offers a variety of crops and trees, and also offers the ability to create <a href="Hybrid_(biology)" title="wikilink">hybrid</a> crops. The player can do this by feeding any two different seeds or crops to a talking plant, Tartan, who appears after befriending Takakura and visiting him in the morning, from Chapter 2 onwards.</p>

<p>This is the first <em>Harvest Moon</em> game in which the player not only has a child after marriage, but the child ages to adulthood as well. The player's son will look similar to their wife, and have a unique set of interests and talents. The child's developing personality may be influenced by taking him places, introducing him to people, and giving him gifts related to various fields. At the end of the game, the (now adult) son will choose one of seven possible careers: farmer, <a href="ranching" title="wikilink">rancher</a>, musician, artist, scholar, athlete, or scientist. If he becomes a farmer or a rancher, he will take over the family farm, although he can not marry.</p>
<h3 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h3>

<p>If the player connects a Game Boy Advance with <em>Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town</em> or <em>Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town</em> to the GameCube while playing <em>A Wonderful Life</em>, the two games can exchange information. Initiating the connection requires going to the mountain path next to the vegetable farm where Celia lives in <em>A Wonderful Life</em>, and throwing an offering into the Harvest <a class="uri" href="Goddess" title="wikilink">Goddess</a>' pond in <em>Friends of Mineral Town</em>. <a href="Non-player_character" title="wikilink">NPCs</a> in Forget-Me-Not Valley will begin to make comments about events in Mineral Town, and vice versa. In addition, some NPCs will make periodic trips to Mineral Town, returning with new items to sell or hints for the player.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>

<p>When the player begins the game, they see a coastline in Forget-Me-Not valley. Takakura, an old man who used to be the player's father's best friend, is speaking (or thinking) to their father, stating: "He wasn't unhappy. But he didn't seem to have a direction in life. One day, I went to see him. I told him about the farm you left to him. Your son didn't seem to know much about farming, but he was willing to give it a try. So I brought him to Forget-Me-Not-Valley.". The player is then seen walking down the village with Takakura, and he explains how he and the player's father owned the farm. Soon, two dogs will appear the player chooses one to keep. Takakura agrees to show the player around the valley and introduce them to the villagers, including the eligible bachelorettes: Celia, Nami, and Muffy.</p>

<p>An updated version called <em>Oh! A Wonderful Life</em> was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 in November 2004. The English language version was called <em>A Wonderful Life Special Edition</em> and was released in late 2005. While very similar to the original version of <em>A Wonderful Life</em>, some extra items and events were added in addition to an updated soundtrack. The most notable changes were the ability to have a daughter, the ability to marry Lumina, and the ability to continue playing after death.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The girl version of <em>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</em>, <strong><em>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life</em></strong>, was released for the GameCube in the English-speaking world in July 2005. In this game, the player goes through the storyline of <em>A Wonderful Life</em> as a female character, and can court and marry one of three male NPCs, Marlin, Rock, and Gustafa. The game offers connectivity with the Game Boy Advance game <em><a href="Harvest_Moon:_More_Friends_of_Mineral_Town" title="wikilink">Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town</a></em>.</p>

<p><em><a href="Harvest_Moon_DS" title="wikilink">Harvest Moon DS</a></em>, the first game in the <a href="Story_of_Seasons_(series)" title="wikilink"><em>Story of Seasons</em> series</a> to be released on the <a href="Nintendo_DS" title="wikilink">Nintendo DS</a>, has the same setting and features most of the characters from <em>A Wonderful Life</em>.</p>
<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>

<p><em>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</em> received largely positive reviews upon its initial GameCube release. <a class="uri" href="IGN" title="wikilink">IGN</a> gave the title an "Impressive" 8 out of 10 rating, praising gameplay and lasting appeal while also noting its "monotonous" audio and upsetting lack of festivals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <em>A Wonderful Life</em> garnered an 8.7 rating from Ryan Davis of GameSpot.com. Echoing other reviews, Davis considered it "a fun and potentially addictive game that, if you let it, will gladly consume any free time you choose to give it."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>Special Edition</em> released for PlayStation 2 did not receive such strong praise. IGN's Juan Castro gave it a score of 6/10 and remarked "The differences, including an increase in brides, choosing the gender of your child and the ability to play forever, make little difference. What does make a difference, though, is the drastic drop in framerate, increase in load times and muddy graphics."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The <em>Official Playstation 2 Magazine</em> of the UK gave it a 7/10 rating.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
