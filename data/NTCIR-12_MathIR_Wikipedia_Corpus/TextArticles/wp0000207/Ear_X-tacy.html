<h1>Ear X-tacy</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>ear X-tacy</strong> was a <a href="Louisville,_Kentucky" title="wikilink">Louisville, Kentucky</a> "alternative record store," owned and operated by John Timmons. The store announced its closing on October 31, 2011, after 26 years in business.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>  ear X-tacy first opened in 1985 in a 500 ft² (46 m²) building stocked with John Timmons' personal records "and a cash advance on his mastercard".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The store name came from the band <a class="uri" href="XTC" title="wikilink">XTC</a>, of which owner John Timmons is a fan. As the store grew, it changed location three times over a period of sixteen years; it then remained in the same location, on <a href="Bardstown_Road" title="wikilink">Bardstown Road</a> just south of <a href="Eastern_Parkway_(Louisville,_Kentucky)" title="wikilink">Eastern Parkway</a> in <a href="The_Highlands,_Louisville" title="wikilink">The Highlands</a>, until late July 2010. It then moved to the <a href="Belknap,_Louisville" title="wikilink">Douglass Loop</a>, a former streetcar turnaround point on Bardstown Road about  southeast of its previous location but still in The Highlands.</p>

<p>ear X-tacy carried almost every music <a class="uri" href="genre" title="wikilink">genre</a> imaginable in <a class="uri" href="CD" title="wikilink">CD</a>, <a href="compact_audio_cassette" title="wikilink">cassette</a>, and <a href="Vinyl_record" title="wikilink">vinyl</a> formats and also carried a large stock of <a href="DVD" title="wikilink">DVDs</a>, including many hard-to-find items. In 1995, the ear X-tacy <a href="record_label" title="wikilink">label</a> was formed.</p>

<p>The building that the store occupied before its final move had two stories and 10,000 ft² (930 m²) of floor space. The first floor was dedicated to CDs, DVDs, T-shirts, toys, etc. It also included a stage for live performances and a large selection of small and large stickers mocking current U.S. events or promoting Louisville. The second floor was dedicated to new &amp; used vinyl records. The final store was on one floor, with comparable floor space. Like the previous location, it included a stage.</p>

<p>The store's signature logo stickers spawned a local fad wherein people cut up and reassemble the distinctive letters to form other words or phrases, such as "racy aXe" or "area X".</p>

<p>The insert of the <a href="Gin_Blossoms" title="wikilink">Gin Blossoms</a>' <em>New Miserable Experience</em> album features a photo of one of the band members with an ear X-tacy sticker in his mouth.</p>

<p>ear X-tacy often had bands, many local, come and play during the day. One of the most memorable performances was on July 4, 2000, when the <a href="Foo_Fighters" title="wikilink">Foo Fighters</a> played. The store was packed with 700 people inside and 200 people outside. They have had other performances by national acts such as <a href="Queens_of_the_Stone_Age" title="wikilink">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href="John_Mayer" title="wikilink">John Mayer</a>, <a href="Sam_Bush" title="wikilink">Sam Bush</a>, <a href="Shooter_Jennings" title="wikilink">Shooter Jennings</a>, <a href="The_Black_Keys" title="wikilink">The Black Keys</a>, <a href="Drive-By_Truckers" title="wikilink">Drive-By Truckers</a>, <a href="Cage_the_Elephant" title="wikilink">Cage the Elephant</a>, <a href="Tenacious_D" title="wikilink">Tenacious D</a>, and notable local acts like Skyscraper Stereo and <a href="The_Villebillies" title="wikilink">The Villebillies</a> to name a few. Louisville natives <a href="My_Morning_Jacket" title="wikilink">My Morning Jacket</a> performed to a sold-out crowd of 500 on June 10, 2008, the same day that the band's album <a href="Evil_Urges" title="wikilink">Evil Urges</a> was released. Local goth metal band The Revenants were the final band to ever perform at Ear X-Tacy.</p>
