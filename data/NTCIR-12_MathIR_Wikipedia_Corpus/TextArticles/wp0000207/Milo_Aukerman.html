The first full length Descendents album (released in 1982) was titled <em><a href="Milo_Goes_to_College" title="wikilink">Milo Goes to College</a></em>, as he had gone to school at UC San Diego. The initial single had caricatures of the three original members, and the drawing used to symbolize Milo, invented by a high school classmate, was used on many of their albums. Aukerman has also provided backing vocals for other musicians, and, while attending college (between stints with the Descendents), briefly fronted the San Diego band "Milestone" who released one independently produced album.</p>
