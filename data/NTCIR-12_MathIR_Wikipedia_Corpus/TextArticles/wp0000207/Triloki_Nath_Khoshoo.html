<p>The world of the <a class="uri" href="Cannaceae" title="wikilink">Cannaceae</a> family and the <a href="Canna_(plant)" title="wikilink">Canna</a> genus has much to thank Dr Triloki Nath Khoshoo, one of the great botanists of the last century who admired Canna very much, for it is from his work that we have gathered much of our knowledge of the Canna genus. In all, Dr Khoshoo authored and co-authored over 10 separate papers on the subject of Canna, many of which were bought together in a single document called <em>Origin and Evolution of Cultivated Cannas</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
