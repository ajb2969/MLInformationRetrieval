<h2 id="early-life-and-education">Early life and education</h2>
<p>Born in New York City, Price was the son of Samuel and Bella Price, <a href="Russian_Jews" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> immigrants to the United States from Minsk (Belarus), in the early years of the 20th century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The name Price, which later became so apt, was assigned at <a href="Ellis_Island" title="wikilink">Ellis Island</a>; the original name may have been <a href="Press_(surname)" title="wikilink">Press</a> or Preuss.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The family relocated to San Diego in the early 1920s.</p>
<p>Price graduated from <a href="San_Diego_High_School" title="wikilink">San Diego High School</a> in 1931, attended <a href="San_Diego_State_University" title="wikilink">San Diego State University</a> in 1932, and earned his undergraduate degree (in philosophy) and a law degree from the <a href="University_of_Southern_California" title="wikilink">University of Southern California</a> in 1936 and 1938, respectively. By 1938, he had married his girlfriend Helen Moskowitz; they eloped to <a href="Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Las Vegas</a>.

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>Price launched the first <a class="uri" href="FedMart" title="wikilink">FedMart</a> in 1954 and founded, <a href="Price_Club" title="wikilink">Price Club</a> together with his son, Robert, Giles Bateman, a nephew, Rick Libenson and others in 1976. The company went public in 1980.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1993 <a class="uri" href="Costco" title="wikilink">Costco</a> merged with Price Club to form PriceCostco.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Leadership in the new organization was shared between Sol Price's son, Robert, and <a href="James_Sinegal" title="wikilink">James Sinegal</a>. After eight months, PriceCostco spun a separate company called <a href="PriceSmart" title="wikilink">Price Enterprises</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> led by the younger Price. PriceSmart continues to operate warehouse clubs in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the domestic operations became Costco.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Sam_Walton" title="wikilink">Sam Walton</a> of <a class="uri" href="Wal-Mart" title="wikilink">Wal-Mart</a> wrote in his book <em>Made in America</em> that he "borrowed" "as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> He added that he especially liked the idea of calling his discount chain "Wal-Mart" because he "really liked Sol's FedMart name". In 1983, Walton dined with Price and later that year the first <a href="Sam's_Club" title="wikilink">Sam's Club</a> was opened in <a href="Oklahoma_City,_Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Oklahoma City</a>, <a class="uri" href="Oklahoma" title="wikilink">Oklahoma</a>. Later when asked how it felt to be the father of an industry (the warehouse retail industry—Costco, Sam's Club, etc.) Sol replied, "I wish I'd worn a condom." Costco's longest-serving CEO, <a href="James_Sinegal" title="wikilink">James Sinegal</a>, learned the retail business largely through working his way up FedMart's corporate ladder. In <a class="uri" href="CNBC" title="wikilink">CNBC</a>'s 2012 documentary on Costco, Sinegal indicated that Price had been his mentor, as well as the person who taught him to be "tough" in business, and to display a sense of "social responsibility" toward employees.</p>
<h2 id="philanthropy">Philanthropy</h2>
<p>In the late 1980s, Price donated $2 million to the construction of a new student center on the campus of <a href="UCSD" title="wikilink">University of California, San Diego</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Named for Price, the Price Center, which houses the main student bookstore, food court, movie theater, ballrooms, and meeting rooms, opened on April 21, 1989.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Price Family Charitable Fund donated $50 million to the University of Southern California's <a href="School_of_Policy,_Planning,_and_Development" title="wikilink">School of Policy, Planning, and Development</a>. The school was renamed the Sol Price School of Public Policy as a result of the donation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Price is responsible for injecting money and aiding the renaissance of the <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> mid-city neighborhood of <a href="City_Heights,_San_Diego" title="wikilink">City Heights</a>, near his childhood home in the neighborhood of Burlingame.
