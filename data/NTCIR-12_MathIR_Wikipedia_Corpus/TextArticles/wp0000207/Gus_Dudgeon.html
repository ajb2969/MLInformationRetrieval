<p>Dudgeon left Decca and founded his own company. In 1970, Dudgeon began working with Elton John. The first song which they worked together on was "<a href="Your_Song" title="wikilink">Your Song</a>", on which Dudgeon elaborated on the simple piano tune and added an orchestral arrangement by Paul Buckmaster. The song reached the <a href="Billboard_chart" title="wikilink">U.S. Top 10</a>, becoming John's first substantial hit. Dudgeon continued to work with John on his next few albums. Dudgeon was sometimes critical of John's work; for instance, in Elizabeth Rosenthal's book <em>His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John</em>, Dudgeon called the 1974 <em><a href="Caribou_(album)" title="wikilink">Caribou</a></em> album "a piece of crap ... the sound is the worst, the songs are nowhere, the sleeve came out wrong, the lyrics weren't that good, the singing wasn't all there, the playing wasn't great and the production is just plain lousy".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Dudgeon and John, along with <a href="Bernie_Taupin" title="wikilink">Bernie Taupin</a> and Steve Brown, founded <a href="The_Rocket_Record_Company" title="wikilink">The Rocket Record Company</a> in 1973.

Gus was also responsible for the mixing of the 80-plus member <a href="Melbourne_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Melbourne Symphony Orchestra</a> which toured Australia with Elton John in late 1986. A recording of the final show of the tour was released as the album <em><a href="Live_in_Australia_with_the_Melbourne_Symphony_Orchestra" title="wikilink">Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra</a></em>.</p>
