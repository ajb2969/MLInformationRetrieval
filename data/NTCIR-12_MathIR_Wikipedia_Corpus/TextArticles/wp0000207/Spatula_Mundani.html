<h1>Spatula Mundani</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Spatula Mundani</strong> was a <a class="uri" href="surgical" title="wikilink">surgical</a> device invented in the 17th century by the <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a> surgeon <a href="James_Woodall" title="wikilink">James Woodall</a> to treat extreme cases of severe <a class="uri" href="constipation" title="wikilink">constipation</a> where <a href="purgative" title="wikilink">purgatives</a> had failed. Woodall believed that the cause of this malady was from <a class="uri" href="scurvy" title="wikilink">scurvy</a>, but speculation is that many of the cases were from the abuse of <a class="uri" href="laudanum" title="wikilink">laudanum</a>, a popular <a class="uri" href="painkiller" title="wikilink">painkiller</a> of the time. A drawing of the device is found in his 1617 book "The Surgeons Mate".</p>

<p>The device was an <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a> tool slightly longer than 12Â inches and consisted of a paddle at one end. The other end was spoon-shaped, with the center removed and a knob at the end. The spoon end was used to extract the "hard excrements" while the other was used for applying ointments, no doubt necessary after undergoing a procedure with this instrument.</p>

<p>The term <em>mundani</em> is apparently derived from the archaic term <em>mundify</em> which appeared in a dictionary from 1604 with the definition "to make clean".</p>

<p>On an <a class="uri" href="archaeological" title="wikilink">archaeological</a> dig at the <a href="Jamestown,_Virginia" title="wikilink">Jamestown, Virginia</a> colonies a spatula mundani was found, and documents from 1608 report that it was part of a chest of surgeons tools sent by Woodall to the colonies.</p>
