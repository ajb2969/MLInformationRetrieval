<hr/>

<p><strong>Mark Jeffery Hudson</strong> (born August 23, 1951 in <a href="Portland,_Oregon" title="wikilink">Portland, Oregon</a>)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is a record producer, musician and songwriter based in both Los Angeles and New York City. After first rising to prominence as a performer, songwriter and TV personality in the 1970s as a member of the <a href="Hudson_Brothers" title="wikilink">Hudson Brothers</a> trio, Hudson achieved independent success as record producer and songwriter – working with a broad variety of artists including <a class="uri" href="Cher" title="wikilink">Cher</a>, <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a>, <a class="uri" href="Aerosmith" title="wikilink">Aerosmith</a>, <a href="Scorpions_(band)" title="wikilink">Scorpions</a>, <a href="Ozzy_Osbourne" title="wikilink">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, <a href="Hanson_(band)" title="wikilink">Hanson</a>, <a href="Harry_Nilsson" title="wikilink">Harry Nilsson</a>, and the <a href="Baha_Men" title="wikilink">Baha Men</a>.</p>

<h3 id="with-aerosmith">With Aerosmith</h3>

<p>Hudson co-wrote the <a class="uri" href="Grammy" title="wikilink">Grammy</a> award-winning <a class="uri" href="Aerosmith" title="wikilink">Aerosmith</a> hit "<a href="Livin'_on_the_Edge" title="wikilink">Livin' on the Edge</a>" in 1993, and has since co-written a total of 12 Aerosmith songs. He co-produced their 2001 album <em><a href="Just_Push_Play" title="wikilink">Just Push Play</a></em>, co-writing six of the album's twelve songs. Hudson, along with <a href="Steven_Tyler" title="wikilink">Steven Tyler</a>, <a href="Joe_Perry_(musician)" title="wikilink">Joe Perry</a> and <a href="Marti_Frederiksen" title="wikilink">Marti Frederiksen</a>, make up what has become known as the "Boneyard Boys", the informal collective of songwriters, musicians and producers responsible for Aerosmith's creative process.</p>
<h3 id="with-ringo-starr">With Ringo Starr</h3>

<p>For ten years starting in 1998, Hudson was the primary driving force as producer and composer behind Ringo Starr's continued career as a recording artist.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In that endeavor, Hudson produced or co-produced nine albums for Starr. There were five critically acclaimed studio albums: <em><a href="Vertical_Man" title="wikilink">Vertical Man</a></em> (1998), <em><a href="I_Wanna_Be_Santa_Claus" title="wikilink">I Wanna Be Santa Claus</a></em> (1999), <em><a href="Ringo_Rama" title="wikilink">Ringo Rama</a></em> (2003), <em><a href="Choose_Love" title="wikilink">Choose Love</a></em> (2005) and <em><a href="Liverpool_8" title="wikilink">Liverpool 8</a></em> (2008). Three live albums were also released during this relationship: <em><a href="VH1_Storytellers_(Ringo_Starr_album)" title="wikilink">VH1 Storytellers</a></em> (1998), <em><a href="Ringo_Starr_and_Friends" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr and Friends</a></em> (2006) and <em><a href="Ringo_Starr:_Live_at_Soundstage" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr: Live at Soundstage</a></em> (2007). The ninth album – a compilation album <em><a href="Ringo_5.1:_The_Surround_Sound_Collection" title="wikilink">Ringo 5.1: The Surround Sound Collection</a></em> – included remixes of thirteen tracks originally produced by Hudson and Starr. It was nominated for <em>Best Surround Sound Album</em> in the 51st annual Grammy Awards for the year 2007–2008.</p>

<p>The nine albums co-produced by Hudson featured a total of 82 different songs. 17 of the 82 songs were cover versions of various classics and oldies. The other 65 songs were specially-composed new songs. Underscoring the primacy of his role in the creation of the albums, Hudson was credited as co-writer of 64 of the 65 new songs.</p>

<p>Hudson secured Steven Tyler as guest vocalist on a remake of <a href="Dobie_Gray" title="wikilink">Dobie Gray</a>'s song "<a href="Drift_Away" title="wikilink">Drift Away</a>" for the album <em>Vertical Man</em>. Shortly prior to release, Tyler's record label demanded that his vocal be removed, and he was replaced by <a href="Tom_Petty" title="wikilink">Tom Petty</a> on the officially-released album. However, the version of the recording featuring Tyler had been circulated on advance promotional discs and found its way on to bootlegs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2003, Starr told the professional audio industry magazine <em><a href="Mix_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Mix</a></em>: "Mark puts the fun back in recording. We always have such a great time. He lets the musician know that anything is possible... He's a great musician, has lots of energy and he's a lot of fun to work with."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In June 2007, Starr's attorney, Bruce Grakal, told <em>Beatlefan</em> magazine (issue #141) that the partnership between Hudson and Starr was over, and that they would not work together again. Grakal claimed that the split occurred because Hudson had asked to withdraw from appearing in one of Starr's concert tours – allegedly on short notice. Hudson had been offered a major role on a network TV show <em><a href="The_One:_Making_a_Music_Star" title="wikilink">The One: Making a Music Star</a></em> which conflicted with the Starr tour. Hudson said in an interview with <em>Beatlefan</em> magazine that withdrawing from the 2006 All-Starr band tour was not the primary reason for the split and cited Starr's preference for using more synthesized sounds for his next album.</p>

<p>Prior to the split with Starr, Hudson had co-written and recorded all 12 songs heard on the final version of the <em>Liverpool 8</em> album. After the split, Starr had the tracks remixed by <a href="David_A._Stewart" title="wikilink">Dave Stewart</a> who was credited as "re-producer." The album was released in January 2008 on EMI/Capitol Records as part of Starr's new recording deal, having left Koch Records in late 2006.</p>

<p>In 2003, Hudson formed a jointly-owned record company with <a href="Ringo_Starr" title="wikilink">Ringo Starr</a> called Pumkinhead Records intended to release recordings by other artists. Distribution for the label was set up via EMI.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The label released an album titled <em><a href="Fake_Songs" title="wikilink">Fake Songs</a></em> by <a href="Liam_Lynch_(musician)" title="wikilink">Liam Lynch</a>, the creator of <a class="uri" href="MTV" title="wikilink">MTV</a>'s sock-puppet show <em><a href="Sifl_and_Olly" title="wikilink">Sifl and Olly</a></em>.</p>

<p>In 2005, Hudson produced a new, multi-artist recording of <a href="Eric_Clapton" title="wikilink">Eric Clapton</a>'s 1993 song "<a href="Tears_in_Heaven" title="wikilink">Tears in Heaven</a>" as a charity single for victims of the <a href="2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami" title="wikilink">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami</a>.
