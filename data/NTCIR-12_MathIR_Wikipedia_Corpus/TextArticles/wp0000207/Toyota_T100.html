<p>The <strong>Toyota T100</strong> (not to be confused with <a href="Toyota_Stout" title="wikilink">RK100</a>) was a <a class="uri" href="full-size" title="wikilink">full-size</a> <a href="pickup_truck" title="wikilink">pickup truck</a> introduced by <a class="uri" href="Toyota" title="wikilink">Toyota</a> in late 1992 as a 1993 model year vehicle.</p>

<p>As Toyota firmly established itself in the <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North American</a> compact pickup truck market in the 1980s through 1990s, it seemed only logical that Toyota needed to capture part of the lucrative full-size pickup truck market. Rumored for many years before, the 1993 <a class="uri" href="Toyota" title="wikilink">Toyota</a> T100 boasted a full-size (8 ft) pickup bed but retained the <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">engine</a> and suspension setup of its smaller and older sibling, the compact <a href="Toyota_Hilux" title="wikilink">Toyota Pickup Truck</a>. Although the T100 was a bit larger than the competitive <a class="uri" href="mid-size" title="wikilink">mid-size</a> <a href="Dodge_Dakota" title="wikilink">Dodge Dakota</a> and <a href="Compact_car" title="wikilink">compact</a> <a href="Ford_Ranger" title="wikilink">Ford Ranger</a> pickup trucks of the time, it was still much smaller than full-size American pickup trucks of the time. This gave the T100 a unique position and opportunity within the truck ranks. Though economical, reliable and practical, in the grand scheme of things the unsuccessful T100 had not captured as much of the market as Toyota had hoped. Many critics maintained the T100 was still too small, despite being larger than both the <a href="Toyota_Hilux" title="wikilink">Toyota Pickup Truck</a> and the <a href="Toyota_Tacoma" title="wikilink">Toyota Tacoma</a> compact trucks, for the full-size segment.</p>

<p>Although sales were slow at start, the T100 sales did reach into the mid 40,000 vehicles sold range (1996) in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. Sales of the <a href="Chevrolet_C/K" title="wikilink">General Motors C/K Trucks</a> were roughly 700,000 per year, while sales of the <a href="Ford_F-Series" title="wikilink">Ford F-Series</a> surged from 550,000 to nearly 850,000 and <a class="uri" href="Dodge" title="wikilink">Dodge</a> went from 100,000 to 400,000 with the introduction of the new <a href="Dodge_Ram" title="wikilink">Dodge Ram</a> in 1994. Sales of the T100 fell approximately 30% when the new Ram went on the market half a year or so after the T100's launch.</p>
<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<p>Upon introduction, the T100 was criticized for several things. The first was being too small to appeal to buyers of full-size work trucks, the second was the lack of an xtracab version and the third and perhaps most important criticism, was the lack of a <a href="V8_engine" title="wikilink">V8 engine</a> with the only available engine being that of a small 3.0 liter <a class="uri" href="V6" title="wikilink">V6</a> powerplant which was already found in Toyota's compact trucks and in the <a href="Toyota_4Runner" title="wikilink">4Runner</a>. Although considered criticisms by many, Toyota stated these were all factors that were taken into consideration when designing and producing the T100. They claimed the smaller size was planned to offer a larger truck with a compact "feel", an Xtracab was on the horizon and the 3.0 liter V6 would provide far better fuel economy than the vehicles it aspired to rival.</p>

<p>Beyond the issues of size and horsepower the T100 did receive some praises from the media, acquiring <a href="J.D._Power_and_Associates" title="wikilink">J.D. Power and Associates</a> Initial Quality Survey "Best Full-Size Pickup" award and the "Best of What's New" award by <a href="Popular_Science" title="wikilink">Popular Science</a> magazine in its first year on the market. The T100 was the first vehicle -car or truck - ever to receive an "Initial Quality Survey Award" in its first year of production. In 1994 (the truck's second year) and 1995 (the third) the T100 was again awarded "Best Full-Size Pickup in Initial Quality" by <a href="J.D._Power_and_Associates" title="wikilink">J.D. Power and Associates</a>. In 1997 the T100 was awarded "Top Three Vehicles in Initial Quality - Full-Size Segment" once again by <a href="J.D._Power_and_Associates" title="wikilink">J.D. Power and Associates</a>.</p>

<p>When it was introduced, the T100 had one cab configuration, a regular cab, and one available engine, a 3.0 L <a class="uri" href="V6" title="wikilink">V6</a> with  and  of torque. In 1994, a 2.7 L <a href="I4_engine" title="wikilink">I4 engine</a> with  (like the 3.0 V6) and  of torque was added in the hopes new buyers would be drawn in with promises of greater fuel economy and a lower price (than previous models). Toyota ultimately realized there was no alternative but to add more power to the truck and in 1995 Toyota added the  and  of torque 3.4 L <a class="uri" href="V6" title="wikilink">V6</a>. An <strong>Xtra Cab</strong> model came along several months into the 1995 model year as well. The T100 received only minor changes throughout its run, aside from the engine changes and the Xtra Cab addition. A driver-side airbag was installed in 1994 (a passenger-side air bag never became available), and larger 16-inch rims became the norm for most of the 4X4 models starting in 1997. It was evident by late 1996/ early 1997 that Toyota was already investing in its next <a class="uri" href="truck" title="wikilink">truck</a> (what ultimately became the <a href="Toyota_Tundra" title="wikilink">Toyota Tundra</a>). At the time (late 1990s) many believed, a revamped T100 was on the way (with the promise of a V8 engine) and there were some reports that altered V8 powered T100s were used as test-mules, but ultimately it never came to pass, and <a class="uri" href="Toyota" title="wikilink">Toyota</a> went back to the drawing board and the Toyota Tundra came to be.</p>

<p><a href="Toyota_Racing_Development" title="wikilink">Toyota Racing Development</a> (TRD) introduced a supercharger for the 3.4 liter engine in 1997 and it became available for the T100, the <a href="Toyota_Tacoma" title="wikilink">Tacoma</a> and the <a href="Toyota_4Runner" title="wikilink">4Runner</a> with the 3.4 liter <a class="uri" href="V6" title="wikilink">V6</a> (and later the Tundra). Horsepower jumped to the  range (depending of the generation of the supercharger) and  to  of torque. This power add on was available for 1997–1998 T100s only. Earlier 3.4 V6 powered T100s have different computer and electrical layouts which do not support the TRD device.</p>

<p>The T100 was manufactured and partially engineered by <a class="uri" href="Toyota" title="wikilink">Toyota</a>-subsidiary <a href="Hino_Motors" title="wikilink">Hino</a>. Three trim lines were offered: the base model, the <em>DX</em>, and the top-of-the-line <em>SR5</em>. The maximum towing capacity was 5,200 lb (2,360 kg) and the truck had a payload limit of 2,450 pounds. Although most trucks fell within the 1/2 ton realm, a 1 ton model was offered (in 2 wheel drive form) for several of its earlier years until finally being dropped because of a lack of interest.</p>

<p>For the T100's first three model years, they were assembled in <a class="uri" href="Tokyo" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>, <a class="uri" href="Japan" title="wikilink">Japan</a>. The T100 was the last Japanese-built Toyota pickup made for <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a> when in 1996 Toyota moved production of the T100s to the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> with the opening of Toyota's new Tundra <a href="Gibson_County,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Gibson County, Indiana</a> plant. Some 1997 T100s were made in Japan. The US retail price of the T100 built entirely in Japan included a 25% import tariff. The T100 was discontinued in 1998 and replaced by the larger <a href="V8_engine" title="wikilink">V8</a>-powered <a href="Toyota_Tundra" title="wikilink">Tundra</a>.</p>
