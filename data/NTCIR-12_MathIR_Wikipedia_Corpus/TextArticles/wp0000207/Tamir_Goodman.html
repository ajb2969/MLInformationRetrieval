<p>Goodman grew up in <a href="Baltimore,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, in an Orthodox Jewish family with six brothers and two sisters.

<p>Goodman received a scholarship to the <a href="Maryland_Terrapins" title="wikilink">University of Maryland</a>, which had one of the top-ranked basketball teams in the country.The team's schedule included activities on Friday nights and Saturdays (against the rules of <a href="Orthodox_Judaism" title="wikilink">Orthodox Judaism</a>), so he declined Maryland's offer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Goodman then accepted a <a class="uri" href="scholarship" title="wikilink">scholarship</a> from nearby <a href="Towson_University" title="wikilink">Towson University</a>. Goodman was the first freshman to start at Towson in eleven seasons.
