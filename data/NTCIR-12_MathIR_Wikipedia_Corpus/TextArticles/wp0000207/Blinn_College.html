<h1>Blinn College</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Blinn College</strong> is a two-year academic institution based in <a href="Brenham,_Texas" title="wikilink">Brenham, Texas</a>, with <a href="campus" title="wikilink">campuses</a> in <a href="Brenham,_Texas" title="wikilink">Brenham</a>, <a href="Bryan,_Texas" title="wikilink">Bryan</a>, <a href="Schulenburg,_Texas" title="wikilink">Schulenburg</a>, and <a href="Sealy,_Texas" title="wikilink">Sealy</a>. While Brenham is Blinn's main campus, with dorms and apartments, more than 70% of students attend the Bryan campus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The school was founded as Mission Institute in 1883 by the Southern German Conference of the <a href="Methodism" title="wikilink">Methodist</a> denomination. It became <a href="coeducation" title="wikilink">coeducational</a> in 1888 when it began admitting women. In 1889, the institute's name was changed to Blinn Memorial College in honor of the Reverend Christian Blinn of <a href="New_York" title="wikilink">New York</a>, who had donated a considerable sum of money to make the school possible. In 1927, the Board of Trustees, under leadership of President Philip Deschner, organized a <a href="junior_college" title="wikilink">junior college</a>. In 1930, Blinn merged with <a href="Southwestern_University" title="wikilink">Southwestern University</a> of <a href="Georgetown,_Texas" title="wikilink">Georgetown</a>, <a class="uri" href="Texas" title="wikilink">Texas</a>. In 1934, a new charter was procured by the citizens of Brenham, and a private nonsectarian junior college was organized as Blinn College with nine regents as the board of control. In February 1937, all connections with Southwestern University and the Methodist denominations were severed.</p>

<p>An election held in <a href="Washington_County,_Texas" title="wikilink">Washington County</a> on June 8, 1937, for the purposes of creating a public junior college district and for levying a small tax, was successful. Blinn thus became the first county-owned junior college district in Texas. The college continues to operate as one of the largest of 50 public <a href="community_college" title="wikilink">community college</a> districts in the Texas.</p>

<p>The <a href="Bryan,_Texas" title="wikilink">Bryan</a> campus was established in 1970, and by the mid-1990s a third campus was in <a href="College_Station,_Texas" title="wikilink">College Station</a>. In 1997, the Villa Maria Road campus opened consolidating the programs that were located in the Townshire Shopping Center in Bryan and the Woodstone Center in College Station. The third <a href="Brazos_County,_Texas" title="wikilink">Brazos County</a> site, located in the former Bryan post office, continues to house the dental hygiene, radiologic technology, and workforce education programs. The original three buildings on the Bryan campuses were expanded to six, and in 2002, the former Schulman Theater was purchased and converted to classroom space, known as the College Park Campus (CPC). The Schulenburg campus opened in 1997 and Sealy in 2005.</p>

<p>Blinn College offers academic transfer courses and these technical programs: Associate Degree and Vocational Nursing, Surgical Technology, EMS, Physical Therapy Assisting, Dental Hygiene, Radiologic Technology, Fire Science, Criminal Justice, Early Childhood Development, Legal Assisting, Real Estate, Computer Information Technology, Information Management, and Business (General Business, Accounting, Business Administration and Management, Hospitality Management, Small Business Management). The college also offers noncredit, non-transferrable workforce education programs.</p>
<h2 id="academic-transfer">Academic transfer</h2>

<p>Blinn boasts the highest transfer rate in the State of Texas, sending students to institutions such as <a href="Texas_A&amp;M;_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M; University</a>, <a href="Sam_Houston_State_University" title="wikilink">Sam Houston State University</a>, <a href="Texas_State_University" title="wikilink">Texas State University</a>, the <a href="University_of_Texas" title="wikilink">University of Texas</a> and the <a href="University_of_Houston" title="wikilink">University of Houston</a>. Its transfer rate to four-year universities is 49% compared to the state average of 27%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Blinn transfers more students to Texas A&amp;M; University than any other two-year college. Blinn technical students score among the best in the state on board and licensure exams.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Blinn and <a href="Texas_A&amp;M;_University" title="wikilink">Texas A&amp;M; University</a> established the first co-enrollment program of its kind with the TEAM (Transfer Enrollment at Texas A&amp;M;) Program, which allows students to enroll at both schools with part-time admission to Texas A&amp;M; and is offered only to qualifying students during the Texas A&amp;M; freshman admissions process. Participating students are enrolled in one academic course at Texas A&amp;M; each semester and complete the remainder of their courses at the Blinnâ€“Bryan campus. Students who complete 45 Blinn credit hours and 15 Texas A&amp;M; credit hours within two years, with a 3.0 grade point average at each school, are automatically admitted to Texas A&amp;M.; TEAM students can apply for transfer admission sooner when they meet the eligibility requirements. Students enrolled in 15 semester credit hours in the TEAM program save as much as $1,500 compared to students enrolled in 15 credit hours at Texas A&amp;M.; In 2013, the program was awarded the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board's Recognition of Excellence,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and in 2014 it received the THECB Star Award.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
