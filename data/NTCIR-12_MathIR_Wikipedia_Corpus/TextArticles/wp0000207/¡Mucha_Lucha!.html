It was created by <a href="Eddie_Mort" title="wikilink">Eddie Mort</a> and Lili Chin and produced by <a href="Warner_Bros._Animation" title="wikilink">Warner Bros. Animation</a>. It is the first <a class="uri" href="animated" title="wikilink">animated</a> <a href="television_series" title="wikilink">television series</a> created with <a href="Adobe_Flash" title="wikilink">Adobe Flash</a>, a program often used for Internet cartoons. The show was also seen on <a href="Teletoon_(Canadian_TV_channel)" title="wikilink">Teletoon</a> in <a class="uri" href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canada</a>, <a class="uri" href="CITV" title="wikilink">CITV</a> and <a class="uri" href="Kix!" title="wikilink">Kix!</a> in the UK, and <a href="Cartoon_Network" title="wikilink">Cartoon Network</a> worldwide (including the US).</p>

<p>The show is set in a fictional <a href="Mexico" title="wikilink">Mexican</a> town centered on <em><a href="lucha_libre" title="wikilink">lucha libre</a></em> (nearly everyone in the town has a mask and costume and a <a href="signature_move" title="wikilink">signature move</a>) and is essentially about the adventures of three children, <a class="uri" href="Rikochet" title="wikilink">Rikochet</a>, <a href="The_Flea_(character)" title="wikilink">The Flea</a> and <a href="Buena_Girl" title="wikilink">Buena Girl</a>, as they struggle through the <em>Foremost World-Renowned International School of Lucha</em>, where they study.</p>

<p>In 2005 the straight-to-video movie <em><a href="¡Mucha_Lucha!:_The_Return_of_El_Maléfico" title="wikilink">¡Mucha Lucha!: The Return of El Maléfico</a></em> was spun off of the series.</p>
<h2 id="main-characters">Main characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rikochet - A young wrestler who is the main protagonist. He considers himself the bravest of the group, but sometimes leaps before he looks.</li>
<li>The Flea - A friend of Rikochet who is always dirty. As well as having a few disgusting habits, he is also the most nervous, but often proves to be a useful ally.</li>
<li>Buena Girl - A smart young female wrestler who always plays by the rules. She can also be very arrogant and obnoxious at times.</li>
<li>El Rey - An action figure which represents Rikochet's conscience. He's carried in a backpack, but can move and talk on his own, as if he were alive. It is stated that this action figure is just part of a large merchandising euphoria related to a supreme undefeated Mexican wrestler with the same name (an allusion to <a class="uri" href="Santo" title="wikilink">Santo</a>). Along in the series, several other El Rey toys appear and often causes trouble with Rikochet's.</li>
