<h1>This was their finest hour</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>This was their finest hour</em></strong> is the title commonly used for a speech delivered by <a href="Winston_Churchill" title="wikilink">Winston Churchill</a> to the <a href="British_House_of_Commons" title="wikilink">House of Commons</a> of the <a href="Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> on 18 June 1940. It was given just over a month after he took over as <a href="Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> at the head of an <a href="Churchill_war_ministry" title="wikilink">all-party coalition government</a>.</p>

<p>It was the third of three speeches which he gave during (roughly) the period of the <a href="Battle_of_France" title="wikilink">Battle of France</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The "<a href="Blood,_toil,_tears,_and_sweat" title="wikilink">Blood, toil, tears, and sweat</a>" speech of 13 May, given 3 days after the start of the German offensive in the West; his first speech to Parliament as Prime Minister, reporting the formation of an all-party coalition government implacably resolved to fight on to ultimate victory.</li>
<li>The "<a href="We_shall_fight_on_the_beaches" title="wikilink">We shall fight on the beaches</a>" speech of 4 June, reporting the success of the Germans in over-running the Netherlands, Belgium and France north of the <a href="River_Somme" title="wikilink">Somme</a>, and the evacuation of the <a href="British_Expeditionary_Force_(World_War_II)" title="wikilink">BEF</a> from <a href="Dunkirk_evacuation" title="wikilink">Dunkirk</a>, and preparing the British to fight on alone, if necessary.</li>
<li>This speech, made to the House of Commons after France had sought an armistice on the evening of 16 June.<ref group="note">Churchill had already made a short wireless broadcast on the afternoon of 17 May
<blockquote>

<p>We have become the sole champions now in arms to defend the world cause...We shall defend our Island home, and with the British Empire we shall fight on unconquerable until the curse of Hitler is lifted from the brows of mankind. We are sure that in the end all will come right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He justified the low level of support it had been possible to give to France since Dunkirk, and reported the successful evacuation of most of the supporting forces. He resisted pressure to purge the coalition of appeasers, or otherwise indulge in recrimination. He reviewed the forces still available to prevent or repel any attempted invasion,<ref group="note">touching in passing upon (and making light of) the entry of Italy into the war on the side of Germany</ref></p>
<blockquote>

<p>We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come to gain sea superiority in these waters. If they seriously intend it, I shall only say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and safeguarded passage through the Straits of Gibraltar in order that he may play the part which he aspires to do. There is general curiosity in the British Fleet to find out whether the Italians are up to the level they were at in the last war or whether they have fallen off at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p> summing up the review as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and the country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon which we base our inflexible resolve to continue the war, and I can assure them that our professional advisers of the three Services unitedly advise that we should do so, and that there are good and reasonable hopes of final victory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He reported messages of support from the <a href="Dominion" title="wikilink">Dominions</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and justified confidence in victory, even if it was not yet clear how that victory could be achieved.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In casting up this dread balance-sheet, contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye, I see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion, but none whatever for panic or despair. During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced,...nothing but disaster and disappointment, and yet at the end their morale was higher than that of the Germans, who had moved from one aggressive triumph to another. During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question, "How are we going to win?" and no one was able ever to answer it with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us.</p>

<p>The speech was delivered to the Commons at 3:49 pm,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and lasted 36 minutes. Churchill – as was his habit – made revisions to his 23-page typescript right up to and during the speech. The final passage of his typescript was laid out in <a href="blank_verse" title="wikilink">blank verse</a> format, which Churchill scholars consider reflective of the influence of <a href="Old_Testament" title="wikilink">Old Testament</a> <a class="uri" href="psalms" title="wikilink">psalms</a> on his oratory style.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
