<p><strong>Dominican University of California</strong> is a 2,200-student institution in <a href="San_Rafael,_California" title="wikilink">San Rafael, California</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 1890 as <strong>Dominican College</strong> by the <a href="Dominican_Sisters_of_San_Rafael" title="wikilink">Dominican Sisters of San Rafael</a>, Dominican is one of the oldest universities in California.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="early-history">Early history</h3>
<p>The history of Dominican University of California can be traced back to 1850. It was in this year that <a href="Joseph_Sadoc_Alemany" title="wikilink">Joseph Sadoc Alemany</a> was appointed Bishop of Monterey. At the time of this appointment, he was in Italy attending a meeting of the <a href="Dominican_Order" title="wikilink">Dominican Order</a>, a Roman Catholic religious order founded by <a href="Saint_Dominic" title="wikilink">Saint Dominic de Guzmán</a> in France in 1216.</p>

<p>As Bishop Alemany was returning to his new post in California, he stopped in Paris at the Dominican Monastery of the Cross and expressed his desire to have a few Dominican Sisters join him to teach the children of the <a href="California_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">Forty-niners</a>. A Belgian <a class="uri" href="novice" title="wikilink">novice</a>, Sister Mary of the Cross Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name. In 1854, the Dominicans moved to Benicia.</p>
<p>Following the leadership of Mother Mary Goemaere, Mother Louis O'Donnell (1887-1929) moved the <a class="uri" href="motherhouse" title="wikilink">motherhouse</a>, a school and <a class="uri" href="novitiate" title="wikilink">novitiate</a> from Benicia to San Rafael in 1889.</p>
<p>In 1890 the Congregation of the Most Holy Name, under the auspices of Mother O'Donnell, filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of California. With the encouragement of faculty of the <a href="University_of_California_in_Berkeley" title="wikilink">University of California in Berkeley</a>, a junior college was opened in 1915, and in 1917 a four-year college, Dominican College, was formed. At that point Dominican College became the first Catholic college in California to grant the bachelor's degree to women. Originally a female-only institution, Dominican College became coeducational in 1971.</p>

<h3 id="traditions">Traditions</h3>
<h4 id="shield-ceremony">Shield Ceremony</h4>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Shield Ceremony at Dominican University of California</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each fall, the university holds a Shield Ceremony, a tradition that started in the 12th century when Saint Dominic Guzman created the Dominican order. It now continues every fall during Convocation, when the Dominican seniors officially greet the incoming freshmen with a special gift: an illustration of a shield that reflects an inspirational motto. The motto, written by the seniors, is intended to help guide the freshmen throughout their college years and beyond. Four years later at Commencement, a hand-crafted wood carving of the illustrated shield is presented to the graduating class. All of Dominican's shields, dating back to the early 1920s, are displayed on campus in the Meadowlands Residence Hall, Guzman Lecture Hall and the Shield Room.</p>
<h4 id="convocationfamily-weekend-formerly-spirit-week">Convocation/Family Weekend (formerly Spirit Week)</h4>
<p>Once a year, Dominican invites all students and their families for a three day celebration of the University and its students. It opens on Friday night with Convocation, a celebration of the academic achievements of Dominican students. Throughout the weekend, all are invited to explore the campus, attend special classes, meet with the President and faculty and cheer on the Dominican Penguins at competitive games. Family Weekend concludes on Sunday with an athletic scrimmage and tailgate party.</p>
<h4 id="senior-thesis">Senior thesis</h4>
<p>Most academic departments at Dominican require a senior thesis/project, a one-year culminating experience that offers evidence of accomplishment in a discipline or area of inquiry. Like a master’s thesis, the senior thesis gives students an opportunity as undergraduates, to explore in- depth issues that interest them. The major determines the nature of the thesis/project, which can take many forms: a research document, a novel, a business plan, a portfolio of poetry, or original works of art.</p>
<h4 id="baccalaureate-mass-hood-ceremony-commencement">Baccalaureate Mass, Hood Ceremony, Commencement</h4>
<p>Held the day prior to Commencement, Baccalaureate Mass is a unique tradition that reflects Dominican's Catholic heritage. The Mass, planned and led by members of the graduating classes, is held at St. Raphael's Church in downtown San Rafael. Students and their families, faculty, staff and friends of the University are invited to attend.</p>
<p>On the eve of Commencement, Dominican honors the academic achievement of graduating students with The Hood Ceremony. Each graduating senior and graduate student receives a hood, which is a colorful, historic symbol of scholastic excellence. This ceremony is a time-honored tradition in which the students and faculty wear their academic regalia. Conferral of the hood symbolizes that students have joined the community of educated people.</p>
<p>On a Saturday morning in May, the campus community joins graduating students, their families and friends for Commencement. The Dominican tradition includes a procession led by a bagpiper.</p>
<h3 id="clubs-and-organizations">Clubs and organizations</h3>
<p>There are more than forty student clubs and organizations at Dominican with categories including Athletics, Campus Diversity, Religious, Social and Major-Related.</p>
