He grew up in <a href="Wai'anae,_Hawai'i" title="wikilink">Wai'anae</a> and, after leaving school, debuted on the 1986 Gotcha Pro at <a href="Sandy_Beach" title="wikilink">Sandy Beach</a>, Oahu, beating the 1984 champ <a href="Tom_Carroll_(surfer)" title="wikilink">Tom Carroll</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>His top surfing achievement was becoming the <a href="Association_of_Surfing_Professionals" title="wikilink">ASP</a> <a href="ASP_World_Tour" title="wikilink">WCT</a> World Champion in 2000 but Garcia also holds the record for most <a href="World_Qualification_Series_(2009)" title="wikilink">WQS</a> event wins, 22,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and holds six <a href="Triple_Crown_of_Surfing" title="wikilink">Triple Crown of Surfing</a> titles. In addition, he was the second professional surfer to win over $1 million in prize money.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> He initially retired in 2005 but is now competing again, although in 2008, his hopes for <a href="ASP_World_Tour" title="wikilink">ASP World Tour</a> qualification were dashed with early elimination in the <a href="O'Neill_World_Cup_of_Surfing" title="wikilink">O'Neill World Cup of Surfing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<h3 id="personal">Personal</h3>

<p>Following his parents' divorce, Garcia lived with his mother near Mā'ili point, close to the beach.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> He was a dominant force in the Hawaiian Surfing Association and soon made the grade, as a 17-year-old, on the 1986 WCT, beating former champion Tom Carroll and threatening to cause an upset to the top 16. Despite this early promise he just failed to break into this elite group on his debut season but the following year he finished in 16th position.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Garcia showed great consistency throughout the 1990s, finishing in the top ten every year and coming third four times during that period. However, in 1995 it seemed that he might have reached the climax of his career. Failing to win the <a href="Billabong_Pipeline_Masters" title="wikilink">Pipeline Masters</a> to claim the title Sunny ended up finishing third behind <a href="Kelly_Slater" title="wikilink">Kelly Slater</a> and <a href="Rob_Machado" title="wikilink">Rob Machado</a>. With a host of talented young blood set to qualify for the 1996 Dream Tour and declining fitness levels, it seemed Garcia's era was over.</p>

<p>Then, four years later, things changed. Inspired by veteran <a href="Mark_Occhilupo" title="wikilink">Mark Occhilupo</a>'s shock 1999 WCT title, Garcia shed weight and moved to <a class="uri" href="Kauai" title="wikilink">Kauai</a>. There he surfed with the progressive Irons brothers, <a href="Andy_Irons" title="wikilink">Andy</a> and <a href="Bruce_Irons_(surfer)" title="wikilink">Bruce</a>, expanding his surfing repertoire.</p>

<p>In 2000, 14 years after his debut, Garcia achieved the ultimate surfing accolade, emphatically dominating the ASP WCT from the start of the campaign, winning the first two events in <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and clinching the title in <a class="uri" href="Brazil" title="wikilink">Brazil</a>, the penultimate event. On the way he also picked up a fifth Triple Crown in his native Hawaii.</p>

<p>After initially retiring from the professional surfing circuit in 2005, Garcia is now competing on the WQS again. In 2008, he started slowly but moved into the top ten after a fifth-place finish in <a class="uri" href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a>. Garcia was determined to win the series, and many people tipped him to do so but in the end early elimination in the O'Neill World Cup of Surfing, in his own back yard, meant he was denied a place on the 2009 Dream Tour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2009 he had surgery on his knee and finished the year strongly, following a quarter final berth in the Hawaiian pro with a runner-up spot to Triple Crown rival Joel Parkinson in the O'Neill World Cup. However his attempt to clinch a seventh Triple Crown was denied when he lost his Pipemasters place after arriving late for his heat. Some consolation would have come from his standout performance at the 'Quiksilver in memory of Eddie Aikau' big wave contest ("The Eddie"), in which he finished third.</p>

<p>As of June 2010, he was placed 67th in the new ASP World Rankings, his best result being a quarter-final finish on the 'Sponsor me now Sunset Open' in January.</p>

<p>Garcia has been a controversial figure, depicted as both volatile and easygoing by those who have met him. He has served prison time for tax evasion<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and been arrested for fighting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> According to <a href="ESPN.com" title="wikilink">ESPN TV</a>, his nickname Sunny was given to him by his mother, due to his cheerful disposition as an infant. He is known as a tough competitor but also someone who owes success to the anger he feels when surfing, which he often takes out physically on his competitors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> He has been married three times, most recently to Colleen McCullough in 2008, and has three teenage children from his first marriage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>In October 2006, Garcia was sentenced to federal prison for tax fraud after failing to pay taxes on unreported contest winnings from 1996 to 2001. Over USD471,000 in prize money went unclaimed, resulting in a three-month sentence, beginning January 12, 2007, plus a further 7 months of <a href="house_arrest" title="wikilink">house arrest</a> and 80 hours community service with <a href="Goodwill_Industries" title="wikilink">Goodwill</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> "I spent my money foolishly and didn't handle my affairs," he said outside the <a href="San_Diego" title="wikilink">San Diego</a> federal courtroom where he was sentenced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

The amateur cameraman was quoted as saying, <em>I'm too scared to press charges...Garcia could go to jail and then people would want to get me. At the moment I just don't feel safe...I've had threats on the internet I don't know how I'd protect myself and my family if something happened</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Garcia sought legal advice from high-profile Gold Coast lawyer <a href="Chris_Nyst" title="wikilink">Chris Nyst</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> On 3 May 2011, <a href="Queensland_Police_Service" title="wikilink">Queensland Police Service</a> confirmed an arrest warrant has been issued for a 41-year-old man on a charge of common assault, the reporting newspaper linked the warrant to Garcia.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> On 4 May 2011, Garcia's lawyer, Chris Nyst, confirmed the arrest warrant for Garcia, that it involves the young surfer who was allegedly assaulted, advised continued co-operation from Garcia with police and is confident his client would be exonerated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
