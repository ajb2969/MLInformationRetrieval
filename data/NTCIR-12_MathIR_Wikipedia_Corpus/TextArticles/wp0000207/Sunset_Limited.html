<h1>Sunset Limited</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong><em>Sunset Limited</em></strong> is a <a href="passenger_train" title="wikilink">passenger train</a> that for most of its history has run between <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, and <a href="Los_Angeles,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles, California</a> over the nation's second transcontinental route.</p>

<p>Both passenger totals and revenues have shown a steady improvement in recent years. During <a href="fiscal_year" title="wikilink">fiscal year</a> 2014, the <em>Sunset Limited</em> carried 105,000 passengers, an increase of 2.1% over FY2013, even as the total for all long distance service declined that year. But held back by running only three days a week (one of the two out of 15 long-distance trains that are not daily) the <em>Sunset Ltd.</em> carried the fewest passengers of any in the Amtrak system. For FY2014, it had a total revenue of <a href="US_dollar" title="wikilink">$</a>12,598,000, giving it a 2.6% increase over FY2013.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Amtrak Sunset Limited ]] West of New Orleans, the route was owned by the <a href="Southern_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> and is now owned by the <a href="BNSF_Railway" title="wikilink">BNSF Railway</a> and the <a href="Union_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Union Pacific Railroad</a>. The name <em>Sunset Limited</em> traces its origins to the <a href="Galveston,_Harrisburg_and_San_Antonio_Railway" title="wikilink">Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway</a>, which was known as the <em>Sunset Route</em> as early as 1874. On the portion of the route east of New Orleans, service was suspended after <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Those tracks, between New Orleans and Florida, include parts of the <a href="Atlantic_Coast_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">Atlantic Coast Line Railroad</a>, the <a href="Seaboard_Air_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">Seaboard Air Line Railroad</a>, and the <a href="Louisville_and_Nashville_Railroad" title="wikilink">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>—all now owned by <a href="CSX_Transportation" title="wikilink">CSX Transportation</a>.</p>

<p>Service on the <em>Sunset Limited</em> between New Orleans and Florida has been abandoned. The rail line in the path of <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a> east of New Orleans was washed out. The operating railroad <a class="uri" href="CSX" title="wikilink">CSX</a> restored the line itself between New Orleans and Jacksonville. However, it was deemed too expensive to rebuild to modern passenger rail standards. Amtrak identifies the route as suspended indefinitely.</p>

<p>At San Antonio, the <em>Sunset Limited</em> train and <em><a href="Texas_Eagle" title="wikilink">Texas Eagle</a></em> thru-cars are combined for the journey westward and split eastward.</p>

<p>A highlight of the trip is the crossing of the <a href="Huey_P._Long_Bridge_(Jefferson_Parish)" title="wikilink">Huey P. Long Bridge</a> just west of New Orleans. The bridge is one of the longest railroad bridges in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>, at ; it takes the train  above the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="wikilink">Mississippi River</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pre-amtrak">Pre-Amtrak</h3>

<p>Before the start of <a class="uri" href="Amtrak" title="wikilink">Amtrak</a> on May 1, 1971, the <em>Sunset Limited</em> was operated by the <a href="Southern_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Southern Pacific Railroad</a>. The <em>Sunset Limited</em> is the oldest named train in the United States, operating since November 1894 (though originally named the <strong><em>Sunset Express</em></strong>). The <em>Sunset Limited</em> was Southern Pacific's premier train.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Initially the <em>Sunset Limited</em> was an all-<a href="Pullman_(car_or_coach)" title="wikilink">Pullman</a> train, with sleeping cars and no coaches, running from <a href="New_Orleans" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a> to <a href="San_Francisco" title="wikilink">San Francisco</a> via <a href="Los_Angeles" title="wikilink">Los Angeles</a>. From its beginning in 1894 until streamlining in 1950, all the train's cars had 6-wheel trucks and dark olive green paint with black roofs and trucks. In summer 1926 it was scheduled at 71 hr 40 min New Orleans to San Francisco; it then carried a coast-to-coast sleeper Jacksonville to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In 1930 the route was cut back to Los Angeles and the train carried coaches for the first time. In 1936 the train resumed running to San Francisco and was one of SP's first trains to receive <a class="uri" href="air-conditioning" title="wikilink">air-conditioning</a>. In January 1942 it was cut back to Los Angeles; the <em>Sunset Limited</em> was never again all-Pullman and never again ran beyond Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The train was <a href="Dieselisation#Rail_transport" title="wikilink">dieselized</a> in late 1949 and became a <a class="uri" href="streamliner" title="wikilink">streamliner</a> in August 1950. The <em>Sunset Limited</em> was the last among the big American luxury trains to be streamlined but in 1950 the train got a new look, with stainless steel cars with red letterboards and white "Southern Pacific" lettering. All cars except the RPO-Baggage (which had 6-wheel trucks) had 4-wheel trucks. The last car of the train was a sleeping car with a blunt rear end and a lighted neon-sign with the train name on the rear door. Until 1950 the train was pulled by <a href="4-6-2#North_America" title="wikilink">4-6-2 Pacific</a> type and <a href="Southern_Pacific_class_GS-1" title="wikilink">4-8-4 GS-1 Northern</a> type steam locomotives between New Orleans and El Paso, and by <a href="4-8-2" title="wikilink">4-8-2 MT-4 Mountain</a> type and <a href="Southern_Pacific_class_GS-4" title="wikilink">4-8-4 GS-4 Northern</a> type steam locomotives between El Paso and Los Angeles/San Francisco. Occasionally, even some <a href="4-10-2" title="wikilink">4-10-2 Southern Pacific</a> type and <a href="Cab_forward#Southern_Pacific" title="wikilink">4-8-8-2 AC class Cab Forward</a> type steam locomotives could be seen, especially on the western portion of its run. Steam occasionally appeared on the <em>Sunset Limited</em> until 1953.</p>

<p>After dieselization <a href="ALCO_PA" title="wikilink">Alco PA A-A Unit</a> diesel locomotives powered the train between New Orleans and El Paso, and <a href="EMD_E7" title="wikilink">EMD E7</a> and <a href="EMD_E9" title="wikilink">E9</a> diesel locomotives in A-B-B sets pulled the train between El Paso and Los Angeles. Between 1950 and 1958 the diesel locomotives were painted in the Southern Pacific's "Daylight" scheme; in the 1960s and 70s <a href="EMD_F7" title="wikilink">EMD F7</a> diesel locomotives in SP's "Bloody Nose" scheme powered the train on the entire run.  A typical consist from the early 1950s included:</p>
<ul>
<li>An A-B-A Set of Alco PA-1 or an A-B-B Set of EMD E-7 diesel locomotives, both in Daylight colors</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Railway Post Office/Baggage</li>
<li>Baggage Dormitory</li>
<li>Partitioned Coach</li>
<li>Coach</li>
<li>Coach</li>
<li>Coffee Shop Lounge <em>Pride of Texas</em></li>

<li>10-roomette, 6-double bedroom sleeper</li>
<li>10-roomette, 6-double bedroom sleeper</li>
<li>10-roomette, 6-double bedroom blunt ended sleeper</li>
</ol>

<p>A typical consist between October 1970 and April 1971 (the last months under Southern Pacific's thrice-weekly operation):</p>
<ul>
<li>An A-B-A Set of EMD FP-7 units or a SDP-45 diesel locomotive, painted in the "Bloody Nose" scheme</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Box Car Baggage Express</li>
<li>Baggage Dormitory</li>

</ol>

<p>During the decline in the 1960s more and more services on board were cut back, culminating in the elimination of the dining car, lounge car and all sleeping cars. By 1968 the once proud streamliner had three cars: a baggage car, a coach and an automat lunch counter car. The <em>Sunset</em> was even combined with the <em><a href="Golden_State_(train)" title="wikilink">Golden State</a></em> passenger train west of El Paso in 1964. In October 1970 the <em>Sunset's</em> daily service between New Orleans and Los Angeles was reduced to tri-weekly, but with full dining and sleeping car service returning over the entire route. This was the state of the train when Amtrak took control in May 1971.</p>
<h3 id="amtrak">Amtrak</h3>

<p>Amtrak retained the <em>Sunset</em> unchanged, while it dropped the <em><a href="Gulf_Wind" title="wikilink">Gulf Wind</a></em>, which was operated between New Orleans and Jacksonville, Florida, by the <a href="Louisville_and_Nashville_Railroad" title="wikilink">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a> and the <a href="Seaboard_Coast_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">Seaboard Coast Line Railroad</a> (previously the <a href="Seaboard_Air_Line_Railroad" title="wikilink">Seaboard Air Line Railroad</a>).</p>

<p>The tracks between New Orleans and Jacksonville remained unused by passenger trains from the Amtrak takeover until April 29, 1984, when an Amtrak train called the <em><a href="Gulf_Coast_Limited" title="wikilink">Gulf Coast Limited</a></em>, running between New Orleans and <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile, Alabama</a>, began service, seeking to regenerate some form of regional intercity rail traffic between large cities, outside of the Northeast. However, this train only lasted until January 6, 1985. Almost five years later, on October 27, 1989, the track segment between Mobile and <a href="Flomaton,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Flomaton, Alabama</a>, came into passenger train use as part of the route of the <em><a href="Gulf_Breeze_(Amtrak)" title="wikilink">Gulf Breeze</a></em>. This was another attempt to regenerate regional intercity rail traffic, this time between Birmingham and Mobile, AL. The train was actually a reestablishment of the Mobile section of Amtrak's New York-to-New Orleans <em>Crescent</em>. It branched from the Crescent's route at Birmingham, AL, turning south heading toward <a href="Montgomery_(AL)" title="wikilink">Montgomery</a>, Flomaton, and terminating in Mobile. The <em>Gulf Breeze</em> was discontinued in 1995.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on April 4, 1993, the entire New Orleans-to-Jacksonville route reestablished passenger train service with the extension of the <em>Sunset Limited</em> to Jacksonville and later, Miami, using the route of Amtrak's <em><a href="Silver_Meteor" title="wikilink">Silver Meteor</a></em> south of Jacksonville. The train's eastern endpoint was later cut back from Miami to <a href="Orlando_(FL)" title="wikilink">Orlando</a> due to the difficulties associated with turning the equipment in time if either east or westbound trainset was delayed. Amtrak's operating reliability could never achieve the consistency needed to coordinate movements between what were two separate trains.</p>

<p>On September 22, 1993, the locomotives and some cars of the eastbound <em>Sunset Limited</em> derailed and fell off a bridge into water near <a href="Mobile,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Mobile, Alabama</a>, in Amtrak's worst <a href="train_wreck" title="wikilink">train wreck</a>, the <a href="Big_Bayou_Canot_train_disaster" title="wikilink">Big Bayou Canot train disaster</a>. 47 people died.</p>

<p>On October 9, 1995, <a href="1995_Palo_Verde,_Arizona_derailment" title="wikilink">saboteurs derailed</a> the <em>Sunset Limited</em> near <a href="Harqua,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Harqua, Arizona</a> by removing 29 spikes from a section of track, and short-circuited the signal system to conceal the sabotage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>On June 2, 1996, the <em>Sunset Limited</em> was rerouted to a more southerly route between <a href="Tucson,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Tucson, Arizona</a>, and <a href="Yuma,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Yuma, Arizona</a>, bypassing <a href="Phoenix,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, in order to accommodate the <a href="Union_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Union Pacific Railroad</a>'s desire to abandon a portion of its Phoenix-to-Yuma "West Line". This made Phoenix one of the largest cities in the nation without direct Amtrak passenger service, although the designated <a href="Maricopa_(Amtrak_station)" title="wikilink">Phoenix-area stop</a> is in <a href="Maricopa,_Arizona" title="wikilink">Maricopa</a>, a suburban community about 40 miles south of downtown Phoenix. (Some Phoenix passengers choose instead to travel to Tucson to board the train.) As of early 2006, however, the West Line had not yet been abandoned, and construction activities suggested that Union Pacific might reopen the line.</p>
<h3 id="katrina-and-aftermath">Katrina and aftermath</h3>

<p>On August 28, 2005, the <em>Sunset Limited</em> route was truncated at <a href="San_Antonio,_Texas" title="wikilink">San Antonio, Texas</a>, as a result of damage to trackage in the Gulf Coast area caused by <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="wikilink">Hurricane Katrina</a>. In late October 2005, service was restored between San Antonio and <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans</a>, as the line through <a class="uri" href="Louisiana" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a> had been repaired.</p>

<p>As time has passed, particularly since the January 2006 completion of the rebuilding of damaged tracks east of New Orleans by their owner <a href="CSX_Transportation" title="wikilink">CSX Transportation</a> Inc., the obstacles to restoration of the <em>Sunset Limited</em>'s full route have been more managerial and political than physical. Advocates for the train's restoration have pointed to revenue figures for Amtrak's fiscal year 2004, the last full year of coast-to-coast <em>Sunset Limited</em> service. During that period, the Orlando-New Orleans segment accounted for 41% of the <em>Sunset's</em> revenue.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>Section 226 of the <a href="Rail_Safety_Improvement_Act_of_2008" title="wikilink">Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008</a> (H.R. 2095), signed into law by President Bush on October 16, 2008, gave Amtrak nine months to provide Congress with a plan for restoring service that "shall include a projected timeline for restoring such service, the costs associated with restoring such service, and any proposals for legislation necessary to support such restoration of service."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>There has been a push for service by many people, but it is unclear when service restoration will start. Many local officials are for bringing back <em>Sunset Limited</em> or other Amtrak service.</p>
<h2 id="recent-changes-to-service">Recent changes to service</h2>

<p>In 2009, Brian Rosenwald, a now departed Amtrak executive, outlined ideas for a complete overhaul of the route, including daily service.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> It was to have the <em><a href="Texas_Eagle" title="wikilink">Texas Eagle</a></em> operate over the <em>Sunset</em>'s route west of <a href="San_Antonio,_Texas" title="wikilink">San Antonio</a>, with a stub train connecting San Antonio (with a cross-platform transfer) and New Orleans. The plans were halted when <a href="Union_Pacific_Railroad" title="wikilink">Union Pacific</a> stated that in order to get a daily <em>Sunset Limited</em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Amtrak would need to pay $750 million for infrastructure improvements.</p>

<p>The <em>Sunset</em> did receive a somewhat better schedule on May 7, 2012, moving its Westbound movements from New Orleans to a Monday, Wednesday, Saturday circuit. The changes restored daylight service to both Houston (11:10 a.m. eastbound, 6:18p westbound) and Tucson (7:28 a.m. eastbound, 6:45p westbound); a 10:00 p.m. departure from Los Angeles eastbound and a 5:35 a.m. arrival westbound; and arrival into New Orleans at 9:40 p.m. eastbound and departing westbound at 9:00 a.m.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The times allow several 7- to 12-hour rides between major-city pairs; for example, overnight between Tucson or Maricopa (for Phoenix) and Los Angeles in both directions.</p>

<p>In exchange for the Union Pacific speeding up the current three trains a week each way, Amtrak promised not to exercise its legal right to ask to increase the frequency to daily before 2015.</p>

<p>Passenger totals would double with daily service, according to the PRIIA study that looked at Texas Eagle/Sunset Limited service. It forecast an incremental improvement of more than 100,000 passengers from the daily service, which is already running in excess of 100,000 a year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In the meantime, the Union Pacific has double-tracked much of the route with its own money. However, Amtrak still lacks the equipment and funds needed to move to daily service.</p>
