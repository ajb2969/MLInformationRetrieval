<h1>Maneuverable reentry vehicle</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The <strong>maneuverable reentry vehicle</strong> (abbreviated <strong>MARV</strong> or <strong>MaRV</strong>) is a type of ballistic missile whose <a class="uri" href="warhead" title="wikilink">warhead</a> is capable of shifting targets in flight. It often requires some terminal active homing guidance (like Pershing II <a href="active_radar_homing" title="wikilink">active radar homing</a>) to make sure the missile does not miss the target, because of the frequent trajectory shifts. Refer to <a href="atmospheric_reentry" title="wikilink">atmospheric reentry</a>.</p>

<p>There are several types, of which examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="R-27_Zyb#R-27K" title="wikilink">R-27K</a> (SS-NX-13)</li>
<li>the active radar terminal-guidance version for the <a href="Pershing_II" title="wikilink">Pershing II</a> missile. The Pershing II's RV weighed  and traveled at Mach 8. It was fitted with four control fins to perform a 25-G pull-up after reentering the atmosphere, then glided  to the target and pitched into a terminal dive.</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="B-611" title="wikilink">B-611</a> (the variant on <a class="uri" href="DF-11" title="wikilink">DF-11</a>)</li>
<li>the high hypersonic land-based <a href="anti-ship_ballistic_missile" title="wikilink">anti-ship ballistic missile</a> variant of the <a class="uri" href="DF-21" title="wikilink">DF-21</a></li>
</ul>

<p> <em>Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle</em> (AMaRV) was a prototype MARV built by <a href="McDonnell_Douglas" title="wikilink">McDonnell-Douglas Corp.</a>. Four AMaRVs were made and represented a significant leap in Reentry Vehicle sophistication. Three of the AMaRVs were launched by <a href="LGM-30_Minuteman" title="wikilink">Minuteman-1 ICBMs</a> on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a "split-windward flap") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides. <a href="Hydraulic_machinery" title="wikilink">Hydraulic actuation</a> was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading <a href="anti-ballistic_missile" title="wikilink">anti-ballistic missile</a> (ABM) interception.</p>
