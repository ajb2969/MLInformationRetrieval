<h1>Mapp and Lucia</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Mapp and Lucia</em></strong> is a collective name for a series of novels by <a href="Edward_Frederic_Benson" title="wikilink">E. F. Benson</a>, and also the name for two British television adaptations based on those novels.</p>
<h2 id="the-novels">The novels</h2>

<p>The novels feature humorous incidents in the lives of (mainly) upper-middle-class British people in the 1920s and 1930s, vying for social prestige and <a class="uri" href="one-upmanship" title="wikilink">one-upmanship</a> in an atmosphere of extreme cultural <a class="uri" href="snobbery" title="wikilink">snobbery</a>. Several of them are set in the small seaside town of <a href="Tilling_(Sussex)" title="wikilink">Tilling</a>, closely based on <a href="Rye,_East_Sussex" title="wikilink">Rye, East Sussex</a>, where Benson lived for a number of years and (like Lucia) served as mayor. Lucia previously lived at <a class="uri" href="Riseholme" title="wikilink">Riseholme</a>, based on <a href="Broadway,_Worcestershire" title="wikilink">Broadway, Worcestershire</a>, from where she brought to Tilling her celebrated recipe for <a href="Lobster_a_la_Riseholme" title="wikilink">Lobster <em>à la Riseholme</em></a>.</p>

<p>"Mallards", the home of Miss Mapp—and subsequently Lucia—was based on <a href="Lamb_House" title="wikilink">Lamb House</a> in Rye. The house had previously been lived in by <a href="Henry_James" title="wikilink">Henry James</a> and had a garden room overlooking the street (unfortunately a German bomb destroyed the Garden Room in World War II. The rest of the house is now a National Trust property.)</p>

<p>The novels, in chronological order, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Queen Lucia</em> (1920)</li>
<li><em>Miss Mapp</em> (1922)</li>
<li><em>Lucia in London</em> (1927)</li>
<li><em>Mapp and Lucia</em> (1931)</li>
<li><em>Lucia's Progress</em> (1935) (published in the U.S. as <em>The Worshipful Lucia</em>)</li>
<li><em>Trouble for Lucia</em> (1939)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three books concern only the protagonist named in the title; the last three feature both Mapp <em>and</em> Lucia.</p>

<p>In 1977 Thomas Y. Cromwell Company reprinted all six novels in a compendium called <em>Make Way for Lucia</em>. The order of <em>Miss Mapp</em> and <em>Lucia in London</em> was switched in the compendium, and a Miss Mapp short story called "The Male Impersonator" was included between <em>Miss Mapp</em> and <em>Mapp and Lucia</em>.</p>

<p>"Desirable Residences", one further short story featuring Miss Mapp, and previously having seen only one magazine printing in Benson's own time, was discovered by Jack Adrian in the 1990s and included in his collection of Benson stories, <em>Desirable Residences</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A slight oddity about this very short piece, is that the town of Tilling was called Tillingham in the original printing, according to Jack Adrian's introduction to his collection. The characters of Miss Mapp and Diva Plaistow are clearly recognizable, however, as are their desirable residences. Miss Mapp, for example here lives in "Mallards", the fictional Lamb House that was always the Queen Castle vied for by Mapp and Lucia.</p>

<p>The character Susan Leg, appearing briefly in <em>Trouble for Lucia</em>, first appeared as a major character in Benson's novel <em>Secret Lives</em> (1932), which is similar in style to the Mapp and Lucia books.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="novels-by-other-authors">Novels by other authors</h2>

<p>There are also five other books based on the same characters written by other authors.</p>

<p><a href="Tom_Holt" title="wikilink">Tom Holt</a> wrote two sequels, published by Macmillan and Black Swan, which are written in a style and esprit of the originals. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lucia in Wartime</em> (1985)</li>
<li><em>Lucia Triumphant</em> (1986)</li>
</ul>

<p>Guy Fraser-Sampson has written three additional novels the first published by Troubador, the second and third by Elliott and Thompson Ltd:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Major Benjy</em> (2008)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the chronology of the novels set in Tilling this sits between <em>Miss Mapp</em> and <em>Mapp and Lucia</em>. The writing is in a more contemporary style than Benson and Holt's while retaining the typical plot devices of the earlier books. The book contains a number of minor character errors. There is however a delicious cake baking episode which is entirely in the spirit of the original novels.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lucia on Holiday</em> (2012)</li>
<li><em>Au Reservoir</em> (2014)</li>
</ul>

<p>The television series based on the three 1930s books, produced by <a href="London_Weekend_Television" title="wikilink">London Weekend Television</a>, was filmed in Rye and neighbouring <a class="uri" href="Winchelsea" title="wikilink">Winchelsea</a> in the 1980s, and starred <a href="Prunella_Scales" title="wikilink">Prunella Scales</a> as Mapp, <a href="Geraldine_McEwan" title="wikilink">Geraldine McEwan</a> as Lucia, <a href="Denis_Lill" title="wikilink">Denis Lill</a> as Major Benji Flint, and <a href="Nigel_Hawthorne" title="wikilink">Nigel Hawthorne</a> as Georgie. There were ten episodes, (which aired in two series of five) broadcast on <a href="Channel_4" title="wikilink">Channel 4</a> in 1985 and 1986.</p>
