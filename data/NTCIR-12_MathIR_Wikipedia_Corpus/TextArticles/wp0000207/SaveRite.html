<h1>SaveRite</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Save Rite</strong> is a <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">U.S.</a> chain of discount grocery stores owned by <a href="Winn-Dixie_(supermarket)" title="wikilink">Winn-Dixie</a>. The store offers a smaller selection and less customer support than most grocery stores.</p>

<p>The chain's marketing is based on its mascot <a href="Captain_Save-Rite" title="wikilink">Captain Save-Rite</a>, who is shown as a cartoon super-hero resembling <a href="Captain_America" title="wikilink">Captain America</a>.</p>

<p>Winn-Dixie created the Save-Rite brand as an experiment to increase its revenues and opened 11 stores throughout its distribution area. In November 2001, Winn-Dixie announced plans to convert nearly all of its 40-some Winn-Dixie and Winn-Dixie Marketplace brand stores in the metro <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a> area into Save-Rites as a last-ditch effort to keep a hold on its market share, which was rapidly declining due to stiff competition from <a class="uri" href="Wal-Mart" title="wikilink">Wal-Mart</a>, <a class="uri" href="Publix" title="wikilink">Publix</a>, <a class="uri" href="Kroger" title="wikilink">Kroger</a>, and other similar stores.</p>

<p>However in 2005, Save-Rite pulled out of the metro Atlanta area due to <a href="Winn-Dixie_(supermarket)" title="wikilink">Winn-Dixie</a>'s decision to close 386 stores. Prior to the latest cuts in February 2006, the only known states that have at least one Save-Rite are <a class="uri" href="Mississippi" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> and <a class="uri" href="Florida" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, most notably in the <a href="Orlando,_Florida" title="wikilink">Orlando</a> metro area, and in the <a href="Meridian,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Meridian</a>, <a class="uri" href="Mississippi" title="wikilink">Mississippi</a> area as well. On February 28, 2006, Winn Dixie announced that it would close about 11 additional Save Rite stores in Central Florida.</p>

<p>On August 18, 2011, Winn Dixie announced it was converting the six remaining Save-Rite locations to the Winn-Dixie banner. The conversion from SaveRite to Winn-Dixie will take about four months, during which time the stores will remain open. The conversion should be complete by the fall. All the SaveRite employees will continue working for Winn-Dixie.</p>
