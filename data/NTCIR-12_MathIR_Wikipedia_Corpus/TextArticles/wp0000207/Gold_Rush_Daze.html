<p><strong><em>Gold Rush Daze</em></strong> is a <a href="Merrie_Melodies" title="wikilink">Merrie Melodies</a> cartoon released on February 25, 1939.</p>
<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2>

<p>A prospector drives to the hills to dig for gold. A local gas station attendant goes on to explain that the prospector is wasting his time: since 1849, he had been chasing gold strikes around the world and never achieving success. The film shows the attendant's various stops including the <a href="California_Gold_Rush" title="wikilink">California Gold Rush</a>, the <a href="Comstock_Lode" title="wikilink">Comstock Lode</a>, and various other short appearances that never (literally) pan out. Yet as the attendant finishes his story, a passerby spreads the news that there has indeed been gold found in the hills, to which the attendant steals the prospector's car to get back in on the gold rush and hands the prospector the gas station.</p>

<p>Included in the film is a short, farcical musical number, “My Sweetheart Needs Gold for Her Deed.”</p>
