<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><em>The Morning Press</em> was founded by William J. Sproat and appeared on Monday, September 1, 1890. Mr. Sproat was its <a href="Ownership" title="wikilink">proprietor</a> until November 5, 1891, when control passed to the Press Publishing company. Soon after, the controlling interest in the company was purchased by George G. Booth, who in 1892 bought the rival <em>Grand Rapids Eagle</em> and merged it with the <em>Press</em>. January 1, 1893, the <em>Press</em> went into the evening daily field, which it has since occupied.</p>

<p>This newspaper at first was published at 63 Pearl Street. Then for a number of years it occupied a building on the <a href="Grand_River_(Michigan)" title="wikilink">Grand River</a> at the southeast end of the Pearl Street bridge. In 1906 it moved to a new home at Fulton Street and Sheldon Avenue.</p>

<p>The paper was published downtown at the corner of Monroe and Michigan until 2004 when the printing facility was moved to the northern suburb of <a href="Walker,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Walker</a>. The editorial and newsroom offices remain downtown. They hire aspiring journalists through an internship program.</p>

<p>Since October 2009, the <em>Press</em>{{'}} printing facility has been the printing facility for the <em><a href="Muskegon_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Muskegon Chronicle</a></em>. The Advance Newspapers are also printed at this facility, as is, since January 2012, the <em><a href="Kalamazoo_Gazette" title="wikilink">Kalamazoo Gazette</a></em>. Home delivery for the <em>Press</em>, <em>Chronicle</em> and <em>Gazette</em> were cut back to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays in 2012; on the other days in which the <em>Grand Rapids Press</em> is published, subscribers receive an e-edition of that day's newspaper. The print edition of each day's <em>Press</em> continues to be available in newsstands.</p>
