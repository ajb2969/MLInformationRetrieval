<h1>Category:Redirects to disambiguation pages</h1>
<hr/>

<p>These redirects are pointed to by links that should always point to the disambiguation page (via these redirects) rather than be disambiguated. As such, these redirects are restricted to only those that have "(disambiguation)" in their page titles. Contrast this to .</p>

<p>When using such redirects, "What links here" on a <a href="Wikipedia:Disambiguation_pages_with_links" title="wikilink">disambiguation page with links</a> sorts such links separately (e.g. see <a class="uri" href="Special:Whatlinkshere/Georgian" title="wikilink">Special:Whatlinkshere/Georgian</a>).</p>
