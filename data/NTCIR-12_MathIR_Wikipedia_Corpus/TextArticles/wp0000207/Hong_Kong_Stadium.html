<h1>Hong Kong Stadium</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Hong Kong Stadium</strong> is the main sports venue of <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>. Redeveloped from the old <strong>Government Stadium</strong>, it reopened as Hong Kong Stadium in March 1994. It has a maximum <a href="seating_capacity" title="wikilink">seating capacity</a> of 40,000, including 18,257 at the main level, 3,153 at executive level, 18,507 upper level seats and 57 seats for wheelchair users.</p>

<p>The stadium is located in <a href="So_Kon_Po" title="wikilink">So Kon Po</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong_Island" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Island</a>, a valley near <a href="Causeway_Bay" title="wikilink">Causeway Bay</a>. Most international <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">football</a> matches held in Hong Kong are held at this stadium. It is also the location for the <a href="Hong_Kong_Sevens" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Sevens</a> <a href="rugby_sevens" title="wikilink">rugby sevens</a> tournament. Hong Kong Stadium also hosted the <a href="Rugby_World_Cup_Sevens" title="wikilink">Rugby World Cup Sevens</a> twice, in 1997 and 2005.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><a href="So_Kon_Po" title="wikilink">So Kon Po</a> was formerly the burial ground for the 1918 fire at <a href="Happy_Valley_Racecourse" title="wikilink">Happy Valley Racecourse</a>. Then the <a href="Hong_Kong_Government" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Government</a> moved all the tombs to <a href="Aberdeen,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Aberdeen</a>. The old Government Stadium was a U-shaped constructed by 1953 and had a capacity of 28,000<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with partially covered seating. It witnessed the best times of Hong Kong football in the 60s and 70s. At the time, the stadium would be packed full of spectators when a top of the league clash happened and a red flag would be hoisted. Eager spectators without tickets would climb the hill behind the stadium to see the game.</p>

<p>The old Government Stadium was only partially covered, without sufficient seats or lighting systems. In the 90s, the <a href="Royal_Hong_Kong_Jockey_Club" title="wikilink">Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club</a> proposed a reconstruction plan so that Hong Kong can have a world class sports stadium.</p>

<p>Even before the reconstruction, the Government Stadium was Hong Kong's most important sports venue, with a clay running track around the football field. As the focus on the design was for football only, the track went to 450m, 50m longer than standard. Numerous schools held their athletic meetings here.</p>
<h3 id="re-construction-and-wembley-international">1994 Re-construction and Wembley International</h3>

<p>In the early 1990s, the Government Stadium was reconstructed into a 40,000-seat rectangular stadium. No running track was built due to the restricted land size. This forced the schools to look for alternative venues.</p>

<p>The stadium's management contract was won by Wembley International, a foreign subsidiary of <a href="Wembley_Stadium" title="wikilink">Wembley Stadium</a>, against strong competition, in March 1994.</p>

<p>From the first day there have been serious problems with the pitch. The owners of the stadium, the <a href="Urban_Council" title="wikilink">Urban Council</a>, were disappointed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It came under fire from local football officials, sports promoters and even <a href="Manchester_United" title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> manager <a href="Alex_Ferguson" title="wikilink">Alex Ferguson</a>, who said, before the exhibition match between Manchester United and <a href="South_China_AA" title="wikilink">South China AA</a> on 20 July 1997, "The pitch is cutting up. The surface is just sand-based and the turf doesn't hold well. Injuries can occur."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The government had hoped that the stadium could be used as a music concert venue in order to bring in more rental income. But nearby citizens complained endlessly about '<a href="noise_pollution" title="wikilink">noise levels</a>', leading to restrictions on noise levels that effectively rendered the stadium unsuitable for concerts. This reduced greatly the income levels of the stadium and the management company, <a class="uri" href="Wembley" title="wikilink">Wembley</a>, ran into financial troubles.</p>
<h3 id="hong-kong-government-takeover">1998 Hong Kong government takeover</h3>

<p>Wembley's management tenure at the stadium was abruptly terminated by the Provisional Urban Council (PUC) on 26 May 1998. PUC also asked Urban Services Department (USD) to assume temporary management of the Hong Kong Stadium and has also agreed to USD's proposals to returf the entire pitch of the Hong Kong Stadium.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The fundamental issue between the parties was the care and maintenance of the stadium pitch, but also a complaint about an unauthorized <a href="bungy_jump" title="wikilink">bungy jump</a> by Canadian <a href="Paul_G._Boyle" title="wikilink">Paul G. Boyle</a>.</p>

<p>In the end, the Hong Kong government was judged to have wrongfully terminated the management agreement and had to pay over HK$20million in damages to Wembley Plc.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Hong Kong Stadium is now managed by the <a href="Leisure_and_Cultural_Services_Department" title="wikilink">Leisure and Cultural Services Department</a> of Hong Kong, after the <a href="Urban_Council" title="wikilink">Urban Council</a> was disbanded.</p>
<h2 id="hong-kong-international-cricket-sixes">Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes</h2>

<p>The ground has hosted matches of the <a href="Hong_Kong_International_Cricket_Sixes" title="wikilink">Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes</a> since 1996 to 1997.</p>
<h2 id="muddy-turf-fiasco">2013 Muddy turf fiasco</h2>

<p>In 2013, during the <a href="2013_Premier_League_Asia_Trophy" title="wikilink">Barclays Asia Trophy</a>, Sunderland boss <a href="Paolo_Di_Canio" title="wikilink">Paolo Di Canio</a> described the pitch as 'a killer' while <a href="Manchester_City" title="wikilink">Manchester City</a> defender <a href="Matija_Nastasic" title="wikilink">Matija Nastasic</a> is injured on the mudheap pitch, but the young Serbian's injury was caused by a kick to the ankle according to <a href="Manchester_City_FC" title="wikilink">Manchester City FC</a> manager <a href="Manuel_Pellegrini" title="wikilink">Manuel Pellegrini</a>, who refused to blame the muddy pitch. But <a href="Tottenham_Hotspurs" title="wikilink">Tottenham Hotspurs</a> manager <a href="Andre_Villas-Boas" title="wikilink">Andre Villas-Boas</a> was in open revolt after seeing <a href="Jan_Vertonghen" title="wikilink">Jan Vertonghen</a>, a first-choice defender, pick up an ankle injury playing the surface. "If I can be sincere, I would prefer not to play, but this is the reality that we have to face," said the Portuguese on the eve of his side's friendly against <a href="South_China_AA" title="wikilink">South China AA</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> <a href="Manchester_United" title="wikilink">Manchester United</a> then cancelled their public training session at the stadium on Sunday amid concerns over the playing surface, did not want to further damage the playing surface or risk any injuries to their players, ahead of their exhibition match with <a href="Kitchee_SC" title="wikilink">Kitchee SC</a> on 29 July.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>On 30 July, the director of leisure and cultural services, Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee said returfing the much-criticized Hong Kong Stadium pitch is being considered, after football fans worldwide slammed the sodden, muddy surface during Barclays Asia Trophy matches on 24 and 27 July. South China FC chairman <a href="Steven_Lo" title="wikilink">Steven Lo</a> said in an official blog that recent matches have exposed a serious management problem. Chief Executive <a href="Leung_Chun-ying" title="wikilink">Leung Chun-ying</a> said he has asked the <a href="Home_Affairs_Bureau" title="wikilink">Home Affairs Bureau</a> and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department for short, medium and long-term remedies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<li>57 wheelchair spaces</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-use">Other use</h2>

<p>The stadium was supposed to be a <a href="multi-purpose_stadium" title="wikilink">multi purpose</a> entertainment and sports venue, due to its much greater capacity compared to the other popular and over used <a href="Hong_Kong_Coliseum" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Coliseum</a>, where nearly all uses are now strictly for popular entertainment. However, its open-air nature has led to noise complaints from residents in tower blocks surrounding the stadium. It has not been allowed to host entertainment events since 1999.</p>
