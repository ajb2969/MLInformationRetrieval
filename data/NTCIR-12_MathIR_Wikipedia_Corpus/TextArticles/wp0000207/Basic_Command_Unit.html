<h1>Basic Command Unit</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>Basic Command Unit</strong> (BCU) is the largest unit into which <a href="territorial_police_force" title="wikilink">territorial</a> <a href="British_Police" title="wikilink">British Police</a> forces are divided<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This may actually be called a BCU or may have another designation, such as <a href="Police_division" title="wikilink"><em>Division</em></a>, <a href="Police_area" title="wikilink"><em>Area</em></a>, <em>Local Policing Unit</em> (LPU), or <em>Local Policing Team</em> (LPT). There are 228 BCUs (or equivalent units) in England and Wales.</p>

<p>Most forces are divided into at least three BCUs and some have many more. Most BCUs are further subdivided into smaller units. The BCU is usually commanded by a <a href="Chief_Superintendent" title="wikilink">Chief Superintendent</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The <a href="Metropolitan_Police_Service" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Police</a> use the term <strong>Borough Operational Command Unit</strong> (BOCU) for regional units (which are based on the 32 <a href="London_boroughs" title="wikilink">London boroughs</a>). The term <strong>Operational Command Unit</strong> (OCU) is used for specialised units, for example the <a href="Aviation_Security_Operational_Command_Unit" title="wikilink">Aviation Security OCU</a>.</p>

<p><a href="West_Midlands_Police" title="wikilink">West Midlands Police</a> is split into 12 LPUs (Local Policing Units). Each LPU is in turn organized into four Core Policing Teams that manage its different core functions: <a href="West_Midlands_Police#Investigation_Teams" title="wikilink">Investigation</a>, <a href="West_Midlands_Police#Neighbourhood_Teams" title="wikilink">Neighbourhood</a>, <a href="West_Midlands_Police#Response_Teams" title="wikilink">Response</a> and <a href="West_Midlands_Police#Community_Action_&amp;_Priority_Teams_(CAPT)" title="wikilink">Community Action and Priority Team (CAPT)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Warwickshire_Police" title="wikilink">Warwickshire Police</a> has abolished BCUs, the first British territorial police force to do so. The force is now divided directly into five Districts, each headed by a <a href="Chief_Inspector" title="wikilink">Chief Inspector</a>. These were formerly grouped into two Areas (BCUs), North and South, each headed by a Chief Superintendent.</p>
