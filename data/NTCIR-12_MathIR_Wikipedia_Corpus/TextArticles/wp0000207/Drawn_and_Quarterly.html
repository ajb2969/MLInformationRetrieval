<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Drawn and Quarterly has become one of the most influential alternative comics publishers, along with <a href="Fantagraphics_Books" title="wikilink">Fantagraphics Books</a> of Seattle, WA. The publisher has a reputation for the quality of the books it publishes, both in terms of content as well as the books' paper, binding and design. The publisher's owner, Chris Oliveros, has a hands-off relationship with the artists he publishes.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Drawn and Quarterly was founded in 1990 by Montrealer Chris Oliveros, age 23 at the time.</p>

<p>Oliveros was inspired by <a href="Art_Spiegelman" title="wikilink">Art Spiegelman</a> and <a href="Françoise_Mouly" title="wikilink">Françoise Mouly</a>'s <em><a href="Raw_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Raw</a></em> to publish an arts comics periodical. He borrowed $2000 from his fatherHark! A Vagrant to fund starting the anthology magazine <em>Drawn and Quarterly</em>, which debuted in April, 1990. It was intended to be published four times a year, containing short arts comics. Soon, Oliveros realized there were arts comics which were too long to be contained in his magazine, and began publishing stand-alone <a href="comic_book" title="wikilink">comic books</a> and <a href="graphic_novel" title="wikilink">graphic novels</a>, beginning with <a href="Julie_Doucet" title="wikilink">Julie Doucet</a>'s comic book <em>Dirty Plotte</em>. <a href="Seth_(cartoonist)" title="wikilink">Seth</a>, <a href="Joe_Matt" title="wikilink">Joe Matt</a>, and <a href="Chester_Brown" title="wikilink">Chester Brown</a>, <a class="uri" href="Toronto" title="wikilink">Toronto</a>-based cartoonists who soon became associated with the publisher. In the early 2000s, Brown had a surprise bestseller with <em><a href="Louis_Riel_(comics)" title="wikilink">Louis Riel</a></em>. In 2003, <em>A Drawn and Quarterly Manifesto</em> was released, describing to booksellers how to stock and sell graphic novels.</p>

<p>As graphic novels became more popular with the public, Oliveros found the need for a publicist. He asked Peggy Burns, who was doing such work at <a href="DC_Comics" title="wikilink">DC Comics</a>, if she knew someone who could fill the job. Burns offered herself, and moved from New York City to Montreal. She was the company's third employee, and soon signed a distribution deal for the publisher with <a href="Farrar,_Straus_and_Giroux" title="wikilink">Farrar, Straus and Giroux</a>, which greatly expanded the company's exposure, while giving it a literary air. Drawn and Quarterly reduced the number of serialized titles it published, focusing on book-form comics such as collections and graphic novels. Business expanded over the next decade to the extent that the publisher employed nine people. In November, 2012 the Canadian radio program The Sunday Edition aired a documentary portrait of Drawn and Quarterly the contains interviews with cartoonist Lynda Barry, teenage blogger Tavi Gevinson founder Chris Oliveros and associate publisher Peggy Burns. Barry is very emotional when she describes how Drawn and Quarterly helped save her career.</p>

<p>In 2015, the publisher produced a collection titled <em>Drawn &amp; Quarterly: Twenty-Five Years of Contemporary Cartooning, Comics and Graphic Novels</em>, featuring of out-of-print work, remembrances, and essays by well-known writers such as <a href="Margaret_Atwood" title="wikilink">Margaret Atwood</a>. The same year, Oliveros stepped down as publisher to focus on his own cartooning, intending to self-publish the graphic novel <em><a href="The_Envelope_Manufacturer" title="wikilink">The Envelope Manufacturer</a></em>. In his place, Burns took over as publisher and creative director Tom Devlin became executive editor.</p>
<h2 id="librarie-drawn-quarterly">Librarie Drawn &amp; Quarterly</h2>

<p>In 2008, Drawn and Quarterly opened an English-language bookshop on Bernard Street in <a href="Mile_End,_Montreal" title="wikilink">Mile End, Montreal</a>, selling mostly comics. The shop also hosts book launches and signings, and has a stage for live music.</p>
<h2 id="showcase">Showcase</h2>

<p>From 2003 to 2008, Drawn and Quarterly published <em>Showcase</em>, an anthology magazine which offered greater visibility to lesser known authors. The magazine presented up to 3 authors in each of its five issues.</p>
<h2 id="imprints">Imprints</h2>

<p>in 2004, Drawn and Quarterly began an imprint for non-comics art books called Petit Livre. The publisher also has an imprint for children called Enfant, with which they have published the <a class="uri" href="Moomin" title="wikilink">Moomin</a> works of <a href="Tove_Jansson" title="wikilink">Tove Jansson</a> and <a href="Pippi_Longstocking" title="wikilink">Pippi Longstocking</a> comics by <a href="Astrid_Lindgren" title="wikilink">Astrid Lindgren</a> and <a href="Ingrid_Vang_Nyman" title="wikilink">Ingrid Vang Nyman</a>.</p>
