<p>The <strong>Odes of Solomon</strong> is a collection of 42 <a href="ode" title="wikilink">odes</a> attributed to <a class="uri" href="Solomon" title="wikilink">Solomon</a>. Various scholars have dated the composition of these religious poems to anywhere in the range of the first three centuries AD. The original language of the Odes is thought to have been either <a href="Greek_language" title="wikilink">Greek</a> or <a href="Syriac_language" title="wikilink">Syriac</a>, and to be generally <a href="Christianity" title="wikilink">Christian</a> in background.</p>
<h2 id="manuscript-history">Manuscript history</h2>

<p>The earliest extant manuscripts of the Odes of Solomon date from around the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century: the <a href="Coptic_language" title="wikilink">Coptic</a> <em><a href="Pistis_Sophia" title="wikilink">Pistis Sophia</a></em>, a <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a> quote of a verse of Ode 19 by <a class="uri" href="Lactantius" title="wikilink">Lactantius</a>, and the Greek text of Ode 11 in <a href="Papyrus_Bodmer" title="wikilink">Papyrus Bodmer</a> XI. Before the 18th century, the Odes were only known through Lactantius' quotation of one verse and their inclusion in two lists of religious literature.</p>

<p>The <a href="British_Museum" title="wikilink">British Museum</a> purchased the <em><a href="Pistis_Sophia" title="wikilink">Pistis Sophia</a></em> (<em>Codex Askewianus</em> BM MS. add. 5114) in 1785. The Coptic manuscript, a <a class="uri" href="codex" title="wikilink">codex</a> of 174 leaves, was probably composed in the late 3rd century. The manuscript contains the complete text of two of the Odes, portions of two others, and what is believed to be Ode 1 (this ode is unattested in any other manuscript and may not be complete). <em>Pistis Sophia</em> is a <a class="uri" href="Gnostic" title="wikilink">Gnostic</a> text composed in <a class="uri" href="Egypt" title="wikilink">Egypt</a>, perhaps a translation from Greek with <a href="Syria" title="wikilink">Syrian</a> provenance.</p>

<p>After the discovery of portions of the Odes of Solomon in <em>Pistis Sophia</em>, scholars searched to find more complete copies of these intriguing texts. In 1909, <a href="James_Rendel_Harris" title="wikilink">James Rendel Harris</a> discovered a pile of forgotten leaves from a Syriac manuscript lying on a shelf in his study. Unfortunately, all he could recall was that they came from the 'neighbourhood of the <a class="uri" href="Tigris" title="wikilink">Tigris</a>'. The manuscript (Cod. Syr. 9 in the <a href="John_Rylands_Library" title="wikilink">John Rylands Library</a>) is the most complete of the extant texts of the Odes. The manuscript begins with the second strophe of the first verse of Ode 3 (the first two odes have been lost). The manuscript gives the entire corpus of the Odes of Solomon through to the end of Ode 42. Then the <em><a href="Psalms_of_Solomon" title="wikilink">Psalms of Solomon</a></em> (earlier Jewish religious poetry that is often bound with the later Odes) follow, until the beginning of Psalm 17:38 and the end of the manuscript has been lost. However, the Harris manuscript is a late copy — certainly no earlier than the 15th century. In 1912, <a href="F._C._Burkitt" title="wikilink">F. C. Burkitt</a> discovered an older manuscript of the Odes of Solomon in the British Museum (BM Add. 14538). The <em>Codex Nitriensis</em> came from the Monastery of the Syrian in <a href="Wadi_El_Natrun" title="wikilink">Wadi El Natrun</a>, sixty miles west of <a class="uri" href="Cairo" title="wikilink">Cairo</a>. It presents Ode 17:7b to the end of Ode 42, followed by the Psalms of Solomon in one continuous numbering. Nitriensis is written in far denser script than the Harris manuscript, which often makes it illegible. However, Nitriensis is earlier than Harris by about five centuries (although Mingana dated it to the 13th century).</p>

<p>In 1955-6, Martin Bodmer acquired a number of manuscripts. Papyrus Bodmer XI appears to be a Greek scrap-book of Christian religious literature compiled in Egypt in the 3rd century. It includes the entirety of Ode 11 (headed ΩΔΗ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΤΟS), which includes a short section in the middle of the Ode that does not occur in the Harris version of it. Internal evidence suggests that this additional material is original to the Ode, and that the later Harris manuscript has omitted it.</p>
<h2 id="authorship">Authorship</h2>
<h3 id="language-and-date">Language and Date</h3>

<p>Although earlier scholars thought the Odes were originally written in Greek<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> or Hebrew,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> there is now a consensus that Syriac/Aramaic was the original language<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Their place of origin seems likely to have been the region of Syria. Estimates of the date of composition range from the 1st<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> to the 3rd<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> century, with many settling for on the 2nd century. Some have claimed that Ode 4 discusses the closing of the temple at <a href="Land_of_Onias" title="wikilink">Leontopolis</a> in Egypt which would date this writing about 73 CE.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> One of the strong arguments for an early date is the discovery of references and perhaps even quotations from the Odes in the writings of <a href="Ignatius_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> who was writing around 100 CE.</p>
<h3 id="liturgical-use">Liturgical Use</h3>

<p>The Odes of Solomon were, perhaps, composed for liturgical use. In the Syriac manuscripts, all of the Odes end with a <em><a class="uri" href="hallelujah" title="wikilink">hallelujah</a></em>, and the Harris manuscript marks this word in the middle of an ode by the Syriac letter <em>hê</em> (). The use of plural imperative and jussive verb-forms suggest that on occasion a congregation is being addressed. Bernard,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="David_Aune" title="wikilink">Aune</a>, Pierce<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and others who have commented on the Odes find in them clear early <a href="baptism" title="wikilink">baptismal</a> imagery — water is an ever present theme (floods, drinking the living waters, drowning and the well-spring) as is the language of conversion and initiation. <a href="James_H._Charlesworth" title="wikilink">Charlesworth</a> has led the criticism of this view.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<h3 id="evangelism">Evangelism</h3>

<p>The Odes reflect a surprising emphasis on spreading the knowledge of God, and conversion of others.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="relation-to-the-psalms-of-solomon">Relation to the Psalms of Solomon</h2>

<p>Technically the Odes are anonymous, but in many ancient manuscripts, the Odes of Solomon are found together with the similar <a href="Psalms_of_Solomon" title="wikilink">Psalms of Solomon</a>, and Odes began to be ascribed to the same author. Unlike the Psalms of Solomon, however, Odes is much less clearly <a class="uri" href="Jewish" title="wikilink">Jewish</a>, and much more <a class="uri" href="Christian" title="wikilink">Christian</a> in appearance. Odes explicitly refers not only to <a class="uri" href="Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesus</a>, but also to the ideas of <a href="Virgin_birth_of_Jesus" title="wikilink">virgin birth</a>, <a href="harrowing_of_hell" title="wikilink">harrowing of hell</a>, and the <a class="uri" href="Trinity" title="wikilink">Trinity</a>. <a href="Adolf_Harnack" title="wikilink">Adolf Harnack</a> suggested the work of a Christian interpolator, adjusting an originally Jewish text.</p>
<h2 id="relation-to-catholic-and-canonical-texts">Relation to Catholic and Canonical Texts</h2>

<p>There are parallels in both style, and <a class="uri" href="theology" title="wikilink">theology</a>, between Odes and the writing of <a href="Ignatius_of_Antioch" title="wikilink">Ignatius of Antioch</a>, as well as with the canonical <a href="Gospel_of_John" title="wikilink">Gospel of John</a>. For example, both Odes and John use the concept of Jesus as <a class="uri" href="Logos" title="wikilink">Logos</a>, and write in gentle <a href="metaphor" title="wikilink">metaphors</a>. Harris lists the following similarities in theme between the Odes and the <a href="Johannine_literature" title="wikilink">Johannine literature</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ is the Word</li>
<li>Christ existed before the foundation of the world (Odes 31, 33) (Others have questioned whether these texts speak of <a href="Pre-existence_of_Christ" title="wikilink">pre-existence</a>)</li>
<li>Christ bestows living water abundantly</li>
<li>Christ is the door to everything</li>
<li>Christ stands to His people in the relation of Lover to Beloved</li>
<li>Believers love the Lord because He first loved them (Ode 3.3)</li>
<li>Believers' love to the Christ makes them His friends (Ode 8)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>It has been suggested that Ode 22.12 ("the foundation of everything is Your [God's] rock. And upon it You have built Your kingdom, and it became the dwelling-place of the holy ones."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>) may be an earlier version of the saying in Matthew 16.18<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="relation-to-gnosticism">Relation to Gnosticism</h2>

<p>However, many have doubted the 'orthodoxy' of the Odes, suggesting that they perhaps originated from a <a href="heresy" title="wikilink">heretical</a> or <a href="gnosticism" title="wikilink">gnostic</a> group. This can be seen in the extensive use of the word 'knowledge' (Syr.  ; Gk. γνωσις gnōsis), the slight suggestion that the Saviour needed saving in Ode 8:21c (  — 'and the saved (are) in him who was saved') and the image of the Father having breasts that are milked by the Holy Spirit to bring about the incarnation of Christ. In the case of 'knowledge', it is always a reference to God's gift of his self-revelation, and, as the Odes are replete with enjoyment in God's good creation, they seem at odds with the gnostic concept of knowledge providing the means of release from the imperfect world. The other images are sometimes considered marks of heresy in the odist, but do have some parallel in early patristic literature. A number of scholars, considering the links with gnosticism have been overworked, now see the Odes as <a class="uri" href="gnosistic" title="wikilink">gnosistic</a> at most, due to the lack any kind of classical, gnostic doctrine, including <a class="uri" href="dualism" title="wikilink">dualism</a>, opposition to the material world, remote supreme divinity, emanation of divine beings. Thus, the Odes may be seen as existing in a time and place where gnosistic terms among non-gnostic Christians were still acceptable (for example, as demonstrated by <a href="Clement_of_Alexandria" title="wikilink">Clement of Alexandria</a> and the <a href="Johannine_literature" title="wikilink">Johannine literature</a>).</p>
<h2 id="modern">Modern</h2>

<p>The Odes of Solomon have inspired modern musicians and their projects. In 2010, composer John Schreiner released a two-disc album called <em>The Odes Project</em>, which is an adaptation of the Odes of Solomon into modern music.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The album <em>Odes</em> by Arthur Hatton, creator of LDS music website Linescratchers, was inspired by the Odes of Solomon and incorporated lines from the poems into its lyrics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
