<p><strong>Dorothy Annie Elizabeth Garrod</strong>, <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">CBE</a>, <a href="Fellow_of_the_British_Academy" title="wikilink">FBA</a> (5 May 1892 – 18 December 1968) was a British <a class="uri" href="archaeologist" title="wikilink">archaeologist</a> who was the first woman to hold an <a class="uri" href="Oxbridge" title="wikilink">Oxbridge</a> chair, partly through her pioneering work on the <a class="uri" href="Palaeolithic" title="wikilink">Palaeolithic</a> period; she served as <a href="Disney_Professor_of_Archaeology" title="wikilink">Disney Professor of Archaeology</a> from 1938 to 1952. Her father was <a href="Sir_Archibald_Garrod" title="wikilink">Sir Archibald Garrod</a>, the physician.</p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Garrod was raised at her family home in <a href="Melton,_Suffolk" title="wikilink">Melton, Suffolk</a> by a number of governesses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1913, she entered <a href="Newnham_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Newnham College, Cambridge</a> where she was one of very few women students. Garrod left Newnham with a second class degree and undertook war work until she was demobilised in 1919. By this time she had lost three brothers. She then went to <a class="uri" href="Malta" title="wikilink">Malta</a> where her father was working and to occupy herself she took an interest in the local antiquities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>When her father was appointed <a href="Regius_Professor_of_Medicine_(Oxford)" title="wikilink">Regius Professor of Medicine</a> at Oxford, Garrod decided to read for a Diploma in Anthropology at the <a href="Pitt_Rivers_Museum" title="wikilink">Pitt Rivers Museum</a>, <a href="University_of_Oxford" title="wikilink">University of Oxford</a>, where she was taught by <a href="Robert_Ranulph_Marett" title="wikilink">Robert Ranulph Marett</a>. It was Marett who inspired Garrod to be a prehistorian and she was then able to spend two years with the leading French prehistorian <a href="Abbé_Breuil" title="wikilink">Abbé Breuil</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Breuil had already visited Gibraltar and he recommended that Garrod investigate <a href="Devil's_Tower_Cave" title="wikilink">Devil's Tower Cave</a> which was only 350 metres from <a href="Forbes'_Quarry" title="wikilink">Forbes' Quarry</a> where a Neanderthal skull had been found previously. Devil's Tower Cave had been discovered by Breuil on an earlier visit to <a class="uri" href="Gibraltar" title="wikilink">Gibraltar</a> with <a href="William_Willoughby_Cole_Verner" title="wikilink">William Willoughby Cole Verner</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Garrod discovered the important Neanderthal skull now called <a href="Gibraltar_2" title="wikilink">Gibraltar 2</a> in this cave the early 1920s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Between 1925 and 1926 she excavated in <a class="uri" href="Gibraltar" title="wikilink">Gibraltar</a> and in 1928 led an expedition through South <a class="uri" href="Kurdistan" title="wikilink">Kurdistan</a> that led to the excavation of <a href="Hazar_Merd_Cave" title="wikilink">Hazar Merd Cave</a> and Zarzi cave.</p>

<p>The importance of Mount Carmel as a site in prehistory was only discovered because the British had decided that it would be a good source of quality stone for their plans to establish <a class="uri" href="Haifa" title="wikilink">Haifa</a> as the primary port into Palestine. A preliminary survey however found not only <a class="uri" href="Natufian" title="wikilink">Natufian</a> deposits but also prehistoric art objects and this was reported in the influential <a href="Illustrated_London_News" title="wikilink">Illustrated London News</a>. As a consequence, decisions were taken in London that there would not be a quarry and Garrod was requested to undertake further investigations into three caves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Garrod undertook excavations at <a href="Mount_Carmel" title="wikilink">Mount Carmel</a> in Palestine where, working closely with <a href="Dorothea_Bate" title="wikilink">Dorothea Bate</a>, she demonstrated a long sequence of <a href="Lower_Palaeolithic" title="wikilink">Lower Palaeolithic</a>, <a href="Middle_Palaeolithic" title="wikilink">Middle Palaeolithic</a> and <a class="uri" href="Epipalaeolithic" title="wikilink">Epipalaeolithic</a> occupations in the caves of <a href="Tabun_Cave" title="wikilink">Tabun</a>, El Wad, <a href="Es_Skhul" title="wikilink">Es Skhul</a>, <a class="uri" href="Shuqba" title="wikilink">Shuqba</a> (Shuqbah) and <a href="Kebara_Cave" title="wikilink">Kebara Cave</a>. Her work was a major contribution to the understanding of the prehistoric sequence in the region. She also coined the cultural label for the late Epipalaeolithic Natufian culture (from <a href="Wadi_an-Natuf" title="wikilink">Wadi an-Natuf</a>, the location of the <a href="Shuqba_cave" title="wikilink">Shuqba cave</a>) following her excavations at Es Skhul and El Wad. The chronological framework established by her excavations in the Levant remain crucial to the present understanding of that prehistoric period.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Her excavations at the cave sites in the Levant were conducted with almost exclusively women workers recruited from local villages, although she worked with fellow archaeologist <a href="Francis_Turville-Petre" title="wikilink">Francis Turville-Petre</a> at Kebara Cave, the type-site for the <a class="uri" href="Kebaran" title="wikilink">Kebaran</a> culture.  After holding a number of other academic posts she was made <a href="Disney_Professor_of_Archaeology" title="wikilink">Disney Professor of Archaeology</a> at Cambridge in 1939, a post she held until 1952, aside from a gap towards the end of the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a> when she served in the <a href="Women's_Auxiliary_Air_Force" title="wikilink">Women's Auxiliary Air Force</a>. She was based at the <a href="RAF_Medmenham" title="wikilink">RAF Medmenham</a> photographic interpretation unit as a section officer.</p>

<p>Dorothy Garrod was the first female professor at Cambridge. The first women University Teaching Officers were appointed to Cambridge University in 1921, and in 1926 Cambridge University women first gave women the titles of degrees but without associated privileges (i.e. no participation in University government). It was not until 1947 that full membership for women was granted by Cambridge University.</p>
<h2 id="awards-and-recognition">Awards and recognition</h2>

<p>Garrod was elected a Fellow of the <a href="British_Academy" title="wikilink">British Academy</a> in 1952. In 1965, she was awarded the <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">CBE</a>. She felt it was important that archaeologists travel and therefore left money to found the Dorothy Garrod Travel Fund.<ref>Price, K.M. 2009. <a href="http://academia.edu/469410/One_vision_one_faith_one_woman_Dorothy_Garrod_and_the_Cystallisation_of_Prehistory">One vision, one faith, one woman: Dorothy Garrod and the crystallisation of prehistory</a>.
