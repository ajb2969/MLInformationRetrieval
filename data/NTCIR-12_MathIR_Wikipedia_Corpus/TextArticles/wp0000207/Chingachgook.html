<h1>Chingachgook</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Chingachgook</strong> was a <a href="fictional_character" title="wikilink">fictional character</a> in four of <a href="James_Fenimore_Cooper" title="wikilink">James Fenimore Cooper</a>'s five <a href="Leatherstocking_Tales" title="wikilink">Leatherstocking Tales</a>, including <em><a href="The_Last_of_the_Mohicans" title="wikilink">The Last of the Mohicans</a></em>. Chingachgook was a lone <a class="uri" href="Mohican" title="wikilink">Mohican</a> chief and companion of the series' hero, <a href="Natty_Bumppo" title="wikilink">Natty Bumppo</a>. In <em><a href="The_Deerslayer" title="wikilink">The Deerslayer</a></em>, Chingachgook married Wah-ta-Wah, who bore him a son named Uncas, but died while she was still young. Uncas, who was at his birth "last of the Mohicans",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> grew to manhood but was killed in a battle with the Huron warrior <a class="uri" href="Magua" title="wikilink">Magua</a>. Chingachgook died as an old man in the novel <em><a href="The_Pioneers_(novel)" title="wikilink">The Pioneers</a></em>, which makes him the actual "last of the Mohicans," having outlived his son.</p>
<h2 id="etymology-and-pronunciation">Etymology and pronunciation</h2>

<p>Chingachgook is said to have been modeled after a real-life wandering Mohican basket maker and hunter named Captain John. The fictional character, occasionally called John Mohegan in the series, was an idealized embodiment of the traditional <a href="noble_savage" title="wikilink">noble savage</a>. <a href="French_people" title="wikilink">The French</a> often refer to Chingachgook as "<em>Le Gros Serpent</em>," the Great Snake, because he understands the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deadly blow.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The name is derived from the <a href="Lenape_language" title="wikilink">Lenape language</a>, which is closely related to the <a href="Mahican_language" title="wikilink">Mahican language</a>. In Lenape, <em>xinkw-</em> means 'big'<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and <em>xkuk</em> means 'snake'.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <em>Chingachgook</em> is derived from Lenape <em>xinkwi xkuk</em>, 'big snake', pronounced .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The digraph  in the spelling used by <a href="John_Heckewelder" title="wikilink">John Heckewelder</a>, the source for the name, and the letter  in modern Lenape spelling both represent the <a href="voiceless_velar_fricative" title="wikilink">voiceless velar fricative</a> sound  (as in "<a href="Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="wikilink">Bach</a>"), not the <a href="voiceless_palato-alveolar_affricate" title="wikilink">voiceless palato-alveolar affricate</a>  (as in "church").</p>

<p>Cooper got the name from Heckewelder's book <em>History, Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations who once inhabited Pennsylvania and the Neighboring States</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> (1818), which cited a Lenape word as "<em>chingachgook</em>" (in Heckewelder's spelling which was influenced by <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a>), meaning "a large snake." He gave this word as such in the context of how to use the adjective <em>xinkwi</em> (pronounced ) 'large', which Heckewelder spelled "chingue."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In the Ordeal Ceremony of the <a href="Order_of_the_Arrow" title="wikilink">Order of the Arrow</a>, a program of the <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="wikilink">Boy Scouts of America</a>, the Legend of the Order refers to an imaginary <a href="Lenni_Lenape" title="wikilink">Lenni Lenape</a> chief named Chingachgook. In the legend, Chingachgook's son, Uncas, is the original propagator of the Order. Chingachgook wanted to create a band of volunteers from all the nations of the <a href="Delaware_River" title="wikilink">Delaware River</a> valley to support and protect their collective interests. Uncas volunteered to be the first member of such a group, and thus the Order of the Arrow was founded.</p>

<p>According to the Boy Scouts of America's Ordeal Ceremony, the correct pronunciation of the name is ching-gatch-gook.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Professor William A. Starna, of SUNY Oneonta, says the initial "ch" sound would be pronounced more like the German guttural "h" than an English "ch." Chingachgook is an <a href="Algonquian_languages" title="wikilink">Algonquian</a> word meaning big (ching) snake (achgook); hence the references to the character in the book as The Great Serpent.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
