<h2 id="editorial-cartoons">Editorial cartoons</h2>

<p>Patrick Chappatte draws a twice-weekly cartoon in the Opinion section of <em>The International New York Times</em>, formerly known as the <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, which has published his work since 2001. His cartoons are featured on the newspaper's <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/patrick-chappatte/index.html">website</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, he has collaborated with editorial cartoonists in conflict-ridden countries with the goal of promoting dialogue through cartooning. These projects focused on Serbia, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Kenya and Guatemala. He described the work in a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/patrick_chappatte_the_power_of_cartoons.html">TED talk</a> in 2010.</p>

<p>In 2011, Chappatte won the Overseas Press Club of America’s Thomas Nast Award for best cartoons on international affairs, becoming the first non-American to win this prize.</p>
<h2 id="comics-journalism">Comics journalism</h2>

<p>Since 1995, Chappatte has worked in graphic journalism, or <a href="comics_journalism" title="wikilink">comics journalism</a>, a genre of reporting using the techniques of graphic novels. His most recent stories covered the war in Gaza (2009), the slums of Nairobi (2010) and gang violence in Central America (2012). These reports were published in several newspapers, including the INYT; one was turned into a <a href="http://www.bdreportage.com/en/death-in-the-field-the-film/">short animated documentary</a> in 2011. (see below)</p>
<h2 id="animated-documentary">Animated documentary</h2>

<p>Chappatte went to southern Lebanon in 2009, where people still live with the threat of actual time bombs, in the form of cluster-munition bomblets. While there, the editorial cartoonist created a report in comic-book format: <em><a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/audiovisuals/video/01079-a-death-in-the-field-video-2011.htm">Death in the Field</a></em>. The report was released in 2011 as an animated documentary. It was aired on Swiss and French TV, toured documentary festivals, and won an award in Australia.</p>

<p>Chappatte said the process of creating the documentary was both a personal and professional endeavour. "I have a Swiss father and a Lebanese mother, so I wanted to better understand the problems that the people of Lebanon are still facing, long after the fighting stopped," he said. "I also wanted to use my craft as a cartoonist, my experience as a journalist and my sense of satire to create a new kind of prism through which to view forgotten conflicts and a new technique for revealing the humanity behind the story."</p>
