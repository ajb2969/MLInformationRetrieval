<p>The <strong>River Itchen</strong> flows through east <a class="uri" href="Warwickshire" title="wikilink">Warwickshire</a> in <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>. It is a small river, about  long, and its general course is from south to north.</p>

<p>The River Itchen rises near <a class="uri" href="Wormleighton" title="wikilink">Wormleighton</a> at  and flows into a broad valley to the northeast of a range of <a class="uri" href="ironstone" title="wikilink">ironstone</a> hills which border Warwickshire and <a class="uri" href="Northamptonshire" title="wikilink">Northamptonshire</a>. The infant river is fed by several small <a href="stream" title="wikilink">brooks</a> and skirts the village of <a href="Bishop's_Itchington" title="wikilink">Bishop's Itchington</a> (to which it gives its name) before passing below the former <a href="Great_Western_Railway" title="wikilink">Great Western Railway</a> <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a> to <a class="uri" href="Birmingham" title="wikilink">Birmingham</a> railway (now operated by <a href="Chiltern_Main_Line" title="wikilink">Chiltern Trains</a>).</p>

<p>A mile-and-a-half north of Bishops Itchington, the River Itchen passes under <a href="Deppers_Bridge" title="wikilink">Deppers Bridge</a> which gives its name to the neighbouring hamlet. A mile further on it passes under the <a href="A425_road" title="wikilink">A425</a> main road west of the town of <a class="uri" href="Southam" title="wikilink">Southam</a>. Immediately after the bridge, it flows through <a href="Stoneythorpe_Park" title="wikilink">Stoneythorpe Park</a> and passes the hamlet of <a class="uri" href="Bascote" title="wikilink">Bascote</a>. A mile north of Bascote, the <a href="Grand_Union_Canal" title="wikilink">Grand Union Canal</a> crosses the Itchen valley on a half-mile long <a href="Embankment_(transportation)" title="wikilink">embankment</a> and is carried over the river on an <a href="Navigable_aqueduct" title="wikilink">aqueduct</a>.</p>

<p>The River Itchen reaches the large village of <a href="Long_Itchington" title="wikilink">Long Itchington</a> (again named from the river) and passes close to the church. West of the village, the river swings to the west briefly and its meandering course is bridged twice by the course of the disused <a href="Leamington_to_Rugby_line#Leamington_to_Weedon_line" title="wikilink">Leamington to Weedon</a> railway line, now a footpath and <a class="uri" href="cycleway" title="wikilink">cycleway</a>.</p>

<p>The River Itchen turns north again and three miles (5 km) further on it reaches <a href="Marton,_Warwickshire" title="wikilink">Marton</a> where it flows into the <a href="River_Leam" title="wikilink">River Leam</a> at .</p>
