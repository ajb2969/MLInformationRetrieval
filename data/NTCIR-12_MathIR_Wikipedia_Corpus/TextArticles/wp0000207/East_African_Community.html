<p>The <strong>East African Community</strong> (<strong>EAC</strong>) is an intergovernmental organisation composed of five countries in the <a href="African_Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">African Great Lakes</a> region in eastern Africa: <a class="uri" href="Burundi" title="wikilink">Burundi</a>, <a class="uri" href="Kenya" title="wikilink">Kenya</a>, <a class="uri" href="Rwanda" title="wikilink">Rwanda</a>, <a class="uri" href="Tanzania" title="wikilink">Tanzania</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Uganda" title="wikilink">Uganda</a>. <a href="Jakaya_Kikwete" title="wikilink">Jakaya Kikwete</a>, the president of Tanzania, is the EAC's chairman. The organisation was founded originally in 1967, collapsed in 1977, and was revived on 7 July 2000.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 2008, after negotiations with the <a href="Southern_Africa_Development_Community" title="wikilink">Southern Africa Development Community</a> (SADC) and the <a href="Common_Market_for_Eastern_and_Southern_Africa" title="wikilink">Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa</a> (COMESA), the EAC agreed to an expanded free trade area including the member states of all three organizations. The EAC is an integral part of the <a href="African_Economic_Community" title="wikilink">African Economic Community</a>.</p>

<p>The EAC is a potential precursor to the establishment of the <a href="East_African_Federation" title="wikilink">East African Federation</a>, a proposed federation of its members into a single <a href="sovereign_state" title="wikilink">sovereign state</a>. In 2010, the EAC launched <a href="#Common_market" title="wikilink">its own common market</a> for goods, labour, and capital within the region, with the goal of creating a common currency and eventually a full political federation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 2013 a protocol was signed outlining their plans for launching a monetary union within 10 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>The geographical region encompassed by the EAC covers an area of , with a combined population of about 149,959,317<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> (2013 est.)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda have had a history of co-operation dating back to the early 20th century. The customs union between Kenya and Uganda in 1917, which the then <a class="uri" href="Tanganyika" title="wikilink">Tanganyika</a> joined in 1927, was followed by the <a href="East_African_High_Commission" title="wikilink">East African High Commission</a> (EAHC) from 1948 to 1961, the <a href="East_African_Common_Services_Organization" title="wikilink">East African Common Services Organization</a> (EACSO) from 1961 to 1967, and the 1967 to 1977 EAC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Burundi and Rwanda joined the EAC on 6 July 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Inter-territorial co-operation between the <a href="Kenya_Colony" title="wikilink">Kenya Colony</a>, the <a href="Uganda_Protectorate" title="wikilink">Uganda Protectorate</a>, and the <a href="Tanganyika_Territory" title="wikilink">Tanganyika Territory</a> was first formalised in 1948 by the EAHC. This provided a <a href="customs_union" title="wikilink">customs union</a>, a <a href="common_external_tariff" title="wikilink">common external tariff</a>, currency, and postage. It also dealt with common services in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC was replaced by the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties because of the lack of joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position. In 1967, the EACSO was superseded by the EAC. This body aimed to strengthen the ties between the members through a common market, a common customs tariff, and a range of public services to achieve balanced economic growth within the region.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1977, the EAC collapsed after ten years. Causes for the collapse included demands by Kenya for more seats than Uganda and Tanzania in decision-making organs,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> disagreements with Ugandan dictator <a href="Idi_Amin" title="wikilink">Idi Amin</a> who demanded that Tanzania as a member state of the EAC should not harbor forces fighting to topple a government of another member state, and the disparate economic systems of socialism in Tanzania and capitalism in Kenya.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The three member states lost over sixty years of co-operation and the benefits of economies of scale, although some Kenyan government officials celebrated the collapse with champagne.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Later, Presidents <a href="Daniel_arap_Moi" title="wikilink">Moi</a> of Kenya, <a href="Ali_Hassan_Mwinyi" title="wikilink">Mwinyi</a> of Tanzania, and <a href="Yoweri_Kaguta_Museveni" title="wikilink">Museveni</a> of Uganda signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation in Arusha, Tanzania, on  1993 and established a Tri-partite Commission for Co-operation. A process of re-integration was embarked on involving tripartite programmes of co-operation in political, economic, social and cultural fields, research and technology, defence, security, and legal and judicial affairs.</p>

<p>The EAC was finally revived on 30 November 1999, when the treaty for its re-establishment was signed. It came into force on 7 July 2000, 23 years after the total collapse of the defunct erstwhile community and its organs. A <a href="customs_union" title="wikilink">customs union</a> was signed in March 2004, which commenced on 1 January 2005. Kenya, the region's largest exporter, continued to pay duties on goods entering the other four countries on a declining scale until 2010. A common system of <a href="tariff" title="wikilink">tariffs</a> will apply to goods imported from third-party countries.</p>
<h2 id="political-dimensions">Political dimensions</h2>

<p>It has been argued, perhaps humorously, that the key drivers for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are that Kenya wishes to export surplus capital, Uganda seeks an outlet for its surplus labour, and Tanzania wants to realise a Pan-African vision.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> It has also been argued, however, that the commonalities go far deeper. Many of the national elites old enough to remember the former EAC often share memories and a sharp sense of loss at its eventual dissolution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> More cynically, others have argued that this historical ambition potentially provides politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Some have questioned the extent to which the visions of a political union are shared outside the elite and the relatively elderly, arguing that the youthful mass of the population is not well informed about the process in any of the countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Others have pointed to an enhanced sense of East African identity developing from modern communications.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Commitment to the formal EAC idea is relatively narrow, in both social and generational terms, and thus many have questioned the timetable for the project. Fast-tracking political union was first discussed in 2004 and enjoyed a consensus among the three presidents of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Thus, a high-level committee headed by Amos Wako of Kenya was commissioned to investigate the possibility of speeding integration so as to achieve political federation sooner than previously visualised.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Yet, there have been concerns that rapid changes would allow popular reactionary politics against the project.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> There has been an argument, however, that there are high costs that would be required at the beginning and that fast-tracking the project would allow the benefits to be seen earlier.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>There remain significant political differences between the states. Museveni's success in obtaining his third-term amendment raised doubts in the other countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> The single-party dominance in the Tanzanian and Ugandan parliaments is unattractive to Kenyans, while Kenya's ethnic-politics remains absent in Tanzania.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Rwanda has a distinctive political culture with a political elite committed to building a developmental state, partly to safeguard the Tutsi group against a return to ethnic violence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Other problems involve states being reluctant to relinquish involvement in other regional groups, e.g., Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA but staying within the SADC bloc for the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations with the <a href="European_Union" title="wikilink">European Union</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Many Tanzanians are also concerned because creating a common market means removing obstacles to the free movement of both labour and capital.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Free movement of labour may be perceived as highly desirable in Uganda and Kenya, and have important developmental benefits in Tanzania; however, in Tanzania there is widespread resistance to the idea of ceding land rights to foreigners, including citizens of Kenya and Uganda.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Iformal polls have indicate that most Tanzanians (80 percent) have an unfavorable view of the East African Federation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Tanzania has more land than all the other EAC nations combined, and some Tanzanians fear landgrabs by the current residents of the other EAC member nations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="expansion">Expansion</h2>

<p>In 2010, Tanzanian officials expressed interest in inviting <a class="uri" href="Malawi" title="wikilink">Malawi</a>, the <a href="Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" title="wikilink">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Zambia" title="wikilink">Zambia</a> to join the EAC. Malawian Foreign Affairs Minister <a href="Etta_Banda" title="wikilink">Etta Banda</a> said, however, that there were no formal negotiations taking place concerning Malawian membership.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="south-sudan">South Sudan</h3>

<p>The presidents of Kenya and Rwanda invited the <a href="Autonomous_Government_of_Southern_Sudan" title="wikilink">Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan</a> to apply for membership upon the independence of <a href="South_Sudan" title="wikilink">South Sudan</a> in 2011,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> and South Sudan was reportedly an applicant country as of mid-July 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> Analysts suggested that South Sudan's early efforts to integrate infrastructure, including <a href="rail_transport_in_South_Sudan" title="wikilink">rail links</a> and oil pipelines,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> with systems in Kenya and Uganda indicated intention on the part of <a href="Juba,_South_Sudan" title="wikilink">Juba</a> to pivot away from dependence on <a class="uri" href="Sudan" title="wikilink">Sudan</a> and toward the EAC. <a class="uri" href="Reuters" title="wikilink">Reuters</a> considers South Sudan the likeliest candidate for EAC expansion in the short term,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> and an article in Tanzanian daily <em><a href="The_Citizen_(Tanzania)" title="wikilink">The Citizen</a></em> that reported <a href="East_African_Legislative_Assembly" title="wikilink">East African Legislative Assembly</a> Speaker <a href="Abdirahin_Haithar_Abdi" title="wikilink">Abdirahin Haithar Abdi</a> said South Sudan was "free to join the EAC" asserted that analysts believe the country will soon become a full member of the regional body.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>On 17 September 2011, the <em><a href="Daily_Nation" title="wikilink">Daily Nation</a></em> quoted a South Sudanese MP as saying that while his government was eager to join the EAC, it would likely delay its membership over concerns that its economy was not sufficiently developed to compete with EAC member states and could become a "dumping ground" for Kenyan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan imports.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> This was contradicted by President <a href="Salva_Kiir" title="wikilink">Salva Kiir</a>, who announced South Sudan had officially embarked on the application process one month later.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The application was initially deferred by the EAC in December 2012,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> however incidents with Ugandan <a class="uri" href="boda-boda" title="wikilink">boda-boda</a> operators in South Sudan have created political tension and may delay the process.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>In December 2012, Tanzania officially agreed to South Sudan’s bid to join the EAC, clearing the way for the world’s newest state to become the regional bloc’s sixth member.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> In May 2013 The EAC set aside $82,000 for the admission of South Sudan into the bloc even though admission may not happen until 2016. The process, to start after the EAC Council of Ministers meeting in August 2013, was projected to take at least four years. At the 14th Ordinary Summit held in Nairobi in 2012, EAC heads of state approved the verification report that was presented by the Council of Ministers, then directed it to start the negotiation process with South Sudan.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p>A team was formed to assess South Sudan's bid; however, in April 2014, the nation requested a delay in the admissions process, presumably due to <a href="South_Sudanese_conflict_(2013–2014)" title="wikilink">ongoing internal conflict</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="sudan">Sudan</h3>

<p><a class="uri" href="Sudan" title="wikilink">Sudan</a> applied to join the EAC, but its membership is strongly opposed by Tanzania and Uganda. They contend that because of Sudan's lack of a direct border with the EAC, its allegedly discriminatory actions toward <a href="black_people" title="wikilink">black Africans</a>, its record of human rights violations, and its history of hostilities with both Uganda and candidate country South Sudan, it is ineligible to join.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Sudan's application was rejected by the EAC in December 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="somalia">Somalia</h3>

<p>Representatives of <a class="uri" href="Somalia" title="wikilink">Somalia</a> applied for membership in the EAC in March 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> The application was considered by the EAC Heads of State in December 2012, which requested that the EAC Council work with Somalia to verify their application.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> In February 2015, the EAC again deliberated on the matter but deferred a decision as verification had not yet started nor had preparations with the government of Somalia been finalized.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>

<p>Although one of the official languages of the EAC is English, <a href="Swahili_language" title="wikilink">Swahili</a> is spoken throughout the <a href="African_Great_Lakes" title="wikilink">African Great Lakes</a> region and is also official. Swahili is a <a href="Bantu_languages" title="wikilink">Bantu language</a>, with some vocabulary derived (about 15%) from Arabic due to trading between Arabs and local Bantu populations on the coast. The remaining lexion is mainly derived from Coastal Bantu languages. At first the Swahili language used the <a href="Arabic_script" title="wikilink">Arabic script</a>, but it now uses the <a href="Latin_script" title="wikilink">Latin script</a> as a result of colonisation. In the EAC, there are two countries whose official language is <a href="French_(language)" title="wikilink">French</a>: Rwanda and Burundi. Numerous local languages are spoken: for example, there are 56 <a href="Languages_of_Uganda" title="wikilink">local languages spoken</a> in <a class="uri" href="Uganda" title="wikilink">Uganda</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> and 42 <a href="Languages_of_Kenya" title="wikilink">local languages</a> in Kenya. <a class="uri" href="Kinyarwanda" title="wikilink">Kinyarwanda</a> is spoken in <a class="uri" href="Rwanda" title="wikilink">Rwanda</a> as well as <a class="uri" href="Uganda" title="wikilink">Uganda</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> There are some native speakers of Arabic on the <a class="uri" href="Zanzibar" title="wikilink">Zanzibar</a> Island of Tanzania.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> In Kenya and Uganda, the medium of instruction in all schools is English.

<p>Currently, <a class="uri" href="Mombasa" title="wikilink">Mombasa</a> has the East African Community's busiest port.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> However, the construction of a new port in Kenya, known as the <a href="LAPSSET" title="wikilink">Lamu Port</a> is underway.

<p>Africa's largest airport terminal is also under construction in Nairobi. Known as the <a href="JKIA#Greenfield_Terminal" title="wikilink">Greenfield Terminal</a>, it will be capable of handling 20 million passengers a year. The estimated cost is 55 billion <a href="Kenyan_shilling" title="wikilink">Kenyan shillings</a> (US$654 million).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="business-and-finance">Business and finance</h3>

<p>Even though Dar es Salaam has a larger population, <a class="uri" href="Nairobi" title="wikilink">Nairobi</a> would be considered the business, finance and transport hub in the EAC. The East Africa Community's largest firms are headquartered in the city, including the region's largest carrier <a href="Kenya_Airways" title="wikilink">Kenya Airways</a>, the region's largest media house the <a href="Nation_Media_Group" title="wikilink">Nation Media Group</a> and the <a href="Kenya_Commercial_Bank_Group" title="wikilink">Kenya Commercial Bank Group</a>, the EAC's largest financial conglomerate. Most multinational firms (including Google, Coca Cola and Toyota) have their regional headquarters in Nairobi including <a class="uri" href="UNEP" title="wikilink">UNEP</a> which is the forth UN Office in the world as well as the only UN office located in Africa, or any developing country. Nairobi is also home to the <a href="Nairobi_Securities_Exchange" title="wikilink">Nairobi Securities Exchange</a> the largest within the EAC. The exchange is Africa's 4th largest in terms of trading volumes, and 5th largest in terms of Market Capitalization as a percentage of GDP.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> Nairobi's JKIA is the East Africa Community's busiest aviation hub it handles about 5-6 million passengers a year.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-the-customs-union">Importance of the customs union</h3>

<p>The key aspects of the customs union include:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>a Common External Tariff (CET) on imports from third countries;</li>
<li>duty-free trade between the member states; and</li>
<li>common customs procedures.</li>
</ol>

<p>Different rates are applied for raw materials (0%), intermediate products (10%) and finished goods (25%), the latter percentage is fixed as the maximum.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> This represents a significance decrease from what was previously the maximum in Kenya (35%), Tanzania (40%) and Uganda (15%).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> However, this customs union is not yet fully implemented, because there is a significant list of exclusions to the Common External Tariff and tariff-free movement of goods and services.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> Technical work is also needed to harmonise and modernise the customs procedures in the EAC's major ports of entry.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

<p>The expected revenue benefits are understood to be minimal by many analysts, based on comparative-static simulation exercises demonstrating the one-off impacts of the immediate introduction of the CU's full tariff package.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> The findings suggest an increase in intraregional trade that is largely the result of trade diversion, not trade creation, with some aggregate welfare benefits in Kenya and Tanzania but welfare losses in Uganda.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> From a trade-integration perspective, the EAC may not be the best chosen unit, because the current trade between the three countries is small compared to their external trade, and the EAC's  citizens do not represent a large market in global terms, given the very low average incomes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>Business leaders are far more positive than economists about the benefits of EAC integration, its customs union as a step in the process, as well as the wider integration under COMESA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> The larger economic players perceive long-term benefits in a progressively expanding regional market.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Pattern of regional development are already emerging, including:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Kenyan firms have successfully aligned to the lower protection afforded by the EAC CET and fears that firms would not adjust to a 25% maximum CET, or would relocate to Tanzania or Uganda have not been realised.</li>
<li>An intraregional division of labour is developing that results in basic import-processing relocating to the coast to supply the hinterland. The final stages of import-processing (especially those bulky finished goods that involve high transportation costs) and natural-resource based activities, are moving up-country and up-region, either within value chains of large companies or different segments located by firms in different countries.</li>
<li>Trade in goods and services has already increased as service provision to Kenyans and Tanzanians is already important for Uganda (in education and in health). Kenya exports financial services, for example via the Kenya Commercial Bank and purchase and upgrading of local operators in Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan. Uganda hopes integration will help support its tourism potential through integration with established regional circuits.</li>
<li>There are signs a business culture oriented to making profits through economics of scale and not on protectionism.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trade-negotiations">Trade negotiations</h3>

<p>The EAC negotiates with trade partners on behalf of all member countries. Negotiations in 2014 for an EU-EAC <a href="Economic_Partnership_Agreement" title="wikilink">Economic Partnership Agreement</a> (EPA) ran into difficulties with the January 2014 negotiating session failing to conclude the negotiations, which were scheduled to be completed before 1 October 2014. This caused tensions between Kenya and other countries as Kenya, which is not a <a href="Least_Developed_Country" title="wikilink">Least Developed Country</a>, stood to lose most from the failure to reach agreement.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> Discussions are also under way between the EAC and the USA on the launch of Trade and Investment Partnership (TIP) negotiations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="poverty-reduction">Poverty reduction</h3>

<p>EAC economies have large informal sectors, unintegrated with the formal economy and large business.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> The concerns of large-scale manufacturing and agro-processing concerns are not broadly shared by the bulk of available labour.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> Research suggest the promised investments on the conditions of life of the region's overwhelmingly rural poor will be slight, with the significant exception of agro-industrial firms with out-grower schemes or that otherwise contribute to the co-ordination of smallholder production and trade.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>It is informal trade across borders that is most often important to rural livelihoods and a customs union is unlikely to significantly impact the barriers that this faces and taxes are still being fixed separately by countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a> However, the introduction of one-stop border posts being introduced and the reduction in tariff barriers are coming down progressively.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>The establishment of a common market will create both winners (numerous food producers and consumers on both sides of all borders) and losers (smugglers and the customs, police and local government officers who currently benefit from bribery at and around the borders) in the border areas.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a> More substantial impact could be attained by a new generation of investments in world-market production based on the region's comparative advantages in natural resources (especially mining and agriculture) and the new tariff structure creates marginally better conditions for world-market exporters, by cheapening inputs and by reducing upward pressures on the exchange rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="common-market">Common market</h3>

<p> On 1 July 2010, Kenyan President <a href="Mwai_Kibaki" title="wikilink">Mwai Kibaki</a> officially launched the East African Common Market Protocol, an expansion of the bloc's existing customs union that entered into effect in 2005.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a> The protocol will lead to the free movement of labour, capital, goods and services within the EAC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> Member states will have to change their national laws to allow the full implementation of some aspects of the Common Market such as immigration and customs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> This legislation may take up to five years for each of the countries to enact fully but official recognition of the common market took place on .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a> Kenya expects that its citizens will begin to enjoy freedom of movement in the EAC within two months.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a> Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi have already agreed to waive work permit fees for EAC citizens.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a> The Common Market is seen as a step towards implementation of the common currency by 2012 and full political federation in 2015.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a> Kenyan businesses complain that the benefits of the Common Market only exist on paper by 2011, and that all the work remains to be done. Arbitrary rules and delays continue to make trade between Kenya and Tanzania expensive and difficult.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p>The free movement of people in the EAC is set to be improved with the introduction of "third generation" ID cards. These cards will identify the holder as a dual citizen of their home country and of "East Africa".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> Third generation cards are already in use in Rwanda with Kenya set to introduce them in July 2010 and the other countries following afterwards.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a> Mutual recognition and accreditation of higher education institutions is also being worked towards as is the harmonisation of social security benefits across the EAC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>

<p>The new treaty may be fast tracked with plans drawn up in 2004 to introduce a <a href="monetary_union" title="wikilink">monetary union</a> with a common currency, the <a href="East_African_shilling" title="wikilink">East African shilling</a>, some time between 2012 and 2015. There were also plans for a <a href="political_union" title="wikilink">political union</a>, the <a href="East_African_Federation" title="wikilink">East African Federation</a>, with a common President (initially on a rotation basis) and a common parliament by 2010. However, some experts like those based out of the public think tank <a href="Kenya_Institute_for_Public_Policy_Research_and_Analysis" title="wikilink">Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analysis</a> (KIPPRA), noted that the plans were too ambitious to be met by 2010 because a number of political, social and economic challenges are yet to be addressed. The fast tracking is currently the subject of National Consultative discussions, and a final decision was to be taken by the EAC Heads of State in mid-2007.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a> In 2013 a protocol was signed outlining their plans for launching a monetary union within 10 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="single-tourist-visa">Single tourist visa</h3>

<p>It had been hoped that an East African Single Tourist Visa may have been ready for November 2006, if it was approved by the relevant sectoral authorities under the EAC's integration programme. Had it been approved, the visa would have been valid for all three current member states of the EAC (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). Under the proposal for the visa, any new EAC single visa could be issued by any member state's embassy. The visa proposal followed an appeal by the tourist boards of the partner states for a common visa to accelerate promotion of the region as a single tourist destination and the EAC Secretariat wanted it approved before November's World Travel Fair (or World Travel Market) in London.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a> When approved by the EAC's council of ministers, tourists could apply for one country's entry visa which would then be applicable in all regional member states as a single entry requirement initiative.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>

<p>A single tourist visa for the EAC countries of Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda was to be available on 1 January 2014.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a> However, the launch date was postponed due to bureaucratic issues.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="east-african-court-of-justice">East African Court of Justice</h2>

<p>The <a href="East_African_Court_of_Justice" title="wikilink">East African Court of Justice</a> is the judicial arm of the Community. The court has original jurisdiction over the interpretation and application of the 1999 Treaty that re-established the EAC and in the future may have other original, appellate, human rights or other jurisdiction upon conclusion of a protocol to realise such extended jurisdiction. It is temporarily based in Arusha, Tanzania.</p>
<h2 id="east-african-legislative-assembly">East African Legislative Assembly</h2>

<p>The <a href="East_African_Legislative_Assembly" title="wikilink">East African Legislative Assembly</a> (EALA) is the legislative arm of the Community. The EALA has 27 members who are all elected by the National Assemblies or Parliaments of the member states of the Community. The EALA has oversight functions on all matters that fall within the Community's work and its functions include debating and approving the budget of the Community, discussing all matters pertaining to the Community and making recommendations to the Council as it may deem necessary for the implementation of the Treaty, liaising with National Assemblies or Parliaments on matters pertaining to the Community and establishing committees for such purposes as it deems necessary. Since being inaugurated in 2001, the EALA has had several sittings as a <a href="Plenary_session" title="wikilink">plenum</a> in Arusha, Kampala, and Nairobi.</p>

<p>The current Speaker of the Assembly is Margaret Zziwa from Uganda who replaced Abdirahin Haithar H. Abdi from Kenya. The Assembly has been credited with crucial bills, particularly those regarding regional and international trade, including EAC's stand on issues such as the World Trade Organisation and transport on Lake Victoria.</p>

<p>The East African passport was officially launched on  1999.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> The East African passport has been introduced as a travel document to ease border crossing for EAC residents.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> It is valid for travel within the EAC countries only and will entitle the holder to a multi entry stay of renewable six months' validity in any of the countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> The passport is issued in three of the five EAC member states (<a class="uri" href="Kenya" title="wikilink">Kenya</a>, <a class="uri" href="Uganda" title="wikilink">Uganda</a> and <a class="uri" href="Tanzania" title="wikilink">Tanzania</a>).

Although the passport is only valid within the EAC, modalities of internationalising the East African passport were being discussed with the aim towards having a common travel document for EAC residents by 2006.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p>Other measures meant to ease border crossing for East African Community residents include the issuance of interstate passes (which commenced on  2003), a single immigration Departure/Entry card (adopted by all three member states), the finalisation of harmonised procedures of work permits and the classification process, and the compilation of studies on the Harmonization of Labour Laws and Employment Policies (now in its final stages).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
