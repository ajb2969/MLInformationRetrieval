<h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>

<p>Grossman was born in <a href="Bloomington,_Indiana" title="wikilink">Bloomington, Indiana</a> in 1980,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the son of Rex Daniel Grossman II and Maureen Grossman. Under the motivation and guidance of his father, he began playing football at an early age in grade school. He originally started his football career as a running back. Despite his success running the ball, his mother asked his coach to convert him to a quarterback while he was in the sixth grade.</p>

<p>Grossman attended <a href="Bloomington_High_School_South" title="wikilink">Bloomington High School South</a>, where he played <a href="high_school_football" title="wikilink">high school football</a> for the Bloomington South Panthers.

<h3 id="chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</h3>

<p>The Chicago Bears selected Grossman during the first round of the <a href="2003_NFL_Draft" title="wikilink">2003 NFL Draft</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and he played for the Bears from  to .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Under the leadership of coach <a href="Dick_Jauron" title="wikilink">Dick Jauron</a>, Grossman was sidelined as a rookie in favor of veteran quarterbacks <a href="Chris_Chandler" title="wikilink">Chris Chandler</a> and <a href="Kordell_Stewart" title="wikilink">Kordell Stewart</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Grossman only saw playing time during the later portion of the season after the Bears had been eliminated from playoff contention. His season ended when he was forced to leave the final game with a broken finger.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> Prior to the start of the <a href="2004_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2004 NFL season</a>, the Bears fired Jauron and hired <a href="Lovie_Smith" title="wikilink">Lovie Smith</a>, who declared Grossman the team's starting quarterback. Grossman was criticized when he threw a game-ending interception against the Detroit Lions on opening day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Criticism of his durability intensified when he damaged his knee ligaments while scrambling for a touchdown against the <a href="Minnesota_Vikings" title="wikilink">Minnesota Vikings</a>. The injury forced Grossman to spend the remainder of the season recuperating.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>Grossman missed most of the <a href="2005_NFL_season" title="wikilink">2005 season</a> after breaking his ankle in a preseason game. On December 18, 2005, Grossman returned to the field, leading the Bears to a 16–3 victory over the <a href="Atlanta_Falcons" title="wikilink">Atlanta Falcons</a>. In the following game against the <a href="Green_Bay_Packers" title="wikilink">Green Bay Packers</a>, he completed eleven of sixteen passes for 166 yards for a touchdown and one interception in a 24–17 victory. Grossman’s victory enabled the Bears to clinch a playoff berth and the <a href="National_Football_Conference" title="wikilink">National Football Conference</a>'s second playoff seed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> In his first playoff game, Grossman struggled to anchor the Bears’ offense, completing 17 of 41 passes for 192 yards for one touchdown and an interception in a 29–21 loss against the <a href="Carolina_Panthers" title="wikilink">Carolina Panthers</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>During the <a href="2006_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">2006 Chicago Bears season</a>, Grossman became the first Bears quarterback to start all sixteen games since <a href="Erik_Kramer" title="wikilink">Erik Kramer</a> in <a href="1995_Chicago_Bears_season" title="wikilink">1995</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> In a season dubbed as a <em>"roller coaster ride"</em> by Grossman himself, the fourth-year quarterback had several productive performances, which were seemingly diluted by a handful of turnover-ridden games, especially in Week 6 against the <a href="Arizona_Cardinals" title="wikilink">Arizona Cardinals</a>, where Grossman fumbled twice and threw four interceptions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> While earning a passer rating of at least 100 in seven games, he earned a sub 50 rating in five games during the latter portion of the season. Grossman, who was named as the NFC Offensive Player of the Month in September, concluded the season's final month with a 64.4 passer rating, including a zero rating during the season’s finale game against the Packers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Grossman's work ethic drew criticism, when he admitted that he was not adequately prepared to play, and later claimed the game to be "meaningless."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> After noticing that his words had been misinterpreted, he rationalized his statement days later.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> His inconsistent performance drew criticism, and calls for Smith to bench Grossman in favor of the veteran <a href="Brian_Griese" title="wikilink">Brian Griese</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Smith, who supported Grossman throughout the season, declared that Grossman would remain the Bears’ starting quarterback throughout the playoffs,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> causing much skepticism within the Chicago area.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> He temporarily silenced his critics by leading the Bears to a 27–24 victory over the <a href="Seattle_Seahawks" title="wikilink">Seattle Seahawks</a>, completing 21 of 38 passes for 282 yards and one interception, fumble, and touchdown.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> The following week, he led the Bears to 39–14 victory over the <a href="New_Orleans_Saints" title="wikilink">New Orleans Saints</a>, which allowed the Bears to claim the <a href="NFC_Championship" title="wikilink">NFC Championship</a> and advance to <a href="Super_Bowl_XLI" title="wikilink">Super Bowl XLI</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the Super Bowl, Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes, including a one-yard touchdown pass.

<p>Grossman's <a href="Glossary_of_American_football#G" title="wikilink">gunslinger</a> attitude is illustrated in his desire to throw long passes, similar to his youth idol, <a href="Brett_Favre" title="wikilink">Brett Favre</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> During the 2006 season, Grossman had an above average completion rate when throwing passes of twenty or more yards, but struggled to complete shorter passes. According to columnist Paul Attner of <em>Sporting News</em>, this attitude contributed to Grossman's inconsistent play.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> During Week 12 of the 2006 season, Grossman threw a game-ending interception while attempting a deep pass to <a href="Rashied_Davis" title="wikilink">Rashied Davis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> However, during the divisional game in the <a href="2006–07_NFL_playoffs" title="wikilink">2006 playoffs</a>, he threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Berrian on the opening play of the Bears’ second drive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p>Additionally, Grossman's ability to elude pursuers and <a href="Quarterback_scramble" title="wikilink">scramble</a> has significantly decreased since his season ending leg injury in 2004.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a> Although he only played three games in 2004, Grossman amassed more rushing yards than he did in sixteen games in 2006.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a> However, he showed his potential to scramble during a game against the <a href="St._Louis_Rams" title="wikilink">St. Louis Rams</a>, after he converted a third and long with a twenty-two yard run.

<p>Grossman has also earned several nicknames over the course of his football career.
