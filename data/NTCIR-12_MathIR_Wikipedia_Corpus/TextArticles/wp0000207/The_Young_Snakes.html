<h1>The Young Snakes</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>The Young Snakes</strong> were an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> band formed in <a class="uri" href="Boston" title="wikilink">Boston</a> in the early 1980s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Lead singer and bassist <a href="Aimee_Mann" title="wikilink">Aimee Mann</a> formed the group after she dropped out of <a href="Berklee_College_of_Music" title="wikilink">Berklee College of Music</a> along with guitarist/singer Doug Vargas and drummer Dave Bass Brown. Brown left the band in the fall of 1981 to help form the Boston hardcore punk band <a href="Negative_FX" title="wikilink">Negative FX</a>, and was replaced by former D Club drummer Mike Evans.</p>

<p>After releasing the song "Brains and Eggs" on the <a href="Modern_Method_Records" title="wikilink">Modern Method</a> compilation <em>A Wicked Good Time</em>, the band released a five-song EP, 1982’s <em><a href="Bark_Along_with_The_Young_Snakes" title="wikilink">Bark Along with The Young Snakes</a></em>, on Ambiguous Records. The compilation album <em>Aimee Mann &amp; The Young Snakes</em>, released in 2004, included "Brains and Eggs" and a radio performance, but not the <em>Bark Along</em> tracks.</p>

<p>Mann has described the band as "a little punk noise-art outfit," noting that the group’s "break every rule" ethos became a rule in itself, and that her later band <a href="Til_Tuesday" title="wikilink">’Til Tuesday</a> was a rebellion against The Young Snakes’ lack of interest in "sweetness and melody."</p>
