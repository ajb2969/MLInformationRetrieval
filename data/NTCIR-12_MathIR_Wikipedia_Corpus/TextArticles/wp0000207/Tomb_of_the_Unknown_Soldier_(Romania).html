<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In 1923 it was decided to choose one of the fallen soldiers to represent all who had sacrificed their lives during the <a href="Romania_during_World_War_I" title="wikilink">war</a>.</p>

<p>Ten unidentified soldiers who died at <a href="Battle_of_Mărăşeşti" title="wikilink">Mărăşeşti</a>, <a href="Battle_of_Mărăşti" title="wikilink">Mărăşti</a>, <a class="uri" href="Oituz" title="wikilink">Oituz</a>, <a href="Târgu_Ocna" title="wikilink">Târgu Ocna</a>, <a href="Târgu_Jiu" title="wikilink">Jiu</a>, <a href="Prahova_County" title="wikilink">Prahova</a>, <a class="uri" href="Bucharest" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>, in <a class="uri" href="Dobruja" title="wikilink">Dobruja</a>, <a class="uri" href="Transylvania" title="wikilink">Transylvania</a> and <a class="uri" href="Bessarabia" title="wikilink">Bessarabia</a> were exhumed and laid in oak coffins, doubled with zinc, inside the "<a href="Assumption_of_Mary" title="wikilink">Assumption of Mary</a>" Church in <a class="uri" href="Mărășești" title="wikilink">Mărășești</a>.</p>

<p>On May 13, 1923, the war orphan <a href="Amilcar_Săndulescu" title="wikilink">Amilcar Săndulescu</a>, student at the "<a href="Dimitrie_Sturdza" title="wikilink">Dimitrie Sturdza</a>" Military High School, knelt in front of the fourth coffin and said: "<em>This is my father</em>". After the Unknown Soldier had been chosen, the other nine coffins were buried with military honors in the Heroes' Cemetery in Mărăşeşti.</p>

<p>On May 15, 1923, the Unknown Soldier's coffin, wrapped in a <a href="Flag_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Romanian Tricolour</a>, was placed on board of a special train to <a class="uri" href="Bucharest" title="wikilink">Bucharest</a>, where it was waited for by the King <a href="Ferdinand_of_Romania" title="wikilink">Ferdinand</a>, state officials and an <a href="honor_guard" title="wikilink">honor guard</a>. Laid on a cannon carriage pulled by eight horses, the coffin was transported in a long procession to the "<a href="Michael_the_Brave" title="wikilink">Mihai Vodă</a>" Church and remained there for 2 more days, so the people could pay their last respects.</p>

<p>On May 17, 1923 (which was also <a href="Holidays_in_Romania" title="wikilink">Heroes' Day</a>/<a href="Ascension_of_Jesus_Christ" title="wikilink">Ascension Day</a>), the coffin was buried inside a crypt in <a href="Carol_Park" title="wikilink">Carol Park</a> with full military honors in the presence of the Royal family, the Government, members of Parliament, and numerous members of the public. The stone slab of the crypt read: "<em>Here lies at rest happily unto the Lord the Unknown Soldier, who sacrificed his life for the unity of the Romanian people. On his bones lies the land of united Romania. 1916–1919.</em>"</p>

<p>On the night of December 22/23, 1958, the Unknown Soldier’s monument was dismantled and moved, in great secrecy, to the <a class="uri" href="Mărășești" title="wikilink">Mărășești</a> Mausoleum by the <a href="Communist_Romania" title="wikilink">Communist regime</a> to make room for the <a href="Carol_Park#Mausoleum" title="wikilink">Mausoleum of the Communist Heroes</a>, where several leaders of the <a href="Romanian_Communist_Party" title="wikilink">Party</a> were later interred (among them <a href="Gheorghe_Gheorghiu-Dej" title="wikilink">Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej</a>).</p>

<p>In 1991, after the fall of the regime, the Tomb was moved back into the Carol Park, closer to its original location.</p>

<p>In 2007 the Tomb was moved even closer to its original 1923 location, right next to the communist mausoleum.</p>
