It subsequently appeared on her 1993 album <em><a href="When_I_Was_a_Boy" title="wikilink">When I Was a Boy</a></em>, and later appeared on a second film soundtrack, <em><a href="Pay_It_Forward_(film)" title="wikilink">Pay It Forward</a></em>. The version of "The Life Is The Red Wagon" is the single version, whereas <em><a href="A_Collection_1984-1989" title="wikilink">A Collection 1984-1989</a></em> features the more stripped-down album version.</p>
