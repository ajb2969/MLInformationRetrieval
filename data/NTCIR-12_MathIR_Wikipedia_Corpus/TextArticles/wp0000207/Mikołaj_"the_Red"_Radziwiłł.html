<hr/>
<p> <strong>Mikołaj Radziwiłł</strong>, nicknamed <em>The Red</em> (<a href="Polish_language" title="wikilink">Polish</a> <em>Rudy</em>, <a href="Lithuanian_language" title="wikilink">Lithuanian</a>: <em>Radvila Rudasis</em>) also known as <em>Mikołaj Radziwiłł the Sixth</em> (1512-1584) was a <a href="Lithuanian_nobility" title="wikilink">Lithuanian noble</a> (<a href="szlachta" title="wikilink">szlachcic</a>), <a href="Count_palatine" title="wikilink">Count Palatine</a> of <a class="uri" href="Vilnius" title="wikilink">Vilnius</a>, <a href="Grand_Chancellor_of_Lithuania" title="wikilink">Grand Chancellor of Lithuania</a>, and <a href="Grand_Lithuanian_Hetman" title="wikilink">Grand Lithuanian Hetman</a> (from 1576) in the <a href="Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania" title="wikilink">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> and later in <a href="Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth" title="wikilink">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. Together with his <a class="uri" href="cousin" title="wikilink">cousin</a> <a href='Mikołaj_"the_Black"_Radziwiłł' title="wikilink">Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł</a> and the <a class="uri" href="Radziwill" title="wikilink">Radziwill</a> family were granted title and position as <a class="uri" href="Reichsfürst" title="wikilink">Reichsfürst</a> Prince of the <a href="Holy_Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">Holy Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Mikołaj Radziwiłł spent many years as a military commander. While not the most famous of Commonwealth hetmans, under king <a href="Stefan_Batory" title="wikilink">Stefan Batory</a> he was fairly successful in defending the eastern borders of the Commonwealth against the <a class="uri" href="Muscovy" title="wikilink">Muscovy</a>.</p>
<p>His political career was marked by his alliance with his cousin <a href='Mikołaj_"Czarny"_Radziwiłł' title="wikilink">Mikolaj 'Black' Radziwiłł</a>, with whom he opposed the other notable Lithuanian families in the rivalry for the dominant status in the Great Duchy. This alliance marked the formation of a dynastic-like cooperation between Radziwiłłs and showed how family interests could affect magnates relations with the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Mikołaj Radziwiłł became an advocate of <a href="Lithuania" title="wikilink">Lithuanian</a> sovereignty and thus a vocal opponent of political union with <a class="uri" href="Poland" title="wikilink">Poland</a>, (<a href="Union_of_Lublin" title="wikilink">Union of Lublin</a>, 1569). Unlike the other magnates he refused to sign the Act, as harmful to the interests of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</p>
<p>He was one of the most prominent converts and advocates of the <a class="uri" href="Protestant" title="wikilink">Protestant</a> faith in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and his line of the family became devoted members and defenders of the <a href="Lithuanian_Evangelical_Reformed_Church" title="wikilink">Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church</a> until its extinction.</p>
<p>In the Holy Roman Empire, the Trąby Coat of Arms was situated in the center of a Black Eagle in a golden Shield.</p>
