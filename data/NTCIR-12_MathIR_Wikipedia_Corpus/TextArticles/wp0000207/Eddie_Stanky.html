<hr/>

<p><strong>Edward Raymond Stanky</strong> (September 3, 1915 – June 6, 1999<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), nicknamed "The Brat", was an <a href="Americans" title="wikilink">American</a> professional <a class="uri" href="baseball" title="wikilink">baseball</a> player and <a href="manager_(baseball)" title="wikilink">manager</a>. He played in <a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="wikilink">Major League Baseball</a> as a <a href="second_baseman" title="wikilink">second baseman</a> for the <a href="Chicago_Cubs" title="wikilink">Chicago Cubs</a> (1943–44), <a href="Los_Angeles_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> (1944–47), <a href="Atlanta_Braves" title="wikilink">Boston Braves</a> (1948–49), <a href="San_Francisco_Giants" title="wikilink">New York Giants</a> (1950–51) and <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> (1952–53). He was born in <a href="Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, and his original nickname, "The Brat from <a href="Kensington,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="wikilink">Kensington</a>," is in reference to the neighborhood where he grew up.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>It took Stanky eight years to reach the major leagues at age 27, after starting out at <a href="Greenville,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Greenville, Mississippi</a>, in the <a href="East_Dixie_League" title="wikilink">East Dixie League</a>, where he was a teammate of future <a href="St._Louis_Cardinals" title="wikilink">St. Louis Cardinals</a> star <a href="Harry_Brecheen" title="wikilink">Harry Brecheen</a>, whom Stanky would manage in St. Louis in 1952.</p>
<h2 id="all-he-can-do-is-win">"All he can do is win"</h2>

<p>Stanky was famous for his ability to draw <a href="base_on_balls" title="wikilink">walks</a>; he drew 100 or more walks in each of six different seasons, 140 or more in two of them. In 1946, he <a href="batting_average" title="wikilink">hit</a> just .273 but his 137 walks allowed him to lead the league in <a href="on-base_percentage" title="wikilink">OBP</a> with .436, edging out Stan Musial—who led in more than ten hitting categories. His best season was probably 1950 with the Giants, when he hit an even .300 and led the league in walks (144) and OBP (.460). On August 30, he tied a major league record when he walked in seven consecutive at-bats (in two games).</p>

<p><a href="Leo_Durocher" title="wikilink">Leo Durocher</a>, who managed him with the Dodgers and Giants, once summed up Stanky's talents: "He can't hit, can't run, can't field. He's no nice guy ... all the little SOB can do is win." Yankee shortstop <a href="Phil_Rizzuto" title="wikilink">Phil Rizzuto</a> still complained years later about a notorious play during Game 3 of the <a href="1951_World_Series" title="wikilink">1951 World Series</a> in which Stanky kicked the ball loose from Rizzuto's glove as he slid into second base, instrumental in the Giant win that put them ahead two games to one, although they lost the next three and the Series with it.</p>

<p>As a runner at third base with less than two out, he would station himself several feet back of the bag, in shallow left field. He would time the arc of any outfield fly and then take off running, step on third as the catch was being made and continue to run at full speed, making it almost impossible to throw him out at home, a tactic eventually outlawed as a result. He was also (in)famous for what came to be called "the Stanky maneuver", distracting opposing hitters by jumping up and down and waving his arms behind the pitcher from his second base position.</p>

<p>Stanky was also a master of the "delayed steal" in which the runner feigns disinterest after the pitch; but instead of walking back to first breaks for second as soon as the infielders return to their normal positions. As Cardinal player-manager, he would hold up games close to being called on account of darkness or curfew when that would benefit his team, by walking leisurely to the mound from second base or the dugout (when not playing) after every pitch to confer with his pitcher, eventually resulting in the one-trip-per-inning rule.</p>
<h2 id="contribution-to-breaking-the-color-barrier">Contribution to breaking the color barrier</h2>

<p>Stanky contributed to the breaking of the <a href="color_barrier" title="wikilink">color barrier</a> as a member of the <a href="Brooklyn_Dodgers" title="wikilink">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> in 1947. When <a href="Jackie_Robinson" title="wikilink">Jackie Robinson</a> joined the Dodgers, he was treated harshly and discriminated against. Stanky stayed silent at first, but finally yelled back at <a href="Ben_Chapman_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Ben Chapman</a>'s racist insults during a game. Not long afterward, the other Dodgers began to stand up for Robinson as well.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The incident is portrayed in the film <a href="42_(film)" title="wikilink">42</a>. Stanky is played by Jesse Luken.</p>

<p>It can be noted that Robinson, a natural second baseman, was shifted to first base in his rookie season as Stanky was already the Dodgers' second baseman and leadoff hitter. Before the 1948 season began, Stanky was traded to the <a href="Boston_Braves_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Boston Braves</a> so that Robinson could return to his natural position and also bat leadoff.</p>
<h2 id="manager-of-cardinals-and-white-sox">Manager of Cardinals and White Sox</h2>

<p>He appeared in three <a href="World_Series" title="wikilink">World Series</a> in the five years between 1947 and 1951 — with three different <a href="National_League" title="wikilink">National League</a> champions, the Dodgers, Braves and Giants, all of whom lost to their <a href="American_League" title="wikilink">American League</a> opponents. Following the <a href="1951_World_Series" title="wikilink">1951 World Series</a>, in which he played in all six games for the Giants but hit an anemic .136, he was traded to the Cardinals as player-manager.</p>

<p>In <a href="1952_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1952</a>, his Cardinals won seven more games than they had in <a href="1951_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1951</a> and he was chosen <a href="The_Sporting_News_Manager_of_the_Year_Award" title="wikilink">Major League Manager of the Year</a> by <a href="The_Sporting_News" title="wikilink">The Sporting News</a> even though the Redbirds didn't move up in the standings, finishing in third place both years. But his time as Cardinal manager coincided with the slow decline of the team and its <a href="farm_system" title="wikilink">farm system</a> from its glory days in the 1940s and the ownership transition from <a href="Fred_Saigh" title="wikilink">Fred Saigh</a> to <a href='August_"Gussie"_Busch' title="wikilink">August "Gussie" Busch</a>, and on May 27, <a href="1955_St._Louis_Cardinals_season" title="wikilink">1955</a>, after a 17–19 start, he was fired.</p>

<p>Stanky then managed the <a href="Triple-A_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Triple-A</a> <a href="Minneapolis_Millers" title="wikilink">Minneapolis Millers</a> (1956) before returning to the Majors as a <a href="coach_(baseball)" title="wikilink">coach</a> for the <a href="Cleveland_Indians" title="wikilink">Cleveland Indians</a> (1957–58). He then spent almost six seasons in the Cardinal front office in charge of player development (1959–64), moving on to the <a href="New_York_Mets" title="wikilink">New York Mets</a> in a similar capacity in 1965.</p>

<p>In , he succeeded <a href="Al_Lopez" title="wikilink">Al Lopez</a> as the <a href="Chicago_White_Sox" title="wikilink">Chicago White Sox</a>' manager. The White Sox had been runners-up in the American League for three successive seasons (1963–65), averaging almost 96 victories per year, but Stanky's <a href="1966_Chicago_White_Sox_season" title="wikilink">maiden squad</a> won only 83 games and fell to fourth place. However, his <a href="1967_Chicago_White_Sox_season" title="wikilink">1967</a> White Sox team — built on speed and pitching but hampered by an impotent offense — contended for the pennant until the last week of the season in a thrilling four-team race. But they lost their last five games to the lowly <a href="Oakland_Athletics" title="wikilink">Kansas City Athletics</a> and <a href="Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Washington Senators</a>, and finished three games behind the surprise pennant winners, the "Impossible Dream" <a href="Boston_Red_Sox" title="wikilink">Boston Red Sox</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="1968_Chicago_White_Sox_season" title="wikilink">1968</a>, the White Sox got off to a terrible start, losing their first ten games (extending their regular-season losing streak to 15 games dating from 1967). They recovered slightly but were only 34–45 on July 11, when Stanky was fired and Lopez came out of retirement to reclaim his old job.</p>
<h2 id="success-as-college-baseball-coach">Success as college baseball coach</h2>

<p>After his firing in Chicago, Stanky became the head baseball coach of the <a href="University_of_South_Alabama" title="wikilink">University of South Alabama</a> in 1969, compiling a 490–195-2 (.714) record with five <a href="NCAA_Division_I_Baseball_Championship" title="wikilink">NCAA Baseball Tournament</a> appearances over 14 seasons. He returned to the professional arena briefly in  as manager of the <a href="Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" title="wikilink">Texas Rangers</a>, succeeding <a href="Frank_Lucchesi" title="wikilink">Frank Lucchesi</a> in midseason. He won his first game on June 22, but had second thoughts about leaving his adopted state of <a class="uri" href="Alabama" title="wikilink">Alabama</a> and resigned after a mere 18 hours on the job (one of the shortest managerial stints in MLB history) and went back to college coaching at South Alabama. According to Leo Durocher's autobiography, Stanky quit because he couldn't adapt to the attitudes of modern baseball players. His career MLB managerial mark was 467–435 (.518).</p>

<p>Stanky was inducted into the <a href="Mobile_Sports_Hall_of_Fame" title="wikilink">Mobile Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1990. He died in 1999 at age 82 in <a href="Fairhope,_Alabama" title="wikilink">Fairhope, Alabama</a>, leaving four children: Beverly, Kay, Mariann and Mike. He was buried in the <a href="Catholic_Cemetery_(Mobile,_Alabama)" title="wikilink">Catholic Cemetery of Mobile</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> alongside his father-in-law, <a href="Milt_Stock" title="wikilink">Milt Stock</a>, a Major League infielder and coach in the first half of the twentieth century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
