<h1>The Farmer's Bride</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>The Farmer's Bride</em></strong> is a collection of <a class="uri" href="poetry" title="wikilink">poetry</a> by <a href="Charlotte_Mew" title="wikilink">Charlotte Mew</a>.</p>

<p>Mew's first collection of poems was published in 1916, in <a class="uri" href="chapbook" title="wikilink">chapbook</a> format, by the <a href="Poetry_Bookshop" title="wikilink">Poetry Bookshop</a>. In the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">USA</a>, it was entitled <em>Saturday Market</em> and was not published until 1921. The title poem is a poignant lament by an inarticulate farmer about his love for his young wife and her inability to respond to him either physically or emotionally.</p>

<p>Mew wrote this poem during the 19th century and although marriages were not incredibly strict, they were often organized by families according to conveniences and value in society as opposed to being based on 'love'. She was affected by a mental illness, which had some effects on her writing and family life.</p>

<p>At harvest-time than bide and woo.<br/>
When us was wed she turned afraid<br/>
Of love and me and all things human;<br/>
Like the shut of a winter's day<br/>
Her smile went out, and 'twasn't a woman-<br/>
More like a little frightened fay.<br/>
One night, in the Fall, she runned away.</p>

<p>'Out 'mong the sheep, her be,' they said,<br/>
Should properly have been abed;<br/>
But sure enough she wasn't there<br/>
Lying awake with her wide brown stare.<br/>
So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down<br/>
We chased her, flying like a hare<br/>
Before our lanterns. To Church-Town<br/>
All in a shiver and a scare<br/>
We caught her, fetched her home at last<br/>
And turned the key upon her, fast.</p>

<p>She does the work about the house<br/>
As well as most, but like the mouse:<br/>
Happy enough to chat and play<br/>
With birds and rabbits as such as they,<br/>
So long as men-folk keep away.<br/>
'Not near, not near!' her eyes beseech<br/>
When one of us comes within reach.<br/>
The women say that beasts in stall<br/>
Look round like children at her call<br/>
I've hardly heard her speak at all</p>

<p>Shy as a leveret, swift as he,<br/>
Straight and slight as a young larch tree,<br/>
Sweet as the first wild violets, she,<br/>
To her wild self. But what to me?</p>

<p>The short days shorten and the oaks are brown,<br/>
The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky,<br/>
One leaf in the still air falls slowly down,<br/>
A magpie's spotted feathers lie<br/>
On the black earth spread white with rime,<br/>
The berries redden up to Christmas-time.<br/>
What's Christmas-time without there be<br/>
Some other in the house than we!</p>

<p>She sleeps up in the attic there<br/>
Alone, poor maid. 'Tis but a stair<br/>
Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down,<br/>
The soft young down of her; the brown,<br/>
The brown of her - her eyes, her hair, her hair!<br/>
