He was born at <a class="uri" href="Greenock" title="wikilink">Greenock</a> and worked as a clerk in <a class="uri" href="Glasgow" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a>, but about 1820 adopted literature as his profession.</p>

<p>Ritchie wrote four novels, of which the most successful was <em><a href="Wearyfoot_Common" title="wikilink">Wearyfoot Common</a></em>. The others were <em>Schinderhannes</em>, <em>The Robber of the Rhine</em> and <em>The Magician</em>. In his later years he edited <em><a href="Chambers'_Journal" title="wikilink">Chambers' Journal</a></em>. He also wrote short stories, including one of the first British werewolf short stories <em>The Man-Wolf</em> (1831).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ritchie also wrote non-fiction works, such as travel books.</p>

<p>Ritchie was at first an apprentice in a banking office, but at an early age went to London with letters of introduction to literary people. Called back by his father, to take up a position in a Glasgow trading firm, he started in 1818, with some friends, a fortnightly publication, <em>The Wanderers</em>, which ran to 21 numbers (4 April 1818 to 9 January 1819). The Glasgow firm became bankrupt, and Ritchie again went to London.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Working as a professional writer, Ritchie sent articles to the <em>Foreign Quarterly Review</em>, the <em><a href="Westminster_Review" title="wikilink">Westminster Review</a></em>, and other periodicals. The <em>London Weekly Review</em>, on which he had been employed, passed into other hands, he and the former editor, <a href="James_Augustus_St._John" title="wikilink">James Augustus St. John</a>, went to live in <a class="uri" href="Normandy" title="wikilink">Normandy</a>. Books made his reputation, and from this period he had enough work. In addition to his other engagements, he with <a href="William_Kennedy_(poet)" title="wikilink">William Kennedy</a>, started a monthly periodical, <em>The Englishman's Magazine</em>, which ran to seven numbers (April to October 1831), when his own illness caused its abandonment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>For some time Ritchie was editor of <em><a href="The_Era_(newspaper)" title="wikilink">The Era</a></em>, a sporting and dramatic newspaper, and was subsequently first editor of the <em>Indian News and Chronicle of Eastern Affairs</em> (No. 1, 11 June 1840), the copyright of which he was eventually given by the proprietor; and he later sold the newspaper. The latter part of his working life was spent in Scotland in editing <em>Chambers's Journal</em>, and other publications by his employers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> During this period he lived on St Bernards Crescent in <a href="Stockbridge,_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Stockbridge, Edinburgh</a> where he befriended his neighbour, <a href="Andrew_Crichton" title="wikilink">Andrew Crichton</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>On 19 June 1862 Ritchie was granted a <a href="civil_list_pension" title="wikilink">civil list pension</a>. Retiring to London, he died at 1 Earlswood Terrace, <a href="East_Greenwich" title="wikilink">East Greenwich</a>, on 16 January 1865. He left a daughter, Mrs. Hughes, who resided at <a href="Perry_Green,_Hertfordshire" title="wikilink">Perry Green, Hertfordshire</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

He published also <em>Tales and Confessions</em>, 1829, and <em>London Night Entertainments</em>. Based in France, Ritchie produced <em>The Game of Speculation</em>, 1830, 2 vols.
