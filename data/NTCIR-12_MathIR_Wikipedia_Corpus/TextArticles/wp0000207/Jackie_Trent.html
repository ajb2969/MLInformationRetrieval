<p><strong>Jackie Trent</strong> (born <strong>Yvonne Burgess</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> 6 September 1940 – 21 March 2015) was an English <a class="uri" href="singer-songwriter" title="wikilink">singer-songwriter</a>, and actress.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="early-years">Early years</h3>

<p>Trent was born in <a class="uri" href="Newcastle-under-Lyme" title="wikilink">Newcastle-under-Lyme</a>, the daughter of a coal-miner. At the age of nine she won first prize in a national poetry competition. Her first stage appearance was as a ten-year-old ingenue in the pantomime <em><a href="Babes_in_the_Wood" title="wikilink">Babes in the Wood</a></em>, but her primary interest was a career in pop music, inspired by her parent's love of music. At the age of 11 she won the "Carrol Levis and His Discoveries" talent show. She sang to packed audiences in local <a href="British_Legion" title="wikilink">British Legion</a> and <a href="working_men's_club" title="wikilink">working men's clubs</a> and with all the local <a href="big_band" title="wikilink">big bands</a> and became known as "the Vera Lynn of the Potteries".</p>

<p>Her first single, "Pick Up the Pieces", was released in 1962 on the <a href="Oriole_Records_(UK)" title="wikilink">Oriole</a> label, but it was not until <a href="Pye_Records" title="wikilink">Pye Records</a> and three years later that she scored her first hit with "<a href="Where_Are_You_Now_(My_Love)" title="wikilink">Where Are You Now</a>", featured in the popular TV series <em>It's Dark Outside</em>, which was written by <a href="Tony_Hatch" title="wikilink">Tony Hatch</a> and Trent, who at that time were involved in a successful professional collaboration with <a href="Petula_Clark" title="wikilink">Petula Clark</a>. "Where Are You Now" reached number one in the <a href="UK_Singles_Chart" title="wikilink">UK Singles Chart</a> in May 1965, topping the chart for one week. The song was written and recorded in just four days after Hatch was asked by <a href="Granada_TV" title="wikilink">Granada TV</a> to produce a song for the female lead in the programme to be seen on screen playing to herself. The lyrics were written by Trent in Christmas 1964, just before she embarked on a three-month tour of <a href="South_Africa" title="wikilink">South Africa</a>. When the song first hit the screen, people contacted <em><a href="TV_Times" title="wikilink">TV Times</a></em> to ask where they could get it and a sales rush began. The song went to number one in May 1965, replacing the Beatles' "<a href="Ticket_to_Ride" title="wikilink">Ticket to Ride</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Clark's 1966 hit, "<a href="I_Couldn't_Live_Without_Your_Love" title="wikilink">I Couldn't Live Without Your Love</a>" was inspired by the ongoing affair between Trent and Hatch, and they subsequently went public with their relationship.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> A year later, they were married.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Their duet "The Two Of Us" topped the Australian charts and created a demand for concert and cabaret performances earning the duo the nickname of "Mr &amp; Mrs Music".</p>

<p>Although she recorded several singles and albums, both as a solo artist and with her husband, Trent was more successful as a songwriter than a singer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In addition to their compositions for Clark, over the years she and Hatch wrote extensively for other artists, including <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="wikilink">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Jack_Jones_(singer)" title="wikilink">Jack Jones</a>, <a href="Nancy_Wilson_(singer)" title="wikilink">Nancy Wilson</a>, <a href="Des_O'Connor" title="wikilink">Des O'Connor</a>, <a href="Val_Doonican" title="wikilink">Val Doonican</a>, <a href="Shirley_Bassey" title="wikilink">Shirley Bassey</a>, <a href="Vikki_Carr" title="wikilink">Vikki Carr</a>, and <a href="Dean_Martin" title="wikilink">Dean Martin</a>.</p>

<p>In 1968 the couple also wrote the song "<a href="Joanna_(Scott_Walker_song)" title="wikilink">Joanna</a>", a hit for <a href="Scott_Walker_(singer)" title="wikilink">Scott Walker</a>. In the late 1960s, Trent returned to the stage with a UK tour of the musical <em>Nell</em> with <a href="Hermione_Baddeley" title="wikilink">Hermione Baddeley</a>.</p>

<p>In 1970, Trent recorded the <a href="Les_Vandyke" title="wikilink">Les Vandyke</a>-composed "I'll Be Near You" and in March that year she appeared on the <a href="List_of_NME_covers" title="wikilink">cover</a> of the British music magazine <em><a class="uri" href="NME" title="wikilink">NME</a></em>. The 1970s saw Hatch and Trent diversify into the world of <a href="musical_theater" title="wikilink">musical theatre</a>. The first of their projects, <em><a href="The_Card_(musical)" title="wikilink">The Card</a></em>, based on <a href="Arnold_Bennett" title="wikilink">Arnold Bennett</a>'s novel, with book by <a href="Keith_Waterhouse" title="wikilink">Keith Waterhouse</a> and Willis Hall, ran in London's <a href="West_End_theatre" title="wikilink">West End</a> with <a href="Jim_Dale" title="wikilink">Jim Dale</a> and <a href="Millicent_Martin" title="wikilink">Millicent Martin</a> in the starring roles. (Coincidentally, Clark had starred in the 1952 film version with <a href="Alec_Guinness" title="wikilink">Alec Guinness</a>). An original cast album was released in 1975. A rewritten version of the show, starring <a href="Peter_Duncan_(actor)" title="wikilink">Peter Duncan</a> and <a href="Hayley_Mills" title="wikilink">Hayley Mills</a>, played the <a href="Regent's_Park_Open_Air_Theatre" title="wikilink">Regent's Park Open Air Theatre</a> in the 1990s and spawned a new cast album.</p>

Initiated and produced by <a href="Cameron_Mackintosh" title="wikilink">Cameron Mackintosh</a>, it first played in <a href="Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="wikilink">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>.

A full-length concert version was also recorded at the <a href="Cork_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Cork Opera House</a> for transmission by <a href="Raidió_Teilifís_Éireann" title="wikilink">RTÉ</a>.</p>

<p>In 1972 the couple wrote the song "We'll Be With You", a celebration of Trent's home town football club <a href="Stoke_City" title="wikilink">Stoke City</a> reaching the final of the <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="wikilink">Football League Cup</a>. Released under the name 'The Potters' (the club's nickname), the song was recorded using Pye Records' outside broadcast unit and featured the team and supporters. Some 40 years on it is still played at all Stoke City home games and reached number 34 on the UK chart.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Stoke beat <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="wikilink">Chelsea F.C.</a> 2–1 in the final.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="theme-to-neighbours">Theme to <em>Neighbours</em></h3>

<p>After Trent and Hatch relocated to Australia in the 1980s, they were asked to write the theme song for the television soap-opera <em><a class="uri" href="Neighbours" title="wikilink">Neighbours</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The soap opera was going to be called <em>Ramsay Street</em>, before the couple penned the song. Trent told Jessie Stoelwinder from <em><a href="The_West_Australian" title="wikilink">The West Australian</a></em>, "We wrote the song as <em>Neighbours</em> because we said Ramsay Street was too close to <em><a href="Coronation_Street" title="wikilink">Coronation Street</a></em>, which was the major soap in Britain."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The theme was written and recorded in a day and Trent said "We called in <a href="Barry_Crocker" title="wikilink">Barry Crocker</a> at about 10pm to put his voice on it and it was on the producer's desk by 10am the following morning. And they loved it, so the series was then called <em>Neighbours</em>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In a recording career spanning 1962-1990, Trent issued a total of twelve albums, five compilations and 51 singles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 2015 Trent worked with two writers, Tim Wedgwood and Jonathan Fernyhough, on a stage show of her life.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
