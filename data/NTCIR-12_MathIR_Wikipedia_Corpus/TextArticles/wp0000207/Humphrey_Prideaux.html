<h1>Humphrey Prideaux</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Humphrey Prideaux</strong> (1648–1724) was an English churchman and orientalist, <a href="Dean_of_Norwich" title="wikilink">Dean of Norwich</a> from 1702. His sympathies inclined to Low Churchism in religion and to <a class="uri" href="Whiggism" title="wikilink">Whiggism</a> in politics.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>The third son of Edmond Prideaux, he was born at <a class="uri" href="Padstow" title="wikilink">Padstow</a>, <a class="uri" href="Cornwall" title="wikilink">Cornwall</a>, on 3 May 1648. His mother was a daughter of <a href="John_Moyle" title="wikilink">John Moyle</a>. After education at <a href="Liskeard_grammar_school" title="wikilink">Liskeard grammar school</a> and <a href="Bodmin_grammar_school" title="wikilink">Bodmin grammar school</a>, he went to <a href="Westminster_School" title="wikilink">Westminster School</a> under <a href="Richard_Busby" title="wikilink">Richard Busby</a>, recommended by his uncle <a href="William_Morice_(Secretary_of_State)" title="wikilink">William Morice</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On 11 December 1668 he matriculated at <a href="Christ_Church,_Oxford" title="wikilink">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, where he had obtained a studentship. He graduated B.A. 22 June 1672, M.A. 29 April 1675, B.D. 15 November 1682, D.D. 8 June 1686. In January 1674, Prideaux recorded in his letters a visit to his home of <a href="William_Levett_(dean)" title="wikilink">William Levett</a>; with Levett came <a href="Henry_Hyde,_2nd_Earl_of_Clarendon" title="wikilink">Lord Cornbury</a>, son of the <a href="Edward_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon" title="wikilink">Earl of Clarendon</a>, Levett's principal patron. In other letters, Prideaux mentioned alliances with Levett in ongoing church political maneuverings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> At the university he was known for scholarship; <a href="John_Fell_(clergyman)" title="wikilink">John Fell</a> employed him in 1672 on an edition of <em><a class="uri" href="Florus" title="wikilink">Florus</a></em>. He also worked on <a href="Edmund_Chilmead" title="wikilink">Edmund Chilmead</a>'s edition of the chronicle of <a href="John_Malalas" title="wikilink">John Malalas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Prideaux gained the patronage of <a href="Heneage_Finch,_1st_Earl_of_Nottingham" title="wikilink">Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham</a>, as tutor to his son Charles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and in 1677 he obtained the sinecure rectory of <a class="uri" href="Llandewy-Velfrey" title="wikilink">Llandewy-Velfrey</a>, <a class="uri" href="Pembrokeshire" title="wikilink">Pembrokeshire</a>. In 1679 Finch presented him to the rectory of <a href="St_Clement's,_Oxford" title="wikilink">St Clement's, Oxford</a>, which he held till 1696. He was appointed also, in 1679, Busby's Hebrew lecturer in Christ Church College. Finch gave him in 1681 a canonry at <a class="uri" href="Norwich" title="wikilink">Norwich</a>, and <a href="Sir_Francis_North" title="wikilink">Sir Francis North</a> in February 1683 presented him to the rectory of <a class="uri" href="Bladon" title="wikilink">Bladon</a>, <a class="uri" href="Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Oxfordshire</a>, which included the chapelry of <a href="Woodstock,_Oxfordshire" title="wikilink">Woodstock</a>. He retained his studentship at Christ Church, where he was acting as unsalaried librarian.</p>

<p>Prideaux married and left Oxford for Norwich, ahead of James II's appointment (October 1686) of <a href="John_Massey_(Dean_of_Christ_Church)" title="wikilink">John Massey</a>, a Roman Catholic, as Dean of Christ Church. He exchanged (1686) Bladon for the rectory of <a class="uri" href="Saham-Toney" title="wikilink">Saham-Toney</a>, Norfolk, which he held till 1694. He engaged in controversy with Roman Catholics, especially on the point of the validity of <a href="Anglican_orders" title="wikilink">Anglican orders</a>. As canon of Norwich he improved the financial arrangements of the chapter, and put the records in order. In December 1688 he was made <a href="archdeacon_of_Suffolk" title="wikilink">archdeacon of Suffolk</a> by his bishop <a href="William_Lloyd_(bishop)" title="wikilink">William Lloyd</a>, an office which he held till 1694. While Lloyd became a <a href="nonjuring_schism" title="wikilink">nonjuror</a>, Prideaux exerted himself at his archidiaconal visitation (May 1689) to secure the taking of the oaths; out of three hundred parishes in his archdeaconry only three clergymen became nonjurors. At the <a class="uri" href="Convocation" title="wikilink">Convocation</a> which opened on 21 November 1689 Prideaux was an advocate for changes in the <em><a href="Book_of_Common_Prayer" title="wikilink">Book of Common Prayer</a></em>, with a view to the comprehension of <a class="uri" href="Dissenters" title="wikilink">Dissenters</a>. Subsequently he officially corrected a lax interpretation of the <a href="Toleration_Act_1688" title="wikilink">Toleration Act 1688</a>, as though it exempted from the duty of attendance on public worship. <a href="Gilbert_Burnet" title="wikilink">Gilbert Burnet</a> consulted him in 1691 about a measure for prevention of <a class="uri" href="pluralities" title="wikilink">pluralities</a>, and Prideaux drafted a bill for this purpose. <a href="Richard_Kidder" title="wikilink">Richard Kidder</a> consulted him in the same year about a bill for preventing <a href="clandestine_marriage" title="wikilink">clandestine marriages</a>.</p>

<p>From 1689 to 1694 Prideaux resided at Saham. He declined in 1691 the Oxford Hebrew chair vacated by the death of <a href="Edward_Pococke" title="wikilink">Edward Pococke</a>, a step which he afterwards regretted. Saham did not suit his health, and he returned to Norwich. In a letter written on 28 November 1694 after receiving the news of <a href="John_Tillotson" title="wikilink">John Tillotson</a>'s death, he said that he had no expectations of future advancement. Early in 1697 he was presented to the vicarage of <a class="uri" href="Trowse" title="wikilink">Trowse</a>, near Norwich, a chapter living, which he held till 1709. He succeeded <a href="Henry_Fairfax_(dean)" title="wikilink">Henry Fairfax</a> as dean of Norwich, and was installed on 8 June 1702. On the translation to Ely (31 July 1707) of <a href="John_Moore_(bishop_of_Ely)" title="wikilink">John Moore</a>, Prideaux recommended the appointment of <a href="Charles_Trimnell" title="wikilink">Charles Trimnell</a>, his fellow canon, as bishop.</p>

<p>In 1721 Prideaux gave his collection of oriental books to <a href="Clare_College,_Cambridge" title="wikilink">Clare Hall, Cambridge</a>. From about 1709 he had suffered severely from <a href="Bladder_stone" title="wikilink">the stone</a>, which prevented him from preaching. An operation was badly managed; attacks of rheumatism and paralysis reduced his strength. He died on 1 November 1724, at the deanery, Norwich, and was buried in the nave of the <a href="Norwich_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Norwich Cathedral</a>, where there was a stone to his memory, with an epitaph composed by himself.</p>
