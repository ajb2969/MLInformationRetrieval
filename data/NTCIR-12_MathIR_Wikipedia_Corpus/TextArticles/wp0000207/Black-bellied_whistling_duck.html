<h1>Black-bellied whistling duck</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>black-bellied whistling duck</strong> (<em>Dendrocygna autumnalis</em>), formerly also called <strong>black-bellied tree duck</strong>, is a <a href="whistling_duck" title="wikilink">whistling duck</a> that breeds from the southernmost United States and tropical <a href="Central_America" title="wikilink">Central</a> to south-central <a href="South_America" title="wikilink">South America</a>. In the USA, it can be found year-round in parts of southeast <a class="uri" href="Texas" title="wikilink">Texas</a>, and seasonally in southeast <a class="uri" href="Arizona" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Louisiana" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>'s Gulf Coast. It is a rare breeder in such disparate locations as <a class="uri" href="Florida" title="wikilink">Florida</a>, <a class="uri" href="Arkansas" title="wikilink">Arkansas</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, and <a href="South_Carolina" title="wikilink">South Carolina</a>. There is a large population of several hundred that winter each year in Audubon Park in uptown <a href="New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>. Since it is one of only two whistling-duck species native to <a href="North_America" title="wikilink">North America</a>, it is occasionally just known as the "whistling duck" in the southern USA.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p> The black-bellied whistling duck is a mid-sized waterfowl species. Length ranges from , body mass from  and wingspan ranges from .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It has a long red bill, long head and longish legs, pale grey head and mostly grey-brown <a class="uri" href="plumage" title="wikilink">plumage</a>. The belly and tail are black, and the body plumage, back of the neck and cap are a rich chestnut brown. The face and upper neck are grey, and they sport a thin but distinct white eye-ring. The extensive white in the wings is obvious in flight, less so on the ground; it is formed by the secondary <a class="uri" href="remiges" title="wikilink">remiges</a> while the primaries are black; the wing-coverts are brown. Males and females look alike; juveniles are similar but have a grey bill and less contrasting belly.</p>

<p>The wing bar is unique among living whistling ducks. When on the ground, it may be hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these <a class="uri" href="waterfowl" title="wikilink">waterfowl</a>. The <a href="fulvous_whistling_duck" title="wikilink">fulvous whistling duck</a> (<em>D. bicolor</em>) is the only <a class="uri" href="sympatric" title="wikilink">sympatric</a> whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly rather than the other way around. Juvenile <em>D. autumnalis</em> are quite similar to young of the <a href="white-faced_whistling_duck" title="wikilink">white-faced whistling duck</a> (<em>D. viduata</em>), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white <a href="Vertical_direction" title="wikilink">vertical</a> barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.</p>

<p>As the name implies, these are noisy birds with a clear whistling <em>waa-chooo</em> call.</p>

<h2 id="ecology">Ecology</h2>

<p>  The black-bellied whistling duck is a common species that is "quite tame, even in the wild".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It is highly gregarious, forming large flocks when not breeding, and is largely resident apart from local movements. It usually nests in hollow trees. The habitat is quiet shallow freshwater <a href="pond" title="wikilink">ponds</a>, <a href="lake" title="wikilink">lakes</a>, and <a href="marsh" title="wikilink">marshes</a>, cultivated land or reservoirs with plentiful vegetation, where this <a class="uri" href="duck" title="wikilink">duck</a> feeds mainly at night on seeds and other plant food.</p>
<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

<p>Feeding often occurs <a href="nocturnal" title="wikilink">nocturnally</a>, but they can be encountered eating at any hour of the day. Black-bellied whistling ducks ingest a wide variety of plant material, but also consume <a href="arthropod" title="wikilink">arthropods</a> and aquatic <a href="invertebrate" title="wikilink">invertebrates</a> when available. They often feed on submerged vegetation by wading through shallow water. As its Latin name (<em>autumnalis</em>) implies, it is commonly seen gleaning recently harvested fields for leftover seeds and invertebrates brought up by the harvesters disturbing the soil.</p>
<h3 id="movements">Movements</h3>

<p>The black-bellied whistling duck is mainly <a class="uri" href="non-migratory" title="wikilink">non-migratory</a>. Birds in the extreme northern portions of their range (<a class="uri" href="Arizona" title="wikilink">Arizona</a>, <a class="uri" href="Louisiana" title="wikilink">Louisiana</a>, and parts of <a class="uri" href="Texas" title="wikilink">Texas</a>) move south in winter. At the heart of their range, there is a tendency to travel in flocks over the winter months, though this behavior is not a true long-range migration but rather local dispersal. 7 adults and 8 ducklings were observed on west side of Lake Apopka, Central Florida, 7-24-15. They have been in this area for more than a year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h3>

<p>The black-bellied whistling duck is quite unique among ducks in their strong <a class="uri" href="monogamous" title="wikilink">monogamous</a> pair-bond. Its pairs often stay together for many years, a trait more often associated with <a class="uri" href="geese" title="wikilink">geese</a> and <a href="swan" title="wikilink">swans</a>. Both parents share all tasks associated with the raising of young, from <a href="Avian_incubation" title="wikilink">incubation</a> to the rearing of ducklings. The ducks, primarily cavity nesters, prefer the confines of a hollow tree, but will nest on the ground when necessary. They also make use of chimneys, abandoned buildings, or <a href="nest_box" title="wikilink">nest boxes</a>, the latter having been increasingly provided to them over recent decades, especially in southeast Texas and Mexico. Ducklings leap from nest cavities within two days of hatching, can feed themselves immediately, and stay with the parents for up to eight weeks.</p>
<h2 id="status-and-conservation">Status and conservation</h2>

<p>This species is not considered to be of conservation concern by the <a class="uri" href="IUCN" title="wikilink">IUCN</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and the <a href="National_Audubon_Society" title="wikilink">National Audubon Society</a>; its global population is estimated at 1,100,000-2,000,000 birds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
