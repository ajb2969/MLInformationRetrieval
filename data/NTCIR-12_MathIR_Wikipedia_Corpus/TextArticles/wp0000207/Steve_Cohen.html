<p>Cohen was born in <a href="Memphis,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Memphis, Tennessee</a> on May 24, 1949, the son of Genevieve (née Goldsand) and pediatrician Morris David Cohen. He has two older brothers, Michael Corey and Martin D.

<p>Cohen graduated from <a href="Vanderbilt_University" title="wikilink">Vanderbilt University</a> in 1971 with a <a href="Bachelor_of_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree.

<h2 id="early-political-career">Early political career</h2>

<p>While serving for three years as Legal Advisor for the Memphis Police Department, Cohen rose to political prominence when he was elected to the Tennessee <a href="constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)" title="wikilink">Constitutional Convention</a> of 1977 at the age of 27. The Convention elected him its vice president.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Cohen was then elected to serve as a commissioner on the <a href="Shelby_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Shelby County</a> Commission, an office he held from 1978 to 1980.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> During his time at the Commission, Cohen was instrumental in the creation of The Med, a community-funded regional hospital.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In 1980, Cohen served as an interim <a href="Shelby_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Shelby County</a> General Sessions Court judge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He has also served as a delegate to the 1980, 1992, 2004, and 2008 <a href="Democratic_National_Convention" title="wikilink">Democratic National Conventions</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="tennessee-senate">Tennessee Senate</h2>

<p>Cohen was elected to the <a href="Tennessee_Senate" title="wikilink">Tennessee Senate</a> in 1982, representing District 30, which includes parts of Memphis. He held that position for 24 years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>For 18 years, Cohen strove to repeal the ban on lotteries in the <a href="Tennessee_State_Constitution" title="wikilink">Tennessee State Constitution</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> His efforts were successful in 2002, and a <a href="Tennessee_Lottery" title="wikilink">state lottery program</a> designed to provide college scholarships for Tennessee students was adopted the following year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The lottery program is regarded as the most well-known accomplishment of Cohen's Senate career, having raised over $2 billion for scholarships, afterschool programs, pre-K, technical center grants, and energy saving capital programs in K-12 schools as of 2012.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Cohen also sponsored legislation relating to expansion of community access to healthcare, the protection of animal rights, the reinstatement of voting rights, graduated driver licenses, and funding for the arts during his career.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> He sponsored the T-Bo law, the nation's first-ever statute providing for damages up to $5000 in cases of intentional or negligent acts resulting in the death of a companion dog or cat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> He has won four awards from the Humane Society as of 2012.</p>

<p>He sponsored and passed legislation providing funding for the construction of the Autozone Park baseball stadium, creating the Holocaust Commission, and providing permanent funding for the arts with Tennesseans for the Arts license plates. He was awarded the Bill of Rights Award from the <a href="American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="wikilink">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and the Bird Dog Award for Ethics from Tennessee Common Cause in 1992.</p>

<p>In March 2005, Cohen was one of three Tennessee Senators to vote against the <a href="Tennessee_Marriage_Protection_Amendment" title="wikilink">Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment</a>, which Tennessee voters approved via a referendum in November 2006.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> During the course of the debate on the amendment, Cohen offered several amendments to the amendment, all of which failed, including the proposed addition of an "<a class="uri" href="adultery" title="wikilink">adultery</a> clause," which said "Adultery is deemed to be a threat to the institution of marriage and contrary to public policy in Tennessee."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Cohen won the Political Leadership Award from the <a href="Human_Rights_Campaign" title="wikilink">Human Rights Campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Cohen was widely regarded as one of the Senate's toughest and most articulate debaters, as he has an unusually straightforward and direct style when compared to other Southern politicians. One Tennessee writer described him as "very outspoken, very persistent, and a lot more cerebral than most of his colleagues."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>When elected in 1982, Cohen was the first <a class="uri" href="Jewish" title="wikilink">Jewish</a> member to serve in the <a href="Tennessee_Senate" title="wikilink">Tennessee Senate</a> since 1958.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1996, Cohen ran for election to the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">United States House of Representatives</a> seat for the 9th District, which came open when 22-year incumbent and fellow Democrat <a href="Harold_Ford,_Sr." title="wikilink">Harold Ford, Sr.</a> announced his retirement. The then 26-year-old <a href="Harold_Ford,_Jr." title="wikilink">Harold Ford, Jr.</a>, the incumbent's son, was his opponent in the Democratic primary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Reflecting on the race, Cohen said, "I'd spent fourteen years in the [state] Senate, had the experience, and didn't like the idea of [the seat] being handed down like an heirloom."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p>Cohen lost the primary to Ford by 25 points.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Noting that Ford, an African-American, did much better than Cohen in majority black precincts despite Ford's inexperience, Cohen said, "It is impossible for a person who is not African American to get a large vote in the African American community... against a substantial candidate. The fact is, I am white, and it doesn't seem to matter what you do."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> Later, Cohen admitted that his statement was "impolitic" but also noted that "race is still an important factor in voting."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>Cohen was able to return to the State Senate after the election. Tennessee state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Cohen did not have to run for reelection to the Senate until 1998.</p>

<p>In early April 2006, Cohen announced that he was again running for the 9th District seat; Ford, Jr. was not running for reelection. Cohen was the first candidate in the race with significant name recognition outside the Memphis area but had fourteen opponents in the primary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> <em><a href="The_Commercial_Appeal" title="wikilink">The Commercial Appeal</a></em>, Memphis' daily <a class="uri" href="newspaper" title="wikilink">newspaper</a>, endorsed Cohen in the race.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> The crowded nature of the primary was largely due to the district's demographics. The 9th is a heavily Democratic, black-majority district, and it was considered very likely that whoever won the Democratic primary would be the district's next congressman.</p>

<p>Cohen won the August 3 primary by a decisive 4,000-vote margin despite being outspent 2 to 1 by the runner-up in the primary. In fact, six Democrats raised more money than he did.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> He carried many of the district's predominantly black precincts by healthy margins. He faced <a href="United_States_Republican_Party" title="wikilink">Republican</a> <a href="Mark_White_(Tennessee_politician)" title="wikilink">Mark White</a> and independent Jake Ford (the younger brother of Harold Ford, Jr.) in the general election in November.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Though the Ninth District is heavily Democratic, Jake Ford was seen as a serious contender for the race because of his significant name recognition among Memphis' black voters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Jake Ford had skipped the Democratic primary because he felt it was too crowded, but stated he would caucus with the Democrats if elected. The Ford family has been a significant force in Memphis' black community since the days of <a href="E.H._Crump" title="wikilink">E.H. Crump</a>. Indeed, it seemed that the real race was between Cohen and Jake Ford. White was not a serious factor, and would have faced nearly impossible odds even in a two-way race with Cohen.</p>

<p>Cohen was endorsed by the mayor of Memphis, <a href="W._W._Herenton" title="wikilink">W. W. Herenton</a>, and the mayor of <a href="Shelby_County,_Tennessee" title="wikilink">Shelby County</a>, <a href="A.C._Wharton" title="wikilink">A.C. Wharton</a>, both of whom are black and members of the Democratic Party.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> He was also endorsed by many local Democratic activists who had long felt Harold Ford, Jr. was too moderate.</p>

<p>However, many of the city's politically influential black pastors refused to support Cohen, and the area Black Ministers Association overwhelmingly voted to endorse Jake Ford. The Ford family itself was split. While Harold Ford, Jr. himself remained neutral (despite rumors of collusion between the two brothers' campaigns), their cousin Joe Ford, Jr., an entertainment lawyer, strongly endorsed Cohen after finishing third in the primary. However, Harold Ford, Sr. strongly supported his younger son.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>On October 8, 2006, Cohen, Ford, and White participated in a televised debate in Memphis. Among other topics, issues discussed included Iraq, medical marijuana, education, and the Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> Ford attacked Cohen's record in the State Senate, including his opposition to the Marriage Protection Amendment, support for medical marijuana, and his voting attendance record.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> Cohen responded by standing by his public record, pointing out Ford's lack of experience in public office, and indicating that Ford had been to jail and had dropped out of high school.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Cohen won the election by a decisive margin, winning 60% of the vote to Ford's 22% and White's 18%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> Sixty percent of the votes received by Cohen were from African-American voters.</p>

<p>Despite Cohen's strong performance in the black community, many of the city's politically active blacks felt chagrined at being represented by him. Besides some sentiment that the 9th should be represented by a black Democrat, his socially liberal views (see below) also gave them pause. For example, Cohen's support for a hate-crimes bill drew particularly strong opposition from most of the city's black ministers because it included a sexual orientation provision. Cohen contends that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill, and Harold Ford, Jr. had voted for it in the previous Congress. Still, many of the city's black ministers tried to rally behind a consensus black candidate to challenge Cohen in the Democratic primary.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p>Cohen faced four challengers in the August 7, 2008 Democratic primary for the 9th District. His major opponent was <a href="Nikki_Tinker" title="wikilink">Nikki Tinker</a>, a lawyer who had finished second to Cohen in the 2006 primary and had formerly been an aide to Harold Ford, Jr.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> Tinker received the endorsement of the city's Black Ministerial Association.</p>

<p>At a June 2008 campaign event, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Cohen as "the conscience of the freshman class", adding “He is a progressive and an important member of the Transportation Committee, which provides the infrastructure for jobs that will make America more competitive in the global economy.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>The campaign quickly turned ugly, with Tinker putting together a raft of <a href="Negative_campaigning" title="wikilink">negative ads</a>. One attacked Cohen for voting against a proposal that would have removed a statue and the remains of <a href="Nathan_Bedford_Forrest" title="wikilink">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>, a Confederate lieutenant-general who was involved in the founding of the <a href="Ku_Klux_Klan" title="wikilink">Ku Klux Klan</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> from the Medical Center park. The ad falsely implied that Cohen had ties to the Klan by juxtaposing Cohen with a white-clad Klansman.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Another ad accused Cohen of "praying in our churches"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> while voting against school prayer during his tenure in the State Senate. Tinker's campaign later removed the ads from its <a class="uri" href="YouTube" title="wikilink">YouTube</a> account amid criticism from a number of sources.</p>

<p>On the day the Primary was held, <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> denounced Tinker's ads, saying they "have no place in our politics, and will do nothing to help the good people of Tennessee." Harold Ford, Jr. also denounced the ads.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>The primary had been marred by racial tensions for months prior to the August vote. In February 2008, Rev. George Brooks, a Tinker supporter, distributed literature in the district which stated that "Cohen and the Jews HATE Jesus" and urged the defeat of an "opponent of Christ and Christianity." Another minister, Rev. Robert Poindexter of Mt. Moriah Baptist Church, said that he was supporting Tinker because Cohen "(is) not black, and he can't represent me, that's just the bottom line." <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

<p>Ultimately, Cohen won the primary in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Tinker's 19 percent. In his victory speech, Cohen said his victory proved "Memphis has come a long, long way" from its racially divisive past.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> Cohen's primary win virtually assured him of a second term; no Republican even filed, and any Republican challenger would have faced nearly impossible odds in any case. He was reelected with 87.9 percent of the vote against three independent challengers, one of whom was Jake Ford (who won 4.8 percent of the vote).</p>

<p>Cohen endorsed <a href="Barack_Obama" title="wikilink">Barack Obama</a> in the <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2008" title="wikilink">2008 Democratic presidential primary</a> on February 4, 2008, the day before the <a href="Super_Tuesday,_2008" title="wikilink">Super Tuesday</a> primaries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> On September 10, 2008 while speaking on the floor of the House, Cohen compared Obama's work as a community organizer to <a class="uri" href="Jesus" title="wikilink">Jesus</a>' work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Former Memphis Mayor <a href="Willie_Herenton" title="wikilink">Willie Herenton</a> announced that he would challenge Cohen in the 2010 Democratic primary for the seat. In a guest column in the <a href="Memphis_Commercial_Appeal" title="wikilink">Memphis Commercial Appeal</a>, Herenton wrote that while he hoped the campaign would focus on issues rather than race or religion, that "it remains a fact that the 9th Congressional District provides the only real opportunity to elect a qualified African-American to the all-white 11-member delegation representing Tennessee in Washington." Herenton also denied having supported Cohen in his 2006 bid against Jake Ford, writing "I did not support Steve Cohen the individual for the 9th Congressional District. I supported an idea that was bigger than him as an individual. I supported the principle of fairness."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> During the 2006 campaign, Herenton endorsed Cohen, saying "Steve Cohen is the best-qualified candidate for this leadership role".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> While Cohen's commanding win in the 2008 primary suggested that he has won strong support among the district's African-American community, Herenton was easily his highest-profile opponent to date.</p>

<p>In September 2009, Herenton drew controversy when he stated in a radio interview that Cohen "really does not think very much of African-Americans" and that "[Cohen]’s played the black community well.” In addition, Herenton's campaign manager Sidney Chism told the New York Times that the Memphis-area congressional seat Cohen holds "was set aside for people who look like me. It wasn't set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation." The <a href="National_Jewish_Democratic_Council" title="wikilink">National Jewish Democratic Council</a> (NJDC) criticized Herenton for these remarks, stating that he comments were "unacceptable in a Democratic primary or anywhere in our political discourse."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>

<p>President Obama endorsed Congressman Cohen for re-election, saying “Congressman Cohen is a proven leader in the United States Congress and a strong voice for Tennessee. Together, we passed historic health care reform and together we’re continuing the fight to renew our economy and bring jobs back to the American people. I am proud to stand with Steve and support his re-election to Congress."</p>

<p>In the unofficial election results, Steve Cohen won 79% of the vote to Herenton's 21%. The vote marked the first time Herenton, 70, elected to a record five terms as mayor, lost a race for public office.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> This all but assured Cohen of a third term. In the general election, Cohen easily dispatched Republican challenger Charlotte Bergmann, taking 74 percent of the vote to Bergmann's 25 percent.</p>

<p>Cohen was challenged in the Democratic Primary by Tomeka Hart, a female African-American member of the Memphis School Board and Memphis Urban League President who was undefeated in elections up to that point. Cohen won the Democratic Primary with 89.2% of the vote on August 2, 2012<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a>—the highest vote total in the district in recent history and the highest percentage vote for a white candidate running for office in a majority African-American district in history.</p>

<p>President Obama endorsed Cohen on April 5, 2012, saying “Congressman Steve Cohen has worked with me on jobs bills, health care, and other issues of importance to the middle class. He also never fails to pitch me on the city of Memphis, whether it’s Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis basketball, or barbecue. I urge you to vote for Steve Cohen, a tireless advocate for the 9th District".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> In the general election, Cohen trounced Republican businessman <a href="George_Flinn" title="wikilink">George Flinn</a> with 75 percent of the vote.</p>
