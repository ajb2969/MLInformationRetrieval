<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The settlement of São Luís began in 1857 with a ranch belonging to the Neto family. This was near a stream flowing near the São Luíz hills, where there were fertile lands that lent themselves to the cultivation of sugar cane and the raising of cattle. The founder, José Neto Cerqueira Leão Sobrinho gave the name of São Luíz de Montes Belos in honor of Saint Louis and the beautiful hills nearby. In 1948 it was raised to the category of district belonging to <a href="Goiás,_Goiás" title="wikilink">Goiás</a>. In 1953 it became a municipality. The spelling of the name "Luís" is sometimes with "z" instead of "s" and is often without the accent on the letter "i". Official spelling used by Seplan is São Luis de Montes Belos. The first mayor was "Nenen de Brito", Deusdedit de Brito, his birth certificate name; respectful man who continually served the people of São Luis de Montes Belos as a representative for 28 years.</p>
