<p>The <strong>Merkur XR4Ti</strong> (eXperimental Racing, 4 series, Turbo, advanced Injection system)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was a short-lived United States and Canadian-market version of the European <a href="Ford_Sierra" title="wikilink">Ford Sierra XR4i</a>. It was the brainchild of then Ford vice president <a href="Bob_Lutz_(businessman)" title="wikilink">Bob Lutz</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It was sold in the US from 1985 to 1989. It was the first vehicle sold by <a class="uri" href="Merkur" title="wikilink">Merkur</a>, followed in 1988 by the <a href="Merkur_Scorpio" title="wikilink">Merkur Scorpio</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> The cars were hand assembled and built entirely by <a class="uri" href="Karmann" title="wikilink">Karmann</a> Coachworks in <a class="uri" href="Rheine" title="wikilink">Rheine</a>, Germany.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Unlike with the Scorpio, the XR4Ti did not carry over the Sierra badge from Europe, since at the time it was also being used by <a href="General_Motors" title="wikilink">General Motors</a> in North America for two completely different vehicles: the <a href="GMC_C/K" title="wikilink">GMC C/K Sierra</a> and the similar sounding <a href="Oldsmobile_Cutlass_Ciera" title="wikilink">Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera</a>. When first introduced, the XR4Ti had a starting price of US$16,503 which is equal to about $ today.</p>

<p>The XR4Ti was distinguished mechanically by its <a href="Turbocharger" title="wikilink">turbocharged</a> <a href="Ford_Pinto_engine#2.3_OHC" title="wikilink">Ford Lima</a> 2.3 L <a href="Straight-4" title="wikilink">four-cylinder</a> SOHC engine and independent rear suspension, and stylistically by its large wind tunnel derived bi-plane spoiler (replaced on the 1988-89 models with a single rear spoiler). It came with either the <a href="Ford_C3_transmission" title="wikilink">C3</a> three-speed <a href="automatic_transmission" title="wikilink">automatic transmission</a> or the Ford <a href="Type_9" title="wikilink">Type 9</a>, five-speed <a href="manual_transmission" title="wikilink">manual transmission</a>. Mechanically, it differed from the European <a href="Ford_Sierra#XR4i_and_other_sporting_models" title="wikilink">Ford Sierra XR4i</a>, which had a 2.8l Ford Cologne <a class="uri" href="V6" title="wikilink">V6</a>. Airbag legislation for the 1990 model years and weak sales as are frequently cited as the cause for the Merkur range to be discontinued.</p>

<p>The XR4Ti was on <em><a href="Car_and_Driver" title="wikilink">Car and Driver</a>'s</em> <a href="Car_and_Driver_Ten_Best" title="wikilink">Ten Best list</a> for 1985. In 2009 however, the magazine's staff apologized for including the XR4Ti in their 1985 "Ten Best" list, and effectively recanted the award.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="engines">Engines</h2>

<p>The XR4Ti came with one engine, the 2.3 liter turbocharged, in-line, fuel injected 'Lima' four cylinder using an EEC-IV computer. The four-cylinder engine was generally rated at  when mated with an automatic transmission ( boost), and  when matched with the five-speed manual transmission ( boost). This engine is the same as is found in the SVO Mustang and the Thunderbird Turbo coupe of the time, though the <a href="Ford_Mustang_SVO" title="wikilink">SVO Mustang</a> and 1987-88 <a href="Ford_Thunderbird_(ninth_generation)" title="wikilink">Thunderbird Turbo coupe</a> differed by having an intercooler and different <a href="Ford_EEC" title="wikilink">EEC-IV</a> programming.</p>
<h2 id="options">Options</h2>

<p>The XR4Ti extra cost options initially included three-speed automatic transmission, power windows, power door locks, cruise control, leather seats, heated seats, manual-crank moonroof (retractable, tinted glass with sunshade), and metallic paint. Typically ordered options like power windows, power door locks and cruise control eventually became standard.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p> In its short life, the XR4Ti saw some minor changes either by design or by implemented <a href="Technical_Service_Bulletin" title="wikilink">TSB</a>. Examples include: monochromatic paint (red, black and white), uprated heater cores, larger rear hatch glass (in conjunction with the single rear wing), improved steering rack, upgraded dash construction etc. Many of these parts were taken from the Sierra Mk.II body shell which was only sold in continental Europe with some being Merkur specific parts. Most of these changes occurred in the 1987 model year.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>The top speed of the manual transmission XR4Ti 1985-87 is . The bi-plane rear spoiler was changed to a single spoiler for the 1988-1989 cars; it actually increased the drag coefficient compared to the bi-plane spoiler of the earlier cars which have a coefficient of 0.32.</p>

<p><em><a href="Car_&amp;_Driver" title="wikilink">Car &amp; Driver</a></em> tests for the XR4Ti reported 0-60 mph times from 7.0 seconds and as high 7.9 seconds and 1/4 mile times at around 15.7 seconds. Later tests by <em>Car &amp; Driver</em> showed 7.8 seconds for the 0-60 mph times and they mentioned the press car might have been a ringer which was common at the time. In their test data, they stated the car came with a limited slip differental only available in either the American Merkur XR4Ti or its sister car the Europe-only XR4i.</p>
<h2 id="motorsport">Motorsport</h2>

<p> Despite the XR4Ti never being sold outside the United States and Canada, in 1985, <a href="Andy_Rouse" title="wikilink">Andy Rouse</a> used one to compete in the <a href="British_Touring_Car_Championship" title="wikilink">British Saloon Car Championship</a>. He took the overall title for <a href="1985_British_Saloon_Car_Championship_season" title="wikilink">that year</a> and the class title for <a href="1986_British_Saloon_Car_Championship_season" title="wikilink">the following year</a> with 14 race victories altogether.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In 1986 Eggenberger Motorsport was among the few to use an XR4Ti to compete in the <a href="European_Touring_Car_Championship" title="wikilink">ETCC</a> and the <a href="Deutsche_Tourenwagen_Meisterschaft" title="wikilink">DTM</a> (German Touring Car Championship) with positive results. Ford would use the car's technical feedback from the teams to develop the super car version of the Sierra in 1986, the <a href="Ford_Sierra_RS_Cosworth" title="wikilink">Ford Sierra RS Cosworth</a> which was introduced to race tracks in 1987, though its life was short as it was superseded in mid-1987 by the <a href="Ford_Sierra_RS500" title="wikilink">Ford Sierra RS500</a>. Some of the body panels used to stiffen the Sierra chassis and create the Merkur shell were subsequently branded 909 Motorsport parts for later adaptation to a Sierra shell. Many see the successes and failures of the XR4Ti as being the blueprint for success of the dominant RS500 Sierra's.</p>

<p>Between 1986 and 1987, <a href="Wally_Dallenbach,_Jr." title="wikilink">Wally Dallenbach, Jr.</a> and <a href="Scott_Pruett" title="wikilink">Scott Pruett</a> campaigned the Roush prepped XR4Ti, although of a <a class="uri" href="tubeframe" title="wikilink">tubeframe</a> construction like that of a <a class="uri" href="NASCAR" title="wikilink">NASCAR</a> racer, to take the <a href="Trans-Am_Series" title="wikilink">Trans-Am Series</a> title.</p>
