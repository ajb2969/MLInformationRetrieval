<h1>Ramesses VII</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun <strong>Ramesses VII</strong> (also written <strong>Ramses</strong> and <strong>Rameses</strong>) was the sixth <a class="uri" href="pharaoh" title="wikilink">pharaoh</a> of the <a href="Twentieth_dynasty_of_Egypt" title="wikilink">20th dynasty</a> of <a href="Ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">Ancient Egypt</a>. He reigned from about 1136 to 1129 BC<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and was the son of <a href="Ramesses_VI" title="wikilink">Ramesses VI</a>. Other dates for his reign are 1138-1131 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The Turin Accounting Papyrus 1907+1908 is dated to Year 7 III Shemu day 26 of his reign and has been reconstructed to show that 11 full years passed from Year 5 of Ramesses VI to Year 7 of his reign.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="reign-length">Reign Length</h2>

<p>Ramesses VII's seventh year is also attested in Ostraca O. Strasbourg h 84 which is dated to II Shemu day 16 of his 7th Regnal Year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1980, C.J. Eyre demonstrated that a Year 8 papyri belonged to the reign of Ramesses VII. This papyri, P. Turin Cat. 1883 + 2095, dated to <em>Year 8 IV Shemu day 25</em> (most likely Ramesses VII), details the record of the commissioning of some copper work and mentions two foreman at <a href="Deir_el-Medina" title="wikilink">Deir El-Medina</a>: Nekhemmut and Hor[mose].<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The foreman Hormose was previously attested in office only during the reign of <a href="Ramesses_IX" title="wikilink">Ramesses IX</a> while his father and predecessor in this post—a certain Ankherkhau—served in office from the second decade of the reign of Ramesses III through to Year 4 of Ramesses VII where he is shown acting with Nekhemmut and the scribe Horisheri.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The new Year 8 papyri proves that Hormose succeeded to his father's office as foreman by Year 8 of Ramesses VII. Dominique Valbelle regards C.J. Eyre's attribution of this document to Ramesses VII as uncertain since the chief workman Hormose was previously only securely attested in office in Years 6 and 7 of <a href="Ramesses_IX" title="wikilink">Ramesses IX</a> instead.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> However, this papyrus clearly bears the cartouche of Usermaatre Setepenre—the prenomen of Ramesses VII—at its beginning whereas the royal name of <a href="Ramesses_IX" title="wikilink">Ramesses IX</a> was Neferkare—which rules out Ramesses IX as the king whose Year 8 is recorded in the P. Turin 1883 + 2095 document. The presence of Hormose's contemporary—the foreman Nekhemmut—also establishes that this papyri document dates to the mid-20th dynasty most probably to the reign of Ramesses VII since Nekhemmut is attested in office "from the second year of Ramesses IV until the seventeenth year of Ramesses IX."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>Since Ramesses VII's accession is known to have occurred around the end of <strong>III <a href="Season_of_the_Emergence" title="wikilink">Peret</a></strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> the king would have ruled Egypt for a minimum period of 7 years and 5 months when this document was drawn up provided that it belonged to his reign as seems probable from the royal name given in the papyrus. The respected German Egyptologist <a href="Jürgen_von_Beckerath" title="wikilink">Jürgen von Beckerath</a> also accepts C.J. Eyre's evidence that Year 8 IV Shemu day 25 was Ramesses VII's highest known date.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the accession date of his successor, Ramesses VIII, has been fixed by Amin Amer to an 8-month period between I Peret day 2 and I <a href="Season_of_the_Inundation" title="wikilink">Akhet</a> day 13.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> or 5 months after the Year 8 IV Shemu day 25 date of Ramesses VII. Therefore, if Ramesses VII did not die between the short 2 week period between IV Shemu day 29 to I Akhet 13, this pharaoh would have been on the throne for at least another 4 more months until I Peret day 2 and ruled Egypt for 7 years and 9 months when he died. (perhaps slightly longer if he died after I Peret day 2) Therefore, it is possible that Ramesses VII could have ruled Egypt for almost 8 years; at present, his certain reign length is 7 years and 5 months.</p>

<p>Very little is known about his reign, though it was evidently a period of some turmoil as grain prices soared to the highest level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p> Ramesses VII was buried in Tomb <a class="uri" href="KV1" title="wikilink">KV1</a> upon his death. His mummy has never been found, though four cups inscribed with the pharaoh's name were found in the "royal cache" in <a class="uri" href="DB320" title="wikilink">DB320</a> along with the remains of other pharaohs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
