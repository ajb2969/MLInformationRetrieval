<h1>Footplate</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>footplate</strong> of a <a href="steam_locomotive" title="wikilink">steam locomotive</a> is a large metal plate that rests on top of the <a href="locomotive_frame" title="wikilink">frames</a> and is normally covered with wooden floorboards. It is usually the full width of the locomotive and extends from the front of the cab to the rear of cab or coal bunker just above the <a href="buffer_beam" title="wikilink">buffer beam</a>. The <a class="uri" href="boiler" title="wikilink">boiler</a>, the <a href="cab_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">cab</a>, and other superstructure elements are in turn mounted on the footplate. The footplate does extend beyond the front of the cab on some locomotives, but is then usually referred to as the "running board/plate." The footplate is where the Driver and Fireman stand in the cab to operate the locomotive, giving rise to the expression of working <em>on the footplate</em><ref>{{</ref></p>

<p>The presence of a footplate is almost universal in <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">British</a> locomotive construction, is often (but not universally) seen in continental <a href="Europe" title="wikilink">European</a> locomotives, and practically never on locomotives constructed in the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a>. American practice mounted the locomotive's boiler and cab directly on the frame.<ref>{{</ref></p>

<p>}} The walkways and running boards seen on <a href="American_locomotives" title="wikilink">American locomotives</a> that sometimes give an appearance of a footplate are attached to the boiler or the <a href="pilot_(locomotive)" title="wikilink">pilot</a> and are not structural elements. The absence of a footplate on American locomotives is one thing that makes them look "not quite right" to those accustomed to the British look.</p>

<p>The footplate has openings cut in it for various purposes. The <a href="Firebox_(steam_engine)" title="wikilink">firebox</a> always extends beneath the footplate. The <a href="cylinder_(engine)" title="wikilink">cylinders</a> are beneath the footplate, and steam pipes pass through holes to them. The reversing gear control for the <a href="valve_gear" title="wikilink">valve gear</a> also passes through, and in some locomotives part of the valve motion also extends through the footplate. On <a href="Steam_locomotives_of_British_Railways#BR_standard_classes" title="wikilink">British Railways Standard Locomotives</a> the running plate was high enough to clear the wheels. On earlier British locomotives, the tops of the wheels usually projected through slots in the running plate and were covered by "splashers" which are analogous to <a href="mudguard" title="wikilink">mudguards</a> on a road vehicle.</p>
