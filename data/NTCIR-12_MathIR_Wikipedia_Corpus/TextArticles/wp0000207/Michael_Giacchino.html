Giacchino has received numerous awards for his work, including an <a href="Emmy_Award" title="wikilink">Emmy</a>, multiple <a href="Grammy_Award" title="wikilink">Grammys</a>, a <a href="Golden_Globe_Award" title="wikilink">Golden Globe Award</a>, and an <a href="82nd_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Giacchino was born in <a href="Riverside_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Riverside Township, New Jersey</a>. His father's ancestors came from <a class="uri" href="Sicily" title="wikilink">Sicily</a> and his mother's ancestors immigrated from <a class="uri" href="Abruzzo" title="wikilink">Abruzzo</a> in <a href="Southern_Italy" title="wikilink">Southern Italy</a>; he holds dual American and Italian citizenship.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Giacchino grew up in <a href="Edgewater_Park_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Edgewater Park Township, New Jersey</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and graduated in 1986 from <a href="Holy_Cross_High_School_(New_Jersey)" title="wikilink">Holy Cross High School</a> in <a href="Delran_Township,_New_Jersey" title="wikilink">Delran Township, New Jersey</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Giacchino began combining images and music at age 10, when he began creating <a href="stop-motion_animation" title="wikilink">stop-motion animation</a> with homemade soundtracks in his basement. While in high school, an art teacher who mentored Giacchino recommended to his parents that he attend the <a href="School_of_Visual_Arts" title="wikilink">School of Visual Arts</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>. Giacchino describes visiting the school with his parents thus:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>I thought, wow, this is fantastic. They actually have colleges like this? Where I can do the things that I am really interested in doing? That was amazing to me. I loved SVA. I loved the kind of freedom that it provided. It was kind of like this great experiment—okay, you're here because you like something. So let's see how much you like it. We're not going to regulate you too much. We're going to see how passionate and driven you are, and how much you want this thing.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Giacchino enrolled at SVA, majoring in film production and minoring in history. During his final year at SVA, his instructor in film publicity announced an unpaid internship was available at <a href="Universal_Pictures" title="wikilink">Universal Pictures</a>. Giacchino, who was the only one interested, obtained the six-month position, which he filled at night while attending school during the day and working at <a class="uri" href="Macy's" title="wikilink">Macy's</a> to pay his rent. He graduated from SVA in 1990 with a <a href="Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts" title="wikilink">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a>, after which he took music classes at the <a href="Juilliard_School" title="wikilink">Juilliard School</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="video-games">Video games</h3>

<p>When Giacchino's internship ended, Universal hired him, giving him a job upon graduation from college. He later moved to Disney, and when Disney relocated to Los Angeles, Giacchino moved with them, working in publicity, while taking night classes in instrumentation and orchestration at <a class="uri" href="UCLA" title="wikilink">UCLA</a>. His work for Disney had him interacting with the various personnel who worked in films, such as the producers who hired composers, so when a job at <a href="Disney_Interactive_Studios" title="wikilink">Disney Interactive</a> opened for a producer, Giacchino obtained the job, thinking he could hire himself to write music for the games he produced.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>Giacchino's composition work for Disney Interactive during the 16-bit era included the <a href="Sega_Genesis" title="wikilink">Sega Genesis</a> game <em><a href="Gargoyles_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Gargoyles</a></em>, the SNES game <em><a href="Donald_in_Maui_Mallard" title="wikilink">Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow</a></em> and the various console versions of <em><a href="The_Lion_King_(video_game)" title="wikilink">The Lion King</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> However his first major composition was for the <a class="uri" href="DreamWorks" title="wikilink">DreamWorks</a> video game adaptation of the 1997 movie, <em><a href="The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park_(console_game)" title="wikilink">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The video game was one of the first <a class="uri" href="PlayStation" title="wikilink">PlayStation</a>- (also on Sega Saturn) console title to be recorded with an original live orchestral score. Giacchino has since continued his relationship with DreamWorks which also included composing the score for the <a href="Small_Soldiers_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Small Soldiers (video game)</a> in 1998, providing full orchestral scores for many of their popular videogames. He also worked with Pandemic studios to create the theme for <em><a href="Mercenaries:_Playground_of_Destruction" title="wikilink">Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</a></em>. Giacchino's award-winning compositions covers the first three <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor_(computer_game)" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a></em> series, (<em><a href="Medal_of_Honor:_Underground" title="wikilink">Underground</a></em>, <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor:_Allied_Assault" title="wikilink">Allied Assault</a></em> and <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor:_Frontline" title="wikilink">Frontline</a></em>, along with the original Medal of Honor and <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor:_Heroes_2" title="wikilink">Heroes: 2</a></em>), and also the scores for several other World War II-related video games like <em><a href="Secret_Weapons_Over_Normandy" title="wikilink">Secret Weapons Over Normandy</a></em>, <em><a href="Call_of_Duty" title="wikilink">Call of Duty</a></em> and <em><a href="Call_of_Duty:_Finest_Hour" title="wikilink">Call of Duty: Finest Hour</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Additionally, Giacchino composed themes for <em><a href="The_Incredibles:_Rise_of_the_Underminer" title="wikilink">The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer</a></em>, and co-wrote the theme of <em><a href="Black_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Black</a></em> with composer <a href="Chris_Tilton" title="wikilink">Chris Tilton</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> He also composed the score for <em><a href="Alias_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em>, which was based on the television series of the same name. In 2008 Giacchino wrote music for <em><a href="Turning_Point:_Fall_of_Liberty" title="wikilink">Turning Point: Fall of Liberty</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> In 2007, he returned to the <em>Medal of Honor</em> franchise as he composed the music for <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor:_Airborne" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor: Airborne</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="film-and-television">Film and television</h3>

<p>Giacchino's work on various video games led to his entrance into television.</p>

<p>In 2001, <a href="J._J._Abrams" title="wikilink">J. J. Abrams</a>, producer of the television series <em><a href="Alias_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Alias</a></em>, discovered Giacchino through his video game work and asked him to provide the new show's soundtrack. The soundtrack featured a mix of full orchestral pieces frequently intermingled with upbeat <a href="electronic_music" title="wikilink">electronic music</a>, a departure from much of his previous work. Giacchino would go on to provide the score for J.J. Abrams's 2004 television series <em><a href="Lost_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lost</a></em>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> creating an acclaimed score which employed a unique process of using spare pieces of a <a href="fuselage" title="wikilink">plane fuselage</a> for percussion parts. The score for <em>Lost</em> is also notable for a signature thematic motif: a brass fall-off at the end of certain themes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Just like his counterpart <a href="Stu_Phillips_(composer)" title="wikilink">Stu Phillips</a>, he worked with the television show creator Abrams on his shows with his music scores while Abrams supplied the show's main themes on his certain shows such as <em>Alias</em>.</p>

<p>In 2004, Giacchino received his first big feature film commission. <a href="Brad_Bird" title="wikilink">Brad Bird</a>, director of <a class="uri" href="Pixar" title="wikilink">Pixar</a>'s <em><a href="The_Incredibles" title="wikilink">The Incredibles</a></em>, asked Giacchino to provide the soundtrack for the film after having heard his work on <em>Alias</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The upbeat <a class="uri" href="jazz" title="wikilink">jazz</a> orchestral sound was a departure in style not only for Giacchino but for Pixar, which had previously relied on <a href="Randy_Newman" title="wikilink">Randy</a> and <a href="Thomas_Newman" title="wikilink">Thomas Newman</a> for all of its films. Director Brad Bird had originally sought out <a href="John_Barry_(composer)" title="wikilink">John Barry</a> – perhaps best known for his work on the early <a href="James_Bond" title="wikilink">James Bond</a> films—but Barry was reportedly unwilling to repeat the styles of his earlier works.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>Giacchino was nominated for two <a href="Grammy_Awards" title="wikilink">Grammy Awards</a> in 2005 for <em>The Incredibles</em>: <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Score_Soundtrack_Album_for_a_Motion_Picture,_Television_or_Other_Visual_Media" title="wikilink">Best Score Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media</a> and <a href="Grammy_Award_for_Best_Instrumental_Composition" title="wikilink">Best Instrumental Composition</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Like his other counterparts <a href="Joel_McNeely" title="wikilink">Joel McNeely</a>, <a href="J._A._C._Redford" title="wikilink">J. A. C. Redford</a> and <a href="Frank_DeVol" title="wikilink">Frank DeVol</a>, Giacchino mostly associated with Disney from early in his career up to most recently, ranging from video games such as <em><a href="Mickey_Mania" title="wikilink">Mickey Mania</a></em> and <em><a href="Gargoyles_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Gargoyles</a></em> to films such as <em>The Incredibles</em> and eventually collaborated with <a href="Walt_Disney_Imagineering" title="wikilink">Walt Disney Imagineering</a> in creating two new soundtracks for the updated versions of <a href="Space_Mountain_(Disneyland)" title="wikilink">Space Mountain</a> at <a class="uri" href="Disneyland" title="wikilink">Disneyland</a>, <a href="Space_Mountain:_Mission_2" title="wikilink">Space Mountain: Mission 2</a> at <a href="Disneyland_Paris" title="wikilink">Disneyland Paris</a>, and <a href="Space_Mountain_(Hong_Kong_Disneyland)" title="wikilink">Space Mountain</a> at <a href="Hong_Kong_Disneyland" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Disneyland</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Giacchino also composed scores for the 2005 films <em><a href="Sky_High_(2005_film)" title="wikilink">Sky High</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Family_Stone" title="wikilink">The Family Stone</a></em>, and the television movie <em><a href="The_Muppets'_Wizard_of_Oz" title="wikilink">The Muppets' Wizard of Oz</a></em>. Additionally, he wrote the music for <a href="Joseph_Barbera" title="wikilink">Joseph Barbera</a>'s final theatrical <a href="Tom_and_Jerry" title="wikilink">Tom and Jerry</a> cartoon <em><a href="The_Karate_Guard" title="wikilink">The Karate Guard</a></em>, and scored the Abrams-directed 2006 film <em><a href="Mission:_Impossible_III" title="wikilink">Mission: Impossible III</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Giacchino's next musical achievement was his Paris-inspired score for the Disney-Pixar film <em><a href="Ratatouille_(film)" title="wikilink">Ratatouille</a></em>, which includes the theme song "Le Festin", performed by French artist <a href="Camille_(singer)" title="wikilink">Camille</a>. He received his first <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> <a href="80th_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">nomination</a> for this score. He also created the score for Abrams' 2009 <em><a href="Star_Trek_(film)" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em> film.</p>

<p>Giacchino scored the <a class="uri" href="Pixar" title="wikilink">Pixar</a> film <em><a href="Up_(2009_film)" title="wikilink">Up</a></em> (and its accompanying animated short <em><a href="Partly_Cloudy" title="wikilink">Partly Cloudy</a></em>), for which he collaborated with director <a href="Pete_Docter" title="wikilink">Pete Docter</a>. This marked the first time Giacchino worked with a Pixar director other than Brad Bird. This work gained Giacchino his first <a href="Academy_Award" title="wikilink">Academy Award</a> for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score" title="wikilink">Best Original Score</a>: the first-ever win for Pixar in that category. Giacchino notes that he won on the same night as his SVA classmate Joel Harlow won for <a href="Academy_Award_for_Best_Makeup" title="wikilink">Best Makeup Oscar</a> for <em><a href="Star_Trek_(film)" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>Giacchino has continued his collaboration with J. J. Abrams. For the Abrams-produced monster film <em><a class="uri" href="Cloverfield" title="wikilink">Cloverfield</a></em>, Giacchino wrote an homage to Japanese monster scores in an overture entitled "ROAR!", which played over the credits (and which constituted the only original music for the film). He composed for the pilot of the new Abrams series <em><a href="Fringe_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Fringe</a></em>, after which Giacchino gave scoring duties to his assistant Chad Seiter (who scored the first half of <a href="Fringe_(season_1)" title="wikilink">season one</a>), and then <a href="Chris_Tilton" title="wikilink">Chris Tilton</a> (who scored the latter half of season one and everything after that).</p>

<p>Giacchino has frequently referenced previous work; both in style and naming. Giacchino used themes from the track "U-Boat" from the <em><a href="Medal_of_Honor_(video_game)" title="wikilink">Medal of Honor</a></em> soundtrack in the tracks "Sawyer Jones and the Temple of Boom" and "Sub-Primed" from the 5th and 6th season <em><a href="Lost_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lost</a></em> soundtracks as the submarine motif. In terms of naming, the score for <em><a href="The_Incredibles" title="wikilink">The Incredibles</a></em> contains a piece named "100 Mile Dash", and the album with the score from <em><a href="Ratatouille_(film)" title="wikilink">Ratatouille</a></em> has a track entitled "100 Rat Dash". Another series of examples: "World's Worst Beach Party" from the first <em><a href="Lost_(TV_series)" title="wikilink">Lost</a></em> album, "World's Worst Last 4 Minutes To Live" from the <em><a href="Mission:_Impossible_III" title="wikilink">Mission: Impossible III</a></em> soundtrack, "Galaxy's Worst Sushi Bar" from <em><a href="Star_Trek:_Music_from_the_Motion_Picture" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em> (2010 deluxe release), "World's Worst Landscaping" from the second <em>Lost</em> album, "World's Worst Car Wash" from the soundtrack album <em>Lost: The Final Season</em>, and "World's Worst Field Trip" from the soundtrack of <a href="Super_8_(film)" title="wikilink"><em>Super 8</em></a>. The soundtrack for <em><a href="Mission:_Impossible_–_Ghost_Protocol" title="wikilink">Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol</a></em> also has a track titled "World's Worst Parking Valet". Inversely, the score for <em>Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</em> has a track entitled "World's Best Carpool Lane"; the <a href="Speed_Racer_(soundtrack)" title="wikilink"><em>Speed Racer</em> score</a> has tracks entitled "World's Best Autopia" and "World's Worst Road Rage." Giacchino did music for <em><a href="Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes" title="wikilink">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a></em> and <em><a href="Jurassic_World" title="wikilink">Jurassic World</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="additional-compositions">Additional compositions</h3>

<p>In addition to his long list of soundtracks, in 2005 Giacchino collaborated with <a href="Walt_Disney_Imagineering" title="wikilink">Walt Disney Imagineering</a> in creating two new soundtracks for the updated versions of <a href="Space_Mountain_(Disneyland)" title="wikilink">Space Mountain</a> at <a class="uri" href="Disneyland" title="wikilink">Disneyland</a>, <a href="Space_Mountain:_Mission_2" title="wikilink">Space Mountain: Mission 2</a> at <a href="Disneyland_Paris" title="wikilink">Disneyland Paris</a>, and <a href="Space_Mountain_(Hong_Kong_Disneyland)" title="wikilink">Space Mountain</a> at <a href="Hong_Kong_Disneyland" title="wikilink">Hong Kong Disneyland</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> Giacchino was also contracted by <a href="Sarah_Vowell" title="wikilink">Sarah Vowell</a>, who played character <a href="Violet_Parr" title="wikilink">Violet</a> in <em><a href="The_Incredibles" title="wikilink">The Incredibles</a></em>, to compose the score to the audio version of her book <em><a href="Assassination_Vacation" title="wikilink">Assassination Vacation</a></em>. Michael Giacchino's music can also be heard in "<a href="Star_Tours:_The_Adventure_Continues" title="wikilink">Star Tours: The Adventure Continues</a>" during the "travel log videos" shown in the queue line for both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World versions of the attraction.</p>

<p>In 2009, he was asked to conduct the Academy Awards orchestra for the <a href="81st_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">81st Academy Awards</a>. For this project he rearranged many famous movie themes in different styles, including a 1930s Big Band treatment of <em><a href="Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)" title="wikilink">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> and a bossa nova of <em><a href="Moon_River" title="wikilink">Moon River</a></em>. Giacchino also composed the fanfare for the 100th Anniversary logo for <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="wikilink">Paramount Pictures</a>.</p>
