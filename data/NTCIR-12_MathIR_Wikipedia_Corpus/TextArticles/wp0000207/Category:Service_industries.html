<p>The <strong>service industries</strong> (More formally termed: '<a href="tertiary_sector_of_industry" title="wikilink">tertiary sector of industry</a>' by <a href="economist" title="wikilink">economists</a>) involve the provision of services to businesses as well as final consumers. Such, therefore, include accounting, tradesmanship (like mechanic or plumber services), computer services, restaurants, tourism, etc.</p>

<p>Hence, a <strong>service Industry</strong> is one where <u>no goods are produced</u> whereas <em>primary</em> industries are those that extract minerals, oil etc. from the ground and <em>secondary</em> industries are those that manufacture products, including builders, but not remodeling contractors.</p>
