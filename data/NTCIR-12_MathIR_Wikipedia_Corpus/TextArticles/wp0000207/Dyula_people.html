<h1>Dyula people</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>Dyula</strong> (<strong>Dioula</strong> or <strong>Juula</strong>) are a <a href="Mande_people" title="wikilink">Mande</a> <a href="ethnic_group" title="wikilink">ethnic group</a> inhabiting several <a href="West_African" title="wikilink">West African</a> countries, including the <a class="uri" href="Mali" title="wikilink">Mali</a>, <a href="Cote_d'Ivoire" title="wikilink">Cote d'Ivoire</a>, <a class="uri" href="Ghana" title="wikilink">Ghana</a>, <a href="Burkina_Faso" title="wikilink">Burkina Faso</a>, and <a class="uri" href="Guinea-Bissau" title="wikilink">Guinea-Bissau</a>.</p>

<p>Characterized as a highly successful merchant <a class="uri" href="caste" title="wikilink">caste</a>, <em>Dyula</em> migrants began establishing trading communities across the region in the fourteenth century. Since business was often conducted under non-Muslim rulers, the <em>Dyula</em> developed a set of theological principles for <a class="uri" href="Muslim" title="wikilink">Muslim</a> minorities in non-Muslim societies. Their unique contribution of long-distance commerce, Islamic scholarship and religious tolerance were significant factors to the peaceful expansion of Islam in West Africa.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Mandé embraced Islam during the thirteenth century, following introduction to the faith through contact with the <a href="Soninke_people" title="wikilink">Soninké</a> people and <a href="North_African" title="wikilink">North African</a> traders. By the 14th century the <a href="Mali_Empire" title="wikilink">Malian empire</a> (c.1230-1600) had reached its apogee, acquiring a considerable reputation for the Islamic practice of its court and the pilgrimages of several emperors who followed the tradition of <a href="Lahilatul_Kalabi" title="wikilink">Lahilatul Kalabi</a>, the first black prince to make <em><a class="uri" href="hajj" title="wikilink">hajj</a></em> to <a class="uri" href="Mecca" title="wikilink">Mecca</a>. It was at this time that Mali began encouraging some of its local merchants to establish colonies close to the gold fields of West Africa. This migrant trading class were known as <em>dyula</em>, the <a href="Mandinka_language" title="wikilink">Mandingo</a> word for “merchant”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>dyula</em> spread throughout the former area of Mandé culture, from the Atlantic coast of <a class="uri" href="Senegambia" title="wikilink">Senegambia</a> to the <a class="uri" href="Niger" title="wikilink">Niger</a>, and from the southern edge of the <a class="uri" href="Sahara" title="wikilink">Sahara</a> to forest zones further south. They established decentralized townships in non-Muslim colonies that were linked to an extensive commercial network, in what was described by professor <a href="Philip_D._Curtin" title="wikilink">Philip D. Curtin</a> as a “trading diaspora.” Motivated by business imperatives, they expanded into new markets, founding settlements under the auspices of various local rulers who often permitted self-governance and autonomy. Organization of <em>dyula</em> trading companies were based a clan-family structure known as the <em>lu</em> - a working unit consisting of a father, his sons, and other attached males. Members of a given <em>lu</em> dispersed from the <a class="uri" href="savanna" title="wikilink">savanna</a> to the forest, managed circulation of goods and information, placed orders, and effectively controlled the economic mechanisms of <a href="supply_and_demand" title="wikilink">supply and demand</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="suwarian-tradition">Suwarian Tradition</h3>

<p> Over time <em>dyula</em> colonies developed a <a class="uri" href="theological" title="wikilink">theological</a> rationale for their relations with non-Muslim ruling classes and subjects in what author Nehemia Levtzion dubbed “accommodationist Islam”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The man credited with formulating this rationale is Sheikh <a href="Al-Hajj_Salim_Suwari" title="wikilink">Al-Hajj Salim Suwari</a>, a <a href="Soninke_people" title="wikilink">Soninke</a> cleric from the core Mali area who lived around 1500. He made <em>hajj</em> to <a class="uri" href="Mecca" title="wikilink">Mecca</a> several times and devoted his intellectual career to developing an understanding of the faith that would assist Muslim minorities in “<a class="uri" href="pagan" title="wikilink">pagan</a>” lands. He drew on North African and Middle Eastern jurists and <a class="uri" href="theologians" title="wikilink">theologians</a> who had reflected on the situations of Muslims living among non-Muslim majorities, situations that were frequent in the centuries of Islamic expansion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Sheikh Suwari formulated the obligations of Muslim minorities in West Africa into something known as the <em>Suwarian tradition</em>. It stressed the need for Muslims to coexist peaceably with unbelievers, and so justified a separation of religion and politics. In this understanding Muslims must nurture their own learning and piety and thereby furnish good examples to the non-Muslims around them. They could accept jurisdiction of non-Muslim authorities, as long as they had the necessary protection and conditions to practice the faith. In this teaching Suwari followed a strong predilection in Islamic thought for any government, albeit non-Muslim or tyrannical, as opposed to none. The military <em><a class="uri" href="jihad" title="wikilink">jihad</a></em> was a resort only if the faithful were threatened. Suwari discouraged <em><a class="uri" href="dawah" title="wikilink">dawah</a></em> (missionary), instead contending that <a class="uri" href="Allah" title="wikilink">Allah</a> would bring non-Muslims to Islam in His own way; it was not a Muslims responsibility to decide when ignorance should give way to belief. Since their Islamic practice was capable of accommodating traditional cults, <em>dyula</em> often served as priests, <a href="Fortune-telling" title="wikilink">soothsayers</a> and counselors at the courts of <a class="uri" href="animist" title="wikilink">animist</a> rulers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="commercial-and-political-expansion">Commercial and Political Expansion</h2>

<p>As fellow Muslims, <em>dyula</em> merchants were also able to assess the valuable <a href="trans-Saharan_trade" title="wikilink">trans-Saharan trade</a> network, conducted by North African Arabs and <a href="Berber_people" title="wikilink">Berbers</a> whom they met at commercial centers across the <a class="uri" href="Sahel" title="wikilink">Sahel</a>. Some important trade goods included gold, <a class="uri" href="millet" title="wikilink">millet</a>, slaves, kola nuts from the south and slave beads and <a href="cowrie_shells" title="wikilink">cowrie shells</a> from the north (for use as <a class="uri" href="currency" title="wikilink">currency</a>). It was under Mali that the great cities of the Niger bend - including <a class="uri" href="Gao" title="wikilink">Gao</a> and <a class="uri" href="Djenné" title="wikilink">Djenné</a> - prospered, with Timbuktu in particular becoming known across Europe for its great wealth. Important trading centers in southern West Africa developed at the transitional zone between the forest and the savanna; examples include <a class="uri" href="Begho" title="wikilink">Begho</a> and <a href="Bono_Manso" title="wikilink">Bono Manso</a> (in present-day Ghana) and <a class="uri" href="Bondoukou" title="wikilink">Bondoukou</a> (in present-day Côte d'Ivoire). Western trade routes continued to be important, with <a class="uri" href="Ouadane" title="wikilink">Ouadane</a>, <a class="uri" href="Oualata" title="wikilink">Oualata</a> and <a class="uri" href="Chinguetti" title="wikilink">Chinguetti</a> being the major trade centres in what is now <a class="uri" href="Mauritania" title="wikilink">Mauritania</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="penetration-into-southern-forest-regions">Penetration into Southern Forest Regions</h3>

<p>The development of <em>dyula</em> trade in Ghana and the adjacent Ivory Coast had important political consequences, and sometimes military implications as well. The <em>dyula</em> spearheaded Mande penetration of the forested zones in the south by establishing caravan routes and trading posts at strategic locations throughout the region en route to cola producing areas. By the start of the sixteenth century, <em>dyula</em> merchants were trading as far south as the coast of modern Ghana.</p>

<p>On the forests northern fringes, new states emerged such as <a href="Bono_Kingdom" title="wikilink">Bono</a> and Banda. As the economic value of gold and kola became appreciated, forests south of these states - which had hitherto been little inhabited because of limited agricultural potential - became more thickly populated, and the same principles of political and military mobilization began being applied there. Village communities became tributaries of ruling groups, with some members becoming the clients and slaves needed to support royal households, armies, and trading enterprises. Sometimes these political changes were not to the advantage of the <em>dyula</em>, who employed Mande warriors to guard their caravans and, if necessary, could call in larger contingents from the Sudanic kingdoms. In the seventeenth century, tensions between the Muslims and the local pagans in Begho erupted into a destructive war which eventually led to the total abandonement of the Banda capital. The local people eventually settled in a number of towns further east, while the dyula withdrew to the west, to the further side of the Banda hills, where they established the new trading center of <a class="uri" href="Bonduku" title="wikilink">Bonduku</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="gonja-state">Gonja State</h3>

<p>The <em>dyula</em> presence and changes in the balance of power occasioned political upheavals in other places. Among the paramount Mande political initiatives along trade routes south of <a href="Djenné" title="wikilink">Jenne</a> was creation of the <em>dyula</em> state of <a href="Gonja_people" title="wikilink">Gonja</a> in the early 17th century. This was apparently motivated by a general worsening of the competitive position of dyula traders, and was occasioned by three factors: (1) a near monopoly control in exporting forest produce achieved by the Akan kingdom of Bono; (2) the rise to power further north of the <a href="Dagomba_people" title="wikilink">Dagomba</a> kingdom, which controlled local salt pans; and (3) increased competition following the arrival in the region of rival long-distance traders from <a class="uri" href="Hausaland" title="wikilink">Hausaland</a>.</p>

<p>The reaction of the Dyula in the Bono-Banda-Gonja region to these developments was to erect a kingdom of their own in Gonja - the territory northern traders had to cross to reach Akan forestlands, situated in what is now modern <a class="uri" href="Ghana" title="wikilink">Ghana</a>. By 1675, Gonja had established a <a href="paramount_chief" title="wikilink">paramount chief</a> called <a class="uri" href="Yagbongwura" title="wikilink">Yagbongwura</a>, to control the kingdom. But Gonja was not a fruitful land in which to try to maintain a centralized government. This is because the Dagomba power to the north and Akan power to the south were too powerful thus, the new kingdom rapidly declined in strength.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="kong-empire">Kong Empire</h3>

<p>Many of the trading posts established by the <em>dyula</em> eventually became market villages or cities, such as <a href="Kong,_Côte_d'Ivoire" title="wikilink">Kong</a> in today's north-eastern Côte d'Ivoire. It emerged as a commercial center when Malian merchants began trading in the territory which was inhabited by pagan Senufo and other Voltaic groups. The sous-préfecture of Kong, in the area of Kong to <a class="uri" href="Dabakala" title="wikilink">Dabakala</a>, is said to be the “origin” area, where <em>dyula</em> traders first settled in the twelfth century. <em>Dyula</em> presence in the Kong area grew rapidly in the seventeenth century as a result of the developing trade between the commercial centers along the Niger banks and the forest region to the south, which was controlled by the Baule chiefdoms and by <a href="Ashanti_people" title="wikilink">Ashanti</a>. The <em>dyula</em> brought their trading skills and connections, and transformed Kong into an international market for the exchange of northern desert goods, such as salt and cloth, and southern forest exports such as cola nuts, gold, and slaves. The city was also a religious center that housed a substantial academic community of Muslim scholars, with palaces and mosques built in the traditional <a class="uri" href="Sudanese" title="wikilink">Sudanese</a> style. As Kong grew prosperous, its early rulers – from the Taraweré clan, combined <em>dyula</em> and Senufo traditions and extended their authority over the surrounding region.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>By the eighteenth century the <em>dyula</em> had become quite powerful in the area and wished to rid themselves of subordination to Senufo chiefs. This was achieved in an uprising led by Seku Wattara (Ouattara), a <em>dyula</em> warrior who claimed descent from the Malinke Keita lineage and who had studied the Quran and engaged in commerce before becoming a warrior. By rallying around himself all <em>dyula</em> in the area, Seku Wattara easily defeated local chiefdoms and set up an independent <em>Dyula</em> state in 1710, the first of its kind in West Africa. He established himself as ruler and, under his authority, the city rose from a small city-state to the capital of the great <a href="Kong_Empire" title="wikilink">Kong Empire</a> holding sway over much of the region. The <em>dyula</em> of Kong also maintained commercial links with European traders on the Atlantic coast, around the <a href="Gulf_of_Guinea" title="wikilink">Gulf of Guinea</a>, from whom they easily obtained prized European goods, most notably rifles, gunpowder and textiles. The acquisition of weapons allowed for the creation of an armed militia force that protected trade routes passing through the territories of various minor rulers. In the course of developing his state, Seku Wattara built a strong army composed mostly of defeated pagan groups. The leadership of the army eventually developed into a new warrior class, called <em>sonangi</em>, which was gradually separated from the overall <em>dyula</em> merchant class.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>The Kong Empire started to decline after the death of Seku Wattara. Succession struggles divided the kingdom into two parts, the northern area being controlled by Seku’s brother Famagan who refused to recognize the rule of Seku’s oldest son in the south. Towards the end of the nineteenth century many of Kong’s provinces had formed independent chiefdoms. The city of Kong retained the prestige of an Islamic commercial center, but it was no longer the seat of an important political power. It eventually came under French colonial control in 1898. Despite the fall from glory, the seventeenth century Kong Friday Mosque survived and the city was largely rebuilt in a traditional <a href="Sudano-Sahelian" title="wikilink">Sudano-Sahelian architectural</a> style and features a Qur'anic school.</p>
<h3 id="kingdom-of-wasulu">Kingdom of Wasulu</h3>

<p> The Mande conquerors of the nineteenth century frequently utilized trade routes established by the <em>dyula</em>. Indeed, it was his exploitation of their commercial network that allowed military leader <a href="Samory_Touré" title="wikilink">Samory Touré</a> (1830–1900) to rise to a dominant position in the <a href="Upper_Niger" title="wikilink">Upper Niger</a> region. A member of a <em>dyula</em> family from Sanankoro in <a class="uri" href="Guinea" title="wikilink">Guinea</a>, Samori conquered and united <em>dyula</em> states during the 1860s. He gained control over the Milo River Valley in 1871, seized the village of <a class="uri" href="Kankan" title="wikilink">Kankan</a> in 1881, and became the principal power-holder on the upper Niger. By 1883, Samori had successfully brought the local chieftains under his control and officially founded the kingdom of <a class="uri" href="Wasulu" title="wikilink">Wasulu</a>.</p>

<p>Having established an empire, he adopted the religious title of <em><a class="uri" href="Almami" title="wikilink">Almami</a></em> in 1884 and recreated the Malian realm. This new state was governed by Samori and a council of kinsmen and clients who took on the management of the chancery and the <a class="uri" href="treasury" title="wikilink">treasury</a>, administered justice, religious affairs, and <a href="Foreign_policy" title="wikilink">foreign relations</a>. Unlike some of his contemporary state-builders, Samori was not a religious preacher and Wasulu was not a reformist state as such. Nevertheless, he used Islam to unify the nation, promoting Islamic education and basing his rule on <em><a class="uri" href="shari’a" title="wikilink">shari’a</a></em> (Islamic law). However, Samori’s professional army was the essential institution and the real strength behind his empire. He imported horses and weapons and modernized the army along European lines.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Dyula</em> traders had never enjoyed as much prosperity as they did under the <em>almamy</em>. Even though they did not play a central part in the creation of the state, the <em>dyula</em> supported Samori because he actively encouraged commerce and protected trade routes, thus promoting a free circulation of people and goods. Samori put up the strongest resistance to European colonial penetration in West Africa, fighting both the French and British for seventeen years. Samori’s would-be Muslim empire was undone by the French, who took <a class="uri" href="Sikasso" title="wikilink">Sikasso</a> in 1898, and sent Samori into exile, where he died in 1900.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p><em>Dyula</em> society is hierarchical or <a class="uri" href="caste" title="wikilink">caste</a>-based, with <a class="uri" href="nobility" title="wikilink">nobility</a> and vassals. Like numerous other African peoples, they previously held slaves (<em>jonw</em>), who were often <a href="prisoner_of_war" title="wikilink">war prisoners</a> from lands surrounding their territory. Descendants of former kings and generals had a higher status than their <a class="uri" href="nomadic" title="wikilink">nomadic</a> and more settled compatriots. With time, that difference has eroded, corresponding to the economic fortunes of the groups.</p>

<p>The traditional <em>dyula</em> social structure is further organized into various familial <a class="uri" href="clan" title="wikilink">clan</a> groups, and clan affiliation continues to be a dominant aspect of both collective and individual identity. People are fiercely loyal to their clan lineage, often expressing their cultural history and devotion through the oral traditions of dance and storytelling. The <em>dyula</em> are <a class="uri" href="patrilineal" title="wikilink">patrilineal</a> and <a class="uri" href="patriarchal" title="wikilink">patriarchal</a>, with older males possessing the most power and influence. Men and women commonly reside in separate houses made of mud or cement - men occupying round houses and women in rectangular ones. The father heads the family and inheritances are passed down from fathers to their sons. Despite being illegal, the <em>dyula</em> still practice <a class="uri" href="polygamy" title="wikilink">polygamy</a> and young people are often encouraged to marry within their own clan.</p>

<p>Another hereditary class that was afforded a particularly important status by the <em>dyula</em> social hierarchy was occupied by the <em>tuntigi</em>, or warrior class. The <em>dyula</em> had long been accustomed to surrounding their cities with fortifications and taking up arms when it was deemed necessary in order to defend themselves and maintain the smooth flow of trade caravans. As a result, they became closely associated with the <em>tuntigi</em> warrior class. {{-}}</p>
<h2 id="islamic-tradition">Islamic Tradition</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>

</figure>

<p>The <em>dyula</em> have been predominantly Muslim since the 13th century. Many in rural areas combine Islamic beliefs with certain pre-Islamic animistic traditions, such as the presence of spirits and use of <a class="uri" href="amulets" title="wikilink">amulets</a>. <em>Dyula</em> communities have a reputation for historically maintaining a high standard of Muslim education. The <em>dyula</em> family enterprise based on the <em>lu</em> could afford to provide some of its younger men an Islamic education. Thus, an <em><a class="uri" href="ulema" title="wikilink">ulema</a></em> (clerical) class known as <a class="uri" href="karamogo" title="wikilink">karamogo</a> emerged, who were educated in the Quran and commentary (<em><a class="uri" href="tafsir" title="wikilink">tafsir</a></em>), <em><a class="uri" href="hadith" title="wikilink">hadith</a></em> (prophetic narrations), and the life of the <a href="Prophet_Muhammad" title="wikilink">Prophet Muhammad</a>. According to the <em>dyula</em> clerical tradition, a student received instruction under a single <em><a class="uri" href="sheikh" title="wikilink">sheikh</a></em> for a duration varying from five to thirty years, and earned his living as a part-time farmer working his teacher's lands. After completed his studies, a <em>karamogo</em> obtained a turban and an <em><a class="uri" href="isnad" title="wikilink">isnad</a></em> (teaching license), and either sought further instruction or to start his own school in a remote village. A highly educated <em>karamogo</em> could become a professional <em><a class="uri" href="imam" title="wikilink">imam</a></em> or <em><a class="uri" href="qadi" title="wikilink">qadi</a></em> (judge).</p>

<p>Certain families gained a reputation for providing multiple generations of scholars. For example, the Saghanughu clan was a <em>dyula</em> lineage living in the northern and western Ivory Coast and parts of the <a href="Republic_of_Upper_Volta" title="wikilink">Upper Volta</a>. This lineage may be traced to Timbuktu, but its principal figure was Sheikh Muhammad al-Mustafa Saghanughu (d. 1776), the <em>imam</em> of Bobo-Dyulasso. He produced an educational system based on three canonical texts of Quranic commentary (<em><a class="uri" href="tafsir" title="wikilink">tafsir</a></em>) and <em>hadith</em>. His sons continued spreading their father’s teachings and expanded through towns in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, founding Islamic schools, or <a href="madrassah" title="wikilink">madaris</a>, and acting as <em>imams</em> and <em>qadis</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>These <em>madaris</em> were probably a positive by-product of the long history of Muslims’ interest in literary work. In "<em>The Islamic Literary Tradition in Ghana</em>", author <a href="Thomas_Lionel_Hodgkin" title="wikilink">Thomas Hodgkin</a> enumerates the large literary contribution that was made by Dyula-<a href="Wangara,_Burkina_Faso" title="wikilink">Wangara</a> Muslims to the history of not only the regions they found themselves in but also of West Africa as a whole. He cites al-Hajj Osmanu Eshaka Boyo of <a href="Kintampo_District" title="wikilink">Kintampo</a> as an “<em><a href="'alim" title="wikilink">alim</a></em> with a wide range of Muslim connexions and an excellent grasp of local Islamic history” whose efforts brought together a great many Arabic manuscripts from around Ghana. These manuscripts, the <em>Isnad al-shuyukh wa’l-ulama</em>, or <em>Kitab Ghunja</em>, compiled by al-Hajj ‘Umar ibn Abi Bakr ibn ‘Uthman al-Kabbawi al-Kanawi al-Salaghawi of Kete-Krachi who Hodgkin describes as “the most interesting, and historically significant of the poets,” may now be found in the library of the <a href="Institute_of_African_Studies" title="wikilink">Institute of African Studies</a> of the <a href="University_of_Ghana" title="wikilink">University of Ghana</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="dioula-language">Dioula language</h2>

<p>The <em>dyula</em> speak the <a href="Dioula_language" title="wikilink">Dioula language or <em>Julakan</em></a>, which is included in the group of closely interrelated <a href="Manding_languages" title="wikilink">Manding languages</a> that are spoken by various ethnic groups spread across Western Africa. Dioula is most closely related to the <a href="Bambara_language" title="wikilink">Bambara language</a> (the most widely spoken language in Mali), in a manner similar to the relation between American English and British English.
