<h1>Reap the Wild Wind</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Reap the Wild Wind</em></strong> was a serialized story written by <a href="Thelma_Strabel" title="wikilink">Thelma Strabel</a> in 1940 for <em><a href="The_Saturday_Evening_Post" title="wikilink">The Saturday Evening Post</a></em>, which was the basis for the <a href="1942_in_film" title="wikilink">1942 film</a> starring <a href="Ray_Milland" title="wikilink">Ray Milland</a>, <a href="John_Wayne" title="wikilink">John Wayne</a>, <a href="Paulette_Goddard" title="wikilink">Paulette Goddard</a>, <a href="Robert_Preston_(actor)" title="wikilink">Robert Preston</a>, and <a href="Susan_Hayward" title="wikilink">Susan Hayward</a>, and directed by <a href="Cecil_B._DeMille" title="wikilink">Cecil B. DeMille</a>, his second <a href="film" title="wikilink">picture</a> to be filmed in color. The movie, released shortly after the United States' entry into <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, was a swashbuckling adventure set in the 1840s along the <a class="uri" href="Florida" title="wikilink">Florida</a> coast, and was wildly successful.</p>

<p>While he based his film on Strabel's story, DeMille took liberties with details such as sibling relationships and sub-plots, while staying true to the spirit of the story, which centers on a headstrong, independent woman portrayed by Paulette Goddard.</p>
<h2 id="plot-of-the-film">Plot of the film</h2>

<p>As the film opens, Loxi Claiborne (<a href="Paulette_Goddard" title="wikilink">Paulette Goddard</a>) is running a salvage business started by her deceased father. A <a class="uri" href="hurricane" title="wikilink">hurricane</a> is just passing through the <a href="Key_West" title="wikilink">Key West</a> area, leaving behind at least one wreck on the nearby shoals. The <em>Jubilee</em> founders and Loxi and other salvagers race to claim the cargo. Not arriving first, Loxi and her crew rescue the captain, Jack Stuart (<a href="John_Wayne" title="wikilink">John Wayne</a>), but do not share in the salvage rights. It appears that the first salvor on the scene, King Cutler (<a href="Raymond_Massey" title="wikilink">Raymond Massey</a>), may have actually planned the wreck.  Nursing Jack back to health, Loxi falls in love with him. When she visits Charleston with her cousin Drusilla (<a href="Susan_Hayward" title="wikilink">Susan Hayward</a>), Loxi schemes to win a plum captain's position for Jack by seducing Steve Tolliver (<a href="Ray_Milland" title="wikilink">Ray Milland</a>), who is running the sailing ship line Jack works for. Steve falls for Loxi and returns with her to Key West to investigate the truth about Jack's shipwreck.</p>

<p>Drusilla goes home to <a class="uri" href="Havana" title="wikilink">Havana</a> when Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the <a href="Florida_Keys" title="wikilink">Keys</a> of pirates like Cutler (and to be near Loxi). Cutler in turn arranges to have Steve shanghaied by the crew of a whaler. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later, they discover that Steve has concealed Jack's appointment to the steamship <em>Southern Cross</em> on orders from his superior. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler. He then learns that Steve's boss has just died, and Steve will be taking over the ship line. Jack realizes that he is unlikely to keep his command with Steve in charge. He agrees to work with Cutler to sabotage his new ship and sails to Havana to take command.  Rumors circulate and prices of the cargo of the <em>Southern Cross</em> go up and down wildly, leaving Steve to suspect a wreck is planned. He commandeers the <em>Claiborne</em> with Loxi on board and heads to Havana to stop Jack. Loxi, believing Jack is innocent, disables her ship, and they sit becalmed in a fog bank as the <em>Southern Cross</em> piles into a reef and sinks. Unknown to Jack, Drusilla had stowed away to be with her lover, King's brother Dan Cutler (<a href="Robert_Preston_(actor)" title="wikilink">Robert Preston</a>), and she is drowned.</p>

<p>Jack is put on trial for wrecking his ship. The testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman is in the wreck, Steve agrees to dive to the wreck with Jack. While down in the wreck, Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned. They are attacked by a giant <a class="uri" href="squid" title="wikilink">squid</a>. Jack saves Steve's life but is lost when the <em>Southern Cross</em> slips off the underwater shelf into deep water. Dan Cutler accuses his brother of murder and is shot dead by him, whereupon Steve shoots King Cutler, killing him.</p>

<p>Loxi winds up in Charleston with Steve, apparently now in love with him.</p>

<p> The film is unusual among films starring John Wayne. Foremost, it is one of relatively few films in which he plays a character with a notable dark side. He had second thoughts about signing on since he was unsure how his fans would react to him being bested by a "foppish" Ray Milland. Additionally, it is also one of only eleven feature films in which Wayne's character is dead by the <a href="closing_credits" title="wikilink">closing credits</a>. The other films are <em><a href="The_Deceiver_(film)" title="wikilink">The Deceiver</a>, <a href="The_Sea_Chase" title="wikilink">The Sea Chase</a>, <a href="Central_Airport_(film)" title="wikilink">Central Airport</a>, <a href="The_Alamo_(1960_film)" title="wikilink">The Alamo</a>, <a href="The_Cowboys" title="wikilink">The Cowboys</a>, <a href="Wake_of_the_Red_Witch" title="wikilink">Wake of the Red Witch</a>, <a href="The_Fighting_Seabees" title="wikilink">The Fighting Seabees</a>, <a href="Sands_of_Iwo_Jima" title="wikilink">Sands of Iwo Jima</a></em> and <em><a href="The_Shootist" title="wikilink">The Shootist</a></em>. The eleventh is <em><a href="The_Man_Who_Shot_Liberty_Valance" title="wikilink">The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</a></em> though his character was dead at the beginning of the film and his death was not depicted in the film.</p>

<p>This film also marks the final appearance by <a href="Hedda_Hopper" title="wikilink">Hedda Hopper</a> as an actress in a significant role. The <a href="gossip_columnist" title="wikilink">gossip columnist</a> would, however, make <a href="cameo_appearance" title="wikilink">cameo appearances</a> in subsequent films.</p>
