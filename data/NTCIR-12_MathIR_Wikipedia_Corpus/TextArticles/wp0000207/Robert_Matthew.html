<h2 id="early-life-studies">Early life &amp; studies</h2>

<p>Robert Matthew was the son of John Fraser Matthew (1875-1955)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (also an architect, and the partner of <a href="Robert_Lorimer" title="wikilink">Sir Robert Lorimer</a>) and his wife, Annie Broadfoot Hogg.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>From 1920 the family lived at 43 Minto Street.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Robert was born and brought up in <a class="uri" href="Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, was educated at <a href="Stewart's_Melville_College" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Institution</a> and attended the <a href="Edinburgh_College_of_Art" title="wikilink">Edinburgh College of Art</a> where he studied under <a href="John_Begg" title="wikilink">John Begg</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="family-life">Family life</h2>

<p>In 1931 Matthew married Lorna Pilcher. They had three children: Robert Aidan Matthew, born in July 1936, Janet Frances Catriona Matthew, born in March 1939, and Jessie Ann Matthew born in June 1952. From 1939 they lived at 12 Darnaway Street, Edinburgh and from 1956 they lived at <a href="Keith_Marischal" title="wikilink">Keith Marischal</a> House, <a class="uri" href="Humbie" title="wikilink">Humbie</a>, East Lothian.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>

<p>Robert was apprenticed with his father's firm. Then in 1936, he joined the Department of Health (Scotland), where by 1945 he had risen to become their Chief Architect and Planning Officer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1946, Matthew moved to <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>, becoming Chief Architect and Planning Officer to the <a href="London_County_Council" title="wikilink">London County Council</a>, where he served from 1946 to 1953, working on the post-war reconstruction of Greater London and masterminding the Festival of Britain including such buildings as the <a href="Royal_Festival_Hall" title="wikilink">Royal Festival Hall</a>, 1951. It was during these formative postwar years that the LCC’s housing and town planning policy established an international reputation, and many housing schemes (including the famous Roehampton housing estate) were created, as well as many schools.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1956, with Stirrat Johnson Marshall, Robert Matthew established the firm of <a class="uri" href="RMJM" title="wikilink">RMJM</a> (Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall) in Edinburgh and London. Their first project was <a href="New_Zealand_House" title="wikilink">New Zealand House</a> in the Haymarket, London (now considered one of Matthew's key buildings). In 1953 he returned to Edinburgh to become the first Professor of Architecture at the <a href="University_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">University of Edinburgh</a>, where he established the new Department of Architecture in collaboration with RMJM, in a manner that has been compared to that of <a href="Walter_Gropius" title="wikilink">Walter Gropius</a> at the <a class="uri" href="Bauhaus" title="wikilink">Bauhaus</a>. He continued as Professor there until 1968. The Matthew Architecture Gallery is now housed in the Department in his honour.</p>

<p>Matthew was closely involved with <a href="Basil_Spence" title="wikilink">Basil Spence</a> and <a href="Alan_Reiach" title="wikilink">Alan Reiach</a> in the University's development plan for George Square, which ultimately resulted in the demolition of three sides of the square, and their replacement with modernist buildings. Matthew/RMJM were directly responsible for the design of the Arts Faculty buildings, now called the <a href="David_Hume" title="wikilink">David Hume</a> tower, <a href="Adam_Ferguson" title="wikilink">Adam Ferguson</a> building and the William Robertson building.</p>

<p>In the early 1960s Matthew was involved in the replacement of overcrowded, insanitary tenement housing in Hutchesontown, Glasgow with high rise tower blocks. His Waddell Court 16-storey blocks – built in 1964 - on the banks of the River Clyde still stand, and are widely regarded as the more successful of the Gorbals high-rises.</p>

<p> In Edinburgh he was also behind the <a href="Royal_Commonwealth_Pool" title="wikilink">Royal Commonwealth Pool</a>, <a href="British_Home_Stores" title="wikilink">British Home Stores</a> on <a href="Princes_Street" title="wikilink">Princes Street</a>, <a href="Edinburgh_Airport" title="wikilink">Edinburgh Airport</a>, <a href="Lothian_Regional_Council" title="wikilink">Lothian Regional Council</a> Building and <a href="Wester_Hailes" title="wikilink">Wester Hailes</a> Education Centre.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Matthew/RMJM were both involved in the design for the campuses of the <a href="University_of_Stirling" title="wikilink">University of Stirling</a> and <a href="University_of_York" title="wikilink">University of York</a>, and with <a class="uri" href="Pakistan" title="wikilink">Pakistan</a>'s new capital buildings in <a class="uri" href="Islamabad" title="wikilink">Islamabad</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="honours">Honours</h2>

<p>During his studies, Robert Matthew won the <a href="Augustus_Welby_Northmore_Pugin" title="wikilink">Pugin</a> Student award (1929) and was <a href="John_Soane" title="wikilink">Soane</a> medallist (1932). He became a Fellow of the <a href="Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects" title="wikilink">RIBA</a> in 1955 and served as its President from 1962 to 1964. He was awarded an <a href="Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="wikilink">OBE</a> in 1952 and <a href="knight" title="wikilink">knighted</a> in 1962. He was later also President of the Commonwealth Association of Architects [CAA] and the International Union of Architects [UIA].<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="other-arts">Other arts</h2>

<p>Apart from his work as an architect, Matthew produced drawings that were widely exhibited, and also paintings, although they are less well known. Both display the same aesthetic concerns as <a href="Le_Corbusier" title="wikilink">Le Corbusier</a>, <a href="Pablo_Picasso" title="wikilink">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href="Henry_Moore" title="wikilink">Henry Moore</a> all of whom he was able to count among his friends and colleagues.</p>
