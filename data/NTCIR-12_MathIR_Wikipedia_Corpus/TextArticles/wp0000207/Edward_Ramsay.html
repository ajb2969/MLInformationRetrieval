This appointment followed the death of <a href="Daniel_Sandford_(bishop_of_Edinburgh)" title="wikilink">Bishop Daniel Sandford</a>, founder of the church. His house from this period was a very large townhouse on the edge of the Moray Estate, 7 Darnaway Street, only five minutes walk from his church through <a href="Charlotte_Square" title="wikilink">Charlotte Square</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1838 he formed a new branch of the church, thereafter known as the Scottish Episcopal Church. In 1841 he was elected Dean of the Diocese of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Over and above his religious activity he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1828, and became Vice-President of the society in 1862.</p>

<p>He was also one of the founders of <a href="Glenalmond_College" title="wikilink">Glenalmond College</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>His memorial, an imposing 7.3m high Celtic cross in Shep granite with bronze sculpted panels, is on <a href="Princes_Street" title="wikilink">Princes Street</a> in the grounds of <a href="Church_of_St_John_the_Evangelist,_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Church of St John the Evangelist, Edinburgh</a> facing Castle Street. It was designed by the architect <a href="Rowand_Anderson" title="wikilink">Rowand Anderson</a> and built by Farmer and Brindley of London. The bronze panels are by F.A. Skedmore. It was erected in 1879.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The memorial is independent of his grave which lies in the eastern enclosure attached to the church.</p>

<p>The Episcopal Church still runs a charitable trust, The Dean Ramsay Fund, in his name.</p>
