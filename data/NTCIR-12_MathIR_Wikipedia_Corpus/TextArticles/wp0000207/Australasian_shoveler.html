<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>

<p>The correct common name for <em>Anas rhynchotis</em> is <strong>Australasian shoveler</strong> no matter which country it is found in. It was previously categorised as two subspecies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A. rhynchotis rhynchotis</em> <strong>Australian shoveler</strong>, the nominate race, occurs in southwestern and southeastern <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a> and <a class="uri" href="Tasmania" title="wikilink">Tasmania</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li><em>A. rhynchotis variegata</em> <strong>New Zealand shoveler</strong>, occurs in <a href="New_Zealand" title="wikilink">New Zealand</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Other names used include: spoonbill, shoveler, spoony, spoonie and shoveller.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The <a href="Māori_language" title="wikilink">Māori</a> name of <strong>kuruwhengi</strong> is still valid.</p>
<h2 id="courtship-breeding-in-new-zealand">Courtship &amp; Breeding in New Zealand</h2>

<p>Courtship in New Zealand starts around August which involves vocalisations from the drake (male) accompanied with head-bobbing whilst swimming toward the duck (female). The most heard vocalisations are from the drakes in the form of a "Sock, sock-sock, sock, sock-sock". Often several drakes will peruse an already paired duck: Generally the mated males are aggressive &amp; will not tolerate this behavior from the bachelors, &amp; fighting may ensue. Courtship flights are common in the morning &amp; evenings mostly, where the duck is followed in a short rapid flight by one or more (usually two) drakes. This tests the speed &amp; agility of the drakes. The duck may be biased in picking the 'winner' in these tests however, especially if she has paired with one of the competitors. She will even sometimes excrete mid-flight on a perusing male if he is especially not to her fancy. There is a clear &amp; unexplained sex ratio difference with a lot more males to females. This difference is not present in broods of ducklings however. Males with a lot of white breast feathers are not usually paired. These white feathers are often a sign of an older shoveler as first year males almost never have them. Mating will occur as early as August, though nesting rarely happens until at least October <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
