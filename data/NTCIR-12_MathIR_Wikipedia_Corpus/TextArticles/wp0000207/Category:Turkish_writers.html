<h1>Category:Turkish writers</h1>
<hr/>

<p>This category is for writers who were nationals of the modern national state of <a class="uri" href="Turkey" title="wikilink">Turkey</a>. Writers who died before 1923, or emigrated from what is now Turkey before that year, should be placed in <a href=":Category:Ottoman_writers" title="wikilink">:Category:Ottoman writers</a>. Writers prior to 1300 may need to be given a category other than that. Writers who died in 1923 might also not belong here if they had stopped writing significantly before then. Those who wrote in the <a href="Turkish_language" title="wikilink">Turkish language</a> but were not nationals of Turkey should be put in <a href=":Category:Turkish-language_writers" title="wikilink">:Category:Turkish-language writers</a>.</p>
