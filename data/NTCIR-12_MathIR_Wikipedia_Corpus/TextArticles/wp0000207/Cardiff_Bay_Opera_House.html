<h1>Cardiff Bay Opera House</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Cardiff Bay Opera House</strong> was a proposed centre for the performing arts in <a href="Cardiff_Bay" title="wikilink">Cardiff Bay</a>, <a class="uri" href="Cardiff" title="wikilink">Cardiff</a>, <a class="uri" href="Wales" title="wikilink">Wales</a>, conceived in the 1990s as a crucial part of the <a href="Cardiff_Bay" title="wikilink">Cardiff Bay</a> redevelopment project. One aim was of the scheme was the creation of a new home for the <a href="Welsh_National_Opera" title="wikilink">Welsh National Opera</a> company, which was then based in the <a href="New_Theatre_(Cardiff)" title="wikilink">New Theatre</a> in Cardiff. The <a href="Wales_Millennium_Centre" title="wikilink">Wales Millennium Centre</a> was built in its place and it opened in 2004.</p>

<p>The plan, supported by the <a href="Cardiff_Bay_Development_Corporation" title="wikilink">Cardiff Bay Development Corporation</a>, was to construct a permanent home for <a href="Welsh_National_Opera" title="wikilink">Welsh National Opera</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> on a site near the Inner Harbour, Cardiff Bay. An international design competition was held and was eventually won by the <a class="uri" href="Iraq" title="wikilink">Iraq</a>-born architect <a href="Zaha_Hadid" title="wikilink">Zaha Hadid</a>. The Hadid design was called the <strong>Crystal Necklace</strong> by some in the media.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, the project failed to win financial support from the <a href="Millennium_Commission" title="wikilink">Millennium Commission</a>, the body which distributed funds from the UK <a href="National_Lottery_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">National Lottery</a>.</p>

<p>An international design competition was established by the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust to decide on the architect for the project. The competition would eventually be in two rounds. The first round of the competition attracted 268 international competitors;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> it was won by Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid. The list of architectural practices that took part in the competition included <a href="Itsuko_Hasegawa" title="wikilink">Itsuko Hasegawa</a>, <a href="Mario_Botta" title="wikilink">Mario Botta</a>, <a href="Rem_Koolhaas" title="wikilink">Rem Koolhaas</a>, <a href="Rafael_Moneo" title="wikilink">Rafael Moneo</a>, <a href="Manfredi_Nicoletti" title="wikilink">Manfredi Nicoletti</a>, Pietro Marcozzi Architect, Rusli Associates, <a href="Werner_Seligmann" title="wikilink">Werner Seligmann</a> &amp; Associates, <a href="Percy_Thomas_Partnership" title="wikilink">Percy Thomas Partnership</a> and <a href="Greg_Lynn" title="wikilink">Greg Lynn FORM</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Her avant-garde design was radical glass structure that surrounded the main theatre. However, her design was so radical that <a href="Nicholas_Edwards,_Baron_Crickhowell" title="wikilink">Lord Crickhowell</a> as chair of the Cardiff Bay Opera House Trust, asked Hadid to submit her design again along with <a href="Norman_Foster,_Baron_Foster_of_Thames_Bank" title="wikilink">Norman Foster + Partners</a> and Manfredi Nicoletti, who were asked to submit revised designs, for a second round of competition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> But she again won this round, and a third round, too.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>

<p>The project lacked support from either <a href="South_Glamorgan" title="wikilink">South Glamorgan</a> County Council or <a href="Cardiff_City_Council" title="wikilink">Cardiff City Council</a> and was savaged by the media as being "elitist". The <a href="Millennium_Commission" title="wikilink">Millennium Commission</a>, which gave funding to such projects from the UK National Lottery, refused to fund the project as it considered it to be financially risky. This was not helped by the successful application for funding for the <a href="Millennium_Stadium" title="wikilink">Millennium Stadium</a>, just a few miles away. Eventually, the project collapsed. The project was also said to have been destroyed by conservatism and provincialism in relation to the modern architecture, and by <a href="Cardiff_Council" title="wikilink">Cardiff Council</a>'s support for the <a href="Millennium_Stadium" title="wikilink">Millennium Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>The decision to formally reject the bid for <a href="National_Lottery_(United_Kingdom)" title="wikilink">lottery money</a> by the <a href="Millennium_Commission" title="wikilink">Millennium Commission</a> was announced on 22 December 1995.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Many claim that the bid failed because of the widespread unpopularity of the <a href="Millennium_Commission" title="wikilink">Millennium Commission</a> support for the <a href="Royal_Opera_House" title="wikilink">Royal Opera House</a> in <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>, which was seen as elitist.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Virginia_Bottomley" title="wikilink">Virginia Bottomley</a>, <a href="Secretary_of_State_for_Culture,_Media_and_Sport" title="wikilink">Secretary of State for National Heritage</a>, announced in a news conference that the project was flawed by uncertainties in the building's financing and construction, which made it the project too risky. Lord Crickhowell interrupted that news conference to denounce the rejection. He said the decision was "...shocking and incomprehensible...If this had been a project in London, it would be getting backing...You can understand the annoyance of people in Wales that we can't get the kind of vitally important projects that London seems to be allowed."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The project was succeeded by the <a href="Wales_Millennium_Centre" title="wikilink">Wales Millennium Centre</a>, which included a broader range of artistic offerings and was said to be more in keeping with Welsh culture, whilst retaining the opera element. The Centre opened in November 2004, on the site originally intended for Opera House.</p>
