<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>

<p><em>GURPS Technomancer</em> provides a setting in an alternative modern <a class="uri" href="Earth" title="wikilink">Earth</a> where <a href="magic_(game)" title="wikilink">magic</a> co-exists with <a class="uri" href="technology" title="wikilink">technology</a>.</p>

<p>The premise of this world setting is that the detonation of the first <a href="atomic_bomb" title="wikilink">atomic bomb</a> by the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> triggered a transformation of reality. The mushroom cloud became a permanent magical tornado emitting bolts of red lightning. The resulting wave of magical energy and fallout also modified the genes of countless new-born children. This created both magically apt individuals as well as <em>chimeras</em> — people with some animal traits.</p>

<p>The campaign book contains a post-event timeline; a set of new magic spells suitable for the campaign; rules for mixing magic with modern technology; descriptions of the emergent non-human creatures; 20 character templates for campaign-specific careers; character-building advantages, disadvantages, skills, and equipment; a detailed description of the effects of magic on our society; information on various organizations, and a geography of locations significantly affected by the release of magic.</p>

<p>Listed as requirements to use the book are the <em>GURPS Basic Set</em> (3rd edition revised) and <em>GURPS Magic</em> (2nd edition). <em>GURPS Grimoire</em> is also recommended for use in expanding the list of available spells.</p>
