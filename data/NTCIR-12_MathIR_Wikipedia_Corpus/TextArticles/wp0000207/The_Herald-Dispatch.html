<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><em>The Herald-Dispatch</em> was founded in 1909 when two Huntington newspapers, the <em>Herald</em> and the <em>Dispatch</em>, merged.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1927, the newspaper became a part of the Huntington Publishing Company, operated by Joseph Harvey Long, the owner of the <em>Huntington Advertiser</em>. The company was operated by the Long family until 1971, when it was sold to the <em><a href="Honolulu_Star_Bulletin" title="wikilink">Honolulu Star Bulletin</a></em> and then to Gannett ten months later.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Its companion afternoon paper, the <em>Huntington Advertiser</em>, ceased as a separate publication in 1979. Prior to the <em>Huntington Advertiser's</em> demise, the combined Sunday newspaper was referred to as the <em>Herald-Advertiser</em>, correctly depicted in the movie <em><a href="We_Are_Marshall" title="wikilink">We Are Marshall</a></em>. Today, it also publishes the <em>Putnam Herald</em> and the <em>Lawrence Herald</em>, more localized editions of <em>The Herald-Dispatch</em> serving <a href="Putnam_County,_West_Virginia" title="wikilink">Putnam County, West Virginia</a> and <a href="Lawrence_County,_Ohio" title="wikilink">Lawrence County, Ohio</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>For the six-month period ending March 31, 2005, the total average paid circulation was 29,098 for the daily edition and 35,552 for the Sunday edition.</p>

<p>On May 8, 2007, the newspaper was sold to <a href="Gatehouse_Media" title="wikilink">Gatehouse Media</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> then to <a href="Champion_Industries" title="wikilink">Champion Industries</a> on June 29.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>On May 23, 2009, the newspaper revealed that it was in default of a 70 million dollar loan from the <a href="Fifth-Third_Bank" title="wikilink">Fifth-Third Bank</a> and the previous owners, and fired 24 employees, representing about 15% of its workforce. In October 2011, they were forced to lay off more employees, suggesting that they were still in difficult financial straits.</p>

<p>In 2013, Champion Industries sold <em>The Herald-Dispatch</em> to Douglas Reynolds, the son of the CEO.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
