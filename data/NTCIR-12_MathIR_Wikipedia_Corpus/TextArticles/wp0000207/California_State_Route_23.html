<h1>California State Route 23</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>State Route 23</strong> (<strong>SR 23</strong>) is a <a href="state_highway" title="wikilink">state highway</a> which runs roughly from <a href="Fillmore,_California" title="wikilink">Fillmore</a> to <a href="Malibu,_California" title="wikilink">Malibu</a>. This route is part of the <a href="California_Freeway_and_Expressway_System" title="wikilink">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="route-description">Route description</h2>

<p>Route 23 is known as the Military Intelligence Service Memorial Highway from US 101 to California Route 118.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Route 23 consists of three distinct sections. The southern section begins as Decker Canyon Road near Trancas in <a href="Malibu,_California" title="wikilink">Malibu</a>, where Route 23 intersects with the <a href="State_Route_1_(California)" title="wikilink">Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1)</a>, or "PCH." This portion provides numerous beautiful vistas of the <a href="Santa_Monica_Mountains" title="wikilink">Santa Monica Mountains</a> and the Pacific Ocean during daytime, but extreme caution is advisable, especially as the road nears PCH. It is a notoriously dangerous road, and the rusted chassis of cars that have gone over the side can still be seen. <a href="Philip_Taylor_Kramer" title="wikilink">Philip Taylor Kramer</a>, bassist with the rock band <a href="Iron_Butterfly" title="wikilink">Iron Butterfly</a> from 1974-1977, allegedly committed suicide by driving his van over the side along this route. Along its steep and winding path through the <a href="Santa_Monica_Mountains" title="wikilink">Santa Monica Mountains</a> as an increasingly tight and twisting canyon road until its intersection with Potrero Road, Route 23 becomes Westlake Boulevard, where it departs <a href="Los_Angeles_County,_California" title="wikilink">Los Angeles County</a> for <a href="Ventura_County,_California" title="wikilink">Ventura County</a> and heads roughly two miles northeast through the Westlake section of <a href="Thousand_Oaks,_California" title="wikilink">Thousand Oaks</a>, a developed residential community. SR 23 then merges with <a href="U.S._Route_101_in_California" title="wikilink">Ventura Freeway (U.S. Route 101)</a> and runs concurrently with it north to the Moorpark Freeway.</p>

<p>The middle section, known as the <strong>Moorpark Freeway</strong>, is a major route for traffic headed between Thousand Oaks and <a href="Moorpark,_California" title="wikilink">Moorpark</a>. It starts in Thousand Oaks, splitting off from the concurrency with Route 101 and heading north, with three lanes in both directions. The Moorpark Freeway terminates at the exit for Los Angeles Avenue when the freeway turns east to become the <a href="State_Route_118_(California)" title="wikilink">Ronald Reagan Freeway (State Route 118)</a>. Funding for widening of the freeway was approved August 18, 2005, with construction to begin in February 2006, to be completed in 2009. The widening was completed ahead of schedule in April 2008. Officially, this portion is named the Military Intelligence Memorial Freeway, in honor of the <a href="U.S._100th_Infantry_Battalion" title="wikilink">U.S. 100th Infantry Battalion</a> and <a href="442nd_Regimental_Combat_Team" title="wikilink">442nd Regimental Combat Team</a>, composed entirely of <a href="Japanese_American" title="wikilink">Japanese Americans</a>. Traffic along this freeway during <a href="rush_hour" title="wikilink">rush hour</a> is extremely congested, particularly near the intersection with the 101.</p>

<p>The northernmost section begins at <a href="California_State_Route_118" title="wikilink">State Route 118</a> in Moorpark (called <em>Los Angeles Avenue</em> in Moorpark), and heads north as Grimes Canyon Road through orange groves and sandstone cliffs. In <a href="Fillmore,_California" title="wikilink">Fillmore</a>, it terminates at <a href="State_Route_126_(California)" title="wikilink">State Route 126</a>. The road in Fillmore actually continues past Route 126 up to the foot of the <a href="Los_Padres_National_Forest" title="wikilink">Los Padres National Forest</a>.</p>

<p>On SR 23 from Tierra Rejada Road and Olsen Road (and vice versa) is a bike lane. After crossing Tierra Rejada Road (going north) and Olsen Road (going south), bicyclists are prohibited from crossing.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>State Route 23 has been designated as such since 1934. However, at this time it was also designated as Legislative Route 155. The freeway portion of SR 23 opened in several phases between 1971 and 1994.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Before then, SR 23 intersected with U.S. 101 near <a href="Newbury_Park,_California" title="wikilink">Newbury Park</a>, although it still ran concurrently with U.S. 101, which was then an expressway.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>SR 23 was designated as part of the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="decker-freeway">Decker Freeway</h3>

<p> <strong>Decker Freeway</strong> was a never built north–south freeway that would connect <a href="CA_118" title="wikilink">CA 118</a>, <a href="US_101" title="wikilink">US 101</a>, and <a href="California_State_Route_1" title="wikilink">CA 1</a>. The freeway was part of a 1958 plan by the <a href="Metropolitan_Engineering_Board" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Engineering Board</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> but was later considered to be geographically improbable and the plans were abandoned.<br/>
The freeway's southern portion, from CA 1 to US 101, follows the general alignment of Decker Canyon Road and Westlake Blvd, a segment of <a href="CA_23" title="wikilink">CA 23</a>. It would continue north before terminating at CA 118 near First Street.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
