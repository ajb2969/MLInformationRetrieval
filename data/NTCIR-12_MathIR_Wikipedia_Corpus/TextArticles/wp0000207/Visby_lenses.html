<h1>Visby lenses</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The <strong>Visby lenses</strong> are a collection of <a href="Lens_(geometry)" title="wikilink">lens</a>-shaped manufactured objects made of <a href="rock_crystal" title="wikilink">rock crystal</a> (quartz) found in several Viking graves on the island of <a class="uri" href="Gotland" title="wikilink">Gotland</a>, Sweden, and dating from the 11th or 12th century. Some were in <a class="uri" href="silver" title="wikilink">silver</a> mounts with <a class="uri" href="filigree" title="wikilink">filigree</a>, the mounting covering the back of the lens, and were probably used as jewellery; it has been suggested that the lenses themselves are much older than their mounts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some of the lenses can be seen at the Fornsal historical museum in <a class="uri" href="Visby" title="wikilink">Visby</a>, while some are in the <a href="Swedish_National_Museum" title="wikilink">Swedish National Museum</a> in <a class="uri" href="Stockholm" title="wikilink">Stockholm</a>, and others have been lost.</p>

<p>It was reported by Otto Ahlström in 1950 that most have <a href="aspheric_lens" title="wikilink">aspheric</a> surfaces.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The best of the lenses have low spherical aberration, indicating that their surface profile was optimized to improve image quality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Most of the lenses, however, do not show any sign of optimization and produce worse images than a simple spherical lens.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p> The lenses are bi-aspheric and two of them have very good imaging properties. Their surface appears to be an oblate <a class="uri" href="ellipse" title="wikilink">ellipse</a>, while the surface nearest the eye approaches a <a class="uri" href="parabola" title="wikilink">parabola</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The best example of the lenses measures  in diameter and has a thickness of  at its centre, with an <a href="angular_resolution" title="wikilink">angular resolution</a> of 25–30 μm.</p>

<p>The Visby lenses provide evidence that sophisticated lens-making techniques were being used by craftsmen over 1,000 years ago, at a time when researchers had only just begun to explore the laws of refraction. According to Schmidt and his co-workers, it is clear that the craftsmen worked by trial and error, since the mathematics to calculate the best form for a lens were not discovered until several hundred years later.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It has been suggested that the knowledge required to make such lenses was restricted to only a few craftsmen, and perhaps a single person.</p>

<p>Excavations at <a class="uri" href="Fröjel" title="wikilink">Fröjel</a> on Gotland in 1999 discovered evidence of local manufacture of beads and lenses from rock crystal, with unworked pieces of crystal coexisting with partially finished beads and lenses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Prior to the Fröjel finds it had been suggested that the lenses were not produced by the Vikings, as there are hints that they were in fact produced in <a class="uri" href="Byzantium" title="wikilink">Byzantium</a> or Eastern Europe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> The Vikings of Gotland were known to have participated in trade networks that reached as far as <a class="uri" href="Constantinople" title="wikilink">Constantinople</a>.</p>
<h2 id="proposed-uses">Proposed uses</h2>

<p>Various uses have been proposed for the lenses. They may have been used by craftsmen for magnification in fine work, as <a href="reading_stone" title="wikilink">reading stones</a>, or to start fires.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Olaf Schmidt has speculated that they may have been used as part of a <a class="uri" href="telescope" title="wikilink">telescope</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
