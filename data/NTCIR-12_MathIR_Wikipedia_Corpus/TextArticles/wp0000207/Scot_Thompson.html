<p><strong>Scot Thompson</strong> (born February 11, 1981 in <a href="New_York,_New_York" title="wikilink">New York, New York</a>) is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="association_football" title="wikilink">soccer</a> player.</p>

<p>On January 20, 2010 he was ranked 21st in the <a href="USL_First_Division" title="wikilink">USL First Division</a> Top 25 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He was the official community ambassador for the Portland Timbers and involved in social media connecting with fans, both Twitter and Facebook, for the Timbers.</p>

<p>Thompson grew up in <a href="Rancho_Santa_Margarita,_California" title="wikilink">Rancho Santa Margarita, California</a>, and was a standout defender at <a href="Trabuco_Hills_High_School" title="wikilink">Trabuco Hills High School</a> from 1995 to 1999, where he was a four year Varsity starter, and earned all South Coast League 1st Team Honors for three years. During this time, Thompson was invited to train with the US National Under-19 Squad. In Thompson's senior year the Mustangs earned a share of the South Coast League title and were knocked out of the quarter-finals of the CIF playoffs.</p>

<p>Thompson played <a href="college_soccer" title="wikilink">college soccer</a> at <a class="uri" href="UCLA" title="wikilink">UCLA</a> from 1999 to 2002, helping lead the Bruins to a national championship in 2002. He finished his career at UCLA with 68 starts, and was named to the first-team All-Pac-10 as a senior.</p>

<p>Thompson was selected in the second round (16th overall) in the <a href="2003_MLS_SuperDraft" title="wikilink">2003 MLS SuperDraft</a> by <a href="Los_Angeles_Galaxy" title="wikilink">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>. Unfortunately for Thompson, he tore his <a href="Anterior_Cruciate_Ligament" title="wikilink">ACL</a> in the preseason, and missed the entire 2003 season as a result. Returning healthy in 2004, Thompson was nevertheless unable to break into the Galaxy's starting lineup - he was loaned mid-season to the Portland Timbers of the A-League, where he excelled. Thompson started 13 games for the team, registering two assists, while helping lead the team to the A-League's best regular season record. When the Timbers were eliminated from the playoffs, Thompson returned to the Galaxy; however, he only made one appearance, playing a single minute.</p>

<p>Thompson was released at the end of the season and, despite professing intentions of going to Europe, re-signed with the Timbers. In July 2005, Thompson put in an impressive performance for the Timbers in a friendly match against English soccer team <a href="Sunderland_FC" title="wikilink">Sunderland</a>, which had been recently promoted to the English Premier League. He was invited to participate in a several week training session with Sunderland later in 2005, although he was not offered a contract with the club. History repeated itself in 2006: after an impressive performance in an exhibition match against English soccer team <a href="Coventry_City" title="wikilink">Coventry City</a>, he was invited to a 10 day trial training session in August.</p>

<p>Thompson became the Timbers all-time leader in minutes on July 23, 2009. On February 26, 2010 Portland announced the re-signing of Thompson to a new contract for the 2010 season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>After a particularly noteworthy play, his fans in Portland routinely chant "S-C-O-T, Scot with One T!"</p>
