<p><strong>Hannah Lee Fox</strong> (born September 29, 1969), better known as <strong>Hannah Fox</strong> is a former <a href="Women's_boxing" title="wikilink">female boxer</a>. She is from <a href="Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="wikilink">Las Vegas, Nevada</a>. Her nickname is "The Vegas", which made her name sound like "Hannah The Vegas Fox" when introduced to fans before a fight.</p>

<p>Her first professional fight came on December 26, 1997, when she beat <a href="Heidi_Tide" title="wikilink">Heidi Tide</a> by a decision in four, in Las Vegas. On her second fight, January 23 of 1998, she got her first <a class="uri" href="knockout" title="wikilink">knockout</a> win, finishing her fight with <a href="Teara_Anne_Sanders" title="wikilink">Teara Anne Sanders</a> in the first round.</p>

<p>Fox won her next seven fights in a row, with two knockouts. Among her foes during that initial, nine fight winning streak, were Tide in a rematch, <a href="Julie_Birdsell" title="wikilink">Julie Birdsell</a>, who antagonized Fox on Fox's first fight outside <a class="uri" href="Nevada" title="wikilink">Nevada</a>, with Fox winning an eight round decision at <a href="Biloxi,_Mississippi" title="wikilink">Biloxi, Mississippi</a>, and the well known fighters, <a href="Diana_Dutra" title="wikilink">Diana Dutra</a>, and <a href="Dawn_George" title="wikilink">Dawn George</a>.</p>

<p>On January 15, 1999, she suffered her first, and only, career loss, when outpointed by <a href="Fredia_Gibbs" title="wikilink">Fredia Gibbs</a> over eight rounds in Las Vegas. Fox, however, kept on the rise after this defeat: she had set her mind on one goal, and that was to become a world boxing champion.</p>

<p>After the loss to Gibbs came a rematch with Dutra, and Fox defeated the young hopeful once again, this time by a unanimous six round decision. Then, she fought <a href="Glenda_Watkins" title="wikilink">Glenda Watkins</a>, beating her by another six round decision, and becoming the <a href="International_Female_Boxers_Association" title="wikilink">IFBA</a>'s number one ranked challenger for the IFBA's world Jr. welterweight title.</p>

<p>The opportunity she had long dreamed about finally came on June 11, 1999, at <a href="Bossier_City,_Louisiana" title="wikilink">Bossier City, Louisiana</a>, when she challenged <a href="Leah_Mellinger" title="wikilink">Leah Mellinger</a> for Mellinger's world Jr. Welterweight championship. Fox became the IFBA's world Jr. Welterweight champion by defeating Mellinger by a ten round decision.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>With her dream finally accomplished, Fox retired, and has not made an attempt at a comeback.</p>

<p>Her boxing record was 12 wins, with only 1 loss, and 3 knockout wins.</p>
