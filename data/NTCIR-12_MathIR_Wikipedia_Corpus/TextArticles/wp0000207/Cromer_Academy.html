<p>The school is part of a partnership of schools known as the Cromer Campus, with the neighbouring Suffield Park Infants and Cromer Junior School. Many students go through all three schools in the Campus. In 2006 it reintroduced a House system with vertically integrated form groups with approximately 5 students from every year group in a form. There are 5 forms in a house. The houses are called Blogg (blue), Bailey (red), Dixon (green), and Reed (purple) and are named after Cromer Lifeboats.</p>

<p>In May 2010 the school was inspected by Ofsted and graded as a "good school with outstanding features". Several aspects of the school's work were graded as outstanding, including leadership and management, assessment, management of teaching and learning, welfare and safety of students, and students' care guidance and support. Ofsted has a few 'grades' unsatisfied, poor, good and outstanding.</p>
