<h1>Lickorish–Wallace theorem</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>Lickorish–Wallace theorem</strong> in the theory of <a href="3-manifold" title="wikilink">3-manifolds</a> states that any <a href="closed_manifold" title="wikilink">closed</a>, <a class="uri" href="orientable" title="wikilink">orientable</a>, connected 3-manifold may be obtained by performing <a href="Dehn_surgery" title="wikilink">Dehn surgery</a> on a <a href="framed_link" title="wikilink">framed link</a> in the <a class="uri" href="3-sphere" title="wikilink">3-sphere</a> with ±1 surgery coefficients. Furthermore, each component of the link can be assumed to be unknotted.</p>

<p>The theorem was proved in the early 1960s by <a href="W._B._R._Lickorish" title="wikilink">W. B. R. Lickorish</a> and <a href="Andrew_H._Wallace" title="wikilink">Andrew H. Wallace</a>, independently and by different methods. Lickorish's proof rested on the <a href="Lickorish_twist_theorem" title="wikilink">Lickorish twist theorem</a>, which states that any orientable <a class="uri" href="automorphism" title="wikilink">automorphism</a> of a closed orientable <a class="uri" href="surface" title="wikilink">surface</a> is generated by <a href="Dehn_twist" title="wikilink">Dehn twists</a> along 3<em>g</em> − 1 specific simple closed curves in the surface, where <em>g</em> denotes the <a href="genus_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">genus</a> of the surface. Wallace's proof was more general and involved adding handles to the boundary of a higher-dimensional ball.</p>

<p>A corollary of the theorem is that every closed, orientable 3-manifold bounds a <a class="uri" href="simply-connected" title="wikilink">simply-connected</a> compact <a class="uri" href="4-manifold" title="wikilink">4-manifold</a>.</p>

<p>By using his work on automorphisms of non-orientable surfaces, Lickorish also showed that every closed, non-orientable, connected 3-manifold is obtained by Dehn surgery on a link in the non-orientable 2-sphere bundle over the circle. Similar to the orientable case, the surgery can be done in a special way which allows the conclusion that every closed, non-orientable 3-manifold bounds a compact 4-manifold.</p>
