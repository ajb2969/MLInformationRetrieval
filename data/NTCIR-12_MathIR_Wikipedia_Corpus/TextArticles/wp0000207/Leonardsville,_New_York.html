<p><strong>Leonardsville</strong> is a <a href="Hamlet_(New_York)" title="wikilink">hamlet</a> on the <a href="Unadilla_River" title="wikilink">Unadilla River</a> in the <a class="uri" href="Town" title="wikilink">Town</a> of <a href="Brookfield,_New_York" title="wikilink">Brookfield</a> in <a href="Madison_County,_New_York" title="wikilink">Madison County, New York</a>, <a class="uri" href="USA" title="wikilink">USA</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

These were known locally as <em>the shops</em> and included a <a class="uri" href="scythe" title="wikilink">scythe</a> and <a href="Hoe_(tool)" title="wikilink">hoe</a> <a class="uri" href="factory" title="wikilink">factory</a>, a <a class="uri" href="blacksmith" title="wikilink">blacksmith</a> <a href="Retailing#Shops_and_Stores" title="wikilink">shop</a>, a <a href="grist_mill" title="wikilink">grist mill</a>, a <a href="saw_mill" title="wikilink">saw mill</a>, a <a class="uri" href="horse" title="wikilink">horse</a> <a href="rake_(tool)" title="wikilink">rake</a> factory and <a class="uri" href="wagon" title="wikilink">wagon</a> shop, and a <a class="uri" href="foundry" title="wikilink">foundry</a> and <a class="uri" href="machine" title="wikilink">machine</a> shop.</p>

<p>As with many small communities, Leonardsville was given its name by the <a href="Post_Office_Department" title="wikilink">Post Office Department</a>, which in this case named if after <a href="Reuben_Leonard" title="wikilink">Reuben Leonard</a> who, in his early years, ran a local <a class="uri" href="grocery" title="wikilink">grocery</a> and <a href="dry_goods" title="wikilink">dry goods</a> <a class="uri" href="business" title="wikilink">business</a> that became a convenient location to drop off <a class="uri" href="mail" title="wikilink">mail</a> for local residents.</p>

<p>In 1856, the grist mill, saw mill and <a class="uri" href="agricultural" title="wikilink">agricultural</a> implement factory were destroyed by fire, but were rebuilt immediately. Soon after that, the shops were purchased by the <a class="uri" href="Babcock" title="wikilink">Babcock</a> family who operated them until the 1930s, employing at their peak over 100 workers. Until the 1950s, when the manufacturing shops closed, Leonardsville was a stop on the <a href="Unadilla_Valley_Railroad" title="wikilink">Unadilla Valley Railroad</a>, had a <a class="uri" href="milk" title="wikilink">milk</a> station (now a <a class="uri" href="recycling" title="wikilink">recycling</a> center) and a <a href="feed_store" title="wikilink">feed store</a>. None of the manufacturing buildings remain, but the former <a href="Crandall_Department_Store" title="wikilink">Crandall Department Store</a> still stands and is now the regionally known <a href="Horned_Dorset_Restaurant" title="wikilink">Horned Dorset Restaurant</a>.</p>

<p>Leonardsville had its own <a class="uri" href="kindergarten" title="wikilink">kindergarten</a> through 12th grade central school until 1969, when the district merged with <a href="Bridgewater_(town),_New_York" title="wikilink">Bridgewater</a> and <a href="West_Winfield,_New_York" title="wikilink">West Winfield</a>, creating the <a href="Mount_Markham" title="wikilink">Mount Markham</a> <a href="Political_subdivisions_of_New_York_State#Central_school_district" title="wikilink">Central School district</a>. The building was one of the new district's <a href="elementary_school" title="wikilink">elementary schools</a> until 2001, but now is used for specialized <a href="education" title="wikilink">educational</a> programs.</p>
