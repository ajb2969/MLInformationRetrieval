<h1>Gershom Scholem</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Gerhard Scholem</strong> who, after his immigration from Germany to Palestine, changed his name to <strong>Gershom Scholem</strong> (<a class="uri" href="Hebrew" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a>: גרשם שלום) (December 5, 1897 – February 21, 1982), was a German-born Israeli philosopher and historian. He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern, academic study of <a class="uri" href="Kabbalah" title="wikilink">Kabbalah</a>, becoming the first Professor of <a href="Jewish_Mysticism" title="wikilink">Jewish Mysticism</a> at the <a href="Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His close friends included <a href="Walter_Benjamin" title="wikilink">Walter Benjamin</a> and <a href="Leo_Strauss" title="wikilink">Leo Strauss</a>, and selected letters from his correspondence with those philosophers have been published.</p>

<p>Scholem is best known for his collection of lectures, <em>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism</em> (1941) and for his biography <em>Sabbatai Zevi, the Mystical Messiah</em> (1973). His collected speeches and essays, published as <em>On Kabbalah and its Symbolism</em> (1965), helped to spread knowledge of Jewish mysticism among non-Jews.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>

<p>Gerhard Scholem was born in <a class="uri" href="Berlin" title="wikilink">Berlin</a> to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His interest in <a class="uri" href="Judaica" title="wikilink">Judaica</a> was strongly opposed by his father, a printer, but, thanks to his mother's intervention, he was allowed to study <a href="Hebrew_language" title="wikilink">Hebrew</a> and the <a class="uri" href="Talmud" title="wikilink">Talmud</a> with an <a href="Orthodox_Judaism" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> rabbi.</p>

<p>Gerhard Scholem met <a href="Walter_Benjamin" title="wikilink">Walter Benjamin</a> in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended only with Benjamin's suicide, committed while fleeing Nazi persecution in 1940. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the <a href="Humboldt_University_of_Berlin" title="wikilink">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>, where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew, and where he came into contact with <a href="Martin_Buber" title="wikilink">Martin Buber</a>, <a href="Shmuel_Yosef_Agnon" title="wikilink">Shmuel Yosef Agnon</a>, <a href="Hayim_Nahman_Bialik" title="wikilink">Hayim Nahman Bialik</a>, <a href="Ahad_Ha'am" title="wikilink">Ahad Ha'am</a>, and <a href="Zalman_Shazar" title="wikilink">Zalman Shazar</a>.</p>

<p>In Berlin, Scholem first befriended and became an admirer of <a href="Leo_Strauss" title="wikilink">Leo Strauss</a> (their correspondence would continue throughout his life).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He subsequently studied <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a> at the <a href="University_of_Jena" title="wikilink">University of Jena</a> under <a href="Gottlob_Frege" title="wikilink">Gottlob Frege</a>. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in <a href="semitic_languages" title="wikilink">semitic languages</a> at the <a href="Ludwig_Maximilians_University_of_Munich" title="wikilink">Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich</a>. Less notable in his academic career was his establishment of the fictive <a href="University_of_Muri" title="wikilink">University of Muri</a> with Benjamin.</p>

<p>Scholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, <em><a href="Bahir" title="wikilink">Sefer ha-Bahir</a></em>. Drawn to <a class="uri" href="Zionism" title="wikilink">Zionism</a>, and influenced by Buber, he emigrated in 1923 to the <a href="British_Mandate_of_Palestine" title="wikilink">British Mandate of Palestine</a>, where he devoted his time to studying Jewish mysticism and became a librarian, and eventually head of the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. He later became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Scholem taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud.</p>

<p>Scholem's brother <a href="Werner_Scholem" title="wikilink">Werner</a> was a member of the ultra-left "Fischer-Maslow Group" and the youngest ever member of the <a href="Reichstag_(Weimar_Republic)" title="wikilink">Reichstag</a>, representing the <a class="uri" href="Communist" title="wikilink">Communist</a> Party (<a href="Communist_Party_of_Germany" title="wikilink">KPD</a>) in the German parliament. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the <a href="Third_Reich" title="wikilink">Third Reich</a>. Gershom Scholem, unlike his brother, was vehemently opposed to both <a class="uri" href="Communism" title="wikilink">Communism</a> and <a class="uri" href="Marxism" title="wikilink">Marxism</a>.</p>

<p>Scholem died in <a class="uri" href="Jerusalem" title="wikilink">Jerusalem</a>, where he is buried next to his wife in Sanhedria. <a href="Jürgen_Habermas" title="wikilink">Jürgen Habermas</a> delivered the eulogy.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="theories-and-scholarship">Theories and scholarship</h2>

<p>  Scholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish <a class="uri" href="mysticism" title="wikilink">mysticism</a> with the approach of the 19th-century school of the <em><a href="Wissenschaft_des_Judentums" title="wikilink">Wissenschaft des Judentums</a></em> ("Science of Judaism"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as <a class="uri" href="history" title="wikilink">history</a>, <a class="uri" href="philology" title="wikilink">philology</a>, and <a class="uri" href="philosophy" title="wikilink">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>Jewish mysticism was seen as Judaism's weakest scholarly link. Scholem told the story of his early research when he was directed to a prominent rabbi who was an expert on <a class="uri" href="Kabbalah" title="wikilink">Kabbalah</a>. Seeing the rabbi's many books on the subject, Scholem asked about them, only to be told: "This trash? Why would I waste my time reading nonsense like this?" (Robinson 2000, p. 396)</p>

<p>The analysis of Judaism carried out by the <em>Wissenschaft</em> school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem:</p>
<ul>
<li>It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism.</li>
<li>It did not consider the proper <em>foundations</em> of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem's view, made the religion a living thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of <a class="uri" href="Halakha" title="wikilink">Halakha</a>, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be <a href="Martin_Buber" title="wikilink">Martin Buber</a>'s personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the <a href="land_of_Israel" title="wikilink">land of Israel</a>.</p>

<p>In the <em><a class="uri" href="Weltanschauung" title="wikilink">Weltanschauung</a></em> of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the <em>Gegengeschichte</em> of <a href="Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="wikilink">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> he ended up including less normative aspects of the Judaism in the public history.</p>

<p>Specifically, Scholem thought that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the <a href="Hebrew_Bible" title="wikilink">Biblical</a> period, <a class="uri" href="monotheism" title="wikilink">monotheism</a> battles <a href="mythology" title="wikilink">myth</a>, without completely defeating it.</li>
<li>During the <a href="Talmud" title="wikilink">Talmudic</a> period, some of the institutions—for example, the notion of the <a href="magic_(paranormal)" title="wikilink">magical</a> power of the accomplishment of the Sacraments—are removed in favour of the purer concept of the divine <a href="transcendence_(religion)" title="wikilink">transcendence</a>.</li>
<li>During the medieval period, the impossibility of reconciling the abstract concept of God of <a href="Greek_philosophy" title="wikilink">Greek philosophy</a> with the personal <a href="Names_of_God_in_Judaism" title="wikilink">God</a> of the Bible, led Jewish thinkers, such as <a class="uri" href="Maimonides" title="wikilink">Maimonides</a>, to try to eliminate the remaining myths and to modify the figure of the living God. After this time, mysticism, as an effort to find again the essence of the God of their fathers, became more widespread.</li>
</ul>

<p>The notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as <a href="Sabbateans" title="wikilink">Sabbatianism</a>, was developed from the <a href="Lurianic_Kabbalah" title="wikilink">Lurianic Kabbalah</a>. In order to neutralize Sabbatianism, <a href="Hasidic_Judaism" title="wikilink">Hasidism</a> had emerged as a <a href="Hegelian_dialectic" title="wikilink">Hegelian synthesis</a>. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an <a href="Orthodox_Judaism" title="wikilink">Orthodox</a> congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement.</p>

<p>In the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism.</p>

<p>The historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to <a href="Walter_Benjamin" title="wikilink">Walter Benjamin</a>, he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation.</p>
<h2 id="debate-with-hannah-arendt">Debate with Hannah Arendt</h2>

<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="Adolf_Eichmann" title="wikilink">Eichmann</a> trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised <a href="Hannah_Arendt" title="wikilink">Hannah Arendt</a>'s book, <em><a href="Eichmann_in_Jerusalem:_A_Report_on_the_Banality_of_Evil" title="wikilink">Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil</a></em> and decried her lack of "ahavath Yisrael" (solidarity with the Jewish people). Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she doesn't love the Jewish People but was only part of them. Due to this bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, Scholem broke off ties with Arendt and refused to forgive her. Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he "knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half-communist and...when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.”</p>

<p>Various other Israeli and Jewish academics also broke off ties with Arendt, claiming that her lack of solidarity with the Jewish People in their time of need was appalling, along with her victimization of various Nazis. Pre-Eichmann trial, Scholem also opposed Arendt's interpretation (in letters and the introduction to <em>Illuminations</em>) of Walter Benjamin as a Marxist thinker who predated the New Left. For Scholem, Benjamin had been an essentially religious thinker, whose turn to Marxism had been merely an unfortunate, but inessential and superficial, expedient.</p>
<h2 id="literary-influence">Literary influence</h2>

<p> Various stories and essays of the Argentinian writer <a href="Jorge_Luis_Borges" title="wikilink">Jorge Luis Borges</a> were inspired or influenced by Scholem's books.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> He has also influenced ideas of <a href="Umberto_Eco" title="wikilink">Umberto Eco</a>, <a href="Jacques_Derrida" title="wikilink">Jacques Derrida</a>, <a href="Harold_Bloom" title="wikilink">Harold Bloom</a>, Italian philosopher <a href="Giorgio_Agamben" title="wikilink">Giorgio Agamben</a>, and <a href="George_Steiner" title="wikilink">George Steiner</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> American author <a href="Michael_Chabon" title="wikilink">Michael Chabon</a> cites Scholem's essay, <em>The Idea of the Golem</em>, as having assisted him in conceiving the Pulitzer-Prize winning book <em><a href="The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_and_Clay" title="wikilink">The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
