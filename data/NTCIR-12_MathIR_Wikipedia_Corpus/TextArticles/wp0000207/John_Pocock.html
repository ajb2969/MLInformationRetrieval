<p>Pocock obtained a commission in a regiment of foot in June 1695, and having signalized himself in the wars of Queen Anne, he was promoted to the rank of <a href="colonel_(British_Army)" title="wikilink">colonel</a> in the Army in 1707. In 1710 he succeeded <a href="William_Sutherland,_Lord_Strathnaver" title="wikilink">Lord Strathnaver</a> in the colonelcy of a regiment of foot, with which he served in Flanders under <a href="John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough" title="wikilink">the Duke of Marlborough</a>, and afterwards under <a href="James_Butler,_2nd_Duke_of_Ormonde" title="wikilink">the Duke of Ormonde</a>. At the <a href="Peace_of_Utrecht" title="wikilink">Peace of Utrecht</a> his regiment was disbanded, but in 1715 he was commissioned to raise a regiment of foot for the service of King George I.

On 2 December 1720 Pocock was appointed to the colonelcy of the <a href="36th_Regiment_of_Foot" title="wikilink">36th Regiment of Foot</a>, from which he was removed on 21 April 1721 to the <a href="8th_Regiment_of_Foot" title="wikilink">8th, or King's Regiment</a>. On the expectation that Great Britain would become involved in <a href="Anglo-Spanish_War_(1727–1729)" title="wikilink">a continental war</a>, in 1727, he was promoted to the rank of <a class="uri" href="brigadier-general" title="wikilink">brigadier-general</a>.
