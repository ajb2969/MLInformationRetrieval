He was an MP from 1969 to 1996, representing the <a href="New_Zealand_Labour_Party" title="wikilink">Labour Party</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> He served as <a href="Minister_of_Māori_Affairs" title="wikilink">Minister of Māori Affairs</a> in the <a href="Fourth_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand" title="wikilink">Fourth Labour Government</a> (1984–1990).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He is a member of the <a href="Ngāti_Maniapoto" title="wikilink">Ngāti Maniapoto</a> tribe.</p>

<p>He was first elected to Parliament in the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1969" title="wikilink">1969 election</a> as MP for the <a href="Western_Maori" title="wikilink">Western Maori</a> electorate, one of the four <a href="Māori_electorates" title="wikilink">Māori electorates</a> in New Zealand's House of Representatives. Given Labour's traditional dominance in the Māori electorates, Wētere held his position without difficulty until his retirement at the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1996" title="wikilink">1996 election</a>.</p>

<p>Wētere became <a href="Minister_of_Māori_Affairs" title="wikilink">Minister of Māori Affairs</a> when the Labour Party won the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1984" title="wikilink">1984 elections</a>.</p>

<p>Wētere was criticised during the <a href="Māori_loan_affair" title="wikilink">Māori loan affair</a> of 1985-86, and was nearly asked to resign. Tamati Reedy the head of Wētere's department <a href="Te_Puni_Kokiri" title="wikilink">Te Puni Kokiri</a> attempted to arrange an unauthorised overseas loan for Māori businesses. Wētere was the subject of strong attacks over the issue by <a href="New_Zealand_National_Party" title="wikilink">National Party</a> MP <a href="Winston_Peters" title="wikilink">Winston Peters</a>, but denied any wrongdoing. When Labour lost power in the <a href="New_Zealand_general_election,_1990" title="wikilink">1990 elections</a>, Wētere returned to opposition for two terms before retiring from politics. Wētere was regarded as strongly belonging to the right wing of the Labour caucus, and was a strong ideological ally of <a href="Roger_Douglas" title="wikilink">Roger Douglas</a>.</p>

<p>In 1990 Wētere refused to translate his addresses to parliament into English, having given them in <a href="Māori_language" title="wikilink">Māori</a>. This was one of a number of steps which pushed the issue of the use of Māori in public life during this time. There are now arrangements for <a href="simultaneous_interpretation" title="wikilink">simultaneous interpretation</a> between English and Māori in Parliament.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
