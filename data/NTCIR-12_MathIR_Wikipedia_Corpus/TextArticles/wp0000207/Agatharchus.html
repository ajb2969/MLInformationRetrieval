<h1>Agatharchus</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Agatharchus</strong> or <strong>Agatharch</strong> (<a href="Ancient_Greek" title="wikilink">Ancient Greek</a>: Ἀγάθαρχος) was a self-taught painter from <a class="uri" href="Samos" title="wikilink">Samos</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> who lived in the 5th century BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> He is said by <a class="uri" href="Vitruvius" title="wikilink">Vitruvius</a> to have invented scene-painting, and to have painted a scene (<em>scenam fecit</em>) for a tragedy which <a class="uri" href="Aeschylus" title="wikilink">Aeschylus</a> exhibited.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Hence some writers, such as <a href="Karl_Woermann" title="wikilink">Karl Woermann</a>, have supposed that he introduced perspective and illusion into painting.</p>
<p>However, as this appears to contradict <a class="uri" href="Aristotle" title="wikilink">Aristotle</a>'s assertion that scene-painting was introduced by Sophocles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> some scholars understand Vitruvius to mean merely that Agatharchus constructed a stage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> But the context shows clearly that <a href="Perspective_(graphical)" title="wikilink">perspective</a> painting must be meant, for Vitruvius goes on to say that <a class="uri" href="Democritus" title="wikilink">Democritus</a> and <a class="uri" href="Anaxagoras" title="wikilink">Anaxagoras</a>, carrying out the principles laid down in a treatise written by Agatharchus,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> wrote on the same subject, showing how, in drawing, the lines ought to be made to correspond, according to a natural proportion, to the figure which would be traced out on an imaginary intervening plane by a pencil of rays proceeding from the eye, as a fixed point of sight, to the several points of the object viewed.</p>
<p>It was probably not till towards the end of Aeschylus's career that scene-painting was introduced, and not till the time of Sophocles that it was generally made use of; which may account for what Aristotle says.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Agatharchus was therefore the first painter known to have used graphical perspective on a large scale, although rare occurrences of perspective do appear in vase painting around the middle of the 6th century BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> He is also said to have led the way for later painters, such as <a href="Apollodorus_(painter)" title="wikilink">Apollodorus</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>He was a contemporary of <a class="uri" href="Alcibiades" title="wikilink">Alcibiades</a> and <a href="Zeuxis_and_Parrhasius" title="wikilink">Zeuxis</a>, and was often singled out for the ease and rapidity with which he finished his works.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Plutarch" title="wikilink">Plutarch</a> and <a class="uri" href="Andocides" title="wikilink">Andocides</a> at greater length tell an anecdote of Alcibiades having inveigled Agatharchus to his house and kept him there for more than three months in strict durance, compelling him to paint it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The speech of Andocides above referred to seems to have been delivered after the destruction of <a href="Milos" title="wikilink">Melos</a> (416 BC) and before the expedition to Sicily (415 BC); so that from the above data the age of Agatharchus may be accurately fixed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
