   Succinylglutamate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase      Succinylglutamate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a succinylglutamate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-succinyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-succinyl-L-glutamate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N-succinyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are N-succinyl-L-glutamate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-succinyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include succinylglutamic semialdehyde dehydrogenase , N-succinylglutamate 5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase , SGSD , AruD , and AstD . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism.  References           "  Category:EC 1.2.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
