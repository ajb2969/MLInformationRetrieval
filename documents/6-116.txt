   Wiswesser's rule      Wiswesser's rule   The Wiswesser rule gives a simple method to determine the energetic sequence of the atomic subshells (n,l). n is the principal quantum number and l is the azimuthal quantum number . The energetic sequence of the subshells characterized by the quantum numbers (n,l) is the sequence that leads to a monotonous increasing row of function values for the Wiswesser-function.       W   (  n  ,  l  )    =    n  +  l   -   (   l   l  +  1    )          W   n  l        n  l     l    l  1       W(n,l)=n+l-\left(\frac{l}{l+1}\right)     For example: if n=2 and l=1, this correspondents with an 2p- orbital .  If the results of this function for each shell and subshell are ordered, the resulting sequence is: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p...  To illustrate this, the corresponding values of each of these shells can be found in the table below:         n   n   n         l   l   l          W   (  n  ,  l  )       W   n  l     W(n,l)          1   1   1.5     2   1   2.5     2   2   3.33     3   1   3.5     3   2   4.33     4   1   4.5     3   3   5.25     4   2   5.33     5   1   5.5     4   3   6.25     5   2   6.33     6   1   6.5     4   4   7.2     5   3   7.25     6   2   7.33     7   1   7.5     5   4   8.2     6   3   8.25     7   2   8.33     We can now clearly see that the Aufbau principle and Wiswesser's Rule come to the same order of filling electron shells .
