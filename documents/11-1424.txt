   Adenosylcobinamide kinase      Adenosylcobinamide kinase   In enzymology , an adenosylcobinamide kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   RTP + adenosylcobinamide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosylcobinamide phosphate + RDP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are RTP and adenosylcobinamide , whereas its two products are adenosylcobinamide phosphate and RDP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is RTP:adenosylcobinamide phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include CobU , adenosylcobinamide kinase/adenosylcobinamide-phosphate , guanylyltransferase , and AdoCbi kinase/AdoCbi-phosphate guanylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
