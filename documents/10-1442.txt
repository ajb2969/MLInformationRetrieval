   Alanopine dehydrogenase      Alanopine dehydrogenase   Alanopine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,2'-iminodipropanoate + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-alanine + pyruvate + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2,2'-iminodipropanoate , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide +, and water , whereas its 4 products are L-alanine , pyruvate , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , and hydrogen ion .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,2'-iminodipropanoate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (L-alanine-forming) . Other names in common use include ALPDH , alanopine[meso-N-(1-carboxyethyl)-alanine]dehydrogenase , meso-N-(1-carboxyethyl)-alanine:NAD+ oxidoreductase , alanopine: NAD+ oxidoreductase , ADH , and alanopine:NAD+ oxidoreductase .
