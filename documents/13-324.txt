   Slowly varying envelope approximation      Slowly varying envelope approximation   In physics , the slowly varying envelope approximation ( SVEA ) is the assumption that the envelope of a forward-travelling wave pulse varies slowly in time and space compared to a period or wavelength . This requires the spectrum of the signal to be narrow-banded —hence it also referred to as the narrow-band approximation .  The slowly varying envelope approximation is often used because the resulting equations are in many cases easier to solve than the original equations, reducing the order of—all or some of—the highest-order partial derivatives . But the validity of the assumptions which are made need to be justified.  Example  For example, consider the electromagnetic wave equation :         ∇  2   E   -     μ  0      ε  0       ∂  2   E    ∂   t  2       =  0.          superscript  normal-∇  2   E      subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0       superscript   2   E      superscript  t  2       0.    \nabla^{2}E-\mu_{0}\,\varepsilon_{0}\,\frac{\partial^{2}E}{\partial t^{2}}=0.     If k 0 and ω 0 are the wave number and angular frequency of the (characteristic) carrier wave for the signal E ( r , t ), the following representation is useful:        E   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =   ℜ   {    E  0    (  𝐫  ,  t  )    e    i    (      𝐤  0    ⋅  𝐫   -     ω  0    t    )      }     ,        E   𝐫  t         subscript  E  0    𝐫  t    superscript  e    i     normal-⋅   subscript  𝐤  0   𝐫      subscript  ω  0   t          E(\mathbf{r},t)=\Re\left\{E_{0}(\mathbf{r},t)\,e^{i\,(\mathbf{k}_{0}\,\cdot\,%
 \mathbf{r}-\omega_{0}\,t)}\right\},     where    ℜ   {  ⋅  }       normal-⋅    \scriptstyle\Re\{\cdot\}   denotes the real part of the quantity between brackets.  In the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) it is assumed that the complex amplitude  E 0 ( r , t ) only varies slowly with r and t . This inherently implies that E 0 ( r , t ) represents waves propagating forward, predominantly in the k 0 direction. As a result of the slow variation of E 0 ( r , t ), when taking derivatives, the highest-order derivatives may be neglected: 1       |     ∂  2    E  0     ∂   k  o    2     |   ≪   |     k  0      ∂   E  0     ∂   k  o      |      much-less-than        superscript   2    subscript  E  0       superscript   subscript  k  o   2           subscript  k  0        subscript  E  0       subscript  k  o         \displaystyle\left|\frac{\partial^{2}E_{0}}{\partial{k_{o}}^{2}}\right|\ll%

Full approximation  Consequently, the wave equation is approximated in the SVEA as:           2    i     𝐤  0     ⋅   ∇   E  0     +    2    i     ω  0      μ  0      ε  0      ∂   E  0     ∂  t      -    (    k  0  2   -     ω  0  2      μ  0     ε  0     )    E  0     =  0.           normal-⋅    2  i   subscript  𝐤  0     normal-∇   subscript  E  0       2  i   subscript  ω  0    subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0        subscript  E  0      t           superscript   subscript  k  0   2      superscript   subscript  ω  0   2    subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0      subscript  E  0     0.    2\,i\,\mathbf{k}_{0}\,\cdot\nabla E_{0}+2\,i\,\omega_{0}\,\mu_{0}\,\varepsilon%

It is convenient to choose k 0 and ω 0 such that they satisfy the dispersion relation :        k  0  2   -     ω  0  2      μ  0     ε  0     =   0.          superscript   subscript  k  0   2      superscript   subscript  ω  0   2    subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0     0.    k_{0}^{2}-\omega_{0}^{2}\,\mu_{0}\,\varepsilon_{0}=0.\,     This gives the following approximation to the wave equation, as a result of the slowly varying envelope approximation:         𝐤  0   ⋅   ∇   E  0     +     ω  0      μ  0      ε  0      ∂   E  0     ∂  t      =  0.         normal-⋅   subscript  𝐤  0    normal-∇   subscript  E  0        subscript  ω  0    subscript  μ  0    subscript  ε  0        subscript  E  0      t      0.    \mathbf{k}_{0}\cdot\nabla E_{0}+\omega_{0}\,\mu_{0}\,\varepsilon_{0}\,\frac{%
 \partial E_{0}}{\partial t}=0.     Which is a hyperbolic partial differential equation , like the original wave equation, but now of first-order instead of second-order. And valid for coherent forward-propagating waves in directions near the k 0 -direction.  Parabolic approximation  Assume wave propagation is dominantly in the z -direction, and k 0 is taken in this direction. The SVEA is only applied to the second-order spatial derivatives in the z -direction and time.

 \frac{\partial E_{0}}{\partial t}-\tfrac{1}{2}\,i\,\Delta_{\perp}E_{0}=0.     This is a parabolic partial differential equation . This equation has enhanced validity as compared to the full SVEA: it can represents waves propagating in directions significantly different from the z -direction.
