   Proof that e is irrational      Proof that e is irrational   The number e was introduced by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683. More than half a century later, Euler , who had been a student of Jacob's younger brother Johann , proved that e is irrational , that is, that it can not be expressed as the quotient of two integers.  Euler's proof  Euler wrote the first proof of the fact that e is irrational in 1737 (but the text was only published seven years later). 1 2 3 He computed the representation of e as a simple continued fraction , which is       e  =   [  2  ;  1  ,  2  ,  1  ,  1  ,  4  ,  1  ,  1  ,  6  ,  1  ,  1  ,  8  ,  1  ,  1  ,  …  ,   2  n   ,  1  ,  1  ,  …  ]    .      e   2  1  2  1  1  4  1  1  6  1  1  8  1  1  normal-…    2  n   1  1  normal-…     e=[2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8,1,1,\ldots,2n,1,1,\ldots].\,   Since this continued fraction is infinite and rational numbers can't be written as infinite continued fractions, e is irrational. A short proof of the previous equality is known. 4 Since the simple continued fraction of e is not periodic , this also proves that e is not a root of second degree polynomial with rational coefficients; in particular, e 2 is irrational.  Fourier's proof  The most well-known proof is Joseph Fourier 's proof by contradiction , 5 which is based upon the equality      e  =   ∑   n  =  0   ∞    1   n  !    ⋅     fragments  e    superscript   subscript     n  0        1    n    normal-⋅    e=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\cdot     Initially e is assumed to be a rational number of the form a ⁄ b . Note that b couldn't be equal to one as e is not an integer. It can be shown using the above equality that e is strictly between 2 and 3.         1  1    +    1  1     <  e  =     1  1    +    1  1    +    1   1  ⋅  2     +    1   1  ⋅  2  ⋅  3     +  …   <     1  1    +    1  1    +    1   1  ⋅  2     +    1   1  ⋅  2  ⋅  2     +  …   =  3            1  1     1  1    e           1  1     1  1     1   normal-⋅  1  2      1   normal-⋅  1  2  3    normal-…            1  1     1  1     1   normal-⋅  1  2      1   normal-⋅  1  2  2    normal-…        3     \frac{1}{1}\ +\frac{1}{1}\     We then analyze a blown-up difference x of the series representing e and its strictly smaller partial sum, which approximates the limiting value e . By choosing the magnifying factor to be the factorial of b , the fraction a ⁄ b and the partial sum are turned into integers, hence x must be a positive integer. However, the fast convergence of the series representation implies that the magnified approximation error x is still strictly smaller than 1. From this contradiction we deduce that e is irrational.  Suppose that e is a rational number . Then there exist positive integers a and b such that e = a ⁄ b . Define the number      x  =    b  !    (   e  -    ∑   n  =  0   b    1   n  !      )        x      b     e    superscript   subscript     n  0    b     1    n         x=b!\,\biggl(e-\sum_{n=0}^{b}\frac{1}{n!}\biggr)\!     To see that if e is rational, then x is an integer, substitute e = a ⁄ b into this definition to obtain       x  =    b  !    (    a  b   -    ∑   n  =  0   b    1   n  !      )    =    a    (   b  -  1   )   !    -    ∑   n  =  0   b      b  !    n  !        .        x      b       a  b     superscript   subscript     n  0    b     1    n                a      b  1       superscript   subscript     n  0    b       b     n         x=b!\,\biggl(\frac{a}{b}-\sum_{n=0}^{b}\frac{1}{n!}\biggr)=a(b-1)!-\sum_{n=0}^%
 {b}\frac{b!}{n!}\,.     The first term is an integer, and every fraction in the sum is actually an integer because n ≤ b for each term. Therefore x is an integer.  We now prove that . First, to prove that x is strictly positive, we insert the above series representation of e into the definition of x and obtain       x  =    b  !    (     ∑   n  =  0   ∞    1   n  !     -    ∑   n  =  0   b    1   n  !      )    =    ∑   n  =   b  +  1    ∞     b  !    n  !     >   0    ,        x      b       superscript   subscript     n  0        1    n       superscript   subscript     n  0    b     1    n              superscript   subscript     n    b  1           b     n          0     x=b!\,\biggl(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}-\sum_{n=0}^{b}\frac{1}{n!}\biggr)%
 =\sum_{n=b+1}^{\infty}\frac{b!}{n!}>0\,,\!     because all the terms are strictly positive.  We now prove that x \frac{b!}{n!}  \frac1{(b+1)(b+2)\cdots(b+(n-b))}  This inequality is strict for every n ≥ b + 2. Changing the index of summation to k    n – b and using the formula for the infinite geometric series , we obtain      x  =    ∑   n  =   b  +  1    ∞     b  !    n  !     <    ∑   n  =   b  +  1    ∞    1    (   b  +  1   )    n  -  b      =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞    1    (   b  +  1   )   k     =    1   b  +  1     (   1   1  -   1   b  +  1      )    =   1  b   <  1.        x    superscript   subscript     n    b  1           b     n            superscript   subscript     n    b  1         1   superscript    b  1     n  b             superscript   subscript     k  1        1   superscript    b  1   k              1    b  1      1    1    1    b  1              1  b        1.     x=\sum_{n=b+1}^{\infty}\frac{b!}{n!}<\sum_{n=b+1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(b+1)^{n-b}%
 }=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(b+1)^{k}}=\frac{1}{b+1}\biggl(\frac{1}{1-\frac{%
 1}{b+1}}\biggr)=\frac{1}{b}<1.     Since there is no integer strictly between 0 and 1, we have reached a contradiction, and so e must be irrational. Q.E.D.  Alternate proofs  Another proof 6 can be obtained from the previous one by noting that         (   b  +  1   )   x   =   1  +   1   b  +  2    +   1    (   b  +  2   )    (   b  +  3   )     +  ⋯   <   1  +   1   b  +  1    +   1    (   b  +  1   )    (   b  +  2   )     +  ⋯   =   1  +  x    ,            b  1   x     1    1    b  2      1      b  2     b  3     normal-⋯          1    1    b  1      1      b  1     b  2     normal-⋯          1  x      (b+1)x=1+\frac{1}{b+2}+\frac{1}{(b+2)(b+3)}+\cdots<1+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{(b%
 +1)(b+2)}+\cdots=1+x,   and this inequality is equivalent to the assertion that bx can be obtained from the fact that       1  e   =   e   -  1    =   ∑   n  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   n    n  !    ⋅     fragments    1  e     superscript  e    1      superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript    1   n     n    normal-⋅    \frac{1}{e}=e^{-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!}\cdot     Generalizations  In 1840, Liouville published a proof of the fact that e 2 is irrational 7 followed by a proof that e 2 is not a root of a second degree polynomial with rational coefficients. 8 This last fact implies that e 4 is irrational. His proofs are similar to Fourier's proof of the irrationality of e . In 1891, Hurwitz explained how it is possible to prove along the same line of ideas that e is not a root of a third degree polynomial with rational coefficients. 9 In particular, e 3 is irrational.  More generally, e q is irrational for any non-zero rational q . 10  See also   Characterizations of the exponential function  Transcendental number , including a proof that e is transcendental  Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem   References    "  Category:Diophantine approximation  Category:Exponentials  Category:Article proofs  Category:E (mathematical constant)  Category:Real transcendental numbers  Category:Irrational numbers     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  . ↩
