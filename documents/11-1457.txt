Choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase




Choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase

Choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CTP + choline phosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + CDP-choline
 

where the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and choline phosphate, and the two products are diphosphate and CDP-choline. It is responsible for regulating phosphatidylcholine content in membranes.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. Other names in common use include phosphorylcholine transferase, CDP-choline pyrophosphorylase, CDP-choline synthetase, choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase, CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, CTP:phosphorylcholine cytidylyltransferase, cytidine diphosphocholine pyrophosphorylase, phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, phosphorylcholine cytidylyltransferase, and phosphorylcholine:CTP cytidylyltransferase. This enzyme participates in aminophosphonate metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism.
Structural studies
