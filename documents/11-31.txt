   4-hydroxybenzoate—CoA ligase      4-hydroxybenzoate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxybenzoate—CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 4-hydroxybenzoate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , 4-hydroxybenzoate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxybenzoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include 4-hydroxybenzoate-CoA synthetase , 4-hydroxybenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (AMP-forming) , 4-hydroxybenzoyl coenzyme A synthetase , and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA ligase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation .  References     "  Category:EC 6.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
