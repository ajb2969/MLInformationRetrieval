Order of integration

Order of integration, denoted I(d), is a summary statistic for a time series. It reports the minimum number of differences required to obtain a covariance stationary series.
Integration of order zero
A time series is integrated of order 0 if it admits a moving average representation with



where 
 
 
 
  is the possibly infinite vector of moving average weights (coefficients or parameters). This implies that the autocovariance is decaying to 0 sufficiently quickly. This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for a stationary process. Therefore, all stationary processes are I(0), but not all I(0) processes are stationary.
Integration of order d
A time series is integrated of order d if



is integrated of order 0, where 
 
 
 
 
  is the lag operator and 
 
 
 
  is the first difference, i.e.



In other words, a process is integrated to order d if taking repeated differences d times yields a stationary process.
Constructing an integrated series
An I(d) process can be constructed by summing an I(d − 1) process:

Suppose 
 
 
 
  is I(d − 1)
Now construct a series 
 
 



Show that Z is I(d) by observing its first-differences are I(d − 1):
