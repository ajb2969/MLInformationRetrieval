   Order of integration      Order of integration   Order of integration , denoted I ( d ), is a summary statistic for a time series . It reports the minimum number of differences required to obtain a covariance stationary series .  Integration of order zero  A time series is integrated of order 0 if it admits a moving average representation with         ∑   k  =  0   ∞    ∣   b  k    2   ∣    <  ∞   ,        superscript   subscript     k  0       delimited-∣∣   superscript   subscript  b  k   2        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mid{b_{k}}^{2}\mid<\infty,     where   b   b   b   is the possibly infinite vector of moving average weights (coefficients or parameters). This implies that the autocovariance is decaying to 0 sufficiently quickly. This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for a stationary process . Therefore, all stationary processes are I(0), but not all I(0) processes are stationary.  Integration of order d  A time series is integrated of order d if        (   1  -  L   )   d    X  t        superscript    1  L   d    subscript  X  t     (1-L)^{d}X_{t}     is integrated of order 0, where   L   L   L   is the lag operator and    1  -  L      1  L    1-L   is the first difference, i.e.         (   1  -  L   )    X  t    =    X  t   -   X   t  -  1     =   Δ  X    .            1  L    subscript  X  t       subscript  X  t    subscript  X    t  1            normal-Δ  X      (1-L)X_{t}=X_{t}-X_{t-1}=\Delta X.     In other words, a process is integrated to order d if taking repeated differences d times yields a stationary process.  Constructing an integrated series  An I ( d ) process can be constructed by summing an I ( d − 1) process:   Suppose    X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   is I ( d − 1)  Now construct a series     Z  t   =    ∑   k  =  0   t    X  k         subscript  Z  t     superscript   subscript     k  0    t    subscript  X  k      Z_{t}=\sum_{k=0}^{t}X_{k}       Show that Z is I ( d ) by observing its first-differences are I ( d − 1):           △   Z  t    =   X  t    ,        normal-△   subscript  Z  t     subscript  X  t     \triangle Z_{t}=X_{t},         where           X  t   ∼   I   (   d  -  1   )     .     similar-to   subscript  X  t     I    d  1      X_{t}\sim I(d-1).\,        See also   ARIMA  ARMA  Random walk   References   Hamilton, James D.
