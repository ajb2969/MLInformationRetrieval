Glycerol-3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase

Glycerol-3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase (, sn-2-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol 3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate 
 
 
 
  CoA + a 2-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate
 

This membrane-associated enzyme is required for suberin or cutin synthesis in plants.
