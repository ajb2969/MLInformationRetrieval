   Progressively measurable process      Progressively measurable process   In mathematics , progressive measurability is a property in the theory of stochastic processes . A progressively measurable process, while defined quite technically, is important because it implies the stopped process is measurable . Being progressively measurable is a strictly stronger property than the notion of being an adapted process . 1 Progressively measurable processes are important in the theory of Itō integrals .  Definition  Let       (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  ℙ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  ℙ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   be a probability space ;      (  𝕏  ,  𝒜  )     𝕏  𝒜    (\mathbb{X},\mathcal{A})   be a measurable space , the state space ;      {   ℱ  t   ∣   t  ≥  0   }     conditional-set   subscript  ℱ  t     t  0     \{\mathcal{F}_{t}\mid t\geq 0\}   be a filtration of the sigma algebra    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   ;      X  :     [  0  ,  ∞  )   ×  Ω   →  𝕏      normal-:  X   normal-→     0    normal-Ω   𝕏     X:[0,\infty)\times\Omega\to\mathbb{X}   be a stochastic process (the index set could be    [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   or    ℕ  0     subscript  ℕ  0    \mathbb{N}_{0}   instead of    [  0  ,  ∞  )     0     [0,\infty)   ).   The process   X   X   X   is said to be progressively measurable 2 (or simply progressive ) if, for every time   t   t   t   , the map      [  0  ,  t  ]   ×  Ω   →  𝕏     normal-→     0  t   normal-Ω   𝕏    [0,t]\times\Omega\to\mathbb{X}   defined by     (  s  ,  ω  )   ↦    X  s    (  ω  )       maps-to   s  ω      subscript  X  s   ω     (s,\omega)\mapsto X_{s}(\omega)   is     Borel   (   [  0  ,  t  ]   )    ⊗   ℱ  t      tensor-product    Borel   0  t     subscript  ℱ  t     \mathrm{Borel}([0,t])\otimes\mathcal{F}_{t}   - measurable . This implies that   X   X   X   is    ℱ  t     subscript  ℱ  t    \mathcal{F}_{t}   -adapted. 3  A subset    P  ⊆    [  0  ,  ∞  )   ×  Ω       P     0    normal-Ω     P\subseteq[0,\infty)\times\Omega   is said to be progressively measurable if the process      X  s    (  ω  )    :=    χ  P    (  s  ,  ω  )       assign     subscript  X  s   ω      subscript  χ  P    s  ω      X_{s}(\omega):=\chi_{P}(s,\omega)   is progressively measurable in the sense defined above, where    χ  P     subscript  χ  P    \chi_{P}   is the indicator function of   P   P   P   . The set of all such subsets   P   P   P   form a sigma algebra on     [  0  ,  ∞  )   ×  Ω       0    normal-Ω    [0,\infty)\times\Omega   , denoted by   Prog   Prog   \mathrm{Prog}   , and a process   X   X   X   is progressively measurable in the sense of the previous paragraph if, and only if, it is   Prog   Prog   \mathrm{Prog}   -measurable.  Properties   It can be shown 4 that     L  2    (  B  )        superscript  L  2   B    L^{2}(B)   , the space of stochastic processes    X  :     [  0  ,  T  ]   ×  Ω   →   ℝ  n       normal-:  X   normal-→     0  T   normal-Ω    superscript  ℝ  n      X:[0,T]\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   for which the Ito integral          ∫  0  T      X  t    d   B  t        superscript   subscript   0   T      subscript  X  t   normal-d   subscript  B  t      \int_{0}^{T}X_{t}\,\mathrm{d}B_{t}       with respect to Brownian motion    B   B   B   is defined, is the set of equivalence classes of   Prog   Prog   \mathrm{Prog}   -measurable processes in     L  2    (    [  0  ,  T  ]   ×  Ω   ;   ℝ  n   )        superscript  L  2       0  T   normal-Ω    superscript  ℝ  n      L^{2}([0,T]\times\Omega;\mathbb{R}^{n})\,   .    Every adapted process with left- or right-continuous paths is progressively measurable. Consequently, every adapted process with càdlàg paths is progressively measurable. 5  Every measurable and adapted process has a progressively measurable modification. 6   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes  Category:Measure theory     ↩  Pascucci, Andrea (2011) PDE and Martingale Methods in Option Pricing .
