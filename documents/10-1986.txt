Methionine decarboxylase

In enzymology, a methionine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-methionine 
 
 
 
  3-methylthiopropanamine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-methionine, and two products, 3-methylthiopropanamine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-methionine carboxy-lyase (3-methylthiopropanamine-forming). Other names in common use include L-methionine decarboxylase, and L-methionine carboxy-lyase.
