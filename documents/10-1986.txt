   Methionine decarboxylase      Methionine decarboxylase   In enzymology , a methionine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-methionine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methylthiopropanamine + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-methionine , and two products , 3-methylthiopropanamine and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-methionine carboxy-lyase (3-methylthiopropanamine-forming) . Other names in common use include L-methionine decarboxylase , and L-methionine carboxy-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
