Guanine-transporting ATPase




Guanine-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a guanine-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + guanineout 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + guaninein
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and guanine, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and guanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (guanine-importing).
