   Sigma-martingale      Sigma-martingale   In the mathematical theory of probability , a sigma-martingale is a semimartingale with an integral representation. Sigma-martingales were introduced by C.S. Chou and M. Emery in 1977 and 1978. 1 In financial mathematics , sigma-martingales appear in the fundamental theorem of asset pricing as an equivalent condition to no free lunch with vanishing risk (a no- arbitrage condition). 2  Mathematical definition  An    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   -valued stochastic process     X  =    (   X  t   )    t  =  0   T       X   superscript   subscript   subscript  X  t     t  0    T     X=(X_{t})_{t=0}^{T}   is a sigma-martingale if it is a semimartingale and there exists an    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   -valued martingale  M and an M - integrable  predictable process    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   with values in    ℝ  +     subscript  ℝ     \mathbb{R}_{+}   such that       X  =   ϕ  ⋅  M    .      X   normal-⋅  ϕ  M     X=\phi\cdot M.\,    3  References  "  Category:Stochastic processes  Category:Martingale theory      ↩  ↩
