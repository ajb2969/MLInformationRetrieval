   Ribbon category      Ribbon category   In mathematics , a ribbon category , also called a tortile category , is a particular type of braided monoidal category .  Definition  A monoidal category    𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is, loosely speaking, a category equipped with a notion resembling the tensor product (of vector spaces, say). That is, for any two objects      C  1   ,   C  2    ∈  𝒞        subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2    𝒞    C_{1},C_{2}\in\mathcal{C}   , there is an object      C  1   ⊗   C  2    ∈  𝒞       tensor-product   subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2    𝒞    C_{1}\otimes C_{2}\in\mathcal{C}   . The assignment      C  1   ,   C  2    ↦    C  1   ⊗   C  2       maps-to    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2     tensor-product   subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2      C_{1},C_{2}\mapsto C_{1}\otimes C_{2}   is supposed to be functorial and needs to require a number of further properties such as a unit object 1 and an associativity isomorphism . Such a category is called braided if there are isomorphisms        c    C  1   ,   C  2     :     C  1   ⊗   C  2     →  ≅     C  2   ⊗   C  1      .     normal-:   subscript  c    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2       superscript  normal-→     tensor-product   subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2     tensor-product   subscript  C  2    subscript  C  1       c_{C_{1},C_{2}}:C_{1}\otimes C_{2}\stackrel{\cong}{\rightarrow}C_{2}\otimes C_%

The former means that for each object   C   C   C   there is another object (called the dual ),    C  *     superscript  C     C^{*}   , with maps       1  →   C  ⊗   C  *     ,    C  ⊗   C  *    →  1      formulae-sequence   normal-→  1   tensor-product  C   superscript  C       normal-→   tensor-product  C   superscript  C     1     1\rightarrow C\otimes C^{*},C\otimes C^{*}\rightarrow 1   such that the compositions       C  *   ≅    C  *   ⊗  1   →    C  *   ⊗   (   C  ⊗   C  *    )    ≅    (    C  *   ⊗  C   )   ⊗   C  *    →   1  ⊗   C  *    ≅   C  *          superscript  C     tensor-product   superscript  C    1     normal-→     tensor-product   superscript  C     tensor-product  C   superscript  C            tensor-product   tensor-product   superscript  C    C    superscript  C       normal-→     tensor-product  1   superscript  C           superscript  C       C^{*}\cong C^{*}\otimes 1\rightarrow C^{*}\otimes(C\otimes C^{*})\cong(C^{*}%
 \otimes C)\otimes C^{*}\rightarrow 1\otimes C^{*}\cong C^{*}   equals the identity of    C  *     superscript  C     C^{*}   , and similarly with   C   C   C   . The twists are maps      C  ∈  𝒞      C  𝒞    C\in\mathcal{C}   ,     θ  C   :   C  →  C      normal-:   subscript  θ  C    normal-→  C  C     \theta_{C}:C\rightarrow C   such that        θ    C  1   ⊗   C  2     =    c    C  2   ,   C  1      c    C  1   ,   C  2      (    θ   C  1    ⊗   θ   C  2     )     .       subscript  θ   tensor-product   subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2        subscript  c    subscript  C  2    subscript  C  1      subscript  c    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2      tensor-product   subscript  θ   subscript  C  1     subscript  θ   subscript  C  2        \theta_{C_{1}\otimes C_{2}}=c_{C_{2},C_{1}}c_{C_{1},C_{2}}(\theta_{C_{1}}%
 \otimes\theta_{C_{2}}).   To be a ribbon category, the duals have to be compatible with the braiding and the twists in a certain way.  An example is the category of projective modules over a commutative ring . In this category, the monoidal structure is the tensor product , the dual object is the dual in the sense of (linear) algebra, which is again projective. The twists in this case are the identity maps . A more sophisticated example of a ribbon category are finite-dimensional representations of a quantum group . 1  The name ribbon category is motivated by a graphical depiction of morphisms. 2  Variant  A strongly ribbon category is a ribbon category C equipped with a dagger structure such that the functor †: C op → C coherently preserves the ribbon structure.
