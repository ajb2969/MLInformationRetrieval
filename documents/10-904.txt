Bilirubin oxidase

In enzymology, a bilirubin oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 bilirubin + O2

 
  2 biliverdin + 2 H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are bilirubin and O2, whereas its two products are biliverdin and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is bilirubin:oxygen oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called bilirubin oxidase M-1. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.12
Two structures of bilirubin oxidase from the ascomycete Myrothecium verrucaria have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes  and ).34
