HGSNAT

Heparan-α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (also called "acetyl-CoA:heparan-α-D-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase" and "acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase") is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HGSNAT gene.123
In enzymology, this enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. It is catalysed in the chemical reaction:

acetyl-CoA + heparan sulfate α-D-glucosaminide

CoA + heparan sulfate N-acetyl-α-D-glucosaminide


This enzyme participates in glycosaminoglycan degradation and glycan structures degradation. Mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme cause mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC.4
