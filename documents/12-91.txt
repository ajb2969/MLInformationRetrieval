Struve function

 In mathematics, Struve functions , are solutions 
 
 
 
  of the non-homogeneous Bessel's differential equation:



introduced by . The complex number Î± is the order of the Struve function, and is often an integer. The modified Struve functions  are equal to .
Definitions
Since this is a non-homogeneous equation, solutions can be constructed from a single particular solution by adding the solutions of the homogeneous problem. In this case, the homogeneous solutions are the Bessel functions, and the particular solution may be chosen as the corresponding Struve function.
Power series expansion
Struve functions, denoted as  have the following power series form



where 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function.
The modified Struve function, denoted as  have the following power series form



Integral form
Another definition of the Struve function, for values of 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 , is possible using an integral representation:



Asymptotic forms
For small 
 
 
 
 , the power series expansion is given above.
For large 
 
 
 
 , one obtains:



where  is the Neumann function.
Properties
The Struve functions satisfy the following recurrence relations:



Relation to other functions
Struve functions of integer order can be expressed in terms of Weber functions  and vice versa: if 
 
 
 
  is a non-negative integer then



Struve functions of order 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an integer can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. In particular if 
 
 
 
  is a non-negative integer then



where the right hand side is a spherical Bessel function.
Struve functions (of any order) can be expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function  (which is not the Gauss hypergeometric function ):
