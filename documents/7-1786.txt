Rand index

The Rand index1 or Rand measure (named after William M. Rand) in statistics, and in particular in data clustering, is a measure of the similarity between two data clusterings. A form of the Rand index may be defined that is adjusted for the chance grouping of elements, this is the adjusted Rand index. From a mathematical standpoint, Rand index is related to the accuracy, but is applicable even when class labels are not used.
Rand index
Definition
Given a set of 
 
 
elements

 
  and two partitions of 
 
 
 
  to compare, 
 
 
 
 , a partition of S into r subsets, and 
 
 
 
 , a partition of S into s subsets, define the following:



 
 , the number of pairs of elements in 
 
 
 
  that are in the same set in 
 
 
 
  and in the same set in 
 
 





 
 , the number of pairs of elements in 
 
 
 
  that are in different sets in 
 
 
 
  and in different sets in 
 
 





 
 , the number of pairs of elements in 
 
 
 
  that are in the same set in 
 
 
 
  and in different sets in 
 
 





 
 , the number of pairs of elements in 
 
 
 
  that are in different sets in 
 
 
 
  and in the same set in 
 
 


The Rand index, 
 
 
 
 , is:23


 
  Intuitively, 
 
 
 
  can be considered as the number of agreements between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as the number of disagreements between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
The Rand index has a value between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the two data clusters do not agree on any pair of points and 1 indicating that the data clusters are exactly the same.
In mathematical terms, a, b, c, d are defined as follows:

Adjusted Rand index
The adjusted Rand index is the corrected-for-chance version of the Rand index.456 Though the Rand Index may only yield a value between 0 and +1, the Adjusted Rand Index can yield negative values if the index is less than the expected index.7
The contingency table
Given a set 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  elements, and two groupings (e.g. clusterings) of these points, namely 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the overlap between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be summarized in a contingency table 
 
 
 
  where each entry 
 
 
 
  denotes the number of objects in common between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

 
 .
