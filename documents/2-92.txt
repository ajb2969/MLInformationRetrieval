   Removable singularity      Removable singularity   In complex analysis , a removable singularity of a holomorphic function is a point at which the function is undefined, but it is possible to define the function at that point in such a way that the function is regular in a neighbourhood of that point.  For instance, the (unnormalized) sinc function       sinc   (  z  )    =    sin  z   z         sinc  z       z   z     \text{sinc}(z)=\frac{\sin z}{z}     has a singularity at z = 0. This singularity can be removed by defining f (0) := 1, which is the limit of f as z tends to 0. The resulting function is holomorphic. In this case the problem was caused by f being given an indeterminate form . Taking a power series expansion for     sin   (  z  )    z        z   z    \frac{\sin(z)}{z}   shows that        sinc   (  z  )    =    1  z    (    ∑   k  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   k    z    2  k   +  1       (    2  k   +  1   )   !     )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   k    z   2  k       (    2  k   +  1   )   !     =      1  -    z  2    3  !     +    z  4    5  !     -    z  6    7  !     +  ⋯    .          sinc  z       1  z     superscript   subscript     k  0           superscript    1   k    superscript  z      2  k   1           2  k   1              superscript   subscript     k  0           superscript    1   k    superscript  z    2  k           2  k   1                   1     superscript  z  2     3        superscript  z  4     5        superscript  z  6     7     normal-⋯      \text{sinc}(z)=\frac{1}{z}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}z^{2k+1}}{(2k%
 +1)!}\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}z^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}=1-\frac{z^{2}}{%
 3!}+\frac{z^{4}}{5!}-\frac{z^{6}}{7!}+\cdots.     Formally, if    U  ⊂  ℂ      U  ℂ    U\subset\mathbb{C}   is an open subset of the complex plane    ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   ,    a  ∈  U      a  U    a\in U   a point of   U   U   U   , and    f  :    U  ∖   {  a  }    →  ℂ      normal-:  f   normal-→    U   a    ℂ     f:U\setminus\{a\}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}   is a holomorphic function , then   a   a   a   is called a removable singularity for   f   f   f   if there exists a holomorphic function    g  :   U  →  ℂ      normal-:  g   normal-→  U  ℂ     g:U\rightarrow\mathbb{C}   which coincides with   f   f   f   on    U  ∖   {  a  }       U   a     U\setminus\{a\}   . We say   f   f   f   is holomorphically extendable over   U   U   U   if such a   g   g   g   exists.  Riemann's theorem  Riemann's theorem on removable singularities states when a singularity is removable:  ' Theorem. ' Let    D  ⊂  C      D  C    D\subset C   be an open subset of the complex plane,    a  ∈  D      a  D    a\in D   a point of   D   D   D   and   f   f   f   a holomorphic function defined on the set    D  ∖   {  a  }       D   a     D\setminus\{a\}   . The following are equivalent:      f   f   f   is holomorphically extendable over   a   a   a   .     f   f   f   is continuously extendable over   a   a   a   .  There exists a neighborhood of   a   a   a   on which   f   f   f   is bounded .        lim   z  →  a      (   z  -  a   )   f   (  z  )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  z  a        z  a   f  z    0    \lim_{z\to a}(z-a)f(z)=0   .   The implications 1 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 4 are trivial. To prove 4 ⇒ 1, we first recall that the holomorphy of a function at   a   a   a   is equivalent to it being analytic at   a   a   a   ( proof ), i.e. having a power series representation. Define       h   (  z  )    =   {        (   z  -  a   )   2   f   (  z  )        z  ≠  a   ,       0      z  =  a   .             h  z    cases     superscript    z  a   2   f  z     z  a   0    z  a      h(z)=\begin{cases}(z-a)^{2}f(z)&z\neq a,\\
 0&z=a.\end{cases}     Clearly, h is holomorphic on D \ { a }, and there exists        h  ′    (  a  )    =    lim   z  →  a         (   z  -  a   )   2   f   (  z  )    -  0    z  -  a     =    lim   z  →  a      (   z  -  a   )   f   (  z  )     =  0           superscript  h  normal-′   a     subscript    normal-→  z  a           superscript    z  a   2   f  z   0     z  a            subscript    normal-→  z  a        z  a   f  z         0     h^{\prime}(a)=\lim_{z\to a}\frac{(z-a)^{2}f(z)-0}{z-a}=\lim_{z\to a}(z-a)f(z)=0   by 4, hence h is holomorphic on D and has a Taylor series about a :        h   (  z  )    =    c  0   +    c  1    (   z  -  a   )    +    c  2     (   z  -  a   )   2    +    c  3     (   z  -  a   )   3    +   ⋯     .        h  z      subscript  c  0      subscript  c  1     z  a       subscript  c  2    superscript    z  a   2       subscript  c  3    superscript    z  a   3    normal-⋯     h(z)=c_{0}+c_{1}(z-a)+c_{2}(z-a)^{2}+c_{3}(z-a)^{3}+\cdots\,.     We have c 0 = h ( a ) = 0 and c 1 = h{{'}} ( a ) = 0; therefore        h   (  z  )    =     c  2     (   z  -  a   )   2    +    c  3     (   z  -  a   )   3    +   ⋯     .        h  z        subscript  c  2    superscript    z  a   2       subscript  c  3    superscript    z  a   3    normal-⋯     h(z)=c_{2}(z-a)^{2}+c_{3}(z-a)^{3}+\cdots\,.     Hence, where z≠a, we have:        f   (  z  )    =    h   (  z  )    /    (   z  -  a   )   2    =    c  2   +    c  3    (   z  -  a   )    +   ⋯     .          f  z       h  z    superscript    z  a   2            subscript  c  2      subscript  c  3     z  a    normal-⋯      f(z)=h(z)/(z-a)^{2}=c_{2}+c_{3}(z-a)+\cdots\,.     However,        g   (  z  )    =    c  2   +    c  3    (   z  -  a   )    +   ⋯     .        g  z      subscript  c  2      subscript  c  3     z  a    normal-⋯     g(z)=c_{2}+c_{3}(z-a)+\cdots\,.     is holomorphic on D , thus an extension of f .  Other kinds of singularities  Unlike functions of a real variable, holomorphic functions are sufficiently rigid that their isolated singularities can be completely classified. A holomorphic function's singularity is either not really a singularity at all, i.e. a removable singularity, or one of the following two types:   In light of Riemann's theorem, given a non-removable singularity, one might ask whether there exists a natural number   m   m   m   such that      lim   z  →  a       (   z  -  a   )    m  +  1    f   (  z  )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  z  a       superscript    z  a     m  1    f  z    0    \lim_{z\rightarrow a}(z-a)^{m+1}f(z)=0   . If so,   a   a   a   is called a pole of   f   f   f   and the smallest such   m   m   m   is the order of   a   a   a   . So removable singularities are precisely the poles of order 0. A holomorphic function blows up uniformly near its poles.  If an isolated singularity   a   a   a   of   f   f   f   is neither removable nor a pole, it is called an essential singularity . The Great Picard Theorem shows that such an   f   f   f   maps every punctured open neighborhood    U  ∖   {  a  }       U   a     U\setminus\{a\}   to the entire complex plane, with the possible exception of at most one point.
