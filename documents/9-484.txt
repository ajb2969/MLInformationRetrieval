   Deviation (statistics)      Deviation (statistics)   In mathematics and statistics , deviation is a measure of difference between the observed value of a variable and some other value, often that variable's mean . The sign of the deviation (positive or negative), reports the direction of that difference (the deviation is positive when the observed value exceeds the reference value). The magnitude of the value indicates the size of the difference.  Types of deviation  A deviation that is a difference between an observed value and the true value of a quantity of interest (such as a population mean) is an error and a deviation that is the difference between the observed value and an estimate of the true value (such an estimate may be a sample mean) is a residual . These concepts are applicable for data at the interval and ratio levels of measurement.  Unsigned or absolute deviation  In statistics , the absolute deviation of an element of a data set is the absolute difference between that element and a given point. Typically the deviation is reckoned from the central value , being construed as some type of average , most often the median or sometimes the mean of the data set.       D  i   =   |    x  i   -   m   (  X  )     |        subscript  D  i        subscript  x  i     m  X       D_{i}=|x_{i}-m(X)|     where   D i is the absolute deviation,  x i is the data element  and m ( X ) is the chosen measure of central tendency of the data set—sometimes the mean (    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \overline{x}   ), but most often the median .   Measures of deviation  Central tendency  For an unbiased estimate, the sum of the signed deviations across the entire set of all observations from the overall sample mean is always zero, and the expected , mean , or average deviation is also zero; conversely, a nonzero average deviation quantifies the bias exhibited by the estimate.  Dispersion  Statistics of the distribution of deviations are used as measures of statistical dispersion .   Standard deviation is the frequently used measure of dispersion: it uses squared deviations, and has desirable properties, but is not robust .    Mean absolute deviation , is the sum of absolute values of the deviations divided by the number of observations.    Median absolute deviation is a robust statistic which uses the median, not the mean, of absolute deviations.    Maximum absolute deviation is a highly non-robust measure, which uses the maximum absolute deviation.   Normalization  Deviations have units of the measurement scale (for instance, meters if measuring lengths). One can nondimensionalize in two ways.  One way is by dividing by a measure of scale ( statistical dispersion ), most often either the population standard deviation, in standardizing , or the sample standard deviation, in studentizing (e.g., Studentized residual ).  One can scale instead by location, not dispersion: the formula for a percent deviation is the observed value minus accepted value divided by the accepted value multiplied by 100%.
