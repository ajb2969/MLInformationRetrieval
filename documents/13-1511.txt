Adolfas Jucys

Adolfas Jucys (12 September 1904 – 4 February 1974) was a Lithuanian theoretical physicist and mathematician, member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in 1953. He graduated from Kaunas University in 1931 and later worked with both creators of the self-consistent field method – Douglas Hartree in Manchester (in 1938) and Vladimir Fock in Leningrad (1949–1951). Adolfas Jucys created the scientific school of theoretical physics in Vilnius, was the head of the Department of Theoretical Physics at Vilnius University (1944–1971). He organized the first Institute of Physics and Mathematics in Lithuania and was its first director (1956–1963), later (1971–1974) the head of the Department of Quantum Mechanical Calculations of the Institute.12
Jucys developed the theory of the electronic structure of atoms, formulated in a general form the multiconfiguration Hartree–Fock equations taking into account the correlation effects.34 He along with his co-workers obtained the first solutions of such equations and applied them in atomic structure calculations, later introduced and developed the extended method of calculation,5 as well as using non-orthogonal radial orbitals.
Adolfas Jucys with his disciples developed the mathematical apparatus of many-electron atoms with open shells. The most known work in this field is the monograph,6 in which the original graphical method for the quantities of the angular momentum theory was presented, see angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics) for an exposition. In particular, Yutsis graphs78 (connected simple graphs which can be partitioned into two vertex-induced trees) are named after Adolfas Jucys.
Adolfas Jucys had an interest in the representation theory of Lie groups of different rank,9 but the Jucys–Murphy elements in the group algebra

 
  of the symmetric group are named after his son Algimantas Adolfas Jucys.
