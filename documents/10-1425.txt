$\rightleftharpoons$ (indol-3-yl)glycolaldehyde +  + 
 
 Thus, the 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophan,  and , whereas its 3 products are (indol-3-yl)glycolaldehyde, , and .
Classification
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O miscellaneous.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan:oxygen 2'-oxidoreductase (side-chain-cleaving). Other names in common use include indole-3-alkane alpha-hydroxylase, tryptophan side-chain alpha,beta-oxidase, tryptophan side chain oxidase II, tryptophan side-chain oxidase, TSO, indolyl-3-alkan alpha-hydroxylase, tryptophan side chain oxidase type I, TSO I, TSO II, and tryptophan side chain oxidase.
Biological role
This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism. It employs one cofactor, heme.
