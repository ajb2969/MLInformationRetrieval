Correction for attenuation

Correction for attenuation is a statistical procedure, due to Spearman (1904), to "rid a correlation coefficient from the weakening effect of measurement error" (Jensen, 1998), a phenomenon also known as regression dilution. In measurement and statistics, it is also called disattenuation. The correlation between two sets of parameters or measurements is estimated in a manner that accounts for measurement error contained within the estimates of those parameters.
Background
Correlations between parameters are diluted or weakened by measurement error. Disattenuation provides for a more accurate estimate of the correlation between the parameters by accounting for this effect.
Definition
The disattenuated estimate of the correlation between two sets of parameters or measures is therefore



That is, the disattenuated correlation is obtained by dividing the correlation between the estimates by the geometric mean of the separation indices of the two sets of estimates. Expressed in terms of Classical test theory, the correlation is divided by the geometric mean of the reliability coefficients of two tests.
Given two random variables

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with correlation

 
 , and a known reliability for each variable, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the correlation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  corrected for attenuation is 
 
 
 
 .
How well the variables are measured affects the correlation of X and Y. The correction for attenuation tells you what the correlation would be if you could measure X and Y with perfect reliability.
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are taken to be imperfect measurements of underlying variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with independent errors, then 
 
 
 
  measures the true correlation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Derivation of the formula
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the true values of two attributes of some person or statistical unit. These values are regarded as random variables by virtue of the statistical unit being selected randomly from some population. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be estimates of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  derived either directly by observation-with-error or from application of a measurement model, such as the Rasch model. Also, let






\hat{\beta} = \beta + \epsilon_{\beta} , \quad\quad \hat{\theta} = \theta + \epsilon_\theta, 
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the measurement errors associated with the estimates 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The correlation between two sets of estimates is









=\frac{\operatorname{cov}(\beta+\epsilon_{\beta}, \theta+\epsilon_\theta)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{var}[\beta+\epsilon_{\beta}]\operatorname{var}[\theta+\epsilon_\theta]}}, 
which, assuming the errors are uncorrelated with each other and with the estimates, gives









=\frac{\operatorname{cov}(\beta,\theta)}{\sqrt{(\operatorname{var}[\beta]\operatorname{var}[\theta])}}.\frac{\sqrt{\operatorname{var}[\beta]\operatorname{var}[\theta]}}{\sqrt{(\operatorname{var}[\beta]+\operatorname{var}[\epsilon_\beta])(\operatorname{var}[\theta]+\operatorname{var}[\epsilon_\theta])}} 






=\rho \sqrt{R_\beta R_\theta}, 
where 
 
 
 
  is the separation index of the set of estimates of 
 
 
 
 , which is analogous to Cronbach's alpha; that is, in terms of Classical test theory, 
 
 
 
  is analogous to a reliability coefficient. Specifically, the separation index is given as follows:



where the mean squared standard error of person estimate gives an estimate of the variance of the errors, 
 
 
 
 . The standard errors are normally produced as a by-product of the estimation process (see Rasch model estimation).
