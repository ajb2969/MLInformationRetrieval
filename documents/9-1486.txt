Binomial approximation

The binomial approximation is useful for approximately calculating powers of numbers close to 1. It states that if 
 
 
 
  is a real number close to 0 and 
 
 
 
  is a real number, then



This approximation can be obtained by using the binomial theorem and ignoring the terms beyond the first two.
The left-hand side of this relation is always greater than or equal to the right-hand side for 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a non-negative integer, by Bernoulli's inequality.
Derivation using linear approximation





 
  When x = 0:


 
  Using linear approximation:









Derivation using Mellin transform




Let 
 
 






Let 
 
 







Using the inverse Mellin transform:



Closing this integral to the left, which converges for 
 
 
 
 , we get:
