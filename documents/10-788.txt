   Kaempferol 4'-O-methyltransferase      Kaempferol 4'-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a kaempferol 4'-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + kaempferol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + kaempferide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and kaempferol , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and kaempferide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:kaempferol 4'-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include S-adenosyl-L-methionine:flavonoid 4'-O-methyltransferase , and F 4'-OMT .
