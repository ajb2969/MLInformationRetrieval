S-factor

The astrophysical S-factor

 
  is a rescaled variant of the total cross section

 
  that accounts for the Coulomb repulsion between charged reactants.
Definition
The quantity is defined as1



Here, 
 
 
 
  is the dimensionless Sommerfeld parameter,



where

 is the product of the charges of the reactants and


 
  is the magnitude of the relative incident velocity.

Motivation
The Coulomb barrier causes the cross section to have a strong exponential dependence on the center-of-mass energy 
 
 
 
 . The S-factor remedies this by factoring out the Coulomb component of the cross section.
