   S-factor      S-factor   The astrophysical  S-factor     S   (  E  )       S  E    S(E)   is a rescaled variant of the total cross section     σ   (  E  )       σ  E    σ(E)   that accounts for the Coulomb repulsion between charged reactants.  Definition  The quantity is defined as 1       S   (  E  )    ≡    E   exp   (   -   2  π  η    )     σ   (  E  )          S  E       E        2  π  η      σ  E     S(E)\equiv\frac{E}{\exp(-2\pi\eta)}\sigma(E)     Here,   η   η   η   is the dimensionless Sommerfeld parameter ,      η  ≡     Z  1    Z  2    e  2     4  π   ϵ  0   ℏ  v        η       subscript  Z  1    subscript  Z  2    superscript  e  2      4  π   subscript  ϵ  0   Planck-constant-over-2-pi  v      \eta\equiv\frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar v}     where   is the product of the charges of the reactants and     v   v   v   is the magnitude of the relative incident velocity .   Motivation  The Coulomb barrier causes the cross section to have a strong exponential dependence on the center-of-mass energy   E   E   E   . The S-factor remedies this by factoring out the Coulomb component of the cross section.  References  "    Category:Astrophysics     ↩
