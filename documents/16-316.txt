   Turning point test      Turning point test  In [[statistical hypothesis testing]], a '''turning point test''' is a statistical test of the independence of a series of random variables. {{cite book | title = Performance Evaluation Of Computer And Communication Systems | first = Jean-Yves | last = Le Boudec | isbn = 978-2-940222-40-7 | year=2010 | publisher =[[EPFL Press]]| url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/146812/files/perfPublisherVersion.pdf |pages=136-137}} {{cite doi|10.1007/b97391}} {{cite book | title = Time series | first= Maurice George | last = Ken dall | authorlink = Maurice Kendall | isbn = 0852642202 | publisher = Griffin | year = 1973}} Maurice Kendall and Alan Stuart describe the test as "reasonable for a test against cyclicity but poor as a test against trend." 1 2 The test was first published by Irénée-Jules Bienaymé in 1874. 3 4  Statement of test  The turning point tests the null hypothesis 5   H 0 : X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n are independent and identically distributed random variables (iid)   against   H 1 : X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n are not iid.   Test statistic  We say i is a turning point if the vector X 1 , X 2 , ..., X i , ..., X n is not monotonic at index i . The number of turning points is the number of maxima and minima in the series. 6  Let T be the number of turning points then for large n , T is approximately normally distributed with mean (2 n − 4)/3 and variance (16 n − 29)/90. The test statistic 7      z  =    T  -     2  n   -  4   3        16  n   -  29   90         z      T        2  n   4   3            16  n   29   90       z=\frac{T-\frac{2n-4}{3}}{\sqrt{\frac{16n-29}{90}}}     has standard normal distribution.  Applications  The test can be used to verify the accuracy of a fitted time series model such a that describing irrigation requirements. 8  References  "  Category:Statistical tests  Category:Time series analysis      ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩
