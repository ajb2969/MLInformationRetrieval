Turning point test
In [[statistical hypothesis testing]], a '''turning point test''' is a statistical test of the independence of a series of random variables.{{cite book | title = Performance Evaluation Of Computer And Communication Systems | first = Jean-Yves | last = Le Boudec | isbn = 978-2-940222-40-7 | year=2010 | publisher =[[EPFL Press]]| url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/146812/files/perfPublisherVersion.pdf |pages=136-137}}{{cite doi|10.1007/b97391}}{{cite book | title = Time series | first= Maurice George | last = Ken

Statement of test
The turning point tests the null hypothesis5

H0: X1, X2, ..., Xn are independent and identically distributed random variables (iid)
 

against

H1: X1, X2, ..., Xn are not iid.
 

Test statistic
We say i is a turning point if the vector X1, X2, ..., Xi, ..., Xn is not monotonic at index i. The number of turning points is the number of maxima and minima in the series.6
Let T be the number of turning points then for large n, T is approximately normally distributed with mean (2n − 4)/3 and variance (16n − 29)/90. The test statistic7



has standard normal distribution.
Applications
The test can be used to verify the accuracy of a fitted time series model such a that describing irrigation requirements.8
