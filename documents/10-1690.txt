   Phosphomannomutase      Phosphomannomutase   In enzymology , a phosphomannomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-mannose 6-phosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate , and one product , D-mannose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the phosphotransferases (phosphomutases), which transfer phosphate groups within a molecule. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-mannose 1,6-phosphomutase . Other names in common use include mannose phosphomutase , phosphomannose mutase , and D-mannose 1,6-phosphomutase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate , and D-Mannose 1,6-bisphosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 18 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
