   Solvency cone      Solvency cone   The solvency cone is a concept used in financial mathematics which models the possible trades in the financial market . This is of particular interest to markets with transaction costs . Specifically, it is the convex cone of portfolios that can be exchanged to portfolios of non-negative components (including paying of any transaction costs).  Mathematical basis  If given a bid-ask matrix    Π   normal-Π   \Pi   for   d   d   d   assets such that    Π  =    (   π   i  j    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  d         normal-Π   subscript   superscript  π    i  j     formulae-sequence    1  i     j  d       \Pi=\left(\pi^{ij}\right)_{1\leq i,j\leq d}   and    m  ≤  d      m  d    m\leq d   is the number of assets which with any non-negative quantity of them can be "discarded" (traditionally    m  =  d      m  d    m=d   ), then the solvency cone     K   (  Π  )    ⊂   ℝ  d         K  normal-Π    superscript  ℝ  d     K(\Pi)\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   is the convex cone spanned by the unit vectors      e  i   ,  1   ≤  i  ≤  m          superscript  e  i   1   i       m     e^{i},1\leq i\leq m   and the vectors         π   i  j     e  i    -   e  j    ,  1   ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  d      formulae-sequence          superscript  π    i  j     superscript  e  i     superscript  e  j    1   i     j  d     \pi^{ij}e^{i}-e^{j},1\leq i,j\leq d   . 1  Definition  A solvency cone   K   K   K   is any closed convex cone such that    K  ⊆   ℝ  d       K   superscript  ℝ  d     K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}   and    K  ⊇   ℝ  +  d        subscript   superscript  ℝ  d     K    K\supseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}_{+}   . 2  Uses  A process of (random) solvency cones     {    K  t    (  ω  )    }    t  =  0   T     superscript   subscript      subscript  K  t   ω      t  0    T    \left\{K_{t}(\omega)\right\}_{t=0}^{T}   is a model of a financial market. This is sometimes called a market process .  The negative of a solvency cone is the set of portfolios that can be obtained starting from the zero portfolio. This is intimately related to self-financing portfolios .  The dual cone of the solvency cone (     K  +   =   {   w  ∈   ℝ  d    :     ∀  v   ∈  K   :   0  ≤    w  T   v     }        superscript  K     conditional-set    w   superscript  ℝ  d     normal-:     for-all  v   K     0     superscript  w  T   v        K^{+}=\left\{w\in\mathbb{R}^{d}:\forall v\in K:0\leq w^{T}v\right\}   ) are the set of prices which would define a friction-less pricing system for the assets that is consistent with the market. This is also called a consistent pricing system . 3  Examples  Assume there are 2 assets, A and M with 1 to 1 exchange possible.  Frictionless market  In a frictionless market , we can obviously make (1A,-1M) and (-1A,1M) into non-negative portfolios, therefore    K  =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  2    :     (  1  ,  1  )   x   ≥  0   }       K   conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  2         1  1   x   0      K=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:(1,1)x\geq 0\}   . Note that (1,1) is the "price vector."  With transaction costs  Assume further that there is 50% transaction costs for each deal. This means that (1A,-1M) and (-1A,1M) cannot be exchanged into non-negative portfolios. But, (2A,-1M) and (-1A,2M) can be traded into non-negative portfolios. It can be seen that    K  =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  2    :      (  2  ,  1  )   x   ≥  0   ,     (  1  ,  2  )   x   ≥  0    }       K   conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  2     formulae-sequence       2  1   x   0        1  2   x   0       K=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:(2,1)x\geq 0,(1,2)x\geq 0\}   .  The dual cone of prices is thus easiest to see in terms of prices of A in terms of M (and similarly done for price of M in terms of A):   someone offers 1A for tM     (  0  ,  t  )   →   (  1  ,  0  )   →   (  0  ,   1  2   )        normal-→   0  t    1  0     normal-→     0    1  2       (0,t)\rightarrow(1,0)\rightarrow(0,\frac{1}{2})   therefore there is arbitrage if    t  <   1  2       t    1  2     t<\frac{1}{2}     someone offers tM for 1A     (  1  ,  0  )   →   (  0  ,  t  )   →   (   t  2   ,  0  )        normal-→   1  0    0  t     normal-→       t  2   0      (1,0)\rightarrow(0,t)\rightarrow(\frac{t}{2},0)   therefore there is arbitrage if    t  >  2      t  2    t>2      Properties  If a solvency cone   K   K   K   :   contains a line, then there is an exchange possible without transaction costs.      K  =   ℝ  +  d       K   subscript   superscript  ℝ  d       K=\mathbb{R}^{d}_{+}   , then there is no possible exchange, i.e. the market is completely illiquid .
