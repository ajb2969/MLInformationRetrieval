   Fitting ideal      Fitting ideal   In commutative algebra , the Fitting ideals of a finitely generated module over a commutative ring describe the obstructions to generating the module by a given number of elements. They were introduced by .  Definition  If M is a finitely generated module over a commutative ring R generated by elements m 1 ,..., m n with relations       a   j  1     m  1   +  ⋯  +   a   j  n     m  n   =   0    (  for  j  =  1  ,  2  ,  …  )      fragments   subscript  a    j  1     subscript  m  1    normal-⋯    subscript  a    j  n     subscript  m  n    0   fragments  normal-(  for  j   1  normal-,  2  normal-,  normal-…  normal-)     a_{j1}m_{1}+\cdots+a_{jn}m_{n}=0\ (\text{for }j=1,2,\dots)\,     then the i th Fitting ideal Fitt i ( M ) of M is generated by the minors (determinants of submatrices) of order n − i of the matrix a jk . The Fitting ideals do not depend on the choice of generators and relations of M .  Some authors defined the Fitting ideal I ( M ) to be the first nonzero Fitting ideal Fitt i ( M ).  Properties  The Fitting ideals are increasing   Fitt 0 ( M ) ⊆ Fitt 1 ( M ) ⊆ Fitt 2 ( M ) ...   If M can be generated by n elements then Fitt n ( M ) = R , and if R is local the converse holds. We have Fitt 0 ( M ) ⊆ Ann( M ) (the annihilator of M ), and Ann( M )Fitt i ( M ) ⊆ Fitt i −1 ( M ), so in particular if M can be generated by n elements then Ann( M ) n ⊆ Fitt 0 ( M ).  Examples  If M is free of rank n then the Fitting ideals Fitt i ( M ) are zero for i 0( M ) is the ideal (| M |).  The Alexander polynomial of a knot is a generator of the Fitting ideal of the first homology of the infinite abelian cover of the knot complement.  References        "  Category:Commutative algebra
