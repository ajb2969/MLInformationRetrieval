Cocks IBE scheme

Cocks IBE scheme is an identity based encryption system proposed by Clifford Cocks in 2001.1 The security of the scheme is based on the hardness of the quadratic residuosity problem.
Protocol
Setup
The PKG chooses:

a public RSA-modulus 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  are prime and kept secret,
the message and the cipher space 
 
 
 
  and
a secure public hash function 
 
 
 
 .

Extract
When user 
 
 
 
  wants to obtain his private key, he contacts the PKG through a secure channel. The PKG

derives 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  by a determistic process from 
 
 
 
  (e.g. multiple application of 
 
 
 
 ),
computes 
 
 
 
  (which fulfils either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , see below) and
transmits 
 
 
 
  to the user.

Encrypt
To encrypt a bit (coded as 
 
 
 
 /
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , the user

chooses random 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 ,
chooses random 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , different from 
 
 
 
 ,
computes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and
sends 
 
 
 
  to the user.

Decrypt
To decrypt a ciphertext 
 
 
 
  for user 
 
 
 
 , he

computes 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  otherwise, and
computes 
 
 
 
 .

Note that here we are assuming that the encrypting entity does not know whether 
 
 
 
  has the square root

 
  of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . In this case we have to send a ciphertext for both cases. As soon as this information is known to the encrypting entity, only one element needs to be sent.
Correctness
First note that since 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
 , either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore, 
 
 
 
  is a square root of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 :



Moreover (for the case that 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue, same idea holds for 
 
 
 
 ):



Security
It can be shown that breaking the scheme is equivalent to solving the quadratic residuosity problem, which is suspected to be very hard. The common rules for choosing a RSA modulus hold: Use a secure 
 
 
 
 
 , make the choice of 
 
 
 
  uniform and random and moreover include some authenticity checks for 
 
 
 
  (otherwise, an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack can be mounted by altering packets that transmit a single bit and using the oracle to observe the effect on the decrypted bit).
Problems
A major disadavantage of this scheme is that it can encrypt messages only bit per bit - therefore, it is only suitable for small data packets like a session key. To illustrate, consider a 128 bit key that is transmitted using a 1024 bit modulus. Then, one has to send 2 × 128 × 1024 bit = 32 KByte (when it is not known whether 
 
 
 
  is the square of a or −a), which is only acceptable for environments in which session keys change infrequently.
This scheme does not preserve key-privacy, i.e. a passive adversary can recover meaningful information about the identity of the recipient observing the ciphertext.
