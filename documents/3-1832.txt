   Coordinate rotations and reflections      Coordinate rotations and reflections   In geometry , two-dimensional  coordinate rotations and reflections are two kinds of Euclidean plane isometries which are related to one another.  A rotation in the plane can be formed by composing a pair of reflections. First reflect a point P to its image P′ on the other side of line L 1 . Then reflect P′ to its image P′′ on the other side of line L 2 . If lines L 1 and L 2 make an angle θ with one another, then points P and P′′ will make an angle 2θ around point O , the intersection of L 1 and L 2 . I.e. angle POP′′ will measure 2θ .  A pair of rotations about the same point O will be equivalent to another rotation about point O . On the other hand, the composition of a reflection and a rotation, or of a rotation and a reflection (composition is not commutative ), will be equivalent to a reflection.  The statements above can be expressed more mathematically. Let a rotation about the origin  O by an angle θ be denoted as Rot( θ ). Let a reflection about a line L through the origin which makes an angle θ with the x -axis be denoted as Ref( θ ). Let these rotations and reflections operate on all points on the plane, and let these points be represented by position vectors . Then a rotation can be represented as a matrix,        Rot   (  θ  )    =   [      cos  θ      -   sin  θ         sin  θ      cos  θ      ]    ,        Rot  θ       θ       θ        θ     θ       \mathrm{Rot}(\theta)=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\
 \sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{bmatrix},   and likewise for a reflection,        Ref   (  θ  )    =   [      cos   2  θ       sin   2  θ         sin   2  θ       -   cos   2  θ        ]    .        Ref  θ         2  θ        2  θ          2  θ          2  θ         \mathrm{Ref}(\theta)=\begin{bmatrix}\cos 2\theta&\sin 2\theta\\
 \sin 2\theta&-\cos 2\theta\end{bmatrix}.     With these definitions of coordinate rotation and reflection, the following four equations are true:        Ref   (  θ  )   Ref   (  ϕ  )    =   Rot   (   2   (   θ  -  ϕ   )    )     ,        Ref  θ  Ref  ϕ     Rot    2    θ  ϕ       \mathrm{Ref}(\theta)\,\mathrm{Ref}(\phi)=\mathrm{Rot}(2(\theta-\phi)),           Rot   (  θ  )   Rot   (  ϕ  )    =   Rot   (   θ  +  ϕ   )     ,        Rot  θ  Rot  ϕ     Rot    θ  ϕ      \mathrm{Rot}(\theta)\,\mathrm{Rot}(\phi)=\mathrm{Rot}(\theta+\phi),           Rot   (  θ  )   Ref   (  ϕ  )    =   Ref   (   ϕ  +   θ  /  2    )     ,        Rot  θ  Ref  ϕ     Ref    ϕ    θ  2       \mathrm{Rot}(\theta)\,\mathrm{Ref}(\phi)=\mathrm{Ref}(\phi+\theta/2),           Ref   (  ϕ  )   Rot   (  θ  )    =   Ref   (   ϕ  -   θ  /  2    )     .        Ref  ϕ  Rot  θ     Ref    ϕ    θ  2       \mathrm{Ref}(\phi)\,\mathrm{Rot}(\theta)=\mathrm{Ref}(\phi-\theta/2).   These equations can be proved through straightforward matrix multiplication and application of trigonometric identities .  The set of all reflections in lines through the origin and rotations about the origin, together with the operation of composition of reflections and rotations, forms a group . The group has an identity: Rot(0). Every rotation Rot( φ ) has an inverse Rot(− φ ). Every reflection Ref( θ ) is its own inverse. Composition has closure and is associative, since matrix multiplication is associative.  Notice that both Ref( θ ) and Rot( θ ) have been represented with orthogonal matrices . These matrices all have a determinant whose absolute value is unity. Rotation matrices have a determinant of +1, and reflection matrices have a determinant of −1.  The set of all orthogonal two-dimensional matrices together with matrix multiplication form the orthogonal group : O (2).
