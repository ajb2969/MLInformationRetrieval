   Lemniscate of Gerono      Lemniscate of Gerono   In algebraic geometry , the lemniscate of Gerono , or lemniscate of Huygens , or figure-eight curve , is a plane algebraic curve of degree four and genus zero and is a lemniscate curve shaped like an $\infty$ symbol, or figure eight. It has equation  $$x^4-x^2+y^2 = 0.$$  It was studied by Camille-Christophe Gerono .  Because the curve is of genus zero, it can be parametrized by rational functions; one means of doing that is  $$x = \frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1},\ y = \frac{2t(t^2-1)}{(t^2+1)^2}.$$  Another representation is  $$x = \cos \varphi,\ y = \sin\varphi\,\cos\varphi = \sin(2\varphi)/2$$ which reveals that this lemniscate is a special case of a lissajous figure .  The dual curve (see Pl√ºcker formula ), pictured below, has therefore a somewhat different character. Its equation is  $$(x^2-y^2)^3 + 8y^4+20x^2y^2-x^4-16y^2=0.$$  (Figure)  Dual to the lemniscate of Gerono   References     Notes  External links     "  Category:Algebraic curves
