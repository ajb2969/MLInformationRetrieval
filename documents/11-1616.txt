T2-induced deoxynucleotide kinase




T2-induced deoxynucleotide kinase

In enzymology, a T2-induced deoxynucleotide kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + dGMP (or dTMP) 
 
 
 
  ADP + dGDP (or dTDP)
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, dGMP, and dTMP, whereas its 3 products are ADP, dGDP, and dTDP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:(d)NMP phosphotransferase.
