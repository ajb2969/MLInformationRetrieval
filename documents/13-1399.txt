   Shields parameter      Shields parameter   The Shields parameter , also called the Shields criterion or Shields number , is a nondimensional number used to calculate the initiation of motion of sediment in a fluid flow . It is a nondimensionalization of a shear stress , and is typically denoted    τ  ∗     subscript  τ  normal-∗    \tau_{\ast}   or   θ   θ   \theta   . It is given by:        τ  ∗   =  θ  =   τ    (    ρ  s   -  ρ   )   g  D     ,         subscript  τ  normal-∗   θ         τ       subscript  ρ  s   ρ   g  D       \tau_{\ast}=\theta=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_{s}-\rho)gD},     where:      τ   τ   \tau   is a dimensional shear stress;      ρ  s     subscript  ρ  s    \rho_{s}   is the density of the sediment;     ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the fluid;     g   g   g   is acceleration due to gravity;     D   D   D   is a characteristic particle diameter of the sediment.   Physical meaning  By multiplying the top and bottom of the Shields parameter by D 2 , you can see that it is proportional to the ratio of fluid force on the particle to the weight of the particle.
