2-deoxy-D-gluconate 3-dehydrogenase

2-deoxy-D-gluconate 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-deoxy-D-gluconate + NAD+

 
  3-dehydro-2-deoxy-D-gluconate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-deoxy-D-gluconate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydro-2-deoxy-D-gluconate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-deoxy-D-gluconate:NAD+ 3-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called 2-deoxygluconate dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
