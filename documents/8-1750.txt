   Conchoid of Dürer      Conchoid of Dürer   (Figure)  Conchoid of Dürer, constructed by him   The conchoid of Dürer , also called Dürer's shell curve, is a variant of a conchoid or plane  algebraic curve , named after Albrecht Dürer . It is not a true conchoid.  Construction  Let Q and R be points moving on a pair of perpendicular lines which intersect at O in such a way that OQ + OR is constant. On any line QR mark point P at a fixed distance from Q . The locus of the points P is Dürer's conchoid.  Equation  The equation of the conchoid in Cartesian form is             2   y  2    (    x  2   +   y  2    )    -   2  b   y  2    (   x  +  y   )     +    (    b  2   -   3   a  2     )    y  2     -    a  2    x  2     +   2   a  2   b   (   x  +  y   )    +    a  2    (    a  2   -   b  2    )     =   0.                 2   superscript  y  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       2  b   superscript  y  2     x  y          superscript  b  2     3   superscript  a  2      superscript  y  2        superscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       2   superscript  a  2   b    x  y       superscript  a  2      superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2      0.    2y^{2}(x^{2}+y^{2})-2by^{2}(x+y)+(b^{2}-3a^{2})y^{2}-a^{2}x^{2}+2a^{2}b(x+y)+a%
 ^{2}(a^{2}-b^{2})=0.\,        Properties  The curve has two components, asymptotic to the lines    y  =   ±   a  /   2         y   plus-or-minus    a    2       y=\pm a/\sqrt{2}   . Each component is a rational curve . If a > b there is a loop, if a = b there is a cusp at (0, a ).  Special cases include:   a =0: the line y =0;  b =0: the line pair    y  =   ±   x  /   2         y   plus-or-minus    x    2       y=\pm x/\sqrt{2}   together with the circle      x  2   +   y  2    =   a  2          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  a  2     x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}   ;   History  It was first described by the German painter and mathematician  Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) in his book Underweysung der Messung (S. 38), calling it Ein muschellini .
