   Formate dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Formate dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a formate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CO 2 + NADPH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are formate and NADP + , whereas its two products are CO 2 and NADPH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formate:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADP+-dependent formate dehydrogenase , and formate dehydrogenase (NADP+) . This enzyme participates in methane metabolism . It has 3 cofactors : iron , Tungsten , and Selenium .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
