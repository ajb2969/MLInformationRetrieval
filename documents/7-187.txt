Signal-to-quantization-noise ratio

Signal-to-Quantization-Noise Ratio (SQNR or SNqR) is widely used quality measure in analysing digitizing schemes such as PCM (pulse code modulation) and multimedia codecs. The SQNR reflects the relationship between the maximum nominal signal strength and the quantization error (also known as quantization noise) introduced in the analog-to-digital conversion.
The SQNR formula is derived from the general SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) formula for the binary pulse-code modulated communication channel:



where


 
  is the probability of received bit error


 
  is the peak message signal level


 
  is the mean message signal level
As SQNR applies to quantized signals, the formulae for SQNR refer to discrete-time digital signals. Instead of 
 
 
 
 , we will use the digitized signal 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  quantization steps, each sample, 
 
 
 
  requires 
 
 
 
  bits. The probability distribution function (pdf) representing the distribution of values in 
 
 
 
  and can be denoted as 
 
 
 
 . The maximum magnitude value of any 
 
 
 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
As SQNR, like SNR, is a ratio of signal power to some noise power, it can be calculated as:


 
  The signal power is:


 
  The quantization noise power can be expressed as:


 
  Giving:



When the SQNR is desired in terms of Decibels (dB), a useful approximation to SQNR is:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of bits in a quantized sample, and 
 
 
 
  is the signal power calculated above. Note that for each bit added to a sample, the SQNR goes up by approximately 6dB (
 
 
 
 ).
