Tryptophan 7-halogenase

Tryptophan 7-halogenase (, PrnA, RebH) is an enzyme with systematic name L-tryptophan:FADH2 oxidoreductase (7-halogenating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

tryptophan + FADH2 + Cl− + O2 + H+

 
  7-chloro-L-tryptophan + FAD + 2 H2O
 

In Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes the enzyme catalyses the initial step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin.3
The enzyme can use bromide ions (Br−) in place of chloride (Cl−).4
