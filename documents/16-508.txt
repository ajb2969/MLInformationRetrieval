   Cross-serial dependencies      Cross-serial dependencies   (Figure)  A schematic showing cross-serial dependencies. Notice that the w's and v's, which represent words, each form respective series. Notice also that the lines representing the dependency relations mutually overlap.   In linguistics , cross-serial dependencies (also called crossing dependencies by some authors 1 ) occur when the lines representing the dependency relations between two series of words cross over each other. 2 They are of particular interest to linguists who wish to determine the syntactic structure of natural language; languages containing an arbitrary number of them are non-context-free. By this fact, Dutch 3 and Swiss-German 4 have been proved to be non-context-free.  Example  As Swiss-German allows verbs and their arguments to be ordered cross-serially, we have the following example, taken from Shieber: 5      ... mer   em Hans   s   huus   hälfed   aastriiche.     ... we   Hans ( )   the   house ( )   helped   paint.     That is, "we helped Hans paint the house."  Notice that the sequential noun phrases em Hans ( Hans ) and s huus ( the house ), and the sequential verbs hälfed ( helped ) and aastriiche ( paint ) both form two separate series of constituents. Notice also that the dative verb  hälfed and the accusative verb  aastriiche take the dative em Hans and accusative s huus as their arguments, respectively.  Why languages containing cross-serial dependencies are non-context-free  In Swiss-German sentences, the number of verbs of a grammatical case (dative or accusative) must match the number of objects of that case. Additionally, a sentence containing an arbitrary number of such objects is admissible (in principle). Hence, the following formal language is grammatical:      L  =   De Jan s   a  ¨   it das mer (d’chind)   (em Hans)    m    s huus h    n    a  ¨   nd wele (laa)   (h    m    a  ¨   lfe)   aastriiche.    n        L    De Jan s   normal-¨  normal-a   it das mer (d’chind)   superscript  (em Hans)  m    superscript  s huus h  n    normal-¨  normal-a   nd wele (laa)   superscript  (h  m    normal-¨  normal-a   lfe)   superscript  aastriiche.  n      L=\text{De Jan}\text{ s}\ddot{\mathrm{a}}\text{it}\text{ das}\text{ mer}\text{%
  (d'chind)}{}^{m}\text{ (em}\text{ Hans)}{}^{n}\text{ s}\text{ huus}\text{ h}%
 \ddot{\mathrm{a}}\text{nd}\text{ wele}\text{ (laa)}{}^{m}\text{ (h}\ddot{%
 \mathrm{a}}\text{lfe)}{}^{n}\text{ aastriiche.}     It can be seen that   L   L   L   is of the form    x   a  m    b  n   y   c  m    d  n   z      x   superscript  a  m    superscript  b  n   y   superscript  c  m    superscript  d  n   z    xa^{m}b^{n}yc^{m}d^{n}z   . By taking another image to remove the   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   and   z   z   z   , the non-context-free 6 language     L  ′   =    a  m    b  n    c  m    d  n         superscript  L  normal-′      superscript  a  m    superscript  b  n    superscript  c  m    superscript  d  n      L^{\prime}=a^{m}b^{n}c^{m}d^{n}   may be observed. All spoken languages which contain cross-serial dependencies also contain a language of a form similar to    L  ′     superscript  L  normal-′    L^{\prime}   . 7  Treatment  Research in mildly context-sensitive language has attempted to identify a narrower and more computationally tractable subclass of context-sensitive languages that can capture context sensitivity as found in natural languages. For example cross-serial dependencies can be expressed in linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS); one can write a LCFRS grammar for { a n b n c n d n | n ≥ 1} for example. 8 9 10  References  "  Category:Formal languages  Category:Linguistics terminology     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩   . ↩   http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/GrammarFormalisms/4nl-cfg.pdf ↩  http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/GrammarFormalisms/4lcfrs-intro.pdf ↩  ↩
