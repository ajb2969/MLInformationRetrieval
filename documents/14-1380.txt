Little q-Laguerre polynomials

In mathematics, the little q-Laguerre polynomials pn(x;a|q) or Wall polynomials Wn(x; b,q) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme closely related to a continued fraction studied by . (The term "Wall polynomial" is also used for an unrelated Wall polynomial in the theory of classical groups.)  give a detailed list of their properties.
