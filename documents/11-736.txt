   Maleimide hydrolase      Maleimide hydrolase   In enzymology , a maleimide hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   maleimide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   maleamic acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are maleimide and H 2 O , whereas its product is maleamic acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclic-imide amidohydrolase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include imidase , cyclic imide hydrolase , and cyclic-imide amidohydrolase (decyclicizing) [misprint] .
