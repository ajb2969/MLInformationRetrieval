   Linearly ordered group      Linearly ordered group   In abstract algebra a linearly ordered or totally ordered group is a group  G equipped with a total order "≤", that is translation-invariant . This may have different meanings. Let a , b , c ∈ G , we say that (G, ≤) is a   left-ordered group if a ≤ b implies c+a ≤ c+b  right-ordered group if a ≤ b implies a+c ≤ b+c  bi-ordered group if it is both left-ordered and right-ordered   In analogy with ordinary numbers, we call an element c of an ordered group positive if 0 ≤ c and c ≠ 0, where "0" here denotes the identity element of the group (not necessarily the familiar zero of the real numbers). The set of positive elements in a group is often denoted with G + . 1  For every element a of a linearly ordered group G either a ∈ G + , or '' -a''  ∈ G + , or a = 0. If a linearly ordered group G is not trivial (i.e. 0 is not its only element), then G + is infinite. Therefore, every nontrivial linearly ordered group is infinite.  If a is an element of a linearly ordered group G , then the absolute value of a , denoted by | a |, is defined to be:       |  a  |   :=   {      a  ,        if  a   ⩾  0   ,         -  a   ,      otherwise  .          assign    a    cases  a      if  a   0     a   otherwise     |a|:=\begin{cases}a,&\text{if }a\geqslant 0,\\
 -a,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}     If in addition the group G is abelian , then for any a , b ∈ G the triangle inequality is satisfied: | a + b | ≤ | a | + | b |.  Examples  Any totally ordered group is torsion-free . Conversely, F. W. Levi showed that an abelian group admits a linear order if and only if it is torsion free .  Otto Hölder showed that every Archimedean group (a bi-ordered group satisfying an Archimedean property ) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group of real numbers , . If we write the archimedean l.o. group multiplicatively, this may be shown by considering the dedekind completion,    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   of the closure of an l.o. group under   n   n   n   th roots. We endow this space with the usual topology of a linear order, and then it can be shown that for each    g  ∈   G  ^       g   normal-^  G     g\in\widehat{G}   the exponential maps     g  ⋅   :    (  ℝ  ,  +  )   →   (   G  ^   ,  ⋅  )    :     lim  i    q  i    ∈  ℚ  ↦    lim  i    g   q  i           normal-:   superscript  g  normal-⋅    normal-→   ℝ      normal-^  G   normal-⋅      normal-:          subscript   i    subscript  q  i    ℚ    maps-to      subscript   i    superscript  g   subscript  q  i          g^{\cdot}:(\mathbb{R},+)\to(\widehat{G},\cdot):\lim_{i}q_{i}\in\mathbb{Q}%
 \mapsto\lim_{i}g^{q_{i}}   are well defined order preserving/reversing, topological group isomorphisms. Completing an l.o. group can be difficult in the non-archimedean case. In these cases, one may classify a group by its rank: which is related to the order type of the largest sequence of convex subgroups.  A large source of examples of left-orderable groups comes from groups acting on the real line by order preserving homeomorphisms. Actually, for countable groups, this is known to be a characterization of left-orderability, see for instance .
