Lambda g conjecture




Lambda g conjecture


In algebraic geometry, the 

 
 -conjecture gives a particularly simple formula for certain integrals on the Deligne–Mumford compactification 
 
 
 
  of the moduli space of curves with marked points. It was first found as a consequence of the Virasoro conjecture by . Later, it was proven by  using virtual localization in Gromov–Witten theory. It is named after the factor of 
 
 
 
 , the gth Chern class of the Hodge bundle, appearing in its integrand. The other factor is a monomial in the 
 
 
 
 , the first Chern classes of the n cotangent line bundles, as in Witten's conjecture.
Let a1, ..., an be positive integers whose sum is 2g − 3 + n. Then the 
 
 
 
 -formula says that



Together with the formula



where the B2g are Bernoulli numbers, therefore the 
 
 
 
 -formula gives a way to calculate all integrals on 
 
 
 
  involving products in 
 
 
 
 -classes and a factor of 
 
 
 
 .
