Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase




Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase

In enzymology, a phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphonoacetaldehyde + H2O 
 
 
 
  acetaldehyde + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphonoacetaldehyde and H2O, whereas its two products are acetaldehyde and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-oxoethylphosphonate phosphonohydrolase. Other names in common use include phosphonatase, and 2-phosphonoacetylaldehyde phosphonohydrolase. This enzyme participates in aminophosphonate metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
