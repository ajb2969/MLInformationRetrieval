   Polar curve      Polar curve   (Figure)  The elliptic curve  E : 4 Y 2 Z = X 3 − XZ 2 in blue, and its polar curve ( E ) : 4 Y 2 = 2.7 X 2 − 2 XZ − 0.9Z 2 for the point Q = (0.9, 0) in red. The black lines show the tangents to E at the intersection points of E and its first polar with respect to Q meeting at Q .   In algebraic geometry , the first polar , or simply polar of an algebraic plane curve  C of degree n with respect to a point Q is an algebraic curve of degree n −1 which contains every point of C whose tangent line passes through Q . It is used to investigate the relationship between the curve and its dual , for example in the derivation of the Plücker formulas .  Definition  Let C be defined in homogeneous coordinates by f ( x, y, z ) = 0 where f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n , and let the homogeneous coordinates of Q be ( a , b , c ). Define the operator        Δ  Q   =    a   ∂   ∂  x     +   b   ∂   ∂  y     +   c   ∂   ∂  z       .       subscript  normal-Δ  Q       a       x       b       y       c       z        \Delta_{Q}=a{\partial\over\partial x}+b{\partial\over\partial y}+c{\partial%
 \over\partial z}.   Then Δ Q f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n −1 and Δ Q f ( x, y, z ) = 0 defines a curve of degree n −1 called the first polar of C with respect of Q .  If P =( p , q , r ) is a non-singular point on the curve C then the equation of the tangent at P is        x    ∂  f    ∂  x     (  p  ,  q  ,  r  )    +   y    ∂  f    ∂  y     (  p  ,  q  ,  r  )    +   z    ∂  f    ∂  z     (  p  ,  q  ,  r  )     =  0.          x      f     x     p  q  r      y      f     y     p  q  r      z      f     z     p  q  r     0.    x{\partial f\over\partial x}(p,q,r)+y{\partial f\over\partial y}(p,q,r)+z{%
 \partial f\over\partial z}(p,q,r)=0.   In particular, P is on the intersection of C and its first polar with respect to Q if and only if Q is on the tangent to C at P . Note also that for a double point of C , the partial derivatives of f are all 0 so the first polar contains these points as well.  Class of a curve  The class of C may be defined as the number of tangents that may be drawn to C from a point not on C (counting multiplicities and including imaginary tangents). Each of these tangents touches C at one of the points of intersection of C and the first polar, and by Bézout's theorem theorem there are at most n ( n −1) of these. This puts an upper bound of n ( n −1) on the class of a curve of degree n . The class may be computed exactly by counting the number and type of singular points on C (see Plücker formula ).  Higher polars  The p-th polar of a C for an natural number p is defined as Δ Q p f ( x, y, z ) = 0. This is a curve of degree n − p . When p is n −1 the p -th polar is a line called the polar line of C with respect to Q . Similarly, when p is n −2 the curve is called the polar conic of C .  Using Taylor series in several variables and exploiting homogeneity, f (λ a +μ p , λ b +μ q , λ c +μ r ) can be expanded in two ways as        μ  n   f   (  p  ,  q  ,  r  )    +   λ   μ   n  -  1     Δ  Q   f   (  p  ,  q  ,  r  )    +    1  2    λ  2    μ   n  -  2     Δ  Q  2   f   (  p  ,  q  ,  r  )    +  …         superscript  μ  n   f   p  q  r      λ   superscript  μ    n  1     subscript  normal-Δ  Q   f   p  q  r        1  2    superscript  λ  2    superscript  μ    n  2     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  Q   2   f   p  q  r    normal-…    \mu^{n}f(p,q,r)+\lambda\mu^{n-1}\Delta_{Q}f(p,q,r)+\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2}\mu^{%

In particular, the p -th polar of C with respect to Q is the locus of points P so that the ( n − p )-th polar of C with respect to P passes through Q . 1  Poles  If the polar line of C with respect to a point Q is a line L , the Q is said to be a pole of L . A given line has ( n −1) 2 poles (counting multiplicities etc.) where n is the degree of C . So see this, pick two points P and Q on L . The locus of points whose polar lines pass through P is the first polar of P and this is a curve of degree n − 1 . Similarly, the locus of points whose polar lines pass through Q is the first polar of Q and this is also a curve of degree n − 1 . The polar line of a point is L if and only if it contains both P and Q , so the poles of L are exactly the points of intersection of the two first polars. By Bézout's theorem these curves have ( n −1) 2 points of intersection and these are the poles of L . 2  The Hessian  For a given point Q =( a , b , c ), the polar conic is the locus of points P so that Q is on the second polar of P . In other words the equation of the polar conic is        Δ   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   2   f   (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    =     x  2      ∂  2   f    ∂   x  2      (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    +   2  x  y     ∂  2   f     ∂  x    ∂  y      (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    +  …   =  0.           superscript   subscript  normal-Δ   x  y  z    2   f   a  b  c         superscript  x  2       superscript   2   f      superscript  x  2      a  b  c      2  x  y      superscript   2   f       x     y      a  b  c    normal-…        0.     \Delta_{(x,y,z)}^{2}f(a,b,c)=x^{2}{\partial^{2}f\over\partial x^{2}}(a,b,c)+2%
 xy{\partial^{2}f\over\partial x\partial y}(a,b,c)+\dots=0.   The conic is degenerate if and only if the determinant of the Hessian of f ,        H   (  f  )    =   [         ∂  2   f    ∂   x  2            ∂  2   f     ∂   x     ∂  y            ∂  2   f     ∂   x     ∂  z                   ∂  2   f     ∂   y     ∂  x            ∂  2   f    ∂   y  2            ∂  2   f     ∂   y     ∂  z                   ∂  2   f     ∂   z     ∂  x            ∂  2   f     ∂   z     ∂  y            ∂  2   f    ∂   z  2         ]    ,        H  f         superscript   2   f      superscript  x  2         superscript   2   f       x     y         superscript   2   f       x     z       absent        superscript   2   f       y     x         superscript   2   f      superscript  y  2         superscript   2   f       y     z       absent        superscript   2   f       z     x         superscript   2   f       z     y         superscript   2   f      superscript  z  2         H(f)=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}&\frac{\partial^{2}f}{%

Therefore the equation | H ( f )|=0 defines a curve, the locus of points whose polar conics are degenerate, of degree 3( n − 2 ) called the Hessian curve of C .
