   Euler's sum of powers conjecture      Euler's sum of powers conjecture   Euler's conjecture is a disproved conjecture in mathematics related to Fermat's last theorem . It was proposed by Leonhard Euler in 1769. It states that for all integers  n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n  k th powers of non-zero integers is itself a k th power, then n is greater than or equal to k .  In symbols, the conjecture falsely states that if      ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =   b  k         superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k     superscript  b  k     \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=b^{k}   where    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   and     a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  n   ,  b      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  n   b    a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n},b   are non-zero integers, then    n  ≥  k      n  k    n\geq k   .  The conjecture represents an attempt to generalize Fermat's last theorem , which is the special case n = 2: if      a  1  k   +   a  2  k    =   b  k          superscript   subscript  a  1   k    superscript   subscript  a  2   k     superscript  b  k     a_{1}^{k}+a_{2}^{k}=b^{k}   , then    2  ≥  k      2  k    2\geq k   .  Although the conjecture holds for the case k = 3 (which follows from Fermat's last theorem for the third powers), it has been disproved for k = 4, k = 5, k = 7, and k = 8. It is unknown whether the conjecture fails or holds for k = 6 or for any value k ≥ 9.  Background  Euler had an equality for four fourth powers       59  4   +   158  4    =    133  4   +   134  4     ;         superscript  59  4    superscript  158  4       superscript  133  4    superscript  134  4      59^{4}+158^{4}=133^{4}+134^{4};   this however is not a counterexample because no term is isolated on one side of the equation. He also provided a complete solution to the four cubes problem as in Plato's number       3  3   +   4  3   +   5  3    =   6  3          superscript  3  3    superscript  4  3    superscript  5  3     superscript  6  3     3^{3}+4^{3}+5^{3}=6^{3}   or the taxicab number 1729. 1 2 The general solution for:        x  1  3   +   x  2  3    =    x  3  3   +   x  4  3           superscript   subscript  x  1   3    superscript   subscript  x  2   3       superscript   subscript  x  3   3    superscript   subscript  x  4   3      x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}=x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}   is        x  1   =   1  -    (   a  -   3  b    )    (    a  2   +   3   b  2     )      ,    x  2   =     (   a  +   3  b    )    (    a  2   +   3   b  2     )    -  1       formulae-sequence     subscript  x  1     1      a    3  b       superscript  a  2     3   superscript  b  2           subscript  x  2         a    3  b       superscript  a  2     3   superscript  b  2      1      x_{1}=1-(a-3b)(a^{2}+3b^{2}),x_{2}=(a+3b)(a^{2}+3b^{2})-1           x  3   =    (   a  +   3  b    )   -    (    a  2   +   3   b  2     )   2     ,    x  4   =     (    a  2   +   3   b  2     )   2   -   (   a  -   3  b    )        formulae-sequence     subscript  x  3       a    3  b     superscript     superscript  a  2     3   superscript  b  2     2        subscript  x  4      superscript     superscript  a  2     3   superscript  b  2     2     a    3  b        x_{3}=(a+3b)-(a^{2}+3b^{2})^{2},x_{4}=(a^{2}+3b^{2})^{2}-(a-3b)   where   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are any integers.  Counterexamples  Euler's conjecture was disproven by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin in 1966 when, through a direct computer search on a CDC 6600 , they found a counterexample for k = 5. 3 A total of three primitive (that is, in which the summands do not all have a common factor) counterexamples are known:    27 5 + 84 5 + 110 5 + 133 5 = 144 5 (Lander & Parkin, 1966),       (−220) 5 + 5027 5 + 6237 5 + 14068 5 = 14132 5 (Scher & Seidl, 1996), and       55 5 + 3183 5 + 28969 5 + 85282 5 = 85359 5 (Frye, 2004).     In 1986, Noam Elkies found a method to construct an infinite series of counterexamples for the k = 4 case. 4 His smallest counterexample was    2682440 4 + 15365639 4 + 18796760 4 = 20615673 4 .     A particular case of Elkies' solutions can be reduced to the identity 5 6    (85 v 2 + 484 v − 313) 4 + (68 v 2 − 586 v + 10) 4 + (2 u ) 4 = (357 v 2 − 204 v + 363) 4      where    u 2 = 22030 + 28849 v − 56158 v 2 + 36941 v 3 − 31790 v 4 .     This is an elliptic curve with a rational point at v 1 = −31/467. From this initial rational point, one can compute an infinite collection of others. Substituting v 1 into the identity and removing common factors gives the numerical example cited above.  In 1988, Roger Frye found the smallest possible counterexample    95800 4 + 217519 4 + 414560 4 = 422481 4      for k = 4 by a direct computer search using techniques suggested by Elkies. This solution is the only one with values of the variables below 1,000,000. 7  Generalizations  In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and John Selfridge conjectured 8 that if k > 3 and      ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =    ∑   j  =  1   m    b  j  k          superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k      superscript   subscript     j  1    m    superscript   subscript  b  j   k      \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j}^{k}   , where a i ≠ b j are positive integers for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m , then m + n ≥ k . In the special case m = 1, the conjecture states that if          ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =   b  k         superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k     superscript  b  k     \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=b^{k}        (under the conditions given above) then n ≥ k − 1.  The special case may be described as the problem of giving a partition of a perfect power into few like powers. For k = 4, 5, 7, 8 and n = k or k − 1, there are many known solutions. Some of these are listed below. There are no solutions for k = 6 where b ≤ 272580.  === k = 4===    95800 4 + 217519 4 + 414560 4 = 422481 4 (R. Frye, 1988) 9        30 4 + 120 4 + 272 4 + 315 4 = 353 4 (R. Norrie, 1911) 10      === k = 5===    27 5 + 84 5 + 110 5 + 133 5 = 144 5 (Lander & Parkin, 1966)       19 5 + 43 5 + 46 5 + 47 5 + 67 5 = 72 5 (Lander, Parkin, Selfridge, smallest, 1967) 11        7 5 + 43 5 + 57 5 + 80 5 + 100 5 = 107 5 (Sastry, 1934, third smallest) 12      === k = 7===    127 7 + 258 7 + 266 7 + 413 7 + 430 7 + 439 7 + 525 7 = 568 7 (M.
