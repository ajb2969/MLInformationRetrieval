   Continuum function      Continuum function   The continuum function is    κ  ↦   2  κ      maps-to  κ   superscript  2  κ     \kappa\mapsto 2^{\kappa}   , i.e. raising 2 to the power of κ using cardinal exponentiation . Given a cardinal number , it is the cardinality of the power set of a set of the given cardinality.
