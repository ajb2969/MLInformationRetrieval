N6-acetyl-beta-lysine transaminase

In enzymology, a N6-acetyl-beta-lysine transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

6-acetamido-3-aminohexanoate + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  6-acetamido-3-oxohexanoate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-acetamido-3-aminohexanoate and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are 6-acetamido-3-oxohexanoate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-acetamido-3-aminohexanoate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. This enzyme is also called epsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
