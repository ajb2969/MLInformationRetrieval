1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(1R,6R)-1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate + NAD+

 
  catechol + CO2 + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1R,6R)-1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate and NAD+, whereas its 4 products are catechol, CO2, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1R,6R)-1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include 3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase, 3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol-1-carboxylic acid dehydrogenase, dihydrodihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase, DHBDH, cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase, 2-hydro-1,2-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase, cis-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate:NAD+, oxidoreductase, and dihydrodihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
