Neopentalenolactone D synthase




Neopentalenolactone D synthase

Neopentalenolactone D synthase (, ptlE (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (neopentalenolactone-D forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-deoxy-11-oxopentalenate + NADPH + H+ + O2

neopentalenolactone D + NADP+ + H2O
 

Neopentalenolactone D synthase is a FAD-dependent oxygenase.
