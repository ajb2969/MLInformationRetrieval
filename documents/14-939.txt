   Youla–Kucera parametrization      Youla–Kucera parametrization   In control theory the Youla–Kučera parametrization (also simply known as Youla parametrization ) is a formula that describes all possible stabilizing feedback controllers for a given plant P, as function of a single parameter Q.  Details  The YK parametrization is a general result. It is a fundamental result of control theory and launched an entirely new area of research and found application, among others, in optimal and robust control. 1  For ease of understanding and as suggested by Kučera it is best described for three increasingly general kinds of plant.  Stable SISO Plant  Let    P   (  s  )       P  s    P(s)   be a transfer function of a stable Single-input single-output system (SISO) system. Further, let Ω be a set of stable and proper functions of s . Then, the set of all proper stabilizing controllers for the plant    P   (  s  )       P  s    P(s)   can be defined as      {      Q   (  s  )     1  -   P   (  s  )   Q   (  s  )      ,   Q   (  s  )     ∈  Ω   }            Q  s     1    P  s  Q  s       Q  s    normal-Ω     \left\{\frac{Q(s)}{1-P(s)Q(s)},Q(s)\in\Omega\right\}   ,  where    Q   (  s  )       Q  s    Q(s)   is an arbitrary proper and stable function of s . It can be said, that    Q   (  s  )       Q  s    Q(s)   parametrizes all stabilizing controllers for the plant    P   (  s  )       P  s    P(s)   .  General SISO Plant  Consider a general plant with a transfer function    P   (  s  )       P  s    P(s)   . Further, the transfer function can be factorized as       P   (  s  )    =    N   (  s  )     M   (  s  )           P  s       N  s     M  s      P(s)=\frac{N(s)}{M(s)}   , where M(s), N(s) are stable and proper functions of s .  Now, solve the Bézout's identity of the form        𝐍   (  𝐬  )   𝐗   (  𝐬  )    +   𝐌   (  𝐬  )   𝐘   (  𝐬  )     =  𝟏          𝐍  𝐬  𝐗  𝐬     𝐌  𝐬  𝐘  𝐬    1    \mathbf{N(s)X(s)}+\mathbf{M(s)Y(s)}=\mathbf{1}    ,  where the variables to be found (X(s), Y(s)) must be also proper and stable.  After proper and stable X, Y were found, we can define one stabilizing controller that is of the form     C   (  s  )    =    X   (  s  )     Y   (  s  )           C  s       X  s     Y  s      C(s)=\frac{X(s)}{Y(s)}   . After we have one stabilizing controller at hand, we can define all stabilizing controllers using a parameter Q(s) that is proper and stable. The set of all stabilizing controllers is defined as      {       X   (  s  )    +   M   (  s  )   Q   (  s  )       Y   (  s  )    -   N   (  s  )   Q   (  s  )      ,   Q   (  s  )     ∈  Ω   }              X  s     M  s  Q  s        Y  s     N  s  Q  s       Q  s    normal-Ω     \left\{\frac{X(s)+M(s)Q(s)}{Y(s)-N(s)Q(s)},Q(s)\in\Omega\right\}   ,  General MIMO plant  In a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, consider a transfer matrix    𝐏   (  𝐬  )       𝐏  𝐬    \mathbf{P(s)}   . It can be factorized using right coprime factors     𝐏   (  𝐬  )    =   𝐍   (  𝐬  )    𝐃   -  𝟏     (  𝐬  )          𝐏  𝐬     𝐍  𝐬   superscript  𝐃    1    𝐬     \mathbf{P(s)=N(s)D^{-1}(s)}   or left factors     𝐏   (  𝐬  )    =     𝐃  ~    -  𝟏     (  𝐬  )    𝐍  ~    (  𝐬  )          𝐏  𝐬      superscript   normal-~  𝐃     1    𝐬   normal-~  𝐍   𝐬     \mathbf{P(s)=\tilde{D}^{-1}(s)\tilde{N}(s)}   . The factors must be proper, stable and doubly coprime, which ensures that the system P (s) is controllable and observable. This can be written by Bézout identity of the form        [     𝐗    𝐘       -   𝐍  ~       𝐃  ~      ]    [     𝐃     -   𝐘  ~        𝐍     𝐗  ~      ]    =   [     𝐈    0      0    𝐈     ]          delimited-[]    𝐗  𝐘       normal-~  𝐍     normal-~  𝐃       delimited-[]    𝐃     normal-~  𝐘      𝐍   normal-~  𝐗        delimited-[]    𝐈  0    0  𝐈       \left[\begin{matrix}\mathbf{X}&\mathbf{Y}\\
 -\mathbf{\tilde{N}}&{\mathbf{\tilde{D}}}\\
 \end{matrix}\right]\left[\begin{matrix}\mathbf{D}&-\mathbf{\tilde{Y}}\\
 \mathbf{N}&{\mathbf{\tilde{X}}}\\
 \end{matrix}\right]=\left[\begin{matrix}\mathbf{I}&0\\
 0&\mathbf{I}\\
 \end{matrix}\right]   .  After finding    𝐗  ,  𝐘  ,   𝐗  ~   ,   𝐘  ~      𝐗  𝐘   normal-~  𝐗    normal-~  𝐘     \mathbf{X,Y,\tilde{X},\tilde{Y}}   that are stable and proper, we can define the set of all stabilizing controllers K(s) using left or right factor, provided having negative feedback.           𝐊   (  𝐬  )    =     (   𝐗  -   𝚫   𝐍  ~     )    -  1     (   𝐘  +   𝚫   𝐃  ~     )            =    (    𝐘  ~   +   𝐃  𝚫    )     (    𝐗  ~   -   𝐍  𝚫    )    -  1             missing-subexpression       𝐊  𝐬      superscript    𝐗    𝚫   normal-~  𝐍       1      𝐘    𝚫   normal-~  𝐃          missing-subexpression     absent       normal-~  𝐘     𝐃  𝚫     superscript     normal-~  𝐗     𝐍  𝚫      1         \begin{aligned}&\displaystyle\mathbf{K(s)}={{\left(\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{\Delta%
 \tilde{N}}\right)}^{-1}}\left(\mathbf{Y}+\mathbf{\Delta\tilde{D}}\right)\\
 &\displaystyle=\left(\mathbf{\tilde{Y}}+\mathbf{D\Delta}\right){{\left(\mathbf%
 {\tilde{X}}-\mathbf{N\Delta}\right)}^{-1}}\end{aligned}     where   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is an arbitrary stable and proper parameter.  The engineering significance of the YK formula is that if one wants to find a stabilizing controller that meets some additional criterion, one can adjust Q such that the desired criterion is met.
