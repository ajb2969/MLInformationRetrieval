   Adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase      Adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase   In enzymology , an adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-(5-deoxy-D-ribos-5-yl)-L-homocysteine + adenine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are S-(5-deoxy-D-ribos-5-yl)-L-homocysteine and adenine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine homocysteinylribohydrolase . Other names in common use include S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (ambiguous) , S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase , 5'-methyladenosine nucleosidase , S-adenosylhomocysteine/5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase , and AdoHcy/MTA nucleosidase . This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
