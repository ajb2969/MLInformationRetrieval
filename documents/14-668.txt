Meixner–Pollaczek polynomials

In mathematics, the Meixner–Pollaczek polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials P(x,φ) introduced by , which up to elementary changes of variables are the same as the Pollaczek polynomials P(x,a,b) rediscovered by  in the case λ=1/2, and later generalized by him.
They are defined by






They are orthogonal on the real line with respect to the weight function


 
  and the orthogonality is given by
