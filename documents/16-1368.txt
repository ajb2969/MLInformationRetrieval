Kadison transitivity theorem

In mathematics, Kadison transitivity theorem is a result in the theory of C*-algebras that, in effect, asserts the equivalence of the notions of topological irreducibility and algebraic irreducibility of representations of C*-algebras. It implies that, for irreducible representations of C*-algebras, the only non-zero linear invariant subspace is the whole space.
The theorem, proved by Richard Kadison, was surprising as a priori there is no reason to believe that all topologically irreducible representations are also algebraically irreducible.
Statement
A family 
 
 
 
  of bounded operators on a Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  is said to act topologically irreducibly when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the only closed stable subspaces under 
 
 
 
 . The family 
 
 
 
  is said to act algebraically irreducibly if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the only linear manifolds in 
 
 
 
  stable under 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem. If the C*-algebra 
 
 
 
  acts topologically irreducibly on the Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  is a set of vectors and 
 
 
 
  is a linearly independent set of vectors in 
 
 
 
 , there is an 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  for some self-adjoint operator 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  can be chosen to be self-adjoint.
Corollary. If the C*-algebra 
 
 
 
  acts topologically irreducibly on the Hilbert space 
 
 
 
 , then it acts algebraically irreducibly.
