   Kadison transitivity theorem      Kadison transitivity theorem   In mathematics , Kadison transitivity theorem is a result in the theory of C*-algebras that, in effect, asserts the equivalence of the notions of topological irreducibility and algebraic irreducibility of representations of C*-algebras. It implies that, for irreducible representations of C*-algebras, the only non-zero linear invariant subspace is the whole space.  The theorem, proved by Richard Kadison , was surprising as a priori there is no reason to believe that all topologically irreducible representations are also algebraically irreducible.  Statement  A family   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of bounded operators on a Hilbert space   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   is said to act topologically irreducibly when    {  0  }     0    \{0\}   and   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   are the only closed stable subspaces under   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   . The family   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is said to act algebraically irreducibly if    {  0  }     0    \{0\}   and   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   are the only linear manifolds in   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   stable under   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  Theorem . If the C*-algebra   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   acts topologically irreducibly on the Hilbert space    ℋ  ,   {   y  1   ,  ⋯  ,   y  n   }      ℋ    subscript  y  1   normal-⋯   subscript  y  n      \mathcal{H},\{y_{1},\cdots,y_{n}\}   is a set of vectors and    {   x  1   ,  ⋯  ,   x  n   }      subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n     \{x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}\}   is a linearly independent set of vectors in   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , there is an   A   A   A   in   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   such that     A   x  j    =   y  j         A   subscript  x  j     subscript  y  j     Ax_{j}=y_{j}   . If     B   x  j    =   y  j         B   subscript  x  j     subscript  y  j     Bx_{j}=y_{j}   for some self-adjoint operator   B   B   B   , then   A   A   A   can be chosen to be self-adjoint.  Corollary . If the C*-algebra   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   acts topologically irreducibly on the Hilbert space   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , then it acts algebraically irreducibly.  References   Kadison, R.
