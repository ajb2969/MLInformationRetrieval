   Noise-equivalent flux density      Noise-equivalent flux density   In optics the noise-equivalent flux density (NEFD) or noise-equivalent irradiance (NEI) of a system is the level of flux density required to be equivalent to the noise present in the system. 1 It is a measure used by astronomers in determining the accuracy of observations. 2  The NEFD can be related to a light detector's Noise-equivalent power for a collection area A and a photon bandwidth   ν   ν   \nu   by:       N  E  F  D   =   η    N  E  P    A  ν           N  E  F  D     η      N  E  P     A  ν       NEFD=\eta\frac{NEP}{A\nu}   , where a factor   η   η   \eta   (often 2, in the case of switching between measuring a source and measuring off-source) accounts for the photon statistics for the mode of operation.
