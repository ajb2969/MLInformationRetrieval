N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase

N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (, GalNAc4S-6ST, CHST15 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:(dermatan)-4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) 3-phospho-5-adenylyl sulfate + [dermatan]-4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + [dermatan]-4,6-di-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine
 
(2) 3-phospho-5-adenylyl sulfate + [chondroitin]-4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + [chondroitin]-4,6-di-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine
 

The enzyme is activated by divalent cations and reduced glutathione.
