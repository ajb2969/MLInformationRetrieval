   Sombrero function      Sombrero function   A sombrero function (sometimes called besinc function or jinc function 1 ) is the 2-dimensional polar coordinate analog of the sinc function , and is so-called because it is shaped like a sombrero hat. This function is frequently used in image processing . 2 It can be defined through the Bessel function of the first kind       somb   (  ρ  )    =    2   J  1    (   π  ρ   )     π  ρ         somb  ρ       2   subscript  J  1     π  ρ      π  ρ      \operatorname{somb}(\rho)=\frac{2J_{1}(\pi\rho)}{\pi\rho}   .  where  x 2 + y 2 }} . The normalization factor   2   2   2   makes     s  o  m  b   (  0  )    =  1        s  o  m  b  0   1    somb(0)=1   . Sometimes the   π   π   π   factor is omitted, giving the following alternative definition:        somb  ′    (  ρ  )    =    2   J  1    (  ρ  )    ρ         superscript  somb  normal-′   ρ       2   subscript  J  1   ρ   ρ     \operatorname{somb}^{\prime}(\rho)=\frac{2J_{1}(\rho)}{\rho}   .
