The Heisenberg Hamiltonian, also known as the Heisenberg-Dirac Hamiltonian 1 is a variation of the usual Hamiltonian which describes the coupling energy between localised electrons, when their spin is taken into account. It is a form of the Exchange interaction.
It is given by;



where;



 
  is the energy difference between a singlet and triplet state


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the atomic spins at the nth lattice sites and lth closest neighbours.
