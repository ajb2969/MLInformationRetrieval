   Draft:Heisenberg Hamiltonian      Draft:Heisenberg Hamiltonian   The Heisenberg Hamiltonian , also known as the Heisenberg-Dirac Hamiltonian  1 is a variation of the usual Hamiltonian which describes the coupling energy between localised electrons, when their spin is taken into account. It is a form of the Exchange interaction .  It is given by;      H  =   -     J   e  x    2     ∑   n  →      ∑   l  →       s  →    n  →    ⋅    s  →     n  →   +   l  →              H         subscript  J    e  x    2     subscript    normal-→  n      subscript    normal-→  l     normal-⋅   subscript   normal-→  s    normal-→  n     subscript   normal-→  s      normal-→  n    normal-→  l            H=-\frac{J_{ex}}{2}\sum_{\vec{n}}\sum_{\vec{l}}\vec{s}_{\vec{n}}\cdot\vec{s}_{%
 \vec{n}+\vec{l}}     where;       J   e  x      subscript  J    e  x     J_{ex}   is the energy difference between a singlet and triplet state      S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   and    S  l     subscript  S  l    S_{l}   are the atomic spins at the nth lattice sites and lth closest neighbours.
