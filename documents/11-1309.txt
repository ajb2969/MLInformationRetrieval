   Lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase II      Lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase II   In enzymology , a lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase II () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + lipopolysaccharide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + alpha-D-glucosyl-lipopolysaccharide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and lipopolysaccharide , whereas its two products are UDP and alpha-D-glucosyl-lipopolysaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:galactosyl-lipopolysaccharide alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-galactosylpolysaccharide , and glucosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
