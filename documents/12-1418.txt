   Papyrus 20      Papyrus 20   Papyrus 20 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering ), designated by   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    20 , is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek . It is a papyrus  manuscript of the Epistle of James , but it only contains Chapter 2:19-3:9. The manuscript has been paleographically assigned to the early 3rd century. 1  Description  thumb|left|upright=0.5|recto The original size of the leaves was 17 by 12 cm.  The text is neatly written in upright semi-cursive letters. The main Nomina Sacra are used, but πατηρ/pater/father and ανθρωπος/anthropos/man are written out in full. 2  The Greek text of this codex is representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto-Alexandrian). Aland placed it in Category I . 3 This manuscript shows the greatest agreement with Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus , 4 but not with codices Ephraemi , Regius and other late Alexandrian manuscripts. 5  Philip Comfort has conjectured that the scribe who wrote   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    20 was also the same scribe who wrote    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    27 , where the Greek letters α, β, δ, ε, λ, ι, μ, ν, ο, π, ρ, σ, ψ, υ, φ, ω are formed identically in both manuscripts. 6  It is currently housed at the Princeton University Library (AM 4117) in Princeton . 7 8  See also   List of New Testament papyri  Princeton Papyri   References  Further reading   B.
