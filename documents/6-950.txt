Cylindrification

In computability theory a cylindrification is a construction that associates a cylindric numbering to each numbering. The concept was first introduced by Yuri L. Ershov in 1973.
Definition
Given a numbering 
 
 
 
  the cylindrification

 
  is defined as





 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Cantor pairing function. The cylindrification operation takes a relation as input of arity k and outputs a relation of arity k + 1 as follows : Given a relation R of arity K, its cylindrification denoted by c(R), is the following set {(a1,...,ak,a)|(a1,...,ak)belongs to R and a belongs to A}. Note that the cylindrification operation increases the arity of an input by 1.
Properties

Given two numberings 
 
 
 
  and
