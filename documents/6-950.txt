   Cylindrification      Cylindrification   In computability theory a cylindrification is a construction that associates a cylindric numbering to each numbering . The concept was first introduced by Yuri L. Ershov in 1973.  Definition  Given a numbering   ν   ν   \nu   the cylindrification     c   (  ν  )       c  ν    c(\nu)   is defined as       Domain   (   c   (  ν  )    )    :=   {   ⟨  n  ,  k  ⟩   |   n  ∈   Domain   (  ν  )     }      assign    Domain    c  ν     conditional-set   n  k     n    Domain  ν       \mathrm{Domain}(c(\nu)):=\{\langle n,k\rangle|n\in\mathrm{Domain}(\nu)\}          c   (  ν  )    ⟨  n  ,  k  ⟩    :=   ν   (  i  )       assign    c  ν   n  k      ν  i     c(\nu)\langle n,k\rangle:=\nu(i)   where    ⟨  n  ,  k  ⟩     n  k    \langle n,k\rangle   is the Cantor pairing function . The cylindrification operation takes a relation as input of arity k and outputs a relation of arity k + 1 as follows : Given a relation R of arity K, its cylindrification denoted by c(R), is the following set {(a1,...,ak,a)|(a1,...,ak)belongs to R and a belongs to A}. Note that the cylindrification operation increases the arity of an input by 1.  Properties   Given two numberings   ν   ν   \nu   and   μ   μ   \mu   then     ν  ≤  μ   ⇔    c   (  ν  )     ≤  1    c   (  μ  )        normal-⇔    ν  μ     subscript   1     c  ν     c  μ      \nu\leq\mu\Leftrightarrow c(\nu)\leq_{1}c(\mu)         ν   ≤  1    c   (  ν  )        subscript   1   ν    c  ν     \nu\leq_{1}c(\nu)      References   Yu.
