   Acetylpyruvate hydrolase      Acetylpyruvate hydrolase   In enzymology , an acetylpyruvate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetylpyruvate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + pyruvate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetylpyruvate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acetate and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,4-dioxopentanoate acetylhydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
