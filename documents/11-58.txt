Biotin—(methylmalonyl-CoA-carboxytransferase) ligase




Biotin—(methylmalonyl-CoA-carboxytransferase) ligase

In enzymology, a biotin-[methylmalonyl-CoA-carboxytransferase] ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + biotin + apo-[methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate carboxytransferase] 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + [methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate carboxytransferase]
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, biotin, and apo-[methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate carboxytransferase], whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate carboxytransferase.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is biotin:apo[methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate carboxytransferase] ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include biotin-[methylmalonyl-CoA-carboxyltransferase] synthetase, biotin-methylmalonyl coenzyme A carboxyltransferase synthetase, biotin-transcarboxylase synthetase, methylmalonyl coenzyme A holotranscarboxylase synthetase, biotin-[methylmalonyl-CoA-carboxyltransferase] ligase, biotin:apo[methylmalonyl-CoA:pyruvate carboxyltransferase] ligase, and (AMP-forming). This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism.
