   D-lactate-2-sulfatase      D-lactate-2-sulfatase   In enzymology , a D-lactate-2-sulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-2-O-sulfolactate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-lactate + sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-O-sulfolactate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (S)-lactate and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-O-sulfolactate 2-sulfohydrolase .
