   Groupoid scheme      Groupoid scheme   In algebraic geometry , a groupoid scheme is a pair of schemes     R  ,  U     R  U    R,U   together with five morphisms      s  ,  t   :   R  →   U  ,  e    :   U  →   R  ,  m    :    R   ×   U  ,  s  ,  t    R   →   R  ,  i    :   R  →  R        normal-:   s  t    normal-→  R   U  e      normal-:     normal-→  U   R  m      normal-:     normal-→    subscript    U  s  t    R  R    R  i      normal-:     normal-→  R  R      s,t:R\to U,e:U\to R,m:R\times_{U,s,t}R\to R,i:R\to R   satisfying     s  ∘  e   ,   t  ∘  e        s  e     t  e     s\circ e,t\circ e   are the identity morphisms,      s  ∘  m   =   s  ∘   p  1     ,    t  ∘  m   =   t  ∘   p  2        formulae-sequence      s  m     s   subscript  p  1         t  m     t   subscript  p  2       s\circ m=s\circ p_{1},t\circ m=t\circ p_{2}   and other obvious conditions that generalize the axioms of group action ; e.g., associativity. 1 In practice, it is usually written as    R  ⇉  U     normal-⇉  R  U    R\rightrightarrows U   (cf. coequalizer .)  Example: Suppose an algebraic group  G acts from the right on a scheme U . Then take    R  =   U  ×  G       R    U  G     R=U\times G   , s the projection, t the given action.  The main use of the notion is that it provides an atlas for a stack . More specifically, let    [   R  ⇉  U   ]     delimited-[]   normal-⇉  R  U     [R\rightrightarrows U]   be the category of     (   R  ⇉  U   )     normal-⇉  R  U    (R\rightrightarrows U)   -torsors . Then it is a category fibered in groupoids ; in fact, a Deligne–Mumford stack . Conversely, any DM stack is of this form.
