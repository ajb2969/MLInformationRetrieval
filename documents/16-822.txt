Groupoid scheme

In algebraic geometry, a groupoid scheme is a pair of schemes

 
  together with five morphisms

 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  are the identity morphisms, 
 
 
 
 
  and other obvious conditions that generalize the axioms of group action; e.g., associativity.1 In practice, it is usually written as 
 
 
 
  (cf. coequalizer.)
Example: Suppose an algebraic group G acts from the right on a scheme U. Then take 
 
 
 
 , s the projection, t the given action.
The main use of the notion is that it provides an atlas for a stack. More specifically, let 
 
 
 
  be the category of 

 
 -torsors. Then it is a category fibered in groupoids; in fact, a Deligneâ€“Mumford stack. Conversely, any DM stack is of this form.
