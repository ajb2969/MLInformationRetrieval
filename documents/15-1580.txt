Archaeosine synthase

Archaeosine synthase (, ArcS, TgtA2, MJ1022 (gene), glutamine:preQ0-tRNA amidinotransferase) is an enzyme with system name L-glutamine:7-cyano-7-carbaguanine aminotransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-glutamine + 7-cyano-7-carbaguanine15 in tRNA + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-glutamate + archaeine15 in tRNA
 

In Euryarchaeota the reaction is catalysed by ArcS.
