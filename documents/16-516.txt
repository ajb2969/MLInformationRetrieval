Checkerboard score

In biodiversity studies, the checkerboard score or C-score is a statistic which determines the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a collection of biomes. The statistic, first published by Stone and Roberts in 1990,1 expands on the earlier work of Diamond2 that defined a notion of "checkerboard distributions" as an indicator of species competition.
A higher c-score indicates a lower randomness, i.e. a greater likelihood that the distribution of one species has been directly affected by the presence of other species.
Definition and calculation
Given two species sp1, sp2 and n islands, an incident matrix is built. In the 2xn incident matrix, each row represents one of the two species and each column represents a different island. The matrix is then filled with each cell being set to either 0 or 1. Cell with the value of 0 means that a given species doesn't exist in the given island whilst the value of 1 means that the species do exist in the given island.
The calculation of the co-occurrence of two species sp1, sp2 in the given set of islands is done as follows:




 - C-score for the two species sp1, sp2 in the given set of islands
 
 - The number of co-occurrences of sp1, sp2

 - Number of islands in which sp1 has 1
 
 - Number of islands in which sp2 has 1
 

The checkerboard score (c-score) for the colonisation pattern is then calculated as the mean number of checkerboard units per species-pair in the community:
For M species, there are  M(M-1)/2}} species-pairs, so C-score is calculated:
$$C =\sum_{j=0}^{M} \sum_{i
 
 The C-score is sensitive to the proportion of islands that are occupied, thereby confounding comparisons between matrices or sets of species pairs within them.  An extension of the C-score therefore standardizes by the number of islands each species-pair occupies using:{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=Mark|last2=Moore|first2=Jonathan W.|last3=Leidy|first3=Robert A.|title=Nestedness patterns and the dual nature of community reassembly in California streams: a multivariate permutation-based approach|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=17|year=2011|pages=3714â€“3723|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02482.x}}
