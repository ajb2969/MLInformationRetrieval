   Delta14-sterol reductase      Delta14-sterol reductase   In enzymology , a Delta14-sterol reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,14,24-trien-3beta-ol + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,14,24-trien-3beta-ol , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4,4-dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol:NADP+ Delta14-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .
