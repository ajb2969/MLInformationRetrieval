(KDO)-lipid IVA 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid transferase

(KDO)-lipid IVA 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid transferase (, KDO transferase, waaA (gene), kdtA (gene), Kdo transferase, 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid transferase, 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonic acid transferase) is an enzyme with system name CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonate:(KDO)-lipid IVA 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonate transferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + CMP-alpha-Kdo 
 
 
 
  alpha-Kdo-(2->4)-alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + CMP
 

The bifunctional enzyme from Escherichia coli transfers two 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonate residues to lipid IVA.
