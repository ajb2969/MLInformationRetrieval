   Occurrences of Grandi's series      Occurrences of Grandi's series   Parables  Guido Grandi illustrated the series with a parable involving two brothers who share a gem.  Thomson's lamp is a supertask in which a hypothetical lamp is turned on and off infinitely many times in a finite time span. One can think of turning the lamp on as adding 1 to its state, and turning it off as subtracting 1. Instead of asking the sum of the series, one asks the final state of the lamp. 1  One of the best-known classic parables to which infinite series have been applied, Achilles and the tortoise , can also be adapted to the case of Grandi's series. 2  Numerical series  The Cauchy product of Grandi's series with itself is 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + · · · . 3  Several series resulting from the introduction of zeros into Grandi's series have interesting properties; for these see Summation of Grandi's series#Dilution .  Grandi's series is just one example of a divergent geometric series .  The rearranged series 1 − 1 − 1 + 1 + 1 − 1 − 1 + · · · occurs in Euler's 1775 treatment of the pentagonal number theorem as the value of the Euler function at q = 1.  Power series  The power series most famously associated with Grandi's series is its ordinary generating function ,        f   (  x  )    =      1  -  x   +   x  2    -   x  3    +  ⋯   =   1   1  +  x     .          f  x           1  x    superscript  x  2     superscript  x  3    normal-⋯          1    1  x       f(x)=1-x+x^{2}-x^{3}+\cdots=\frac{1}{1+x}.     Fourier series  Hyperbolic sine  In his 1822 Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur , Joseph Fourier obtains what we now call a Fourier sine series for a scaled version of the hyperbolic sine function,        f   (  x  )    =    π   2   sinh  π      sinh  x     .        f  x       π    2    π       x      f(x)=\frac{\pi}{2\sinh\pi}\sinh x.     He finds that the general coefficient of sin nx in the series is          (   -  1   )    n  -  1     (      1  n   -   1   n  3     +   1   n  5     -  ⋯   )    =     (   -  1   )    n  -  1     n   1  +   n  2       .         superscript    1     n  1            1  n     1   superscript  n  3       1   superscript  n  5     normal-⋯       superscript    1     n  1      n    1   superscript  n  2        (-1)^{n-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n^{3}}+\frac{1}{n^{5}}-\cdots\right)=(-1)%
 ^{n-1}\frac{n}{1+n^{2}}.     For n > 1 the above series converges, while the coefficient of sin x appears as 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · and so is expected to be 1 ⁄ 2 . In fact, this is correct, as can be demonstrated by directly calculating the Fourier coefficient from an integral:         2  π     ∫  0  π    f   (  x  )    sin    x   d  x       =      1   2   sinh  π      (     cosh  x    sin  x    -    sinh  x    cos  x     )    |   0  π   =   1  2    .            2  π     superscript   subscript   0   π     f  x      x  d  x        evaluated-at      1    2    π           x     x        x     x      0  π          1  2      \frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}f(x)\sin x\;dx=\frac{1}{2\sinh\pi}\left.(\cosh x%
 \sin x-\sinh x\cos x)\right|_{0}^{\pi}=\frac{1}{2}.    4  Dirac comb  Grandi's series occurs more directly in another important series,         cos  x   +   cos   2  x    +   cos   3  x    +  ⋯   =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞    cos   (   k  x   )      .          x       2  x        3  x    normal-⋯     superscript   subscript     k  1          k  x       \cos x+\cos 2x+\cos 3x+\cdots=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\cos(kx).     At x = π, the series reduces to −1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − · · · and so one might expect it to meaningfully equal − 1 ⁄ 2 . In fact, Euler held that this series obeyed the formal relation Σ cos kx = − 1 ⁄ 2 , while d'Alembert rejected the relation, and Lagrange wondered if it could be defended by an extension of the geometric series similar to Euler's reasoning with Grandi's numerical series. 5  Euler's claim suggests that       1  +   2    ∑   k  =  1   ∞    cos   (   k  x   )       =   0  ?         1    2    superscript   subscript     k  1          k  x         0  normal-?     1+2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\cos(kx)=0?     for all x . This series is divergent everywhere, while its Cesàro sum is indeed 0 for almost all x . However, the series diverges to infinity at x = 2π n in a significant way: it is the Fourier series of a Dirac comb . The ordinary, Cesàro, and Abel sums of this series involve limits of the Dirichlet , Fejér , and Poisson kernels , respectively. 6  Dirichlet series  Multiplying the terms of Grandi's series by 1/ n z yields the Dirichlet series        η   (  z  )    =      1  -   1   2  z     +   1   3  z     -   1   4  z     +  ⋯   =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  -  1     n  z      ,          η  z           1    1   superscript  2  z       1   superscript  3  z       1   superscript  4  z     normal-⋯          superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1     superscript  n  z        \eta(z)=1-\frac{1}{2^{z}}+\frac{1}{3^{z}}-\frac{1}{4^{z}}+\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^{%
 \infty}\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^{z}},   which converges only for complex numbers z with a positive real part. Grandi's series is recovered by letting z = 0.  Unlike the geometric series, the Dirichlet series for η is not useful for determining what 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · "should" be. Even on the right half-plane, η( z ) is not given by any elementary expression, and there is no immediate evidence of its limit as z approaches 0. 7 On the other hand, if one uses stronger methods of summability, then the Dirichlet series for η defines a function on the whole complex plane — the Dirichlet eta function — and moreover, this function is analytic . For z with real part > −1 it suffices to use Cesàro summation, and so η(0) = 1 ⁄ 2 after all.  The function η is related to a more famous Dirichlet series and function:         η   (  z  )      =      1  +   1   2  z    +   1   3  z    +   1   4  z    +  ⋯   -    2   2  z     (   1  +   1   2  z    +  ⋯   )          =       (   1  -   2   2  z     )   ζ   (  z  )    ,           η  z        1    1   superscript  2  z      1   superscript  3  z      1   superscript  4  z    normal-⋯       2   superscript  2  z      1    1   superscript  2  z    normal-⋯        missing-subexpression        1    2   superscript  2  z     ζ  z      \begin{array}[]{rcl}\eta(z)&=&\displaystyle 1+\frac{1}{2^{z}}+\frac{1}{3^{z}}+%
 \frac{1}{4^{z}}+\cdots-\frac{2}{2^{z}}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^{z}}+\cdots\right)\\
 &=&\displaystyle\left(1-\frac{2}{2^{z}}\right)\zeta(z),\end{array}     where ζ is the Riemann zeta function . Keeping Grandi's series in mind, this relation explains why ζ(0) = − 1 ⁄ 2 ; see also 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · . The relation also implies a much more important result. Since η( z ) and (1 − 2 1− z ) are both analytic on the entire plane and the latter function's only zero is a simple zero at z = 1, it follows that ζ( z ) is meromorphic with only a simple pole at z = 1. 8  Euler characteristics  Given a CW complex  S containing one vertex, one edge, one face, and generally exactly one cell of every dimension, Euler's formula  for the Euler characteristic of S returns . There are a few motivations for defining a generalized Euler characteristic for such a space that turns out to be 1/2.  One approach comes from combinatorial geometry . The open interval (0, 1) has an Euler characteristic of −1, so its power set 2 (0, 1) should have an Euler characteristic of 2 −1 = 1/2. The appropriate power set to take is the "small power set" of finite subsets of the interval, which consists of the union of a point (the empty set), an open interval (the set of singetons), an open triangle, and so on. So the Euler characteristic of the small power set is . James Propp defines a regularized Euler measure for polyhedral sets that, in this example, replaces  with , sums the series for | t | A ) = 2 χ( A ) for any polyhedral set A , and the base of the exponent generalizes to other sets as well. 9  Infinite-dimensional  real projective space  RP ∞ is another structure with one cell of every dimension and therefore an Euler characteristic of . This space can be described as the quotient of the infinite-dimensional  sphere by identifying each pair of antipodal points . Since the infinite-dimensional sphere is contractible , its Euler characteristic is 1, and its 2-to-1 quotient should have an Euler characteristic of 1/2. 10  This description of RP ∞ also makes it the classifying space of Z 2 , the cyclic group  of order 2 . Tom Leinster gives a definition of the Euler characteristic of any category which bypasses the classifying space and reduces to 1/| G | for any group when viewed as a one-object category. In this sense the Euler characteristic of Z 2 is itself 1 ⁄ 2 . 11  In physics  Grandi's series, and generalizations thereof, occur frequently in many branches of physics; most typically in the discussions of quantized fermion fields (for example, the chiral bag model ), which have both positive and negative eigenvalues ; although similar series occur also for bosons , such as in the Casimir effect .  The general series is discussed in greater detail in the article on spectral asymmetry , whereas methods used to sum it are discussed in the articles on regularization and, in particular, the zeta function regulator .  In art  Jliat 's 2000 musical single Still Life #7: The Grandi Series advertises itself as "conceptual art"; it consists of nearly an hour of silence. 12  Notes  References            "  Grandi's series, Occurrences of     Rucker p.297 ↩  Saichev pp. 255–259 ↩  Hardy p.3 ↩  Bromwich p. 320 ↩  Ferraro 2005 p.17 ↩  Davis pp. 153–159 ↩  Knopp (p.458) makes this point to criticize Euler's use of analytical expressions to evaluate numerical series, saying "it need not at any rate be + 1 ⁄ 2 ." ↩  Knopp pp. 491–492 ↩  Propp pp. 7–8, 12 ↩  ↩   ↩  Review by George Zahora ↩
