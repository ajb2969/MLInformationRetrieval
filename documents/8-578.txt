Bach tensor

In differential geometry and general relativity, the Bach tensor is a trace-free tensor of rank 2 which is conformally invariant in dimension .1 Before 1968, it was the only known conformally invariant tensor that is algebraically independent of the Weyl tensor.2 In abstract indices the Bach tensor is given by


 
  where 

 is the Weyl tensor, and 

 the Schouten tensor given in terms of the Ricci tensor 

 and scalar curvature
