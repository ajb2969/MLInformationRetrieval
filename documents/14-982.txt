Limiting parallel

(Figure)
The two lines through a given point P and limiting parallel to line R.

In neutral or absolute geometry, and in hyperbolic geometry, there may be many lines parallel to a given line 
 
 
 
  through a point 
 
 
 
  not on line 
 
 
 
 
 ; however, in the plane, two parallels may be closer to 
 
 
 
  than all others (one in each direction of 
 
 
 
 ).
Thus it is useful to make a new definition concerning parallels in neutral geometry. If there are closest parallels to a given line they are known as the limiting parallel, asymptotic parallel or horoparallel (horo from  â€” border).
For rays, the relation of limiting parallel is an equivalence relation, which includes the equivalence relation of being coterminal.
Limiting parallels may form two, or three sides of a limit triangle.

A rays

 
  is a limiting parallel to a ray 
 
 
 
 
  if they are coterminal or if they lie on distinct lines not equal to the line 
 
 
 
 , they do not meet, and every ray in the interior of the angle 
 
 
 
  meets the ray 
 
 
 
 .1
Properties
Distinct lines carrying limiting parallel rays do not meet.
Proof
Suppose that the lines carrying distinct parallel rays met. By definition the cannot meet on the side of 
 
 
 
  which either 
 
 
 
 
  is on. Then they must meet on the side of 
 
 
 
  opposite to 
 
 
 
 , call this point 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
 . Contradiction.
