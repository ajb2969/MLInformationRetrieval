   Limiting parallel      Limiting parallel   (Figure)  The two lines through a given point P and limiting parallel to line R .   In neutral or absolute geometry , and in hyperbolic geometry , there may be many lines parallel to a given line   l   l   l   through a point   P   P   P   not on line   R   R   R   ; however, in the plane, two parallels may be closer to   l   l   l   than all others (one in each direction of   R   R   R   ).  Thus it is useful to make a new definition concerning parallels in neutral geometry. If there are closest parallels to a given line they are known as the limiting parallel , asymptotic parallel or horoparallel (horo from  — border).  For rays , the relation of limiting parallel is an equivalence relation , which includes the equivalence relation of being coterminal.  Limiting parallels may form two, or three sides of a limit triangle .  Definition  (Figure)  The ray Aa is a limiting parallel to Bb , written    A  a  |  |  |  B  b     fragments  A  a  normal-|  normal-|  normal-|  B  b    Aa|||Bb      A rays     A  a      A  a    Aa   is a limiting parallel to a ray    B  b      B  b    Bb   if they are coterminal or if they lie on distinct lines not equal to the line    A  B      A  B    AB   , they do not meet, and every ray in the interior of the angle    B  A  a      B  A  a    BAa   meets the ray    B  b      B  b    Bb   . 1  Properties  Distinct lines carrying limiting parallel rays do not meet.  Proof  Suppose that the lines carrying distinct parallel rays met. By definition the cannot meet on the side of    A  B      A  B    AB   which either   a   a   a   is on. Then they must meet on the side of    A  B      A  B    AB   opposite to   a   a   a   , call this point   C   C   C   . Thus      ∠  C  A  B   +   ∠  C  B  A    <   2  right angles   ⇒    ∠  a  A  B   +   ∠  b  B  A    >   2  right angles             normal-∠  C  A  B     normal-∠  C  B  A      2  right angles     normal-⇒        normal-∠  a  A  B     normal-∠  b  B  A           2  right angles      \angle CAB+\angle CBA<2\text{ right angles}\Rightarrow\angle aAB+\angle bBA>2%
