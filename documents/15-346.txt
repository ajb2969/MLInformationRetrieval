Topological complexity

In mathematics, topological complexity of a topological space X (also denoted by TC(X)) is a topological invariant closely connected to the motion planning problem, introduced by Michal Farber in 2003.
Definition
Let X be a topological space and 
 
 
 
  be the space of all continuous paths in X. Define the projection 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . The topological complexity is the minimal number k such that

there exists an open cover

 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 ,
for each 
 
 
 
 , there exists a local section



Examples

The topological complexity: TC(X) = 1 if and only if X is contractible.
The topological complexity of the sphere

 
  is 2 for n odd and 3 for n even. For example, in the case of the circle

 
 
 , we may define a path between two points to be the geodesics, if it is unique. Any pair of antipodal points can be connected by a counter-clockwise path.
If 
 
 
 
  is the configuration space of n distinct points in the Euclidean m-space, then










For the Klein bottle, the topological complexity is not known (July 2012).
