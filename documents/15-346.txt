   Topological complexity      Topological complexity   In mathematics, topological complexity of a topological space  X (also denoted by TC( X )) is a topological invariant closely connected to the motion planning problem, introduced by Michal Farber in 2003.  Definition  Let X be a topological space and     P  X   =   {  γ  :    [  0  ,  1  ]   →  X   }         P  X    conditional-set  γ   normal-→   0  1   X      PX=\{\gamma:[0,1]\,\to\,X\}   be the space of all continuous paths in X . Define the projection    π  :    P  X   →   X  ×  X       normal-:  π   normal-→    P  X     X  X      \pi:PX\to\,X\times X   by     π   (  γ  )    =   (   γ   (  0  )    ,   γ   (  1  )    )         π  γ      γ  0     γ  1      \pi(\gamma)=(\gamma(0),\gamma(1))   . The topological complexity is the minimal number k such that   there exists an open cover      {   U  i   }    i  =  1   k     superscript   subscript    subscript  U  i      i  1    k    \{U_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}   of    X  ×  X      X  X    X\times X   ,  for each    i  =   1  ,  …  ,  k       i   1  normal-…  k     i=1,\ldots,k   , there exists a local section       s  i   :    U  i   →   P  X     .     normal-:   subscript  s  i    normal-→   subscript  U  i     P  X      s_{i}:\,U_{i}\to\,PX.      Examples   The topological complexity: TC( X ) = 1 if and only if X is contractible .  The topological complexity of the sphere     S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   is 2 for n odd and 3 for n even. For example, in the case of the circle     S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   , we may define a path between two points to be the geodesics , if it is unique. Any pair of antipodal points can be connected by a counter-clockwise path.  If    F   (    \R   m   ,  n  )       F    superscript  \R  m   n     F(\R^{m},n)   is the configuration space of n distinct points in the Euclidean m -space, then          T  C   (   F   (    \R   m   ,  n  )    )    =   {       2  n   -  1       for    m   odd         2  n   -  2        for    m   even   .             T  C    F    superscript  \R  m   n      cases      2  n   1     for  m  odd       2  n   2     for  m  even      TC(F(\R^{m},n))=\begin{cases}2n-1&\mathrm{for\,\,{\it m}\,\,odd}\\
 2n-2&\mathrm{for\,\,{\it m}\,\,even.}\end{cases}         For the Klein bottle , the topological complexity is not known (July 2012).   References    Armindo Costa: Topological Complexity of Configuration Spaces , Ph.D. Thesis, Durham University (2010), online   "  Category:Topology
