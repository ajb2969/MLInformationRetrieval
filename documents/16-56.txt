(-)-gamma-cadinene synthase ((2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing)




(-)-gamma-cadinene synthase ((2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing)

(-)-gamma-cadinene synthase ((2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing) (, (-)-gamma-cadinene cyclase) is an enzyme with system name (2Z,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((-)-gamma-cadinene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-gamma-cadinene + [diphosphate]
 

This enzyme is isolated from the liverwort Heteroscyphus planus.
