   André–Quillen cohomology      André–Quillen cohomology   In commutative algebra , André–Quillen cohomology is a theory of cohomology for commutative rings which is closely related to the cotangent complex . The first three cohomology groups were introduced by  and are sometimes called Lichtenbaum–Schlessinger functors  T 0 , T 1 , T 2 , and the higher groups were defined independently by Michel André and by Daniel Quillen using methods of homotopy theory . It comes with a parallel homology theory called André–Quillen homology .  Motivation  Let A be a commutative ring, B be an A -algebra, and M be a B -module. André–Quillen cohomology is the derived functors of the derivation functor Der A ( B , M ). Before the general definitions of André and Quillen, it was known for a long time that given morphisms of commutative rings  and a C -module M , there is a three-term exact sequence of derivation modules:       0  →    Der  B    (  C  ,  M  )    →    Der  A    (  C  ,  M  )    →    Der  A    (  B  ,  M  )     .       normal-→  0    subscript  Der  B   C  M     normal-→      subscript  Der  A   C  M     normal-→      subscript  Der  A   B  M      0\to\operatorname{Der}_{B}(C,M)\to\operatorname{Der}_{A}(C,M)\to\operatorname{%
 Der}_{A}(B,M).   This term can be extended to a six-term exact sequence using the functor Exalcomm of extensions of commutative algebras and a nine-term exact sequence using the Lichtenbaum–Schlessinger functors . André–Quillen cohomology extends this exact sequence even further. In the zeroth degree, it is the module of derivations; in the first degree, it is Exalcomm; and in the second degree, it is the second degree Lichtenbaum–Schlessinger functor.  Definition  Let B be an A -algebra, and let M be a B -module. Let P be a simplicial cofibrant A -algebra resolution of B . André notates the q th cohomology group of B over A with coefficients in M by , while Quillen notates the same group as . The q th André–Quillen cohomology group is:         D  q    (   B  /  A   ,  M  )    =    H  q    (  A  ,  B  ,  M  )     =  def     H  q    (    Der  A    (  P  ,  M  )    )     .           superscript  D  q      B  A   M       superscript  H  q    A  B  M       superscript   def        superscript  H  q     subscript  Der  A   P  M       D^{q}(B/A,M)=H^{q}(A,B,M)\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}H^{q}(\operatorname{Der}_{A}(%
 P,M)).   The q th André–Quillen homology group is:         D  q    (   B  /  A   ,  M  )    =    H  q    (  A  ,  B  ,  M  )     =  def     H  q    (    Ω   P  /  A     ⊗  B   M   )     .           subscript  D  q      B  A   M       subscript  H  q    A  B  M       superscript   def        subscript  H  q     subscript  tensor-product  B    subscript  normal-Ω    P  A    M       D_{q}(B/A,M)=H_{q}(A,B,M)\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}H_{q}(\Omega_{P/A}\otimes_{B}%
 M).     Let denote the relative cotangent complex of B over A . Then we have the formulas:         D  q    (   B  /  A   ,  M  )    =    H  q    (    Hom  B    (   L   B  /  A    ,  M  )    )     ,         superscript  D  q      B  A   M       superscript  H  q     subscript  Hom  B    subscript  L    B  A    M      D^{q}(B/A,M)=H^{q}(\operatorname{Hom}_{B}(L_{B/A},M)),            D  q    (   B  /  A   ,  M  )    =    H  q    (    L   B  /  A     ⊗  B   M   )     .         subscript  D  q      B  A   M       subscript  H  q     subscript  tensor-product  B    subscript  L    B  A    M      D_{q}(B/A,M)=H_{q}(L_{B/A}\otimes_{B}M).
