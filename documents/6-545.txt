   Hilbert modular form      Hilbert modular form   In mathematics , a Hilbert modular form is a generalization of modular forms to functions of two or more variables.  It is a (complex) analytic function on the m -fold product of upper half-planes    ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   satisfying a certain kind of functional equation .  Let F be a totally real number field of degree m over rational field. Let       σ  1   ,  …  ,   σ  m       subscript  σ  1   normal-…   subscript  σ  m     \sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{m}     be the real embeddings of F . Through them we have a map      G   L  2    (  F  )       G   subscript  L  2   F    GL_{2}(F)   →     G   L  2     (  ℝ  )   m    .      G   subscript  L  2    superscript  ℝ  m     GL_{2}(\mathbb{R})^{m}.     Let    𝒪  F     subscript  𝒪  F    \mathcal{O}_{F}   be the ring of integers of F . The group    G   L  2  +    (   𝒪  F   )       G   superscript   subscript  L  2      subscript  𝒪  F     GL_{2}^{+}(\mathcal{O}_{F})   is called the full Hilbert modular group . For every element    z  =   (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  m   )   ∈   ℋ  m         z    subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  m          superscript  ℋ  m      z=(z_{1},\dots,z_{m})\in\mathcal{H}^{m}   , there is a group action of    G   L  2  +    (   𝒪  F   )       G   superscript   subscript  L  2      subscript  𝒪  F     GL_{2}^{+}(\mathcal{O}_{F})   defined by     γ  ⋅  z   =   (    σ  1    (  γ  )    z  1    ,  …  ,    σ  m    (  γ  )    z  m    )        normal-⋅  γ  z       subscript  σ  1   γ   subscript  z  1    normal-…     subscript  σ  m   γ   subscript  z  m       \gamma\cdot z=(\sigma_{1}(\gamma)z_{1},\dots,\sigma_{m}(\gamma)z_{m})     For    g  =   (     a    b      c    d     )   ∈   G   L  2    (  ℝ  )          g    a  b    c  d           G   subscript  L  2   ℝ      g=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}\in GL_{2}(\mathbb{R})   , define       j   (  g  ,  z  )    =   det     (  g  )    -   1  /  2      (    c  z   +  d   )           j   g  z         superscript  g      1  2         c  z   d       j(g,z)=\det(g)^{-1/2}(cz+d)     A Hilbert modular form of weight    (   k  1   ,  …  ,   k  m   )      subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  m     (k_{1},\dots,k_{m})   is an analytic function on    ℋ  m     superscript  ℋ  m    \mathcal{H}^{m}   such that for every    γ  ∈   G   L  2  +    (   𝒪  F   )        γ    G   superscript   subscript  L  2      subscript  𝒪  F      \gamma\in GL_{2}^{+}(\mathcal{O}_{F})           f   (   γ  z   )    =    ∏   i  =  1   m    j    (    σ  i    (  γ  )    ,   z  i   )    k  i    f   (  z  )      .        f    γ  z      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m     j   superscript      subscript  σ  i   γ    subscript  z  i     subscript  k  i    f  z      f(\gamma z)=\prod_{i=1}^{m}j(\sigma_{i}(\gamma),z_{i})^{k_{i}}f(z).     Unlike the modular form case, no extra condition is needed for the cusps because of Koecher's principle .  History  These modular forms, for real quadratic fields , were first treated in the 1901 Göttingen University  Habilitationssschrift of Otto Blumenthal . There he mentions that David Hilbert had considered them initially in work from 1893-4, which remained unpublished. Blumenthal's work was published in 1903. For this reason Hilbert modular forms are now often called Hilbert-Blumenthal modular forms .  The theory remained dormant for some decades; Erich Hecke appealed to it in his early work, but major interest in Hilbert modular forms awaited the development of complex manifold theory.
