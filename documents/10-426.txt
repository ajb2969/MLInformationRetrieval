   Pollaczek–Khinchine formula      Pollaczek–Khinchine formula   In queueing theory , a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , the Pollaczek–Khinchine formula states a relationship between the queue length and service time distribution Laplace transforms for an M/G/1 queue (where jobs arrive according to a Poisson process and have general service time distribution). The term is also used to refer to the relationships between the mean queue length and mean waiting/service time in such a model. 1  The formula was first published by Felix Pollaczek in 1930 2 and recast in probabilistic terms by Aleksandr Khinchin 3 two years later. 4 5 In ruin theory the formula can be used to compute the probability of ultimate ruin (probability of an insurance company going bankrupt). 6  Mean queue length  The formula states that the mean queue length L is given by 7      L  =   ρ  +     ρ  2   +    λ  2    Var   (  S  )       2   (   1  -  ρ   )          L    ρ       superscript  ρ  2      superscript  λ  2    Var  S       2    1  ρ        L=\rho+\frac{\rho^{2}+\lambda^{2}\operatorname{Var}(S)}{2(1-\rho)}     where      λ   λ   \lambda   is the arrival rate of the Poisson process      1  /  μ      1  μ    1/\mu   is the mean of the service time distribution S      ρ  =   λ  /  μ       ρ    λ  μ     \rho=\lambda/\mu   is the utilization  Var( S ) is the variance of the service time distribution S .   For the mean queue length to be finite it is necessary that    ρ  <  1      ρ  1    \rho<1   as otherwise jobs arrive faster than they leave the queue. "Traffic intensity," ranges between 0 and 1, and is the mean fraction of time that the server is busy. If the arrival rate    λ  a     subscript  λ  a    \lambda_{a}   is greater than or equal to the service rate    λ  s     subscript  λ  s    \lambda_{s}   , the queuing delay becomes infinite. The variance term enters the expression due to Feller's paradox . 8  Mean waiting time  If we write W for the mean time a customer spends in the queue, then    W  =    W  ′   +   μ   -  1         W     superscript  W  normal-′    superscript  μ    1       W=W^{\prime}+\mu^{-1}   where    W  ′     superscript  W  normal-′    W^{\prime}   is the mean waiting time (time spent in the queue waiting for service) and   μ   μ   \mu   is the service rate. Using Little's law , which states that      L  =   λ  W       L    λ  W     L=\lambda W   where   L is the mean queue length     λ   λ   \lambda   is the arrival rate of the Poisson process  W is the mean time spent at the queue both waiting and being serviced,   so       W  =     ρ  +   λ  μ  Var   (  S  )      2   (   μ  -  λ   )     +   μ   -  1      .      W        ρ    λ  μ  Var  S      2    μ  λ      superscript  μ    1       W=\frac{\rho+\lambda\mu\text{Var}(S)}{2(\mu-\lambda)}+\mu^{-1}.   We can write an expression for the mean waiting time as 9        W  ′   =    L  λ   -   μ   -  1     =    ρ  +   λ  μ  Var   (  S  )      2   (   μ  -  λ   )      .         superscript  W  normal-′       L  λ    superscript  μ    1              ρ    λ  μ  Var  S      2    μ  λ        W^{\prime}=\frac{L}{\lambda}-\mu^{-1}=\frac{\rho+\lambda\mu\text{Var}(S)}{2(%
 \mu-\lambda)}.     Queue length transform  Writing π( z ) for the probability-generating function of the number of customers in the queue 10       π   (  z  )    =     (   1  -  z   )    (   1  -  ρ   )   g   (   λ   (   1  -  z   )    )      g   (   λ   (   1  -  z   )    )    -  z          π  z         1  z     1  ρ   g    λ    1  z         g    λ    1  z     z      \pi(z)=\frac{(1-z)(1-\rho)g(\lambda(1-z))}{g(\lambda(1-z))-z}     where g( s ) is the Laplace transform of the service time probability density function. 11  Sojourn time transform  Writing W * ( s ) for the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the waiting time distribution, 12        W  ∗    (  s  )    =     (   1  -  ρ   )   s  g   (  s  )     s  -   λ   (   1  -   g   (  s  )     )             superscript  W  normal-∗   s         1  ρ   s  g  s     s    λ    1    g  s         W^{\ast}(s)=\frac{(1-\rho)sg(s)}{s-\lambda(1-g(s))}     where again g( s ) is the Laplace transform of service time probability density function. n th moments can be obtained by differentiating the transform n times, multiplying by (−1) n and evaluating at s = 0.
