   Singular cardinals hypothesis      Singular cardinals hypothesis   In set theory , the singular cardinals hypothesis (SCH) arose from the question of whether the least cardinal number for which the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) might fail could be a singular cardinal .  According to Mitchell (1992), the singular cardinals hypothesis is:   If Œ∫ is any singular strong limit cardinal , then 2 Œ∫ = Œ∫ + .   Here, Œ∫ + denotes the successor cardinal of Œ∫.  Since SCH is a consequence of GCH which is known to be consistent with ZFC , SCH is consistent with ZFC. The negation of SCH has also been shown to be consistent with ZFC, if one assumes the existence of a sufficiently large cardinal number. In fact, by results of Moti Gitik , ZFC + the negation of SCH is equiconsistent with ZFC + the existence of a measurable cardinal Œ∫ of Mitchell order Œ∫ ++ .  Another form of the SCH is the following statement:   2 cf(Œ∫) cf(Œ∫) = Œ∫ + ,   where cf denotes the cofinality function. Note that Œ∫ cf(Œ∫) = 2 Œ∫ for all singular strong limit cardinals Œ∫. The second formulation of SCH is strictly stronger than the first version, since the first one only mentions strong limits; from a model in which the first version of SCH fails at ‚Ñµ œâ and GCH holds above ‚Ñµ œâ+2 , we can construct a model in which the first version of SCH holds but the second version of SCH fails, by adding ‚Ñµ œâ Cohen subsets to ‚Ñµ n for some n.  Silver proved that if Œ∫ is singular with uncountable cofinality and 2 Œª = Œª + for all infinite cardinals Œª Œ∫ = Œ∫ + . Silver's original proof used generic ultrapowers . The following important fact follows from Silver's theorem: if the singular cardinals hypothesis holds for all singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all singular cardinals. In particular, then, if   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is the least counterexample to the singular cardinals hypothesis, then     c  f   (  Œ∫  )    =  œâ        c  f  Œ∫   œâ    cf(\kappa)=\omega   .  The negation of the singular cardinals hypothesis is intimately related to violating the GCH at a measurable cardinal. A well-known result of Dana Scott is that if the GCH holds below a measurable cardinal   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   on a set of measure one‚Äîi.e., there is normal   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   -complete ultrafilter D on    ùí´   (  Œ∫  )       ùí´  Œ∫    \mathcal{P}(\kappa)   such that     {   Œ±  <  Œ∫   :    2  Œ±   =   Œ±  +    }   ‚àà  D       conditional-set    Œ±  Œ∫      superscript  2  Œ±    superscript  Œ±      D    \{\alpha<\kappa:2^{\alpha}=\alpha^{+}\}\in D   , then     2  Œ∫   =   Œ∫  +        superscript  2  Œ∫    superscript  Œ∫      2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}   . Starting with   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   a supercompact cardinal , Silver was able to produce a model of set theory in which   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is measurable and in which     2  Œ∫   >   Œ∫  +        superscript  2  Œ∫    superscript  Œ∫      2^{\kappa}>\kappa^{+}   . Then, by applying Prikry forcing to the measurable   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   , one gets a model of set theory in which   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is a strong limit cardinal of countable cofinality and in which     2  Œ∫   >   Œ∫  +        superscript  2  Œ∫    superscript  Œ∫      2^{\kappa}>\kappa^{+}   ‚Äîa violation of the SCH. Gitik , building on work of Woodin , was able to replace the supercompact in Silver's proof with a measurable of Mitchell order    Œ∫    +  +      superscript  Œ∫    absent      \kappa^{++}   . That established an upper bound for the consistency strength of the failure of the SCH. Gitik again, using results of Inner model theory , was able to show that a measurable of Mitchell order    Œ∫    +  +      superscript  Œ∫    absent      \kappa^{++}   is also the lower bound for the consistency strength of the failure of SCH.  A wide variety of propositions imply SCH. As was noted above, GCH implies SCH. On the other hand, the proper forcing axiom which implies     2   ‚Ñµ  0    =   ‚Ñµ  2        superscript  2   subscript  normal-‚Ñµ  0     subscript  normal-‚Ñµ  2     2^{\aleph_{0}}=\aleph_{2}   and hence is incompatible with GCH also implies SCH. Solovay showed that large cardinals almost imply SCH‚Äîin particular, if   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is strongly compact cardinal , then the SCH holds above   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   . On the other hand, the non-existence of (inner models for) various large cardinals (below a measurable of Mitchell order    Œ∫    +  +      superscript  Œ∫    absent      \kappa^{++}   ) also imply SCH.
