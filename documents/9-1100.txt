   Fox derivative      Fox derivative   In mathematics , the Fox derivative is an algebraic construction in the theory of free groups which bears many similarities to the conventional derivative of calculus . The Fox derivative and related concepts are often referred to as the Fox calculus , or (Fox's original term) the free differential calculus . The Fox derivative was developed in a series of five papers by mathematician Ralph Fox , published in Annals of Mathematics beginning in 1953.  Definition  If G is a free group with identity element e and generators  g i , then the Fox derivative with respect to g i is a function from G into the integral group ring  Z G which is denoted    ∂   ∂   g  i            subscript  g  i      \frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}   , and obeys the following axioms :         ∂   ∂   g  i      (   g  j   )    =   δ   i  j                subscript  g  i      subscript  g  j     subscript  δ    i  j      \frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}(g_{j})=\delta_{ij}   , where    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   is the Kronecker delta        ∂   ∂   g  i      (  e  )    =  0              subscript  g  i     e   0    \frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}(e)=0           ∂   ∂   g  i      (   u  v   )    =     ∂   ∂   g  i      (  u  )    +   u   ∂   ∂   g  i      (  v  )                 subscript  g  i       u  v              subscript  g  i     u     u        subscript  g  i     v      \frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}(uv)=\frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}(u)+u\frac{%
 \partial}{\partial g_{i}}(v)   for any elements u and v of G .   The first two axioms are identical to similar properties of the partial derivative of calculus, and the third is a modified version of the product rule . As a consequence of the axioms, we have the following formula for inverses         ∂   ∂   g  i      (   u   -  1    )    =   -    u   -  1     ∂   ∂   g  i      (  u  )                 subscript  g  i      superscript  u    1          superscript  u    1          subscript  g  i     u      \frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}(u^{-1})=-u^{-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial g_{i}}%
 (u)   for any element u of G .   Applications  The Fox derivative has applications in group cohomology , knot theory and covering space theory, among other areas of mathematics.
