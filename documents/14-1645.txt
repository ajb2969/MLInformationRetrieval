   Cardinal characteristic of the continuum      Cardinal characteristic of the continuum   In the mathematical discipline of set theory , a cardinal characteristic of the continuum is an infinite cardinal number that may consistently lie strictly between     ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}    (the cardinality of the set of natural numbers ), and the cardinality of the continuum , that is, the cardinality of the set   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   of all real numbers . The latter cardinal is denoted    2   ℵ  0      superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     2^{\aleph_{0}}   or   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   . A variety of such cardinal characteristics arise naturally, and much work has been done in determining what relations between them are provable, and constructing models of set theory for various consistent configurations of them.  Background  Cantor's diagonal argument shows that   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   is strictly greater than    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   , but it does not specify whether it is the least cardinal greater than    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   (that is,    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   ). Indeed the assumption that    𝔠  =   ℵ  1       𝔠   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     \mathfrak{c}=\aleph_{1}   is the well-known Continuum Hypothesis , which was shown to be independent of the standard ZFC axioms for set theory by Paul Cohen . If the Continuum Hypothesis fails and so   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   is at least    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}   , natural questions arise about the cardinals strictly between    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   and   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   , for example regarding Lebesgue measurability. By considering the least cardinal with some property, one may get a definition for an uncountable cardinal that is consistently less than   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   . Generally one only considers definitions for cardinals that are provably greater than    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   and at most   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   as cardinal characteristics of the continuum, so if the Continuum Hypothesis holds they are all equal to    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   .  Examples  As is standard, we denote by   ω   ω   \omega   the least infinite ordinal , which has cardinality    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   and may be identified with the set of all natural numbers.  A number of cardinal characteristics naturally arise as cardinal invariants for ideals which are closely connected with the structure of the reals, such as the ideal of Lebesgue null sets and the ideal of meagre sets .  non(N)  The cardinal characteristic non(   𝒩   𝒩   \mathcal{N}   ) is the least cardinality of a non-measurable set ; equivalently, it is the least cardinality of a set that is not a Lebesgue null set .  Bounding number   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   and dominating number   𝔡   𝔡   \mathfrak{d}     We denote by    ω  ω     superscript  ω  ω    \omega^{\omega}   the set of functions from   ω   ω   \omega   to   ω   ω   \omega   . For any two functions    f  :   ω  →  ω      normal-:  f   normal-→  ω  ω     f:\omega\to\omega   and    g  :   ω  →  ω      normal-:  g   normal-→  ω  ω     g:\omega\to\omega   we denote by    f   ≤  *   g      superscript     f  g    f\leq^{*}g   the statement that for all but finitely many     n  ∈  ω   ,    f   (  n  )    ≤   g   (  n  )        formulae-sequence    n  ω       f  n     g  n      n\in\omega,f(n)\leq g(n)   . The bounding number    𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   is the least cardinality of an unbounded set in this relation, that is,    𝔟  =  min   (   {  |  F  |  :  F  ⊆   ω  ω   ∧  ∀  f  :  ω  →  ω  ∃  g  ∈  F   (  g   ≰  *   f  )   }   )   .     fragments  b     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  normal-|  F  normal-|  normal-:  F    superscript  ω  ω    for-all  f  normal-:  ω  normal-→  ω   g   F   fragments  normal-(  g   superscript  not-less-than-nor-greater-than    f  normal-)   normal-}   normal-)   normal-.    \mathfrak{b}=\min(\{|F|:F\subseteq\omega^{\omega}\land\forall f:\omega\to%
 \omega\exists g\in F(g\nleq^{*}f)\}).     The dominating number    𝔡   𝔡   \mathfrak{d}   is the least cardinality of a set of functions from   ω   ω   \omega   to   ω   ω   \omega   such that every such function is dominated by (that is,    ≤  *     superscript      \leq^{*}   ) a member of that set, that is,    𝔡  =  min   (   {  |  F  |  :  F  ⊆   ω  ω   ∧  ∀  f  :  ω  →  ω  ∃  g  ∈  F   (  f   ≤  *   g  )   }   )   .     fragments  d     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  normal-|  F  normal-|  normal-:  F    superscript  ω  ω    for-all  f  normal-:  ω  normal-→  ω   g   F   fragments  normal-(  f   superscript     g  normal-)   normal-}   normal-)   normal-.    \mathfrak{d}=\min(\{|F|:F\subseteq\omega^{\omega}\land\forall f:\omega\to%
 \omega\exists g\in F(f\leq^{*}g)\}).     Clearly any such dominating set   F   F   F   is unbounded, so   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   is at most   𝔡   𝔡   \mathfrak{d}   , and a diagonalisation argument shows that    𝔟  >   ℵ  0       𝔟   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     \mathfrak{b}>\aleph_{0}   . Of course if    𝔠  =   ℵ  1       𝔠   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     \mathfrak{c}=\aleph_{1}   this implies that    𝔟  =  𝔡  =   ℵ  1         𝔟  𝔡        subscript  normal-ℵ  1      \mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{d}=\aleph_{1}   , but Hechler 1 has shown that it is also consistent to have   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   strictly less than   𝔡   𝔡   \mathfrak{d}   .  Splitting number   𝔰   𝔰   \mathfrak{s}   and reaping number   𝔯   𝔯   \mathfrak{r}     We denote by     [  ω  ]   ω     superscript   delimited-[]  ω   ω    [\omega]^{\omega}   the set of all infinite subsets of   ω   ω   \omega   . For any     a  ,  b   ∈    [  ω  ]   ω        a  b    superscript   delimited-[]  ω   ω     a,b\in[\omega]^{\omega}   , we say that   a   a   a    splits    b   b   b   if both    b  ∩  a      b  a    b\cap a   and    b  ∖  a      b  a    b\setminus a   are infinite. The splitting number    𝔰   𝔰   \mathfrak{s}   is the least cardinality of a subset   S   S   S   of     [  ω  ]   ω     superscript   delimited-[]  ω   ω    [\omega]^{\omega}   such that for all    b  ∈    [  ω  ]   ω       b   superscript   delimited-[]  ω   ω     b\in[\omega]^{\omega}   , there is some    a  ∈  S      a  S    a\in S   such that   a   a   a   splits   b   b   b   . That is,    𝔰  =  min   (   {  |  S  |  :  S  ⊆    [  ω  ]   ω   ∧  ∀  b  ∈    [  ω  ]   ω   ∃  a  ∈  S   (  |  b  ∩  a  |  =   ℵ  0   ∧  |  b  ∖  a  |  =   ℵ  0   )   }   )   .     fragments  s     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  normal-|  S  normal-|  normal-:  S    superscript   fragments  normal-[  ω  normal-]   ω    for-all  b    superscript   fragments  normal-[  ω  normal-]   ω    a   S   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  b   a  normal-|    subscript  normal-ℵ  0    normal-|  b   a  normal-|    subscript  normal-ℵ  0   normal-)   normal-}   normal-)   normal-.    \mathfrak{s}=\min(\{|S|:S\subseteq[\omega]^{\omega}\land\forall b\in[\omega]^{%
 \omega}\exists a\in S(|b\cap a|=\aleph_{0}\land|b\setminus a|=\aleph_{0})\}).     The reaping number    𝔯   𝔯   \mathfrak{r}   is the least cardinality of a subset   R   R   R   of     [  ω  ]   ω     superscript   delimited-[]  ω   ω    [\omega]^{\omega}   such that no element   a   a   a   of     [  ω  ]   ω     superscript   delimited-[]  ω   ω    [\omega]^{\omega}   splits every element of   R   R   R   . That is,    𝔯  =  min   (   {  |  R  |  :  R  ⊆    [  ω  ]   ω   ∧  ∀  a  ∈    [  ω  ]   ω   ∃  b  ∈  R   (  |  b  ∩  a  |  <   ℵ  0   ∨  |  b  ∖  a  |  <   ℵ  0   )   }   )   .     fragments  r     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  normal-|  R  normal-|  normal-:  R    superscript   fragments  normal-[  ω  normal-]   ω    for-all  a    superscript   fragments  normal-[  ω  normal-]   ω    b   R   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  b   a  normal-|    subscript  normal-ℵ  0    normal-|  b   a  normal-|    subscript  normal-ℵ  0   normal-)   normal-}   normal-)   normal-.    \mathfrak{r}=\min(\{|R|:R\subseteq[\omega]^{\omega}\land\forall a\in[\omega]^{%
 \omega}\exists b\in R(|b\cap a|<\aleph_{0}\lor|b\setminus a|<\aleph_{0})\}).     Ultrafilter number   𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}     The ultrafilter number   𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}   is defined to be the least cardinality of a filter base of an ultrafilter on   ω   ω   \omega   . Kunen 2 gave a model of set theory in which    𝔲  =   ℵ  1       𝔲   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     \mathfrak{u}=\aleph_{1}   but    𝔠  =   ℵ   ℵ  1        𝔠   subscript  normal-ℵ   subscript  normal-ℵ  1      \mathfrak{c}=\aleph_{\aleph_{1}}   , and using a countable support iteration of Sacks forcings , Baumgartner and Laver 3 demonstrated a model in which    𝔲  =   ℵ  1       𝔲   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     \mathfrak{u}=\aleph_{1}   and    𝔠  =   ℵ  2       𝔠   subscript  normal-ℵ  2     \mathfrak{c}=\aleph_{2}   .  Almost disjointness number   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}     Two subsets   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   of   ω   ω   \omega   are said to be almost disjoint if    |   A  ∩  B   |        A  B     |A\cap B|   is finite, and a family of subsets of   ω   ω   \omega   is said to be almost disjoint if its members are pairwise almost disjoint. A maximal almost disjoint (mad) family of subsets of   ω   ω   \omega   is thus an almost disjoint family   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   such that for every subset   X   X   X   of   ω   ω   \omega   , there is a set    A  ∈  𝒜      A  𝒜    A\in\mathcal{A}   such that   A   A   A   and   X   X   X   are not almost disjoint (that is, their intersection is infinite). The almost disjointness number   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is the least cardinality of an infinite maximal almost disjoint family. A basic result 4 is that    𝔟  ≤  𝔞      𝔟  𝔞    \mathfrak{b}\leq\mathfrak{a}   ; Shelah 5 showed that it is consistent to have the strict inequality    𝔟  <  𝔞      𝔟  𝔞    \mathfrak{b}<\mathfrak{a}   .
