   Klein geometry      Klein geometry   In mathematics , a Klein geometry is a type of geometry motivated by Felix Klein in his influential Erlangen program . More specifically, it is a homogeneous space  X together with a transitive action on X by a Lie group  G , which acts as the symmetry group of the geometry.  For background and motivation see the article on the Erlangen program .  Formal definition  A Klein geometry is a pair  where G is a Lie group and H is a closed  Lie subgroup of G such that the (left) coset space  G / H is connected . The group G is called the principal group of the geometry and G / H is called the space of the geometry (or, by an abuse of terminology, simply the Klein geometry ). The space  of a Klein geometry is a smooth manifold of dimension   dim X = dim G ‚àí dim H .   There is a natural smooth left action of G on X given by       g  .    (   a  H   )   =    (   g  a   )   H     .     formulae-sequence  g      a  H       g  a   H      g.(aH)=(ga)H.   Clearly, this action is transitive (take ), so that one may then regard X as a homogeneous space for the action of G . The stabilizer of the identity coset  is precisely the group H .  Given any connected smooth manifold X and a smooth transitive action by a Lie group G on X , we can construct an associated Klein geometry  by fixing a basepoint x 0 in X and letting H be the stabilizer subgroup of x 0 in G . The group H is necessarily a closed subgroup of G and X is naturally diffeomorphic to G / H .  Two Klein geometries and are geometrically isomorphic if there is a Lie group isomorphism  so that . In particular, if œÜ is conjugation by an element , we see that  and are isomorphic. The Klein geometry associated to a homogeneous space X is then unique up to isomorphism (i.e. it is independent of the chosen basepoint x 0 ).  Bundle description  Given a Lie group G and closed subgroup H , there is natural right action of H on G given by right multiplication. This action is both free and proper . The orbits are simply the left cosets of H in G . One concludes that G has the structure of a smooth principal H -bundle over the left coset space G / H :       H  ‚Üí  G  ‚Üí   G  /  H    .       normal-‚Üí  H  G    normal-‚Üí      G  H      H\to G\to G/H.     Types of Klein geometries  Effective geometries  The action of G on  need not be effective. The kernel of a Klein geometry is defined to be the kernel of the action of G on X . It is given by       K  =   {   k  ‚àà  G   :     g   -  1    k  g   ‚àà    H    ‚àÄ  g    ‚àà  G   }    .      K   conditional-set    k  G          superscript  g    1    k  g     H   for-all  g         G       K=\{k\in G:g^{-1}kg\in H\;\;\forall g\in G\}.   The kernel K may also be described as the core of H in G (i.e. the largest subgroup of H that is normal in G ). It is the group generated by all the normal subgroups of G that lie in H .  A Klein geometry is said to be effective if  and locally effective if K is discrete . If  is a Klein geometry with kernel K , then  is an effective Klein geometry canonically associated to .  Geometrically oriented geometries  A Klein geometry  is geometrically oriented if G is connected . (This does not imply that G / H is an oriented manifold ). If H is connected it follows that G is also connected (this is because G / H is assumed to be connected, and  is a fibration ).  Given any Klein geometry , there is a geometrically oriented geometry canonically associated to  with the same base space G / H . This is the geometry where G 0 is the identity component of G . Note that .  Reductive geometries  A Klein geometry  is said to be reductive and G / H a reductive homogeneous space if the Lie algebra    ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   of H has an H -invariant complement in   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   .
