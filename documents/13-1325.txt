Definition

Lie algebra
A vector space 
 
 
 
  over a field 
 
 
 
  with a binary operation [·, ·] (called the Lie bracket or abbr. bracket) , which satisfies the following conditions
 
 
 
 ,
 


 
 
  (bilinearity)


 
  (alternating)


 
  (Jacobi identity)




associative algebra

  is a Lie algebra derivation. The map
 



thus defined is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
