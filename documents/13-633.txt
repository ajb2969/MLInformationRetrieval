   Chaplygin gas      Chaplygin gas   Chaplygin gas 1 2 which occurs in certain theories of cosmology , is a hypothetical substance that satisfies an exotic equation of state in the form    p  =   -   A  /   ρ  α         p      A   superscript  ρ  α       p=-A/\rho^{\alpha}   where   p   p   p   is the pressure,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density, with    α  =  1      α  1    \alpha=1   and   A   A   A   a positive constant. The substance is named after Sergey Chaplygin .  In some models, generalized Chaplygin gas is considered, where   α   α   \alpha   is a parameter which can take on values    0  <  α  ≤  1        0  α       1     0<\alpha\leq 1   .
