Chaplygin gas

Chaplygin gas12 which occurs in certain theories of cosmology, is a hypothetical substance that satisfies an exotic equation of state in the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the pressure, 
 
 
 
  is the density, with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a positive constant. The substance is named after Sergey Chaplygin.
In some models, generalized Chaplygin gas is considered, where 
 
 
 
  is a parameter which can take on values 
 
 
 
 .
