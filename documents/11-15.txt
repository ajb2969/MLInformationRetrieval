Threonine-phosphate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a threonine-phosphate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-threonine O-3-phosphate

 
  (R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-threonine O-3-phosphate, and two products, (R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threonine-O-3-phosphate carboxy-lyase [(R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl-phosphate-forming]. Other names in common use include L-threonine-O-3-phosphate decarboxylase, CobD, and L-threonine-O-3-phosphate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
