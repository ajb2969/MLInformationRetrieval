Modified hyperbolic tangent

Modified hyperbolic tangent â€” special S-shaped function based on hyperbolic tangent.

The function is:









This function proposed by Elena Soboleva (Ukraine) as a utility function for multi-objective optimization and choice modelling in decision-making at first.1 2 3
In other papers it is used for approximation of current-voltage characteristics of light-emitting diodes.4
