   Modified hyperbolic tangent      Modified hyperbolic tangent   Modified hyperbolic tangent — special S-shaped function based on hyperbolic tangent .   The function is:          mtanh  x   =     e   a  x    -   e   -   b  x        e   c  x    +   e   -   d  x            mtanh  x        superscript  e    a  x     superscript  e      b  x         superscript  e    c  x     superscript  e      d  x         \operatorname{mtanh}x=\frac{e^{ax}-e^{-bx}}{e^{cx}+e^{-dx}}        This function proposed by Elena Soboleva (Ukraine) as a utility function for multi-objective optimization and choice modelling in decision-making at first. 1  2  3  In other papers it is used for approximation of current-voltage characteristics of light-emitting diodes. 4  See also   e (mathematical constant)  Equal incircles theorem , based on sinh  Inverse hyperbolic functions  List of integrals of hyperbolic functions  Poinsot's spirals  Sigmoid function   References  "  Category:Elementary special functions  Category:Exponentials  Category:Analytic functions     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
