   AdS black hole      AdS black hole   In theoretical physics , an AdS black hole is a black hole solution of general relativity or its extensions which represents an isolated massive object, but with a negative cosmological constant. Such a solution asymptotically approaches anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity, and is a generalization of the Kerr vacuum solution , which asymptotically approaches Minkowski spacetime at spatial infinity.  In 3+1 dimensions, the metric is given by       d   s  2    =    -    (      k  2    r  2    +  1   -   C  r    )   d   t  2     +    1      k  2    r  2    +  1   -   C  r     d   r  2    +    r  2   d   Ω  2           d   superscript  s  2                 superscript  k  2    superscript  r  2    1     C  r    d   superscript  t  2         1         superscript  k  2    superscript  r  2    1     C  r     d   superscript  r  2       superscript  r  2   d   superscript  normal-Ω  2       ds^{2}=-\left(k^{2}r^{2}+1-\frac{C}{r}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{1}{k^{2}r^{2}+1-%
 \frac{C}{r}}dr^{2}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}   where t is the time coordinate, r is the radial coordinate, Ω are the polar coordinates, C is a constant and k is the AdS curvature.  In general, in d+1 dimensions, the metric is given by       d   s  2    =    -    (      k  2    r  2    +  1   -   C   r   d  -  2      )   d   t  2     +    1      k  2    r  2    +  1   -   C   r   d  -  2       d   r  2    +    r  2   d   Ω  2           d   superscript  s  2                 superscript  k  2    superscript  r  2    1     C   superscript  r    d  2      d   superscript  t  2         1         superscript  k  2    superscript  r  2    1     C   superscript  r    d  2       d   superscript  r  2       superscript  r  2   d   superscript  normal-Ω  2       ds^{2}=-\left(k^{2}r^{2}+1-\frac{C}{r^{d-2}}\right)dt^{2}+\frac{1}{k^{2}r^{2}+%
 1-\frac{C}{r^{d-2}}}dr^{2}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}     According to the AdS/CFT correspondence , if gravity were quantized, an AdS black hole would be dual to a thermal state on the conformal boundary. In the context of say, AdS/QCD , this would correspond to the deconfinement phase of the quark–gluon plasma .
