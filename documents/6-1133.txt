   Nuclear operator      Nuclear operator   In mathematics , a nuclear operator is a compact operator for which a trace may be defined, such that the trace is finite and independent of the choice of basis (at least on well behaved spaces; there are some spaces on which nuclear operators do not have a trace). Nuclear operators are essentially the same as trace class operators , though most authors reserve the term "trace class operator" for the special case of nuclear operators on Hilbert spaces . The general definition for Banach spaces was given by Grothendieck . This article concentrates on the general case of nuclear operators on Banach spaces; for the important special case of nuclear (=trace class) operators on Hilbert space see the article on trace class operators .  Compact operator  An operator   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   on a Hilbert space    ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}         ℒ  :   ℋ  →  ℋ      normal-:  ℒ   normal-→  ℋ  ℋ     \mathcal{L}:\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}     is said to be a compact operator if it can be written in the form      ℒ  =    ∑   n  =  1   N     ρ  n    ⟨   f  n   ,  ⋅  ⟩    g  n         ℒ    superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  ρ  n     subscript  f  n   normal-⋅    subscript  g  n       \mathcal{L}=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\rho_{n}\langle f_{n},\cdot\rangle g_{n}     where    1  ≤  N  ≤  ∞        1  N           1\leq N\leq\infty   and     f  1   ,  …  ,   f  N       subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  N     f_{1},\ldots,f_{N}   and     g  1   ,  …  ,   g  N       subscript  g  1   normal-…   subscript  g  N     g_{1},\ldots,g_{N}   are (not necessarily complete) orthonormal sets. Here,     ρ  1   ,  …  ,   ρ  N       subscript  ρ  1   normal-…   subscript  ρ  N     \rho_{1},\ldots,\rho_{N}   are a set of real numbers, the singular values of the operator, obeying     ρ  n   →  0     normal-→   subscript  ρ  n   0    \rho_{n}\to 0   if    N  =  ∞      N     N=\infty   . The bracket    ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   is the scalar product on the Hilbert space; the sum on the right hand side must converge in norm.  An operator that is compact as defined above is said to be nuclear or trace-class if        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   ρ  n   |    <  ∞        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  ρ  n        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|\rho_{n}|<\infty     Properties  A nuclear operator on a Hilbert space has the important property that its trace may be defined so that it is finite and is independent of the basis. Given any orthonormal basis    {   ψ  n   }      subscript  ψ  n     \{\psi_{n}\}   for the Hilbert space, one may define the trace as       Tr  ℒ   =    ∑  n    ⟨   ψ  n   ,   ℒ   ψ  n    ⟩          Tr  ℒ     subscript   n     subscript  ψ  n     ℒ   subscript  ψ  n        \mbox{Tr}\mathcal{L}=\sum_{n}\langle\psi_{n},\mathcal{L}\psi_{n}\rangle     since (as can be proven) the sum converges absolutely and is independent of the basis. Furthermore, this trace is identical to the sum over the eigenvalues of   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   (counted with multiplicity).  On Banach spaces   See main article Fredholm kernel .    The definition of trace-class operator was extended to Banach spaces by Alexander Grothendieck in 1955.  Let A and B be Banach spaces, and A ' be the dual of A , that is, the set of all continuous or (equivalently) bounded linear functionals on A with the usual norm. Then an operator      ℒ  :   A  →  B      normal-:  ℒ   normal-→  A  B     \mathcal{L}:A\to B     is said to be '''nuclear of order q ''' if there exist sequences of vectors     {   g  n   }   ∈  B        subscript  g  n    B    \{g_{n}\}\in B   with     ∥   g  n   ∥   ≤  1       norm   subscript  g  n    1    \|g_{n}\|\leq 1   , functionals     {   f  n  *   }   ∈   A  ′         subscript   superscript  f    n     superscript  A  normal-′     \{f^{*}_{n}\}\in A^{\prime}   with     ∥   f  n  *   ∥   ≤  1       norm   subscript   superscript  f    n    1    \|f^{*}_{n}\|\leq 1   and complex numbers     {   ρ  n   }      subscript  ρ  n     \{\rho_{n}\}   with        inf   {   p  ≥  1   :     ∑  n     |   ρ  n   |   p    <  ∞   }    =  q   ,       infimum   conditional-set    p  1       subscript   n    superscript     subscript  ρ  n    p        q    \inf\left\{p\geq 1:\sum_{n}|\rho_{n}|^{p}<\infty\right\}=q,     such that the operator may be written as      ℒ  =    ∑  n     ρ  n    f  n  *    (  ⋅  )    g  n         ℒ    subscript   n      subscript  ρ  n    subscript   superscript  f    n   normal-⋅   subscript  g  n       \mathcal{L}=\sum_{n}\rho_{n}f^{*}_{n}(\cdot)g_{n}     with the sum converging in the operator norm.  With additional steps, a trace may be defined for such operators when A = B .  Operators that are nuclear of order 1 are called nuclear operators : these are the ones for which the series ∑ ρ n is absolutely convergent. Nuclear operators of order 2 are called Hilbert–Schmidt operators .  More generally, an operator from a locally convex topological vector space  A to a Banach space B is called nuclear if it satisfies the condition above with all f n * bounded by 1 on some fixed neighborhood of 0.
