Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase

In enzymology, a dihydroxy-acid dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate 
 
 
 
  3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate, and two products, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate (Î±-ketoisovaleric acid) and H2O.
This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis.
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate hydro-lyase (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate-forming). Other names in common use include

acetohydroxyacid dehydratase,
alpha,beta-dihydroxyacid dehydratase,
2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate dehydratase,
alpha,beta-dihydroxyisovalerate dehydratase,
dihydroxy acid dehydrase,
DHAD,
and 2,3-dihydroxy-acid hydro-lyase.
