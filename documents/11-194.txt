   Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase      Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase   In enzymology , a dihydroxy-acid dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate, and two products , 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate (α-ketoisovaleric acid) and H 2 O .  This enzyme participates in valine , leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate hydro-lyase (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate-forming). Other names in common use include   acetohydroxyacid dehydratase,  alpha,beta-dihydroxyacid dehydratase,  2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate dehydratase,  alpha,beta-dihydroxyisovalerate dehydratase,  dihydroxy acid dehydrase,  DHAD,  and 2,3-dihydroxy-acid hydro-lyase.
