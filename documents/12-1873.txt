   Exchange-rate pass through      Exchange-rate pass through  '''Exchange-rate pass-through''' (ERPT) is a measure of how responsive international prices are to changes in the [[exchange rate]]. Formally, exchange-rate pass-through is the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] of local-currency import prices with respect to the local-currency price of foreign currency. In other words, exchange-rate pass-through is the [[percentage change]], in [[local currency]], of import prices resulting from a one percent change in the exchange rate between the exporting and importi ng countries. 1 A change in import prices affects retail and consumer prices. When exchange-rate pass-through is greater, there is more transmission of inflation between countries. 2 This is one reason why exchange-rate pass-through is an important topic in international economics . Exchange-rate pass-through is also related to the law of one price and purchasing power parity .  Example  Suppose that the US is importing widgets from England. The widgets cost $10 and ₤1 costs $1. Then the British Pound appreciates against the dollar and now ₤1 costs $1.50. Also suppose that the widgets now cost $12.50.  There has been a 50% change in the exchange rate and a 25% change in price. The exchange rate pass-through is  $$\frac{25%}{50%}=.5.$$ For every 1% increase in the exchange rate, there has been a .5% increase in the price of the widgets.  Measurement  The "standard pass-through regression" 3 is  $$\Delta \ln p_{t} = \alpha+\sum_{i=0}^N\gamma_i \Delta \ln e_{t-i}+\delta \Delta \ln c_t+ \psi\Delta \ln d_t +\epsilon_t,$$ where $p$ is import price, $e$ is the exchange rate, $c$ is marginal costs, $d$ is demand, and $\Delta$ denotes a first difference. The exchange-rate pass-through after $N$ periods is  $$\sum_{i=0}^N\gamma_i.$$  In their 2005 study of exchange-rate pass-through to import prices, 4 José Campa and Linda Goldberg estimate long-run exchange-rate pass-through to import prices for the following countries:     Country  Long-Run Exchange-Rate Pass-Through 5      Australia  0.69    Canada  0.68    Switzerland  0.94    Czech Republic  0.61    Germany  0.79    Denmark  0.68    Spain  0.56    Finland  0.82    France  1.21    United Kingdom  0.47    Hungary  0.85    Ireland  1.37    Iceland  0.76    Italy  0.62    Japan  1.26    Netherlands  0.77    Norway  0.79    New Zealand  0.62    Poland  0.99    Portugal  0.88    Sweden  0.59    USA  0.41     Measurement of exchange-rate pass-through is typically performed using aggregate price indexes . 6 Some studies have examined how firms with different production costs differ in their exchange-rate pass-through. These studies of firm-level differences explain why exchange-rate pass-through is not equal to one 7 and how globalization caused a decrease in exchange-rate pass-through. 8  References    "  Category:Foreign exchange market  Category:International economics     ↩  ↩  ↩     ↩  ↩
