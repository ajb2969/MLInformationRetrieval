   Differentiation of integrals      Differentiation of integrals   In mathematics , the problem of differentiation of integrals is that of determining under what circumstances the mean value  integral of a suitable function on a small neighbourhood of a point approximates the value of the function at that point. More formally, given a space X with a measure  μ and a metric  d , one asks for what functions f : X → R does        lim   r  →  0      1   μ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  r    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d  μ   (  y  )       =   f   (  x  )          subscript    normal-→  r  0        1    μ     subscript  B  r   x       subscript      subscript  B  r   x      f  y  normal-d  μ  y        f  x     \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{1}{\mu\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{r}(x)}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\mu%
 (y)=f(x)     for all (or at least μ - almost all ) x ∈ X ? (Here, as in the rest of the article, B r ( x ) denotes the open ball in X with d - radius  r and centre x .) This is a natural question to ask, especially in view of the heuristic construction of the Riemann integral , in which it is almost implicit that f ( x ) is a "good representative" for the values of f near x .  Theorems on the differentiation of integrals  Lebesgue measure  One result on the differentiation of integrals is the Lebesgue differentiation theorem , as proved by Henri Lebesgue in 1910. Consider n - dimensional  Lebesgue measure  λ n on n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n . Then, for any locally integrable function  f : R n → R , one has        lim   r  →  0      1    λ  n    (    B  r    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  r    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d   λ  n    (  y  )       =   f   (  x  )          subscript    normal-→  r  0        1     superscript  λ  n      subscript  B  r   x       subscript      subscript  B  r   x      f  y  normal-d   superscript  λ  n   y        f  x     \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{1}{\lambda^{n}\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{r}(x)}f(y)\,%
 \mathrm{d}\lambda^{n}(y)=f(x)     for λ n -almost all points x ∈ R n . It is important to note, however, that the measure zero set of "bad" points depends on the function f .  Borel measures on R n  The result for Lebesgue measure turns out to be a special case of the following result, which is based on the Besicovitch covering theorem : if μ is any locally finite  Borel measure on R n and f : R n → R is locally integrable with respect to μ , then        lim   r  →  0      1   μ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  r    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d  μ   (  y  )       =   f   (  x  )          subscript    normal-→  r  0        1    μ     subscript  B  r   x       subscript      subscript  B  r   x      f  y  normal-d  μ  y        f  x     \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{1}{\mu\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{r}(x)}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\mu%
 (y)=f(x)     for μ -almost all points x ∈ R n .  Gaussian measures  The problem of the differentiation of integrals is much harder in an infinite-dimensional setting. Consider a separable  Hilbert space ( H , 〈 , 〉) equipped with a Gaussian measure  γ . As stated in the article on the Vitali covering theorem , the Vitali covering theorem fails for Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Two results of David Preiss (1981 and 1983) show the kind of difficulties that one can expect to encounter in this setting:   There is a Gaussian measure γ on a separable Hilbert space H and a Borel set M ⊆ H so that, for γ -almost all x ∈ H ,           lim   r  →  0      γ   (   M  ∩    B  r    (  x  )     )     γ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )      =  1.        subscript    normal-→  r  0        γ    M     subscript  B  r   x       γ     subscript  B  r   x      1.    \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{\gamma\big(M\cap B_{r}(x)\big)}{\gamma\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}=1.         There is a Gaussian measure γ on a separable Hilbert space H and a function f ∈ L 1 ( H , γ ; R ) such that            lim   r  →  0     inf   {    1   γ   (    B  s    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  s    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d  γ   (  y  )      |    x  ∈  H   ,   0  <  s  <  r    }     =   +  ∞    .        subscript    normal-→  r  0     infimum   conditional-set      1    γ     subscript  B  s   x       subscript      subscript  B  s   x      f  y  normal-d  γ  y      formulae-sequence    x  H       0  s       r              \lim_{r\to 0}\inf\left\{\left.\frac{1}{\gamma\big(B_{s}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{s}(x)%
 }f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(y)\right|x\in H,0        However, there is some hope if one has good control over the covariance of γ . Let the covariance operator of γ be S : H → H given by        ⟨   S  x   ,  y  ⟩   =    ∫  H     ⟨  x  ,  z  ⟩    ⟨  y  ,  z  ⟩   d  γ   (  z  )      ,         S  x   y     subscript   H      x  z    y  z   normal-d  γ  z      \langle Sx,y\rangle=\int_{H}\langle x,z\rangle\langle y,z\rangle\,\mathrm{d}%
 \gamma(z),     or, for some countable  orthonormal basis ( e i ) i ∈ N of H ,        S  x   =    ∑   i  ∈  𝐍      σ  i  2    ⟨  x  ,   e  i   ⟩    e  i      .        S  x     subscript     i  𝐍       superscript   subscript  σ  i   2    x   subscript  e  i     subscript  e  i       Sx=\sum_{i\in\mathbf{N}}\sigma_{i}^{2}\langle x,e_{i}\rangle e_{i}.     In 1981, Preiss and Jaroslav Tišer showed that if there exists a constant 0 \sigma_{i + 1}^{2} \leq q \sigma_{i}^{2},  then, for all f ∈ L 1 ( H , γ ; R ),         1   μ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  r    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d  μ   (  y  )       →   r  →  0   𝛾    f   (  x  )     ,       normal-→  r  0    γ  normal-→        1    μ     subscript  B  r   x       subscript      subscript  B  r   x      f  y  normal-d  μ  y       f  x     \frac{1}{\mu\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{r}(x)}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)%
 \xrightarrow[r\to 0]{\gamma}f(x),     where the convergence is convergence in measure with respect to γ . In 1988, Tišer showed that if       σ   i  +  1   2   ≤    σ  i  2    i  α         superscript   subscript  σ    i  1    2      superscript   subscript  σ  i   2    superscript  i  α      \sigma_{i+1}^{2}\leq\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{i^{\alpha}}     for some α > 5 ⁄ 2, then         1   μ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  r    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d  μ   (  y  )       →   r  →  0      f   (  x  )     ,       normal-→  r  0    absent  normal-→        1    μ     subscript  B  r   x       subscript      subscript  B  r   x      f  y  normal-d  μ  y       f  x     \frac{1}{\mu\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{r}(x)}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)%
 \xrightarrow[r\to 0]{}f(x),     for γ -almost all x and all f ∈ L p ( H , γ ; R ), p > 1.  As of 2007, it is still an open question whether there exists an infinite-dimensional Gaussian measure γ on a separable Hilbert space H so that, for all f ∈ L 1 ( H , γ ; R ),        lim   r  →  0      1   γ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )       ∫    B  r    (  x  )      f   (  y  )   d  γ   (  y  )       =   f   (  x  )          subscript    normal-→  r  0        1    γ     subscript  B  r   x       subscript      subscript  B  r   x      f  y  normal-d  γ  y        f  x     \lim_{r\to 0}\frac{1}{\gamma\big(B_{r}(x)\big)}\int_{B_{r}(x)}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}%
 \gamma(y)=f(x)     for γ -almost all x ∈ H . However, it is conjectured that no such measure exists, since the σ i would have to decay very rapidly.  See also   Differentiation under the integral sign   References      "  Category:Theorems in analysis  Category:Measure theory
