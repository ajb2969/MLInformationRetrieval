Shanks' square forms factorization

Shanks's square forms factorization is a method for integer factorization devised by Daniel Shanks as an improvement on Fermat's factorization method.
The success of Fermat's method depends on finding integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is the integer to be factored. An improvement (noticed by Kraitchik) is to look for integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Finding a suitable pair 
 
 
 
  does not guarantee a factorization of 
 
 
 
 
 , but it implies that 
 
 
 
  is a factor of 
 
 
 
 , and there is a good chance that the prime divisors of 
 
 
 
  are distributed between these two factors, so that calculation of the greatest common divisor of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  will give a non-trivial factor of 
 
 
 
 .
A practical algorithm for finding pairs 
 
 
 
  which satisfy 
 
 
 
  was developed by Shanks, who named it Square Forms Factorization or SQUFOF. The algorithm can be expressed in terms of continued fractions, or in terms of quadratic forms. Although there are now much more efficient factorization methods available, SQUFOF has the advantage that it is small enough to be implemented on a programmable calculator.
Algorithm
Input

 
 , the integer to be factored, which must be neither a prime number nor a perfect square, and a small multiplier 
 
 
 
 
 .
Output: a non-trivial factor of 
 
 
 
 .
The algorithm:
Initialize 
 
 

Repeat



until 
 
 
 
  is a perfect square at some even 
 
 
 
 
 .
Initialize 
 
 

Repeat



until 
 
 

Then if 
 
 
 
  is not equal to 
 
 
 
 
  and not equal to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a non-trivial factor of 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise try another value of 
 
 
 
 .
Shanks's method has time complexity 
 
 
 
 
 .
Stephen S. McMasters (see link in External Link section) wrote a more detailed discussion of the mathematics of Shanks's method, together with a proof of its correctness.
Example
N = 11111, k = 1
P0 = 105 Q0 = 1 Q1 = 86
P1 = 67 Q1 = 86 Q2 = 77
P2 = 87 Q2 = 77 Q3 = 46
P3 = 97 Q3 = 46 Q4 = 37
P4 = 88 Q4 = 37 Q5 = 91
P5 = 94 Q5 = 91 Q6 = 25
Here Q6 is a perfect square
P0 = 104 Q0 = 5 Q1 = 59
P1 = 73 Q1 = 59 Q2 = 98
P2 = 25 Q2 = 98 Q3 = 107
P3 = 82 Q3 = 107 Q4 = 41
P4 = 82
Here P3 = P4
gcd(11111, 82) = 41, which is a factor of 11111.
