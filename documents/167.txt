   5alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydratase      5alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydratase   In enzymology , a 5alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5alpha-ergosta-7,22-diene-3beta,5-diol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ergosterol + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5alpha-ergosta-7,22-diene-3beta,5-diol , and two products , ergosterol and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5alpha-ergosta-7,22-diene-3beta,5-diol 5,6-hydro-lyase (ergosterol-forming) . This enzyme is also called 5alpha-ergosta-7,22-diene-3beta,5-diol 5,6-hydro-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
