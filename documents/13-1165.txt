Themistocles M. Rassias

Themistocles M. Rassias (; born on April 2, 1951) is a Greek mathematician, and a Professor at the National Technical University of Athens (Eθνικό Μετσόβιο Πολυτεχνείο), Greece. He has published more than 250 papers, 7 research books and 30 edited volumes in research Mathematics as well as 4 textbooks in Mathematics (in Greek) for university students. His research work has received a large number of citations by several mathematicians. He serves as a member of the Editorial Board of several international mathematical journals.
Education
He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley in June 1976. Professor Stephen Smale and Professor Shiing-Shen Chern have been his thesis and academic advisors, respectively.
Research
His work extends over several fields of Mathematical Analysis. It includes Nonlinear Functional Analysis, Functional Equations, Approximation Theory, Global Analysis, Analysis on Manifolds, Calculus of Variations, Inequalities, Metric Geometry and their Applications.
He has contributed a number of results in the stability of minimal submanifolds, in the solution of Ulam's Problem for approximate homomorphisms in Banach spaces, in the theory of isometric mappings in metric spaces and in Complex analysis (Poincaré's inequality and harmonic mappings).
Mathematical Terminology
Some of his research work has been established with the scientific terminology:
(i) Hyers–Ulam–Rassias stability12 of functional equations. (ii) The Aleksandrov–Rassias problem34 for isometric mappings.5
