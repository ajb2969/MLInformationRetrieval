Pascal's simplex

In mathematics, Pascal's simplex is a generalisation of Pascal's triangle into arbitrary number of dimensions, based on the multinomial theorem.
Generic Pascal's m-simplex
Let m (m > 0) be a number of terms of a polynomial and n (n ≥ 0) be a power the polynomial is raised to.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote a Pascal's m-simplex. Each Pascal's m-simplex is a semi-infinite object, which consists of an infinite series of its components.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote its nth component, itself a finite (m − 1)-simplex with the edge length n, with a notational equivalent 
 
 
 
 .
nth component


 
  consists of the coefficients of multinomial expansion of a polynomial with m terms raised to the power of n:


 
  where

Example for

 , or:



From this follows, that for given n, all i-faces are numerically equal in nth components of all Pascal's (m > i)-simplices, or:



Example
The 3rd component (2-simplex) of Pascal's 3-simplex is bounded by 3 equal 1-faces (lines). Each 1-face (line) is bounded by 2 equal 0-faces (vertices):

Number of coefficients
For the nth component ((m − 1)-simplex) of Pascal's m-simplex, the number of the coefficients of multinomial expansion it consists of is given by:



that is, either by a sum of the number of coefficients of an (n − 1)th component ((m − 1)-simplex) of Pascal's m-simplex with the number of coefficients of an nth component ((m − 2)-simplex) of Pascal's (m − 1)-simplex, or by a number of all possible partitions of an nth power among m exponents.
Example

Interestingly, the terms of this table comprise a Pascal triangle in the format of a symmetric Pascal matrix.
Symmetry
''(An nth component ((m − 1)-simplex) of Pascal's m-simplex has the (m!)-fold spatial symmetry.)''
Geometry
(Orthogonal axes k_1 ... k_m in m-dimensional space, vertices of component at n on each axe, the tip at [0,...,0] for n=0.)
Numeric construction
(Wrapped n-th power of a big number gives instantly the n-th component of a Pascal's simplex.)
