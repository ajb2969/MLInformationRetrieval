   Beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase      Beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase   In enzymology , a beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CMP-N-acetylneuraminate + beta-D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-R   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-alpha-D- galactosaminyl-R   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CMP-N-acetylneuraminate and beta-D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminyl-R , whereas its 3 products are CMP , alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-alpha-D- , and galactosaminyl-R .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those glycosyltransferases that do not transfer hexosyl or pentosyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CMP-N-acetylneuraminate:beta-D-galactoside alpha-2,3-N-acetylneuraminyl-transferase . This enzyme participates in 7 metabolic pathways : o-glycan biosynthesis , keratan sulfate biosynthesis , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lactoseries , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - globoseries , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - ganglioseries , glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 , and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , and .
