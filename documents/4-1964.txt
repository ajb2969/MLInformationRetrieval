   Peierls bracket      Peierls bracket   In theoretical physics , the Peierls bracket is an equivalent description of the Poisson bracket . It directly follows from the action and does not require the canonical coordinates and their canonical momenta to be defined in advance.  The bracket      [  A  ,  B  ]     A  B    [A,B]     is defined as        D  A    (  B  )    -    D  B    (  A  )           subscript  D  A   B      subscript  D  B   A     D_{A}(B)-D_{B}(A)   ,  as the difference between some kind of action of one quantity on the other, minus the flipped term.  In quantum mechanics , the Peierls bracket becomes a commutator i.e. a Lie bracket .  References    Peierls, R. "The Commutation Laws of Relativistic Field Theory," Proc. R. Soc. Lond.
