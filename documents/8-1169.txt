   Non-integer representation      Non-integer representation   A non-integer representation uses non- integer numbers as the radix , or bases, of a positional numbering system . For a non-integer radix β > 1, the value of       x  =    d  n   …   d  2    d  1    d  0     .    d   -  1     d   -  2    …   d   -  m        formulae-sequence    x     subscript  d  n   normal-…   subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1    subscript  d  0        subscript  d    1     subscript  d    2    normal-…   subscript  d    m       x=d_{n}\dots d_{2}d_{1}d_{0}.d_{-1}d_{-2}\dots d_{-m}   is       x  =     β  n    d  n    +  ⋯  +    β  2    d  2    +   β   d  1    +   d  0   +    β   -  1     d   -  1     +    β   -  2     d   -  2     +  ⋯  +    β   -  m     d   -  m       .      x       superscript  β  n    subscript  d  n    normal-⋯     superscript  β  2    subscript  d  2      β   subscript  d  1     subscript  d  0      superscript  β    1     subscript  d    1        superscript  β    2     subscript  d    2     normal-⋯     superscript  β    m     subscript  d    m        x=\beta^{n}d_{n}+\cdots+\beta^{2}d_{2}+\beta d_{1}+d_{0}+\beta^{-1}d_{-1}+%
 \beta^{-2}d_{-2}+\cdots+\beta^{-m}d_{-m}.   The numbers d i are non-negative integers less than β. This is also known as a β-expansion , a notion introduced by  and first studied in detail by . Every real number has at least one (possibly infinite) β-expansion.  There are applications of β-expansions in coding theory and models of quasicrystals .  Construction  β-expansions are a generalization of decimal expansions . While infinite decimal expansions are not unique (for example, 1.000... = 0.999... ), all finite decimal expansions are unique. However, even finite β-expansions are not necessarily unique, for example φ + 1 = φ 2 for β = φ, the golden ratio . A canonical choice for the β-expansion of a given real number can be determined by the following greedy algorithm , essentially due to  and formulated as given here by .  Let  be the base and x a non-negative real number. Denote by  the floor function of x , that is, the greatest integer less than or equal to x , and let { x } = x − ⌊ x ⌋ be the fractional part of x . There exists an integer k such that . Set       d  k   =   ⌊   x  /   β  k    ⌋        subscript  d  k       x   superscript  β  k       d_{k}=\lfloor x/\beta^{k}\rfloor   and        r  k   =   {   x  /   β  k    }    .       subscript  r  k      x   superscript  β  k       r_{k}=\{x/\beta^{k}\}.\,   For , put         d  j   =   ⌊   β   r   j  +  1     ⌋    ,    r  j   =   {   β   r   j  +  1     }     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  d  j       β   subscript  r    j  1          subscript  r  j      β   subscript  r    j  1         d_{j}=\lfloor\beta r_{j+1}\rfloor,\quad r_{j}=\{\beta r_{j+1}\}.     In other words, the canonical β-expansion of x is defined by choosing the largest d k such that , then choosing the largest d k −1 such that , etc. Thus it chooses the lexicographically largest string representing x .  With an integer base, this defines the usual radix expansion for the number x . This construction extends the usual algorithm to possibly non-integer values of β.  Examples  Base φ  See Golden ratio base ; 11 φ = 100 φ .  Base e  With base e the natural logarithm behaves like the common logarithm as ln(1 e ) = 0, ln(10 e ) = 1, ln(100 e ) = 2 and ln(1000 e ) = 3.  The base e is the most economical choice of radix β > 1 , where the radix economy is measured as the product of the radix and the length of the string of symbols needed to express a given range of values.  Base π  Base π can be used to more easily show the relationship between the diameter of a circle to its circumference , which corresponds to its perimeter ; since circumference = diameter × π, a circle with a diameter 1 π will have a circumference of 10 π , a circle with a diameter 10 π will have a circumference of 100 π , etc. Furthermore, since the area = π × radius 2 , a circle with a radius of 1 π will have an area of 10 π , a circle with a radius of 10 π will have an area of 1000 π and a circle with a radius of 100 π will have an area of 100000 π .  Base √2  Base √2 behaves in a very similar way to base 2 as all one has to do to convert a number from binary into base √2 is put a zero digit in between every binary digit; for example, 1911 10 = 11101110111 2 becomes 101010001010100010101 √2 and 5118 10 = 1001111111110 2 becomes 1000001010101010101010100 √2 . This means that every integer can be expressed in base √2 without the need of a decimal point. The base can also be used to show the relationship between the side of a square to its diagonal as a square with a side length of 1 √2 will have a diagonal of 10 √2 and a square with a side length of 10 √2 will have a diagonal of 100 √2 . Another use of the base is to show the silver ratio as its representation in base √2 is simply 11 √2 .  Properties  In no positional number system can every number be expressed uniquely. For example, in base 10, the number 1 has two representations: 1.000... and 0.999... . The set of numbers with two different representations is dense in the reals , but the question of classifying real numbers with unique β-expansions is considerably more subtle than that of integer bases .  Another problem is to classify the real numbers whose β-expansions are periodic. Let β > 1, and Q (β) be the smallest field extension of the rationals containing β. Then any real number in [0,1) having a periodic β-expansion must lie in Q (β). On the other hand, the converse need not be true. The converse does hold if β is a Pisot number , although necessary and sufficient conditions are not known.
