Kleitman–Wang algorithms

The Kleitman–Wang algorithms are two different algorithms in graph theory solving the digraph realization problem, i.e. the question if there exists for a finite list of nonnegative integer pairs a simple directed graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. For a positive answer the list of integer pairs is called digraphic. Both algorithms construct a special solution if one exists or prove that one cannot find a positive answer. These constructions are based on recursive algorithms. Kleitman and Wang 1 gave these algorithms in 1973.
Kleitman–Wang algorithm (arbitrary choice of pairs)
The algorithm is based on the following theorem.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is in nonincreasing lexicographical order and let 
 
 
 
  be a pair of nonnegative integers with 
 
 
 
 . List 
 
 
 
  is digraphic if and only if the finite list

 
  has nonnegative integer pairs and is digraphic.
Note that the pair 
 
 
 
  is arbitrarily with the exception of pairs 
 
 
 
 . If the given list 
 
 
 
  digraphic then the theorem will be applied at most 
 
 
 
  times setting in each further step 
 
 
 
 . This process ends when the whole list 
 
 
 
  consists of 
 
 
 
  pairs. In each step of the algorithm one constructs the arcs of a digraph with vertices 
 
 
 
 , i.e. if it is possible to reduce the list 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , then we add arcs 
 
 
 
 . When the list 
 
 
 
  cannot be reduced to a list 
 
 
 
  of nonnegative integer pairs in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list 
 
 
 
  from the beginning is not digraphic.
Kleitman–Wang algorithm (maximum choice of a pair)
The algorithm is based on the following theorem.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite list of nonnegative integers such that 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a pair such that 
 
 
 
  is maximal with respect to the lexicographical order under all pairs 
 
 
 
 . List 
 
 
 
  is digraphic if and only if the finite list 
 
 
 
  has nonnegative integer pairs and is digraphic.
Note that the list 
 
 
 
  must not be in lexicographical order as in the first version. If the given list 
 
 
 
  is digraphic, then the theorem will be applied at most 
 
 
 
  times, setting in each further step 
 
 
 
 . This process ends when the whole list 
 
 
 
  consists of 
 
 
 
  pairs. In each step of the algorithm, one constructs the arcs of a digraph with vertices 
 
 
 
 , i.e. if it is possible to reduce the list 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , then one adds arcs 
 
 
 
 . When the list 
 
 
 
  cannot be reduced to a list 
 
 
 
  of nonnegative integer pairs in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list 
 
 
 
  from the beginning is not digraphic.
