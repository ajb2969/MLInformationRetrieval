Glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase




Glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + D-glucosamine 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and D-glucosamine 6-phosphate, whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups.1 The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include phosphoglucosamine transacetylase, phosphoglucosamine acetylase, glucosamine-6-phosphate acetylase, D-glucosamine-6-P N-acetyltransferase, aminodeoxyglucosephosphate acetyltransferase, glucosamine 6-phosphate acetylase, glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, phosphoglucosamine N-acetylase, glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase, and glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and aminosugars metabolism.
