Polyhex (mathematics)

In recreational mathematics, a polyhex is a polyform with a regular hexagon (or 'hex' for short) as the base form.
As with polyominoes, polyhexes may be enumerated as free polyhexes (where rotations and reflections count as the same shape), fixed polyhexes (where different orientations count as distinct) and one-sided polyhexes (where mirror images count as distinct but rotations count as identical). They may also be distinguished according to whether they may contain holes. The number of free
