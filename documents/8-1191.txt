   Zahorski theorem      Zahorski theorem   In mathematics , Zahorski's theorem is a theorem of real analysis . It states that a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of the real line to be the set of points of non-differentiability of a continuous real-valued function, is that it be the union of a G δ set and a    G  δ   σ      subscript   subscript  G  δ   σ    {G_{\delta}}_{\sigma}   set of zero measure .  This result was proved by Zygmunt Zahorsk in 1939 and first published in 1941.  References    .   .   "  Category:Real analysis  Category:Theorems in analysis
