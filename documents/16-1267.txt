   Lambda2 method      Lambda2 method   The Lambda2 method , or Lambda2 vortex criterion , is a detection algorithm that can adequately identify vortices from a three-dimensional velocity field . 1 The Lambda2 method is Galilean invariant , which means it produces the same results when a uniform velocity field is added to the existing velocity field or when the field is translated .  Definition  The Lambda2 method consists of several steps. First we define the gradient velocity tensor   𝐉   𝐉   \mathbf{J}   ;       𝐉  ≡   ∇   u  →    =   [       ∂  x    u  x        ∂  y    u  x        ∂  z    u  x          ∂  x    u  y        ∂  y    u  y        ∂  z    u  y          ∂  x    u  z        ∂  y    u  z        ∂  z    u  z       ]    ,        𝐉   normal-∇   normal-→  u             subscript   x    subscript  u  x      subscript   y    subscript  u  x      subscript   z    subscript  u  x        subscript   x    subscript  u  y      subscript   y    subscript  u  y      subscript   z    subscript  u  y        subscript   x    subscript  u  z      subscript   y    subscript  u  z      subscript   z    subscript  u  z         \mathbf{J}\equiv\nabla\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}\partial_{x}u_{x}&\partial_{y}u_{%
 x}&\partial_{z}u_{x}\\
 \partial_{x}u_{y}&\partial_{y}u_{y}&\partial_{z}u_{y}\\
 \partial_{x}u_{z}&\partial_{y}u_{z}&\partial_{z}u_{z}\end{bmatrix},     where    u  →     normal-→  u    \vec{u}   is the velocity field. The gradient velocity tensor is then decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts:      𝐒  =    𝐉  +   𝐉  T    2       𝐒      𝐉   superscript  𝐉  T    2     \mathbf{S}=\frac{\mathbf{J}+\mathbf{J}^{\text{T}}}{2}   and     𝛀  =    𝐉  -   𝐉  T    2    ,      𝛀      𝐉   superscript  𝐉  T    2     \mathbf{\Omega}=\frac{\mathbf{J}-\mathbf{J}^{\text{T}}}{2},     where T is the transpose operation . Next the three eigenvalues of     𝐒  2   +   𝛀  2        superscript  𝐒  2    superscript  𝛀  2     \mathbf{S}^{2}+\mathbf{\Omega}^{2}   are calculated so that for each point in the velocity field    u  →     normal-→  u    \vec{u}   there are three corresponding eigenvalues;    λ  1     subscript  λ  1    \lambda_{1}   ,    λ  2     subscript  λ  2    \lambda_{2}   and    λ  3     subscript  λ  3    \lambda_{3}   . The eigenvalues are ordered in such a way that     λ  1   ≥   λ  2   ≥   λ  3          subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2         subscript  λ  3      \lambda_{1}\geq\lambda_{2}\geq\lambda_{3}   . A point in the velocity field is part of a vortex core only if at least two of its eigenvalues are negative i.e. if     λ  2   <  0       subscript  λ  2   0    \lambda_{2}<0   . This is what gave the Lambda2 method its name.  Using the Lambda2 method, a vortex can be defined as a connected region where    λ  2     subscript  λ  2    \lambda_{2}   is negative. However, in situations where several vortices exist, it can be difficult for this method to distinguish between individual vortices 2 . The Lambda2 method has been used in practice to, for example, identify vortex rings present in the blood flow inside the human heart  3  References  "  Category:Vortices  Category:Computational fluid dynamics     J.
