   Solid torus      Solid torus   In mathematics , a solid torus is the topological space formed by sweeping a disk around a circle . 1 It is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product      S  1   ×   D  2        superscript  S  1    superscript  D  2     S^{1}\times D^{2}   of the disk and the circle, 2 endowed with the product topology . A standard way to visualize a solid torus is as a toroid , embedded in 3-space . However, it should be distinguished from a torus , which has the same visual appearance: the torus is the two-dimensional space on the boundary of a toroid, while the solid torus includes also the interior space surrounded by the torus.  Topological properties  The solid torus is a connected , compact , orientable 3-dimensional manifold with boundary. The boundary is homeomorphic to     S  1   ×   S  1        superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1     S^{1}\times S^{1}   , the ordinary torus .  Since the disk    D  2     superscript  D  2    D^{2}   is contractible , the solid torus has the homotopy type of a circle,    S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   . 3 Therefore the fundamental group and homology groups are isomorphic to those of the circle:         π  1    (    S  1   ×   D  2    )    ≅    π  1    (   S  1   )    ≅  ℤ   ,           subscript  π  1      superscript  S  1    superscript  D  2        subscript  π  1    superscript  S  1         ℤ     \pi_{1}(S^{1}\times D^{2})\cong\pi_{1}(S^{1})\cong\mathbb{Z},            H  k    (    S  1   ×   D  2    )    ≅    H  k    (   S  1   )    ≅   {     ℤ      if  k   =   0  ,  1        0    otherwise       .           subscript  H  k      superscript  S  1    superscript  D  2        subscript  H  k    superscript  S  1          cases  ℤ      if  k    0  1    0  otherwise      H_{k}(S^{1}\times D^{2})\cong H_{k}(S^{1})\cong\begin{cases}\mathbb{Z}&\mbox{ %
 if }k=0,1\\
 0&\mbox{ otherwise }\end{cases}.     See also   Hyperbolic Dehn surgery  Reeb foliation  Whitehead manifold   References  "  Category:Topology     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
