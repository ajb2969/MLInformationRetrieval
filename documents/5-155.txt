Solid torus

 In mathematics, a solid torus is the topological space formed by sweeping a disk around a circle.1 It is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product

 
  of the disk and the circle,2 endowed with the product topology. A standard way to visualize a solid torus is as a toroid, embedded in 3-space. However, it should be distinguished from a torus, which has the same visual appearance: the torus is the two-dimensional space on the boundary of a toroid, while the solid torus includes also the interior space surrounded by the torus.
Topological properties
The solid torus is a connected, compact, orientable 3-dimensional manifold with boundary. The boundary is homeomorphic to 
 
 
 
 , the ordinary torus.
Since the disk 
 
 
 
  is contractible, the solid torus has the homotopy type of a circle, 
 
 
 
 
 .3 Therefore the fundamental group and homology groups are isomorphic to those of the circle:
