   Harrop formula      Harrop formula   In intuitionistic logic , the Harrop formulae , named after Ronald Harrop , are the class of formulae inductively defined as follows: 1 2 3   Atomic formulae are Harrop, including falsity (⊥);        A  ∧  B      A  B    A\wedge B   is Harrop provided   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are;        ¬  F       F    \neg F   is Harrop for any well-formed formula   F   F   F   ;        F  →  A     normal-→  F  A    F\rightarrow A   is Harrop provided   A   A   A   is, and   F   F   F   is any well-formed formula;         ∀  x   .  A     formulae-sequence   for-all  x   A    \forall x.A   is Harrop provided   A   A   A   is.   By excluding disjunction and existential quantification (except in the antecedent of implication), non-constructive predicates are avoided, which has benefits for computer implementation. From a constructivist point of view, Harrop formulae are "well-behaved." For example, in Heyting arithmetic , Harrop formulae satisfy a classical equivalence not usually satisfied in constructive logic: 4       A  ↔   ¬  ¬  A    .     normal-↔  A      A     A\leftrightarrow\neg\neg A.     Harrop formulae were introduced around 1956 by Ronald Harrop and independently by Helena Rasiowa . 5 Variations of the fundamental concept are used in different branches of constructive mathematics and logic programming .  Hereditary Harrop formulae and logic programming  A more complex definition of hereditary Harrop formulae is used in logic programming as a generalisation of horn clauses , and forms the basis for the language λProlog . Hereditary Harrop formulae are defined in terms of two (sometimes three) recursive sets of formulae. In one formulation: 6   Rigid atomic formulae, i.e. constants   r   r   r   or formulae    r   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       r    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      r(t_{1},...,t_{n})   , are hereditary Harrop;        A  ∧  B      A  B    A\wedge B   is hereditary Harrop provided   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are;         ∀  x   .  A     formulae-sequence   for-all  x   A    \forall x.A   is hereditary Harrop provided   A   A   A   is;        G  →  A     normal-→  G  A    G\rightarrow A   is hereditary Harrop provided   A   A   A   is rigidly atomic, and   G   G   G   is a G -formula.   G -formulae are defined as follows: 7   Atomic formulae are G -formulae, including truth(⊤);        A  ∧  B      A  B    A\wedge B   is a G -formula provided   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are;        A  ∨  B      A  B    A\vee B   is a G -formula provided   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are;         ∀  x   .  A     formulae-sequence   for-all  x   A    \forall x.A   is a G -formula provided   A   A   A   is;         ∃  x   .  A     formulae-sequence    x   A    \exists x.A   is a G -formula provided   A   A   A   is;        H  →  A     normal-→  H  A    H\rightarrow A   is a G -formula provided   A   A   A   is, and   H   H   H   is hereditary Harrop.
