Cyanamide hydratase

In enzymology, a cyanamide hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

urea 
 
 
 
  cyanamide + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, urea, and two products, cyanamide and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urea hydro-lyase (cyanamide-forming). This enzyme is also called urea hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in atrazine degradation.
