An n -gonal bipyramid has 2 n  triangle faces, 3 n edges, and 2+ n vertices.  The referenced n -gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.  Right, oblique and concave bipyramids  A right bipyramid has two points above and below the centroid of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called oblique bipyramids . A regular bipyramid has a regular polygon internal face and is usually implied to be a right bipyramid . A right bipyramid can be represented as { }+P for internal polygon P, and a regular n - bipyramid { } + {n}.  A concave bipyramid has a concave interior polygon.      The face-transitive regular bipyramids are the dual polyhedra of the uniform prisms and will generally have isosceles triangle faces.  A bipyramid can be projected on a sphere or globe as n equally spaced lines of longitude going from pole to pole, and bisected by a line around the equator .  Bipyramid faces , projected as spherical triangles , represent the fundamental domains in the dihedral symmetry D nh .  Volume  The volume of a bipyramid is    V  =    2  3   B  h       V      2  3   B  h     \scriptstyle{V=}\tfrac{2}{3}\scriptstyle{Bh}   where B is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. This works for any location of the apex, provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane which contains the base.  The volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular n -sided polygon with side length s and whose height is h is therefore:       V  =    n  6   h   s  2    cot   π  n      .      V      n  6   h   superscript  s  2       π  n       V=\frac{n}{6}hs^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{n}.     Equilateral triangle bipyramids  Only three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are equilateral triangles , and thus the bipyramid is a deltahedron ): the triangular , tetragonal, and pentagonal bipyramids. The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or regular octahedron , counts among the Platonic solids , while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the Johnson solids (J12 and J13).

The rotation group is D n of order 2 n , except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D 4 as subgroups.  The digonal faces of a spherical  2n -bipyramid represents the fundamental domains of dihedral symmetry in three dimensions : D nh , [n,2], (*n22), order 4n . The reflection domains can be shown as alternately colored triangles as mirror images.      D 1h   D 2h   D 3h   D 4h   D 5h   D 6h   ...

There are two types. In one type the 2 n vertices around the center alternate in rings above and below the center. In the other type, the 2 n vertices are on the same plane, but alternate in two radii.  The first has 2-fold rotation axes mid-edge around the sides, reflection planes through the vertices, and n-fold rotation symmetry on its axis, representing symmetry D n d , [2 + ,2 n ], (2*n) , order 2 n . In crystallography , 8-sided and 12-sided scalenohedra exist. 1 All of these forms are isohedrons .  The second has symmetry D n , [2, n ], (*nn2), order 2 n .  The smallest scalenohedron has 8 faces and is topologically identical to the regular octahedron. The second type is a rhombic bipyramid . The first type has 6 vertices can be represented as (0,0,±1), (±1,0, z ), (0,±1,- z ), where z is a parameter between 0 and 1, creating a regular octahedron at z =0.0, and becomes a disphenoid with merged coplanar faces at z =1.0. Beyond 1, it becomes concave.      4-scalenohedron geometric variations   z=0.10   z=0.25   z=0.50   z=0.95   z=1.5    (Figure)  4-scalenohedron-01.png   (Figure)  4-scalenohedron-025.png   (Figure)  4-scalenohedron-05.png   (Figure)  4-scalenohedron-095.png   (Figure)  4-scalenohedron-15.png      Star bipyramids  Self-intersecting bipyramids exist with a star polygon central figure, defined by triangular faces connecting each polygon edge to these two points.

In the following, the apex vertex of the bipyramid is A and an equator vertex is E. The distance between adjacent vertices on the equator EE=1, the apex to equator edge is AE and the distance between the apices is AA. The bipyramid 4-polytope will have V A vertices where the apices of N A bipyramids meet. It will have V E vertices where the type E vertices of N E bipyramids meet. N AE bipyramids meet along each type AE edge. N EE bipyramids meet along each type EE edge. C AE is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an AE edge. C EE is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an EE edge. As cells must fit around an edge, N AA cos −1 (C AA ) ≤ 2π, N AE cos −1 (C AE ) ≤ 2π.      4-polytope Properties   Bipyramid Properties       Dual of   Coxeter diagram     Rectified 5-cell      Rectified tesseract      Rectified 24-cell      Rectified 120-cell      Rectified 16-cell      Rectified cubic honeycomb      Rectified 600-cell      * The rectified 16-cell is the regular 24-cell and vertices are all equivalent – octahedra are regular bipyramids. ** Given numerically due to more complex form.  Higher dimensions  In general, a bipyramid can be seen as an n - polytope constructed with a ( n −1)-polytope in a hyperplane with two points in opposite directions, equal distance perpendicular from the hyperplane. If the ( n −1)-polytope is a regular polytope, it will have identical pyramids  facets . An example is the 16-cell , which is an octahedral bipyramid, and more generally an n- orthoplex is an (n-1)-orthoplex bypyramid.
