Bessel potential

In mathematics, the Bessel potential is a potential (named after Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel) similar to the Riesz potential but with better decay properties at infinity.
If s is a complex number with positive real part then the Bessel potential of order s is the operator


 
  where Δ is the Laplace operator and the fractional power is defined using Fourier transforms.
