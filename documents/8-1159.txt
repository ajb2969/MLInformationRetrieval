Product metric

In mathematics, the product metric is a definition of metric on the Cartesian product of two metric spaces in the category of metric spaces. Another family of choices of metric on the product space is the p product metric, described below, of the Cartesian product of n metric spaces is the p norm of the n-vector of the norms of the n subspaces:


 
  Note that this differs, in general; see (Choice of norm) section below.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be metric spaces and let

Choice of norm
For Euclidean spaces, using the L2 norm gives rise to the Euclidean metric in the product space; however, any other choice of p will lead to a topologically equivalent metric space. In the category of metric spaces (with Lipschitz maps having Lipschitz constant 1), the sup norm is used.
