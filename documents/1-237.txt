   Concentration      Concentration   In chemistry , concentration is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: mass concentration , molar concentration , number concentration , and volume concentration . 1 The term concentration can be applied to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to solutes and solvents in solutions . The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration .  Qualitative description  (Figure)  These glasses containing red dye demonstrate qualitative changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are more dilute, compared to the more concentrated solutions on the right.   Often in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a qualitative way, through the use of adjectives such as "dilute" for solutions of relatively low concentration and "concentrated" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of solvent (for example, water). By contrast, to dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are fully  miscible there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be saturated . If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when supersaturation may occur. Instead, phase separation will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a suspension . The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.  Quantitative notation  There are four quantities that describe concentration:  Mass concentration  The mass concentration    ρ  i     subscript  ρ  i    \rho_{i}   is defined as the mass of a constituent    m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   divided by the volume of the mixture   V   V   V   :        ρ  i   =    m  i   V    .       subscript  ρ  i      subscript  m  i   V     \rho_{i}=\frac{m_{i}}{V}.     The SI unit is kg/m 3 (equal to g/L).  Molar concentration  The molar concentration    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   is defined as the amount of a constituent    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   (in moles) divided by the volume of the mixture   V   V   V   :        c  i   =    n  i   V    .       subscript  c  i      subscript  n  i   V     c_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{V}.     The SI unit is mol/m 3 . However, more commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm 3 ) is used.  Number concentration  The number concentration    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   is defined as the number of entities of a constituent    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture   V   V   V   :        C  i   =    N  i   V    .       subscript  C  i      subscript  N  i   V     C_{i}=\frac{N_{i}}{V}.     The SI unit is 1/m 3 .  Volume concentration  The volume concentration     ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   (do not confuse with volume fraction ) is defined 2 as the volume of a constituent    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   divided by the volume of the mixture   V   V   V   :        ϕ  i   =    V  i   V    .       subscript  ϕ  i      subscript  V  i   V     \phi_{i}=\frac{V_{i}}{V}.     Being dimensionless, it is expressed as a number, e.g., 0.18 or 18%; its unit is 1.  Related quantities  Several other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. Note that these should not be called concentrations. 3  Normality  Normality is defined as the molar concentration    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   divided by an equivalence factor    f  eq     subscript  f  eq    f_{\mathrm{eq}}   . Since the definition of the equivalence factor depends on context (which reaction is being studied), IUPAC and NIST discourage the use of normality.  Molality  (Not to be confused with Molarity )  The molality of a solution    b  i     subscript  b  i    b_{i}   is defined as the amount of a constituent    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   (in moles) divided by the mass of the solvent    m  solvent     subscript  m  solvent    m_{\mathrm{solvent}}   ( not the mass of the solution):        b  i   =    n  i    m  solvent     .       subscript  b  i      subscript  n  i    subscript  m  solvent      b_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{m_{\mathrm{solvent}}}.     The SI unit for molality is mol/kg.  Mole fraction  The mole fraction    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is defined as the amount of a constituent    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   (in moles) divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture    n  tot     subscript  n  tot    n_{\mathrm{tot}}   :        x  i   =    n  i    n  tot     .       subscript  x  i      subscript  n  i    subscript  n  tot      x_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{n_{\mathrm{tot}}}.     The SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole fractions.  Mole ratio  The mole ratio    r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}   is defined as the amount of a constituent    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   divided by the total amount of all other constituents in a mixture:        r  i   =    n  i     n  tot   -   n  i      .       subscript  r  i      subscript  n  i      subscript  n  tot    subscript  n  i       r_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{n_{\mathrm{tot}}-n_{i}}.     If    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   is much smaller than    n  tot     subscript  n  tot    n_{\mathrm{tot}}   , the mole ratio is almost identical to the mole fraction.  The SI unit is mol/mol. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mole ratios.  Mass fraction  The mass fraction    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   is the fraction of one substance with mass    m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   to the mass of the total mixture    m  tot     subscript  m  tot    m_{\mathrm{tot}}   , defined as:        w  i   =    m  i    m  tot     .       subscript  w  i      subscript  m  i    subscript  m  tot      w_{i}=\frac{m_{i}}{m_{\mathrm{tot}}}.     The SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass fractions.  Mass ratio  The mass ratio    ζ  i     subscript  ζ  i    \zeta_{i}   is defined as the mass of a constituent    m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   divided by the total mass of all other constituents in a mixture:        ζ  i   =    m  i     m  tot   -   m  i      .       subscript  ζ  i      subscript  m  i      subscript  m  tot    subscript  m  i       \zeta_{i}=\frac{m_{i}}{m_{\mathrm{tot}}-m_{i}}.     If    m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   is much smaller than    m  tot     subscript  m  tot    m_{\mathrm{tot}}   , the mass ratio is almost identical to the mass fraction.  The SI unit is kg/kg. However, the deprecated parts-per notation is often used to describe small mass ratios.  Dependence on volume  Concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion.
