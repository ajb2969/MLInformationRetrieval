   Beltrami vector field      Beltrami vector field   In vector calculus , a Beltrami vector field , named after Eugenio Beltrami , is a vector field in three dimensions that is parallel to its own curl . That is, F is a Beltrami vector field provided that       𝐅  ×   (   ∇  ×  𝐅   )    =  0.        𝐅    normal-∇  𝐅    0.    \mathbf{F}\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})=0.     If   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   is solenoidal - that is, if     ∇  ⋅  𝐅   =  0       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐅   0    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}=0   such as for an incompressible fluid or a magnetic field, we may examine     ∇  ×   (   ∇  ×  𝐅   )    ≡    -    ∇  2   𝐅    +   ∇   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐅   )           normal-∇    normal-∇  𝐅          superscript  normal-∇  2   𝐅     normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐅       \nabla\times(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})\equiv-\nabla^{2}\mathbf{F}+\nabla(\nabla%
 \cdot\mathbf{F})   and apply this identity twice to find that         -    ∇  2   𝐅    =   ∇  ×   (   λ  𝐅   )            superscript  normal-∇  2   𝐅      normal-∇    λ  𝐅      -\nabla^{2}\mathbf{F}=\nabla\times(\lambda\mathbf{F})        and if we further assume that   λ   λ   \lambda   is a constant, we arrive at the simple form         ∇  2   𝐅   =   -    λ  2   𝐅     .        superscript  normal-∇  2   𝐅        superscript  λ  2   𝐅      \nabla^{2}\mathbf{F}=-\lambda^{2}\mathbf{F}.     Beltrami vector fields with nonzero curl correspond to Euclidean contact forms in three dimensions.  The vector field      𝐅  =    -    z    1  +   z  2      𝐢    +    1    1  +   z  2      𝐣        𝐅          z      1   superscript  z  2      𝐢        1      1   superscript  z  2      𝐣      \mathbf{F}=-\frac{z}{\sqrt{1+z^{2}}}\mathbf{i}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^{2}}}\mathbf%
