Beltrami vector field

In vector calculus, a Beltrami vector field, named after Eugenio Beltrami, is a vector field in three dimensions that is parallel to its own curl. That is, F is a Beltrami vector field provided that



If 
 
 
 
  is solenoidal - that is, if 
 
 
 
  such as for an incompressible fluid or a magnetic field, we may examine 
 
 
 
  and apply this identity twice to find that








and if we further assume that 
 
 
 
  is a constant, we arrive at the simple form



Beltrami vector fields with nonzero curl correspond to Euclidean contact forms in three dimensions.
The vector field


 
  is a multiple of the standard contact structure −z i + j, and furnishes an example of a Beltrami vector field.
