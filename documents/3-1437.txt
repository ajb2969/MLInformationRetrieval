   Hecke operator      Hecke operator   In mathematics , in particular in the theory of modular forms , a Hecke operator , studied by , is a certain kind of "averaging" operator that plays a significant role in the structure of vector spaces of modular forms and more general automorphic representations .  History  used Hecke operators on modular forms in a paper on the special cusp form of Ramanujan , ahead of the general theory given by . Mordell proved that the Ramanujan tau function , expressing the coefficients of the Ramanujan form,         Δ   (  q  )    =   q    (    ∏   n  =  1   ∞    (   1  -   q  n    )    )   24    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    τ   (  n  )    q  n      ,   q  =   e   2  π  i  τ      ,     formulae-sequence        normal-Δ  q     q   superscript    superscript   subscript  product    n  1        1   superscript  q  n     24           superscript   subscript     n  1        τ  n   superscript  q  n         q   superscript  e    2  π  i  τ       \Delta(q)=q\left(\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{n})\right)^{24}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}%
 \tau(n)q^{n},\quad q=e^{2\pi i\tau},     is a multiplicative function :        τ   (   m  n   )    =   τ   (  m  )   τ   (  n  )       for   (  m  ,  n  )    =  1.      formulae-sequence      τ    m  n      τ  m  τ  n        for   m  n    1.     \tau(mn)=\tau(m)\tau(n)\quad\text{ for }(m,n)=1.     The idea goes back to earlier work of Hurwitz , who treated algebraic correspondences between modular curves which realise some individual Hecke operators.  Mathematical description  Hecke operators can be realized in a number of contexts. The simplest meaning is combinatorial, namely as taking for a given integer n some function f (Λ) defined on the lattices of fixed rank to      ∑   f   (   Λ  ′   )          f   superscript  normal-Λ  normal-′      \sum f(\Lambda^{\prime})     with the sum taken over all the Λ′ that are subgroups of Λ of index n . For example, with n=2 and two dimensions, there are three such Λ′. Modular forms are particular kinds of functions of a lattice, subject to conditions making them analytic functions and homogeneous with respect to homotheties , as well as moderate growth at infinity; these conditions are preserved by the summation, and so Hecke operators preserve the space of modular forms of a given weight.  Another way to express Hecke operators is by means of double cosets in the modular group . In the contemporary adelic approach, this translates to double cosets with respect to some compact subgroups.  Explicit formula  Let M m be the set of 2×2 integral matrices with determinant  m and Γ = M 1 be the full modular group  SL (2, Z ). Given a modular form f ( z ) of weight k , the m th Hecke operator acts by the formula         T  m   f   (  z  )    =    m   k  -  1      ∑    (     a    b      c    d     )   ∈   Γ  \   M  m         (    c  z   +  d   )    -  k    f   (     a  z   +  b     c  z   +  d    )       ,         subscript  T  m   f  z      superscript  m    k  1      subscript       a  b    c  d     normal-\  normal-Γ   subscript  M  m         superscript      c  z   d     k    f        a  z   b       c  z   d         T_{m}f(z)=m^{k-1}\sum_{\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right)\in\Gamma\backslash M_{m}}(cz+d)^{-k}f\left(\frac{%
 az+b}{cz+d}\right),     where z is in the upper half-plane and the normalization constant m k −1 assures that the image of a form with integer Fourier coefficients has integer Fourier coefficients. This can be rewritten in the form         T  m   f   (  z  )    =    m   k  -  1      ∑     a  ,  d   >  0   ,    a  d   =  m       1   d  k      ∑   b     (   mod  d   )      f   (     a  z   +  b   d   )         ,         subscript  T  m   f  z      superscript  m    k  1      subscript    formulae-sequence     a  d   0       a  d   m         1   superscript  d  k      subscript    annotated  b   pmod  d       f        a  z   b   d          T_{m}f(z)=m^{k-1}\sum_{a,d>0,ad=m}\frac{1}{d^{k}}\sum_{b\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}%
 }d)}f\left(\frac{az+b}{d}\right),     which leads to the formula for the Fourier coefficients of T m f ( z ) = ∑ b n q n in terms of the Fourier coefficients of f ( z ) = ∑ a n q n :        b  n   =    ∑   r  >  0  ,  r  |   (  m  ,  n  )       r   k  -  1     a    m  n   /   r  2        .       subscript  b  n     subscript    fragments  r   0  normal-,  r  normal-|   fragments  normal-(  m  normal-,  n  normal-)        superscript  r    k  1     subscript  a      m  n    superscript  r  2         b_{n}=\sum_{r>0,r|(m,n)}r^{k-1}a_{mn/r^{2}}.     One can see from this explicit formula that Hecke operators with different indices commute and that if a 0 = 0 then b 0 = 0, so the subspace S k of cusp forms of weight k is preserved by the Hecke operators. If a (non-zero) cusp form f is a simultaneous eigenform of all Hecke operators T m with eigenvalues λ m then a m = λ m a 1 and a 1 ≠ 0. Hecke eigenforms are normalized so that a 1 = 1, then         T  m   f   =    a  m   f    ,      a  m    a  n    =     ∑   r  >  0  ,  r  |   (  m  ,  n  )       r   k  -  1     a    m  n   /   r  2       ,  m    ,   n  ≥  1.       formulae-sequence       subscript  T  m   f      subscript  a  m   f     formulae-sequence       subscript  a  m    subscript  a  n       subscript    fragments  r   0  normal-,  r  normal-|   fragments  normal-(  m  normal-,  n  normal-)        superscript  r    k  1     subscript  a      m  n    superscript  r  2       m      n  1.      T_{m}f=a_{m}f,\quad a_{m}a_{n}=\sum_{r>0,r|(m,n)}r^{k-1}a_{mn/r^{2}},\ m,n\geq
 1.     Thus for normalized cuspidal Hecke eigenforms of integer weight, their Fourier coefficients coincide with their Hecke eigenvalues.  Hecke algebras  Algebras of Hecke operators are called Hecke algebras , and are commutative rings . Other, related, mathematical rings are called Hecke algebras , although the link to Hecke operators is not entirely obvious. These algebras include certain quotients of the group algebras of braid groups . The presence of this commutative operator algebra plays a significant role in the harmonic analysis of modular forms and generalisations. In the classical elliptic modular form theory, the Hecke operators T n with n coprime to the level acting on the space of cusp forms of a given weight are self-adjoint with respect to the Petersson inner product . Therefore, the spectral theorem implies that there is a basis of modular forms that are eigenfunctions for these Hecke operators. Each of these basic forms possesses an Euler product . More precisely, its Mellin transform is the Dirichlet series that has Euler products with the local factor for each prime p is the inverse of the Hecke polynomial , a quadratic polynomial in p − s . In the case treated by Mordell, the space of cusp forms of weight 12 with respect to the full modular group is one-dimensional. It follows that the Ramanujan form has an Euler product and establishes the multiplicativity of τ ( n ).  See also   Eichler–Shimura congruence relation   References    (See chapter 8.)
