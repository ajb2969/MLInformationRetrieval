   Cyclohexanone dehydrogenase      Cyclohexanone dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cyclohexanone dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes a chemical reaction   cyclohexanone + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyclohex-2-enone + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyclohexanone and acceptor , whereas its two products are cyclohex-2-enone and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclohexanone:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called cyclohexanone:(acceptor) 2-oxidoreductase .
