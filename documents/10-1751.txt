   Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase      Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , an ethanolamine ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ethanolamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetaldehyde + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , ethanolamine , and two products , acetaldehyde and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (acetaldehyde-forming) . This enzyme is also called ethanolamine deaminase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , adenosylcobalamin .  Structural studies  As of early 2011, several structures have been solved for this class of enzymes. The first structure solved was the active site containing EutB subunit of EAL from Listeria monocytogenes with the PDB accession code . Later, more structures have become available from Escherichia coli that include both EAL subunits bound to various ligands.
