It is called paracompact because it has infinite cells and vertex figures , with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. It has Schläfli symbol {3,6,3}, being composed of triangular tiling cells. Each edge of the honeycomb is surrounded by three cells, and each vertex is ideal with infinitely many cells meeting there. Its vertex figure is a hexagonal tiling .  Symmetry  ]  It has two lower reflective symmetry constructions, as an alternated  order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb ,  ↔ , and as  from , which alternates 3 types (colors) of triangular tilings around every edge. In Coxeter notation , the removal of the 3rd and 4th mirrors, [3,6,3 * ] creates a new Coxeter group [3 [3,3] ], , subgroup index 6. The fundamental domain is 6 times larger. By Coxeter diagram there are 3 copies of the first original mirror in the new fundamental domain:  ↔ .  {{-}}  Images  It is similar to the 2D hyperbolic infinite-order apeirogonal tiling , {∞,∞} with infinite apeirogonal faces and all vertices are on the ideal surface.      Related honeycombs  It is one of 15 regular hyperbolic honeycombs in 3-space, 11 of which like this one are paracompact, with infinite cells or vertex figures.  There are nine uniform honeycombs in the [3,6,3] Coxeter group family, including this regular form as well as the bitruncated form, t 1,2 {3,6,3},  with all truncated hexagonal tiling facets.
