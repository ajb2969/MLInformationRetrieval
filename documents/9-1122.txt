   Anderson's theorem      Anderson's theorem   In mathematics , Anderson's theorem is a result in real analysis and geometry which says that the integral of an integrable, symmetric, unimodal, non-negative function f over an n -dimensional convex body  K does not decrease if K is translated inwards towards the origin. This is a natural statement, since the graph of f can be thought of as a hill with a single peak over the origin; however, for n ≥ 2, the proof is not entirely obvious, as there may be points x of the body K where the value f ( x ) is larger than at the corresponding translate of x .  Anderson's theorem also has an interesting application to probability theory .  Statement of the theorem  Let K be a convex body in n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n that is symmetric with respect to reflection in the origin, i.e. K = − K . Let f : R n → R be a non- negative , symmetric, globally integrable function; i.e.   f ( x ) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R n ;  f ( x ) = f (− x ) for all x ∈ R n ;         ∫   ℝ  n     f   (  x  )   d  x    <   +  ∞    .        subscript    superscript  ℝ  n      f  x  normal-d  x          \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x<+\infty.      Suppose also that the super- level sets  L ( f , t ) of f , defined by        L   (  f  ,  t  )    =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  n    |    f   (  x  )    ≥  t   }    ,        L   f  t     conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  n        f  x   t      L(f,t)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}|f(x)\geq t\},     are convex subsets of R n for every t ≥ 0. (This property is sometimes referred to as being unimodal .) Then, for any 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 and y ∈ R n ,         ∫  K    f   (   x  +   c  y    )   d  x    ≥    ∫  K    f   (   x  +  y   )   d  x     .        subscript   K     f    x    c  y    normal-d  x      subscript   K     f    x  y   normal-d  x      \int_{K}f(x+cy)\,\mathrm{d}x\geq\int_{K}f(x+y)\,\mathrm{d}x.     Application to probability theory  Given a probability space (Ω, Σ, Pr), suppose that X : Ω → R n is an R n -valued random variable with probability density function  f : R n → [0, +∞) and that Y : Ω → R n is an independent random variable. The probability density functions of many well-known probability distributions are p - concave for some p , and hence unimodal. If they are also symmetric (e.g. the Laplace and normal distributions ), then Anderson's theorem applies, in which case       Pr   (   X  ∈  K   )    ≥   Pr   (    X  +  Y   ∈  K   )         Pr    X  K     Pr      X  Y   K      \Pr(X\in K)\geq\Pr(X+Y\in K)     for any origin-symmetric convex body K ⊆ R n .
