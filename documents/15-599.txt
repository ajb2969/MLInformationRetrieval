Heat is transferred to and from matter by the principal energy carriers. The state of energy stored within matter, or transported by the carriers, is described by a combination of classical and quantum statistical mechanics . The energy is also transformed (converted) among various carriers. The heat transfer processes (or kinetics) are governed by the rates at which various related physical phenomena occur, such as (for example) the rate of particle collisions in classical mechanics . These various states and kinetics determine the heat transfer, i.e., the net rate of energy storage or transport. Governing these process from the atomic level (atom or molecule length scale) to macroscale are the laws of thermodynamics , including conservation of energy .  Introduction  Heat is thermal energy associated with temperature-dependent motion of particles. The macroscopic energy equation for infinitesimal volume used in heat transfer analysis is 4        ∇  ⋅  𝐪   =    -   ρ   c  p     ∂  T    ∂  t      +    ∑   i  ,  j      s  ˙    i  -  j       ,       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐪         ρ   subscript  c  p       T     t        subscript    i  j     subscript   normal-˙  s     i  j        \nabla\cdot\mathbf{q}=-\rho c_{p}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}+\sum_{i,j}\dot{%
 s}_{i-j},     where q is heat flux vector, - ρc p ( ∂T / ∂t ) is temporal change of internal energy ( ρ is density, c p is specific heat capacity at constant pressure, T is temperature and t is time), and    s  ˙     normal-˙  s    \textstyle\dot{s}   is the energy conversion to and from thermal energy ( i and j are for principal energy carriers). So, the terms represent energy transport, storage and transformation. Heat flux vector q is composed of three macroscopic fundamental modes, which are conduction ( q k = - k ∇ T , k : thermal conductivity), convection ( q u = ρc p u T , u : velocity), and radiation ( q r =    2  π    ∫  0  ∞    ∫  0  π        2  π    superscript   subscript   0      superscript   subscript   0   π      2\pi\textstyle\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\pi}    s  I ph,ω sin θdθdω , ω : angular frequency, θ : polar angle, I ph,ω : spectral, directional radiation intensity, s : unit vector), i.e., q = q k + q u + q r .  Once states and kinetics of the energy conversion and thermophysical properties are known, the fate of heat transfer is described by the above equation. These atomic-level mechanisms and kinetics are addressed in heat transfer physics. The microscopic thermal energy is stored, transported, and transformed by the principal energy carriers: phonons ( p ), electrons ( e ), fluid particles ( f ), and photons ( ph ). 5  Length and time scales  Thermophysical properties of matter and the kinetics of interaction and energy exchange among the principal carriers are based on the atomic-level configuration and interaction. 6 Transport properties such as thermal conductivity are calculated from these atomic-level properties using classical and quantum physics . 7 8 Quantum states of principal carriers (e.g.. momentum, energy) are derived from the Schrödinger equation (called first principle or ab initio ) and the interaction rates (for kinetics) are calculated using the quantum states and the quantum perturbation theory (formulated as the Fermi golden rule ). 9 Variety of ab initio (Latin for from the beginning) solvers (software) exist (e.g., ABINIT , CASTEP , Gaussian , Q-Chem , Quantum ESPRESSO , SIESTA , VASP , WIEN2k ). Electrons in the inner shells (core) are not involved in heat transfer, and calculations are greatly reduced by proper approximations about the inner-shells electrons. 10  The quantum treatments, including equilibrium and nonequilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), involving larger lengths and times are limited by the computation resources, so various alternate treatments with simplifying assumptions have been used and kinetics. 11 In classical (Newtonian) MD, the motion of atom or molecule (particles) is based on the empirical or effective interaction potentials, which in turn can be based on curve-fit of ab initio calculations or curve-fit to thermophysical properties. From the ensembles of simulated particles, static or dynamics thermal properties or scattering rates are derived. 12 13  At yet larger length scales (mesoscale, involving many mean free paths), the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) which is based on the classical Hamiltonian-statistical mechanics is applied. BTE considers particle states in terms of position and momentum vectors ( x , p ) and this is represented as the sate occupation probability. The occupation has equilibrium distributions (the known boson, fermion, and Maxwell–Boltzmann particles) and transport of energy (heat) is due to nonequilibrium (cause by a driving force or potential). Central to the transport is the role of scattering which turn the distribution toward equilibrium). The scattering is presented by the relations time or the mean free path. The relaxation time (or its inverse which is the interaction rate) is found from other calculations ( ab initio or MD) or empirically. BTE can be numerically solved with Monte Carlo method , etc. 14  Depending on the length and time scale the proper level of treatment ( ab initio , MD, or BTE). Heat transfer physics analyses may involve multiple scales (e.g., BTE using interaction rate from ab initio or classical MD) with states and kinetic related to thermal energy storage, transport and transformation.  So, heat transfer physics covers the four principal energy carries and their kinetics from classical and quantum mechanical perspectives. This enables multiscale ( ab initio , MD, BTE and macroscale) analyses, including low-dimensionality and size effects. 15  Phonon  Phonon (quantized lattice vibration wave) is a central thermal energy carrier contributing to heat capacity (sensible heat storage) and conductive heat transfer in condensed phase, and plays very important role in thermal energy conversion. Its transport properties are represented by the phonon conductivity tensor K p (W/m-K, from the Fourier law q k,p = - K p ⋅∇ T ) for bulk materials, and the phonon boundary resistance AR p,b [K/(W/m 2 )] for solid interfaces, where A is the interface area. The phonon specific heat capacity c v,p (J/kg-K) includes the quantum effect. The thermal energy conversion rate involving phonon is included in     s  ˙    i  -  j      subscript   normal-˙  s     i  -  j     \dot{s}_{i\mbox{-}j}   . Heat transfer physics describes and predicts, c v,p , K p , R p,b (or conductance G p,b ) and     s  ˙    i  -  j      subscript   normal-˙  s     i  -  j     \dot{s}_{i\mbox{-}j}   , based on atomic-level properties.  For an equilibrium potential ⟨ φ ⟩ o of a system with N atoms, the total potential ⟨ φ ⟩ is found by a Taylor series expansion at the equilibrium and this can be approximated by the second derivatives (the harmonic approximation) as       ⟨  φ  ⟩   =     ⟨  φ  ⟩   o   +       ∑  i     ∑  α     ∂   ⟨  φ  ⟩     ∂   d   i  α        |   o    d   i  α     +       1  2     ∑   i  ,  j      ∑   α  ,  β       ∂  2    ⟨  φ  ⟩      ∂   d   i  α      ∂   d   j  β          |   o    d   i  α     d   j  β     +       1  6     ∑   i  ,  j  ,  k      ∑   α  ,  β  ,  γ       ∂  3    ⟨  φ  ⟩      ∂   d   i  α      ∂   d   j  β      ∂   d   k  γ          |   o    d   i  α     d   j  β     d   k  γ     +   …  +         delimited-⟨⟩  φ      subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  φ   normal-o      evaluated-at    subscript   i     subscript   α       φ      subscript  d    i  α        normal-o    subscript  d    i  α        evaluated-at      1  2     subscript    i  j      subscript    α  β        superscript   2   φ        subscript  d    i  α        subscript  d    j  β          normal-o    subscript  d    i  α     subscript  d    j  β        evaluated-at      1  6     subscript    i  j  k      subscript    α  β  γ        superscript   3   φ        subscript  d    i  α        subscript  d    j  β        subscript  d    k  γ          normal-o    subscript  d    i  α     subscript  d    j  β     subscript  d    k  γ      limit-from  normal-…       \qquad\qquad\langle\varphi\rangle=\langle\varphi\rangle_{\mathrm{o}}+\sum_{i}%

The atomic displacement is the summation over the normal modes [ s α : unit vector of mode α , ω p : angular frequency of wave, and κ p : wave vector].

Solving this eigenvalue equation gives the relation between the angular frequency ω p and the wave vector κ p , and this relation is called the phonon dispersion relation . Thus, the phonon dispersion relation is determined by matrices M and D , which depend on the atomic structure and the strength of interaction among constituent atoms (the stronger the interaction and the lighter the atoms, the higher is the phonon frequency and the larger is the slope dω p / d κ p ). The Hamiltonian of phonon system with the harmonic approximation is 18 19 20         H   p   =     ∑  x     1   2  m     𝐩  2    (  𝐱  )     +    1  2     ∑   𝐱  ,   𝐱  ′       𝐝  i    (  𝐱  )    D   i  j     (   𝐱  -   𝐱  ′    )    𝐝  j    (   𝐱  ′   )        ,       subscript  normal-H  p       subscript   x       1    2  m     superscript  𝐩  2   𝐱        1  2     subscript    𝐱   superscript  𝐱  normal-′        subscript  𝐝  i   𝐱   subscript  D    i  j      𝐱   superscript  𝐱  normal-′     subscript  𝐝  j    superscript  𝐱  normal-′         \qquad\qquad\mathrm{H}_{p}=\sum_{x}\frac{1}{2m}\mathbf{p}^{2}(\mathbf{x})+%

The energy of quantum-harmonic oscillator is E p = ∑ κ , α [ f p ( κ , α ) + 1/2] ħω p,α ( κ p ), and thus the quantum of phonon energy ħω p .  The phonon dispersion relation gives all possible phonon modes within the Brillouin zone (zone within the primitive cell in reciprocal space ), and the phonon density of states  D p (the number density of possible phonon modes). The phonon group velocity  u p,g is the slope of the dispersion curve, dω p / d κ p . Since phonon is a boson particle, its occupancy follows the Bose–Einstein distribution { f p o = [exp( ħω p / k B T )-1] −1 , k B : Boltzmann constant }. Using the phonon density of states and this occupancy distribution, the phonon energy is E p ( T ) = ∫ D p ( ω p ) f p ( ω p ,T ) ħω p dω p , and the phonon density is n p ( T ) = ∫ D p ( ω p ) f p ( ω p ,T ) dω p . Phonon heat capacity c v,p (in solid c v,p = c p,p , c v,p : constant-volume heat capacity, c p,p : constant-pressure heat capacity) is the temperature derivatives of phonon energy for the Debye model (linear dispersion model), is 21        c    v  ,  p    =    d   E  p     d  T     |  v   =    9   k  B    m     (   T   T  D    )   3   n   ∫  0    T  D   /  T       x  4    e  x      (    e  x   -  1   )   2    d  x   (  x  =    ℏ  ω     k  B   T    )   ,     fragments   subscript  c   v  p         d   subscript  E  p      d  T     subscript  normal-|  v        9   subscript  k  normal-B    m    superscript   fragments  normal-(    T   subscript  T  D    normal-)   3   n   superscript   subscript   0      subscript  T  D   T         superscript  x  4    superscript  e  x     superscript     superscript  e  x   1   2    d  x  italic-   fragments  normal-(  x       Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω      subscript  k  normal-B   T    normal-)   normal-,    \qquad\qquad c_{v,p}=\frac{dE_{p}}{dT}|_{v}=\frac{9k_{\mathrm{B}}}{m}(\frac{T}%

 \frac{\hbar\omega}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}),     where T D is the Debye temperature , m is atomic mass, and n is the atomic number density (number density of phonon modes for the crystal 3 n ). This gives the Debye T 3 law at low temperature and Dulong-Petit law at high temperatures.  From the kinetic theory of gases, 22 thermal conductivity of principal carrier i ( p , e , f and ph ) is         k   i   =    1  3    n  i    c   v  ,  i     u  i    λ  i     ,       subscript  k  i       1  3    subscript  n  i    subscript  c   v  i     subscript  u  i    subscript  λ  i      \qquad\qquad k_{i}=\frac{1}{3}n_{i}c_{v,i}u_{i}\lambda_{i},     where n i is the carrier density and the heat capacity is per carrier, u i is the carrier speed and λ i is the mean free path (distance traveled by carrier before an scattering event). Thus, the larger the carrier density, heat capacity and speed, and the less significant the scattering, the higher is the conductivity. For phonon λ p represents the interaction (scattering) kinetics of phonons and is related to the scattering relaxation time τ p or rate (= 1/ τ p ) through λ p = u p τ p . Phonons interact with other phonons, and with electrons, boundaries, impurities, etc., and λ p combines these interaction mechanisms through the Matthiessen rule . At low temperatures, scattering by boundaries is dominant and with increase in temperature the interaction rate with impurities, electron and other phonons become important, and finally the phonon-phonon scattering dominants for T > 0.2 T D . The interaction rates are reviewed in 23 and includes quantum perturbation theory and MD.

 only)},     where ⟨M⟩ is the mean atomic weight of the atoms in the primitive cell, V a =1/ n is the average volume per atom, T D,∞ is the high-temperature Debye temperature, T is the temperature, N o is the number of atoms in the primitive cell, and ⟨γ 2 G ⟩ is the mode-averaged square of the Grüneisen constant or parameter at high temperatures. This model is widely tested with pure nonmetallic crystals, and the overall agreement is good, even for complex crystals.  Based on the kinetics and atomic structure consideration, a material with high crystalline and strong interactions, composed of light atoms (such as diamond and graphene) is expected to have large phonon conductivity. Solids with more than one atom in the smallest unit cell representing the lattice have two types of phonons, i.e., acoustic and optical. (Acoustic phonons are in-phase movements of atoms about their equilibrium positions, while optical phonons are out-of-phase movement of adjacent atoms in the lattice.) Optical phonons have higher energies (frequencies), but make smaller contribution to conduction heat transfer, because of their smaller group velocity and occupancy.  Phonon transport across hetero-structure boundaries (represented with R p,b , phonon boundary resistance ) according to the boundary scattering approximations are modeled as acoustic and diffuse mismatch models. 35 Larger phonon transmission (small R p,b ) occurs at boundaries where material pairs have similar phonon properties ( u p , D p , etc.), and in contract large R p,b occurs when some material is softer (lower cut-off phonon frequency) than the other.  Electron  Quantum electron energy states for electron are found using the electron quantum Hamiltonian, which is generally composed of kinetic (- ħ 2 ∇ 2 /2 m e ) and potential energy terms ( φ e ). Atomic orbital, a mathematical function describing the wave-like behavior of either an electron or a pair of electrons in an atom , can be found from the Schrödinger equation with this electron Hamiltonian. Hydrogen-like atoms (a nucleus and an electron) allow for closed-form solution to Schrödinger equation with the electrostatic potential (the Coulomb law ). The Schrödinger equation of atoms or atomic ions with more than one electron has not been solved analytically, because of the Coulomb interactions among electrons. Thus, numerical techniques are used, and an electron configuration in approximated as product of simpler hydrogen-like atomic orbitals (isolate electron orbitals). Molecules with multiple atoms (nuclei and their electrons) have molecular orbital (MO, a mathematical function for the wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule), and are obtained from simplified solution techniques such as linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The molecular orbital is used to predict chemical and physical properties, and the difference between highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO ) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO ) is a measure of excitability of the molecules.  In a crystal structure of metallic solids, the free electron model (zero potential, φ e = 0) for the behavior of valence electrons is used. However, in a periodic lattice (crystal) , there is periodic crystal potential, so the electron Hamiltonian becomes 36         H   e   =    -     ℏ  2    2   m  e      ∇  2     +    φ  c    (  𝐱  )      ,       subscript  normal-H  e            superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2   subscript  m  e      superscript  normal-∇  2        subscript  φ  c   𝐱      \qquad\qquad\mathrm{H}_{e}=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{e}}\nabla^{2}+\varphi_{c}(%
 \mathbf{x}),     where m e is the electron mass, and the periodic potential is expressed as φ c ( x ) = ∑ g  φ g exp[ i ( g ∙ x )] ( g : reciprocal lattice vector). The time-independent Schrödinger equation with this Hamiltonian is given as (the eigenvalue equation)          H   e    ψ   e  ,  𝐱     (  𝐱  )    =    E  e    (   𝜿  e   )    ψ   e  ,  𝐱     (  𝐱  )     ,         subscript  normal-H  e    subscript  ψ   e  𝐱    𝐱      subscript  E  e    subscript  𝜿  e    subscript  ψ   e  𝐱    𝐱     \qquad\qquad\mathrm{H}_{e}\psi_{e,\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x})=E_{e}(\boldsymbol{%
 \kappa}_{e})\psi_{e,\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x}),     where the eigenfunction ψ e,κ is the electron wave function, and eigenvalue E e ( κ e ), is the electron energy ( κ e : electron wavevector). The relation between wavevector, κ e and energy E e provides the electronic band structure . In practice, a lattice as many-body systems includes interactions between electrons and nuclei in potential, but this calculation can be too intricate. Thus, many approximate techniques have been suggested and one of them is density functional theory (DFT), uses functionals of the spatially dependent electron density instead of full interactions. DFT is widely used in ab initio software ( ABINIT , CASTEP , Quantum ESPRESSO , SIESTA , VASP , WIEN2k , etc.). The electron specific heat is based on the energy states and occupancy distribution (the Fermi–Dirac statistics ). In general, the heat capacity of electron is small except at very high temperature when they are in thermal equilibrium with phonons (lattice). Electrons contribute to heat conduction (in addition to charge carrying) in solid, especially in metals. Thermal conductivity tensor in solid is the sum of electric and phonon thermal conductivity tensors K = K e + K p .  Electrons are affected by two thermodynamic forces [from the charge, ∇( E F / e c ) where E F is the Fermi level and e c is the electron charge and temperature gradient, ∇(1/ T )] because they carry both charge and thermal energy, and thus electric current j e and heat flow q are described with the thermoelectric tensors ( A ee , A et , A te , and A tt ) from the Onsager reciprocal relations 37 as        𝐣   e   =      𝐀   e  e    ⋅   ∇    E  F    e  c      +    𝐀   e  t    ⋅   ∇   1  T      ,  and        subscript  𝐣  e       normal-⋅   subscript  𝐀    e  e     normal-∇     subscript  E  normal-F    subscript  e  c       normal-⋅   subscript  𝐀    e  t     normal-∇    1  T      and     \qquad\qquad\mathbf{j}_{e}=\mathbf{A}_{ee}\cdot\nabla\frac{E_{\mathrm{F}}}{e_{%

Various carriers (electrons, magnons , phonons, and polarons ) and their interactions substantially affect the Seebeck coefficient. 38 39 The Seebeck coefficient can be decomposed with two contributions, α S = α S,pres + α S,trans , where α S,pres is the sum of contributions to the carrier-induced entropy change, i.e., α S,pres = α S,mix + α S,spin + α S,vib ( α S,mix : entropy-of-mixing, α S,spin : spin entropy, and α S,vib : vibrational entropy). The other contribution α S,trans is the net energy transferred in moving a carrier divided by qT ( q : carrier charge). The electron's contributions to the Seebeck coefficient are mostly in α S,pres . The α S,mix is usually dominant in lightly doped semiconductors. The change of the entropy-of-mixing upon adding an electron to a system is the so-called Heikes formula         α    S  ,  mix    =    1  q     ∂   S  mix     ∂  N     =     k  B   q   ln   (    1  -   f  e  o     f  e  o    )     ,         subscript  α   normal-S  mix        1  q        subscript  S  mix      N               subscript  k  normal-B   q   ln      1   superscript   subscript  f  e   normal-o     superscript   subscript  f  e   normal-o        \qquad\qquad\alpha_{\mathrm{S,mix}}=\frac{1}{q}\frac{\partial S_{\mathrm{mix}}%
 }{\partial N}=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{q}\mathrm{ln}(\frac{1-f_{e}^{\mathrm{o}}}{%
 f_{e}^{\mathrm{o}}}),     where f e o = N / N a is the ratio of electrons to sites (carrier concentration). Using the chemical potential ( µ ), the thermal energy ( k B T ) and the Fermi function, above equation can be expressed in an alternative form, α S,mix = ( k B / q )[( E e - µ )/( k B T )]. Extending the Seebeck effect to spins, a ferromagnetic alloy can be a good example. The contribution to the Seebeck coefficient that results from electrons’ presence altering the systems spin entropy is given by α S,spin = Δ S spin / q = ( k B / q )ln[(2 s + 1)/(2 s 0 +1)], where s 0 and s are net spins of the magnetic site in the absence and presence of the carrier, respectively. Many vibrational effects with electrons also contribute to the Seebeck coefficient. The softening of the vibrational frequencies produces a change of the vibrational entropy is one of examples. The vibrational entropy is the negative derivative of the free energy, i.e.,         S   vib   =   -    ∂   F  mix     ∂  T     =   3  N   k  B   T    ∫  0  ω     {      ℏ  ω    2   k  B   T    coth   (    ℏ  ω    2   k  B   T    )    -   ln   [   2  s  i  n  h   (    ℏ  ω    2   k  B   T    )    ]     }    D  p    (  ω  )   d  ω      ,         subscript  S  vib          subscript  F  mix      T            3  N   subscript  k  normal-B   T    superscript   subscript   0   ω              Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω     2   subscript  k  normal-B   T    coth      Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω     2   subscript  k  normal-B   T       ln   delimited-[]    2  normal-s  normal-i  normal-n  normal-h      Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω     2   subscript  k  normal-B   T          subscript  D  p   ω  d  ω        \qquad\qquad S_{\mathrm{vib}}=-\frac{\partial F_{\mathrm{mix}}}{\partial T}=3%

For the high-temperature limit and series expansions of the hyperbolic functions, the above is simplified as α S,vib = (Δ S vib / q ) = ( k B / q )∑ i (-Δ ω i / ω i ).  The Seebeck coefficient derived in the above Onsager formulation is the mixing component α S,mix , which dominates in most semiconductors.

Electrons accelerated by an electric field are relaxed through the energy conversion to phonon (in semiconductors, mostly optical phonon), which is called Joule heating . Energy conversion between electric potential and phonon energy is considered in thermoelectrics such as Peltier cooling and thermoelectric generator. Also, study of interaction with photons is central in optoelectronic applications (i.e. light-emitting diode , solar photovoltaic cells , etc.). Interaction rates or energy conversion rates can be evaluated using the Fermi golden rule (from the perturbation theory) with ab initio approach.  Fluid particle  Fluid particle is the smallest unit (atoms or molecules) in the fluid phase (gas, liquid or plasma) without breaking any chemical bond. Energy of fluid particle is divided into potential, electronic, translational, vibrational, and rotational energies. The heat (thermal) energy storage in fluid particle is through the temperature-dependent particle motion (translational, vibrational, and rotational energies). The electronic energy is included only if temperature is high enough to ionize or dissociate the fluid particles or to include other electronic transitions. These quantum energy states of the fluid particles are found using their respective quantum Hamiltonian. These are H f,t = -( ħ 2 /2 m )∇ 2 , H f,v = -( ħ 2 /2 m )∇ 2 + Γ x 2 /2 and H f,r = -( ħ 2 /2 I f )∇ 2 for translational, vibrational and rotational modes. (Γ: spring constant , I f : the moment of inertia for the molecule). From the Hamiltonian, the quantized fluid particle energy state E f and partition functions  Z f [with the Maxwell–Boltzmann (MB) occupancy distribution ] are found as 40          translational    E   f  ,  t  ,  n     =      π  2    ℏ  2     2  m     (     n  x  2    L  2    +    n  y  2    L  2    +    n  z  2    L  2     )       and    Z   f  ,  t      ∑   i  =  0   ∞     g   f  ,  t  ,  i    exp   (   -    E   f  ,  t  ,  i      k  B   T     )       =   V    (    m   k  B   T    2  π   ℏ  2     )    3  /  2       ,     formulae-sequence     translational   subscript  E   f  t  n            superscript  π  2    superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2      2  m         superscript   subscript  n  x   2    superscript  L  2       superscript   subscript  n  y   2    superscript  L  2       superscript   subscript  n  z   2    superscript  L  2          and     subscript  Z   f  t      superscript   subscript     i  0         subscript  g   f  t  i    exp       subscript  E   f  t  i       subscript  k  normal-B   T           V   superscript      m   subscript  k  normal-B   T     2  π   superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2       3  2        \qquad\qquad\mathrm{translational}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ E_{f,t,n}=\frac{\pi^%

For calculation of k f , the equilibrium MD with Green–Kubo relations , which express the transport coefficients in terms of integrals of time correlation functions (considering fluctuation), or nonequilibrium MD (prescribing heat flux or temperature difference in simulated system) are generally employed.  Fluid particles can interact with other principal particles. Vibrational or rotational modes, which have relatively high energy, are excited or decay through the interaction with photons. Gas lasers employ the interaction kinetics between fluid particles and photons, and laser cooling has been also considered in CO 2 gas laser. 42 43 Also, fluid particles can be adsorbed on solid surfaces ( physisorption and chemisorption ), and the frustrated vibrational modes in adsorbates (fluid particles) is decayed by creating e − - h + pairs or phonons. These interaction rates are also calculated through ab initio calculation on fluid particle and the Fermi golden rule. 44  Photon  Photon is the quanta of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and energy carrier for radiation heat transfer .

This can be obtained using the transition dipole moment μ e with the FGR and relationship between Einstein coefficients. Averaging σ ph,ω over ω gives the average photon absorption coefficient σ ph .  For the case of optically thick medium of length L , i.e., σ ph L >> 1, and using the gas kinetic theory, the photon conductivity k ph is 16 σ SB T 3 /3 σ ph ( σ SB : Stefan–Boltzmann constant , σ ph : average photon absorption), and photon heat capacity n ph c v,ph is 16 σ SB T 3 / u ph .  Photons have the largest range of energy and central in a variety of energy conversions. Photons interact with electric and magnetic entities. For example electric dipole which in turn are excited by optical phonons or fluid particle vibration, or transition dipole moments of electronic transitions. In heat transfer physics, the interaction kinetics of phonon is treated using the perturbation theory (the Fermi golden rule) and the interaction Hamiltonian.

Photons also participate in ternary interactions, e.g., phonon-assisted photon absorption/emission (transition of electron energy level). 56 57 The vibrational mode in fluid particles can decay or become excited by emitting or absorbing photons. Examples are solid and molecular gas laser cooling. 58 59 60  Using ab initio calculations based on the first principles along with EM theory, various radiative properties such as dielectric function ( electrical permittivity , ε e,ω ), spectral absorption coefficient ( σ ph,ω ), and the complex refraction index ( m ω ), are calculated for various interactions between photons and electric/magnetic entities in matter. 61 62 For example, the imaginary part ( ε e,c,ω ) of complex dielectric function ( ε e,ω = ε e,r,ω + i  ε e,c,ω ) for electronic transition across a bandgap is 63        ϵ    e  ,  c  ,  ω    =     4   π  2      ω  2   V      ∑    i   \isin   VB   ,   j   \isin   CB       ∑  κ     w  κ     |   p   i  j    |   2   δ   (    E   κ  ,  j    -   E   κ  ,  i    -   ℏ  ω    )        ,       subscript  ϵ   e  c  ω          4   superscript  π  2       superscript  ω  2   V      subscript      i  \isin  VB     j  \isin  CB       subscript   κ      subscript  w  κ    superscript     subscript  p    i  j     2   δ     subscript  E   κ  j     subscript  E   κ  i      Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω          \qquad\qquad\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \epsilon_{e,c,\omega}=\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\omega%

From these dielectric function ( ε e,ω ) calculations (e.g., Abinit , VASP , etc.), the complex refractive index m ω (= n ω + i  κ ω , n ω : refraction index and κ ω : extinction index) is found, i.e., m ω 2 = ε e,ω = ε e,r,ω + i  ε e,c,ω ).
