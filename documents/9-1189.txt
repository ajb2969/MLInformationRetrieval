Feller's coin-tossing constants

Feller's coin-tossing constants are a set of numerical constants which describe asymptotic probabilities that in n independent tosses of a fair coin, no run of k consecutive heads (or, equally, tails) appears.
William Feller showed1 that if this probability is written as p(n,k) then



where αk is the smallest positive real root of



and

For 
 
 
 
  the constants are related to the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers; the constants are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For higher values of 
 
 
 
 
  they are related to generalizations of Fibonacci numbers such as the tribonacci and tetranacci constants.
Example
If we toss a fair coin ten times then the exact probability that no pair of heads come up in succession (i.e. n = 10 and k = 2) is p(10,2) = 
 
 
 
  = 0.140625. The approximation gives 1.44721356...×1.23606797...−11 = 0.1406263...
