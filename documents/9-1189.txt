   Feller's coin-tossing constants      Feller's coin-tossing constants   Feller's coin-tossing constants are a set of numerical constants which describe asymptotic  probabilities that in n independent tosses of a fair coin , no run of k consecutive heads (or, equally, tails) appears.  William Feller showed 1 that if this probability is written as p ( n , k ) then        lim   n  →  ∞     p   (  n  ,  k  )    α  k   n  +  1      =    β  k          subscript    normal-→  n       p   n  k    superscript   subscript  α  k     n  1       subscript  β  k     \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p(n,k)\alpha_{k}^{n+1}=\beta_{k}\,     where α k is the smallest positive real root of       x   k  +  1    =    2   k  +  1     (   x  -  1   )         superscript  x    k  1       superscript  2    k  1      x  1      x^{k+1}=2^{k+1}(x-1)\,     and        β  k   =    2  -   α  k      k  +  1   -   k   α  k       .       subscript  β  k       2   subscript  α  k        k  1     k   subscript  α  k        \beta_{k}={2-\alpha_{k}\over k+1-k\alpha_{k}}.     Values of the constants      k       α  k     subscript  α  k    \alpha_{k}          β  k     subscript  β  k    \beta_{k}          1   2   2     2   1.23606797...   1.44721359...     3   1.08737802...   1.23683983...     4   1.03758012...   1.13268577...     For    k  =  2      k  2    k=2   the constants are related to the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers ; the constants are      5   -  1   =    2  φ   -  2   =   2  /  φ             5   1       2  φ   2          2  φ      \sqrt{5}-1=2\varphi-2=2/\varphi   and    1  -   1  /   5        1    1    5      1-1/\sqrt{5}   . For higher values of   k   k   k   they are related to generalizations of Fibonacci numbers such as the tribonacci and tetranacci constants.  Example  If we toss a fair coin ten times then the exact probability that no pair of heads come up in succession (i.e. n = 10 and k = 2) is p (10,2) =    9  64      9  64    \tfrac{9}{64}   = 0.140625. The approximation gives 1.44721356...×1.23606797... −11 = 0.1406263...
