   L(+)-tartrate dehydratase      L(+)-tartrate dehydratase   In enzymology , a L(+)-tartrate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R,R)-tartrate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (R,R)-tartrate , and two products , oxaloacetate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R,R)-tartrate hydro-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming) . Other names in common use include tartrate dehydratase , tartaric acid dehydrase , L-tartrate dehydratase , L-(+)-tartaric acid dehydratase , and (R,R)-tartrate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Thiol .
