   Sobolev inequality      Sobolev inequality   In mathematics , there is in mathematical analysis a class of Sobolev inequalities , relating norms including those of Sobolev spaces . These are used to prove the Sobolev embedding theorem , giving inclusions between certain Sobolev spaces , and the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem showing that under slightly stronger conditions some Sobolev spaces are compactly embedded in others. They are named after Sergei Lvovich Sobolev .  Sobolev embedding theorem  Let denote the Sobolev space consisting of all real-valued functions on whose first $k$  weak derivatives are functions in . Here $k$ is a non-negative integer and $1 ≤ p . The first part of the Sobolev embedding theorem states that if $k > ℓ$ and $1 ≤ p  are two real numbers such that $( k − ℓ ) p  and:  $$\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p}-\frac{k-\ell}{n},$$  then  $$W^{k,p}(\mathbf{R}^n)\subseteq W^{\ell,q}(\mathbf{R}^n)$$  and the embedding is continuous. In the special case of $k = 1$ and $ℓ = 0$ , Sobolev embedding gives  $$W^{1,p}(\mathbf{R}^n) \subseteq L^{p^*}(\mathbf{R}^n)$$  where is the Sobolev conjugate of $p$ , given by  $$\frac{1}{p^*} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{n}.$$  This special case of the Sobolev embedding is a direct consequence of the Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality .  The second part of the Sobolev embedding theorem applies to embeddings in Hölder spaces  . If $( k − r − α )/ n = 1/ p$ with $α ∈ (0, 1)$ , then one has the embedding  $$W^{k,p}(\mathbf{R}^n)\subset C^{r,\alpha}(\mathbf{R}^n).$$  This part of the Sobolev embedding is a direct consequence of Morrey's inequality . Intuitively, this inclusion expresses the fact that the existence of sufficiently many weak derivatives implies some continuity of the classical derivatives.  Generalizations  The Sobolev embedding theorem holds for Sobolev spaces on other suitable domains $M$ . In particular (; ), both parts of the Sobolev embedding hold when   $M$ is a bounded  open set in with Lipschitz boundary (or whose boundary satisfies the cone condition; )  $M$ is a compact  Riemannian manifold  $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with Lipschitz boundary  $M$ is a complete Riemannian manifold with injectivity radius  $δ > 0$ and bounded sectional curvature .   Kondrachov embedding theorem  On a compact manifold with boundary, the Kondrachov embedding theorem states that if $k > ℓ$ and $k − n / p > ℓ − n / q$ then the Sobolev embedding  $$W^{k,p}(M)\subset W^{\ell,q}(M)$$  is completely continuous (compact).  Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality  Assume that $u$ is a continuously differentiable real-valued function on with compact support . Then for $1 ≤ p  there is a constant $C$ depending only on $n$ and $p$ such that  $$\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbf{R}^n)}\leq C \|Du\|_{L^{p}(\mathbf{R}^n)}.$$  The Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality implies directly the Sobolev embedding  $$W^{1,p}(\mathbf{R}^n) \sub L^{p^*}(\mathbf{R}^n).$$  The embeddings in other orders on are then obtained by suitable iteration.  Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev lemma  Sobolev's original proof of the Sobolev embedding theorem relied on the following, sometimes known as the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev fractional integration theorem. An equivalent statement is known as the Sobolev lemma in . A proof is in .  Let $0  and $1 . Let (−Δ) − α /2 }} be the Riesz potential on . Then, for $q$ defined by  $$q = \frac{pn}{n-\alpha p}$$  there exists a constant $C$ depending only on $p$ such that  $$\left \|I_\alpha f \right \|_q \le C \|f\|_p.$$  If $p = 1$ , then the weak-type estimate holds:  $$m \left \{x : \left |I_\alpha f(x) \right | > \lambda \right \} \le C \left( \frac{\|f\|_1}{\lambda} \right )^q$$  where $1/ q = 1 − α / n$ .  The Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev lemma implies the Sobolev embedding essentially by the relationship between the Riesz transforms and the Riesz potentials.  Morrey's inequality  Assume $n . Then there exists a constant $C$ , depending only on $p$ and $n$ , such that  $$\|u\|_{C^{0,\gamma}(\mathbf{R}^n)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{1,p}(\mathbf{R}^n)}$$  for all , where  $$\gamma=1-\frac{n}{p}.$$  Thus if , then $u$ is in fact Hölder continuous of exponent $γ$ , after possibly being redefined on a set of measure 0.  A similar result holds in a bounded domain $U$ with boundary. In this case,  $$\|u\|_{C^{0,\gamma}(U)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{1,p}(U)}$$  where the constant $C$ depends now on $n , p$ and $U$ . This version of the inequality follows from the previous one by applying the norm-preserving extension of to .  General Sobolev inequalities  Let $U$ be a bounded open subset of , with a boundary. ( $U$ may also be unbounded, but in this case its boundary, if it exists, must be sufficiently well-behaved.) Assume , then we consider two cases:  $k  In this case , where  $$\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{p}-\frac{k}{n}.$$  We have in addition the estimate  $$\|u\|_{L^q(U)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{k,p}(U)}$$ ,  the constant $C$ depending only on $k , p , n$ , and $U$ .  $k > n / p$  Here, $u$ belongs to a Hölder space , more precisely:  $$u \in C^{k-\left[\frac{n}{p}\right]-1,\gamma}(U),$$  where  $$\gamma = \begin{cases}
 \left[\frac{n}{p}\right]+1-\frac{n}{p} & \frac{n}{p} \notin \mathbf{Z} \\
 \text{any element in } (0, 1) & \frac{n}{p} \in \mathbf{Z}
 \end{cases}$$  We have in addition the estimate  $$\|u\|_{C^{k-\left[\frac{n}{p}\right]-1,\gamma}(U)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{k,p}(U)},$$  the constant $C$ depending only on $k , p , n , γ$ , and $U$ .  Case $p=n, k=1$  If $u\in W^{1,n}(\mathbf{R}^n)$ , then $u$ is a function of bounded mean oscillation and  $$\|u\|_{BMO} \leq C \|Du\|_{L^n(\mathbf{R}^n)},$$  for some constant $C$ depending only on $n$ . This estimate is a corollary of the Poincaré inequality .  Nash inequality  The Nash inequality, introduced by , states that there exists a constant $C > 0$ , such that for all ,  $$\|u\|_{L^2(\mathbf{R}^n)}^{1+2/n} \leq C\|u\|_{L^1(\mathbf{R}^n)}^{2/n} \| Du\|_{L^2(\mathbf{R}^n)}.$$  The inequality follows from basic properties of the Fourier transform . Indeed, integrating over the complement of the ball of radius $ρ$ ,  by Parseval's theorem . On the other hand, one has  $$|\hat{u}| \le \|u\|_{L^1}$$  which, when integrated over the ball of radius $ρ$ gives  where is the volume of the $n$ -ball . Choosing $ρ$ to minimize the sum of () and () and again applying Parseval's theorem:  $$\|\hat{u}\|_{L^2} = \|u\|_{L^2}$$  gives the inequality.  In the special case of $n = 1$ , the Nash inequality can be extended to the case, in which case it is a generalization of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality . In fact, if $I$ is a bounded interval, then for all $1 ≤ r  and all $1 ≤ q ≤ p  the following inequality holds  $$\| u\|_{L^p(I)}\le C\| u\|^{1-a}_{L^q(I)} \|u\|^a_{W^{1,r}(I)},$$  where:  $$a\left(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{r}+1\right)=\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}.$$  References    .    .     , Translated from the Russian by T.
