Rabi cycle

In physics, the Rabi cycle (or Rabi flop) is the cyclic behaviour of a two-state quantum system in the presence of an oscillatory driving field. A great variety of physical processes belonging to the areas of quantum computing, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, and nuclear and particle physics can be conveniently studied in terms of two-level quantum mechanical systems, and exhibit Rabi flopping when coupled to an oscillatory driving field. The effect is important in quantum optics, magnetic resonance and quantum computing, and is named after Isidor Isaac Rabi.
A two-state system has two possible states, and if they are not degenerate (i.e. equal energy), the system can become "excited" when it absorbs a quantum of energy. When an atom (or some other two-level system) is illuminated by a coherent beam of photons, it will cyclically absorb photons and re-emit them by stimulated emission. One such cycle is called a Rabi cycle and the inverse of its duration the Rabi frequency of the photon beam. The effect can be modeled using the Jaynes-Cummings model and the Bloch vector formalism.
Mathematical treatment
A detailed mathematical description of the effect can be found on the page for the Rabi problem. For example, for a two-state atom (an atom in which an electron can either be in the excited or ground state) in an electromagnetic field with frequency tuned to the excitation energy, the probability of finding the atom in the excited state is found from the Bloch equations to be:


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the Rabi frequency.
More generally, one can consider a system where the two levels under consideration are not energy eigenstates. Therefore, if the system is initialized in one of these levels, time evolution will make the population of each of the levels oscillate with some characteristic frequency, whose angular frequency1 is also known as the Rabi frequency. The state of a two-state quantum system can be represented as vectors of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space, which means every state vector

 
  is represented by two complex coordinates.


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the coordinates.2
If the vectors are normalized, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are related by 
 
 
 
 . The basis vectors will be represented as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

All observable physical quantities associated with this systems are 2 
 
 
 
  2 Hermitian matrices, which means the Hamiltonian of the system is also a similar matrix.
How to prepare an oscillation experiment in a quantum system
One can construct an oscillation experiment consisting of following steps:3
(1) Prepare the system in a fixed state say 
 
 

(2) Let the state evolve freely, under a Hamiltonian H for time t
(3) Find the probability P(t), that the state is in
 
 

If 
 
 
 
 was an eigenstate of H, P(t)=1 and there are no oscillations. Also if two states are degenerate, every state including 
 
 
 
  is an eigenstate of H. As a result, there are no oscillations. So if H has no degenerate eigenstates, neither of which is 
 
 
 
 , then there will be oscillations. The most general form of the Hamiltonian of a two-state system is given



here, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are real numbers. This matrix can be decomposed as,


 
  The matrix 
 
 
 
  is the 2 
 
 
 
  2 identity matrix and the matrices 
 
 
 
  are the Pauli matrices. This decomposition simplifies the analysis of the system especially in the time-independent case where the values of 
 
 
 
 and 
 
 
 
 are constants. Consider the case of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field 
 
 
 
 . The interaction Hamiltonian for this system is


 
 .Where 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the magnitude of the particle's magnetic moment,
 
 
 
  is Gyromagnetic ratio and 
 
 
 
  is the vector of Pauli matrices. Here eigenstates of Hamiltonian are eigenstates of 
 
 
 
  that is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The probability that a system in the state 
 
 
 
  will be found to be in the arbitrary state 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 . Let system initially 
 
 
 
  is in state 
 
 
 
  that is eigen state of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . That is 
 
 
 
 . Here Hamiltonian is time independent. So by solving time independent Schr√∂dinger equation, we get state after time t is given by 
 
 
 
 , where E is the total energy of system. So the state after time t is given by 
 
 
 
 . Now suppose spin is measured in the x-direction at time t, the probability of finding spin-up is given by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a characteristic angular frequency given by
 
 
 
  where it has been assumed that 
 
 
 
 .4 So in this case probability of finding spin up state in X direction is oscillatory in time t when system is initially in Z direction. Similarly if we measure spin in Z direction then probability of finding 
 
 
 
  of the system is 
 
 
 
 .In the case 
 
 
 
 , that is when the Hamiltonian is degenerate there is no oscillation. So we can conclude that if the eigenstate of an above given Hamiltonian represents the state of a system, then probability of the system being that state is not oscillatory, but if we find probability of finding the system in other state, it is oscillatory. This is true for even time dependent Hamiltonian. For example 
 
 
 
 , the probability that a measurement of system in Y direction at time t results in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , where initial state is in

Example of Rabi Oscillation between two states in ionized hydrogen molecule.





Ionized hydrogen molecule is composed of two proton 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and one electron. The two protons because of their large masses can be considered to be fixed. Let us call R be the distance between them and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the states where the electron is localised around 
 
 
 
 or
 
 
 
 . Assume, at a certain time, the electron is localised about proton 
 
 
 
 . According to the results of previous section we know it will oscillate between the two protons with a frequency equal to the Bohr frequency associated with two stationary state 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of molecule. This oscillation of the electron between the two states corresponds to an oscillation of the mean value of the electric dipole moment of the molecule. Thus when the molecule is not in a stationary state, an oscillating electric dipole moment can appear. Such an oscillating dipolemoment can exchange energy with an electromagnetic wave of same frequency. Consequently, this frequency must appear in the absorption and emission spectrum of Ionized hydrogen molecule.





Derivation of Rabi Formula in a Nonperturbative Procedure by means of the Pauli matrices
Let us consider a Hamiltonian in the form 
 
 
 
 .
The eigen values of this matrix are given by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .Where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . so we can take 
 
 
 
 .
Now eigen vector for 
 
 
 
  can be found from equation 
 
 
 
 .
So 
 
 
 
 .
Using normalisation condition of eigen vector,


 
 .So 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . so 
 
 
 
 .
So we get 
 
 
 
 . That is 
 
 
 
 . Taking arbitrary phase angle 
 
 
 
 ,we can write 
 
 
 
 . Similarly 
 
 
 
 .
So eigen vector for
 
 
 
  eigen value is given by 
 
 
 
 .
As overall phase is immaterial so we can write 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly we can find eigen vector for 
 
 
 
  value and we get 
 
 
 
 .
From these two equations, we can write 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Let at time t=0, system be in 
 
 
 
  That Is 
 
 
 
 .
State of system after time t is given by 
 
 
 
 .
Now a system is in one of the eigen states 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , it will remain the same state, however in a general state as shown above the time evolution is non trivial.
The probability amplitude of finding the system at time t in the state 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .
Now the probability that a system in the state 
 
 
 
  will be found to be in the arbitrary state 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 

By simplifying 
 
 
 
 .........(1).
This shows that there is a finite probability of finding the system in state 
 
 
 
  when the system is originally in the state 
 
 
 
 . The probability is oscillatory with angular frequency 
 
 
 
 , which is simply unique Bohr frequency of the system and also called Rabi frequency. The formula(1) is known as Rabi formula. Now after time t the probability that the system in state 
 
 
 
  is given by
 
 
 
 , which is also oscillatory. This type of oscillations between two levels are called Rabi oscillation and seen in many problems such as Neutrino oscillation, ionized Hydrogen molecule, Quantum computing, Ammonia maser etc.
Rabi oscillation in Quantum computing
Any two state quantum system can be used to model a qubit. Consider a Spin

 
  system with magnetic moment 
 
 
 
  placed in a classical magnetic field 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the gyromagnetic ratio for the system. The magnetic moment is thus 
 
 
 
 . The Hamiltonian of this system is then given by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . One can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this Hamiltonian by the above-mentioned procedure. Now, let the qubit be in state 
 
 
 
  at time 
 
 
 
 . Then, at time 
 
 
 
 , the probability of it being found in state 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . This phenomenon is called Rabi oscillation. Thus, the qubit oscillates between the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  states. The maximum amplitude for oscillation is achieved at 
 
 
 
 , which is the condition for resonance. At resonance, the transition probability is given by 
 
 
 
 . To go from state 
 
 
 
  to state 
 
 
 
  it is sufficient to adjust the time 
 
 
 
  during which the rotating field acts such that 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . This is called a 
 
 
 
  pulse. If a time intermediate between 0 and 
 
 
 
  is chosen, we obtain a superposition of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . In particular for 
 
 
 
 , we have a 
 
 
 
  pulse, which acts as
 
 
 
 . This operation has crucial importance in quantum computing. The equations are essentially identical in the case of a two level atom in the field of a laser when the generally well satisfied rotating wave approximation is made. Then 
 
 
 
  is the energy difference between the two atomic levels, 
 
 
 
  is the frequency of laser wave and Rabi frequency

 
  is proportional to the product of the transition electric dipole moment of atom 
 
 
 
 and electric field 
 
 
 
  of the laser wave that is 
 
 
 
 . In summary, Rabi oscillations are the basic process used to manipulate qubits. These oscillations are obtained by exposing qubits to periodic electric or magnetic fields during suitably adjusted time intervals.6
