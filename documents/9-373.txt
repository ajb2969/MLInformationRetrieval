The purple-shaded region is the new Voronoi cell, after inserting the point to be interpolated (black dot). The weights represent the intersection areas of the purple-cell with each of the 7 surrounding cells.
Natural neighbor interpolation is a method of spatial interpolation, developed by Robin Sibson.1 The method is based on Voronoi tessellation of a discrete set of spatial points. This has advantages over simpler methods of interpolation, such as nearest-neighbor interpolation, in that it provides a smoother approximation to the underlying "true" function.
The basic equation in 2D is:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the estimate at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are the weights and 
 
 
 
  are the known data at 
 
 
 
 . The weights, 
 
 
 
 , are calculated by finding how much of each of the surrounding areas is "stolen" when inserting 
 
 
 
  into the tessellation.
