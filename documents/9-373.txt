The purple-shaded region is the new Voronoi cell, after inserting the point to be interpolated (black dot). The weights represent the intersection areas of the purple-cell with each of the 7 surrounding cells.  Natural neighbor interpolation is a method of spatial interpolation , developed by Robin Sibson . 1 The method is based on Voronoi tessellation of a discrete set of spatial points. This has advantages over simpler methods of interpolation, such as nearest-neighbor interpolation , in that it provides a smoother approximation to the underlying "true" function.  The basic equation in 2D is:       G   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     w  i   f   (   x  i   ,   y  i   )           G   x  y      subscript   superscript   n     i  1       subscript  w  i   f    subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i        G(x,y)=\sum^{n}_{i=1}{w_{i}f(x_{i},y_{i})}   where    G   (  x  ,  y  )       G   x  y     G(x,y)   is the estimate at    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   ,    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   are the weights and    f   (   x  i   ,   y  i   )       f    subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i      f(x_{i},y_{i})   are the known data at    (   x  i   ,   y  i   )      subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i     (x_{i},y_{i})   . The weights,    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   , are calculated by finding how much of each of the surrounding areas is "stolen" when inserting    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   into the tessellation.
