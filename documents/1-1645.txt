   Surreal number      Surreal number   In mathematics , the surreal number system is an arithmetic continuum containing the real numbers as well as infinite and infinitesimal numbers , respectively larger or smaller in absolute value than any positive real number. The surreals share many properties with the reals, including a total order ≤ and the usual arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); as such, they form an ordered field . (Strictly speaking, the surreals are not a set , but a proper class . 1 ) If formulated in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory , the surreal numbers are the largest possible ordered field; all other ordered fields, such as the rationals, the reals, the rational functions , the Levi-Civita field , the superreal numbers , and the hyperreal numbers , can be realized as subfields of the surreals. 2 It has also been shown (in Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory ) that the maximal class hyperreal field is isomorphic to the maximal class surreal field; in theories without the axiom of global choice , this need not be the case, and in such theories it is not necessarily true that the surreals are the largest ordered field. The surreals also contain all transfinite  ordinal numbers ; the arithmetic on them is given by the natural operations .  In 1907 Hahn introduced Hahn series as a generalization of formal power series, and Hausdorff introduced certain ordered sets called η α -sets for ordinals α and asked if it was possible to find a compatible ordered group or field structure. In 1962 Alling used a modified form of Hahn series to construct such ordered fields associated to certain ordinals α, and taking α to be the class of all ordinals in his construction gives a class that is an ordered field isomorphic to the surreal numbers. 3 Research on the go  endgame by John Horton Conway led to a simpler definition and construction of the surreal numbers. 4 Conway's construction was introduced in Donald Knuth 's 1974 book Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness . In his book, which takes the form of a dialogue, Knuth coined the term surreal numbers for what Conway had called simply numbers . Conway later adopted Knuth's term, and used surreals for analyzing games in his 1976 book On Numbers and Games .  Overview  The surreal numbers are constructed in stages, along with an ordering ≤ such that for any two surreal numbers a and b either a ≤ b or b ≤ a . (Both may hold, in which case a and b are equivalent and denote the same number.) Numbers are formed by pairing subsets of numbers already constructed: given subsets L and R of numbers such that all the members of L are strictly less than all the members of R , then the pair { L | R } represents a number intermediate in value between all the members of L and all the members of R .  Different subsets may end up defining the same number: { L | R } and { L′ | R′ } may define the same number even if L ≠ L′ and R ≠ R′ . (A similar phenomenon occurs when rational numbers are defined as quotients of integers: 1/2 and 2/4 are different representations of the same rational number.) So strictly speaking, the surreal numbers are equivalence classes of representations of form { L | R } that designate the same number.  In the first stage of construction, there are no previously existing numbers so the only representation must use the empty set: { | }. This representation, where L and R are both empty, is called 0. Subsequent stages yield forms like:    { 0 | } = 1      { 1 | } = 2      { 2 | } = 3    and    { | 0 } = −1      { | −1 } = −2      { | −2 } = −3    The integers are thus contained within the surreal numbers. Similarly, representations arise like:    { 0 | 1 } = 1/2      { 0 | 1/2 } = 1/4      { 1/2 | 1 } = 3/4    so that the dyadic rationals (rational numbers whose denominators are powers of 2) are contained within the surreal numbers.  After an infinite number of stages, infinite subsets become available, so that any real number  a can be represented by { L a | R a }, where L a is the set of all dyadic rationals less than a and R a is the set of all dyadic rationals greater than a (reminiscent of a Dedekind cut ). Thus the real numbers are also embedded within the surreals.  But there are also representations like    { 0, 1, 2, 3, … | } = ω      { 0 | 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, … } = ε    where ω is a transfinite number greater than all integers and ε is an infinitesimal greater than 0 but less than any positive real number. Moreover, the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) can be extended to these non-real numbers in a manner that turns the collection of surreal numbers into an ordered field, so that one can talk about 2ω or ω − 1 and so forth.  Construction  Surreal numbers are constructed inductively as equivalence classes of pairs of sets of surreal numbers, restricted by the condition that each element of the first set is smaller than each element of the second set. The construction consists of three interdependent parts: the construction rule, the comparison rule and the equivalence rule.  Forms  A form is a pair of sets of surreal numbers, called its left set and its right set . A form with left set L and right set R is written { L | R }. When L and R are given as lists of elements, the braces around them are omitted.  Either or both of the left and right set of a form may be the empty set. The form { { } | { } } with both left and right set empty is also written { | }.  Numeric forms  Construction Rule   A form { L | R } is numeric if the intersection of L and R is the empty set and each element of R is greater than every element of L , according to the order relation ≤ given by the comparison rule below.   Equivalence classes of numeric forms  The numeric forms are placed in equivalence classes; each such equivalence class is a surreal number . The elements of the left and right set of a form are drawn from the universe of the surreal numbers (not of forms , but of their equivalence classes ).  Equivalence Rule   Two numeric forms x and y are forms of the same number (lie in the same equivalence class) if and only if both x ≤ y and y ≤ x .   An ordering relationship must be antisymmetric , i.e., it must have the property that x = y (i. e., x ≤ y and y ≤ x are both true) only when x and y are the same object. This is not the case for surreal number forms , but is true by construction for surreal numbers (equivalence classes).  The equivalence class containing { | } is labeled 0; in other words, { | } is a form of the surreal number 0.  Order  The recursive definition of surreal numbers is completed by defining comparison:  Given numeric forms x = { X L | X R } and y = { Y L | Y R }, x ≤ y if and only if:   there is no     x  L   ∈   X  L        subscript  x  L    subscript  X  L     x_{L}\in X_{L}   such that y ≤    x  L     subscript  x  L    x_{L}   (every element in the left part of x is smaller than y ), and  there is no     y  R   ∈   Y  R        subscript  y  R    subscript  Y  R     y_{R}\in Y_{R}   such that    y  R     subscript  y  R    y_{R}   ≤ x (every element in the right part of y is bigger than x ).   A comparison y ≤ c between a form y and a surreal number c is performed by choosing a form z from the equivalence class c and evaluating y ≤ z ; and likewise for c ≤ x and for comparison b ≤ c between two surreal numbers.  Induction  This group of definitions is recursive , and requires some form of mathematical induction to define the universe of objects (forms and numbers) that occur in them. The only surreal numbers reachable via finite induction are the dyadic fractions ; a wider universe is reachable given some form of transfinite induction .  Induction Rule   There is a generation S 0 = { 0 }, in which 0 consists of the single form { | }.  Given any ordinal number  n , the generation S n is the set of all surreal numbers that are generated by the construction rule from subsets of     ∪   i  <  n     S  i       subscript     i  n     subscript  S  i     \cup_{i   .   The base case is actually a special case of the induction rule, with 0 taken as a label for the "least ordinal". Since there exists no S i with i \cup_{i  is the empty set; the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, and therefore S 0 consists of a single surreal form { | } lying in a single equivalence class 0.  For every finite ordinal number n , S n is well-ordered by the ordering induced by the comparison rule on the surreal numbers.  The first iteration of the induction rule produces the three numeric forms { | 0 } i is also a valid form in S n , all of the numbers in S i also appear in S n (as supersets of their representation in S i ). (The set union expression appears in our construction rule, rather than the simpler form S n-1 , so that the definition also makes sense when n is a limit ordinal .) Numbers in S n that are a superset of some number in S i are said to have been inherited from generation i . The smallest value of α for which a given surreal number appears in S α is called its birthday . For example, the birthday of 0 is 0, and the birthday of −1 is 1.  A second iteration of the construction rule yields the following ordering of equivalence classes:   { | −1 } = { | −1, 0 } = { | −1, 1 } = { | −1, 0, 1 }  < { | 0 } = { | 0, 1 }  < { −1 | 0 } = { −1 | 0, 1 }  < { | } = { −1 | } = { | 1 } = { −1 | 1 }  < { 0 | 1 } = { −1, 0 | 1 }  < { 0 | } = { −1, 0 | }  < { 1 | } = { 0, 1 | } = { −1, 1 | } = { −1, 0, 1 | }   Comparison of these equivalence classes is consistent irrespective of the choice of form. Three observations follow:   S 2 contains four new surreal numbers. Two contain extremal forms: { | −1, 0, 1 } contains all numbers from previous generations in its right set, and { −1, 0, 1 | } contains all numbers from previous generations in its left set. The others have a form that partitions all numbers from previous generations into two non-empty sets.  Every surreal number x that existed in the previous "generation" exists also in this generation, and includes at least one new form: a partition of all numbers other than  x from previous generations into a left set (all numbers less than x ) and a right set (all numbers greater than x ).  The equivalence class of a number depends only on the maximal element of its left set and the minimal element of the right set.   The informal interpretations of { 1 | } and { | −1 } are "the number just after 1" and "the number just before −1" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 2 and −2. The informal interpretations of { 0 | 1 } and { −1 | 0 } are "the number halfway between 0 and 1" and "the number halfway between −1 and 0" respectively; their equivalence classes are labeled 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2 . These labels will also be justified by the rules for surreal addition and multiplication below.  The equivalence classes at each stage n of induction may be characterized by their n - complete forms (each containing as many elements as possible of previous generations in its left and right sets). Either this complete form contains every number from previous generations in its left or right set, in which case this is the first generation in which this number occurs; or it contains all numbers from previous generations but one, in which case it is a new form of this one number. We retain the labels from the previous generation for these "old" numbers, and write the ordering above using the old and new labels:   −2 1/ 2 1/ 2 < 1 < 2.   The third observation extends to all surreal numbers with finite left and right sets. (For infinite left or right sets, this is valid in an altered form, since infinite sets might not contain a maximal or minimal element.) The number { 1, 2 | 5, 8 } is therefore equivalent to { 2 | 5 }; one can establish that these are forms of 3 by using the birthday property , which is a consequence of the rules above.  Birthday property   A form x = { L | R } occurring in generation n represents a number inherited from an earlier generation i i'' that is greater than all elements of L and less than all elements of the R . (In other words, if L and R are already separated by a number created at an earlier stage, then x does not represent a new number but one already constructed.) If x represents a number from any generation earlier than n , there is a least such generation i , and exactly one number c with this least i as its birthday lies between L and R . x is a form of this c , i. e., it lies in the equivalence class in S n that is a superset of the representation of c in generation i .   Arithmetic  The addition, negation (additive inverse), and multiplication of surreal number forms  x = { X L | X R } and y = { Y L | Y R } are defined by three recursive formulas.  Negation  Negation of a given number x = { X L | X R } is defined by       -  x   =   -   {   X  L   |   X  R   }    =   {   -   X  R    |   -   X  L    }           x      conditional-set   subscript  X  L    subscript  X  R           conditional-set     subscript  X  R       subscript  X  L        -x=-\{X_{L}|X_{R}\}=\{-X_{R}|-X_{L}\}   , where the negation of a set S of numbers is given by the set of the negated elements of S :       -  S   =   {   -  s   :   s  ∈  S   }         S    conditional-set    s     s  S      -S=\{-s:s\in S\}   .  This formula involves the negation of the surreal numbers appearing in the left and right sets of x , which is to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the number, evaluating the negation of this form, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This only makes sense if the result is the same irrespective of the choice of form of the operand. This can be proven inductively using the fact that the numbers occurring in X L and X R are drawn from generations earlier than that in which the form x first occurs, and observing the special case:   -0 = - { | } = { | } = 0.   Addition  The definition of addition is also a recursive formula:       x  +  y   =    {   X  L   |   X  R   }   +   {   Y  L   |   Y  R   }    =   {     X  L   +  y   ,   x  +   Y  L     |     X  R   +  y   ,   x  +   Y  R     }           x  y      conditional-set   subscript  X  L    subscript  X  R     conditional-set   subscript  Y  L    subscript  Y  R           conditional-set      subscript  X  L   y     x   subscript  Y  L         subscript  X  R   y     x   subscript  Y  R         x+y=\{X_{L}|X_{R}\}+\{Y_{L}|Y_{R}\}=\{X_{L}+y,x+Y_{L}|X_{R}+y,x+Y_{R}\}   , where        X  +  y   =   {   x  +  y   :   x  ∈  X   }    ,    x  +  Y   =   {   x  +  y   :   y  ∈  Y   }       formulae-sequence      X  y    conditional-set    x  y     x  X         x  Y    conditional-set    x  y     y  Y       X+y=\{x+y:x\in X\},x+Y=\{x+y:y\in Y\}   .  This formula involves sums of one of the original operands and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other. These are to be understood as the result of choosing a form of the numeric operand, performing the sum of the two forms, and taking the equivalence class of the resulting form. This only makes sense if the result is the same irrespective of the choice of form of the numeric operand. This can also be proven inductively with the special cases:   0 + 0 = { | } + { | } = { | } = 0  x + 0 = x + { | } = { X L + 0 | X R + 0 } = { X L | X R } = x   0 + y = { | } + y = { 0 + Y L | 0 + Y R } = { Y L | Y R } = y    (The latter two cases are themselves proven inductively.)  Multiplication  The recursive formula for multiplication contains arithmetic expressions involving the operands and their left and right sets, such as the expression       X  R   y   +   x   Y  R     -    X  R    Y  R             subscript  X  R   y     x   subscript  Y  R        subscript  X  R    subscript  Y  R      X_{R}y+xY_{R}-X_{R}Y_{R}   that appears in the left set of the product of x and y . This is to be understood as the set of surreal numbers resulting from choosing one number from each set that appears in the expression and evaluating the expression on these numbers. (In each individual evaluation of the expression, only one number is chosen from each set, and is substituted in each place where that set appears in the expression.)  This depends, in turn, on the ability to (a) multiply pairs of surreal numbers drawn from the left and right sets of x and y to get a surreal number, and negate the result; (b) multiply the surreal number form  x or y and a surreal number drawn from the left or right set of the other operand to get a surreal number; and (c) add the resulting surreal numbers. This again involves special cases, this time containing 0 = { | }, the multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }, and its additive inverse -1 = { | 0 }.      x  y      x  y    \displaystyle xy     Consistency  It can be shown that the definitions of negation, addition and multiplication are consistent, in the sense that:   addition and negation are defined recursively in terms of "simpler" addition and negation steps, so that operations on numbers with birthday n will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of operations on numbers with birthdays less than n ;  multiplication is defined recursively in terms of additions, negations, and "simpler" multiplication steps, so that the product of numbers with birthday n will eventually be expressed entirely in terms of sums and differences of products of numbers with birthdays less than n ;  as long as the operands are well-defined surreal number forms (each element of the left set is less than each element of the right set), the results are again well-defined surreal number forms;  the operations can be extended to numbers (equivalence classes of forms): the result of negating x or adding or multiplying x and y will represent the same number regardless of the choice of form of x and y ; and  these operations obey the associativity, commutativity, additive inverse, and distributivity axioms in the definition of a field , with additive identity 0 = { | } and multiplicative identity 1 = { 0 | }.   With these rules one can now verify that the numbers found in the first few generations were properly labeled. The construction rule is repeated to obtain more generations of surreals:   S 0 = { 0 }  S 1 = { −1 < 0 < 1 }  S 2 = { −2 1/ 2 1/ 2 < 1 < 2}  S 3 = { −3 3/ 2 3/ 4 1/ 2 1/ 4 1/ 4 1/ 2 3/ 4 3/ 2 < 2 < 3 }  S 4 = { -4 1/ 8 1/ 8 1/ 4 3/ 8 1/ 2 5/ 8 3/ 4 7/ 8 5/ 4 3/ 2 7/ 4 5/ 2 < 3 < 4 }   Arithmetic closure  For each natural number (finite ordinal) n , all numbers generated in S n are dyadic fractions , i.e., can be written as an irreducible fraction     a   2  b       a   superscript  2  b     \frac{a}{2^{b}}   where a and b are integers and 0 ≤ b n'' for finite n may be denoted as S * =     ∪   n  ∈  N     S  n       subscript     n  N     subscript  S  n     \cup_{n\in N}S_{n}   . One may form the three classes S 0 = { 0 }, S + =     x  ∈   S  *    :   x  >  0      normal-:    x   subscript  S       x  0     {x\in S_{*}:x>0}   , and S - =     x  ∈   S  *    :   x  <  0      normal-:    x   subscript  S       x  0     {x\in S_{*}:x<0}   , and state that S * is the union of these three classes. No individual S n is closed under addition and multiplication (except S 0 ), but S * is; it is the subring of the rationals consisting of all dyadic fractions.  At an appropriate stage of transfinite induction, the surreal numbers may be expected to form a category on which the addition and multiplication operations (as well as the surreal construction step) are closed, and in which the multiplicative inverse of every nonzero number can be found. Assuming that one can find such a class, the surreal numbers, with their ordering and these algebraic operations, constitute an ordered field , with the caveat that they do not form a set but a proper class . In fact, it is a very special ordered field: the biggest one. Every other ordered field can be embedded in the surreals. (See also the definition of rational numbers and real numbers .) The class of all surreal numbers is denoted by the symbol   𝐍𝐨   𝐍𝐨   \mathbf{No}   .  Infinity  Let there be an ordinal ω greater than the natural numbers, and define S ω as the set of all surreal numbers generated by the construction rule from subsets of S * . (This is the same inductive step as before, since the ordinal number ω is the smallest ordinal that is larger than all natural numbers; however, the set union appearing in the inductive step is now an infinite union of finite sets, and so this step can only be performed in a set theory that allows such a union.) A unique infinitely large positive number occurs in S ω :      ω  =   {   S  *   |  }   =   {  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  …  |  }   .     fragments  ω    fragments  normal-{   subscript  S    normal-|  normal-}     fragments  normal-{  1  normal-,  2  normal-,  3  normal-,  4  normal-,  normal-…  normal-|  normal-}   normal-.    \omega=\{S_{*}|\}=\{1,2,3,4,...|\}.    S ω also contains objects that can be identified as the rational numbers . For example, the ω-complete form of the fraction 1 / 3 is given by:        1  3    =   {   y  ∈   S  *    :   3  y   <  1  |    y  ∈   S  *    :   3  y    >   1   }         1  3    conditional-set    y   subscript  S       3  y   inner-product  1   normal-:    y   subscript  S       3  y     1      \tfrac{1}{3}=\{y\in S_{*}:3y<1|y\in S_{*}:3y>1\}   . The product of this form of 1 / 3 with any form of 3 is a form whose left set contains only numbers less than 1 and whose right set contains only numbers greater than 1; the birthday property implies that this product is a form of 1.  Not only do all the rest of the rational numbers appear in S ω ; the remaining finite real numbers do too. For example      π  =   {   3  ,   25  8   ,   201  64   ,  …   |   4  ,   7  2   ,   13  4   ,   51  16   ,  …   }       π   conditional-set   3    25  8     201  64   normal-…    4    7  2     13  4     51  16   normal-…      \pi=\{3,\frac{25}{8},\frac{201}{64},...|4,\frac{7}{2},\frac{13}{4},\frac{51}{1%
 6},...\}   .  The only infinities in S ω are ω and -ω; but there are other non-real numbers in S ω among the reals. Consider the smallest positive number in S ω :      ϵ  =   {    S  -   ∪   S  0    |   S  +   }   =   {  0  |   1  ,    1  2    ,    1  4    ,    1  8    ,  …   }   =   {   0   |    y  ∈   S  *    :  y   >   0   }         ϵ   conditional-set     subscript  S     subscript  S  0     subscript  S           conditional-set  0   1    1  2     1  4     1  8   normal-…            0   ket   normal-:    y   subscript  S     y    0       \epsilon=\{S_{-}\cup S_{0}|S_{+}\}=\{0|1,\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{4},\tfrac{1}{8%
 },...\}=\{0|y\in S_{*}:y>0\}   . This number is larger than zero but less than all positive dyadic fractions. It is therefore an infinitesimal number, often labeled ε. The ω-complete form of ε (resp. -ε) is the same as the ω-complete form of 0, except that 0 is included in the left (resp. right) set. The only "pure" infinitesimals in S ω are ε and its additive inverse -ε; adding them to any dyadic fraction y produces the numbers y ±ε, which also lie in S ω .  One can determine the relationship between ω and ε by multiplying particular forms of them to obtain:   ω · ε = { ε · S + | ω · S + + S * + ε · S * }.   This expression is only well-defined in a set theory which permits transfinite induction up to    S   ω  2      subscript  S   superscript  ω  2     S_{\omega^{2}}   . In such a system, one can demonstrate that all the elements of the left set of ω · ε are positive infinitesimals and all the elements of the right set are positive infinities, and therefore ω · ε is the oldest positive finite number, i. e., 1. Consequently,   1 / ε = ω.   Some authors systematically use ω −1 in place of the symbol ε.  Contents of S ω  Given any x = { L | R } in S ω , exactly one of the following is true:   L and R are both empty, in which case x = 0;  R is empty and some integer n ≥0 is greater than every element of L , in which case x equals the smallest such integer n ;  R is empty and no integer n is greater than every element of L , in which case x equals +ω;  L is empty and some integer n ≤0 is less than every element of R , in which case x equals the largest such integer n ;  L is empty and no integer n is less than every element of R , in which case x equals -ω;  L and R are both non-empty, and:  some dyadic fraction y is "strictly between" L and R (greater than all elements of L and less than all elements of R ), in which case x equals the oldest such dyadic fraction y ;  no dyadic fraction y lies strictly between L and R , but some dyadic fraction    y  ∈  L      y  L    y\in L   is greater than or equal to all elements of L and less than all elements of R , in which case x equals y +ε;  no dyadic fraction y lies strictly between L and R , but some dyadic fraction    y  ∈  R      y  R    y\in R   is greater than all elements of L and less than or equal to all elements of R , in which case x equals y -ε;  every dyadic fraction is either greater than some element of R or less than some element of L , in which case x is some real number that has no representation as a dyadic fraction.    S ω is not an algebraic field, because it is not closed under arithmetic operations; consider ω+1, whose form     {  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  …  |  }   +   {  0  |  }   =   {  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  …  ,  ω  |  }      fragments   fragments  normal-{  1  normal-,  2  normal-,  3  normal-,  4  normal-,  normal-…  normal-|  normal-}     fragments  normal-{  0  normal-|  normal-}     fragments  normal-{  1  normal-,  2  normal-,  3  normal-,  4  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  ω  normal-|  normal-}     \{1,2,3,4,...|\}+\{0|\}=\{1,2,3,4,...,\omega|\}   does not lie in any number in S ω . The maximal subset of S ω that is closed under (finite series of) arithmetic operations is the field of real numbers, obtained by leaving out the infinities ±ω, the infinitesimals ±ε, and the infinitesimal neighbors y ±ε of each nonzero dyadic fraction y .  This construction of the real numbers differs from the Dedekind cuts of standard analysis in that it starts from dyadic fractions rather than general rationals and naturally identifies each dyadic fraction in S ω with its forms in previous generations. (The ω-complete forms of real elements of S ω are in one-to-one correspondence with the reals obtained by Dedekind cuts, under the proviso that Dedekind reals corresponding to rational numbers are represented by the form in which the cut point is omitted from both left and right sets.) The rationals are not an identifiable stage in the surreal construction; they are merely the subset Q of S ω containing all elements x such that x  b = a for some a and some nonzero b , both drawn from S * . By demonstrating that Q is closed under individual repetitions of the surreal arithmetic operations, one can show that it is a field; and by showing that every element of Q is reachable from S * by a finite series (no longer than two, actually) of arithmetic operations including multiplicative inversion , one can show that Q is strictly smaller than the subset of S ω identified with the reals.  Transfinite induction  Continuing to perform transfinite induction beyond S ω produces more ordinal numbers α, each represented as the largest surreal number having birthday α. (This is essentially a definition of the ordinal numbers resulting from transfinite induction.) The first such ordinal is ω+1 = { ω | }. There is another positive infinite number in generation ω+1:   ω−1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | ω }.   It is important to observe that the surreal number ω−1 is not an ordinal; the ordinal ω is not the successor of any ordinal. This is a surreal number with birthday ω+1, which is labeled ω−1 on the basis that it coincides with the sum of ω = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and −1 = { | 0 }. Similarly, there are two new infinitesimal numbers in generation ω+1:   2ε = ε + ε = { ε | 1+ε, 1 / 2 +ε, 1 / 4 +ε, 1 / 8 +ε, ... } and  ε/2 = ε · 1 / 2 = { 0 | ε }.   At a later stage of transfinite induction, there is a number larger than ω+ k for all natural numbers k :   2ω = ω + ω = { ω+1, ω+2, ω+3, ω+4, ... | }   This number may be labeled ω + ω both because its birthday is ω + ω (the first ordinal number not reachable from ω by the successor operation) and because it coincides with the surreal sum of ω and ω; it may also be labeled 2ω because it coincides with the product of ω = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... | } and 2 = { 1 | }. It is the second limit ordinal; reaching it from ω via the construction step requires a transfinite induction on     ⋃   k  <  ω     S   ω  +  k        subscript     k  ω     subscript  S    ω  k      \bigcup_{k<\omega}S_{\omega+k}   . This involves an infinite union of infinite sets, which is a "stronger" set theoretic operation than the previous transfinite induction required.  Note that the conventional addition and multiplication of ordinals does not always coincide with these operations on their surreal representations. The sum of ordinals 1 + ω equals ω, but the surreal sum is commutative and produces 1 + ω = ω + 1 > ω. The addition and multiplication of the surreal numbers associated with ordinals coincides with the natural sum and natural product of ordinals.  Just as 2ω is bigger than ω + n for any natural number n , there is a surreal number ω/2 that is infinite but smaller than ω − n for any natural number n . That is, ω/2 is defined by   ω/2 = { S * | ω − S * }   where on the right hand side the notation x − Y is used to mean { x − y : y in Y }. It can be identified as the product of ω and the form { 0 | 1 } of 1 / 2 . The birthday of ω / 2 is the limit ordinal ω2.  Powers of ω  To classify the "orders" of infinite and infinitesimal surreal numbers, also known as archimedean classes, Conway associated to each surreal number x the surreal number   ω x = { 0, r ω x L | s ω x R },   where r and s range over the positive real numbers. If x  y is "infinitely greater" than ω x , in that it is greater than r ω x for all real numbers r . Powers of ω also satisfy the conditions   ω x ω y = ω x+y ,  ω − x = 1/ω x ,   so they behave the way one would expect powers to behave.  Each power of ω also has the redeeming feature of being the simplest surreal number in its archimedean class; conversely, every archimedean class within the surreal numbers contains a unique simplest member. Thus, for every positive surreal number x there will always exist some positive real number r and some surreal number y so that x − r ω y is "infinitely smaller" than x . The exponent y is the "base ω logarithm" of x , defined on the positive surreals; it can be demonstrated that log ω maps the positive surreals onto the surreals and that log ω ( xy ) = log ω ( x ) + log ω ( y ).  This gets extended by transfinite induction so that every surreal number x has a "normal form" analogous to the Cantor normal form for ordinal numbers. Every surreal number may be uniquely written as   x = r 0 ω y 0 + r 1 ω y 1 + …,   where every r α is a nonzero real number and the y α s form a strictly decreasing sequence of surreal numbers. This "sum", however, may have infinitely many terms, and in general has the length of an arbitrary ordinal number. (Zero corresponds of course to the case of an empty sequence, and is the only surreal number with no leading exponent.)  Looked at in this manner, the surreal numbers resemble a power series field , except that the decreasing sequences of exponents must be bounded in length by an ordinal and are not allowed to be as long as the class of ordinals.  Surcomplex numbers  A surcomplex number is a number of the form    a  +   b  i       a    b  i     a+bi   , where a and b are surreal numbers. 5 6 The surcomplex numbers form an algebraically closed  field (except for being a proper class), isomorphic to the algebraic closure of the field generated by extending the rational numbers by a proper class of algebraically independent  transcendental elements. Up to field isomorphism , this fact characterizes the field of surcomplex numbers within any fixed set theory. 7  Games  The definition of surreal numbers contained one restriction: each element of L must be strictly less than each element of R. If this restriction is dropped we can generate a more general class known as games . All games are constructed according to this rule:   Construction Rule If L and R are two sets of games then { L | R } is a game.   Addition, negation, and comparison are all defined the same way for both surreal numbers and games.  Every surreal number is a game, but not all games are surreal numbers, e.g. the game { 0 | 0 } is not a surreal number. The class of games is more general than the surreals, and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer properties of surreal numbers. The class of surreal numbers forms a field , but the class of games does not. The surreals have a total order : given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one is greater than the other. The games have only a partial order : there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less than each other. Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero. Each game is either positive, negative, zero , or fuzzy (incomparable with zero, such as {1|−1}).  A move in a game involves the player whose move it is choosing a game from those available in L (for the left player) or R (for the right player) and then passing this chosen game to the other player. A player who cannot move because the choice is from the empty set has lost. A positive game represents a win for the left player, a negative game for the right player, a zero game for the second player to move, and a fuzzy game for the first player to move.  If x , y , and z are surreals, and x = y , then x  z = y  z . However, if x , y , and z are games, and x = y , then it is not always true that x  z = y  z . Note that "=" here means equality, not identity.  Application to combinatorial game theory  The surreal numbers were originally motivated by studies of the game Go , 8 and there are numerous connections between popular games and the surreals. In this section, we will use a capitalized Game for the mathematical object {L|R}, and the lowercase game for recreational games like Chess or Go .  We consider games with these properties:   Two players (named Left and Right )  Deterministic (the game at each step will completely depend on the choices the players make, rather than a random factor)  No hidden information (such as cards or tiles that a player hides)  Players alternate taking turns (the game may or may not allow multiple moves in a turn)  Every game must end in a finite number of moves  As soon as there are no legal moves left for a player, the game ends, and that player loses   For most games, the initial board position gives no great advantage to either player. As the game progresses and one player starts to win, board positions will occur where that player has a clear advantage. For analyzing games, it is useful to associate a Game with every board position. The value of a given position will be the Game {L|R}, where L is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Left. Similarly, R is the set of values of all the positions that can be reached in a single move by Right.  The zero Game (called 0) is the Game where L and R are both empty, so the player to move next (L or R) immediately loses. The sum of two Games G = { L1 | R1 } and H = { L2 | R2 } is defined as the Game G + H = { L1 + H, G + L2 | R1 + H, G + R2 } where the player to move chooses which of the Games to play in at each stage, and the loser is still the player who ends up with no legal move. One can imagine two chess boards between two players, with players making moves alternatively, but with complete freedom as to which board to play on. If G is the Game {L | R}, -G is the game {-R | -L}, i.e. with the role of the two players reversed. It is easy to show G - G = 0 for all Games G (where G - H is defined as G + (-H)).  This simple way to associate Games with games yields a very interesting result. Suppose two perfect players play a game starting with a given position whose associated Game is x . We can classify all Games into four classes as follows:   If x > 0 then Left will win, regardless of who plays first.  If x < 0 then Right will win, regardless of who plays first.  If x = 0 then the player who goes second will win.  If x || 0 then the player who goes first will win.   More generally, we can define G > H as G - H > 0, and similarly for  H, G y if and only if y  y , holds (law of trichotomy ). This means that α : α α : α  explicit construction is bypassed altogether. Instead, a set of axioms is given that any particular approach to the surreals must satisfy. Much like the axiomatic approach to the reals, these axioms guarantee uniqueness up to isomorphism.  A triple    ⟨  𝐍𝐨  ,  <  ,  b  ⟩     𝐍𝐨   b    \langle\mathbf{No},\mathrm{<},b\rangle   is a surreal number system if and only if the following hold:   < is a total order over No  b is a function from No onto the class of all ordinals ( b is called the "birthday function" on No ).  Let A and B be subclasses of No such that for all x ∈ A and y ∈ B , x < y (using Alling's terminology, 〈 A , B 〉 is a "Conway cut" of No ). Then there exists a unique z ∈ No such that b(z) is minimal and for all x ∈ A and all y ∈ B , x < z < y . (This axiom is often referred to as "Conway's Simplicity Theorem".)  Furthermore, if an ordinal α is greater than b(x) for all x ∈ A , B , then b(z) ≤ α . (Alling calls a system that satisfies this axiom a "full surreal number system".)   Both Conway's original construction and the sign-expansion construction of surreals satisfy these axioms.  Given these axioms, Alling 9 derives Conway's original definition of ≤ and develops surreal arithmetic.  Hahn series  Alling 10 also proves that the field of surreal numbers is isomorphic (as an ordered field) to the field of Hahn series with real coefficients on the value group of surreal numbers themselves (the series representation corresponding to the normal form of a surreal number, as defined above). This provides a connection between surreal numbers and more conventional mathematical approaches to ordered field theory.  Relation to hyperreals  Philip Ehrlich has constructed an isomorphism between Conway's maximal surreal number field and the maximal hyperreals in von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory . 11  See also   Hyperreal number  Non-standard analysis   References  Further reading   Donald Knuth 's original exposition: Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned on to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness , 1974, ISBN 0-201-03812-9.
