   Classical modal logic      Classical modal logic   In modal logic , a classical modal logic  L is any modal logic containing (as axiom or theorem) the duality of the modal operators       ◇  A   ≡   ¬  □  ¬  A         normal-◇  A      normal-□   A     \Diamond A\equiv\lnot\Box\lnot A     which is also closed under the rule        A  ≡  B   ⊢    □  A   ≡   □  B     .     proves    A  B       normal-□  A     normal-□  B      A\equiv B\vdash\Box A\equiv\Box B.     Alternatively one can give a dual definition of L by which L is classical iff it contains (as axiom or theorem)       □  A   ≡   ¬  ◇  ¬  A         normal-□  A      normal-◇   A     \Box A\equiv\lnot\Diamond\lnot A     and is closed under the rule        A  ≡  B   ⊢    ◇  A   ≡   ◇  B     .     proves    A  B       normal-◇  A     normal-◇  B      A\equiv B\vdash\Diamond A\equiv\Diamond B.     The weakest classical system is sometimes referred to as E and is non-normal . Both algebraic and neighborhood semantics characterize familiar classical modal systems that are weaker than the weakest normal modal logic K .  Every regular modal logic is classical, and every normal modal logic is regular and hence classical.  References  Chellas, Brian. Modal Logic: An Introduction . Cambridge University Press, 1980.
