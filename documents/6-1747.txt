   Atom (measure theory)      Atom (measure theory)   In mathematics , more precisely in measure theory , an atom is a measurable set which has positive measure and contains no set of smaller but positive measure. A measure which has no atoms is called non-atomic or atomless .  Definition  Given a measurable space     (  X  ,  Σ  )     X  normal-Σ    (X,\Sigma)   and a measure    μ   μ   \mu   on that space, a set    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   in   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is called an atom if       μ   (  A  )    >  0        μ  A   0    \mu(A)>0     and for any measurable subset    B  ⊂  A      B  A    B\subset A   with       μ   (  B  )    <   μ   (  A  )          μ  B     μ  A     \mu(B)<\mu(A)     the set   B   B   B   has measure zero.  Examples   Consider the set X ={1, 2, ..., 9, 10} and let the sigma-algebra   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   be the power set of X . Define the measure   μ   μ   \mu   of a set to be its cardinality , that is, the number of elements in the set. Then, each of the singletons { i }, for i =1,2, ..., 9, 10 is an atom.  Consider the Lebesgue measure on the real line . This measure has no atoms.   Non-atomic measures  A measure which has no atoms is called non-atomic . In other words, a measure is non-atomic if for any measurable set   A   A   A   with     μ   (  A  )    >  0        μ  A   0    \mu(A)>0   there exists a measurable subset B of A such that       μ   (  A  )    >   μ   (  B  )    >   0.           μ  A     μ  B        0.     \mu(A)>\mu(B)>0.\,     A non-atomic measure with at least one positive value has an infinite number of distinct values, as starting with a set A with     μ   (  A  )    >  0        μ  A   0    \mu(A)>0   one can construct a decreasing sequence of measurable sets      A  =   A  1   ⊃   A  2   ⊃   A  3   ⊃  ⋯        A   subscript  A  1     superset-of     subscript  A  2     superset-of     subscript  A  3     superset-of    normal-⋯     A=A_{1}\supset A_{2}\supset A_{3}\supset\cdots     such that       μ   (  A  )    =   μ   (   A  1   )    >   μ   (   A  2   )    >   μ   (   A  3   )    >  ⋯  >  0.          μ  A     μ   subscript  A  1           μ   subscript  A  2           μ   subscript  A  3         normal-⋯       0.     \mu(A)=\mu(A_{1})>\mu(A_{2})>\mu(A_{3})>\cdots>0.     This may not be true for measures having atoms; see the first example above.  It turns out that non-atomic measures actually have a continuum of values. It can be proved that if μ is a non-atomic measure and A is a measurable set with      μ   (  A  )    >  0   ,        μ  A   0    \mu(A)>0,   then for any real number b satisfying       μ   (  A  )    ≥  b  ≥   0           μ  A   b       0     \mu(A)\geq b\geq 0\,     there exists a measurable subset B of A such that        μ   (  B  )    =  b   .        μ  B   b    \mu(B)=b.\,     This theorem is due to Wacław Sierpiński . 1 2 It is reminiscent of the intermediate value theorem for continuous functions.  Sketch of proof of Sierpiński's theorem on non-atomic measures. A slightly stronger statement, which however makes the proof easier, is that if    (  X  ,  Σ  ,  μ  )     X  normal-Σ  μ    (X,\Sigma,\mu)   is a non-atomic measure space and     μ   (  X  )    =  c        μ  X   c    \mu(X)=c   , there exists a function    S  :    [  0  ,  c  ]   →  Σ      normal-:  S   normal-→   0  c   normal-Σ     S:[0,c]\to\Sigma   that is monotone with respect to inclusion, and a right-inverse to    μ  :   Σ  →   [  0  ,  c  ]       normal-:  μ   normal-→  normal-Σ   0  c      \mu:\Sigma\to[0,\,c]   . That is, there exists a one-parameter family of measurable sets S(t) such that for all    0  ≤  t  ≤   t  ′   ≤  c        0  t        superscript  t  normal-′        c     0\leq t\leq t^{\prime}\leq c           S   (  t  )    ⊂   S   (   t  ′   )     ,        S  t     S   superscript  t  normal-′      S(t)\subset S(t^{\prime}),           μ   (   S   (  t  )    )    =  t   .        μ    S  t    t    \mu\left(S(t)\right)=t.   The proof easily follows from Zorn's lemma applied to the set of all monotone partial sections to   μ   μ   \mu   :      Γ  :=   {  S  :  D  →   Σ   :  D  ⊂   [  0  ,  c  ]   ,   S   monotone  ,  ∀  t  ∈   D    (  μ   (  S   (  t  )   )   =  t  )   }   ,     fragments  Γ  assign   fragments  normal-{  S  normal-:  D  normal-→  Σ  normal-:  D    fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  c  normal-]   normal-,  S  monotone  normal-,  for-all  t   D   fragments  normal-(  μ   fragments  normal-(  S   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-)    t  normal-)   normal-}   normal-,    \Gamma:=\{S:D\to\Sigma\;:\;D\subset[0,\,c],\,S\;\mathrm{monotone},\forall t\in
