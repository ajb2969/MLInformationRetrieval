Generating function (physics)

Generating functions which arise in Hamiltonian mechanics are quite different from generating functions in mathematics. In physics, a generating function is, loosely, a function whose partial derivatives generate the differential equations that determine a system's dynamics. Common examples are the partition function of statistical mechanics, the Hamiltonian, and the function which acts as a bridge between two sets of canonical variables when performing a canonical transformation.
In Canonical Transformations
There are four basic generating functions, summarized by the following table:

Example
Sometimes a given Hamiltonian can be turned into one that looks like the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, which is



For example, with the Hamiltonian



where p is the generalized momentum and q is the generalized coordinate, a good canonical transformation to choose would be
This turns the Hamiltonian into



which is in the form of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.
The generating function F for this transformation is of the third kind,



To find F explicitly, use the equation for its derivative from the table above,



and substitute the expression for P from equation (), expressed in terms of p and Q:



Integrating this with respect to Q results in an equation for the generating function of the transformation given by equation ():

To confirm that this is the correct generating function, verify that it matches ():
