   Generating function (physics)      Generating function (physics)   Generating functions which arise in Hamiltonian mechanics are quite different from generating functions in mathematics. In physics, a generating function is, loosely, a function whose partial derivatives generate the differential equations that determine a system's dynamics. Common examples are the partition function of statistical mechanics, the Hamiltonian, and the function which acts as a bridge between two sets of canonical variables when performing a canonical transformation .  In Canonical Transformations  There are four basic generating functions, summarized by the following table:      Generating Function   Its Derivatives           F  =    F  1    (  q  ,  Q  ,  t  )        F     subscript  F  1    q  Q  t      F=F_{1}(q,Q,t)\,\!          p  =    ∂   F  1     ∂  q        p       subscript  F  1      q      p=~{}~{}\frac{\partial F_{1}}{\partial q}\,\!   and    P  =   -    ∂   F  1     ∂  Q         P         subscript  F  1      Q       P=-\frac{\partial F_{1}}{\partial Q}\,\!            F  =    F  2    (  q  ,  P  ,  t  )    =    F  1   -   Q  P          F     subscript  F  2    q  P  t            subscript  F  1     Q  P       F=F_{2}(q,P,t)=F_{1}-QP\,\!          p  =    ∂   F  2     ∂  q        p       subscript  F  2      q      p=~{}~{}\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial q}\,\!   and    Q  =    ∂   F  2     ∂  P        Q       subscript  F  2      P      Q=~{}~{}\frac{\partial F_{2}}{\partial P}\,\!            F  =    F  3    (  p  ,  Q  ,  t  )    =    F  1   +   q  p          F     subscript  F  3    p  Q  t            subscript  F  1     q  p       F=F_{3}(p,Q,t)=F_{1}+qp\,\!          q  =   -    ∂   F  3     ∂  p         q         subscript  F  3      p       q=-\frac{\partial F_{3}}{\partial p}\,\!   and    P  =   -    ∂   F  3     ∂  Q         P         subscript  F  3      Q       P=-\frac{\partial F_{3}}{\partial Q}\,\!            F  =    F  4    (  p  ,  P  ,  t  )    =     F  1   +   q  p    -   Q  P          F     subscript  F  4    p  P  t              subscript  F  1     q  p      Q  P       F=F_{4}(p,P,t)=F_{1}+qp-QP\,\!          q  =   -    ∂   F  4     ∂  p         q         subscript  F  4      p       q=-\frac{\partial F_{4}}{\partial p}\,\!   and    Q  =    ∂   F  4     ∂  P        Q       subscript  F  4      P      Q=~{}~{}\frac{\partial F_{4}}{\partial P}\,\!        Example  Sometimes a given Hamiltonian can be turned into one that looks like the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, which is       H  =    a   P  2    +   b   Q  2      .      H      a   superscript  P  2      b   superscript  Q  2       H=aP^{2}+bQ^{2}.     For example, with the Hamiltonian       H  =    1   2   q  2     +     p  2    q  4    2     ,      H      1    2   superscript  q  2          superscript  p  2    superscript  q  4    2      H=\frac{1}{2q^{2}}+\frac{p^{2}q^{4}}{2},     where p is the generalized momentum and q is the generalized coordinate, a good canonical transformation to choose would be  This turns the Hamiltonian into       H  =     Q  2   2   +    P  2   2     ,      H       superscript  Q  2   2      superscript  P  2   2      H=\frac{Q^{2}}{2}+\frac{P^{2}}{2},     which is in the form of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.  The generating function F for this transformation is of the third kind,       F  =    F  3    (  p  ,  Q  )     .      F     subscript  F  3    p  Q      F=F_{3}(p,Q).     To find F explicitly, use the equation for its derivative from the table above,       P  =   -    ∂   F  3     ∂  Q      ,      P         subscript  F  3      Q       P=-\frac{\partial F_{3}}{\partial Q},     and substitute the expression for P from equation (), expressed in terms of p and Q :       p   Q  2    =   -    ∂   F  3     ∂  Q           p   superscript  Q  2           subscript  F  3      Q       \frac{p}{Q^{2}}=-\frac{\partial F_{3}}{\partial Q}     Integrating this with respect to Q results in an equation for the generating function of the transformation given by equation ():  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |      F  3    (  p  ,  Q  )    =   p  Q          subscript  F  3    p  Q      p  Q     F_{3}(p,Q)=\frac{p}{Q}   |}  To confirm that this is the correct generating function, verify that it matches ():      q  =   -    ∂   F  3     ∂  p     =    -  1   Q         q         subscript  F  3      p              1   Q      q=-\frac{\partial F_{3}}{\partial p}=\frac{-1}{Q}     See also   Hamilton–Jacobi equation  Poisson bracket   References     "  Category:Classical mechanics  Category:Hamiltonian mechanics
