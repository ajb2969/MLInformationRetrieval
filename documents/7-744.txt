   Cocurvature      Cocurvature   In mathematics in the branch of differential geometry , the cocurvature of a connection on a manifold is the obstruction to the integrability of the vertical bundle .  Definition  If M is a manifold and P is a connection on M , that is a vector-valued 1-form on M which is a projection on T M such that P a b P b c = P a c , then the cocurvature     R  ¯   P     subscript   normal-¯  R   P    \bar{R}_{P}   is a vector-valued 2-form on M defined by         R  ¯   P    (  X  ,  Y  )    =    (   Id  -  P   )    [   P  X   ,   P  Y   ]           subscript   normal-¯  R   P    X  Y        Id  P      P  X     P  Y       \bar{R}_{P}(X,Y)=(\operatorname{Id}-P)[PX,PY]     where X and Y are vector fields on M .
