Jamshidian's trick

Jamshidian's trick is a technique for one-factor asset price models, which re-expresses an option on a portfolio of assets as a portfolio of options. It was developed by Farshid Jamshidian in 1989.
The trick relies on the following simple, but very useful mathematical observation. Consider a sequence of monotone (increasing) functions

 
  of one real variable (which map onto 
 
 
 
 ), a random variable

 
 , and a constant 
 
 
 
 .
Since the function 
 
 
 
  is also increasing and maps onto 
 
 
 
 , there is a unique solution 
 
 
 
  to the equation 
 
 

Since the functions 
 
 
 
  are increasing: 
 
 

In financial applications, each of the random variables 
 
 
 
  represents an asset value, the number 
 
 
 
  is the strike of the option on the portfolio of assets. We can therefore express the payoff of an option on a portfolio of assets in terms of a portfolio of options on the individual assets 
 
 
 
  with corresponding strikes 
 
 
 
 .
