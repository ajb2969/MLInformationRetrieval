   Jamshidian's trick      Jamshidian's trick   Jamshidian's trick is a technique for one-factor asset price models , which re-expresses an option on a portfolio of assets as a portfolio of options. It was developed by Farshid Jamshidian in 1989.  The trick relies on the following simple, but very useful mathematical observation. Consider a sequence of monotone (increasing) functions     f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   of one real variable (which map onto    [  0  ,  ∞  )     0     [0,\infty)   ), a random variable    W   W   W   , and a constant    K  ≥  0      K  0    K\geq 0   .  Since the function     ∑  i    f  i       subscript   i    subscript  f  i     \sum_{i}f_{i}   is also increasing and maps onto    [  0  ,  ∞  )     0     [0,\infty)   , there is a unique solution    w  ∈  ℝ      w  ℝ    w\in\mathbb{R}   to the equation       ∑  i     f  i    (  w  )     =  K   .        subscript   i      subscript  f  i   w    K    \sum_{i}f_{i}(w)=K.     Since the functions    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   are increasing:       (     ∑  i     f  i    (  W  )     -  K   )   +   =    (    ∑  i    (     f  i    (  W  )    -    f  i    (  w  )     )    )   +   =    ∑  i     (     f  i    (  W  )    -    f  i    (  w  )     )    1   {  W  ≥  w  }      =    ∑  i     (     f  i    (  W  )    -    f  i    (  w  )     )   +     .         subscript      subscript   i      subscript  f  i   W    K      subscript    subscript   i        subscript  f  i   W      subscript  f  i   w              subscript   i          subscript  f  i   W      subscript  f  i   w     subscript  1   fragments  normal-{  W   w  normal-}             subscript   i    subscript       subscript  f  i   W      subscript  f  i   w          \left(\sum_{i}f_{i}(W)-K\right)_{+}=\left(\sum_{i}(f_{i}(W)-f_{i}(w))\right)_{%
 +}=\sum_{i}(f_{i}(W)-f_{i}(w))1_{\{W\geq w\}}=\sum_{i}(f_{i}(W)-f_{i}(w))_{+}.     In financial applications, each of the random variables     f  i    (  W  )        subscript  f  i   W    f_{i}(W)   represents an asset value, the number   K   K   K   is the strike of the option on the portfolio of assets. We can therefore express the payoff of an option on a portfolio of assets in terms of a portfolio of options on the individual assets     f  i    (  W  )        subscript  f  i   W    f_{i}(W)   with corresponding strikes     f  i    (  w  )        subscript  f  i   w    f_{i}(w)   .
