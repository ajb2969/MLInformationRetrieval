Almost convergent sequence




Almost convergent sequence

A bounded real sequence

 
  is said to be almost convergent to 
 
 
 
  if each Banach limit assigns the same value 
 
 
 
  to the sequence 
 
 
 
 .
Lorentz proved that 
 
 
 
  is almost convergent if and only if


 
  uniformly in 
 
 
 
 .
The above limit can be rewritten in detail as


 
  Almost convergence is studied in summability theory. It is an example of a summability method which cannot be represented as a matrix method.
