   Pyrimidine-deoxynucleoside 2'-dioxygenase      Pyrimidine-deoxynucleoside 2'-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a pyrimidine-deoxynucleoside 2'-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2'-deoxyuridine + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uridine + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2'-deoxyuridine , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are uridine , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2'-deoxyuridine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (2'-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include deoxyuridine 2'-dioxygenase , deoxyuridine 2'-hydroxylase , pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside 2'-hydroxylase , thymidine 2'-dioxygenase , thymidine 2'-hydroxylase , thymidine 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase , and thymidine dioxygenase . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Ascorbate .  References       "  Category:EC 1.14.11  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Ascorbate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
