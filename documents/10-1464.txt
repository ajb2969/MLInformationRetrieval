   D-lysopine dehydrogenase      D-lysopine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a D-lysopine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 2 -(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-lysine + pyruvate + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N2-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are L-lysine , pyruvate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine:NADP+ oxidoreductase (L-lysine-forming) . Other names in common use include D-lysopine synthase , lysopine dehydrogenase , D(+)-lysopine dehydrogenase , 2-N-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-L-lysine:NADP+ oxidoreductase , and (L-lysine-forming) . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References     "  Category:EC 1.5.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
