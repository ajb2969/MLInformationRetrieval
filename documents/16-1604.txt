   Furstenberg boundary      Furstenberg boundary   In potential theory , a discipline within applied mathematics , the Furstenberg boundary is a notion of boundary associated with a group . It is named for Harry Furstenberg , who introduced it in a series of papers beginning in 1963 (in the case of semisimple Lie groups ). The Furstenberg boundary, roughly speaking, is a universal moduli space for the Poisson integral , expressing a harmonic function on a group in terms of its boundary values.  Motivation  A model for the Furstenberg boundary is the hyperbolic disc     D  =   {  z  ;  |  z  |  <  1  }      fragments  D    fragments  normal-{  z  normal-;  normal-|  z  normal-|   1  normal-}     D=\{z;|z|<1\}   . The classical Poisson formula for a bounded harmonic function on the disc has the form       f   (  z  )    =    1   2  π      ∫  0   2  π      f  ^    (   e   i  θ    )   P   (  z  ,   e   i  θ    )   d  θ           f  z       1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π       normal-^  f    superscript  e    i  θ    P   z   superscript  e    i  θ     d  θ       f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\hat{f}(e^{i\theta})P(z,e^{i\theta})\,d\theta   where m is the Haar measure on the boundary and P is the Poisson kernel. Any function f on the disc determines a function on the group of Möbius transformations of the disc by setting     F   (  g  )    =   f   (   g   (  0  )    )          F  g     f    g  0      F(g)=f(g(0))   . Then the Poisson formula has the form        F   (  g  )    =    ∫    |  z  |   =  1      f  ^    (   g  z   )   d  m   (  z  )      .        F  g     subscript       z   1       normal-^  f     g  z   d  m  z      F(g)=\int_{|z|=1}\hat{f}(gz)\,dm(z).     This function is then harmonic in the sense that it satisfies the mean-value property with respect to a measure on the Möbius group induced from the usual Lebesgue measure of the disc, suitably normalized. The association of a bounded harmonic function to an (essentially) bounded function on the boundary is one-to-one.  Construction for semi-simple groups  In general, let G be a semi-simple Lie group and μ a probability measure on G that is absolutely continuous . A function f on G is μ-harmonic if it satisfies the mean value property with respect to the measure μ:       f   (  g  )    =    ∫  G    f   (   g   g  ′    )   d  μ   (   g  ′   )           f  g     subscript   G     f    g   superscript  g  normal-′    d  μ   superscript  g  normal-′       f(g)=\int_{G}f(gg^{\prime})\,d\mu(g^{\prime})     There is then a compact space Π, with a G action and measure ν , such that any bounded harmonic function on G is given by       f   (  g  )    =    ∫  Π     f  ^    (   g  p   )   d  ν   (  p  )           f  g     subscript   normal-Π      normal-^  f     g  p   d  ν  p      f(g)=\int_{\Pi}\hat{f}(gp)\,d\nu(p)     for some bounded function    f  ^     normal-^  f    \hat{f}   on Π.  The space Π and measure ν depend on the measure μ (and so, what precisely constitutes a harmonic function). However, it turns out that although there are many possibilities for the measure ν (which always depends genuinely on μ), there are only a finite number of spaces Π (up to isomorphism): these are homogeneous spaces of G that are quotients of G by some parabolic subgroup, which can be described completely in terms of root data and a given Iwasawa decomposition . Moreover, there is a maximal such space, with quotient maps going down to all of the other spaces, that is called the Furstenberg boundary.  References       "  Category:Potential theory
