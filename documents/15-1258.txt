23S rRNA (uracil747-C5)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (uracil747-C5)-methyltransferase (, YbjF, RumB, RNA uridine methyltransferase B) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (uracil747-C5)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uracil747 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methyluracil747 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates uracil747 at C5 in 23S rRNA.
