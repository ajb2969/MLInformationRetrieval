   Wirtinger derivatives      Wirtinger derivatives  In [[Complex analysis|complex analysis of one]] and [[several complex variables]], '''Wirtinger derivatives''' (sometimes also called '''Wirtinger operators''' See references {{Harvnb|Fichera|1986|p=62}} and {{harvnb| Kracht|Kreyszig|1988|p=10}}.), named after Wilhelm Wirtinger who introduced them in 1927 in the course of his studies on the theory of functions of several complex variables , are partial differential operators of the first order which behave in a very similar manner to the ordinary derivatives with respect to one real variable , when applied to holomorphic functions , antiholomorphic functions or simply differentiable functions on complex domains . These operators permit the construction of a differential calculus for such functions that is entirely analogous to the ordinary differential calculus for functions of real variables . 1  Historical notes  Early days (1899–1911): the work of Henri Poincaré  Wirtinger derivatives were used in complex analysis at least as early as in the paper , as briefly noted by  and by . 2 As a matter of fact, in the third paragraph of his 1899 paper, 3  Henri Poincaré first defines the complex variable in ℂ n and its complex conjugate as follows         x  k   +   i   y  k     =   z  k       x  k   -   i   y  k     =   u  k       formulae-sequence       subscript  x  k     i   subscript  y  k      subscript  z  k         subscript  x  k     i   subscript  y  k      subscript  u  k      x_{k}+iy_{k}=z_{k}\qquad x_{k}-iy_{k}=u_{k}     where the index   k   k   k   ranges from 1 to   n   n   n   . Then he writes the equation defining the functions   V   V   V   he calls biharmonique , 4 previously written using partial derivatives with respect to the real  variables     x  k     subscript  x  k    x_{k}   ,    y  q     subscript  y  q    y_{q}   with   k   k   k   ,   q   q   q   ranging from 1 to   n   n   n   , exactly in the following way 5         d  2   V    d    z  k    d   u  q     =  0           superscript  d  2   V     d   subscript  z  k   d   subscript  u  q     0    \frac{d^{2}V}{dz_{k}\,du_{q}}=0     This implies that he implicitly used  below: to see this is sufficient to compare equations 2 and 2' of . Apparently, this paper was not noticed by the early savants doing research in the theory of functions of several complex variables : in the papers of ,  (and ) and of  all fundamental partial differential operators of the theory are expressed directly by using partial derivatives respect to the real and imaginary parts of the complex variables involved. In the long survey paper by  (first published in 1913), 6  partial derivatives with respect to each complex variable of a holomorphic function of several complex variables seem to be meant as formal derivatives : as a matter of fact when Osgood express the pluriharmonic operator 7 and the Levi operator , he follows the established practice of Amoroso , Levi and Levi-Civita .  The work of Dimitrie Pompeiu in 1912 and 1913: a new formulation  According to , a new step in the definition of the concept was taken by Dimitrie Pompeiu : in the paper , given a complex valued  differentiable function (in the sense of real analysis ) of one complex variable     g   (  z  )       g  z    g(z)   defined in the neighbourhood of a given point     z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   ∈ℂ, he defines the areolar derivative as the following limit        ∂  g    ∂   z  ¯      (   z  0   )    =  def     lim   r  →  0      1   2  π  i   r  2        ∮   Γ   (   z  0   ,  r  )       g   (  z  )   d  z              g      normal-¯  z      subscript  z  0    def      subscript    normal-→  r  0        1    2  π  i   superscript  r  2       subscript  contour-integral    normal-Γ    subscript  z  0   r       g  z  normal-d  z        {\frac{\partial g}{\partial\bar{z}}(z_{0})}\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}\lim_{r\to

 {d}z}}     where     Γ   (   z  0   ,  r  )    =    ∂  D    (   z  0   ,  r  )         subscript  normal-Γ    subscript  z  0   r        D     subscript  z  0   r      \scriptstyle\Gamma_{(z_{0},r)}=\partial D(z_{0},r)   is the boundary of a disk of radius   r   r   r   entirely contained in the domain of definition of    g   (  z  )       g  z    g(z)   , i.e. his bounding circle . 8 This is evidently an alternative definition of Wirtinger derivative respect to the complex conjugate  variable : 9 it is a more general one, since, as noted a by , the limit may exists for functions that are not even differentiable at    z  =   z  0       z   subscript  z  0     z=z_{0}   . 10 According to , the first to identify the areolar derivative as a weak derivative in the sense of Sobolev was Ilia Vekua . 11 In his following paper,  uses this newly defined concept in order to introduce his generalization of Cauchy's integral formula , the now called Cauchy–Pompeiu formula .  The work of Wilhelm Wirtinger  The first systematic introduction of Wirtinger derivatives seems due to Wilhelm Wirtinger in the paper  in order to simplify the calculations of quantities occurring in the theory of functions of several complex variables : as a result of the introduction of these differential operators , the form of all the differential operators commonly used in the theory, like the Levi operator and the Cauchy–Riemann operator , is considerably simplified and consequently easier to handle. The paper is deliberately written from a formal point of view, i.e. without giving a rigorous derivation of the properties deduced.  Formal definition  Despite their ubiquitous use, 12 it seems that there is no text listing all the properties of Wirtinger derivatives: however, fairly complete references are the short course on multidimensional complex analysis by , 13 the monograph of , 14 and the monograph of 15 which are used as general references in this and the following sections.  Functions of one complex variable  1|Definition 1. Consider the complex plane     ℂ  ≡   ℝ  2   =   {   (  x  ,  y  )   ∣    x  ∈  ℝ   ,   y  ∈  ℝ    }         ℂ   superscript  ℝ  2         conditional-set   x  y    formulae-sequence    x  ℝ     y  ℝ        \mathbb{C}\equiv\mathbb{R}^{2}=\{(x,y)\mid x\in\mathbb{R},\ y\in\mathbb{R}\}   . The Wirtinger derivatives are defined as the following linear  partial differential operators of first order:         ∂   ∂  z    =    1  2    (    ∂   ∂  x    -   i   ∂   ∂  y      )     ,    ∂   ∂   z  ¯     =    1  2    (    ∂   ∂  x    +   i   ∂   ∂  y      )      .     formulae-sequence         z        1  2          x      i       y                normal-¯  z         1  2          x      i       y          \frac{\partial}{\partial z}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-i%
 \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right),\quad\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}}=\frac%
 {1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right).     Clearly, the natural domain of definition of these partial differential operators is the space of     C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}   functions on a domain     Ω  ⊆   ℝ  2       normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  2     \Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}   , but, since these operators are linear and have constant coefficients , they can be readily extended to every space of generalized functions .

As for Wirtinger derivatives for functions of one complex variable, the natural domain of definition of these partial differential operators is again the space of     C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}   functions on a domain     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega    ⊆ ℝ 2n , and again, since these operators are linear and have constant coefficients , they can be readily extended to every space of generalized functions .  Basic properties  In the present section and in the following ones it is assumed that    z  ∈   ℂ  n       z   superscript  ℂ  n     z\in\mathbb{C}^{n}   is a complex vector and that    z  ≡   (  x  ,  y  )   =   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  n   )         z   x  y          subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y  n       z\equiv(x,y)=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},y_{1},\ldots,y_{n})   where   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   are real vectors , with n ≥ 1: also it is assumed that the subset     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega    can be thought of as a domain in the real  euclidean space ℝ 2 n or in his isomorphic  complex counterpart ℂ n . All the proofs are easy consequences of  and  and of the corresponding properties of the derivatives (ordinary or partial ).  Linearity  3|Lemma 1.

"  Category:Complex analysis  Category:Differential operators  Category:Mathematical analysis     Some of the basic properties of Wirtinger derivatives are the same ones as the properties characterizing the ordinary (or partial) derivatives and used for the construction of the usual differential calculus . ↩  Reference to the work  of Henri Poincaré is precisely stated by , while Reinhold Remmert does not cite any reference to support his assertion. ↩  See reference ↩  These functions are precisely pluriharmonic functions , and the linear differential operator defining them, i.e. the operator in equation 2 of , is exactly the n -dimensional  pluriharmonic operator . ↩  See , equation 2': note that, throughout the paper, the symbol   d   d   d   is used to signify partial differentiation respect to a given variable , instead of the now commonplace symbol ∂. ↩  The corrected Dover edition of the paper  contains much important historical information on the early development of the theory of functions of several complex variables , and is therefore a useful source. ↩  See : curiously, he calls Cauchy–Riemann equations this set of equations. ↩  This is the definition given by  in his approach to Pompeiu's work : as  remarks, the original definition of  does not require the domain of integration to be a circle . See the entry areolar derivative for further information. ↩  See the section " Formal definition " of this entry. ↩  See problem 2 in  for one example of such a function. ↩  See also the excellent book by , theorem 1.31: If the generalized derivative     ∂   z  ¯    w      subscript    normal-¯  z    w    \scriptstyle\partial_{\bar{z}}w   ∈      L  p    (  Ω  )        subscript  L  p   normal-Ω    L_{p}(\Omega)    , p>1, then the function    w   (  z  )       w  z    w(z)   has almost everywhere in   G   G   G   a derivative in the sense of Pompeiu , the latter being equal to the Generalized derivative in the sense of Sobolev      ∂   z  ¯    w      subscript    normal-¯  z    w    \scriptstyle\partial_{\bar{z}}w    . ↩  With or without the attribution of the concept to Wilhelm Wirtinger : see, for example, the well known monograph . ↩  In this course lectures, Aldo Andreotti uses the properties of Wirtinger derivatives in order to prove the closure of the algebra of holomorphic functions under certain operations : this purpose is common to all references cited in this section. ↩  This is a classical work on the theory of functions of several complex variables dealing mainly with its sheaf theoretic aspects: however, in the introductory sections, Wirtinger derivatives and a few other analytical tools are introduced and their application to the theory is described. ↩  In this work, the authors prove some of the properties of Wirtinger derivatives also for the general case of    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}    functions : in this single aspect, their approach is different from the one adopted by the other authors cited in this section, and perhaps more complete. ↩  See  and also : Gunning considers the general case of     C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}   functions but only for p = 1. References  and , as already pointed out, consider only holomorphic maps with p = 1: however, the resulting formulas are formally very similar. ↩
