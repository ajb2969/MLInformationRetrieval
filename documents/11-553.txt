S-formylglutathione hydrolase

In enzymology, a S-formylglutathione hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-formylglutathione + H2O 
 
 
 
  glutathione + formate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-formylglutathione and H2O, whereas its two products are glutathione and formate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-formylglutathione hydrolase. This enzyme participates in methane metabolism.
