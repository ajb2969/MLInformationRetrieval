In differential geometry, a Richmond surface is a minimal surface first described by Herbert William Richmond in 1904. 1 It is a family of surfaces with one planar end and one Enneper surface-like self-intersecting end.
It has Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization

 
 . This allows a parametrization based on a complex parameter as


 
 
  The associate family of the surface is just the surface rotated around the z-axis.
Taking m = 2 a real parametric expression becomes:2
