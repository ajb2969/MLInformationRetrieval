   Richmond surface      Richmond surface   (Figure)  Richmond surface for m=2.   In differential geometry , a Richmond surface is a minimal surface first described by Herbert William Richmond in 1904. 1 It is a family of surfaces with one planar end and one Enneper surface -like self-intersecting end.  It has Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization       f   (  z  )    =   1  /   z  m     ,    g   (  z  )    =   z  m       formulae-sequence      f  z     1   superscript  z  m         g  z    superscript  z  m      f(z)=1/z^{m},g(z)=z^{m}   . This allows a parametrization based on a complex parameter as      X   (  z  )       X  z    \displaystyle X(z)   The associate family of the surface is just the surface rotated around the z-axis.  Taking m = 2 a real parametric expression becomes: 2      X   (  u  ,  v  )       X   u  v     \displaystyle X(u,v)     References  "  Category:Minimal surfaces     Jesse Douglas , Tibor Radó, The Problem of Plateau: A Tribute to Jesse Douglas & Tibor Radó, World Scientific, 1992 (p. 239-240) ↩  John Oprea, The Mathematics of Soap Films: Explorations With Maple, American Mathematical Soc., 2000 ↩
