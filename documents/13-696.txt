   Theorem of three moments      Theorem of three moments   In civil engineering and structural analysis  Clapeyron 's theorem of three moments is a relationship among the bending moments at three consecutive supports of a horizontal beam.  Let A,B,C be the three consecutive points of support, and denote by l the length of AB by    l  ′     superscript  l  normal-′    l^{\prime}   the length of BC , by w and    w  ′     superscript  w  normal-′    w^{\prime}   the weight per unit of length in these segments. Then 1 the bending moments     M  A   ,   M  B   ,   M  C       subscript  M  A    subscript  M  B    subscript  M  C     M_{A},\,M_{B},\,M_{C}   at the three points are related by:          M  A   l   +   2   M  B    (   l  +   l  ′    )    +    M  C    l  ′     =     1  4   w   l  3    +    1  4    w  ′     (   l  ′   )   3      .           subscript  M  A   l     2   subscript  M  B     l   superscript  l  normal-′        subscript  M  C    superscript  l  normal-′           1  4   w   superscript  l  3        1  4    superscript  w  normal-′    superscript   superscript  l  normal-′   3       M_{A}l+2M_{B}(l+l^{\prime})+M_{C}l^{\prime}=\frac{1}{4}wl^{3}+\frac{1}{4}w^{%
 \prime}(l^{\prime})^{3}.     This equation can also be written as 2         M  A   l   +   2   M  B    (   l  +   l  ′    )    +    M  C    l  ′     =     6   a  1    x  1    l   +    6   a  2    x  2     l  ′              subscript  M  A   l     2   subscript  M  B     l   superscript  l  normal-′        subscript  M  C    superscript  l  normal-′           6   subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1    l       6   subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2     superscript  l  normal-′       M_{A}l+2M_{B}(l+l^{\prime})+M_{C}l^{\prime}=\frac{6a_{1}x_{1}}{l}+\frac{6a_{2}%
 x_{2}}{l^{\prime}}     where a 1 is the area on the bending moment diagram due to vertical loads on AB, a 2 is the area due to loads on BC, x 1 is the distance from A to the center of gravity for the b.m. diagram for AB, x 2 is the distance from C to the c.g. for the b.m. diagram for BC.  The second equation is more general as it does not require that the weight of each segment be distributed uniformly.  Derivation of Three Moments Equations  Mohr's Theorem 3 can be used to derive the Three Moment Theorem 4 (TMT).  Mohr's First Theorem  The change in slope of a deflection curve between two points of a beam is equal to the area of the M/EI diagram between those two points.(Figure 02)  Mohr's Second Theorem  Consider two points k1 and k2 on a beam . The deflection of k1 and k2 relative to the point of intersection between tangent at k1 and k2 and vertical through k1 is equal to the M/EI diagram between k1 and k2 about k1.(Figure 03)  Three Moment Equation expresses the relation between bending moments at three successive supports of a continuous beam , subject to a loading on a two adjacent span with or without settlement of the supports.  The Sign Convention  According to the Figure 04,   The moment M1, M2, and M3 be positive if they cause compression in the upper part of the beam. ( Sagging positive)  The deflection downward positive. (Downward settlement positive)  Let ABC is a continuous beam with support at A,B, and C. Then moment at A,B, and C are M1, M2, and M3, respectively.  Let A' B' and C' be the final positions of the beam ABC due to support settlements .
