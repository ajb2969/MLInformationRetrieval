   Henderson–Hasselbalch equation      Henderson–Hasselbalch equation   In chemistry , the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation describes the derivation of pH as a measure of acidity (using , the negative log of the acid dissociation constant ) in biological and chemical systems. The equation is also useful for estimating the pH of a buffer solution and finding the equilibrium pH in acid-base reactions (it is widely used to calculate the isoelectric point of proteins).  The equation is given by:      pH  =    p   K  a    +    log  10    (    [   A  -   ]    [  HA  ]    )         pH      normal-p   subscript  K  normal-a      subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]  HA        \mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[%

Bracketed quantities such as [base] and [acid] denote the molar concentration of the quantity enclosed.  For bases  For the standard base equation: 1       B  +   H  +    ⇌   BH  +      normal-⇌    normal-B   superscript  normal-H      superscript  BH      \mathrm{B}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\rightleftharpoons\mathrm{BH}^{+}     A second form of the equation, known as the Heylman Equation, expressed in terms of    K  b     subscript  K  normal-b    K_{\mathrm{b}}   where    K  b     subscript  K  normal-b    K_{\mathrm{b}}   is the base dissociation constant :       p   K  b    =   -    log  10    (   K  b   )     =   -    log  10    (     [   OH  -   ]    [  HA  ]     [   A  -   ]    )             normal-p   subscript  K  normal-b        subscript   10    subscript  K  normal-b              subscript   10        delimited-[]   superscript  OH      delimited-[]  HA     delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A           \mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{b}}=-\log_{10}(K_{\mathrm{b}})=-\log_{10}\left(\frac{[%
 \mathrm{O}\mathrm{H}^{-}][\mathrm{HA}]}{[\mathrm{A}^{-}]}\right)     In analogy to the above equations, the following equation is valid:      pOH  =    p   K  b    +    log  10    (    [   BH  +   ]    [  B  ]    )         pOH      normal-p   subscript  K  normal-b      subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript  BH      delimited-[]  normal-B        \mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{b}}+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}{%

Using the properties of these terms at 25 degrees Celsius one can synthesise an equation for pH of basic solutions in terms of p K a and pH:      pH  =    p   K  a    +    log  10    (    [  B  ]    [   BH  +   ]    )         pH      normal-p   subscript  K  normal-a      subscript   10      delimited-[]  normal-B    delimited-[]   superscript  BH          \mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{B}]}{[%
 \mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\right)     Derivation  The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is derived from the acid dissociation constant equation by the following steps: 2       K  a   =     [   H  +   ]    [   A  -   ]     [  HA  ]         subscript  K  normal-a        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A       delimited-[]  HA      K_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{[\mathrm{H}^{+}][\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}     Taking the log, to base ten, of both sides gives:        log  10    K  a    =    log  10    (     [   H  +   ]    [   A  -   ]     [  HA  ]    )          subscript   10    subscript  K  normal-a      subscript   10        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-H      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A       delimited-[]  HA       \log_{10}K_{\mathrm{a}}=\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{H}^{+}][\mathrm{A}^{-}]}%
 {[\mathrm{HA}]}\right)     Then, using the properties of logarithms :        log  10    K  a    =     log  10    [   H  +   ]    +    log  10    (    [   A  -   ]    [  HA  ]    )           subscript   10    subscript  K  normal-a        subscript   10    superscript  normal-H       subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]  HA        \log_{10}K_{\mathrm{a}}=\log_{10}[\mathrm{H}^{+}]+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[%
 \mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}\right)     Identifying the left-hand side of this equation as -p K a and the     log  10    [   H  +   ]       subscript   10    superscript  normal-H      \log_{10}[\mathrm{H}^{+}]   as -pH:       -   p   K  a     =    -  pH   +    log  10    (    [   A  -   ]    [  HA  ]    )             normal-p   subscript  K  normal-a         pH     subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]  HA        -\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}=-\mathrm{pH}+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{%
 [\mathrm{HA}]}\right)     Adding pH and p K a to both sides:      pH  =    p   K  a    +    log  10    (    [   A  -   ]    [  HA  ]    )         pH      normal-p   subscript  K  normal-a      subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]  HA        \mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}}+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{A}^{-}]}{[%
 \mathrm{HA}]}\right)     The ratio     [   A  -   ]   /   [  HA  ]        delimited-[]   superscript  normal-A      delimited-[]  HA     [\mathrm{A}^{-}]/[\mathrm{HA}]   is unitless, and as such, other ratios with other units may be used. For example, the mole ratio of the components,     n   A  -    /   n   H  A         subscript  n   superscript  A      subscript  n    H  A      n_{A^{-}}/n_{HA}   or the fractional concentrations     α   A  -    /   α   H  A         subscript  α   superscript  A      subscript  α    H  A      \alpha_{A^{-}}/\alpha_{HA}   where      α   A  -    +   α   H  A     =  1         subscript  α   superscript  A      subscript  α    H  A     1    \alpha_{A^{-}}+\alpha_{HA}=1   will yield the same answer. Sometimes these other units are more convenient to use.  History  Lawrence Joseph Henderson wrote an equation, in 1908, describing the use of carbonic acid as a buffer solution . Karl Albert Hasselbalch later re-expressed that formula in logarithmic terms, resulting in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation 1 . Hasselbalch was using the formula to study metabolic acidosis .  Limitations  There are some significant approximations implicit in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. The most significant is the assumption that the concentration of the acid and its conjugate base at equilibrium will remain the same as the formal concentration. This neglects the dissociation of the acid and the binding of H+ to the base. The dissociation of water and relative water concentration itself is neglected as well. These approximations will fail when dealing with relatively strong acids or bases (pKa more than a couple units away from 7), dilute or very concentrated solutions (less than 1 mM or greater than 1M), or heavily skewed acid/base ratios (more than 100 to 1). In high buffer dilutions, where the concentration of protons arising from water become equally or more prevalent than the buffer species themselves (at pH 7, this means buffer component concentrations of −5 M formally, but practically much higher), the pKa of the 'buffer' system will tend towards neutrality.  Estimating blood pH  The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation can be applied to relate the pH of blood to constituents of the bicarbonate buffering system : 3       pH  =    p   K    a    H  2    CO  3      +    log  10    (    [   HCO  3  -   ]    [    H  2    CO  3    ]    )      ,      pH      normal-p   subscript  K    normal-a   subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  CO  3        subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  HCO  3       delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  CO  3          \mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p}K_{\mathrm{a}~{}\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}}+\log_{10}%

It is equal to 6.1.  is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood  is the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood   This is useful in arterial blood gas , but these usually state , that is, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide , rather than . However, these are related by the equation: 4        [    H  2    CO  3    ]   =     k    H    CO  2      ×   p   CO  2      ,       delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  CO  3        subscript  k    normal-H   subscript  CO  2      subscript  p   subscript  CO  2       [\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}]=k_{\rm H~{}CO_{2}}\,\times p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}},   where:   is the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood  is the Henry's law constant for the solubility of carbon dioxide in blood. k H CO 2 is approximately 0.0307 mmol /( L - torr )  is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood   Taken together, the following equation can be used to relate the pH of blood to the concentration of bicarbonate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 5       pH  =   6.1  +    log  10    (    [   HCO  3  -   ]    0.0307  ×   p   CO  2      )      ,      pH    6.1    subscript   10      delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  HCO  3        0.0307   subscript  p   subscript  CO  2          \mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log_{10}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{0.0307\times p_{%
