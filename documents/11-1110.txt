   (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate transaminase      (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate transaminase   In enzymology , a (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include L-3-aminoisobutyrate transaminase , beta-aminobutyric transaminase , L-3-aminoisobutyric aminotransferase , and beta-aminoisobutyrate-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
