   Steinberg symbol      Steinberg symbol   In mathematics a Steinberg symbol is a pairing function which generalises the Hilbert symbol and plays a role in the algebraic K-theory of fields . It is named after mathematician Robert Steinberg .  For a field F we define a Steinberg symbol (or simply a symbol ) to be a function     (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )   :     F  *   ×   F  *    →  G      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→     superscript  F     superscript  F     G     (\cdot,\cdot):F^{*}\times F^{*}\rightarrow G   , where G is an abelian group, written multiplicatively, such that       (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   is bimultiplicative;  if     a  +  b   =  1        a  b   1    a+b=1   then     (  a  ,  b  )   =  1       a  b   1    (a,b)=1   .   The symbols on F derive from a "universal" symbol, which may be regarded as taking values in      F  *   ⊗   F  *    /   ⟨    a  ⊗  1   -  a   ⟩        tensor-product   superscript  F     superscript  F      delimited-⟨⟩     tensor-product  a  1   a      F^{*}\otimes F^{*}/\langle a\otimes 1-a\rangle   . By a theorem of Matsumoto, this group is     K  2   F       subscript  K  2   F    K_{2}F   and is part of the Milnor K-theory for a field.  Properties  If (⋅,⋅) is a symbol then (assuming all terms are defined)        (  a  ,   -  a   )   =  1       a    a    1    (a,-a)=1   ;       (  b  ,  a  )   =    (  a  ,  b  )    -  1         b  a    superscript   a  b     1      (b,a)=(a,b)^{-1}   ;       (  a  ,  a  )   =   (  a  ,   -  1   )        a  a    a    1      (a,a)=(a,-1)   is an element of order 1 or 2;       (  a  ,  b  )   =   (   a  +  b   ,   -   b  /  a    )        a  b      a  b       b  a       (a,b)=(a+b,-b/a)   .   Examples   The trivial symbol which is identically 1.    The Hilbert symbol on F with values in {±1} defined by 1 2        (  a  ,  b  )   =   {      1  ,        if   z  2    =    a   x  2    +   b   y  2   has a non-zero solution   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     ∈   F  3    ;         -  1   ,     if not.           a  b    cases  1        if   superscript  z  2        a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2   has a non-zero solution   x  y  z           superscript  F  3       1   if not.     (a,b)=\begin{cases}1,&\mbox{ if }z^{2}=ax^{2}+by^{2}\mbox{ has a non-zero %
 solution }(x,y,z)\in F^{3};\\
 -1,&\mbox{ if not.}\end{cases}      The Contou-Carrère symbol is a symbol for the ring of Laurent power series over an Artinian ring .   Continuous symbols  If F is a topological field then a symbol c is weakly continuous if for each y in F ∗ the set of x in F ∗ such that c ( x , y ) = 1 is closed in F ∗ . This makes no reference to a topology on the codomain G . If G is a topological group , then one may speak of a continuous symbol , and when G is Hausdorff then a continuous symbol is weakly continuous. 3  The only weakly continuous symbols on R are the trivial symbol and the Hilbert symbol: the only weakly continuous symbol on C is the trivial symbol. 4 The characterisation of weakly continuous symbols on a non-Archimedean local field  F was obtained by Moore. The group K 2 ( F ) is the direct sum of a cyclic group of order m and a divisible group K 2 ( F ) m . A symbol on F lifts to a homomorphism on K 2 ( F ) and is weakly continuous precisely when it annihilates the divisible component K 2 ( F ) m . It follows that every weakly continuous symbol factors through the norm residue symbol . 5  See also   Steinberg group (K-theory)   References        External links   Steinberg symbol at the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics   "  Category:K-theory     ↩  Milnor (1971) p.94 ↩  Milnor (1971) p.165 ↩  Milnor (1971) p.166 ↩  Milnor (1971) p.175 ↩
