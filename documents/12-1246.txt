   Organic nonlinear optical materials      Organic nonlinear optical materials   Organic materials are expected to have relatively strong nonlinear optical properties due to delocalized electrons at    π  -  π      π  π    \pi-\pi   * orbitals. This expectation explains extensive search for better NLO materials among organic crystals.  L-arginine maleate dihydrate (LAMD)  L-Arginine is one of the essential amino acids widely distributed in biological substances. It forms a number of salts with organic and inorganic acids showing non-linear optical properties. L-Arginine maleate dihydrate (LAMD, C 6 H 14 N 4 O 2 ,C 4 H 4 O 4 ,2H 2 O) is one of these L-arginine salts which is a complex of strongly basic amino acid, carboxylic acid and provides useful information in relation to molecular interaction in present day biological systems and to prebiotic self-organisms. 1 It is also a nonlinear optical material with second harmonic generation efficiency 1.68 times that of KDP. 2 LAMD crystals are grown from solution by solvent evaporation; they belong to the triclinic space group P1.  L-methionine L-methioninium hydrogen maleate (LMMM)  LMMM too belongs to the amino acid family. Crystals are grown by slow evaporation of an aqueous solution containing L-methionine and maleic acid , resulting in centimeter-large crystals of a non-centrosymmetric space group. 3 They were applied for second harmonic generation of an Nd:YAG laser (wavelength 1064 nm), and SHG efficiency equal to that of KDP has been obtained.
