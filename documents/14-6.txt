   Secondary leading-tone chord      Secondary leading-tone chord     In music theory , a secondary leading-tone chord or secondary diminished seventh , as in seventh scale degree 1 or leading-tone , is a secondary  chord but rather than being a dominant it is a leading-tone seventh chord or triad , which are similar in function to dominant chords. Also similar to secondary dominant chords they are altered chords . In contrast to secondary dominant chords they do not move in circle progressions but rather resolve up by half step . Fully diminished seventh chords are more common than half-diminished seventh chords and one may also find diminished triads [without sevenths]. 2  Secondary leading-tone chords may resolve to either a major or minor diatonic triad: Benward & Saker (2003), p.271   In major keys : ii , iii , IV , V, vi   In minor keys : III, iv, V, VI   For example vii 7 /V or vii 7 /iv. Especially in four-part writing , the seventh should resolve downwards by step and if possible the lower tritone should resolve appropriately, inwards if a diminished fifth and outwards if an augmented fourth. 3  In harmonic analysis secondary sevenths are expressed in the following format:       v  i   i   o  x     y        v  i   superscript  i    o  x     y    \frac{vii^{ox}}{y}     where x = the correct inversion symbol [ figured bass ], and y = the root of the chord of resolution as a Roman numeral. 4  Sources  "  Category:Secondary chords     Blatter, Alfred (2007).
