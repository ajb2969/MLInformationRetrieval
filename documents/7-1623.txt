Monoidal adjunction

Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two monoidal categories. A monoidal adjunction between two lax monoidal functors


 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an adjunction

 
  between the underlying functors, such that the natural transformations


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are monoidal natural transformations.
Lifting adjunctions to monoidal adjunctions
Suppose that


 
  is a lax monoidal functor such that the underlying functor 
 
 
 
  has a right adjoint 
 
 
 
 . This adjuction lifts to a monoidal adjuction 
 
 
 
 ⊣
 
 
 
  if and only if the lax monoidal functor 
 
 
 
  is strong.

  defines a monoidal monad
