   Thiocyanate isomerase      Thiocyanate isomerase   In enzymology , a thiocyanate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzyl isothiocyanate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzyl thiocyanate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , benzyl isothiocyanate , and one product , benzyl thiocyanate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those other isomerases sole sub-subclass for isomerases that do not belong in the other subclasses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzyl-thiocyanate isomerase . This enzyme is also called isothiocyanate isomerase .
