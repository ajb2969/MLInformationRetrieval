   Free algebra      Free algebra   In mathematics , especially in the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory , a free algebra is the noncommutative analogue of a polynomial ring (which may be regarded as a free commutative algebra ).  Definition  For R a commutative ring , the free ( associative , unital ) algebra on n  indeterminates { X 1 ,..., X n } is the free R -module with a basis consisting of all words over the alphabet { X 1 ,..., X n } (including the empty word, which is the unity of the free algebra). This R -module becomes an R -algebra by defining a multiplication as follows: the product of two basis elements is the concatenation of the corresponding words:         (    X   i  1     X   i  2    ⋯   X   i  m     )   ⋅   (    X   j  1     X   j  2    ⋯   X   j  n     )    =    X   i  1     X   i  2    ⋯   X   i  m     X   j  1     X   j  2    ⋯   X   j  n      ,       normal-⋅     subscript  X   subscript  i  1     subscript  X   subscript  i  2    normal-⋯   subscript  X   subscript  i  m        subscript  X   subscript  j  1     subscript  X   subscript  j  2    normal-⋯   subscript  X   subscript  j  n         subscript  X   subscript  i  1     subscript  X   subscript  i  2    normal-⋯   subscript  X   subscript  i  m     subscript  X   subscript  j  1     subscript  X   subscript  j  2    normal-⋯   subscript  X   subscript  j  n       \left(X_{i_{1}}X_{i_{2}}\cdots X_{i_{m}}\right)\cdot\left(X_{j_{1}}X_{j_{2}}%
 \cdots X_{j_{n}}\right)=X_{i_{1}}X_{i_{2}}\cdots X_{i_{m}}X_{j_{1}}X_{j_{2}}%
 \cdots X_{j_{n}},     and the product of two arbitrary elements is thus uniquely determined (because the multiplication in an R -algebra must be R -bilinear). This R -algebra is denoted R ⟨ X 1 ,..., X n ⟩. This construction can easily be generalized to an arbitrary set X of indeterminates.  In short, for an arbitrary set    X  =   {    X  i    ;  i  ∈  I  }      fragments  X    fragments  normal-{   subscript  X  i   normal-;  i   I  normal-}     X=\{X_{i}\,;\;i\in I\}   , the free ( associative , unital ) R - algebra on X is       R   ⟨  X  ⟩    :=    ⊕   w  ∈   X  ∗      R  w       assign    R   delimited-⟨⟩  X      subscript  direct-sum    w   superscript  X  normal-∗       R  w      R\langle X\rangle:=\bigoplus_{w\in X^{\ast}}Rw   with the R -bilinear multiplication that is concatenation on words, where X * denotes the free monoid on X (i.e. words on the letters X i ),   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   denotes the external direct sum , and Rw denotes the free R -module on 1 element, the word w .  For example, in R ⟨ X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , X 4 ⟩, for scalars α,β,γ,δ ∈ R , a concrete example of a product of two elements is      (    α   X  1    X  2  2    +   β   X  2    X  3     )   ⋅   (    γ   X  2    X  1    +   δ   X  1  4    X  4     )    =    α  γ   X  1    X  2  3    X  1    +   α  δ   X  1    X  2  2    X  1  4    X  4    +   β  γ   X  2    X  3    X  2    X  1    +   β  δ   X  2    X  3    X  1  4    X  4          normal-⋅      α   subscript  X  1    superscript   subscript  X  2   2      β   subscript  X  2    subscript  X  3         γ   subscript  X  2    subscript  X  1      δ   superscript   subscript  X  1   4    subscript  X  4          α  γ   subscript  X  1    superscript   subscript  X  2   3    subscript  X  1      α  δ   subscript  X  1    superscript   subscript  X  2   2    superscript   subscript  X  1   4    subscript  X  4      β  γ   subscript  X  2    subscript  X  3    subscript  X  2    subscript  X  1      β  δ   subscript  X  2    subscript  X  3    superscript   subscript  X  1   4    subscript  X  4       (\alpha X_{1}X_{2}^{2}+\beta X_{2}X_{3})\cdot(\gamma X_{2}X_{1}+\delta X_{1}^{%
 4}X_{4})=\alpha\gamma X_{1}X_{2}^{3}X_{1}+\alpha\delta X_{1}X_{2}^{2}X_{1}^{4}%
 X_{4}+\beta\gamma X_{2}X_{3}X_{2}X_{1}+\beta\delta X_{2}X_{3}X_{1}^{4}X_{4}   .  The non-commutative polynomial ring may be identified with the monoid ring over R of the free monoid of all finite words in the X i .  Contrast with Polynomials  Since the words over the alphabet { X 1 , ..., X n } form a basis of R ⟨ X 1 ,..., X n ⟩, it is clear that any element of R ⟨ X 1 , ..., X n ⟩ can be uniquely written in the form:        ∑     i  1   ,   i  2   ,  ⋯  ,   i  k    ∈   {  1  ,  2  ,  ⋯  ,  n  }       a    i  1   ,   i  2   ,  ⋯  ,   i  k      X   i  1     X   i  2    ⋯   X   i  k      ,      subscript       subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2   normal-⋯   subscript  i  k     1  2  normal-⋯  n        subscript  a    subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2   normal-⋯   subscript  i  k      subscript  X   subscript  i  1     subscript  X   subscript  i  2    normal-⋯   subscript  X   subscript  i  k       \sum\limits_{i_{1},i_{2},\cdots,i_{k}\in\left\{1,2,\cdots,n\right\}}a_{i_{1},i%
 _{2},\cdots,i_{k}}X_{i_{1}}X_{i_{2}}\cdots X_{i_{k}},     where    a    i  1   ,   i  2   ,  …  ,   i  k       subscript  a    subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2   normal-…   subscript  i  k      a_{i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k}}   are elements of R and all but finitely many of these elements are zero. This explains why the elements of R ⟨ X 1 ,..., X n ⟩ are often denoted as "non-commutative polynomials" in the "variables" (or "indeterminates") X 1 ,..., X n ; the elements    a    i  1   ,   i  2   ,  …  ,   i  k       subscript  a    subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2   normal-…   subscript  i  k      a_{i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{k}}   are said to be "coefficients" of these polynomials, and the R -algebra R ⟨ X 1 ,..., X n ⟩ is called the "non-commutative polynomial algebra over R in n indeterminates". Note that unlike in an actual polynomial ring , the variables do not commute . For example X 1 X 2 does not equal X 2 X 1 .  More generally, one can construct the free algebra R ⟨ E ⟩ on any set E of generators . Since rings may be regarded as Z -algebras, a free ring on E can be defined as the free algebra Z ⟨ E ⟩.  Over a field , the free algebra on n indeterminates can be constructed as the tensor algebra on an n -dimensional vector space . For a more general coefficient ring, the same construction works if we take the free module on n  generators .  The construction of the free algebra on E is functorial in nature and satisfies an appropriate universal property . The free algebra functor is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of R -algebras to the category of sets .  Free algebras over division rings are free ideal rings .
