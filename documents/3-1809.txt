   Trigonometric polynomial      Trigonometric polynomial   In the mathematical subfields of numerical analysis and mathematical analysis , a trigonometric polynomial is a finite linear combination of functions sin( nx ) and cos( nx ) with n taking on the values of one or more natural numbers . The coefficients may be taken as real numbers, for real-valued functions. For complex coefficients , there is no difference between such a function and a finite Fourier series .  Trigonometric polynomials are widely used, for example in trigonometric interpolation applied to the interpolation of periodic functions . They are used also in the discrete Fourier transform .  The term trigonometric polynomial for the real-valued case can be seen as using the analogy : the functions sin( nx ) and cos( nx ) are similar to the monomial basis for polynomials . In the complex case the trigonometric polynomials are spanned by the positive and negative powers of e ix .  Formal definition  Any function T of the form      T   (  x  )   =   a  0   +   ∑   n  =  1   N    a  n   cos   (  n  x  )   +  i   ∑   n  =  1   N    b  n   sin   (  n  x  )    (  x  ∈  𝐑  )      fragments  T   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  a  0     superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  a  n     fragments  normal-(  n  x  normal-)    i   superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  b  n     fragments  normal-(  n  x  normal-)   italic-   fragments  normal-(  x   R  normal-)     T(x)=a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}a_{n}\cos(nx)+\mathrm{i}\sum_{n=1}^{N}b_{n}\sin(nx)%

Using Euler's formula the polynomial can be rewritten as      T   (  x  )   =   ∑   n  =   -  N    N    c  n    e   i  n  x     (  x  ∈  𝐑  )   .     fragments  T   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     superscript   subscript     n    N     N    subscript  c  n    superscript  normal-e    normal-i  n  x    italic-   fragments  normal-(  x   R  normal-)   normal-.    T(x)=\sum_{n=-N}^{N}c_{n}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}nx}\qquad(x\in\mathbf{R}).     Analogously let a n , b n be in R , 0 ≤ n ≤ N and a N ≠ 0 or b N ≠ 0 then      t   (  x  )   =   a  0   +   ∑   n  =  1   N    a  n   cos   (  n  x  )   +   ∑   n  =  1   N    b  n   sin   (  n  x  )    (  x  ∈  𝐑  )      fragments  t   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  a  0     superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  a  n     fragments  normal-(  n  x  normal-)     superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  b  n     fragments  normal-(  n  x  normal-)   italic-   fragments  normal-(  x   R  normal-)     t(x)=a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}a_{n}\cos(nx)+\sum_{n=1}^{N}b_{n}\sin(nx)\qquad(x\in%
 \mathbf{R})     is called real trigonometric polynomial of degree N .  Notes  A trigonometric polynomial can be considered a periodic function on the real line , with period some multiple of 2π, or as a function on the unit circle .  A basic result is that the trigonometric polynomials are dense in the space of continuous functions on the unit circle, with the uniform norm ; this is a special case of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem . More concretely, for every continuous function ƒ and every ε > 0, there exists a trigonometric polynomial T such that |ƒ( z ) − T( z )| [ a , a + 2π) with a in R , unless it is the zero function .
