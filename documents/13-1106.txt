   Schreier coset graph      Schreier coset graph   In the area of mathematics called combinatorial group theory , the Schreier coset graph is a graph associated to a group  G , a generating set { x i : i in I }, and a subgroup  H ≤ G .  Description  The vertices of the graph are the right cosets  Hg = { hg : h in H } for g in G .  The edges of the graph are of the form ( Hg , Hgx i ).  The Cayley graph of the group G with { x i : i in I } is the Schreier coset graph for H = { 1 G },.  A spanning tree of a Schreier coset graph corresponds to a Schreier transversal, as in Schreier's subgroup lemma , .  The book "Categories and Groupoids" listed below relates this to the theory of covering morphisms of groupoids . A subgroup H of a group G determines a covering morphism of groupoids    p  :   K  →  G      normal-:  p   normal-→  K  G     p:K\rightarrow G   and if X is a generating set for G then its inverse image under p is the Schreier graph of (G,X) .  Name  The graph is named after Otto Schreier .  Applications  The graph is useful to understand coset enumeration and the Todd–Coxeter algorithm .  Coset graphs can be used to form large permutation representations of groups and were used by Graham Higman to show that the alternating groups of large enough degree are Hurwitz groups , .  Every vertex-transitive graph is a coset graph.  References     Schreier graphs of the Basilica group Authors: Daniele D'Angeli, Alfredo Donno, Michel Matter, Tatiana Nagnibeda    Philip J.
