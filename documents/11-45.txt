   Arachidonate—CoA ligase      Arachidonate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , an arachidonate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + arachidonate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + arachidonoyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , arachidonate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and arachidonoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is arachidonate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme is also called arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase .
