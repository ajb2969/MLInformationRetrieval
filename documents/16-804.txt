   Caratheodory-π solution      Caratheodory-π solution  A '''Carathéodory-{{pi}} solution''' is a generalized solution to an [[ordinary differential equation]]. The concept is due to I. Michael Ross and named in honor of Constantin Carathéodory . 1 Its practicality was demonstrated in 2008 by Ross et al. 2 in a laboratory implementation of the concept. The concept is most useful for implementing feedback controls , particularly those generated by an application of Ross' pseudospectral optimal control theory. 3  Mathematical background  A Carathéodory-   π   π   \pi   solution addresses the fundamental problem of defining a solution to a differential equation,       x  ˙   =   g   (  x  ,  t  )         normal-˙  x     g   x  t      \dot{x}=g(x,t)   when g ( x , t ) is not differentiable with respect to x . Such problems arise quite naturally 4 in defining the meaning of a solution to a controlled differential equation,       x  ˙   =   f   (  x  ,  u  )         normal-˙  x     f   x  u      \dot{x}=f(x,u)   when the control, u , is given by a feedback law,      u  =   k   (  x  ,  t  )        u    k   x  t      u=k(x,t)   where the function k ( x , t ) may be non-smooth with respect to x . Non-smooth feedback controls arise quite often in the study of optimal feedback controls and have been the subject of extensive study going back to the 1960s. 5  Ross' concept  An ordinary differential equation,       x  ˙   =   g   (  x  ,  t  )         normal-˙  x     g   x  t      \dot{x}=g(x,t)   is equivalent to a controlled differential equation,       x  ˙   =  u       normal-˙  x   u    \dot{x}=u   with feedback control,    u  =   g   (  x  ,  t  )        u    g   x  t      u=g(x,t)   . Then, given an initial value problem, Ross partitions the time interval    [  0  ,  ∞  )     0     [0,\infty)   to a grid,    π  =    {   t  i   }    i  ≥  0        π   subscript    subscript  t  i      i  0      \pi=\{t_{i}\}_{i\geq 0}   with     t  i   →   ∞  as  i   →  ∞       normal-→   subscript  t  i      as  i     normal-→        t_{i}\to\infty\text{ as }i\to\infty   . From    t  0     subscript  t  0    t_{0}   to    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   , generate a control trajectory,        u   (  t  )    =   g   (   x  0   ,  t  )     ,     x   (   t  0   )    =   x  0    ,    t  0   ≤  t  ≤   t  1        formulae-sequence      u  t     g    subscript  x  0   t      formulae-sequence      x   subscript  t  0     subscript  x  0         subscript  t  0   t        subscript  t  1        u(t)=g(x_{0},t),\quad x(t_{0})=x_{0},\quad t_{0}\leq t\leq t_{1}   to the controlled differential equation,        x  ˙   =   u   (  t  )     ,    x   (   t  0   )    =   x  0       formulae-sequence     normal-˙  x     u  t        x   subscript  t  0     subscript  x  0      \dot{x}=u(t),\quad x(t_{0})=x_{0}   A Carathéodory solution exists for the above equation because    t  ↦  u     maps-to  t  u    t\mapsto u   has discontinuities at most in t , the independent variable. At    t  =   t  1       t   subscript  t  1     t=t_{1}   , set     x  1   =   x   (   t  1   )         subscript  x  1     x   subscript  t  1      x_{1}=x(t_{1})   and restart the system with     u   (  t  )    =   g   (   x  1   ,  t  )          u  t     g    subscript  x  1   t      u(t)=g(x_{1},t)   ,         x  ˙    (  t  )    =   u   (  t  )     ,     x   (   t  1   )    =   x  1    ,    t  1   ≤  t  ≤   t  2        formulae-sequence       normal-˙  x   t     u  t     formulae-sequence      x   subscript  t  1     superscript  x  1         subscript  t  1   t        subscript  t  2        \dot{x}(t)=u(t),\quad x(t_{1})=x^{1},\quad t_{1}\leq t\leq t_{2}   Continuing in this manner, the Carathéodory segments are stitched together to form a Carathéodory-   π   π   \pi   solution.  Engineering applications  A Carathéodory-   π   π   \pi   solution can be applied towards the practical stabilization of a control system. 6  7 It has been used to stabilize an inverted pendulum, 8 control and optimize the motion of robots, 9  10 slew and control the NPSAT1 spacecraft 11 and produce guidance commands for low-thrust space missions. 12  See also   Ross' π lemma   References  "  Category:Ordinary differential equations  Category:Optimal control     Biles, D.
