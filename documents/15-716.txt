Trace inequalities

In mathematics, there are many kinds of inequalities involving matrices and linear operators on Hilbert spaces. This article covers some important operator inequalities connected with traces of matrices.1234
Basic definitions
Let Hn denote the space of Hermitian

 
 ×
 
 
 
  matrices, Hn+ denote the set consisting of positive semi-definite

 
 ×
 
 
 
  Hermitian matrices and Hn++ denote the set of positive definite Hermitian matrices. For operators on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space we require that they be trace class and self-adjoint, in which case similar definitions apply, but we discuss only matrices, for simplicity.
For any real-valued function 
 
 
 
  on an interval 
 
 
 
  ⊂ ℝ, one may define a matrix function

 
  for any operator  with eigenvalues

 
  in 
 
 
 
  by defining it on the eigenvalues and corresponding projectors

 
  as


 
  given the spectral decomposition


Operator monotone
A function 
 
 
 
  defined on an interval 
 
 
 
  ⊂ ℝ is said to be operator monotone if ∀
 
 
 
 , and all  with eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
 , the following holds,


 
  where the inequality 
 
 
 
  means that the operator 
 
 
 
  is positive semi-definite. One may check A''2}} is, in fact, not monotone!
Operator convex
A function 
 
 
 
  is said to be operator convex if for all 
 
 
 
  and all  with eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , the following holds


 
  Note that the operator 
 
 
 
  has eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
 .
A function 
 
 
 
  is operator concave if 
 
 
 
  is operator convex, i.e. the inequality above for 
 
 
 
  is reversed.
Joint convexity
A function 
 
 
 
 , defined on intervals 
 
 
 
  is said to be ' jointly convex' if for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  with eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  with eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
 , and any 
 
 
 
  the following holds



A function 
 
 
 
  is jointly concave if −
 
 
 
  is jointly convex, i.e. the inequality above for 
 
 
 
  is reversed.
Trace function
Given a function 
 
 
 
 : ℝ → ℝ, the associated trace function on Hn is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  has eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  and Tr stands for a trace of the operator.
Convexity and monotonicity of the trace function
Let 
 
 
 
 : ℝ → ℝ be continuous, and let 
 
 
 
  be any integer. Then, if 
 
 
 
  is monotone increasing, so is 
 
 
 
  on Hn.
Likewise, if 
 
 
 
  is convex, so is 
 
 
 
  on Hn, and it is strictly convex if 
 
 
 
  is strictly convex.
See proof and discussion in,5 for example.
Löwner–Heinz theorem
For 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is operator monotone and operator concave.
For 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is operator monotone and operator concave.
For 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is operator convex. Furthermore,


 
  is operator concave and operator monotone, while


 
  is operator convex.
The original proof of this theorem is due to K. Löwner,6 who gave a necessary and sufficient condition for 
 
 
 
  to be operator monotone. An elementary proof of the theorem is discussed in 7 and a more general version of it in.8
Klein's inequality
For all Hermitian 
 
 
 
 ×
 
 
 
  matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and all differentiable convex functions

 
 : ℝ → ℝ with derivative

 
 , or for all positive-definite Hermitian 
 
 
 
 ×
 
 
 
  matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and all differentiable convex functions 
 
 
 
 :(0,∞) → ℝ, the following inequality holds,  In either case, if 
 
 
 
  is strictly convex, equality holds if and only if 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
 . A popular choice in applications is 
 
 
 
 , see below.
Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  so that, for 0 $t$ B + tC = (1 -t)B + tA. Define


 
  By convexity and monotonicity of trace functions, 
 
 
 
  is convex, and so for all 0 $t$  \phi(1) - \phi(0) \geq \frac{\phi(t) - \phi(0)}{t}, and, in fact, the right hand side is monotone decreasing in 
 
 
 
 . Taking the limit 
 
 
 
 →0 yields Klein's inequality.
Note that if 
 
 
 
  is strictly convex and 
 
 
 
 ≠ 0, then 
 
 
 
  is strictly convex. The final assertion follows from this and the fact that 
 
 
 
  is monotone decreasing in 
 
 
 
 .
Golden–Thompson inequality
In 1965, S. Golden 9 and C.J. Thompson 10 independently discovered that
For any matrices 
 
 
 
 ,



This inequality can be generalized for three operators:11 for non-negative operators 
 
 
 
 ,



Peierls–Bogoliubov inequality
Let 
 
 
 
  be such that Tr eR = 1. Defining  Tr '' FeR''}}, we have



The proof of this inequality follows from the above combined with Klein's inequality. Take 
 
 
 
 .12
Gibbs variational principle
Let 
 
 
 
  be a self-adjoint operator such that 
 
 
 
  is trace class. Then for any 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 



 
  with equality if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Lieb's concavity theorem
The following theorem was proved by E. H. Lieb in.13 It proves and generalizes a conjecture of E. P. Wigner, M. M. Yanase and F. J. Dyson.14 Six years later other proofs were given by T. Ando 15 and B. Simon,16 and several more have been given since then.
For all 
 
 
 
  matrices 
 
 
 
 , and all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  the real valued map on 
 
 
 
  given by




is jointly concave in 
 
 

is convex in 
 
 
 
 .

Here 
 
 
 
  stands for the adjoint operator of 
 
 

Lieb's theorem
For a fixed Hermitian matrix 
 
 
 
 , the function


 
  is concave on 
 
 
 
 .
The theorem and proof are due to E. H. Lieb,17 Thm 6, where he obtains this theorem as a corollary of Lieb's concavity Theorem. The most direct proof is due to H. Epstein;18 see M.B. Ruskai papers,1920 for a review of this argument.
Ando's convexity theorem
T. Ando's proof 21 of Lieb's concavity theorem led to the following significant complement to it:
For all 
 
 
 
  matrices 
 
 
 
 , and all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , the real valued map on 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  is convex.
Joint convexity of relative entropy
For two operators 
 
 
 
  define the following map



For density matrices

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
  is the Umegaki's quantum relative entropy.
Note that the non-negativity of 
 
 
 
  follows from Klein's inequality with 
 
 
 
 .
Statement
The map 
 
 
 
  is jointly convex.
Proof
For all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is jointly concave, by Lieb's concavity theorem, and thus


 
  is convex. But


 
  and convexity is preserved in the limit.
The proof is due to G. Lindblad.22
Jensen's operator and trace inequalities
The operator version of Jensen's inequality is due to C. Davis.23
A continuous, real function 
 
 
 
  on an interval 
 
 
 
  satisfies Jensen's Operator Inequality if the following holds


 
  for operators 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and for self-adjoint operators

 
  with spectrum on 
 
 
 
 .
See,2425 for the proof of the following two theorems.
Jensen's trace inequality
Let 
 
 
 
  be a continuous function defined on an interval 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be natural numbers. If 
 
 
 
  is convex, we then have the inequality


 
  for all (
 
 
1, ... , 
 
 
n) self-adjoint 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
  matrices with spectra contained in 
 
 
 
  and all (
 
 
1, ... , 
 
 
n) of 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
  matrices with


 
 .
Conversely, if the above inequality is satisfied for some 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  > 1, then 
 
 
 
  is convex.
Jensen's operator inequality
For a continuous function 
 
 
 
  defined on an interval 
 
 
 
  the following conditions are equivalent:



 
  is operator convex.
For each natural number 
 
 
 
  we have the inequality



 
  for all 
 
 
 
  bounded, self-adjoint operators on an arbitrary Hilbert space

 
  with spectra contained in 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .



 
  for each isometry 
 
 
 
  on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  and

every self-adjoint operator 
 
 
 
  with spectrum in 
 
 
 
 .



 
  for each projection 
 
 
 
  on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space 
 
 
 
 , every self-adjoint operator 
 
 
 
  with spectrum in 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .

Araki-Lieb-Thirring inequality
E. H. Lieb and W. E. Thirring proved the following inequality in 26 in 1976: For any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 




In 1990 27 H. Araki generalized the above inequality to the following one: For any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 



 
  for 
 
 
 
  and


 
  for 
 
 

Effros's theorem
E. Effros in 28 proved the following theorem.
If 
 
 
 
  is an operator convex function, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are commuting bounded linear operators, i.e. the commutator 
 
 
 
 , the perspective


 
  is jointly convex, i.e. if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  (i=1,2), 
 
 
 
 ,



Von Neumann's trace inequality
Von Neumann's trace inequality, named after its originator John von Neumann, states that for any n × n complex matrices A, B with singular values

 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively,29



The equality is achieved when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are simultaneously unitarily diagonalizable (see trace).
