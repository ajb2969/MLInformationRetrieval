   Pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase      Pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase   In enzymology , a pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + D-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and D-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (D-glutamate-forming) . Other names in common use include pyridoxamine phosphate aminotransferase , pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase , and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate transaminase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
