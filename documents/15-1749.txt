UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing)

UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing) (, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, GNE (gene), siaA (gene), neuC (gene)) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine hydrolase (2-epimerising).1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-acetyl-D-mannosamine + UDP
 

The enzyme is found in mammalian liver, as well as in some pathogenic bacteria including Neisseria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus.
