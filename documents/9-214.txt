   Outline of energy storage      Outline of energy storage   The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to energy storage:  Energy storage â€“ accomplished by devices or physical media that store some form of energy to perform some useful operation at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator .  Types of energy storage   Pumped-storage hydroelectricity  Superconducting magnetic energy storage  flow batteries  Conventional batteries ( e.g.  rechargeable electricity storage system )  Gas holder  Grid energy storage  Fuel cell and hydrogen technology  Gravitational mass  Capacitors ( e.g.  rechargeable electricity storage system )  Electromagnetic mass  Mainspring  Power to gas  Thermal energy storage  Solar chimney  Compressed fluids ( e.g.  compressed air )  flywheels  Vacuum storage (in rush generation technology)   History of energy storage   Main article: History of energy storage    General energy storage concepts  1. Using a high density magnetic field. Energy   E   E   E   in terms of magnetic field strength   B   B   B   is      E  =    1  2    B  2    =    1  2   L   i  2          E      1  2    superscript  B  2             1  2   L   superscript  i  2       E=\frac{1}{2}B^{2}=\frac{1}{2}Li^{2}     where   L   L   L   is the inductance of the electromagnet and   i   i   i   is the current.
