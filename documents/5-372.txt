   Knot complement      Knot complement   In mathematics , the knot complement of a tame knot  K is the three-dimensional space surrounding the knot. To make this precise, suppose that K is a knot in a three-manifold M (most often, M is the 3-sphere ). Let N be a tubular neighborhood of K ; so N is a solid torus . The knot complement is then the complement of N ,        X  K   =   M  -   interior   (  N  )      .       subscript  X  K     M    interior  N      X_{K}=M-\mbox{interior}(N).     The knot complement X K is a compact  3-manifold ; the boundary of X K and the boundary of the neighborhood N are homeomorphic to a two- torus . Sometimes the ambient manifold M is understood to be 3-sphere . Context is needed to determine the usage. There are analogous definitions of link complement .  Many knot invariants , such as the knot group , are really invariants of the complement of the knot. When the ambient space is the three-sphere no information is lost: the Gordon–Luecke theorem states that a knot is determined by its complement. That is, if K and K ′ are two knots with homeomorphic complements then there is a homeomorphism of the three-sphere taking one knot to the other.  See also   Seifert surface   Further reading   C.
