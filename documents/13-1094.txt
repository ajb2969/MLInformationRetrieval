Connection (algebraic framework)

Geometry of quantum systems (e.g., noncommutative geometry and supergeometry) is mainly phrased in algebraic terms of modules and algebras. Connections on modules are generalization of a linear connection on a smooth vector bundle

 
  written as a Koszul connection on the 
 
 
 
 -module of sections of 
 
 
 
 .1
Commutative algebra
Let 
 
 
 
  be a commutative ring and 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
 -module. There are different equivalent definitions of a connection on 
 
 
 
 .2 Let 
 
 
 
  be the module of derivations of a ring 
 
 
 
 . A connection on an 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is defined as an 
 
 
 
 -module morphism



such that the first order differential operators

 
  on 
 
 
 
  obey the Leibniz rule



Connections on a module over a commutative ring always exist.
The curvature of the connection 
 
 
 
  is defined as the zero-order differential operator



on the module 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a vector bundle, there is one-to-one correspondence between linear connections

 
  on 
 
 
 
  and the connections 
 
 
 
  on the 
 
 
 
 -module of sections of 
 
 
 
 . Strictly speaking, 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the covariant differential of a connection on 
 
 
 
 .
Graded commutative algebra
The notion of a connection on modules over commutative rings is straightforwardly extended to modules over a graded commutative algebra.3 This is the case of superconnections in supergeometry of graded manifolds and supervector bundles. Superconnections always exist.
Noncommutative algebra
If 
 
 
 
  is a noncommutative ring, connections on left and right 
 
 
 
 
 -modules are defined similarly to those on modules over commutative rings.4 However these connections need not exist.
In contrast with connections on left and right modules, there is a problem how to define a connection on an 
 
 
 
 -bimodule over noncommutative rings 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . There are different definitions of such a connection.5 Let us mention one of them. A connection on an 
 
 
 
 -bimodule 
 
 
 
 
  is defined as a bimodule morphism



which obeys the Leibniz rule
