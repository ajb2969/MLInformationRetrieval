   Connection (algebraic framework)      Connection (algebraic framework)   Geometry of quantum systems (e.g., noncommutative geometry and supergeometry ) is mainly phrased in algebraic terms of modules and algebras . Connections on modules are generalization of a linear connection on a smooth vector bundle     E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   written as a Koszul connection on the     C  ∞    (  X  )        superscript  C    X    C^{\infty}(X)   -module of sections of    E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   . 1  Commutative algebra  Let   A   A   A   be a commutative ring and   P   P   P   a   A   A   A   - module . There are different equivalent definitions of a connection on   P   P   P   . 2 Let    D   (  A  )       D  A    D(A)   be the module of derivations of a ring   A   A   A   . A connection on an   A   A   A   -module   P   P   P   is defined as an   A   A   A   -module morphism      ∇  :    D   (  A  )    ∋  u  →   ∇  u   ∈    Diff  1    (  P  ,  P  )        normal-:  normal-∇     contains    D  A   u    normal-→     subscript  normal-∇  u           subscript  Diff  1    P  P        \nabla:D(A)\ni u\to\nabla_{u}\in\mathrm{Diff}_{1}(P,P)     such that the first order differential operators     ∇  u     subscript  normal-∇  u    \nabla_{u}   on   P   P   P   obey the Leibniz rule          ∇  u    (   a  p   )    =    u   (  a  )   p   +   a    ∇  u    (  p  )       ,    a  ∈  A   ,   p  ∈  P     .     formulae-sequence      subscript  normal-∇  u     a  p        u  a  p     a    subscript  normal-∇  u   p       formulae-sequence    a  A     p  P      \nabla_{u}(ap)=u(a)p+a\nabla_{u}(p),\quad a\in A,\quad p\in P.     Connections on a module over a commutative ring always exist.  The curvature of the connection   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is defined as the zero-order differential operator       R   (  u  ,   u  ′   )    =    [   ∇  u   ,   ∇   u  ′    ]   -    ∇   [  u  ,   u  ′   ]            R   u   superscript  u  normal-′         subscript  normal-∇  u    subscript  normal-∇   superscript  u  normal-′      subscript  normal-∇   u   superscript  u  normal-′        R(u,u^{\prime})=[\nabla_{u},\nabla_{u^{\prime}}]-\nabla_{[u,u^{\prime}]}\,     on the module   P   P   P   for all     u  ,   u  ′    ∈   D   (  A  )         u   superscript  u  normal-′      D  A     u,u^{\prime}\in D(A)   .  If    E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   is a vector bundle, there is one-to-one correspondence between linear connections    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   on    E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   and the connections   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   on the     C  ∞    (  X  )        superscript  C    X    C^{\infty}(X)   -module of sections of    E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   . Strictly speaking,   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   corresponds to the covariant differential of a connection on    E  →  X     normal-→  E  X    E\to X   .  Graded commutative algebra  The notion of a connection on modules over commutative rings is straightforwardly extended to modules over a graded commutative algebra . 3 This is the case of superconnections in supergeometry of graded manifolds and supervector bundles . Superconnections always exist.  Noncommutative algebra  If   A   A   A   is a noncommutative ring, connections on left and right   A   A   A   -modules are defined similarly to those on modules over commutative rings. 4 However these connections need not exist.  In contrast with connections on left and right modules, there is a problem how to define a connection on an    R  -  S      R  S    R-S   - bimodule over noncommutative rings   R   R   R   and   S   S   S   . There are different definitions of such a connection. 5 Let us mention one of them. A connection on an    R  -  S      R  S    R-S   -bimodule   P   P   P   is defined as a bimodule morphism      ∇  :    D   (  A  )    ∋  u  →   ∇  u   ∈    Diff  1    (  P  ,  P  )        normal-:  normal-∇     contains    D  A   u    normal-→     subscript  normal-∇  u           subscript  Diff  1    P  P        \nabla:D(A)\ni u\to\nabla_{u}\in\mathrm{Diff}_{1}(P,P)     which obeys the Leibniz rule          ∇  u    (   a  p  b   )    =    u   (  a  )   p  b   +   a     ∇  u    (  p  )    b    +   a  p  u   (  b  )      ,    a  ∈  R   ,    b  ∈  S   ,   p  ∈  P      .     formulae-sequence      subscript  normal-∇  u     a  p  b        u  a  p  b     a     subscript  normal-∇  u   p   b      a  p  u  b      formulae-sequence    a  R    formulae-sequence    b  S     p  P       \nabla_{u}(apb)=u(a)pb+a\nabla_{u}(p)b+apu(b),\quad a\in R,\quad b\in S,\quad p%
