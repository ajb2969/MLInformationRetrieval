   Exergonic process      Exergonic process   An exergonic process is one in which there is a positive flow of energy from the system to the surroundings. This is in contrast with an endergonic process. 1 Constant pressure, constant temperature reactions are exergonic if and only if the Gibbs free energy change is negative (∆G     Δ  G   =    Δ  H   -    T  ⋅  Δ   S          normal-Δ  G       normal-Δ  H      normal-⋅  T  normal-Δ   S      \Delta G=\Delta H-T\cdot\Delta S     where: T = Temperature in Kelvin (K) ΔG = Change in the Gibbs free energy ΔS = Change in entropy (at 298 K) as ΔS = Σ{S( Product (chemistry) )} - Σ{S( Reagent )} ΔH = Change in enthalpy (at 298 K) as ΔH = Σ{H(Product (chemistry))} - Σ{H(Reagent)} A chemical reaction progresses only spontaneously when the Gibbs free energy decreases, in that case the ΔG is negative. In exergonic reactions the ΔG is negative and in endergonic reactions the ΔG is positive:        Δ  R   G   <  0         subscript  normal-Δ  normal-R   G   0    \mathrm{\Delta}_{\mathrm{R}}G<0   exergon       Δ  R   G   >  0         subscript  normal-Δ  normal-R   G   0    \mathrm{\Delta}_{\mathrm{R}}G>0   endergon  where:      Δ  R   G       subscript  normal-Δ  normal-R   G    \mathrm{\Delta}_{\mathrm{R}}G   equals the change in the Gibbs free energy after completion of a chemical reaction.
