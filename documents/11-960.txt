   Phenylalanine N-acetyltransferase      Phenylalanine N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a phenylalanine N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + L-phenylalanine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and L-phenylalanine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:L-phenylalanine N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme is also called acetyl-CoA-L-phenylalanine alpha-N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
