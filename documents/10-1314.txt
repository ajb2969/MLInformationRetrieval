In enzymology, a pyridoxal oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

pyridoxal + H2O + O2

 
  4-pyridoxate + (?)
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxal, H2O, and O2, whereas its product is 4-pyridoxate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor.
