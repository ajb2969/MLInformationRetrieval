   Pyridoxal oxidase      Pyridoxal oxidase   In enzymology , a pyridoxal oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyridoxal + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-pyridoxate + (?)   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxal , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its product is 4-pyridoxate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxal:oxygen 4-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism . It employs one cofactor , molybdenum .
