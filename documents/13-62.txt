   Indistinguishability quotient      Indistinguishability quotient   The Sprague-Grundy theory of normal-play impartial combinatorial games generalizes to misere play via a local construction known as the indistinguishability quotient.  Suppose   A   A   A   is a set of impartial combinatorial games that is closed in both of the following senses:  (1) Additive closure : If   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   are games in   A   A   A   , then their disjunctive sum    G  +  H      G  H    G+H   is also in   A   A   A   .  (2) Hereditary closure : If   G   G   G   is a game in   A   A   A   and   H   H   H   is an option of   G   G   G   , then   H   H   H   is also in   A   A   A   .  Next, define on   A   A   A   the indistinguishability congruence ≈ that relates two games   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   if for every choice of a game   X   X   X   in   A   A   A   , the two positions    G  +  X      G  X    G+X   and    H  +  X      H  X    H+X   have the same outcome (i.e., are either both first-player wins in best play of   A   A   A   , or alternatively are both second-player wins).  One easily checks that ≈ is indeed a congruence on the set of all disjunctive position sums in   A   A   A   , and that this is true regardless of whether the game is played in normal or misere play. The totality of all the congruence classes form the indistinguishability quotient .  If   A   A   A   is played as a normal-play (last-playing winning) impartial game, then the congruence classes of   A   A   A   are in one-to-one correspondence with the nim values that occur in the play of the game (themselves determined by the Sprague-Grundy theorem ).  In misere play, the congruence classes form a Monoid#Commutative monoid , instead, and it has become known as a misere quotient.
