Indistinguishability quotient

The Sprague-Grundy theory of normal-play impartial combinatorial games generalizes to misere play via a local construction known as the indistinguishability quotient.
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a set of impartial combinatorial games that is closed in both of the following senses:
(1) Additive closure: If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are games in 
 
 
 
 , then their disjunctive sum 
 
 
 
  is also in 
 
 
 
 .
(2) Hereditary closure: If 
 
 
 
  is a game in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an option of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is also in 
 
 
 
 .
Next, define on 
 
 
 
  the indistinguishability congruence ≈ that relates two games 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if for every choice of a game 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , the two positions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have the same outcome (i.e., are either both first-player wins in best play of 
 
 
 
 , or alternatively are both second-player wins).
One easily checks that ≈ is indeed a congruence on the set of all disjunctive position sums in 
 
 
 
 , and that this is true regardless of whether the game is played in normal or misere play. The totality of all the congruence classes form the indistinguishability quotient.
If 
 
 
 
  is played as a normal-play (last-playing winning) impartial game, then the congruence classes of 
 
 
 
  are in one-to-one correspondence with the nim values that occur in the play of the game (themselves determined by the Sprague-Grundy theorem).
In misere play, the congruence classes form a Monoid#Commutative monoid, instead, and it has become known as a misere quotient.
