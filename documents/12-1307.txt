   Meixner polynomials      Meixner polynomials   In mathematics, Meixner polynomials (also called discrete Laguerre polynomials ) are a family of discrete orthogonal polynomials introduced by . They are given in terms of binomial coefficients and the (rising) Pochhammer symbol by        M  n    (  x  ,  β  ,  γ  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n      (   -  1   )   k    (     n      k     )    (     x      k     )    k  !
