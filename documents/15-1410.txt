Beta-ketodecanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase

Beta-ketodecanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase () is an enzyme with system name octanoyl-CoA:malonyl-(acyl-carrier protein) C-heptanoylltransferase (decarboxylating, CoA-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

octanoyl-CoA + malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] 
 
 
 
  3-oxodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + CoA + CO2


This enzyme is purified from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
