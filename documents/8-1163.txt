132 |} In seven-dimensional geometry, a 7-polytope is a polytope contained by 6-polytope facets. Each 5-polytope ridge being shared by exactly two 6-polytope facets.
A uniform 7-polytope is one which is vertex-transitive, and constructed from uniform 6-polytope facets.
Regular 7-polytopes
Regular 7-polytopes are represented by the Schläfli symbol {p,q,r,s,t,u} with u {p,q,r,s,t} 6-polytopes facets around each 4-face.
There are exactly three such convex regular 7-polytopes:

{3,3,3,3,3,3} - 7-simplex
{4,3,3,3,3,3} - 7-cube
{3,3,3,3,3,4} - 7-orthoplex

There are no nonconvex regular 7-polytopes.
Characteristics
The topology of any given 7-polytope is defined by its Betti numbers and torsion coefficients.1
The value of the Euler characteristic used to characterise polyhedra does not generalize usefully to higher dimensions, whatever their underlying topology. This inadequacy of the Euler characteristic to reliably distinguish between different topologies in higher dimensions led to the discovery of the more sophisticated Betti numbers.2
Similarly, the notion of orientability of a polyhedron is insufficient to characterise the surface twistings of toroidal polytopes, and this led to the use of torsion coefficients.3
Uniform 7-polytopes by fundamental Coxeter groups
Uniform 7-polytopes with reflective symmetry can be generated by these four Coxeter groups, represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams:

The D7 family
The D7 family has symmetry of order 322560 (7 factorial x 26).
This family has 3×32−1=95 Wythoffian uniform polytopes, generated by marking one or more nodes of the D7 Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Of these, 63 (2×32−1) are repeated from the B7 family and 32 are unique to this family, listed below. Bowers names and acronym are given for cross-referencing.
See also list of D7 polytopes for Coxeter plane graphs of these polytopes.

Regular and uniform honeycombs
 There are five fundamental affine Coxeter groups and sixteen prismatic groups that generate regular and uniform tessellations in 6-space:

Regular and uniform hyperbolic honeycombs
There are no compact hyperbolic Coxeter groups of rank 7, groups that can generate honeycombs with all finite facets, and a finite vertex figure. However there are 3 noncompact hyperbolic Coxeter groups of rank 7, each generating uniform honeycombs in 6-space as permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams.

Notes on the Wythoff construction for the uniform 7-polytopes
The reflective 7-dimensional uniform polytopes are constructed through a Wythoff construction process, and represented by a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, where each node represents a mirror. An active mirror is represented by a ringed node. Each combination of active mirrors generates a unique uniform polytope. Uniform polytopes are named in relation to the regular polytopes in each family. Some families have two regular constructors and thus may be named in two equally valid ways.
Here are the primary operators available for constructing and naming the uniform 7-polytopes.
The prismatic forms and bifurcating graphs can use the same truncation indexing notation, but require an explicit numbering system on the nodes for clarity.

Description





Parent

t0{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Any regular 7-polytope



Rectified

t1{p,q,r,s,t,u}


The edges are fully truncated into single points. The 7-polytope now has the combined faces of the parent and dual.



Birectified

t2{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Birectification reduces cells to their duals.



Truncated

t0,1{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Each original vertex is cut off, with a new face filling the gap. Truncation has a degree of freedom, which has one solution that creates a uniform truncated 7-polytope. The 7-polytope has its original faces doubled in sides, and contains the faces of the dual.




Bitruncated

t1,2{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Bitrunction transforms cells to their dual truncation.



Tritruncated

t2,3{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Tritruncation transforms 4-faces to their dual truncation.



Cantellated

t0,2{p,q,r,s,t,u}


In addition to vertex truncation, each original edge is beveled with new rectangular faces appearing in their place. A uniform cantellation is half way between both the parent and dual forms.




Bicantellated

t1,3{p,q,r,s,t,u}


In addition to vertex truncation, each original edge is beveled with new rectangular faces appearing in their place. A uniform cantellation is half way between both the parent and dual forms.



Runcinated

t0,3{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Runcination reduces cells and creates new cells at the vertices and edges.



Biruncinated

t1,4{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Runcination reduces cells and creates new cells at the vertices and edges.



Stericated

t0,4{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Sterication reduces 4-faces and creates new 4-faces at the vertices, edges, and faces in the gaps.



Pentellated

t0,5{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Pentellation reduces 5-faces and creates new 5-faces at the vertices, edges, faces, and cells in the gaps.



Hexicated

t0,6{p,q,r,s,t,u}


Hexication reduces 6-faces and creates new 6-faces at the vertices, edges, faces, cells, and 4-faces in the gaps. (expansion operation for 7-polytopes)



Omnitruncated

t0,1,2,3,4,5,6{p,q,r,s,t,u}


All six operators, truncation, cantellation, runcination, sterication, pentellation, and hexication are applied.
