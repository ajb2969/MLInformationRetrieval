Bullough–Dodd model

The Bullough–Dodd model is an integrable model in 1+1-dimensional quantum field theory introduced by Robin Bullough and Roger Dodd. Its Lagrangian density is



where 
 
 
 
  is a mass parameter, 
 
 
 
  is the coupling constant and 
 
 
 
  is a real scalar field.
The Bullough–Dodd model belongs to the class of Affine Toda Field Theories.
The spectrum of the model consists of a single massive particle.
