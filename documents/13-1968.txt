   Maker-Breaker game      Maker-Breaker game   In combinatorial game theory , Maker-Breaker games are a subclass of positional games . 1  2  It is a two-person game with complete information played on a hypergraph  (V,H) where V is an arbitrary set (called the board of the game) and H is a family of subsets of V , called the winning sets . The two players alternately occupy previously unoccupied elements of V .  The ﬁrst player, Maker , has to occupy a winning set to win; and the second player, Breaker , has to stop Maker from doing so; if Breaker successfully prevents maker from occupying a winning set to the end of the game, then Breaker wins. Thus, in a Maker–Breaker positional game, Maker wins if he occupies all elements of some winning set and Breaker wins if he prevents Maker from doing so. There can be no draw in a Maker-Breaker positional game: one player always wins.  The definition of Maker-Breaker game has a subtlety when     |  V  |   =  ∞        V      |V|=\infty   and     |  H  |   =  ∞        H      |H|=\infty   . In this case we say that Breaker has a winning strategy if, for all j > 0, Breaker can prevent Maker from completely occupying a winning set by turn j .  When tictactoe is played as a Maker–Breaker positional game, Maker has a winning strategy (Maker does not need to block Breaker from obtaining a winning line) . 3  Maker-Breaker games on graphs  There has been quite some research done on playing Maker-Breaker games when the board of the game is the edge-set of a graph     G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   (usually taken as the complete graph) and the family of winning sets is    ℱ  =   {   F  ⊂  E   |   G   [  F  ]   has property  𝒫   }       ℱ   conditional-set    F  E     G   delimited-[]  F   has property  𝒫      \mathcal{F}=\{F\subset E|G[F]\hbox{ has property }\mathcal{P}\}   , where   𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   is some graph property (usually taken to be monotone increasing) such as connectivity (see, e.g., 4 ).
