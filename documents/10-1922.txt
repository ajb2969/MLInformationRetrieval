   3-hydroxyaspartate aldolase      3-hydroxyaspartate aldolase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxyaspartate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycine + glyoxylate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate , and two products , glycine and glyoxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate glyoxylate-lyase (glycine-forming) . Other names in common use include erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartate aldolase , erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartate glycine-lyase , and erythro-3-hydroxy-Ls-aspartate glyoxylate-lyase .
