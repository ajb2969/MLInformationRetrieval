   Versor (physics)      Versor (physics)     In geometry and physics , the versor of an axis or of a vector is a unit vector indicating its direction .  The versor of a Cartesian axis is also known as a standard basis vector . The versor of a vector is also known as a normalized vector .  Versors of a Cartesian coordinate system  The versors of the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system are the unit vectors codirectional with the axes of that system. Every Euclidean vector  a in a n -dimensional Euclidean space ( ) can be represented as a linear combination of the n versors of the corresponding Cartesian coordinate system. For instance, in a three-dimensional space (   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}    3 ), there are three versors:       𝐢  =   (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )    ,      𝐢   1  0  0     \mathbf{i}=(1,0,0),          𝐣  =   (  0  ,  1  ,  0  )    ,      𝐣   0  1  0     \mathbf{j}=(0,1,0),          𝐤  =   (  0  ,  0  ,  1  )    .      𝐤   0  0  1     \mathbf{k}=(0,0,1).     They indicate the direction of the Cartesian axes x , y , and z , respectively. In terms of these, any vector a can be represented as       𝐚  =    𝐚  x   +   𝐚  y   +   𝐚  z    =     a  x   𝐢   +    a  y   𝐣   +    a  z   𝐤     ,        𝐚     subscript  𝐚  x    subscript  𝐚  y    subscript  𝐚  z              subscript  a  x   𝐢      subscript  a  y   𝐣      subscript  a  z   𝐤       \mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}_{x}+\mathbf{a}_{y}+\mathbf{a}_{z}=a_{x}\mathbf{i}+a_{y}%
 \mathbf{j}+a_{z}\mathbf{k},     where a x , a y , a z are called the vector components (or vector projections) of a on the Cartesian axes x , y , and z (see figure), while a x , a y , a z are the respective scalar components (or scalar projections).  In linear algebra , the set formed by these n versors is typically referred to as the standard basis of the corresponding Euclidean space , and each of them is commonly called a standard basis vector .  Notation  A hat above the symbol of a versor is sometimes used to emphasize its status as a unit vector (e.g.,    ı  ^     normal-^  double-struck-ı    \hat{\mathbb{\imath}}   ).  In most contexts it can be assumed that i , j , and k , (or     ı  →   ,     normal-→  ı    \vec{\imath},        ȷ  →   ,     normal-→  ȷ    \vec{\jmath},   and    k  →     normal-→  k    \vec{k}   ) are versors of a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system. The notations    (   𝕩  ^   ,   𝕪  ^   ,   𝕫  ^   )      normal-^  𝕩    normal-^  𝕪    normal-^  𝕫     (\hat{\mathbb{x}},\hat{\mathbb{y}},\hat{\mathbb{z}})   ,    (    𝕩  ^   1   ,    𝕩  ^   2   ,    𝕩  ^   3   )      subscript   normal-^  𝕩   1    subscript   normal-^  𝕩   2    subscript   normal-^  𝕩   3     (\hat{\mathbb{x}}_{1},\hat{\mathbb{x}}_{2},\hat{\mathbb{x}}_{3})   ,    (    𝕖  ^   x   ,    𝕖  ^   y   ,    𝕖  ^   z   )      subscript   normal-^  𝕖   x    subscript   normal-^  𝕖   y    subscript   normal-^  𝕖   z     (\hat{\mathbb{e}}_{x},\hat{\mathbb{e}}_{y},\hat{\mathbb{e}}_{z})   , or    (    𝕖  ^   1   ,    𝕖  ^   2   ,    𝕖  ^   3   )      subscript   normal-^  𝕖   1    subscript   normal-^  𝕖   2    subscript   normal-^  𝕖   3     (\hat{\mathbb{e}}_{1},\hat{\mathbb{e}}_{2},\hat{\mathbb{e}}_{3})   , with or without hat , are also used, particularly in contexts where i , j , k might lead to confusion with another quantity. This is recommended, for instance, when index symbols such as i , j , k are used to identify an element of a set of variables.  Versor of a non-zero vector  The versor (or normalized vector )    𝐮  ^     normal-^  𝐮    \hat{\mathbf{u}}   of a non-zero vector   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is the unit vector codirectional with   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   :        𝐮  ^   =   𝐮   ∥  𝐮  ∥     .       normal-^  𝐮     𝐮   norm  𝐮      \hat{\mathbf{u}}=\frac{\mathbf{u}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|}.     where    ∥  𝐮  ∥     norm  𝐮    \|\mathbf{u}\|   is the norm (or length) of   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   .
