The Wolf number (also known as the International sunspot number, relative sunspot number, or ZÃ¼rich number) is a quantity that measures the number of sunspots and groups of sunspots present on the surface of the sun.
The idea of computing sunspot numbers was originated by Rudolf Wolf in 18481 in Zurich, Switzerland and, thus, the procedure he initiated bears his name (or place). The combination of sunspots and their grouping is used because it compensates for variations in observing small sunspots.
This number has been collected and tabulated by researchers for over 150 years. They have found that sunspot activity is cyclical and reaches its maximum around every 9.5 to 11 years (note: Using data from SIDC for the last 300 years and running a FFT function on the data gives an average maximum at 10.4883 years/cycle).2 This cycle was first noted by Heinrich Schwabe in 1843.
The relative sunspot number 
 
 
 
  is computed using the formula (collected as a daily index of sunspot activity):



where



 
  is the number of individual spots,


 
  is the number of sunspot groups, and


 
  is a factor that varies with location and instrumentation (also known as the observatory factor or the personal reduction coefficient

 
 ).3

Since 1 July 2015 a revised and updated list of the (Wolf) sunspot numbers has been made available.4
