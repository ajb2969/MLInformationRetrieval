   Thomson (unit)      Thomson (unit)   The thomson (symbol: Th ) is a unit that has appeared infrequently in scientific literature relating to the field of mass spectrometry as a unit of mass-to-charge ratio . The unit was proposed by Cooks and Rockwood 1 naming it in honour of J. J. Thomson who measured the mass-to-charge ratio of electrons and ions.  Definition  The thomson is defined as 2        1   Th   =    1    u  e    =    1    Da  e    =    1.036426  ×    10   -  8       kg    C   -  1             1  Th     1    normal-u  e           1    Da  e             1.036426   superscript  10    8     kg   superscript  normal-C    1        1~{}\mathrm{Th}=1~{}\frac{\mathrm{u}}{e}=1~{}\frac{\mathrm{Da}}{e}=1.036426%
 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{kg\,C^{-1}}     where u represents the unified atomic mass unit , Da represents the unit dalton, and e represents the elementary charge which is the electric charge  unit in the atomic unit system.  For example, the ion C 7 H 7 2+ has a mass of 91 Da. Its charge number is +2, and hence its charge is 2 e . The ion will be observed at 45.5 Th in a mass spectrum.  The thomson allows for negative values for negatively charged ions. For example, the benzoate anion would be observed not at m/z 121, but at −121 Th since the charge is −e.  Use  The thomson has been used by some mass spectrometrists, for example Alexander Makarov —the inventor of the Orbitrap —in a scientific poster, 3 papers, 4 5 and (notably) one book. 6 The journal Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry (in which the original article appeared) states that "the Thomson (Th) may be used for such purposes as a unit of mass-to-charge ratio although it is not currently approved by IUPAP or IUPAC." 7 Even so, the term has been called "controversial" by RCM's former Editor-in Chief 8 (in a review the Hoffman text cited above 9 ). The book, Mass Spectrometry Desk Reference , argues against the use of the thomson. 10 However, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan has written an editorial in support of the thomson unit. 11  The thomson is not an SI unit , nor has it been defined by IUPAC .
