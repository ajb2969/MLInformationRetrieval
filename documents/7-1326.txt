   Holland's schema theorem      Holland's schema theorem   Holland's schema theorem , also called the fundamental theorem of genetic algorithms , 1 is widely taken to be the foundation for explanations of the power of genetic algorithms . It says that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in successive generations. The theorem was proposed by John Holland in the 1970s.  A schema is a template that identifies a subset of strings with similarities at certain string positions. Schemata are a special case of cylinder sets ; and so form a topological space .  Description  For example, consider binary strings of length 6. The schema 1*10*1 describes the set of all strings of length 6 with 1's at positions 1, 3 and 6 and a 0 at position 4. The * is a wildcard symbol, which means that positions 2 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0. The order of a schema     o   (  H  )       o  H    o(H)   is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template, while the defining length     δ   (  H  )       δ  H    \delta(H)   is the distance between the first and last specific positions. The order of 1*10*1 is 4 and its defining length is 5. The fitness of a schema is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema. The fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution, as computed by a problem-specific evaluation function. Using the established methods and genetic operators of genetic algorithms , the schema theorem states that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in successive generations. Expressed as an equation:        E   (   m   (  H  ,   t  +  1   )    )    ≥     m   (  H  ,  t  )   f   (  H  )     a  t     [   1  -  p   ]     .       normal-E    m   H    t  1            m   H  t   f  H    subscript  a  t     delimited-[]    1  p       \operatorname{E}(m(H,t+1))\geq{m(H,t)f(H)\over a_{t}}[1-p].     Here    m   (  H  ,  t  )       m   H  t     m(H,t)   is the number of strings belonging to schema   H   H   H   at generation   t   t   t   ,    f   (  H  )       f  H    f(H)   is the observed average fitness of schema   H   H   H   and    a  t     subscript  a  t    a_{t}   is the observed average fitness at generation   t   t   t   . The probability of disruption   p   p   p   is the probability that crossover or mutation will destroy the schema   H   H   H   . It can be expressed as:      p  =      δ   (  H  )     l  -  1     p  c    +   o   (  H  )    p  m         p          δ  H     l  1     subscript  p  c      o  H   subscript  p  m       p={\delta(H)\over l-1}p_{c}+o(H)p_{m}     where    o   (  H  )       o  H    o(H)   is the order of the schema,   l   l   l   is the length of the code,    p  m     subscript  p  m    p_{m}   is the probability of mutation and    p  c     subscript  p  c    p_{c}   is the probability of crossover. So a schema with a shorter defining length    δ   (  H  )       δ  H    \delta(H)   is less likely to be disrupted. An often misunderstood point is why the Schema Theorem is an inequality rather than an equality. The answer is in fact simple: the Theorem neglects the small, yet non-zero, probability that a string belonging to the schema   H   H   H   will be created "from scratch" by mutation of a single string (or recombination of two strings) that did not belong to   H   H   H   in the previous generation.  Limitation  The schema theorem holds under the assumption of a genetic algorithm that maintains an infinitely large population, but does not always carry over to (finite) practice: due to sampling error in the initial population, genetic algorithms may converge on schemata that have no selective advantage. This happens in particular in multimodal optimization , where a function can have multiple peaks: the population may drift to prefer one of the peaks, ignoring the others. 2  References   J.
