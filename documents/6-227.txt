   Burgers material      Burgers material   A Burgers material is a viscoelastic material which consists of a Maxwell material and a Kelvin material in series. It is named after the Dutch physicist Johannes Martinus Burgers .  Given four rheological constants    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   ,    a  2     subscript  a  2    a_{2}   ,    a  3     subscript  a  3    a_{3}   , and    a  4     subscript  a  4    a_{4}   , the Burgers model has the constitutive equation       σ  +    a  1    σ  ˙    +    a  2    σ  ¨     =     a  3   γ   +    a  4    γ  ˙           σ     subscript  a  1    normal-˙  σ       subscript  a  2    normal-¨  σ          subscript  a  3   γ      subscript  a  4    normal-˙  γ       \sigma+a_{1}\dot{\sigma}+a_{2}\ddot{\sigma}=a_{3}\gamma+a_{4}\dot{\gamma}   where   σ   σ   \sigma   is the stress and   γ   γ   \gamma   is the rate of deformation. 1  See also   Generalized Maxwell model  Standard linear solid model   References  External links   Creep and Stress Relaxation for Four-Element Viscoelastic Solids and Liquids , Wolfram Demonstrations Project   "  Category:Non-Newtonian fluids     ↩
