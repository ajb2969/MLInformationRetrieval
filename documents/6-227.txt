Burgers material

A Burgers material is a viscoelastic material which consists of a Maxwell material and a Kelvin material in series. It is named after the Dutch physicist Johannes Martinus Burgers.
Given four rheological constants 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , the Burgers model has the constitutive equation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the stress and 
 
 
 
  is the rate of deformation.1
