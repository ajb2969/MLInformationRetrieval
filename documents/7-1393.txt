   Abrikosov vortex      Abrikosov vortex  In superconducti vity, an Abrikosov vortex is a vortex of supercurrent in a type-II superconductor theoretically predicted by Alexei Abrikosov in 1957. 1 The supercurrent circulates around the normal (i.e. non-superconducting) core of the vortex. The core has a size     ∼  ξ     similar-to  absent  ξ    \sim\xi   — the superconducting coherence length (parameter of a Ginzburg-Landau theory ). The supercurrents decay on the distance about   λ   λ   \lambda   ( London penetration depth ) from the core. Note that in type-II superconductors     λ  >  ξ      λ  ξ    \lambda>\xi   . The circulating supercurrents induce magnetic fields with the total flux equal to a single flux quantum     Φ  0     subscript  normal-Φ  0    \Phi_{0}   . Therefore, an Abrikosov vortex is often called a fluxon .  The magnetic field distribution of a single vortex far from its core can be described by         B   (  r  )    =     Φ  0    2  π   λ  2      K  0    (   r  λ   )    ≈     λ  r     exp   (   -   r  λ    )      ,          B  r        subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π   superscript  λ  2      subscript  K  0     r  λ               λ  r          r  λ         B(r)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\lambda^{2}}K_{0}\left(\frac{r}{\lambda}\right)%
 \approx\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{r}}\exp\left(-\frac{r}{\lambda}\right),      where     K  0    (  z  )        subscript  K  0   z    K_{0}(z)   is a zeroth-order Bessel function . Note that, according to the above formula, at    r  →  0     normal-→  r  0    r\to 0   the magnetic field     B   (  r  )    ∝   ln   (   λ  /  r   )       proportional-to    B  r       λ  r      B(r)\propto\ln(\lambda/r)   , i.e. logarithmically diverges. In reality, for    r  ≲  ξ     less-than-or-similar-to  r  ξ    r\lesssim\xi   the field is simply given by         B   (  0  )    ≈     Φ  0    2  π   λ  2      ln  κ     ,        B  0        subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π   superscript  λ  2       κ      B(0)\approx\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\lambda^{2}}\ln\kappa,      where κ = λ/ξ is known as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, which must be    κ  >   1  /   2        κ    1    2      \kappa>1/\sqrt{2}   in type-II superconductors .  Abrikosov vortices can be trapped in a type-II superconductor by chance, on defects, etc. Even if initially type-II superconductor contains no vortices, and one applies a magnetic field   H   H   H   larger than the lower critical field     H   c  1      subscript  H    c  1     H_{c1}   (but smaller than the upper critical field     H   c  2      subscript  H    c  2     H_{c2}   ), the field penetrates into superconductor in terms of Abrikosov vortices . Each vortex carries one thread of magnetic field with the flux    Φ  0     subscript  normal-Φ  0    \Phi_{0}   . Abrikosov vortices form a lattice, usually triangular, with the average vortex density (flux density) approximately equal to the externally applied magnetic field. As with other lattices, defects may form as dislocations.
