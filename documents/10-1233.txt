(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase




(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase

In enzymology, a (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-2-hydroxy acid + O2

 
  2-oxo acid + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-hydroxy acid and O2, whereas its two products are 2-oxo acid and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-hydroxy-acid:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include glycolate oxidase, hydroxy-acid oxidase A, hydroxy-acid oxidase B, glycolate oxidase, oxidase, L-2-hydroxy acid, hydroxyacid oxidase A, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FMN.
