   Triangle wave      Triangle wave     A triangle wave is a non-sinusoidal waveform named for its triangular shape. It is a periodic , piecewise linear , continuous  real function .  Like a square wave , the triangle wave contains only odd harmonics , due to its odd symmetry . However, the higher harmonics roll off much faster than in a square wave (proportional to the inverse square of the harmonic number as opposed to just the inverse).  Harmonics  (Figure)  Animation of the additive synthesis of a triangle wave with an increasing number of harmonics. See Fourier Analysis for a mathematical description.   It is possible to approximate a triangle wave with additive synthesis by adding odd harmonics of the fundamental, multiplying every (4n−1)th harmonic by −1 (or changing its phase by π), and rolling off the harmonics by the inverse square of their relative frequency to the fundamental .  This infinite Fourier series converges to the triangle wave with cycle frequency   f   f   f   over time   t   t   t   :       x  triangle    (  t  )        subscript  x  triangle   t    \displaystyle x_{\mathrm{triangle}}(t)     Definitions  (Figure)  Sine , square , triangle, and sawtooth waveforms   Another definition of the triangle wave, with range from -1 to 1 and period 2 a is:      x   (  t  )   =   2  a    (  t  -  a   ⌊   t  a   +   1  2   ⌋   )     (  -  1  )   ⌊    t  a   +   1  2   ⌋     fragments  x   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)      2  a    fragments  normal-(  t   a   fragments  normal-⌊    t  a      1  2   normal-⌋   normal-)    superscript   fragments  normal-(   1  normal-)   normal-⌊     t  a      1  2   normal-⌋    x(t)=\frac{2}{a}\left(t-a\left\lfloor\frac{t}{a}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor%
 \right)(-1)^{\left\lfloor}\frac{t}{a}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor      where the symbol    ⌊  n  ⌋      n    \scriptstyle\lfloor n\rfloor   represent the floor function of n .   Also, the triangle wave can be the absolute value of the sawtooth wave :        x   (  t  )    =   |   2   (    t  a   -   ⌊    t  a   +   1  2    ⌋    )    |         x  t       2      t  a         t  a     1  2          x(t)=\left|2\left({t\over a}-\left\lfloor{t\over a}+{1\over 2}\right\rfloor%
 \right)\right|     or, for a range from -1 to +1:       x   (  t  )    =    2   |   2   (    t  a   -   ⌊    t  a   +   1  2    ⌋    )    |    -  1         x  t       2      2      t  a         t  a     1  2         1     x(t)=2\left|2\left({t\over a}-\left\lfloor{t\over a}+{1\over 2}\right\rfloor%
 \right)\right|-1     The triangle wave can also be expressed as the integral of the square wave:      ∫    sgn   (   sin   (  x  )    )    d   x           sgn    x    d  x     \int\operatorname{sgn}(\sin(x))\,dx\,     A simple equation with a period of 4, with     y   (  0  )    =  1        y  0   1    y(0)=1   . As this only uses the modulo operation and absolute value , this can be used to simply implement a triangle wave on hardware electronics with less CPU power:       y   (  x  )    =    |    x   mod   4  -  2    |   -  1         y  x        modulo  x    4  2     1     y(x)=|x\,\bmod\,4-2|-1     or, a more complex and complete version of the above equation with a period of "p", amplitude "a", and starting with     y   (  0  )    =  0        y  0   0    y(0)=0   :       y   (  x  )    =     4  a   p    {    |    [    (   x  -   p  4    )   mod  p   ]   -   p  2    |   -   p  4    }          y  x         4  a   p           delimited-[]   modulo    x    p  4    p      p  2       p  4        y(x)=\frac{4a}{p}\Biggl\{\biggl|\left[\left(x-\frac{p}{4}\right)\,\bmod\,p%
 \right]-\frac{p}{2}\biggr|-\frac{p}{4}\Biggr\}     In terms of sine and arcsine with period p and amplitude a :       y   (  x  )    =     2  a   π    arcsin   (   sin   (     2  π   p   x   )    )           y  x         2  a   π             2  π   p   x        y(x)=\frac{2a}{\pi}\arcsin\left(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{p}x\right)\right)     Arc Length  The arc length per period "s" for a triangle wave, given the amplitude "a" and period length "p":      s  =      (   4  a   )   2   +   p  2         s       superscript    4  a   2    superscript  p  2       s=\sqrt{(4a)^{2}+p^{2}}     See also   List of periodic functions  Triangle function  Waves  Sound  Zigzag   References     "  Category:Fourier series  Category:Waveforms
