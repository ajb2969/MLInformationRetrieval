3,4-Dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)

3,4-Dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) (, BoxD, 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase) is an enzyme with system name 3,4-didehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3,4-didehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde + NADP+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  3,4-didehydroadipyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


This enzyme catalyses a step in the aerobic benzoyl-coenzyme A catabolic pathway in Azoarcus evansii and Burkholderia xenovorans.
