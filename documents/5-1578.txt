   Powerful p-group      Powerful p-group   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , especially in the study of p -groups and pro- p -groups , the concept of powerful p -groups plays an important role. They were introduced in , where a number of applications are given, including results on Schur multipliers . Powerful p -groups are used in the study of automorphisms of p -groups , the solution of the restricted Burnside problem , the classification of finite p -groups via the coclass conjectures , and provided an excellent method of understanding analytic pro- p -groups .  Formal definition  A finite p -group   G   G   G   is called powerful if the commutator subgroup     [  G  ,  G  ]     G  G    [G,G]   is contained in the subgroup     G  p   =   ⟨   g  p   |   g  ∈  G   ⟩        superscript  G  p    inner-product   superscript  g  p     g  G      G^{p}=\langle g^{p}|g\in G\rangle   for odd   p   p   p   , or if    [  G  ,  G  ]     G  G    [G,G]   is contained in the subgroup    G  4     superscript  G  4    G^{4}   for p =2.  Properties of powerful p -groups  Powerful p -groups have many properties similar to abelian groups , and thus provide a good basis for studying p -groups. Every finite p -group can be expressed as a section of a powerful p -group.  Powerful p -groups are also useful in the study of pro- p groups as it provides a simple means for characterising p -adic analytic groups (groups that are manifolds over the p -adic numbers): A finitely generated pro- p group is p -adic analytic if and only if it contains an open  normal subgroup that is powerful: this is a special case of a deep result of Michel Lazard (1965).  Some properties similar to abelian p -groups are: if   G   G   G   is a powerful p -group then:   The Frattini subgroup     Φ   (  G  )       normal-Φ  G    \Phi(G)   of   G   G   G   has the property      Φ   (  G  )    =   G  p    .        normal-Φ  G    superscript  G  p     \Phi(G)=G^{p}.          G   p  k    =   {   g   p  k    |   g  ∈  G   }        superscript  G   superscript  p  k     conditional-set   superscript  g   superscript  p  k      g  G      G^{p^{k}}=\{g^{p^{k}}|g\in G\}   for all    k  ≥  1.      k  1.    k\geq 1.   That is, the group generated by   p   p   p   th powers is precisely the set of   p   p   p   th powers.  If    G  =   ⟨   g  1   ,  …  ,   g  d   ⟩       G    subscript  g  1   normal-…   subscript  g  d      G=\langle g_{1},\ldots,g_{d}\rangle   then     G   p  k    =   ⟨   g  1   p  k    ,  …  ,   g  d   p  k    ⟩        superscript  G   superscript  p  k      superscript   subscript  g  1    superscript  p  k    normal-…   superscript   subscript  g  d    superscript  p  k       G^{p^{k}}=\langle g_{1}^{p^{k}},\ldots,g_{d}^{p^{k}}\rangle   for all    k  ≥  1.      k  1.    k\geq 1.     The   k   k   k   th entry of the lower central series of   G   G   G   has the property      γ  k    (  G  )    ≤   G   p   k  -  1            subscript  γ  k   G    superscript  G   superscript  p    k  1       \gamma_{k}(G)\leq G^{p^{k-1}}   for all    k  ≥  1.      k  1.    k\geq 1.     Every quotient group of a powerful p -group is powerful.  The Prüfer rank of   G   G   G   is equal to the minimal number of generators of    G  .    G   G.      Some less abelian-like properties are: if   G   G   G   is a powerful p -group then:       G   p  k      superscript  G   superscript  p  k     G^{p^{k}}   is powerful.  Subgroups of   G   G   G   are not necessarily powerful.   References   Lazard, Michel (1965), Groupes analytiques p-adiques, Publ.Math.IHES 26 (1965), 389-603.
