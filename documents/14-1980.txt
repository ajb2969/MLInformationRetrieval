   Fenchel–Moreau theorem      Fenchel–Moreau theorem   (Figure)  An function that is not lower semi-continuous . By the Fenchel-Moreau theorem, this function is not equal to its biconjugate .   In convex analysis , the Fenchel–Moreau theorem (named after Werner Fenchel and Jean Jacques Moreau ) or Fenchel biconjugation theorem (or just biconjugation theorem ) is a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be equal to its biconjugate . This is in contrast to the general property that for any function     f    *  *    ≤  f       superscript  f    absent     f    f^{**}\leq f   . 1 2 This can be seen as a generalization of the bipolar theorem . 3 It is used in duality theory to prove strong duality (via the perturbation function ).  Statement of theorem  Let    (  X  ,  τ  )     X  τ    (X,\tau)   be a Hausdorff  locally convex space , for any extended real valued function    f  :   X  →   ℝ  ∪   {   ±  ∞   }        normal-:  f   normal-→  X    ℝ    plus-or-minus         f:X\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}   it follows that    f  =   f    *  *        f   superscript  f    absent       f=f^{**}   if and only if one of the following is true      f   f   f   is a proper , lower semi-continuous , and convex function ,      f  ≡   +  ∞       f        f\equiv+\infty   , or      f  ≡   -  ∞       f        f\equiv-\infty   . 4 5 6   References  "  Category:Convex analysis  Category:Theorems in analysis     ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩
