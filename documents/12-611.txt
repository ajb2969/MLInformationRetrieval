   Average crossing number      Average crossing number   In the mathematical subject of knot theory , the average crossing number of a knot is the result of averaging over all directions the number of crossings in a knot diagram of the knot obtained by projection onto the plane orthogonal to the direction. The average crossing number is often seen in the context of physical knot theory .  Definition  More precisely, if K is a smooth knot, then for almost every unit vector v giving the direction, orthogonal projection onto the plane perpendicular to v gives a knot diagram , and we can compute the crossing number, denoted n ( v ). The average crossing number is then defined as the integral over the unit sphere:       1   4  π      ∫   S  2     n   (  v  )   d  A          1    4  π      subscript    superscript  S  2      n  v  d  A      \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S^{2}}n(v)\,dA     where dA is the area form on the 2-sphere. The integral makes sense because the set of directions where projection doesn't give a knot diagram is a set of measure zero and n ( v ) is locally constant when defined.  Alternative formulation  A less intuitive but computationally useful definition is an integral similar to the Gauss linking integral .  We will give a derivation analogous to the derivation of the linking integral. Let K be a knot, parametrized by       f  :    S  1   →   ℝ  3     .     normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  S  1    superscript  ℝ  3      f:S^{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}.     Then define the map from the torus to the 2-sphere      g  :     S  1   ×   S  1    →   S  2       normal-:  g   normal-→     superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1     superscript  S  2      g:S^{1}\times S^{1}\rightarrow S^{2}     by        g   (  s  ,  t  )    =     f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )      |    f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )     |     .        g   s  t          f  s     f  t          f  s     f  t        g(s,t)=\frac{f(s)-f(t)}{|f(s)-f(t)|}.     (Technically, we need to avoid the diagonal: points where s = t .) We want to count the number of times a point (direction) is covered by g . This will count, for a generic direction, the number of crossings in a knot diagram given by projecting along that direction. Using the degree of the map , as in the linking integral, would count the number of crossings with sign , giving the writhe . Use g to pullback the area form on S 2 to the torus T 2 = S 1 × S 1 . Instead of integrating this form, we integrate the absolute value of it, to avoid the sign issue. The resulting integral is        1   4  π      ∫   T  2        |    (      f  ′    (  s  )    ×   f  ′     (  t  )    )   ⋅   (    f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )     )    |     |   (    f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )     )   |   3     d   s   d  t     .        1    4  π      subscript    superscript  T  2           normal-⋅         superscript  f  normal-′   s    superscript  f  normal-′    t       f  s     f  t       superscript        f  s     f  t     3    d  s  d  t      \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{T^{2}}\frac{|(f^{\prime}(s)\times f^{\prime}(t))\cdot(f(s)%
