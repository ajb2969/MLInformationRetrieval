   Poset topology      Poset topology   In mathematics , the poset topology associated with a partially ordered set S (or poset for short) is the Alexandrov topology (open sets are upper sets ) on the poset of finite chains of S, ordered by inclusion.  Let V be a set of vertices. An abstract simplicial complex Δ is a set of finite sets of vertices, known as faces    σ  ⊆  V      σ  V    \sigma\subseteq V   , such that          ∀  ρ   ,  σ   .   ρ  ⊆  σ  ∈  Δ  ⇒  ρ  ∈  Δ      formulae-sequence    for-all  ρ   σ       ρ  σ       normal-Δ    normal-⇒    ρ       normal-Δ      \forall\rho,\sigma.\;\ \rho\subseteq\sigma\in\Delta\Rightarrow\rho\in\Delta        Given a simplicial complex Δ as above, we define a (point set) topology on Δ by letting a subset    Γ  ⊆  Δ      normal-Γ  normal-Δ    \Gamma\subseteq\Delta   be closed if and only if Γ is a simplicial complex:          ∀  ρ   ,  σ   .   ρ  ⊆  σ  ∈  Γ  ⇒  ρ  ∈  Γ      formulae-sequence    for-all  ρ   σ       ρ  σ       normal-Γ    normal-⇒    ρ       normal-Γ      \forall\rho,\sigma.\;\ \rho\subseteq\sigma\in\Gamma\Rightarrow\rho\in\Gamma        This is the Alexandrov topology on the poset of faces of Δ.  The order complex associated with a poset, S, has the underlying set of S as vertices, and the finite chains (i.e. finite totally ordered subsets) of S as faces. The poset topology associated with a poset S is the Alexandrov topology on the order complex associated with S.
