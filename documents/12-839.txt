Change of variables (PDE)

Often a partial differential equation can be reduced to a simpler form with a known solution by a suitable change of variables.
The article discusses change of variable for PDEs below in two ways:

by example;
by giving the theory of the method.

Explanation by example
For example the following simplified form of the Black–Scholes PDE



is reducible to the heat equation



by the change of variables:1












in these steps:

Replace 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and apply the chain rule to get







\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + S \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial S}\right)^2 \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}\right)\right)=0. 

Replace 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to get







 -2v(\ln(S),\frac{1}{2}(T-t))
 -\frac{\partial v(\ln(S),\frac{1}{2}(T-t))}{\partial\tau}
 +\frac{\partial v(\ln(S),\frac{1}{2}(T-t))}{\partial x}
 +\frac{\partial^2 v(\ln(S),\frac{1}{2}(T-t))}{\partial x^2}\right)=0.


Replace 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and divide both sides by 
 
 
 
  to get










Replace 
 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and divide through by 
 
 
 
  to yield the heat equation.

Advice on the application of change of variable to PDEs is given by mathematician J. Michael Steele:2 
Technique in general
Suppose that we have a function 
 
 
 
  and a change of variables 
 
 
 
  such that there exist functions 
 
 
 
 
  such that






and functions 
 
 
 
  such that






and furthermore such that






and






In other words, it is helpful for there to be a bijection between the old set of variables and the new one, or else one has to

Restrict the domain of applicability of the correspondence to a subject of the real plane which is sufficient for a solution of the practical problem at hand (where again it needs to be a bijection), and
Enumerate the (zero or more finite list) of exceptions (poles) where the otherwise-bijection fails (and say why these exceptions don't restrict the applicability of the solution of the reduced equation to the original equation)

If a bijection does not exist then the solution to the reduced-form equation will not in general be a solution of the original equation.
We are discussing change of variable for PDEs. A PDE can be expressed as a differential operator applied to a function. Suppose 
 
 
 
 
  is a differential operator such that



Then it is also the case that



where



and we operate as follows to go from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 


Apply the chain rule to 
 
 
 
  and expand out giving equation 
 
 
 
 .
Substitute 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and expand out giving equation 
 
 
 
 .
Replace occurrences of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  to yield 
 
 
 
 , which will be free of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .

Action-angle coordinates
Often, theory can establish the existence of a change of variables, although the formula itself cannot be explicitly stated. For an integrable Hamiltonian system of dimension 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , there exist 
 
 
 
  integrals 
 
 
 
 
 . There exists a change of variables from the coordinates 
 
 
 
  to a set of variables 
 
 
 
 , in which the equations of motion become 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , where the functions 
 
 
 
 
  are unknown, but depend only on 
 
 
 
 . The variables 
 
 
 
  are the action coordinates, the variables 
 
 
 
  are the angle coordinates. The motion of the system can thus be visualized as rotation on torii. As a particular example, consider the simple harmonic oscillator, with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , with Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
 . This system can be rewritten as 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the canonical polar coordinates
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . See V. I. Arnold, `Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics', for more details.3
