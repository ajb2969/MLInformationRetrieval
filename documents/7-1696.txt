   Lamm equation      Lamm equation   The Lamm equation 1 describes the sedimentation and diffusion of a solute under ultracentrifugation in traditional sector -shaped cells. (Cells of other shapes require much more complex equations.) It was named after Ole Lamm , later professor of physical chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology , who derived it during his Ph.D. studies under Svedberg at Uppsala University .  The Lamm equation can be written: 2 3        ∂  c    ∂  t    =    D   [    (     ∂  2   c    ∂   r  2     )   +    1  r    (    ∂  c    ∂  r    )     ]    -   s   ω  2    [    r   (    ∂  c    ∂  r    )    +   2  c    ]             c     t        D   delimited-[]        superscript   2   c      superscript  r  2         1  r       c     r          s   superscript  ω  2    delimited-[]      r      c     r       2  c         \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\left[\left(\frac{\partial^{2}c}{\partial r^{2}%
 }\right)+\frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial r}\right)\right]-s\omega^%
 {2}\left[r\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial r}\right)+2c\right]     where c is the solute concentration, t and r are the time and radius, and the parameters D , s , and ω represent the solute diffusion constant, sedimentation coefficient and the rotor angular velocity , respectively. The first and second terms on the right-hand side of the Lamm equation are proportional to D and sω 2 , respectively, and describe the competing processes of diffusion and sedimentation . Whereas sedimentation seeks to concentrate the solute near the outer radius of the cell, diffusion seeks to equalize the solute concentration throughout the cell. The diffusion constant D can be estimated from the hydrodynamic radius and shape of the solute, whereas the buoyant mass m b can be determined from the ratio of s and D       s  D   =    m  b     k  B   T          s  D      subscript  m  b      subscript  k  B   T      \frac{s}{D}=\frac{m_{b}}{k_{B}T}     where k B T is the thermal energy, i.e., Boltzmann's constant  k B multiplied by the temperature  T in kelvins .  Solute  molecules cannot pass through the inner and outer walls of the cell, resulting in the boundary conditions on the Lamm equation        D   (    ∂  c    ∂  r    )    -   s   ω  2   r  c    =  0          D      c     r       s   superscript  ω  2   r  c    0    D\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial r}\right)-s\omega^{2}rc=0     at the inner and outer radii, r a and r b , respectively. By spinning samples at constant angular velocity  ω and observing the variation in the concentration c ( r , t ), one may estimate the parameters s and D and, thence, the (effective or equivalent) buoyant mass the solute.
