Kojibiose phosphorylase




Kojibiose phosphorylase

In enzymology, a kojibiose phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-alpha-D-glucosyl-D-glucose + phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-alpha-D-glucosyl-D-glucose (kojibiose) and phosphate, whereas its two products are D-glucose and beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-alpha-D-glucosyl-D-glucose:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase.
