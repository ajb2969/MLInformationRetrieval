   List of production functions      List of production functions   The production functions listed below, and their properties are shown for the case of two factors of production, capital (K), and labor (L), mostly for heuristic purposes. These functions and their properties are easily generalizable to include additional factors of production (like land, natural resources, entrepreneurship, etc.)  A production function can also be seen as the dynamics of national output / national income . This list is to collect production functions & the dynamics of national output/income that have been used in literature & textbooks.  Technology  There are three common ways to incorporate technology (or the efficiency with which factors of production are used) into a production function:   Hicks-neutral technology , or "factor augmenting"     Y   =   A  F   (  K  ,  L  )        Y    A  F   K  L      \ Y=AF(K,L)     Harrod-neutral technology, or "labor augmenting"     Y   =   F   (  K  ,   A  L   )        Y    F   K    A  L       \ Y=F(K,AL)     Solow-neutral technology, or "capital augmenting"     Y   =   F   (   A  K   ,  L  )        Y    F     A  K   L      \ Y=F(AK,L)      Elasticity of substitution  The elasticity of substitution between factors of production is a measure of how easily one factor can be substituted for another. With two factors of production, say, K and L, it is a measure of the curvature of a production isoquant . The mathematical definition is:       \Epsilon   =    [     ∂   (   s  l  o  p  e   )     ∂   (   L  /  K   )       L  /  K    s  l  o  p  e     ]    -  1        \Epsilon   superscript   delimited-[]          s  l  o  p  e        L  K         L  K     s  l  o  p  e        1      \ \Epsilon=[\frac{\partial(slope)}{\partial(L/K)}\frac{L/K}{slope}]^{-1}     where "slope" denotes the slope of the isoquant, given by:        s   l  o  p  e   =   -      ∂  F    (  K  ,  L  )    /   ∂  K       ∂  F    (  K  ,  L  )    /   ∂  L            s  l  o  p  e             F    K  L      K          F    K  L      L        \ slope=-\frac{\partial F(K,L)/\partial K}{\partial F(K,L)/\partial L}     Returns to scale  Returns to scale can be   Increasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages more than doubles output.  Decreasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages less than doubles output.  Constant returns to scale: doubling all input usages exactly doubles output.

 {2}(K)     Factors  Some authors also propose "indirect" production function. Production function can be assumed to have more factors in play, and with some factors refined. For instance,    Y  =    A   F   (   K  f   ,   K  w   ,   L  w   ,   L  m   ,   b  u  s  i  n  e  s   s   c  o  n  f  i  d  e  n  c  e   ,   c  o  n  s  u  m  e   r   c  o  n  f  i  d  e  n  c  e   )        Y    A  F     K  f     K  w     L  w     L  m     b  u  s  i  n  e  s  s  c  o  n  f  i  d  e  n  c  e     c  o  n  s  u  m  e  r  c  o  n  f  i  d  e  n  c  e       Y=A\,F(Kf,Kw,Lw,Lm,business\,confidence,\,consumer\,confidence)   while    K  f      K  f    Kf   is the fixed capital,    K  w      K  w    Kw   is the working capital,    L  w      L  w    Lw   is the working labor,    L  m      L  m    Lm   is the management labor.
