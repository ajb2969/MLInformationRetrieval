Cylindric numbering

In computability theory a cylindric numbering is a special kind of numbering first introduced by Yuri L. Ershov in 1973.
If a numberings 
 
 
 
  is reducible to 
 
 
 
  then there exists a computable function 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Usually 
 
 
 
  is not injective but if 
 
 
 
  is a cylindric numbering we can always find an injective 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
A numbering 
 
 
 
  is called cylindric if


 
  That is if it is one-equivalent to its cylindrification
A set 
 
 
 
  is called cylindric if its indicator function


 
  is a cylindric numbering.
Examples

every Gödel numbering is cylindric

Properties

cylindric numberings are idempotent,
