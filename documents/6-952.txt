   Cylindric numbering      Cylindric numbering   In computability theory a cylindric numbering is a special kind of numbering first introduced by Yuri L. Ershov in 1973.  If a numberings   ν   ν   \nu   is reducible to   μ   μ   \mu   then there exists a computable function   f   f   f   with    ν  =   μ  ∘  f       ν    μ  f     \nu=\mu\circ f   . Usually   f   f   f   is not injective but if   μ   μ   \mu   is a cylindric numbering we can always find an injective   f   f   f   .  Definition  A numbering   ν   ν   \nu   is called cylindric if       ν   ≡  1    c   (  ν  )     .      subscript   1   ν    c  ν     \nu\equiv_{1}c(\nu).   That is if it is one-equivalent to its cylindrification  A set   S   S   S   is called cylindric if its indicator function       1  S   :   ℕ  →   {  0  ,  1  }       normal-:   subscript  1  S    normal-→  ℕ   0  1      1_{S}:\mathbb{N}\to\{0,1\}   is a cylindric numbering.  Examples   every Gödel numbering is cylindric   Properties   cylindric numberings are idempotent ,     ν  ∘  ν   =  ν        ν  ν   ν    \nu\circ\nu=\nu      References   Yu. L.
