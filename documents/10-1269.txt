   Aryl-aldehyde oxidase      Aryl-aldehyde oxidase   In enzymology , an aryl-aldehyde oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aromatic aldehyde + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aromatic carboxylic acid + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are aromatic aldehyde , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are aromatic carboxylic acid and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aryl-aldehyde:oxygen oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.2.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
