   RC time constant      RC time constant   The RC time constant , also called tau, is the time constant (in seconds ) of an RC circuit , is equal to the product of the circuit resistance (in ohms ) and the circuit capacitance (in farads ), i.e.      τ  =   R  C       τ    R  C     \tau=RC     It is the time required to charge the capacitor , through the resistor , by ≈ 63.2 percent of the difference between the initial value and final value or discharge the capacitor to ≈36.8 percent. This value is derived from the mathematical constant e , specifically    1  -   e   -  1        1   superscript  e    1      1-e^{-1}   , more specifically as voltage to charge the capacitor versus time   Charging     V   (  t  )    =    V  0    (   1  -   e   -   t  /  τ      )          V  t      subscript  V  0     1   superscript  e      t  τ         V(t)=V_{0}(1-e^{-t/\tau})    1   Discharging     V   (  t  )    =    V  0    (   e   -   t  /  τ     )          V  t      subscript  V  0    superscript  e      t  τ        V(t)=V_{0}(e^{-t/\tau})      Cutoff frequency  The time constant   τ   τ   \tau   is related to the cutoff frequency  f c , an alternative parameter of the RC circuit, by      τ  =   R  C   =   1   2  π   f  c           τ    R  C          1    2  π   subscript  f  c        \tau=RC=\frac{1}{2\pi f_{c}}   or, equivalently,       f  c   =   1   2  π  R  C    =   1   2  π  τ           subscript  f  c     1    2  π  R  C           1    2  π  τ       f_{c}=\frac{1}{2\pi RC}=\frac{1}{2\pi\tau}   where resistance in ohms and capacitance in farads yields the time constant in seconds or the frequency in Hz.  Short conditional equations:   f c in Hz = 159155 / τ in µs  τ in µs = 159155 / f c in Hz   Other useful equations are:   rise time (20% to 80%)     t  r   ≈   1.4  τ   ≈   0.22   f  c           subscript  t  r     1.4  τ          0.22   subscript  f  c       t_{r}\approx 1.4\tau\approx\frac{0.22}{f_{c}}     rise time (10% to 90%)     t  r   ≈   2.2  τ   ≈   0.35   f  c           subscript  t  r     2.2  τ          0.35   subscript  f  c       t_{r}\approx 2.2\tau\approx\frac{0.35}{f_{c}}      Standard time constants and cutoff frequencies  for pre-emphasis/de-emphasis RC filters:      Organization    Time constant   τ   τ   \tau    in µs   Cutoff frequency f c in Hz       RIAA   7958   20     RIAA, NAB   3183   50     —   1592   100     RIAA   318   500.5     —   200   796     —   140   1137     MC   120   1326     NAB   100   1592     MC   90   1768     RIAA, FM   75   2122     FM   50 / 75   2122 / 3183     NAB, PCM   50   3183     DIN   35   4547     —   25   6366     AES   17.5   9095     PCM   15   10610     —   12.5   12732     —   10   15915     Ortofon   3.5   45473     RIAA   3.18   50000     In more complicated circuits consisting of more than one resistor and/or capacitor, the open-circuit time constant method provides a way of approximating the cutoff frequency by computing a sum of several RC time constants.  Delay  The signal delay of a wire or other circuit, measured as group delay or phase delay or the effective propagation delay of a digital transition, may be dominated by resistive-capacitive effects, depending on the distance and other parameters, or may alternatively be dominated by inductive , wave, and speed of light effects in other realms.  Resistive-capacitive delay, or RC delay, hinders the further increasing of speed in microelectronic  integrated circuits . When the feature size becomes smaller and smaller to increase the clock speed , the RC delay plays an increasingly important role. This delay can be reduced by replacing the aluminum conducting wire by copper , thus reducing the resistance; it can also be reduced by changing the interlayer dielectric (typically silicon dioxide) to low-dielectric-constant materials, thus reducing the capacitance.  The typical digital propagation delay of a resistive wire is about half of R times C; since both R and C are proportional to wire length, the delay scales as the square of wire length. Charge spreads by diffusion in such a wire, as explained by Lord Kelvin in the mid nineteenth century. 2 Until Heaviside discovered that Maxwell's equations imply wave propagation when sufficient inductance is in the circuit, this square diffusion relationship was thought to provide a fundamental limit to the improvement of long-distance telegraph cables. That old analysis was superseded in the telegraph domain, but remains relevant for long on-chip interconnects. 3 4 5  See also   Cutoff frequency and frequency response  Emphasis , preemphasis , deemphasis  Exponential decay  Filter (signal processing) and transfer function  High-pass filter , low-pass filter , band-pass filter  RL circuit , and RLC circuit   References    External links   RC Time Constant Calculator  Conversion time constant   τ   τ   \tau   to cutoff frequency f c and back  RC time constant   "  Category:Electronics     http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/capdis.html ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
