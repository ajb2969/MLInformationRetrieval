   2-methyl-branched-chain-enoyl-CoA reductase      2-methyl-branched-chain-enoyl-CoA reductase   In enzymology , a 2-methyl-branched-chain-enoyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-methylbutanoyl-CoA + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2-methylcrotonoyl-CoA , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methyl-branched-chain-acyl-CoA:NAD+ 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References      "  Category:EC 1.3.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
