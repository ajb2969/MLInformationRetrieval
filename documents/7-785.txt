   Bach's algorithm      Bach's algorithm   Bach's algorithm 1 is a probabilistic polynomial time  algorithm for generating random numbers along with their factorization , named after its discoverer, Eric Bach . It is of interest because no algorithm is known that efficiently factors numbers, so the straightforward method, namely generating a random number and then factoring it, is impractical.  The algorithm performs, in expectation, O(log n) primality tests .  A simpler, but less efficient algorithm (performing, in expectation, O(log 2 n) primality tests), is known and is due to Adam Kalai 2  Overview  Bach's algorithm produces a number x uniformly at random between a given limit N and N /2, specifically     N  2   <  x  ≤  N          N  2   x       N     \frac{N}{2}   , along with its factorization. It does this by picking a prime number  p and an exponent a such that     p  a   ≤  N       superscript  p  a   N    p^{a}\leq N   , according to a certain distribution. Bach's algorithm is then recursively applied to generate a number y uniformly at random between M and M /2, where    M  =   N   p  a        M    N   superscript  p  a      M=\frac{N}{p^{a}}   , along with the factorization of y . It then sets    x  =    p  a   y       x     superscript  p  a   y     x=p^{a}y   , and appends    p  a     superscript  p  a    p^{a}   to the factorization of y to produce the factorization of x . This gives x which logarithmic distribution over the desired range; rejection sampling is then used to get a uniform distribution.  References     Bach, Eric .
