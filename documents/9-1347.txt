Chow's lemma

Chow's lemma, named after Wei-Liang Chow, is one of the foundational results in algebraic geometry. It roughly says that a proper morphism is fairly close to being a projective morphism. More precisely, a version of it states the following:1

If 
 
 
 
  is a scheme that is proper over a noetherian base 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a projective

 
 -scheme 
 
 
 
 
  and a surjective 
 
 
 
 -morphism 
 
 
 
  that induces an isomorphism 
 
 
 
  for some dense open 
 
 
 
 .
 

Proof
The proof here is a standard one (cf. ).
It is easy to reduce to the case when 
 
 
 
 
  is irreducible, as follows. 
 
 
 
  is noetherian since it is of finite type over a noetherian base. Then it's also topologically noetherian, and consists of a finite number of irreducible components 
 
 
 
 , which are each proper over 
 
 
 
  (because they're closed immersions in the scheme 
 
 
 
  which is proper over 
 
 
 
 
 ). If, within each of these irreducible components, there exists a dense open 
 
 
 
 , then we can take 
 
 
 
 . It is not hard to see that each of the disjoint pieces are dense in their respective 
 
 
 
 , so the full set 
 
 
 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 
 . In addition, it's clear that we can similarly find a morphism 
 
 
 
  which satisfies the density condition.
Having reduced the problem, we now assume 
 
 
 
  is irreducible. We recall that it must also be noetherian. Thus, we can find a finite open affine cover 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  are quasi-projective over 
 
 
 
 
 ; there are open immersions over 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  into some projective 
 
 
 
 -schemes 
 
 
 
 . Put 
 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is nonempty since 
 
 
 
  is irreducible. Let


 
  be given by 
 
 
 
 's restricted to 
 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 . Let


 
  be given by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is then an immersion; thus, it factors as an open immersion followed by a closed immersion 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the immersion followed by the projection. We claim 
 
 
 
  induces 
 
 
 
 
 ; for that, it is enough to show 
 
 
 
 . But this means that 
 
 
 
  is closed in 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  factorizes as 
 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is separated over 
 
 
 
  and so the graph morphism 
 
 
 
  is a closed immersion. This proves our contention.
It remains to show 
 
 
 
  is projective over 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the closed immersion followed by the projection. Showing that 
 
 
 
  is a closed immersion shows 
 
 
 
  is projective over 
 
 
 
 . This can be checked locally. Identifying 
 
 
 
 
  with its image in 
 
 
 
  we suppress 
 
 
 
  from our notation.
Let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . We claim 
 
 
 
 
  are an open cover of 
 
 
 
 . This would follow from 
 
 
 
  as sets. This in turn follows from 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  as functions on the underlying topological space. Since 
 
 
 
 
  is separated over 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is dense, this is clear from looking at the relevant commutative diagram. Now, 
 
 
 
  is closed since it is a base extension of the proper morphism 
 
 
 
 . Thus, 
 
 
 
 
  is a closed subscheme covered by 
 
 
 
 , and so it is enough to show that for each 
 
 
 
  the map 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is a closed immersion.
Fix 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the graph of 
 
 
 
 . It is a closed subscheme of 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
  is separated over 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the projections. We claim that 
 
 
 
  factors through 
 
 
 
 , which would imply 
 
 
 
  is a closed immersion. But for 
 
 
 
 
  we have:


 
  The last equality holds and thus there is 
 
 
 
  that satisfies the first equality. This proves our claim. 
 
 

Additional statements
In the statement of Chow's lemma, if 
 
 
 
  is reduced, irreducible, or integral, we can assume that the same holds for 
 
 
 
 
 . If both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are irreducible, then 
 
 
 
  is a birational morphism. (cf. ).
