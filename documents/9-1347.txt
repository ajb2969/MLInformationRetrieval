   Chow's lemma      Chow's lemma   Chow's lemma , named after Wei-Liang Chow , is one of the foundational results in algebraic geometry . It roughly says that a proper morphism is fairly close to being a projective morphism . More precisely, a version of it states the following: 1   If   X   X   X   is a scheme that is proper over a noetherian base   S   S   S   , then there exists a projective    S   S   S   -scheme    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   and a surjective   S   S   S   -morphism    f  :    X  ′   →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   X     f\colon X^{\prime}\to X   that induces an isomorphism      f   -  1     (  U  )    ≃  U     similar-to-or-equals     superscript  f    1    U   U    f^{-1}(U)\simeq U   for some dense open    U  ⊆  X      U  X    U\subseteq X   .   Proof  The proof here is a standard one (cf. ).  It is easy to reduce to the case when   X   X   X   is irreducible, as follows.   X   X   X   is noetherian since it is of finite type over a noetherian base. Then it's also topologically noetherian, and consists of a finite number of irreducible components    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   , which are each proper over   S   S   S   (because they're closed immersions in the scheme   X   X   X   which is proper over   S   S   S   ). If, within each of these irreducible components, there exists a dense open     U  i   ⊂   X  i        subscript  U  i    subscript  X  i     U_{i}\subset X_{i}   , then we can take    U  :=   ⊔   (    U  i   ∖    ⋃   i  ≠  j     X  j     )       assign  U   square-union     subscript  U  i     subscript     i  j     subscript  X  j        U:=\bigsqcup(U_{i}\setminus\bigcup\limits_{i\neq j}X_{j})   . It is not hard to see that each of the disjoint pieces are dense in their respective    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   , so the full set   U   U   U   is dense in   X   X   X   . In addition, it's clear that we can similarly find a morphism   g   g   g   which satisfies the density condition.  Having reduced the problem, we now assume   X   X   X   is irreducible. We recall that it must also be noetherian. Thus, we can find a finite open affine cover    X  =    ⋃   i  =  1   n    U  i        X    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  U  i      X=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}U_{i}   .    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   are quasi-projective over   S   S   S   ; there are open immersions over   S   S   S   ,     ϕ  i   :    U  i   →   P  i       normal-:   subscript  ϕ  i    normal-→   subscript  U  i    subscript  P  i      \phi_{i}\colon U_{i}\to P_{i}   into some projective   S   S   S   -schemes    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   . Put    U  =   ∩   U  i        U     subscript  U  i      U=\cap U_{i}   .   U   U   U   is nonempty since   X   X   X   is irreducible. Let       ϕ  :   U  →  P  =    P  1    ×  S   ⋯   ×  S    P  n      .     normal-:  ϕ     normal-→  U  P         subscript   S    subscript  P  1   normal-⋯   subscript  P  n        \phi\colon U\to P=P_{1}\times_{S}\cdots\times_{S}P_{n}.   be given by    ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   's restricted to   U   U   U   over   S   S   S   . Let       ψ  :   U  →   X   ×  S   P     .     normal-:  ψ   normal-→  U    subscript   S   X  P      \psi\colon U\to X\times_{S}P.   be given by    U  ↪  X     normal-↪  U  X    U\hookrightarrow X   and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   over   S   S   S   .   ψ   ψ   \psi   is then an immersion; thus, it factors as an open immersion followed by a closed immersion     X  ′   →   X   ×  S   P      normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′     subscript   S   X  P     X^{\prime}\to X\times_{S}P   . Let    f  :    X  ′   →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   X     f\colon X^{\prime}\to X   be the immersion followed by the projection. We claim   f   f   f   induces      f   -  1     (  U  )    ≃  U     similar-to-or-equals     superscript  f    1    U   U    f^{-1}(U)\simeq U   ; for that, it is enough to show      f   -  1     (  U  )    =   ψ   (  U  )           superscript  f    1    U     ψ  U     f^{-1}(U)=\psi(U)   . But this means that    ψ   (  U  )       ψ  U    \psi(U)   is closed in    U   ×  S   P      subscript   S   U  P    U\times_{S}P   .   ψ   ψ   \psi   factorizes as      U   →   Γ  ϕ    U    ×  S   P   →   X   ×  S   P      normal-→    subscript   S     U    subscript  normal-Γ  ϕ   normal-→   U   P     subscript   S   X  P     U\overset{\Gamma_{\phi}}{\to}U\times_{S}P\to X\times_{S}P   .   P   P   P   is separated over   S   S   S   and so the graph morphism    Γ  ϕ     subscript  normal-Γ  ϕ    \Gamma_{\phi}   is a closed immersion. This proves our contention.  It remains to show    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   is projective over   S   S   S   . Let    g  :    X  ′   →  P      normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   P     g\colon X^{\prime}\to P   be the closed immersion followed by the projection. Showing that   g   g   g   is a closed immersion shows    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   is projective over   S   S   S   . This can be checked locally. Identifying    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   with its image in    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   we suppress    ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   from our notation.  Let     V  i   =    p  i   -  1     (   U  i   )         subscript  V  i      superscript   subscript  p  i     1     subscript  U  i      V_{i}=p_{i}^{-1}(U_{i})   where     p  i   :   P  →   P  i       normal-:   subscript  p  i    normal-→  P   subscript  P  i      p_{i}\colon P\to P_{i}   . We claim     g   -  1     (   V  i   )        superscript  g    1     subscript  V  i     g^{-1}(V_{i})   are an open cover of    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   . This would follow from      f   -  1     (   U  i   )    ⊂    g   -  1     (   V  i   )           superscript  f    1     subscript  U  i       superscript  g    1     subscript  V  i      f^{-1}(U_{i})\subset g^{-1}(V_{i})   as sets. This in turn follows from    f  =    p  i   ∘  g       f     subscript  p  i   g     f=p_{i}\circ g   on    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   as functions on the underlying topological space. Since   X   X   X   is separated over   S   S   S   and    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is dense, this is clear from looking at the relevant commutative diagram. Now,     X   ×  S   P   →  P     normal-→    subscript   S   X  P   P    X\times_{S}P\to P   is closed since it is a base extension of the proper morphism    X  →  S     normal-→  X  S    X\to S   . Thus,    g   (   X  ′   )       g   superscript  X  normal-′     g(X^{\prime})   is a closed subscheme covered by    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   , and so it is enough to show that for each   i   i   i   the map    g  :     g   -  1     (   V  i   )    →   V  i       normal-:  g   normal-→     superscript  g    1     subscript  V  i     subscript  V  i      g\colon g^{-1}(V_{i})\to V_{i}   , denoted by   h   h   h   , is a closed immersion.  Fix   i   i   i   . Let   Z   Z   Z   be the graph of    u  :     V  i    →   p  i     U  i    ↪  X      normal-:  u   normal-↪     subscript  V  i     subscript  p  i   normal-→    subscript  U  i    X     u\colon V_{i}\overset{p_{i}}{\to}U_{i}\hookrightarrow X   . It is a closed subscheme of    X   ×  S    V  i       subscript   S   X   subscript  V  i     X\times_{S}V_{i}   since   X   X   X   is separated over   S   S   S   . Let     q  1   :    X   ×  S   P   →   X  ,   q  2     :    X   ×  S   P   →  P        normal-:   subscript  q  1    normal-→    subscript   S   X  P    X   subscript  q  2       normal-:     normal-→    subscript   S   X  P   P      q_{1}\colon X\times_{S}P\to X,\ q_{2}\colon X\times_{S}P\to P   be the projections. We claim that   h   h   h   factors through   Z   Z   Z   , which would imply   h   h   h   is a closed immersion. But for    w  :    U  ′   →   V  i       normal-:  w   normal-→   superscript  U  normal-′    subscript  V  i      w\colon U^{\prime}\to V_{i}   we have:        v  =     Γ  u   ∘  w   ⇔        q  1   ∘  v   =    u  ∘   q  2   ∘  v   ⇔        q  1   ∘  ψ   =    u  ∘   q  2   ∘  ψ   ⇔       q  1   ∘  ψ   =   u  ∘  ϕ       .     formulae-sequence    v      subscript  normal-Γ  u   w   normal-⇔     formulae-sequence       subscript  q  1   v      u   subscript  q  2   v   normal-⇔     formulae-sequence       subscript  q  1   ψ      u   subscript  q  2   ψ   normal-⇔         subscript  q  1   ψ     u  ϕ        v=\Gamma_{u}\circ w\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad q_{1}\circ v=u\circ q_{2}\circ v%
 \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad q_{1}\circ\psi=u\circ q_{2}\circ\psi\quad%
 \Leftrightarrow\quad q_{1}\circ\psi=u\circ\phi.   The last equality holds and thus there is   w   w   w   that satisfies the first equality. This proves our claim.   □   normal-□   \square     Additional statements  In the statement of Chow's lemma, if   X   X   X   is reduced, irreducible, or integral, we can assume that the same holds for    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   . If both   X   X   X   and    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   are irreducible, then    f  :    X  ′   →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   X     f\colon X^{\prime}\to X   is a birational morphism.
