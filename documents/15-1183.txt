Diapolycopene oxygenase

Diapolycopene oxygenase (, crtP) is an enzyme with system name 4,4'-diapolycopene,AH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (4,4'-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4,4'-diapolycopene + 4 AH2 + 4 O2

 
  4,4'-diapolycopenedial + 4 A + 6 H2O
 

Diapolycopene oxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of C30 carotenoids such as staphyloxanthin.
