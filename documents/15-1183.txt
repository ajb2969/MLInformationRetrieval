   Diapolycopene oxygenase      Diapolycopene oxygenase   Diapolycopene oxygenase (, crtP ) is an enzyme with system name 4,4'-diapolycopene,AH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (4,4'-hydroxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   4,4'-diapolycopene + 4 AH 2 + 4 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,4'-diapolycopenedial + 4 A + 6 H 2 O   Diapolycopene oxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of C30 carotenoids such as staphyloxanthin .
