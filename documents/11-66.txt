   Cysteine—tRNA ligase      Cysteine—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , a cysteine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-cysteine + tRNACys   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-cysteinyl-tRNACys   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-cysteine , and tRNA(Cys) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-cysteinyl-tRNA(Cys) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine:tRNACys ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase , cysteinyl-transferRNA synthetase , cysteinyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , and cysteine translase . This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
