   Trans-aconitate 2-methyltransferase      Trans-aconitate 2-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a trans-aconitate 2-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + trans-aconitate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (E)-3-(methoxycarbonyl)pent-2-enedioate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and trans-aconitate , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (E)-3-(methoxycarbonyl)pent-2-enedioate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(E)-prop-1-ene-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 2'-O-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
