   Alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase      Alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , an alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + [alpha-tubulin]-L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + [alpha-tubulin]-N 6 -acetyl-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and [[[alpha-tubulin]-L-lysine]], whereas its two products are CoA and [[[alpha-tubulin]-N6-acetyl-L-lysine]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:[alpha-tubulin]-L-lysine N6-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include alpha-tubulin acetylase , TAT , alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase , tubulin N-acetyltransferase , acetyl-CoA:alpha-tubulin-L-lysine N-acetyltransferase , and acetyl-CoA:[alpha-tubulin]-L-lysine 6-N-acetyltransferase .
