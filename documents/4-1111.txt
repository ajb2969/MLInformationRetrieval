   Toroidal reflector      Toroidal reflector   A toroidal mirror is a form of parabolic reflector which has a different focal distance depending on the angle of the mirror. The curvature is actually that of an elliptic paraboloid with    a  â‰   b      a  b    a\neq b   . If the shape were that of a toroid , the mirror would exhibit spherical aberration .  Toroidal mirrors are used in Yolo telescopes and optical monochromators . In these devices, the source and detectors of the light are not located on the optic axis of the mirror, so the use of a true paraboloid of revolution would cause a distorted image.
