PRO (category theory)

In category theory, a PRO is a strict monoidal category whose objects are the natural numbers (including zero), and whose tensor product is given on objects by the addition on numbers.
Some examples of PROs:

the discrete category 
 
 
 
  of natural numbers,
the category FinSet of natural numbers and functions between them,
the category Bij of natural numbers and bijections,
the category '''BijBraid '''of natural numbers, equipped with the braid group ''Bn ''as the automorphisms of each ''n ''(and no other morphisms).
the category Inj of natural numbers and injections,
the simplex category

 
  of natural numbers and monotonic functions.

The name PRO is an abbreviation of "PROduct category". PROBs and PROPs are defined similarly with the additional requirement for the category to be braided, and to have a symmetry (that is, a permutation), respectively. All of the examples above are PROPs, except for the simplex category and BijBraid; the latter is a '''PROB '''but not a PROP, and the former is not even a PROB.
Algebras of a PRO
An algebra of a PRO 
 
 
 
  in a monoidal category

 
  is a strict monoidal functor from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Every PRO 
 
 
 
  and category 
 
 
 
  give rise to a category 
 
 
 
  of algebras whose objects are the algebras of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and whose morphisms are the natural transformations between them.
For example:

an algebra of 
 
 
 
  is just an object of 
 
 
 
 ,
an algebra of FinSet is a commutative monoid object of 
 
 
 
 ,
an algebra of 
 
 
 
  is a monoid object in 
 
 
 
 .

More precisely, what we mean here by "the algebras of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  are the monoid objects in 
 
 
 
 " for example is that the category of algebras of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to the category of monoids in 
 
 
 
 .
