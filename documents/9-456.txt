   Sazonov's theorem      Sazonov's theorem   In mathematics , Sazonov's theorem , named after Vyacheslav Vasilievich Sazonov (), is a theorem in functional analysis .  It states that a bounded linear operator between two Hilbert spaces is γ -radonifying if it is Hilbert–Schmidt . The result is also important in the study of stochastic processes and the Malliavin calculus , since results concerning probability measures on infinite-dimensional spaces are of central importance in these fields. Sazonov's theorem also has a converse: if the map is not Hilbert–Schmidt, then it is not γ-radonifying.  Statement of the theorem  Let G and H be two Hilbert spaces and let T : G → H be a bounded operator from G to H . Recall that T is said to be γ -radonifying if the push forward of the canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure on G is a bona fide  measure on H . Recall also that T is said to be Hilbert–Schmidt if there is an orthonormal basis { e i | i ∈ I } of G such that         ∑   i  ∈  I      ∥   T   (   e  i   )    ∥   H  2    <   +  ∞    .        subscript     i  I     superscript   subscript   norm    T   subscript  e  i     H   2          \sum_{i\in I}\|T(e_{i})\|_{H}^{2}<+\infty.     Then Sazonov's theorem is that T is γ -radonifying if it is Hilbert–Schmidt.  The proof uses Prokhorov's theorem .  Remarks  The canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space can never be a bona fide measure; equivalently, the identity function on such a space cannot be γ -radonifying.
