   Aspartate N-acetyltransferase      Aspartate N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , an aspartate N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + L-aspartate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-acetyl-L-aspartate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and L-aspartate , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-L-aspartate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:L-aspartate N-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include aspartate acetyltransferase , and L-aspartate N-acetyltransferase .
