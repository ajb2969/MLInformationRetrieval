   Sequence space      Sequence space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , a sequence space is a vector space whose elements are infinite sequences of real or complex numbers . Equivalently, it is a function space whose elements are functions from the natural numbers to the field K of real or complex numbers. The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in K , and can be turned into a vector space under the operations of pointwise addition of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are linear subspaces of this space. Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a norm , or at least the structure of a topological vector space .  The most important sequences spaces in analysis are the ℓ p spaces, consisting of the p -power summable sequences, with the p -norm. These are special cases of L p spaces for the counting measure on the set of natural numbers. Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or null sequences form sequence spaces, respectively denoted c and c 0 , with the sup norm. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence , under which it becomes a special kind of Fréchet space called FK-space .  Definition  Let K denote the field either of real or complex numbers. Denote by K N the set of all sequences of scalars          (   x  n   )    n  ∈  𝐍    ,   x  n    ∈  𝐊   .        subscript   subscript  x  n     n  𝐍     subscript  x  n    𝐊    (x_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}},\quad x_{n}\in\mathbf{K}.   This can be turned into a vector space by defining vector addition as         (   x  n   )    n  ∈  𝐍    +    (   y  n   )    n  ∈  𝐍      =  def     (    x  n   +   y  n    )    n  ∈  𝐍        superscript   def      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  𝐍     subscript   subscript  y  n     n  𝐍      subscript     subscript  normal-x  normal-n    subscript  normal-y  normal-n      normal-n  𝐍      (x_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}}+(y_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}}\stackrel{\rm{def}}{=}(x_{n}+%
 y_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}}   and the scalar multiplication as        α    (   x  n   )    n  ∈  𝐍     :=    (   α   x  n    )    n  ∈  𝐍     .     assign    α   subscript   subscript  x  n     n  𝐍      subscript    α   subscript  x  n      n  𝐍      \alpha(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}}:=(\alpha x_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}}.   A sequence space is any linear subspace of K N .  ℓ p spaces  L p space}} For 0 p is the subspace of K N consisting of all sequences x = ( x n ) satisfying         ∑  n     |   x  n   |   p    <  ∞   .        subscript   n    superscript     subscript  x  n    p       \sum_{n}|x_{n}|^{p}<\infty.   If p ≥ 1, then the real-valued operation    ∥  ⋅   ∥  p      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  p     \|\cdot\|_{p}   defined by        ∥  x  ∥   p   =    (    ∑  n     |   x  n   |   p    )    1  /  p         subscript   norm  x   p    superscript    subscript   n    superscript     subscript  x  n    p      1  p      \|x\|_{p}=\left(\sum_{n}|x_{n}|^{p}\right)^{1/p}   defines a norm on ℓ p . In fact, ℓ p is a complete metric space with respect to this norm, and therefore is a Banach space .  If 0 p does not carry a norm, but rather a metric defined by        d   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ∑  n     |    x  n   -   y  n    |   p     .        d   x  y      subscript   n    superscript       subscript  x  n    subscript  y  n     p      d(x,y)=\sum_{n}|x_{n}-y_{n}|^{p}.\,     If p = ∞, then ℓ ∞ is defined to be the space of all bounded sequences. With respect to the norm         ∥  x  ∥   ∞   =    sup  n    |   x  n   |     ,       subscript   norm  x       subscript  supremum  n      subscript  x  n       \|x\|_{\infty}=\sup_{n}|x_{n}|,   ℓ ∞ is also a Banach space.  c and c 0  The space of convergent sequences  c is a sequence space. This consists of all x ∈ K N such that lim n →∞ x n exists. Since every convergent sequence is bounded, c is a linear subspace of ℓ ∞ . It is, moreover, a closed subspace with respect to the infinity norm, and so a Banach space in its own right.  The subspace of null sequences c 0 consists of all sequences whose limit is zero. This is a closed subspace of c , and so again a Banach space.  Other sequence spaces  The space of bounded series , denote by bs , is the space of sequences x for which         sup  n    |    ∑   i  =  0   n    x  i    |    <  ∞   .        subscript  supremum  n       superscript   subscript     i  0    n    subscript  x  i         \sup_{n}\left|\sum_{i=0}^{n}x_{i}\right|<\infty.   This space, when equipped with the norm         ∥  x  ∥    b  s    =    sup  n    |    ∑   i  =  0   n    x  i    |     ,       subscript   norm  x     b  s      subscript  supremum  n       superscript   subscript     i  0    n    subscript  x  i        \|x\|_{bs}=\sup_{n}\left|\sum_{i=0}^{n}x_{i}\right|,   is a Banach space isometrically isomorphic to ℓ ∞ , via the linear mapping         (   x  n   )    n  ∈  𝐍    ↦    (    ∑   i  =  0   n    x  i    )    n  ∈  𝐍     .     maps-to   subscript   subscript  x  n     n  𝐍     subscript    superscript   subscript     i  0    n    subscript  x  i      n  𝐍      (x_{n})_{n\in\mathbf{N}}\mapsto\left(\sum_{i=0}^{n}x_{i}\right)_{n\in\mathbf{N%
 }}.   The subspace cs consisting of all convergent series is a subspace that goes over to the space c under this isomorphism.  The space Φ or    c  00     subscript  c  00    c_{00}   is defined to be the space of all infinite sequences with only a finite number of non-zero terms (sequences with finite support ). This set is dense in many sequence spaces.  Properties of ℓ p spaces and the space c 0  The space ℓ 2 is the only ℓ p space that is a Hilbert space , since any norm that is induced by an inner product should satisfy the parallelogram identity       ∥   x  +  y   ∥   p  2   +    ∥   x  -  y   ∥   p  2    =    2    ∥  x  ∥   p  2    +   2    ∥  y  ∥   p  2            superscript   subscript   norm    x  y    p   2    superscript   subscript   norm    x  y    p   2        2   superscript   subscript   norm  x   p   2      2   superscript   subscript   norm  y   p   2       \|x+y\|_{p}^{2}+\|x-y\|_{p}^{2}=2\|x\|_{p}^{2}+2\|y\|_{p}^{2}   . Substituting two distinct unit vectors for x and y directly shows that the identity is not true unless p = 2.  Each ℓ p is distinct, in that ℓ p is a strict subset of ℓ s whenever p  p is not linearly isomorphic to ℓ s when p ≠ s . In fact, by Pitt's theorem , every bounded linear operator from ℓ s to ℓ p is compact when p  s , and is thus said to be strictly singular .  If 1 p is isometrically isomorphic to ℓ q , where q is the Hölder conjugate of p : 1/ p + 1/ q = 1. The specific isomorphism associates to an element x of ℓ q the functional        L  x    (  y  )    =    ∑  n     x  n    y  n            subscript  L  x   y     subscript   n      subscript  x  n    subscript  y  n       L_{x}(y)=\sum_{n}x_{n}y_{n}   for y in ℓ p . Hölder's inequality implies that L x is a bounded linear functional on ℓ p , and in fact       |    L  x    (  y  )    |   ≤      ∥  x  ∥   q      ∥  y  ∥   p             subscript  L  x   y       subscript   norm  x   q    subscript   norm  y   p      |L_{x}(y)|\leq\|x\|_{q}\,\|y\|_{p}   so that the operator norm satisfies         ∥   L  x   ∥     (   ℓ  p   )   *     =  def     sup    y  ∈   ℓ  p    ,   y  ≠  0       |    L  x    (  y  )    |     ∥  y  ∥   p     ≤    ∥  x  ∥   q    .        superscript   def    subscript   norm   subscript  L  x     superscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  p        subscript  supremum   formulae-sequence    normal-y   superscript  normal-ℓ  normal-p      normal-y  0            subscript  normal-L  normal-x   normal-y     subscript   norm  normal-y   normal-p           subscript   norm  normal-x   normal-q      \|L_{x}\|_{(\ell^{p})^{*}}\stackrel{\rm{def}}{=}\sup_{y\in\ell^{p},y\not=0}%
 \frac{|L_{x}(y)|}{\|y\|_{p}}\leq\|x\|_{q}.   In fact, taking y to be the element of ℓ p with       y  n   =   {     0       if    x  n    =  0         x  n   -  1      |   x  n   |   q         if    x  n    ≠  0            subscript  y  n    cases  0      if   subscript  normal-x  normal-n    0      superscript   subscript  x  n     1     superscript     subscript  x  n    q        if   subscript  normal-x  normal-n    0      y_{n}=\begin{cases}0&\rm{if}\ x_{n}=0\\
 x_{n}^{-1}|x_{n}|^{q}&\rm{if}\ x_{n}\not=0\end{cases}   gives L x ( y ) = || x || q , so that in fact         ∥   L  x   ∥     (   ℓ  p   )   *    =    ∥  x  ∥   q    .       subscript   norm   subscript  L  x     superscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  p       subscript   norm  x   q     \|L_{x}\|_{(\ell^{p})^{*}}=\|x\|_{q}.   Conversely, given a bounded linear functional L on ℓ p , the sequence defined by x n = L ( e n ) lies in ℓ q . Thus the mapping    x  ↦   L  x      maps-to  x   subscript  L  x     x\mapsto L_{x}   gives an isometry        κ  q   :    ℓ  q   →    (   ℓ  p   )   *     .     normal-:   subscript  κ  q    normal-→   superscript  normal-ℓ  q    superscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  p        \kappa_{q}:\ell^{q}\to(\ell^{p})^{*}.     The map       ℓ  q    →   κ  q      (   ℓ  p   )   *    →    (   κ  q  *   )    -  1             subscript  κ  q   normal-→    superscript  normal-ℓ  q    superscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  p         superscript   superscript   subscript  κ  q       1    normal-→     absent     \ell^{q}\xrightarrow{\kappa_{q}}(\ell^{p})^{*}\xrightarrow{(\kappa_{q}^{*})^{-%
 1}}   obtained by composing κ p with the inverse of its transpose coincides with the canonical injection of ℓ q into its double dual . As a consequence ℓ q is a reflexive space . By abuse of notation , it is typical to identify ℓ q with the dual of ℓ p : (ℓ p ) * = ℓ q . Then reflexivity is understood by the sequence of identifications (ℓ p ) ** = (ℓ q ) * = ℓ p .  The space c 0 is defined as the space of all sequences converging to zero, with norm identical to || x || ∞ . It is a closed subspace of ℓ ∞ , hence a Banach space. The dual of c 0 is ℓ 1 ; the dual of ℓ 1 is ℓ ∞ . For the case of natural numbers index set, the ℓ p and c 0 are separable , with the sole exception of ℓ ∞ . The dual of ℓ ∞ is the ba space .  The spaces c 0 and ℓ p (for 1 ≤ p  i | i = 1, 2,…}, where e i is the sequence which is zero but for a 1 in the i th entry.  The space ℓ 1 has the Schur property : In ℓ 1 , any sequence that is weakly convergent is also strongly convergent . However, since the weak topology on infinite-dimensional spaces is strictly weaker than the strong topology , there are nets in ℓ 1 that are weak convergent but not strong convergent.  The ℓ p spaces can be embedded into many Banach spaces . The question of whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains an isomorph of some ℓ p or of c 0 , was answered negatively by B. S. Tsirelson 's construction of Tsirelson space in 1974. The dual statement, that every separable Banach space is linearly isometric to a quotient space of ℓ 1 , was answered in the affirmative by . That is, for every separable Banach space X , there exists a quotient map    Q  :    ℓ  1   →  X      normal-:  Q   normal-→   superscript  normal-ℓ  1   X     Q:\ell^{1}\to X   , so that X is isomorphic to     ℓ  1   /   ker  Q        superscript  normal-ℓ  1    kernel  Q     \ell^{1}/\ker Q   . In general, ker Q is not complemented in ℓ 1 , that is, there does not exist a subspace Y of ℓ 1 such that     ℓ  1   =   Y  ⊕   ker  Q         superscript  normal-ℓ  1    direct-sum  Y   kernel  Q      \ell^{1}=Y\oplus\ker Q   . In fact, ℓ 1 has uncountably many uncomplemented subspaces that are not isomorphic to one another (for example, take    X  =   ℓ  p       X   superscript  normal-ℓ  p     X=\ell^{p}   ; since there are uncountably many such X 's, and since no ℓ p is isomorphic to any other, there are thus uncountably many ker Q 's).  Except for the trivial finite-dimensional case, an unusual feature of ℓ p is that it is not polynomially reflexive .  ℓ p spaces are increasing in p  For    p  ∈   [  1  ,   +  ∞   ]       p   1         p\in[1,+\infty]   , the spaces    ℓ  p     superscript  normal-ℓ  p    \ell^{p}   are increasing in   p   p   p   , with    F  :=   f    ∥  f  ∥   p       assign  F    f   subscript   norm  f   p      F:=\frac{f}{\|f\|_{p}}   .  This follows from defining    f  ∈   ℓ  p       f   superscript  normal-ℓ  p     f\in\ell^{p}   for     |   F   (  m  )    |   ≤  1          F  m    1    |F(m)|\leq 1   , and noting that    m  ∈  ℕ      m  ℕ    m\in\mathbb{N}   for all      ∥  F  ∥   q  q   ≤  1       superscript   subscript   norm  F   q   q   1    \|F\|_{q}^{q}\leq 1   , which can be shown to imply $\|F\|_q^q\le1$ .
