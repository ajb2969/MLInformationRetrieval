<h1>Algebraic-group factorisation algorithm</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Algebraic-group factorisation algorithms</strong> are algorithms for <a href="Integer_factorization" title="wikilink">factoring an integer</a> <em>N</em> by working in an <a href="algebraic_group" title="wikilink">algebraic group</a> defined <a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">modulo</a> <em>N</em> whose group structure is the direct sum of the 'reduced groups' obtained by performing the equations defining the group arithmetic modulo the unknown prime factors <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, ... By the <a href="Chinese_remainder_theorem" title="wikilink">Chinese remainder theorem</a>, arithmetic modulo <em>N</em> corresponds to arithmetic in all the reduced groups simultaneously.</p>

<p>The aim is to find an element which is not the identity of the group modulo <em>N</em>, but is the identity modulo one of the factors, so a method for recognising such <em>one-sided identities</em> is required. In general, one finds them by performing operations that move elements around and leave the identities in the reduced groups unchanged. Once the algorithm finds a one-sided identity all future terms will also be one-sided identities, so checking periodically suffices.</p>

<p>Computation proceeds by picking an arbitrary element <em>x</em> of the group modulo <em>N</em> and computing a large and <a href="smooth_number" title="wikilink">smooth</a> multiple <em>Ax</em> of it; if the order of at least one but not all of the reduced groups is a divisor of A, this yields a factorisation. It need not be a prime factorisation, as the element might be an identity in more than one of the reduced groups.</p>

<p>Generally, A is taken as a product of the primes below some limit K, and <em>Ax</em> is computed by successive multiplication of <em>x</em> by these primes; after each multiplication, or every few multiplications, the check is made for a one-sided identity.</p>
<h2 id="the-two-step-procedure">The two-step procedure</h2>

<p>It is often possible to multiply a group element by several small integers more quickly than by their product, generally by difference-based methods; one calculates differences between consecutive primes and adds consecutively by the

. This means that a two-step procedure becomes sensible, first computing <em>Ax</em> by multiplying <em>x</em> by all the primes below a limit B1, and then examining <em>p Ax</em> for all the primes between B1 and a larger limit B2.</p>

<p>If the algebraic group is the <a href="multiplicative_group" title="wikilink">multiplicative group</a> mod <em>N</em>, the one-sided identities are recognised by computing <a href="greatest_common_divisor" title="wikilink">greatest common divisors</a> with <em>N</em>, and the result is the <a href="Pollard's_p-1_algorithm" title="wikilink"><em>p</em> − 1 method</a>.</p>

<p>If the algebraic group is the multiplicative group of a quadratic extension of <em>N</em>, the result is the <a href="Williams'_p_+_1_algorithm" title="wikilink"><em>p</em> + 1 method</a>; the calculation involves pairs of numbers modulo <em>N</em>. It is not possible to tell whether

 is actually a quadratic extension of <em>N</em> without knowing the factorisation. This requires knowing whether <em>t</em> is a <a href="quadratic_residue" title="wikilink">quadratic residue</a> modulo <em>N</em>, and there are no known methods for doing this without knowledge of the factorisation. However, provided <em>N</em> does not have a very large number of factors, in which case another method should be used first, picking random <em>t</em> (or rather picking <em>A</em> with <em>t</em> = <em>A</em><sup>2</sup> − 4) will accidentally hit a quadratic non-residue fairly quickly. If <em>t</em> is a quadratic residue, the p+1 method degenerates to a slower form of the <em>p</em> − 1 method.</p>

<p>If the algebraic group is an <a href="elliptic_curve" title="wikilink">elliptic curve</a>, the one-sided identities can be recognised by failure of <a href="inverse_function" title="wikilink">inversion</a> in the elliptic-curve point addition procedure, and the result is the <a href="elliptic_curve_method" title="wikilink">elliptic curve method</a>; <a href="Hasse's_theorem_on_elliptic_curves" title="wikilink">Hasse's theorem</a> states that the number of points on an elliptic curve modulo <em>p</em> is always within

 of <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>All three of the above algebraic groups are used by the <a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/ecm/">GMP-ECM</a> package, which includes efficient implementations of the two-stage procedure, and an implementation of the PRAC group-exponentiation algorithm which is rather more efficient than the standard <a href="binary_exponentiation" title="wikilink">binary exponentiation</a> approach.</p>

<p>The use of other algebraic groups—higher-order extensions of <em>N</em> or groups corresponding to algebraic curves of higher genus—is occasionally proposed, but almost always impractical. These methods end up with smoothness constraints on numbers of the order of <em>p</em><sup><em>d</em></sup> for some <em>d</em> &gt; 1, which are much less likely to be smooth than numbers of the order of <em>p</em>.</p>
