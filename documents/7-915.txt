   Hyperbolic equilibrium point      Hyperbolic equilibrium point   In the study of dynamical systems , a hyperbolic equilibrium point or hyperbolic fixed point is a fixed point that does not have any center manifolds . Near a hyperbolic point the orbits of a two-dimensional, non-dissipative system resemble hyperbolas. This fails to hold in general. Strogatz 1 notes that "hyperbolic is an unfortunate name – it sounds like it should mean ' saddle point ' – but it has become standard." Several properties hold about a neighborhood of a hyperbolic point, notably 2   A stable manifold and an unstable manifold exist,  Shadowing occurs,  The dynamics on the invariant set can be represented via symbolic dynamics ,  A natural measure can be defined,  The system is structurally stable .

Maps  If T : R n → R n is a C 1 map and p is a fixed point then p is said to be a hyperbolic fixed point when the Jacobian matrix  DT ( p ) has no eigenvalues on the unit circle.  One example of a map that its only fixed point is hyperbolic is the Arnold Map or cat map :       [      x   n  +  1         y   n  +  1       ]   =     [     1    1      1    2     ]    [      x  n        y  n      ]     modulo  1           subscript  x    n  1       subscript  y    n  1           1  1    1  2       subscript  x  n      subscript  y  n        modulo  1      \begin{bmatrix}x_{n+1}\\
 y_{n+1}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\
 1&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_{n}\\
 y_{n}\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{modulo }1     Since the eigenvalues are given by       λ  1   =    3  +   5    2   >  1         subscript  λ  1       3    5    2        1     \lambda_{1}=\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}>1          λ  2   =    3  -   5    2   <  1         subscript  λ  2       3    5    2        1     \lambda_{2}=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}<1     Flows  Let F : R n → R n be a C 1  vector field with a critical point p , i.e., F(p) = 0 , and let J denote the Jacobian matrix of F at p . If the matrix J has no eigenvalues with zero real parts then p is called hyperbolic . Hyperbolic fixed points may also be called hyperbolic critical points or elementary critical points . 3  The Hartman-Grobman theorem states that the orbit structure of a dynamical system in a neighbourhood of a hyperbolic equilibrium point is topologically equivalent to the orbit structure of the linearized dynamical system.  Example  Consider the nonlinear system         d  x    d  t    =  y   ,          d  x     d  t    y    \frac{dx}{dt}=y,            d  y    d  t    =    -  x   -   x  3   -   α  y     ,   α  ≠  0      formulae-sequence        d  y     d  t        x    superscript  x  3     α  y       α  0     \frac{dy}{dt}=-x-x^{3}-\alpha y,~{}\alpha\neq 0     (0, 0) is the only equilibrium point. The linearization at the equilibrium is       J   (  0  ,  0  )    =   (     0    1       -  1      -  α      )         J   0  0      0  1      1     α       J(0,0)=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 -1&-\alpha\end{pmatrix}   .  The eigenvalues of this matrix are      -  α   ±     α  2   -  4     2       plus-or-minus    α        superscript  α  2   4     2    \frac{-\alpha\pm\sqrt{\alpha^{2}-4}}{2}   . For all values of α ≠ 0, the eigenvalues have non-zero real part. Thus, this equilibrium point is a hyperbolic equilibrium point. The linearized system will behave similar to the non-linear system near (0, 0). When α = 0, the system has a nonhyperbolic equilibrium at (0, 0).  Comments  In the case of an infinite dimensional system - for example systems involving a time delay - the notion of the "hyperbolic part of the spectrum" refers to the above property.
