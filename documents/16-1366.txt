Draft:Multirate Filter Bank and Multidimensional Directional Filter Banks

Signal Processing is one of the important research fields that is used widely these days in different aspect of our lives. It is a wide area of research that extends from the simplest form of 1-D signal processing (e.g 1-D filters) to the complex form of M-D (e.g M-D filters and filter banks). In signal processing, a filter is used to removes some unwanted component or feature of a signal. A filter bank is an array of filters that separates the input signal into multiple components, each one carrying a single frequency sub-band of the original signal. Filter bank has a lot of applications these days. In filter banks the process of decomposition performed by the filter bank is called analysis and the reconstruction process is called synthesis. This article provides a short survey of the concepts, principles and applications of Multirate Filter Bank and Multidimensional Directional Filter Banks.
Multirate system
Linear time-invariant systems operate at a single sampling rate it means that we have the same sampling rate at input and output. In other words, in an LTI system, the sampling rate would not change in the system.
Systems that use different sampling rates at different stages are called the multirate systems. The multirate system can have different sampling rates based on desire. Also multirate system can provide different sampling rates without destroying the signal components. In Figure 1, you can see block diagram of a two channel multirate system.
Multirate Filtering
Multirate filtering works by dividing a signal into a number of subbands, which can be analysed in different rate corresponding to the bandwidth of the frequency bands. One important fact in multirate filtering is that signal should be filtered before decimation, otherwise aliasing and frequency folding would appears in our results. 
Multirate Filter Designs
Multirate Filter Designs basically works by using properties of decimation and interpolation (or expansion) in implementation of the filter. Decimation or downsampling by a factor of $M$ essentially means keeping every $M^{th}$ sample of a given sequence.
Decimation and Interpolation:
Generally speaking, using decimation is very common in multirate filter designs. In the second step, after using decimation interpolation will be used to restore the sampling rate. The advantage of using decimator and interpolator is that they need less computations comparing other methods (e.g. using the convolution of coefficients and input signal).
Decimation by a factor of $M$ can be mathematically defined as:1 ${x(n)}_{\downarrow{}M}=x(M.n)$ or equivalently, $X(z)_{\downarrow M}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}X(W_{M}^{m}.Z^{\frac{1}{M}})$ where $W^M=e^{-j\frac{2\pi{}}{M}}$
Expansion or upsampling by a factor of M means that we insert M-1 zeros between each sample of a given signal or a sequence. The expansion by a factor of M can be mathematically explained as: $x(n)_{\uparrow M}=\begin{cases}
 \begin{array}{c}
 x(\frac{n}{M})\\
 0
 \end{array} & \begin{array}{c}
 \frac{n}{M}\in N\\
 otherwise
 \end{array}\end{cases}$ or equivalently, ${X(z)}_{\uparrow{}M}=X(z^M)$
Modulation:
Modulation is needed for different kinds of filter designs. For instance, for implementing a bandpass filter we need to modulating the signal to baseband. After using lowpass filtering for baseband signal, we use modulation and change the baseband signal to the center frequency of the bandpass filter. Here we provide two examples of designing multirate narrow lowpass and narrow bandpass filters:
Narrow lowpass filter:
We can define a narrow lowpass filter as a lowpass filter with a narrow passband. In order to create a multirate narrow lowpass FIR filter, we need to replace the time invariant FIR filter with a lowpass antialiasing filter and use decimator by along with interpolator and lowpass anti-imaging filter. In this way the decimator and interpolator make the equivalent multirate system a time varying linear phase filter. This process explained in block diagram form where Figure 2 (a) is replaced by Figure 2(b). 
The lowpass filter consists of two polyphase filters, one for the decimator and one for the interpolator.
Narrow bandpass filter:
A narrow bandpass filter can be defined as a bandpass filter with a narrow passband. for implementing a narrow bandpass filter we need to use modulation approches. Figure 3 shows the block diagram of a multirate bandpass filter: 
We need to modulate the bandpass filter to change the center of the passband to the origin. The center of the passband represents by $\omega_{0}$. This process needs one lowpass filters for the real part and one for the imaginary part. Multirate lowpass filter design can be used to implementing each of the lowpass filters. In the next step modulation and combination will apply to create the output result. Finally, demodulation and combination of the results creates the frequency to the original position. Therefore, by two multirate lowpass filters a bandpass filter implemented (Figure 3(b)).
This method of modulating a signal to baseband, lowpass filtering and demodulation of the filtered signal is one of two fundamental methods for creating multirate filters. The advantage of this design is that: in general does not give a constant group delay.
Multirate Filter Bank:
Filter banks has different usage in many areas, such as signal and image compression, and processing. The main usage of using filter banks is that in this way we can divide the signal or system to several separate frequency domains.
A filter bank is divided the input signal $x\left(n\right)$ into a set of signals $x_{1}(n),x_{2}(n),x_{3}(n),...$. In this way each of the generated signals corresponds to a different region in the spectrum of $x\left(n\right)$. In this process it can be possible for the regions that overlaps (or not based on application). Figure 4 shows an example of a three band filter bank. The generated signals $x_{1}(n),x_{2}(n),x_{3}(n),...$ can be generated via a collection of set of bandpass filters with bandwidths $BW_{1},BW_{2},BW_{3},...$ and center frequencies $f_{c1},f_{c2},f_{c3},...$(respectively). 
Multirate filter bank use a single input signal and then produces multiple output of the signal by filtering and subsampling. In order to split the input signal into two or more signals (see Figure 5) an alysis-synthesis system can be used . In figure 5, only 4 sub-signals are used.
The signal would split with the help of four filters $H_{k}(z)$ for k =0,1,2,3 into 4 bands of the same bandwidths (In the analysis bank) and then each sub-signal is decimated by a factor of 4. In each band by dividing the signal in each band, we would have different signal characteristics as well as various number of bits.
The processing unit will use in order to save the input into memory. In all of aforementioned process the general purpose is reducing the data that can represents the original signal without having aliasing or losing the information. 
In synthesis section the filter will reconstruct the original signal is two steps: First, use interpolating the 4 sub-signals at the output of the processing unit by a factor of 4 and then filtered by 4 synthesis filters $F_{k}(z)$ for k = 0,1,2,3. Second, the outputs of these four filters are added.
Multidimensional Directional Filter Banks:
N-dimensional directional filter banks (NDFB) 2 can be used in capturing signals features and information. There are a number of studies regarding capturing signals informations is 2-D(e.g., steerable pyramid, the directional filter bank, 2-D directional wavelets, curvelets, complex wavelets, contourlets, and bandelets).
Bamberger and Smith 3 Proposed directional filter bank (DFB) and this topic developed and improved time to time by several authors. Directional Filter Banks is implemented via an l-level tree-structured decomposition. The first advantage of DFB is that not only it is not a redundant transform but also it offers perfect reconstruction. Another advantage of DFB is its directional-selectivity and efficient structure. This advantage makes DFB an appropriate approach for many signal and image processing usage.
Directional Filter Banks can be develope to higher dimensions. It can be use in 3-D to achieve the frequency sectioning 4. This kinds of filters can be used in selective filtering purposes to record and save signals information and features. Some other advantages of NDFB can be addressed as follow: Directional decomposition, Construction, Angular resolution, Perfect reconstruction, and Small redundancy.
