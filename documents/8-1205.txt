   Feller process      Feller process   In probability theory relating to stochastic processes , a Feller process is a particular kind of Markov process .  Definitions  Let X be a locally compact  topological space with a countable  base . Let C 0 ( X ) denote the space of all real-valued continuous functions on X that vanish at infinity , equipped with the sup-norm || f ||.  A Feller semigroup on C 0 ( X ) is a collection { T t } t ≥ 0 of positive linear maps from C 0 ( X ) to itself such that   || T t f || ≤ || f || for all t ≥ 0 and f in C 0 ( X ), i.e., it is a contraction (in the weak sense);  the semigroup property: T t + s = T t o T s for all s , t ≥ 0;  lim t → 0 || T t f − f || = 0 for every f in C 0 ( X ). Using the semigroup property, this is equivalent to the map T t f from t in [0,∞) to C 0 ( X ) being right continuous for every f .   Warning : This terminology is not uniform across the literature. In particular, the assumption that T t maps C 0 ( X ) into itself is replaced by some authors by the condition that it maps C b ( X ), the space of bounded continuous functions, into itself. The reason for this is twofold: first, it allows to include processes that enter "from infinity" in finite time. Second, it is more suitable to the treatment of spaces that are not locally compact and for which the notion of "vanishing at infinity" makes no sense.  A Feller transition function is a probability transition function associated with a Feller semigroup.  A Feller process is a Markov process with a Feller transition function.  Generator  Feller processes (or transition semigroups) can be described by their infinitesimal generator . A function f in C 0 is said to be in the domain of the generator if the uniform limit        A  f   =    lim   t  →  0        T  t   f   -  f   t     ,        A  f     subscript    normal-→  t  0           subscript  T  t   f   f   t      Af=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{T_{t}f-f}{t},     exists. The operator A is the generator of T t , and the space of functions on which it is defined is written as D A .  A characterization of operators that can occur as the infinitesimal generator of Feller processes is given by the Hille-Yosida theorem . This uses the resolvent of the Feller semigroup, defined below.  Resolvent  The resolvent of a Feller process (or semigroup) is a collection of maps ( R λ ) λ > 0 from C 0 ( X ) to itself defined by         R  λ   f   =    ∫  0  ∞     e   -   λ  t      T  t    f   d  t     .         subscript  R  λ   f     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e      λ  t      subscript  T  t   f  d  t      R_{\lambda}f=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\lambda t}T_{t}f\,dt.   It can be shown that it satisfies the identity         R  λ    R  μ    =    R  μ    R  λ    =    (    R  μ   -   R  λ    )   /   (   λ  -  μ   )     .           subscript  R  λ    subscript  R  μ       subscript  R  μ    subscript  R  λ              subscript  R  μ    subscript  R  λ      λ  μ       R_{\lambda}R_{\mu}=R_{\mu}R_{\lambda}=(R_{\mu}-R_{\lambda})/(\lambda-\mu).   Furthermore, for any fixed λ > 0, the image of R λ is equal to the domain D A of the generator A , and        R  λ   =    (   λ  -  A   )    -  1     ,       subscript  R  λ    superscript    λ  A     1      \displaystyle R_{\lambda}=(\lambda-A)^{-1},     Examples   Brownian motion and the Poisson process are examples of Feller processes. More generally, every Lévy process is a Feller process.    Bessel processes are Feller processes.    Solutions to stochastic differential equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients are Feller processes.    Every Feller process satisfies the strong Markov property . 1   See also   Markov process  Markov chain  Hunt process  Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     Liggett, Thomas Milton Continuous-time Markov processes: an introduction (page 93, Theorem 3.3) ↩
