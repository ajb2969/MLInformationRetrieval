   Phenylglyoxylate dehydrogenase (acylating)      Phenylglyoxylate dehydrogenase (acylating)   In enzymology , a phenylglyoxylate dehydrogenase (acylating ; ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phenylglyoxylate + NAD + + CoA-SH   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzoyl-S-CoA + CO 2 + NADH   The three substrates of this enzyme are phenylglyoxylate , NAD + , and CoA-SH , whereas its 3 products are benzoyl-S-CoA , CO 2 , and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylglyoxylate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . It has 3 cofactors : FAD , Thiamin diphosphate , and Iron-sulfur .
