Bekenstein bound

__NOTOC__ In physics, the Bekenstein bound is an upper limit on the entropy S, or information I, that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy—or conversely, the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level.1 It implies that the information of a physical system, or the information necessary to perfectly describe that system, must be finite if the region of space and the energy is finite. In computer science, this implies that there is a maximum information-processing rate (Bremermann's limit) for a physical system that has a finite size and energy, and that a Turing machine with finite physical dimensions and unbounded memory is not physically possible.
Equations
The universal form of the bound was originally found by Jacob Bekenstein as the inequality234



where S is the entropy, k is Boltzmann's constant, R is the radius of a sphere that can enclose the given system, E is the total mass–energy including any rest masses, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. Note that while gravity plays a significant role in its enforcement, the expression for the bound does not contain Newton's Constant G.
In informational terms, the bound is given by



where I is the information expressed in number of bits contained in the quantum states in the sphere. The ln 2 factor comes from defining the information as the logarithm to the base 2 of the number of quantum states.5 Using mass energy equivalence, the informational limit may be reformulated as



where 
 
 
 
  is the mass of the system in kilograms, and the radius 
 
 
 
  is expressed in meters.
Origins
Bekenstein derived the bound from heuristic arguments involving black holes. If a system exists that violates the bound, i.e. by having too much entropy, Bekenstein argued that it would be possible to violate the second law of thermodynamics by lowering it into a black hole. In 1995, Ted Jacobson demonstrated that the Einstein field equations (i.e., general relativity) can be derived by assuming that the Bekenstein bound and the laws of thermodynamics are true.67 However, while a number of arguments have been devised which show that some form of the bound must exist in order for the laws of thermodynamics and general relativity to be mutually consistent, the precise formulation of the bound has been a matter of debate.89101112131415161718
Examples
Black holes
It happens that the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy of three-dimensional black holes exactly saturates the bound



where A is the two-dimensional area of the black hole's event horizon in units of the Planck area, 
 
 
 
 .
The bound is closely associated with black hole thermodynamics, the holographic principle and the covariant entropy bound of quantum gravity, and can be derived from a conjectured strong form of the latter.
Human brain
An average human brain has a mass of 1.5 kg and a volume of 1260 cm³. If the brain is approximated by a sphere then the radius will be 6.7 cm.
The informational Bekenstein bound will be 
 
 
 
  bit and represents the maximum information needed to perfectly recreate an average human brain down to the quantum level. This means that the number 
 
 
 
  of states of the human brain must be less than 
 
 
 
 .
The existence of the Bekenstein bound implies that the storage capacity of human brain is finite, although potentially very large, if constrained only by ultimate physical limits. This makes mind uploading possible from the point of view of quantum mechanics, provided that physicalism is true.
