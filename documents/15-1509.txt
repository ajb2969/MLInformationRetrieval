Lipid IVA 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid transferase

Lipid IVA 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid transferase (, KDO transferase, waaA (gene), kdtA (gene), 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid transferase, 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonic acid transferase, lipid IVA KDO transferase) is an enzyme with system name CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonate:lipid IVA 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonate transferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

lipid IVA + CMP-alpha-Kdo 
 
 
 
  alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + CMP
 

The bifunctional enzyme from Escherichia coli transfers two 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonate residues to lipid IVA.
