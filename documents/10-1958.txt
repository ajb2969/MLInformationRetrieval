Citryl-CoA lyase




Citryl-CoA lyase

In enzymology, a citryl-CoA lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(3S)-citryl-CoA 
 
 
 
  acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (3S)-citryl-CoA, and two products, acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3S)-citryl-CoA oxaloacetate-lyase (acetyl-CoA-forming). This enzyme is also called (3S)-citryl-CoA oxaloacetate-lyase. This enzyme participates in citrate cycle (tca cycle).
