Vinorine synthase




Vinorine synthase

In enzymology, a vinorine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + 16-epivellosimine 
 
 
 
  CoA + vinorine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and 16-epivellosimine, whereas its two products are CoA and vinorine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:16-epivellosimine O-acetyltransferase (cyclizing). This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
