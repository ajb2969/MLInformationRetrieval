   Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma      Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma   In axiomatic set theory , the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma (named after Helena Rasiowa and Roman Sikorski ) is one of the most fundamental facts used in the technique of forcing . In the area of forcing, a subset D of a forcing notion ( P , ≤) is called dense in P if for any p ∈ P there is d ∈ D with d ≤ p . A filter  F in P is called D - generic if   F ∩ E ≠ ∅ for all E ∈ D .   Now we can state the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma :   Let ( P , ≤) be a poset and p ∈ P . If D is a countable family of dense subsets of P then there exists a D -generic filter  F in P such that p ∈ F .   Proof of the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma  The proof runs as follows: since D is countable, one can enumerate the dense subsets of P as D 1 , D 2 , …. By assumption, there exists p ∈ P . Then by density, there exists p 1 ≤ p with p 1 ∈ D 1 . Repeating, one gets … ≤ p 2 ≤ p 1 ≤ p with p i ∈ D i . Then G = { q ∈ P : ∃ i , q ≥ p i } is a D -generic filter.  The Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma can be viewed as a weaker form of an equivalent to Martin's axiom . More specifically, it is equivalent to MA(    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   ).  Examples   For ( P , ≥) = (Func( X , Y ), ⊂), the poset of partial functions from X to Y , define D x = { s ∈ P : x ∈ dom( s )}. If X is countable, the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma yields a { D x : x ∈ X }-generic filter F and thus a function ∪ F : X → Y .  If we adhere to the notation used in dealing with D - generic filters , { H ∪ G 0 : P ij P t } forms an H - generic filter .  If D is uncountable, but of cardinality strictly smaller than    2   ℵ  0      superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     2^{\aleph_{0}}   and the poset has the countable chain condition , we can instead use Martin's axiom .
