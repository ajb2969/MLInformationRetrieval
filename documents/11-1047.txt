   Zeatin 9-aminocarboxyethyltransferase      Zeatin 9-aminocarboxyethyltransferase   In enzymology , a zeatin 9-aminocarboxyethyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   O-acetyl-L-serine + zeatin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   lupinate + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are O-acetyl-L-serine and zeatin , whereas its two products are lupinate and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O3-acetyl-L-serine:zeatin 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase . Other names in common use include beta-(9-cytokinin)-alanine synthase , beta-(9-cytokinin)alanine synthase , O-acetyl-L-serine acetate-lyase (adding N6-substituted adenine) , lupinate synthetase , lupinic acid synthase , lupinic acid synthetase , and 3-O-acetyl-L-serine:zeatin 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase .
