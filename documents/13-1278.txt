   Distortion (mathematics)      Distortion (mathematics)   In mathematics , the distortion is a measure of the amount by which a function from the Euclidean plane to itself distorts circles to ellipses. If the distortion of a function is equal to one, then it is conformal ; if the distortion is bounded and the function is a homeomorphism , then it is quasiconformal . The distortion of a function ƒ of the plane is given by       H   (  z  ,  f  )    =    lim sup   r  →  0       max    |  h  |   =  r     |    f   (   z  +  h   )    -   f   (  z  )     |      min    |  h  |   =  r     |    f   (   z  +  h   )    -   f   (  z  )     |            H   z  f      subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  r  0        subscript       h   r          f    z  h      f  z        subscript       h   r          f    z  h      f  z          H(z,f)=\limsup_{r\to 0}\frac{\max_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(z)|}{\min_{|h|=r}|f(z+h)-f(%
 z)|}     which is the limiting eccentricity of the ellipse produced by applying ƒ to small circles centered at z . This geometrical definition is often very difficult to work with, and the necessary analytical features can be extrapolated to the following definition. A mapping ƒ : Ω → R 2 from an open domain in the plane to the plane has finite distortion at a point x ∈ Ω if ƒ is in the Sobolev space W(Ω, R 2 ), the Jacobian determinant J( x ,ƒ) is locally integrable and does not change sign in Ω, and there is a measurable function K ( x ) ≥ 1 such that        |   D  f   (  x  )    |   2   ≤   K   (  x  )    |   J   (  x  ,  f  )    |         superscript      D  f  x    2     K  x      J   x  f        |Df(x)|^{2}\leq K(x)|J(x,f)|\,     almost everywhere. Here Df is the weak derivative of ƒ, and | Df | is the Hilbert–Schmidt norm .  For functions on a higher-dimensional Euclidean space  R n , there are more measures of distortion because there are more than two principal axes of a symmetric tensor. The pointwise information is contained in the distortion tensor       G   (  x  ,  f  )    =   {      |  J    (  x  ,  f  )    -   2  /  n      D  T   f   (  x  )   D  f   (  x  )        if  J   (  x  ,  f  )    ≠  0       I      if  J   (  x  ,  f  )    =  0.             G   x  f     cases   fragments  normal-|  J   superscript   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  f  normal-)       2  n      superscript  D  T   f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   D  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)        if  J   x  f    0   I      if  J   x  f    0.      G(x,f)=\begin{cases}|J(x,f)^{-2/n}D^{T}f(x)Df(x)&\text{if }J(x,f)\not=0\\
 I&\text{if }J(x,f)=0.\end{cases}     The outer distortion K O and inner distortion K I are defined via the Rayleigh quotients          K  O    (  x  )    =    sup   ξ  ≠  0       ⟨   G   (  x  )   ξ   ,  ξ  ⟩    n  /  2      |  ξ  |   n      ,     K  O    (  x  )    =    sup   ξ  ≠  0       ⟨    G   -  1     (  x  )   ξ   ,  ξ  ⟩    n  /  2      |  ξ  |   n       .     formulae-sequence       subscript  K  O   x     subscript  supremum    ξ  0       superscript     G  x  ξ   ξ     n  2     superscript    ξ   n           subscript  K  O   x     subscript  supremum    ξ  0       superscript      superscript  G    1    x  ξ   ξ     n  2     superscript    ξ   n        K_{O}(x)=\sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|\xi|^{n}},%
 \quad K_{O}(x)=\sup_{\xi\not=0}\frac{\langle G^{-1}(x)\xi,\xi\rangle^{n/2}}{|%
 \xi|^{n}}.     The outer distortion can also be characterized by means of an inequality similar to that given in the two-dimensional case. If Ω is an open set in R n , then a function has finite distortion if its Jacobian is locally integrable and does not change sign, and there is a measurable function K O (the outer distortion) such that        |   D  f   (  x  )    |   n   ≤    K  O    (  x  )    |   J   (  x  ,  f  )    |         superscript      D  f  x    n      subscript  K  O   x      J   x  f        |Df(x)|^{n}\leq K_{O}(x)|J(x,f)|\,     almost everywhere.
