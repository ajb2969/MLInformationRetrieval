   Brocard's conjecture      Brocard's conjecture   In number theory , Brocard's conjecture is a conjecture that there are at least four prime numbers between ( p n ) 2 and ( p n +1 ) 2 , for n > 1, where p n is the n th prime number. 1 It is widely believed that this conjecture is true. However, it remains unproven as of March 2015.      n       p  n     subscript  p  n    p_{n}          p  n  2     superscript   subscript  p  n   2    p_{n}^{2}      Prime numbers      Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta          1   2   4   5, 7   2     2   3   9   11, 13, 17, 19, 23   5     3   5   25   29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47   6     4   7   49   53, 59, 61, 67, 71…   15     5   11   121   127, 131, 137, 139, 149…   9        Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   stands for     π   (   p   n  +  1   2   )    -   π   (   p  n  2   )          π   superscript   subscript  p    n  1    2      π   superscript   subscript  p  n   2      \pi(p_{n+1}^{2})-\pi(p_{n}^{2})   .     The number of primes between prime squares is 2, 5, 6, 15, 9, 22, 11, 27, ... .  Legendre's conjecture that there is a prime between consecutive integer squares directly implies that there are at least two primes between prime squares for p n ≥ 3 since p n +1 - p n ≥ 2.
