   Boundary parallel      Boundary parallel   In mathematics , a closed  n - manifold  N  embedded in an ( n + 1)-manifold M is boundary parallel (or ∂-parallel , or peripheral ) if there is an isotopy of N onto a boundary  component of M .  An example  Consider the annulus     I  ×   S  1       I   superscript  S  1     I\times S^{1}   . Let π denote the projection map       π  :     I  ×   S  1    →   S  1    ,    (  x  ,  z  )   ↦  z     .     normal-:  π   formulae-sequence   normal-→    I   superscript  S  1     superscript  S  1     maps-to   x  z   z      \pi:I\times S^{1}\rightarrow S^{1},\qquad(x,z)\mapsto z.     If a circle S is embedded into the annulus so that π restricted to S is a bijection , then S is boundary parallel. (The converse is not true.)  If, on the other hand, a circle S is embedded into the annulus so that π restricted to S is not surjective , then S is not boundary parallel. (Again, the converse is not true.)
