Yahalom (protocol)

Yahalom is an authentication and secure key-sharing protocol designed for use on an insecure network such as the Internet. Yahalom uses a trusted arbitrator to distribute a shared key between two people. This protocol can be considered as an improved version of Wide Mouth Frog protocol (with additional protection against man-in-the-middle attack), but less secure than Needham-Schroeder.
Protocol description
If Alice (A) initiates the communication to Bob (B) with S is a server trusted by both parties, the protocol can be specified as follows using security protocol notation:

A and B are identities of Alice and Bob respectively


 
  is a symmetric key known only to A and S


 
  is a symmetric key known only to B and S


 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are nonces generated by A and B respectively


 
  is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key of the session between A and B





Alice sends a message to Bob requesting communication.
 





Bob sends a message to the Server encrypted under 
 
 
 
 .
 





The Server sends to Alice a message containing the generated session key 
 
 
 
  and a message to be forwarded to Bob.
 





Alice forwards the message to Bob and verifies 
 
 
 
  has not changed. Bob will verify 
 
 
 
  has not changed when he receives the message.
