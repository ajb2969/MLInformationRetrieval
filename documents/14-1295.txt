   Dual Hahn polynomials      Dual Hahn polynomials   In mathematics, the dual Hahn polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. They are defined in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions by         R  n    (   λ   (  x  )    ;  γ  ,  δ  ,  N  )    =    F  2    3     (   -  n   ,   -  x   ,   x  +  γ  +  δ  +  1   ;   γ  +  1   ,   -  N   ;  1  )     .         subscript  R  n      λ  x   γ  δ  N       subscript   subscript  F  2   3      n     x     x  γ  δ  1     γ  1     N   1      R_{n}(\lambda(x);\gamma,\delta,N)={}_{3}F_{2}(-n,-x,x+\gamma+\delta+1;\gamma+1%

Closely related polynomials include the Hahn polynomials , the continuous Hahn polynomials  p n ( x , a , b ,    a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \overline{a}   ,    b  ¯     normal-¯  b    \overline{b}   ), and the continuous dual Hahn polynomials  S n ( x ; a , b , c ). These polynomials all have q -analogs with an extra parameter q , such as the q-Hahn polynomials  Q n ( x ;α,β, N ; q ), and so on.
