L-sorbose oxidase

In enzymology, a L-sorbose oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-sorbose + O2

 
  5-dehydro-D-fructose + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-sorbose and O2, whereas its two products are 5-dehydro-D-fructose and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-sorbose:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase.
