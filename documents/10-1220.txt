   L-sorbose oxidase      L-sorbose oxidase   In enzymology , a L-sorbose oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-sorbose + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-dehydro-D-fructose + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-sorbose and O 2 , whereas its two products are 5-dehydro-D-fructose and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-sorbose:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
