He received his Ph.D. in 1944 from University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Hans Rademacher . He is known for obtaining the following results in 1976, assuming the Riemann hypothesis :       |    π   (  x  )    -   li   (  x  )     |   ≤      x     ln  x     8  π              π  x     li  x           x     x      8  π      |\pi(x)-{\rm li}(x)|\leq\frac{\sqrt{x}\,\ln x}{8\pi}     for all x ≥ 2657, based on the prime-counting function  π ( x ) and the logarithmic integral function li( x ), and       |    ψ   (  x  )    -  x   |   ≤      x      ln  2   x     8  π              ψ  x   x          x     superscript   2   x      8  π      |\psi(x)-x|\leq\frac{\sqrt{x}\,\ln^{2}x}{8\pi}     for all x ≥ 73.2, based on the second Chebyshev function  ψ ( x ). 1  His Erdős number is 2.
