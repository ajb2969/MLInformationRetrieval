   Stationary set      Stationary set   In mathematics , particularly in set theory and model theory , there are at least three notions of stationary set :  Classical notion  If    Œ∫    Œ∫   \kappa\,   is a cardinal of uncountable cofinality ,     S  ‚äÜ   Œ∫    ,      S  Œ∫    S\subseteq\kappa\,,   and    S    S   S\,    intersects every club set in     Œ∫  ,     Œ∫   \kappa\,,   then    S    S   S\,   is called a stationary set . 1 If a set is not stationary, then it is called a thin set . This notion should not be confused with the notion of a thin set in number theory .  If    S    S   S\,   is a stationary set and    C    C   C\,   is a club set, then their intersection    S  ‚à©   C       S  C    S\cap C\,   is also stationary. This is because if    D    D   D\,   is any club set, then    C  ‚à©   D       C  D    C\cap D\,   is a club set, thus      (   S  ‚à©  C   )   ‚à©  D   =   S  ‚à©   (   C  ‚à©  D   )            S  C   D     S    C  D      (S\cap C)\cap D=S\cap(C\cap D)\,   is non empty. Therefore    (   S  ‚à©  C   )      S  C    (S\cap C)\,   must be stationary.  See also : Fodor's lemma  The restriction to uncountable cofinality is in order to avoid trivialities: Suppose   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   has countable cofinality. Then    S  ‚äÇ  Œ∫      S  Œ∫    S\subset\kappa   is stationary in   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   if and only if    Œ∫  ‚àñ  S      Œ∫  S    \kappa\setminus S   is bounded in   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   . In particular, if the cofinality of   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is    œâ  =   ‚Ñµ  0       œâ   subscript  normal-‚Ñµ  0     \omega=\aleph_{0}   , then any two stationary subsets of   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   have stationary intersection.  This is no longer the case if the cofinality of   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is uncountable. In fact, suppose   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is regular and    S  ‚äÇ  Œ∫      S  Œ∫    S\subset\kappa   is stationary. Then   S   S   S   can be partitioned into   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   many disjoint stationary sets. This result is due to Solovay . If   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   is a successor cardinal , this result is due to Ulam and is easily shown by means of what is called an Ulam matrix .  H. Friedman has shown that for every countable successor ordinal   Œ≤   Œ≤   \beta   , every stationary subset of    œâ  1     subscript  œâ  1    \omega_{1}   contains a closed subset of order type   Œ≤   Œ≤   \beta   (Friedman).  Jech's notion  There is also a notion of stationary subset of     [  X  ]   Œª     superscript   delimited-[]  X   Œª    [X]^{\lambda}   , for   Œª   Œª   \lambda   a cardinal and   X   X   X   a set such that     |  X  |   ‚â•  Œª        X   Œª    |X|\geq\lambda   , where     [  X  ]   Œª     superscript   delimited-[]  X   Œª    [X]^{\lambda}   is the set of subsets of   X   X   X   of cardinality   Œª   Œª   \lambda         [  X  ]   Œª   =   {   Y  ‚äÇ  X   :    |  Y  |   =  Œª   }        superscript   delimited-[]  X   Œª    conditional-set    Y  X       Y   Œª      [X]^{\lambda}=\{Y\subset X:|Y|=\lambda\}   . This notion is due to Thomas Jech . As before,    S  ‚äÇ    [  X  ]   Œª       S   superscript   delimited-[]  X   Œª     S\subset[X]^{\lambda}   is stationary if and only if it meets every club, where a club subset of     [  X  ]   Œª     superscript   delimited-[]  X   Œª    [X]^{\lambda}   is a set unbounded under   ‚äÇ     \subset   and closed under union of chains of length at most   Œª   Œª   \lambda   . These notions are in general different, although for    X  =   œâ  1       X   subscript  œâ  1     X=\omega_{1}   and    Œª  =   ‚Ñµ  0       Œª   subscript  normal-‚Ñµ  0     \lambda=\aleph_{0}   they coincide in the sense that    S  ‚äÇ    [   œâ  1   ]   œâ       S   superscript   delimited-[]   subscript  œâ  1    œâ     S\subset[\omega_{1}]^{\omega}   is stationary if and only if    S  ‚à©   œâ  1       S   subscript  œâ  1     S\cap\omega_{1}   is stationary in    œâ  1     subscript  œâ  1    \omega_{1}   .  The appropriate version of Fodor's lemma also holds for this notion.  Generalized notion  There is yet a third notion, model theoretic in nature and sometimes referred to as generalized stationarity. This notion is probably due to Magidor , Foreman and Shelah and has also been used prominently by Woodin .  Now let   X   X   X   be a nonempty set. A set    C  ‚äÇ   ùí´   (  X  )        C    ùí´  X     C\subset{\mathcal{P}}(X)   is club (closed and unbounded) if and only if there is a function    F  :     [  X  ]     <  œâ    ‚Üí  X      normal-:  F   normal-‚Üí   superscript   delimited-[]  X     absent  œâ    X     F:[X]^{<\omega}\to X   such that    C  =   {  z  :    F   [    [  z  ]     <  œâ    ]    ‚äÇ  z   }       C   conditional-set  z      F   delimited-[]   superscript   delimited-[]  z     absent  œâ      z      C=\{z:F[[z]^{<\omega}]\subset z\}   . Here,     [  y  ]     <  œâ      superscript   delimited-[]  y     absent  œâ     [y]^{<\omega}   is the collection of finite subsets of   y   y   y   .      S  ‚äÇ   ùí´   (  X  )        S    ùí´  X     S\subset{\mathcal{P}}(X)   is stationary in    ùí´   (  X  )       ùí´  X    {\mathcal{P}}(X)   if and only if it meets every club subset of    ùí´   (  X  )       ùí´  X    {\mathcal{P}}(X)   .  To see the connection with model theory, notice that if   M   M   M   is a structure with universe    X   X   X   in a countable language and   F   F   F   is a Skolem function for   M   M   M   , then a stationary   S   S   S   must contain an elementary substructure of   M   M   M   . In fact,    S  ‚äÇ   ùí´   (  X  )        S    ùí´  X     S\subset{\mathcal{P}}(X)   is stationary if and only if for any such structure   M   M   M   there is an elementary substructure of   M   M   M   that belongs to   S   S   S   .
