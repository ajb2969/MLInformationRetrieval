Riesz sequence

In mathematics, a sequence of vectors (xn) in a Hilbert space

 
  is called a Riesz sequence if there exist constants


for all sequences of scalars (an) in the ℓp space ℓ2. A Riesz sequence is called a Riesz basis if


 
  .
Theorems
If H is a finite-dimensional space, then every basis of H is a Riesz basis.
Let φ be in the Lp space L2(R), let



and let 
 
 
 
  denote the Fourier transform of φ. Define constants c and C with $0.  Then the following are equivalent:
 
 :
$$2. \quad c\leq\sum_{n}\left|\hat{\varphi}(\omega + 2\pi n)\right|^2\leq C$$
The first of the above conditions is the definition for (φn) to form a Riesz basis for the space it spans.
