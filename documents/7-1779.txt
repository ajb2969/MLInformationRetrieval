   Riesz sequence      Riesz sequence   In mathematics , a sequence of vectors ( x n ) in a Hilbert space     (  H  ,   ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩   )     H   normal-⋅  normal-⋅     (H,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)   is called a Riesz sequence if there exist constants       span   (   x  n   )    ¯   =  H       normal-¯   span   subscript  x  n     H    \overline{\mathop{\rm span}(x_{n})}=H     for all sequences of scalars ( a n ) in the ℓ p space ℓ 2 . A Riesz sequence is called a Riesz basis if        ϕ  n    (  x  )    =   ϕ   (   x  -  n   )           subscript  ϕ  n   x     ϕ    x  n      \phi_{n}(x)=\phi(x-n)   .  Theorems  If H is a finite-dimensional space, then every basis of H is a Riesz basis.  Let φ be in the L p space  L 2 ( R ), let      φ  ^     normal-^  φ    \hat{\varphi}     and let     2.  c   ≤    ∑  n     |    φ  ^    (   ω  +   2  π  n    )    |   2    ≤  C         2.  c     subscript   n    superscript       normal-^  φ     ω    2  π  n      2         C     2.\quad c\leq\sum_{n}\left|\hat{\varphi}(\omega+2\pi n)\right|^{2}\leq C   denote the Fourier transform of φ . Define constants c and C with $0 .  Then the following are equivalent:
 
 : 1. \quad \forall (a_n) \in \ell^2,\ \ c\left( \sum_n | a_n|^2 \right) \leq \left\Vert \sum_n a_n \varphi_n \right\Vert^2 \leq C \left( \sum_n | a_n|^2 \right)$  $$2. \quad c\leq\sum_{n}\left|\hat{\varphi}(\omega + 2\pi n)\right|^2\leq C$$  The first of the above conditions is the definition for ( φ n ) to form a Riesz basis for the space it spans .
