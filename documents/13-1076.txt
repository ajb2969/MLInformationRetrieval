   Idealizer      Idealizer   In abstract algebra , the idealizer of a subsemigroup T of a semigroup  S is the largest subsemigroup of S in which T is an ideal . Such an idealizer is given by        𝕀  S    (  T  )    =   {   s  ∈  S   ∣    s  T   ⊆   T  and  T  s   ⊆  T   }          subscript  𝕀  S   T    conditional-set    s  S         s  T     T  and  T  s        T       \mathbb{I}_{S}(T)=\{s\in S\mid sT\subseteq T\text{ and }Ts\subseteq T\}     In ring theory , if A is an additive subgroup of a ring  R , then     𝕀  R    (  A  )        subscript  𝕀  R   A    \mathbb{I}_{R}(A)   (defined in the multiplicative semigroup of R ) is the largest subring of R in which A is a two-sided ideal.  In Lie algebra , if L is a Lie ring (or Lie algebra ) with Lie product [ x , y ], and S is an additive subgroup of L , then the set      {   r  ∈  L   ∣    [  r  ,  S  ]   ⊆  S   }     conditional-set    r  L      r  S   S     \{r\in L\mid[r,S]\subseteq S\}     is classically called the normalizer of S , however it is apparent that this set is actually the Lie ring equivalent of the idealizer. It is not necessary to mention that [ S , r ]⊆ S , because anticommutativity of the Lie product causes [ s , r ] = −[ r , s ]∈ S . The Lie "normalizer" of S is the largest subring of S in which S is a Lie ideal.  Comments  Often, when right or left ideals are the additive subgroups of R of interest, the idealizer is defined more simply by taking advantage of the fact that multiplication by ring elements is already absorbed on one side. Explicitly,        𝕀  R    (  T  )    =   {   r  ∈  R   ∣    r  T   ⊆  T   }          subscript  𝕀  R   T    conditional-set    r  R       r  T   T      \mathbb{I}_{R}(T)=\{r\in R\mid rT\subseteq T\}   if T is a right ideal, or        𝕀  R    (  L  )    =   {   r  ∈  R   ∣    L  r   ⊆  L   }          subscript  𝕀  R   L    conditional-set    r  R       L  r   L      \mathbb{I}_{R}(L)=\{r\in R\mid Lr\subseteq L\}   if L is a left ideal.  In commutative algebra , the idealizer is related to a more general construction. Given a commutative ring R , and given two subsets A and B of an R module M , the conductor or transporter is given by       (  A  :  B  )   :=   {  r  ∈  R  ∣  B  r  ⊆  A  }      fragments   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-:  B  normal-)   assign   fragments  normal-{  r   R  normal-∣  B  r   A  normal-}     (A:B):=\{r\in R\mid Br\subseteq A\}   . In terms of this conductor notation, an additive subgroup B of R has idealizer       𝕀  R    (  B  )   =   (  B  :  B  )      fragments   subscript  𝕀  R    fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  B  normal-:  B  normal-)     \mathbb{I}_{R}(B)=(B:B)   .  When A and B are ideals of R , the conductor is part of the structure of the residuated lattice of ideals of R .   Examples   The multiplier algebra  M ( A ) of a C * -algebra A is isomorphic to the idealizer of π ( A ) where π is any faithful nondegenerate representation of A on a Hilbert space  H .
