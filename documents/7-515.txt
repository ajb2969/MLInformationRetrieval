   Brillouin and Langevin functions      Brillouin and Langevin functions   The Brillouin and Langevin functions are a pair of special functions that appear when studying an idealized paramagnetic material in statistical mechanics .  Brillouin function  The Brillouin function 1 2 is a special function defined by the following equation:         B  J    (  x  )    =       2  J   +  1    2  J     coth   (      2  J   +  1    2  J    x   )     -    1   2  J     coth   (    1   2  J    x   )             subscript  B  J   x             2  J   1     2  J     hyperbolic-cotangent          2  J   1     2  J    x         1    2  J     hyperbolic-cotangent      1    2  J    x        B_{J}(x)=\frac{2J+1}{2J}\coth\left(\frac{2J+1}{2J}x\right)-\frac{1}{2J}\coth%
 \left(\frac{1}{2J}x\right)      The function is usually applied (see below) in the context where x is a real variable and J is a positive integer or half-integer. In this case, the function varies from -1 to 1, approaching +1 as    x  →   +  ∞      normal-→  x        x\to+\infty   and -1 as    x  →   -  ∞      normal-→  x        x\to-\infty   .  The function is best known for arising in the calculation of the magnetization of an ideal paramagnet . In particular, it describes the dependency of the magnetization   M   M   M   on the applied magnetic field    B   B   B   and the total angular momentum quantum number J of the microscopic magnetic moments of the material. The magnetization is given by: 3      M  =     N  g   μ  B   J   ⋅   B  J     (  x  )        M     normal-⋅    N  g   subscript  μ  B   J    subscript  B  J    x     M=Ng\mu_{B}J\cdot B_{J}(x)     where      N   N   N   is the number of atoms per unit volume,     g   g   g   the g-factor ,      μ  B     subscript  μ  B    \mu_{B}   the Bohr magneton ,     x   x   x   is the ratio of the Zeeman energy of the magnetic moment in the external field to the thermal energy     k  B   T       subscript  k  B   T    k_{B}T   :         x  =    g   μ  B   J  B     k  B   T        x      g   subscript  μ  B   J  B      subscript  k  B   T      x=\frac{g\mu_{B}JB}{k_{B}T}             k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is the Boltzmann constant and   T   T   T   the temperature.   Note that in the SI system of units   B   B   B   given in Tesla stands for the magnetic field ,    B  =    μ  0   H       B     subscript  μ  0   H     B=\mu_{0}H   , where   H   H   H   is the auxiliary magnetic field given in A/m and    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is the permeability of vacuum .        Click "show" to see a derivation of this law:       A derivation of this law describing the magnetization of an ideal paramagnet is as follows. 4 Let z be the direction of the magnetic field. The z-component of the angular momentum of each magnetic moment (a.k.a. the azimuthal quantum number ) can take on one of the 2J+1 possible values -J,-J+1,...,+J. Each of these has a different energy, due to the external field B : The energy associated with quantum number m is       E  m   =   -   m  g   μ  B   B    =   -     k  B   T  x  m   /  J           subscript  E  m       m  g   subscript  μ  B   B                subscript  k  B   T  x  m   J       E_{m}=-mg\mu_{B}B=-k_{B}Txm/J   (where g is the g-factor , μ B is the Bohr magneton , and x is as defined in the text above). The relative probability of each of these is given by the Boltzmann factor :       P   (  m  )    =    e   -    E  m   /   (    k  B   T   )      /  Z   =    e    x  m   /  J    /  Z           P  m      superscript  e       subscript  E  m      subscript  k  B   T      Z           superscript  e      x  m   J    Z      P(m)=e^{-E_{m}/(k_{B}T)}/Z=e^{xm/J}/Z   where Z (the partition function ) is a normalization constant such that the probabilities sum to unity. Calculating Z , the result is:       P   (  m  )    =    e    x  m   /  J    /   (    ∑    m  ′   =   -  J    J    e    x   m  ′    /  J     )          P  m      superscript  e      x  m   J      superscript   subscript      superscript  m  normal-′     J     J    superscript  e      x   superscript  m  normal-′    J        P(m)=e^{xm/J}/\left(\sum_{m^{\prime}=-J}^{J}e^{xm^{\prime}/J}\right)   . All told, the expectation value of the azimuthal quantum number m is       ⟨  m  ⟩   =      (   -  J   )   ×  P    (   -  J   )    +  ⋯  +    J  ×  P    (  J  )     =    (    ∑   m  =   -  J    J    m   e    x  m   /  J      )   /   (    ∑   m  =   -  J    J    e    x  m   /  J     )           delimited-⟨⟩  m           J   P     J    normal-⋯      J  P   J             superscript   subscript     m    J     J     m   superscript  e      x  m   J        superscript   subscript     m    J     J    superscript  e      x  m   J         \langle m\rangle=(-J)\times P(-J)+\cdots+J\times P(J)=\left(\sum_{m=-J}^{J}me^%
 {xm/J}\right)/\left(\sum_{m=-J}^{J}e^{xm/J}\right)   . The denominator is a geometric series and the numerator is a type of arithmetic-geometric series , so the series can be explicitly summed. After some algebra, the result turns out to be       ⟨  m  ⟩   =   J   B  J    (  x  )         delimited-⟨⟩  m     J   subscript  B  J   x     \langle m\rangle=JB_{J}(x)   With N magnetic moments per unit volume, the magnetization density is      M  =   N  g   μ  B    ⟨  m  ⟩    =   N  g  J   μ  B    B  J    (  x  )          M    N  g   subscript  μ  B    delimited-⟨⟩  m           N  g  J   subscript  μ  B    subscript  B  J   x      M=Ng\mu_{B}\langle m\rangle=NgJ\mu_{B}B_{J}(x)   .        Langevin function  (Figure)  Langevin function (blue line), compared with    tanh   (   x  /  3   )         x  3     \tanh(x/3)   (magenta line).   In the classical limit, the moments can be continuously aligned in the field and   J   J   J   can assume all values (    J  →  ∞     normal-→  J     J\to\infty   ). The Brillouin function is then simplified into the Langevin function , named after Paul Langevin :        L   (  x  )    =    coth   (  x  )    -   1  x          L  x      hyperbolic-cotangent  x     1  x      L(x)=\coth(x)-\frac{1}{x}      For small values of   x   x   x   , the Langevin function can be approximated by a truncation of its Taylor series :       L   (  x  )    =         1  3    x   -     1  45     x  3     +     2  945     x  5     -     1  4725     x  7     +  …         L  x               1  3   x       1  45    superscript  x  3         2  945    superscript  x  5         1  4725    superscript  x  7     normal-…     L(x)=\tfrac{1}{3}x-\tfrac{1}{45}x^{3}+\tfrac{2}{945}x^{5}-\tfrac{1}{4725}x^{7}+\dots   An alternative better behaved approximation can be derived from the Lambert's continued fraction expansion of    t  a  n  h   (  x  )       t  a  n  h  x    tanh(x)   :       L   (  x  )    =   x   3  +    x  2    5  +     x  2    7  +     x  2    9  +  …                  L  x     x    3     superscript  x  2     5     superscript  x  2     7     superscript  x  2     9  normal-…            L(x)=\frac{x}{3+\tfrac{x^{2}}{5+\tfrac{x^{2}}{7+\tfrac{x^{2}}{9+\ldots}}}}   For small enough   x   x   x   , both approximations are numerically better than a direct evaluation of the actual analytical expression, since the latter suffers from Loss of significance .  The inverse Langevin function is defined on the open interval (−1, 1). For small values of   x   x   x   , it can be approximated by a truncation of its Taylor series 5        L   -  1     (  x  )    =    3  x   +     9  5     x  3    +     297  175     x  5    +     1539  875     x  7    +  …          superscript  L    1    x       3  x       9  5    superscript  x  3        297  175    superscript  x  5        1539  875    superscript  x  7    normal-…     L^{-1}(x)=3x+\tfrac{9}{5}x^{3}+\tfrac{297}{175}x^{5}+\tfrac{1539}{875}x^{7}+\dots   and by the Padé approximant         L   -  1     (  x  )    =    3  x    35  -   12   x  2      35  -   33   x  2       +   O   (   x  7   )      .         superscript  L    1    x       3  x      35    12   superscript  x  2       35    33   superscript  x  2         O   superscript  x  7       L^{-1}(x)=3x\frac{35-12x^{2}}{35-33x^{2}}+O(x^{7}).     (Figure)  Graphs of relative error for x ∈ [0, 1) for Cohen and Jedynak approximations   Since this function has no closed form, it is useful to have approximations valid for arbitrary values of   x   x   x   . One popular approximation, valid on the whole range (−1, 1), has been published by A. Cohen: 6         L   -  1     (  x  )    ≈   x    3  -   x  2     1  -   x  2       .         superscript  L    1    x     x      3   superscript  x  2      1   superscript  x  2        L^{-1}(x)\approx x\frac{3-x^{2}}{1-x^{2}}.   This has a maximum relative error of 4.9% at the vicinity of    x  =   ±  0.8       x    normal-±  0.8     x=±0.8   . Greater accuracy can be achieved by using the formula given by R. Jedynak: 7         L   -  1     (  x  )    ≈   x     3.0  -   2.6  x    +   0.7   x  2       (   1  -  x   )    (   1  +   0.1  x    )       ,         superscript  L    1    x     x        3.0    2.6  x      0.7   superscript  x  2         1  x     1    0.1  x         L^{-1}(x)\approx x\frac{3.0-2.6x+0.7x^{2}}{(1-x)(1+0.1x)},   valid for    x  ≥  0      x  normal-≥  0    x≥0   . The maximal relative error for this approximation is 1.5% at the vicinity of x = 0.85.  Interesting and comprehensive studies of the well-known approximation formulas of the inverse Langevin function can be found in the paper written by Jedynak. 8  High-temperature limit  When    x  ≪  1     much-less-than  x  1    x\ll 1   i.e. when       μ  B   B   /   k  B    T           subscript  μ  B   B    subscript  k  B    T    \mu_{B}B/k_{B}T   is small, the expression of the magnetization can be approximated by the Curie's law :      M  =   C  ⋅   B  T        M   normal-⋅  C    B  T      M=C\cdot\frac{B}{T}     where    C  =    N   g  2   J   (   J  +  1   )    μ  B  2     3   k  B         C      N   superscript  g  2   J    J  1    superscript   subscript  μ  B   2      3   subscript  k  B       C=\frac{Ng^{2}J(J+1)\mu_{B}^{2}}{3k_{B}}   is a constant. One can note that    g    J   (   J  +  1   )         g      J    J  1       g\sqrt{J(J+1)}   is the effective number of Bohr magnetons.  High-field limit  When    x  →  ∞     normal-→  x     x\to\infty   , the Brillouin function goes to 1. The magnetization saturates with the magnetic moments completely aligned with the applied field:      M  =   N  g   μ  B   J       M    N  g   subscript  μ  B   J     M=Ng\mu_{B}J     References    "  Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats  Category:Magnetism     C.
