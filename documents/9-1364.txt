   Schlick's approximation      Schlick's approximation   In 3D computer graphics , Schlick's approximation , named after Christophe Schlick, is a formula for approximating the contribution of the Fresnel factor in the specular reflection of light from a non-conducting interface (surface) between two media. 1  According to Schlick's model, the specular reflection coefficient  R can be approximated by:       R   (  θ  )    =    R  0   +    (   1  -   R  0    )     (   1  -   cos  θ    )   5           R  θ      subscript  R  0       1   subscript  R  0     superscript    1    θ    5       R(\theta)=R_{0}+(1-R_{0})(1-\cos\theta)^{5}          R  0   =    (     n  1   -   n  2      n  1   +   n  2     )   2        subscript  R  0    superscript       subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2       subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2     2     R_{0}=\left(\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}\right)^{2}     where   θ   θ   \theta   is the angle between the direction from which the incident light is coming and the normal of the interface between the two media, hence     cos  θ   =   (   N  ⋅  V   )         θ    normal-⋅  N  V     \cos\theta=(N\cdot V)   . And     n  1   ,   n  2       subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2     n_{1},\,n_{2}   are the indices of refraction of the two media at the interface and    R  0     subscript  R  0    R_{0}   is the reflection coefficient for light incoming parallel to the normal (i.e., the value of the Fresnel term when    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   or minimal reflection). In computer graphics, one of the interfaces is usually air, meaning that    n  1     subscript  n  1    n_{1}   very well can be approximated as 1.  In microfacet models it is assumed that there is always a perfect reflection, but the normal changes according to a certain distribution, resulting in a non-perfect overall reflection. When using Schlicks's approximation, the normal in the above computation is replaced by the halfway vector . Either the viewing or light direction can be used as the second vector. 2  See also   Phong reflection model  Blinn-Phong shading model  Fresnel equations   References  "  Category:3D computer graphics     ↩  ↩
