The Zugspitzebahn was the first wire ropeway to open the summit of the Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain on the border of Austria. . Designed and built by Adolf Bleichert & Co. of Leipzig, Germany, the system was a record-holder for highest altitude. Opening in 1926, the Zugspitzebahn connected the Austrian town of Ehrwald (1225 metres above sea level) with the top station at 2,950 metres above sea level next to the summit of Zugspitze.
Peter von Bleichert wrote a book on "Bleichert's Wire Ropeways" that contains information on the design, construction, and operation of the original Zugspitzebahn. 1
The modern Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car has a top station opposite the one of the German Eibsee Cable Car system. It has a length of 3600 metres and an elevation gain of 1725 metres. The Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car runs over three aerial lift pylons. The double track ropes have a diameter of 62 mm each, and the hauling rope has a diameter of 38 mm. It runs on 2 x 500 kilowatts of power, generated in the valley station. The journey normally takes less than 10 minutes at a speed of 36 km/h. The tramway's two cabins can accommodate 100 persons each and have a transport capacity of 730 persons per hour each way.
There is a cable lift from Ehrwald to the base of Zugspitze in Austria where the resort Ehrwald Alm houses skiers, and a ski run down to Ehrwald starts. The resort has a dramatic view of the face of Zugspitze.
