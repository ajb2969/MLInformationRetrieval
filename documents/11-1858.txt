   Preordered class      Preordered class   In mathematics , a preordered class is a class equipped with a preorder .  Definition  When dealing with a class C , it is possible to define a class relation on C as a subclass of the power class C   Ã—     \times   C . Then, it is convenient to use the language of relations on a set.  A preordered class is a class with a preorder on it. Partially ordered class and totally ordered class are defined in a similar way. These concepts generalize respectively those of preordered set , partially ordered set and totally ordered set . However, it is difficult to work with them as in the small case because many constructions common in a set theory are no longer possible in this framework.  Equivalently, a preordered class is a thin category , that is, a category with at most one morphism from an object to another.  Examples   In any category  C , when D is a class of morphisms of C containing identities and closed under composition, the relation 'there exists a D -morphism from X to Y ' is a preorder on the class of objects of C .  The class Ord of all ordinals is a totally ordered class with the classical ordering of ordinals.
