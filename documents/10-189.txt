Tutte–Berge formula

In the mathematical discipline of graph theory the Tutte–Berge formula, named after William Thomas Tutte and Claude Berge, is a characterization of the size of a maximum matching in a graph. It is a generalization of Tutte's theorem.
The theorem states that the size of a maximum matching of a graph G = (V, E) equals



where odd(H) is the number of components in the graph H with an odd number of vertices.
