   Link concordance      Link concordance   In mathematics two links      L  0   ⊂   S  n        subscript  L  0    superscript  S  n     L_{0}\subset S^{n}   and     L  1   ⊂   S  n        subscript  L  1    superscript  S  n     L_{1}\subset S^{n}   are concordant if there is an embedding     f  :     L  0   ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →    S  n   ×   [  0  ,  1  ]        normal-:  f   normal-→     subscript  L  0    0  1       superscript  S  n    0  1       f:L_{0}\times[0,1]\to S^{n}\times[0,1]   such that     f   (    L  0   ×   {  0  }    )    =    L  0   ×   {  0  }          f     subscript  L  0    0        subscript  L  0    0      f(L_{0}\times\{0\})=L_{0}\times\{0\}   and     f   (    L  0   ×   {  1  }    )    =    L  1   ×   {  1  }          f     subscript  L  0    1        subscript  L  1    1      f(L_{0}\times\{1\})=L_{1}\times\{1\}   .  By its nature, link concordance is an equivalence relation . It is weaker than isotopy , and stronger than homotopy : isotopy implies concordance implies homotopy. A link is a slice link if it is concordant to the unlink .  Concordance invariants  A function of a link that is invariant under concordance is called a concordance invariants .  The linking number of any two components of a link is one of the most elementary concordance invariants. The signature of a knot is also a concordance invariant. A subtler concordance invariant are the Milnor invariants , and in fact all rational finite type concordance invariants are Milnor invariants and their products, 1 though non-finite type concordance invariants exist.  Higher dimensions  One can analogously define concordance for any two submanifolds      M  0   ,   M  1    ⊂  N        subscript  M  0    subscript  M  1    N    M_{0},M_{1}\subset N   . In this case one considers two submanifolds concordant if there is a cobordism between them in     N  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,      N   0  1     N\times[0,1],   i.e., if there is a manifold with boundary    W  ⊂   N  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]        W    N   0  1      W\subset N\times[0,1]   whose boundary consists of     M  0   ×   {  0  }        subscript  M  0    0     M_{0}\times\{0\}   and      M  1   ×   {  1  }    .       subscript  M  1    1     M_{1}\times\{1\}.     This higher-dimensional concordance is a relative form of cobordism – it requires two submanifolds to be not just abstractly cobordant, but "cobordant in N ".
