Difference set


For the set of elements in one set but not another, see relative complement. For the set of differences of pairs of elements, see Minkowski difference.


In combinatorics, a 
 
 
difference set is a subset

 
  of size

 
  of a group

 
  of order

 
  such that every nonidentity element of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a product 
 
 
 
  of elements of 
 
 
 
  in exactly 
 
 
 
  ways. A difference set 
 
 
 
  is said to be cyclic, abelian, non-abelian, etc., if the group 
 
 
 
  has the corresponding property. A difference set with 
 
 
 
  is sometimes called planar or simple.1 If 
 
 
 
  is an abelian group written in additive notation, the defining condition is that every nonzero element of 
 
 
 
  can be written as a difference of elements of 
 
 
 
  in exactly 
 
 
 
  ways. The term "difference set" arises in this way.
Basic facts

A simple counting argument shows that there are exactly 
 
 
 
  pairs of elements from 
 
 
 
  that will yield nonidentity elements, so every difference set must satisfy the equation 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a difference set, and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is also a difference set, and is called a translate of 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  in additive notation).
The complement of a 
 
 
 
 -difference set is a 
 
 
 
 -difference set.2
The set of all translates of a difference set 
 
 
 
  forms a symmetric block design, called the development of 
 
 
 
  and denoted by 
 
 
 
 . In such a design there are 
 
 
elements (usually called points) and 
 
 
blocks (subsets). Each block of the design consists of 
 
 
 
  points, each point is contained in 
 
 
 
  blocks. Any two blocks have exactly 
 
 
 
  elements in common and any two points are simultaneously contained in exactly 
 
 
 
  blocks. The group 
 
 
 
  acts as an automorphism group of the design. It is sharply transitive on both points and blocks.3

In particular, if 
 
 
 
 , then the difference set gives rise to a projective plane. An example of a (7,3,1) difference set in the group 
 
 
 
  is the subset 
 
 
 
 . The translates of this difference set form the Fano plane.

Since every difference set gives a symmetric design, the parameter set must satisfy the Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem.4
Not every symmetric design gives a difference set.5

Equivalent and isomorphic difference sets
Two difference sets 
 
 
 
  in group 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in group 
 
 
 
  are equivalent if there is a group isomorphism

 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . The two difference sets are isomorphic if the designs 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic as block designs.
Equivalent difference sets are isomorphic, but there exist examples of isomorphic difference sets which are not equivalent. In the cyclic difference set case, all known isomorphic difference sets are equivalent.6
Multipliers
A multiplier of a difference set 
 
 
 
  in group 
 
 
 
  is a group automorphism

 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is abelian and 
 
 
 
  is the automorphism that maps 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is called a numerical or Hall multiplier.7
It has been conjectured that if p is a prime dividing 
 
 
 
  and not dividing v, then the group automorphism defined by 
 
 
 
  fixes some translate of D (this is equivalent to being a multiplier). It is known to be true for 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
  is an abelian group, and this is known as the First Multiplier Theorem. A more general known result, the Second Multiplier Theorem, says that if 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -difference set in an abelian group 
 
 
 
  of exponent 
 
 
 
  (the least common multiple of the orders of every element), let 
 
 
 
  be an integer coprime to 
 
 
 
 . If there exists a divisor 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that for every prime p dividing m, there exists an integer i with 
 
 
 
 , then t is a numerical divisor.8
For example, 2 is a multiplier of the (7,3,1)-difference set mentioned above.
It has been mentioned that a numerical multiplier of a difference set 
 
 
 
  in an abelian group 
 
 
 
  fixes a translate of 
 
 
 
 , but it can also be shown that there is a translate of 
 
 
 
  which is fixed by all numerical multipliers of 
 
 
 
 .9
Parameters
The known difference sets or their complements have one of the following parameter sets:10



 
 -difference set for some prime power 
 
 
 
  and some positive integer 
 
 
 
 . These are known as the classical parameters and there are many constructions of difference sets having these parameters.


 
 -difference set for some positive integer 
 
 
 
 . Difference sets with v = 4n - 1 are called Paley-type difference sets.


 
 -difference set for some positive integer 
 
 
 
 . A difference set with these parameters is a Hadamard difference set.


 
 -difference set for some prime power 
 
 
 
  and some positive integer 
 
 
 
 . Known as the McFarland parameters.


 
 -difference set for some positive integer 
 
 
 
 . Known as the Spence parameters.


 
 -difference set for some prime power 
 
 
 
  and some positive integer 
 
 
 
 . Difference sets with these parameters are called Davis-Jedwab-Chen difference sets.

Known difference sets
In many constructions of difference sets the groups that are used are related to the additive and multiplicative groups of finite fields. The notation used to denote these fields differs according to discipline. In this section, 
 
 
 
  is the Galois field of order 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a prime or prime power. The group under addition is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , while 
 
 
 
  is the multiplicative group of non-zero elements.

History
The systematic use of cyclic difference sets and methods for the construction of symmetric block designs dates back to R. C. Bose and a seminal paper of his in 1939.12 However, various examples appeared earlier than this, such as the "Paley Difference Sets" which date back to 1933.13 The generalization of the cyclic difference set concept to more general groups is due to R.H. Bruck14 in 1955.15 Multipliers were introduced by Marshall Hall Jr.16 in 1947.17
Application
It is found by Xia, Zhou and Giannakis that difference sets can be used to construct a complex vector codebook that achieves the difficult Welch bound on maximum cross correlation amplitude. The so-constructed codebook also forms the so-called Grassmannian manifold.
Generalisations
A 
 
 
difference family is a set of subsets 
 
 
 
  of a group

 
  such that the order of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , the size of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and every nonidentity element of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a product 
 
 
 
  of elements of 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  (i.e. both 
 
 
 
  come from the same 
 
 
 
 ) in exactly 
 
 
 
  ways.
A difference set is a difference family with 
 
 
 
 . The parameter equation above generalises to 
 
 
 
 .18 The development 
 
 
 
  of a difference family is a 2-design. Every 2-design with a regular automorphism group is 
 
 
 
  for some difference family 
 
 
 
 .
