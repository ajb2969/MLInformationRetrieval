   Vojta's conjecture      Vojta's conjecture   In mathematics , Vojta's conjecture is a conjecture introduced by  about heights of points on algebraic varieties over number fields . The conjecture was motivated by an analogy between diophantine approximation and Nevanlinna theory (value distribution theory) in complex analysis . It implies many other conjectures in diophantine approximation theory, diophantine equations , arithmetic geometry , and logic.  Statement of the Conjecture  Let   F   F   F   be a number field, let    X  /  F      X  F    X/F   be a non-singular algebraic variety, let   D   D   D   be an effective divisor on   X   X   X   with at worst normal crossings, let   H   H   H   be an ample divisor on   X   X   X   , and let    K  X     subscript  K  X    K_{X}   be a canonical divisor on   X   X   X   . Choose Weil height functions     h  H     subscript  h  H    h_{H}   and    h   K  X      subscript  h   subscript  K  X     h_{K_{X}}   and, for each absolute value    v   v   v   on   F   F   F   , a local height function    λ   D  ,  v      subscript  λ   D  v     \lambda_{D,v}   . Fix a finite set of absolute values   S   S   S   of   F   F   F   , and let    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   . Then there is a constant   C   C   C   and a non-empty Zariski open set    U  ⊆  X      U  X    U\subseteq X   , depending on all of the above choices, such that    \sum_{v\in S} \lambda_{D,v}(P) + h_{K_X}(P) \le \epsilon h_H(P) + C     \quad\hbox{for all } P\in U(F).  Examples :   Let    X  =   ℙ  N       X   superscript  ℙ  N     X=\mathbb{P}^{N}   . Then     K  X   ∼   -    (   N  +  1   )   H       similar-to   subscript  K  X         N  1   H      K_{X}\sim-(N+1)H   , so Vojta's conjecture reads      ∑   v  ∈  S      λ   D  ,  v     (  P  )     ≤     (   N  +  1  +  ϵ   )    h  H    (  P  )    +  C         subscript     v  S       subscript  λ   D  v    P          N  1  ϵ    subscript  h  H   P   C     \sum_{v\in S}\lambda_{D,v}(P)\leq(N+1+\epsilon)h_{H}(P)+C   for all    P  ∈   U   (  F  )        P    U  F     P\in U(F)   .  Let   X   X   X   be a variety with trivial canonical bundle, for example, an abelian variety , a K3 surface or a Calabi-Yau variety . Vojta's conjecture predicts that if   D   D   D   is an effective ample normal crossings divisor, then the   S   S   S   -integral points on the affine variety    X  ∖  D      X  D    X\setminus D   are not Zariski dense. For abelian varieties, this was conjectured by Lang and proven by .  Let   X   X   X   be a variety of general type , i.e.,    K  X     subscript  K  X    K_{X}   is ample on some non-empty Zariski open subset of   X   X   X   . Then taking    S  =  ∅      S     S=\emptyset   , Vojta's conjecture predicts that    X   (  F  )       X  F    X(F)   is not Zariski dense in   X   X   X   . This last statement for varieties of general type is the Bombieri-Lang conjecture .   Generalizations  There are generalizations in which   P   P   P   is allowed to vary over    X   (   F  ¯   )       X   normal-¯  F     X(\overline{F})   , and there is an additional term in the upper bound that depends on the discriminant of the field extension     F   (  P  )    /  F        F  P   F    F(P)/F   .  There are generalizations in which the non-archimedean local heights    λ   D  ,  v      subscript  λ   D  v     \lambda_{D,v}   are replaced by truncated local heights, which are local heights in which multiplicities are ignored. These versions of Vojta's conjecture provide natural higher-dimensional analogues of the ABC conjecture .  References        "  Category:Number theory  Category:Conjectures
