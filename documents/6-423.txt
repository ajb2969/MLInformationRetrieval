   P′′      P′′   P′′ is a primitive computer programming language created by Corrado Böhm 1 2 in 1964 to describe a family of Turing machines .  Definition      𝒫  ′′     superscript  𝒫  ′′    \mathcal{P}^{\prime\prime}   (hereafter written P′′ ) is formally defined as a set of words on the four-instruction alphabet { R, λ, (, ) }, as follows:  Syntax   R and λ are words in P′′.  If ''p'' and ''q'' are words in P′′, then ''pq'' is a word in P′′.  If ''q'' is a word in P′′, then (''q'') is a word in P′′.  Only words derivable from the previous three rules are words in P′′.   Semantics   {a 0 , a 1 , ..., a ''n'' }(''n'' ≥ 1) is the tape-alphabet of a Turing machine with left-infinite tape, a 0 being the blank symbol.  R means move the tape-head rightward one cell (if any).  λ means replace the current symbol a ''i'' by a (''i''+1) [[Modulo_operation|mod]] (''n''+1) , and then move the tape-head leftward one cell.  (''q'') means iterate ''q'' in a while loop , with condition that the current symbol is not a 0 .  A program is a word in P′′. Execution of a program proceeds left-to-right, executing R , λ , and (''q'') as they are encountered, until there is nothing more to execute.   Relation to other programming languages   P′′ was the first " GOTO -less" imperative structured programming language to be proven 3 4  Turing-complete .    The brainfuck language (apart from its I/O commands) is a minor informal variation of P′′. Böhm 5 gives explicit P′′ programs for each of a set of basic functions sufficient to compute any computable function , using only ( , ) and the four words r ≡ λR, r′ ≡ r ''n'' ( r ''n'' means rrrrr...rr [ ''n'' times]) , L ≡ r′λ, R. These are the equivalents of the six respective brainfuck commands [, ], +, -, <, > . Note that since a ''n''+1 = a 0 , performing r ("increment" symbol in current cell) ''n'' times will wrap around so that the result is to "decrement" the symbol in the current cell by one ( r′ ).   Example program  Böhm 6 gives the following program to compute the predecessor ( x -1) of an integer x > 0:  R ( R ) L ( r' ( L ( L ) ) r' L ) R r  which translates directly to the equivalent brainfuck program  > [ > ] +  The program expects an integer to be represented in bijective base-n notation, with a 1 , ..., a n coding the digits 1,..., n , respectively, and to have an a 0 before and after the digit-string. (E.g. in bijective base-2, the number eight would be encoded as a 0 a 1 a 1 a 2 a 0 , because 8 = 1 *2 2 + 1 *2 1 + 2 *2 0 .) At the beginning and end of the computation, the tape-head is on the a 0 preceding the digit-string.
