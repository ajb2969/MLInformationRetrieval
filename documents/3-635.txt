   Knudsen number      Knudsen number   The Knudsen number ( Kn ) is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free path length to a representative physical length scale . This length scale could be, for example, the radius of a body in a fluid. The number is named after Danish physicist Martin Knudsen (1871–1949).  Definition  The Knudsen number is a dimensionless number defined as:      Kn  =   λ  L       Kn    λ  L     \mathrm{Kn}=\frac{\lambda}{L}     where      λ   λ   \lambda   = mean free path [L 1 ]     L   L   L   = representative physical length scale [L 1 ].   For a Boltzmann gas, the mean free path may be readily calculated so that:      Kn  =     k  B   T     2   π   d  2   p  L        Kn       subscript  k  B   T       2   π   superscript  d  2   p  L      \mathrm{Kn}=\frac{k_{B}T}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^{2}pL}     where       k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is the Boltzmann constant (1.3806504(24) × 10 −23 J/K in SI units), [M 1 L 2 T −2 θ −1 ]     T   T   T   is the thermodynamic temperature , [θ 1 ]     d   d   d   is the particle hard shell diameter, [L 1 ]     p   p   p   is the total pressure, [M 1 L −1 T −2 ].   For particle dynamics in the atmosphere , and assuming standard temperature and pressure , i.e. 25 °C and 1 atm, we have   λ   λ   \lambda   ≈ 8 × 10 −8 m.  Relationship to Mach and Reynolds numbers in gases  The Knudsen number can be related to the Mach number and the Reynolds number :  Noting the following:  Dynamic viscosity ,       μ  =    1  2   ρ   c  ¯   λ    .      μ      1  2   ρ   normal-¯  c   λ     \mu=\frac{1}{2}\rho\bar{c}\lambda.

The dimensionless Mach number can be written:      Ma  =    U  ∞    c  s        Ma     subscript  U     subscript  c  s      \mathrm{Ma}=\frac{U_{\infty}}{c_{s}}     where the speed of sound is given by       c  s   =     γ  R  T   M    =     γ   k  B   T   m           subscript  c  s         γ  R  T   M               γ   subscript  k  B   T   m       c_{s}=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma RT}{M}}=\sqrt{\frac{\gamma k_{B}T}{m}}     where   U ∞ is the freestream speed, [L 1 T −1 ]  R is the Universal gas constant , (in SI , 8.314 47215 J K −1 mol −1 ), [M 1 L 2 T −2 θ −1 'mol' −1 ]  M is the molar mass , [M 1 'mol' −1 ]     γ   γ   \gamma   is the ratio of specific heats , and is dimensionless.   The dimensionless Reynolds number can be written:       Re  =    ρ   U  ∞   L   μ    .      Re      ρ   subscript  U    L   μ     \mathrm{Re}=\frac{\rho U_{\infty}L}{\mu}.     Dividing the Mach number by the Reynolds number,       Ma  Re   =     U  ∞   /   c  s      ρ   U  ∞   L   /  μ    =   μ   ρ  L   c  s     =   μ   ρ  L     γ   k  B   T   m      =    μ   ρ  L      m   γ   k  B   T              Ma  Re        subscript  U     subscript  c  s        ρ   subscript  U    L   μ           μ    ρ  L   subscript  c  s            μ    ρ  L        γ   subscript  k  B   T   m               μ    ρ  L        m    γ   subscript  k  B   T         \frac{\mathrm{Ma}}{\mathrm{Re}}=\frac{U_{\infty}/c_{s}}{\rho U_{\infty}L/\mu}=%

 \frac{\mu}{\rho L}\sqrt{\frac{\pi m}{2k_{B}T}}=\mathrm{Kn}     yields the Knudsen number.  The Mach, Reynolds and Knudsen numbers are therefore related by:       Kn  =     Ma  Re       γ  π   2      .      Kn      Ma  Re         γ  π   2       \mathrm{Kn}=\frac{\mathrm{Ma}}{\mathrm{Re}}\;\sqrt{\frac{\gamma\pi}{2}}.     Application  The Knudsen number is useful for determining whether statistical mechanics or the continuum mechanics formulation of fluid dynamics should be used: If the Knudsen number is near or greater than one, the mean free path of a molecule is comparable to a length scale of the problem, and the continuum assumption of fluid mechanics is no longer a good approximation. In this case statistical methods must be used.  Problems with high Knudsen numbers include the calculation of the motion of a dust particle through the lower atmosphere , or the motion of a satellite through the exosphere . One of the most widely used applications for the Knudsen number is in microfluidics and MEMS device design. The solution of the flow around an aircraft has a low Knudsen number, making it firmly in the realm of continuum mechanics. Using the Knudsen number an adjustment for Stokes' Law can be used in the Cunningham correction factor , this is a drag force correction due to slip in small particles (i.e. d p
