   Strong duality      Strong duality   Strong duality is a concept in optimization such that the primal and dual solutions are equivalent. This is as opposed to weak duality (the primal problem has optimal value greater than the dual problem, in other words the duality gap is positive).  Characterizations  Strong duality holds if and only if the duality gap is equal to 0.  Sufficient conditions       F  =   F    *  *        F   superscript  F    absent       F=F^{**}   where   F   F   F   is the perturbation function relating the primal and dual problems and    F    *  *      superscript  F    absent      F^{**}   is the biconjugate of   F   F   F   ;  the primal problem is a linear optimization problem ;  Slater's condition for a convex optimization problem . 1 2   See also   Convex optimization   References  "  Category:Mathematical optimization  Category:Linear programming  Category:Convex optimization     ↩  ↩
