   Cevian      Cevian   In geometry , a cevian is any line segment in a triangle with one endpoint on a vertex of the triangle and the other endpoint on the opposite side. Medians , altitudes , and angle bisectors are special cases of cevians. The name cevian comes from the Italian engineer Giovanni Ceva , who proved a well-known theorem about cevians which also bears his name.  Length  (Figure)  A triangle with a cevian of length d   Stewart's Theorem  The length of a cevian can be determined by Stewart's Theorem : in the diagram, the cevian length   d   d   d   is given by the formula           b   2   m   +    c  2   n    =   a   (    d  2   +   m  n    )     .           superscript  b  2   m      superscript  c  2   n      a     superscript  d  2     m  n       \,b^{2}m+c^{2}n=a(d^{2}+mn).     Median  If the cevian happens to be a median (thus bisecting a side ), its length can be determined from the formula        m    (    b  2   +   c  2    )    =   a   (    d  2   +   m  2    )          m     superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2       a     superscript  d  2    superscript  m  2       \,m(b^{2}+c^{2})=a(d^{2}+m^{2})     or       2   (    b  2   +   c  2    )    =    4   d  2    +   a  2          2     superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2         4   superscript  d  2     superscript  a  2      \,2(b^{2}+c^{2})=4d^{2}+a^{2}     since        a   =   2  m    .      a    2  m     \,a=2m.     Hence in this case       d  =       2   b  2    +   2   c  2     -   a  2    4     .      d            2   superscript  b  2      2   superscript  c  2      superscript  a  2    4      d=\sqrt{\frac{2b^{2}+2c^{2}-a^{2}}{4}}.     Angle bisector  If the cevian happens to be an angle bisector , its length obeys the formulas         (   b  +  c   )   2   =    a  2    (     d  2    m  n    +  1   )     ,       superscript    b  c   2      superscript  a  2        superscript  d  2     m  n    1      \,(b+c)^{2}=a^{2}\left(\frac{d^{2}}{mn}+1\right),     and 1        d  2   +   m  n    =   b  c          superscript  d  2     m  n      b  c     d^{2}+mn=bc     and      d  =    2    b  c  s   (   s  -  a   )       b  +  c        d      2      b  c  s    s  a        b  c      d=\frac{2\sqrt{bcs(s-a)}}{b+c}     where the semiperimeter  s = ( a+b+c )/2.  The side of length a is divided in the proportion b : c .  Altitude  If the cevian happens to be an altitude and thus perpendicular to a side, its length obeys the formulas        d   2   =    b  2   -   n  2    =    c  2   -   m  2           superscript  d  2      superscript  b  2    superscript  n  2            superscript  c  2    superscript  m  2       \,d^{2}=b^{2}-n^{2}=c^{2}-m^{2}     and       d  =    2    s   (   s  -  a   )    (   s  -  b   )    (   s  -  c   )      a    ,      d      2      s    s  a     s  b     s  c      a     d=\frac{2\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}{a},     where the semiperimeter s = ( a+b+c ) / 2.  Ratio properties  (Figure)  Three cevians passing through a common point   There are various properties of the ratios of lengths formed by three cevians all passing through the same arbitrary interior point: 2 Referring to the diagram at right,          A  F    F  B    ⋅    B  D    D  C    ⋅    C  E    E  A     =  1   ;       normal-⋅      A  F     F  B        B  D     D  C        C  E     E  A     1    \frac{AF}{FB}\cdot\frac{BD}{DC}\cdot\frac{CE}{EA}=1;   ( Ceva's theorem )         A  O    O  D    =     A  E    E  C    +    A  F    F  B      ;          A  O     O  D          A  E     E  C        A  F     F  B       \frac{AO}{OD}=\frac{AE}{EC}+\frac{AF}{FB};             O  D    A  D    +    O  E    B  E    +    O  F    C  F     =  1   ;            O  D     A  D        O  E     B  E        O  F     C  F     1    \frac{OD}{AD}+\frac{OE}{BE}+\frac{OF}{CF}=1;            A  O    A  D    +    B  O    B  E    +    C  O    C  F     =  2.            A  O     A  D        B  O     B  E        C  O     C  F     2.    \frac{AO}{AD}+\frac{BO}{BE}+\frac{CO}{CF}=2.     These last two properties are equivalent because summing the two equations gives the identity 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.  Splitter  A splitter of a triangle is a cevian that bisects the perimeter . The three splitters concur at the Nagel point of the triangle.  Area bisectors  Three of the area bisectors of a triangle are its medians, which connect the vertices to the opposite side midpoints. Thus a uniform-density triangle would in principle balance on a razor supporting any of the medians.  Angle trisectors  If from each vertex of a triangle two cevians are drawn so as to trisect the angle (divide it into three equal angles), then the six cevians intersect in pairs to form an equilateral triangle , called the Morley triangle .  Area of inner triangle formed by cevians  Routh's theorem determines the ratio of the area of a given triangle to that of a triangle formed by the pairwise intersections of three cevians, one from each vertex.
