   Polo kinase      Polo kinase   In enzymology , a polo kinase () is a kinase  enzyme i.e. one that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + a protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + a phosphoprotein   Thus, the two substrates of these enzymes are ATP and protein , whereas their two products are ADP and phosphoprotein .  These enzymes belong to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ).  The systematic name of this [polo[-like] kinase] enzyme class is ATP:protein phosphotransferase ( spindle -pole-dependent) .  Examples and other names in common use include Cdc5 , Cdc5p , Plk , PLK , Plk1 , Plo1 , POLO kinase , polo serine-threonine kinase , polo-like kinase , polo-like kinase 1 , serine/threonine-specific Drosophila kinase polo , and STK21 .  These enzymes participate in 3 metabolic pathways : cell cycle , cell cycle - yeast , and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
