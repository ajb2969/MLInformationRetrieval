Roe solver

The Roe approximate Riemann solver, devised by Phil Roe, is an approximate Riemann solver based on the Godunov scheme and involves finding an estimate for the intercell numerical flux or Godunov flux 
 
 
 
  at the interface between two computational cells 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , on some discretised space-time computational domain.
The Roe Scheme
Quasi-linear Hyperbolic system
A non-linear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations representing a set of conservation laws in one spatial dimension can be written in the form


 
  Applying the chain rule to the second term we get the quasi-linear hyperbolic system


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the jacobian matrix of the flux vector 
 
 
 
 .
The Roe Matrix
The Roe method consists of finding a matrix 
 
 
 
  that is assumed constant between two cells. The Riemann problem can then be solved as a truly linear hyperbolic system at each cell interface. The Roe matrix must obey the following conditions:

Diagonalizable with real eigenvalues Ensures that the new linear system is truly hyperbolic.
Consistency with the exact jacobian When 
 
 
 
  we demand that 
 
 

Conserving 

\boldsymbol{F}_{i+1}-\boldsymbol{F}_{i} = \tilde{A}(\boldsymbol{U}_{i+1}-\boldsymbol{U}_{i})  Phil Roe introduced a method of parameter vectors1 to find such a matrix for some systems of conservation laws.
The Intercell Flux
Once the Roe matrix corresponding to the interface between two cells is found, the intercell flux is given by solving the quasi-linear system as a truly linear system.
