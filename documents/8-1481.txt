   AC (complexity)      AC (complexity)   In circuit complexity , AC is a complexity class hierarchy. Each class, AC i , consists of the languages recognized by Boolean circuits with depth    O   (    log  i   n   )       O    superscript   i   n     O(\log^{i}n)   and a polynomial number of unlimited fan-in  AND and OR gates .  The name "AC" was chosen by analogy to NC , with the "A" in the name standing for "alternating" and referring both to the alternation between the AND and OR gates in the circuits and to alternating Turing machines . 1  The smallest AC class is AC 0 , consisting of constant-depth unlimited fan-in circuits.  The total hierarchy of AC classes is defined as       AC  =    ⋃   i  ≥  0     AC  i        AC    subscript     i  0     superscript  AC  i      \mbox{AC}=\bigcup_{i\geq 0}\mbox{AC}^{i}      Relation to NC  The AC classes are related to the NC classes, which are defined similarly, but with gates having only constant fanin. For each i , we have 2 3        NC  i   ⊆   AC  i   ⊆   NC   i  +  1     .         superscript  NC  i    superscript  AC  i         superscript  NC    i  1       \mbox{NC}^{i}\subseteq\mbox{AC}^{i}\subseteq\mbox{NC}^{i+1}.     As an immediate consequence of this, we have that NC = AC. 4  It is known that inclusion is strict for i = 0. 5  Variations  The power of the AC classes can be affected by adding additional gates. If we add gates which calculate the modulo operation for some modulus m , we have the classes ACC i [m ]. 6  Notes  References      .
