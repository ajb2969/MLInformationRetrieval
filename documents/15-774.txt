Polar code (coding theory)

In information theory, a polar code is a linear block error correcting code developed by Erdal ArÄ±kan.1 It is the first code with an explicit construction to probably achieve the channel capacity for symmetric binary-input, discrete, memoryless channels (B-DMC) with polynomial dependence on the gap to capacity. Notably, polar codes have encoding and decoding complexity 
 
 
 
 , which makes them practical for many applications.
