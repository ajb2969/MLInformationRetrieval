   Quasiconvex function      Quasiconvex function     In mathematics , a quasiconvex function is a real -valued function defined on an interval or on a convex subset of a real vector space such that the inverse image of any set of the form    (   -  ∞   ,  a  )         a    (-\infty,a)   is a convex set . Informally, along any stretch of the curve the highest point is one of the endpoints. The negative of a quasiconvex function is said to be quasiconcave .  All convex functions are also quasiconvex, but not all quasiconvex functions are convex, so quasiconvexity is a generalization of convexity. Quasiconvexity and quasiconcavity extend to functions with multiple arguments the notion of unimodality of functions with a single real argument.  Definition and properties  A function    f  :   S  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  S  ℝ     f:S\to\mathbb{R}   defined on a convex subset S of a real vector space is quasiconvex if for all     x  ,  y   ∈  S       x  y   S    x,y\in S   and    λ  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       λ   0  1     \lambda\in[0,1]   we have        f   (    λ  x   +    (   1  -  λ   )   y    )    ≤   max   {   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    }     .        f      λ  x       1  λ   y         f  x     f  y      f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)\leq\max\big\{f(x),f(y)\big\}.     In words, if f is such that it is always true that a point directly between two other points does not give a higher value of the function than both of the other points do, then f is quasiconvex. Note that the points x and y , and the point directly between them, can be points on a line or more generally points in n -dimensional space.  (Figure)  A quasilinear function is both quasiconvex and quasiconcave.   (Figure)  The graph of a function that is both concave and quasi-convex on the nonnegative real numbers.   An alternative way (see introduction) of defining a quasi-convex function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is to require that each sub-levelset      S  α    (  f  )    =   {  x  |    f   (  x  )    ≤  α   }          subscript  S  α   f    conditional-set  x      f  x   α      S_{\alpha}(f)=\{x|f(x)\leq\alpha\}   is a convex set.  If furthermore       f   (    λ  x   +    (   1  -  λ   )   y    )    <   max   {   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    }          f      λ  x       1  λ   y         f  x     f  y      f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)<\max\big\{f(x),f(y)\big\}     for all    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   and    λ  ∈   (  0  ,  1  )       λ   0  1     \lambda\in(0,1)   , then   f   f   f   is strictly quasiconvex . That is, strict quasiconvexity requires that a point directly between two other points must give a lower value of the function than one of the other points does.  A quasiconcave function is a function whose negative is quasiconvex, and a strictly quasiconcave function is a function whose negative is strictly quasiconvex. Equivalently a function   f   f   f   is quasiconcave if        f   (    λ  x   +    (   1  -  λ   )   y    )    ≥   min   {   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    }     .        f      λ  x       1  λ   y         f  x     f  y      f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)\geq\min\big\{f(x),f(y)\big\}.     and strictly quasiconcave if       f   (    λ  x   +    (   1  -  λ   )   y    )    >   min   {   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    }          f      λ  x       1  λ   y         f  x     f  y      f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)>\min\big\{f(x),f(y)\big\}     A (strictly) quasiconvex function has (strictly) convex lower contour sets , while a (strictly) quasiconcave function has (strictly) convex upper contour sets .  A function that is both quasiconvex and quasiconcave is quasilinear .  A particular case of quasi-concavity, if    S  ⊂  ℝ      S  ℝ    S\subset\mathbb{R}   , is unimodality , in which there is a locally maximal value.  Applications  Quasiconvex functions have applications in mathematical analysis , in mathematical optimization , and in game theory and economics .  Mathematical optimization  In nonlinear optimization , quasiconvex programming studies iterative methods that converge to a minimum (if one exists) for quasiconvex functions. Quasiconvex programming is a generalization of convex programming . 1 Quasiconvex programming is used in the solution of "surrogate" dual problems , whose biduals provide quasiconvex closures of the primal problem, which therefore provide tighter bounds than do the convex closures provided by Lagrangian  dual problems . 2 In theory , quasiconvex programming and convex programming problems can be solved in reasonable amount of time, where the number of iterations grows like a polynomial in the dimension of the problem (and in the reciprocal of the approximation error tolerated); 3 however, such theoretically "efficient" methods use "divergent-series" stepsize rules , which were first developed for classical subgradient methods . Classical subgradient methods using divergent-series rules are much slower than modern methods of convex minimization, such as subgradient projection methods, bundle methods of descent, and nonsmooth filter methods .  Economics and partial differential equations: Minimax theorems  In microeconomics , quasiconcave utility functions imply that consumers have convex preferences . Quasiconvex functions are important also in game theory , industrial organization , and general equilibrium theory , particularly for applications of Sion's minimax theorem . Generalizing a minimax theorem of John von Neumann , Sion's theorem is also used in the theory of partial differential equations .  Preservation of quasiconvexity  Operations preserving quasiconvexity   non-negative weighted maximum of quasiconvex functions (i.e.    f  =   max   {    w  1    f  1    ,  …  ,    w  n    f  n    }        f       subscript  w  1    subscript  f  1    normal-…     subscript  w  n    subscript  f  n       f=\max\left\{w_{1}f_{1},\ldots,w_{n}f_{n}\right\}   with    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   non-negative)  composition with a non-decreasing function (i.e.    g  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     g:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   quasiconvex,    h  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  h   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     h:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   non-decreasing, then    f  =   h  ∘  g       f    h  g     f=h\circ g   is quasiconvex)  minimization (i.e.    f   (  x  ,  y  )       f   x  y     f(x,y)   quasiconvex,   C   C   C   convex set, then     h   (  x  )    =    inf   y  ∈  C     f   (  x  ,  y  )           h  x     subscript  infimum    y  C      f   x  y       h(x)=\inf_{y\in C}f(x,y)   is quasiconvex)   Operations not preserving quasiconvexity   The sum of quasiconvex functions defined on the same domain need not be quasiconvex: In other words, if     f   (  x  )    ,   g   (  x  )         f  x     g  x     f(x),g(x)   are quasiconvex, then      (   f  +  g   )    (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    +   g   (  x  )             f  g   x       f  x     g  x      (f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)   need not be quasiconvex.  The sum of quasiconvex functions defined on different domains (i.e. if     f   (  x  )    ,   g   (  y  )         f  x     g  y     f(x),g(y)   are quasiconvex,     h   (  x  ,  y  )    =    f   (  x  )    +   g   (  y  )           h   x  y        f  x     g  y      h(x,y)=f(x)+g(y)   ) need not be quasiconvex. Such functions are called "additively decomposed" in economics and "separable" in mathematical optimization .   Examples   Every convex function is quasiconvex.  A concave function can be quasiconvex function. For example    x  ↦   log   (  x  )       maps-to  x    x     x\mapsto\log(x)   is concave, and it is quasiconvex.  Any monotonic function is both quasiconvex and quasiconcave. More generally, a function which decreases up to a point and increases from that point on is quasiconvex (compare unimodality ).  The floor function     x  ↦   ⌊  x  ⌋      maps-to  x    x     x\mapsto\lfloor x\rfloor   is an example of a quasiconvex function that is neither convex nor continuous.  If    x  ↦   f   (  x  )       maps-to  x    f  x     x\mapsto f(x)   and    y  ↦   g   (  y  )       maps-to  y    g  y     y\mapsto g(y)   are positive convex decreasing functions, then     (  x  ,  y  )   ↦   f   (  x  )   g   (  y  )       maps-to   x  y     f  x  g  y     (x,y)\mapsto f(x)g(y)   is quasiconvex.
