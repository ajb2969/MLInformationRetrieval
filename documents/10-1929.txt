4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate aldolase

In enzymology, a 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  2 pyruvate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate, and one product, pyruvate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate pyruvate-lyase (pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include pyruvate aldolase, gamma-methyl-gamma-hydroxy-alpha-ketoglutaric aldolase, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-ketoglutarate aldolase, and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate pyruvate-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism.
