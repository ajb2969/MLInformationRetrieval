   Gravitomagnetic clock effect      Gravitomagnetic clock effect   In physics, the gravitomagnetic clock effect is a deviation from Kepler's third law that, according to the weak-field and slow-motion approximation of general relativity , will be suffered by a particle in orbit around a (slowly) spinning body, such as a typical planet or star .  Explanation  According to general relativity , in its weak-field and slow-motion linearized approximation, a slowly spinning body induces an additional component of the gravitational field that acts on a freely-falling test particle with a non-central, gravitomagnetic Lorentz -like force.  Among its consequences on the particle's orbital motion there is a small correction to Kepler's third law , namely       T  Kep   =   2  π      a  3   /  G   M          subscript  T  Kep     2  π         superscript  a  3   G   M       T_{\rm Kep}=2\pi\sqrt{a^{3}/GM}   where T Kep is the particle's period, M is the mass of the central body, and a is the semimajor axis of the particle's ellipse . If the orbit of the particle is circular and lies in the equatorial plane of the central body, the correction is       T  =    T  Kep   +   T  Gvm    =    T  Kep   ±    S  /  M    c  2      ,        T     subscript  T  Kep    subscript  T  Gvm          plus-or-minus   subscript  T  Kep       S  M    superscript  c  2        T=T_{\rm Kep}+T_{\rm Gvm}=T_{\rm Kep}\pm{S}/{Mc^{2}},   where S is the central body's angular momentum and c is the speed of light in vacuum.  Particles orbiting in opposite directions experience gravitomagnetic corrections T Gvm with opposite signs, so that the difference of their orbital periods would cancel the standard Keplerian terms and would add the gravitomagnetic ones. 1 2 3 4 5    6 7 8 9 10 11 Note that the + sign occurs for particle's corotation with respect to the rotation of the central body, whereas the − sign is for counter-rotation. That is, if the satellite orbits in the same direction as the planet spins, it takes more time to make a full orbit, whereas if it moves oppositely with respect to the planet's rotation its orbital period gets shorter.
