1,2-dehydroreticulinium reductase (NADPH)

In enzymology, a 1,2-dehydroreticulinium reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-reticuline + NADP+

 
  1,2-dehydroreticulinium + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-reticuline and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 1,2-dehydroreticulinium, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-reticuline:NADP+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called 1,2-dehydroreticulinium ion reductase. This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i.
