   Reiss relation      Reiss relation   In algebraic geometry , the Reiss relation , introduced by , is a condition on the second-order elements of the points of a plane algebraic curve meeting a given line.  Statement  If C is a complex plane curve given by the zeros of a polynomial f ( x , y ) of two variables, and L is a line meeting C transversely and not meeting C at infinity, then       ∑       f   x  x     f  y  2    -   2   f   x  y     f  x    f  y     +    f   y  y     f  x  2      f  y  3     =  0                 subscript  f    x  x     superscript   subscript  f  y   2      2   subscript  f    x  y     subscript  f  x    subscript  f  y        subscript  f    y  y     superscript   subscript  f  x   2      superscript   subscript  f  y   3     0    \sum\frac{f_{xx}f_{y}^{2}-2f_{xy}f_{x}f_{y}+f_{yy}f_{x}^{2}}{f_{y}^{3}}=0   where the sum is over the points of intersection of C and L , and f x , f xy and so on stand for partial derivatives of f . This can also be written as       ∑   κ   sin    (  θ  )   3      =  0          κ   fragments    superscript   fragments  normal-(  θ  normal-)   3      0    \sum\frac{\kappa}{\sin(\theta)^{3}}=0   where κ is the curvature of the curve C and θ is the angle its tangent line makes with L , and the sum is again over the points of intersection of C and L .
