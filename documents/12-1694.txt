Agmon's inequality

In mathematical analysis, Agmon's inequalities, named after Shmuel Agmon,1 consist of two closely related interpolation inequalities between the Lebesgue space

 
  and the Sobolev spaces

 
 . It is useful in the study of partial differential equations.
Let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Then Agmon's inequalities in 3D state that there exists a constant 
 
 
 
  such that



and



In 2D, the first inequality still holds, but not the second: let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Then Agmon's inequality in 2D states that there exists a constant 
 
 
 
  such that



For the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional case, choose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Then, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the following inequality holds for any
