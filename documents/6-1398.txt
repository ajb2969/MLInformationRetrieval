Majorization


In mathematics, majorization is a preorder on vectors of real numbers. For a vector 
 
 
 
 , we denote by 
 
 
 
  the vector with the same components, but sorted in descending order. Given 
 
 
 
 , we say that 
 
 
weakly majorizes (or dominates) 
 
 
from below written as 
 
 
iff



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, sorted in decreasing order. Equivalently, we say that 
 
 
 
  is weakly majorized (or dominated) by 
 
 
from below, denoted as 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, we say that 
 
 
weakly majorizes

from above written as 
 
 
iff



Equivalently, we say that 
 
 
 
  is weakly majorized by 
 
 
from above, denoted as 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  and in addition 
 
 
 
  we say that 
 
 
majorizes (or dominates) 
 
 
 
  written as 
 
 
 
 . Equivalently, we say that 
 
 
 
  is majorized (or dominated) by 
 
 
 
 , denoted as 
 
 
 
 .
It is easy to see that 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Note that the majorization order do not depend on the order of the components of the vectors 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . Majorization is not a partial order, since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  do not imply 
 
 
 
 , it only implies that the components of each vector are equal, but not necessarily in the same order.
Regrettably, to confuse the matter, some literature sources use the reverse notation, e.g., 
 
 
 
  is replaced with 
 
 
 
 , most notably, in Horn and Johnson, Matrix analysis (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985), Definition 4.3.24, while the same authors switch to the traditional notation, introduced here, later in their Topics in Matrix Analysis (1994).
A function 
 
 
 
  is said to be Schur convex when 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, 
 
 
 
  is Schur concave when 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 

The majorization partial order on finite sets, described here, can be generalized to the Lorenz ordering, a partial order on distribution functions.
Examples
The order of the entries does not affect the majorization, e.g., the statement 
 
 
 
  is simply equivalent to 
 
 
 
 .

(Weak) majorization

Geometry of Majorization
 For 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is in the convex hull of all vectors obtained by permuting the coordinates of 
 
 
 
 .
Figure 1 displays the convex hull in 2D for the vector 
 
 
 
 . Notice that the center of the convex hull, which is an interval in this case, is the vector 
 
 
 
 . This is the "smallest" vector satisfying 
 
 
 
  for this given vector 
 
 
 
 .
 Figure 2 shows the convex hull in 3D. The center of the convex hull, which is a 2D polygon in this case, is the "smallest" vector 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  for this given vector 
 
 
 
 .
Equivalent conditions
Each of the following statements is true if and only if 
 
 
 
 :



 
  for some doubly stochastic matrix

 
  (see Arnold,1 Theorem 2.1). This is equivalent to saying b can be represented as a weighted average of the permutations of 
 
 
 
 .
From 
 
 
 
  we can produce 
 
 
 
  by a finite sequence of "Robin Hood operations" where we replace two elements 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, for some 
 
 
 
  (see Arnold,2 p. 11).
For every convex function 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  (see Arnold,3 Theorem 2.9).

In linear algebra

Suppose that for two real vectors

 
 , 
 
 
 
  majorizes 
 
 
 
 . Then it can be shown that there exists a set of probabilities 

\sum_{i=1}^d p_i=1 and a set of permutations

 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Alternatively it can be shown that there exists a doubly stochastic matrix

 
  such that 
 
 


We say that a hermitian operator, 
 
 
 
 , majorizes another, 
 
 
 
 , if the set of eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  majorizes that of 
 
 
 
 .

In recursion theory
Given 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is said to majorize

 
  if, for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . If there is some 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is said to dominate (or eventually dominate) 
 
 
 
 . Alternatively, the preceding terms are often defined requiring the strict inequality 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
  in the foregoing definitions.
