Tagatose-bisphosphate aldolase

In enzymology, a tagatose-bisphosphate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate 
 
 
 
  glycerone phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate, and two products, glycerone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase (glycerone-phosphate-forming). This enzyme is also called D-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate triosephosphate lyase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
