Maleylpyruvate isomerase




Maleylpyruvate isomerase

In enzymology, a maleylpyruvate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-maleylpyruvate 
 
 
 
  3-fumarylpyruvate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-maleylpyruvate, and one product, 3-fumarylpyruvate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-maleylpyruvate cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
