   Regular semi-algebraic system      Regular semi-algebraic system   In computer algebra , a regular semi-algebraic system is a particular kind of triangular system of multivariate polynomials over a real closed field.  Introduction  Regular chains and triangular decompositions are fundamental and well-developed tools for describing the complex solutions of polynomial systems. The notion of a regular semi-algebraic system is an adaptation of the concept of a regular chain focusing on solutions of the real analogue: semi-algebraic systems.  Any semi-algebraic system   S   S   S   can be decomposed into finitely many regular semi-algebraic systems     S  1   ,  …  ,   S  e       subscript  S  1   normal-…   subscript  S  e     S_{1},\ldots,S_{e}   such that a point (with real coordinates) is a solution of   S   S   S   if and only if it is a solution of one of the systems     S  1   ,  …  ,   S  e       subscript  S  1   normal-…   subscript  S  e     S_{1},\ldots,S_{e}   . 1  Formal definition  Let   T   T   T   be a regular chain of    𝐤   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]       𝐤    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      {{\mathbf{k}}}[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]   for some ordering of the variables    𝐱  =    x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n        𝐱    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \mathbf{x}=x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}   and a real closed field    𝐤   𝐤   {{\mathbf{k}}}   . Let    𝐮  =    u  1   ,  …  ,   u  d        𝐮    subscript  u  1   normal-…   subscript  u  d      \mathbf{u}=u_{1},\ldots,u_{d}   and    𝐲  =    y  1   ,  …  ,   y   n  -  d         𝐲    subscript  y  1   normal-…   subscript  y    n  d       \mathbf{y}=y_{1},\ldots,y_{n-d}   designate respectively the variables of   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   that are free and algebraic with respect to   T   T   T   . Let    P  ⊂   𝐤   [  𝐱  ]        P    𝐤   delimited-[]  𝐱      P\subset{{\mathbf{k}}}[\mathbf{x}]   be finite such that each polynomial in   P   P   P   is regular w.r.t.\ the saturated ideal of   T   T   T   . Define     P  >   :=   {   p  >  0   ∣   p  ∈  P   }      assign   subscript  P     conditional-set    p  0     p  P      P_{>}:=\{p>0\mid p\in P\}   . Let   𝒬   𝒬   \mathcal{Q}   be a quantifier-free formula of    𝐤   [  𝐱  ]       𝐤   delimited-[]  𝐱     {{\mathbf{k}}}[\mathbf{x}]   involving only the variables of   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   . We say that    R  :=   [  𝒬  ,  T  ,   P  >   ]      assign  R   𝒬  T   subscript  P       R:=[\mathcal{Q},T,P_{>}]   is a regular semi-algebraic system if the following three conditions hold.      𝒬   𝒬   \mathcal{Q}   defines a non-empty open semi-algebraic set   S   S   S   of    𝐤  d     superscript  𝐤  d    {{\mathbf{k}}}^{d}   ,  the regular system    [  T  ,  P  ]     T  P    [T,P]   specializes well at every point   u   u   u   of   S   S   S   ,  at each point   u   u   u   of   S   S   S   , the specialized system    [   T   (  u  )    ,   P    (  u  )   >    ]       T  u     P   subscript  u       [T(u),P(u)_{>}]   has at least one real zero.   The zero set of   R   R   R   , denoted by     Z  𝐤    (  R  )        subscript  Z  𝐤   R    {Z}_{{{\mathbf{k}}}}(R)   , is defined as the set of points     (  u  ,  y  )   ∈    𝐤  d   ×   𝐤   n  -  d          u  y      superscript  𝐤  d    superscript  𝐤    n  d       (u,y)\in{{{\mathbf{k}}}}^{d}\times{{{\mathbf{k}}}}^{n-d}   such that    𝒬   (  u  )       𝒬  u    \mathcal{Q}(u)   is true and     t   (  u  ,  y  )    =  0        t   u  y    0    t(u,y)=0   ,     p   (  u  ,  y  )    >  0        p   u  y    0    p(u,y)>0   , for all    t  ∈  T      t  T    t\in T   and all    p  ∈  P      p  P    p\in P   .
