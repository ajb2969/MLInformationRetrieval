Glutamate—tRNA(Gln) ligase




Glutamate—tRNA(Gln) ligase

In enzymology, a glutamate-tRNAGln ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-glutamate + tRNAGlx 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + glutamyl-tRNAGlx
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-glutamate, and tRNAGlx, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and glutamyl-tRNAGlx.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:tRNAGlx ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme is also called glutamyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism.
