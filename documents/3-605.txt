   Fσ set      Fσ set   In mathematics, an F σ set (said F-sigma set ) is a countable  union of closed sets . The notation originated in France with F for fermé ( French : closed) and σ for somme ( French : sum, union). 1  In metrizable spaces, every open set is an F σ set. 2 The complement of an F σ set is a G δ set . 3 In a metrizable space, any closed set is a G δ set.  The union of countably many F σ sets is an F σ set, and the intersection of finitely many F σ sets is an F σ set. F σ is the same as    𝚺  2  0     subscript   superscript  𝚺  0   2    \mathbf{\Sigma}^{0}_{2}   in the Borel hierarchy.  Examples  Each closed set is an F σ set.  The set   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   of rationals is an F σ set. The set    ℝ  ∖  ℚ      ℝ  ℚ    \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}   of irrationals is not a F σ set.  In a Tychonoff space, each countable set is an F σ set, because a point   x   x   {x}   is closed.  For example, the set   A   A   A   of all points     (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   in the Cartesian plane such that    x  /  y      x  y    x/y   is rational is an F σ set because it can be expressed as the union of all the lines passing through the origin with rational slope :       A  =    ⋃   r  ∈  ℚ     {   (   r  y   ,  y  )   ∣   y  ∈  ℝ   }     ,      A    subscript     r  ℚ     conditional-set     r  y   y     y  ℝ       A=\bigcup_{r\in\mathbb{Q}}\{(ry,y)\mid y\in\mathbb{R}\},     where   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , is the set of rational numbers, which is a countable set.
