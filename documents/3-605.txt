Fσ set

 In mathematics, an Fσ set (said F-sigma set) is a countable union of closed sets. The notation originated in France with F for fermé (French: closed) and σ for somme (French: sum, union).1
In metrizable spaces, every open set is an Fσ set.2 The complement of an Fσ set is a Gδ set.3 In a metrizable space, any closed set is a Gδ set.
The union of countably many Fσ sets is an Fσ set, and the intersection of finitely many Fσ sets is an Fσ set. Fσ is the same as 
 
 
 
  in the Borel hierarchy.
Examples
Each closed set is an Fσ set.
The set 
 
 
 
  of rationals is an Fσ set. The set 
 
 
 
  of irrationals is not a Fσ set.
In a Tychonoff space, each countable set is an Fσ set, because a point 
 
 
 
  is closed.
For example, the set 
 
 
 
  of all points

 
  in the Cartesian plane such that 
 
 
 
  is rational is an Fσ set because it can be expressed as the union of all the lines passing through the origin with rational slope:



where 
 
 
 
 , is the set of rational numbers, which is a countable set.
