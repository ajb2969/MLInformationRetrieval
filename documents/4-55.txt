   Quiver diagram      Quiver diagram   In physics , a quiver diagram is a graph representing the matter content of a gauge theory that describes D-branes on orbifolds .  Each node of the graph corresponds to a factor U ( N ) of the gauge group , and each link represents a field in the bifundamental representation      (  M  ,   N  ¯   )     M   normal-¯  N     (M,\bar{N})   .  The relevance of quiver diagrams for string theory was pointed out and studied by Michael Douglas and Greg Moore. 1  While string theorists use the words quiver diagram , many of their colleagues in particle physics call these diagrams mooses .
