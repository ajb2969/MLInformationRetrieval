Rademacher distribution

In probability theory and statistics, the Rademacher distribution (which is named after Hans Rademacher) is a discrete probability distribution where a random variate X has a 50% chance of being either +1 or -1.1
A series of Rademacher distributed variables can be regarded as a simple symmetrical random walk where the step size is 1.
Mathematical formulation
The probability mass function of this distribution is



It can be also written as a probability density function, in terms of the Dirac delta function, as



van Zuijlen's bound
van Zuijlen has proved the following result.2
Let Xi be a set of independent Rademacher distributed random variables. Then



The bound is sharp and better than that which can be derived from the normal distribution (approximately Pr > 0.31).
Bounds on sums
Let { Xi } be a set of random variables with a Rademacher distribution. Let { ai } be a sequence of real numbers. Then



where ||a||2 is the Euclidean norm of the sequence { ai }, t > 0 is a real number and Pr(Z) is the probability of event Z.3
Let Y = Σ Xiai and let Y be an almost surely convergent series in a Banach space. The for t > 0 and s ≥ 1 we have4



for some constant c.
Let p be a positive real number. Then5



where c1 and c2 are constants dependent only on p.
For p ≥ 1



Another bound on the sums is known as the Bernstein inequalities.
Applications
The Rademacher distribution has been used in bootstrapping.
The Rademacher distribution can be used to show that normally distributed and uncorrelated does not imply independent.

Laplace distribution: If X has a Rademacher distribution and Y ~ Exp(λ), then XY ~ Laplace(0, 1/λ).
