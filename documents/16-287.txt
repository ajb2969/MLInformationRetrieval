N2-citryl-N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxylysine synthase

N2-citryl-N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxylysine synthase (, Nalpha-citryl-Nepsilon-acetyl-Nepsilon-hydroxylysine synthase, iucA (gene)) is an enzyme with system name citrate:N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxy-L-lysine ligase (ADP-forming).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 ATP + citrate + N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxy-L-lysine + H2O 
 
 
 
  2 ADP + 2 phosphate + N2-citryl-N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxy-L-lysine
 

This enzyme requires Mg2+.
