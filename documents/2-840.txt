   Kolmogorov's zero–one law      Kolmogorov's zero–one law   In probability theory , Kolmogorov's zero–one law , named in honor of Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov , specifies that a certain type of event , called a tail event , will either almost surely happen or almost surely not happen; that is, the probability of such an event occurring is zero or one.  Tail events are defined in terms of infinite sequences of random variables . Suppose       X  1   ,   X  2   ,   X  3   ,   …       subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2    subscript  X  3   normal-…    X_{1},X_{2},X_{3},\dots\,     is an infinite sequence of independent random variables (not necessarily identically distributed). Let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be the σ-algebra generated by the    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   . Then, a tail event     F  ∈  ℱ      F  ℱ    F\in\mathcal{F}   is an event which is probabilistically independent of each finite subset of these random variables. (Note   F   F   F   belonging to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   implies that membership in   F   F   F   is uniquely determined by the values of the    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   but the latter condition is strictly weaker and does not suffice to prove the zero-one law.) For example, the event that the sequence converges, and the event that its sum converges are both tail events. In an infinite sequence of coin-tosses, a sequence of 100 consecutive heads occurring infinitely many times is a tail event.  In many situations, it can be easy to apply Kolmogorov's zero–one law to show that some event has probability 0 or 1, but surprisingly hard to determine which of these two extreme values is the correct one.  Formulation  A more general statement of Kolmogorov's zero–one law holds for sequences of independent σ-algebras . Let (Ω, F , P ) be a probability space and let F n be a sequence of mutually independent σ-algebras contained in F . Let       G  n   =   σ   (    ⋃   k  =  n   ∞    F  k    )         subscript  G  n     σ    superscript   subscript     k  n       subscript  F  k       G_{n}=\sigma\bigg(\bigcup_{k=n}^{\infty}F_{k}\bigg)   be the smallest σ-algebra containing F n , F n +1 , …. Then Kolmogorov's zero–one law asserts that for any event      F  ∈    ⋂   n  =  1   ∞    G  n        F    superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  G  n      F\in\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}G_{n}   one has either P ( F ) = 0 or 1.  The statement of the law in terms of random variables is obtained from the latter by taking each F n to be the σ-algebra generated by the random variable X n . A tail event is then by definition an event which is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by all X n , but which is independent of any finite number of X n . That is, a tail event is precisely an element of the intersection     ⋂   n  =  1   ∞    G  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  G  n     \textstyle{\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}G_{n}}   .  Examples  An invertible  measure-preserving transformation on a standard probability space that obeys the 0-1 law is called a Kolmogorov automorphism . All Bernoulli automorphisms are Kolmogorov automorphisms but not vice versa .
