   Joukowsky transform      Joukowsky transform   (Figure)  Example of a Joukowsky transform. The circle above is transformed into the Joukowsky airfoil below   In applied mathematics , the Joukowsky transform , named after Nikolai Zhukovsky is a conformal map historically used to understand some principles of airfoil design.  The transform is      z  =   ζ  +   1  ζ        z    ζ    1  ζ      z=\zeta+\frac{1}{\zeta}     where    z  =   x  +   i  y        z    x    i  y      z=x+iy   is a complex variable in the new space and    ζ  =   χ  +   i  η        ζ    χ    i  η      \zeta=\chi+i\eta   is a complex variable in the original space. This transform is also called the Joukowsky transformation , the Joukowski transform , the Zhukovsky transform and other variations.  In aerodynamics , the transform is used to solve for the two-dimensional potential flow around a class of airfoils known as Joukowsky airfoils. A Joukowsky airfoil is generated in the z plane by applying the Joukowsky transform to a circle in the   ζ   ζ   \zeta   plane. The coordinates of the centre of the circle are variables, and varying them modifies the shape of the resulting airfoil. The circle encloses the point   ζ   ζ   \zeta   = −1 (where the derivative is zero) and intersects the point   ζ   ζ   \zeta   = 1. This can be achieved for any allowable centre position     μ  x   +   i   μ  y         subscript  μ  x     i   subscript  μ  y      \mu_{x}+i\mu_{y}   by varying the radius of the circle.  Joukowsky airfoils have a cusp at their trailing edge . A closely related conformal mapping, the Kármán–Trefftz transform , generates the much broader class of Kármán–Trefftz airfoils by controlling the trailing edge angle. When a trailing edge angle of zero is specified, the Kármán–Trefftz transform reduces to the Joukowsky transform.  General Joukowsky transform  The Joukowsky transform of any complex number   ζ   ζ   \zeta   to   z   z   z   is as follows     z   z   \displaystyle z     So the real ( x ) and imaginary ( y ) components are:     x   x   \displaystyle x     Sample Joukowsky airfoil  The transformation of all complex numbers on the unit circle is a special case.        |  ζ  |   =     χ  2   +   η  2     =  1     which gives    χ  2   +   η  2     =  1.      formulae-sequence        ζ        superscript  χ  2    superscript  η  2          1       which gives     superscript  χ  2    superscript  η  2     1.     |\zeta|=\sqrt{\chi^{2}+\eta^{2}}=1\quad\text{which gives}\quad\chi^{2}+\eta^{2%
 }=1.     So the real component becomes    x  =    χ   (   1  +  1   )    1   =   2  χ         x      χ    1  1    1          2  χ      x=\frac{\chi(1+1)}{1}=2\chi   and the imaginary component becomes    y  =    η   (   1  -  1   )    1   =  0.        y      η    1  1    1        0.     y=\frac{\eta(1-1)}{1}=0.     Thus the complex unit circle maps to a flat plate on the real number line from −2 to +2.  Transformation from other circles make a wide range of airfoil shapes.  Velocity field and circulation for the Joukowsky airfoil  The solution to potential flow around a circular cylinder is analytic and well known. It is the superposition of uniform flow , a doublet , and a vortex .  The complex velocity    W  ~     normal-~  W    \tilde{W}   around the circle in the   ζ   ζ   \zeta   plane is       W  ~   =      V  ∞    e   -   i  α      +    i  Γ    2  π   (   ζ  -  μ   )      -     V  ∞    R  2    e   i  α       (   ζ  -  μ   )   2          normal-~  W          subscript  V     superscript  e      i  α          i  normal-Γ     2  π    ζ  μ           subscript  V     superscript  R  2    superscript  e    i  α      superscript    ζ  μ   2       \tilde{W}=V_{\infty}e^{-i\alpha}+\frac{i\Gamma}{2\pi(\zeta-\mu)}-\frac{V_{%

 \right)\right).        The complex velocity W around the airfoil in the z plane is, according to the rules of conformal mapping and using the Joukowsky transformation:       W  =    W  ~     d  z    d  ζ     =    W  ~    1  -   1   ζ  2       .        W     normal-~  W       d  z     d  ζ             normal-~  W     1    1   superscript  ζ  2         W=\frac{\tilde{W}}{\frac{dz}{d\zeta}}=\frac{\tilde{W}}{1-\frac{1}{\zeta^{2}}}.     Here     W  =    u  x   -   i   u  y      ,      W     subscript  u  x     i   subscript  u  y       W=u_{x}-iu_{y},   with    u  x     subscript  u  x    u_{x}   and    u  y     subscript  u  y    u_{y}   the velocity components in the   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   directions, respectively (     z  =   x  +   i  y     ,      z    x    i  y      z=x+iy,   with   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   real-valued). From this velocity, other properties of interest of the flow, such as the coefficient of pressure or lift can be calculated.  A Joukowsky airfoil has a cusp at the trailing edge.  The transformation is named after Russian scientist Nikolai Zhukovsky . His name has historically been romanized in a number of ways, thus the variation in spelling of the transform.  Kármán–Trefftz transform  The Kármán–Trefftz transform is a conformal map closely related to the Joukowsky transform. While a Joukowsky airfoil has a cusped trailing edge, a Kármán–Trefftz airfoil —which is the result of the transform of a circle in the ς -plane to the physical z -plane, analogue to the definition of the Joukowsky airfoil—has a non-zero angle at the trailing edge, between the upper and lower airfoil surface. The Kármán–Trefftz transform therefore requires an additional parameter: the trailing-edge angle α . This transform is equal to: 1       z  =   n      (   1  +   1  ζ    )   n   +    (   1  -   1  ζ    )   n       (   1  +   1  ζ    )   n   -    (   1  -   1  ζ    )   n       ,      z    n       superscript    1    1  ζ    n    superscript    1    1  ζ    n       superscript    1    1  ζ    n    superscript    1    1  ζ    n        z=n\frac{\left(1+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^{n}+\left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^{n}%
 }{\left(1+\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^{n}-\left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^{n}},   (A)  with n slightly smaller than 2. The angle α , between the tangents of the upper and lower airfoil surface, at the trailing edge is related to n by: 2        α  =     2   π    -   n  π    and     n  =   2  -   α  π      .     formulae-sequence    α       2  π     n  π    and      n    2    α  π       \alpha=2\pi\,-\,n\pi\quad\text{ and }\quad n=2-\frac{\alpha}{\pi}.     The derivative      d  z   /  d   ζ          d  z   d   ζ    dz/d\zeta   , required to compute the velocity field, is equal to:         d  z    d  ζ    =     4   n  2      ζ  2   -  1        (   1  +   1  ζ    )   n     (   1  -   1  ζ    )   n      [     (   1  +   1  ζ    )   n   -    (   1  -   1  ζ    )   n    ]   2      .          d  z     d  ζ          4   superscript  n  2       superscript  ζ  2   1         superscript    1    1  ζ    n    superscript    1    1  ζ    n     superscript   delimited-[]     superscript    1    1  ζ    n    superscript    1    1  ζ    n     2       \frac{dz}{d\zeta}=\frac{4n^{2}}{\zeta^{2}-1}\frac{\left(1+\frac{1}{\zeta}%
 \right)^{n}\left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^{n}}{\left[\left(1+\frac{1}{\zeta}%
 \right)^{n}-\left(1-\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)^{n}\right]^{2}}.     Background  First, add and subtract two from the Joukowsky transform, as given above:      z  +  2      z  2    \displaystyle z+2     Dividing the left and right hand sides gives:         z  -  2    z  +  2    =    (    ζ  -  1    ζ  +  1    )   2    .          z  2     z  2     superscript      ζ  1     ζ  1    2     \frac{z-2}{z+2}=\left(\frac{\zeta-1}{\zeta+1}\right)^{2}.     The right hand side contains (as a factor) the simple second-power law from potential flow theory, applied at the trailing edge near    ζ  =   +  1.       ζ    1.     \zeta=+1.   From conformal mapping theory this quadratic map is known to change a half plane in the   ζ   ζ   \zeta   -space into potential flow around a semi-infinite straight line. Further, values of the power less than two will result in flow around a finite angle. So, by changing the power in the Joukowsky transform—to a value slightly less than two—the result is a finite angle instead of a cusp. Replacing 2 by n in the previous equation gives: 3         z  -  n    z  +  n    =    (    ζ  -  1    ζ  +  1    )   n    ,          z  n     z  n     superscript      ζ  1     ζ  1    n     \frac{z-n}{z+n}=\left(\frac{\zeta-1}{\zeta+1}\right)^{n},     which is the Kármán–Trefftz transform. Solving for z gives it in the form of equation (A).  Notes  References      External links   Joukowski Transform Module by John H.
