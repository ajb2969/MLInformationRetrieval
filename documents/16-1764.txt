   Draft:Faithfully flat descent      Draft:Faithfully flat descent   In practice, this allows one to prove some statement about a ring or scheme after faithfully flat base change.  Affine case  Let A be a ring that is faithfully flat over some other ring B ( B is then necessarily a subring 1 ) The descent data for an A -module N is an isomorphism of    A    ⊗  2      superscript  A   tensor-product  absent  2     A^{\otimes 2}   -modules      α  :    N   ⊗  B   A   ≃   A   ⊗  B   N       normal-:  α   similar-to-or-equals    subscript  tensor-product  B   N  A     subscript  tensor-product  B   A  N      \alpha:N\otimes_{B}A\simeq A\otimes_{B}N   that satisfies the cocycle condition.   See also: Zariski ring .  Descent for quasi-coherent sheaves  The statement is actually incredibly succinct: (by the prestack of quasi-sheaves over some scheme S , we mean that, for any S -scheme X , each X -point of the prestack is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X .)  (The proof uses Zariski descent and the faithfully flat descent in the affine case.)
