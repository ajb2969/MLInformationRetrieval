Draft:Faithfully flat descent

In practice, this allows one to prove some statement about a ring or scheme after faithfully flat base change.
Affine case
Let A be a ring that is faithfully flat over some other ring B (B is then necessarily a subring1) The descent data for an A-module N is an isomorphism of 
 
 
 
 -modules


 
  that satisfies the cocycle condition.

See also: Zariski ring.
Descent for quasi-coherent sheaves
The statement is actually incredibly succinct: (by the prestack of quasi-sheaves over some scheme S, we mean that, for any S-scheme X, each X-point of the prestack is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X.)
(The proof uses Zariski descent and the faithfully flat descent in the affine case.)
