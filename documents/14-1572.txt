   File:Triplet prism with refraction angles.svg      File:Triplet prism with refraction angles.svg   == Summary == A triplet prism, showing the apex angles (    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   ,    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   , and    α  3     subscript  α  3    \alpha_{3}   ) of the three elements, and the angles of incidence    θ  i     subscript  θ  i    \theta_{i}   and refraction    θ  i  ′     subscript   superscript  θ  normal-′   i    \theta^{\prime}_{i}   at each interface. The deviation angle of the ray transmitted by the prism is shown as   δ   δ   \delta   .  Licensing  "
