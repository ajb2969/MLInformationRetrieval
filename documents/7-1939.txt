   Restriction of scalars      Restriction of scalars   In abstract algebra , restriction of scalars is a procedure of creating a module over a ring    R   R   R   from a module over another ring   S   S   S   , given a homomorphism     f  :   R  →  S      normal-:  f   normal-→  R  S     f:R\to S   between them. Intuitively speaking, the resulting module "remembers" less information than the initial one, hence the name.  In algebraic geometry , the term "restriction of scalars" is often used as a synonym for Weil restriction .  Definition  Let   R   R   R   and   S   S   S   be two rings (they may or may not be commutative , or contain an identity ), and let    f  :   R  →  S      normal-:  f   normal-→  R  S     f:R\to S   be a homomorphism. Suppose that   M   M   M   is a module over   S   S   S   . Then it can be regarded as a module over   R   R   R   , if the action of   R   R   R   is given via     r  ⋅  m   =    f   (  r  )    ⋅  m        normal-⋅  r  m    normal-⋅    f  r   m     r\cdot m=f(r)\cdot m   for    r  ∈  R      r  R    r\in R   and    m  ∈  M      m  M    m\in M   .  Interpretation as a functor  Restriction of scalars can be viewed as a functor from   S   S   S   -modules to   R   R   R   -modules. An   S   S   S   -homomorphism    u  :   M  →  N      normal-:  u   normal-→  M  N     u:M\to N   automatically becomes an   R   R   R   -homomorphism between the restrictions of   M   M   M   and   N   N   N   . Indeed, if    m  ∈  M      m  M    m\in M   and    r  ∈  R      r  R    r\in R   , then       u   (   r  ⋅  m   )    =   u   (    f   (  r  )    ⋅  m   )    =     f   (  r  )    ⋅  u    (  m  )    =    r  ⋅  u    (  m  )            u   normal-⋅  r  m      u   normal-⋅    f  r   m            normal-⋅    f  r   u   m           normal-⋅  r  u   m      u(r\cdot m)=u(f(r)\cdot m)=f(r)\cdot u(m)=r\cdot u(m)\,   .  As a functor, restriction of scalars is the right adjoint of the extension of scalars functor.  If   R   R   R   is the ring of integers, then this is just the forgetful functor from modules to abelian groups.  The case of fields  When both   R   R   R   and   S   S   S   are fields ,   f   f   f   is necessarily a monomorphism , and so identifies   R   R   R   with a subfield of   S   S   S   . In such a case an   S   S   S   -module is simply a vector space over   S   S   S   , and naturally over any subfield thereof. The module obtained by restriction is then simply a vector space over the subfield    R  ⊂  S      R  S    R\subset S   .  "  Category:Abstract algebra
