Restriction of scalars




Restriction of scalars

In abstract algebra, restriction of scalars is a procedure of creating a module over a ring

 
  from a module over another ring 
 
 
 
 , given a homomorphism

 
  between them. Intuitively speaking, the resulting module "remembers" less information than the initial one, hence the name.
In algebraic geometry, the term "restriction of scalars" is often used as a synonym for Weil restriction.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two rings (they may or may not be commutative, or contain an identity), and let 
 
 
 
  be a homomorphism. Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a module over 
 
 
 
 . Then it can be regarded as a module over 
 
 
 
 , if the action of 
 
 
 
  is given via 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Interpretation as a functor
Restriction of scalars can be viewed as a functor from 
 
 
 
 -modules to 
 
 
 
 -modules. An 
 
 
 
 -homomorphism 
 
 
 
  automatically becomes an 
 
 
 
 -homomorphism between the restrictions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then


 
 .
As a functor, restriction of scalars is the right adjoint of the extension of scalars functor.
If 
 
 
 
  is the ring of integers, then this is just the forgetful functor from modules to abelian groups.
The case of fields
When both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are fields, 
 
 
 
  is necessarily a monomorphism, and so identifies 
 
 
 
  with a subfield of 
 
 
 
 . In such a case an 
 
 
 
 -module is simply a vector space over 
 
 
 
 , and naturally over any subfield thereof. The module obtained by restriction is then simply a vector space over the subfield 
 
 
 
 .
