Flavonol 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase




Flavonol 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a flavonol 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + a flavonol 
 
 
 
  UDP + a flavonol 7-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and flavonol, whereas its two products are UDP and flavonol 7-O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:flavonol 7-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. This enzyme is also called UDP-glucose:flavonol 7-O-glucosyltransferase.
