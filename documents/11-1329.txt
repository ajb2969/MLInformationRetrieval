   N-acetyllactosaminide beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase      N-acetyllactosaminide beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase   In enzymology , a N-acetyllactosaminide beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-1,6-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D- glucosaminyl-R   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R , whereas its 3 products are UDP , N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-1,6-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D- , and glucosaminyl-R .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosam inide beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase . Other names in common use include N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-acetyllactosaminide , beta1->6-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , Galbeta1->4GlcNAc-R beta1->6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , and UDP-GlcNAc:Gal-R, beta-D-6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - neo-lactoseries and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
