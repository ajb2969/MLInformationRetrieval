   Protein-methionine-S-oxide reductase      Protein-methionine-S-oxide reductase   Protein-methionine-S-oxide reductase (, methionine sulfoxide (protein) reductase , methionine sulfoxide peptide reductase , protein (methionine sulfoxide) reductase , Met(O)-peptide reductase , peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase , protein-L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase ) is an enzyme with system name protein-L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   protein L- methionine + thioredoxin disulfide    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protein L-methionine S-oxide + thioredoxin    Dithiothreitol can replace a reduced thioredoxin in the reverse reaction.
