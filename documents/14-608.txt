Bochner–Martinelli formula

In mathematics, the Bochner–Martinelli formula is a generalization of the Cauchy integral formula to functions of several complex variables, introduced by  and .
History
Bochner–Martinelli kernel
For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in ℂn the Bochner–Martinelli kernel 
 
 
 
  is a differential form in 
 
 
 
  of bidegree 
 
 
 
  defined by



(where the term  is omitted).
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a continuously differentiable function on the closure of a domain 
 
 
 
  in ℂn with piecewise smooth boundary 
 
 
 
 . Then the Bochner–Martinelli formula states that if 
 
 
 
  is in the domain 
 
 
 
  then



In particular if 
 
 
 
  is holomorphic the second term vanishes, so
