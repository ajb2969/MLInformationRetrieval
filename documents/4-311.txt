   Diamond principle      Diamond principle   In mathematics , and particularly in axiomatic set theory , the diamond principle ◊ is a combinatorial principle introduced by Ronald Jensen in  that holds in the constructible universe and that implies the continuum hypothesis . Jensen extracted the diamond principle from his proof that the Axiom of constructibility (V=L) implies the existence of a Suslin tree .  Definitions  The diamond principle ◊ says that there exists a ◊-sequence , in other words sets A α ⊆α for α1 such that for any subset A of ω 1 the set of α with A ∩α = A α is stationary in ω 1 .  There are several equivalent forms of the diamond principle. One states that there is a countable collection A α of subsets of α for each countable ordinal α such that for any subset A of ω 1 there is a stationary subset C of ω 1 such that for all α in C we have A ∩α ∈ A α and C ∩α ∈ A α . Another equivalent form states that there exist sets A α ⊆α for α1 such that for any subset A of ω 1 there is at least one infinite α with A ∩α = A α .  More generally, for a given cardinal number    κ   κ   \kappa   and a stationary set     S  ⊆  κ      S  κ    S\subseteq\kappa   , the statement ◊ S (sometimes written ◊( S ) or ◊ κ ( S )) is the statement that there is a sequence     ⟨    A  α   :   α  ∈  S    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   subscript  A  α     α  S      \langle A_{\alpha}:\alpha\in S\rangle   such that   each     A  α   ⊆  α       subscript  A  α   α    A_{\alpha}\subseteq\alpha     for every    A  ⊆   κ  ,   {   α  ∈  S   :    A  ∩  α   =   A  α    }        A   κ   conditional-set    α  S       A  α    subscript  A  α        A\subseteq\kappa,\{\alpha\in S:A\cap\alpha=A_{\alpha}\}   is stationary in   κ   κ   \kappa      The principle ◊ ω 1 is the same as ◊.  The diamond plus principle ◊ + says that there exists a ◊ + -sequence , in other words a countable collection A α of subsets of α for each countable ordinal α such that for any subset A of ω 1 there is a closed unbounded subset C of ω 1 such that for all α in C we have A ∩α ∈ A α and C ∩α ∈ A α .  Properties and use  showed that the diamond principle ◊ implies the existence of Suslin trees . He also showed that V=L implies the diamond plus principle, which implies the diamond principle, which implies the CH . In particular the diamond principle and the diamond plus principle are both independent of the axioms of ZFC. Also ♣ + CH implies ◊, but Shelah gave models of ♣ + ¬ CH, so ◊ and ♣ are not equivalent (rather, ♣ is weaker than ◊).  The diamond principle ◊ does not imply the existence of a Kurepa tree , but the stronger ◊ + principle implies both the ◊ principle and the existence of a Kurepa tree.  used ◊ to construct a C * -algebra serving as a counterexample to Naimark's problem .  For all cardinals κ and stationary subsets  S ⊆κ + , ◊ S holds in the constructible universe . Recently Shelah proved that for κ>ℵ 0 , ◊ κ + follows from     2  κ   =   κ  +        superscript  2  κ    superscript  κ      2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}   .  Shelah showed that the diamond principle solves the Whitehead problem by implying that every Whitehead group is free.  See also   Statements true in L   References        "  Category:Set theory
