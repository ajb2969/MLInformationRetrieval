   Initial mass function      Initial mass function   In astronomy , the initial mass function ( IMF ) is an empirical function that describes the distribution of initial masses for a population of stars. The IMF is often given as a probability distribution function (PDF) for the mass at which a star enters the main sequence (begins hydrogen fusion ). The distribution function can then be used to construct the mass distribution (the histogram of stellar masses) of a population of stars. The properties and evolution of a star are closely related to its mass, so the IMF is an important diagnostic tool for astronomers studying large quantities of stars. For example, the initial mass of a star is the primary factor determining its colour , luminosity , and lifetime. The IMF is relatively invariant from one group of stars to another, though some observations suggest that the IMF is different in different environments. 1  Form of the IMF  The IMF is often stated in terms of a series of power laws , where    N   (  m  )   d  m      N  m  d  m    N(m)dm   (sometimes also represented as    ξ   (  m  )   Δ  m      ξ  m  normal-Δ  m    \xi(m)\Delta m   ), the number of stars with masses in the range   m   m   m   to    m  +   d  m       m    d  m     m+dm   within a specified volume of space, is proportional to    m   -  α      superscript  m    α     m^{-\alpha}   , where   α   α   \alpha   is a dimensionless exponent. The IMF can be inferred from the present day stellar luminosity function by using the stellar mass-luminosity relation together with a model of how the star formation rate varies with time. Commonly used forms of the IMF are the Kroupa (2001) broken power law 2 and the Chabrier (2003) log-normal. 3  Salpeter (1955)  The IMF of stars more massive than our sun was first quantified by Edwin Salpeter in 1955. 4 His work favoured an exponent of    α  =  2.35      α  2.35    \alpha=2.35   . This form of the IMF is called the Salpeter function or a Salpeter IMF. It shows that the number of stars in each mass range decreases rapidly with increasing mass. The Salpeter Initial Mass Function is        ξ   (  m  )   Δ  m   =    ξ  0     (   m   M  sun    )    -  2.35     (    Δ  m    M  sun    )     .        ξ  m  normal-Δ  m      subscript  ξ  0    superscript    m   subscript  M  sun      2.35        normal-Δ  m    subscript  M  sun       \xi(m)\Delta m=\xi_{0}\left(\frac{m}{M_{\mathrm{sun}}}\right)^{-2.35}\left(%
 \frac{\Delta m}{M_{\mathrm{sun}}}\right).     Miller-Scalo (1979)  Later authors extended the work below one solar mass (). Glenn E. Miller and John M. Scalo suggested that the IMF "flattened" (approached    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   ) below one solar mass. 5  Chabrier (2003)  Chabrier 2003 for individual stars:       ξ   (  m  )   Δ  m   =   0.158   (   1  /  m   )    exp   [   -     (    log   (  m  )    -   log   (  0.08  )     )   2   /   (   2  ×   0.69  2    )     ]           ξ  m  normal-Δ  m     0.158    1  m          superscript      m     0.08    2     2   superscript  0.69  2          \xi(m)\Delta m=0.158(1/m)\exp[-(\log(m)-\log(0.08))^{2}/(2\times 0.69^{2})]   for     m  <  1   ,      m  1    m<1,          ξ   (  m  )    =   k   m   -  α           ξ  m     k   superscript  m    α       \xi(m)=km^{-\alpha}   for     m  >  1   ,   α  =   2.3  ±  0.3       formulae-sequence    m  1     α   plus-or-minus  2.3  0.3      m>1,\alpha=2.3\pm 0.3     Chabrier 2003 for stellar systems:       ξ   (  m  )   Δ  m   =   0.086   (   1  /  m   )    exp   [   -     (    log   (  m  )    -   log   (  0.22  )     )   2   /   (   2  ×   0.57  2    )     ]           ξ  m  normal-Δ  m     0.086    1  m          superscript      m     0.22    2     2   superscript  0.57  2          \xi(m)\Delta m=0.086(1/m)\exp[-(\log(m)-\log(0.22))^{2}/(2\times 0.57^{2})]   for     m  <  1   ,      m  1    m<1,          ξ   (  m  )    =   k   m   -  α           ξ  m     k   superscript  m    α       \xi(m)=km^{-\alpha}   for     m  >  1   ,   α  =   2.3  ±  0.3       formulae-sequence    m  1     α   plus-or-minus  2.3  0.3      m>1,\alpha=2.3\pm 0.3     Kroupa (2001)  Pavel Kroupa kept    α  =  2.3      α  2.3    \alpha=2.3   above half a solar mass, but introduced    α  =  1.3      α  1.3    \alpha=1.3   between  and    α  =  0.3      α  0.3    \alpha=0.3   below .        ξ   (  m  )    =   m   -  α     ,        ξ  m    superscript  m    α      \xi(m)=m^{-\alpha},         α  =  0.3      α  0.3    \alpha=0.3   for     m  <  0.08   ,      m  0.08    m<0.08,         α  =  1.3      α  1.3    \alpha=1.3   for $0.08 : \alpha = 2.3$ for $0.5 === Uncertainties ===
 There are large uncertainties concerning the [[Brown dwarf|substellar region]]. In particular, the classical assumption of a single IMF covering the whole substellar and stellar mass range is being questioned in favour of a two-component IMF to account for possible different formation modes of substellar objects. I.e. one IMF covering brown dwarfs and very-low-mass stars on the one hand, and another ranging from the higher-mass brown dwarfs to the most massive stars on the other. Note that this leads to an overlap region between about 0.05 and {{Solar mass|0.2}} where both formation modes may account for bodies in this mass range. {{cite conference|url= http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3340|last1 = Kroupa|first1 = Pavel|display-authors = etal|booktitle = Stellar Systems and Galactic Structure, Vol. V|title = The stellar and sub-stellar IMF of simple and composite populations|date = 2012}} ==Further reading==
