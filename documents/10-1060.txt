   Deoxysarpagine hydroxylase      Deoxysarpagine hydroxylase   In enzymology , a deoxysarpagine hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   10-deoxysarpagine + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sarpagine + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 10-deoxysarpagine , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are sarpagine , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 10-deoxysarpagine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (10-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called DOSH .
