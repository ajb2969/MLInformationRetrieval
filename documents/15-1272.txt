   Multisite-specific tRNA:(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase      Multisite-specific tRNA:(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase   Multisite-specific tRNA:(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase (, multisite-specific tRNA:m5C-methyltransferase , TRM4 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 34 in tRNA precursor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 34 in tRNA precursor  (2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 40 in tRNA precursor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 40 in tRNA precursor  (3) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 48 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 48 in tRNA  (4) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 49 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 49 in tRNA   The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for complete 5-methylcytosine  methylations of yeast  tRNA .
