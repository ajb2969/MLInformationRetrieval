Multisite-specific tRNA:(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase

Multisite-specific tRNA:(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase (, multisite-specific tRNA:m5C-methyltransferase, TRM4 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytosine-C5)-methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine34 in tRNA precursor 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine34 in tRNA precursor
 
(2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine40 in tRNA precursor 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine40 in tRNA precursor
 
(3) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine48 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine48 in tRNA
 
(4) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine49 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine49 in tRNA
 

The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for complete 5-methylcytosine methylations of yeast tRNA.
