   Recoil temperature      Recoil temperature   In laser cooling , the Boltzmann constant times the recoil temperature is equal to the recoil energy deposited in a single atom initially at rest by the spontaneous emission of a single photon . 1 The recoil temperature is       T   r  e  c  o  i  l    =     ℏ  2    k  2     2  m   k  B          subscript  T    r  e  c  o  i  l         superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2    superscript  k  2      2  m   subscript  k  B       T_{recoil}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2mk_{B}}   ,  since the photon's momentum is    p  =   ℏ  k       p    Planck-constant-over-2-pi  k     p=\hbar k   (here   k   k   k   is the wavevector of the light,   m   m   m   is the mass of an atom,    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is Boltzmann's constant and   ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is Planck's constant ). The recoil temperature for the D2 lines of alkali atoms is typically on the order of 1 μK, and thus lower than the Doppler temperature . 2 An example of a process where the recoil temperature can be reached is Sisyphus cooling . 3   References  "  Category:Atomic physics     ↩  ↩  ↩
