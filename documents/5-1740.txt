Recoil temperature

In laser cooling, the Boltzmann constant times the recoil temperature is equal to the recoil energy deposited in a single atom initially at rest by the spontaneous emission of a single photon.1 The recoil temperature is


 
 ,
since the photon's momentum is

  is the mass of an atom, 
 
 
 
  is Boltzmann's constant and 
 
 
 
  is Planck's constant). The recoil temperature for the D2 lines of alkali atoms is typically on the order of 1 Î¼K, and thus lower than the Doppler temperature.2 An example of a process where the recoil temperature can be reached is Sisyphus cooling.3
