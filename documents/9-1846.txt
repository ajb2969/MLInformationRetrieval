   Devil's curve      Devil's curve   In geometry , a Devil's curve is a curve defined in the Cartesian plane by an equation of the form         y  2    (    y  2   -   a  2    )    =    x  2    (    x  2   -   b  2    )     .         superscript  y  2      superscript  y  2    superscript  a  2        superscript  x  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  b  2       y^{2}(y^{2}-a^{2})=x^{2}(x^{2}-b^{2}).     Devil's curves were studied heavily by Gabriel Cramer .  The name comes from the shape its central lemniscate takes when graphed. The shape is named after the juggling game diabolo , which involves two sticks, a string, and a spinning prop in the likeness of the lemniscate. The confusion is the result of the Italian word diavolo meaning 'devil'. 1  References  External links   MathWorld – Devil's Curve  The MacTutor History of Mathematics (University of St. Andrews) – Devil's curve   "  Category:Curves     http://www.2dcurves.com/quartic/quarticd.html ↩
