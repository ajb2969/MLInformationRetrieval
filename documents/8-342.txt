   Lamplighter group      Lamplighter group   In mathematics , the lamplighter group  L of group theory is the wreath product  Z /2 Z ≀ Z . The base group B of L is        ⊕   -  ∞   ∞     ℤ  /  2   ℤ    ,      superscript   subscript  direct-sum             ℤ  2   ℤ     \bigoplus_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z},     and so L / B is isomorphic to Z .  The standard presentation for the lamplighter group arises from the wreath product structure      ⟨   a  ,  t   ∣     a  2   ,   [    t  m   a   t   -  m     ,    t  n   a   t   -  n     ]   ,  m  ,  n   ∈  ℤ   ⟩     inner-product   a  t       superscript  a  2       superscript  t  m   a   superscript  t    m        superscript  t  n   a   superscript  t    n      m  n   ℤ     \langle a,t\mid a^{2},[t^{m}at^{-m},t^{n}at^{-n}],m,n\in\mathbb{Z}\rangle   , which may be simplified to      ⟨   a  ,  t   ∣      (   a   t  n   a   t   -  n     )   2   ,  n   ∈  ℤ   ⟩     inner-product   a  t       superscript    a   superscript  t  n   a   superscript  t    n     2   n   ℤ     \langle a,t\mid(at^{n}at^{-n})^{2},n\in\mathbb{Z}\rangle   .  The generators a and t are intrinsic to the group's notable growth rate , though they are sometimes replaced with a and at , changing the logarithm of the growth rate by at most a factor of 2.  The name of the group comes from viewing the group as acting on a doubly infinite sequence of street lamps ..., l -2 , l -1 , l 0 , l 1 , l 2 , ..., each of which may be on or off, and a lamplighter standing at some lamp l k . The generator t increments k , so that the lamplighter moves to the next lamp ( t -1 decrements k ), while the generator a means that the state of lamp l k is changed (from off to on or from on to off).  We may assume that only finitely many lamps are lit at any time, since the action of any element of L changes at most finitely many lamps. The number of lamps lit is, however, unbounded. The group action is thus similar to the action of a Turing machine .
