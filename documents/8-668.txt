   Steroid 17a-monooxygenase      Steroid 17a-monooxygenase   Steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase (, steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase , cytochrome P-45017alpha , cytochrome P-450 (P-45017alpha,lyase) , 17alpha-hydroxylase-C17,20 lyase ) is an enzyme with system name steroid,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (17alpha-hydroxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   a steroid + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 17alpha-hydroxysteroid + A + H 2 O   Steroid 17a-monooxygenase requires NAD(P)H and P-450.
