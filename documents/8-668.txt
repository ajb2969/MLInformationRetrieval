Steroid 17a-monooxygenase

Steroid 17alpha-monooxygenase (, steroid 17alpha-hydroxylase, cytochrome P-45017alpha, cytochrome P-450 (P-45017alpha,lyase), 17alpha-hydroxylase-C17,20 lyase) is an enzyme with system name steroid,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (17alpha-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a steroid + AH2 + O2

 
  a 17alpha-hydroxysteroid + A + H2O
 

Steroid 17a-monooxygenase requires NAD(P)H and P-450.
