   Nilpotent matrix      Nilpotent matrix   In linear algebra , a nilpotent matrix is a square matrix  N such that       N  k   =   0        superscript  N  k   0    N^{k}=0\,   for some positive integer  k . The smallest such k is sometimes called the degree or index of N . 1  More generally, a nilpotent transformation is a linear transformation  L of a vector space such that L k = 0 for some positive integer k (and thus, L j = 0 for all j ≥ k ). 2 3 4 Both of these concepts are special cases of a more general concept of nilpotence that applies to elements of rings .  Examples  The matrix      M  =   [     0    1      0    0     ]       M    0  1    0  0      M=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{bmatrix}   is nilpotent, since M 2 = 0. More generally, any triangular matrix with 0s along the main diagonal is nilpotent. For example, the matrix      N  =   [     0    2    1    6      0    0    1    2      0    0    0    3      0    0    0    0     ]       N    0  2  1  6    0  0  1  2    0  0  0  3    0  0  0  0      N=\begin{bmatrix}0&2&1&6\\
 0&0&1&2\\
 0&0&0&3\\
 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}   is nilpotent, with         N  2   =   [     0    0    2    7      0    0    0    3      0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0     ]    ;     N  3   =   [     0    0    0    6      0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0     ]    ;    N  4   =   [     0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0     ]      .     formulae-sequence     superscript  N  2     0  0  2  7    0  0  0  3    0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0      formulae-sequence     superscript  N  3     0  0  0  6    0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0        superscript  N  4     0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0        N^{2}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&2&7\\
 0&0&0&3\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\par
 ;\ N^{3}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&6\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\par
 ;\ N^{4}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\\
 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}.   Though the examples above have a large number of zero entries, a typical nilpotent matrix does not. For example, the matrix      N  =   [     5     -  3     2      15     -  9     6      10     -  6     4     ]       N    5    3   2    15    9   6    10    6   4      N=\begin{bmatrix}5&-3&2\\
 15&-9&6\\
 10&-6&4\end{bmatrix}   squares to zero, though the matrix has no zero entries.  Characterization  For an n × n square matrix N with real (or complex ) entries, the following are equivalent:   N is nilpotent.  The minimal polynomial for N is x k for some positive integer k ≤ n .  The characteristic polynomial for N is x n .  The only eigenvalue for N is 0. 5  tr (N k ) = 0 for all k > 0.   The last theorem holds true for matrices over any field of characteristic 0 or sufficiently large characteristic. (cf. Newton's identities )  This theorem has several consequences, including:   The degree of an n × n nilpotent matrix is always less than or equal to n . For example, every 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix squares to zero.  The determinant and trace of a nilpotent matrix are always zero. Consequently, a nilpotent matrix cannot be invertible .  The only nilpotent diagonalizable matrix is the zero matrix.   Classification  Consider the n × n  shift matrix :       S  =   [     0    1    0    …    0      0    0    1    …    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮      0    0    0    …    1      0    0    0    …    0     ]    .      S    0  1  0  normal-…  0    0  0  1  normal-…  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮    0  0  0  normal-…  1    0  0  0  normal-…  0      S=\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0&\ldots&0\\
 0&0&1&\ldots&0\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
 0&0&0&\ldots&1\\
 0&0&0&\ldots&0\end{bmatrix}.   This matrix has 1s along the superdiagonal and 0s everywhere else. As a linear transformation, the shift matrix “shifts” the components of a vector one position to the left, with a zero appearing in the last position:        S   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   (   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,  0  )    .        S    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n   0     S(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})=(x_{2},\ldots,x_{n},0).    6 This matrix is nilpotent with degree n , and is the “canonical” nilpotent matrix.  Specifically, if N is any nilpotent matrix, then N is similar to a block diagonal matrix of the form      [      S  1     0    …    0      0     S  2     …    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮      0    0    …     S  r      ]       subscript  S  1   0  normal-…  0    0   subscript  S  2   normal-…  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮    0  0  normal-…   subscript  S  r      \begin{bmatrix}S_{1}&0&\ldots&0\\
 0&S_{2}&\ldots&0\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
 0&0&\ldots&S_{r}\end{bmatrix}   where each of the blocks S 1 , S 2 , ..., S r is a shift matrix (possibly of different sizes). This form is a special case of the Jordan canonical form for matrices. 7 8  For example, any nonzero 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix is similar to the matrix       [     0    1      0    0     ]   .      0  1    0  0     \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{bmatrix}.   That is, if N is any nonzero 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix, then there exists a basis b 1 , b 2 such that ''N' 'b 1 = 0 and N b 2 = b 1 .  This classification theorem holds for matrices over any field . (It is not necessary for the field to be algebraically closed.)  Flag of subspaces  A nilpotent transformation L on R n naturally determines a flag of subspaces       {  0  }   ⊂   ker  L   ⊂   ker   L  2    ⊂  …  ⊂   ker   L   q  -  1     ⊂   ker   L  q    =   ℝ  n          0    kernel  L         kernel   superscript  L  2         normal-…        kernel   superscript  L    q  1           kernel   superscript  L  q          superscript  ℝ  n      \{0\}\subset\ker L\subset\ker L^{2}\subset\ldots\subset\ker L^{q-1}\subset\ker

 ^{q}=\mathbb{R}^{n}   and a signature        0  =   n  0   <   n  1   <   n  2   <  …  <   n   q  -  1    <   n  q   =  n   ,    n  i   =   dim   ker   L  i       .     formulae-sequence      0   subscript  n  0         subscript  n  1         subscript  n  2        normal-…        subscript  n    q  1          subscript  n  q        n       subscript  n  i    dimension   kernel   superscript  L  i        0=n_{0}     The signature characterizes L  up to an invertible linear transformation . Furthermore, it satisfies the inequalities         n   j  +  1    -   n  j    ≤    n  j   -   n   j  -  1      ,    for all  j   =   1  ,  …  ,   q  -  1.        formulae-sequence       subscript  n    j  1     subscript  n  j       subscript  n  j    subscript  n    j  1          for all  j    1  normal-…    q  1.       n_{j+1}-n_{j}\leq n_{j}-n_{j-1},\qquad\mbox{for all }j=1,\ldots,q-1.   Conversely, any sequence of natural numbers satisfying these inequalities is the signature of a nilpotent transformation.  Additional properties   If N is nilpotent, then I + N is invertible , where I is the n × n  identity matrix . The inverse is given by            (   I  +  N   )    -  1    =      I  -  N   +   N  2    -   N  3    +  ⋯    ,       superscript    I  N     1            I  N    superscript  N  2     superscript  N  3    normal-⋯     (I+N)^{-1}=I-N+N^{2}-N^{3}+\cdots,       where only finitely many terms of this sum are nonzero.    If N is nilpotent, then           det   (   I  +  N   )    =  1   ,          I  N    1    \det(I+N)=1,\!\,       where I denotes the n × n identity matrix. Conversely, if A is a matrix and      det   (   I  +   t  A    )    =  1          I    t  A     1    \det(I+tA)=1\!\,      for all values of t , then A is nilpotent. In fact, since     p   (  t  )    =    det   (   I  +   t  A    )    -  1         p  t         I    t  A     1     p(t)=\det(I+tA)-1   is a polynomial of degree   n   n   n   , it suffices to have this hold for    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   distinct values of   t   t   t   .    Every singular matrix can be written as a product of nilpotent matrices. 9    A nilpotent matrix is a special case of a convergent matrix .   Generalizations  A linear operator  T is locally nilpotent if for every vector v , there exists a k such that        T  k    (  v  )    =  0.         superscript  T  k   v   0.    T^{k}(v)=0.\!\,   For operators on a finite-dimensional vector space, local nilpotence is equivalent to nilpotence.
