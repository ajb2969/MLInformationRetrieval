   Feruloyl esterase      Feruloyl esterase   In enzymology , a feruloyl esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   feruloyl-polysaccharide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ferulate + polysaccharide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are feruloyl-polysaccharide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ferulate and polysaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is feruloyl esterase. Other names in common use include ferulic acid esterase (FAE), hydroxycinnamoyl esterase, hemicellulase accessory enzyme, cinnamoyl ester hydrolase (cinnAE).  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
