   Isoprene synthase      Isoprene synthase   In enzymology , an isoprene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dimethylallyl pyrophosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   isoprene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , dimethylallyl pyrophosphate , and two products , isoprene and pyrophosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate pyrophosphate-lyase (isoprene-forming) . Other names in common use include ISPC , and ISPS .
