   Imaginary line (mathematics)      Imaginary line (mathematics)   In complex geometry , an imaginary line is a straight line that only contains one real point . It can be proven that this point is the intersection point with the conjugated line . 1  It is a special case of an imaginary curve .  An imaginary line is found in the complex projective plane P 2 (C) where points are represented by three homogeneous coordinates       (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )   ,    x  i    \isin   C    .       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       subscript  x  i   \isin  C     (x_{1},\ x_{2},\ x_{3}),\quad x_{i}\isin C.     Boyd Patterson described the lines in this plane: 2   The locus of points whose coordinates satisfy a homogeneous linear equation with complex coefficients           a  1     x  1    +     a  2      x  2     +     a  3      x  3      =  0           subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2       subscript  a  3    subscript  x  3     0    a_{1}\ x_{1}+\ a_{2}\ x_{2}\ +a_{3}\ x_{3}\ =\ 0         is a straight line and the line is real or imaginary according as the coefficients of its equation are or are not proportional to three real numbers .   Felix Klein described imaginary geometrical structures: "We will characterize a geometric structure as imaginary if its coordinates are not all real.: 3  According to Hatton: 4   The locus of the double points (imaginary) of the overlapping involutions in which an overlapping involution pencil (real) is cut by real transversals is a pair of imaginary straight lines.   Hatton continues,   Hence it follows that an imaginary straight line is determined by an imaginary point, which is a double point of an involution, and a real point, the vertex of the involution pencil.
