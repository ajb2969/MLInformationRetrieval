   Orthogonal functions      Orthogonal functions   In mathematics , two functions    f   f   f   and   g   g   g   are called orthogonal if their inner product     ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩     f  g    \langle f,g\rangle   is zero for f ≠ g .  Choice of inner product  How the inner product of two functions is defined may vary depending on context. However, a typical definition of an inner product for functions is       ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩   =   ∫   f    (  x  )   *   g   (  x  )   d  x         f  g       f   superscript  x    g  x  d  x      \langle f,g\rangle=\int f(x)^{*}g(x)\,dx     with appropriate integration boundaries. Here, the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate of f.  For another perspective on this inner product, suppose approximating vectors    f  →     normal-→  f    \vec{f}   and    g  →     normal-→  g    \vec{g}   are created whose entries are the values of the functions f and g , sampled at equally spaced points. Then this inner product between f and g can be roughly understood as the dot product between approximating vectors    f  →     normal-→  f    \vec{f}   and    g  →     normal-→  g    \vec{g}   , in the limit as the number of sampling points goes to infinity. Thus, roughly, two functions are orthogonal if their approximating vectors are perpendicular (under this common inner product). 1  In differential equations  Solutions of linear differential equations with boundary conditions can often be written as a weighted sum of orthogonal solution functions (a.k.a. eigenfunctions ), leading to generalized Fourier series .
