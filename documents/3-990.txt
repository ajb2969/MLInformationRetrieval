Orthogonal functions

In mathematics, two functions

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are called orthogonal if their inner product

 
  is zero for f ≠ g.
Choice of inner product
How the inner product of two functions is defined may vary depending on context. However, a typical definition of an inner product for functions is



with appropriate integration boundaries. Here, the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate of f.
For another perspective on this inner product, suppose approximating vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are created whose entries are the values of the functions f and g, sampled at equally spaced points. Then this inner product between f and g can be roughly understood as the dot product between approximating vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , in the limit as the number of sampling points goes to infinity. Thus, roughly, two functions are orthogonal if their approximating vectors are perpendicular (under this common inner product).1
In differential equations
Solutions of linear differential equations with boundary conditions can often be written as a weighted sum of orthogonal solution functions (a.k.a. eigenfunctions), leading to generalized Fourier series.
