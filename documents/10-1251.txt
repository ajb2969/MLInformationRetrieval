   4-formylbenzenesulfonate dehydrogenase      4-formylbenzenesulfonate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 4-formylbenzenesulfonate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-formylbenzenesulfonate + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-sulfobenzoate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-formylbenzenesulfonate , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-sulfobenzoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-formylbenzenesulfonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation .
