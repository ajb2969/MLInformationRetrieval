   Inositol-phosphate phosphatase      Inositol-phosphate phosphatase   In enzymology , an inositol-phosphate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   myo-inositol phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   myo-inositol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are myo-inositol phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are myo-inositol and phosphate .  This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : streptomycin  biosynthesis , inositol phosphate metabolism, and phosphatidylinositol signaling system.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is myo-inositol-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include:   myo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase,  inositol 1-phosphatase,  L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate phosphatase,  myo-inositol 1-phosphatase,  inositol phosphatase,  inositol monophosphate phosphatase,  inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase,  myo-inositol-1(or 4)-phosphate phosphohydrolase,  myo-inositol monophosphatase, and  myo-inositol-1-phosphatase.
