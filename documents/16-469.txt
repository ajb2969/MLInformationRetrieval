   Quadratrix of Hippias      Quadratrix of Hippias   The quadratrix or trisectrix of Hippias (also quadratrix of Dinostratos ) is a curve , which is created by a uniform motion. It is one of the oldest examples for a kinematic curve, that is a curve created through motion. Its discovery is attributed to the Greek sophist Hippias of Elis , who used it around 420 BC in an attempt to solve the angle trisection problem (hence trisectrix ). Later around 350 BC Dinostratus used it in an attempt to solve the problem of squaring the circle (hence quadratrix ).  Definition  Consider a square ABCD with an inscribed quarter circle centered in A , such that the side of the square is the circle's radius. Let E be a point that travels with a constant angular velocity on the quarter circle arc from D to B . In addition the point F travels with a constant velocity from D to A on the line segment , in such away that E and F start at the same time at D and arrive at the same time in B and D . Now the quadratrix is defined as the locus of the intersection of the parallel to  through F and the line segment . 1 2  If one places such a square ABCD with side length a in a (cartesian) coordinate system with the side  on the x -axis and vertex A in the origin, then the quadratix is described by a planar curve    γ  :    (  0  ,   π  2   ]   →   ℝ  2       normal-:  γ   normal-→   0    π  2     superscript  ℝ  2      \gamma:(0,\tfrac{\pi}{2}]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}   with:         γ   (  t  )    =   (      x   (  t  )         y   (  t  )       )   =   (        2  a   π   t   cot   (  t  )            2  a   π   t      )           γ  t       x  t       y  t                  2  a   π   t    t            2  a   π   t        \gamma(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\
 y(t)\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{2a}{\pi}t\cot(t)\\
 \frac{2a}{\pi}t\end{pmatrix}        This description can also be used to give an analytical rather than a geometric definition of the quadratrix and to extend it beyond the    (  0  ,   π  2   ]     0    π  2     (0,\tfrac{\pi}{2}]   interval. It does however remain undefined at the singularities of    cot   (  t  )       t    \cot(t)   except for the case of    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   , where due to      lim   t  →  0     t   cot   (  t  )      =  1        subscript    normal-→  t  0      t    t     1    \lim_{t\to 0}t\cot(t)=1   the singularity is removable and hence yields a continuous planar curve on the interval    (   -  π   ,  π  )       π   π    (-\pi,\pi)    3 4  To describe the quadratrix as simple function rather than planar curve, it is advantageous to switch the y -axis and the x -axis, that is to place the side  on y -axis rather than on the x -axis. Then the quadratrix is given by the following function f (x): 5 6         f   (  x  )    =   x  ⋅   cot   (    π   2  a    ⋅  x   )           f  x    normal-⋅  x     normal-⋅    π    2  a    x       f(x)=x\cdot\cot\left(\frac{\pi}{2a}\cdot x\right)        Angle trisection  thumb|right|upright=1.0|quadratrix compass  thumb|right|upright=1.25|angle trisection The trisection of an arbitrary angle using only ruler and compasses is impossible. However if the quadratrix is allowed as an additional tool, it is possible to divide an arbitrary angle into n equal segment and hence a trisection ( n = 3) becomes possible. In practical terms the quadratrix can be drawn with the help of a template or a quadratrix compass (see drawing). 7 8  Since by the definition of the quadratrix the traversed angle is proportional to the traversed segment of the associated squares' side dividing that segment on the side into n equal parts yields a partition of the associated angle as well. Dividing the line segment into n equal parts with ruler and compass is possible due to the intercept theorem .  For a given angle BAE ( ≤ 90°) construct a square ABCD over its leg . The other leg of the angle intersects the quadratrix of the square in a point G and the parallel line to the leg  through G intersects the side  of the square in F . Now the segment  corresponds to the angle BAE and due to the definition of the quadratrix any division of the segment  in n equidistant parts yields a corresponding division of the angle BAE into n parts of equal size. To divide the segment  into n equidistant parts proceed as follows. Draw a ray a with origin in A and then draw n equidistant segments (of arbitrary length) on it. Connect the endpoint O of the last segment with F and draw lines parallel to  through all the endpoints of the remaining n − 1 segments on , these parallel lines divide the segment  on  into n equidistant segments. Now draw parallel lines to  through the endpoints of those segments on , these parallel lines will intersects the trisectrix. Connecting those points of intersection with A yields a partition of angle BAE into n parts of equal size. 9  Since not all points of the trisectrix can be constructed with circle and compass alone, it is really required as an additional tool next to compass and circle. However it is possible to construct a dense subset of the trisectrix by circle and compass, so while you cannot assure an exact division of an angle into n parts without a given trisectrix, you can construct an arbitrarily close approximation by circle and compass alone. 10 11  Squaring of the circle  thumb|right|upright=1.25|squaring of a quarter circle with radius 1 The squaring the circle with ruler and compass is impossible. However if one allows the quadratrix of Hippias as an additional construction tool, the squaring of the circle becomes possible due to Dinostratus' theorem . It allows to turn a quarter circle into square of the same area, hence a square with twice the side length has the same area as the full circle.  According to Dinostratus' theorem the quadratrix divides one of the sides of the associated square in a ratio of    2  π      2  π    \tfrac{2}{\pi}   . 12 For a given quarter circle with radius r one constructs the associated square ABCD with side length r . The quadratrix intersect the side  in J with     |    A  J   ¯   |   =    2  π   r          normal-¯    A  J         2  π   r     \left|\overline{AJ}\right|=\tfrac{2}{\pi}r   . Now one constructs a line segment  of length r being perpendicular to . Then the through A and K intersects the extension of the side  in L and from the intercept theorem follows     |    B  L   ¯   |   =    π  2   r          normal-¯    B  L         π  2   r     \left|\overline{BL}\right|=\tfrac{\pi}{2}r   . Extending  to the right by a new line segment     |    B  O   ¯   |   =   r  2          normal-¯    B  O       r  2     \left|\overline{BO}\right|=\tfrac{r}{2}   yields the rectangle BLNO with sides  und  the area of which matches the area of the quarter circle. This rectangle can be transformed into a square of the same area with the help of Euclid's geometric mean theorem . One extends the side  by a line segment     |    O  Q   ¯   |   =   |    B  O   ¯   |   =   r  2            normal-¯    O  Q        normal-¯    B  O            r  2      \left|\overline{OQ}\right|=\left|\overline{BO}\right|=\tfrac{r}{2}   and draws a half circle to right of , which has  as its diameter. The extension of  meets the half circle in R and due to Thales' theorem the line segment  is the altitude of the right angle triangle QNR . Hence the geometric mean theorem can be applied, which means that  forms the side of a square OUSR with the same area as the rectangle BLNO and hence as the quarter circle. 13  Note that the point J , where the quadratrix meets the side  of the associated square, is one of the points of the quadratrix that cannot be constructed with ruler and compass alone and not even with the help of the quadratrix compass based on the original geometric definition (see drawing). This is due to the fact, that the 2 uniformly moving lines coincide and hence there exists no unique intersection point. However relying on the generalized definition of the quadratrix as a function or planar curve allows for J being a point on the quadratrix. 14 15  Historical sources  The quadratrix is mentioned in the works of Proklos (412–485), Pappos (3rd and 4th centuries) and Iamblichus (c. 240–325). Proklos names Hippias as the inventor of a curve called quadratrix and describes somewhere else how Hippias has applied the curve on the trisection problem. Pappos only mentions how a curve named quadratrix was used by Dinostratos, Nicomedes and others to square the circle. He neither mentions Hippias nor attributes the invention of the quadratrix to a particular person. Iamblichus just writes in a single line, that a curve called quadratrix was used bei Nicomedes to square the circle. 16 17 18  Though based on Proklos' name for the curve it is conceivable that Hippias himself used it for squaring the circle or some other curvilinear figure, most math historians assume that Hippias invented the curve but used it only for the trisection of angles. Its use for squaring the circle only occurred decades later and was due to mathematicians like Dinostratos and Nicomedes. This interpretation of the historical sources goes back to the German mathematician and historian Moritz Cantor . 19 20  References   Claudi Alsina, Roger B.
