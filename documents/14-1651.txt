Generalized integer gamma distribution

In probability and statistics, the generalized integer gamma distribution (GIG) is the distribution of the sum of independent gamma distributed random variables, all with integer shape parameters and different rate parameters. This is a special case of the generalized chi-squared distribution. A related concept is the generalized near-integer gamma distribution (GNIG).
Definition
The random variable

 
  has a gamma distribution with shape parameter

 
  and rate parameter

 
  if its probability density function is


 
  and this fact is denoted by 
 
 

Let 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
independent random variables, with all 
 
 
 
  being positive integers and all 
 
 
 
  different. In other words, each variable has the Erlang distribution with different shape parameters. The uniqueness of each shape parameter comes without loss of generality, because any case where some of the 
 
 
 
  are equal would be treated by first adding the corresponding variables: this sum would have a gamma distribution with the same rate parameter and a shape parameter which is equal to the sum of the shape parameters in the original distributions.
Then the random variable Y defined by


 
  has a GIG (generalized integer gamma) distribution of depth 
 
 
 
  with shape parameters

 
  and rate parameters


 
 . This fact is denoted by


 
  It is also a special case of the generalized chi-squared distribution.
Properties
The probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of Y are respectively given by123

Alternative expressions are available in the literature on generalized chi-squared distribution, which is a field wherecomputer algorithms have been available for some years.
Generalization
The GNIG (generalized near-integer gamma) distribution of depth 
 
 
 
  is the distribution of the random variable4


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two independent random variables, where 
 
 
 
  is a positive non-integer real and where 
 
 

 
 .
Properties
The probability density function of 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  and the cumulative distribution function is given by


 
  where


 
  with 
 
 
 
  given by ()-() above. In the above expressions 
 
 
 
  is the Kummer confluent hypergeometric function. This function has usually very good convergence properties and is nowadays easily handled by a number of software packages.
Applications
The GIG and GNIG distributions are the basis for the exact and near-exact distributions of a large number of likelihood ratio test statistics and related statistics used in multivariate analysis. 56789 More precisely, this application is usually for the exact and near-exact distributions of the negative logarithm of such statistics. If necessary, it is then easy, through a simple transformation, to obtain the corresponding exact or near-exact distributions for the corresponding likelihood ratio test statistics themselves. 101112
The GIG distribution is also the basis for a number of wrapped distributions in the wrapped gamma family. 13
As being a special case of the generalized chi-squared distribution, there are many other applications; for example, in renewal theory14 and in multi-antenna wireless communications.15 16 17 18
Computer modules
Modules for the computation of the p.d.f. and c.d.f. of both the GIG and the GNIG distributions are made available at this web-page on near-exact distributions.
