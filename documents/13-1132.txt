   Horizontal form      Horizontal form   A differentiable r-form    α   α   \alpha   on a fiber bundle E is said to be a horizontal form if     α   (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  r   )    =  0        α    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  r     0    \alpha(v_{1},...,v_{r})=0   whenever at least one of the vectors     v  1   ,   v  r       subscript  v  1    subscript  v  r     v_{1},v_{r}   is vertical .
