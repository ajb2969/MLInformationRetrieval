Stokes operator

The Stokes operator, named after George Gabriel Stokes, is an unbounded linear operator used in the theory of partial differential equations, specifically in the fields of fluid dynamics and electromagnetics.
Definition
If we define 
 
 
 
  as the Leray-Helmholtz projector onto divergence free vector fields, then the Stokes Operator 
 
 
 
  is defined by



where 
 
 
 
  is the Laplacian. Since 
 
 
 
  is unbounded, we must also give its domain of definition, which is defined as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  is a bounded open set in 
 
 
 
  (usually n = 2 or 3), 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the standard Sobolev spaces, and the divergence of 
 
 
 
  is taken in the distribution sense.
Properties
For a given domain 
 
 
 
  which is open, bounded, and has 
 
 
 
  boundary, the Stokes operator 
 
 
 
  is a self-adjoint positive-definite operator with respect to the 
 
 
 
  inner product. It has an orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions 
 
 
 
  corresponding to eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  which satisfy



and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Note that the smallest eigenvalue is unique and non-zero. These properties allow one to define powers of the Stokes operator. Let 
 
 
 
  be a real number. We define 
 
 
 
  by its action on 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
  inner product.
The inverse 
 
 
 
  of the Stokes operator is a bounded, compact, self-adjoint operator in the space 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the trace operator. Furthermore, 
 
 
 
  is injective.
