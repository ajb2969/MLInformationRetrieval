   Ε-quadratic form      Ε-quadratic form   In mathematics , specifically the theory of quadratic forms , an ε-quadratic form is a generalization of quadratic forms to skew-symmetric settings and to *-rings ; ε = ±1, accordingly for symmetric or skew-symmetric. They are also called     (  -  )   n     superscript   n    (-)^{n}   -quadratic forms, particularly in the context of surgery theory .  There is the related notion of ε-symmetric forms , which generalizes symmetric forms , skew-symmetric forms (= symplectic forms ), Hermitian forms , and skew-Hermitian forms . More briefly, one may refer to quadratic, skew-quadratic, symmetric, and skew-symmetric forms, where "skew" means (−) and the * (involution) is implied.  The theory is 2-local: away from 2 , ε-quadratic forms are equivalent to ε-symmetric forms: half the symmetrization map (below) gives an explicit isomorphism.  Definition  ε-symmetric forms and ε-quadratic forms are defined as follows. 1  Given a module M over a *-ring  R , let B(M) be the space of bilinear forms on M , and let T : B(M) → B(M) be the " conjugate transpose " involution  B(u,v) ↦ B(v,u) *. Since multiplication by −1 is also an involution and commutes with linear maps, − T is also an involution. Thus we can write ε = ±1 and ε T is an involution, either T or − T (ε can be more general than ±1; see below). Define the ε-symmetric forms as the invariants of ε T , and the ε-quadratic forms are the coinvariants .  As an exact sequence,      0  →    Q  ϵ    (  M  )    →   B   (  M  )     ⟶   1  -   ϵ  T      B   (  M  )    →    Q  ϵ    (  M  )    →  0       normal-→  0     superscript  Q  ϵ   M     normal-→      B  M      superscript  normal-⟶    1    ϵ  T         B  M     normal-→       subscript  Q  ϵ   M     normal-→    0     0\to Q^{\epsilon}(M)\to B(M)\stackrel{1-\epsilon T}{\longrightarrow}B(M)\to Q_%
 {\epsilon}(M)\to 0   As kernel and cokernel ,        Q  ϵ    (  M  )    :=    ker    (   1  -   ϵ  T    )       assign     superscript  Q  ϵ   M     ker    1    ϵ  T       Q^{\epsilon}(M):=\mbox{ker}\,(1-\epsilon T)           Q  ϵ    (  M  )    :=    coker    (   1  -   ϵ  T    )       assign     subscript  Q  ϵ   M     coker    1    ϵ  T       Q_{\epsilon}(M):=\mbox{coker}\,(1-\epsilon T)     The notation Q ε ( M ), Q ε ( M ) follows the standard notation M G , M G for the invariants and coinvariants for a group action , here of the order 2 group (an involution).  Composition of the inclusion and quotient maps (but not 1 − ε T ) as      Q  ϵ    (  M  )    →   B   (  M  )    →    Q  ϵ    (  M  )         normal-→     superscript  Q  ϵ   M     B  M     normal-→       subscript  Q  ϵ   M      Q^{\epsilon}(M)\to B(M)\to Q_{\epsilon}(M)   yields a map Q ε ( M ) → Q ε ( M ): every ε-symmetric form determines an ε-quadratic form.  Symmetrization  Conversely, one can define a reverse homomorphism "1 + ε T ": Q ε ( M ) → Q ε ( M ), called the symmetrization map (since it yields a symmetric form) by taking any lift of a quadratic form and multiplying it by 1 + ε T . This is a symmetric form because (1 − ε T )(1 + ε T ) = 1 − T 2 = 0, so it is in the kernel. More precisely,      (   1  +   ϵ  T    )   B   (  M  )    <    Q  ϵ    (  M  )            1    ϵ  T    B  M      superscript  Q  ϵ   M     (1+\epsilon T)B(M)   . The map is well-defined by the same equation: choosing a different lift corresponds to adding a multiple of (1 − ε T ), but this vanishes after multiplying by (1 + ε T ). Thus every ε-quadratic form determines an ε-symmetric form.  Composing these two maps either way: Q ε ( M ) → Q ε ( M ) → Q ε ( M ) or Q ε ( M ) → Q ε ( M ) → Q ε ( M ) yields multiplication by 2, and thus these maps are bijective if 2 is invertible in R , with the inverse given by multiplication with 1/2.  An ε-quadratic form ψ ∈ Q ε ( M ) is called non-degenerate if the associated ε-symmetric form (1 + ε T )(ψ) is non-degenerate.  Generalization from *  If the * is trivial, then ε = ±1, and "away from 2" means that 2 is invertible: 1/2 ∈ R .  More generally, one can take for ε ∈ R any element such that ε*ε =1. ε = ±1 always satisfy this, but so does any element of norm 1, such as complex numbers of unit norm.  Similarly, in the presence of a non-trivial *, ε-symmetric forms are equivalent to ε-quadratic forms if there is an element λ ∈ R such that λ* + λ = 1. If * is trivial, this is equivalent to 2λ = 1 or λ = 1/2, while if * is non-trivial there can be multiple possible λ; for example, over the complex numbers any number with real part 1/2 is such a λ.  For instance, in the ring    R  =   𝐙   [    1  +  i   2   ]        R    𝐙   delimited-[]      1  i   2       R=\mathbf{Z}\left[\textstyle{\frac{1+i}{2}}\right]   (the integral lattice for the quadratic form 2 x 2 − 2 x +1), with complex conjugation,    λ  =    1  ±  i   2       λ     plus-or-minus  1  i   2     \lambda=\textstyle{\frac{1\pm i}{2}}   are two such elements, though 1/2 ∉ R .  Intuition  In terms of matrices (we take V to be 2-dimensional), if * is trivial:   matrices    (     a    b      c    d     )      a  b    c  d     \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}   correspond to bilinear forms  the subspace of symmetric matrices    (     a    b      b    c     )      a  b    b  c     \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 b&c\end{pmatrix}   correspond to symmetric forms  the subspace of (−1)-symmetric matrices    (     0    b       -  b     0     )      0  b      b   0     \begin{pmatrix}0&b\\
 -b&0\end{pmatrix}   correspond to symplectic forms  the bilinear form    (     a    b      c    d     )      a  b    c  d     \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}   yields the quadratic form           a   x  2    +   b  x  y   +   c  y  x   +   d   y  2     =    a   x  2    +    (   b  +  c   )   x  y   +   d    y  2              a   superscript  x  2      b  x  y     c  y  x     d   superscript  y  2         a   superscript  x  2        b  c   x  y     d   superscript  y  2       ax^{2}+bxy+cyx+dy^{2}=ax^{2}+(b+c)xy+dy^{2}\,   ,      the map 1 + T from quadratic forms to symmetric forms maps     e   x  2    +   f  x  y   +   g   y  2          e   superscript  x  2      f  x  y     g   superscript  y  2      ex^{2}+fxy+gy^{2}      to    (      2  e     f      f     2  g      )        2  e   f    f    2  g      \begin{pmatrix}2e&f\\
 f&2g\end{pmatrix}   , for example by lifting to    (     e    f      0    g     )      e  f    0  g     \begin{pmatrix}e&f\\
 0&g\end{pmatrix}   and then adding to transpose. Mapping back to quadratic forms yields double the original      2  e   x  2    +   2  f  x  y   +   2  g   y  2     =   2   (    e   x  2    +   f  x  y   +   g   y  2     )            2  e   superscript  x  2      2  f  x  y     2  g   superscript  y  2       2      e   superscript  x  2      f  x  y     g   superscript  y  2        2ex^{2}+2fxy+2gy^{2}=2(ex^{2}+fxy+gy^{2})   .  If * is complex conjugation, then   the subspace of symmetric matrices are the Hermitian matrices     (     a    z       z  ¯     c     )      a  z     normal-¯  z   c     \begin{pmatrix}a&z\\
 \bar{z}&c\end{pmatrix}     the subspace of skew-symmetric matrices are the skew-Hermitian matrices     (      b  i     z       -  z      d  i      )        b  i   z      z     d  i      \begin{pmatrix}bi&z\\
 -z&di\end{pmatrix}      Refinements  An intuitive way to understand an ε-quadratic form is to think of it as a quadratic refinement of its associated ε-symmetric form.  For instance, in defining a Clifford algebra over a general field or ring, one quotients the tensor algebra by relations coming from the symmetric form  and the quadratic form: vw + wv = 2 B(v,w) and     v  2   =   Q   (  v  )         superscript  v  2     Q  v     v^{2}=Q(v)   . If 2 is invertible, this second relation follows from the first (as the quadratic form can be recovered from the associated bilinear form), but at 2 this additional refinement is necessary.  Examples  An easy example for an ε-quadratic form is the standard hyperbolic ε-quadratic form       H  ϵ    (  R  )    ∈    Q  ϵ    (   R  ⊕   R  *    )           subscript  H  ϵ   R      subscript  Q  ϵ    direct-sum  R   superscript  R        H_{\epsilon}(R)\in Q_{\epsilon}(R\oplus R^{*})   . (Here, R * := Hom R ( R,R ) denotes the dual of the R -module R .) It is given by the bilinear form     (   (   v  1   ,   f  1   )   ,   (   v  2   ,   f  2   )   )   ↦    f  2    (   v  1   )       maps-to     subscript  v  1    subscript  f  1      subscript  v  2    subscript  f  2        subscript  f  2    subscript  v  1      ((v_{1},f_{1}),(v_{2},f_{2}))\mapsto f_{2}(v_{1})   . The standard hyperbolic ε-quadratic form is needed for the definition of L-theory .  For the field of two elements R = F 2 there is no difference between (+1)-quadratic and (−1)-quadratic forms, which are just called quadratic forms . The Arf invariant of a nonsingular quadratic form over F 2 is an F 2 -valued invariant with important applications in both algebra and topology, and plays a role similar to that played by the discriminant of a quadratic form in characteristic not equal to two.  Manifolds  The free part of the middle homology group (with integer coefficients) of an oriented even-dimensional manifold has an ε-symmetric form, via Poincaré duality , the intersection form . In the case of singly even dimension      4  k   +  2   ,        4  k   2    4k+2,   this is skew-symmetric, while for doubly even dimension     4  k   ,      4  k    4k,   this is symmetric. Geometrically this corresponds to intersection, where two n /2-dimensional submanifolds in an n -dimensional manifold generically intersect in a 0-dimensional submanifold (a set of points), by adding codimension . For singly even dimension the order switches sign, while for doubly even dimension order does not change sign, hence the ε-symmetry. The simplest cases are for the product of spheres, where the product     S   2  k    ×   S   2  k         superscript  S    2  k     superscript  S    2  k      S^{2k}\times S^{2k}   and     S    2  k   +  1    ×   S    2  k   +  1         superscript  S      2  k   1     superscript  S      2  k   1      S^{2k+1}\times S^{2k+1}   respectively give the symmetric form    (     0    1      1    0     )      0  1    1  0     \left(\begin{smallmatrix}0&1\\
 1&0\end{smallmatrix}\right)   and skew-symmetric form     (     0    1       -  1     0     )   .      0  1      1   0     \left(\begin{smallmatrix}0&1\\
 -1&0\end{smallmatrix}\right).   In dimension two, this yields a torus, and taking the connected sum of g tori yields the surface of genus g, whose middle homology has the standard hyperbolic form.  With additional structure, this ε-symmetric form can be refined to an ε-quadratic form. For doubly even dimension this is integer valued, while for singly even dimension this is only defined up to parity, and takes values in Z /2. For example, given a framed manifold , one can produce such a refinement. For singly even dimension, the Arf invariant of this skew-quadratic form is the Kervaire invariant .  Given an oriented surface Σ embedded in R 3 , the middle homology group H 1 (Σ) carries not only a skew-symmetric form (via intersection), but also a skew-quadratic form, which can be seen as a quadratic refinement, via self-linking. The skew-symmetric form is an invariant of the surface Σ, whereas the skew-quadratic form is an invariant of the embedding Σ ⊂ R 3 , e.g. for the Seifert surface of a knot . The Arf invariant of the skew-quadratic form is a framed cobordism invariant generating the first stable homotopy group     π  1  s     subscript   superscript  π  s   1    \pi^{s}_{1}   .  For the standard embedded torus , the skew-symmetric form is given by    (     0    1       -  1     0     )      0  1      1   0     \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 -1&0\end{pmatrix}   (with respect to the standard symplectic basis ), and the skew-quadratic refinement is given by xy with respect to this basis: Q (1,0) = Q (0,1)=0: the basis curves don't self-link; and Q (1,1) = 1: a (1,1) self-links, as in the Hopf fibration . (This form has Arf invariant 0, and thus this embedded torus has Kervaire invariant 0.)
