   Favard constant      Favard constant   In mathematics , the Favard constant , also called the Akhiezer–Krein–Favard constant , of order r is defined as        K  r   =    4  π     ∑   k  =  0   ∞     [     (   -  1   )   k     2  k   +  1    ]    r  +  1       .       subscript  K  r       4  π     superscript   subscript     k  0       superscript   delimited-[]     superscript    1   k       2  k   1       r  1        K_{r}=\frac{4}{\pi}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k+1}\right%
 ]^{r+1}.     This constant is named after the French mathematician Jean Favard , and after the Soviet mathematicians Naum Akhiezer and Mark Krein .  Uses  This constant is used in solutions of several extremal problems, for example   Favard's constant is the sharp constant in Jackson's inequality for trigonometric polynomials  the sharp constants in the Landau–Kolmogorov inequality are expressed via Favard's constants  Norms of periodic perfect splines .
