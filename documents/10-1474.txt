Glutamate synthase (ferredoxin)

In enzymology, a glutamate synthase (ferredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 L-glutamate + 2 oxidized ferredoxin 
 
 
 
  L-glutamine + 2-oxoglutarate + 2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamate and oxidized ferredoxin, whereas its 4 products are L-glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, reduced ferredoxin, and H+.
Classification
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (transaminating). Other names in common use include:

ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase,
ferredoxin-glutamate synthase,
glutamate synthase (ferredoxin-dependent), and
ferredoxin-glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (Fd-GOGAT).

Biological role
This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism. It has 5 cofactors: FAD, iron, sulfur, iron-sulfur, and flavoprotein.
