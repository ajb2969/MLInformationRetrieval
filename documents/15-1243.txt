   23S rRNA (guanine1835-N2)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (guanine1835-N2)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (guanine 1835 -N 2 )-methyltransferase (, ygjO (gene) , rlmG (gene) , ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase G ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine 1835 -N 2 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 1835 in 23S rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 -methylguanine 1835 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme methylates 23S rRNA in vitro, assembled 50S subunits are not a substrate.
