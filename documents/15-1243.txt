23S rRNA (guanine1835-N2)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (guanine1835-N2)-methyltransferase (, ygjO (gene), rlmG (gene), ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase G) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine1835-N2)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine1835 in 23S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine1835 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme methylates 23S rRNA in vitro, assembled 50S subunits are not a substrate.
