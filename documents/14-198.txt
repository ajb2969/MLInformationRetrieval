   Pinched torus      Pinched torus   In mathematics , and especially topology and differential geometry , a pinched torus (or croissant surface ) is a kind of two-dimensional surface . It gets its name from its resemblance to a torus that has been pinched at a single point. A pinched torus is an example of an orientable , compact 2-dimensional pseudomanifold . 1  Parametrisation  A pinched torus is easily parametrisable. Let us write . An example of such a parametrisation − which was used to plot the picture − is given by where:       f   (  x  ,  y  )    =   (   g   (  x  ,  y  )    cos  x    ,   g   (  x  ,  y  )    sin  x    ,     sin    (   x  2   )     sin  y    )         f   x  y       g   x  y     x      g   x  y     x          x  2      y       f(x,y)=\left(g(x,y)\cos x,g(x,y)\sin x,\sin\!\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\sin y\right)     Topology  Topologically, the pinched torus is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of a sphere and a circle. 2 3 It is homeomorphic to a sphere with two distinct points being identified . 4 5  Homology  Let P denote the pinched torus. The homology groups of P over the integers can be calculated. They are given by:          H  0    (  P  ,   \Z   )    ≅   \Z    ,      H  1    (  P  ,   \Z   )    ≅   \Z    ,     and    H  2    (  P  ,   \Z   )    ≅   \Z      .     formulae-sequence       subscript  H  0    P  \Z    \Z    formulae-sequence       subscript  H  1    P  \Z    \Z       and   subscript  H  2    P  \Z    \Z      H_{0}(P,\Z)\cong\Z,\ H_{1}(P,\Z)\cong\Z,\ \text{and}\ H_{2}(P,\Z)\cong\Z.     Cohomology  The cohomology groups of P over the integers can be calculated. They are given by:          H  0    (  P  ,   \Z   )    ≅   \Z    ,      H  1    (  P  ,   \Z   )    ≅   \Z    ,     and    H  2    (  P  ,   \Z   )    ≅   \Z      .     formulae-sequence       superscript  H  0    P  \Z    \Z    formulae-sequence       superscript  H  1    P  \Z    \Z       and   superscript  H  2    P  \Z    \Z      H^{0}(P,\Z)\cong\Z,\ H^{1}(P,\Z)\cong\Z,\ \text{and}\ H^{2}(P,\Z)\cong\Z.
