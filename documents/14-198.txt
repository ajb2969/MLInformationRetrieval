Pinched torus

 In mathematics, and especially topology and differential geometry, a pinched torus (or croissant surface) is a kind of two-dimensional surface. It gets its name from its resemblance to a torus that has been pinched at a single point. A pinched torus is an example of an orientable, compact 2-dimensional pseudomanifold.1
Parametrisation
A pinched torus is easily parametrisable. Let us write . An example of such a parametrisation − which was used to plot the picture − is given by  where:



Topology
Topologically, the pinched torus is homotopy equivalent to the wedge of a sphere and a circle.23 It is homeomorphic to a sphere with two distinct points being identified.45
Homology
Let P denote the pinched torus. The homology groups of P over the integers can be calculated. They are given by:



Cohomology
The cohomology groups of P over the integers can be calculated. They are given by:
