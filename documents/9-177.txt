   Solar neutrino unit      Solar neutrino unit   The solar neutrino unit (SNU) is a unit of Solar neutrino flux widely used in neutrino astronomy and radiochemical neutrino experiments. It is equal to the neutrino flux producing 10 −36 captures per target atom per second. 1 It is convenient given the very low event rates in radiochemical experiments. Typical rate is expected to be from tens SNU to hundred SNU. 2  In principle there are two ways of detecting solar neutrinos : radiochemical and real time experiments. The principle of radiochemical experiments is the reaction of the form        Z   N  A   +   ν  e     ⟶   N  -  1   A     (   Z  +  1   )   +   e  -        subscript   superscript  normal-⟶  A     N  1       superscript   subscript  Z  N   A    subscript  ν  e        Z  1    superscript  e       {}^{A}_{N}Z+\nu_{e}\longrightarrow^{A}_{N-1}(Z+1)+e^{-}   .  The daughter nucleus 's decay is used in the detection. Production rate of the daughter nucleus is given by    R  =   N   ∫   Φ   (  E  )   σ   (  E  )   d  E         R    N      normal-Φ  E  σ  E  d  E       R=N\int\Phi(E)\sigma(E)dE   , where      Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is the solar neutrino flux     σ   σ   \sigma   is the cross section for the radiochemical reaction     N   N   N   is the number of target atoms.   With typical neutrino flux of 10 10 cm −2 s −1 and a typical interaction cross section of about 10 −45 cm 2 , about 10 30 target atoms are required to produce one event per day. Taking into account that 1 mole is equal to 6.022 atoms, this number corresponds to ktons of the target substances, whereas present neutrino detectors operate at much lower quantities of those.
