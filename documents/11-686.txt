Blasticidin-S deaminase




Blasticidin-S deaminase

In enzymology, a blasticidin-S deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

blasticidin S + H2O 
 
 
 
  deaminohydroxyblasticidin S + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are blasticidin S and H2O, whereas its two products are deaminohydroxyblasticidin S and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is blasticidin-S aminohydrolase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
