Stochastic vector redirects here. For the concept of a random vector, see Multivariate random variable.


In mathematics and statistics, a probability vector or stochastic vector is a vector with non-negative entries that add up to one.
The positions (indices) of a probability vector represent the possible outcomes of a discrete random variable, and the vector gives us the probability mass function of that random variable, which is the standard way of characterizing a discrete probability distribution.1
Examples
Here are some examples of probability vectors. The vectors can be either columns or rows.



Geometric interpretation
Writing out the vector components of a vector 
 
 
 
  as



the vector components must sum to one:



Each individual component must have a probability between zero and one:



for all 
 
 
 
 . These two requirements show that stochastic vectors have a geometric interpretation: A stochastic vector is a point on the "far face" of a standard orthogonal simplex. That is, a stochastic vector uniquely identifies a point on the face opposite of the orthogonal corner of the standard simplex.2
Properties

The mean of any probability vector is 
 
 
 
 .
The shortest probability vector has the value 
 
 
 
  as each component of the vector, and has a length of 
 
 
 
 .
The longest probability vector has the value 1 in a single component and 0 in all others, and has a length of 1.
The shortest vector corresponds to maximum uncertainty, the longest to maximum certainty.
The length of a probability vector is equal to 
 
 
 
 ; where 
 
 
 
  is the variance of the elements of the probability vector.
