   Probability vector      Probability vector    Stochastic vector redirects here. For the concept of a random vector, see Multivariate random variable .    In mathematics and statistics , a probability vector or stochastic vector is a vector with non-negative entries that add up to one.  The positions (indices) of a probability vector represent the possible outcomes of a discrete random variable , and the vector gives us the probability mass function of that random variable, which is the standard way of characterizing a discrete probability distribution . 1  Examples  Here are some examples of probability vectors. The vectors can be either columns or rows.         x  0   =   [     0.5      0.25      0.25     ]    ,     x  1   =   [     0      1      0     ]    ,     x  2   =   [     0.65    0.35     ]    ,    x  3   =   [     0.3    0.5    0.07    0.1    0.03     ]       .     formulae-sequence     subscript  x  0     0.5    0.25    0.25      formulae-sequence     subscript  x  1     0    1    0      formulae-sequence     subscript  x  2     0.65  0.35        subscript  x  3     0.3  0.5  0.07  0.1  0.03         x_{0}=\begin{bmatrix}0.5\\

Geometric interpretation  Writing out the vector components of a vector   p   p   p   as       p  =    [      p  1        p  2       ⋮       p  n      ]   or     p  =   [      p  1      p  2     ⋯     p  n      ]       formulae-sequence    p      subscript  p  1      subscript  p  2     normal-⋮     subscript  p  n     or      p     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-⋯   subscript  p  n        p=\begin{bmatrix}p_{1}\\

 }\end{bmatrix}     the vector components must sum to one:        ∑   i  =  1   n    p  i    =  1        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  p  i    1    \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}=1     Each individual component must have a probability between zero and one:      0  ≤   p  i   ≤  1        0   subscript  p  i        1     0\leq p_{i}\leq 1     for all   i   i   i   . These two requirements show that stochastic vectors have a geometric interpretation: A stochastic vector is a point on the "far face" of a standard orthogonal simplex . That is, a stochastic vector uniquely identifies a point on the face opposite of the orthogonal corner of the standard simplex. 2  Properties   The mean of any probability vector is    1  /  n      1  n    1/n   .  The shortest probability vector has the value    1  /  n      1  n    1/n   as each component of the vector, and has a length of    1  /   n       1    n     1/\sqrt{n}   .  The longest probability vector has the value 1 in a single component and 0 in all others, and has a length of 1.  The shortest vector corresponds to maximum uncertainty, the longest to maximum certainty.  The length of a probability vector is equal to      n   σ  2    +   1  /  n            n   superscript  σ  2      1  n      \sqrt{n\sigma^{2}+1/n}   ; where    σ  2     superscript  σ  2    \sigma^{2}   is the variance of the elements of the probability vector.
