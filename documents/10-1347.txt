   Leucoanthocyanidin reductase      Leucoanthocyanidin reductase   In enzymology , a leucoanthocyanidin reductase () (LAR, aka leucocyanidin reductase or LCR) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (2R,3S)-catechin + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (2R,3S)-catechin , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on CH or CH 2 groups with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2R,3S)-catechin:NADP + 4-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called leucocyanidin reductase . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .  The enzyme can be found in the plant Hedysarum sulphurescens and in Vitis vinifera (grape). 1  References  Further reading      "  Category:EC 1.17.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩
