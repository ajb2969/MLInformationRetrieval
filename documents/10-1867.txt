   Succinate—hydroxymethylglutarate CoA-transferase      Succinate—hydroxymethylglutarate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a succinate-hydroxymethylglutarate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate , whereas its two products are succinate and (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include hydroxymethylglutarate coenzyme A-transferase , and dicarboxyl-CoA:dicarboxylic acid coenzyme A transferase .
