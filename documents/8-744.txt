   Homogeneous (large cardinal property)      Homogeneous (large cardinal property)   In set theory and in the context of a large cardinal property , a subset, S , of D is homogeneous for a function f if for some natural number n , $\mathcal{P}_{=n}(D)$ (see Powerset#Subsets of limited cardinality ) is the domain of f and for some element r of the range of f , every member of $\mathcal{P}_{=n}(S)$ is mapped to r . That is, f is constant on the unordered n -tuples of elements of S .  See also   Ramsey's theorem   "  Category:Large cardinals
