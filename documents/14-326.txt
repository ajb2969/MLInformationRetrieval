   Sumner's conjecture      Sumner's conjecture   David Sumner (a graph theorist at the University of South Carolina ) conjectured in 1971 that tournaments are universal graphs for polytrees . More precisely, Sumner's conjecture (also called Sumner's universal tournament conjecture ) states that every orientation of every   n   n   n   -vertex tree is a subgraph of every    (    2  n   -  2   )        2  n   2    (2n-2)   -vertex tournament. 1 The conjecture remains unproven;  call it "one of the most well-known problems on tournaments."  Examples  Let polytree   P   P   P   be a star     K   1  ,   n  -  1       subscript  K   1    n  1      K_{1,n-1}   , in which all edges are oriented outward from the central vertex to the leaves. Then,   P   P   P   cannot be embedded in the tournament formed from the vertices of a regular     2  n   -  3        2  n   3    2n-3   -gon by directing every edge clockwise around the polygon. For, in this tournament, every vertex has indegree and outdegree equal to    n  -  2      n  2    n-2   , while the central vertex in   P   P   P   has larger outdegree    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   . 2 Thus, if true, Sumner's conjecture would give the best possible size of a universal graph for polytrees.  However, in every tournament of     2  n   -  2        2  n   2    2n-2   vertices, the average outdegree is    n  -   3  2       n    3  2     n-\frac{3}{2}   , and the maximum outdegree is an integer greater than or equal to the average. Therefore, there exists a vertex of outdegree     ⌈   n  -   3  2    ⌉   =   n  -  1           n    3  2       n  1     \left\lceil n-\frac{3}{2}\right\rceil=n-1   , which can be used as the central vertex for a copy of   P   P   P   .  Partial results  The following partial results on the conjecture are known.   It is true for all sufficiently large values of   n   n   n   . 3  There is a function    f   (  n  )       f  n    f(n)   with asymptotic growth rate     f   (  n  )    =    2  n   +   o   (  n  )           f  n       2  n     o  n      f(n)=2n+o(n)   with the property that every   n   n   n   -vertex polytree can be embedded as a subgraph of every    f   (  n  )       f  n    f(n)   -vertex tournament. Additionally and more explicitly,     f   (  n  )    ≤    3  n   -  3         f  n       3  n   3     f(n)\leq 3n-3   . 4  There is a function    g   (  k  )       g  k    g(k)   such that tournaments on    n  +   g   (  k  )        n    g  k     n+g(k)   vertices are universal for polytrees with   k   k   k   leaves. 5  There is a function    h   (  n  ,  Δ  )       h   n  normal-Δ     h(n,\Delta)   such that every   n   n   n   -vertex polytree with maximum degree at most   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   forms a subgraph of every tournament with    h   (  n  ,  Δ  )       h   n  normal-Δ     h(n,\Delta)   vertices. When   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is a fixed constant, the asymptotic growth rate of    h   (  n  ,  Δ  )       h   n  normal-Δ     h(n,\Delta)   is    n  +   o   (  n  )        n    o  n     n+o(n)   . 6  Every "near-regular" tournament on     2  n   -  2        2  n   2    2n-2   vertices contains every   n   n   n   -vertex polytree. 7  Every orientation of an   n   n   n   -vertex caterpillar tree with diameter at most four can be embedded as a subgraph of every    (    2  n   -  2   )        2  n   2    (2n-2)   -vertex tournament. 8  Every    (    2  n   -  2   )        2  n   2    (2n-2)   -vertex tournament contains as a subgraph every   n   n   n   -vertex rooted tree . 9   Related conjectures  conjectured that every orientation of an   n   n   n   -vertex path graph (with    n  ≥  8      n  8    n\geq 8   ) can be embedded as a subgraph into every   n   n   n   -vertex tournament. 10 After partial results by  this was proven by .  Havet and Thomassé 11 in turn conjectured a strengthening of Sumner's conjecture, that every tournament on     n  +  k   -  1        n  k   1    n+k-1   vertices contains as a subgraph every polytree with at most   k   k   k   leaves.  conjectured that, whenever a graph   G   G   G   requires     2  n   -  2        2  n   2    2n-2   or more colors in a coloring of   G   G   G   , then every orientation of   G   G   G   contains every orientation of an   n   n   n   -vertex tree. Because complete graphs require a different color for each vertex, Sumner's conjecture would follow immediately from Burr's conjecture. 12 As Burr showed, orientations of graphs whose chromatic number grows quadratically as a function of   n   n   n   are universal for polytrees.
