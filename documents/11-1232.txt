   Dextrin dextranase      Dextrin dextranase   In enzymology , a dextrin dextranase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n + (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)m   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n-1 + (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)m + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n and (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)m , whereas its two products are (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n-1 and (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)m+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,4-alpha-D-glucan:1,6-alpha-D-glucan 6-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include dextrin 6-glucosyltransferase , and dextran dextrinase .  References       "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
