   Malate oxidase      Malate oxidase   In enzymology , a malate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-malate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and O 2 , whereas its two products are oxaloacetate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include FAD-dependent malate oxidase , malic oxidase , and malic dehydrogenase II . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
