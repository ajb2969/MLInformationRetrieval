Malate oxidase




Malate oxidase

In enzymology, a malate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-malate + O2

 
  oxaloacetate + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and O2, whereas its two products are oxaloacetate and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:oxygen oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include FAD-dependent malate oxidase, malic oxidase, and malic dehydrogenase II. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
