   Three point flexural test      Three point flexural test     The three point bending flexural test provides values for the modulus of elasticity in bending     E  f     subscript  E  f    E_{f}   , flexural stress     σ  f     subscript  σ  f    \sigma_{f}   , flexural strain    ϵ  f     subscript  ϵ  f    \epsilon_{f}   and the flexural stress-strain response of the material. The main advantage of a three point flexural test is the ease of the specimen preparation and testing. However, this method has also some disadvantages: the results of the testing method are sensitive to specimen and loading geometry and strain rate.  Testing method  The test method for conducting the test usually involves a specified test fixture on a universal testing machine . Details of the test preparation, conditioning, and conduct affect the test results. The sample is placed on two supporting pins a set distance apart and a third loading pin is lowered from above at a constant rate until sample failure.

The stress intensity factor at the crack tip of a single edge notch bending specimen is 3      K  I     subscript  K  normal-I    \displaystyle K_{\rm I}   where   P   P   P   is the applied load,   B   B   B   is the thickness of the specimen,   a   a   a   is the crack length, and   W   W   W   is the width of the specimen. In a three-point bend test, a fatigue crack is created at the tip of the notch by cyclic loading. The length of the crack is measured. The specimen is then loaded monotonically. A plot of the load versus the crack opening displacement is used to determine the load at which the crack starts growing. This load is substituted into the above formula to find the fracture toughness    K   I  c      subscript  K    I  c     K_{Ic}   .  The ASTM E1290-08 Standard suggests the relation       K  I   =      6  P    B  W       a   1  /  2     Y        subscript  K  normal-I      continued-fraction    6  P     B  W     superscript  a    1  2    Y     K_{\rm I}=\cfrac{6P}{BW}\,a^{1/2}\,Y   where       Y  =     1.99  -    a  /   W     (   1  -   a  /  W    )    (    2.15  -    3.93  a   /  W    +   2.7    (   a  /  W   )   2     )       (   1  +    2  a   /  W    )     (   1  -   a  /  W    )    3  /  2        .      Y   continued-fraction    1.99      a  W     1    a  W        2.15      3.93  a   W      2.7   superscript    a  W   2           1      2  a   W     superscript    1    a  W      3  2        Y=\cfrac{1.99-a/W\,(1-a/W)(2.15-3.93a/W+2.7(a/W)^{2})}{(1+2a/W)(1-a/W)^{3/2}}\,.   The predicted values of    K  I     subscript  K  normal-I    K_{\rm I}   are nearly identical for the ASTM and Bower equations for crack lengths less than 0.6   W   W   W   .
