Koecher–Vinberg theorem

In operator algebra, the Koecher–Vinberg theorem is a reconstruction theorem for real Jordan algebras. It was proved independently by Max Koecher in 19571 and Ernest Vinberg in 1961.2 It provides a one-to-one correspondence between formally real Jordan algebras and so-called domains of positivity. Thus it links operator algebraic and convex order theoretic views on state spaces of physical systems.
Statement
A convex cone

 
  is called regular if 
 
 
 
  whenever both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are in the closure 
 
 
 
 .
A convex cone 
 
 
 
  in a vector space

 
  with an inner product has a dual cone

 
 . The cone is called self-dual when 
 
 
 
 . It is called homogeneous when to any two points 
 
 
 
  there is a real linear transformation

 
  that restricts to a bijection 
 
 
 
  and satisfies 
 
 
 
 .
The Koecher–Vinberg theorem now states that these properties precisely characterize the positive cones of Jordan algebras.
Theorem: There is a one-to-one correspondence between formally real Jordan algebras and convex cones that are:

open;
regular;
homogeneous;
self-dual.

Convex cones satisfying these four properties are called domains of positivity or symmetric cones. The domain of positivity associated with a real Jordan algebra 
 
 
 
  is the interior of the 'positive' cone 
 
 
 
 .
