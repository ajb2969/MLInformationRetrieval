   Koecher–Vinberg theorem      Koecher–Vinberg theorem   In operator algebra , the Koecher–Vinberg theorem is a reconstruction theorem for real Jordan algebras . It was proved independently by Max Koecher in 1957 1 and Ernest Vinberg in 1961. 2 It provides a one-to-one correspondence between formally real Jordan algebras and so-called domains of positivity. Thus it links operator algebraic and convex  order theoretic views on state spaces of physical systems.  Statement  A convex cone    C   C   C   is called regular if    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   whenever both   a   a   a   and    -  a      a    -a   are in the closure    C  ¯     normal-¯  C    \overline{C}   .  A convex cone   C   C   C   in a vector space    A   A   A   with an inner product has a dual cone      C  *   =   {   a  ∈  A   :    ∀  b   ∈   C   ⟨  a  ,  b  ⟩    >  0   }        superscript  C     conditional-set    a  A        for-all  b     C   a  b         0       C^{*}=\{a\in A\colon\forall b\in C\langle a,b\rangle>0\}   . The cone is called self-dual when    C  =   C  *       C   superscript  C      C=C^{*}   . It is called homogeneous when to any two points     a  ,  b   ∈  C       a  b   C    a,b\in C   there is a real linear transformation     T  :   A  →  A      normal-:  T   normal-→  A  A     T\colon A\to A   that restricts to a bijection    C  →  C     normal-→  C  C    C\to C   and satisfies     T   (  a  )    =  b        T  a   b    T(a)=b   .  The Koecher–Vinberg theorem now states that these properties precisely characterize the positive cones of Jordan algebras.  Theorem : There is a one-to-one correspondence between formally real Jordan algebras and convex cones that are:   open;  regular;  homogeneous;  self-dual.   Convex cones satisfying these four properties are called domains of positivity or symmetric cones . The domain of positivity associated with a real Jordan algebra   A   A   A   is the interior of the 'positive' cone     A  +   =   {   a  2   :   a  ∈  A   }        subscript  A     conditional-set   superscript  a  2     a  A      A_{+}=\{a^{2}\colon a\in A\}   .
