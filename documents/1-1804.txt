   Nusselt number      Nusselt number   In heat transfer at a boundary (surface) within a fluid , the Nusselt number ( Nu ) is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across ( normal to) the boundary. In this context, convection includes both advection and diffusion . Named after Wilhelm Nusselt , it is a dimensionless number . The conductive component is measured under the same conditions as the heat convection but with a (hypothetically) stagnant (or motionless) fluid. A similar non-dimensional parameter is Biot Number , with the difference that the thermal conductivity is of the solid body and not the fluid.  A Nusselt number close to one, namely convection and conduction of similar magnitude, is characteristic of " slug flow " or laminar flow . A larger Nusselt number corresponds to more active convection, with turbulent flow typically in the 100–1000 range.  The convection and conduction heat flows are parallel to each other and to the surface normal of the boundary surface, and are all perpendicular to the mean fluid flow in the simple case.

Selection of the characteristic length should be in the direction of growth (or thickness) of the boundary layer; some examples of characteristic length are: the outer diameter of a cylinder in (external) cross flow (perpendicular to the cylinder axis), the length of a vertical plate undergoing natural convection , or the diameter of a sphere. For complex shapes, the length may be defined as the volume of the fluid body divided by the surface area.  The thermal conductivity of the fluid is typically (but not always) evaluated at the film temperature , which for engineering purposes may be calculated as the mean -average of the bulk fluid temperature and wall surface temperature.   In contrast to the definition given above, known as average Nusselt number , local Nusselt number is defined by taking the length to be the distance from the surface boundary 1 to the local point of interest.

Introduction  An understanding of convection boundary layers is necessary to understanding convective heat transfer between a surface and a fluid flowing past it. A thermal boundary layer develops if the fluid free stream temperature and the surface temperatures differ. A temperature profile exists due to the energy exchange resulting from this temperature difference.  The heat transfer rate can then be written as,       Q  y   =   h  A   (    T  s   -   T  ∞    )         subscript  Q  y     h  A     subscript  T  s    subscript  T        {{Q}_{y}}=hA\left({{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{\infty}}\right)     And because heat transfer at the surface is by conduction,       Q  y   =   -     k  A   ∂   ∂  y     (   T  -   T  s    )    |    y  =  0          subscript  Q  y      evaluated-at    k  A       y      T   subscript  T  s       y  0       {{Q}_{y}}=-kA\frac{\partial}{\partial y}{{\left.\left(T-{{T}_{s}}\right)\right%
 |}_{y=0}}     These two terms are equal; thus       -     k  A   ∂   ∂  y     (   T  -   T  s    )    |    y  =  0     =   h  A   (    T  s   -   T  ∞    )           evaluated-at    k  A       y      T   subscript  T  s       y  0       h  A     subscript  T  s    subscript  T        -kA\frac{\partial}{\partial y}{{\left.\left(T-{{T}_{s}}\right)\right|}_{y=0}}=%
 hA\left({{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{\infty}}\right)     Rearranging,       h  k   =       ∂   (    T  s   -  T   )     ∂  y    |    y  =  0     (    T  s   -   T  ∞    )          h  k      evaluated-at         subscript  T  s   T      y      y  0       subscript  T  s    subscript  T        \frac{h}{k}=\frac{{{\left.\frac{\partial\left({{T}_{s}}-T\right)}{\partial y}%
 \right|}_{y=0}}}{{\left({{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{\infty}}\right)}}     Making it dimensionless by multiplying by representative length L,        h  L   k   =       ∂   (    T  s   -  T   )     ∂  y    |    y  =  0      (    T  s   -   T  ∞    )   L            h  L   k      evaluated-at         subscript  T  s   T      y      y  0         subscript  T  s    subscript  T     L      \frac{hL}{k}=\frac{{{\left.\frac{\partial\left({{T}_{s}}-T\right)}{\partial y}%
 \right|}_{y=0}}}{\frac{\left({{T}_{s}}-{{T}_{\infty}}\right)}{L}}     The right hand side is now the ratio of the temperature gradient at the surface to the reference temperature gradient. While the left hand side is similar to the Biot modulus. This becomes the ratio of conductive thermal resistance to the convective thermal resistance of the fluid, otherwise known as the Nusselt number, Nu.      Nu  =    h  L   k       Nu      h  L   k     \mathrm{Nu}=\frac{hL}{k}     Derivation  The Nusselt number may be obtained by a non dimensional analysis of the Fourier's law since it is equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface:      q  =   -   k  A   ∇  T         q      k  A   normal-∇  T       q=-kA\nabla T   , where q is the heat flux , k is the [ constant [thermal conductivity]] and T the fluid  temperature .

It is easy to solve but is less accurate when there is a large temperature difference across the fluid. It is tailored to smooth tubes, so use for rough tubes (most commercial applications) is cautioned. The Dittus-Boelter equation is:       Nu  D   =    0.023     Re  D   4  /  5      Pr  n         subscript  Nu  D     0.023   superscript   subscript  Re  D     4  5     superscript  Pr  n      \mathrm{Nu}_{D}=0.023\,\mathrm{Re}_{D}^{4/5}\,\mathrm{Pr}^{n}     where:     D   D   D   is the inside diameter of the circular duct     Pr   Pr   \mathrm{Pr}   is the Prandtl number      n  =  0.4      n  0.4    n=0.4   for heating of the fluid, and    n  =  0.3      n  0.3    n=0.3   for cooling of the fluid. 12  The Dittus-Boelter equation is valid for 13      0.6  ≤  Pr  ≤  160        0.6  Pr       160     0.6\leq\mathrm{Pr}\leq 160          Re  D   ≳  10 000     greater-than-or-equivalent-to   subscript  Re  D   10 000    \mathrm{Re}_{D}\gtrsim 10\,000          L  D   ≳  10     greater-than-or-equivalent-to    L  D   10    \frac{L}{D}\gtrsim 10     Example The Dittus-Boelter equation is a good approximation where temperature differences between bulk fluid and heat transfer surface are minimal, avoiding equation complexity and iterative solving. Taking water with a bulk fluid average temperature of 20 °C, viscosity 10.07×10 −4 Pa·s and a heat transfer surface temperature of 40 °C (viscosity 6.96×10 −4 , a viscosity correction factor for    (   μ  /   μ  s    )      μ   subscript  μ  s     ({\mu}/{\mu_{s}})   can be obtained as 1.45. This increases to 3.57 with a heat transfer surface temperature of 100 °C (viscosity 2.82×10 −4 Pa·s), making a significant difference to the Nusselt number and the heat transfer coefficient.  Sieder-Tate correlation  The Sieder-Tate correlation for turbulent flow is an implicit function , as it analyzes the system as a nonlinear boundary value problem . The Sieder-Tate result can be more accurate as it takes into account the change in viscosity (   μ   μ   \mu   and    μ  s     subscript  μ  s    \mu_{s}   ) due to temperature change between the bulk fluid average temperature and the heat transfer surface temperature, respectively. The Sieder-Tate correlation is normally solved by an iterative process, as the viscosity factor will change as the Nusselt number changes. 14       Nu  D   =    0.027     Re  D   4  /  5      Pr   1  /  3      (   μ   μ  s    )   0.14         subscript  Nu  D     0.027   superscript   subscript  Re  D     4  5     superscript  Pr    1  3     superscript    μ   subscript  μ  s    0.14      \mathrm{Nu}_{D}=0.027\,\mathrm{Re}_{D}^{4/5}\,\mathrm{Pr}^{1/3}\left(\frac{\mu%
