   Iwasawa decomposition      Iwasawa decomposition   In mathematics , the Iwasawa decomposition KAN of a semisimple Lie group generalises the way a square real matrix can be written as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix (a consequence of Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization ). It is named after Kenkichi Iwasawa , the Japanese  mathematician who developed this method. 1  Definition   G is a connected semisimple real Lie group .      𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   is the Lie algebra of G     𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the complexification of    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   .  θ is a Cartan involution of    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}          𝔤  0   =    𝔨  0   ⊕   𝔭  0         subscript  𝔤  0    direct-sum   subscript  𝔨  0    subscript  𝔭  0      \mathfrak{g}_{0}=\mathfrak{k}_{0}\oplus\mathfrak{p}_{0}   is the corresponding Cartan decomposition      𝔞  0     subscript  𝔞  0    \mathfrak{a}_{0}   is a maximal abelian subalgebra of    𝔭  0     subscript  𝔭  0    \mathfrak{p}_{0}     Σ is the set of restricted roots of    𝔞  0     subscript  𝔞  0    \mathfrak{a}_{0}   , corresponding to eigenvalues of    𝔞  0     subscript  𝔞  0    \mathfrak{a}_{0}   acting on    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   .  Σ + is a choice of positive roots of Σ      𝔫  0     subscript  𝔫  0    \mathfrak{n}_{0}   is a nilpotent Lie algebra given as the sum of the root spaces of Σ +  K , A , N , are the Lie subgroups of G generated by     𝔨  0   ,   𝔞  0       subscript  𝔨  0    subscript  𝔞  0     \mathfrak{k}_{0},\mathfrak{a}_{0}   and    𝔫  0     subscript  𝔫  0    \mathfrak{n}_{0}   .   Then the Iwasawa decomposition of    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   is       𝔤  0   =    𝔨  0   ⊕   𝔞  0   ⊕   𝔫  0         subscript  𝔤  0    direct-sum   subscript  𝔨  0    subscript  𝔞  0    subscript  𝔫  0      \mathfrak{g}_{0}=\mathfrak{k}_{0}\oplus\mathfrak{a}_{0}\oplus\mathfrak{n}_{0}   and the Iwasawa decomposition of G is      G  =   K  A  N       G    K  A  N     G=KAN     The dimension of A (or equivalently of    𝔞  0     subscript  𝔞  0    \mathfrak{a}_{0}   ) is called the real rank of G .  Iwasawa decompositions also hold for some disconnected semisimple groups G , where K becomes a (disconnected) maximal compact subgroup provided the center of G is finite.  The restricted root space decomposition is       𝔤  0   =    𝔪  0   ⊕   𝔞  0   ⊕   𝔤  λ         subscript  𝔤  0    direct-sum   subscript  𝔪  0    subscript  𝔞  0    subscript  𝔤  λ      \mathfrak{g}_{0}=\mathfrak{m}_{0}\oplus\mathfrak{a}_{0}\oplus_{\lambda\in%
 \Sigma}\mathfrak{g}_{\lambda}   where    𝔪  0     subscript  𝔪  0    \mathfrak{m}_{0}   is the centralizer of    𝔞  0     subscript  𝔞  0    \mathfrak{a}_{0}   in    𝔨  0     subscript  𝔨  0    \mathfrak{k}_{0}   and     𝔤  λ   =   {   X  ∈   𝔤  0    :    [  H  ,  X  ]   =   λ   (  H  )    X    ∀  H    ∈   𝔞  0    }        subscript  𝔤  λ    conditional-set    X   subscript  𝔤  0         H  X     λ  H  X   for-all  H          subscript  𝔞  0        \mathfrak{g}_{\lambda}=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}_{0}:[H,X]=\lambda(H)X\;\;\forall H%
 \in\mathfrak{a}_{0}\}   is the root space. The number     m  λ   =    dim    𝔤  λ         subscript  m  λ     dim   subscript  𝔤  λ      m_{\lambda}=\text{dim}\,\mathfrak{g}_{\lambda}   is called the multiplicity of   λ   λ   \lambda   .  Examples  If G =''SL n'' ( R ), then we can take K to be the orthogonal matrices, A to be the positive diagonal matrices, and N to be the unipotent group consisting of upper triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal.  Non-Archimedean Iwasawa decomposition  There is an analogon to the above Iwasawa decomposition for a non-Archimedean field    F   F   F   : In this case, the group    G   L  n    (  F  )       G   subscript  L  n   F    GL_{n}(F)   can be written as a product of the subgroup of upper-triangular matrices and the (maximal compact) subgroup    G   L  n    (   O  F   )       G   subscript  L  n    subscript  O  F     GL_{n}(O_{F})   , where    O  F     subscript  O  F    O_{F}   is the ring of integers of   F   F   F   . 2  See also   Lie group decompositions   References    A.
