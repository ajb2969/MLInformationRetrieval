Maximal ergodic theorem

The maximal ergodic theorem is a theorem in ergodic theory, a discipline within mathematics.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a probability space, that 
 
 
 
  is a (possibly noninvertible) measure-preserving transformation, and that 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
  by


 
  Then the maximal ergodic theorem states that


 
  for any λ ∈ R.
This theorem is used to prove the point-wise ergodic theorem.
