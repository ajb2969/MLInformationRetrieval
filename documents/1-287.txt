Disjunction elimination


For the theorem of propositional logic which expresses Disjunction elimination, see Case analysis.
 

In propositional logic, disjunction elimination12 (sometimes named proof by cases, case analysis, or or elimination), is the valid argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof. It is the inference that if a statement 
 
 
 
  implies a statement 
 
 
 
  and a statement 
 
 
 
  also implies 
 
 
 
 , then if either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is true, then 
 
 
 
  has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.

If I'm inside, I have my wallet on me.
 
If I'm outside, I have my wallet on me.
 
It is true that either I'm inside or I'm outside.
 
Therefore, I have my wallet on me.
 

It is the rule can be stated as:



where the rule is that whenever instances of "
 
 
 
 ", and "
 
 
 
 " and "
 
 
 
 " appear on lines of a proof, "
 
 
 
 " can be placed on a subsequent line.
Formal notation
The disjunction elimination rule may be written in sequent notation:



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in some logical system;
and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
