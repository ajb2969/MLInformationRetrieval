   Disjunction elimination      Disjunction elimination    For the theorem of propositional logic which expresses Disjunction elimination, see Case analysis .   In propositional logic , disjunction elimination 1 2 (sometimes named proof by cases , case analysis , or or elimination ), is the valid  argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof . It is the inference that if a statement   P   P   P   implies a statement   Q   Q   Q   and a statement   R   R   R   also implies   Q   Q   Q   , then if either   P   P   P   or   R   R   R   is true, then   Q   Q   Q   has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.   If I'm inside, I have my wallet on me.  If I'm outside, I have my wallet on me.  It is true that either I'm inside or I'm outside.  Therefore, I have my wallet on me.   It is the rule can be stated as:        P  →  Q   ,   R  →   Q  ,   P  R        ∴  Q        formulae-sequence   normal-→  P  Q    normal-→  R   Q    P  R       therefore  absent  Q     \frac{P\to Q,R\to Q,PR}{\therefore Q}     where the rule is that whenever instances of "    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   ", and "    R  →  Q     normal-→  R  Q    R\to Q   " and "    P  R      P  R    PR   " appear on lines of a proof, "   Q   Q   Q   " can be placed on a subsequent line.  Formal notation  The disjunction elimination rule may be written in sequent notation:       (  P  →  Q  )   ,   (  R  →  Q  )   ,   (  P  R  )   ⊢  Q     fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  R  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  P  R  normal-)   proves  Q    (P\to Q),(R\to Q),(PR)\vdash Q     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that   Q   Q   Q   is a syntactic consequence of    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   , and    R  →  Q     normal-→  R  Q    R\to Q   and    P  R      P  R    PR   in some logical system;  and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:       (   (   (  P  →  Q  )   and   (  R  →  Q  )   )   and   (  P  R  )   )   →  Q     fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(  R  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(  P  R  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→  Q    (((P\to Q)\and(R\to Q))\and(PR))\to Q     where   P   P   P   ,   Q   Q   Q   , and   R   R   R   are propositions expressed in some formal system .
