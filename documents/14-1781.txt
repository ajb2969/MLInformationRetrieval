Tautological consequence

In propositional logic, tautological consequence is a strict form of logical consequence1 in which the tautologousness of a proposition is preserved from one line of a proof to the next. Not all logical consequences are tautological consequences. A proposition

 
  is said to be a tautological consequence of one or more other propositions (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
 
 ) in a proof with respect to some logical system if one is validly able to introduce the proposition onto a line of the proof within the rules of the system and in all cases when each of those one or more other propositions (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
 ) are true, the proposition 
 
 
 
  also is true.
Another way to express this preservation of tautologousness is by using truth tables. A proposition 
 
 
 
 
  is said to be a tautological consequence of one or more other propositions (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
 ) if and only if in every row of a joint truth table that assigns "T" to all propositions (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
 ) the truth table also assigns "T" to 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Consider the following argument:


 
  = "Socrates is a man."


 
  = "All men are mortal."


 
 
  = "Socrates is mortal."



The conclusion of this argument is a logical consequence of the premise because it is impossible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.
Now construct a joint truth table.

Reviewing the truth table, it turns out the conclusion of the argument is not a tautological consequence of the premise. Not every row that assigns T to the conclusion also assigns T to every proposition in the premise. In particular, it is the second row that assigns T to "a ∧ b," but does not assign T to c.
Denotation and properties
It follows from the definition that if a proposition p is a contradiction then p tautologically implies every proposition, because there is no truth valuation that causes p to be true and so the definition of tautological implication is trivially satisfied. Similarly, if p is a tautology then p is tautologically implied by every proposition.
