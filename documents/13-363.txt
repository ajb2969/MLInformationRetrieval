   Łojasiewicz inequality      Łojasiewicz inequality   In real algebraic geometry , the ' Łojasiewicz inequality , named after Stanisław Łojasiewicz , gives an upper bound for the distance of a point to the nearest zero of a given real analytic function . Specifically, let ƒ : U → R ' be a real-analytic function on an open set  U in R n , and let Z be the zero locus of ƒ. Assume that Z is not empty. Then for any compact set  K in U , there exist positive constants α and C such that, for all x in K      dist    (  x  ,  Z  )   α   ≤  C  |  f   (  x  )   |  .     fragments  dist   superscript   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  Z  normal-)   α    C  normal-|  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-|  normal-.    \operatorname{dist}(x,Z)^{\alpha}\leq C|f(x)|.\,     Here α can be large.  The following form of this inequality is often seen in more analytic contexts: with the same assumptions on ƒ, for every p ∈ U there is a possibly smaller open neighborhood W of p and constants θ ∈ (0,1) and c > 0 such that         |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  p  )     |   θ   ≤   c   |    ∇  f    (  x  )    |     .       superscript        f  x     f  p     θ     c       normal-∇  f   x       |f(x)-f(p)|^{\theta}\leq c|\nabla f(x)|.\,     References      "  Category:Inequalities  Category:Mathematical analysis  Category:Real algebraic geometry
