Lockhart–Martinelli parameter

The Lockhart–Martinelli parameter (
 
 
 
 ) is a dimensionless number used in internal two-phase flow calculations.1 It expresses the liquid fraction of a flowing fluid. Its main application is in two-phase pressure drop and boiling/condensing heat transfer calculations.
It is defined as:



where



 is the liquid phase mass flowrate;




 is the gas phase mass flowrate;




 is the gas density;




 is the liquid density.
