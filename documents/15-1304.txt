Nodal period

The nodal period of a satellite is the time between successive passages of a satellite through successive orbital nodes.12 This applies to artificial, such as weather satellites, and natural satellites the moon. The nodal period of Earth's moon is 27.2122 days.3
Near Earth-Satellites
The oblateness of the Earth has important effects of the orbits of near Earth-satellites.4 An expression for the nodal period (
 
 
 
 ) of a near circular orbit, such that the eccentricity (Îµ) is almost but not equal to zero, is:
