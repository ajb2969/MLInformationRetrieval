The normal-inverse Gaussian distribution (NIG) is continuous probability distribution that is defined as the normal variance-mean mixture where the mixing density is the inverse Gaussian distribution. The NIG distribution was noted by Blaesild in 1977 as a subclass of the generalised hyperbolic distribution discovered by Ole Barndorff-Nielsen,2 in the next year Barndorff-Nielsen published the NIG in another paper.3 It was introduced in the mathematical finance literature in 1997.4
The parameters of the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution are often used to construct a heaviness and skewness plot called the NIG-triangle.5
Properties
Moments
The fact that there is a simple expression for the moment generating function implies that simple expressions for all moments are available.67
Linear transformation
This class is closed under affine transformations, since it is a particular case of the Generalized hyperbolic distribution, which has the same property.
Summation
This class is infinitely divisible, since it is a particular case of the Generalized hyperbolic distribution, which has the same property.
Convolution
The class of normal-inverse Gaussian distributions is closed under convolution in the following sense:8 if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are independent random variables that are NIG-distributed with the same values of the parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , but possibly different values of the location and scale parameters, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

 
 , respectively, then 
 
 
 
  is NIG-distributed with parameters 
 
 


 
 
  and 
 
 

Related Distributions
The class of NIG distributions is a flexible system of distributions that includes fat-tailed and skewed distributions, and the normal distribution, 
 
 
 
  arises as a special case by setting 
 
 
 
  and letting 
 
 
 
 .
Stochastic Process
The normal-inverse Gaussian distribution can also be seen as the marginal distribution of the normal-inverse Gaussian process which provides an alternative way of explicitly constructing it. Starting with a drifting Brownian motion (Wiener process), 
 
 
 
 
 , we can define the inverse Gaussian process 
 
 
 
  Then given a second independent drifting Brownian motion, 
 
 
 
 , the normal-inverse Gaussian process is the time-changed process 
 
 
 
 . The process 
 
 
 
  at time 1 has the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution described above. The NIG process is a particular instance of the more general class of Lévy processes.
