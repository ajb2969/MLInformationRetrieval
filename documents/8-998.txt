The NIG distribution was noted by Blaesild in 1977 as a subclass of the generalised hyperbolic distribution discovered by Ole Barndorff-Nielsen , 2 in the next year Barndorff-Nielsen published the NIG in another paper. 3 It was introduced in the mathematical finance literature in 1997. 4  The parameters of the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution are often used to construct a heaviness and skewness plot called the NIG-triangle. 5  Properties  Moments  The fact that there is a simple expression for the moment generating function implies that simple expressions for all moments are available. 6 7  Linear transformation  This class is closed under affine transformations , since it is a particular case of the Generalized hyperbolic distribution , which has the same property.  Summation  This class is infinitely divisible , since it is a particular case of the Generalized hyperbolic distribution , which has the same property.  Convolution  The class of normal-inverse Gaussian distributions is closed under convolution in the following sense: 8 if    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   and    X  2     subscript  X  2    X_{2}   are independent  random variables that are NIG-distributed with the same values of the parameters   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   , but possibly different values of the location and scale parameters,    μ  1     subscript  μ  1    \mu_{1}   ,    δ  1     subscript  δ  1    \delta_{1}   and     μ  2   ,     subscript  μ  2    \mu_{2},       δ  2     subscript  δ  2    \delta_{2}   , respectively, then     X  1   +   X  2        subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2     X_{1}+X_{2}   is NIG-distributed with parameters    α  ,    α   \alpha,       β  ,    β   \beta,        μ  1   +   μ  2        subscript  μ  1    subscript  μ  2     \mu_{1}+\mu_{2}   and      δ  1   +   δ  2    .       subscript  δ  1    subscript  δ  2     \delta_{1}+\delta_{2}.     Related Distributions  The class of NIG distributions is a flexible system of distributions that includes fat-tailed and skewed distributions, and the normal distribution ,     N   (  μ  ,   σ  2   )    ,      N   μ   superscript  σ  2      N(\mu,\sigma^{2}),   arises as a special case by setting      β  =  0   ,   δ  =    σ  2   α     ,     formulae-sequence    β  0     δ     superscript  σ  2   α      \beta=0,\delta=\sigma^{2}\alpha,   and letting    α  →  ∞     normal-→  α     \alpha\rightarrow\infty   .  Stochastic Process  The normal-inverse Gaussian distribution can also be seen as the marginal distribution of the normal-inverse Gaussian process which provides an alternative way of explicitly constructing it. Starting with a drifting Brownian motion ( Wiener process ),      W   (  γ  )     (  t  )    =    W   (  t  )    +   γ  t           superscript  W  γ   t       W  t     γ  t      W^{(\gamma)}(t)=W(t)+\gamma t   , we can define the inverse Gaussian process      A  t   =   inf   {   s  >  0   :     W   (  γ  )     (  s  )    =   δ  t    }     .       subscript  A  t    infimum   conditional-set    s  0        superscript  W  γ   s     δ  t        A_{t}=\inf\{s>0:W^{(\gamma)}(s)=\delta t\}.   Then given a second independent drifting Brownian motion,      W   (  β  )     (  t  )    =     W  ~    (  t  )    +   β  t           superscript  W  β   t        normal-~  W   t     β  t      W^{(\beta)}(t)=\tilde{W}(t)+\beta t   , the normal-inverse Gaussian process is the time-changed process     X  t   =    W   (  β  )     (   A  t   )         subscript  X  t      superscript  W  β    subscript  A  t      X_{t}=W^{(\beta)}(A_{t})   . The process    X   (  t  )       X  t    X(t)   at time 1 has the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution described above. The NIG process is a particular instance of the more general class of Lévy processes .
