   Integral sliding mode      Integral sliding mode   In 1996, V. Utkin and J. Shi proposed an improved sliding control method named integral sliding mode control (ISMC) . In contrast with conventional sliding mode control , the system motion under integral sliding mode has a dimension equal to that of the state space. In ISMC, the system trajectory always starts from the sliding surface. Accordingly, the reaching phase is eliminated and robustness in the whole state space is promised.  Control Scheme  For a system     x  ⋅   =    f   (  x  )    +   B   (  x  )   u   +   h   (  x  )          normal-⋅  x       f  x     B  x  u     h  x      \overset{\cdot}{x}=f(x)+B(x)u+h(x)   ,  an integral sliding surface can be designed as     σ   (  t  )    =     G  x   (  t  )    -   G  x   (  0  )     +    ∫  0  t     [    G  B   u  0    (  τ  )    +   G  f   (   x   (  τ  )    )     ]   d  τ           σ  t         G  x  t     G  x  0      superscript   subscript   0   t      delimited-[]      G  B   subscript  u  0   τ     G  f    x  τ      d  τ       \sigma(t)=Gx(t)-Gx(0)+\int_{0}^{t}[GBu_{0}(\tau)+Gf(x(\tau))]d\tau   so that     σ   (  0  )    =  0        σ  0   0    \sigma(0)=0   is guaranteed and the reaching mode during which the system is sensitive to noise in normal sliding mode is eliminated.
