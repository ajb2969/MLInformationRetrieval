   Wandering set      Wandering set   In those branches of mathematics called dynamical systems and ergodic theory , the concept of a wandering set formalizes a certain idea of movement and mixing in such systems. When a dynamical system has a wandering set of non-zero measure, then the system is a dissipative system . This is very much the opposite of a conservative system , for which the ideas of the Poincaré recurrence theorem apply. Intuitively, the connection between wandering sets and dissipation is easily understood: if a portion of the phase space "wanders away" during normal time-evolution of the system, and is never visited again, then the system is dissipative. The language of wandering sets can be used to give a precise, mathematical definition to the concept of a dissipative system. The notion of wandering sets in phase space was introduced by Birkhoff in 1927.  Wandering points  A common, discrete-time definition of wandering sets starts with a map    f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\to X   of a topological space  X . A point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   is said to be a wandering point if there is a neighbourhood  U of x and a positive integer N such that for all    n  >  N      n  N    n>N   , the iterated map is non-intersecting:          f  n    (  U  )    ∩  U   =  ∅   .           superscript  f  n   U   U      f^{n}(U)\cap U=\varnothing.\,     A handier definition requires only that the intersection have measure zero. To be precise, the definition requires that X be a measure space , i.e. part of a triple    (  X  ,  Σ  ,  μ  )     X  normal-Σ  μ    (X,\Sigma,\mu)   of Borel sets    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   and a measure   μ   μ   \mu   such that       μ   (     f  n    (  U  )    ∩  U   )    =   0.         μ       superscript  f  n   U   U    0.    \mu\left(f^{n}(U)\cap U\right)=0.\,     Similarly, a continuous-time system will have a map     φ  t   :   X  →  X      normal-:   subscript  φ  t    normal-→  X  X     \varphi_{t}:X\to X   defining the time evolution or flow of the system, with the time-evolution operator   φ   φ   \varphi   being a one-parameter continuous abelian group  action on X :        φ   t  +  s    =    φ  t   ∘   φ  s     .       subscript  φ    t  s       subscript  φ  t    subscript  φ  s      \varphi_{t+s}=\varphi_{t}\circ\varphi_{s}.\,     In such a case, a wandering point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   will have a neighbourhood  U of x and a time T such that for all times    t  >  T      t  T    t>T   , the time-evolved map is of measure zero:       μ   (     φ  t    (  U  )    ∩  U   )    =   0.         μ       subscript  φ  t   U   U    0.    \mu\left(\varphi_{t}(U)\cap U\right)=0.\,     These simpler definitions may be fully generalized to the group  action of a topological group . Let    Ω  =   (  X  ,  Σ  ,  μ  )       normal-Ω   X  normal-Σ  μ     \Omega=(X,\Sigma,\mu)   be a measure space , that is, a set with a measure defined on its Borel subsets . Let   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   be a group  acting on that set. Given a point    x  ∈  Ω      x  normal-Ω    x\in\Omega   , the set      {   γ  ⋅  x   :   γ  ∈  Γ   }     conditional-set   normal-⋅  γ  x     γ  normal-Γ     \{\gamma\cdot x:\gamma\in\Gamma\}     is called the trajectory or orbit of the point x .  An element    x  ∈  Ω      x  normal-Ω    x\in\Omega   is called a wandering point if there exists a neighborhood  U of x and a neighborhood  V of the identity in   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   such that       μ   (    γ  ⋅  U   ∩  U   )    =  0        μ     normal-⋅  γ  U   U    0    \mu\left(\gamma\cdot U\cap U\right)=0     for all    γ  ∈   Γ  -  V       γ    normal-Γ  V     \gamma\in\Gamma-V   .  Non-wandering points  A non-wandering point is the opposite. In the discrete case,    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   is non-wandering if, for every open set U containing x and every N > 0, there is some n > 0 such that       μ   (     f  n    (  U  )    ∩  U   )    >  0.        μ       superscript  f  n   U   U    0.    \mu\left(f^{n}(U)\cap U\right)>0.     Similar definitions follow for the continuous-time and discrete and continuous group actions.  Wandering sets and dissipative systems  A wandering set is a collection of wandering points. More precisely, a subset W of   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a wandering set under the action of a discrete group   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   if W is measurable and if, for any    γ  ∈   Γ  -   {  e  }        γ    normal-Γ   e      \gamma\in\Gamma-\{e\}   the intersection       γ  W   ∩   W         γ  W   W    \gamma W\cap W\,     is a set of measure zero.  The concept of a wandering set is in a sense dual to the ideas expressed in the Poincaré recurrence theorem . If there exists a wandering set of positive measure, then the action of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is said to be dissipative , and the dynamical system     (  Ω  ,  Γ  )     normal-Ω  normal-Γ    (\Omega,\Gamma)   is said to be a dissipative system . If there is no such wandering set, the action is said to be conservative , and the system is a conservative system . For example, any system for which the Poincaré recurrence theorem holds cannot have, by definition, a wandering set of positive measure; and is thus an example of a conservative system.  Define the trajectory of a wandering set W as        W  *   =     ∪   γ  ∈  Γ      γ  W     .       superscript  W      subscript     γ  normal-Γ      γ  W      W^{*}=\cup_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\;\;\gamma W.     The action of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is said to be completely dissipative if there exists a wandering set W of positive measure, such that the orbit    W  *     superscript  W     W^{*}   is almost-everywhere equal to   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , that is, if      Ω  -    W  *        normal-Ω   superscript  W      \Omega-W^{*}\,     is a set of measure zero.
