Popoviciu's inequality

In convex analysis, Popoviciu's inequality is an inequality about convex functions. It is similar to Jensen's inequality and was found in 1965 by Tiberiu Popoviciu,1 a Romanian mathematician. It states:

Let f be a function from an interval 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . If f is convex, then for any three points x, y, z in I,



If a function f is continuous, then it is convex if and only if the above inequality holds for all x, y, z from 
 
 
 
 . When f is strictly convex, the inequality is strict except for x = y = z.2

It can be generalised to any finite number n of points instead of 3, taken on the right-hand side k at a time instead of 2 at a time:3

Let f be a continuous function from an interval 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Then f is convex if and only if, for any integers n and k where n ≥ 3 and 
 
 
 
 , and any n points 
 
 
 
  from I,




Popoviciu's inequality can also be generalised to a weighted inequality.45
