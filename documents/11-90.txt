   Glycine—tRNA ligase      Glycine—tRNA ligase   Glycine—tRNA ligase also known as glycyl-tRNA synthetase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the GARS  gene . 1 2 3  Function  This gene encodes glycyl-tRNA synthetase, one of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. The encoded enzyme is an (alpha)2 dimer which belongs to the class II family of tRNA synthetases. 4  Reaction  In enzymology , a glycine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + glycine + tRNAGly   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + glycyl-tRNAGly   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , glycine , and tRNA(Gly) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and glycyl-tRNA(Gly) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine:tRNAGly ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include glycyl-tRNA synthetase , glycyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , glycyl-transfer RNA synthetase , glycyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , and glycyl translase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .  Interactions  Glycyl-tRNA synthetase has been shown to interact with EEF1D . 5  Clinical relevance  Glycyl-tRNA synthetase has been shown to be a target of autoantibodies in the human autoimmune diseases, polymyositis or dermatomyositis . 6  The peripheral neuropathy  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) has been liked to dominant mutations in GARS . 7 CMT2D usually manifests during the teenage years, and results in muscle weakness predominantly in the hands and feet. 8 Two mouse models of CMT2D have been used to better understand the disease, identifying that the disorder is caused by a toxic gain of function of the mutant glycine-tRNA ligase protein. 9 The CMT2D mice display peripheral nerve axon degeneration 10 11 and defective development of the neuromuscular junction . 12  See also   Glycine-tRNA ligase   References  Further reading                        External links   GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 2  GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on GARS-Associated Axonal Neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 2D, Distal Spinal Muscular Atrophy V   "  Category:EC 6.1.1  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
