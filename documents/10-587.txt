   Methylglyoxal reductase (NADPH-dependent)      Methylglyoxal reductase (NADPH-dependent)   In enzymology , a methylglyoxal reductase (NADPH-dependent) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   lactaldehyde + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methylglyoxal + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are lactaldehyde and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are methylglyoxal , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is lactaldehyde:NADP + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , and Gre2 .
