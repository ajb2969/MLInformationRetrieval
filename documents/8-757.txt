   Erdős–Kac theorem      Erdős–Kac theorem   In number theory , the Erdős–Kac theorem , named after Paul Erdős and Mark Kac , and also known as the fundamental theorem of probabilistic number theory , states that if ω( n ) is the number of distinct prime factors of n , then, loosely speaking, the probability distribution of        ω   (  n  )    -   log   log  n       log   log  n             ω  n       n           n       \frac{\omega(n)-\log\log n}{\sqrt{\log\log n}}     is the standard normal distribution . This is an extension of the Hardy–Ramanujan theorem , which states that the normal order of ω( n ) is log log n with a typical error of size     log   log  n            n      \sqrt{\log\log n}   .  Precise statement  For any fixed a \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \left ( \frac {1}{x} \cdot \#\left\{ n \leq x : a \le \frac{\omega(n) - \log \log n}{\sqrt{\log \log n}} \le b \right\} \right ) = \Phi(a,b)  where    Φ   (  a  ,  b  )       normal-Φ   a  b     \Phi(a,b)   is the normal (or "Gaussian") distribution, defined as        Φ   (  a  ,  b  )    =    1    2  π       ∫  a  b      e   -    t  2   /  2      d  t      .        normal-Φ   a  b        1      2  π       superscript   subscript   a   b      superscript  e       superscript  t  2   2     d  t       \Phi(a,b)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{a}^{b}e^{-t^{2}/2}\,dt.     More generally, if f( n ) is a strongly additive function (     f   (    p  1   a  1    ⋯   p  k   a  k     )    =    f   (   p  1   )    +  ⋯  +   f   (   p  k   )           f     superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  a  1    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  p  k    subscript  a  k          f   subscript  p  1    normal-⋯    f   subscript  p  k       \scriptstyle f(p_{1}^{a_{1}}\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}})=f(p_{1})+\cdots+f(p_{k})   ) with     |   f   (  p  )    |   ≤  1          f  p    1    \scriptstyle|f(p)|\leq 1   for all prime p , then        lim   x  →  ∞     (     1  x   ⋅  #    {   n  ≤  x   :   a  ≤     f   (  n  )    -   A   (  n  )      B   (  n  )     ≤  b   }    )    =   Φ   (  a  ,  b  )          subscript    normal-→  x        normal-⋅    1  x   normal-#    conditional-set    n  x       a        f  n     A  n      B  n         b         normal-Φ   a  b      \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x}\cdot\#\left\{n\leq x:a\leq\frac{f(n%
 )-A(n)}{B(n)}\leq b\right\}\right)=\Phi(a,b)   with         A   (  n  )    =    ∑   p  ≤  n      f   (  p  )    p     ,    B   (  n  )    =     ∑   p  ≤  n      f    (  p  )   2    p       .     formulae-sequence      A  n     subscript     p  n        f  p   p         B  n       subscript     p  n        f   superscript  p  2    p        A(n)=\sum_{p\leq n}\frac{f(p)}{p},\qquad B(n)=\sqrt{\sum_{p\leq n}\frac{f(p)^{%
 2}}{p}}.     Kac's original heuristic  Intuitively, Kac's heuristic for the result says that if n is a randomly chosen large integer, then the number of distinct prime factors of n is approximately normally distributed with mean and variance log log n . This comes from the fact that given a random natural number n , the events "the number n is divisible by some prime p " for each p are mutually independent.  Now, denoting the event "the number n is divisible by p " by    n  p     subscript  n  p    n_{p}   , consider the following sum of indicator random variables:       I   n  2    +   I   n  3    +   I   n  5    +   I   n  7    +  …       subscript  I   subscript  n  2     subscript  I   subscript  n  3     subscript  I   subscript  n  5     subscript  I   subscript  n  7    normal-…    I_{n_{2}}+I_{n_{3}}+I_{n_{5}}+I_{n_{7}}+\ldots     This sum counts how many distinct prime factors our random natural number n has. It can be shown that this sum satisfies the Lindeberg condition , and therefore the Lindeberg central limit theorem guarantees that after appropriate rescaling, the above expression will be Gaussian.  The actual proof of the theorem, due to Erdős, uses sieve theory to make rigorous the above intuition.  Numerical examples  The Erdős–Kac theorem means that the construction of a number around one billion requires on average three primes.  For example, 1,000,000,003 = 23 × 307 × 141623. The following table provides a numerical summary of the growth of the average number of distinct prime factors of a natural number   n   n   n   with increasing   n   n   n   .      n   Number of digits in n   Average number of distinct primes   Standard deviation       1,000   4   2   1.4     1,000,000,000   10   3   1.7     1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000   25   4   2     10 65   66   5   2.2     10 9,566   9,567   10   3.2     10 210,704,568   210,704,569   20   4.5     10 10 22   10 22 +1   50   7.1     10 10 44   10 44 +1   100   10     10 10 434   10 434 +1   1000   31.6     (Figure)  A spreading Gaussian distribution of distinct primes illustrating the Erdos-Kac theorem   Around 12.6% of 10,000 digit numbers are constructed from 10 distinct prime numbers and around 68% are constructed from between 7 and 13 primes.  A hollow sphere the size of the planet Earth filled with fine sand would have around 10 33 grains. A volume the size of the observable universe would have around 10 93 grains of sand. There might be room for 10 185 quantum strings in such a universe.  Numbers of this magnitude—with 186 digits—would require on average only 6 primes for construction.  It is very difficult if not impossible to discover this result empirically, as the Gaussian only shows up when   n   n   n   starts getting to be around    10  100     superscript  10  100    10^{100}   . More precisely, Renyi and Turan showed that the best possible uniform asymptotic bound on the error in the approximation to a Gaussian is    O   (   1    log   (   log   (  n  )    )      )       O    1        n        O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log(\log(n))}}\right)   .
