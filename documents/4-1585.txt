Cotton tensor

In differential geometry, the Cotton tensor on a (pseudo)-Riemannian manifold of dimension n is a third-order tensor concomitant of the metric, like the Weyl tensor. The vanishing of the Cotton tensor for n=3 is necessary and sufficient condition for the manifold to be conformally flat, as with the Weyl tensor for n≥4. For nij and the scalar curvature by R, the components of the Cotton tensor are



The Cotton tensor can be regarded as a vector valued 2-form, and for n = 3 one can use the Hodge star operator to convert this into a second order trace free tensor density



sometimes called the Cotton–York tensor.

Conformal rescaling
Under conformal rescaling of the metric

 . We see that the Christoffel symbols transform as

The Riemann curvature tensor transforms as



In 
 
 
 
 
 -dimensional manifolds, we obtain the Ricci tensor by contracting the transformed Riemann tensor to see it transform as



Similarly the Ricci scalar transforms as



Combining all these facts together permits us to conclude the Cotton-York tensor transforms as



or using coordinate independent language as



where the gradient is plugged into the symmetric part of the Weyl tensor W.
Symmetries
The Cotton tensor has the following symmetries:



and therefore



In addition the Bianchi formula for the Weyl tensor can be rewritten as



where 
 
 
 
  is the positive divergence in the first component of W.
