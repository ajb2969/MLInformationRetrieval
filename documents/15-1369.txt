   Kellogg's theorem      Kellogg's theorem   Kellogg's theorem is a pair of related results in the mathematical study of the regularity of harmonic functions on sufficiently smooth domains by Oliver Dimon Kellogg .  In the first version, it states that, for    k  ≥  2      k  2    k\geq 2   , if the domain's boundary is of class    C  k     superscript  C  k    C^{k}   and the k -th derivatives of the boundary are Dini continuous , then the harmonic functions are uniformly    C  k     superscript  C  k    C^{k}   as well. The second, more common version of the theorem states that for domains which are    C   k  ,  α      superscript  C   k  α     C^{k,\alpha}   , if the boundary data is of class    C   k  ,  α      superscript  C   k  α     C^{k,\alpha}   , then so is the harmonic function itself.  Kellogg's method of proof analyzes the representation of harmonic functions provided by the Poisson kernel , applied to an interior tangent sphere.  In modern presentations, Kellogg's theorem is usually covered as a specific case of the boundary Schauder estimates for elliptic  partial differential equations .
