   Frobenius determinant theorem      Frobenius determinant theorem   In mathematics, the Frobenius determinant theorem is a discovery made in 1896 by the mathematician Richard Dedekind , who wrote a letter to F. G. Frobenius about it (reproduced in , with an English translation in ).  If one takes the multiplication table of a group  G and replaces each entry g with the variable x g , and subsequently takes the determinant , then the determinant factors as a product of n irreducible polynomials, where n is the number of conjugacy classes. Moreover, each polynomial is raised to a power equal to its degree. Frobenius proved this surprising fact, and this theorem became known as the Frobenius determinant theorem.  Formal statement  Let a finite group    G   G   G   have elements     g  1   ,   g  2   ,  …  ,   g  n       subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2   normal-…   subscript  g  n     g_{1},g_{2},\dots,g_{n}   , and let    x   g  i      subscript  x   subscript  g  i     x_{g_{i}}   be associated with each element of   G   G   G   . Define the matrix    X  G     subscript  X  G    X_{G}   with entries     a   i  j    =   x    g  i    g  j          subscript  a    i  j     subscript  x     subscript  g  i    subscript  g  j       a_{ij}=x_{g_{i}g_{j}}   . Then       det   X  G    =    ∏   j  =  1   r     P  j     (   x   g  1    ,   x   g  2    ,  …  ,   x   g  n    )    deg   P  j              subscript  X  G      superscript   subscript  product    j  1    r      subscript  P  j    superscript    subscript  x   subscript  g  1     subscript  x   subscript  g  2    normal-…   subscript  x   subscript  g  n      degree   subscript  P  j         \det X_{G}=\prod_{j=1}^{r}P_{j}(x_{g_{1}},x_{g_{2}},\dots,x_{g_{n}})^{\deg P_{%
 j}}     where r is the number of conjugacy classes of G .  References    Review   Etingof, Pavel. Lectures on Representation Theory .    "  Category:Theorems in algebra  Category:Determinants  Category:Group theory  Category:Matrix theory
