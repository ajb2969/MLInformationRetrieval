Frobenius determinant theorem

In mathematics, the Frobenius determinant theorem is a discovery made in 1896 by the mathematician Richard Dedekind, who wrote a letter to F. G. Frobenius about it (reproduced in , with an English translation in ).
If one takes the multiplication table of a group G and replaces each entry g with the variable xg, and subsequently takes the determinant, then the determinant factors as a product of n irreducible polynomials, where n is the number of conjugacy classes. Moreover, each polynomial is raised to a power equal to its degree. Frobenius proved this surprising fact, and this theorem became known as the Frobenius determinant theorem.
