   Kummer–Vandiver conjecture      Kummer–Vandiver conjecture   In mathematics , the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture , or Vandiver conjecture , states that a prime p does not divide the class number  h K of the maximal real subfield     K  =   ℚ    (   ζ  p   )   +        K    ℚ   superscript   subscript  ζ  p        K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p})^{+}   of the p -th cyclotomic field . The conjecture was first made by Ernst Kummer in 1849 December 28 and 1853 April 24 in letters to Leopold Kronecker , reprinted in , and independently rediscovered around 1920 by Philipp Furtwängler and ,  As of 2011, there is no particularly strong evidence either for or against the conjecture and it is unclear whether it is true or false, though it is likely that counterexamples are very rare.  Background  The class number h of the cyclotomic field    ℚ   (   ζ  p   )       ℚ   subscript  ζ  p     \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p})   is a product of two integers h 1 and h 2 , called the first and second factors of the class number, where h 2 is the class number of the maximal real subfield     K  =   ℚ    (   ζ  p   )   +        K    ℚ   superscript   subscript  ζ  p        K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p})^{+}   of the p -th cyclotomic field . The first factor h 1 is well understood and can be written explicitly in terms of Bernoulli numbers, and is usually rather large. The second factor h 2 is not well understood and seems hard to compute explicitly.  Kummer showed that if a prime p does not divide the class number h , then Fermat's last theorem holds for exponent p .  Kummer also showed that if p divides the second factor, then it also divides the first factor. In particular the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture holds for regular primes.  Evidence for and against the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture  Kummer verified the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture for p less than 200, and Vandiver extended this to p less than 600.  verified it for p 100 primes, suggesting that it is unlikely any counterexample will be found by further brute force searches even if there are an infinite number of exceptions.  gave conjectural calculations of the class numbers of real cyclotomic fields for primes up to 10000, which strongly suggest that the class numbers are not randomly distributed mod p . They tend to be quite small and are often just 1. For example, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis , the class number of the real cyclotomic field for the prime p is 1 for p n ( Z ) = 0 whenever n is a multiple of 4. In fact from the Kummer–Vandiver conjecture and the norm residue isomorphism theorem follow a full conjectural calculation of the K -groups for all values of n ; see Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for details.
