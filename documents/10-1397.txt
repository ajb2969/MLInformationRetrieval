   L-ascorbate—cytochrome-b5 reductase      L-ascorbate—cytochrome-b5 reductase   In enzymology , a L-ascorbate—cytochrome-b5 reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-ascorbate + ferricytochrome b 5    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   monodehydroascorbate + ferrocytochrome b 5 + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-ascorbate and ferricytochrome b5 , whereas its 3 products are monodehydroascorbate , ferrocytochrome b5 , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on diphenols and related substances as donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-ascorbate:ferricytochrome-b5 oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called ascorbate-cytochrome b5 reductase .
