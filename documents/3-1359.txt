The codimension of a submanifold is the dimension of the ambient space minus the dimension of the submanifold.  Connected sum  Connection  Cotangent bundle , the vector bundle of cotangent spaces on a manifold.  Cotangent space  D  Diffeomorphism . Given two differentiable manifolds  M and N , a bijective map    f   f   f   from M to N is called a diffeomorphism if both    f  :   M  →  N      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  N     f:M\to N   and its inverse     f   -  1    :   N  →  M      normal-:   superscript  f    1     normal-→  N  M     f^{-1}:N\to M   are smooth functions .  Doubling, given a manifold M with boundary, doubling is taking two copies of M and identifying their boundaries. As the result we get a manifold without boundary.  E  Embedding  F  Fiber . In a fiber bundle, π: E → B the preimage π −1 ( x ) of a point x in the base B is called the fiber over x , often denoted E x .  Fiber bundle  Frame . A frame at a point of a differentiable manifold  M is a basis of the tangent space at the point.  Frame bundle , the principal bundle of frames on a smooth manifold.  Flow  G  Genus  H  Hypersurface . A hypersurface is a submanifold of codimension one.  I  Immersion  L  Lens space . A lens space is a quotient of the 3-sphere (or (2 n + 1)-sphere) by a free isometric action of Z k .  M  Manifold . A topological manifold is a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space . (In Wikipedia, a manifold need not be paracompact or second-countable .) A C k manifold is a differentiable manifold whose chart overlap functions are k times continuously differentiable. A C ∞ or smooth manifold is a differentiable manifold whose chart overlap functions are infinitely continuously differentiable.  N  Neat submanifold . A submanifold whose boundary equals its intersection with the boundary of the manifold into which it is embedded.  P  Parallelizable . A smooth manifold is parallelizable if it admits a smooth global frame . This is equivalent to the tangent bundle being trivial.  Principal bundle . A principal bundle is a fiber bundle P → B together with an action on P by a Lie group  G that preserves the fibers of P and acts simply transitively on those fibers.  Pullback  S  Section  Submanifold , the image of a smooth embedding of a manifold.  Submersion  Surface , a two-dimensional manifold or submanifold.  Systole , least length of a noncontractible loop.  T  Tangent bundle , the vector bundle of tangent spaces on a differentiable manifold.  Tangent field , a section of the tangent bundle. Also called a vector field .  Tangent space  Torus  Transversality . Two submanifolds M and N intersect transversally if at each point of intersection p their tangent spaces     T  p    (  M  )        subscript  T  p   M    T_{p}(M)   and     T  p    (  N  )        subscript  T  p   N    T_{p}(N)   generate the whole tangent space at p of the total manifold.  Trivialization  V  Vector bundle , a fiber bundle whose fibers are vector spaces and whose transition functions are linear maps.  Vector field , a section of a vector bundle. More specifically, a vector field can mean a section of the tangent bundle.  W  Whitney sum . A Whitney sum is an analog of the direct product for vector bundles. Given two vector bundles α and β over the same base B their cartesian product is a vector bundle over B × B . The diagonal map    B  →   B  ×  B      normal-→  B    B  B     B\to B\times B   induces a vector bundle over B called the Whitney sum of these vector bundles and denoted by α⊕β.  "  Geometry
