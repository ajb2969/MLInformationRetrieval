   Cobweb plot      Cobweb plot   A cobweb plot , or Verhulst diagram is a visual tool used in the dynamical systems field of mathematics to investigate the qualitative behaviour of one-dimensional iterated functions , such as the logistic map . Using a cobweb plot, it is possible to infer the long term status of an initial condition under repeated application of a map. 1  Method  For a given iterated function f : R → R , the plot consists of a diagonal (x = y) line and a curve representing y = f(x). To plot the behaviour of a value    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   , apply the following steps.   Find the point on the function curve with an x-coordinate of    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   . This has the coordinates (     x  0   ,   f   (   x  0   )        subscript  x  0     f   subscript  x  0      x_{0},f(x_{0})   ).  Plot horizontally across from this point to the diagonal line. This has the coordinates (     f   (   x  0   )    ,   f   (   x  0   )         f   subscript  x  0      f   subscript  x  0      f(x_{0}),f(x_{0})   ).  Plot vertically from the point on the diagonal to the function curve. This has the coordinates (     f   (   x  0   )    ,   f   (   f   (   x  0   )    )         f   subscript  x  0      f    f   subscript  x  0       f(x_{0}),f(f(x_{0}))   ).  Repeat from step 2 as required.   Interpretation  On the cobweb plot, a stable fixed point corresponds to an inward spiral, while an unstable fixed point is an outward one. It follows from the definition of a fixed point that these spirals will center at a point where the diagonal y=x line crosses the function graph. A period 2 orbit is represented by a rectangle, while greater period cycles produce further, more complex closed loops. A chaotic orbit would show a 'filled out' area, indicating an infinite number of non-repeating values. 2  See also   Jones diagram – similar plotting technique   References  "  Category:Plots (graphics)  Category:Dynamical systems     ↩  ↩
