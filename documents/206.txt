   Germacrene-A synthase      Germacrene-A synthase   In enzymology , a germacrene-A synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)-(R)-gemacrene A + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate , and two products , (+)-(R)-gemacrene A and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(+)-(R)-germacrene-A-forming] . Other names in common use include germacrene A synthase , (+)-germacrene A synthase , (+)-(10R)-germacrene A synthase , GAS , 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase , and (germacrene-A-forming) .
