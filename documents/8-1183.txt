   Langer correction      Langer correction   The Langer correction is a correction when WKB approximation method is applied to three-dimensional problems with spherical symmetry.  When applying WKB approximation method to the radial Schrödinger equation        -     ℏ  2    2  m       d  2   R   (  r  )     d   r  2       +    [   E  -    V  eff    (  r  )     ]   R   (  r  )     =  0               superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m         superscript  d  2   R  r     d   superscript  r  2          delimited-[]    E     subscript  V  eff   r     R  r    0    -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{d^{2}R(r)}{dr^{2}}+[E-V_{\textrm{eff}}(r)]R(r)=0   where the effective potential is given by        V  eff    (  r  )    =    V   (  r  )    -    ℓ   (   ℓ  +  1   )    ℏ  2     2  m   r  2             subscript  V  eff   r       V  r       normal-ℓ    normal-ℓ  1    superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2      2  m   superscript  r  2        V_{\textrm{eff}}(r)=V(r)-\frac{\ell(\ell+1)\hbar^{2}}{2mr^{2}}   the eigenenergies and the wave function behaviour obtained are different from real solution.  In 1937, Rudolph E. Langer suggested a correction       ℓ   (   ℓ  +  1   )    →    (   ℓ  +   1  2    )   2      normal-→    normal-ℓ    normal-ℓ  1     superscript    normal-ℓ    1  2    2     \ell(\ell+1)\rightarrow\left(\ell+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}   which is known as Langer correction. This is equivalent to inserting a 1/4 constant factor whenever ℓ(ℓ + 1) appears. Heuristically, it is said that this factor arises because the range of the radial Schrödinger equation is restricted from 0 to infinity, as opposed to the entire real line.  By such a changing of constant term in the effective potential, the results obtained by WKB approximation reproduces the exact spectrum for many potentials.  References   The original publication.
