   Respiratory physiology      Respiratory physiology    Respiratory physiology is the branch of human physiology focusing upon respiration .  Topics include:  Volumes   lung volumes  vital capacity  functional residual capacity  dead space  spirometry  body plethysmography  peak flow meter   Mechanics  (Figure)  Front view of thorax.   Inhalation (breathing in) is usually an active movement. The contraction of the diaphragm muscles causes the thoracic cavity to increase in volume, thus decreasing the pressures within the lung (Intrapleural and Alveolar Pressures). This negative pressure within the lungs acts as a Pressure Gradient, thus pulling air into the lungs. As air fills the lungs, the negative alveolar pressure moves back towards atmospheric pressure, and air flow into the lungs slows down. In contrast, expiration (breathing out) is usually a passive process.        P      =    P   e  l    +   P   r  e    +   P   i  n          P      =    E  V   +   R   V  ˙    +   I   V  ¨            P    absent     subscript  P    e  l     subscript  P    r  e     subscript  P    i  n        P    absent      E  V     R   normal-˙  V      I   normal-¨  V         \begin{aligned}\displaystyle P&\displaystyle=P_{el}+P_{re}+P_{in}\\
 \displaystyle P&\displaystyle=EV+R\dot{V}+I\ddot{V}\end{aligned}     Where P el equals the product of elastance E (inverse of compliance ) and volume of the system V, P re equals the product of flow resistance R and time derivate of volume V (which is equivalent to the flow), P in equals the product of inertance I and second time derivate of V. R and I are sometimes referred to as Rohrer's constants.
