   Bulgarian solitaire      Bulgarian solitaire   In mathematics and game theory , Bulgarian solitaire is a card game that was introduced by Martin Gardner .  In the game, a pack of   N   N   N   cards is divided into several piles. Then for each pile, remove one card; collect the removed cards together to form a new pile (piles of zero size are ignored).  If   N   N   N   is a triangular number (that is,    N  =   1  +  2  +  ⋯  +  k       N    1  2  normal-⋯  k     N=1+2+\cdots+k   for some   k   k   k   ), then it is known that Bulgarian solitaire will reach a stable configuration in which the sizes of the piles are    1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  k     1  2  normal-…  k    1,2,\ldots,k   . This state is reached in     k  2   -  k       superscript  k  2   k    k^{2}-k   moves or fewer. If   N   N   N   is not triangular, no stable configuration exists and a limit cycle is reached.  Random Bulgarian solitaire  In random Bulgarian solitaire or stochastic Bulgarian solitaire a pack of   N   N   N   cards is divided into several piles. Then for each pile, either leave it intact or, with a fixed probability    p   p   p   , remove one card; collect the removed cards together to form a new pile (piles of zero size are ignored). This is a finite irreducible Markov chain .  In 2004, Brazilian  probabilist of Russian origin Serguei Popov showed that stochastic Bulgarian solitaire spends "most" of its time in a "roughly" triangular distribution .
