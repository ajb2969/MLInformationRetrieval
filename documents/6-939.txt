Bulgarian solitaire

In mathematics and game theory, Bulgarian solitaire is a card game that was introduced by Martin Gardner.
In the game, a pack of 
 
 
 
  cards is divided into several piles. Then for each pile, remove one card; collect the removed cards together to form a new pile (piles of zero size are ignored).
If 
 
 
 
  is a triangular number (that is, 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 
 ), then it is known that Bulgarian solitaire will reach a stable configuration in which the sizes of the piles are 
 
 
 
 . This state is reached in 
 
 
 
  moves or fewer. If 
 
 
 
  is not triangular, no stable configuration exists and a limit cycle is reached.
Random Bulgarian solitaire
In random Bulgarian solitaire or stochastic Bulgarian solitaire a pack of 
 
 
 
  cards is divided into several piles. Then for each pile, either leave it intact or, with a fixed probability

 
 
 , remove one card; collect the removed cards together to form a new pile (piles of zero size are ignored). This is a finite irreducible Markov chain.
In 2004, Brazilian probabilist of Russian origin Serguei Popov showed that stochastic Bulgarian solitaire spends "most" of its time in a "roughly" triangular distribution.
