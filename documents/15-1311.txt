   TRNA (guanine26-N2/guanine27-N2)-dimethyltransferase      TRNA (guanine26-N2/guanine27-N2)-dimethyltransferase   TRNA (guanine 26 -N 2 /guanine 27 -N 2 )-dimethyltransferase (, Trm1 , tRNA (N 2 ,N 2 -guanine)-dimethyltransferase , tRNA (m2(2G26) methyltransferase , Trm1[tRNA (m2(2)G26) methyltransferase] ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine 26 -N 2 /guanine 27 -N 2 )-dimethyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   4 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 26 /guanine 27 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 -dimethylguanine 26 /N 2 -dimethylguanine 27 in tRNA   The enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus is similar to the TRM1 methyltransferases of archaea and eukarya .
