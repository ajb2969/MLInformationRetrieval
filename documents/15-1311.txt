TRNA (guanine26-N2/guanine27-N2)-dimethyltransferase

TRNA (guanine26-N2/guanine27-N2)-dimethyltransferase (, Trm1, tRNA (N2,N2-guanine)-dimethyltransferase, tRNA (m2(2G26) methyltransferase, Trm1[tRNA (m2(2)G26) methyltransferase]) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine26-N2/guanine27-N2)-dimethyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine26/guanine27 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  4 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-dimethylguanine26/N2-dimethylguanine27 in tRNA
 

The enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus is similar to the TRM1 methyltransferases of archaea and eukarya.
