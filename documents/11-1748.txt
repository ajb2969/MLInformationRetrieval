   Sl2-triple      Sl2-triple   In the theory of Lie algebras , an ''' sl 2 -triple''' is a triple of elements of a Lie algebra that satisfy the commutation relations between the standard generators of the special linear Lie algebra sl 2 . This notion plays an important role in the theory of semisimple Lie algebras , especially in regards to their nilpotent orbits .  Definition  Elements { e , h , f } of a Lie algebra g form an ''' sl 2 -triple''' if         [  h  ,  e  ]   =   2  e    ,     [  h  ,  f  ]   =   -   2  f     ,    [  e  ,  f  ]   =  h     .     formulae-sequence     h  e     2  e     formulae-sequence     h  f       2  f        e  f   h      [h,e]=2e,\quad[h,f]=-2f,\quad[e,f]=h.     These commutation relations are satisfied by the generators       h  =   [     1    0      0     -  1      ]    ,    e  =   [     0    1      0    0     ]    ,   f  =   [     0    0      1    0     ]        formulae-sequence    h    1  0    0    1       formulae-sequence    e    0  1    0  0       f    0  0    1  0        h=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 0&-1\end{bmatrix},\quad e=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{bmatrix},\quad f=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\
 1&0\end{bmatrix}     of the Lie algebra sl 2 of 2 by 2 matrices with zero trace . It follows that sl 2 -triples in g are in a bijective correspondence with the Lie algebra homomorphisms from sl 2 into g .  The alternative notation for the elements of an sl 2 -triple is { H , X , Y }, with H corresponding to h , X corresponding to e , and Y corresponding to f .  Properties  Assume that g is a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero . From the representation theory of the Lie algebra sl 2 , one concludes that the Lie algebra g decomposes into a direct sum of finite-dimensional subspaces, each of which is isomorphic to V j , the j + 1-dimensional simple sl 2 -module with highest weight  j . The element h of the sl 2 -triple is semisimple, with the simple eigenvalues  j , j − 2, …, − j on a submodule of g isomorphic to V j . The elements e and f move between different eigenspaces of h , increasing the eigenvalue by 2 in case of e and decreasing it by 2 in case of f . In particular, e and f are nilpotent elements of the Lie algebra g .  Conversely, the Jacobson–Morozov theorem states that any nilpotent element e of a semisimple Lie algebra  g can be included into an sl 2 -triple { e , h , f }, and all such triples are conjugate under the action of the group Z G ( e ), the centralizer of e in the adjoint Lie group G corresponding to the Lie algebra g .  The semisimple element h of any sl 2 -triple containing a given nilpotent element e of g is called a characteristic of e .  An sl 2 -triple defines a grading on g according to the eigenvalues of h :        g  =    ⊕   j  ∈  ℤ     g  j     ,     [  h  ,  a  ]   =    j  a   for     a  ∈   g  j      .     formulae-sequence    g    subscript  direct-sum    j  ℤ     subscript  g  j      formulae-sequence     h  a      j  a   for      a   subscript  g  j       g=\bigoplus_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}g_{j},\quad[h,a]=ja{\ \ }\textrm{ for }{\ \ }a\in g%
 _{j}.     The sl 2 -triple is called even if only even j occur in this decomposition, and odd otherwise.  If g is a semisimple Lie algebra, then g 0 is a reductive Lie subalgebra of g (it is not semisimple in general). Moreover, the direct sum of the eigenspaces of h with non-negative eigenvalues is a parabolic subalgebra of g with the Levi component g 0 .  If the elements of an sl 2 -triple are regular , then their span is called a principal subalgebra .
