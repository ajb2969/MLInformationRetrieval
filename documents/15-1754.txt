   The Kjartansson constant Q model      The Kjartansson constant Q model   The Kjartansson constant Q model uses Mathematical Q models to explain how the earth responds to seismic waves and is widely used in seismic geophysical applications. Because these models satisfies the Krämers-Krönig relations they should be preferable to the Kolsky model in seismic inverse Q filtering . Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of Azimi Q models  1 (1968).  Kjartansson constant Q model  Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of Azimi Q models . 2 Azimi proposed his first model together with 3 Strick (1967) and has the attenuation proportional to |w| 1-γ| and is:       α   (  w  )    =     a  1     |  w  |    1  -  γ      (  1.1  )          α  w       subscript  a  1    superscript    w     1  γ     1.1     \alpha(w)=a_{1}|w|^{1-\gamma}\quad(1.1)     The phase velocity is written:       1   c   (  w  )     =     1   c  ∞    +    a  1     |  w  |    -  γ    c  o  t   (    π  γ   2   )      (  1.2  )          1    c  w         1   subscript  c        subscript  a  1    superscript    w     γ    c  o  t      π  γ   2     1.2     \frac{1}{c(w)}=\frac{1}{c_{\infty}}+a_{1}|w|^{-\gamma}cot(\frac{\pi\gamma}{2})%
 \quad(1.2)     If the phase velocity goes to infinity in the first term on the right, we simply has:       1   c   (  w  )     =     a  1     |  w  |    -  γ    c  o  t   (    π  γ   2   )     (  1.2  )          1    c  w        subscript  a  1    superscript    w     γ    c  o  t      π  γ   2    1.2     \frac{1}{c(w)}=a_{1}|w|^{-\gamma}cot(\frac{\pi\gamma}{2})\quad(1.2)     This is Kjartansson constant Q model.  Computations  Studying the attenuation coefficient and phase velocity, and compare them with Kolskys Q model we have plotted the result on fig.1. The data for the models are taken from Ursin and Toverud. 4  Data for the Kolsky model (blue):  c r =2000 m/s, Q r =100, w r =2π100  Data for Kjartansson constant Q model (green):  a 1 =2.5 x 10 −6 , γ=0.0031  File:Kjartan.png|Fig.1.Kjartansson constant Q model and the Kolsky model  Notes  References     "  Category:Seismology measurement  Category:Geophysics     Azimi S.A.Kalinin A.V.
