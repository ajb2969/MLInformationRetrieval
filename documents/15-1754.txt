The Kjartansson constant Q model

The Kjartansson constant Q model uses Mathematical Q models to explain how the earth responds to seismic waves and is widely used in seismic geophysical applications. Because these models satisfies the Krämers-Krönig relations they should be preferable to the Kolsky model in seismic inverse Q filtering. Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of Azimi Q models 1 (1968).
Kjartansson constant Q model
Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of Azimi Q models.2 Azimi proposed his first model together with 3 Strick (1967) and has the attenuation proportional to |w|1-γ| and is:



The phase velocity is written:



If the phase velocity goes to infinity in the first term on the right, we simply has:



This is Kjartansson constant Q model.
Computations
Studying the attenuation coefficient and phase velocity, and compare them with Kolskys Q model we have plotted the result on fig.1. The data for the models are taken from Ursin and Toverud.4
Data for the Kolsky model (blue):
cr=2000 m/s, Qr=100, wr=2π100
Data for Kjartansson constant Q model (green):
a1=2.5 x 10 −6, γ=0.0031
