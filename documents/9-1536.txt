Radical of a Lie algebra

In the mathematical field of Lie theory, the radical of a Lie algebra

 
  is the largest solvable ideal of

Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a field and let 
 
 
 
 
  be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over 
 
 
 
 . A maximal solvable ideal, which is called the radical, exists for the following reason.
Firstly let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two solvable ideals of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
  is again an ideal of 
 
 
 
 , and it is solvable because it is an extension of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Therefore we may also define the radical of 
 
 
 
  as the sum of all the solvable ideals of 
 
 
 
 
 , hence the radical of 
 
 
 
  is unique. Secondly, as 
 
 
 
  is always a solvable ideal of 
 
 
 
 , the radical of 
 
 
 
  always exists.
