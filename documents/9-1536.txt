   Radical of a Lie algebra      Radical of a Lie algebra   In the mathematical field of Lie theory , the radical of a Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the largest solvable  ideal of    𝔤  .    𝔤   \mathfrak{g}.    1  Definition  Let   k   k   k   be a field and let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over   k   k   k   . A maximal solvable ideal, which is called the radical, exists for the following reason.  Firstly let   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   and   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   be two solvable ideals of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Then    𝔞  +  𝔟      𝔞  𝔟    \mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b}   is again an ideal of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , and it is solvable because it is an extension of      (   𝔞  +  𝔟   )   /  𝔞   ≃   𝔟  /   (   𝔞  ∩  𝔟   )       similar-to-or-equals      𝔞  𝔟   𝔞     𝔟    𝔞  𝔟      (\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})/\mathfrak{a}\simeq\mathfrak{b}/(\mathfrak{a}\cap%
 \mathfrak{b})   by   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   . Therefore we may also define the radical of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   as the sum of all the solvable ideals of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , hence the radical of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is unique. Secondly, as    {  0  }     0    \{0\}   is always a solvable ideal of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , the radical of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   always exists.  Related concepts   A Lie algebra is semisimple if and only if its radical is   0   0    .  A Lie algebra is reductive if and only if its radical equals its center.
