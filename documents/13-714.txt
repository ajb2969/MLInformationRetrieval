   Restricted isometry property      Restricted isometry property  In [[linear algebra]], the '''restricted isometry property''' characterizes [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] which are nearly orthonormal, at least when operating on [[sparse]] vectors. The concept was introduced by [[Emmanuel Candès]] and [[Terence Tao]] E. J. Candes and T. Tao, "Decoding by Linear Programming," IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 51(12): 4203–4215 (2005). and is used to prove many theorems in the field of [[compressed sensing]]. E. J. Candes, J. K. Romberg, and T. Tao, "Stable Signal Recovery from Incomplete and Inaccurate Measurements," Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, Vol. LIX, 1207–1223 (2006). There are no known large matrices with bounded restricted isometry constants (and computing these constants is [[strongly NP-hard]] A. M. Tillmann and M. E. Pfetsch, " The Computational Complexity of the Restricted Isometry Property, the Nullspace Property, and Related Concepts in Compressed Sensing ," IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 60(2): 1248–1259 (2014)), but many random matrices have been shown to remain bounded. In particular, it has been shown that with exponentially high probability, random Gaussian, Bernoulli, and partial Fourier matrices satisfy the RIP with number of measurements nearly linear in the sparsity level. 1 The current smallest upper bounds for any large rectangular matrices are for those of Gaussian matrices. 2 Web forms to evaluate bounds for the Gaussian ensemble are available at the Edinburgh Compressed Sensing RIC page. 3  Definition  Let A be an m × p matrix and let 1 ≤ s ≤ p be an integer.

Eigenvalues  For any matrix that satisfies the RIP property with a RIC of    δ  k     subscript  δ  k    \delta_{k}   , the following condition holds: 4       1  -   δ  K    ≤    λ   m  i  n     (    A  τ  *    A  τ    )    ≤    λ   m  a  x     (    A  τ  *    A  τ    )    ≤   1  +   δ  k            1   subscript  δ  K       subscript  λ    m  i  n       superscript   subscript  A  τ      subscript  A  τ             subscript  λ    m  a  x       superscript   subscript  A  τ      subscript  A  τ            1   subscript  δ  k       1-\delta_{K}\leq\lambda_{min}(A_{\tau}^{*}A_{\tau})\leq\lambda_{max}(A_{\tau}^%
