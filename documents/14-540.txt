   Truck lane restriction      Truck lane restriction   In traffic flow theory, the impact of freeway  truck lane restrictions is an interesting topic. Intuitively, slow vehicles (e.g. trucks ) will cause queues behind them, but how it relates to the kinematic wave theory was not revealed until Newell. 1 Leclercq et al  2 did a complete review of Newell's theory. In addition to the simulation models developed by Laval and Daganzo 3 on the basis of numerical solution methods for Newell's theory to capture the impacts of slow vehicle, Laval 4 also mathematically derived the analytical capacity formulas for bottlenecks caused by single-type of trucks for multi-lane freeway segments.  Analytical Solution of the Single-type Truck Problem  Laval's solution could be summarized as follows: Assuming a one-lane freeway segment obeying the triangular fundamental diagram defined in the figure to the right with free-flow speed u , wave velocity  w and jam density k j . Only one truck type is considered. In this scenario, the normalized capacity I of the freeway segment is given as：      I  =   1   r  H  C        I    1    r  H  C      I=\frac{1}{rHC}     where r is the time-mean proportion of trucks in the traffic stream, C = uwnk j /(w+u) is the capacity of the freeway lane without trucks and H is the expected value of headway between two consecutive trucks at the location where trucks begin to slow down  It can be shown that, by approximating truck arrivals with Poisson processes , the probability density function (PDF) of H is the equation below, in which τ is defined as the clearance time of the queue induced by the slow-moving truck, λ 0 = rC , λ 1 = rU and τ = L ( w + v )/ wv . Note that λ 0 and λ 1 refer to the mean truck arrival rate at traffic state C or U , respectively. In particular, traffic state D, which corresponds to the downstream of the moving bottleneck, is assumed to be equal to the capacity of the unblocked lanes.        f  H    (  h  )    =   {        λ  1    e   -   h   λ  1       ,      h  ≤  τ          e   τ   (    λ  0   -   λ  1    )      λ  0    e   -   h   λ  0       ,      h  >  τ              subscript  f  H   h    cases     subscript  λ  1    superscript  e      h   subscript  λ  1         h  τ      superscript  e    τ     subscript  λ  0    subscript  λ  1       subscript  λ  0    superscript  e      h   subscript  λ  0         h  τ      f_{H}(h)=\begin{cases}\lambda_{1}e^{-h\lambda_{1}},&h\leq\tau\\
 e^{\tau(\lambda_{0}-\lambda_{1})}\lambda_{0}e^{-h\lambda_{0}},&h>\tau\end{cases}     According to Newell's moving bottleneck theory, we have:      U  =   D  +   (    w  v  k  j    w  +  v    )        U    D      w  v  k  j     w  v       U=D+(\frac{wvkj}{w+v})     Given all the above information, we can conclude that the average truck headway H is H=(1-e -λ 1 τ )/(λ 1 )+(e -λ 1 τ )/(λ 0 )  And the above equation gives us all the necessary information to solve the normalized capacity I .
