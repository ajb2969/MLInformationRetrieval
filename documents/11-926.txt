Glycoprotein N-palmitoyltransferase




Glycoprotein N-palmitoyltransferase

In enzymology, a glycoprotein N-palmitoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

palmitoyl-CoA + glycoprotein 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-palmitoylglycoprotein
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitoyl-CoA and glycoprotein, whereas its two products are CoA and N-palmitoylglycoprotein.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is palmitoyl-CoA:glycoprotein N-palmitoyltransferase. This enzyme is also called mucus glycoprotein fatty acyltransferase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism. This enzyme has at least one effector, Dithiothreitol.
