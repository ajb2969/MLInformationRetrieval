   Help:Musical symbols      Help:Musical symbols   In writing about music, it is sometimes necessary to use musical symbols within the text, as opposed to a musical example that might interrupt the flow of the text. Some of these needs are answered by :Template:Music . For longer examples, use tags as described in Help:Score .  Accidentals  The most common such need is for the flat and sharp symbols; thanks to Unicode and increased bandwidth on the Internet, the lowercase letter "b" and the pound sign "#" are no longer considered acceptable substitutes. However, not everyone has the proper fonts containing these characters. Furthermore, not every font that has these characters has them at the same code points. A font with the Unicode block "Miscellaneous Symbols" has them at 266D and 266F respectively. A font for a scorewriter might have them among the regular alphabet (as Finale does) or in a "Private Use Area" block; and in any case, a proprietary scorewriter might not allow the user to use the font in other programs, such as a Web browser. Future fonts may have these characters outside of Unicode Plane 1 altogether. Use of the Music template solves these problems.   Example : The sonata in B major has a slow movement in G minor.  Source : The sonata in B{{music|b}} major has a slow movement in G{{music|#}} minor.    However, when quoted text uses "-flat" or "-sharp" it might be better to leave that as it is. But if the quoted text is a facsimile of a typewritten manuscript using "b" or "#", it is likely the author meant to use the proper accidental and would have had if he had not been limited by the typewriter. Occasionally the natural sign might be needed, and on rare occasion the double flat and the double sharp. For full details see :Template:Music/doc#Accidentals .

With the music template, one can use either the American or the British names for these notes.   Example : The Presto is marked  = 210, but Steblin believes Beethoven meant  = 210 instead.  Source : The Presto is marked {{music|quarter}} = 210, but Steblin believes Beethoven meant {{music|quaver}} = 210 instead.    For a listing of all the notes available, see :Template:Music/doc#Notes and rests .  Scale degrees  For scale degrees, one could use the Music template or take advantage of LaTeX support. The only problem with LaTeX is that it really is meant more for mathematics than for musicology.   Example : The  shows up even before the transition to the second subject group.  Source : The {{music|sharp}}{{music|scale|4}} shows up even before the transition to the second subject group.   Example : The    ♯   4  ^       normal-♯   normal-^  4     \sharp\hat{4}   shows up even before the transition to the second subject group.  Source : The \sharp \hat 4 shows up even before the transition to the second subject group.    At this time, using Unicode's combining diacritical marks together with the ASCII numbers can't be relied upon to produce consistent results for all Web browsers.
