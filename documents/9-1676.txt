   Reciprocal Fibonacci constant      Reciprocal Fibonacci constant   The reciprocal Fibonacci constant , or ψ , is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the Fibonacci numbers :       ψ  =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞    1   F  k     =    1  1   +   1  1   +   1  2   +   1  3   +   1  5   +   1  8   +   1  13   +   1  21   +  ⋯    .        ψ    superscript   subscript     k  1        1   subscript  F  k              1  1     1  1     1  2     1  3     1  5     1  8     1  13     1  21   normal-⋯      \psi=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F_{k}}=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+%
 \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{13}+\frac{1}{21}+\cdots.     The ratio of successive terms in this sum tends to the reciprocal of the golden ratio . Since this is less than 1, the ratio test shows that the sum converges.  The value of ψ is known to be approximately       ψ  =   3.359885666243177553172011302918927179688905133731  …    .      ψ    3.359885666243177553172011302918927179688905133731  normal-…     \psi=3.359885666243177553172011302918927179688905133731\dots.     Gosper describes an algorithm for fast numerical approximation of its value. The reciprocal Fibonacci series itself provides O( k ) digits of accuracy for k terms of expansion, while Gosper's accelerated series provides O( k 2 ) digits. 1 ψ is known to be irrational ; this property was conjectured by Paul Erdős , Ronald Graham , and Leonard Carlitz , and proved in 1989 by Richard André-Jeannin . 2  The continued fraction representation of the constant is:       ψ  =   [  3  ;  2  ,  1  ,  3  ,  1  ,  1  ,  13  ,  2  ,  3  ,  3  ,  2  ,  1  ,  1  ,  6  ,  3  ,  2  ,  4  ,  362  ,  2  ,  4  ,  8  ,  6  ,  30  ,  50  ,  1  ,  6  ,  3  ,  3  ,  2  ,  7  ,  2  ,  3  ,  1  ,  3  ,  2  ,  …  ]    .      ψ   3  2  1  3  1  1  13  2  3  3  2  1  1  6  3  2  4  362  2  4  8  6  30  50  1  6  3  3  2  7  2  3  1  3  2  normal-…     \psi=[3;2,1,3,1,1,13,2,3,3,2,1,1,6,3,2,4,362,2,4,8,6,30,50,1,6,3,3,2,7,2,3,1,3%
