   L-balance theorem      L-balance theorem   In mathematical finite group theory, the L-balance theorem was proved by . The letter L stands for the layer of a group, and "balance" refers to the property discussed below.  Statement  The L-balance theorem of Gorenstein and Walter states that if X is a finite group and T a 2-subgroup of X then        L   2  ′     (    C  X    (  T  )    )    ≤    L   2  ′     (  X  )           subscript  L   superscript  2  normal-′       subscript  C  X   T       subscript  L   superscript  2  normal-′    X     L_{2^{\prime}}(C_{X}(T))\leq L_{2^{\prime}}(X)     Here L 2′ ( X ) stands for the 2-layer of a group X , which is the product of all the 2-components of the group, the minimal subnormal subgroups of X mapping onto components of X / O ( X ).  A consequence is that if a and b are commuting involutions of a group G then        L   2  ′     (     L   2  ′     (   C  a   )    ∩   C  b    )    =    L   2  ′     (     L   2  ′     (   C  b   )    ∩   C  a    )           subscript  L   superscript  2  normal-′         subscript  L   superscript  2  normal-′     subscript  C  a     subscript  C  b        subscript  L   superscript  2  normal-′         subscript  L   superscript  2  normal-′     subscript  C  b     subscript  C  a       L_{2^{\prime}}(L_{2^{\prime}}(C_{a})\cap C_{b})=L_{2^{\prime}}(L_{2^{\prime}}(%
 C_{b})\cap C_{a})   This is the property called L -balance.  More generally similar results are true if the prime 2 is replaced by an prime p , and in this case the condition is called L p -balance, but the proof of this requires the classification of finite simple groups (more precisely the Schreier conjecture ).
