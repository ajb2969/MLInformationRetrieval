L-balance theorem

In mathematical finite group theory, the L-balance theorem was proved by . The letter L stands for the layer of a group, and "balance" refers to the property discussed below.
Statement
The L-balance theorem of Gorenstein and Walter states that if X is a finite group and T a 2-subgroup of X then



Here L2â€²(X) stands for the 2-layer of a group X, which is the product of all the 2-components of the group, the minimal subnormal subgroups of X mapping onto components of X/O(X).
A consequence is that if a and b are commuting involutions of a group G then


 
  This is the property called L-balance.
More generally similar results are true if the prime 2 is replaced by an prime p, and in this case the condition is called Lp-balance, but the proof of this requires the classification of finite simple groups (more precisely the Schreier conjecture).
