Young model




Young model

Young model is a radio propagation model that was built on the data collected on New York City. It typically models the behaviour of cellular communication systems in large cities.
Applicable to/under conditions
This model is ideal for modeling the behaviour of cellular communications in large cities with tall structures.
Coverage
Frequency: 150 MHz to 3700 MHz
History
Young model was built on the data of 1952 in New York City.
Mathematical formulation
The mathematical formulation for Young model is:



Where,

L = path loss. Unit: decibel (dB)
 
GB = gain of base transmitter. Unit: decibel (dB)
 
GM = gain of mobile transmitter. Unit: decibel (dB)
 
hB = height of base station antenna. Unit: meter (m)
 
hM = height of mobile station antenna. Unit: meter (m)
 
d = link distance. Unit: kilometer (km)
 


 
  = clutter factor
