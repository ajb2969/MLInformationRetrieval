   Young model      Young model   Young model is a radio propagation model that was built on the data collected on New York City . It typically models the behaviour of cellular communication systems in large cities.  Applicable to/under conditions  This model is ideal for modeling the behaviour of cellular communications in large cities with tall structures.  Coverage  Frequency : 150 MHz to 3700 MHz  History  Young model was built on the data of 1952 in New York City .  Mathematical formulation  The mathematical formulation for Young model is:       L   =     G  B      G  M      (      h  B     h  M     d  2    )   2   β       L     subscript  G  B    subscript  G  M    superscript       subscript  h  B    subscript  h  M     superscript  d  2    2   β     L\;=\;G_{B}\;G_{M}\;\left(\frac{h_{B}\;h_{M}}{d^{2}}\right)^{2}\beta     Where,   L = path loss . Unit: decibel (dB)  G B = gain of base transmitter. Unit: decibel (dB)  G M = gain of mobile transmitter. Unit: decibel (dB)  h B = height of base station antenna. Unit: meter (m)  h M = height of mobile station antenna. Unit: meter (m)  d = link distance. Unit: kilometer (km)     β   β   \beta   = clutter factor    See also   Hata Model for Urban Areas  Hata Model for Suburban Areas  Hata Model for Open Areas  Log-distance path loss model   External links   VOLCANO advanced radio propagation model including both direct-path and multi-path ray-tracing models   "  Category:Radio frequency propagation
