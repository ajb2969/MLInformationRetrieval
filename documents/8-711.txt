   Degree Lintner      Degree Lintner   °Lintner or degrees Lintner is a unit used to measure the ability of a malt to reduce starch to sugar , that is, its diastatic power . While the measurement is applicable to any amylase , in general it refers to the combined α-amylase and β-amylase used in brewing . The term is also generalized to diastatic malt extracts and separately prepared brewing enzymes. The abbreviation °L is official, but in brewing applications it may conflict with °L used for degrees Lovibond .  JECFA, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives , defines the degree Lintner as follows:   A malt has a diastatic power of 100 °L if 0.1 cc of a clear 5% infusion of the malt, acting on 100cc of a 2% starch solution at 20°C for one hour , produces sufficient reducing sugars to reduce completely 5cc of Fehling's solution .    Note that the amylases used in brewing reach their peak efficiencies around 66 °C.  Evaluation of a malt or extract is usually done by the manufacturer rather than by the end user; as a rule of thumb, the total grain bill of a mash should have a diastatic power of at least 40 °L in order to guarantee efficient conversion of all the starches in the mash to sugars.  The most active barley malts currently available have a diastatic activity of up to 160 °Lintner.  In Europe, diastatic activity is often stated in Windisch–Kolbach units (°WK). These are related approximately to °Lintner by:       Lintner    ∘   =     WK    ∘   +  16   3.5        superscript  Lintner         superscript  WK    16   3.5     {}^{\circ}\mbox{Lintner}=\frac{{}^{\circ}\mbox{WK}+16}{3.5}          WK    ∘   =    (   3.5  ×   Lintner    ∘    )   -  16        superscript  WK        3.5   superscript  Lintner     16     {}^{\circ}\mbox{WK}=\left(3.5\times{}^{\circ}\mbox{Lintner}\right)-16   .  100.0 °Lintner equals 3.014 × 10 −7  katal or 18.08 enzyme units .
