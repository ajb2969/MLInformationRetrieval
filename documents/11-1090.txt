   Glutamine—scyllo-inositol transaminase      Glutamine—scyllo-inositol transaminase   In enzymology , a glutamine-scyllo-inositol transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamine + 2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutaramate + 1-amino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine and 2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone , whereas its two products are 2-oxoglutaramate and 1-amino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine:2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone aminotransferase . Other names in common use include glutamine scyllo-inosose aminotransferase , L-glutamine-keto-scyllo-inositol aminotransferase , glutamine-scyllo-inosose transaminase , and L-glutamine-scyllo-inosose transaminase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
