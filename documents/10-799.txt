   Methylenetetrahydrofolate—tRNA-(uracil-5-)-methyltransferase      Methylenetetrahydrofolate—tRNA-(uracil-5-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a methylenetetrahydrofolate-tRNA-(uracil-5-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + tRNA containing uridine at position 54 + FADH 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrahydrofolate + tRNA containing ribothymidine at position 54 + FAD   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , tRNA containing uridine at position 54 , and FADH2 , whereas its 3 products are tetrahydrofolate , tRNA containing ribothymidine at position 54 , and FAD .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyl-transferase . Other names in common use include (FADH2-oxidizing) , folate-dependent ribothymidyl synthase , methylenetetrahydrofolate-transfer ribonucleate uracil , 5-methyltransferase , 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:tRNA-UPsiC , and (uracil-5-)-methyl-transferase .
