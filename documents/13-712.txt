Spherical image

In differential geometry, the spherical image of a unit-speed curve is given by taking the curve's tangent vectors as points, all of which must lie on the unit sphere. The movement of the spherical image describes the changes in the original curve's direction1 If 
 
 
 
  is a unit-speed curve, that is 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the unit tangent vector field along 
 
 
 
 , then the curve 
 
 
 
  is the spherical image of 
 
 
 
 . All points of
