   Spherical image      Spherical image   In differential geometry , the spherical image of a unit-speed curve is given by taking the curve's tangent vectors as points, all of which must lie on the unit sphere . The movement of the spherical image describes the changes in the original curve's direction 1 If   α   α   \alpha   is a unit-speed curve, that is     ∥   α  ′   ∥   =  1       norm   superscript  α  normal-′    1    \|\alpha^{\prime}\|=1   , and   T   T   T   is the unit tangent vector field along   α   α   \alpha   , then the curve    σ  =  T      σ  T    \sigma=T   is the spherical image of   α   α   \alpha   . All points of   σ   σ   \sigma   must lie on the unit sphere because     ∥  σ  ∥   =   ∥  T  ∥   =  1         norm  σ    norm  T        1     \|\sigma\|=\|T\|=1   .
