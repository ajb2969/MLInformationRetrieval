   Sound intensity      Sound intensity   Sound intensity or acoustic intensity is defined as the sound power per unit area. The SI unit of sound intensity is the watt per square metre (W/m 2 ). The usual context is the noise measurement of sound intensity in the air at a listener's location as a sound energy quantity. 1  Sound intensity is not the same physical quantity as sound pressure . Hearing is directly sensitive to sound pressure which is related to sound intensity. In consumer audio electronics, the level differences are called "intensity" differences, but sound intensity is a specifically defined quantity and cannot be sensed by a simple microphone.  Mathematical definition  Sound intensity, denoted I , is defined by      ùêà  =   p  ùêØ       ùêà    p  ùêØ     \mathbf{I}=p\mathbf{v}   where   p is the sound pressure ;  v is the particle velocity .   Both I and v are vectors , which means that both have a direction as well as a magnitude. The direction of sound intensity is the average direction in which energy is flowing.  The average sound intensity during time T is given by        ‚ü®  ùêà  ‚ü©   =    1  T     ‚à´  0  T    p   (  t  )   ùêØ   (  t  )   d  t      .       delimited-‚ü®‚ü©  ùêà       1  T     superscript   subscript   0   T     p  t  ùêØ  t  normal-d  t       \langle\mathbf{I}\rangle=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}p(t)\mathbf{v}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t.     Relationships with other quantities  Sound intensity in the direction of the sound force is related to sound power :       I  =   P  A    ,      I    P  A     I=\frac{P}{A},   where   P is the sound power;  A is the area.   Sound intensity in the direction of the sound force is related sound energy density :       I  =   c  w    ,      I    c  w     I=cw,   where   c is the speed of sound ;  w is the sound energy density.   Inverse-square law  For a spherical sound wave, the intensity in the radial direction as a function of distance r from the centre of the sphere is given by        I   (  r  )    =   P   A   (  r  )     =   P   4  œÄ   r  2      ,          I  r     P    A  r           P    4  œÄ   superscript  r  2        I(r)=\frac{P}{A(r)}=\frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}},   where   P is the sound power;  A ( r ) is the area of a sphere of radius r .   Thus sound intensity decreases as 1/ r 2 from the centre of the sphere:        I   (  r  )    ‚àù   1   r  2     .     proportional-to    I  r     1   superscript  r  2      I(r)\propto\frac{1}{r^{2}}.     This relationship is an inverse-square law .  Sound intensity level  Sound intensity level (SIL) or acoustic intensity level is a logarithmic measure of the sound intensity of a sound relative to a reference value. Sound intensity level, denoted L I and measured in dB , is defined by 2        L  I   =    1  2     ln    (   I   I  0    )    Np   =      log  10     (   I   I  0    )    B   =   10     log  10     (   I   I  0    )    dB    ,         subscript  L  I       1  2       I   subscript  I  0     Np            subscript   10     I   subscript  I  0     normal-B          10    subscript   10     I   subscript  I  0     dB      L_{I}=\frac{1}{2}\ln\!\left(\frac{I}{I_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{Np}=\log_{10}\!%
 \left(\frac{I}{I_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{B}=10\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{I}{I_{0}}%
 \right)\!~{}\mathrm{dB},   where   I is the sound intensity;  I 0 is the reference sound intensity ;   is the neper ;   is the bel ;   is the decibel .   The commonly used reference sound intensity in air is 3        I  0   =     1   pW   /   m  2     .       subscript  I  0       1  pW    superscript  normal-m  2      I_{0}=1~{}\mathrm{pW/m^{2}}.   The proper notations for sound intensity level using this reference are or , but the notations , , dBSIL, or dB SIL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI. 4  The reference sound intensity I 0 is defined such that a progressive plane wave has the same value of sound intensity level (SIL) and sound pressure level (SPL), since       I  ‚àù   p  2    .     proportional-to  I   superscript  p  2     I\propto p^{2}.   The equality of SIL and SPL requires that        I   I  0    =    p  2    p  0  2     ,        I   subscript  I  0       superscript  p  2    superscript   subscript  p  0   2      \frac{I}{I_{0}}=\frac{p^{2}}{p_{0}^{2}},   where is the reference sound pressure.  For a progressive spherical wave,        p  v   =   z  0    ,        p  v    subscript  z  0     \frac{p}{v}=z_{0},   where z 0 is the characteristic specific acoustic impedance . Thus,        I  0   =     p  0  2   I    p  2    =     p  0  2   p  v    p  2    =    p  0  2    z  0     .         subscript  I  0        superscript   subscript  p  0   2   I    superscript  p  2              superscript   subscript  p  0   2   p  v    superscript  p  2            superscript   subscript  p  0   2    subscript  z  0       I_{0}=\frac{p_{0}^{2}I}{p^{2}}=\frac{p_{0}^{2}pv}{p^{2}}=\frac{p_{0}^{2}}{z_{0%
 }}.   In air at ambient temperature, , hence the reference value . 5  In an anechoic chamber , which approximates a free field (no reflection), the SIL can be taken as being equal to the SPL. This fact is exploited to measure sound power in anechoic conditions.  Measurement  One method of sound intensity measurement involves the use of two microphones located close to each other, normal to the direction of sound energy flow. A signal analyser is used to compute the crosspower between the measured pressures and the sound intensity is derived from (proportional to) the imaginary part of the crosspower. 6  References  External links   How Many Decibels Is Twice as Loud?
