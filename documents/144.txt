   Dym equation      Dym equation   In mathematics , and in particular in the theory of solitons , the Dym equation ( HD ) is the third-order partial differential equation        u  t   =    u  3    u   x  x  x      .       subscript  u  t      superscript  u  3    subscript  u    x  x  x       u_{t}=u^{3}u_{xxx}.\,     It is often written in the equivalent form        v  t   =    (   v   -   1  /  2     )    x  x  x     .       subscript  v  t    subscript   superscript  v      1  2       x  x  x      v_{t}=(v^{-1/2})_{xxx}.\,     The Dym equation first appeared in Kruskal 1 and is attributed to an unpublished paper by Harry Dym .  The Dym equation represents a system in which dispersion and nonlinearity are coupled together. HD is a completely integrable  nonlinear  evolution equation that may be solved by means of the inverse scattering transform . It is interesting because it obeys an infinite number of conservation laws ; it does not possess the Painlevé property .  The Dym equation has strong links to the Korteweg–de Vries equation . The Lax pair of the Harry Dym equation is associated with the Sturm–Liouville operator . The Liouville transformation transforms this operator isospectrally into the Schrödinger operator. 2 Thus by the inverse Liouville transformation solutions of the Korteweg–de Vries equation are transformed into solutions of the Dym equation. An explicit solution of the Dym equation, valid in a finite interval, is found by an auto- Bäcklund transform 3        u   (  t  ,  x  )    =    [   -   3  α   (   x  +   4   α  2   t    )     ]    2  /  3     .        u   t  x     superscript   delimited-[]      3  α    x    4   superscript  α  2   t         2  3      u(t,x)=\left[-3\alpha\left(x+4\alpha^{2}t\right)\right]^{2/3}.
