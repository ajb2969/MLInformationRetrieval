   Orthostochastic matrix      Orthostochastic matrix   In mathematics , an orthostochastic matrix is a doubly stochastic matrix whose entries are the squares of the absolute values of the entries of some orthogonal matrix .  The detailed definition is as follows. A square matrix B of size n is doubly stochastic (or bistochastic ) if all its rows and columns sum to 1 and all its entries are nonnegative real numbers , each of whose rows and columns sums to 1. It is orthostochastic if there exists an orthogonal matrix  O such that         B   i  j    =    O   i  j   2   for  i    ,   j  =   1  ,  …  ,  n     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  B    i  j       superscript   subscript  O    i  j    2   for  i      j   1  normal-…  n      B_{ij}=O_{ij}^{2}\text{ for }i,j=1,\dots,n.\,     All 2-by-2 doubly stochastic matrices are orthostochastic (and also unistochastic ) since for any      B  =   [     a     1  -  a        1  -  a     a     ]       B    a    1  a       1  a   a      B=\begin{bmatrix}a&1-a\\
 1-a&a\end{bmatrix}   we find the corresponding orthogonal matrix       O  =   [      cos  ϕ      sin  ϕ        -   sin  ϕ       cos  ϕ      ]    ,      O      ϕ     ϕ         ϕ      ϕ       O=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\phi&\sin\phi\\
 -\sin\phi&\cos\phi\end{bmatrix},   with       cos  2   ϕ   =  a   ,        superscript   2   ϕ   a    \cos^{2}\phi=a,   such that      B   i  j    =   O   i  j   2    .       subscript  B    i  j     superscript   subscript  O    i  j    2     B_{ij}=O_{ij}^{2}.     For larger n the sets of bistochastic matrices includes the set of unistochastic matrices, which includes the set of orthostochastic matrices and these inclusion relations are proper.
