Josephson phase

In superconductivity, the Josephson phase is the difference of the phases of the quantum mechanical wave function in two superconducting electrodes forming a Josephson junction.
For example, if the macroscopic wave functions 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in superconductors 1 and 2 are given by





then the Josephson phase is
