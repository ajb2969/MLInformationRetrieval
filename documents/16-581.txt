   Reshetnyak gluing theorem      Reshetnyak gluing theorem   In metric geometry , the Reshetnyak gluing theorem gives information on the structure of a geometric object build by using as building blocks other geometric objects, belonging to a well defined class . Intuitively, it states that a manifold obtained by joining (i.e. " gluing ") together, in a precisely defined way, other manifolds having a given property inherit that very same property.  The theorem was first stated and proved by Yurii Reshetnyak in 1968. 1  Statement  Theorem: Let    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   be complete  locally compact  geodesic  metric spaces of CAT curvature      ≤  κ      absent  κ    \leq\kappa   , and     C  i   ⊂   X  i        subscript  C  i    subscript  X  i     C_{i}\subset X_{i}    convex subsets which are isometric . Then the manifold    X   X   X   , obtained by gluing all    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   along all    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   , is also of CAT curvature     ≤  κ      absent  κ    \leq\kappa   .
