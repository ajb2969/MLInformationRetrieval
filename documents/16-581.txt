Reshetnyak gluing theorem

In metric geometry, the Reshetnyak gluing theorem gives information on the structure of a geometric object build by using as building blocks other geometric objects, belonging to a well defined class. Intuitively, it states that a manifold obtained by joining (i.e. "gluing") together, in a precisely defined way, other manifolds having a given property inherit that very same property.
The theorem was first stated and proved by Yurii Reshetnyak in 1968.1
Statement
Theorem: Let 
 
 
 
  be complete locally compact geodesic metric spaces of CAT curvature

 
 , and 
 
 
convex subsets which are isometric. Then the manifold

 
 , obtained by gluing all 
 
 
 
  along all 
 
 
 
 , is also of CAT curvature 
 
 
 
 .
