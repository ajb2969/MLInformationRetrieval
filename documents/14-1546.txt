Numerical 3-dimensional matching

Numerical 3-dimensional matching is an NP-complete decision problem. It is given by three multisets of integers

 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , each containing 
 
 
 
  elements, and a bound 
 
 
 
 
 . The goal is to select a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that every integer in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  occurs exactly once and that for every triple 
 
 
 
  in the subset 
 
 
 
  holds. This problem is labeled as [SP16] in.1
Example
Take 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . This instance has a solution, namely 
 
 
 
 . Note that each triple sums to 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
  is not a solution for several reasons: not every number is used (a 
 
 
 
 
  is missing), a number is used too often (the 
 
 
 
 ) and not every triple sums to 
 
 
 
  (since 
 
 
 
 ). However, there is at least one solution to this problem, which is the property we are interested in with decision problems. If we would take 
 
 
 
  for the same 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , this problem would have no solution (all numbers sum to 
 
 
 
 , which is not equal to 
 
 
 
  in this case).
Related problems
Every instance of the Numerical 3-dimensional matching problem is an instance of both the 3-partition problem, and the 3-dimensional matching problem.
Proof of NP-completeness
NP-completeness of the 3-partition problem is stated by Garey and Johnson in "Computers and Intractability; A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness".2 It is done by a reduction from 3-dimensional matching via 4-partition. To prove NP-completeness of the numerical 3-dimensional matching, the proof is similar, but a reduction from 3-dimensional matching via the numerical 4-dimensional matching problem should be used.
