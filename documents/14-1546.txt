   Numerical 3-dimensional matching      Numerical 3-dimensional matching   Numerical 3-dimensional matching is an NP-complete decision problem. It is given by three multisets of integers    X   X   X   ,   Y   Y   Y   and   Z   Z   Z   , each containing   k   k   k   elements, and a bound   b   b   b   . The goal is to select a subset   M   M   M   of    X  ×  Y  ×  Z      X  Y  Z    X\times Y\times Z   such that every integer in   X   X   X   ,   Y   Y   Y   and   Z   Z   Z   occurs exactly once and that for every triple    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     x  y  z    (x,y,z)   in the subset     x  +  y  +  z   =  b        x  y  z   b    x+y+z=b   holds. This problem is labeled as [SP16] in. 1  Example  Take    X  =   {  3  ,  4  ,  4  }       X   3  4  4     X=\{3,4,4\}   ,    Y  =   {  1  ,  4  ,  6  }       Y   1  4  6     Y=\{1,4,6\}   and    Z  =   {  1  ,  2  ,  5  }       Z   1  2  5     Z=\{1,2,5\}   , and    b  =  10      b  10    b=10   . This instance has a solution, namely    {   (  3  ,  6  ,  1  )   ,   (  4  ,  4  ,  2  )   ,   (  4  ,  1  ,  5  )   }      3  6  1    4  4  2    4  1  5     \{(3,6,1),(4,4,2),(4,1,5)\}   . Note that each triple sums to    b  =  10      b  10    b=10   . The set    {   (  3  ,  6  ,  1  )   ,   (  3  ,  4  ,  2  )   ,   (  4  ,  1  ,  5  )   }      3  6  1    3  4  2    4  1  5     \{(3,6,1),(3,4,2),(4,1,5)\}   is not a solution for several reasons: not every number is used (a    4  ∈  X      4  X    4\in X   is missing), a number is used too often (the    3  ∈  X      3  X    3\in X   ) and not every triple sums to   b   b   b   (since     3  +  4  +  2   =  9  ≠  b  =  10          3  4  2   9       b       10     3+4+2=9\neq b=10   ). However, there is at least one solution to this problem, which is the property we are interested in with decision problems. If we would take    b  =  11      b  11    b=11   for the same   X   X   X   ,   Y   Y   Y   and   Z   Z   Z   , this problem would have no solution (all numbers sum to   30   30   30   , which is not equal to     k  ⋅  b   =  33       normal-⋅  k  b   33    k\cdot b=33   in this case).  Related problems  Every instance of the Numerical 3-dimensional matching problem is an instance of both the 3-partition problem , and the 3-dimensional matching problem.  Proof of NP-completeness  NP-completeness of the 3-partition problem is stated by Garey and Johnson in "Computers and Intractability; A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness". 2 It is done by a reduction from 3-dimensional matching via 4-partition. To prove NP-completeness of the numerical 3-dimensional matching, the proof is similar, but a reduction from 3-dimensional matching via the numerical 4-dimensional matching problem should be used.
