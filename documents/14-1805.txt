   Last geometric statement of Jacobi      Last geometric statement of Jacobi   In differential geometry and algebraic geometry , the last geometric statement of Jacobi is a conjecture named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi . According to this conjecture, every caustic from any point   p   p   p   on an ellipsoid other than umbilical points has exactly four cusps.  References    .
