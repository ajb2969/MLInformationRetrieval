   Martingale central limit theorem      Martingale central limit theorem   In probability theory , the central limit theorem says that, under certain conditions, the sum of many independent identically-distributed random variables , when scaled appropriately, converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution . The martingale central limit theorem generalizes this result for random variables to martingales , which are stochastic processes where the change in the value of the process from time t to time t + 1 has expectation zero, even conditioned on previous outcomes.  Statement  Here is a simple version of the martingale central limit theorem: Let       X  1   ,   X  2   ,   …       subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…    X_{1},X_{2},\dots\,   -- be a martingale with bounded increments, i.e., suppose        E   [    X   t  +  1    -   X  t    |   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  t   ]    =   0    ,       normal-E     subscript  X    t  1     subscript  X  t     subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  t    0    \operatorname{E}[X_{t+1}-X_{t}|X_{1},\dots,X_{t}]=0\,,     and       |    X   t  +  1    -   X  t    |   ≤  k           subscript  X    t  1     subscript  X  t     k    |X_{t+1}-X_{t}|\leq k     almost surely for some fixed bound k and all t . Also assume that     |   X  1   |   ≤  k         subscript  X  1    k    |X_{1}|\leq k   almost surely.  Define        σ  t  2   =   E   [    (    X   t  +  1    -   X  t    )   2   |   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  t   ]     ,       superscript   subscript  σ  t   2    normal-E   superscript     subscript  X    t  1     subscript  X  t    2    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  t      \sigma_{t}^{2}=\operatorname{E}[(X_{t+1}-X_{t})^{2}|X_{1},\ldots,X_{t}],     and let        τ  ν   =   min   {   t  :     ∑   i  =  1   t    σ  i  2    ≥  ν    }     .       subscript  τ  ν      normal-:  t      superscript   subscript     i  1    t    superscript   subscript  σ  i   2    ν       \tau_{\nu}=\min\left\{t:\sum_{i=1}^{t}\sigma_{i}^{2}\geq\nu\right\}.     Then       X   τ  ν     ν        subscript  X   subscript  τ  ν      ν     \frac{X_{\tau_{\nu}}}{\sqrt{\nu}}     converges in distribution to the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 as    ν  →   +   ∞       normal-→  ν        \nu\to+\infty\!   . More explicitly,          lim   ν  →   +  ∞      P   (     X   τ  ν     ν    <  x   )     =   Φ   (  x  )    =    1    2  π       ∫   -  ∞   x     exp   (   -    u  2   2    )    d  u      ,   x  ∈  ℝ    .     formulae-sequence        subscript    normal-→  ν         normal-P       subscript  X   subscript  τ  ν      ν    x       normal-Φ  x            1      2  π       superscript   subscript        x            superscript  u  2   2     d  u         x  ℝ     \lim_{\nu\to+\infty}\operatorname{P}\left(\frac{X_{\tau_{\nu}}}{\sqrt{\nu}}     References  Many other variants on the martingale central limit theorem can be found in:      For the discussion of Theorem 5.4 there, and correct form of Corollary 5.3(ii), see   "  Category:Martingale theory  Category:Central limit theorem
