Martingale central limit theorem

In probability theory, the central limit theorem says that, under certain conditions, the sum of many independent identically-distributed random variables, when scaled appropriately, converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution. The martingale central limit theorem generalizes this result for random variables to martingales, which are stochastic processes where the change in the value of the process from time t to time t + 1 has expectation zero, even conditioned on previous outcomes.
Statement
Here is a simple version of the martingale central limit theorem: Let


 
  -- be a martingale with bounded increments, i.e., suppose



and



almost surely for some fixed bound k and all t. Also assume that 
 
 
 
  almost surely.
Define



and let



Then



converges in distribution to the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 as 
 
 
 
 . More explicitly,
