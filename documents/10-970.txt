   Selenate reductase      Selenate reductase   In enzymology , a selenate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   selenite + H 2 O + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   selenate + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are selenite , H 2 O , and acceptor , whereas its two products are selenate and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is selenite:reduced acceptor oxidoreductase .
