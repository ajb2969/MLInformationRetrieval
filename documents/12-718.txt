Codex Athous Lavrensis

Codex Athous Laurae designated by Ψ or 044 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), δ 6 (von Soden), is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament on parchment. The manuscript is lacunose. It has an eclectic and mixed text. It has marginalia.
The codex is now kept in a monastery (Great Lavra B' 52) at Athos peninsula.1
Description
Original codex contained entire of the New Testament except of the Book of Revelation. Actually it has lacunae at the beginning and end. The Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark 1:1-9:5, and one leaf from the Hebrews with text 8:11-9:19 have been lost.
The order of books: four Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, the General epistles, and the Pauline epistles. The General epistles are in an unusual order (1-2 Peter, James, 1-3 John, and Jude). The shorter ending of Mark is before the longer one (like in Codex Regius and all other Greek codices in which it appears).2
The codex contains 261 parchment leaves (21 cm by 15.3 cm).3 The dimensions of text is 15 cm by 8,7 cm.4
It was written in one column per page, 31 lines per page, in small uncial letters.5 The letters have breathings and accents.6 It contains tables of the κεφαλαια (tables of contents) before each book, the Ammonian Sections (in Mark 233 sections), Eusebian Canons, lectionary equipment on a margin (for liturgical use), musical notes (neumes), and subscriptions.7 It is one of the oldest manuscripts with musical notes.
The verses Mark  and Mark  are omitted. The text of the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) is omitted.89
The codex is dated palaeographically to the 8th or 9th century.10
Text
The Greek text of this codex is generally described as a representative of the Byzantine text-type, but with a large portion of the Alexandrian, and some Western readings. It has unusually mixed text. Von Soden lists it as generally Alexandrian. In the Gospel of Mark and the General epistles it represents the Alexandrian text-type.11 In Gospel of Luke and John the Byzantine element is predominate, but with larger proportion of Alexandrian readings than in Codex Sangallensis 48.12 In the Acts and the Pauline epistles the Byzantine element is predominant.13 The text of the General epistles seems to be of the same type found in Codex Alexandrinus, 33, 81, and 436. Kurt Aland placed the text of the codex in Category III in the Gospels, Acts, Pauline epistles, and in Category II in the General epistles.14

History
The manuscript was first seen by C. R. Gregory on August 26, 1886, who described it as the first. In 1892 it has been seen but not examined by J. Rendel Harris, who was inspecting the Septuaginta manuscripts. Von Goltz and Wobbermin had collated text of Acts, General epistles, and Pauline epistles for Hermann von Soden. The codex was examined by Kirsopp Lake in 1899, who thoroughly examined the Gospel of Mark and collated the text of the Gospel of Luke and John. He did not examine the text of Acts and the Epistles because, according Soden's opinion, their text was ordinary. In 1903, Lake published the text of the Gospel of Mark 9:5-16:20, and a collation of the Gospels of Luke, John, and Epistle to the Colossians in Studia Biblica et Ecclesiastica.33
