Geometric programming

A geometric program (GP) is an optimization problem of the form

Minimize 
 
 
 
  subject to
 
 






where 
 
 
 
  are posynomials and 
 
 
 
  are monomials.
 

In the context of geometric programming (unlike all other disciplines), a monomial is defined as a function 
 
 
 
  defined as



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
GPs have numerous application, such as components sizing in IC design1 and parameter estimation via logistic regression in statistics. The maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression is a GP.
Convex form
Geometric programs are not (in general) convex optimization problems, but they can be transformed to convex problems by a change of variables and a transformation of the objective and constraint functions. In particular, defining 
 
 
 
 , the monomial 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, if 
 
 
 
  is the posynomial



then 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . After the change of variables, a posynomial becomes a sum of exponentials of affine functions.
