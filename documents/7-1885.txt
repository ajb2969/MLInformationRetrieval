   Pseudolikelihood      Pseudolikelihood   In statistical theory , a pseudolikelihood is an approximation to the joint probability distribution of a collection of random variables . The practical use of this is that it can provide an approximation to the likelihood function of a set of observed data which may either provide a computationally simpler problem for estimation , or may provide a way of obtaining explicit estimates of model parameters.  The pseudolikelihood approach was introduced by Julian Besag 1 in the context of analysing data having spatial dependence .  Definition  Given a set of random variables    X  =    X  1   ,   X  2   ,  …  ,   X  n        X    subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…   subscript  X  n      X=X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}   and a set   E   E   E   of dependencies between these random variables, where     {   X  i   ,   X  j   }   ∉  E        subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j    E    \{X_{i},X_{j}\}\notin E   implies    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   is conditionally independent of    X  j     subscript  X  j    X_{j}   given    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   's neighbors, the pseudolikelihood of    X  =  x  =   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   …   x  n    )         X  x         subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     normal-…   subscript  x  n        X=x=(x_{1},x_{2},...x_{n})   is        Pr   (   X  =  x   )    =    ∏  i    Pr   (    X  i   =   x  i    |    X  j   =     x  j     for    all    j    for    which    {   X  i   ,   X  j   }    ∈  E   )      .       Pr    X  x      subscript  product  i    Pr     subscript  X  i    subscript  x  i         subscript  X  j      subscript  x  j   for  all  j  for  which    subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j          E        \Pr(X=x)=\prod_{i}\Pr(X_{i}=x_{i}|X_{j}=x_{j}\ \mathrm{for\ all\ }j\ \mathrm{%
 for\ which}\ \{X_{i},X_{j}\}\in E).     Here   X   X   X   is a vector of variables,   x   x   x   is a vector of values. The expression    X  =  x      X  x    X=x   above means that each variable    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   in the vector   X   X   X   has a corresponding value    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   in the vector   x   x   x   . The expression    Pr   (   X  =  x   )      Pr    X  x     \Pr(X=x)   is the probability that the vector of variables   X   X   X   has values equal to the vector   x   x   x   . Because situations can often be described using state variables ranging over a set of possible values, the expression    Pr   (   X  =  x   )      Pr    X  x     \Pr(X=x)   can therefore represent the probability of a certain state among all possible states allowed by the state variables.  The pseudo-log-likelihood is a similar measure derived from the above expression. Thus        log   Pr   (   X  =  x   )     =    ∑  i    log   Pr   (    X  i   =   x  i    |    X  j   =     x  j     for    all    {   X  i   ,   X  j   }    ∈  E   )       .         Pr    X  x       subscript   i      Pr     subscript  X  i    subscript  x  i         subscript  X  j      subscript  x  j   for  all    subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j          E         \log\Pr(X=x)=\sum_{i}\log\Pr(X_{i}=x_{i}|X_{j}=x_{j}\ \mathrm{for\ all}\ \{X_{%
 i},X_{j}\}\in E).     One use of the pseudolikelihood measure is as an approximation for inference about a Markov or Bayesian network , as the pseudolikelihood of an assignment to    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   may often be computed more efficiently than the likelihood, particularly when the latter may require marginalization over a large number of variables.  Properties  Use of the pseudolikelihood in place of the true likelihood function in a maximum likelihood analysis can lead to good estimates, but a straightforward application of the usual likelihood techniques to derive information about estimation uncertainty, or for significance testing , would in general be incorrect. 2  References  "  Category:Statistical inference     Besag, J.
