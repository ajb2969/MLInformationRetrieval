   Interval exchange transformation      Interval exchange transformation   In mathematics , an interval exchange transformation 1 is a kind of dynamical system that generalises circle rotation . The phase space consists of the unit interval , and the transformation acts by cutting the interval into several subintervals, and then permuting these subintervals.  Formal definition  Let    n  >  0      n  0    n>0   and let   π   π   \pi   be a permutation on    1  ,  …  ,  n     1  normal-…  n    1,\dots,n   . Consider a vector     λ  =   (   λ  1   ,  …  ,   λ  n   )       λ    subscript  λ  1   normal-…   subscript  λ  n      \lambda=(\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n})   of positive real numbers (the widths of the subintervals), satisfying        ∑   i  =  1   n    λ  i    =  1.        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  λ  i    1.    \sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}=1.     Define a map      T   π  ,  λ    :    [  0  ,  1  ]   →   [  0  ,  1  ]     ,     normal-:   subscript  T   π  λ     normal-→   0  1    0  1      T_{\pi,\lambda}:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1],   called the interval exchange transformation associated to the pair    (  π  ,  λ  )     π  λ    (\pi,\lambda)    as follows. For    1  ≤  i  ≤  n        1  i       n     1\leq i\leq n   let         a  i   =     ∑   1  ≤  j  <  i     λ  j    and      a  i  ′   =    ∑   1  ≤  j  <   π   (  i  )       λ    π   -  1     (  j  )        .     formulae-sequence     subscript  a  i      subscript       1  j       i      subscript  λ  j    and       subscript   superscript  a  normal-′   i     subscript       1  j         π  i       subscript  λ     superscript  π    1    j        a_{i}=\sum_{1\leq j     Then for    x  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       x   0  1     x\in[0,1]   , define        T   π  ,  λ     (  x  )    =    x  -   a  i    +   a  i  ′           subscript  T   π  λ    x       x   subscript  a  i     subscript   superscript  a  normal-′   i      T_{\pi,\lambda}(x)=x-a_{i}+a^{\prime}_{i}     if   x   x   x   lies in the subinterval    [   a  i   ,    a  i   +   λ  i    )      subscript  a  i      subscript  a  i    subscript  λ  i      [a_{i},a_{i}+\lambda_{i})   . Thus    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   acts on each subinterval of the form    [   a  i   ,    a  i   +   λ  i    )      subscript  a  i      subscript  a  i    subscript  λ  i      [a_{i},a_{i}+\lambda_{i})   by a translation , and it rearranges these subintervals so that the subinterval at position   i   i   i   is moved to position    π   (  i  )       π  i    \pi(i)   .  Properties  Any interval exchange transformation    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is a bijection of    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   to itself preserves the Lebesgue measure . It is continuous except at a finite number of points.  The inverse of the interval exchange transformation    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is again an interval exchange transformation. In fact, it is the transformation    T    π   -  1    ,   λ  ′       subscript  T    superscript  π    1     superscript  λ  normal-′      T_{\pi^{-1},\lambda^{\prime}}   where     λ  i  ′   =   λ    π   -  1     (  i  )          subscript   superscript  λ  normal-′   i    subscript  λ     superscript  π    1    i      \lambda^{\prime}_{i}=\lambda_{\pi^{-1}(i)}   for all    1  ≤  i  ≤  n        1  i       n     1\leq i\leq n   .  If    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   and    π  =   (  12  )       π  12    \pi=(12)   (in cycle notation ), and if we join up the ends of the interval to make a circle, then    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is just a circle rotation. The Weyl equidistribution theorem then asserts that if the length    λ  1     subscript  λ  1    \lambda_{1}   is irrational , then    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is uniquely ergodic . Roughly speaking, this means that the orbits of points of    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   are uniformly evenly distributed. On the other hand, if    λ  1     subscript  λ  1    \lambda_{1}   is rational then each point of the interval is periodic , and the period is the denominator of    λ  1     subscript  λ  1    \lambda_{1}   (written in lowest terms).  If    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   , and provided   π   π   \pi   satisfies certain non-degeneracy conditions (namely there is no integer    0  <  k  <  n        0  k       n     0   such that     π   (   {  1  ,  …  ,  k  }   )    =   {  1  ,  …  ,  k  }         π   1  normal-…  k     1  normal-…  k     \pi(\{1,\dots,k\})=\{1,\dots,k\}   ), a deep theorem which was a conjecture of M.Keane and due independently to William A. Veech 2 and to Howard Masur  3 asserts that for almost all choices of   λ   λ   \lambda   in the unit simplex    {   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )   :    ∑   t  i    =  1   }     conditional-set    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n         subscript  t  i    1     \{(t_{1},\dots,t_{n}):\sum t_{i}=1\}   the interval exchange transformation    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is again uniquely ergodic . However, for    n  ≥  4      n  4    n\geq 4   there also exist choices of    (  π  ,  λ  )     π  λ    (\pi,\lambda)   so that    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is ergodic but not uniquely ergodic . Even in these cases, the number of ergodic invariant  measures of    T   π  ,  λ      subscript  T   π  λ     T_{\pi,\lambda}   is finite, and is at most   n   n   n   .
