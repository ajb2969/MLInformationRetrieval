   Acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase      Acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetylenedicarboxylate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetylenedicarboxylate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are pyruvate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetylenedicarboxylate carboxy-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include acetylenedicarboxylate hydratase , acetylenedicarboxylate hydrase , and acetylenedicarboxylate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism .
