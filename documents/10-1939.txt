Acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase

In enzymology, an acetylenedicarboxylate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetylenedicarboxylate + H2O 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetylenedicarboxylate and H2O, whereas its two products are pyruvate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetylenedicarboxylate carboxy-lyase (pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include acetylenedicarboxylate hydratase, acetylenedicarboxylate hydrase, and acetylenedicarboxylate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism.
