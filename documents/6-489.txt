   Sequence transformation      Sequence transformation   In mathematics , a sequence transformation is an operator acting on a given space of sequences (a sequence space ). Sequence transformations include linear mappings such as convolution with another sequence, and resummation of a sequence and, more generally, are commonly used for series acceleration , that is, for improving the rate of convergence of a slowly convergent sequence or series . Sequence transformations are also commonly used to compute the antilimit of a divergent series numerically, and are used in conjunction with extrapolation methods .  Overview  Classical examples for sequence transformations include the binomial transform , M√∂bius transform , Stirling transform and others.  Definitions  For a given sequence       S  =    {   s  n   }    n  ‚àà  ùí©     ,      S   subscript    subscript  s  n      n  ùí©      S=\{s_{n}\}_{n\in\mathcal{N}},\,     the transformed sequence is        ùêì   (  S  )    =   S  ‚Ä≤   =    {   s  n  ‚Ä≤   }    n  ‚àà  ùí©     ,          ùêì  S    superscript  S  normal-‚Ä≤         subscript    subscript   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   n      n  ùí©       \mathbf{T}(S)=S^{\prime}=\{s^{\prime}_{n}\}_{n\in\mathcal{N}},\,     where the members of the transformed sequence are usually computed from some finite number of members of the original sequence, i.e.       s  n  ‚Ä≤   =   T   (   s  n   ,   s   n  +  1    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   s   n  +  k    )         superscript   subscript  s  n   normal-‚Ä≤     T    subscript  s  n    subscript  s    n  1    normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  s    n  k        s_{n}^{\prime}=T(s_{n},s_{n+1},\dots,s_{n+k})     for some   k   k   k   which often depends on   n   n   n   (cf. e.g. Binomial transform ). In the simplest case, the    s  n     subscript  s  n    s_{n}   and the    s  n  ‚Ä≤     subscript   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   n    s^{\prime}_{n}   are real or complex numbers . More generally, they may be elements of some vector space or algebra .  In the context of acceleration of convergence, the transformed sequence is said to converge faster than the original sequence if        lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû       s  n  ‚Ä≤   -  ‚Ñì     s  n   -  ‚Ñì     =  0        subscript    normal-‚Üí  n          subscript   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   n   normal-‚Ñì      subscript  s  n   normal-‚Ñì     0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{s^{\prime}_{n}-\ell}{s_{n}-\ell}=0     where   ‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì   \ell   is the limit of   S   S   S   , assumed to be convergent. In this case, convergence acceleration is obtained. If the original sequence is divergent , the sequence transformation acts as extrapolation method to the antilimit   ‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì   \ell   .  If the mapping   T   T   T   is linear in each of its arguments, i.e., for       s  n  ‚Ä≤   =    ‚àë   m  =  0   k     c  m    s   n  +  m           subscript   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   n     superscript   subscript     m  0    k      subscript  c  m    subscript  s    n  m        s^{\prime}_{n}=\sum_{m=0}^{k}c_{m}s_{n+m}     for some constants     c  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   c  k       subscript  c  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  c  k     c_{0},\dots,c_{k}   (which may depend on n ), the sequence transformation   ùêì   ùêì   \mathbf{T}   is called a linear sequence transformation . Sequence transformations that are not linear are called nonlinear sequence transformations .  Examples  Simplest examples of (linear) sequence transformations include shifting all elements,     s  n  ‚Ä≤   =   s   n  +  k         subscript   superscript  s  normal-‚Ä≤   n    subscript  s    n  k      s^{\prime}_{n}=s_{n+k}   (resp. = 0 if n + k (-1,1,0,\ldots), and is a discrete analog of the derivative. The binomial transform is another linear transformation of a still more general type.  An example of a nonlinear sequence transformation is Aitken's delta-squared process , used to improve the rate of convergence of a slowly convergent sequence. An extended form of this is the Shanks transformation . The M√∂bius transform is also a nonlinear transformation, only possible for integer sequences .
