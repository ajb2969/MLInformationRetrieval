   Cutler's bar notation      Cutler's bar notation   In mathematics , Cutler's bar notation is a notation system for large numbers , introduced by Mark Cutler in 2004. The idea is based on iterated exponentiation in much the same way that exponentiation is iterated  multiplication .  Introduction  A regular exponential can be expressed as such:         a  b     =      a  ×  a  ×  …  ×  a   ⏟              b  copies of  a          superscript  a  b     normal-⏟    a  a  normal-…  a      absent  absent    b  copies of  a      \begin{matrix}a^{b}&=&\underbrace{a\times a\times\dots\times a}\\
 &&b\mbox{ copies of }a\end{matrix}     However, these expressions become arbitrarily large when dealing with systems such as Knuth's up-arrow notation . Take the following:             a   a     .   .   .  a        ⏟              b  copies of  a         absent   normal-⏟   superscript  a   superscript  a    superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.  a         absent    absent    b  copies of  a      \begin{matrix}&\underbrace{a^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^{a}}}}}}}&\\
 &b\mbox{ copies of }a\end{matrix}     Cutler's bar notation shifts these exponentials counterclockwise, forming     a  ¯     b     superscript   normal-¯  a   b    {{}^{b}}\bar{a}   . A bar is placed above the variable to denote this change. As such:           a  ¯     b   =        a   a     .   .   .  a        ⏟              b  copies of  a            superscript   normal-¯  a   b   absent    normal-⏟   superscript  a   superscript  a    superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.  a         absent    absent    b  copies of  a      \begin{matrix}{{}^{b}}\bar{a}=&\underbrace{a^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^{a}}}}}}}&%
 \\
 &b\mbox{ copies of }a\end{matrix}     This system becomes effective with multiple exponent, when regular denotation becomes too cumbersome.            b    b     a  ¯   =       a   a     .   .   .  a        ⏟                a  ¯     b   copies of  a          fragments    superscript  b  b     normal-¯  a      normal-⏟   superscript  a   superscript  a    superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.  a         absent    absent     superscript   normal-¯  a   b   copies of  a      \begin{matrix}^{{}^{b}{b}}\bar{a}=&\underbrace{a^{a^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^{a}}}}}%
 }}&\\
 &{{{}^{b}}\bar{a}}\mbox{ copies of }a\end{matrix}     At any time, this can be further shortened by rotating the exponential counter-clockwise once more.            b   b     .   .   .  b        ⏟    a  ¯    =    a  ¯    c          c  copies of  b              normal-⏟   superscript  b   superscript  b    superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.   superscript  normal-.  b          normal-¯  a     subscript   normal-¯  a   c        c  copies of  b      \begin{matrix}\underbrace{b^{b^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^{b}}}}}}}\bar{a}={{}_{c}}%
 \bar{a}\\
 c\mbox{ copies of }b\end{matrix}     The same pattern could be iterated a fourth time, becoming     a  ¯   d     subscript   normal-¯  a   d    \bar{a}_{d}   . For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as Cutler's circular notation .  Advantages and drawbacks  The Cutler Bar Notation can be used to easily express other notation systems in exponent form. It also allows for a flexible summarisation of multiple copies of the same exponents, where any number of stacked exponents can be shifted counter-clockwise and shortened to a single variable. The Bar Notation also allows for fairly rapid composure of very large numbers. For instance, the number     10  ¯   10     subscript   normal-¯  10   10    \bar{10}_{10}   would contain more than a googolplex digits, whilst remaining fairly simple to write with and remember.  However, the system reaches a problem when dealing with different exponents in a single expression. For instance, the expression      a   b   b  c         superscript  a   superscript  b   superscript  b  c       {}^{a^{b^{b^{c}}}}   could not be summarised in Bar notation. Additionally, the exponent can only be shifted thrice before it returns to its original position, making a five degree shift indistinguishable from a one degree shift. Some have suggested using a double and triple bar in subsequent rotations, though this presents problems when dealing with ten and twenty degree shifts.
