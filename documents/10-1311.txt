Oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (NADP+)

In enzymology, an oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-oxoglutarate + CoA + NADP+

 
  succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADPH
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2-oxoglutarate, CoA, and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are succinyl-CoA, CO2, and NADPH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-oxoglutarate:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase (CoA-succinylating). This enzyme is also called oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (NADP+).
