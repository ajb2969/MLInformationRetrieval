   Pentalenene synthase      Pentalenene synthase   In enzymology , a pentalenene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pentalenene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate , and two products , pentalenene and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, pentalenene-forming) . This enzyme is also called pentalenene synthetase .
