   Lusin's theorem      Lusin's theorem   In the mathematical field of real analysis , Lusin's theorem (or Luzin's theorem , named for Nikolai Luzin ) states that every measurable function is a continuous function on nearly all its domain. In the informal formulation of J. E. Littlewood , "every measurable function is nearly continuous".  Classical statement  For an interval [ a , b ], let      f  :    [  a  ,  b  ]   →  ℂ      normal-:  f   normal-→   a  b   ℂ     f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{C}     be a measurable function. Then, for every ε > 0, there exists a compact E ⊂ [ a , b ] such that f restricted to E is continuous and        μ   (  E  )    >   b  -  a  -  ε    .        μ  E     b  a  ε     \mu(E)>b-a-\varepsilon.\,     Note that E inherits the subspace topology from [ a , b ]; continuity of f restricted to E is defined using this topology.  General form  Let    (  X  ,  Σ  ,  μ  )     X  normal-Σ  μ    (X,\Sigma,\mu)   be a Radon measure space and Y be a second-countable topological space, let      f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\rightarrow Y     be a measurable function. Given ε > 0, for every    A  ∈  Σ      A  normal-Σ    A\in\Sigma   of finite measure there is a closed set E with ''µ(A \ E) f_\varepsilon: X \rightarrow Y with compact support that coincides with f on E .  Informally, measurable functions into spaces with countable base can be approximated by continuous functions on arbitrarily large portion of their domain.  References   N. Lusin.
