Lusin's theorem

In the mathematical field of real analysis, Lusin's theorem (or Luzin's theorem, named for Nikolai Luzin) states that every measurable function is a continuous function on nearly all its domain. In the informal formulation of J. E. Littlewood, "every measurable function is nearly continuous".
Classical statement
For an interval [a, b], let



be a measurable function. Then, for every ε > 0, there exists a compact E ⊂ [a, b] such that f restricted to E is continuous and



Note that E inherits the subspace topology from [a, b]; continuity of f restricted to E is defined using this topology.
General form
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Radon measure space and Y be a second-countable topological space, let



be a measurable function. Given ε > 0, for every 
 
 
 
  of finite measure there is a closed set E with ''µ(A \ E) f_\varepsilon: X \rightarrow Y with compact support that coincides with f on E.
Informally, measurable functions into spaces with countable base can be approximated by continuous functions on arbitrarily large portion of their domain.
