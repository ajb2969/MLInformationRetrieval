   Heteroclinic orbit      Heteroclinic orbit   (Figure)  The phase portrait of the pendulum equation x' ' + sin x = 0. The highlighted curve shows the heteroclinic orbit from ( x , x') = (−π, 0) to ( x , x') = (π, 0). This orbit corresponds with the (rigid) pendulum starting upright, making one revolution through its lowest position, and ending upright again.   In mathematics , in the phase portrait of a dynamical system , a heteroclinic orbit (sometimes called a heteroclinic connection ) is a path in phase space which joins two different equilibrium points . If the equilibrium points at the start and end of the orbit are the same, the orbit is a homoclinic orbit .  Consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE         x  ˙   =   f   (  x  )         normal-˙  x     f  x     \dot{x}=f(x)        Suppose there are equilibria at    x  =   x  0       x   subscript  x  0     x=x_{0}   and    x  =   x  1       x   subscript  x  1     x=x_{1}   , then a solution    ϕ   (  t  )       ϕ  t    \phi(t)   is a heteroclinic orbit from    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   to    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   if          ϕ   (  t  )    →    x  0   as     t  →   -  ∞       formulae-sequence   normal-→    ϕ  t     subscript  x  0   as     normal-→  t         \phi(t)\rightarrow x_{0}\quad\mathrm{as}\quad t\rightarrow-\infty        and          ϕ   (  t  )    →    x  1   as     t  →   +  ∞       formulae-sequence   normal-→    ϕ  t     subscript  x  1   as     normal-→  t         \phi(t)\rightarrow x_{1}\quad\mathrm{as}\quad t\rightarrow+\infty        This implies that the orbit is contained in the stable manifold of    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   and the unstable manifold of    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   .  Symbolic dynamics  By using the Markov partition , the long-time behaviour of hyperbolic system can be studied using the techniques of symbolic dynamics . In this case, a heteroclinic orbit has a particularly simple and clear representation. Suppose that    S  =   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  M  }       S   1  2  normal-…  M     S=\{1,2,\ldots,M\}   is a finite set of M symbols. The dynamics of a point x is then represented by a bi-infinite string of symbols      σ  =   {   (  …  ,   s   -  1    ,   s  0   ,   s  1   ,  …  )   :    s  k   ∈    S    ∀  k    ∈  ℤ   }       σ   conditional-set   normal-…   subscript  s    1     subscript  s  0    subscript  s  1   normal-…        subscript  s  k     S   for-all  k         ℤ       \sigma=\{(\ldots,s_{-1},s_{0},s_{1},\ldots):s_{k}\in S\;\forall k\in\mathbb{Z}\}     A periodic point of the system is simply a recurring sequence of letters. A heteroclinic orbit is then the joining of two distinct periodic orbits. It may be written as       p  ω    s  1    s  2   ⋯   s  n    q  ω        superscript  p  ω    subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-⋯   subscript  s  n    superscript  q  ω     p^{\omega}s_{1}s_{2}\cdots s_{n}q^{\omega}     where    p  =    t  1    t  2   ⋯   t  k        p     subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2   normal-⋯   subscript  t  k      p=t_{1}t_{2}\cdots t_{k}   is a sequence of symbols of length k , (of course,     t  i   ∈  S       subscript  t  i   S    t_{i}\in S   ), and    q  =    r  1    r  2   ⋯   r  m        q     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2   normal-⋯   subscript  r  m      q=r_{1}r_{2}\cdots r_{m}   is another sequence of symbols, of length m (likewise,     r  i   ∈  S       subscript  r  i   S    r_{i}\in S   ). The notation    p  ω     superscript  p  ω    p^{\omega}   simply denotes the repetition of p an infinite number of times. Thus, a heteroclinic orbit can be understood as the transition from one periodic orbit to another. By contrast, a homoclinic orbit can be written as       p  ω    s  1    s  2   ⋯   s  n    p  ω        superscript  p  ω    subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-⋯   subscript  s  n    superscript  p  ω     p^{\omega}s_{1}s_{2}\cdots s_{n}p^{\omega}     with the intermediate sequence     s  1    s  2   ⋯   s  n        subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-⋯   subscript  s  n     s_{1}s_{2}\cdots s_{n}   being non-empty, and, of course, not being p , as otherwise, the orbit would simply be    p  ω     superscript  p  ω    p^{\omega}   .
