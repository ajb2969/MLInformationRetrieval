Academic grading in China

In China, for most of the universities and colleges, and most of the high schools, the grading system1 is divided into five categories:

A: Excellent (85-100%, ; IPA: ")


A :90-100%
 
A-:85-89%
 


B: Good (75-84%, ; IPA: ")


B+:82-84%
 
B :78-81%
 
B-:75-77%
 


C: Average (64-74%, ; IPA: ")


C+:72-74%
 
C :68-71%
 
C-:64-67%
 


D: Pass (60-63%, ji-ge, "及格 /  / ")


F: Failure (0-59%, bu-ji-ge, "不及格 /  / ") 2

(some colleges may group the last two grades D and F into one grade called "Bottom", 0-64%, "下")
Besides the grading system and the 100 percentage based marks, there is another form of assessment based on which one course is marked simply as "Qualified/Failed" (“合格/不合格”). The "Qualified" here is different from "Pass", since "Qualified" doesn't indicate anything in ranking and doesn't have its corresponding percentage marks, though a few schools would translate "合格" into "Pass" automatically while an English transcript is required.
In Peking University, one of the top two universities in China, there is another grading system with a different formula.3
