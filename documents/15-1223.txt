Glycine/sarcosine N-methyltransferase

Glycine/sarcosine N-methyltransferase (, ApGSMT, glycine-sarcosine methyltransferase, GSMT, GMT, glycine sarcosine N-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:sarcosine N-methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:glycine(or sarcosine) N-methyltransferase (sarcosine(or N,N-dimethylglycine)-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + glycine

 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N,N-dimethylglycine (overall reaction)
 
(1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + glycine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + sarcosine

(1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + sarcosine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N,N-dimethylglycine
 

This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of betaine from glycine in cyanobacterium Aphanocthece halophytica.
