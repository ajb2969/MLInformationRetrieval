The Dagum distribution is a continuous probability distribution defined over positive real numbers. It is named after Camilo Dagum, who proposed it in a series of papers in the 1970s.12 The Dagum distribution arose from several variants of a new model on the size distribution of personal income and is mostly associated with the study of income distribution. There is both a three-parameter specification (Type I) and a four-parameter specification (Type II) of the Dagum distribution; a summary of the genesis of this distribution can be found in "A Guide to the Dagum Distributions".3 A general source on statistical size distributions often cited in work using the Dagum distribution is Statistical Size Distributions in Economics and Actuarial Sciences.4
Definition
The cumulative distribution function of the Dagum distribution (Type I) is given by


 
  for 
 
 
 
  and where 
 
 

The corresponding probability density function is given by



The Dagum distribution can be derived as a special case of the Generalized Beta II (GB2) distribution (a generalization of the Beta prime distribution). There is also an intimate relationship between the Dagum and Singh-Maddala distribution.



The cumulative distribution function of the Dagum (Type II) distribution adds a point mass at the origin and then follows a Dagum (Type I) distribution over the rest of the support (i.e. over the positive halfline)
