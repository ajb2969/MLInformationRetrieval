   Joule-second      Joule-second   The joule-second ( J s or J·s ) is a unit equal to a joule multiplied by a second , used to measure action or angular momentum . The joule-second is the unit used for Planck's constant .  In SI base units, the joule-second is        k  g   ⋅   m  2    s   =   J  ⋅  s    .         normal-⋅    k  g    superscript  m  2    s    normal-⋅  J  s     \frac{kg\cdot m^{2}}{s}=J\cdot s.     Action  The action of a system has the dimensions of energy integrated over time ; it is therefore measured in joule-seconds.  Angular momentum  The angular momentum of an object is the integral with respect to time of the torque on the object. Torque in the SI system has the unit N · m , so angular momentum has the unit N·m·s, or J·s.  "  Category:SI derived units
