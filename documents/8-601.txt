Magnitude condition

The magnitude condition is a constraint that is satisfied by the locus of points in the s-plane on which closed-loop poles of a system reside. In combination with the angle condition, these two mathematical expressions fully determine the root locus.
Let the characteristic equation of a system be 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Rewriting the equation in polar form is useful.



 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the only solutions to this equation. Rewriting 
 
 
 
  in factored form,


 
 ,
and representing each factor 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by their vector equivalents, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, 
 
 
 
  may be rewritten.



Simplifying the characteristic equation,


 
 ,
from which we derive the magnitude condition:


 
 .
The angle condition is derived similarly.
