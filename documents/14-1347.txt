   Radiant exposure      Radiant exposure   In radiometry , radiant exposure or radiant fluence is the radiant energy  received by a surface per unit area, or equivalently the irradiance of a surface integrated over time of irradiation, and spectral exposure or spectral fluence is the radiant exposure per unit frequency or wavelength , depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The SI unit of radiant exposure is the joule per square metre ( ), while that of spectral exposure in frequency is the joule per square metre per hertz ( ) and that of spectral exposure in wavelength is the joule per square metre per metre ( )—commonly the joule per square metre per nanometre ( ).  Mathematical definitions  Radiant exposure  Radiant exposure of a surface , denoted H e ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as 1        H  e   =    ∂   Q  e     ∂  A    =    ∫  0  T     E  e    (  t  )   d  t     ,         subscript  H  normal-e        subscript  Q  normal-e      A           superscript   subscript   0   T      subscript  E  normal-e   t  normal-d  t       H_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{\partial Q_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial A}=\int_{0}^{T}E_{%
 \mathrm{e}}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t,   where   ∂ is the partial derivative symbol;  Q e is the radiant energy;  A is the area;  T is the time of irradiation;  E e is the irradiance.   Spectral exposure  Spectral exposure in frequency of a surface , denoted H e,ν , is defined as 2        H   e  ,  ν    =    ∂   H  e     ∂  ν     ,       subscript  H   normal-e  ν         subscript  H  normal-e      ν      H_{\mathrm{e},\nu}=\frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial\nu},   where ν is the frequency.  Spectral exposure in wavelength of a surface , denoted H e,λ , is defined as 3        H   e  ,  λ    =    ∂   H  e     ∂  λ     ,       subscript  H   normal-e  λ         subscript  H  normal-e      λ      H_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}=\frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial\lambda},   where λ is the wavelength.
