   Kramers' opacity law      Kramers' opacity law   Kramers' opacity law describes the opacity of a medium in terms of the ambient density and temperature , assuming that the opacity is dominated by bound-free absorption (the absorption of light during ionization of a bound electron ) or free-free absorption (the absorption of light when scattering a free ion, also called bremsstrahlung ). 1 It is often used to model radiative transfer , particularly in stellar atmospheres . 2 The relation is named after the Dutch  physicist  Hendrik Kramers , who first derived the form in 1923. 3  The general functional form of the opacity law is        κ  ¯   ∝   ρ   T   -   7  /  2       ,     proportional-to   normal-¯  κ     ρ   superscript  T      7  2        \bar{\kappa}\propto\rho T^{-7/2},     where    κ  ¯     normal-¯  κ    \bar{\kappa}   is the resulting average opacity,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density and   T   T   T   the temperature of the medium. Often the overall opacity is inferred from observations, and this form of the relation describes how changes in the density or temperature will affect the opacity.  Calculation  The specific forms for bound-free and free-free are  Bound-free:       κ  ¯    b  f    =    4.34  ×   10  25      g   b  f    t   Z   (   1  +  X   )    ρ   g  /   cm  3        (   T  K   )    -   7  /  2        cm  2     g   -  1      ,       subscript   normal-¯  κ     b  f        4.34   superscript  10  25       subscript  g    b  f    t   Z    1  X     ρ    normal-g   superscript  cm  3      superscript    T  normal-K       7  2      superscript  cm  2    superscript  normal-g    1       \bar{\kappa}_{bf}=4.34\times 10^{25}\frac{g_{bf}}{t}Z(1+X)\frac{\rho}{\rm g/cm%

The   t   t   t   is an additional correction factor, typically having a value between 1 and 100. The opacity depends on the number density of electrons and ions in the medium, described by the fractional abundance (by mass) of elements heavier than hydrogen    Z   Z   Z   , and the fractional abundance (by mass) of hydrogen   X   X   X   . 4  References  Bibliography      "  Category:Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)     Phillips (1999), p. 92. ↩  Carroll (1996), p. 274–276. ↩  Carroll (1996), p. 274. ↩
