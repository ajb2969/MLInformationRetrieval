Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase




Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase

In enzymology, a cholesterol 25-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cholesterol + AH2 + O2

 
  25-hydroxycholesterol + A + H2O
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are cholesterol, an electron acceptor AH2, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), the reduction product A, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cholesterol, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (25-hydroxylating). This enzyme is also called cholesterol 25-monooxygenase.
Transcripts for this enzyme have been identified in macrophages from the testis.
CH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene, and its primary product 25HC may have broad-spectrum antiviral activity, demonstrated in mice against HIV, ebola, Nipah virus, and Rift Valley Fever virus.1 Specifically, it blocks membrane fusion between the cell and virus, and may "implicate membrane-modifying oxysterols as potential antiviral therapeutics."
