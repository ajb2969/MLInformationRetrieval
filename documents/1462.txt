   7 Arietis      7 Arietis   7 Arietis is the Flamsteed designation for a binary star 1 system in the northern constellation of Aries . The pair have a combined apparent visual magnitude of 5.76, 2 making it faintly visible to the naked eye from dark suburban skies. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 5.85 mas , 3 it is approximately  distant from the Earth, give or take a 40 light-year margin of error .  This is an eclipsing binary system with a period of 47.9 days and has the variable star designation RR Arietis. During each eclipse of the primary star, the magnitude of the system decreases by 0.40. The eclipse of the secondary reduces the magnitude by 0.35. 4 The primary component of the system is an evolved  giant star with a stellar classification of K1 III. 5 The measured angular diameter of this star is . 6 At the estimated distance of 7 Arietis, 7 this yields a physical size of about 21 times the radius of the Sun . 8  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 42\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 9  10  }}  External links   HR 559  [ http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=01+55+51.0397%2B23+34+38.358&ident; ;=V*+RR+Ari&submit;=Aladin+previewer Image 7 Arietis]   "  011763  008993  Arietis, 07  Arietis, RR  Category:Aries (constellation)  Category:K-type giants  Category:Eclipsing binaries             ↩  ↩
