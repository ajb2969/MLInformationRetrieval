Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem

In analytic number theory the Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem1 (or Bombieri–Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem) asserts that there are infinitely many prime numbers of the form 
 
 
 
 . The first few such primes are

2, 5, 17, 37, 41, 97, 101, 137, 181, 197, 241, 257, 277, 281, 337, 401, 457, 577, 617, 641, 661, 677, 757, 769, 821, 857, 881, 977, … .
 

The difficulty in this statement lies in the very sparse nature of this sequence: the number of integers of the form 
 
 
 
  less than 
 
 
 
  is roughly of the order 
 
 
 
 
 .
The theorem was proved in 1997 by John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec.2 It uses sieve techniques, in a form which extends Enrico Bombieri's asymptotic sieve. Bombieri–Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem is one of the two keys (the other is the 2005 work of Goldston-Pintz-Yıldırım3) to the "Bounded gaps between primes"4 of Yitang Zhang.5 Iwaniec was awarded the 2001 Ostrowski Prize in part for his contributions to this work.6
This result, however, does not imply that there are an infinite number of primes of form 
 
 
 
 , or

2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, 577, 677, 1297, 1601, 2917, 3137, 4357, 5477, 7057, 8101, 8837, 12101, 13457, 14401, 15377, … .
 

as the latter is still an unsolved problem (one of Landau's problems).
