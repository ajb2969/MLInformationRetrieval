Chlorogenate—glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase




Chlorogenate—glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase

In enzymology, a chlorogenate-glucarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

chlorogenate + glucarate 
 
 
 
  quinate + 2-O-caffeoylglucarate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chlorogenate and glucarate, whereas its two products are quinate and 2-O-caffeoylglucarate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorogenate:glucarate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase. Other names in common use include chlorogenate:glucarate caffeoyltransferase, chlorogenic acid:glucaric acid O-caffeoyltransferase, and chlorogenate:glucarate caffeoyltransferase.
