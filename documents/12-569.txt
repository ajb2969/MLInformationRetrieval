Covering code

In coding theory, a covering code is a set of elements (called codewords) in a space, with the property that every element of the space is within a fixed distance of some codeword.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be integers. A code

 
  over an alphabet Q of size |Q| = q is called q-ary R-covering code of length n if for every word 
 
 
 
  there is a codeword

 
  such that the Hamming distance

 
 . In other words, the spheres (or balls or rook-domains) of radius R with respect to the Hamming metric around the codewords of C have to exhaust the finite metric space

 
 . The covering radius of a code C is the smallest R such that C is R-covering. Every perfect code is a covering code of minimal size.
Example
C = {0134,0223,1402,1431,1444,2123,2234,3002,3310,4010,4341} is a 5-ary 2-covering code of length 4.1
Covering problem
The determination of the minimal size 
 
 
 
  of a q-ary R-covering code of length n is a very hard problem. In many cases, only lower and upper bounds are known with a large gap between them. Every construction of a covering code gives an upper bound on Kq(n, R). Lower bounds include the sphere covering bound and Rodemich’s bounds 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .2 The covering problem is closely related to the packing problem in 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the determination of the maximal size of a q-ary e-error correcting code of length n.
Football pools problem
A particular case is the football pools problem, based on football pool betting, where the aim is to predict the results of n football matches as a home win, draw or away win, or to at least predict  of them with multiple bets. Thus a ternary covering, K3(n,1), is sought.
If 
 
 
 
  then 3n-k are needed, so for n = 4, k = 2, 9 are needed; for n = 13, k = 3, 59049 are needed.3 The best bounds known as of 20114 are
