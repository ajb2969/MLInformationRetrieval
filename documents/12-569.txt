   Covering code      Covering code   In coding theory , a covering code is a set of elements (called codewords ) in a space, with the property that every element of the space is within a fixed distance of some codeword.  Definition  Let    q  ≥  2      q  2    q\geq 2   ,    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   ,    R  ≥  0      R  0    R\geq 0   be integers . A code     C  ⊆   Q  n       C   superscript  Q  n     C\subseteq Q^{n}   over an alphabet  Q of size | Q | = q is called q -ary R -covering code of length n if for every word    y  ∈   Q  n       y   superscript  Q  n     y\in Q^{n}   there is a codeword     x  ∈  C      x  C    x\in C   such that the Hamming distance       d  H    (  x  ,  y  )    ≤  R         subscript  d  H    x  y    R    d_{H}(x,y)\leq R   . In other words, the spheres (or balls or rook -domains) of radius  R with respect to the Hamming metric around the codewords of C have to exhaust the finite  metric space     Q  n     superscript  Q  n    Q^{n}   . The covering radius of a code C is the smallest R such that C is R -covering. Every perfect code is a covering code of minimal size.  Example  C = {0134,0223,1402,1431,1444,2123,2234,3002,3310,4010,4341} is a 5-ary 2-covering code of length 4. 1  Covering problem  The determination of the minimal size     K  q    (  n  ,  R  )        subscript  K  q    n  R     K_{q}(n,R)   of a q -ary R -covering code of length n is a very hard problem. In many cases, only lower and upper bounds are known with a large gap between them. Every construction of a covering code gives an upper bound on K q ( n , R ). Lower bounds include the sphere covering bound and Rodemich’s bounds      K  q    (  n  ,  1  )    ≥    q   n  -  1    /   (   n  -  1   )           subscript  K  q    n  1       superscript  q    n  1      n  1      K_{q}(n,1)\geq q^{n-1}/(n-1)   and      K  q    (  n  ,   n  -  2   )    ≥    q  2   /   (   n  -  1   )           subscript  K  q    n    n  2        superscript  q  2     n  1      K_{q}(n,n-2)\geq q^{2}/(n-1)   . 2 The covering problem is closely related to the packing problem in    Q  n     superscript  Q  n    Q^{n}   , i.e. the determination of the maximal size of a q -ary e - error correcting code of length n .  Football pools problem  A particular case is the football pools problem , based on football pool betting, where the aim is to predict the results of n football matches as a home win, draw or away win, or to at least predict  of them with multiple bets. Thus a ternary covering, K 3 ( n ,1), is sought.  If    n  =    1  2    (    3  k   -  1   )        n      1  2      superscript  3  k   1      n=\tfrac{1}{2}(3^{k}-1)   then 3 n - k are needed, so for n = 4, k = 2, 9 are needed; for n = 13, k = 3, 59049 are needed. 3 The best bounds known as of 2011 4 are      n   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14       K 3 ( n ,1)   1   3   5   9   27   71-73   156-186   402-486   1060-1269   2854-3645   7832-9477   21531-27702   59049   166610-177147     K 3 ( n ,2)    1   3   3   8   15-17   26-34   54-81   130-219   323-555   729   1919-2187   5062-6561   12204-19683     K 3 ( n ,3)     1   3   3   6   11-12   14-27   27-54   57-105   117-243   282-657   612-1215   1553-2187     Applications  The standard work 5 on covering codes lists the following applications.
