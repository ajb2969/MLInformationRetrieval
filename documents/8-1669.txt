Collision frequency




Collision frequency

Collision frequency is defined in chemical kinetics, in the background of theoretical kinetics, as the average number of collisions between reacting molecules per unit of time per moles of reactant. Its symbol is Z. For a gas-phase bimolecular reaction, Z is




NA is Avogadro's number
σAB is the reaction cross section
kB is Boltzmann constant
T is temperature in kelvin
μAB is the reduced mass of the reactants
