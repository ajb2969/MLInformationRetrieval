   Collision frequency      Collision frequency   Collision frequency is defined in chemical kinetics , in the background of theoretical kinetics , as the average number of collisions between reacting molecules per unit of time per moles of reactant. Its symbol is Z. For a gas-phase bimolecular reaction, Z is      Z  =    N  A    σ   A  B       8   k  B   T    π   μ   A  B            Z     subscript  N  A    subscript  σ    A  B          8   subscript  k  B   T     π   subscript  μ    A  B          Z=N_{A}\sigma_{AB}\sqrt{\frac{8k_{B}T}{\pi\mu_{AB}}}      N A is Avogadro's number  σ AB is the reaction cross section  k B is Boltzmann constant  T is temperature in kelvin  μ AB is the reduced mass of the reactants   References   IUPAC Goldbook definition of Collision Frequency   "  Category:Chemical kinetics
