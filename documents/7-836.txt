Gustavo Colonnetti

Gustavo Colonnetti (8 November 1886 – 20 March 1968) was an Italian mathematician and engineer who made important contributions to continuum mechanics and strength of materials. He was a Rector of the Politecnico di Torino and President of CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche). His theories found important applications in modern techniques of construction, such as pre-stressed concrete.1
He is remembered for Colonnetti's theorem (or Colonnetti's minimum principle) which states that in equilibrium the potential energy function 
 
 
 
  is minimized.
Life
Honors
He was nominated member of the Pontificial Academy of Sciences on October 28, 1936.2 In 1947, during the first meeting of the RILEM in Sorrento, he was elected first president of the society, and began its mandate in 1948.3 The same year, on the 27th of August 1947, he was elected corresponding member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei:4 nearly a year later, on the 15th of July 1948, he was elected full member.5
