Restricted sumset

In additive number theory and combinatorics, a restricted sumset has the form



where 
 
 
 
  are finite nonempty subsets of a field F and 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial over F.
When 
 
 
 
 , S is the usual sumset

 
  which is denoted by nA if 
 
 
 
 ; when


 
  which is denoted by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . Note that |S| > 0 if and only if there exist 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
Cauchy-Davenport theorem
The Cauchy–Davenport theorem named after Augustin Louis Cauchy and Harold Davenport asserts that for any prime p and nonempty subsets A and B of the prime order cyclic group Z/pZ we have the inequality12



We may use this to deduce the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem: given any 2n−1 elements of Z/n, there is a non-trivial subset that sums to zero modulo n. (Here n does not need to be prime.)34
A direct consequence of the Cauchy-Davenport theorem is: Given any set S of p−1 or more elements, not necessarily distinct, of Z/pZ, every element of Z/pZ can be written as the sum of the elements of some subset (possibly empty) of S.5
Kneser's theorem generalises this to finite abelian groups.6
Erdős-Heilbronn conjecture
The Erdős–Heilbronn conjecture posed by Paul Erdős and Hans Heilbronn in 1964 states that 
 
 
 
  if p is a prime and A is a nonempty subset of the field Z/pZ.7 This was first confirmed by J. A. Dias da Silva and Y. O. Hamidoune in 19948 who showed that



where A is a finite nonempty subset of a field F, and p(F) is a prime p if F is of characteristic p, and p(F) = ∞ if F is of characteristic 0. Various extensions of this result were given by Noga Alon, M. B. Nathanson and I. Ruzsa in 1996,9 Q. H. Hou and Zhi-Wei Sun in 2002,10 and G. Karolyi in 2004.11
Combinatorial Nullstellensatz
A powerful tool in the study of lower bounds for cardinalities of various restricted sumsets is the following fundamental principle: the combinatorial Nullstellensatz.12 Let 
 
 
 
  be a polynomial over a field F. Suppose that the coefficient of the monomial 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is nonzero and 
 
 
 
  is the total degree of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  are finite subsets of F with 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , then there are 
 
 
 
  such that $f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\not = 0$.
The method using the combinatorial Nullstellensatz is also called the polynomial method. This tool was rooted in a paper of N. Alon and M. Tarsi in 1989,13 and developed by Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa in 1995-1996,14 and reformulated by Alon in 1999.15
