   Niobium(IV) fluoride      Niobium(IV) fluoride   Niobium(IV) fluoride is a chemical compound with the formula NbF 4 ; it is a nonvolatile black solid . It absorbs vapor strongly. It turns into NbO 2 F in moist air. NbF 4 reacts with water to form a brown solution and a brown precipitate whose components are unknown. It is stable between 275 °C and 325 °C when heated in a vacuum. However, it disproportionates at 350 °C rapidly to form niobium(V) fluoride and niobium(III) fluoride :       2   NbF  4    →    NbF  5   +   NbF  3       normal-→    2   subscript  NbF  4       subscript  NbF  5    subscript  NbF  3      \mathrm{\ 2NbF_{4}\rightarrow NbF_{5}+NbF_{3}}   (at 350 °C) 1  References  "  Category:Niobium compounds  Category:Fluorides  Category:Metal halides     ↩
