   Tate module      Tate module   In mathematics , a Tate module of an abelian group, named for John Tate , is a module constructed from an abelian group  A . Often, this construction is made in the following situation: G is a commutative group scheme over a field  K , K s is the separable closure of K , and A = G ( K s ) (the K s -valued points of G ). In this case, the Tate module of A is equipped with an action of the absolute Galois group of K , and it is referred to as the Tate module of G .  Definition  Given an abelian group A and a prime number  p , the p -adic Tate module of A is        T  p    (  A  )    =    lim  ‚üµ   A   [   p  n   ]           subscript  T  p   A      normal-‚üµ    A   delimited-[]   superscript  p  n       T_{p}(A)=\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}A[p^{n}]     where A [ p n ] is the p n torsion of A (i.e. the kernel of the multiplication-by- p n map), and the inverse limit is over positive integers  n with transition morphisms given by the multiplication-by- p map A [''p n''+1 ] ‚Üí A [ p n ]. Thus, the Tate module encodes all the p -power torsion of A . It is equipped with the structure of a Z p -module via        z    (   a  n   )   n    =    (    (   z  mod   p  n    )    a  n    )   n    .        z   subscript   subscript  a  n   n     subscript      z  mod   superscript  p  n     subscript  a  n    n     z(a_{n})_{n}=((z\text{ mod }p^{n})a_{n})_{n}.     Examples  The Tate module  When the abelian group A is the group of roots of unity in a separable closure K s of K , the p -adic Tate module of A is sometimes referred to as the Tate module (where the choice of p and K are tacitly understood). It is a free rank one module over Z p with a linear action of the absolute Galois group G K of K . Thus, it is a Galois representation also referred to as the p -adic cyclotomic character of K . It can also be considered as the Tate module of the multiplicative group scheme  G m , K over K .  The Tate module of an abelian variety  Given an abelian variety  G over a field K , the K s -valued points of G are an abelian group. The p -adic Tate module T p ( G ) of G is a Galois representation (of the absolute Galois group, G K , of K ).  Classical results on abelian varieties show that if K has characteristic zero , or characteristic ‚Ñì where the prime number p ‚â† ‚Ñì, then T p ( G ) is a free module over Z p of rank 2 d , where d is the dimension of G . 1 In the other case, it is still free, but the rank may take any value from 0 to d (see for example Hasse‚ÄìWitt matrix ).  In the case where p is not equal to the characteristic of K , the p -adic Tate module of G is the dual of the √©tale cohomology      H  et  1    (   G   √ó  K    K  s    ,   ùêô  p   )        subscript   superscript  H  1   et      subscript   K   G   superscript  K  s     subscript  ùêô  p      H^{1}_{\text{et}}(G\times_{K}K^{s},\mathbf{Z}_{p})   .  A special case of the Tate conjecture can be phrased in terms of Tate modules. 2 Suppose K is finitely generated over its prime field (e.g. a finite field , an algebraic number field , a global function field ), of characteristic different from p , and A and B are two abelian varieties over K . The Tate conjecture then predicts that         Hom  K    (  A  ,  B  )    ‚äó   ùêô  p    ‚âÖ    Hom   G  K     (    T  p    (  A  )    ,    T  p    (  B  )    )         tensor-product     subscript  Hom  K    A  B     subscript  ùêô  p       subscript  Hom   subscript  G  K        subscript  T  p   A      subscript  T  p   B       \mathrm{Hom}_{K}(A,B)\otimes\mathbf{Z}_{p}\cong\mathrm{Hom}_{G_{K}}(T_{p}(A),T%
 _{p}(B))   where Hom K ( A , B ) is the group of morphisms of abelian varieties from A to B , and the right-hand side is the group of G K -linear maps from T p ( A ) to T p ( B ). The case where K is a finite field was proved by Tate himself in the 1960s. 3  Gerd Faltings proved the case where K is a number field in his celebrated "Mordell paper". 4  In the case of a Jacobian over a curve C over a finite field k of characteristic prime to p , the Tate module can be identified with the Galois group of the composite extension       k   (  C  )    ‚äÇ    k  ^    (  C  )    ‚äÇ   A   (  p  )            k  C      normal-^  k   C         superscript  A  p      k(C)\subset\hat{k}(C)\subset A^{(p)}   where    k  ^     normal-^  k    \hat{k}   is an extension of k containing all p -power roots of unity and A ( p ) is the maximal unramified abelian p -extension of     k  ^    (  C  )        normal-^  k   C    \hat{k}(C)   . 5  Tate module of a number field  The description of the Tate module for the function field of a curve over a finite field suggests a definition for a Tate module of an algebraic number field , the other class of global field , introduced by Iwasawa. For a number field K we let K m denote the extension by p m -power roots of unity,    K  ^     normal-^  K    \hat{K}   the union of the K m and A ( p ) the maximal unramified abelian p -extension of    K  ^     normal-^  K    \hat{K}   . Let         T  p    (  K  )    =   Gal   (    A   (  p  )    /   K  ^    )     .         subscript  T  p   K     Gal     superscript  A  p    normal-^  K       T_{p}(K)=\mathrm{Gal}(A^{(p)}/\hat{K})\ .   Then T p ( K ) is a pro- p -group and so a Z p -module. Using class field theory one can describe T p ( K ) as isomorphic to the inverse limit of the class groups C m of the K m under norm. 6  Iwasawa exhibited T p ( K ) as a module over the completion Z p [[ T ]] and this implies a formula for the exponent of p in the order of the class groups C m of the form        Œª  m   +   Œº   p  m    +   Œ∫    .        Œª  m     Œº   superscript  p  m    Œ∫    \lambda m+\mu p^{m}+\kappa\ .   The Ferrero‚ÄìWashington theorem states that Œº is zero. 7  See also   Tate conjecture  Tate twist   Notes  References      Section 13 of    "  Category:Abelian varieties     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©   ‚Ü©
