Orthogonal projections in A 10  Coxeter plane |} In ten-dimensional geometry , a rectified 10-orthoplex is a convex uniform 10-polytope , being a rectification of the regular 10-orthoplex .  There are 10 rectifications of the 10-orthoplex. Vertices of the rectified 10-orthoplex are located at the edge-centers of the 9-orthoplex. Vertices of the birectified 10-orthoplex are located in the triangular face centers of the 10-orthoplex. Vertices of the trirectified 10-orthoplex are located in the tetrahedral cell centers of the 10-orthoplex.  These polytopes are part of a family 1023 uniform 10-polytopes with BC 10 symmetry.

Rectified 10-orthoplex  The rectified 10-orthoplex is the vertex figure for the demidekeractic honeycomb .    or    Alternate names   rectified decacross (Acronym rake) (Jonathan Bowers) 1   Construction  There are two Coxeter groups associated with the rectified 10-orthoplex , one with the C 10 or [4,3 8 ] Coxeter group, and a lower symmetry with two copies of 9-orthoplex facets, alternating, with the D 10 or [3 7,1,1 ] Coxeter group.  Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a rectified 10-orthoplex, centered at the origin, edge length    2      2    \sqrt{2}   are all permutations of:   (±1,±1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)   Root vectors  Its 180 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group D 10 . The vertices can be seen in 3 hyperplanes , with the 45 vertices rectified 9-simplices facets on opposite sides, and 90 vertices of an expanded 9-simplex passing through the center. When combined with the 20 vertices of the 9-orthoplex, these vertices represent the 200 root vectors of the simple Lie group B 10 .
