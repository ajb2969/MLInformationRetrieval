   L-amino-acid alpha-ligase      L-amino-acid alpha-ligase   In enzymology , an L-amino-acid alpha-ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + an L-amino acid + an L-amino acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + L-aminoacyl-L-amino acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-amino acid , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and L-aminoacyl-L-amino acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-amino acid:L-amino acid ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include L-amino acid alpha-ligase , bacilysin synthetase , YwfE , and L-amino acid ligase .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
