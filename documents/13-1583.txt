   Index of a Lie algebra      Index of a Lie algebra   Let g be a Lie algebra over a field  K . Let further    ξ  ∈   𝔤  *       ξ   superscript  𝔤      \xi\in\mathfrak{g}^{*}   be a one-form on g . The stabilizer g ξ of ξ is the Lie subalgebra of elements of g that annihilate ξ in the coadjoint representation . The index of the Lie algebra is         ind   𝔤   :=    min   ξ  ∈   𝔤  *       dim    𝔤  ξ      .     assign    ind  𝔤     subscript     ξ   superscript  𝔤        dim   subscript  𝔤  ξ       \mathrm{ind}\,\mathfrak{g}:=\min\limits_{\xi\in\mathfrak{g}^{*}}\mathrm{dim}\,%
 \mathfrak{g}_{\xi}.     Examples  Reductive Lie algebras  If g is reductive then the index of g is also the rank of g , because the adjoint and coadjoint representation are isomorphic and rk g is the minimal dimension of a stabilizer of an element in g . This is actually the dimension of the stabilizer of any regular element in g .  Frobenius Lie algebra  If ind g =0, then g is called Frobenius Lie algebra . This is equivalent to the fact that the Kirillov form      K  ξ   :    𝔤  ⊗  𝔤   →  𝕂   :    (  X  ,  Y  )   ↦   ξ   (   [  X  ,  Y  ]   )          normal-:   subscript  K  ξ    normal-→   tensor-product  𝔤  𝔤   𝕂     normal-:     maps-to   X  Y     ξ   X  Y        K_{\xi}\colon\mathfrak{g\otimes g}\to\mathbb{K}:(X,Y)\mapsto\xi([X,Y])   is non-singular for some ξ in g * . Another equivalent condition when g is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group  G , is that g is Frobenius if and only if G has an open orbit in g * under the coadjoint representation.
