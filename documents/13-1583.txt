Index of a Lie algebra

Let g be a Lie algebra over a field K. Let further 
 
 
 
  be a one-form on g. The stabilizer g両 of 両 is the Lie subalgebra of elements of g that annihilate 両 in the coadjoint representation. The index of the Lie algebra is



Examples
Reductive Lie algebras
If g is reductive then the index of g is also the rank of g, because the adjoint and coadjoint representation are isomorphic and rk g is the minimal dimension of a stabilizer of an element in g. This is actually the dimension of the stabilizer of any regular element in g.
Frobenius Lie algebra
If ind g=0, then g is called Frobenius Lie algebra. This is equivalent to the fact that the Kirillov form

 
  is non-singular for some 両 in g*. Another equivalent condition when g is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group G, is that g is Frobenius if and only if G has an open orbit in g* under the coadjoint representation.
