   Hierarchical RBF      Hierarchical RBF   In computer graphics , a hierarchical RBF is an interpolation method based on Radial basis functions (RBF). Hierarchical RBF interpolation has applications in the construction of shape models in 3D computer graphics (see Stanford Bunny image below), treatment of results from a 3D scanner , terrain reconstruction and others.  (Figure)  MyBunny.gif   This problem informally named "large scattered data point set interpolation".  The idea of method (for example in 3D) consists of the following:   Let the scattered points be presented as set    𝐏  =   {   𝐜  i   =   (   𝐱  i   ,   𝐲  i   ,   𝐳  i   )    |   i  =  0   N   ⊂   ℝ  3   }      fragments  P    fragments  normal-{   subscript  𝐜  i     fragments  normal-(   subscript  𝐱  i   normal-,   subscript  𝐲  i   normal-,   subscript  𝐳  i   normal-)    subscript   superscript  normal-|  N     i  0      superscript  ℝ  3   normal-}     \mathbf{P}=\{\mathbf{c}_{i}=(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{y}_{i},\mathbf{z}_{i})|^{N%
 }_{i=0}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}\}     Let there exist a set of values of some function in scattered points    𝐇  =   {   𝐡  i    |   i  =  0   N   ⊂  ℝ  }      fragments  H    fragments  normal-{   subscript  𝐡  i    subscript   superscript  normal-|  N     i  0     R  normal-}     \mathbf{H}=\{\mathbf{h}_{i}|^{N}_{i=0}\subset\mathbb{R}\}     Find a function    𝐟   (  𝐱  )       𝐟  𝐱    \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})   which will meet the condition     𝐟   (  𝐱  )    =  1        𝐟  𝐱   1    \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=1   for points lying on the shape and     𝐟   (  𝐱  )    ≠  1        𝐟  𝐱   1    \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})\neq 1   for points not lying on the shape.  As J. C. Carr et al. showed 1 this function looks like     𝐟   (  𝐱  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   N     λ  i   φ   (  𝐱  ,   𝐜  i   )           𝐟  𝐱     superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  λ  i   φ   𝐱   subscript  𝐜  i        \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\varphi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{c}_%
 {i})   where:      φ   φ   \varphi   — it is RBF ;   λ   λ   \lambda   — it is coefficients which are the solution of the system show on picture:  (Figure)  System.gif   for determination of surface it is necessary to estimate the value of function    𝐟   (  𝐱  )       𝐟  𝐱    \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})   in interesting points x . A lack of such method is considerable complication 2     𝐎   (   𝐧  2   )       𝐎   superscript  𝐧  2     \mathbf{O}(\mathbf{n}^{2})   for calculate RBF , solve system and determine surface.

In this case hierarchical division of space containing points on elementary parts, the system of small dimension solves in each of which. The calculation of surface in this case is taken to the hierarchical (on the basis of tree-structure ) calculation of interpolant.
