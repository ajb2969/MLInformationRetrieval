   Bateman Equation      Bateman Equation   In nuclear physics , the Bateman equation is a mathematical model describing abundances and activities in a decay chain as a function of time, based on the decay rates and initial abundances. 1  If, at time t, there are     N  i    (  t  )        subscript  N  i   t    N_{i}(t)   atoms of isotope   i   i   i   that decays into isotope    i  +  1      i  1    i+1   at the rate    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   , the amounts of isotopes in the k-step decay chain evolves as:        d   N  1    (  t  )     d  t    =   -    λ  1    N  1    (  t  )             d   subscript  N  1   t     d  t         subscript  λ  1    subscript  N  1   t      \frac{dN_{1}(t)}{dt}=-\lambda_{1}N_{1}(t)           d   N  i    (  t  )     d  t    =    -    λ  i    N  i    (  t  )     +    λ   i  -  1     N   i  -  1     (  t  )             d   subscript  N  i   t     d  t           subscript  λ  i    subscript  N  i   t       subscript  λ    i  1     subscript  N    i  1    t      \frac{dN_{i}(t)}{dt}=-\lambda_{i}N_{i}(t)+\lambda_{i-1}N_{i-1}(t)           d   N  k    (  t  )     d  t    =    λ   k  -  1     N   k  -  1     (  t  )            d   subscript  N  k   t     d  t       subscript  λ    k  1     subscript  N    k  1    t     \frac{dN_{k}(t)}{dt}=\lambda_{k-1}N_{k-1}(t)   (this can be adapted to handle decay branches). While this can be solved explicitly for i=2, the formulas quickly become cumbersome for longer chains. 2  Bateman found a general explicit formula for the amounts by taking the Laplace transform of the variables.    N_n(t) = \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} \lambda_j \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i}^n     \left ( \frac{N_i(0)e^{-\lambda_j t}}{\prod_{p=i, p\neq j}^n (\lambda_p-\lambda_j)} \right ) (it can also be expanded with source terms, if more atoms of isotope i are provided externally at a constant rate). 3  While the Bateman formula can be implemented easily in computer code, if     λ  p   ≈   λ  j        subscript  λ  p    subscript  λ  j     \lambda_{p}\approx\lambda_{j}   for some isotope pair, cancellation can lead to computational errors. Therefore, other methods such as numerical integration or the matrix exponential method are also in use. 4  See also   Harry Bateman  List of equations in nuclear and particle physics  Transient equilibrium  Secular equilibrium   References  "  Category:Radioactivity     H.
