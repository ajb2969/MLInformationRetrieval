Bateman Equation

In nuclear physics, the Bateman equation is a mathematical model describing abundances and activities in a decay chain as a function of time, based on the decay rates and initial abundances.1
If, at time t, there are 
 
 
 
  atoms of isotope 
 
 
 
  that decays into isotope 
 
 
 
  at the rate 
 
 
 
 , the amounts of isotopes in the k-step decay chain evolves as:








 
  (this can be adapted to handle decay branches). While this can be solved explicitly for i=2, the formulas quickly become cumbersome for longer chains.2
Bateman found a general explicit formula for the amounts by taking the Laplace transform of the variables.






\left ( \frac{N_i(0)e^{-\lambda_j t}}{\prod_{p=i, p\neq j}^n (\lambda_p-\lambda_j)} \right ) (it can also be expanded with source terms, if more atoms of isotope i are provided externally at a constant rate).3
While the Bateman formula can be implemented easily in computer code, if 
 
 
 
  for some isotope pair, cancellation can lead to computational errors. Therefore, other methods such as numerical integration or the matrix exponential method are also in use.4
