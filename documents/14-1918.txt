   Web (differential geometry)      Web (differential geometry)   In mathematics , a web permits an intrinsic characterization in terms of Riemannian geometry of the additive separation of variables in the Hamilton–Jacobi equation . 1 2  Formal definition  An orthogonal  web on a Riemannian manifold  (M,g) is a set    𝒮  =   (   𝒮  1   ,  …  ,   𝒮  n   )       𝒮    superscript  𝒮  1   normal-…   superscript  𝒮  n      \mathcal{S}=(\mathcal{S}^{1},\dots,\mathcal{S}^{n})   of n pairwise transversal and orthogonal foliations of connected submanifolds of codimension 1 and where n denotes the dimension of M .  Note that two submanifolds of codimension 1 are orthogonal if their normal vectors are orthogonal and in a nondefinite metric orthogonality does not imply transversality.  Alternative definition  Given a smooth manifold of dimension n , an orthogonal  web (also called orthogonal grid or Ricci’s grid ) on a Riemannian manifold  (M,g) is a set 3     𝒞  =   (   𝒞  1   ,  …  ,   𝒞  n   )       𝒞    superscript  𝒞  1   normal-…   superscript  𝒞  n      \mathcal{C}=(\mathcal{C}^{1},\dots,\mathcal{C}^{n})   of n pairwise transversal and orthogonal foliations of connected submanifolds of dimension 1 .  Remark  Since vector fields can be visualized as stream-lines of a stationary flow or as Faraday’s lines of force, a non-vanishing vector field in space generates a space-filling system of lines through each point, known to mathematicians as a congruence (i.e., a local foliation ). Ricci ’s vision filled Riemann’s n -dimensional manifold with n congruences orthogonal to each other, i.e., a local orthogonal grid .  Differential geometry of webs  A systematic study of webs was started by Blashke in the 1930s. He extended the same group-theoretic approach to web geometry.  Classical definition  Let    M  =   X   n  r        M   superscript  X    n  r      M=X^{nr}   be a differentiable manifold of dimension N=nr . A d - web  W(d,n,r) of codimension  r in an open set    D  ⊂   X   n  r        D   superscript  X    n  r      D\subset X^{nr}   is a set of d foliations of codimension r which are in general position.  In the notation W(d,n,r) the number d is the number of foliations forming a web, r is the web codimension, and n is the ratio of the dimension nr of the manifold M and the web codimension. Of course, one may define a d - web of codimension r without having r as a divisor of the dimension of the ambient manifold.
