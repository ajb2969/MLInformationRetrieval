   Cyclotruncated simplectic honeycomb      Cyclotruncated simplectic honeycomb   In geometry , the cyclotruncated simplectic honeycomb (or cyclotruncated n-simplex honeycomb ) is a dimensional infinite series of honeycombs , based on the symmetry of the     A  ~   n     subscript   normal-~  A   n    {\tilde{A}}_{n}   affine Coxeter group . It is given a Schläfli symbol t 0,1 {3 [n+1] }, and is represented by a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram as a cyclic graph of n+1 nodes with two adjacent nodes ringed. It is composed of n- simplex facets, along with all truncated n-simplices.  It is also called a Kagome lattice in two and three dimensions, although it is not a lattice.  In n-dimensions, each can be seen as a set of n+1 sets of parallel hyperplanes that divide space. Each hyperplane contains the same honeycomb of one dimension lower.  In 1-dimension, the honeycomb represents an apeirogon , with alternately colored line segments . In 2-dimensions, the honeycomb represents the trihexagonal tiling , with Coxeter graph . In 3-dimensions it represents the quarter cubic honeycomb , with Coxeter graph  filling space with alternately tetrahedral and truncated tetrahedral cells. In 4-dimensions it is called a cyclotruncated 5-cell honeycomb , with Coxeter graph , with 5-cell , truncated 5-cell , and bitruncated 5-cell facets. In 5-dimensions it is called an cyclotruncated 5-simplex honeycomb , with Coxeter graph , filling space by 5-simplex , truncated 5-simplex , and bitruncated 5-simplex facets. In 6-dimensions it is called a cyclotruncated 6-simplex honeycomb , with Coxeter graph , filling space by 6-simplex , truncated 6-simplex , bitruncated 6-simplex , and tritruncated 6-simplex facets.
