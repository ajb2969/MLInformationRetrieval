Tyramine N-feruloyltransferase

In enzymology, a tyramine N-feruloyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

feruloyl-CoA + tyramine 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-feruloyltyramine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are feruloyl-CoA and tyramine, whereas its two products are CoA and N-feruloyltyramine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is feruloyl-CoA:tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase. Other names in common use include tyramine N-feruloyl-CoA transferase, feruloyltyramine synthase, feruloyl-CoA tyramine N-feruloyl-CoA transferase, and tyramine feruloyltransferase.
