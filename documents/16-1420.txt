BSTAR

BSTAR is a way of modeling aerodynamic drag on a satellite in the SGP4 satellite orbit propagation model.
Traditionally, aerodynamic resistance ("drag") is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the air density, 
 
 
 
  is the drag coefficient, 
 
 
 
 
  is the frontal area, and 
 
 
 
  is the velocity.
The acceleration due to drag is then



In aerodynamic theory, the factor



is called the ballistic coefficient, and its unit is area per mass. Further incorporating air density and the factor of two in the denominator, we get the starred ballistic coefficient:



thus reducing the expression for the acceleration due to drag to



As it can be seen, 
 
 
 
  has a unit of inverse length. For orbit propagation purposes, there is a field for BSTAR drag in Two-line element set (TLE) files, where it is to be given in units of inverse Earth radii.
