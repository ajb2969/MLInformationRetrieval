   BSTAR      BSTAR   BSTAR is a way of modeling aerodynamic drag on a satellite in the SGP4 satellite orbit propagation model.  Traditionally, aerodynamic resistance ("drag") is given by       F  D   =    1  2   ρ   C  d   A   v  2         subscript  F  D       1  2   ρ   subscript  C  d   A   superscript  v  2      F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}\rho C_{d}Av^{2}     where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the air density ,    C  d     subscript  C  d    C_{d}   is the drag coefficient ,   A   A   A   is the frontal area, and   v   v   v   is the velocity.  The acceleration due to drag is then       a  D   =    F  D   m   =    ρ   C  d   A   v  2     2  m           subscript  a  D      subscript  F  D   m            ρ   subscript  C  d   A   superscript  v  2      2  m       a_{D}=\frac{F_{D}}{m}=\frac{\rho C_{d}Av^{2}}{2m}     In aerodynamic theory, the factor      B  =     C  d   A   m       B       subscript  C  d   A   m     B=\frac{C_{d}A}{m}     is called the ballistic coefficient , and its unit is area per mass. Further incorporating air density and the factor of two in the denominator, we get the starred ballistic coefficient:       B  *   =    ρ  B   2   =    ρ   C  d   A    2  m           superscript  B        ρ  B   2            ρ   subscript  C  d   A     2  m       B^{*}=\frac{\rho B}{2}=\frac{\rho C_{d}A}{2m}     thus reducing the expression for the acceleration due to drag to       a  D   =    B  *    v  2         subscript  a  D      superscript  B     superscript  v  2      a_{D}=B^{*}v^{2}     As it can be seen,    B  *     superscript  B     B^{*}   has a unit of inverse length. For orbit propagation purposes, there is a field for BSTAR drag in Two-line element set (TLE) files, where it is to be given in units of inverse Earth radii.
