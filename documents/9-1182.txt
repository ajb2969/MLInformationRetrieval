   Karamata's inequality      Karamata's inequality   In mathematics , Karamata's inequality , 1 named after Jovan Karamata , 2 also known as the majorization inequality , is a theorem in elementary algebra for convex and concave real-valued functions, defined on an interval of the real line. It generalizes the discrete form of Jensen's inequality .  Statement of the inequality  Let   I   I   I   be an interval of the real line and let   f   f   f   denote a real-valued, convex function defined on   I   I   I   . If and are numbers in   I   I   I   such that  majorizes  , then   Here majorization means that   and, after relabeling the numbers and , respectively, in decreasing order, i.e.,   we have  If   f   f   f   is a strictly convex function , then the inequality () holds with equality if and only if, after relabeling according to (), we have  y i }} for all }.  Remarks   If the convex function   f   f   f   is non-decreasing , then the proof of () below and the discussion of equality in case of strict convexity shows that the equality () can be relaxed to     The inequality () is reversed if   f   f   f   is concave , since in this case the function    −  f      normal-−  f    −f   is convex.   Example  The finite form of Jensen's inequality is a special case of this result. Consider the real numbers and let      a  :=     x  1   +   x  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n    n      assign  a       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n    n     a:=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}     denote their arithmetic mean . Then majorizes the   n   n   n   -tuple    (  a  ,  a  ,  …  ,  a  )     a  a  normal-…  a    (a,a,...,a)   , since the arithmetic mean of the   i   i   i   largest numbers of is at least as large as the arithmetic mean   a   a   a   of all the   n   n   n   numbers, for every }. By Karamata's inequality () for the convex function   f   f   f   ,         f   (   x  1   )    +   f   (   x  2   )    +  ⋯  +   f   (   x  n   )     ≥    f   (  a  )    +   f   (  a  )    +  ⋯  +   f   (  a  )     =   n  f   (  a  )     .            f   subscript  x  1      f   subscript  x  2    normal-⋯    f   subscript  x  n         f  a     f  a   normal-⋯    f  a           n  f  a      f(x_{1})+f(x_{2})+\cdots+f(x_{n})\geq f(a)+f(a)+\cdots+f(a)=nf(a).     Dividing by   n   n   n   gives Jensen's inequality. The sign is reversed if   f   f   f   is concave.  Proof of the inequality  We may assume that the numbers are in decreasing order as specified in ().  If  y i }} for all }, then the inequality () holds with equality, hence we may assume in the following that for at least one   i   i   i   .  If  y i }} for an }, then the inequality () and the majorization properties (), () are not affected if we remove and . Hence we may assume that for all }.  It is a property of convex functions that for two numbers    x  ≠  y      x  normal-≠  y    x≠y   in the interval   I   I   I   the slope        f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )      x  -  y           f  x     f  y      x  y     \frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}     of the secant line through the points    (  x  ,   f   (  x  )    )     x    f  x     (x,f(x))   and    (  y  ,   f   (  y  )    )     y    f  y     (y,f(y))   of the graph of   f   f   f   is a monotonically non-decreasing function in   x   x   x   for   y   y   y   fixed (and vice versa ). This implies that  \le\frac{f(x_i)-f(y_i)}{x_i-y_i}=:c_i| 6 }}  for all }. Define  B 0 {{=}} 0}} and        A  i   =    x  1   +  ⋯  +   x  i     ,    B  i   =    y  1   +  ⋯  +   y  i        formulae-sequence     subscript  A  i      subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  i        subscript  B  i      subscript  y  1   normal-⋯   subscript  y  i       A_{i}=x_{1}+\cdots+x_{i},\qquad B_{i}=y_{1}+\cdots+y_{i}     for all }. By the majorization property (), for all } and by (),  B n }} . Hence,  _{=\,x_i}{} - (\underbrace{B_i - B_{i-1}}_{=\,y_i})\bigr)\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i (A_i - B_i) - \sum_{i=1}^n c_i (A_{i-1} - B_{i-1})\\ &=c_n (\underbrace{A_n-B_n}_{=\,0}) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(\underbrace{c_i - c_{i + 1}}_{\ge\,0})(\underbrace{A_i - B_i}_{\ge\,0}) - c_1(\underbrace{A_0-B_0}_{=\,0})\\ &\ge0, \end{align}| 7 }}  which proves Karamata's inequality ().  To discuss the case of equality in (), note that by () and our assumption for all }. Let   i   i   i   be the smallest index such that , which exists due to (). Then . If   f   f   f   is strictly convex, then there is strict inequality in (), meaning that . Hence there is a strictly positive term in the sum on the right hand side of () and equality in () cannot hold.  If the convex function   f   f   f   is non-decreasing, then . The relaxed condition () means that , which is enough to conclude that in the last step of ().  If the function   f   f   f   is strictly convex and non-decreasing, then . It only remains to discuss the case . However, then there is a strictly positive term on the right hand side of () and equality in () cannot hold.
