Karamata's inequality

In mathematics, Karamata's inequality,1 named after Jovan Karamata,2 also known as the majorization inequality, is a theorem in elementary algebra for convex and concave real-valued functions, defined on an interval of the real line. It generalizes the discrete form of Jensen's inequality.
Statement of the inequality
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be an interval of the real line and let 
 
 
 
  denote a real-valued, convex function defined on 
 
 
 
 . If  and  are numbers in 
 
 
 
  such that  majorizes , then

Here majorization means that

and, after relabeling the numbers  and , respectively, in decreasing order, i.e.,

we have
If 
 
 
 
   is a strictly convex function, then the inequality () holds with equality if and only if, after relabeling according to (), we have  yi}} for all }.
Remarks

If the convex function 
 
 
 
 
   is non-decreasing, then the proof of () below and the discussion of equality in case of strict convexity shows that the equality () can be relaxed to



The inequality () is reversed if 
 
 
 
   is concave, since in this case the function 
 
 
 
   is convex.

Example
The finite form of Jensen's inequality is a special case of this result. Consider the real numbers  and let



denote their arithmetic mean. Then  majorizes the 
 
 
 
 -tuple 
 
 
 
 
 , since the arithmetic mean of the 
 
 
 
  largest numbers of  is at least as large as the arithmetic mean 
 
 
 
  of all the 
 
 
 
  numbers, for every }. By Karamata's inequality () for the convex function 
 
 
 
 ,



Dividing by 
 
 
 
  gives Jensen's inequality. The sign is reversed if 
 
 
 
   is concave.
Proof of the inequality
We may assume that the numbers are in decreasing order as specified in ().
If  yi}} for all }, then the inequality () holds with equality, hence we may assume in the following that  for at least one 
 
 
 
 .
If  yi}} for an }, then the inequality () and the majorization properties (), () are not affected if we remove  and . Hence we may assume that  for all }.
It is a property of convex functions that for two numbers 
 
 
 
  in the interval 
 
 
 
 
  the slope



of the secant line through the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of the graph of 
 
 
 
   is a monotonically non-decreasing function in 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  fixed (and vice versa). This implies that
\le\frac{f(x_i)-f(y_i)}{x_i-y_i}=:c_i|6}}
for all }. Define  B0 {{=}} 0}} and



for all }. By the majorization property (),  for all } and by (),  Bn}}. Hence,
_{=\,x_i}{} - (\underbrace{B_i - B_{i-1}}_{=\,y_i})\bigr)\\ &=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i (A_i - B_i) - \sum_{i=1}^n c_i (A_{i-1} - B_{i-1})\\ &=c_n (\underbrace{A_n-B_n}_{=\,0}) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(\underbrace{c_i - c_{i + 1}}_{\ge\,0})(\underbrace{A_i - B_i}_{\ge\,0}) - c_1(\underbrace{A_0-B_0}_{=\,0})\\ &\ge0, \end{align}|7}}
which proves Karamata's inequality ().
To discuss the case of equality in (), note that  by () and our assumption  for all }. Let 
 
 
 
  be the smallest index such that , which exists due to (). Then . If 
 
 
 
   is strictly convex, then there is strict inequality in (), meaning that . Hence there is a strictly positive term in the sum on the right hand side of () and equality in () cannot hold.
If the convex function 
 
 
 
 
   is non-decreasing, then . The relaxed condition () means that , which is enough to conclude that  in the last step of ().
If the function 
 
 
 
   is strictly convex and non-decreasing, then . It only remains to discuss the case . However, then there is a strictly positive term on the right hand side of () and equality in () cannot hold.
