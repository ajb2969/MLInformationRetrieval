   Arginine racemase      Arginine racemase   In enzymology , an arginine racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-arginine   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L- arginine , and one product , D- arginine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is arginine racemase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : lysine degradation , D- glutamine and D- glutamate metabolism, and D- arginine and D- ornithine metabolism. It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 5.1.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
