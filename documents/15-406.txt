Küpfmüller's uncertainty principle

Küpfmüller's uncertainty principle states that the relation of the rise time of a bandlimited signal to its bandwidth is a constant.

Proof
A bandlimited signal 
 
 
 
  with fourier transform

 
  in frequency space is given by the multiplication of any signal 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  with a rectangular function of width 
 
 


as (applying the convolution theorem)



Since the fourier transform of a rectangular function is a sinc function and vice versa, follows



Now the first root of 
 
 
 
  is at 
 
 
 
 , which is the rise time 
 
 
 
  of the pulse

 
 , now follows



Equality is given as long as 
 
 
 
  is finite.
Regarding that a real signal has both positive and negative frequencies of the same frequency band, 
 
 
 
  becomes 
 
 
 
 , which leads to 
 
 
 
  instead of
