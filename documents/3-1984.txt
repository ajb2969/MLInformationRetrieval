Proper convex function

In mathematical analysis (in particular convex analysis) and optimization, a proper convex function is a convex function f taking values in the extended real number line such that



for at least one x and



for every x. That is, a convex function is proper if its effective domain is nonempty and it never attains 
 
 
 
 .1 Convex functions that are not proper are called improper convex functions.2
A proper concave function is any function g such that 
 
 
 
 
  is a proper convex function.
Properties
For every proper convex function f on Rn there exist some b in Rn and Î² in R such that



for every x.
The sum of two proper convex functions is not necessarily proper or convex. For instance if the sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are non-empty convex sets in the vector space X, then the indicator functions

 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are proper convex functions, but if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is identically equal to 
 
 
 
 .
The infimal convolution of two proper convex functions is convex but not necessarily proper convex.3
