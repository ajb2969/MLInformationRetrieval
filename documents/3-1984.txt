   Proper convex function      Proper convex function   In mathematical analysis (in particular convex analysis ) and optimization , a proper convex function is a convex function  f taking values in the extended real number line such that       f   (  x  )    <   +  ∞         f  x         f(x)<+\infty     for at least one x and       f   (  x  )    >   -  ∞         f  x         f(x)>-\infty     for every x . That is, a convex function is proper if its effective domain is nonempty and it never attains    -  ∞         -\infty   . 1 Convex functions that are not proper are called improper convex functions . 2  A proper concave function is any function g such that    f  =   -  g       f    g     f=-g   is a proper convex function.  Properties  For every proper convex function f on R n there exist some b in R n and β in R such that       f   (  x  )    ≥    x  ⋅  b   -  β         f  x      normal-⋅  x  b   β     f(x)\geq x\cdot b-\beta     for every x .  The sum of two proper convex functions is not necessarily proper or convex. For instance if the sets    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   and    B  ⊂  X      B  X    B\subset X   are non-empty convex sets in the vector space  X , then the indicator functions     I  A     subscript  I  A    I_{A}   and    I  B     subscript  I  B    I_{B}   are proper convex functions, but if     A  ∩  B   =  ∅        A  B      A\cap B=\emptyset   then     I  A   +   I  B        subscript  I  A    subscript  I  B     I_{A}+I_{B}   is identically equal to    +  ∞         +\infty   .  The infimal convolution of two proper convex functions is convex but not necessarily proper convex. 3  References  "  Category:Convex analysis  Category:Types of functions     ↩  ↩  . ↩
