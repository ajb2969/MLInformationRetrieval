   Four-momentum      Four-momentum   In special relativity , four-momentum is the generalization of the classical three-dimensional momentum to four-dimensional spacetime . Momentum is a vector in three dimensions; similarly four-momentum is a four-vector in spacetime . The contravariant four-momentum of a particle with energy   E   E   E   and three-momentum , where   ùêØ   ùêØ   \mathbf{v}   is the particles  and   Œ≥   Œ≥   Œ≥   the Lorentz factor , is       p  =   (   p  0   ,   p  1   ,   p  2   ,   p  3   )   =   (   E  c   ,   p  x   ,   p  y   ,   p  z   )    .        p    superscript  p  0    superscript  p  1    superscript  p  2    superscript  p  3            E  c    subscript  p  x    subscript  p  y    subscript  p  z       p=(p^{0},p^{1},p^{2},p^{3})=\left({E\over c},p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\right).     The quantity    m  ùêØ      m  ùêØ    m\mathbf{v}   of above is ordinary non-relativistic momentum of the particle and   m   m   m   its rest mass . The four-momentum is useful in relativistic calculations because it is a Lorentz vector. This means that it is easy to keep track of how it transforms under Lorentz transformations .  The above definition applies under the coordinate convention that . Some authors use the convention , which yields a modified definition with . It is also possible to define covariant four-momentum where the sign of the energy is reversed.  Minkowski norm  Calculating the Minkowski norm of the four-momentum gives a Lorentz invariant quantity equal (up to factors of the speed of light    c   c   c   ) to the square of the particle's proper mass :       p  ‚ãÖ  p   =    p  Œº    p  Œº    =    Œ∑   Œº  ŒΩ     p  Œº    p  ŒΩ    =    -    E  2    c  2     +    |  ùê©  |   2    =   -    m  2    c  2            normal-‚ãÖ  p  p      superscript  p  Œº    subscript  p  Œº            subscript  Œ∑    Œº  ŒΩ     superscript  p  Œº    superscript  p  ŒΩ                superscript  E  2    superscript  c  2      superscript    ùê©   2              superscript  m  2    superscript  c  2        p\cdot p=p^{\mu}p_{\mu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}p^{\mu}p^{\nu}=-{E^{2}\over c^{2}}+|%
 \mathbf{p}|^{2}=-m^{2}c^{2}     where we use the convention that       Œ∑   Œº  ŒΩ    =   [      -  1     0    0    0      0    1    0    0      0    0    1    0      0    0    0    1     ]        subscript  Œ∑    Œº  ŒΩ     delimited-[]      1   0  0  0    0  1  0  0    0  0  1  0    0  0  0  1       \eta_{\mu\nu}=\left[\begin{smallmatrix}-1&0&0&0\\

 0&0&0&1\end{smallmatrix}\right]     is the metric tensor of special relativity . The fact that the norm is negative reflects that the momentum is a timelike for massive particles.  The Minkowski norm is Lorentz invariant, meaning its value is not changed by Lorentz transformations/boosting into different frames of reference. More generally, for any two   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   , the quantity    p  ‚ãÖ  q      p  normal-‚ãÖ  q    p‚ãÖq   is invariant.  Relation to four-velocity  For a massive particle, the four-momentum is given by the particle's invariant mass  m multiplied by the particle's four-velocity ,        p  Œº   =   m   u  Œº     ,       superscript  p  Œº     m   superscript  u  Œº      p^{\mu}=mu^{\mu},     where the four-velocity   u   u   u   is       u  =   (   u  0   ,   u  1   ,   u  2   ,   u  3   )   =   Œ≥   (  c  ,   v  x   ,   v  y   ,   v  z   )     ,        u    superscript  u  0    superscript  u  1    superscript  u  2    superscript  u  3           Œ≥   c   subscript  v  x    subscript  v  y    subscript  v  z        u=(u^{0},u^{1},u^{2},u^{3})=\gamma(c,v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}),     and      Œ≥  =   1    1  -    (   v  /  c   )   2          Œ≥    1      1   superscript    v  c   2        \gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(v/c\right)^{2}}}     is the Lorentz factor,   c   c   c   is the speed of light .  Conservation of four-momentum  The conservation of the four-momentum yields two conservation laws for "classical" quantities:   The total energy  is conserved.  The classical three- momentum  p is conserved.   Note that the invariant mass of a system of particles may be more than the sum of the particles' rest masses, since kinetic energy in the system center-of-mass frame and potential energy from forces between the particles contribute to the invariant mass. As an example, two particles with four-momenta  and  each have (rest) mass 3 GeV/ c 2 separately, but their total mass (the system mass) is 10 GeV/ c 2 . If these particles were to collide and stick, the mass of the composite object would be 10 GeV/ c 2 .  One practical application from particle physics of the conservation of the invariant mass involves combining the four-momenta and of two daughter particles produced in the decay of a heavier particle with four-momentum to find the mass of the heavier particle. Conservation of four-momentum gives , while the mass   M   M   M   of the heavier particle is given by . By measuring the energies and three-momenta of the daughter particles, one can reconstruct the invariant mass of the two-particle system, which must be equal to   M   M   M   . This technique is used, e.g., in experimental searches for Z‚Ä≤ bosons at high-energy particle colliders , where the Z‚Ä≤ boson would show up as a bump in the invariant mass spectrum of electron ‚Äì positron or muon ‚Äìantimuon pairs.  If the mass of an object does not change, the Minkowski inner product of its four-momentum and corresponding four-acceleration  is simply zero. The four-acceleration is proportional to the proper time derivative of the four-momentum divided by the particle's mass, so        p  Œº    A  Œº    =    Œ∑   Œº  ŒΩ     p  Œº    A  ŒΩ    =    Œ∑   Œº  ŒΩ     p  Œº    d   d  œÑ      p  ŒΩ   m    =     1   2  m     d   d  œÑ    p   ‚ãÖ  p   =    1   2  m     d   d  œÑ     (   -    m  2    c  2     )    =  0.           superscript  p  Œº    subscript  A  Œº       subscript  Œ∑    Œº  ŒΩ     superscript  p  Œº    superscript  A  ŒΩ            subscript  Œ∑    Œº  ŒΩ     superscript  p  Œº     d    d  œÑ       superscript  p  ŒΩ   m          normal-‚ãÖ      1    2  m      d    d  œÑ    p   p            1    2  m      d    d  œÑ         superscript  m  2    superscript  c  2           0.     p^{\mu}A_{\mu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}p^{\mu}A^{\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}p^{\mu}\frac{d}{d\tau}%

Canonical momentum in the presence of an electromagnetic potential  For a charged particle of charge    q   q   q   , moving in an electromagnetic field given by the electromagnetic four-potential :      A  =   (   A  0   ,   A  1   ,   A  2   ,   A  3   )   =   (   œï  c   ,   A  x   ,   A  y   ,   A  z   )         A    superscript  A  0    superscript  A  1    superscript  A  2    superscript  A  3            œï  c    subscript  A  x    subscript  A  y    subscript  A  z       A=(A^{0},A^{1},A^{2},A^{3})=\left({\phi\over c},A_{x},A_{y},A_{z}\right)     where   Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   Œ¶   is the scalar potential and the vector potential , the components of the canonical momentum four-vector   P   P   P   is        P  Œº   =    p  Œº   +   q   A  Œº      .       superscript  P  Œº      superscript  p  Œº     q   superscript  A  Œº       P^{\mu}=p^{\mu}+qA^{\mu}.\!     This, in turn, allows the potential energy from the charged particle in an electrostatic potential and the Lorentz force on the charged particle moving in a magnetic field to be incorporated in a compact way, in relativistic quantum mechanics .
