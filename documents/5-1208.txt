   Cyclic number      Cyclic number   A cyclic number is an integer in which cyclic permutations of the digits are successive multiples of the number. The most widely known is 142857 :   142857 × 1 = 142857  142857 × 2 = 285714  142857 × 3 = 428571  142857 × 4 = 571428  142857 × 5 = 714285  142857 × 6 = 857142   Details  To qualify as a cyclic number, it is required that successive multiples be cyclic permutations. Thus, the number 076923 would not be considered a cyclic number, because even though all cyclic permutations are multiples, they are not successive multiples:   076923 × 1 = 076923  076923 × 3 = 230769  076923 × 4 = 307692  076923 × 9 = 692307  076923 × 10 = 769230  076923 × 12 = 923076   The following trivial cases are typically excluded:   single digits, e.g.: 5  repeated digits, e.g.: 555  repeated cyclic numbers, e.g.: 142857142857   If leading zeros are not permitted on numerals, then 142857 is the only cyclic number in decimal , due to the necessary structure given in the next section. Allowing leading zeros, the sequence of cyclic numbers begins:   (10 6 -1) / 7 = 142857 (6 digits)  (10 16 -1) / 17 = 0588235294117647 (16 digits)  (10 18 -1) / 19 = 052631578947368421 (18 digits)  (10 22 -1) / 23 = 0434782608695652173913 (22 digits)  (10 28 -1) / 29 = 0344827586206896551724137931 (28 digits)  (10 46 -1) / 47 = 0212765957446808510638297872340425531914893617 (46 digits)  (10 58 -1) / 59 = 0169491525423728813559322033898305084745762711864406779661 (58 digits)  (10 60 -1) / 61 = 016393442622950819672131147540983606557377049180327868852459 (60 digits)   Relation to repeating decimals  Cyclic numbers are related to the recurring digital representations of unit fractions . A cyclic number of length L is the digital representation of   1/( L + 1).   Conversely, if the digital period of 1 / p (where p is prime) is   p − 1,   then the digits represent a cyclic number.  For example:   1/7 = 0.142857 142857….   Multiples of these fractions exhibit cyclic permutation:   1/7 = 0.142857 142857…  2/7 = 0.285714 285714…  3/7 = 0.428571 428571…  4/7 = 0.571428 571428…  5/7 = 0.714285 714285…  6/7 = 0.857142 857142….   Form of cyclic numbers  From the relation to unit fractions, it can be shown that cyclic numbers are of the form        b   p  -  1    -  1   p         superscript  b    p  1    1   p    \frac{b^{p-1}-1}{p}     where b is the number base (10 for decimal ), and p is a prime that does not divide  b . (Primes p that give cyclic numbers in base b are called full reptend primes or long primes in base b ).  For example, the case b = 10, p = 7 gives the cyclic number 142857, and the case b = 12, p = 5 gives the cyclic number 2497.  Not all values of p will yield a cyclic number using this formula; for example, the case b = 10, p = 13 gives 076923076923, and the case b = 12, p = 19 gives 076Ɛ45076Ɛ45076Ɛ45. These failed cases will always contain a repetition of digits (possibly several).  The first values of p for which this formula produces cyclic numbers in decimal ( b = 10) are   7, 17, 19, 23, 29, 47, 59, 61, 97, 109, 113, 131, 149, 167, 179, 181, 193, 223, 229, 233, 257, 263, 269, 313, 337, 367, 379, 383, 389, 419, 433, 461, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 541, 571, 577, 593, 619, 647, 659, 701, 709, 727, 743, 811, 821, 823, 857, 863, 887, 937, 941, 953, 971, 977, 983, …   For b = 12 ( duodecimal ), these p s are   5, 7, 17, 31, 41, 43, 53, 67, 101, 103, 113, 127, 137, 139, 149, 151, 163, 173, 197, 223, 257, 269, 281, 283, 293, 317, 353, 367, 379, 389, 401, 449, 461, 509, 523, 547, 557, 569, 571, 593, 607, 617, 619, 631, 641, 653, 691, 701, 739, 751, 761, 773, 787, 797, 809, 821, 857, 881, 929, 953, 967, 977, 991, ...   For b = 2 ( binary ), these p s are   3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, 37, 53, 59, 61, 67, 83, 101, 107, 131, 139, 149, 163, 173, 179, 181, 197, 211, 227, 269, 293, 317, 347, 349, 373, 379, 389, 419, 421, 443, 461, 467, 491, 509, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 587, 613, 619, 653, 659, 661, 677, 701, 709, 757, 773, 787, 797, 821, 827, 829, 853, 859, 877, 883, 907, 941, 947, ...   For b = 3 ( ternary ), these p s are   2, 5, 7, 17, 19, 29, 31, 43, 53, 79, 89, 101, 113, 127, 137, 139, 149, 163, 173, 197, 199, 211, 223, 233, 257, 269, 281, 283, 293, 317, 331, 353, 379, 389, 401, 449, 461, 463, 487, 509, 521, 557, 569, 571, 593, 607, 617, 631, 641, 653, 677, 691, 701, 739, 751, 773, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 857, 859, 881, 907, 929, 941, 953, 977, ...   There are no such p s in the hexadecimal system.  The known pattern to this sequence comes from algebraic number theory , specifically, this sequence is the set of primes p such that b is a primitive root modulo p . A conjecture of Emil Artin  1 is that this sequence contains 37.395..% of the primes (for b in ).  Construction of cyclic numbers  Cyclic numbers can be constructed by the following procedure :  Let b be the number base (10 for decimal) Let p be a prime that does not divide b . Let t = 0. Let r = 1. Let n = 0. loop:   Let t = t + 1  Let x = r · b   Let d = int ( x / p )  Let r = x  mod  p   Let n = n · b + d   If r ≠ 1 then repeat the loop.   if t = p − 1 then n is a cyclic number.  This procedure works by computing the digits of 1 / p in base b , by long division . r is the remainder at each step, and d is the digit produced.  The step   n = n · b + d    serves simply to collect the digits. For computers not capable of expressing very large integers, the digits may be output or collected in another way.  Note that if t ever exceeds p /2, then the number must be cyclic, without the need to compute the remaining digits.  Properties of cyclic numbers   When multiplied by their generating prime, results in a sequence of {{'}} base −1' digits (9 in decimal). Decimal 142857 × 7 = 999999.  When split in two,three four etc...regarding base 10,100,1000 etc.. by its digits and added the result is a sequence of 9's. 14 + 28 + 57 = 99 , 142 + 857 = 999 , 1428 + 5714+ 2857 = 9999 etc. ... (This is a special case of Midy's Theorem .)  All cyclic numbers are divisible by {{'}} base −1' (9 in decimal) and the sum of the remainder is the a multiple of the divisor. (This follows from the previous point.)   Other numeric bases  Using the above technique, cyclic numbers can be found in other numeric bases. (Note that not all of these follow the second rule (all successive multiples being cyclic permutations) listed in the Special Cases section above) In each of these cases the digits across half the period add up to the base minus one. Thus for binary the sum of the bits across half the period is 1; for ternary it is 2, and so on.  In binary , the sequence of cyclic numbers begins:   11 (3) → 01  101 (5) → 0011  1011 (11) → 0001011101  1101 (13) → 000100111011  10011 (19) → 000011010111100101   In ternary :   12 (5) → 0121  21 (7) → 010212  122 (17) → 0011202122110201  201 (19) → 001102100221120122  1002 (29) → 0002210102011122200121202111   In quaternary :   none   In quinary :   3 (3) → 13  12 (7) → 032412  32 (17) → 0121340243231042  122 (37) → 003142122040113342441302322404331102  133 (43) → 002423141223434043111442021303221010401333   In senary :   15 (11) → 0313452421  21 (13) → 024340531215  25 (17) → 0204122453514331  31 (19) → 015211325015211325  105 (41) → 0051335412440330234455042201431152253211   In septenary :   5 (5) → 1254  14 (11) → 0431162355  16 (13) → 035245631421  23 (17) → 0261143464055232  32 (23) → 0206251134364604155323   In octal :   3 (3) → 25  5 (5) → 1463  13 (11) → 0564272135  35 (29) → 0215173454106475626043236713  65 (53) → 0115220717545336140465103476625570602324416373126743   In nonary :   none   In Base 11 :   3 (3) → 37  12 (13) → 093425A17685  16 (17) → 07132651A3978459  21 (23) → 05296243390A581486771A  27 (29) → 04199534608387A69115764A2723   In duodecimal :   5 (5) → 2497  7 (7) → 186A35  15 (17) → 08579214B36429A7  27 (31) → 0478AA093598166B74311B28623A55  35 (41) → 036190A653277397A9B4B85A2B15689448241207   In Base 13 :   5 (5) → 27A5  B (11) → 12495BA837  16 (19) → 08B82976AC414A3562  25 (31) → 055B42692C21347C7718A63A0AB985   In Base 14 :   3 (3) → 49  13 (17) → 0B75A9C4D2683419  15 (19) → 0A45C7522D398168BB   In Base 15 :   D (13) → 124936DCA5B8  14 (19) → 0BC9718A3E3257D64B  18 (23) → 09BB1487291E533DA67C5D   In hexadecimal :   none   In Base 17:   3 (3) → 5B  5 (5) → 36DA  7 (7) → 274E9C  B (11) → 194ADF7C63   In Base 18:   B (11) → 1B834H69ED  1B (29) → 0B31F95A9GDAE4H6EG28C781463D  21 (37) → 08DB37565F184FA3G0H946EACBC2G9D27E1H   In Base 19:   7 (7) → 2DAG58  B (11) → 1DFA6H538C  D (13) → 18EBD2HA475G   In Base 20 :   3 (3) → 6D  D (13) → 1AF7DGI94C63  H (17) → 13ABF5HCIG984E27   In Base 21:   J (19) → 1248HE7F9JIGC36D5B  12 (23) → 0J3DECG92FAK1H7684BI5A  18 (29) → 0F475198EA2IH7K5GDFJBC6AI23D   In Base 22:   5 (5) → 48HD  H (17) → 16A7GI2CKFBE53J9  J (19) → 13A95H826KIBCG4DJF   In Base 23:   3 (3) → 7F  5 (5) → 4DI9  H (17) → 182G59AILEK6HDC4   In Base 24 :   7 (7) → 3A6KDH  B (11) → 248HALJF6D  D (13) → 1L795CM3GEIB  H (17) → 19L45FCGME2JI8B7   Note that in ternary ( b = 3), the case p = 2 yields 1 as a cyclic number. While single digits may be considered trivial cases, it may be useful for completeness of the theory to consider them only when they are generated in this way.  It can be shown that no cyclic numbers (other than trivial single digits) exist in any numeric base which is a perfect square ; thus there are no cyclic numbers in hexadecimal , base 4 , or nonary .
