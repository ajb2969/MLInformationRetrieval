   Nonlinear complementarity problem      Nonlinear complementarity problem   In applied mathematics , a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) with respect to a mapping ƒ : R n → R n , denoted by NCP ƒ , is to find a vector x ∈ R n such that       x  ≥  0   ,    f   (  x  )    ≥   0  and   x  T   f   (  x  )    =   0       formulae-sequence    x  0         f  x     0  and   superscript  x  T   f  x        0      x\geq 0,\ f(x)\geq 0\text{ and }x^{T}f(x)=0\,     where ƒ ( x ) is a smooth mapping.
