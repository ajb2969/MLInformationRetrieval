Extension of a topological group

In mathematics, more specifically in topological groups, an extension of topological groups, or a topological extension, is a short exact sequence

 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are topological groups and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are continuous homomorphisms which are also open onto their images.1 Every extension of topological group is therefore a group extension
Clasification of extensions of topological groups
We say that the topological extensions


 
  and


 
  are equivalent (or congruent) if there exists a topological isomorphism 
 
 
 
  making commutative the diagram of Figure 1.

We say that the topological extension



is a split extension (or splits) if it is equivalent to the trivial extension



where 
 
 
 
  is the natural inclusion over the first factor and 
 
 
 
  is the natural projection over the second factor.
It is easy to prove that the topological extension 
 
 
 
  splits if and only if there is a continuous homomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the identity map on 
 
 

Note that the topological extension 
 
 
 
  splits if and only if the subgroup 
 
 
 
  is a topological direct summand of 
 
 

Examples

Take 
 
 
 
  the real numbers and 
 
 
 
  the integer numbers. Take 
 
 
 
  the natural inclusion and 
 
 
 
  the natural projection. Then










is an extension of topological abelian groups. Indeed it is an example of a non-splitting extension.
 

Extensions of locally compact abelian groups (LCA)
An extension of topological abelian groups will be a short exact sequence 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are locally compact abelian groups and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively open continuous homomorphisms.2

Let be an extension of locally compact abelian groups








Take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the Pontryagin duals of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the dual maps of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then the sequence
 
 



is an extension of locally compact abelian groups.
