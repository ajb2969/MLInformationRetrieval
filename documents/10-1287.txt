Formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

formylmethanofuran + H2O + acceptor $\rightleftharpoons$ CO2 + methanofuran + reduced acceptor
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are formylmethanofuran, H2O, and acceptor, whereas its 3 products are CO2, methanofuran, and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formylmethanofuran:acceptor oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called formylmethanofuran:(acceptor) oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis. It has 2 cofactors: molybdenum, and Pterin.
