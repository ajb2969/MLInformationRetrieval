Cis-2,3-dihydrobiphenyl-2,3-diol dehydrogenase




Cis-2,3-dihydrobiphenyl-2,3-diol dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a cis-2,3-dihydrobiphenyl-2,3-diol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cis-3-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol + NAD+

 
  biphenyl-2,3-diol + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cis-3-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are biphenyl-2,3-diol, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-3-phenylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in biphenyl degradation.
