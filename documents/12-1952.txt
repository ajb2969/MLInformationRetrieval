   Assembly map      Assembly map   In mathematics , assembly maps are an important concept in geometric topology . From the homotopy -theoretical viewpoint, an assembly map is a universal approximation of a homotopy invariant functor by a homology theory from the left. From the geometric viewpoint, assembly maps correspond to 'assemble' local data over a parameter space together to get global data.  Assembly maps for algebraic K-theory and L-theory play a central role in the topology of high-dimensional manifolds , since their homotopy fibers have a direct geometric interpretation. Equivariant assembly maps are used to formulate the Farrell–Jones conjectures in K- and L-theory.  Homotopy-theoretical viewpoint  It is a classical result that for any generalized homology theory     h  *     subscript  h     h_{*}   on the category of topological spaces (assumed to be homotopy equivalent to CW-complexes ), there is a spectrum    E   E   E   such that         h  *    (  X  )    ≅    π  *    (    X  +   ∧  E   )     ,         subscript  h    X      subscript  π       subscript  X    E      h_{*}(X)\cong\pi_{*}(X_{+}\wedge E),   where     X  +   :=   X   ∐   {  *  }        assign   subscript  X      X   coproduct         X_{+}:=X\coprod\{*\}   .  The functor    X  ↦    X  +   ∧  E      maps-to  X     subscript  X    E     X\mapsto X_{+}\wedge E   from spaces to spectra has the following properties:   It is homotopy-invariant (preserves homotopy equivalences). This reflects the fact that    h  *     subscript  h     h_{*}   is homotopy-invariant.  It preserves homotopy co-cartesian squares. This reflects that fact that    h  *     subscript  h     h_{*}   has Mayer-Vietoris sequences , an equivalent characterization of excision.  It preserves arbitrary coproducts . This reflects the disjoint-union axiom of    h  *     subscript  h     h_{*}   .   A functor from spaces to spectra fulfilling these properties is called excisive .  Now suppose that   F   F   F   is a homotopy-invariant, not necessarily excisive functor. An assembly map is a natural transformation     α  :    F  %   →  F      normal-:  α   normal-→   superscript  F  percent   F     \alpha\colon F^{\%}\to F   from some excisive functor    F  %     superscript  F  percent    F^{\%}   to   F   F   F   such that      F  %    (  *  )    →   F   (  *  )       normal-→     superscript  F  percent       F      F^{\%}(*)\to F(*)   is a homotopy equivalence.  If we denote by     h  *   :=    π  *   ∘   F  %       assign   subscript  h       subscript  π     superscript  F  percent      h_{*}:=\pi_{*}\circ F^{\%}   the associated homology theory, it follows that the induced natural transformation of graded abelian groups      h  *   →    π  *   ∘  F      normal-→   subscript  h       subscript  π    F     h_{*}\to\pi_{*}\circ F   is the universal transformation from a homology theory to     π  *   ∘  F       subscript  π    F    \pi_{*}\circ F   , i.e. any other transformation     k  *   →    π  *   ∘  F      normal-→   subscript  k       subscript  π    F     k_{*}\to\pi_{*}\circ F   from some homology theory    k  *     subscript  k     k_{*}   factors uniquely through a transformation of homology theories     k  *   →   h  *      normal-→   subscript  k     subscript  h      k_{*}\to h_{*}   .  Assembly maps exist for any homotopy invariant functor, by a simple homotopy-theoretical construction.  Geometric viewpoint  As a consequence of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence , the value of an excisive functor on a space   X   X   X   only depends on its value on 'small' subspaces of   X   X   X   , together with the knowledge how these small subspaces intersect. In a cycle representation of the associated homology theory, this means that all cycles must be representable by small cycles. For instance, for singular homology , the excision property is proved by subdivision of simplices , obtaining sums of small simplices representing arbitrary homology classes.  In this spirit, for certain homotopy-invariant functors which are not excisive, the corresponding excisive theory may be constructed by imposing 'control conditions', leading to the field of controlled topology . In this picture, assembly maps are 'forget-control' maps, i.e. they are induced by forgetting the control conditions.  Importance in geometric topology  Assembly maps are studied in geometric topology mainly for the two functors    L   (  X  )       L  X    L(X)   , algebraic L-theory of   X   X   X   , and    A   (  X  )       A  X    A(X)   , algebraic K-theory of spaces of   X   X   X   . In fact, the homotopy fibers of both assembly maps have a direct geometric interpretation when   X   X   X   is a compact topological manifold. Therefore knowledge about the geometry of compact topological manifolds may be obtained by studying   K   K   K   - and   L   L   L   -theory and their respective assembly maps.  In the case of   L   L   L   -theory, the homotopy fiber     L  %    (  M  )        subscript  L  percent   M    L_{\%}(M)   of the corresponding assembly map      L  %    (  M  )    →   L   (  M  )       normal-→     superscript  L  percent   M     L  M     L^{\%}(M)\to L(M)   , evaluated at a compact topological manifold   M   M   M   , is homotopy equivalent to the space of block structures of   M   M   M   . Moreover, the fibration sequence        L  %    (  M  )    →    L  %    (  M  )    →   L   (  M  )         normal-→     subscript  L  percent   M      superscript  L  percent   M     normal-→      L  M      L_{\%}(M)\to L^{\%}(M)\to L(M)   induces a long exact sequence of homotopy groups which may be identified with the surgery exact sequence of   M   M   M   . This may be called the fundamental theorem of surgery theory and was developed subsequently by Browder, Novikov, Sullivan, Wall, Quinn, and Ranicki.  For   A   A   A   -theory, the homotopy fiber     A  %    (  M  )        subscript  A  percent   M    A_{\%}(M)   of the corresponding assembly map is homotopy equivalent to the space of stable h-cobordisms on   M   M   M   . This fact is called the stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem , proven by Waldhausen-Jahren-Rognes. It may be viewed as a parametrized version of the classical theorem which states that equivalence classes of h-cobordisms on   M   M   M   are in 1-to-1 correspondence with elements in the Whitehead group of     π  1    (  M  )        subscript  π  1   M    \pi_{1}(M)   .
