   Rencontres numbers      Rencontres numbers   In combinatorial  mathematics , the rencontres numbers are a triangular array of integers that enumerate permutations of the set { 1, ..., n } with specified numbers of fixed points : in other words, partial derangements . ( Rencontre is French for encounter . By some accounts, the problem is named after a solitaire game.) For n ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n , the rencontres number D n , k is the number of permutations of { 1, ..., n } that have exactly k fixed points.  For example, if seven presents are given to seven different people, but only two are destined to get the right present, there are D 7, 2 = 924 ways this could happen. Another often cited example is that of a dance school with 7 couples, where after tea-break the participants are told to randomly find a partner to continue, and there are D 7, 2 = 924 possibilities once more, now, that 2 previous couples meet again just by chance.  Numerical values  Here is the beginning of this array :           ╲    k   n      subscript   superscript  normal-╲  k   n    {}_{n}\!\!\diagdown\!\!^{k}      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7       0   1     1   0   1     2   1   0   1     3   2   3   0   1     4   9   8   6   0   1     5   44   45   20   10   0   1     6   265   264   135   40   15   0   1     7   1854   1855   924   315   70   21   0   1     Formulas  The numbers in the k = 0 column enumerate derangements . Thus        D   0  ,  0    =  1   ,       subscript  D   0  0    1    D_{0,0}=1,\!           D   1  ,  0    =  0   ,       subscript  D   1  0    0    D_{1,0}=0,\!          D    n  +  2   ,  0    =    (   n  +  1   )    (    D    n  +  1   ,  0    +   D   n  ,  0     )         subscript  D     n  2   0        n  1      subscript  D     n  1   0     subscript  D   n  0        D_{n+2,0}=(n+1)(D_{n+1,0}+D_{n,0})\!     for non-negative n . It turns out that       D   n  ,  0    =   [    n  !   e   ]        subscript  D   n  0     delimited-[]      n   e      D_{n,0}=\left[{n!\over e}\right]     where the ratio is rounded up for even n and rounded down for odd n . For n ≥ 1, this gives the nearest integer. More generally, we have        D   n  ,  k    =    (     n      k     )   ⋅   D    n  -  k   ,  0      .       subscript  D   n  k     normal-⋅   binomial  n  k    subscript  D     n  k   0       D_{n,k}={n\choose k}\cdot D_{n-k,0}.     The proof is easy after one knows how to enumerate derangements: choose the k fixed points out of n ; then choose the derangement of the other n − k points.  The numbers are generated by the power series  ; accordingly, an explicit formula for D n , m can be derived as follows:        D   n  ,  m    =     n  !    m  !     [   z   n  -  m    ]     e   -  z     1  -  z     =     n  !    m  !      ∑   k  =  0    n  -  m       (   -  1   )   k    k  !       .         subscript  D   n  m          n     m     delimited-[]   superscript  z    n  m        superscript  e    z      1  z                n     m      superscript   subscript     k  0      n  m       superscript    1   k     k         D_{n,m}=\frac{n!}{m!}[z^{n-m}]\frac{e^{-z}}{1-z}=\frac{n!}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}%
 \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!}.     This immediately implies that       D   n  ,  m    =    (     n      m     )     D    n  -  m   ,  0      and     D   n  ,  m     n  !     ≈    e   -  1     m  !           subscript  D   n  m       binomial  n  m    subscript  D     n  m   0    and     subscript  D   n  m      n             superscript  e    1      m       D_{n,m}={n\choose m}D_{n-m,0}\;\;\mbox{ and }\;\;\frac{D_{n,m}}{n!}\approx%
 \frac{e^{-1}}{m!}     for n large, m fixed.  Probability distribution  The sum of the entries in each row is the whole number of permutations of { 1, ..., n }, and is therefore n !. If one divides all the entries in the n th row by n !, one gets the probability distribution of the number of fixed points of a uniformly distributed random permutation of { 1, ..., n }. The probability that the number of fixed points is k is        D   n  ,  k     n  !    .       subscript  D   n  k      n     {D_{n,k}\over n!}.     For n ≥ 1, the expected number of fixed points is 1 (a fact that follows from linearity of expectation).  More generally, for i ≤ n , the i th moment of this probability distribution is the i th moment of the Poisson distribution with expected value 1. 1 For i > n , the i th moment is smaller than that of that Poisson distribution. Specifically, for i ≤ n , the i th moment is the i th Bell number , i.e. the number of partitions of a set of size i .  Limiting probability distribution  As the size of the permuted set grows, we get         lim   n  →  ∞      D   n  ,  k     n  !     =    e   -  1     k  !     .        subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  D   n  k      n        superscript  e    1      k      \lim_{n\to\infty}{D_{n,k}\over n!}={e^{-1}\over k!}.     This is just the probability that a Poisson-distributed random variable with expected value 1 is equal to k . In other words, as n grows, the probability distribution of the number of fixed points of a random permutation of a set of size n approaches the Poisson distribution with expected value 1.
