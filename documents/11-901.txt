Flavonol-3-O-triglucoside O-coumaroyltransferase




Flavonol-3-O-triglucoside O-coumaroyltransferase

In enzymology, a flavonol-3-O-triglucoside O-coumaroyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-coumaroyl-CoA + a flavonol 3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside] 
 
 
 
  CoA + a flavonol 3-O-[6-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)- beta-D-glucoside]
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-coumaroyl-CoA, flavonol, and 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside, whereas its 4 products are CoA, flavonol, 3-O-[6-(4-coumaroyl)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-, and beta-D-glucoside].
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, to be specific those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-coumaroyl-CoA:flavonol-3-O-[beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosid e] 6-O-4-coumaroyltransferase'''.
