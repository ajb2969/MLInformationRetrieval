   Pillai's arithmetical function      Pillai's arithmetical function   In number theory , the gcd-sum function, 1 also called Pillai's arithmetical function , 2 is defined for every   n   n   n   by       P   (  n  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   n    gcd   (  k  ,  n  )           P  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n     k  n      P(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\gcd(k,n)     or equivalently 3       P   (  n  )    =    ∑   d  ∣  n     d  φ   (   n  /  d   )           P  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n      d  φ    n  d       P(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d\varphi(n/d)     where   d   d   d   is a divisor of   n   n   n   and   φ   φ   \varphi   is Euler's totient function .  it also can be written as 4       P   (  n  )    =    ∑   d  ∣  n     d  σ   (  d  )   μ   (   n  /  d   )           P  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n      d  σ  d  μ    n  d       P(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d\sigma(d)\mu(n/d)     where,   σ   σ   \sigma   is the Divisor function , and   μ   μ   \mu   is the Möbius function .  This multiplicative arithmetical function was introduced by the Indian mathematician Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1933. 5  References  "  Category:Arithmetic functions     ↩    http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/135351/sum-of-gcdk-n ↩  ↩
