Pillai's arithmetical function

In number theory, the gcd-sum function,1 also called Pillai's arithmetical function,2 is defined for every 
 
 
 
  by



or equivalently3



where 
 
 
 
  is a divisor of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is Euler's totient function.
it also can be written as4



where, 
 
 
 
  is the Divisor function, and 
 
 
 
  is the MÃ¶bius function.
This multiplicative arithmetical function was introduced by the Indian mathematician Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1933.5
