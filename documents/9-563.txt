   Stream thrust averaging      Stream thrust averaging   In fluid dynamics , stream thrust averaging is a process used to convert three-dimensional flow through a duct into one-dimensional uniform flow. It makes the assumptions that the flow is mixed adiabatically and without friction . However, due to the mixing process, there is a net increase in the entropy of the system. Although there is an increase in entropy , the stream thrust averaged values are more representative of the flow than a simple average as a simple average would violate the second Law of Thermodynamics .

 HR\over C_{p}}=0.     Solutions  Solving for    U  ¯     normal-¯  U    \overline{U}   yields two solutions. They must both be analyzed to determine which is the physical solution. One will usually be a subsonic root and the other a supersonic root. If it is not clear which value of velocity is correct, the second law of thermodynamics may be applied.        ρ  ¯   =    m  ˙     U  ¯   A     ,       normal-¯  ρ      normal-˙  m      normal-¯  U   A      \overline{\rho}={\dot{m}\over\overline{U}A},           p  ¯   =    F  A   -    ρ  ¯     U  ¯   2      ,       normal-¯  p       F  A      normal-¯  ρ    superscript   normal-¯  U   2       \overline{p}={F\over A}-{\overline{\rho}\overline{U}^{2}},           h  ¯   =     p  ¯    C  p      ρ  ¯   R     .       normal-¯  h        normal-¯  p    subscript  C  p       normal-¯  ρ   R      \overline{h}={\overline{p}C_{p}\over\overline{\rho}R}.     Second law of thermodynamics:        ∇  s   =     C  p    ln   (    T  ¯    T  1    )     +   R   ln   (    p  ¯    p  1    )       .       normal-∇  s        subscript  C  p        normal-¯  T    subscript  T  1        R       normal-¯  p    subscript  p  1         \nabla s=C_{p}\ln({\overline{T}\over T_{1}})+R\ln({\overline{p}\over p_{1}}).     The values    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   are unknown and may be dropped from the formulation. The value of entropy is not necessary, only that the value is positive.        ∇  s   =     C  p    ln   (   T  ¯   )     +   R   ln   (   p  ¯   )       .       normal-∇  s        subscript  C  p      normal-¯  T       R     normal-¯  p        \nabla s=C_{p}\ln(\overline{T})+R\ln(\overline{p}).     One possible unreal solution for the stream thrust averaged velocity yields a negative entropy. Another method of determining the proper solution is to take a simple average of the velocity and determining which value is closer to the stream thrust averaged velocity.
