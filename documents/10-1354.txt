   Rubredoxin—NAD(+) reductase      Rubredoxin—NAD(+) reductase   In enzymology , a rubredoxin-NAD + reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 reduced rubredoxin + NAD + + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 oxidized rubredoxin + NADH   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are reduced rubredoxin , NAD + , and H + , whereas its two products are oxidized rubredoxin and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on iron-sulfur proteins as donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is rubredoxin:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include rubredoxin reductase , rubredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reductase , dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-rubredoxin reductase , reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-rubredoxin reductase , NADH-rubredoxin reductase , rubredoxin-NAD reductase , NADH: rubredoxin oxidoreductase , DPNH-rubredoxin reductase , and NADH-rubredoxin oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD and Iron .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
