Lyapunov redesign

In nonlinear control, the technique of Lyapunov redesign refers to the design where a stabilizing state feedback controller can be constructed with knowledge of the Lyapunov function

 
 . Consider the system



where 
 
 
 
  is the state vector and 
 
 
 
 
  is the vector of inputs. The functions 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are defined for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a domain that contains the origin. A nominal model for this system can be written as



and the control law



stabilizes the system. The design of 
 
 
 
  is called Lyapunov redesign.
