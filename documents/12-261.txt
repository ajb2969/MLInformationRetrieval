   Lyapunov redesign      Lyapunov redesign   In nonlinear control , the technique of Lyapunov redesign refers to the design where a stabilizing state feedback controller can be constructed with knowledge of the Lyapunov function    V   V   V   . Consider the system       x  ˙   =    f   (  t  ,  x  )    +   G   (  t  ,  x  )    [   u  +   δ   (  t  ,  x  ,  u  )     ]          normal-˙  x       f   t  x      G   t  x    delimited-[]    u    δ   t  x  u          \dot{x}=f(t,x)+G(t,x)[u+\delta(t,x,u)]     where    x  ∈   R  n       x   superscript  R  n     x\in R^{n}   is the state vector and    u  ∈   R  p       u   superscript  R  p     u\in R^{p}   is the vector of inputs. The functions   f   f   f   ,   G   G   G   , and   δ   δ   \delta   are defined for     (  t  ,  x  ,  u  )   ∈    [  0  ,  inf  )   ×  D  ×   R  p         t  x  u      0  infimum   D   superscript  R  p      (t,x,u)\in[0,\inf)\times D\times R^{p}   , where    D  ⊂   R  n       D   superscript  R  n     D\subset R^{n}   is a domain that contains the origin. A nominal model for this system can be written as       x  ˙   =    f   (  t  ,  x  )    +   G   (  t  ,  x  )   u         normal-˙  x       f   t  x      G   t  x   u      \dot{x}=f(t,x)+G(t,x)u     and the control law      u  =    ϕ   (  t  ,  x  )    +  v       u      ϕ   t  x    v     u=\phi(t,x)+v     stabilizes the system. The design of   v   v   v   is called Lyapunov redesign .  Further reading     References  "  Category:Nonlinear control
