   Tetrahydroberberine oxidase      Tetrahydroberberine oxidase   In enzymology , a tetrahydroberberine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-tetrahydroberberine + 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   berberine + 2 H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-tetrahydroberberine and O 2 , whereas its two products are berberine and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-tetrahydroberberine:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called (S)-THB oxidase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis.
