   Spectral abscissa      Spectral abscissa   In mathematics , the spectral abscissa of a matrix or a bounded linear operator is the supremum among the real part of the elements in its spectrum , sometimes denoted as    η   (  A  )       η  A    \eta(A)     Matrices  Let λ 1 , ..., λ s be the ( real or complex ) eigenvalues of a matrix A ∈ C n × n . Then its spectral abscissa is defined as:       η   (  A  )    =    max  i    {   Re   (   λ  i   )    }          η  A     subscript   i     Re   subscript  λ  i       \eta(A)=\max_{i}\{{\rm Re}(\lambda_{i})\}\,     For example if the set of eigenvalues were = {1+3i,2+3i,4-2i}, then the Spectral abscissa in this case would be 4.  It is often used as a measure of stability in control theory, where a continuous system is stable if all its eigenvalues are located in the left half plane, i.e.     η   (  A  )    <  0        η  A   0    \eta(A)<0     See also  Spectral radius  "  Category:Spectral theory  Category:Matrix theory
