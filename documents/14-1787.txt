Neat submanifold

In differential topology, an area of mathematics, a neat submanifold of a manifold with boundary is a kind of "well-behaved" submanifold. More precisely, let 
 
 
 
  be a manifold with boundary, and 
 
 
 
  a submanifold of 
 
 
 
 . A is said to be a neat submanifold of 
 
 
 
  if it meets the following two conditions:1

The boundary of the submanifold coincides with the parts of the submanifold that are part of the boundary of the larger manifold. That is, 
 
 
 
 .
Each point of the submanifold has a neighborhood within which the submanifold's embedding is equivalent to the embedding of a hyperplane in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space. More formally, 
 
 
 
  must be covered by charts

 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the dimension  For instance, in the category of smooth manifolds, this means that the embedding of 
 
 
 
  must also be smooth.
