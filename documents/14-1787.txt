   Neat submanifold      Neat submanifold   In differential topology , an area of mathematics, a neat submanifold of a manifold with boundary is a kind of "well-behaved" submanifold . More precisely, let   M   M   M   be a manifold with boundary, and   A   A   A   a submanifold of   M   M   M   . A is said to be a neat submanifold of   M   M   M   if it meets the following two conditions: 1   The boundary of the submanifold coincides with the parts of the submanifold that are part of the boundary of the larger manifold. That is,     ∂  A   =   A  ∩   ∂  M          A     A    M      \partial A=A\cap\partial M   .  Each point of the submanifold has a neighborhood within which the submanifold's embedding is equivalent to the embedding of a hyperplane in a higher-dimensional Euclidean space. More formally,   A   A   A   must be covered by charts     (  U  ,  ϕ  )     U  ϕ    (U,\phi)   of   M   M   M   such that     A  ∩  U   =    ϕ   -  1     (   ℝ  m   )          A  U      superscript  ϕ    1     superscript  ℝ  m      A\cap U=\phi^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^{m})   where   m   m   m   is the dimension For instance, in the category of smooth manifolds , this means that the embedding of   A   A   A   must also be smooth.
