   Biggs–Smith graph      Biggs–Smith graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the Biggs–Smith graph is a 3- regular graph with 102 vertices and 153 edges. 1  It has chromatic number 3, chromatic index 3, radius 7, diameter 7 and girth 9. It is also a 3- vertex-connected graph and a 3- edge-connected graph .  All the cubic  distance-regular graphs are known. 2 The Biggs–Smith graph is one of the 13 such graphs.  Algebraic properties  The automorphism group of the Biggs–Smith graph is a group of order 2448 3 isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2,17). It acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore the Biggs–Smith graph is a symmetric graph . It has automorphisms that take any vertex to any other vertex and any edge to any other edge. According to the Foster census , the Biggs–Smith graph, referenced as F102A, is the only cubic symmetric graph on 102 vertices. 4  The Biggs–Smith graph is also uniquely determined by the its graph spectrum , the set of graph eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix . 5  The characteristic polynomial of the Biggs–Smith graph is :     (   x  -  3   )     (   x  -  2   )   18    x  17     (    x  2   -  x  -  4   )   9     (     x  3   +   3   x  2     -  3   )   16         x  3    superscript    x  2   18    superscript  x  17    superscript     superscript  x  2   x  4   9    superscript       superscript  x  3     3   superscript  x  2     3   16     (x-3)(x-2)^{18}x^{17}(x^{2}-x-4)^{9}(x^{3}+3x^{2}-3)^{16}   .
