   Cuthill–McKee algorithm      Cuthill–McKee algorithm   (Figure)  Cuthill-McKee ordering of a matrix   (Figure)  RCM ordering of the same matrix   In the mathematical subfield of matrix theory , the Cuthill–McKee algorithm ( CM ), named for Elizabeth Cuthill and J. McKee , 1 is an algorithm to permute a sparse matrix that has a symmetric sparsity pattern into a band matrix form with a small bandwidth . The reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm ( RCM ) due to Alan George is the same algorithm but with the resulting index numbers reversed. In practice this generally results in less fill-in than the CM ordering when Gaussian elimination is applied. 2  The Cuthill McKee algorithm is a variant of the standard breadth-first search algorithm used in graph algorithms. It starts with a peripheral node and then generates levels     R  i     subscript  R  i    R_{i}   for    i  =  1  ,  2  ,  .  .     fragments  i   1  normal-,  2  normal-,  normal-.  normal-.    i=1,2,..   until all nodes are exhausted. The set    R   i  +  1      subscript  R    i  1     R_{i+1}   is created from set    R  i     subscript  R  i    R_{i}   by listing all vertices adjacent to all nodes in    R  i     subscript  R  i    R_{i}   . These nodes are listed in increasing degree. This last detail is the only difference with the breadth-first search algorithm.  Algorithm  Given a symmetric    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrix we visualize the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a graph . The Cuthill–McKee algorithm is then a relabeling of the vertices of the graph to reduce the bandwidth of the adjacency matrix.  The algorithm produces an ordered n -tuple  R of vertices which is the new order of the vertices.  First we choose a peripheral vertex (the vertex with the lowest degree ) x and set R := ({ x }).  Then for    i  =   1  ,  2  ,  …       i   1  2  normal-…     i=1,2,\dots   we iterate the following steps while | R | A_i of    R  i     subscript  R  i    R_{i}   (with    R  i     subscript  R  i    R_{i}   the i -th component of R ) and exclude the vertices we already have in R       A  i   :=    Adj   (   R  i   )    ∖  R      assign   subscript  A  i      Adj   subscript  R  i    R     A_{i}:=\operatorname{Adj}(R_{i})\setminus R      Sort    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   with ascending vertex order ( vertex degree ).  Append    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   to the Result set R .   In other words, number the vertices according to a particular breadth-first traversal where neighboring vertices are visited in order from lowest to highest vertex order.
