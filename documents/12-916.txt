The Yeoh hyperelastic material model1 is a phenomenological model for the deformation of nearly incompressible, nonlinear elastic materials such as rubber. The model is based on Ronald Rivlin's observation that the elastic properties of rubber may be described using a strain energy density function which is a power series in the strain invariants

 
 .2 The Yeoh model for incompressible rubber is a function only of 
 
 
 
 . For compressible rubbers, a dependence on 
 
 
 
  is added on. Since a polynomial form of the strain energy density function is used but all the three invariants of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor are not, the Yeoh model is also called the reduced polynomial model.

Strain energy density function
The original model proposed by Yeoh had a cubic form with only 
 
 
 
  dependence and is applicable to purely incompressible materials. The strain energy density for this model is written as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are material constants. The quantity 
 
 
 
  can be interpreted as the initial shear modulus.
Today a slightly more generalized version of the Yeoh model is used.3 This model includes 
 
 
 
  terms and is written as



When 
 
 
 
  the Yeoh model reduces to the neo-Hookean model for incompressible materials.
For consistency with linear elasticity the Yeoh model has to satisfy the condition


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the shear modulus of the material. Now, at 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  Therefore, the consistency condition for the Yeoh model is



Stress-deformation relations
The Cauchy stress for the incompressible Yeoh model is given by



Uniaxial extension
For uniaxial extension in the 
 
 
 
 -direction, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  Since 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Therefore,


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Equibiaxial extension
For equibiaxial extension in the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  directions, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  Since 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Therefore,


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Planar extension
Planar extension tests are carried out on thin specimens which are constrained from deforming in one direction. For planar extension in the 
 
 
 
  directions with the 
 
 
 
  direction constrained, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  Since 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Therefore,


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Yeoh model for compressible rubbers
A version of the Yeoh model that includes 
 
 
 
  dependence is used for compressible rubbers. The strain energy density function for this model is written as


 
  where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are material constants. The quantity 
 
 
 
  is interpreted as half the initial shear modulus, while 
 
 
 
  is interpreted as half the initial bulk modulus.
When 
 
 
 
  the compressible Yeoh model reduces to the neo-Hookean model for incompressible materials.
