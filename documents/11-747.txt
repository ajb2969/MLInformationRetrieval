   N-acyl-D-amino-acid deacylase      N-acyl-D-amino-acid deacylase   In enzymology , a N-acyl-D-amino-acid deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acyl-D-amino acid + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an acid + D-amino acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acyl-D-amino acid and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acid and D-amino acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase . It employs one cofactor , zinc .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
