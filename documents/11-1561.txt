Pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, a pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 4'-Phosphopantetheine
 
 
 
  diphosphate + 3'-dephospho-CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 4'-Phosphopantetheine, whereas its two products are diphosphate and 3'-dephospho-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:pantetheine-4'-phosphate adenylyltransferase. Other names in common use include dephospho-CoA pyrophosphorylase, pantetheine phosphate adenylyltransferase, dephospho-coenzyme A pyrophosphorylase, and 3'-dephospho-CoA pyrophosphorylase. This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.
