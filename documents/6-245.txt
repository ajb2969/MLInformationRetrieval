Antiisomorphism

In Category theory, a branch of formal mathematics, an antiisomorphism (or anti-isomorphism) between structured sets A and B is an isomorphism from A to the opposite of B (or equivalently from the opposite of A to B).1 If there exists an antiisomorphism between two structures, they are antiisomorphic.
Intuitively, to say that two mathematical structures are antiisomorphic is to say that they are basically opposites of one another.
The concept is particularly useful in an algebraic setting, as, for instance, when applied to rings.
Simple example
Let A be the binary relation (or directed graph) consisting of elements {1,2,3} and binary relation 
 
 
 
  defined as follows:











Let B be the binary relation set consisting of elements {a,b,c} and binary relation 
 
 
 
  defined as follows:











Note that the opposite of B (called Bop) is the same set of elements with the opposite binary relation 
 
 
 
  (that is, reverse all the arcs of the directed graph):











If we replace a, b, and c with 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we will see that each rule in Bop is the same as some rule in A. That is, we can define an isomorphism 
 
 
 
  from A to Bop by



This 
 
 
 
  is an antiisomorphism between A and B.
Ring anti-isomorphisms
Specializing the general language of category theory to the algebraic topic of rings, we have: Let R and S be rings and f: R → S a bijection between them, then if


f will be called a ring anti-isomorphism.2 If R = S then f will be called a ring anti-automorphism.
An example of a ring anti-automorphism is given by the conjugate mapping of quaternions:3
