Set the Risk-neutral probability of an up move, p, = 50% 1. For each input spot rate , iteratively :   adjust the rate at the top-most node at the current time-step, i;  find all other nodes in the time-step, where these are linked to the node immediately above (r     u     u    {}_{u}   ; r     d     d    {}_{d}   being the node in question) via 0.5× ln (r     u     u    {}_{u}   /r     d     d    {}_{d}   ) = σ     i     i    {}_{i}   ×√Δt (this node-spacing being consistent with p = 50%; Δt being the length of the time-step);  discount recursively through the tree using the rate at each node, i.e. via "backwards induction", from the time-step in question to the first node in the tree (i.e. i=0);  repeat until the discounted value at the first node in the tree equals the zero-price corresponding to the given spot interest rate .   2. Once solved, retain these known short rates, and proceed to the next time-step (i.e. input spot-rate), "growing" the tree until it incorporates the full input yield-curve. |}  In mathematical finance , the Black–Derman–Toy model ( BDT ) is a popular short rate model used in the pricing of bond options , swaptions and other interest rate derivatives ; see Lattice model (finance) #Interest rate derivatives . It is a one-factor model; that is, a single stochastic factor – the short rate – determines the future evolution of all interest rates. It was the first model to combine the mean-reverting behaviour of the short rate with the lognormal distribution , 1 and is still widely used.

It was first developed for in-house use by Goldman Sachs in the 1980s and was published in the Financial Analysts Journal in 1990. A personal account of the development of the model is provided in one of the chapters in Emanuel Derman's memoir " My Life as a Quant ." 3  Under BDT, using a binomial lattice , one calibrates the model parameters to fit both the current term structure of interest rates ( yield curve ), and the volatility structure for interest rate caps (usually as implied by the Black-76 -prices for each component caplet); see aside. Using the calibrated lattice one can then value a variety of more complex interest-rate sensitive securities and interest rate derivatives .  Although initially developed for a lattice-based environment, the model has been shown to imply the following continuous stochastic differential equation : 4 5       d   ln   (  r  )     =     [    θ  t   +     σ  t  ′    σ  t     ln   (  r  )      ]   d  t   +     σ  t    d   W  t           d    r         delimited-[]     subscript  θ  t        subscript   superscript  σ  normal-′   t    subscript  σ  t      r      d  t      subscript  σ  t   d   subscript  W  t       d\ln(r)=[\theta_{t}+\frac{\sigma^{\prime}_{t}}{\sigma_{t}}\ln(r)]dt+\sigma_{t}%
 \,dW_{t}       where,      r    r   r\,   = the instantaneous short rate at time t       θ  t      subscript  θ  t    \theta_{t}\,   = value of the underlying asset at option expiry       σ  t      subscript  σ  t    \sigma_{t}\,   = instant short rate volatility       W  t      subscript  W  t    W_{t}\,   = a standard Brownian motion under a risk-neutral probability measure;    d    W  t        d   subscript  W  t     dW_{t}\,   its differential .     For constant (time independent) short rate volatility,    σ    σ   \sigma\,   , the model is:       d   ln   (  r  )     =      θ  t    d  t   +    σ   d   W  t           d    r         subscript  θ  t   d  t     σ  d   subscript  W  t       d\ln(r)=\theta_{t}\,dt+\sigma\,dW_{t}     One reason that the model remains popular, is that the "standard" Root-finding algorithms – such as Newton's method (the secant method ) or bisection – are very easily applied to the calibration. 6 Relatedly, the model was originally described in algorithmic language, and not using stochastic calculus or martingales . 7  References         External links   Online: Black-Derman-Toy short rate tree generator Dr. Shing Hing Man, Thomson-Reuters' Risk Management  Online: Pricing A Bond Using the BDT Model Dr. Shing Hing Man, Thomson-Reuters' Risk Management  Calculator for BDT Model QuantCalc, Online Financial Math Calculator  Excel BDT calculator and tree generator , Serkan Gur   "  Category:Financial economics  Category:Mathematical finance  Category:Fixed income analysis  Category:Short-rate models
