   Band sum      Band sum   In geometric topology , a band sum of two n -dimensional knots K 1 and K 2 along an ( n + 1)-dimensional 1-handle h called a band is an n -dimensional knot K such that:   There is an ( n + 1)-dimensional 1-handle h connected to ( K 1 , K 2 ) embedded in S n +2 .  There are points     p  1   ∈   K  1        subscript  p  1    subscript  K  1     p_{1}\in K_{1}   and     p  2   ∈   K  2        subscript  p  2    subscript  K  2     p_{2}\in K_{2}   such that   h   h   h   is attached to     K  1   ⊔   K  2      square-union   subscript  K  1    subscript  K  2     K_{1}\sqcup K_{2}   along     p  1   ⊔   p  2      square-union   subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2     p_{1}\sqcup p_{2}   .   K is the n -dimensional knot obtained by this surgery.  A band sum is thus a generalization of the usual connected sum of knots.  See also   Manifold decomposition   References    .   .
