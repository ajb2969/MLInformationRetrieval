Band sum

In geometric topology, a band sum of two n-dimensional knots K1 and K2 along an (n + 1)-dimensional 1-handle h called a band is an n-dimensional knot K such that:

There is an (n + 1)-dimensional 1-handle h connected to (K1, K2) embedded in Sn+2.
There are points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is attached to 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 .

K is the n-dimensional knot obtained by this surgery.
A band sum is thus a generalization of the usual connected sum of knots.
