Lévy's constant

In mathematics Lévy's constant (sometimes known as the Khinchin–Lévy constant) occurs in an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the denominators of the convergents of continued fractions.1 In 1935, the Soviet mathematician Aleksandr Khinchin showed2 that the denominators qn of the convergents of the continued fraction expansions of almost all real numbers satisfy


 
  for some constant γ. Soon afterward, in 1936, the French mathematician Paul Lévy found3 the explicit expression for the constant, namely



The term "Lévy's constant" is sometimes used to refer to 
 
 
 
  (the logarithm of the above expression), which is approximately equal to 1.1865691104….
The base-10 logarithm of Lévy's constant, which is approximately 0.51532041…, is half of the reciprocal of the limit in Lochs' theorem.
