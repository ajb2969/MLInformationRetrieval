   Lévy's constant      Lévy's constant   In mathematics  Lévy's constant (sometimes known as the Khinchin–Lévy constant ) occurs in an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the denominators of the convergents of continued fractions . 1 In 1935, the Soviet mathematician  Aleksandr Khinchin showed 2 that the denominators q n of the convergents of the continued fraction expansions of almost all real numbers satisfy        lim   n  →  ∞     q  n     1  /  n     =  γ        subscript    normal-→  n      superscript   subscript  q  n     1  n     γ    \lim_{n\to\infty}{q_{n}}^{1/n}=\gamma   for some constant γ. Soon afterward, in 1936, the French mathematician Paul Lévy found 3 the explicit expression for the constant, namely       γ  =   e    π  2   /   (   12   ln  2    )     =   3.275822918721811159787681882  …    .        γ   superscript  e     superscript  π  2     12    2             3.275822918721811159787681882  normal-…      \gamma=e^{\pi^{2}/(12\ln 2)}=3.275822918721811159787681882\ldots.     The term "Lévy's constant" is sometimes used to refer to     π  2   /   (   12   ln  2    )        superscript  π  2     12    2      \pi^{2}/(12\ln 2)   (the logarithm of the above expression), which is approximately equal to 1.1865691104….  The base-10 logarithm of Lévy's constant, which is approximately 0.51532041…, is half of the reciprocal of the limit in Lochs' theorem .
