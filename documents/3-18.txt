   Law of tangents      Law of tangents   In trigonometry , the law of tangents 1 is a statement about the relationship between the tangents of two angles of a triangle and the lengths of the opposing sides.  In Figure 1, a , b , and c are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, and α, β, and γ are the angles opposite those three respective sides. The law of tangents states that         a  -  b    a  +  b    =    tan   [    1  2    (   α  -  β   )    ]     tan   [    1  2    (   α  +  β   )    ]      .          a  b     a  b            1  2     α  β           1  2     α  β        \frac{a-b}{a+b}=\frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)]}{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha%
 +\beta)]}.     The law of tangents, although not as commonly known as the law of sines or the law of cosines , is equivalent to the law of sines, and can be used in any case where two sides and the included angle, or two angles and a side, are known.  The law of tangents for spherical triangles was described in the 13th century by Persian mathematician  Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–74), who also presented the law of sines for plane triangles in his five-volume work Treatise on the Quadrilateral . 2 3  Proof  To prove the law of tangents we can start with the law of sines :        a   sin  α    =   b   sin  β     .        a    α      b    β      \frac{a}{\sin\alpha}=\frac{b}{\sin\beta}.     Let       d  =   a   sin  α     ,   d  =   b   sin  β        formulae-sequence    d    a    α       d    b    β       d=\frac{a}{\sin\alpha},d=\frac{b}{\sin\beta}     so that       a  =   d   sin   α  and  b     =   d   sin  β     .        a    d      α  and  b            d    β       a=d\sin\alpha\text{ and }b=d\sin\beta.\,     It follows that         a  -  b    a  +  b    =     d   sin  α    -   d   sin  β       d   sin  α    +   d   sin  β      =     sin  α   -   sin  β      sin  α   +   sin  β      .            a  b     a  b          d    α      d    β         d    α      d    β                 α     β        α     β        \frac{a-b}{a+b}=\frac{d\sin\alpha-d\sin\beta}{d\sin\alpha+d\sin\beta}=\frac{%
 \sin\alpha-\sin\beta}{\sin\alpha+\sin\beta}.     Using the trigonometric identity , the factor formula for sines specifically         sin   (  α  )    ±   sin   (  β  )     =   2   sin   (    α  ±  β   2   )     cos   (    α  ∓  β   2   )      ,       plus-or-minus    α     β      2       plus-or-minus  α  β   2         minus-or-plus  α  β   2       \sin(\alpha)\pm\sin(\beta)=2\sin\left(\frac{\alpha\pm\beta}{2}\right)\cos\left%
 (\frac{\alpha\mp\beta}{2}\right),\;     we get         a  -  b    a  +  b    =    2   sin   1  2     (   α  -  β   )    cos   1  2     (   α  +  β   )     2   sin   1  2     (   α  +  β   )    cos   1  2     (   α  -  β   )     =    tan   [    1  2    (   α  -  β   )    ]     tan   [    1  2    (   α  +  β   )    ]      .            a  b     a  b        2      1  2      α  β       1  2      α  β      2      1  2      α  β       1  2      α  β                  1  2     α  β           1  2     α  β         \frac{a-b}{a+b}=\frac{2\sin\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\alpha-\beta\right)\cos\tfrac{1}{%
 2}\left(\alpha+\beta\right)}{2\sin\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\alpha+\beta\right)\cos%
 \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\alpha-\beta\right)}=\frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)]}{%
 \tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\beta)]}.     As an alternative to using the identity for the sum or difference of two sines, one may cite the trigonometric identity       tan   (    α  ±  β   2   )    =     sin  α   ±   sin  β      cos  α   +   cos  β              plus-or-minus  α  β   2       plus-or-minus    α     β        α     β       \tan\left(\frac{\alpha\pm\beta}{2}\right)=\frac{\sin\alpha\pm\sin\beta}{\cos%
 \alpha+\cos\beta}     (see tangent half-angle formula ).  Application  The law of tangents can be used to compute the missing side and angles of a triangle in which two sides    a  ,  b     a  b    a,b   and the enclosed angle   γ   γ   \gamma   are given. From     tan   [    1  2    (   α  -  β   )    ]    =     a  -  b    a  +  b     tan   [    1  2    (   α  +  β   )    ]     =     a  -  b    a  +  b     cot   (   γ  2   )                 1  2     α  β           a  b     a  b          1  2     α  β                 a  b     a  b        γ  2        \tan\left[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)\right]=\frac{a-b}{a+b}\tan\left[\frac{1}{2%
 }(\alpha+\beta)\right]=\frac{a-b}{a+b}\cot\left(\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)   one can compute    α  -  β      α  β    \alpha-\beta   ; together with     α  +  β   =    180  ∘   -  γ         α  β      superscript  180    γ     \alpha+\beta=180^{\circ}-\gamma   this yields   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   ; the remaining side   c   c   c   can then be computed using the law of sines . In the time before electronic calculators were available, this method was preferable to an application of the law of cosines     c  =      a  2   +   b  2    -   2  a  b   cos  γ          c         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2      2  a  b    γ        c=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos\gamma}   , as this latter law necessitated an additional lookup in a logarithm table , in order to compute the square root. In modern times the law of tangents may have better numerical properties than the law of cosines: If   γ   γ   \gamma   is small, and   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are almost equal, then an application of the law of cosines leads to a subtraction of almost equal values, which implies a loss of significant digits .  Spherical version  On a sphere of unit radius, the sides of the triangle are arcs of great circles . Accordingly their lengths can be expressed in radians or any units in which angles can be measured. Let (capital) A , B , C be the angles at the three vertices of the triangle and let (lower-case) a , b , c be the respective lengths of the opposite sides. The spherical law of tangents the says 4         tan   (     A  -  B   2    )     tan   (     A  +  B   2    )     =    tan   (     a  -  b   2    )     tan   (     a  +  b   2    )      .              A  B   2          A  B   2             a  b   2          a  b   2       \frac{\tan\left(\dfrac{A-B}{2}\right)}{\tan\left(\dfrac{A+B}{2}\right)}=\frac{%
 \tan\left(\dfrac{a-b}{2}\right)}{\tan\left(\dfrac{a+b}{2}\right)}.
