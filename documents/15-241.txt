Sorting identity

In mathematics, the sorting identity is a relation between the ordered set of a set S of n numbers and the minima of the 2n − 1 nonempty subsets of S.
Let S = {x1, x2, ..., xn} and 
 
 
 
 .
The identity states that



where 
 
 
 
  and the inner sum is over all possible samples of 
 
 
 
  elements of 
 
 
 
 , or conversely



provided that 
 
 
 
 .
Sorting identity automatically arranges its left-hand side in ascending order of 
 
 
 
  for the given right-hand side.
Sorting identity generalizes the maximum-minimums identity reduces to it in the limit 
 
 
 
 .
