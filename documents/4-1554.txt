   Bose gas      Bose gas   An ideal Bose gas is a quantum-mechanical version of a classical ideal gas . It is composed of bosons , which have an integer value of spin, and obey Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics . The statistical mechanics of bosons were developed by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons , and extended to massive particles by Albert Einstein who realized that an ideal gas of bosons would form a condensate at a low enough temperature, unlike a classical ideal gas. This condensate is known as a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate .  Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation  The thermodynamics of an ideal Bose gas is best calculated using the grand partition function . The grand partition function for a Bose gas is given by:       ùíµ   (  z  ,  Œ≤  ,  V  )    =    ‚àè  i     (   1  -   z   e   -   Œ≤   œµ  i        )    -   g  i            ùíµ   z  Œ≤  V      subscript  product  i    superscript    1    z   superscript  e      Œ≤   subscript  œµ  i           subscript  g  i        \mathcal{Z}(z,\beta,V)=\prod_{i}\left(1-ze^{-\beta\epsilon_{i}}\right)^{-g_{i}}     where each term in the product corresponds to a particular energy Œµ i , g i is the number of states with energy Œµ i , z is the absolute activity (or "fugacity"), which may also be expressed in terms of the chemical potential Œº by defining:       z   (  Œ≤  ,  Œº  )    =   e   Œ≤  Œº          z   Œ≤  Œº     superscript  e    Œ≤  Œº      z(\beta,\mu)=e^{\beta\mu}     and Œ≤ defined as:      Œ≤  =   1   k  T        Œ≤    1    k  T      \beta=\frac{1}{kT}     where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature . All thermodynamic quantities may be derived from the grand partition function and we will consider all thermodynamic quantities to be functions of only the three variables z , Œ≤ (or T ), and V . All partial derivatives are taken with respect to one of these three variables while the other two are held constant. It is more convenient to deal with the dimensionless grand potential defined as:       Œ©  =   -   ln   (  ùíµ  )     =    ‚àë  i     g  i    ln   (   1  -   z   e   -   Œ≤   œµ  i        )       .        normal-Œ©      ùíµ           subscript   i      subscript  g  i       1    z   superscript  e      Œ≤   subscript  œµ  i              \Omega=-\ln(\mathcal{Z})=\sum_{i}g_{i}\ln\left(1-ze^{-\beta\epsilon_{i}}\right).     Following the procedure described in the gas in a box article, we can apply the Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation which assumes that the average energy is large compared to the energy difference between levels so that the above sum may be replaced by an integral:       Œ©  ‚âà    ‚à´  0  ‚àû     ln   (   1  -   z   e   -   Œ≤  E       )    d  g     .      normal-Œ©    superscript   subscript   0           1    z   superscript  e      Œ≤  E        d  g      \Omega\approx\int_{0}^{\infty}\ln\left(1-ze^{-\beta E}\right)\,dg.     The degeneracy dg may be expressed for many different situations by the general formula:       d  g   =     1   Œì   (  Œ±  )         E    Œ±   -  1     E  c  Œ±     d  E         d  g       1    normal-Œì  Œ±       superscript  E    Œ±  1     superscript   subscript  E  c   Œ±    d  E     dg=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\,\frac{E^{\,\alpha-1}}{E_{c}^{\alpha}}~{}dE     where Œ± is a constant,    E  c     subscript  E  c    E_{c}   is a "critical energy", and Œì is the Gamma function . For example, for a massive Bose gas in a box , Œ±=3/2 and the critical energy is given by:       1    (   Œ≤   E  c    )   Œ±    =    V  f    Œõ  3          1   superscript    Œ≤   subscript  E  c    Œ±        V  f    superscript  normal-Œõ  3      \frac{1}{(\beta E_{c})^{\alpha}}=\frac{Vf}{\Lambda^{3}}     where Œõ is the thermal wavelength . For a massive Bose gas in a harmonic trap we will have Œ±=3 and the critical energy is given by:       1    (   Œ≤   E  c    )   Œ±    =   f    (   ‚Ñè  œâ  Œ≤   )   3          1   superscript    Œ≤   subscript  E  c    Œ±      f   superscript    Planck-constant-over-2-pi  œâ  Œ≤   3      \frac{1}{(\beta E_{c})^{\alpha}}=\frac{f}{(\hbar\omega\beta)^{3}}     where V(r)=mœâ 2 r 2 /2 is the harmonic potential. It is seen that E c is a function of volume only.  We can solve the equation for the grand potential by integrating the Taylor series of the integrand term by term, or by realizing that it is proportional to the Mellin transform of the Li 1 (z exp(-Œ≤ E)) where Li s (x) is the polylogarithm function. The solution is:       Œ©  ‚âà   -     Li   Œ±  +  1     (  z  )      (   Œ≤   E  c    )   Œ±      .      normal-Œ©         subscript  Li    Œ±  1    z    superscript    Œ≤   subscript  E  c    Œ±       \Omega\approx-\frac{\textrm{Li}_{\alpha+1}(z)}{\left(\beta E_{c}\right)^{%
 \alpha}}.     The problem with this continuum approximation for a Bose gas is that the ground state has been effectively ignored, giving a degeneracy of zero for zero energy. This inaccuracy becomes serious when dealing with the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate and will be dealt with in the next section.  Inclusion of the ground state  The total number of particles is found from the grand potential by      N  =   -   z    ‚àÇ  Œ©    ‚àÇ  z      ‚âà     Li  Œ±    (  z  )      (   Œ≤   E  c    )   Œ±          N      z      normal-Œ©     z                subscript  Li  Œ±   z    superscript    Œ≤   subscript  E  c    Œ±       N=-z\frac{\partial\Omega}{\partial z}\approx\frac{\textrm{Li}_{\alpha}(z)}{(%
 \beta E_{c})^{\alpha}}     The polylogarithm term must remain real and positive, and the maximum value it can possibly have is at z=1 where it is equal to Œ∂(Œ±) where Œ∂ is the Riemann zeta function . For a fixed N , the largest possible value that Œ≤ can have is a critical value Œ≤ c where      N  =    Œ∂   (  Œ±  )      (    Œ≤  c    E  c    )   Œ±        N      Œ∂  Œ±    superscript     subscript  Œ≤  c    subscript  E  c    Œ±      N=\frac{\zeta(\alpha)}{(\beta_{c}E_{c})^{\alpha}}     This corresponds to a critical temperature T c =1/kŒ≤ c below which the Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation breaks down. The above equation can be solved for the critical temperature:       T  c   =     (   N   Œ∂   (  Œ±  )     )    1  /  Œ±      E  c   k         subscript  T  c      superscript    N    Œ∂  Œ±      1  Œ±       subscript  E  c   k      T_{c}=\left(\frac{N}{\zeta(\alpha)}\right)^{1/\alpha}\frac{E_{c}}{k}     For example, for    Œ±  =   3  /  2       Œ±    3  2     \alpha=3/2   and using the above noted value of    E  c     subscript  E  c    E_{c}   yields       T  c   =     (   N   V  f  Œ∂   (   3  /  2   )     )    2  /  3      h  2    2  œÄ  m  k          subscript  T  c      superscript    N    V  f  Œ∂    3  2       2  3       superscript  h  2     2  œÄ  m  k       T_{c}=\left(\frac{N}{Vf\zeta(3/2)}\right)^{2/3}\frac{h^{2}}{2\pi mk}     Again, we are presently unable to calculate results below the critical temperature, because the particle numbers using the above equation become negative. The problem here is that the Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation has set the degeneracy of the ground state to zero, which is wrong. There is no ground state to accept the condensate and so the equation breaks down. It turns out, however, that the above equation gives a rather accurate estimate of the number of particles in the excited states, and it is not a bad approximation to simply "tack on" a ground state term:      N  =    N  0   +     Li  Œ±    (  z  )      (   Œ≤   E  c    )   Œ±         N     subscript  N  0        subscript  Li  Œ±   z    superscript    Œ≤   subscript  E  c    Œ±       N=N_{0}+\frac{\textrm{Li}_{\alpha}(z)}{(\beta E_{c})^{\alpha}}     where N 0 is the number of particles in the ground state condensate:       N  0   =      g  0    z    1  -  z         subscript  N  0        subscript  g  0   z     1  z      N_{0}=\frac{g_{0}\,z}{1-z}     (Figure)  Figure 1: Various Bose gas parameters as a function of normalized temperature œÑ. The value of Œ± is 3/2. Solid lines are for N=10,000, dotted lines are for N=1000. Black lines are the fraction of excited particles, blue are the fraction of condensed particles. The negative of the chemical potential Œº is shown in red, and green lines are the values of z. It has been assumed that k¬†=Œµ c =1.   This equation can now be solved down to absolute zero in temperature. Figure 1 shows the results of the solution to this equation for Œ±=3/2, with k=Œµ c =1 which corresponds to a gas of bosons in a box . The solid black line is the fraction of excited states 1-N 0 /N for N =10,000 and the dotted black line is the solution for N =1000. The blue lines are the fraction of condensed particles N 0 /N The red lines plot values of the negative of the chemical potential Œº and the green lines plot the corresponding values of z . The horizontal axis is the normalized temperature œÑ defined by      œÑ  =   T   T  c        œÑ    T   subscript  T  c      \tau=\frac{T}{T_{c}}     It can be seen that each of these parameters become linear in œÑ Œ± in the limit of low temperature and, except for the chemical potential, linear in 1/œÑ Œ± in the limit of high temperature. As the number of particles increases, the condensed and excited fractions tend towards a discontinuity at the critical temperature.  The equation for the number of particles can be written in terms of the normalized temperature as:      N  =       g  0    z    1  -  z    +    N       Li  Œ±    (  z  )     Œ∂   (  Œ±  )       œÑ  Œ±         N         subscript  g  0   z     1  z      N       subscript  Li  Œ±   z     Œ∂  Œ±     superscript  œÑ  Œ±       N=\frac{g_{0}\,z}{1-z}+N~{}\frac{\textrm{Li}_{\alpha}(z)}{\zeta(\alpha)}~{}%
 \tau^{\alpha}     For a given N and œÑ, this equation can be solved for œÑ Œ± and then a series solution for z can be found by the method of inversion of series , either in powers of œÑ Œ± or as an asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of œÑ Œ± . From these expansions, we can find the behavior of the gas near T¬†=0 and in the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann as T approaches infinity. In particular, we are interested in the limit as N approaches infinity, which can be easily determined from these expansions.  Thermodynamics  Adding the ground state to the equation for the particle number corresponds to adding the equivalent ground state term to the grand potential:      Œ©  =     g  0    ln   (   1  -  z   )     -     Li   Œ±  +  1     (  z  )      (   Œ≤   E  c    )   Œ±         normal-Œ©       subscript  g  0       1  z          subscript  Li    Œ±  1    z    superscript    Œ≤   subscript  E  c    Œ±       \Omega=g_{0}\ln(1-z)-\frac{\textrm{Li}_{\alpha+1}(z)}{\left(\beta E_{c}\right)%

 }{2^{\alpha}\tau^{\alpha}}        It is seen that all quantities approach the values for a classical ideal gas in the limit of large temperature. The above values can be used to calculate other thermodynamic quantities. For example, the relationship between internal energy and the product of pressure and volume is the same as that for a classical ideal gas over all temperatures:      U  =    ‚àÇ  Œ©    ‚àÇ  Œ≤    =   Œ±  P  V         U      normal-Œ©     Œ≤           Œ±  P  V      U=\frac{\partial\Omega}{\partial\beta}=\alpha PV     A similar situation holds for the specific heat at constant volume       C  v   =    ‚àÇ  U    ‚àÇ  T    =   k   (   Œ±  +  1   )   U  Œ≤          subscript  C  v       U     T           k    Œ±  1   U  Œ≤      C_{v}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}=k(\alpha+1)\,U\beta     The entropy is given by:       T  S   =    U  +   P  V    -   G          T  S       U    P  V    G     TS=U+PV-G\,     Note that in the limit of high temperature, we have       T  S   =    (   Œ±  +  1   )   +   ln   (    œÑ  Œ±    Œ∂   (  Œ±  )     )           T  S       Œ±  1        superscript  œÑ  Œ±     Œ∂  Œ±        TS=(\alpha+1)+\ln\left(\frac{\tau^{\alpha}}{\zeta(\alpha)}\right)     which, for Œ±=3/2 is simply a restatement of the Sackur‚ÄìTetrode equation .
