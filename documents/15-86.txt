   Tangential polygon      Tangential polygon   In Euclidean geometry , a tangential polygon , also known as a circumscribed polygon , is a convex polygon that contains an inscribed circle (also called an incircle ). This is a circle that is tangent to each of the polygon's sides. The dual polygon of a tangential polygon is a cyclic polygon , which has a circumscribed circle passing through each of its vertices .  All triangles are tangential, as are all regular polygons with any number of sides. A well-studied group of tangential polygons are the tangential quadrilaterals , which include the rhombi and kites .  Characterizations  A convex polygon has an incircle if and only if all of its internal angle bisectors are concurrent . This common point is the incenter (the center of the incircle). 1  There exists a tangential polygon of n sequential sides a 1 , ..., a n if and only if the system of equations         x  1   +   x  2    =   a  1    ,      x  2   +   x  3    =    a  2   ,  …    ,     x  n   +   x  1    =   a  n        formulae-sequence       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     subscript  a  1     formulae-sequence       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3      subscript  a  2   normal-…         subscript  x  n    subscript  x  1     subscript  a  n       x_{1}+x_{2}=a_{1},\quad x_{2}+x_{3}=a_{2},\quad\ldots,\quad x_{n}+x_{1}=a_{n}     has a solution ( x 1 , ..., x n ) in positive reals . 2 If such a solution exists, then x 1 , ..., x n are the tangent lengths of the polygon (the lengths from the vertices to the points where the incircle is tangent to the sides).  Uniqueness and non-uniqueness  If the number n of sides is odd, then for any given set of sidelengths     a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n       subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     a_{1},\dots,a_{n}   satisfying the existence criterion above there is only one tangential polygon. But if n is even there are an infinitude of them. 3 For example, in the quadrilateral case where all sides are equal we can have a rhombus with any value of the acute angles, and all rhombi are tangential to an incircle.  Inradius  If the n sides of a tangential polygon are a 1 , ..., a n , the inradius ( radius of the incircle) is 4      r  =   K  s   =    2  K     ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i           r    K  s            2  K     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  a  i        r=\frac{K}{s}=\frac{2K}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}}     where K is the area of the polygon and s is the semiperimeter . (Since all triangles are tangential, this formula applies to all triangles.)  Other properties   For a tangential polygon with an odd number of sides, all sides are equal if and only if all angles are equal (so the polygon is regular). A tangential polygon with an even number of sides has all sides equal if and only if the alternate angles are equal (that is, angles A , C , E , ... are equal, and angles B , D , F , ... are equal). 5  In a tangential polygon with an even number of sides, the sum of the odd numbered sides is equal to the sum of the even numbered sides. 6   Tangential triangle  While all triangles are tangential to some circle, a triangle is called the tangential triangle of a reference triangle if the tangencies of the tangential triangle with the circle are also the vertices of the reference triangle.  Tangential quadrilateral  Tangential hexagon   In a tangential hexagon  ABCDEF , the main diagonals  AD , BE , and CF are concurrent according to Brianchon's theorem .
