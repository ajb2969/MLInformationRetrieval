  parameter, and a gamma-distributed variable component, which has the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  parameters.4 The distribution is named for Pierre Delaporte, who analyzed it in relation to automobile accident claim counts in 1959,5 although it appeared in a different form as early as 1934 in a paper by Rolf von LÃ¼ders,6 where it was called the Formel II distribution.7
