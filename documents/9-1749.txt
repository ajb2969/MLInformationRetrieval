It is an adaptation of the p-chart and used in situations where personnel find it easier to interpret process performance in terms of concrete numbers of units rather than the somewhat more abstract proportion. 1  The np-chart differs from the p-chart in only the three following aspects:   The control limits are     n   p  ¯    ±   3    n   p  ¯    (   1  -   p  ¯    )         plus-or-minus    n   normal-¯  p      3      n   normal-¯  p     1   normal-¯  p         n\bar{p}\pm 3\sqrt{n\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}   , where n is the sample size and    p  ¯     normal-¯  p    \bar{p}   is the estimate of the long-term process mean established during control-chart setup.  The number nonconforming (np), rather than the fraction nonconforming (p), is plotted against the control limits.  The sample size,   n   n   n   , is constant.
