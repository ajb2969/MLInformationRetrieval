   Dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase      Dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase   In enzymology , a dolichyl-phosphate-mannose-protein mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dolichyl phosphate D-mannose + protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dolichyl phosphate + O-D-mannosylprotein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl phosphate D-mannose and protein , whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and O-D-mannosylprotein.  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-phosphate-D-mannose:protein O-D-mannosyltransferase . Other names in common use include dolichol phosphomannose-protein mannosyltransferase , and protein O-D-mannosyltransferase . A human gene that codes for this enzyme is POMT1 .
