   Graphical game theory      Graphical game theory   In game theory , the common ways to describe a game are the normal form and the extensive form . The graphical form is an alternate compact representation of a game using the interaction among participants.  Consider a game with   n   n   n   players with   m   m   m   strategies each. We will represent the players as nodes in a graph in which each player has a utility function that depends only on him and his neighbors. As the utility function depends on fewer other players, the graphical representation would be smaller.  Formal definition  A graphical game is represented by a graph   G   G   G   , in which each player is represented by a node, and there is an edge between two nodes   i   i   i   and   j   j   j   iff their utility functions are depended on the strategy which the other player will choose. Each node   i   i   i   in   G   G   G   has a function     u  i   :     {   1  …  m   }     d  i   +  1    →  ℝ      normal-:   subscript  u  i    normal-→   superscript     1  normal-…  m       subscript  d  i   1    ℝ     u_{i}:\{1\ldots m\}^{d_{i}+1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   , where    d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   is the degree of vertex   i   i   i   .    u  i     subscript  u  i    u_{i}   specifies the utility of player   i   i   i   as a function of his strategy as well as those of his neighbors.  The size of the game's representation  For a general   n   n   n   players game, in which each player has   m   m   m   possible strategies, the size of a normal form representation would be    O   (   m  n   )       O   superscript  m  n     O(m^{n})   . The size of the graphical representation for this game is    O   (   m  d   )       O   superscript  m  d     O(m^{d})   where   d   d   d   is the maximal node degree in the graph. If    d  ≪  n     much-less-than  d  n    d\ll n   , then the graphical game representation is much smaller.  An example  In case where each player's utility function depends only on one other player:  Image:GraphicalGameExample.png|The graphical form of the described game  The maximal degree of the graph is 1, and the game can be described as   n   n   n   functions (tables) of size    m  2     superscript  m  2    m^{2}   . So, the total size of the input will be    n   m  2       n   superscript  m  2     nm^{2}   .  Nash equilibrium  Finding Nash equilibrium in a game takes exponential time in the size of the representation. If the graphical representation of the game is a tree, we can find the equilibrium in polynomial time. In the general case, where the maximal degree of a node is 3 or more, the problem is NP-complete .  Further reading   Michael Kearns (2007) " Graphical Games ". In Algorithmic Game Theory, N.
