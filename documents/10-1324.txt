Vanillin dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a vanillin dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

 + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
   + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are vanillin, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are vanillate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is vanillin:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation.
