Double Mersenne number

In mathematics, a double Mersenne number is a Mersenne number of the form



where p is a Mersenne prime exponent.
Examples
The first four terms of the sequence of double Mersenne numbers are1 :












Double Mersenne primes
A double Mersenne number that is prime is called a double Mersenne prime. Since a Mersenne number Mp can be prime only if p is prime, (see Mersenne prime for a proof), a double Mersenne number 
 
 
 
  can be prime only if Mp is itself a Mersenne prime. The first values of p for which Mp is prime are p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127. Of these, 
 
 
 
  is known to be prime for p = 2, 3, 5, 7. For p = 13, 17, 19, and 31, explicit factors have been found showing that the corresponding double Mersenne numbers are not prime. Thus, the smallest candidate for the next double Mersenne prime is 
 
 
 
 , or 22305843009213693951 − 1. Being approximately 1.695
 
 
 
 , this number is far too large for any currently known primality test. It has no prime factor below 4×1033.2 There are probably no other double Mersenne primes than the four known.34
Catalan–Mersenne number conjecture

 . A special case of the double Mersenne numbers, namely the recursively defined sequence

2, M(2), M(M(2)), M(M(M(2))), M(M(M(M(2)))), ... 
 

is called the Catalan–Mersenne numbers.5 Catalan came up with this sequence after the discovery of the primality of M(127) = M(M(M(M(2)))) by Lucas in 1876.67 Catalan conjectured that they are prime "up to a certain limit". Although the first five terms (below M127) are prime, no known methods can prove that any further terms are prime (in any reasonable time) simply because they are too huge. However, if MM127 is not prime, there is a chance to discover this by computing MM127 modulo some small prime p (using recursive modular exponentiation).8
In popular culture
In the Futurama movie The Beast with a Billion Backs, the double Mersenne number 
 
 
 
  is briefly seen in "an elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture". In the movie, this number is known as a "martian prime".

 (probably collected by the editor). Almost all of the questions are signed by Édouard Lucas as is number 92:  The footnote (indicated by the star) written by the editor Eugène Catalan, is as follows: 
If the resulting residue is zero, p represents a factor of MM127 and thus would disprove its primality. Since MM127 is a Mersenne number, such prime factor p must be of the form 2·k·M127+1.
