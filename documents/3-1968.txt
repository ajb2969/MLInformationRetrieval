   Double Mersenne number      Double Mersenne number   In mathematics , a double Mersenne number is a Mersenne number of the form       M   M  p    =    2    2  p   -  1    -  1        subscript  M   subscript  M  p       superscript  2     superscript  2  p   1    1     M_{M_{p}}=2^{2^{p}-1}-1     where p is a Mersenne prime exponent.  Examples  The first four terms of the sequence of double Mersenne numbers are 1 :       M   M  2    =   M  3   =  7         subscript  M   subscript  M  2     subscript  M  3        7     M_{M_{2}}=M_{3}=7          M   M  3    =   M  7   =  127         subscript  M   subscript  M  3     subscript  M  7        127     M_{M_{3}}=M_{7}=127          M   M  5    =   M  31   =  2147483647         subscript  M   subscript  M  5     subscript  M  31        2147483647     M_{M_{5}}=M_{31}=2147483647          M   M  7    =   M  127   =  170141183460469231731687303715884105727         subscript  M   subscript  M  7     subscript  M  127        170141183460469231731687303715884105727     M_{M_{7}}=M_{127}=170141183460469231731687303715884105727     Double Mersenne primes  A double Mersenne number that is prime is called a double Mersenne prime . Since a Mersenne number M p can be prime only if p is prime, (see Mersenne prime for a proof), a double Mersenne number    M   M  p      subscript  M   subscript  M  p     M_{M_{p}}   can be prime only if M p is itself a Mersenne prime. The first values of p for which M p is prime are p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127. Of these,    M   M  p      subscript  M   subscript  M  p     M_{M_{p}}   is known to be prime for p = 2, 3, 5, 7. For p = 13, 17, 19, and 31, explicit factors have been found showing that the corresponding double Mersenne numbers are not prime. Thus, the smallest candidate for the next double Mersenne prime is    M   M  61      subscript  M   subscript  M  61     M_{M_{61}}   , or 2 2305843009213693951 − 1. Being approximately 1.695     ×    10  6   94127911065419641       absent     superscript  10  6   94127911065419641     \times 10^{6}94127911065419641   , this number is far too large for any currently known primality test . It has no prime factor below 4×10 33 . 2 There are probably no other double Mersenne primes than the four known. 3 4  Catalan–Mersenne number conjecture  Write    M   (  p  )       M  p    M(p)   instead of    M  p     subscript  M  p    M_{p}   . A special case of the double Mersenne numbers, namely the recursively defined sequence   2, M (2), M ( M (2)), M ( M ( M (2))), M ( M ( M ( M (2)))), ...   is called the Catalan–Mersenne numbers . 5  Catalan came up with this sequence after the discovery of the primality of M (127) = M ( M ( M ( M (2)))) by Lucas in 1876. 6 7 Catalan conjectured that they are prime "up to a certain limit". Although the first five terms (below M 127 ) are prime, no known methods can prove that any further terms are prime (in any reasonable time) simply because they are too huge. However, if M M 127 is not prime, there is a chance to discover this by computing M M 127  modulo some small prime p (using recursive modular exponentiation ). 8  In popular culture  In the Futurama movie The Beast with a Billion Backs , the double Mersenne number    M   M  7      subscript  M   subscript  M  7     M_{M_{7}}   is briefly seen in "an elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture ". In the movie, this number is known as a "martian prime".  See also   Perfect number  Fermat number  Wieferich prime  Double exponential function   References  Further reading    .
