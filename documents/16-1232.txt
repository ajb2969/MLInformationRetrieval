Arakawa–Kaneko zeta function

In mathematics, the Arakawa–Kaneko zeta function is a generalisation of the Riemann zeta function which generates special values of the polylogarithm function.
Definition
The zeta function 
 
 
 
  is defined by



where Lik is the k-th polylogarithm



Properties
The integral converges for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has analytic continuation to the whole complex plane as an entire function.
The special case k = 1 gives 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta-function.
The special case s = 1 remarkably also gives 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta-function.
The values at integers are related to multiple zeta function values by



where
