N-carbamoylsarcosine amidase




N-carbamoylsarcosine amidase

In enzymology, a N-carbamoylsarcosine amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-carbamoylsarcosine + H2O 
 
 
 
  sarcosine + CO2 + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-carbamoylsarcosine and H2O, whereas its 3 products are sarcosine, CO2, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called carbamoylsarcosine amidase. This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism.
