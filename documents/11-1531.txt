   L-arabinokinase      L-arabinokinase   In enzymology , a L-arabinokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-arabinose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + beta-L-arabinose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-arabinose , whereas its two products are ADP and beta-L-arabinose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-arabinose 1-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called L-arabinokinase (phosphorylating) . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
