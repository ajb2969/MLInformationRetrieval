15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase

In enzymology, a 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

15,16-dihydrobiliverdin + oxidized ferredoxin 
 
 
 
  biliverdin IXalpha + reduced ferredoxin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin and oxidized ferredoxin, whereas its two products are biliverdin IXalpha and reduced ferredoxin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called PebA. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
