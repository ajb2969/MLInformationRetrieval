Aristolochene synthase

In enzymology, an aristolochene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  aristolochene + diphosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl diphosphate, and two products, aristolochene and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-trans,6-trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, aristolochene-forming). Other names in common use include sesquiterpene cyclase, trans,trans-farnesyl diphosphate aristolochene-lyase, trans,trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing,, and aristolochene-forming). This enzyme participates in terpenoid biosynthesis.
This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation. 1
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and . They are both notable for the very high helix content of the structure.
