   Retention distance      Retention distance   Retention distance , or R D , is a concept in thin layer chromatography , designed for quantitative measurement of equal-spreading of the spots on the chromatographic plate and one of the Chromatographic response functions . It is calculated from the following formula:       R  D   =    [     (   n  +  1   )    (   n  +  1   )      ∏   i  =  0   n    (    R   F   (   i  +  1   )     -   R   F  i     )     ]    1  n         subscript  R  D    superscript   delimited-[]     superscript    n  1     n  1      subscript   superscript  product  n     i  0       subscript  R    F    i  1      subscript  R    F  i          1  n      R_{D}=\Bigg[(n+1)^{(n+1)}\prod^{n}_{i=0}{(R_{F(i+1)}-R_{Fi})\Bigg]^{\frac{1}{n%
 }}}     where n is the number of compounds separated, R f (1...n) are the Retention factor of the compounds sorted in non-descending order, R f0 = 0 and R f(n+1) = 1.  Theoretical considerations  The coefficient lies always in range  and 0 indicates worst case of separation (all R f values equal to 0 or 1), value 1 indicates ideal equal-spreading of the spots, for example (0.25,0.5,0.75) for three solutes, or (0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8) for four solutes.  This coefficient was proposed as an alternative to earlier approaches, such as delta-Rf, delta-Rf product or MRF (Multispot Response Function). Besides its stable range, the advantage is a stable distribution as a random variable, regardless of compounds investigated.  In contrast to the similar concept called Retention uniformity , R d is sensitive to R f values close to 0 or 1, or close to themselves. If two values are not separated, it is equal to 0. For example the R f values (0,0.2,0.2,0.3) (two compounds not separated at 0.2 and one at the start ) result in R D equal to 0, but R U equal to 0.3609. When some distance from 0 and spots occurs, the value is larger, for example R f values (0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3) give R D = 0.4835, R U = 0.4066.
