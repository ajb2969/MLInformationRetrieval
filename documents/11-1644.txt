   UTP—xylose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase      UTP—xylose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase   In enzymology , an UTP—xylose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UTP + alpha-D-xylose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + UDP-xylose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and alpha-D-xylose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and UDP-xylose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UTP:alpha-D-xylose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . Other names in common use include xylose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase , uridylyltransferase, xylose 1-phosphate , UDP-xylose pyrophosphorylase , uridine diphosphoxylose pyrophosphorylase , and xylose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.7  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
