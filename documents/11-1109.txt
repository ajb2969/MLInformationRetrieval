(R)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate—pyruvate transaminase

In enzymology, a (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate—pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate + pyruvate 
 
 
 
  2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate + L-alanine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate and pyruvate, whereas its two products are 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate and L-alanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate:pyruvate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include D-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate transaminase, beta-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase, D-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase, D-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate transaminase, (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate transaminase, and D-beta-aminoisobutyrate:pyruvate aminotransferase.
