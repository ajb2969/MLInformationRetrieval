   Steinberg formula      Steinberg formula   In mathematical representation theory , Steinberg's formula , introduced by , describes the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of a semisimple complex Lie algebra in a tensor product of two irreducible representations . It is a consequence of the Weyl character formula , and for the Lie algebra sl 2 it is essentially the Clebsch–Gordan formula .  Steinberg's formula states that the multiplicity of the irreducible representation of highest weight ν in the tensor product of the irreducible representations with highest weights λ and μ is given by       ∑    w  ,   w  ′    ∈  W     ϵ   (   w   w  ′    )   P   (     w   (   λ  +  ρ   )    +    w  ′    (   μ  +  ρ   )     -   (   ν  +   2  ρ    )    )        subscript      w   superscript  w  normal-′    W      ϵ    w   superscript  w  normal-′    P        w    λ  ρ       superscript  w  normal-′     μ  ρ       ν    2  ρ        \sum_{w,w^{\prime}\in W}\epsilon(ww^{\prime})P(w(\lambda+\rho)+w^{\prime}(\mu+%
 \rho)-(\nu+2\rho))     where W is the Weyl group , ε is the determinant of an element of the Weyl group, ρ is the Weyl vector , and P is the Kostant partition function giving the number of ways of writing a vector as a sum of positive roots.
