   PDE surface      PDE surface   PDE surfaces are used in geometric modelling and computer graphics for creating smooth surfaces conforming to a given boundary configuration. PDE surfaces utilise partial differential equations to generate a surface which usually satisfy a mathematical boundary value problem .  PDE surfaces were first introduced into the area of geometric modelling and computer graphics by two British mathematicians, Malcolm Bloor and Michael Wilson.  Technical details  The PDE method involves generating a surface for some boundary by means of solving an elliptic partial differential equation of the form         (     ∂  2    ∂   u  2     +    a  2     ∂  2    ∂   v  2       )   2   X   (  u  ,  v  )    =  0.         superscript       superscript   2      superscript  u  2        superscript  a  2      superscript   2      superscript  v  2       2   X   u  v    0.    \left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial u^{2}}+a^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial v^%
 {2}}\right)^{2}X(u,v)=0.     Here    X   (  u  ,  v  )       X   u  v     X(u,v)   is a function parameterised by the two parameters    u   u   u   and   v   v   v   such that     X   (  u  ,  v  )    =   (   x   (  u  ,  v  )    ,   y   (  u  ,  v  )    ,   z   (  u  ,  v  )    )         X   u  v       x   u  v      y   u  v      z   u  v       X(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))   where   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   and   z   z   z   are the usual cartesian coordinate space. The boundary conditions on the function    X   (  u  ,  v  )       X   u  v     X(u,v)   and its normal derivatives     ∂  X   /   ∂  n         X     n     \partial{X}/\partial{{n}}   are imposed at the edges of the surface patch.  With the above formulation it is notable that the elliptic partial differential operator in the above PDE represents a smoothing process in which the value of the function at any point on the surface is, in some sense, a weighted average of the surrounding values. In this way a surface is obtained as a smooth transition between the chosen set of boundary conditions . The parameter   a   a   a   is a special design parameter which controls the relative smoothing of the surface in the   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   directions.  Applications  PDE surfaces can be utilised in many application areas. These include computer-aided design , interactive design, parametric design, computer animation , computer-aided physical analysis and design optimisation.  References   M.I.G. Bloor and M.J.
