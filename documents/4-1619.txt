   Agoh–Giuga conjecture      Agoh–Giuga conjecture   In number theory the Agoh–Giuga conjecture on the Bernoulli numbers  B k postulates that p is a prime number  if and only if        p   B   p  -  1     ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     .        p   subscript  B    p  1      annotated    1    pmod  p      pB_{p-1}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     It is named after Takashi Agoh and Giuseppe Giuga .  Equivalent formulation  The conjecture as stated above is due to Takashi Agoh (1990); an equivalent formulation is due to Giuseppe Giuga , from 1950, to the effect that p is prime if        1   p  -  1    +   2   p  -  1    +  ⋯  +    (   p  -  1   )    p  -  1     ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )           superscript  1    p  1     superscript  2    p  1    normal-⋯   superscript    p  1     p  1      annotated    1    pmod  p      1^{p-1}+2^{p-1}+\cdots+(p-1)^{p-1}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     which may also be written as         ∑   i  =  1    p  -  1     i   p  -  1     ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     .        superscript   subscript     i  1      p  1     superscript  i    p  1      annotated    1    pmod  p      \sum_{i=1}^{p-1}i^{p-1}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     It is trivial to show that p being prime is sufficient for the second equivalence to hold, since if p is prime, Fermat's little theorem states that       a   p  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )         superscript  a    p  1     annotated  1   pmod  p      a^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     for    a  =   1  ,  2  ,  …  ,   p  -  1        a   1  2  normal-…    p  1      a=1,2,\dots,p-1   , and the equivalence follows, since      p  -  1   ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     .        p  1    annotated    1    pmod  p      p-1\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     Status  The statement is still a conjecture since it has not yet been proven that if a number n is not prime (that is, n is composite ), then the formula does not hold. It has been shown that a composite number n satisfies the formula if and only if it is both a Carmichael number and a Giuga number , and that if such a number exists, it has at least 13,800 digits (Borwein, Borwein, Borwein, Girgensohn 1996).  Relation to Wilson's theorem  The Agoh–Giuga conjecture bears a similarity to Wilson's theorem , which has been proven to be true. Wilson's theorem states that a number p is prime if and only if         (   p  -  1   )   !   ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     ,          p  1     annotated    1    pmod  p      (p-1)!\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p),     which may also be written as         ∏   i  =  1    p  -  1    i   ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     .        superscript   subscript  product    i  1      p  1    i    annotated    1    pmod  p      \prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     For an odd prime p we have         ∏   i  =  1    p  -  1     i   p  -  1     ≡    (   -  1   )    p  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     ,          superscript   subscript  product    i  1      p  1     superscript  i    p  1      superscript    1     p  1          annotated  1   pmod  p       \prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i^{p-1}\equiv(-1)^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p),     and for p=2 we have         ∏   i  =  1    p  -  1     i   p  -  1     ≡    (   -  1   )    p  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     .          superscript   subscript  product    i  1      p  1     superscript  i    p  1      superscript    1     p  1          annotated  1   pmod  p       \prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i^{p-1}\equiv(-1)^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     So, the truth of the Agoh–Giuga conjecture combined with Wilson's theorem would give: a number p is prime if and only if        ∑   i  =  1    p  -  1     i   p  -  1     ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )          superscript   subscript     i  1      p  1     superscript  i    p  1      annotated    1    pmod  p      \sum_{i=1}^{p-1}i^{p-1}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     and         ∏   i  =  1    p  -  1     i   p  -  1     ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     .        superscript   subscript  product    i  1      p  1     superscript  i    p  1      annotated  1   pmod  p      \prod_{i=1}^{p-1}i^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).
