Erythronolide synthase




Erythronolide synthase

In enzymology, an erythronolide synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

6 malonyl-CoA + propanoyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  7 CoA + 6-deoxyerythronolide b
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and propanoyl-CoA, whereas its two products are CoA and 6-deoxyerythronolide b.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:propanoyl-CoA malonyltransferase (cyclizing). Other names in common use include erythronolide condensing enzyme, and malonyl-CoA:propionyl-CoA malonyltransferase (cyclizing). This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of 12-, 14- and 16-membered macrolides.
