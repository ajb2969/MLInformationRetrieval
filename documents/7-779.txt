Porosimetry

Porosimetry is an analytical technique used to determine various quantifiable aspects of a material's porous nature, such as pore diameter, total pore volume, surface area, and bulk and absolute densities.
The technique involves the intrusion of a non-wetting liquid (often mercury) at high pressure into a material through the use of a porosimeter. The pore size can be determined based on the external pressure needed to force the liquid into a pore against the opposing force of the liquid's surface tension.
A force balance equation known as Washburn's equation for the above material having cylindrical pores is given as:1





 
  = pressure of liquid


 
  = pressure of gas


 
  = surface tension of liquid


 
  = contact angle of intrusion liquid


 
  = pore diameter
Since the technique is usually done under vacuum, the gas pressure begins at zero. The contact angle of mercury with most solids is between 135째 and 142째, so an average of 140째 can be taken without much error. The surface tension of mercury at 20 째C under vacuum is 480 mN/m. With the various substitutions, the equation becomes:



As pressure increases, so does the cumulative pore volume. From the cumulative pore volume, one can find the pressure and pore diameter where 50% of the total volume has been added to give the median pore diameter.
