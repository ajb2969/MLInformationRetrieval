   Porosimetry      Porosimetry   Porosimetry is an analytical technique used to determine various quantifiable aspects of a material's porous nature, such as pore diameter , total pore volume , surface area , and bulk and absolute densities .  The technique involves the intrusion of a non-wetting liquid (often mercury ) at high pressure into a material through the use of a porosimeter . The pore size can be determined based on the external pressure needed to force the liquid into a pore against the opposing force of the liquid's surface tension .  A force balance equation known as Washburn's equation for the above material having cylindrical pores is given as: 1        P  L   -   P  G    =    4  σ   cos  θ     D  P           subscript  P  L    subscript  P  G        4  σ    θ     subscript  D  P      P_{L}-P_{G}=\frac{4\sigma\cos\theta}{D_{P}}         P  L     subscript  P  L    P_{L}   = pressure of liquid      P  G     subscript  P  G    P_{G}   = pressure of gas     σ   σ   \sigma   = surface tension of liquid     θ   θ   \theta   = contact angle of intrusion liquid      D  P     subscript  D  P    D_{P}   = pore diameter  Since the technique is usually done under vacuum , the gas pressure begins at zero. The contact angle of mercury with most solids is between 135° and 142°, so an average of 140° can be taken without much error. The surface tension of mercury at 20 °C under vacuum is 480 mN / m . With the various substitutions, the equation becomes:       D  P   =       1470   kPa   ⋅  μ   m    P  L         subscript  D  P        normal-⋅    1470  kPa   μ   m    subscript  P  L      D_{P}=\frac{1470\ \text{kPa}\cdot\mu\text{m}}{P_{L}}     As pressure increases, so does the cumulative pore volume. From the cumulative pore volume, one can find the pressure and pore diameter where 50% of the total volume has been added to give the median pore diameter.
