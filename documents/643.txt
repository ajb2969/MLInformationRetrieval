   Repeat-accumulate code      Repeat-accumulate code   In computer science , repeat-accumulate codes (RA codes) are a low complexity class of error-correcting codes . They were devised so that their ensemble weight distributions are easy to derive. RA codes were introduced by Divsalar et al.  In an RA code, an information block of length   N   N   {N}   is repeated   q   q   {q}   times, scrambled by an interleaver of size    q  N      q  N    {qN}   , and then encoded by a rate 1 accumulator . The accumulator can be viewed as a truncated rate 1 recursive convolutional encoder with transfer function    1  /   (   1  +  D   )       1    1  D     {1/(1+D)}   , but Divsalar et al. prefer to think of it as a block code whose input block    (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n   )      subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n     {(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})}   and output block    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     {(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})}   are related by the formula     x  1   =   z  1        subscript  x  1    subscript  z  1     {x_{1}=z_{1}}   and     x  i   =    x   i  -  1    +   z  i         subscript  x  i      subscript  x    i  1     subscript  z  i      x_{i}=x_{i-1}+z_{i}   for    i  >  1      i  1    i>1   . The encoding time for RA codes is linear and their rate is    1  /  q      1  q    1/q   . They are nonsystematic.  Irregular Repeat Accumulate Codes  Irregular Repeat Accumulate (IRA) Codes are a derivative form of repeat accumulate (RA) codes where the repetition performed on the input bits is not equal for all bits. 1 For example, some bits may be repeated three (3) times during coding, while other bits may be repeated eight (8) times.  Systematic IRA codes are considered a form of LDPC code. Litigation over whether the DVB-S2 LDPC code is a form of IRA code is ongoing. 2 US patents 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781; and 8,284,833 are at issue.  Notes  References   D. Divsalar, H.
