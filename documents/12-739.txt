   Lichnerowicz formula      Lichnerowicz formula   The Lichnerowicz formula (also known as the Lichnerowicz–Weitzenböck formula ) is a fundamental equation in the analysis of spinors on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds . In dimension 4, it forms a piece of Seiberg–Witten theory and other aspects of gauge theory . It is named after noted mathematicians André Lichnerowicz who proved it in 1963, and Roland Weitzenböck . The formula gives a relationship between the Dirac operator and the Laplace–Beltrami operator acting on spinors, in which the scalar curvature appears in a natural way. The result is significant because it provides an interface between results from the study of elliptic partial differential equations , results concerning the scalar curvature, and results on spinors and spin structures.  Given a spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M and a spinor bundle  S , the Lichnerowicz formula states that on a section ψ of S ,        D  2   ψ   =      ∇  *   ∇   ψ   +    1  4    Sc  ψ            superscript  D  2   ψ        superscript  normal-∇    normal-∇   ψ       1  4    Sc  ψ       D^{2}\psi=\nabla^{*}\nabla\psi+\frac{1}{4}\operatorname{Sc}\psi   where Sc denotes the scalar curvature and     ∇  *   ∇      superscript  normal-∇    normal-∇    \nabla^{*}\nabla   is the connection Laplacian . More generally, given a complex spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M , a spinor bundle  W ± with section   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , and a connection A on its determinant line bundle  L , the Lichnerowicz formula is         D  A  *    D  A   ϕ   =      ∇  A  *    ∇  A    ϕ   +    1  4   R  ϕ   +    1  2    ⟨   F  A  +   ,  ϕ  ⟩      .         superscript   subscript  D  A      subscript  D  A   ϕ        superscript   subscript  normal-∇  A      subscript  normal-∇  A    ϕ       1  4   R  ϕ       1  2     superscript   subscript  F  A     ϕ       D_{A}^{*}D_{A}\phi=\nabla_{A}^{*}\nabla_{A}\phi+\frac{1}{4}R\phi+\frac{1}{2}%
