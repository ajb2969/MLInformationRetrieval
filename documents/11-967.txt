Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase




Phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase

In enzymology, a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phospholipid + 1,2-diacylglycerol 
 
 
 
  lysophospholipid + triacylglycerol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phospholipid and 1,2-diacylglycerol, whereas its two products are lysophospholipid and triacylglycerol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phospholipid:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol O-acyltransferase. This enzyme is also called PDAT. This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism.
