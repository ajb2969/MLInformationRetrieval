   Weakly normal subgroup      Weakly normal subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup    H   H   H   of a group    G   G   G   is said to be weakly normal if whenever     H  g   ≤    N  G    (  H  )         superscript  H  g      subscript  N  G   H     H^{g}\leq N_{G}(H)   , we have    g  ∈    N  G    (  H  )        g     subscript  N  G   H     g\in N_{G}(H)   .  Every pronormal subgroup is weakly normal.  References      "  Category:Subgroup properties
