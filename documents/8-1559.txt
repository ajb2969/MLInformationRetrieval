   Conjugate (algebra)      Conjugate (algebra)   In algebra , a conjugate is a binomial formed by negating the second term of a binomial. The conjugate of  is , where x and y are real numbers . If y is imaginary , the process is termed complex conjugation : the complex conjugate of  is , where a and b are real.  Differences of squares  In a commutative ring , an expression of the form       a  2   -   b  2        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2     a^{2}-b^{2}     can be factored to give       (   a  +  b   )    (   a  -  b   )         a  b     a  b     (a+b)(a-b)     where one factor is the conjugate of the other. This can be useful when trying to rationalize a denominator containing squares.
