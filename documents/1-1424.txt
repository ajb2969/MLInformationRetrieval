   Partial pressure      Partial pressure   In a mixture of gases , each gas has a partial pressure which is the hypothetical pressure of that gas if it alone occupied the volume of the mixture at the same temperature . 1 The total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas in the mixture.  It relies on the following isotherm relation:        V  x    V   t  o  t     =    p  x    p   t  o  t     =    n  x    n   t  o  t              subscript  V  x    subscript  V    t  o  t        subscript  p  x    subscript  p    t  o  t             subscript  n  x    subscript  n    t  o  t        \frac{V_{x}}{V_{tot}}=\frac{p_{x}}{p_{tot}}=\frac{n_{x}}{n_{tot}}     :* V x is the partial volume of any individual gas component (X)  :* V tot is the total volume in gas mixture  :* p x is the partial pressure of gas X  :* p tot is the total pressure of gas mixture  :* n x is the amount of substance of a gas (X)  :* n tot is the total amount of substance in gas mixture  The partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gas's molecules . Gases dissolve, diffuse, and react according to their partial pressures, and not according to their concentrations in gas mixtures or liquids.  This general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology. For example, the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration, and the amount that is toxic, is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone. This is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood.  Dalton's law of partial pressures  Dalton's law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture. 2 This equality arises from the fact that in an ideal gas the molecules are so far apart that they don't interact with each other. Most actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal. For example, given an ideal gas mixture of nitrogen (N 2 ), hydrogen (H 2 ) and ammonia (NH 3 ):      p  =    p   N  2    +   p   H  2    +   p   NH  3         p     subscript  p   subscript  normal-N  2     subscript  p   subscript  normal-H  2     subscript  p   subscript  NH  3       p=p_{{\mathrm{N}}_{2}}+p_{{\mathrm{H}}_{2}}+p_{{\mathrm{NH}}_{3}}         where:            p    p   p\,      = total pressure of the gas mixture         p   N  2      subscript  p   subscript  normal-N  2     p_{{\mathrm{N}}_{2}}      = partial pressure of nitrogen (N 2 )         p   H  2      subscript  p   subscript  normal-H  2     p_{{\mathrm{H}}_{2}}      = partial pressure of hydrogen (H 2 )         p   NH  3      subscript  p   subscript  NH  3     p_{{\mathrm{NH}}_{3}}      = partial pressure of ammonia (NH 3 )     Ideal gas mixtures  Ideally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules. That is, the mole fraction of an individual gas component in an ideal gas  mixture can be expressed in terms of the component's partial pressure or the moles of the component:       x  i   =    p  i   p   =    n  i   n          subscript  x  normal-i      subscript  p  normal-i   p           subscript  n  normal-i   n      x_{\mathrm{i}}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{i}}}{p}=\frac{n_{\mathrm{i}}}{n}     and the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression:       p  i   =    x  i   ⋅  p        subscript  p  normal-i    normal-⋅   subscript  x  normal-i   p     p_{\mathrm{i}}=x_{\mathrm{i}}\cdot p         where:            x  i     subscript  x  normal-i    x_{\mathrm{i}}      = mole fraction of any individual gas component in a gas mixture         p  i     subscript  p  normal-i    p_{\mathrm{i}}      = partial pressure of any individual gas component in a gas mixture         n  i     subscript  n  normal-i    n_{\mathrm{i}}      = moles of any individual gas component in a gas mixture        n   n   n      = total moles of the gas mixture        p   p   p      = total pressure of the gas mixture     The mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture. 3  Partial volume (Amagat's law of additive volume)  The partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture. It is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.  It can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction: 4       V  x   =    V   t  o  t    ×    p  x    p   t  o  t      =    V   t  o  t    ×    n  x    n   t  o  t             subscript  V  x      subscript  V    t  o  t       subscript  p  x    subscript  p    t  o  t              subscript  V    t  o  t       subscript  n  x    subscript  n    t  o  t         V_{x}=V_{tot}\times\frac{p_{x}}{p_{tot}}=V_{tot}\times\frac{n_{x}}{n_{tot}}     :* V x is the partial volume of an individual gas component X in the mixture  :* V tot is the total volume of the gas mixture  :* p x is the partial pressure of gas X  :* p tot is the total pressure of the gas mixture  :* n x is the amount of substance of gas X  :* n tot is the total amount of substance in the gas mixture  Vapor pressure  (Figure)  301 px|A typical vapor pressure chart for various liquids   Vapor pressure is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases (i.e., liquid or solid). Most often the term is used to describe a liquid 's tendency to evaporate . It is a measure of the tendency of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid . A liquid's atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the normal boiling point .  The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.  The vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. 5 As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.  For example, at any given temperature, methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (-24.2 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ( atm ) of absolute vapor pressure.  Equilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtures  It is possible to work out the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:         a   A   +    b   B    ↔     c   C   +    d   D       normal-↔      a  A     b  B        c  C     d  D      a\,A+b\,B\leftrightarrow c\,C+d\,D     the equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:       K  p   =      p  C  c     p  D  d       p  A  a     p  B  b          subscript  K  p        superscript   subscript  p  C   c    superscript   subscript  p  D   d       superscript   subscript  p  A   a    superscript   subscript  p  B   b       K_{p}=\frac{p_{C}^{c}\,p_{D}^{d}}{p_{A}^{a}\,p_{B}^{b}}         where:            K  p     subscript  K  p    K_{p}      =  the equilibrium constant of the reaction        a   a   a      =  coefficient of reactant   A   A   A           b   b   b      =  coefficient of reactant   B   B   B           c   c   c      =  coefficient of product   C   C   C           d   d   d      =  coefficient of product   D   D   D            p  C  c     superscript   subscript  p  C   c    p_{C}^{c}      =  the partial pressure of   C   C   C   raised to the power of   c   c   c            p  D  d     superscript   subscript  p  D   d    p_{D}^{d}      =  the partial pressure of   D   D   D   raised to the power of   d   d   d            p  A  a     superscript   subscript  p  A   a    p_{A}^{a}      =  the partial pressure of   A   A   A   raised to the power of   a   a   a            p  B  b     superscript   subscript  p  B   b    p_{B}^{b}      =  the partial pressure of   B   B   B   raised to the power of   b   b   b        For reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle . However, the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.  Henry's Law and the solubility of gases  Gases will dissolve in liquids to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid (called the solvent ). 6 The equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:   (1)    k  =    p  x    C  x        k     subscript  p  x    subscript  C  x      k=\frac{p_{x}}{C_{x}}            where:           k   k   k      =  the equilibrium constant for the solvation process         p  x     subscript  p  x    p_{x}      =  partial pressure of gas   x   x   x   in equilibrium with a solution containing some of the gas         C  x     subscript  C  x    C_{x}      =  the concentration of gas   x   x   x   in the liquid solution       The form of the equilibrium constant shows that the concentration of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution . This statement is known as Henry's Law and the equilibrium constant   k   k   k   is quite often referred to as the Henry's Law constant. 7 8 9  Henry's Law is sometimes written as: 10   (2)     k  ′   =    C  x    p  x         superscript  k  normal-′      subscript  C  x    subscript  p  x      k^{\prime}=\frac{C_{x}}{p_{x}}      where    k  ′     superscript  k  normal-′    k^{\prime}   is also referred to as the Henry's Law constant. 11 As can be seen by comparing equations (1) and (2) above,    k  ′     superscript  k  normal-′    k^{\prime}   is the reciprocal of   k   k   k   . Since both may be referred to as the Henry's Law constant, readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the Henry's Law equation is being used.  Henry's Law is an approximation that only applies for dilute, ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not react chemically with the gas being dissolved.  Partial pressure in diving breathing gases  In recreational diving and professional diving the richness of individual component gases of breathing gases is expressed by partial pressure.  Using diving terms, partial pressure is calculated as:   partial pressure = (total absolute pressure) × (volume fraction of gas component)    For the component gas "i":   ppi = P × Fi    For example, at , the total absolute pressure is  (i.e., 1 bar of atmospheric pressure + 5 bar of water pressure) and the partial pressures of the main components of air , oxygen 21% by volume and nitrogen 79% by volume are:   ppN2 = 6 bar × 0.79 = 4.7 bar absolute  ppO2 = 6 bar × 0.21 = 1.3 bar absolute       where:        ppi  partial pressure of gas component i      P  i     subscript  P  normal-i    P_{\mathrm{i}}   in the terms used in this article     P  total pressure     P   P   P   in the terms used in this article     Fi  volume fraction of gas component i  mole fraction,    x  i     subscript  x  normal-i    x_{\mathrm{i}}   , in the terms used in this article     ppN2  partial pressure of nitrogen      P   N  2      subscript  P   subscript  normal-N  2     P_{{\mathrm{N}}_{2}}   in the terms used in this article     ppO2  partial pressure of oxygen      P   O  2      subscript  P   subscript  normal-O  2     P_{{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}   in the terms used in this article     The minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a gas mixture is  absolute. Hypoxia and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity , involving convulsions, becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high. The NOAA Diving Manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute, of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute, of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute, of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded. The partial pressure of oxygen determines the maximum operating depth of a gas mixture.  Nitrogen narcosis is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure. Typically, the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for technical diving is 4.5 bar absolute, based on an equivalent narcotic depth of .  In medicine  The partial pressures of particularly oxygen (    p   O  2      subscript  p   subscript  normal-O  2     p_{{\mathrm{O}}_{2}}   ) and carbon dioxide (    p   CO  2      subscript  p   subscript  CO  2     p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}}   ) are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases , but can also be measured in, for example, cerebrospinal fluid .
