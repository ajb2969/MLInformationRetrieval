Monin–Obukhov length

The Obukhov length is used to describe the effects of buoyancy on turbulent flows, particularly in the lower tenth of the atmospheric boundary layer. It was first defined by Alexander Obukhov1 in 1946.23 It is also known as the Monin–Obukhov length because of its important role in the similarity theory developed by Monin and Obukhov.4
The Obukhov length is defined by



where 
 
 
 
  is the frictional velocity, 
 
 
 
  is the mean virtual potential temperature, 
 
 
 
 
  is the surface virtual potential temperature flux, k is the von Kármán constant. The virtual potential temperature flux is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is potential temperature, 
 
 
 
  is absolute temperature and 
 
 
 
  is specific humidity.
By this definition, 
 
 
 
 
  is usually negative in the daytime since 
 
 
 
  is typically positive during the daytime over land, positive at night when 
 
 
 
  is typically negative, and becomes infinite at dawn and dusk when 
 
 
 
  passes through zero.
A physical interpretation of 
 
 
 
  is given by the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. During the day 
 
 
 
 
  it is the height at which the buoyant production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).
