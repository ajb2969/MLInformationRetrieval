   Monin–Obukhov length      Monin–Obukhov length   The Obukhov length is used to describe the effects of buoyancy on turbulent flows, particularly in the lower tenth of the atmospheric boundary layer . It was first defined by Alexander Obukhov 1 in 1946. 2 3 It is also known as the Monin–Obukhov length because of its important role in the similarity theory developed by Monin and Obukhov. 4  The Obukhov length is defined by      L  =   -     u  *  3     θ  ¯   v     k  g    (     w    ′     θ  v    ′     ¯   )   s          L         subscript   superscript  u  3      subscript   normal-¯  θ   v      k  g   subscript   normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     subscript   superscript  θ   normal-′    v     s        L=-\frac{u^{3}_{*}\bar{\theta}_{v}}{kg(\overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{^{\prime%
 }}_{v}})_{s}}     where    u  *     subscript  u     u_{*}   is the frictional velocity ,     θ  ¯   v     subscript   normal-¯  θ   v    \bar{\theta}_{v}   is the mean virtual potential temperature ,     (     w    ′     θ  v    ′     ¯   )   s     subscript   normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     subscript   superscript  θ   normal-′    v     s    (\overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{^{\prime}}_{v}})_{s}   is the surface virtual potential temperature flux, k is the von Kármán constant . The virtual potential temperature flux is given by         w    ′     θ  v    ′     ¯   =      w    ′     θ    ′     ¯   +   0.61    T  ¯       w    ′     q    ′     ¯          normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     subscript   superscript  θ   normal-′    v        normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     superscript  θ   normal-′        0.61   normal-¯  T    normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     superscript  q   normal-′          \overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{^{\prime}}_{v}}=\overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{%
 ^{\prime}}}+0.61\overline{T}\;\overline{w^{^{\prime}}q^{^{\prime}}}     where   θ   θ   \theta   is potential temperature,    T  ¯     normal-¯  T    \overline{T}   is absolute temperature and   q   q   q   is specific humidity.  By this definition,   L   L   L   is usually negative in the daytime since      w    ′     θ  v    ′     ¯     normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     subscript   superscript  θ   normal-′    v      \overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{^{\prime}}_{v}}   is typically positive during the daytime over land, positive at night when      w    ′     θ  v    ′     ¯     normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     subscript   superscript  θ   normal-′    v      \overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{^{\prime}}_{v}}   is typically negative, and becomes infinite at dawn and dusk when      w    ′     θ  v    ′     ¯     normal-¯     superscript  w   normal-′     subscript   superscript  θ   normal-′    v      \overline{w^{^{\prime}}\theta^{^{\prime}}_{v}}   passes through zero.  A physical interpretation of   L   L   L   is given by the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. During the day    -  L      L    -L   it is the height at which the buoyant production of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).
