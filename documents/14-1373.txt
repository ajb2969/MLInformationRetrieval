   Big q-Jacobi polynomials      Big q-Jacobi polynomials   In mathematics, the big q -Jacobi polynomials  P n ( x ; a , b , c ; q ), introduced by , are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme .  give a detailed list of their properties.  Definition  The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions by        P  n    (  x  ;  a  ,  b  ,  c  ;  q  )    =    ϕ  2    3     (   q   -  n    ,   a  b   q   n  +  1     ,  x  ;   a  q   ,   c  q   ;  q  ,  q  )           subscript  P  n    x  a  b  c  q       subscript   subscript  ϕ  2   3     superscript  q    n      a  b   superscript  q    n  1     x    a  q     c  q   q  q      \displaystyle P_{n}(x;a,b,c;q)={}_{3}\phi_{2}(q^{-n},abq^{n+1},x;aq,cq;q,q)     Orthogonality  Recurrence and difference relations  Rodrigues formula  Generating function  Relation to other polynomials  References        "  Category:Orthogonal polynomials  Category:Q-analogs  Category:Special hypergeometric functions
