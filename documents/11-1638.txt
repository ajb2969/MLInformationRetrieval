   Cytochrome c oxidase subunit III      Cytochrome c oxidase subunit III   Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MT-CO3  gene . 1  Cytochrome c oxidase subunit III is one of main transmembrane subunits of cytochrome c oxidase .  Function  Cytochrome c oxidase () is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain of mitochondria and many aerobic bacteria. It catalyzes the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen:   4 cytochrome c +2 + 4 H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4 cytochrome c +3 + 2 H 2 O   This reaction is coupled to the pumping of four additional protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. 2 3  Cytochrome c oxidase is an oligomeric enzymatic complex that is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane of eukaryotes and in the plasma membrane of aerobic prokaryotes. The core structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase contains three common subunits, I , II and III . In prokaryotes, subunits I and III can be fused and a fourth subunit is sometimes found, whereas in eukaryotes there are a variable number of additional small subunits. 4  As the bacterial respiratory systems are branched, they have a number of distinct terminal oxidases, rather than the single cytochrome c oxidase present in the eukaryotic mitochondrial systems. Although the cytochrome o oxidases do not catalyze the cytochrome c but the quinol (ubiquinol) oxidation they belong to the same haem-copper oxidase superfamily as cytochrome c oxidases. Members of this family share sequence similarities in all three core subunits: subunit I is the most conserved subunit, whereas subunit II is the least conserved. 5 6 7  Clinical significance  Mutations in mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit genes have been observed to be associated with isolated myopathy or severe encephalomyopathy. 8  Subfamilies   Cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase, subunit III  Cytochrome aa3 quinol oxidase, subunit III   References  Further reading                        External links   GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP   "  Category:Protein domains  Category:Protein families  Category:Transmembrane proteins     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
