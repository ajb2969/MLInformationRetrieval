   Wheel theory      Wheel theory   Wheels are a type of algebra where division is always defined. In particular, division by zero is meaningful. The real numbers can be extended to a wheel, as can any commutative ring .  Also the Riemann sphere can be extended to a wheel by adjoining an element    0  /  0      0  0    0/0   . The Riemann sphere is an extension of the complex plane by an element   ∞     \infty   , where     z  /  0   =  ∞        z  0      z/0=\infty   for any complex    z  ≠  0      z  0    z\neq 0   . However,    0  /  0      0  0    0/0   is still undefined on the Riemann sphere, but defined in wheels.  The algebra of wheels  Wheels discard the usual notion of division being a binary operator , replacing it with multiplication by a unary operator      /  x      absent  x    /x   similar (but not identical) to the multiplicative inverse     x   -  1      superscript  x    1     x^{-1}   , such that    a  /  b      a  b    a/b   becomes shorthand for    a  ⋅  /  b  =  /  b  ⋅  a     fragments  a  normal-⋅   b    b  normal-⋅  a    a\cdot/b=/b\cdot a   , and modifies the rules of algebra such that        0  x   ≠  0        0  x   0    0x\neq 0   in the general case.       x  -  x   ≠  0        x  x   0    x-x\neq 0   in the general case.       x  /  x   ≠  1        x  x   1    x/x\neq 1   in the general case, as     /  x      absent  x    /x   is not the same as the multiplicative inverse of   x   x   x   .   Precisely, a wheel is an algebraic structure with operations binary addition   +     +   , multiplication   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   , constants 0, 1 and unary   /     /   , satisfying:   Addition and multiplication are commutative and associative , with 0 and 1 as their respective identities.      /   (  x  y  )   =  /  x  /  y     fragments    fragments  normal-(  x  y  normal-)     x   y    /(xy)=/x/y   and    /  /  x  =  x     fragments    x   x    //x=x           x  z   +   y  z    =     (   x  +  y   )   z   +   0  z            x  z     y  z          x  y   z     0  z      xz+yz=(x+y)z+0z           (   x  +   y  z    )   /  y   =    x  /  y   +  z  +   0  y            x    y  z    y       x  y   z    0  y      (x+yz)/y=x/y+z+0y          0  ⋅  0   =  0       normal-⋅  0  0   0    0\cdot 0=0           (   x  +   0  y    )   z   =    x  z   +   0  y            x    0  y    z       x  z     0  y      (x+0y)z=xz+0y         /   (  x  +  0  y  )   =  /  x  +  0  y     fragments    fragments  normal-(  x   0  y  normal-)     x   0  y    /(x+0y)=/x+0y           0  /  0   +  x   =   0  /  0           0  0   x     0  0     0/0+x=0/0      If there is an element   a   a   a   with     1  +  a   =  0        1  a   0    1+a=0   , then we may define negation by     -  x   =   a  x         x     a  x     -x=ax   and     x  -  y   =   x  +   (   -  y   )          x  y     x    y      x-y=x+(-y)   .  Other identities that may be derived are         0  x   +   0  y    =   0  x  y           0  x     0  y      0  x  y     0x+0y=0xy          x  -  x   =   0   x  2          x  x     0   superscript  x  2      x-x=0x^{2}          x  /  x   =   1  +    0  x   /  x          x  x     1      0  x   x      x/x=1+0x/x      However, if     0  x   =  0        0  x   0    0x=0   and     0  /  x   =  0        0  x   0    0/x=0   we get the usual        x  -  x   =  0        x  x   0    x-x=0          x  /  x   =  1        x  x   1    x/x=1      The subset    {  x  ∣    0  x   =  0   }     conditional-set  x      0  x   0     \{x\mid 0x=0\}   is always a commutative ring if negation can be defined as above, and every commutative ring is such a subset of a wheel. If   x   x   x   is an invertible element of the commutative ring, then     x   -  1    =  /  x     fragments   superscript  x    1      x    x^{-1}=/x   . Thus, whenever    x   -  1      superscript  x    1     x^{-1}   makes sense, it is equal to     /  x      absent  x    /x   , but the latter is always defined, even when    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   .
