   Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase      Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase   In enzymology , a Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + [Fas-activated serine/threonine protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [Fas-activated serine/threonine phosphoprotein]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and Fas-activated serine/threonine protein , whereas its two products are ADP and Fas-activated serine/threonine phosphoprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups protein-serine/threonine kinases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[Fas-activated serine/threonine protein] phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include FAST , FASTK , and STK10 .
