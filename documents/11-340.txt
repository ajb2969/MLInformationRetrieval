   Guanosine-5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate diphosphatase      Guanosine-5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate diphosphatase   In enzymology , a guanosine-5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   guanosine 5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   guanosine 5'-diphosphate,3'-diphosphate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are guanosine 5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are guanosine 5'-diphosphate,3'-diphosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is guanosine-5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate 5'-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include pppGpp 5'-phosphohydrolase , guanosine-5'-triphosphate,3'-diphosphate pyrophosphatase , guanosine 5'-triphosphate-3'-diphosphate 5'-phosphohydrolase , guanosine pentaphosphatase , guanosine pentaphosphate phosphatase , guanosine 5'-triphosphate 3'-diphosphate 5'-phosphatase , and guanosine pentaphosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
