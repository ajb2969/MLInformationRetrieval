   Square pyramid      Square pyramid   In geometry , a square pyramid is a pyramid having a square base. If the apex is perpendicularly above the center of the square, it will have C 4v symmetry.  Johnson solid (J1)  If the sides are all equilateral triangles , the pyramid is one of the Johnson solids (J 1 ). The 92 Johnson solids were named and described by Norman Johnson in 1966.  The Johnson square pyramid can be characterized by a single edge-length parameter a . The height H (from the midpoint of the square to the apex), the surface area A (including all five faces), and the volume V of such a pyramid are:      H  =    1   2    a       H      1    2    a     H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}a         A  =    (   1  +   3    )    a  2        A      1    3     superscript  a  2      A=(1+\sqrt{3})a^{2}          V  =     2   6    a  3     .      V        2   6    superscript  a  3      V=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{6}a^{3}.     Other square pyramids  Other square pyramids have isosceles triangle sides.  For square pyramids in general, with base length l and height h , the surface area and volume are:      A  =    l  2   +   l     l  2   +    (   2  h   )   2           A     superscript  l  2     l       superscript  l  2    superscript    2  h   2         A=l^{2}+l\sqrt{l^{2}+(2h)^{2}}          V  =    1  3    l  2   h    .      V      1  3    superscript  l  2   h     V=\frac{1}{3}l^{2}h.

The tetrakis hexahedron can be constructed from a cube with short square pyramids added to each face.   Square frustum is a square pyramid with the apex truncated.     Square pyramid fill the space with tetrahedron or truncated cube or cuboctahedron . 1  Dual polyhedron  The square pyramid is topologically a self-dual polyhedron . The dual edge lengths are different due to the polar reciprocation .      Dual Square pyramid   Net of dual      (Figure)  Dual square pyramid.png   (Figure)  Dual square pyramid net.png      Topology  Like all pyramids, the square pyramid is self-dual , having the same number of vertices as faces.  A square pyramid can be represented by the Wheel graph W 5 .
