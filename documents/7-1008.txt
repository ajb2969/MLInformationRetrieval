   Half power point      Half power point   The half power point of an electronic amplifier stage is that frequency at which the output power has dropped to half of its mid-band value. That is a level of -3 dB . The half power point is a commonly used specific definition of cutoff frequency , although not the only one.  This occurs when the output voltage has dropped by 1/√2 or 0.707 of the maximum output voltage (exact     20    log  10    (    1   2     )     ≈   -    3.0103   dB          20    subscript   10     1    2          3.0103  dB      20\log_{10}\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\approx-3.0103\,\mathrm{dB}   ) and the power has dropped by half (1/2 or 0.5) (exact     10    log  10    (    1  2    )     ≈   -    3.0103   dB          10    subscript   10     1  2         3.0103  dB      10\log_{10}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\approx-3.0103\,\mathrm{dB}   ). A bandpass amplifier will have 2 half power points, whilst a low pass amplifier will have only one. A high pass amplifier stage will have only the lower half power point.  The bandwidth of an amplifier is usually defined as the difference between the lower and upper half power points. This is therefore also known as the −3 dB bandwidth.  3 dB  The half power point is approximately 3 dB because       log  10   2   =  .3010...  ≈  .3   ,          subscript   10   2   .3010...       .3     \log_{10}2=.3010...\approx.3,   so      10    log  10   2    =  3.010...  ≈  3   ;          10    subscript   10   2    3.010...       3     10\log_{10}2=3.010...\approx 3;   the decibel measure of a ratio r is defined as     10    log  10   r    .      10    subscript   10   r     10\log_{10}r.     Using 3 dB rather than the correct value of 3.010... yields a power factor of    G  =    10   3  10    ×   1    =  1.99526...  ≈   2         G     superscript  10    3  10    1        1.99526...       2     G=10^{\frac{3}{10}}\times 1\ =1.99526...\approx 2\,   which differs from a factor of 2 by about 0.24%. As logarithmic errors add, using 6 dB to approximate a factor of 4 difference yields an error of about 0.48%, and so forth.  This is the same mathematical coincidence as      2  10   =  1   ,    024  ≈  1   ,   000  =   10  3        formulae-sequence     superscript  2  10   1    formulae-sequence    024  1     000   superscript  10  3       2^{10}=1,024\approx 1,000=10^{3}   , which is the source of the ambiguity of the prefixes kilo- , mega- , etc. in a computing context. Taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation     2  10   ≈   10  3        superscript  2  10    superscript  10  3     2^{10}\approx 10^{3}   yields     10    log  10   2    ≈  3        10    subscript   10   2    3    10\log_{10}2\approx 3   .  Antennas  The half power point or 3 dB point of an antenna beam is the angle off boresight at which the antenna gain has fallen 3 dB below the peak.
