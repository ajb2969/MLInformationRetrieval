   Collage theorem      Collage theorem   In mathematics , the collage theorem characterises an iterated function system whose attractor is close, relative to the Hausdorff metric , to a given set. The IFS described is composed of contractions whose images, as a collage or union when mapping the given set, are arbitrarily close to the given set. It is typically used in fractal compression .  Statement of the theorem  Let   𝕏   𝕏   \mathbb{X}   be a complete metric space . Suppose   L   L   L   is a nonempty, compact subset of   𝕏   𝕏   \mathbb{X}   and let    ϵ  ≥  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon\geq 0   be given. Choose an iterated function system (IFS)    {  𝕏  ;   w  1   ,   w  2   ,  …  ,   w  N   }     𝕏   subscript  w  1    subscript  w  2   normal-…   subscript  w  N     \{\mathbb{X};w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{N}\}   with contractivity factor    0  ≤  s  <  1        0  s       1     0\leq s<1   , (The contractivity factor of the IFS is the maximum of the contractivity factors of the maps    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   .) Suppose        h   (  L  ,    ⋃   n  =  1   N     w  n    (  L  )     )    ≤  ε   ,        h   L    superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  w  n   L      ε    h\left(L,\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}w_{n}(L)\right)\leq\varepsilon,     where    h   (  d  )       h  d    h(d)   is the Hausdorff metric. Then       h   (  L  ,  A  )    ≤   ε   1  -  s          h   L  A      ε    1  s      h(L,A)\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{1-s}     where A is the attractor of the IFS. Equivalently,        h   (  L  ,  A  )    ≤     (   1  -  s   )    -  1    h   (  L  ,    ∪   n  =  1   N     w  n    (  L  )     )           h   L  A       superscript    1  s     1    h   L    superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  w  n   L        h(L,A)\leq(1-s)^{-1}h\left(L,\cup_{n=1}^{N}w_{n}(L)\right)\quad   , for all nonempty, compact subsets L of   𝕏   𝕏   \mathbb{X}   .  Informally, If   L   L   L   is close to being stabilized by the IFS, then   L   L   L   is also close to being the attractor of the IFS.
