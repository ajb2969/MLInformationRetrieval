Collage theorem

In mathematics, the collage theorem characterises an iterated function system whose attractor is close, relative to the Hausdorff metric, to a given set. The IFS described is composed of contractions whose images, as a collage or union when mapping the given set, are arbitrarily close to the given set. It is typically used in fractal compression.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a complete metric space. Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a nonempty, compact subset of 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be given. Choose an iterated function system (IFS) 
 
 
 
  with contractivity factor 
 
 
 
 , (The contractivity factor of the IFS is the maximum of the contractivity factors of the maps 
 
 
 
 .) Suppose



where 
 
 
 
  is the Hausdorff metric. Then



where A is the attractor of the IFS. Equivalently,


 
 , for all nonempty, compact subsets L of 
 
 
 
 .
Informally, If 
 
 
 
  is close to being stabilized by the IFS, then 
 
 
 
  is also close to being the attractor of the IFS.
