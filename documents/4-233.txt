   2–3 heap      2–3 heap   In computer science , a 2–3 heap is a data structure , a variation on the heap , designed by Tadao Takaoka in 1999. The structure is similar to the Fibonacci heap , and borrows from the 2–3 tree .  Time costs for some common heap operations are:   Delete-min takes    O   (   l  o  g   (  n  )    )       O    l  o  g  n     O(log(n))    amortized time .  Decrease-key takes constant amortized time.  Insertion takes constant amortized time.   References   Tadao Takaoka. Theory of 2–3 Heaps , Cocoon (1999).   "  Category:Heaps (data structures)
