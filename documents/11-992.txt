   Taxadien-5alpha-ol O-acetyltransferase      Taxadien-5alpha-ol O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a taxadien-5alpha-ol O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-ol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-yl acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-ol , whereas its two products are CoA and taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-yl acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-ol O-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include acetyl coenzyme A:taxa-4(20),11(12)-dien-5alpha-ol O-acetyl , and transferase . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis .
