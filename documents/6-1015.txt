   Hermitian manifold      Hermitian manifold   In mathematics , a Hermitian manifold is the complex analogue of a Riemannian manifold . Specifically, a Hermitian manifold is a complex manifold with a smoothly varying Hermitian  inner product on each (holomorphic) tangent space . One can also define a Hermitian manifold as a real manifold with a Riemannian metric that preserves a complex structure .  A complex structure is essentially an almost complex structure with an integrability condition, and this condition yields an unitary structure ( U(n) structure ) on the manifold. By dropping this condition we get an almost Hermitian manifold .  On any almost Hermitian manifold we can introduce a fundamental 2-form , or cosymplectic structure , that depends only on the chosen metric and almost complex structure. This form is always non-degenerate, with the suitable integrability condition (of it also being closed and thus a symplectic form ) we get an almost Kähler structure . If both almost complex structure and fundamental form are integrable, we have a Kähler structure .  Formal definition  A Hermitian metric on a complex vector bundle  E over a smooth manifold  M is a smoothly varying positive-definite  Hermitian form on each fiber. Such a metric can be written as a smooth section      h  ∈   Γ    (   E  ⊗   E  ¯    )   *        h    normal-Γ   superscript   tensor-product  E   normal-¯  E         h\in\Gamma(E\otimes\bar{E})^{*}   such that        h  p    (  η  ,   ζ  ¯   )    =     h  p    (  ζ  ,   η  ¯   )    ¯          subscript  h  p    η   normal-¯  ζ      normal-¯     subscript  h  p    ζ   normal-¯  η        h_{p}(\eta,\bar{\zeta})=\overline{h_{p}(\zeta,\bar{\eta})}   for all ζ, η in E p and        h  p    (  ζ  ,   ζ  ¯   )    >  0         subscript  h  p    ζ   normal-¯  ζ     0    h_{p}(\zeta,\bar{\zeta})>0   for all nonzero ζ in E p .  A Hermitian manifold is a complex manifold with a Hermitian metric on its holomorphic tangent space . Likewise, an almost Hermitian manifold is an almost complex manifold with a Hermitian metric on its holomorphic tangent space.  On a Hermitian manifold the metric can be written in local holomorphic coordinates ( z α ) as      h  =       h   α   β  ¯      d   z  α    ⊗  d     z  ¯   β        h     tensor-product     subscript  h    α   normal-¯  β     d   superscript  z  α    d    superscript   normal-¯  z   β      h=h_{\alpha\bar{\beta}}\,dz^{\alpha}\otimes d\bar{z}^{\beta}   where    h   α   β  ¯       subscript  h    α   normal-¯  β      h_{\alpha\bar{\beta}}   are the components of a positive-definite Hermitian matrix .  Riemannian metric and associated form  A Hermitian metric h on an (almost) complex manifold M defines a Riemannian metric  g on the underlying smooth manifold. The metric g is defined to be the real part of h :       g  =    1  2    (   h  +   h  ¯    )     .      g      1  2     h   normal-¯  h       g={1\over 2}(h+\bar{h}).   The form g is a symmetric bilinear form on TM C , the complexified tangent bundle. Since g is equal to its conjugate it is the complexification of a real form on TM . The symmetry and positive-definiteness of g on TM follow from the corresponding properties of h . In local holomorphic coordinates the metric g can be written       g  =    1  2     h   α   β  ¯       (      d   z  α    ⊗  d     z  ¯   β    +     d    z  ¯   β    ⊗  d    z  α     )     .      g      1  2    subscript  h    α   normal-¯  β          tensor-product    d   superscript  z  α    d    superscript   normal-¯  z   β       tensor-product    d   superscript   normal-¯  z   β    d    superscript  z  α        g={1\over 2}h_{\alpha\bar{\beta}}\,(dz^{\alpha}\otimes d\bar{z}^{\beta}+d\bar{%
 z}^{\beta}\otimes dz^{\alpha}).     One can also associate to h a complex differential form ω of degree (1,1). The form ω is defined as minus the imaginary part of h :       ω  =    i  2    (   h  -   h  ¯    )     .      ω      i  2     h   normal-¯  h       \omega={i\over 2}(h-\bar{h}).   Again since ω is equal to its conjugate it is the complexification of a real form on TM . The form ω is called variously the associated (1,1) form , the fundamental form , or the Hermitian form . In local holomorphic coordinates ω can be written       ω  =     i  2     h   α   β  ¯      d   z  α    ∧   d    z  ¯   β      .      ω        i  2    subscript  h    α   normal-¯  β     d   superscript  z  α      d   superscript   normal-¯  z   β       \omega={i\over 2}h_{\alpha\bar{\beta}}\,dz^{\alpha}\wedge d\bar{z}^{\beta}.     It is clear from the coordinate representations that any one of the three forms h , g , and ω uniquely determine the other two. The Riemannian metric g and associated (1,1) form ω are related by the almost complex structure  J as follows      ω   (  u  ,  v  )       ω   u  v     \displaystyle\omega(u,v)   for all complex tangent vectors u and v . The Hermitian metric h can be recovered from g and ω via the identity       h  =   g  -   i  ω     .      h    g    i  ω      h=g-i\omega.\,   All three forms h , g , and ω preserve the almost complex structure  J . That is,      h   (   J  u   ,   J  v   )       h     J  u     J  v      \displaystyle h(Ju,Jv)   for all complex tangent vectors u and v .  A Hermitian structure on an (almost) complex manifold M can therefore be specified by either   a Hermitian metric h as above,  a Riemannian metric g that preserves the almost complex structure J , or  a nondegenerate 2-form ω which preserves J and is positive-definite in the sense that ω( u , Ju ) > 0 for all nonzero real tangent vectors u .   Note that many authors call g itself the Hermitian metric.  Properties  Every (almost) complex manifold admits a Hermitian metric. This follows directly from the analogous statement for Riemannian metric. Given an arbitrary Riemannian metric g on an almost complex manifold M one can construct a new metric g ′ compatible with the almost complex structure J in an obvious manner:         g  ′    (  u  ,  v  )    =    1  2    (    g   (  u  ,  v  )    +   g   (   J  u   ,   J  v   )     )     .         superscript  g  normal-′    u  v        1  2       g   u  v      g     J  u     J  v         g^{\prime}(u,v)={1\over 2}\left(g(u,v)+g(Ju,Jv)\right).     Choosing a Hermitian metric on an almost complex manifold M is equivalent to a choice of U( n )-structure on M ; that is, a reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle of M from GL( n , C ) to the unitary group U( n ). A unitary frame on an almost Hermitian manifold is complex linear frame which is orthonormal with respect to the Hermitian metric. The unitary frame bundle of M is the principal U( n )-bundle of all unitary frames.  Every almost Hermitian manifold M has a canonical volume form which is just the Riemannian volume form determined by g . This form is given in terms of the associated (1,1)-form ω by       vol  M   =    ω  n    n  !    ∈    Ω   n  ,  n     (  M  )           subscript  vol  M      superscript  ω  n     n            superscript  normal-Ω   n  n    M      \mathrm{vol}_{M}=\frac{\omega^{n}}{n!}\in\Omega^{n,n}(M)   where ω n is the wedge product of ω with itself n times. The volume form is therefore a real ( n , n )-form on M . In local holomorphic coordinates the volume form is given by        vol  M   =      (   i  2   )   n    det    (   h   α   β  ¯     )   d   z  1      ∧   d    z  ¯   1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   d   z  n    ∧   d    z  ¯   n      .       subscript  vol  M        superscript    i  2   n        subscript  h    α   normal-¯  β     d   superscript  z  1        d   superscript   normal-¯  z   1    normal-⋯    d   superscript  z  n      d   superscript   normal-¯  z   n       \mathrm{vol}_{M}=\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^{n}\det(h_{\alpha\bar{\beta}})\,dz^{%
 1}\wedge d\bar{z}^{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dz^{n}\wedge d\bar{z}^{n}.     One can also consider a hermitian metric on a holomorphic vector bundle .  Kähler manifolds  The most important class of Hermitian manifolds are Kähler manifolds . These are Hermitian manifolds for which the Hermitian form ω is closed :       d  ω   =  0 .        d  ω   0 .    d\omega=0\,.   In this case the form ω is called a Kähler form . A Kähler form is a symplectic form , and so Kähler manifolds are naturally symplectic manifolds .  An almost Hermitian manifold whose associated (1,1)-form is closed is naturally called an almost Kähler manifold . Any symplectic manifold admits a compatible almost complex structure making it into an almost Kähler manifold.  Integrability  A Kähler manifold is an almost Hermitian manifold satisfying an integrability condition . This can be stated in several equivalent ways.  Let ( M , g , ω, J ) be an almost Hermitian manifold of real dimension 2 n and let ∇ be the Levi-Civita connection of g . The following are equivalent conditions for M to be Kähler:   ω is closed and J is integrable  ∇ J = 0,  ∇ω = 0,  the holonomy group of ∇ is contained in the unitary group U( n ) associated to J .   The equivalence of these conditions corresponds to the " 2 out of 3 " property of the unitary group .  In particular, if M is a Hermitian manifold, the condition dω = 0 is equivalent to the apparently much stronger conditions ∇ω = ∇ J = 0. The richness of Kähler theory is due in part to these properties.  References       "  Category:Complex manifolds  Category:Structures on manifolds  Category:Riemannian geometry
