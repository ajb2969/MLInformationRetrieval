R-linalool synthase




R-linalool synthase

In enzymology, a R-linalool synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (3R)-linalool + diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geranyl diphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are (3R)-linalool and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(3R)-linalool-forming]. Other names in common use include (3R)-linalool synthase, and (âˆ’)-3R-linalool synthase.
