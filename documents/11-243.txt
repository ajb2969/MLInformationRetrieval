   R-linalool synthase      R-linalool synthase   In enzymology , a R-linalool synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (3R)-linalool + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geranyl diphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (3R)-linalool and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [(3R)-linalool-forming] . Other names in common use include (3R)-linalool synthase , and (−)-3R-linalool synthase .
