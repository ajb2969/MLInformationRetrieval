   Gevrey class      Gevrey class   In mathematics, the Gevrey class  G σ , introduced by , consists of the smooth functions  g on R n such that on every compact subset  K there are constants C and R with       |    D  α   g   (  x  )    |   ≤   C   R  k    k   σ  k              superscript  D  α   g  x      C   superscript  R  k    superscript  k    σ  k       |D^{\alpha}g(x)|\leq CR^{k}k^{\sigma k}   for multi-indices α, such that |α| = k , and corresponding differential operators  D α (see multi-index notation ); and x restricted to lie in the compact set K .  When σ = 1 this class is the same as the class of analytic functions . For σ > 1 there are compactly supported functions in the class that are not identically zero.
