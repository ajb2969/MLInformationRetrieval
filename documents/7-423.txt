Cauchy condensation test

In mathematics, the Cauchy condensation test, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is a standard convergence test for infinite series. For a non-negative, non-increasing sequence

 
  of real numbers, the series 
 
 
 
  converges if and only if the "condensed" series 
 
 
 
  converges. Moreover, if they converge, the sum of the condensed series is no more than twice as large as the sum of the original.
Estimate
The Cauchy condensation test follows from the stronger estimate



which should be understood as an inequality of extended real numbers. The essential thrust of a proof follows, following the line of Oresme's proof of the divergence of the harmonic series.
To see the first inequality, the terms of the original series are rebracketed into runs whose lengths are powers of two, and then each run is bounded above by replacing each term by the largest term in that run: the first one, since the terms are non-increasing.



To see the second, the two series are again rebracketed into runs of power of two length, but "offset" as shown below, so that the run of 
 
 
 
  which begins with 
 
 
 
  lines up with the end of the run of 
 
 
 
  which ends with 
 
 
 
 , so that the former stays always "ahead" of the latter.

Integral comparison
The "condensation" transformation 
 
 
 
  recalls the integral variable substitution 
 
 
 
  yielding 
 
 
 
 .
Pursuing this idea, the integral test for convergence gives us that 
 
 
 
  converges if and only if 
 
 
 
  converges. The substitution 
 
 
 
  yields the integral 
 
 
 
  and another integral test brings us to the condensed series 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
The test can be useful for series where n appears as in a denominator in f. For the most basic example of this sort, the harmonic series 
 
 
 
  is transformed into the series 
 
 
 
 , which clearly diverges.
As a more complex example, take


 
 .
Here the series definitely converges for a > 1, and diverges for a \sum n^{-b} (\log n)^{-c}.
The logarithms 'shift to the left'. So when a = 1, we have convergence for b > 1, divergence for b {\Delta u(n) \over \Delta u(n-1)} = {u(n+1)-u(n) \over u(n)-u(n-1)}
is bounded, where 
 
 
 
  is the forward difference of u. Then the series 
 
 
 
  converges if and only if1 the series



converges. Taking 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 , the Cauchy condensation test emerges as a special case.
