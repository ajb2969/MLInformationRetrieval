   Threonine racemase      Threonine racemase   In enzymology , a threonine racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-threonine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-threonine   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-threonine , and one product , D-threonine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is threonine racemase .
