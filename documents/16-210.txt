   N-transform      N-transform   In mathematics, the Natural transform is an integral transform similar to the Laplace transform and Sumudu transform , introduced by Zafar Hayat Khan 1 in 2008. It converges to both Laplace and Sumudu transform just by changing variables. Given the convergence to the Laplace and Sumudu transforms, the N-transform inherits all the applied aspects of the both transforms. Most recently, F. B. M. Belgacem 2 has renamed it the natural transform and has proposed a detail theory and applications. 3 4  Formal definition  The natural transform of a function  f ( t ), defined for all real numbers t ‚â• 0 , is the function R ( u , s ), defined by:      R   (  u  ,  s  )   =  ùí©   {  f   (  t  )   }   =   ‚à´  0  ‚àû   f   (  u  t  )     e   -   s  t      d  t  .   (  1  )      fragments  R   fragments  normal-(  u  normal-,  s  normal-)    N   fragments  normal-{  f   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-}     superscript   subscript   0     f   fragments  normal-(  u  t  normal-)    superscript  e      s  t     d  t  normal-.  italic-   fragments  normal-(  1  normal-)     R(u,s)=\mathcal{N}\{f(t)\}=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(ut)e^{-st}\,dt.\qquad(1)     Khan 5 showed that the above integral converges to Laplace transform when u =¬†1, and into Sumudu transform for s =¬†1.
