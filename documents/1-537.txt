   Inverse limit      Inverse limit   In mathematics , the inverse limit (also called the projective limit in the case of epimorphisms) is a construction that allows one to "glue together" several related objects , the precise manner of the gluing process being specified by morphisms between the objects. Inverse limits can be defined in any category .  Formal definition  Algebraic objects  We start with the definition of an inverse (or projective when the involved morphisms are epimorphisms) system of groups and homomorphisms . Let ( I , ≤) be a directed  poset (not all authors require I to be directed). Let ( A i ) i ∈ I be a family of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms f ij : A j → A i for all i ≤ j (note the order), called bonding maps, with the following properties:   f ii is the identity on A i ,  f ik = f ij  o  f jk for all i ≤ j ≤ k .   Then the pair (( A i ) i ∈ I , ( f ij ) i ≤ j ∈ I ) is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over I , and the morphisms f ij are called the transition morphisms of the system.  We define the inverse limit of the inverse system (( A i ) i ∈ I , ( f ij ) i ≤ j ∈ I ) as a particular subgroup of the direct product of the A i 's:          lim  ←    i  ∈  I     A  i    =   {    a  →   ∈    ∏   i  ∈  I      A  i      |    a  i   =    f   i  j     (   a  j   )   for all  i   ≤   j  in  I    }    .        subscript  projective-limit    i  I     subscript  A  i     conditional-set     normal-→  a     subscript  product    i  I     subscript  A  i          subscript  a  i      subscript  f    i  j     subscript  a  j   for all  i          j  in  I        \underleftarrow{\lim}_{i\in I}A_{i}=\Big\{\vec{a}\in\prod_{i\in I}A_{i}\;\Big|%
 \;a_{i}=f_{ij}(a_{j})\mbox{ for all }i\leq j\mbox{ in }I\Big\}.   The inverse limit, A , comes equipped with natural projections π i : A → A i which pick out the i th component of the direct product for each i in I . The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a universal property described in the next section.  This same construction may be carried out if the A i 's are sets , 1 semigroups, 2 topological spaces, 3  rings , modules (over a fixed ring), algebras (over a fixed ring), etc., and the homomorphisms are morphisms in the corresponding category . The inverse limit will also belong to that category.  General definition  The inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary category by means of a universal property . Let ( X i , f ij ) be an inverse system of objects and morphisms in a category C (same definition as above). The inverse limit of this system is an object X in C together with morphisms π i : X → X i (called projections ) satisfying π i = f ij  o π j for all i ≤ j . The pair ( X , π i ) must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair ( Y , ψ i ) (i.e. ψ i : Y → X i with ψ i = f ij  o ψ j for all i ≤ j ) there exists a unique morphism u : Y → X making all the "obvious" identities true; i.e., the diagram   (Figure)  InverseLimit-01.png    must commute for all i ≤ j , for which it suffices to show that ψ i = π i  o  u for all i . The inverse limit is often denoted      X  =    lim  ←    X  i        X   projective-limit   subscript  X  i      X=\underleftarrow{\lim}X_{i}   with the inverse system ( X i , f ij ) being understood.  The inverse limit might not exist in a category. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any other inverse limit X ′ there exists a unique  isomorphism  X ′ → X commuting with the projection maps.  We note that an inverse system in a category C admits an alternative description in terms of functors . Any partially ordered set I can be considered as a small category where the morphisms consist of arrows i → j  if and only if  i ≤ j . An inverse system is then just a contravariant functor  I → C . And the inverse limit functor     lim  ←   :    C   I   o  p     →  C      normal-:  projective-limit   normal-→   superscript  C   superscript  I    o  p     C     \underleftarrow{\lim}:C^{I^{op}}\rightarrow C   is a covariant functor .  Examples   The ring of p -adic integers is the inverse limit of the rings Z / p n Z (see modular arithmetic ) with the index set being the natural numbers with the usual order, and the morphisms being "take remainder". The natural topology on the p -adic integers is the same as the one described here.  The ring    R   [   [  t  ]   ]       R   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  t      \textstyle R[[t]]   of formal power series over a commutative ring R can be thought of as the inverse limit of the rings      R   [  t  ]    /   t  n    R   [  t  ]           R   delimited-[]  t     superscript  t  n    R   delimited-[]  t     \textstyle R[t]/t^{n}R[t]   , indexed by the natural numbers as usually ordered, with the morphisms from      R   [  t  ]    /   t   n  +  j     R   [  t  ]           R   delimited-[]  t     superscript  t    n  j     R   delimited-[]  t     \textstyle R[t]/t^{n+j}R[t]   to      R   [  t  ]    /   t  n    R   [  t  ]           R   delimited-[]  t     superscript  t  n    R   delimited-[]  t     \textstyle R[t]/t^{n}R[t]   given by the natural projection.  Pro-finite groups are defined as inverse limits of (discrete) finite groups.  Let the index set I of an inverse system ( X i , f ij ) have a greatest element  m . Then the natural projection π m : X → X m is an isomorphism.  Inverse limits in the category of topological spaces are given by placing the initial topology on the underlying set-theoretic inverse limit. This is known as the limit topology .  The set of infinite strings is the inverse limit of the set of finite strings, and is thus endowed with the limit topology. As the original spaces are discrete , the limit space is totally disconnected . This is one way of realizing the p -adic numbers and the Cantor set (as infinite strings).   Let ( I , =) be the trivial order (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is just the product .  Let I consist of three elements i , j , and k with i ≤ j and i ≤ k (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is the pullback .   Derived functors of the inverse limit  For an abelian category  C , the inverse limit functor       lim  ←   :    C  I   →  C      normal-:  projective-limit   normal-→   superscript  C  I   C     \underleftarrow{\lim}:C^{I}\rightarrow C   is left exact . If I is ordered (not simply partially ordered) and countable , and C is the category Ab of abelian groups, the Mittag-Leffler condition is a condition on the transition morphisms f ij that ensures the exactness of    lim  ←    projective-limit   \underleftarrow{\lim}   . Specifically, Eilenberg constructed a functor       lim  ←    :    1    Ab  I   →  Ab     fragments  projective-limit   superscript  normal-:  1    superscript  Ab  I   normal-→  Ab    \underleftarrow{\lim}{}^{1}:\operatorname{Ab}^{I}\rightarrow\operatorname{Ab}   (pronounced "lim one") such that if ( A i , f ij ), ( B i , g ij ), and ( C i , h ij ) are three projective systems of abelian groups, and      0  →   A  i   →   B  i   →   C  i   →  0       normal-→  0   subscript  A  i     normal-→     subscript  B  i     normal-→     subscript  C  i     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow A_{i}\rightarrow B_{i}\rightarrow C_{i}\rightarrow 0   is a short exact sequence of inverse systems, then      0  →    lim  ←    A  i    →    lim  ←    B  i    →    lim  ←    C  i    →    lim  ←    A  i     1         normal-→  0   projective-limit   subscript  A  i      normal-→     projective-limit   subscript  B  i      normal-→     projective-limit   subscript  C  i      normal-→     projective-limit   superscript   subscript  A  i   1       0\rightarrow\underleftarrow{\lim}A_{i}\rightarrow\underleftarrow{\lim}B_{i}%
 \rightarrow\underleftarrow{\lim}C_{i}\rightarrow\underleftarrow{\lim}{}^{1}A_{i}   is an exact sequence in Ab .  Mittag-Leffler condition  If the ranges of the morphisms of an inverse system of abelian groups ( A i , f ij ) are stationary , that is, for every k there exists j ≥ k such that for all i ≥ j       f   k  j     (   A  j   )    =    f   k  i     (   A  i   )           subscript  f    k  j     subscript  A  j       subscript  f    k  i     subscript  A  i      f_{kj}(A_{j})=f_{ki}(A_{i})   one says that the system satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition . This condition implies that      lim  ←    A  i     1    =  0.       projective-limit   superscript   subscript  A  i   1    0.    \underleftarrow{\lim}{}^{1}A_{i}=0.     The following situations are examples where the Mittag-Leffler condition is satisfied:   a system in which the morphisms f ij are surjective  a system of finite-dimensional vector spaces.   An example where this is non-zero is obtained by taking I to be the non-negative integers , letting A i = p i Z , B i = Z , and C i = B i / A i = Z / p i Z . Then        lim  ←    A  i     1    =    𝐙  p   /  𝐙        projective-limit   superscript   subscript  A  i   1       subscript  𝐙  p   𝐙     \underleftarrow{\lim}{}^{1}A_{i}=\mathbf{Z}_{p}/\mathbf{Z}   where Z p denotes the p-adic integers .  Further results  More generally, if C is an arbitrary abelian category that has enough injectives , then so does C I , and the right derived functors of the inverse limit functor can thus be defined. The n th right derived functor is denoted         R  n    lim  ←    :    C  I   →  C    .     normal-:     superscript  R  n   projective-limit    normal-→   superscript  C  I   C     R^{n}\underleftarrow{\lim}:C^{I}\rightarrow C.   In the case where C satisfies Grothendieck 's axiom (AB4*) , Jan-Erik Roos generalized the functor lim 1 on Ab I to series of functors lim n such that       lim  ←    ≅    n    R  n    lim  ←   .     fragments  projective-limit   superscript   n    superscript  R  n   projective-limit  normal-.    \underleftarrow{\lim}{}^{n}\cong R^{n}\underleftarrow{\lim}.   It was thought for almost 40 years that Roos had proved (in ''Sur les foncteurs dérivés de lim. Applications. '') that lim 1  A i = 0 for ( A i , f ij ) an inverse system with surjective transition morphisms and I the set of non-negative integers (such inverse systems are often called " Mittag-Leffler sequences"). However, in 2002, Amnon Neeman and Pierre Deligne constructed an example of such a system in a category satisfying (AB4) (in addition to (AB4*)) with lim 1  A i ≠ 0. Roos has since shown (in "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited") that his result is correct if C has a set of generators (in addition to satisfying (AB3) and (AB4*)).  Barry Mitchell has shown (in "The cohomological dimension of a directed set") that if I has cardinality     ℵ  d     subscript  normal-ℵ  d    \aleph_{d}   (the d th infinite cardinal ), then R n lim is zero for all n ≥ d + 2. This applies to the I -indexed diagrams in the category of R -modules, with R a commutative ring; it is not necessarily true in an arbitrary abelian category (see Roos' "Derived functors of inverse limits revisited" for examples of abelian categories in which lim n , on diagrams indexed by a countable set, is nonzero for n>1).  Related concepts and generalizations  The categorical dual of an inverse limit is a direct limit (or inductive limit). More general concepts are the limits and colimits of category theory. The terminology is somewhat confusing: inverse limits are limits, while direct limits are colimits.
