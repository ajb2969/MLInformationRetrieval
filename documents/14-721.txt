Blake number

The Blake number in fluid mechanics is a nondimensional number showing the ratio of inertial force to viscous force. It is used in momentum transfer in general and in particular for flow of a fluid through beds of solids. It is a generalisation of the Reynolds number for flow through porous media.
Expressed mathematically the Blake number  is:

void fraction





=

dynamic viscosity





=

fluid density
