   Blake number      Blake number   The Blake number in fluid mechanics is a nondimensional number showing the ratio of inertial force to viscous force . It is used in momentum transfer in general and in particular for flow of a fluid through beds of solids . It is a generalisation of the Reynolds number for flow through porous media.  Expressed mathematically the Blake number is:      B  =    u  ρ   D  h     μ   (   1  -  ϵ   )         B      u  ρ   subscript  D  h      μ    1  ϵ       B=\frac{u\rho D_{h}}{\mu(1-\epsilon)}     where          =   void fraction       =   dynamic viscosity       =   fluid density       =   hydraulic diameter       =   flow velocity       External links     "  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Porous media  Category:Dimensionless numbers
