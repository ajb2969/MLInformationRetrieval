   P-Laplacian      P-Laplacian   In mathematics , the p -Laplacian , or the p -Laplace operator , is a quasilinear elliptic  partial differential operator of 2nd order. It is a generalization of the Laplace operator , where   p   p   p   is allowed to range over    1  <  p  <  ∞        1  p           1   . It is written as       ∇  ⋅   (     |   ∇  u   |    p  -  2     ∇  u    )    .     normal-⋅  normal-∇     superscript     normal-∇  u      p  2     normal-∇  u      \nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u).
