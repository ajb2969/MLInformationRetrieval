P-Laplacian

In mathematics, the p-Laplacian, or the p-Laplace operator, is a quasilinear elliptic partial differential operator of 2nd order. It is a generalization of the Laplace operator, where 
 
 
 
  is allowed to range over 
 
 
 
 . It is written as



Where the 
 
 
 
  operator is defined as 
 
 

In the special case when 
 
 
 
 , it is the regular Laplacian. 1
Energy formulation
The solution of the p-Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions



in a domain 
 
 
 
  is the minimizer of the energy functional



among all functions in the Sobolev space

 
  satisfying the boundary conditions in the trace sense.2
