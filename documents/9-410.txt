   5-simplex      5-simplex   In five-dimensional  geometry , a 5- simplex is a self-dual regular  5-polytope . It has 6 vertices , 15 edges , 20 triangle faces , 15 tetrahedral cells , and 6 pentachoron  facets . It has a dihedral angle of cos −1 (1/5), or approximately 78.46°.  Alternate names  It can also be called a hexateron , or hexa-5-tope , as a 6- facetted polytope in 5-dimensions. The name  hexateron is derived from hexa- for having six facets and teron (with ter- being a corruption of tetra- ) for having four-dimensional facets.  By Jonathan Bowers, a hexateron is given the acronym hix . 1  Regular hexateron cartesian coordinates  The hexateron can be constructed from a 5-cell by adding a 6th vertex such that it is equidistant from all the other vertices of the 5-cell.  The Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of an origin-centered regular hexateron having edge length 2 are:      (    1  /  15    ,    1  /  10    ,    1  /  6    ,    1  /  3    ,   ±  1   )         1  15        1  10        1  6        1  3     plus-or-minus  1     \left(\sqrt{1/15},\ \sqrt{1/10},\ \sqrt{1/6},\ \sqrt{1/3},\ \pm 1\right)         (    1  /  15    ,    1  /  10    ,    1  /  6    ,   -   2    1  /  3      ,  0  )         1  15        1  10        1  6        2      1  3      0    \left(\sqrt{1/15},\ \sqrt{1/10},\ \sqrt{1/6},\ -2\sqrt{1/3},\ 0\right)         (    1  /  15    ,    1  /  10    ,   -    3  /  2     ,  0  ,  0  )         1  15        1  10          3  2     0  0    \left(\sqrt{1/15},\ \sqrt{1/10},\ -\sqrt{3/2},\ 0,\ 0\right)         (    1  /  15    ,   -   2    2  /  5      ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )         1  15        2      2  5      0  0  0    \left(\sqrt{1/15},\ -2\sqrt{2/5},\ 0,\ 0,\ 0\right)         (   -    5  /  3     ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )           5  3     0  0  0  0    \left(-\sqrt{5/3},\ 0,\ 0,\ 0,\ 0\right)     The vertices of the 5-simplex can be more simply positioned on a hyperplane in 6-space as permutations of (0,0,0,0,0,1) or (0,1,1,1,1,1). These construction can be seen as facets of the hexacross or rectified 6-cube respectively.  Projected images       Stereographic projection 4D to 3D of Schlegel diagram 5D to 4D of hexateron.

(Vertices are colored by projection overlap order, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple having progressively more vertices)  Other forms  The hexateron can also be considered a pentachoral pyramid , constructed as a pentachoron base in a 4-space hyperplane , and an apex point above the hyperplane. The five sides of the pyramid are made of pentachoral cells.  Notes  References   T.
