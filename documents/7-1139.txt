   W state      W state   The W state is an entangled  quantum state of three qubits which has the following shape       |  W  ⟩   =    1   3     (    |  001  ⟩   +   |  010  ⟩   +   |  100  ⟩    )         ket  W       1    3       ket  001    ket  010    ket  100       |W\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|001\rangle+|010\rangle+|100\rangle)   and which is remarkable for representing a specific type of multipartite entanglement and for occurring in several applications in quantum information theory .  Properties  The W state is the representative of one of the two non-biseparable 1 classes of three-qubit states (the other being the GHZ state ) which cannot be transformed (not even probabilistically) into each other by local quantum operations . 2 Thus    |  W  ⟩     ket  W    |W\rangle   and    |   G  H  Z   ⟩     ket    G  H  Z     |GHZ\rangle   represent two very different kinds of tripartite entanglement.  This difference is, for example, illustrated by the following interesting property of the W state: if one of the three qubits is lost, the state of the remaining 2-qubit system is still entangled. This robustness of W-type entanglement contrasts strongly with the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state which is fully separable after loss of one qubit.  The states in the W class can be distinguished from all other three-qubit states by means of multipartite entanglement measures . In particular, W states have non-zero entanglement across any bipartition 3 while the 3-tangle vanishes, which is also non-zero for GHZ-type states. 4  Generalization  The notion of W state has been generalized for   n   n   n   qubits 5 and then refers to the quantum superpostion with equal expansion coefficients of all possible pure states in which exactly one of the qubits in an "excited state"    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   , while all other ones are in the "ground state"    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle          |  W  ⟩   =    1   n     (    |  100...0  ⟩   +   |  010...0  ⟩   +  …  +   |  00...01  ⟩    )         ket  W       1    n       ket  100...0    ket  010...0   normal-…   ket  00...01       |W\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(|100...0\rangle+|010...0\rangle+...+|00...01\rangle)   Both the robustness against particle loss and the LOCC-inequivalence with the (generalized) GHZ state also hold for the   n   n   n   -qubit W state.  Applications  In systems in which a single qubit is stored in an ensemble of many two level systems the logical "1" is often represented by the W state while the logical "0" is represented by the state    |  00...0  ⟩     ket  00...0    |00...0\rangle   . Here the W state's robustness against particle loss is a very beneficial property ensuring good storage properties of these ensemble based quantum memories. 6  References    "  Category:Quantum information theory     A pure state    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   of   N   N   N   parties is called biseparable , if one can find a partition of the parties in two disjoint subsets   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   with     A  ∪  B   =   {  1  ,  …  ,  N  }         A  B    1  normal-…  N     A\cup B=\{1,...,N\}   such that     |  ψ  ⟩   =     |  ϕ  ⟩   A   ⊗    |  γ  ⟩   B         ket  ψ    tensor-product   subscript   ket  ϕ   A    subscript   ket  γ   B      |\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle_{A}\otimes|\gamma\rangle_{B}   , i.e.    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   is a product state with respect to he partition    A  |  B     fragments  A  normal-|  B    A|B   . ↩  ↩  A bipartition of the three qubits    1  ,  2  ,  3     1  2  3    1,2,3   is any grouping      (  12  )   3   ,   1   (  23  )         12  3     1  23     (12)3,1(23)   and     (  13  )   2      13  2    (13)2   in which two qubits are considered to belong to the same party.
