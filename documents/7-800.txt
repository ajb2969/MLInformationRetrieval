   Cake number      Cake number   In mathematics , the cake number , denoted by C n , is the maximum number of regions into which a 3-dimensional cube can be partitioned by exactly n  planes . The cake number is so-called because one may imagine each partition of the cube by a plane as a slice made by a knife through a cube-shaped cake .  The values of C n for increasing  are given by  The cake numbers are the 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional lazy caterer's sequence ; the difference between successive cake numbers also gives the lazy caterer's sequence.  (Figure)  Animation showing the cutting planes required to cut a cake into 15 pieces with 4 cutting planes (representing the 5th cake number). Fourteen of the pieces would have an external surface, with one tetrahedron cut out of the middle.   General formula  If n ! denotes the factorial , and we denote the binomial coefficients by        (     n      k     )   =    n  !     k  !     (   n  -  k   )   !      ,       binomial  n  k       n       k       n  k        {n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!},   and we assume that n planes are available to partition the cube, then the number is: 1        C  n   =    (     n      3     )   +   (     n      2     )   +   (     n      1     )   +   (     n      0     )    =    1  6    (    n  3   +   5  n   +  6   )     .         subscript  C  n      binomial  n  3    binomial  n  2    binomial  n  1    binomial  n  0             1  6      superscript  n  3     5  n   6       C_{n}={n\choose 3}+{n\choose 2}+{n\choose 1}+{n\choose 0}=\frac{1}{6}(n^{3}+5n%
