   4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase      4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase   In enzymology , a 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose uronate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose uronate , and one product , 3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate aldose-ketose-isomerase . This enzyme is also called 4-deoxy-L-threo-5-hexulose uronate isomerase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
