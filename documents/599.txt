   Well-pointed category      Well-pointed category   In category theory , a category with a terminal object    1   1   1   is well-pointed if for every pair of arrows     f  ,  g   :   A  →  B      normal-:   f  g    normal-→  A  B     f,g:A\to B   such that    f  ≠  g      f  g    f\neq g   , there is an arrow    p  :   1  →  A      normal-:  p   normal-→  1  A     p:1\to A   such that     f  ∘  p   ≠   g  ∘  p         f  p     g  p     f\circ p\neq g\circ p   . (The arrows   p   p   p   are called the global elements or points of the category; a well-pointed category is thus one that has "enough points" to distinguish non-equal arrows.)
