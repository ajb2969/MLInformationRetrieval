Crystal base

In algebra, a crystal base or canonical base is a base of a representation, such that generators of a quantum group or semisimple Lie algebra have a particularly simple action on it. Crystal bases were introduced by  and  (under the name of canonical bases).
Definition
As a consequence of the defining relations for the quantum group 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  can be regarded as a Hopf algebra over 
 
 
 
 , the field of all rational functions of an indeterminate q over 
 
 
 
 .
For simple root 
 
 
 
  and non-negative integer 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (specifically, 
 
 
 
 ). In an integrable module 
 
 
 
 , and for weight 
 
 
 
 , a vector 
 
 
 
  (i.e. a vector 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with weight 
 
 
 
 ) can be uniquely decomposed into the sums





where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  only if 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  only if 
 
 
 
 . Linear mappings 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be defined on 
 
 
 
  by










Let 
 
 
 
  be the integral domain of all rational functions in 
 
 
 
  which are regular at 
 
 
 
  (i.e. a rational function 
 
 
 
  is an element of 
 
 
 
  if and only if there exist polynomials 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the polynomial ring 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ). A crystal base for 
 
 
 
  is an ordered pair 
 
 
 
 , such that



 
  is a free 
 
 
 
 -submodule of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 





 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -basis of the vector space 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 





 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where

To put this into a more informal setting, the actions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generally singular at 
 
 
 
  on an integrable module 
 
 
 
 . The linear mappings 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on the module are introduced so that the actions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are regular at 
 
 
 
  on the module. There exists a 
 
 
 
 -basis of weight vectors 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , with respect to which the actions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are regular at 
 
 
 
  for all i. The module is then restricted to the free 
 
 
 
 -module generated by the basis, and the basis vectors, the 
 
 
 
 -submodule and the actions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are evaluated at 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the basis can be chosen such that at 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are represented by mutual transposes, and map basis vectors to basis vectors or 0.
A crystal base can be represented by a directed graph with labelled edges. Each vertex of the graph represents an element of the 
 
 
 
 -basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , and a directed edge, labelled by i, and directed from vertex 
 
 
 
  to vertex 
 
 
 
 , represents that 
 
 
 
  (and, equivalently, that 
 
 
 
 ), where 
 
 
 
  is the basis element represented by 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the basis element represented by 
 
 
 
 . The graph completely determines the actions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . If an integrable module has a crystal base, then the module is irreducible if and only if the graph representing the crystal base is connected (a graph is called "connected" if the set of vertices cannot be partitioned into the union of nontrivial disjoint subsets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that there are no edges joining any vertex in 
 
 
 
  to any vertex in 
 
 
 
 ).
For any integrable module with a crystal base, the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the module, and therefore the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac–Moody algebra. The multiplicities of the weights in the crystal base are also the same as their multiplicities in the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac–Moody algebra.
It is a theorem of Kashiwara that every integrable highest weight module has a crystal base. Similarly, every integrable lowest weight module has a crystal base.
Tensor products of crystal bases
Let 
 
 
 
  be an integrable module with crystal base 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be an integrable module with crystal base 
 
 
 
 . For crystal bases, the coproduct 
 
 
 
 , given by 
 
 
 
 , is adopted. The integrable module 
 
 
 
  has crystal base 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . For a basis vector 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The actions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  are given by










The decomposition of the product two integrable highest weight modules into irreducible submodules is determined by the decomposition of the graph of the crystal base into its connected components (i.e. the highest weights of the submodules are determined, and the multiplicity of each highest weight is determined).
