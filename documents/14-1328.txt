Mott polynomials

In mathematics the Mott polynomials sn(x) are polynomials introduced by  who applied them to a problem in the theory of electrons. They are given by the exponential generating function



The first few of them are 





















The polynomials sn(x) form the associated Sheffer sequence for –2t/(1–t2) .  give an explicit expression for them in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function 3F0.
