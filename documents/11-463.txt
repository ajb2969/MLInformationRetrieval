   CMP-N-acylneuraminate phosphodiesterase      CMP-N-acylneuraminate phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a CMP-N-acylneuraminate phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CMP-N-acylneuraminate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + N-acylneuraminate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CMP-N-acylneuraminate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are CMP and N-acylneuraminate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CMP-N-acylneuraminate N-acylneuraminohydrolase . Other names in common use include CMP-sialate hydrolase , CMP-sialic acid hydrolase , CMP-N-acylneuraminic acid hydrolase , cytidine monophosphosialic hydrolase , cytidine monophosphosialate hydrolase , cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydrolase , and CMP-N-acetylneuraminate hydrolase .
