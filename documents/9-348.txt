   Lamé parameters      Lamé parameters   In continuum mechanics , the Lamé parameters (also called the Lamé coefficients or Lamé constants ) are two material-dependent quantities denoted by λ and μ that arise in strain - stress relationships. 1 In general, λ and μ are individually referred to as Lamé's first parameter and Lamé's second parameter , respectively. Other names are sometimes employed for one or both parameters, depending on context. For example, the parameter μ is referred to in fluid dynamics as the dynamic viscosity of a fluid; whereas in the context of elasticity , μ is called the shear modulus , 2 and is sometimes denoted by G instead of μ. Typically the notation G is seen paired with the use of Young's modulus, and the notation μ is paired with the use of λ.  In homogeneous and isotropic materials, these define Hooke's law in 3D,      𝝈  =    2  μ  𝜺   +    λ   tr   (  𝜺  )   I        𝝈      2  μ  𝜺     λ  tr  𝜺  I      \boldsymbol{\sigma}=2\mu\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}+\lambda\;\mathrm{tr}(%
 \boldsymbol{\varepsilon})I     where σ is the stress , ε the strain tensor ,   I   I   \scriptstyle I   the identity matrix and    tr   (  ⋅  )       tr  normal-⋅    \scriptstyle\mathrm{tr}(\cdot)   the trace function.  The two parameters together constitute a parameterization of the elastic moduli for homogeneous isotropic media, popular in mathematical literature, and are thus related to the other elastic moduli ; for instance, the bulk modulus can be expressed as    K  =   λ  +    (   2  /  3   )   μ        K    λ      2  3   μ      K=\lambda+(2/3)\mu   .  Although the shear modulus, μ, must be positive, the Lamé's first parameter, λ, can be negative, in principle; however, for most materials it is also positive.  The parameters are named after Gabriel Lamé .  Further reading   K. Feng, Z.-C. Shi, Mathematical Theory of Elastic Structures , Springer New York, ISBN 0-387-51326-4, (1981)  G. Mavko, T.
