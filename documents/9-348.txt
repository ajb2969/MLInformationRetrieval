Lamé parameters

In continuum mechanics, the Lamé parameters (also called the Lamé coefficients or Lamé constants) are two material-dependent quantities denoted by λ and μ that arise in strain-stress relationships.1 In general, λ and μ are individually referred to as Lamé's first parameter and Lamé's second parameter, respectively. Other names are sometimes employed for one or both parameters, depending on context. For example, the parameter μ is referred to in fluid dynamics as the dynamic viscosity of a fluid; whereas in the context of elasticity, μ is called the shear modulus,2 and is sometimes denoted by G instead of μ. Typically the notation G is seen paired with the use of Young's modulus, and the notation μ is paired with the use of λ.
In homogeneous and isotropic materials, these define Hooke's law in 3D,



where σ is the stress, ε the strain tensor, 
 
 
 
  the identity matrix and 
 
 
 
  the trace function.
The two parameters together constitute a parameterization of the elastic moduli for homogeneous isotropic media, popular in mathematical literature, and are thus related to the other elastic moduli; for instance, the bulk modulus can be expressed as 
 
 
 
 .
Although the shear modulus, μ, must be positive, the Lamé's first parameter, λ, can be negative, in principle; however, for most materials it is also positive.
The parameters are named after Gabriel Lamé.
