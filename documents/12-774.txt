   Newton–Cartan theory      Newton–Cartan theory   Newton–Cartan theory is a geometrical re-formulation, as well as a generalization, of Newtonian gravity developed by Élie Cartan . In this re-formulation, the structural similarities between Newton's theory and Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity are readily seen, and it has been used by Cartan and Kurt Friedrichs to give a rigorous formulation of the way in which Newtonian gravity can be seen as a specific limit of general relativity, and by Jürgen Ehlers to extend this correspondence to specific solutions of general relativity.  Geometric formulation of Poisson's equation  In Newton's theory of gravitation, Poisson's equation reads       Δ  U   =   4  π  G   ρ          normal-Δ  U     4  π  G  ρ     \Delta U=4\pi G\rho\,   where   U   U   U   is the gravitational potential,   G   G   G   is the gravitational constant and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the mass density. The weak equivalence principle motivates a geometric version of the equation of motion for a point particle in the potential   U   U   U           m  t     x  →   ¨    =   -    m  g    ∇  U            subscript  m  t    normal-¨   normal-→  x          subscript  m  g    normal-∇  U       m_{t}\ddot{\vec{x}}=-m_{g}\nabla U   where    m  t     subscript  m  t    m_{t}   is the inertial mass and    m  g     subscript  m  g    m_{g}   the gravitational mass. Since, according to the weak equivalence principle     m  t   =   m  g        subscript  m  t    subscript  m  g     m_{t}=m_{g}   , the according equation of motion        x  →   ¨   =   -   ∇  U         normal-¨   normal-→  x       normal-∇  U      \ddot{\vec{x}}=-\nabla U   doesn't contain anymore a reference to the mass of the particle. Following the idea that the solution of the equation then is a property of the curvature of space, a connection is constructed so that the geodesic equation          d  2    x  λ     d   s  2     +    Γ   μ  ν   λ     d   x  μ     d  s      d   x  ν     d  s      =  0             superscript  d  2    superscript  x  λ      d   superscript  s  2        superscript   subscript  normal-Γ    μ  ν    λ       d   superscript  x  μ      d  s        d   superscript  x  ν      d  s      0    \frac{d^{2}x^{\lambda}}{ds^{2}}+\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{ds}%
 \frac{dx^{\nu}}{ds}=0   represents the equation of motion of a point particle in the potential   U   U   U   . The resulting connection is       Γ   μ  ν   λ   =    γ   λ  ρ     U   ,  ρ     Ψ  μ    Ψ  ν         superscript   subscript  normal-Γ    μ  ν    λ      superscript  γ    λ  ρ     subscript  U   fragments  normal-,  ρ     subscript  normal-Ψ  μ    subscript  normal-Ψ  ν      \Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda}=\gamma^{\lambda\rho}U_{,\rho}\Psi_{\mu}\Psi_{\nu}   with     Ψ  μ   =   δ  μ  0        subscript  normal-Ψ  μ    superscript   subscript  δ  μ   0     \Psi_{\mu}=\delta_{\mu}^{0}   and     γ   μ  ν    =    δ  A  μ    δ  B  ν    δ   A  B          superscript  γ    μ  ν       subscript   superscript  δ  μ   A    subscript   superscript  δ  ν   B    superscript  δ    A  B       \gamma^{\mu\nu}=\delta^{\mu}_{A}\delta^{\nu}_{B}\delta^{AB}   (      A  ,  B   =  1   ,   2  ,  3      formulae-sequence     A  B   1    2  3     A,B=1,2,3   ). The connection has been constructed in one inertial system but can be shown to be valid in any inertial system by showing the invariance of    Ψ  μ     subscript  normal-Ψ  μ    \Psi_{\mu}   and    γ   μ  ν      superscript  γ    μ  ν     \gamma^{\mu\nu}   under Galilei-transformations. The Riemann curvature tensor in inertial system coordinates of this connection is then given by       R   κ  μ  ν   λ   =   2   γ   λ  σ     U   ,  σ   [  μ      Ψ   ν  ]     Ψ  κ         subscript   superscript  R  λ     κ  μ  ν      2   superscript  γ    λ  σ     subscript  U   fragments  normal-,  σ   fragments  normal-[  μ      subscript  normal-Ψ   fragments  ν  normal-]     subscript  normal-Ψ  κ      R^{\lambda}_{\kappa\mu\nu}=2\gamma^{\lambda\sigma}U_{,\sigma[\mu}\Psi_{\nu]}%

[    A   μ  ν    -   A   ν  μ     ]         subscript  A   delimited-[]    μ  ν         1    2     delimited-[]     subscript  A    μ  ν     subscript  A    ν  μ         A_{[\mu\nu]}=\frac{1}{2!}[A_{\mu\nu}-A_{\nu\mu}]   mean the antisymmetric combination of the tensor    A   μ  ν      subscript  A    μ  ν     A_{\mu\nu}   . The Ricci tensor is given by       R   κ  ν    =   Δ  U   Ψ  κ     Ψ  ν          subscript  R    κ  ν      normal-Δ  U   subscript  normal-Ψ  κ    subscript  normal-Ψ  ν      R_{\kappa\nu}=\Delta U\Psi_{\kappa}\Psi_{\nu}\,   which leads to following geometric formulation of Poisson's equation       R   μ  ν    =   4  π  G  ρ   Ψ  μ     Ψ  ν          subscript  R    μ  ν      4  π  G  ρ   subscript  normal-Ψ  μ    subscript  normal-Ψ  ν      R_{\mu\nu}=4\pi G\rho\Psi_{\mu}\Psi_{\nu}\,     Bargmann lift  It was shown that four-dimensional Newton–Cartan theory of gravitation can be reformulated as Kaluza–Klein reduction of five-dimensional Einstein gravity along a null-like direction. 1 This lifting is considered to be useful for non-relativistic holographic models. 2  References  Bibliography       Chapter 1 of   "  Category:Theories of gravitation     C.
