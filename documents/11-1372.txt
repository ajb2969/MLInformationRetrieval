Sterol 3beta-glucosyltransferase




Sterol 3beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a sterol 3beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + a sterol 
 
 
 
  UDP + a sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and sterol, whereas its two products are UDP and sterol 3-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:sterol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDPG:sterol glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose-sterol beta-glucosyltransferase, sterol:UDPG glucosyltransferase, UDPG-SGTase, uridine diphosphoglucose-poriferasterol glucosyltransferase, uridine diphosphoglucose-sterol glucosyltransferase, sterol glucosyltransferase, sterol-beta-D-glucosyltransferase, and UDP-glucose-sterol glucosyltransferase.
