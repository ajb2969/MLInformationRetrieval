Great retrosnub icosidodecahedron

In geometry, the great retrosnub icosidodecahedron or great inverted retrosnub icosidodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U74. It is given a Schläfli symbol s{3/2,5/3}.
Cartesian coordinates
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a great retrosnub icosidodecahedron are all the even permutations of

(±2α, ±2, ±2β),
 
(±(α−βτ−1/τ), ±(α/τ+β−τ), ±(−ατ−β/τ−1)),
 
(±(ατ−β/τ+1), ±(−α−βτ+1/τ), ±(−α/τ+β+τ)),
 
(±(ατ−β/τ−1), ±(α+βτ+1/τ), ±(−α/τ+β−τ)) and
 
(±(α−βτ+1/τ), ±(−α/τ−β−τ), ±(−ατ−β/τ+1)),
 

with an even number of plus signs, where

α = ξ−1/ξ
 

and

β = −ξ/τ+1/τ2−1/(ξτ),
 

where τ = (1+√5)/2 is the golden mean and ξ is the smaller positive real root of ξ3−2ξ=−1/τ, namely



or approximately 0.3264046. Taking the odd permutations of the above coordinates with an odd number of plus signs gives another form, the enantiomorph of the other one.
