   Pseudo-Boolean function      Pseudo-Boolean function   In mathematics and optimization , a pseudo-Boolean function is a function of the form      f  :    𝐁  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  𝐁  n   ℝ     f:\mathbf{B}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   , where B = {0, 1} is a Boolean domain and n is a nonnegative integer called the arity of the function. Any pseudo-Boolean function can be written uniquely as a multi-linear polynomial:       {   -  1   ,  1  }   n     superscript     1   1   n    \{-1,1\}^{n}   that maps   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   to   f   f   f   . Again in this case we can uniquely write      f   (  x  )    =    ∑   I  ⊆   [  n  ]       f  ^    (  I  )     ∏   i  ∈  I     x  i       ,        f  x     subscript     I   delimited-[]  n        normal-^  f   I    subscript  product    i  I     subscript  x  i        f(x)=\sum_{I\subseteq[n]}\hat{f}(I)\prod_{i\in I}x_{i},   as a multi-linear polynomial:     f  ^    (  I  )        normal-^  f   I    \hat{f}(I)   where   f   f   f   are Fourier coefficients of     [  n  ]   =   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }        delimited-[]  n    1  normal-…  n     [n]=\{1,...,n\}   and      f   (  𝒙  )    +   f   (  𝒚  )     ≥    f   (   𝒙  ∧  𝒚   )    +   f   (   𝒙  ∨  𝒚   )             f  𝒙     f  𝒚        f    𝒙  𝒚      f    𝒙  𝒚       f(\boldsymbol{x})+f(\boldsymbol{y})\geq f(\boldsymbol{x}\wedge\boldsymbol{y})+%
 f(\boldsymbol{x}\vee\boldsymbol{y})   . For a nice and simple introduction to Fourier analysis of pseudo-Boolean functions, see. 1  Optimization  Minimizing (or, equivalently, maximizing) a pseudo-Boolean function is NP-Hard . This can easily be seen by formulating, for example, the maximum cut problem as maximizing a pseudo-Boolean function.  Submodularity  A pseudo-Boolean function f is said to be submodular if       -    x  1    x  2    x  3     =     min   z  ∈  𝐁    z    (   2  -   x  1   -   x  2   -   x  3    )             subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3         subscript     z  𝐁    z     2   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       \displaystyle-x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}=\min_{z\in\mathbf{B}}z(2-x_{1}-x_{2}-x_{3})   for every x and y . This is a very important concept, because a submodular pseudo-boolean function can be minimized in polynomial time.  Roof Duality  If f is a quadratic polynomial, a concept called roof duality can be used to obtain a lower bound for its minimum value. 2 Roof duality may also provide a partial assignment of the variables, indicating some of the values of a minimizer to the polynomial. Several different methods of obtaining lower bounds were developed only to later be shown to be equivalent to what is now called roof duality. 3  Reductions  If the degree of f is greater than 2, one can always employ reductions to obtain an equivalent quadratic problem with additional variables. 4 One possible reduction is        -    x  1    x  2    x  3     =       min   z  ∈  𝐁    z    (    -   x  1    +   x  2   +   x  3    )    -    x  1    x  2    -    x  1    x  3     +   x  1     .           subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3             subscript     z  𝐁    z        subscript  x  1     subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  3      subscript  x  1      \displaystyle-x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}=\min_{z\in\mathbf{B}}z(-x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3})-x_{1}%
 x_{2}-x_{1}x_{3}+x_{1}.   There are other possibilities, for example,        f   (  𝒙  )    =       -   2   x  1     +   x  2    -   x  3    +   4   x  1    x  2    +   4   x  1    x  3     -   2   x  2    x  3    -   2   x  1    x  2    x  3      .        f  𝒙               2   subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2     subscript  x  3      4   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      4   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  3       2   subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3      2   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       \displaystyle f(\boldsymbol{x})=-2x_{1}+x_{2}-x_{3}+4x_{1}x_{2}+4x_{1}x_{3}-2x%
 _{2}x_{3}-2x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}.   Different reductions lead to different results. Take for example the following cubic polynomial: 5      (  0  ,  1  ,  1  )     0  1  1    {(0,1,1)}   Using the first reduction followed by roof duality, we obtain a lower bound of -3 and no indication on how to assign the three variables. Using the second reduction, we obtain the (tight) lower bound of -2 and the optimal assignment of every variable (which is   f   f   f   ).  Polynomial Compression Algorithms  Consider a pseudo-Boolean function     {   -  1   ,  1  }   n     superscript     1   1   n    \{-1,1\}^{n}   as a mapping from   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   to      f   (  x  )    =    ∑   I  ⊆   [  n  ]       f  ^    (  I  )     ∏   i  ∈  I     x  i       .        f  x     subscript     I   delimited-[]  n        normal-^  f   I    subscript  product    i  I     subscript  x  i        f(x)=\sum_{I\subseteq[n]}\hat{f}(I)\prod_{i\in I}x_{i}.   . Then     f  ^    (  I  )        normal-^  f   I    \hat{f}(I)   Assume that each coefficient   k   k   k   is integral. Then for an integer    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   the problem P of deciding whether   k   k   k   is more or equal to    O   (    k  2    log  k    )       O     superscript  k  2     k      O(k^{2}\log k)   is NP-complete. It is proved in 6 that in polynomial time we can either solve P or reduce the number of variables to   r   r   r   . Let   f   f   f   be the degree of the above multi-linear polynomial for    r   (   k  -  1   )       r    k  1     r(k-1)   . Then 7 proved that in polynomial time we can either solve P or reduce the number of variables to $r(k-1)$ .
