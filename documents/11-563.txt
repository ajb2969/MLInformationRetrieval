Sucrose-phosphatase




Sucrose-phosphatase

In enzymology, a sucrose-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sucrose 6F-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  sucrose + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sucrose 6F-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are sucrose and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sucrose-6F-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase, sucrose-phosphate hydrolase, sucrose-phosphate phosphohydrolase, and sucrose-6-phosphatase. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism.
