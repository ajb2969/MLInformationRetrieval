   Norm variety      Norm variety   In mathematics , a norm variety is a particular type of algebraic variety  V over a field  F , introduced for the purposes of algebraic K-theory by Voevodsky . The idea is to relate Milnor K-theory of F to geometric objects V , having function fields  F ( V ) that 'split' given 'symbols' (elements of Milnor K-groups). 1  The formulation is that p is a given prime number, different from the characteristic of F , and a symbol is the class mod p of an element      {   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   }      subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     \{a_{1},\dots,a_{n}\}     of the n -th Milnor K-group. A field extension is said to split the symbol, if its image in the K-group for that field is 0.  The conditions on a norm variety V are that V is irreducible and a non-singular  complete variety . Further it should have dimension  d equal to       p   n  -  1    -  1.       superscript  p    n  1    1.    p^{n-1}-1.     The key condition is in terms of the d -th Newton polynomial  s d , evaluated on the (algebraic) total Chern class of the tangent bundle of V . This number       s  d    (  V  )        subscript  s  d   V    s_{d}(V)     should not be divisible by p 2 , it being known it is divisible by p .  Examples  These include ( n = 2) cases of the Severi–Brauer variety and ( p = 2) Pfister forms . There is an existence theorem in the general case (paper of Markus Rost cited).
