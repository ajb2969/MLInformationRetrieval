   Galactarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase      Galactarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactarate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   feruloyl-CoA + galactarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-feruloylgalactarate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are feruloyl-CoA and galactarate , whereas its two products are CoA and O-feruloylgalactarate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is feruloyl-CoA:galactarate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase . This enzyme is also called galacturate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase .
