   Angular aperture      Angular aperture   (Figure)  The angular aperture of a thin lens with focal point at F and an aperture of diameter   d   d   d   .|thumb|250px   The angular aperture of a lens is the apparent angle of the lens aperture as seen from the focal point :      a  =   2   arctan   (    D  /  2   f   )     =   2   arctan   (   D   2  f    )           a    2        D  2   f            2      D    2  f         a=2\arctan\left(\frac{D/2}{f}\right)=2\arctan\left(\frac{D}{2f}\right)     where     f   f   f   is the focal length     D   D   D   is the diameter of the aperture .  Relation to numerical aperture  In a medium with an index of refraction close to 1, such as air, the angular aperture is approximately equal to twice the numerical aperture of the lens. 1  Formally, the numerical aperture in air is:      NA  =   sin   a  /  2    =   sin   arctan   (   D   2  f    )           NA      a  2               D    2  f         \mathrm{NA}=\sin a/2=\sin\arctan\left(\frac{D}{2f}\right)     In the paraxial approximation , with a small aperture, $D :
