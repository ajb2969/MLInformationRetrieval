The angular aperture of a lens is the apparent angle of the lens aperture as seen from the focal point:



where


 
  is the focal length


 
  is the diameter of the aperture.
Relation to numerical aperture
In a medium with an index of refraction close to 1, such as air, the angular aperture is approximately equal to twice the numerical aperture of the lens.1
Formally, the numerical aperture in air is:



In the paraxial approximation, with a small aperture, $D:
