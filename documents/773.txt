   Pregaussian class      Pregaussian class   In probability theory , a pregaussian class or pregaussian set of functions is a set of functions, square integrable with respect to some probability measure , such that there exists a certain Gaussian process , indexed by this set, satisfying the conditions below.  Definition  For a probability space ( S , Σ, P ), denote by     L  P  2    (  S  )        subscript   superscript  L  2   P   S    L^{2}_{P}(S)   a set of square integrable with respect to P functions    f  :   S  →  R      normal-:  f   normal-→  S  R     f:S\to R   , that is       ∫     f  2    d  P    <  ∞           superscript  f  2   d  P       \int f^{2}\,dP<\infty     Consider a set    ℱ  ⊂    L  P  2    (  S  )        ℱ     subscript   superscript  L  2   P   S     \mathcal{F}\subset L^{2}_{P}(S)   . There exists a Gaussian process     G  P     subscript  G  P    G_{P}   , indexed by   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , with mean 0 and covariance        Cov   (    G  P    (  f  )    ,    G  P    (  g  )    )    =   E   G  P    (  f  )    G  P    (  g  )    =    ∫   f   g   d  P    -   ∫    f   d  P   ∫    g   d  P  for  f        ,   g  ∈  ℱ      formulae-sequence       Cov     subscript  G  P   f      subscript  G  P   g      E   subscript  G  P   f   subscript  G  P   g              f  g  d  P        f  d  P      g  d  P  for  f           g  ℱ     \operatorname{Cov}(G_{P}(f),G_{P}(g))=EG_{P}(f)G_{P}(g)=\int fg\,dP-\int f\,dP%
 \int g\,dP\text{ for }f,g\in\mathcal{F}   Such a process exists because the given covariance is positive definite. This covariance defines a semi-inner product as well as a pseudometric on     L  P  2    (  S  )        subscript   superscript  L  2   P   S    L^{2}_{P}(S)   given by        ϱ  P    (  f  ,  g  )    =    (   E    (     G  P    (  f  )    -    G  P    (  g  )     )   2    )    1  /  2           subscript  ϱ  P    f  g     superscript    E   superscript       subscript  G  P   f      subscript  G  P   g    2      1  2      \varrho_{P}(f,g)=(E(G_{P}(f)-G_{P}(g))^{2})^{1/2}     Definition A class    ℱ  ⊂    L  P  2    (  S  )        ℱ     subscript   superscript  L  2   P   S     \mathcal{F}\subset L^{2}_{P}(S)   is called pregaussian if for each     ω  ∈  S   ,      ω  S    \omega\in S,   the function    f  ↦    G  P    (  f  )    (  ω  )       maps-to  f     subscript  G  P   f  ω     f\mapsto G_{P}(f)(\omega)   on   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is bounded,    ϱ  P     subscript  ϱ  P    \varrho_{P}   -uniformly continuous, and prelinear.  Brownian bridge  The    G  P     subscript  G  P    G_{P}   process is a generalization of the brownian bridge . Consider     S  =   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,      S   0  1     S=[0,1],   with P being the uniform measure . In this case, the    G  P     subscript  G  P    G_{P}   process indexed by the indicator functions     I   [  0  ,  x  ]      subscript  I   0  x     I_{[0,x]}   , for     x  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,      x   0  1     x\in[0,1],   is in fact the standard brownian bridge  B ( x ). This set of the indicator functions is pregaussian, moreover, it is the Donsker class .  References     "  Category:Probability theory  Category:Empirical process
