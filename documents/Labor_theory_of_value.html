<h1>Labor theory of value</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>labor theory of value</strong> (<strong>LTV</strong>) is a <a href="heterodox_economic" title="wikilink">heterodox economic</a> <a href="theory_of_value_(economics)" title="wikilink">theory of value</a> that argues that the <a href="Value_(economics)" title="wikilink">economic value</a> of a good or service is determined by the total amount of socially necessary labor required to produce it, rather than by the use or pleasure its owner gets from it. At present this concept is usually associated with <a href="Marxian_economics" title="wikilink">Marxian economics</a>, although it is also used in the theories of earlier <a href="Classical_economics" title="wikilink">classical economists</a> such as <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a> and <a href="David_Ricardo" title="wikilink">David Ricardo</a> and later also in <a href="anarchist_economics" title="wikilink">anarchist economics</a>. It is not accepted by contemporary <a href="mainstream_economics" title="wikilink">mainstream economists</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definitions-of-value-and-labor">Definitions of value and labor</h2>

<p>When speaking in terms of a labor theory of value, <strong>value</strong>, without any qualifying adjective should theoretically refer to the amount of labor necessary to the production of a marketable commodity, including the labor necessary to the development of any real capital employed in the production. Both <a href="David_Ricardo#Value_theory" title="wikilink">David Ricardo</a> and <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> attempted to quantify and embody all labor components in order to develop a theory of the real price, or natural price of a commodity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The labor theory of value, as presented by <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a>, however, did not require the quantification of all past labor, nor did it deal with the labor needed to create the tools (capital) that might be employed in the production of a commodity. The Smith theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that Smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labor it would command in others (value in trade) or whatever labor it would "save" the self (value in use), or both. But this "value" is subject to supply and demand at a particular time.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. (<em>Wealth of Nations</em> Book 1, chapter V)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smith's theory of price (which for many is the same as value) has nothing to do with the past labor spent in the production of a commodity. It speaks only of the labor that can be "commanded" or "saved" at present. If there is no use for a buggy whip then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use, regardless of all the labor spent in its creation.</p>
<h3 id="distinctions-of-economically-pertinent-labor">Distinctions of economically pertinent labor</h3>

<p><strong>Value "in use"</strong> is the <a class="uri" href="usefulness" title="wikilink">usefulness</a> of this commodity, its <a class="uri" href="utility" title="wikilink">utility</a>. A classical <a href="paradox_of_value" title="wikilink">paradox</a> often comes up when considering this type of value. In the words of Adam Smith:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called 'value in use ;' the other, 'value in exchange.' The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it. (<em>Wealth of Nations</em> Book 1, chapter IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Value "in <a href="trade" title="wikilink">exchange</a>"</strong> is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity (in other words, its <a class="uri" href="price" title="wikilink">price</a> in the case of <a class="uri" href="money" title="wikilink">money</a>). It is relative to labor as explained by Adam Smith:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The value of any commodity, ... <em>to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities</em>, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the <em>exchangeable value</em> of all commodities (<em>Wealth of Nations</em> Book 1, chapter V; emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Value</strong> (without qualification) is the labor embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production. Marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition. In his terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. To <a href="David_Ricardo" title="wikilink">Ricardo</a> and other classical economists, this definition serves as a measure of "real cost", "absolute value", or a "measure of value" invariable under changes in distribution and technology.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Ricardo, other classical economists, and Marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labor value. They thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies.</p>

<p>Other supporters of the labor theory of value used the word "value" in the second sense, to represent "exchange value".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="ltv-and-the-labor-process">LTV and the labor process</h2>

<p>Since the term <em>value</em> is understood in the LTV as denoting something created by labor, and its "magnitude" as something proportional to the quantity of labor performed, it is important to explain how the labor process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it creates.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labor performed on average for its production. Part of what the LTV means by "socially necessary" is that the value only increases in proportion to this labor as it is performed with average skill and average productivity. So though workers may labor with greater skill or more productivity than others, these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity. Each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity. By working sloppily, unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labor, thus increasing the average labor time necessary for the production of each unit commodity. But these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labor process at a higher price (as opposed to value) simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities.</p>

<p>However, production not only involves labor, but also certain means of labor: tools, materials, power plants and so on. These means of labor — also known as <a href="means_of_production" title="wikilink">means of production</a> — are often the product of another labor process as well. So the labor process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value. Labor also requires other means of production that are not produced with labor and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms of means of production resulting from another labor process, LTV treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labor process. Due to the constancy of their value, these means of production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.</p>

<p>Consider for example workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee. In performing this labor, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee. The worker also transfers the value of constant capital — the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; and the value of the cup — to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labor previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labor — this constant capital — and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.</p>

, into two parts. The first part is the portion of the process when the workers add value equivalent to the wages they are paid. For example, if the period in question is one week and these workers collectively are paid $1,000, then the time necessary to add $1,000 to — while preserving the value of — constant capital is considered the necessary labor portion of the period (or week): denoted

. The value used to purchase labor-power, for example the $1,000 paid in wages to these workers for the week, is called variable capital (

). This is because in contrast to the constant capital expended on means of production, variable capital can add value in the labor process. The amount it adds depends on the duration, intensity, productivity and skill of the labor-power purchased: in this sense the buyer of labor-power has purchased a commodity of variable use. Finally, the value added during the portion of the period when surplus labor is performed is called surplus value (

<h2 id="the-relation-between-values-and-prices">The relation between values and prices</h2>

<p>One issue facing the LTV is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other. If a commodity's value is not the same as its price, and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ, then what is the relation between the two, if any? Various LTV schools of thought provide different answers to this question. For example, some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labor embodied in a good acts as a center of gravity for price.</p>

<p>However, most economists would say that cases where pricing is even approximately equal to the value of the labor embodied are only special cases, and not the general case. In the standard formulation, prices also normally include a level of income for "<a href="Capital_(economics)" title="wikilink">capital</a>" and "<a href="Land_(economics)" title="wikilink">land</a>". These incomes are known as "<a href="Profit_(economics)" title="wikilink">profit</a>" and "<a href="Economic_rent" title="wikilink">rent</a>" respectively.</p>

<p>In Book 1, chapter VI, Adam Smith writes:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final sentence explains how Smith sees value of a product as relative to labor of buyer or consumer, as opposite to Marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labor of laborer or producer. And we value things, price them, based on how much labor we can avoid or command, and we can command labor not only in a simple way but also by <a href="Trade" title="wikilink">trading</a> things for a profit.</p>

<p>The demonstration of the relation between commodities' unit values and their respective prices is known in Marxian terminology as the <a href="transformation_problem" title="wikilink">transformation problem</a> or the transformation of values into prices of production. The transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the LTV. The problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labor, in proportion to its duration and intensity, is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced. If there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation, then the relation between values (proportional to labor) and prices (proportional to total capital advanced) is incomplete. Various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation, but the debate has not reached any clear resolution.</p>

<p>LTV does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price, since the price of a commodity is something other than its value. In <em>Value, Price and Profit</em> (1865), <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> quotes <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a> and sums up:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It suffices to say that if supply and demand equilibrate each other, the market prices of commodities will correspond with their natural prices, that is to say, with their values as determined by the respective quantities of labor required for their production.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The LTV seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium. This could be explained by a <em><a href="cost_of_production" title="wikilink">cost of production</a></em> argument—pointing out that all costs are ultimately labor costs, but this does not account for profit, and it is vulnerable to the charge of <a href="Tautology_(rhetoric)" title="wikilink">tautology</a> in that it explains prices by prices.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Marx later called this "Smith's adding up theory of value".</p>

<p>Smith argues that labor values are the natural measure of exchange for direct producers like hunters and fishermen.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Marx, on the other hand, uses a measurement analogy, arguing that for commodities to be comparable they must have a common element or substance by which to measure them,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and that labor is a common substance of what Marx eventually calls <em>commodity-values</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="origins-of-the-labor-theory-of-value">Origins of the labor theory of value</h3>

<p>The labor theory of value has developed over many centuries. It had no single originator, but rather many different thinkers arrived at the same conclusion independently. Aristotle is claimed to hold to this view.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some writers trace its origin to <a href="Thomas_Aquinas" title="wikilink">Thomas Aquinas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In his <em><a href="Summa_Theologica" title="wikilink">Summa Theologiae</a></em> (1265–1274) he expresses the view that "... value can, does and should increase in relation to the amount of labor which has been expended in the improvement of commodities."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Scholars such as <a href="Joseph_Schumpeter" title="wikilink">Joseph Schumpeter</a> have cited <a href="Ibn_Khaldun" title="wikilink">Ibn Khaldun</a>, who in his <em><a class="uri" href="Muqaddimah" title="wikilink">Muqaddimah</a></em> (1377), described labor as the source of value, necessary for all earnings and capital accumulation. He argued that even if earning “results from something other than a craft, the value of the resulting profit and acquired (capital) must (also) include the value of the labor by which it was obtained. Without labor, it would not have been acquired.”<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Scholars have also pointed to <a href="Sir_William_Petty" title="wikilink">Sir William Petty</a>'s <em>Treatise of Taxes</em> of 1662<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and to <a href="John_Locke" title="wikilink">John Locke</a>'s <a href="labor_theory_of_property" title="wikilink">labor theory of property</a>, set out in the <em><a href="Two_Treatises_of_Government" title="wikilink">Second Treatise on Government</a></em> (1689), which sees labor as the ultimate source of economic value. <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Karl Marx</a> himself credited <a href="Benjamin_Franklin" title="wikilink">Benjamin Franklin</a> in his 1729 essay entitled "A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency" as being "one of the first" to advance the theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a> accepted the theory for pre-capitalist societies but saw a flaw in its application to contemporary <a class="uri" href="capitalism" title="wikilink">capitalism</a>. He pointed out that if the "labor embodied" in a product equaled the "labor commanded" (i.e. the amount of labor that could be purchased by selling it), then profit was impossible. <a href="David_Ricardo" title="wikilink">David Ricardo</a> (seconded by <a href="Karl_Marx" title="wikilink">Marx</a>) responded to this paradox by arguing that Smith had confused labor with wages. "Labor commanded", he argued, would always be more than the labor needed to sustain itself (wages). The value of labor, in this view, covered not just the value of wages (what Marx called the value of <a href="labor_power" title="wikilink">labor power</a>), but the value of the entire product created by labor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Ricardo's theory was a predecessor of the modern theory that equilibrium prices are determined solely by <a href="Cost-of-production_theory_of_value" title="wikilink">production costs</a> associated with <a class="uri" href="Neo-Ricardianism" title="wikilink">Neo-Ricardianism</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>Based on the discrepancy between the wages of labor and the value of the product, the "<a href="Ricardian_socialists" title="wikilink">Ricardian socialists</a>" — <a href="Charles_Hall" title="wikilink">Charles Hall</a>, <a href="Thomas_Hodgskin" title="wikilink">Thomas Hodgskin</a>, <a href="John_Gray_(19th_century_socialist)" title="wikilink">John Gray</a>, and <a href="John_Francis_Bray" title="wikilink">John Francis Bray</a>, and <a href="Percy_Ravenstone" title="wikilink">Percy Ravenstone</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> — applied Ricardo's theory to develop theories of <a href="Exploitation_of_labour" title="wikilink">exploitation</a>.</p>

<p>Marx expanded on these ideas, arguing that workers work for a part of each day adding the value required to cover their wages, while the remainder of their labor is performed for the enrichment of the capitalist. The LTV and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought.</p>

<p>19th century <a href="American_individualist_anarchists" title="wikilink">American individualist anarchists</a> based their economics on the LTV, with their particular interpretation of it being called "<a href="Cost_the_limit_of_price" title="wikilink">Cost the limit of price</a>". They, as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition, hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labor required to produce it. Hence, they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labor.</p>
<h3 id="adam-smith-and-david-ricardo">Adam Smith and David Ricardo</h3>

<p>Adam Smith held that, in a primitive society, the amount of labor put into producing a good determined its exchange value, with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labor a good can purchase. However, according to Smith, in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labor cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production: "The whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> "Nevertheless, the 'real value' of such a commodity produced in advanced society is measured by the labor which that commodity will command in exchange. ... But [Smith] disowns what is naturally thought of as the genuine classical labor theory of value, that labor-cost regulates market-value. This theory was Ricardo’s, and really his alone."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p>Classical economist David Ricardo's labor theory of value holds that the <a href="Value_(economics)" title="wikilink">value</a> of a <a href="good_(economics)" title="wikilink">good</a> (how much of another good or service it exchanges for in the market) is proportional to how much <a href="labour_(economics)" title="wikilink">labor</a> was required to produce it, including the labor required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in the process. David Ricardo stated it as, "The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour." (Ricardo 1817) In this heading Ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labor necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the laborers for its production. However, Ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labor required to produce them. For example, he said "I cannot get over the difficulty of the wine, which is kept in the cellar for three or four years [i.e., while constantly increasing in exchange value], or that of the oak tree, which perhaps originally had not 2 s. expended on it in the way of labour, and yet comes to be worth £100."(Quoted in Whitaker) Of course, a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage. If anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich, that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine. There is also the theory that adding to the price of a luxury product increases its exchange-value by mere prestige.</p>

<p>The labor theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the <a href="subjective_theory_of_value" title="wikilink">subjective theory of value</a>, which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labor was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity. Ricardo's labor theory of value is not a <a href="Normative_economics" title="wikilink">normative</a> theory, as are some later forms of the labor theory, such as claims that it is <em>immoral</em> for an individual to be paid less for his labor than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces.</p>

<p>It is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labor theory of value as it is commonly defined.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> For instance, <a href="David_Ricardo" title="wikilink">David Ricardo</a> theorized that prices are determined by the amount of labor but found exceptions for which the labor theory could not account. In a letter, he wrote: "I am not satisfied with the explanation I have given of the principles which regulate value." <a href="Adam_Smith" title="wikilink">Adam Smith</a> theorized that the labor theory of value holds true only in the "early and rude state of society" but not in a modern economy where owners of capital are compensated by profit. As a result, "Smith ends up making little use of a labor theory of value."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

"All the goods offered for sale in Warren's store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them, plus a small surcharge, in the neighborhood of 4 to 7 percent, to cover store overhead."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> The store stayed open for three years; after it closed, Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on <a href="Mutualism_(economic_theory)" title="wikilink">mutualism</a>.

<h3 id="karl-marx">Karl Marx</h3>

<p>Contrary to popular belief,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Marx opposed "ascribing a supernatural creative power to labor", arguing that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Labor is not the source of all wealth. Nature is just as much a source of use values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labor, which is itself only the manifestation of a force of nature, human labor power.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here Marx was distinguishing between <a href="exchange_value" title="wikilink">exchange value</a> (the subject of the LTV) and <a href="use_value" title="wikilink">use value</a>.</p>

<p>Marx used the concept of "<a href="socially_necessary_labour_time" title="wikilink">socially necessary abstract labor-time</a>" to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and <a href="neoclassical_economics" title="wikilink">neoclassical economics</a>. Whereas most economists start with the individual's perspective, Marx started with the perspective of society <em>as a whole</em>. "Social production" involves a complicated and interconnected <a href="division_of_labour" title="wikilink">division of labor</a> of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity. <a href="Abstract_labour_and_concrete_labour" title="wikilink">"Abstract" labor</a> refers to a characteristic of <a class="uri" href="commodity" title="wikilink">commodity</a>-producing labor that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous (concrete) types of labor. That is, the concept abstracts from the <em>particular</em> characteristics of all of the labor and is akin to average labor.</p>

<p>"Socially necessary" labor refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity "in a given state of society, under certain social average conditions or production, with a given social average intensity, and average skill of the labour employed."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> That is, the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions. This explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business. Finally, it is not labor per se, which creates value, but labor power sold by free wage workers to capitalists. Another distinction to be made is that between <a href="Productive_and_unproductive_labour" title="wikilink">productive and unproductive labor</a>. Only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce value.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="criticisms">Criticisms</h2>

<p>The Marxist labor theory of value has been criticised on several counts. It predicts that profits will be higher in labor-intensive industries than in capital-intensive industries, and empirical data contradicts this. This is sometimes referred to as the "Great Contradiction."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> In volume 3 of Capital, Marx attempts to explain why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labor-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not this is consistent with the labor theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn49" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> According to Marx, surplus value is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not the just variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution by capital, while labor-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn50" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>The theory can also be sometimes found in non-Marxist traditions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn51" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> For instance <a href="Mutualism_(economic_theory)" title="wikilink">mutualist</a> <a class="uri" href="anarchist" title="wikilink">anarchist</a> theorist <a href="Kevin_Carson" title="wikilink">Kevin Carson</a>'s <em><a href="Studies_in_Mutualist_Political_Economy" title="wikilink">Studies in Mutualist Political Economy</a></em> opens with an attempt to integrate <a class="uri" href="marginalist" title="wikilink">marginalist</a> critiques into the labor theory of value.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Some Post-Keynesian economists have been highly critical of the labor theory of value. <a href="Joan_Robinson" title="wikilink">Joan Robinson</a>, who herself was considered an expert on the writings of Karl Marx, wrote that the labor theory of value was largely a tautology and "a typical example of the way metaphysical ideas operate".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>Others have argued that the labor theory of value, especially as it arises in the work of Karl Marx, is due to a failure to recognize the fundamentally dialectical nature of how human beings attribute value to objects. Pilkington writes that value is attributed to objects based on our desire for them and that this desire is always inter-subjective and socially determined. He writes that:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>[V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers. [A] medal [or an enemy] flag are not valued for their objective properties, nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them, rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the inter-subjective network of desires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pilkington insists that this is an entirely different conception of value than the one we find in the marginalist theory found in many economics textbooks. He writes that "actors in marginalist analysis have self-contained preferences; they do not have inter-subjective desires".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
