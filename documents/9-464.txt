Aronszajn line

In mathematical set theory, an Aronszajn line (named after Nachman Aronszajn) is a linear ordering of cardinality 
 
 
 
  which contains no subset order-isomorphic to



 
  with the usual ordering
the reverse of 
 
 

an uncountable subset of the Real numbers with the usual ordering.

Unlike Suslin lines, the existence of Aronszajn lines is provable using the standard axioms of set theory. A linear ordering is an Aronszajn line if and only if it is the lexicographical ordering of some Aronszajn tree.1
