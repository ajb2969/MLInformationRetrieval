   Aronszajn line      Aronszajn line   In mathematical set theory , an Aronszajn line (named after Nachman Aronszajn ) is a linear ordering of cardinality    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   which contains no subset order-isomorphic to        ω  1      subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}\,   with the usual ordering  the reverse of     ω  1      subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}\,     an uncountable subset of the Real numbers with the usual ordering.   Unlike Suslin lines , the existence of Aronszajn lines is provable using the standard axioms of set theory. A linear ordering is an Aronszajn line if and only if it is the lexicographical ordering of some Aronszajn tree . 1  References    "  Category:Order theory     ↩
