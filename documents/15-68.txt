   Jacobson's conjecture      Jacobson's conjecture   In abstract algebra , Jacobson's conjecture is an open problem in ring theory concerning the intersection of powers of the Jacobson radical of a Noetherian ring .  It has only been proven for special types of Noetherian rings, so far. Examples exist to show that the conjecture can fail when the ring is not Noetherian on a side, so it is absolutely necessary for the ring to be two-sided Noetherian.  The conjecture is named for the algebraist Nathan Jacobson who posed the first version of the conjecture.  Statement  For a ring R with Jacobson radical J , the nonnegative powers J n are defined by using the product of ideals .   Jacobson's conjecture: In a right-and-left Noetherian ring ,       ⋂   n  ∈  ℕ     J  n    =   {  0  }    .        subscript     n  ℕ     superscript  J  n     0     \bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}J^{n}=\{0\}.      In other words: "The only element of a Noetherian ring in all powers of J is 0."  The original conjecture posed by Jacobson in 1956 1 asked about noncommutative one-sided Noetherian rings, however Herstein produced a counterexample in 1965 and soon after Jategaonkar produced a different example which was a left principal ideal domain . From that point on, the conjecture was reformulated to require two-sided Noetherian rings.  Partial results  Jacobson's conjecture has been verified for particular types of Noetherian rings:   Commutative Noetherian rings all satisfy Jacobson's conjecture. This is a consequence of the Krull intersection theorem .
