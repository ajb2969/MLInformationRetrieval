   Variance inflation factor      Variance inflation factor   In statistics , the variance inflation factor (VIF) quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in an ordinary least squares  regression analysis. It provides an index that measures how much the variance (the square of the estimate's standard deviation ) of an estimated regression coefficient is increased because of collinearity.  Definition  Consider the following linear model with k independent variables:   Y = β 0 + β 1  X 1 + β 2  X  2 + ... + β k  X k + ε .   The standard error of the estimate of β j is the square root of the j +1, j +1 element of s 2 ( X ′ X ) −1 , where s is the root mean squared error (RMSE) (note that RMSE 2 is an unbiased estimator of the true variance of the error term,    σ  2     superscript  σ  2    \sigma^{2}   ); X is the regression design matrix — a matrix such that X i , j +1 is the value of the j th independent variable for the i th case or observation, and such that X i , 1 equals 1 for all i . It turns out that the square of this standard error, the estimated variance of the estimate of β j , can be equivalently expressed as         var  ^    (    β  ^   j   )    =     s  2     (   n  -  1   )    var  ^    (   X  j   )     ⋅   1   1  -   R  j  2       ,         normal-^  var    subscript   normal-^  β   j     normal-⋅     superscript  s  2       n  1    normal-^  var    subscript  X  j       1    1   superscript   subscript  R  j   2        {\rm\widehat{var}}(\hat{\beta}_{j})=\frac{s^{2}}{(n-1)\widehat{\rm var}(X_{j})%
 }\cdot\frac{1}{1-R_{j}^{2}},     ''' ''' where R j 2 is the multiple R 2 for the regression of X j on the other covariates (a regression that does not involve the response variable Y ). This identity separates the influences of several distinct factors on the variance of the coefficient estimate:   s 2 : greater scatter in the data around the regression surface leads to proportionately more variance in the coefficient estimates    n : greater sample size results in proportionately less variance in the coefficient estimates         var  ^    (   X  j   )        normal-^  var    subscript  X  j     \widehat{\rm var}(X_{j})   : greater variability in a particular covariate leads to proportionately less variance in the corresponding coefficient estimate   The remaining term, 1 / (1 − R j 2 ) is the VIF. It reflects all other factors that influence the uncertainty in the coefficient estimates. The VIF equals 1 when the vector X j is orthogonal to each column of the design matrix for the regression of X j on the other covariates. By contrast, the VIF is greater than 1 when the vector X j is not orthogonal to all columns of the design matrix for the regression of X j on the other covariates. Finally, note that the VIF is invariant to the scaling of the variables (that is, we could scale each variable X j by a constant c j without changing the VIF).  Calculation and analysis  The VIF can be calculated and analyzed in three steps:  Step one  Calculate k different VIFs, one for each X i by first running an ordinary least square regression that has X i as a function of all the other explanatory variables in the first equation. If i = 1, for example, the equation would be       X  1   =     α  2    X  2    +    α  3    X  3    +  ⋯  +    α  k    X  k    +   c  0   +  e        subscript  X  1        subscript  α  2    subscript  X  2       subscript  α  3    subscript  X  3    normal-⋯     subscript  α  k    subscript  X  k     subscript  c  0   e     X_{1}=\alpha_{2}X_{2}+\alpha_{3}X_{3}+\cdots+\alpha_{k}X_{k}+c_{0}+e     where c 0 is a constant and e is the error term .  Step two  Then, calculate the VIF factor for     β  ^   i     subscript   normal-^  β   i    \hat{\beta}_{i}   with the following formula:      VIF  =   1   1  -   R  i  2         VIF    1    1   subscript   superscript  R  2   i       \mathrm{VIF}=\frac{1}{1-R^{2}_{i}}     where R 2 i is the coefficient of determination of the regression equation in step one, but with    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   on the left hand side, and all other predictor variables (all the other X variables) on the right hand side.  Step three  Analyze the magnitude of multicollinearity by considering the size of the    VIF   (    β  ^   i   )      VIF   subscript   normal-^  β   i     \operatorname{VIF}(\hat{\beta}_{i})   . A rule of thumb is that if     VIF   (    β  ^   i   )    >  10       VIF   subscript   normal-^  β   i    10    \operatorname{VIF}(\hat{\beta}_{i})>10   then multicollinearity is high. 1  Some software calculates the tolerance which is just the reciprocal of the VIF. The choice of which to use is a matter of personal preference of the researcher.  Interpretation  The square root of the variance inflation factor tells you how much larger the standard error is, compared with what it would be if that variable were uncorrelated with the other predictor variables in the model.  Example If the variance inflation factor of a predictor variable were 5.27 (√5.27 = 2.3) this means that the standard error for the coefficient of that predictor variable is 2.3 times as large as it would be if that predictor variable were uncorrelated with the other predictor variables.
