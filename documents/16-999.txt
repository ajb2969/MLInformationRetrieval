Summability kernel

In mathematics, a summability kernel is a family or sequence of periodic integrable functions satisfying a certain set of properties, listed below. Certain kernels, such as the Fejér kernel, are particularly useful in Fourier analysis. Summability kernels are related to approximation of the identity; definitions of an approximation of identity vary,1 but sometimes the definition of an approximation of the identity is taken to be the same as for a summability kernel.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
 . A summability kernel is a sequence 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  that satisfies






 
  (uniformly bounded)


 
  as 
 
 
 
 , for every 
 
 
 
 .

Note that if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  is a positive summability kernel, then the second requirement follows automatically from the first.
If instead we take the convention 
 
 
 
 , the first equation becomes 
 
 
 
 , and the upper limit of integration on the third equation should be extended to 
 
 
 
 .
We can also consider 
 
 
 
  rather than 
 
 
 
 ; then we integrate (1) and (2) over 
 
 
 
 , and (3) over 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

The Fejér kernel
The Poisson kernel (continuous index)
The Dirichlet kernel is not a summability kernel, since it fails the second requirement.

Convolutions
Let 
 
 
 
  be a summability kernel, and 
 
 
 
  denote the convolution operation.

If 
 
 
 
  (continuous functions on 
 
 
 
 ), then 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , i.e. uniformly, as 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , as 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is radially decreasing symmetric and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
pointwise a.e., as 
 
 
 
 . This uses the Hardy–Littlewood maximal function. If 
 
 
 
  is not radially decreasing symmetric, but the decreasing symmetrization 
 
 
 
  satisfies 
 
 
 
 , then a.e. convergence still holds, using a similar argument.
