   Microsomal epoxide hydrolase      Microsomal epoxide hydrolase   In enzymology , a microsomal epoxide hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cis-stilbene oxide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)-(1R,2R)-1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cis-stilbene oxide and H 2 O , whereas its product is (+)-(1R,2R)-1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-stilbene-oxide hydrolase . Other names in common use include epoxide hydratase (ambiguous) , microsomal epoxide hydratase (ambiguous) , epoxide hydrase , microsomal epoxide hydrase , arene-oxide hydratase (ambiguous) , benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-oxide hydratase , benzo(a)pyrene-4,5-epoxide hydratase , aryl epoxide hydrase (ambiguous) , cis-epoxide hydrolase , and mEH . This enzyme participates in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450 .  It should also be noted that this class of enzymes plays a role in the uptake of bile salts within the large intestine. It functions as a Na+ dependent transporter.  References   Boyer, P.D. (Ed.), The Enzymes, 3rd ed., vol. 7, Academic Press, New York, 1972, p. 199-212.
