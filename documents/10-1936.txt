   5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase      5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxohept-3-enedioate + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate, and two products , 2-oxohept-3-enedioate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate carboxy-lyase (2-oxohept-3-enedioate-forming) . Other names in common use include 5-carboxymethyl-2-oxo-hex-3-ene-1,6-dioate decarboxylase , and 5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
