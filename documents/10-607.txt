   Ribitol-5-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase      Ribitol-5-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a ribitol-5-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-ribitol 5-phosphate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribulose 5-phosphate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-ribitol 5-phosphate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are D-ribulose 5-phosphate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-ribitol-5-phosphate:NAD(P) + 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called dehydrogenase, ribitol 5-phosphate . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .
