   Euclid's orchard      Euclid's orchard   In mathematics , informally speaking, Euclid's orchard is an array of one-dimensional "trees" of unit height planted at the lattice points in one quadrant of a square lattice . 1 More formally, Euclid's orchard is the set of line segments from ( i , j , 0) to ( i , j , 1) where i and j are positive integers.  The trees visible from the origin are those at lattice points ( m , n , 0) where m and n are coprime , i.e., where the fraction m ⁄ n is in reduced form . The name Euclid's orchard is derived from the Euclidean algorithm .  If the orchard is projected relative to the origin onto the plane x + y =1 (or, equivalently, drawn in perspective from a viewpoint at the origin) the tops of the trees form a graph of Thomae's function . The point ( m , n , 1) projects to       (   m   m  +  n    ,   n   m  +  n    ,   1   m  +  n    )   .       m    m  n      n    m  n      1    m  n      \left(\frac{m}{m+n},\frac{n}{m+n},\frac{1}{m+n}\right).
