   Phenylacetyl-CoA hydrolase      Phenylacetyl-CoA hydrolase   In enzymology , a phenylacetyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phenylglyoxylyl-CoA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylglyoxylate + CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phenylglyoxylyl-CoA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are phenylglyoxylate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylglyoxylyl-CoA hydrolase .
