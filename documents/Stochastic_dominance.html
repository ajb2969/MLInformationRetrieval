<h1>Stochastic dominance</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Stochastic dominance</strong><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is a form of <a href="stochastic_ordering" title="wikilink">stochastic ordering</a>. The concept arises in <a href="decision_theory" title="wikilink">decision theory</a> and <a href="decision_analysis" title="wikilink">decision analysis</a> in situations where one gamble (a <a href="probability_distribution" title="wikilink">probability distribution</a> over possible outcomes, also known as prospects) can be ranked as superior to another gamble for a broad class of decision-makers. It is based on shared <a href="preference_(economics)" title="wikilink">preferences</a> regarding sets of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Only limited knowledge of preferences is required for determining dominance. <a href="Risk_aversion" title="wikilink">Risk aversion</a> is a factor only in second order stochastic dominance.</p>
<p>Stochastic dominance does not give a <a href="total_order" title="wikilink">total order</a>, but rather only a <a href="partial_order" title="wikilink">partial order</a>: for some pairs of gambles, neither one stochastically dominates the other, since different members of the broad class of decision-makers will differ regarding which gamble is preferable without them generally being considered to be equally attractive.</p>
<p>A related concept not included under stochastic dominance is <strong>deterministic dominance</strong>, which occurs when the least preferable outcome of gamble A is more valuable than the most highly preferred outcome of gamble B.</p>
<h2 id="statewise-dominance">Statewise dominance</h2>
<p>The simplest case of stochastic dominance is <strong>statewise dominance</strong> (also known as <strong>state-by-state dominance</strong>), defined as follows: gamble A is statewise dominant over gamble B if A gives at least as good a result in every state (every possible set of outcomes), and a strictly better result in at least one state. For example, if a dollar is added to one or more prizes in a lottery, the new lottery statewise dominates the old one because it yields a better payout regardless of the specific numbers realized by the lottery. Similarly, if a risk insurance policy has a lower premium and a better coverage than another policy, then with or without damage, the outcome is better. Anyone who prefers more to less (in the standard terminology, anyone who has <a href="monotonic" title="wikilink">monotonically</a> increasing preferences) will always prefer a statewise dominant gamble.</p>
<h2 id="first-order-stochastic-dominance">First-order stochastic dominance</h2>
<p>Statewise dominance is a special case of the canonical <strong>first-order stochastic dominance</strong>, defined as follows: Gamble A has first-order stochastic dominance over gamble B if for any outcome <em>x</em>, A gives at least as high a probability of receiving at least <em>x</em> as does B, and for some <em>x</em>, A gives a higher probability of receiving at least <em>x</em>. In notation form, <span class="LaTeX">$P [A \ge x]\ge P [B \ge x]$</span> for all <em>x</em>, and for some <em>x</em>, <span class="LaTeX">$P[A \ge x]>P[B \ge x]$</span>.</p>
<p>In terms of the <a href="cumulative_distribution_function" title="wikilink">cumulative distribution functions</a> of the two gambles, A dominating B means that <span class="LaTeX">$F_A(x) \le F_B(x)$</span> for all <em>x</em>, with strict inequality at some <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>Gamble A first-order stochastically dominates gamble B <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> every <a href="expected_utility_hypothesis" title="wikilink">expected utility</a> maximizer with an increasing <a href="utility" title="wikilink">utility function</a> prefers gamble A over gamble B.</p>
<p>First-order stochastic dominance can also be expressed as follows: If and only if A first-order stochastically dominates B, there exists some gamble <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$x_B \overset {d}{=} (x_A+y)$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$y\le 0$</span> in all possible states (and strictly negative in at least one state); here <span class="LaTeX">$\overset{d}{=}$</span> means "<a href="Random_variable#Equality_in_distribution" title="wikilink">is equal in distribution to</a>" (that is, "has the same distribution as"). Thus, we can go from the graphed density function of A to that of B by, roughly speaking, pushing some of the probability mass to the left.</p>
<p>For example, consider a single toss of a fair die with the six possible outcomes (states) summarized in this table along with the amount won in each state by each of three alternative gambles:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\text{State (die result)} \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 6$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\text{Gamble A wins}\  $  \quad 1 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 2 \quad 2 \quad 2$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\text{Gamble B wins}\ $  \quad 1 \quad 1 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 2 \quad 2$$</span></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\text{Gamble C wins}\ $  \quad 3 \quad 3 \quad 3 \quad 1 \quad 1 \quad 1$$</span></p>
<p>Here gamble A statewise dominates gamble B because A gives at least as good a yield in all possible states (outcomes of the die roll) and gives a strictly better yield in one of them (state 3). Since A statewise dominates B, it also first-order dominates B. Gamble C does not statewise dominate B because B gives a better yield in states 4 through 6, but C first-order stochastically dominates B because Pr(B ≥ 1) = Pr(C ≥ 1) = 1, Pr(B ≥ 2) = Pr(C ≥ 2) = 3/6, and Pr(B ≥ 3) = 0 while Pr(C ≥ 3) = 3/6 > Pr(B ≥ 3). Gambles A and C cannot be ordered relative to each other on the basis of first-order stochastic dominance because Pr(A ≥ 2) = 4/6 > Pr(C ≥ 2) = 3/6 while on the other hand Pr(C ≥ 3) = 3/6 > Pr(A ≥ 3) = 0.</p>
<p>In general, although when one gamble first-order stochastically dominates a second gamble, the expected value of the payoff under the first will be greater than the expected value of the payoff under the second, the converse is not true: one cannot order lotteries with regard to stochastic dominance simply by comparing the means of their probability distributions. For instance, in the above example C has a higher mean (2) than does A (5/3), yet C does not first-order dominate A.</p>
<h2 id="second-order-stochastic-dominance">Second-order stochastic dominance</h2>
<p>The other commonly used type of stochastic dominance is <strong>second-order stochastic dominance</strong>. Roughly speaking, for two gambles A and B, gamble A has second-order stochastic dominance over gamble B if the former is more predictable (i.e. involves less risk) and has at least as high a mean. All <a href="risk_aversion" title="wikilink">risk-averse</a> <a href="Expected_utility_hypothesis" title="wikilink">expected-utility maximizers</a> (that is, those with increasing and concave utility functions) prefer a second-order stochastically dominant gamble to a dominated one. Second-order dominance describes the shared preferences of a smaller class of decision-makers (those for whom more is better <em>and</em> who are averse to risk, rather than <em>all</em> those for whom more is better) than does first-order dominance.</p>
<p>In terms of cumulative distribution functions <span class="LaTeX">$F_A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$F_B$</span>, A is second-order stochastically dominant over B if and only if the area under <span class="LaTeX">$F_A$</span> from minus infinity to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is less than or equal to that under <span class="LaTeX">$F_B$</span> from minus infinity to <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> for all real numbers <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>, with strict inequality at some <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>; that is, <span class="LaTeX">$\int_{-\infty}^x [F_B(t) - F_A(t)]dt \geq 0$</span> for all <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>, with strict inequality at some <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span>. Equivalently, <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> dominates <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> in the second order if and only if <span class="LaTeX">$E[u(A)] \geq E[u(B)]$</span> for all nondecreasing and <a href="concave_function" title="wikilink">concave</a> utility functions <span class="LaTeX">$u(x)$</span>.</p>
<p>Second-order stochastic dominance can also be expressed as follows: Gamble A second-order stochastically dominates B if and only if there exist some gambles <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$z$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$x_B \overset {d}{=} (x_A + y + z)$</span>, with <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> always less than or equal to zero, and with <span class="LaTeX">$E(z|x_A+y)=0$</span> for all values of <span class="LaTeX">$x_A+y$</span>. Here the introduction of random variable <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> makes B first-order stochastically dominated by A (making B disliked by those with an increasing utility function), and the introduction of random variable <span class="LaTeX">$z$</span> introduces a <a href="mean-preserving_spread" title="wikilink">mean-preserving spread</a> in B which is disliked by those with concave utility. Note that if A and B have the same mean (so that the random variable <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> degenerates to the fixed number 0), then B is a mean-preserving spread of A.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="third-order-stochastic-dominance">Third-order stochastic dominance</h2>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$F_A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$F_B$</span> be the cumulative distribution functions of two distinct investments <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>. <span class="LaTeX">$A$</span> dominates <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span> in <strong>the third order</strong> if and only if</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$E_A(x) \geq E_B(x), \,$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>and there is at least one strict inequality.

<h2 id="higher-order-stochastic-dominance">Higher-order stochastic dominance</h2>
<p>Higher orders of stochastic dominance have also been analyzed, as have generalizations of the dual relationship between stochastic dominance orderings and classes of preference functions.</p>
<h2 id="stochastic-dominance-constraints">Stochastic dominance constraints</h2>
<p>Stochastic dominance relations may be used as constraints <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> in problems of <a href="mathematical_optimization" title="wikilink">mathematical optimization</a>, in particular <a href="stochastic_programming" title="wikilink">stochastic programming</a>. In a problem of maximizing a real functional <span class="LaTeX">$f(X)$</span> over random variables <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> in a set <span class="LaTeX">$X_0$</span> we may additionally require that <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> stochastically dominates a fixed random <em>benchmark</em> <span class="LaTeX">$B$</span>. In these problems, <a class="uri" href="utility" title="wikilink">utility</a> functions play the role of <a href="Lagrange_multiplier" title="wikilink">Lagrange multipliers</a> associated with stochastic dominance constraints. Under appropriate conditions, the solution of the problem is also a (possibly local) solution of the problem to maximize <span class="LaTeX">$f(X) + E[u(X) - u(B)]$</span> over <span class="LaTeX">$X$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$X_0$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$u(x)$</span> is a certain utility function. If the first order stochastic dominance constraint is employed, the utility function <span class="LaTeX">$u(x)$</span> is <a href="monotonic_function" title="wikilink">nondecreasing</a>; if the second order stochastic dominance constraint is used, <span class="LaTeX">$u(x)$</span> is <a href="monotonic_function" title="wikilink">nondecreasing</a> and <a href="concave_function" title="wikilink">concave</a>.</p>
