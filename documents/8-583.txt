Chebyshev function

[[Image:ChebyshevPsi.png|thumb|right|The Chebyshev function ψ(x), with x \vartheta(x)=\sum_{p\le x} \log p
with the sum extending over all prime numbers p that are less than or equal to x.
The second Chebyshev function ψ(x) is defined similarly, with the sum extending over all prime powers not exceeding x:



where 
 
 
 
  is the von Mangoldt function. The Chebyshev functions, especially the second one ψ(x), are often used in proofs related to prime numbers, because it is typically simpler to work with them than with the prime-counting function, π(x) (See the exact formula, below.) Both Chebyshev functions are asymptotic to x, a statement equivalent to the prime number theorem.
Both functions are named in honour of Pafnuty Chebyshev.
Relationships
The second Chebyshev function can be seen to be related to the first by writing it as



where k is the unique integer such that pk ≤ x and x k+1. The values k of are given in . A more direct relationship is given by



Note that this last sum has only a finite number of non-vanishing terms, as



The second Chebyshev function is the logarithm of the least common multiple of the integers from 1 to n.

Asymptotics and bounds
The following bounds are known for the Chebyshev functions: (in these formulas pk is the kth prime number p1 = 2, p2 = 3, etc.)

The exact formula
In 1895, Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt proved an explicit expression for 
 
 
 
  as a sum over the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function:



(The numerical value of ζ'(0)/ζ(0) is log(2π).) Here 
 
 
 
  runs over the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function, and ψ0 is the same as ψ, except that at its jump discontinuities (the prime powers) it takes the value halfway between the values to the left and the right:



From the Taylor series for the logarithm, the last term in the explicit formula can be understood as a summation of 
 
 
 
  over the trivial zeros of the zeta function, 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



Similarly, the first term, x = x1/1, corresponds to the simple pole of the zeta function at 1. Its being a pole rather than zero accounts for the opposite sign of the term.
Properties
A theorem due to Erhard Schmidt states that, for some explicit positive constant K, there are infinitely many natural numbers x such that



and infinitely many natural numbers x such that



In little-o notation, one may write the above as



Hardy and Littlewood prove the stronger result, that



Relation to primorials
The first Chebyshev function is the logarithm of the primorial of x, denoted x#:



This proves that the primorial x# is asymptotically equal to exp((1+o(1))x), where "o" is the little-o notation (see Big O notation) and together with the prime number theorem establishes the asymptotic behavior of pn#.
Relation to the prime-counting function
The Chebyshev function can be related to the prime-counting function as follows. Define



Then



The transition from 
 
 
 
  to the prime-counting function, 
 
 
 
 , is made through the equation



Certainly 
 
 
 
 , so for the sake of approximation, this last relation can be recast in the form



The Riemann hypothesis
The Riemann hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeros of the zeta function have real part 1/2. In this case, 
 
 
 
 , and it can be shown that



By the above, this implies



Good evidence that RH could be true comes from the fact proposed by Alain Connes and others, that if we differentiate the von Mangoldt formula with respect to x make x = exp(u). Manipulating, we have the "Trace formula" for the exponential of the Hamiltonian operator satisfying






where the "trigonometric sum" can be considered to be the trace of the operator (statistical mechanics) 
 
 
 
 ,which is only true if 
 
 

Using the semiclassical approach the potential of H = T + V satisfies:



with Z(u) → 0 as u → ∞.
solution to this nonlinear integral equation can be obtained (among others) by 
 
 
 
  in order to obtain the inverse of the potential
