   Hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)      Hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)   In enzymology , a hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 ATP + hydrogenobyrinic acid + 2 L-glutamine + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 ADP + 2 phosphate + hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide + 2 L-glutamate   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , hydrogenobyrinic acid , L-glutamine , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are ADP , phosphate , hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide , and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogenobyrinic-acid:L-glutamine amido-ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme is also called CobB . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 6.3.5  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
