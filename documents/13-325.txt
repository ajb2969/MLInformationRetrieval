Parity function

In Boolean algebra, a parity function is a Boolean function whose value is 1 if and only if the input vector has an odd number of ones. The parity function of two inputs is also known as the XOR function.
The parity function is notable for its role in theoretical investigation of circuit complexity of Boolean functions.
Definition
The 
 
 
 
 -variable parity function is the Boolean function

 
  with the property that 
 
 
if and only if the number of ones in the vector 
 
 
 
 
  is odd. In other words, 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows:


 
 .
Properties
Parity only depends on the number of ones and is therefore a symmetric Boolean function.
The n-variable parity function and its negation are the only Boolean functions for which all disjunctive normal forms have the maximal number of 2 n − 1 monomials of length n and all conjunctive normal forms have the maximal number of 2 n − 1 clauses of length n.1
Circuit complexity
In the early 1980s, Merrick Furst, James Saxe and Michael Sipser2 and independently Miklós Ajtai3 established super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of constant-depth Boolean circuits for the parity function, i.e., they showed that polynomial-size constant-depth circuits cannot compute the parity function. Similar results were also established for the majority, multiplication and transitive closure functions, by reduction from the parity function.4  established tight exponential lower bounds on the size of constant-depth Boolean circuits for the parity function. Håstad's Switching Lemma is the key technical tool used for these lower bounds and Johan Håstad was awarded the Gödel Prize for this work in 1994. The precise result is that depth-
 
 
 
  circuits with AND, OR, and NOT gates require size 
 
 
 
  to compute the parity function. This is asymptotically almost optimal as there are depth-
 
 
 
 
  circuits computing parity which have size 
 
 
 
 .
Infinite version
An infinite parity function is a function 
 
 
 
  mapping every infinite binary string to 0 or 1, having the following property: if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are infinite binary strings differing only on finite number of coordinates then 
 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  differ on even number of coordinates.
Assuming axiom of choice it can be easily proved that parity functions exist and there are 
 
 
 
  many of them - as many as the number of all functions from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 
 . It is enough to take one representative per equivalence class of relation 
 
 
 
  defined as follows
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  differ at finite number of coordinates. Having such representatives, we can map all of them to 0; the rest of 
 
 
 
 
  values are deducted unambiguously.
Infinite parity functions are often used in theoretical Computer Science and Set Theory because of their simple definition and - on the other hand - their descriptive complexity. For example, it can be shown that an inverse image 
 
 
 
  is a non-Borel set.
