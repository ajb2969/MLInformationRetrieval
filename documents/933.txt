   McConnell equation      McConnell equation   McConnell equation describes the proportional dependence of the hyperfine splitting constant    a   a   a   on the spin density   ρ   ρ   \rho   (the probability of an unpaired electron being on a particular atom) in aromatic radical compounds such as benzene  radical anion      C  6    H  6  -        subscript  C  6    superscript   subscript  H  6       C_{6}H_{6}^{-}   .      a  =   Q  ρ       a    Q  ρ     a=Q\rho      Q   Q   Q   is an empirical constant that can range from 2.0 to 2.5 mT.  History  The equation is named after Harden M. McConnell of Stanford University , who first presented it in 1956 in an article in the Journal of Chemical Physics . 1  References  Peter Atkins , Julio de Paula, Atkins' Physical Chemistry , 9th ed., Oxford University Press , Oxford, 14, 556  "  Category:Chemical physics     McConnell, H.
