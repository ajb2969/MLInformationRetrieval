Goodness factor

Goodness factor is a metric developed by Eric Laithwaite to determine the 'goodness' of an electric motor.12 Using it he was able to develop efficient magnetic levitation induction motors.3



where

G is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)
 
Am, Ae are the cross sections of the magnetic and electric circuit
 
lm, le are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits
 
μ is the permeability of the core
 
ω is the angular frequency the motor is driven at
 
σ is the conductivity of the conductor
 

From this he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to be relatively large. However, the equation only directly relates to non-permanent magnet motors.
Laithwaite showed that for a simple induction motor this gave:



where p is the pole pitch arc length, ρr is the surface resistivity of the rotor and g is the air gap.
