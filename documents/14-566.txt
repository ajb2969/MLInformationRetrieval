   Goodness factor      Goodness factor   Goodness factor is a metric developed by Eric Laithwaite to determine the 'goodness' of an electric motor . 1 2 Using it he was able to develop efficient magnetic levitation  induction motors . 3      G  =   ω   resistance  ×  reluctance    =    ω  μ  σ   A  m    A  e      l  m    l  e           G    ω    resistance  reluctance             ω  μ  σ   subscript  A  normal-m    subscript  A  normal-e       subscript  l  normal-m    subscript  l  normal-e        G=\frac{\omega}{\mathrm{resistance}\times\mathrm{reluctance}}=\frac{\omega\mu%
 \sigma A_{\mathrm{m}}A_{\mathrm{e}}}{l_{\mathrm{m}}l_{\mathrm{e}}}     where   G is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)  A m , A e are the cross sections of the magnetic and electric circuit  l m , l e are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits  μ is the permeability of the core  ω is the angular frequency the motor is driven at  σ is the conductivity of the conductor   From this he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to be relatively large. However, the equation only directly relates to non-permanent magnet motors.  Laithwaite showed that for a simple induction motor this gave:      G  ∝    ω   μ  0    p  2      ρ  r   g       proportional-to  G      ω   subscript  μ  0    superscript  p  2       subscript  ρ  normal-r   g      G\propto\frac{\omega\mu_{0}p^{2}}{\rho_{\mathrm{r}}g}     where p is the pole pitch arc length , ρ r is the surface resistivity of the rotor and g is the air gap.
