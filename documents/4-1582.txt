   Eilenberg–MacLane space      Eilenberg–MacLane space   In mathematics , and algebraic topology in particular, an Eilenberg–MacLane space 1 is a topological space with a single nontrivial homotopy group . As such, an Eilenberg-MacLane space is a special kind of topological space that can be regarded as a building block for homotopy theory . These spaces are important in many contexts in algebraic topology , including constructions of spaces, computations of homotopy groups of spheres, and definition of cohomology operations . The name is for Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane , who introduced such spaces in the late 1940s.  Let G be a group and n a positive integer. A connected topological space X is called an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type K ( G , n ), if it has n -th homotopy group π n ( X ) isomorphic to G and all other homotopy groups trivial. If n > 1 then G must be abelian. Such a space exists, is a CW-complex , and is unique up to a weak homotopy equivalence . By abuse of language, any such space is often called just K ( G , n ).  Examples   The unit circle  S 1 is a K ( Z ,1).  The infinite-dimensional complex projective space  P ∞ ( C ) is a model of K ( Z ,2). This is one of the rare examples of a K ( G , n ) admitting a manifold model for n >1. Its cohomology ring is Z [ x ], namely the free polynomial ring on a single 2-dimensional generator x ∈ H 2 . The generator can be represented in de Rham cohomology by the Fubini–Study  2-form . An application of K ( Z ,2) is described at Abstract nonsense .  The infinite-dimensional real projective space  P ∞ ( R ) is a K ( Z 2 , 1).  The wedge sum of k  unit circles      ⋁   i  =  1   k    𝐒  1       superscript   subscript     i  1    k    superscript  𝐒  1     \textstyle\bigvee_{i=1}^{k}\mathbf{S}^{1}   is a K ( G , 1 ) for G the free group on k generators.  The complement to any knot in a 3-dimensional sphere S 3 is of type K ( G , 1); this is called the " asphericity of knots", and is a 1957 theorem of Christos Papakyriakopoulos . 2   Some further elementary examples can be constructed from these by using the fact that the product K ( G , n ) × K ( H , n ) is K ( G × H , n ).  A K ( G , n ) can be constructed stage-by-stage, as a CW complex , starting with a wedge of n - spheres , one for each generator of the group G , and adding cells in (possibly infinite number of) higher dimensions so as to kill all extra homotopy.  Properties of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces  An important property of K ( G , n ) is that, for any abelian group G , and any CW-complex X , the set   [ X , K ( G , n )]   of homotopy classes of maps from X to K ( G , n ) is in natural bijection with the n -th singular cohomology group   H n ( X ; G )   of the space X . Thus one says that the K ( G , n ) are representing spaces for cohomology with coefficients in G . Since         H  n    (   K   (  G  ,  n  )    ;  G  )    =   Hom   (    H  n    (   K   (  G  ,  n  )    ;  𝐙  )    ,  G  )    =   Hom   (    π  n    (   K   (  G  ,  n  )    )    ,  G  )    =   Hom   (  G  ,  G  )     ,           superscript  H  n      K   G  n    G      Hom      subscript  H  n      K   G  n    𝐙    G           Hom      subscript  π  n     K   G  n     G           Hom   G  G       H^{n}(K(G,n);G)=\mathrm{Hom}(H_{n}(K(G,n);\mathbf{Z}),G)=\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_{n}(%
 K(G,n)),G)=\mathrm{Hom}(G,G),     there is a distinguished element    u  ∈    H  n    (   K   (  G  ,  n  )    ;  G  )        u     superscript  H  n      K   G  n    G      u\in H^{n}(K(G,n);G)   corresponding to the identity. The above bijection is given by pullback of that element —    f  ↦    f  *   u      maps-to  f     superscript  f    u     f\mapsto f^{*}u   .  Another version of this result, due to Peter J. Huber, establishes a bijection with the n -th Čech cohomology group when X is Hausdorff and paracompact and G is countable, or when X is Hausdorff, paracompact and compactly generated and G is arbitrary. A further result of Morita establishes a bijection with the n -th numerable Čech cohomology group for an arbitrary topological space X and G an arbitrary abelian group.  It follows from the universal coefficient theorem for cohomology that the Eilenberg MacLane space is a quasi-functor of the group; that is, for each positive integer   n   n   n   if    a  :   G  →   G  ′       normal-:  a   normal-→  G   superscript  G  normal-′      a:G\to G^{\prime}   is any homomorphism of Abelian groups, then there is a non-empty set        K   (  a  ,  n  )    =   {   [  f  ]   :   f  :     K   (  G  ,  n  )    →   K   (   G  ′   ,  n  )     ,     H  n    (  f  )    =  a     }    ,        K   a  n     conditional-set   delimited-[]  f    normal-:  f   formulae-sequence   normal-→    K   G  n      K    superscript  G  normal-′   n          subscript  H  n   f   a        K(a,n)=\{[f]:f:K(G,n)\to K(G^{\prime},n),H_{n}(f)=a\},     satisfying      K   (   a  ∘  b   ,  n  )    ⊃     K   (  a  ,  n  )    ∘  K    (  b  ,  n  )   and  1   ∈   K   (  1  ,  n  )     ,       superset-of    K     a  b   n          K   a  n    K    b  n   and  1          K   1  n       K(a\circ b,n)\supset K(a,n)\circ K(b,n)\mbox{ and }1\in K(1,n),   where    [  f  ]     delimited-[]  f    [f]   denotes the homotopy class of a continuous map   f   f   f   and      S  ∘  T   :=   {   s  ∘  t   :    s  ∈  S   ,   t  ∈  T    }    .     assign    S  T    conditional-set    s  t    formulae-sequence    s  S     t  T       S\circ T:=\{s\circ t:s\in S,t\in T\}.     Every CW-complex possesses a Postnikov tower , that is, it is homotopy equivalent to an iterated fibration with fibers the Eilenberg–MacLane spaces.  There is a method due to Jean-Pierre Serre which allows one, at least theoretically, to compute homotopy groups of spaces using a spectral sequence for special fibrations with Eilenberg–MacLane spaces for fibers.  The cohomology groups of Eilenberg–MacLane spaces can be used to classify all cohomology operations .
