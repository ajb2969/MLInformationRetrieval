   115 (number)      115 (number)   115 (one hundred [and] fifteen) is the natural number following 114 and preceding 116 .  In mathematics  115 has a square  sum of divisors :        σ   (  115  )    =   1  +  5  +  23  +  115   =  144  =   12  2    .          σ  115     1  5  23  115        144        superscript  12  2      \sigma(115)=1+5+23+115=144=12^{2}.   It is unknown whether the set of numbers with this property is infinite, but this would follow from the truth of the Bunyakovsky conjecture on polynomials with infinitely many prime values. 1  There are 115 different rooted trees with exactly eight nodes, 2 115 inequivalent ways of placing six rooks on a 6 × 6 chess board in such a way that no two of the rooks attack each other, 3 and 115 solutions to the stamp folding problem for a strip of seven stamps. 4  115 is also a heptagonal pyramidal number . 5 The 115th Woodall number ,         115  ⋅   2  115    -  1   =  4 776 913 109 852 041 418 248 056 622 882 488 319   ,         normal-⋅  115   superscript  2  115    1   4 776 913 109 852 041 418 248 056 622 882 488 319    115\cdot 2^{115}-1=4\;776\;913\;109\;852\;041\;418\;248\;056\;622\;882\;488\;3%
