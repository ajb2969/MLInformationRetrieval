   Linear production game      Linear production game   Linear Production Game ( LP Game ) is a N-person game in which the value of a coalition can be obtained by solving a Linear Programming problem. It is widely used in the context of resource allocation and payoff distribution. Mathematically, there are m types of resources and n products can be produced out of them. Product j requires    a  k  j     subscript   superscript  a  j   k    a^{j}_{k}   amount of the kth resource. The products can be sold at a given market price    c  →     normal-→  c    \vec{c}   while the resources themselves can not. Each of the N players is given a vector      b  i   →   =   (   b  1  i   ,  …  ,   b  m  i   )        normal-→   superscript  b  i      subscript   superscript  b  i   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  b  i   m      \vec{b^{i}}=(b^{i}_{1},...,b^{i}_{m})   of resources. The value of a coalition  S is the maximum profit it can achieve with all the resources possessed by its members. It can be obtained by solving a corresponding Linear Programming problem    P   (  S  )       P  S    P(S)   as follows.           v   (  S  )    =    max   x  ≥  0     (     c  1    x  1    +  …  +    c  n    x  n     )          v  S     subscript     x  0         subscript  c  1    subscript  x  1    normal-…     subscript  c  n    subscript  x  n        v(S)=\max_{x\geq 0}(c_{1}x_{1}+...+c_{n}x_{n})       s  .  t  .   a  j  1    x  1   +   a  j  2    x  2   +  …  +   a  j  n    x  n   ≤   ∑   i  ∈  S     b  j  i   ∀  j  =  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  m     fragments  s  normal-.  t  normal-.    subscript   superscript  a  1   j    subscript  x  1     subscript   superscript  a  2   j    subscript  x  2    normal-…    subscript   superscript  a  n   j    subscript  x  n     subscript     i  S     subscript   superscript  b  i   j    for-all  j   1  normal-,  2  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  m    s.t.\quad a^{1}_{j}x_{1}+a^{2}_{j}x_{2}+...+a^{n}_{j}x_{n}\leq\sum_{i\in S}b^{%
 i}_{j}\quad\forall j=1,2,...,m        The core of the LP game  Every LP game v is a totally balanced game . So every subgame of v has a non-empty core . One imputation can be computed by solving the dual problem of    P   (  N  )       P  N    P(N)   . Let   α   α   \alpha   be the optimal dual solution of    P   (  N  )       P  N    P(N)   . The payoff to player'' i'' is     x  i   =    ∑   k  =  1   m     α  k    b  k  i          superscript  x  i     superscript   subscript     k  1    m      subscript  α  k    subscript   superscript  b  i   k       x^{i}=\sum_{k=1}^{m}\alpha_{k}b^{i}_{k}   . It can be proved by the duality theorems that    x  →     normal-→  x    \vec{x}   is in the core of v .  An important interpretation of the imputation    x  →     normal-→  x    \vec{x}   is that under the current market, the value of each resource j is exactly    α  j     subscript  α  j    \alpha_{j}   , although it is not valued in themselves. So the payoff one player i should receive is the total value of the resources he possesses.  However, not all the imputations in the core can be obtained from the optimal dual solutions. There are a lot of discussions on this problem. One of the mostly widely used method is to consider the r-fold replication of the original problem. It can be shown that if an imputation u is in the core of the r-fold replicated game for all r, then u can be obtained from the optimal dual solution.  References     "  Category:Game theory
