   Zeeman effect      Zeeman effect   The Zeeman effect (; ), named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman , is the effect of splitting a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field . It is analogous to the Stark effect , the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field . Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules .  Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of the magnetic field, this effect can be used to measure the magnetic field, e.g. that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas . The Zeeman effect is very important in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Mössbauer spectroscopy . It may also be utilized to improve accuracy in atomic absorption spectroscopy . A theory about the magnetic sense of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect. 1  When the spectral lines are absorption lines, the effect is called inverse Zeeman effect .

(for Rb-87, I = 3/2)   Nomenclature  Historically, one distinguishes between the normal and an anomalous Zeeman effect that appears on transitions where the net spin of the electrons is not 0, the number of Zeeman sub-levels being even instead of odd if there is an uneven number of electrons involved. It was called "anomalous" because the electron spin had not yet been discovered, and so there was no good explanation for it at the time that Zeeman observed the effect.  At higher magnetic fields the effect ceases to be linear. At even higher field strength, when the strength of the external field is comparable to the strength of the atom's internal field, electron coupling is disturbed and the spectral lines rearrange. This is called the Paschen-Back effect .  In the modern scientific literature, these terms are rarely used, with a tendency to use just the "Zeeman effect".  Theoretical presentation  The total Hamiltonian of an atom in a magnetic field is       H  =    H  0   +   V  M     ,      H     subscript  H  0    subscript  V  M      H=H_{0}+V_{M},     where    H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   is the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the atom, and    V  M     subscript  V  M    V_{M}   is perturbation due to the magnetic field:        V  M   =   -    μ  →   ⋅   B  →      ,       subscript  V  M      normal-⋅   normal-→  μ    normal-→  B       V_{M}=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B},     where    μ  →     normal-→  μ    \vec{\mu}   is the magnetic moment of the atom. The magnetic moment consists of the electronic and nuclear parts; however, the latter is many orders of magnitude smaller and will be neglected here. Therefore,        μ  →   ≈   -     μ  B   g   J  →    ℏ     ,       normal-→  μ          subscript  μ  B   g   normal-→  J    Planck-constant-over-2-pi      \vec{\mu}\approx-\frac{\mu_{B}g\vec{J}}{\hbar},     where    μ  B     subscript  μ  B    \mu_{B}   is the Bohr magneton ,    J  →     normal-→  J    \vec{J}   is the total electronic angular momentum , and   g   g   g   is the Landé g-factor . A more accurate approach is to take into account that the operator of the magnetic moment of an electron is a sum of the contributions of the orbital angular momentum     L  →     normal-→  L    \vec{L}   and the spin angular momentum     S  →     normal-→  S    \vec{S}   , with each multiplied by the appropriate gyromagnetic ratio :        μ  →   =   -     μ  B    (     g  l    L  →    +    g  s    S  →     )    ℏ     ,       normal-→  μ          subscript  μ  B        subscript  g  l    normal-→  L       subscript  g  s    normal-→  S      Planck-constant-over-2-pi      \vec{\mu}=-\frac{\mu_{B}(g_{l}\vec{L}+g_{s}\vec{S})}{\hbar},     where     g  l   =  1       subscript  g  l   1    g_{l}=1   and     g  s   ≈  2.0023192       subscript  g  s   2.0023192    g_{s}\approx 2.0023192   (the latter is called the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio ; the deviation of the value from 2 is due to the effects of quantum electrodynamics ). In the case of the LS coupling , one can sum over all electrons in the atom:        g   J  →    =   ⟨    ∑  i    (     g  l     l  i   →    +    g  s     s  i   →     )    ⟩   =   ⟨   (     g  l    L  →    +    g  s    S  →     )   ⟩    ,          g   normal-→  J     delimited-⟨⟩    subscript   i        subscript  g  l    normal-→   subscript  l  i        subscript  g  s    normal-→   subscript  s  i              delimited-⟨⟩       subscript  g  l    normal-→  L       subscript  g  s    normal-→  S         g\vec{J}=\left\langle\sum_{i}(g_{l}\vec{l_{i}}+g_{s}\vec{s_{i}})\right\rangle=%
 \left\langle(g_{l}\vec{L}+g_{s}\vec{S})\right\rangle,     where    L  →     normal-→  L    \vec{L}   and    S  →     normal-→  S    \vec{S}   are the total orbital momentum and spin of the atom, and averaging is done over a state with a given value of the total angular momentum.  If the interaction term    V  M     subscript  V  M    V_{M}   is small (less than the fine structure ), it can be treated as a perturbation; this is the Zeeman effect proper. In the Paschen-Back effect, described below,    V  M     subscript  V  M    V_{M}   exceeds the LS coupling significantly (but is still small compared to    H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   ). In ultrastrong magnetic fields, the magnetic-field interaction may exceed    H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   , in which case the atom can no longer exist in its normal meaning, and one talks about Landau levels instead. There are, of course, intermediate cases which are more complex than these limit cases.  Weak field (Zeeman effect)  If the spin-orbit interaction dominates over the effect of the external magnetic field,    L  →     normal-→  L    \scriptstyle\vec{L}   and    S  →     normal-→  S    \scriptstyle\vec{S}   are not separately conserved, only the total angular momentum     J  →   =    L  →   +   S  →         normal-→  J      normal-→  L    normal-→  S      \scriptstyle\vec{J}=\vec{L}+\vec{S}   is. The spin and orbital angular momentum vectors can be thought of as precessing about the (fixed) total angular momentum vector    J  →     normal-→  J    \scriptstyle\vec{J}   . The (time-)"averaged" spin vector is then the projection of the spin onto the direction of    J  →     normal-→  J    \scriptstyle\vec{J}   :        S  →    a  v  g    =     (    S  →   ⋅   J  →    )    J  2     J  →         subscript   normal-→  S     a  v  g         normal-⋅   normal-→  S    normal-→  J     superscript  J  2     normal-→  J      \vec{S}_{avg}=\frac{(\vec{S}\cdot\vec{J})}{J^{2}}\vec{J}     and for the (time-)"averaged" orbital vector:         L  →    a  v  g    =     (    L  →   ⋅   J  →    )    J  2     J  →     .       subscript   normal-→  L     a  v  g         normal-⋅   normal-→  L    normal-→  J     superscript  J  2     normal-→  J      \vec{L}_{avg}=\frac{(\vec{L}\cdot\vec{J})}{J^{2}}\vec{J}.     Thus,        ⟨   V  M   ⟩   =      μ  B   ℏ    J  →    (     g  L      L  →   ⋅   J  →     J  2     +    g  S      S  →   ⋅   J  →     J  2      )    ⋅   B  →     .       delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  V  M     normal-⋅       subscript  μ  B   Planck-constant-over-2-pi    normal-→  J        subscript  g  L      normal-⋅   normal-→  L    normal-→  J     superscript  J  2        subscript  g  S      normal-⋅   normal-→  S    normal-→  J     superscript  J  2        normal-→  B      \langle V_{M}\rangle=\frac{\mu_{B}}{\hbar}\vec{J}\left(g_{L}\frac{\vec{L}\cdot%

Using     L  →   =    J  →   -   S  →         normal-→  L      normal-→  J    normal-→  S      \scriptstyle\vec{L}=\vec{J}-\vec{S}   and squaring both sides, we get         S  →   ⋅   J  →    =    1  2    (     J  2   +   S  2    -   L  2    )    =     ℏ  2   2    [     j   (   j  +  1   )    -   l   (   l  +  1   )     +   s   (   s  +  1   )     ]     ,         normal-⋅   normal-→  S    normal-→  J        1  2        superscript  J  2    superscript  S  2     superscript  L  2               superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2   2    delimited-[]        j    j  1      l    l  1       s    s  1          \vec{S}\cdot\vec{J}=\frac{1}{2}(J^{2}+S^{2}-L^{2})=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}[j(j+1)-%

 l(l+1)-s(s+1)].     Combining everything and taking     J  z   =   ℏ   m  j         subscript  J  z     Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  m  j      \scriptstyle J_{z}=\hbar m_{j}   , we obtain the magnetic potential energy of the atom in the applied external magnetic field,      V  M     subscript  V  M    \displaystyle V_{M}     where the quantity in square brackets is the Landé g-factor g J of the atom (     g  L   =  1       subscript  g  L   1    g_{L}=1   and     g  S   ≈  2       subscript  g  S   2    g_{S}\approx 2   ) and    m  j     subscript  m  j    m_{j}   is the z-component of the total angular momentum. For a single electron above filled shells    s  =   1  /  2       s    1  2     s=1/2   and    j  =   l  ±  s       j   plus-or-minus  l  s     j=l\pm s   , the Landé g-factor can be simplified into:       g  j   =   1  ±     g  S   -  1     2  l   +  1          subscript  g  j    plus-or-minus  1       subscript  g  S   1       2  l   1       g_{j}=1\pm\frac{g_{S}-1}{2l+1}     Example: Lyman alpha transition in hydrogen  The Lyman alpha transition in hydrogen in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction involves the transitions       2   P   1  /  2     →   1   S   1  /  2        normal-→    2   subscript  P    1  2       1   subscript  S    1  2       2P_{1/2}\to 1S_{1/2}   and      2   P   3  /  2     →   1   S   1  /  2      .     normal-→    2   subscript  P    3  2       1   subscript  S    1  2       2P_{3/2}\to 1S_{1/2}.     In the presence of an external magnetic field, the weak-field Zeeman effect splits the 1S 1/2 and 2P 1/2 levels into 2 states each (     m  j   =    1  /  2   ,   -   1  /  2          subscript  m  j      1  2       1  2       m_{j}=1/2,-1/2   ) and the 2P 3/2 level into 4 states (     m  j   =    3  /  2   ,   1  /  2   ,   -   1  /  2    ,   -   3  /  2          subscript  m  j      3  2     1  2       1  2        3  2       m_{j}=3/2,1/2,-1/2,-3/2   ). The Landé g-factors for the three levels are:       g  J   =  2       subscript  g  J   2    g_{J}=2   for    1   S   1  /  2        1   subscript  S    1  2      1S_{1/2}   (j=1/2, l=0)       g  J   =   2  /  3        subscript  g  J     2  3     g_{J}=2/3   for    2   P   1  /  2        2   subscript  P    1  2      2P_{1/2}   (j=1/2, l=1)       g  J   =   4  /  3        subscript  g  J     4  3     g_{J}=4/3   for    2   P   3  /  2        2   subscript  P    3  2      2P_{3/2}   (j=3/2, l=1).  Note in particular that the size of the energy splitting is different for the different orbitals, because the g J values are different. On the left, fine structure splitting is depicted. This splitting occurs even in the absence of a magnetic field, as it is due to spin-orbit coupling. Depicted on the right is the additional Zeeman splitting, which occurs in the presence of magnetic fields.  (Figure)  400 px   Strong field (Paschen-Back effect)  The Paschen-Back effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This occurs when an external magnetic field is sufficiently large to disrupt the coupling between orbital (    L  →     normal-→  L    \vec{L}   ) and spin (    S  →     normal-→  S    \vec{S}   ) angular momenta. This effect is the strong-field limit of the Zeeman effect. When    s  =  0      s  0    s=0   , the two effects are equivalent. The effect was named after the German  physicists  Friedrich Paschen and Ernst E. A. Back . 2  When the magnetic-field perturbation significantly exceeds the spin-orbit interaction, one can safely assume     [   H  0   ,  S  ]   =  0        subscript  H  0   S   0    [H_{0},S]=0   . This allows the expectation values of    L  z     subscript  L  z    L_{z}   and    S  z     subscript  S  z    S_{z}   to be easily evaluated for a state    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   . The energies are simply        E  z   =   ⟨  ψ  |    H  0   +      B  z    μ  B    ℏ    (    L  z   +    g  s    S  z     )     |  ψ  ⟩   =    E  0   +    B  z    μ  B    (    m  l   +    g  s    m  s     )      .         subscript  E  z    quantum-operator-product  ψ     subscript  H  0          subscript  B  z    subscript  μ  B    Planck-constant-over-2-pi      subscript  L  z      subscript  g  s    subscript  S  z       ψ           subscript  E  0      subscript  B  z    subscript  μ  B      subscript  m  l      subscript  g  s    subscript  m  s          E_{z}=\left\langle\psi\left|H_{0}+\frac{B_{z}\mu_{B}}{\hbar}(L_{z}+g_{s}S_{z})%
 \right|\psi\right\rangle=E_{0}+B_{z}\mu_{B}(m_{l}+g_{s}m_{s}).     The above may be read as implying that the LS-coupling is completely broken by the external field. However    m  l     subscript  m  l    m_{l}   and    m  s     subscript  m  s    m_{s}   are still "good" quantum numbers. Together with the selection rules for an electric dipole transition , i.e.,      Δ  s   =  0   ,     Δ   m  s    =  0   ,     Δ  l   =   ±  1    ,    Δ   m  l    =   0  ,   ±  1          formulae-sequence      normal-Δ  s   0    formulae-sequence      normal-Δ   subscript  m  s    0    formulae-sequence      normal-Δ  l    plus-or-minus  1        normal-Δ   subscript  m  l     0   plus-or-minus  1         \Delta s=0,\Delta m_{s}=0,\Delta l=\pm 1,\Delta m_{l}=0,\pm 1   this allows to ignore the spin degree of freedom altogether. As a result, only three spectral lines will be visible, corresponding to the     Δ   m  l    =   0  ,   ±  1          normal-Δ   subscript  m  l     0   plus-or-minus  1      \Delta m_{l}=0,\pm 1   selection rule.

It should be noted that in general (if    s  ≠  0      s  0    s\neq 0   ), these three components are actually groups of several transitions each, due to the residual spin-orbit coupling.  In general, one must now add spin-orbit coupling and relativistic corrections (which are of the same order, known as 'fine structure') as a perturbation to these 'unperturbed' levels. First order perturbation theory with these fine-structure corrections yields the following formula for the Hydrogen atom in the Paschen–Back limit: 3        E   z  +   f  s     =    E  z   +     α  2    2   n  3      {    3   4  n    -   [     l   (   l  +  1   )    -    m  l    m  s      l   (   l  +   1  /  2    )    (   l  +  1   )     ]    }      .       subscript  E    z    f  s        subscript  E  z        superscript  α  2     2   superscript  n  3          3    4  n     delimited-[]        l    l  1       subscript  m  l    subscript  m  s       l    l    1  2      l  1            E_{z+fs}=E_{z}+\frac{\alpha^{2}}{2n^{3}}\left\{\frac{3}{4n}-\left[\frac{l(l+1)%

 )}{2F(F+1)}     As discussed, in the case of weak magnetic fields, the Zeeman interaction can be treated as a perturbation to the    |   F  ,   m  f    ⟩     ket   F   subscript  m  f      |F,m_{f}\rangle   basis. In the high field regime, the magnetic field becomes so large that the Zeeman effect will dominate, and we must use a more complete basis of    |   I  ,  J  ,   m  I   ,   m  J    ⟩     ket   I  J   subscript  m  I    subscript  m  J      |I,J,m_{I},m_{J}\rangle   or just    |    m  I   ,   m  J    ⟩     ket    subscript  m  I    subscript  m  J      |m_{I},m_{J}\rangle   since   I   I   I   and   J   J   J   will be constant within a given level.  To get the complete picture, including intermediate field strengths, we must consider eigenstates which are superpositions of the    |   F  ,   m  F    ⟩     ket   F   subscript  m  F      |F,m_{F}\rangle   and    |    m  I   ,   m  J    ⟩     ket    subscript  m  I    subscript  m  J      |m_{I},m_{J}\rangle   basis states. For    J  =   1  /  2       J    1  2     J=1/2   , the Hamiltonian can be solved analytically, resulting in the Breit-Rabi formula. Notably, the electric quadrapole interaction is zero for    L  =  0      L  0    L=0   (    J  =   1  /  2       J    1  2     J=1/2   ), so this formula is fairly accurate.  To solve this system, we note that at all times, the total angular momentum projection     m  F   =    m  J   +   m  I         subscript  m  F      subscript  m  J    subscript  m  I      m_{F}=m_{J}+m_{I}   will be conserved. Furthermore, since    J  =   1  /  2       J    1  2     J=1/2   between states    m  J     subscript  m  J    m_{J}   will change between only    ±   1  /  2      plus-or-minus    1  2     \pm 1/2   . Therefore, we can define a good basis as:       |  ±  ⟩   ≡   |     m  J   =   ±   1  /  2     ,    m  I   =    m  F   ∓   1  /  2      ⟩        ket  plus-or-minus    ket   formulae-sequence     subscript  m  J    plus-or-minus    1  2        subscript  m  I    minus-or-plus   subscript  m  F     1  2         |\pm\rangle\equiv|m_{J}=\pm 1/2,m_{I}=m_{F}\mp 1/2\rangle     We now utilize quantum mechanical ladder operators , which are defined for a general angular momentum operator   L   L   L   as       L  ±   ≡    L  x   ±   i   L  y          subscript  L  plus-or-minus    plus-or-minus   subscript  L  x     i   subscript  L  y       L_{\pm}\equiv L_{x}\pm iL_{y}     These ladder operators have the property        L  ±    |    L  ,    m  L    ⟩    =      (   L  ∓   m  L    )    (    L  ±   m  L    +  1   )      |   L  ,    m  L   ±  1    ⟩           subscript  L  plus-or-minus    ket     subscript  L  normal-,    subscript  m  L             minus-or-plus  L   subscript  m  L       plus-or-minus  L   subscript  m  L    1      ket   L   plus-or-minus   subscript  m  L   1        L_{\pm}|L_{,}m_{L}\rangle=\sqrt{(L\mp m_{L})(L\pm m_{L}+1)}|L,m_{L}\pm 1\rangle     as long as    m  L     subscript  m  L    m_{L}   lies in the range     -  L   ,   …  …   ,  L       L     normal-…  normal-…   L    {-L,\dots...,L}   (otherwise, they return zero). Using ladder operators    J  ±     subscript  J  plus-or-minus    J_{\pm}   and    I  ±     subscript  I  plus-or-minus    I_{\pm}   We can rewrite the Hamiltonian as      H  =    h  A   I  z    J  z    +     h  A   2    (     J  +    I  -    +    J  -    I  +     )    +    μ  B   B   (     g  J    J  z    +    g  I    I  Z     )         H      h  A   subscript  I  z    subscript  J  z          h  A   2        subscript  J     subscript  I        subscript  J     subscript  I          subscript  μ  B   B       subscript  g  J    subscript  J  z       subscript  g  I    subscript  I  Z         H=hAI_{z}J_{z}+\frac{hA}{2}(J_{+}I_{-}+J_{-}I_{+})+\mu_{B}B(g_{J}J_{z}+g_{I}I_%

Applications  Astrophysics  (Figure)  Zeeman effect on a sunspot spectral line   George Ellery Hale was the first to notice the Zeeman effect in the solar spectra, indicating the existence of strong magnetic fields in sunspots. Such fields can be quite high, on the order of 0.1 tesla or higher. Today, the Zeeman effect is used to produce magnetograms showing the variation of magnetic field on the sun.  Laser cooling  The Zeeman effect is utilized in many laser cooling applications such as a magneto-optical trap and the Zeeman slower .
