Molar solubility

Molar solubility is the number of moles of a substance (the solute) that can be dissolved per liter of solution before the solution becomes saturated. It can be calculated from a substance's solubility product constant (Ksp) and stoichiometry. The units are mol/L, sometimes written as M.
Derivation
Given excess of a simple salt AxBy in an aqueous solution of no common ions (A or B already present in the solution), the amount of it which enters solution can be calculated as follows:
The Chemical equation for this salt would be:


 where A, B are ions and x, y are coefficients...

 1. The relationship of the changes in amount (of which mole is a unit), represented as N(∆), between the species is given by Stoichiometry as follows:


 which, when rearranged for ∆A and ∆B yields:




2. The Deltas(∆), Initials(i) and Finals(f) relate very simply since, in this case, Molar solubility is defined assuming no common ions are already present in the solution.

3. In these variables (with V for volume), the Molar solubility would be written as:



 4. The Solubility Product expression is defined as:


These four sets of equations are enough to solve for S0 algebraically:











Hence;



Simple calculation
If the solubility product constant (Ksp) and dissociation product ions are known, the molar solubility can be computed without the aforementioned equation.
Example
Ionic substance AB2 dissociates into A and 2B, or one mole of ion A and two moles of ion B. The soluble ion dissociation equation can thus be written as:



where the corresponding solubility product equation is:



If the initial concentration of A is x, then that of B must be 2x. Inserting these initial concentrations into the solubility product equation gives:







If Ksp is known, x can be computed, which is the molar solubility.
