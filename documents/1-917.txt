   Rational root theorem      Rational root theorem   See also: Eisenstein criterion  In algebra , the rational root theorem (or rational root test , rational zero theorem or rational zero test ) states a constraint on rational solutions (or roots ) of a polynomial equation         a  n    x  n    +    a   n  -  1     x   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  0    =  0           subscript  a  n    superscript  x  n       subscript  a    n  1     superscript  x    n  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  0    0    a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0}=0\,\!   with integer coefficients.  If a 0 and a n are nonzero, then each rational solution x , when written as a fraction x = p / q in lowest terms (i.e., the greatest common divisor of p and q is 1), satisfies   p is an integer factor of the constant term  a 0 , and  q is an integer factor of the leading coefficient  a n .   The rational root theorem is a special case (for a single linear factor) of Gauss's lemma on the factorization of polynomials. The integral root theorem is a special case of the rational root theorem if the leading coefficient a n = 1.  Proofs  A proof  Let P ( x ) = a n x n + a n −1 x n −1 + ... + a 1 x + a 0 for some a 0 , ..., a n ∈ Z , and suppose P ( p / q ) = 0 for some coprime  p , q ∈ Z :       P   (    p  q    )    =     a  n     (    p  q    )   n    +    a   n  -  1      (    p  q    )    n  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a  1    (    p  q    )    +   a  0    =  0.          P    p  q         subscript  a  n    superscript    p  q   n       subscript  a    n  1     superscript    p  q     n  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a  1     p  q     subscript  a  0         0.     P\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right)=a_{n}\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right)^{n}+a_{n-1}\left(%
 \tfrac{p}{q}\right)^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1}\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right)+a_{0}=0.     If we multiply both sides by q n , shift the constant term to the right hand side, and factor out p on the left hand side, we get         p    (     a  n    p   n  -  1     +    a   n  -  1    q   p   n  -  2     +  ⋯  +    a  1    q   n  -  1      )    =   -    a  0    q  n      .        p       subscript  a  n    superscript  p    n  1        subscript  a    n  1    q   superscript  p    n  2     normal-⋯     subscript  a  1    superscript  q    n  1            subscript  a  0    superscript  q  n       \qquad p(a_{n}p^{n-1}+a_{n-1}qp^{n-2}+\cdots+a_{1}q^{n-1})=-a_{0}q^{n}.     We see that p times the integer quantity in parentheses equals − a 0 q n , so p divides a 0 q n . But p is coprime to q and therefore to q n , so by (the generalized form of) Euclid's lemma it must divide the remaining factor a 0 of the product.  If we instead shift the leading term to the right hand side and factor out q on the left hand side, we get         q    (     a   n  -  1     p   n  -  1     +    a   n  -  2    q   p   n  -  2     +  ⋯  +    a  0    q   n  -  1      )    =   -    a  n    p  n      .        q       subscript  a    n  1     superscript  p    n  1        subscript  a    n  2    q   superscript  p    n  2     normal-⋯     subscript  a  0    superscript  q    n  1            subscript  a  n    superscript  p  n       \qquad q(a_{n-1}p^{n-1}+a_{n-2}qp^{n-2}+\cdots+a_{0}q^{n-1})=-a_{n}p^{n}.     And for similar reasons, we can conclude that q divides a n . 1  Proof using Gauss's lemma  Should there be a nontrivial factor dividing all the coefficients of the polynomial, then one can divide by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients so as to obtain a primitive polynomial in the sense of Gauss's lemma ; this does not alter the set of rational roots and only strengthens the divisibility conditions. That lemma says that if the polynomial factors in    ℚ  X  X      normal-ℚ  X  X    ℚXX   , then it also factors in    ℤ  X  X      normal-ℤ  X  X    ℤXX   as a product of primitive polynomials. Now any rational root    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   corresponds to a factor of degree 1 in    ℚ  X  X      normal-ℚ  X  X    ℚXX   of the polynomial, and its primitive representative is then    q  x  −  p      q  x  normal-−  p    qx−p   , assuming that p and q are coprime. But any multiple in    ℤ  X  X      normal-ℤ  X  X    ℤXX   of    q  x  −  p      q  x  normal-−  p    qx−p   has leading term divisible by q and constant term divisible by p , which proves the statement. This argument shows that more generally, any irreducible factor of P can be supposed to have integer coefficients, and leading and constant coefficients dividing the corresponding coefficients of P .  Example  For example, every rational solution of the equation          3   x  3    -   5   x  2     +   5  x    -  2   =  0              3   superscript  x  3      5   superscript  x  2       5  x    2   0    3x^{3}-5x^{2}+5x-2=0\,\!   must be among the numbers symbolically indicated by   ±       1  ,  2    1  ,  3    ,        1  2    1  3     \tfrac{1,2}{1,3}\,,      which gives the list of 8 possible answers:       1  ,   -  1   ,  2  ,   -  2   ,   1  3   ,   -   1  3    ,   2  3   ,   -    2  3      .     1    1   2    2     1  3       1  3      2  3       2  3      1,-1,2,-2,\frac{1}{3},-\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},-\frac{2}{3}\,.     These root candidates can be tested using the Horner's method (for instance). In this particular case there is exactly one rational root. If a root candidate does not satisfy the equation, it can be used to shorten the list of remaining candidates. 2 For example, x = 1 does not satisfy the equation as the left hand side equals 1. This means that substituting x = 1 + t yields a polynomial in t with constant term 1, while the coefficient of t 3 remains the same as the coefficient of x 3 . Applying the rational root theorem thus yields the following possible roots for t :      t  =   ±    1   1  ,  3          t   plus-or-minus    1   1  3       t=\pm\tfrac{1}{1,3}   Therefore,       x  =   1  +  t   =  2   ,   0  ,   4  3   ,   2  3       formulae-sequence      x    1  t        2     0    4  3     2  3      x=1+t=2,0,\frac{4}{3},\frac{2}{3}   Root candidates that do not occur on both lists are ruled out. The list of rational root candidates has thus shrunk to just x = 2 and x = 2/3.  If a root r 1 is found, Horner's method will also yield a polynomial of degree n − 1 whose roots, together with r 1 , are exactly the roots of the original polynomial. It may also be the case that none of the candidates is a solution; in this case the equation has no rational solution. If the equation lacks a constant term a 0 , then 0 is one of the rational roots of the equation.
