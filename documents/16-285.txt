   4-phosphopantoate—beta-alanine ligase      4-phosphopantoate—beta-alanine ligase   4-phosphopantoate—beta-alanine ligase (, phosphopantothenate synthetase , TK1686 protein ) is an enzyme with system name (R)-4-phosphopantoate:beta-alanine ligase (AMP-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + (R)-4-phosphopantoate + beta-alanine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + (R)-4'-phosphopantothenate   The conversion of (R)-pantoate to (R)-4'-phosphopantothenate is part of the pathway leading to biosynthesis of 4'-phosphopantetheine.
