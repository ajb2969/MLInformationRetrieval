Increment theorem

In non-standard analysis, a field of mathematics, the increment theorem states the following: Suppose a function y = f(x) is differentiable at x and that Δx is infinitesimal. Then



for some infinitesimal ε, where



If 
 
 
 
  then we may write



which implies that 
 
 
 
 , or in other words that 
 
 
 
  is infinitely close to 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
  is the standard part of 
 
 
 
 
 .
