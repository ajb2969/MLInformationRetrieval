Forward rate

The forward rate is the future yield on a bond. It is calculated using the yield curve. For example, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill six months from now is a forward rate.1
Forward rate calculation
To extract the forward rate, one needs the zero-coupon yield curve. The general formula used to calculate the forward rate is:
Simple rate



Compound rate



Exponential rate



 
  is the forward rate between term 
 
 
 
  and term 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is the time length between time 0 and term 
 
 
 
  (in years),


 
  is the time length between time 0 and term 
 
 
 
  (in years),


 
  is the zero-coupon yield for the time period 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is the zero-coupon yield for the time period

Derivation
We are trying to find the future interest rate for time period 
 
 
 
 , given the rate 
 
 
 
  for time period 
 
 
 
  and rate 
 
 
 
  for time period 
 
 
 
 . To do this, we solve for the interest rate 
 
 
 
  for time period 
 
 
 
  for which the proceeds from investing at rate 
 
 
 
  for time period 
 
 
 
  and then reinvesting those proceeds at rate 
 
 
 
  for time period 
 
 
 
  is equal to the proceeds from investing at rate 
 
 
 
  for time period 
 
 
 
 . Or, mathematically:



Solving for 
 
 
 
  yields the above formula.
