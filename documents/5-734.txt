   Forward rate      Forward rate   The forward rate is the future yield on a bond . It is calculated using the yield curve . For example, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill six months from now is a forward rate . 1  Forward rate calculation  To extract the forward rate, one needs the zero-coupon  yield curve . The general formula used to calculate the forward rate is:  Simple rate       r    t  1   ,   t  2     =    1    d  2   -   d  1      (     1  +    r  2    d  2      1  +    r  1    d  1      -  1   )         subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2         1     subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1           1     subscript  r  2    subscript  d  2       1     subscript  r  1    subscript  d  1      1      r_{t_{1},t_{2}}=\frac{1}{d_{2}-d_{1}}\left(\frac{1+r_{2}d_{2}}{1+r_{1}d_{1}}-1\right)     Compound rate       r    t  1   ,   t  2     =     (     (   1  +   r  2    )    d  2      (   1  +   r  1    )    d  1     )    1    d  2   -   d  1      -  1        subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2        superscript     superscript    1   subscript  r  2     subscript  d  2     superscript    1   subscript  r  1     subscript  d  1       1     subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1      1     r_{t_{1},t_{2}}=\left(\frac{(1+r_{2})^{d_{2}}}{(1+r_{1})^{d_{1}}}\right)^{%
 \frac{1}{d_{2}-d_{1}}}-1     Exponential rate       r    t  1   ,   t  2     =      r  2    d  2    -    r  1    d  1       d  2   -   d  1          subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2            subscript  r  2    subscript  d  2       subscript  r  1    subscript  d  1        subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1       r_{t_{1},t_{2}}=\frac{r_{2}d_{2}-r_{1}d_{1}}{d_{2}-d_{1}}       r    t  1   ,   t  2       subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2      r_{t_{1},t_{2}}   is the forward rate between term    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   and term    t  2     subscript  t  2    t_{2}   ,      d  1     subscript  d  1    d_{1}   is the time length between time 0 and term    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   (in years),      d  2     subscript  d  2    d_{2}   is the time length between time 0 and term    t  2     subscript  t  2    t_{2}   (in years),      r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   is the zero-coupon yield for the time period    (  0  ,   t  1   )     0   subscript  t  1     (0,t_{1})   ,      r  2     subscript  r  2    r_{2}   is the zero-coupon yield for the time period    (  0  ,   t  2   )     0   subscript  t  2     (0,t_{2})   ,  Derivation  We are trying to find the future interest rate for time period    (   t  1   ,   t  2   )      subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2     (t_{1},t_{2})   , given the rate    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   for time period    (  0  ,   t  1   )     0   subscript  t  1     (0,t_{1})   and rate    r  2     subscript  r  2    r_{2}   for time period    (  0  ,   t  2   )     0   subscript  t  2     (0,t_{2})   . To do this, we solve for the interest rate    r    t  1   ,   t  2       subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2      r_{t_{1},t_{2}}   for time period    (   t  1   ,   t  2   )      subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2     (t_{1},t_{2})   for which the proceeds from investing at rate    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   for time period    (  0  ,   t  1   )     0   subscript  t  1     (0,t_{1})   and then reinvesting those proceeds at rate    r    t  1   ,   t  2       subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2      r_{t_{1},t_{2}}   for time period    (   t  1   ,   t  2   )      subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2     (t_{1},t_{2})   is equal to the proceeds from investing at rate    r  2     subscript  r  2    r_{2}   for time period    (  0  ,   t  2   )     0   subscript  t  2     (0,t_{2})   . Or, mathematically:         (   1  +   r  1    )    d  1      (   1  +   r    t  1   ,   t  2      )     d  2   -   d  1      =    (   1  +   r  2    )    d  2           superscript    1   subscript  r  1     subscript  d  1     superscript    1   subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2         subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1       superscript    1   subscript  r  2     subscript  d  2      (1+r_{1})^{d_{1}}(1+r_{t_{1},t_{2}})^{d_{2}-d_{1}}=(1+r_{2})^{d_{2}}     Solving for    r    t  1   ,   t  2       subscript  r    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2      r_{t_{1},t_{2}}   yields the above formula.
