   Indoxyl-UDPG glucosyltransferase      Indoxyl-UDPG glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an indoxyl-UDPG glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + indoxyl   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + indican   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and indoxyl , whereas its two products are UDP and indican .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:indoxyl 3-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called indoxyl-UDPG-glucosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
