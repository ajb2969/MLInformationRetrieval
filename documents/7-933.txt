   Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma      Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma   The Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma is a basic result in mathematical fixed-point theory published in 1929 by Knaster , Kuratowski and Mazurkiewicz . 1  The KKM lemma can be proved from Sperner's lemma and can be used to prove the Brouwer fixed-point theorem .  Statement  Suppose that a simplex     Δ  m     subscript  normal-Δ  m    \Delta_{m}   is covered by the closed sets     C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   for    i  ∈  I  =   {  1  ,  …  ,  m  }         i  I        1  normal-…  m      i\in I=\{1,\dots,m\}   and that for all     I  k   ⊂  I       subscript  I  k   I    I_{k}\subset I   the face of    Δ  m     subscript  normal-Δ  m    \Delta_{m}   that is spanned by    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   for    i  ∈   I  k       i   subscript  I  k     i\in I_{k}   is covered by    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   for    i  ∈   I  k       i   subscript  I  k     i\in I_{k}   then all the    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   have a common intersection point.  Example  The two-dimensional case may serve as an illustration. In this case the simplex    Δ  3     subscript  normal-Δ  3    \Delta_{3}   is a triangle, whose vertices we can label 1, 2 and 3. We are given three closed sets     C  1   ,   C  2   ,   C  3       subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2    subscript  C  3     C_{1},C_{2},C_{3}   which collectively cover the triangle; also we are told that    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   covers vertex 1,    C  2     subscript  C  2    C_{2}   covers vertex 2,    C  3     subscript  C  3    C_{3}   covers vertex 3, and that the edge 12 (from vertex 1 to vertex 2) is covered by the sets    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   and    C  2     subscript  C  2    C_{2}   , the edge 23 is covered by the sets    C  2     subscript  C  2    C_{2}   and    C  3     subscript  C  3    C_{3}   , the edge 31 is covered by the sets    C  3     subscript  C  3    C_{3}   and    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   . The KKM lemma states that the sets     C  1   ,   C  2   ,   C  3       subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2    subscript  C  3     C_{1},C_{2},C_{3}   have at least one point in common.
