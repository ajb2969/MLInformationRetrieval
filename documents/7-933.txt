Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma

The Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma is a basic result in mathematical fixed-point theory published in 1929 by Knaster, Kuratowski and Mazurkiewicz.1
The KKM lemma can be proved from Sperner's lemma and can be used to prove the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.
Statement
Suppose that a simplex

 
  is covered by the closed sets

 
  for 
 
 
 
  and that for all 
 
 
 
  the face of 
 
 
 
  that is spanned by 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  is covered by 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  then all the 
 
 
 
  have a common intersection point.
Example
The two-dimensional case may serve as an illustration. In this case the simplex 
 
 
 
  is a triangle, whose vertices we can label 1, 2 and 3. We are given three closed sets 
 
 
 
  which collectively cover the triangle; also we are told that 
 
 
 
  covers vertex 1, 
 
 
 
  covers vertex 2, 
 
 
 
  covers vertex 3, and that the edge 12 (from vertex 1 to vertex 2) is covered by the sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the edge 23 is covered by the sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the edge 31 is covered by the sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The KKM lemma states that the sets 
 
 
 
  have at least one point in common.
