   Kauffman polynomial      Kauffman polynomial   In knot theory , the Kauffman polynomial is a 2-variable knot polynomial due to Louis Kauffman . It is initially defined on a link diagram as       F   (  K  )    (  a  ,  z  )    =    a   -   w   (  K  )      L   (  K  )          F  K   a  z       superscript  a      w  K     L  K     F(K)(a,z)=a^{-w(K)}L(K)\,     where    w   (  K  )       w  K    w(K)   is the writhe of the link diagram and    L   (  K  )       L  K    L(K)   is a polynomial in a and z defined on link diagrams by the following properties:        L   (  O  )    =  1        L  O   1    L(O)=1   (O is the unknot)         L   (   s  r   )    =   a  L   (  s  )     ,    L   (   s  ℓ   )    =    a   -  1    L   (  s  )      .     formulae-sequence      L   subscript  s  r      a  L  s        L   subscript  s  normal-ℓ       superscript  a    1    L  s      L(s_{r})=aL(s),\qquad L(s_{\ell})=a^{-1}L(s).     L is unchanged under type II and III Reidemeister moves   Here   s   s   s   is a strand and    s  r     subscript  s  r    s_{r}   (resp.    s  ℓ     subscript  s  normal-ℓ    s_{\ell}   ) is the same strand with a right-handed (resp. left-handed) curl added (using a type I Reidemeister move).  Additionally L must satisfy Kauffman's skein relation :      The pictures represent the L polynomial of the diagrams which differ inside a disc as shown but are identical outside.  Kauffman showed that L exists and is a regular isotopy invariant of unoriented links. It follows easily that F is an ambient isotopy invariant of oriented links.  The Jones polynomial is a special case of the Kauffman polynomial, as the L polynomial specializes to the bracket polynomial . The Kauffman polynomial is related to Chern-Simons gauge theories for SO(N) in the same way that the HOMFLY polynomial is related to Chern-Simons gauge theories for SU(N) (see Witten's article "Quantum field theory and the Jones polynomial", in Commun. Math. Phys.)  Further reading   Louis Kauffman , On Knots , (1987), ISBN 0-691-08435-1   External links   Springer EoM entry for Kauffman polynomial    "  Category:Knot theory  Category:Polynomials
