   Respiratory alkalosis      Respiratory alkalosis   Respiratory alkalosis is a medical condition in which increased respiration elevates the blood pH beyond the normal range (7.35-7.45) with a concurrent reduction in arterial levels of carbon dioxide . This condition is one of the four basic categories of disruption of acid-base homeostasis .  Terminology   Alkalosis refers to the process due to which there is elevation of blood pH more than 7.45.  Alkalemia refers to an arterial blood pH of greater than 7.45.   Classification  There are two types of respiratory alkalosis: chronic and acute as a result of the 3-5 day delay in kidney compensation of the abnormality. 1 2   Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs rapidly. For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO 2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 2 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion due to acute compensation. During acute respiratory alkalosis, the person may lose consciousness where the rate of ventilation will resume to normal.    Chronic respiratory alkalosis is a more long-standing condition. For every 10 mmHg drop in PCO 2 in arterial blood, there is a corresponding 5 mEq/L drop in bicarbonate ion. The drop of 5 mEq/L of bicarbonate ion is a compensation effect which reduces the alkalosis effect of the drop in PCO 2 in blood. This is termed metabolic compensation.   Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of respiratory alkalosis are related to the decreased blood carbon dioxide levels, and include peripheral paraesthesia . In addition, the alkalosis may disrupt calcium ion balance, and cause the symptoms of hypocalcaemia (such as tetany and fainting ) with no fall in total serum calcium levels. However, chronic respiratory alkalosis leads to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia , by inducing renal PTH-resistance. 3  Mechanism  Respiratory alkalosis generally occurs when some stimulus (see "Causes" below) makes a person hyperventilate. The increased breathing produces increased alveolar respiration, expelling CO 2 from the circulation. This alters the dynamic chemical equilibrium of carbon dioxide in the circulatory system, and the system reacts according to Le Chatelier's principle . Circulating hydrogen ions and bicarbonate are shifted through the carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ) intermediate to make more CO 2 via the enzyme carbonic anhydrase according to the following reaction:        HCO  3  -   +   H  +    →    H  2    CO  3    →    CO  2   +    H  2   O         normal-→     superscript   subscript  HCO  3      superscript  normal-H        subscript  normal-H  2    subscript  CO  3      normal-→       subscript  CO  2      subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O       \rm HCO_{3}^{-}+H^{+}\rightarrow H_{2}CO_{3}\rightarrow CO_{2}+H_{2}O     The net result of this is decreased circulating hydrogen ion concentration, and thus increased pH (alkalosis). There is also a decrease in ionized blood calcium concentration.  Causes  Respiratory alkalosis may be produced as a result of medical treatment ( iatrogenically ) during excessive mechanical ventilation . Other causes include:   psychiatric causes: anxiety , hysteria and stress  CNS causes: stroke , subarachnoid haemorrhage , meningitis  drug use: doxapram , aspirin , caffeine and coffee abuse  moving into high altitude areas, where the low atmospheric pressure of oxygen stimulates increased ventilation  lung disease such as pneumonia , where a hypoxic drive governs breathing more than CO 2 levels (the normal determinant)  fever , which stimulates the respiratory centre in the brainstem  pregnancy  high levels of NH 4 + leading to brain swelling and decreased blood flow to the brain  vocal cord paralysis, compensation for loss of vocal volume results in over-breathing and breathlessness. 4   In popular culture  In The Andromeda Strain , Michael Crichton 's first novel published under his real name, only two people exposed to a pathogenic extraterrestrial microbe survive. Scientists investigating these survivors discover that each had abnormal blood pH. One, a baby, had respiratory alkalosis due to constant crying; the other, an old man, drinks Sterno . As a result, it becomes clear that the microbe cannot survive outside a narrow pH range.
