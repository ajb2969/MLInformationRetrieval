   Heteroglycan alpha-mannosyltransferase      Heteroglycan alpha-mannosyltransferase   In enzymology , a heteroglycan alpha-mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + heteroglycan   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + 2(or 3)-alpha-D-mannosyl-heteroglycan   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and heteroglycan , whereas its 3 products are GDP , 2-alpha-D-mannosyl-heteroglycan , and 3-alpha-D-mannosyl-heteroglycan .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , to be specific the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose:heteroglycan 2-(or 3-)-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase . Other names in common use include GDP mannose alpha-mannosyltransferase , and guanosine diphosphomannose-heteroglycan alpha-mannosyltransferase .
