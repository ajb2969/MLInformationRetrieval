Varignon's theorem (mechanics)

The Varignon Theorem is a theorem by French mathematician Pierre Varignon (1654-1722), published in 1687 in his book Projet d' unè nouvelle mèchanique. The theorem states that the moment of a resultant of two concurrent forces about any point is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments of its components about the same point.1
Proof
For a set n of vectors 
 
 
 
  that concurs at point O in space. The resultant is:

The moment of each vector is:



In terms of summary, taking out the common factor 
 
 
 
 
 , and considering the expression of R, results:
