TRNA (guanine9-N1)-methyltransferase

TRNA (guanine9-N1)-methyltransferase (, Trm10p, tRNA(m1G9/m1A9)-methyltransferase, tRNA(m1G9/m1A9)MTase, tRNA (guanine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase, tRNA m1G9-methyltransferase, tRNA m1G9 MTase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine9-N1)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine9 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methylguanine9 in tRNA
 

The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae specifically methylates guanine9.
