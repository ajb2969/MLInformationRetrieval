   TRNA (guanine9-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (guanine9-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (guanine 9 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, Trm10p , tRNA(m1G9/m1A9)-methyltransferase , tRNA(m1G9/m1A9)MTase , tRNA (guanine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase , tRNA m1G9-methyltransferase , tRNA m1G9 MTase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine 9 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 9 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methylguanine 9 in tRNA   The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae specifically methylates guanine 9 .
