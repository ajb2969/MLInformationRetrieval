Parallelization (mathematics)

In mathematics, a parallelization1 of a manifold

 
  of dimension n is a set of n global linearly independent vector fields.
Formal definition
Given a manifold 
 
 
 
  of dimension n, a parallelization of 
 
 
 
  is a set 
 
 
 
  of n vector fields defined on all of 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  the set 
 
 
 
  is a basis of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the fiber over 
 
 
 
  of the tangent vector bundle

 
 .
A manifold is called parallelizable whenever admits a parallelization.
Examples

Every Lie group is a parallelizable manifold.
The product of parallelizable manifolds is parallelizable.
Every affine space, considered as manifold, is parallelizable.

Properties
Proposition. A manifold 
 
 
 
  is parallelizable iff there is a diffeomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that the first projection of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and for each 
 
 
 
  the second factor—restricted to 
 
 
 
 —is a linear map 
 
 
 
 .
In other words, 
 
 
 
  is parallelizable if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a trivial bundle. For example suppose that 
 
 
 
  is an open subset of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., an open submanifold of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is clearly parallelizable.2
