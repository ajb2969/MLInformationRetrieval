   Long-chain-fatty-acid—luciferin-component ligase      Long-chain-fatty-acid—luciferin-component ligase   In enzymology , a long-chain-fatty-acid-luciferin-component ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + an acid + protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + an acyl-protein thioester   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , acid , and protein , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and acyl-protein thioester .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-fatty-acid:protein ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme is also called acyl-protein synthetase .
