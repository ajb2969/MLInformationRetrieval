Becquerel




Becquerel

The becquerel (symbol Bq) (pronounced:  ) is the SI derived unit of radioactivity. One Bq is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second. The Bq unit is therefore equivalent to an inverse second, s−1. The becquerel is named after Henri Becquerel, who shared a Nobel Prize with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie in 1903 for their work in discovering radioactivity.1
Definition
1 Bq = 1 s−12
A special name was introduced for the reciprocal second (s−1) to represent radioactivity to avoid potentially dangerous mistakes with prefixes. For example, 1 µs−1 could be taken to mean 106 disintegrations per second: 1·(10−6 s)−1 = 106 s−1.3 Other names considered were hertz (Hz), a special name already in use for the reciprocal second, and fourier (Fr).4 The hertz is now only used for periodic phenomena.5 Whereas 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second, 1 Bq is 1 aperiodic radioactivity event per second.
Prefixes
Like any SI unit, Bq can be prefixed; commonly used multiples are kBq (kilobecquerel, 103 Bq), MBq (megabecquerel, 106 Bq), GBq (gigabecquerel, 109 Bq), TBq (terabecquerel, 1012 Bq), and PBq (petabecquerel, 1015 Bq). For practical applications, 1 Bq is a small unit; therefore, the prefixes are common. For example, the roughly 0.0169 g of potassium-40 present in a typical human body produces approximately 266,000 disintegrations per minute, which equates to about 4,400 disintegrations per second or 4.4 kBq of activity.6 The global inventory of carbon-14 is estimated to be  (8.5 EBq, 8.5 exabecquerel).7 The nuclear explosion in Hiroshima () is estimated to have produced  (8 YBq, 8 yottabecquerel).8
Relationship to the curie
The becquerel succeeded the curie (Ci),9 an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226. The curie is defined as 3.7·1010 s−1, or 37 GBq.10
Conversion factors:

1 Ci =  = 37 GBq
 
1 μCi = 37,000 Bq = 37 kBq
 
1 Bq =  = 
 
1 GBq = 0.027 Ci
 

Calculation of radioactivity
For a given mass 
 
 
 
  (in grams) of an isotope with atomic mass

 
  (in g/mol) and a half-life of 
 
 
 
  (in s), the amount of radioactivity can be calculated using:



With 
 
 
 
 =6.022 141 79(30)
 
 
 
  mol−1, the Avogadro constant.
Since m/ma is the number of mols (n), the amount of radioactivity 
 
 
 
  can be calculated by:



For instance, one gram of potassium contains 0.000117 gram of 40K (all other naturally occurring isotopes are stable) that has a 
 
 
 
  of  = ,11 and has an atomic mass of 39.964 g/mol,12 so the radioactivity is 30 Bq.
