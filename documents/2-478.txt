   Becquerel      Becquerel   The becquerel (symbol Bq ) (pronounced:  ) is the SI derived unit of radioactivity . One Bq is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second . The Bq unit is therefore equivalent to an inverse second, s −1 . The becquerel is named after Henri Becquerel , who shared a Nobel Prize with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie in 1903 for their work in discovering radioactivity. 1  Definition  1 Bq = 1 s −1 2  A special name was introduced for the reciprocal second (s −1 ) to represent radioactivity to avoid potentially dangerous mistakes with prefixes. For example, 1 µs −1 could be taken to mean 10 6 disintegrations per second: 1·(10 −6 s) −1 = 10 6 s −1 . 3 Other names considered were hertz (Hz), a special name already in use for the reciprocal second, and fourier (Fr). 4 The hertz is now only used for periodic phenomena. 5 Whereas 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second , 1 Bq is 1 aperiodic radioactivity event per second.  Prefixes  Like any SI unit, Bq can be prefixed ; commonly used multiples are kBq (kilobecquerel, 10 3 Bq), MBq (megabecquerel, 10 6 Bq), GBq (gigabecquerel, 10 9 Bq), TBq (terabecquerel, 10 12 Bq), and PBq (petabecquerel, 10 15 Bq). For practical applications, 1 Bq is a small unit; therefore, the prefixes are common. For example, the roughly 0.0169 g of potassium-40 present in a typical human body produces approximately 266,000 disintegrations per minute, which equates to about 4,400 disintegrations per second or 4.4 kBq of activity. 6 The global inventory of carbon-14 is estimated to be  (8.5 EBq , 8.5 exabecquerel). 7 The nuclear explosion in Hiroshima () is estimated to have produced  (8 YBq , 8 yottabecquerel). 8  Relationship to the curie  The becquerel succeeded the curie (Ci), 9 an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226 . The curie is defined as 3.7·10 10 s −1 , or 37 GBq. 10  Conversion factors:   1 Ci =  = 37 GBq  1 μCi = 37,000 Bq = 37 kBq  1 Bq =  =  1 GBq = 0.027 Ci   Calculation of radioactivity  For a given mass   m   m   m   (in grams) of an isotope with atomic mass     m  a     subscript  m  a    m_{a}   (in g/mol) and a half-life of    t   1  /  2      subscript  t    1  2     t_{1/2}   (in s), the amount of radioactivity can be calculated using:       A   B  q    =    m   m  a     N  A     ln   (  2  )     t   1  /  2           subscript  A    B  q        m   subscript  m  a     subscript  N  A       2    subscript  t    1  2        A_{Bq}=\frac{m}{m_{a}}N_{A}\frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}     With    N  A     subscript  N  A    N_{A}   =6.022 141 79(30)     ×    10  2   3       absent     superscript  10  2   3     \times 10^{2}3   mol −1 , the Avogadro constant .  Since m/ma is the number of mols (n), the amount of radioactivity   A   A   A   can be calculated by:       A   B  q    =   n   N  A     ln   (  2  )     t   1  /  2           subscript  A    B  q      n   subscript  N  A       2    subscript  t    1  2        A_{Bq}=nN_{A}\frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}     For instance, one gram of potassium contains 0.000117 gram of 40 K (all other naturally occurring isotopes are stable) that has a    t   1  /  2      subscript  t    1  2     t_{1/2}   of  = , 11 and has an atomic mass of 39.964 g/mol, 12 so the radioactivity is 30 Bq.
