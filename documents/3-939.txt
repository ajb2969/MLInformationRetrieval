   Weierstrass M-test      Weierstrass M-test   In mathematics , the Weierstrass M-test is a test for showing that an infinite series of functions converges uniformly . It applies to series whose terms are functions with real or complex values, and is analogous to the comparison test for determining the convergence of series of real or complex numbers.  The Weierstrass M-test is a special case of Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem , where the measure is taken to be the counting measure over an atomic measure space.  Statement   Weierstrass M-test. Suppose that { f n } is a sequence of real- or complex-valued functions defined on a set  A , and that there is a sequence of positive numbers { M n } satisfying          ∀  n   ≥  1   ,    ∀  x   ∈  A    :    |    f  n    (  x  )    |   ≤   M  n     ,     normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  n   1      for-all  x   A           subscript  f  n   x     subscript  M  n      \forall n\geq 1,\forall x\in A:\ |f_{n}(x)|\leq M_{n},           ∑   n  =  1   ∞    M  n    <  ∞        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  M  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}M_{n}<\infty   Then the series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞     f  n    (  x  )        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  f  n   x     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}(x)   converges uniformly on A .   Remark. The result is often used in combination with the uniform limit theorem . Together they say that if, in addition to the above conditions, the set A is a topological space and the functions f n are continuous on A , then the series converges to a continuous function.  Generalization  A more general version of the Weierstrass M-test holds if the codomain of the functions { f n } is any Banach space , in which case the statement       |   f  n   |   ≤   M  n          subscript  f  n     subscript  M  n     |f_{n}|\leq M_{n}   may be replaced by       ∥   f  n   ∥   ≤   M  n        norm   subscript  f  n     subscript  M  n     \|f_{n}\|\leq M_{n}   , where    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   is the norm on the Banach space. For an example of the use of this test on a Banach space, see the article Fréchet derivative .  Proof  Let M be the limit of the sum     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    M  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  M  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}M_{n}   . Since     |    f  n    (  x  )    |   ≤   M  n            subscript  f  n   x     subscript  M  n     |f_{n}(x)|\leq M_{n}   the sum     ∑   n  =  1   ∞     f  n    (  x  )        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  f  n   x     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}(x)   is absolutely convergent, call its limit f ( x ).  By convergence of the M sum, for ε > 0 there exists an integer K such that         ∀  k   >  K   :    |   M  -    ∑   n  =  1   k    M  n     |   <  ε    .     normal-:     for-all  k   K         M    superscript   subscript     n  1    k    subscript  M  n      ε     \forall k>K:\ \left|M-\sum_{n=1}^{k}M_{n}\right|<\varepsilon.   We will show that     ∑   n  =  1   ∞     f  n    (  x  )        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  f  n   x     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}(x)   converges uniformly on the set A by showing that          ∀  k   >  K   ,    ∀  x   ∈  A    :    |    f   (  x  )    -    ∑   n  =  1   k     f  n    (  x  )      |   <  ε    .     normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  k   K      for-all  x   A            f  x     superscript   subscript     n  1    k      subscript  f  n   x      ε     \forall k>K,\forall x\in A:\ \left|f(x)-\sum_{n=1}^{k}f_{n}(x)\right|<\varepsilon.   The crucial point here is that K does not depend on x .         ∀  x   ∈  A   :    |    f   (  x  )    -    ∑   n  =  1   k     f  n    (  x  )      |   =   |    ∑   n  =   k  +  1    ∞     f  n    (  x  )     |   ≤    ∑   n  =   k  +  1    ∞    |    f  n    (  x  )    |    ≤    ∑   n  =   k  +  1    ∞    M  n    =   |   M  -    ∑   n  =  1   k    M  n     |   <  ε    .     normal-:     for-all  x   A             f  x     superscript   subscript     n  1    k      subscript  f  n   x          superscript   subscript     n    k  1          subscript  f  n   x            superscript   subscript     n    k  1            subscript  f  n   x            superscript   subscript     n    k  1        subscript  M  n             M    superscript   subscript     n  1    k    subscript  M  n           ε      \forall x\in A:\ \left|f(x)-\sum_{n=1}^{k}f_{n}(x)\right|=\left|\sum_{n=k+1}^{%
 \infty}f_{n}(x)\right|\leq\sum_{n=k+1}^{\infty}\left|f_{n}(x)\right|\leq\sum_{%
 n=k+1}^{\infty}M_{n}=\left|M-\sum_{n=1}^{k}M_{n}\right|<\varepsilon.     Another Proof  By definition the series     ∑   k  =  1   ∞     f  k    (  x  )        superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  f  k   x     \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_{k}(x)   converge uniformly if the sequence of the partial sums of the series,        S  n    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   n     f  k    (  x  )            subscript  S  n   x     superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  f  k   x      S_{n}(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}f_{k}(x)   converges uniformly. Since the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    M  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  M  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}M_{n}   converge and     M  n   ≥  0       subscript  M  n   0    M_{n}\geq 0   for every   n   n   n   , then by the Cauchy criterion for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0    there exists a natural number    N   (  ε  )       N  ε    N(\varepsilon)   such that for every    n  >  m  >   N   (  ε  )          n  m         N  ε      n>m>N(\varepsilon)   holds         ∑   k  =   m  +  1    n    M  k    <  ε   .        superscript   subscript     k    m  1     n    subscript  M  k    ε    \sum_{k=m+1}^{n}M_{k}<\varepsilon.   Now for the chosen    N   (  ε  )       N  ε    N(\varepsilon)   for every    x  ∈  A      x  A    x\in A   and every    n  >  m  >   N   (  ε  )          n  m         N  ε      n>m>N(\varepsilon)   we have        |     S  n    (  x  )    -    S  m    (  x  )     |   ≤    |    ∑   k  =   m  +  1    n     f  k    (  x  )     |    ≤   (  1  )      ∑   k  =   m  +  1    n    |    f  k    (  x  )    |     ≤    ∑   k  =   m  +  1    n    M  k    <  ε   .               subscript  S  n   x      subscript  S  m   x           superscript   subscript     k    m  1     n      subscript  f  k   x      1      superscript   subscript     k    m  1     n        subscript  f  k   x             superscript   subscript     k    m  1     n    subscript  M  k         ε     \left|S_{n}(x)-S_{m}(x)\right|\leq\left|\sum_{k=m+1}^{n}f_{k}(x)\right|%
 \overset{(1)}{\leq}\sum_{k=m+1}^{n}|f_{k}(x)|\leq\sum_{k=m+1}^{n}M_{k}<\varepsilon.   Thus the sequence of partial sums of the series converges uniformly which implies that the series converge uniformly. Inequality (1) follows from the triangle inequality .
