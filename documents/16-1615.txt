   Exposed point      Exposed point   In mathematics, an exposed point of a convex set    C   C   C   is a point    x  ∈  C      x  C    x\in C   at which some continuous linear functional attains its strict maximum over   C   C   C   . Such a functional is then said to expose    x   x   x   . Note that there can be many exposing functionals for   x   x   x   . The set of exposed points of   C   C   C   is usually denoted    exp   (  C  )       C    \exp(C)   .  A stronger notion is that of strongly exposed point of   C   C   C   which is an exposed point    x  ∈  C      x  C    x\in C   such that some exposing functional   f   f   f   of   x   x   x   attains its strong maximum over   C   C   C   at   x   x   x   , i.e. for each sequence     (   x  n   )   ⊂  C       subscript  x  n   C    (x_{n})\subset C   we have the following implication     f   (   x  n   )    →    max  f    (  C  )    ⟹   ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥   →  0       normal-→    f   subscript  x  n        f   C     normal-⟹     norm     subscript  x  n   x      normal-→    0     f(x_{n})\to\max f(C)\Longrightarrow\|x_{n}-x\|\to 0   . The set of all strongly exposed points of   C   C   C   is usually denoted     str  exp    (  C  )       str    C    \operatorname{str}\exp(C)   .  There are two weaker notions, that of extreme point and that of support point of   C   C   C   .  "  Category:Mathematical analysis  Category:Convex geometry  Category:Functional analysis
