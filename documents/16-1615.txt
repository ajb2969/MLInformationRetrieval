Exposed point

In mathematics, an exposed point of a convex set

 
  is a point 
 
 
 
  at which some continuous linear functional attains its strict maximum over 
 
 
 
 . Such a functional is then said to expose

 
 
 . Note that there can be many exposing functionals for 
 
 
 
 . The set of exposed points of 
 
 
 
  is usually denoted 
 
 
 
 .
A stronger notion is that of strongly exposed point of 
 
 
 
  which is an exposed point 
 
 
 
 
  such that some exposing functional 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  attains its strong maximum over 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , i.e. for each sequence 
 
 
 
 
  we have the following implication
 
 
 
 . The set of all strongly exposed points of 
 
 
 
  is usually denoted 
 
 
 
 .
There are two weaker notions, that of extreme point and that of support point of 
 
 
 
 .
