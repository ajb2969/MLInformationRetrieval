Prenyl-diphosphatase




Prenyl-diphosphatase

In enzymology, a prenyl-diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

prenyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  prenol + diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are prenyl diphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are prenol and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on diphosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is prenyl-diphosphate diphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include prenyl-pyrophosphatase, prenol pyrophosphatase, and prenylphosphatase.
