   Weakly contractible      Weakly contractible   In mathematics , a topological space is said to be weakly contractible if all of its homotopy groups are trivial.  Property  It follows from Whitehead's Theorem that if a CW-complex is weakly contractible then it is contractible .  Example  Define    S  ∞     superscript  S     S^{\infty}   to be the inductive limit of the spheres      S  n   ,  n   ≥  1        superscript  S  n   n   1    S^{n},n\geq 1   . Then this space is weakly contractible. Since    S  ∞     superscript  S     S^{\infty}   is moreover a CW-complex, it is also contractible.
