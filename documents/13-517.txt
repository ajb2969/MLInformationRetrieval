Newey–West estimator
A Newey–West estimator is used in statistics and econometrics to provide an estimate of the covariance matrix of the parameters of a regression-type model when this model is applied in situations where the standard assumptions of regression analysis do not apply.1 It was devised by Whitney K. Newey and Kenneth D. West in 1987, although there are a number of later variants.2345 The estimator is used to try to overcome autocorrelation, or correlation, and heteroskedasticity in the error terms in the models. This is often used to correct the effects of correlation in the error terms in regressions applied to time series data.
The problem in autocorrelation, often found in time series data, is that the error terms are correlated over time. This can be demonstrated in 
 
 
 
 , a matrix of sums of squares and cross products that involves 
 
 
 
  and the rows of 
 
 
 
 . The least squares estimator 
 
 
 
  is a consistent estimator of 
 
 
 
 . This implies that the least squares residuals

 
  are "point-wise" consistent estimators of their population counterparts 
 
 
 
 . The general approach, then, will be to use 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to devise an estimator of 
 
 
 
 .6 This means that as the time between error terms increases, the correlation between the error terms decreases. The estimator thus can be used to improve the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression when the variables have heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation.
