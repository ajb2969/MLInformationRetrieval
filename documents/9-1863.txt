   Modern Arabic mathematical notation      Modern Arabic mathematical notation   The designation modern Arabic mathematical notation is used for a mathematical notation based on the Arabic script , especially at pre-university levels of education. Its form is mostly derived from Western notation, but has some notable features that set it apart from its Western counterpart. The most remarkable of those features is the fact that it is written from right to left following the normal direction of the Arabic script. Other differences include the replacement of the Latin alphabet letters for symbols with Arabic letters and the use of Arabic names for functions and relations.  Features   It is written from right to left following the normal direction of the Arabic script. Other differences include the replacement of the Latin alphabet letters for symbols with Arabic letters and the use of Arabic names for functions and relations.  The notation exhibits one of the very few remaining vestiges of non-dotted Arabic scripts, as dots over and under letters ( I'jam ) are usually omitted.  Letter cursivity (connectedness) of Arabic is also taken advantage of, in a few cases, to define variables using more than one letter. The most widespread example of this kind of usage is the canonical symbol for the radius of a circle نق (), which is written using the two letters nūn and qāf . When variable names are juxtaposed (as when expressing multiplication) they are written non-cursively.   Variations  Notation differs slightly from region to another. In tertiary education , most regions use the Western notation . The notation mainly differs in numeral system used, and in mathematical symbol used.  Numeral systems  There are three numeral systems used in right to left mathematical notation.   " Western Arabic numerals " (sometimes called European) are used in western Arabic regions (e.g. Morocco )  " Eastern Arabic numerals " are used in middle and eastern Arabic regions (e.g. Egypt and Syria )  "Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals" are used in Persian and Urdu speaking regions (e.g. Iran , Pakistan , India )   (Figure)  Table of numerals   Mirrored Latin symbols  Sometimes, symbols used in Arabic mathematical notation differ according to the region:      Sometimes, mirrored Latin symbols are used in Arabic mathematical notation (especially in western Arabic regions):      Examples  Mathematical letters      Latin   Arabic          a   a   a     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical alif.PNG         b   b   b     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical beh.PNG         c   c   c     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical geem.PNG         d   d   d     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical dal.PNG         x   x   x     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical seen.PNG         y   y   y     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical sad.PNG         z   z   z     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical ain.PNG         It is contested that the usage of Latin x in maths is derived from the first letter of the Arabic word شيء [ʃajʔ(un)] meaning thing . 1 ( X was used in old Spanish for the sound /ʃ/ ). However, according to others there is no historical evidence for this. 2 3   Mathematical constants and units      Description   Latin   Arabic   Notes       Euler's number      e   e   e     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical heh.PNG       imaginary unit      i   i   i     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical teh.PNG       pi      π   π   \pi     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical tah.PNG    also   π   π   \pi   in some regions     radius      r   r   r     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical radius.PNG       kilogram   kg  (Figure)  Arabic kilogram.PNG    In some regions alternative symbols like  or  are used     gram   g  (Figure)  Arabic gram.PNG       meter   m  (Figure)  Arabic mathematical meem.PNG       centimeter   cm  (Figure)  Arabic cm.PNG       millimeter   mm  (Figure)  Arabic mm.PNG       kilometer   km  (Figure)  Arabic Km.PNG    also  in some regions     second   s  (Figure)  Arabic mathematical theh.PNG       minute   min  (Figure)  Arabic mathematical Dal large.PNG    also  in some regions     hour   h  (Figure)  Arabic mathematical seen.PNG       kilometer per hour   km/h  (Figure)  Arabic kmph.PNG       degree Celsius   °C  (Figure)  Arabic celsius degree.PNG    also     degree Fahrenheit   °F  (Figure)  Arabic fahrenheit degree.PNG       millimeters of mercury   mmHg  (Figure)  Arabic mmHg.PNG       Ångström   Å  (Figure)  Arabic angestrom.PNG         Sets and number systems      Description   Latin   Arabic       Natural numbers      ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical tah large.PNG      Integers      ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical Sad large.PNG      Rational numbers      ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical noon large.PNG      Real numbers      ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical hah large.PNG      Imaginary numbers      𝕀   𝕀   \mathbb{I}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical teh large.PNG      Complex numbers      ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical meem large.PNG      Empty set      ∅     \varnothing         ∅     \varnothing        Is an element of      ∈     \in         ∋   contains   \ni        Subset      ⊂     \subset         ⊃   superset-of   \supset        Superset      ⊃   superset-of   \supset         ⊂     \subset        Universal set      𝐒   𝐒   \mathbf{S}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical sheen large.PNG        Arithmetic and algebra      Description   Latin   Arabic   Notes       Percent   %  (Figure)  Arabic percent.PNG       Permille   ‰  (Figure)  Arabic permille.PNG       Is proportional to      ∝   proportional-to   \propto     (Figure)  Arabic prop.PNG       n th root        n       n   absent    \sqrt[n]{\,\,\,}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical nth root.PNG       Logarithm      log     \log     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical log.PNG       Logarithm to base b       log  b     subscript   b    \log_{b}     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical log b.PNG       Natural logarithm      ln     \ln     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical ln.PNG       Summation      ∑     \sum     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical sum.PNG    also  in some regions     Product      ∏   product   \prod     (Figure)  Arabic mathematical product.PNG    also   ∏   product   \prod   in some regions     factorial       n  !      n    n!
