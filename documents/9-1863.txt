Modern Arabic mathematical notation

The designation modern Arabic mathematical notation is used for a mathematical notation based on the Arabic script, especially at pre-university levels of education. Its form is mostly derived from Western notation, but has some notable features that set it apart from its Western counterpart. The most remarkable of those features is the fact that it is written from right to left following the normal direction of the Arabic script. Other differences include the replacement of the Latin alphabet letters for symbols with Arabic letters and the use of Arabic names for functions and relations.
Features

It is written from right to left following the normal direction of the Arabic script. Other differences include the replacement of the Latin alphabet letters for symbols with Arabic letters and the use of Arabic names for functions and relations.
The notation exhibits one of the very few remaining vestiges of non-dotted Arabic scripts, as dots over and under letters (I'jam) are usually omitted.
Letter cursivity (connectedness) of Arabic is also taken advantage of, in a few cases, to define variables using more than one letter. The most widespread example of this kind of usage is the canonical symbol for the radius of a circle نق (), which is written using the two letters nūn and qāf. When variable names are juxtaposed (as when expressing multiplication) they are written non-cursively.

Variations
Notation differs slightly from region to another. In tertiary education, most regions use the Western notation. The notation mainly differs in numeral system used, and in mathematical symbol used.
Numeral systems
There are three numeral systems used in right to left mathematical notation.

"Western Arabic numerals" (sometimes called European) are used in western Arabic regions (e.g. Morocco)
"Eastern Arabic numerals" are used in middle and eastern Arabic regions (e.g. Egypt and Syria)
"Eastern Arabic-Indic numerals" are used in Persian and Urdu speaking regions (e.g. Iran, Pakistan, India)

Mirrored Latin symbols
Sometimes, symbols used in Arabic mathematical notation differ according to the region:




Sometimes, mirrored Latin symbols are used in Arabic mathematical notation (especially in western Arabic regions):

It is contested that the usage of Latin x in maths is derived from the first letter of the Arabic word شيء [ʃajʔ(un)] meaning thing.1 (X was used in old Spanish for the sound /ʃ/). However, according to others there is no historical evidence for this.23
