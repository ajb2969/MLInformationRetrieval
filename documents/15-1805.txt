Quaternionic structure

In mathematics, a quaternionic structure or 
 
 
-structure is an axiomatic system that abstracts the concept of a quaternion algebra over a field.
A quaternionic structure is a triple 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an elementary abelian group of exponent

 
  with a distinguished element 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a pointed set with distinguished element 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a symmetric surjection

 
  satisfying axioms



Every field 
 
 
 
  gives rise to a 
 
 
 
 -structure by taking 
 
 
 
 
  to be , 
 
 
 
  the set of Brauer classes of quaternion algebras in the Brauer group of 
 
 
 
  with the split quaternion algebra as distinguished element and 
 
 
 
  the quaternion algebra .
