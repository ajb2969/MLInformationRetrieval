Peptidylamidoglycolate lyase




Peptidylamidoglycolate lyase

In enzymology, a peptidylamidoglycolate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

peptidylamidoglycolate 
 
 
 
  peptidyl amide + glyoxylate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, peptidylamidoglycolate, and two products, peptidyl amide and glyoxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically amidine lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is peptidylamidoglycolate peptidyl-amide-lyase (glyoxylate-forming). Other names in common use include alpha-hydroxyglycine amidating dealkylase, peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase, HGAD, PGL, PAL, and peptidylamidoglycolate peptidylamide-lyase.
