   Spin stiffness      Spin stiffness   The spin-stiffness or spin rigidity or helicity modulus or the " superfluid density " (for bosons the superfluid density is proportional to the spin stiffness) is a constant which represents the change in the ground state energy of a spin system as a result of introducing a slow in plane twist of the spins. The importance of this constant is in its use as an indicator of quantum phase transitions -- specifically in models with metal-insulator transitions such as Mott insulators . It is also related to other topological invariants such as the Berry phase and Chern numbers as in the Quantum hall effect .  Mathematically  Mathematically it can be defined by the following equation:       ρ  s   =       ∂  2    ∂   θ  2        E  0    (  θ  )    N    |    θ  =  0         subscript  ρ  s    evaluated-at     continued-fraction   superscript   2      superscript  θ  2      continued-fraction     subscript  E  0   θ   N      θ  0      \rho_{s}=\cfrac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\cfrac{E_{0}(\theta)}{N}|_{%
 \theta=0}     where    E  0     subscript  E  0    E_{0}   is the ground state energy,   θ   θ   \theta   is the twisting angle, and N is the number of lattice sites.  Spin stiffness of the Heisenberg model  Start off with the simple Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian:       S  i  +   ⟶    S  i  +    e   i   θ  i         normal-⟶   superscript   subscript  S  i        superscript   subscript  S  i      superscript  e    i   subscript  θ  i        S_{i}^{+}\longrightarrow S_{i}^{+}e^{i\theta_{i}}     Now we introduce a rotation in the system at site i by an angle θ i around the z-axis:       S  i  -   ⟶    S  i  -    e   -   i   θ  i          normal-⟶   superscript   subscript  S  i        superscript   subscript  S  i      superscript  e      i   subscript  θ  i         S_{i}^{-}\longrightarrow S_{i}^{-}e^{-i\theta_{i}}          J   i  j   s   =    i  2    (     S  i  +    S  j  -    -    S  i  -    S  j  +     )         superscript   subscript  J    i  j    s      continued-fraction  i  2        superscript   subscript  S  i      superscript   subscript  S  j         superscript   subscript  S  i      superscript   subscript  S  j          J_{ij}^{s}=\cfrac{i}{2}(S_{i}^{+}S_{j}^{-}-S_{i}^{-}S_{j}^{+})     Plugging these back into the Heisenberg Hamiltonian:       T   i  j    =    1  2    (     S  i  +    S  j  -    +    S  i  -    S  j  +     )         subscript  T    i  j       continued-fraction  1  2        superscript   subscript  S  i      superscript   subscript  S  j         superscript   subscript  S  i      superscript   subscript  S  j          T_{ij}=\cfrac{1}{2}(S_{i}^{+}S_{j}^{-}+S_{i}^{-}S_{j}^{+})     now let θ ij = θ i - θ j and expand around θ ij = 0 via a MacLaurin expansion only keeping terms up to second order in θ ij        E   (  θ  )    -   E   (  0  )     =   N   ρ  s    θ  x  2            E  θ     E  0      N   subscript  ρ  s    superscript   subscript  θ  x   2      E(\theta)-E(0)=N\rho_{s}\theta_{x}^{2}     where the first term is independent of θ and the second term is a perturbation for small θ.       ρ  s   =    1  N    [     1  2    ⟨   T  x   ⟩    +    ∑   ν  ≠  0       |   ⟨  0  |   j  x   (  s  )    |  ν  ⟩   |   2     E  ν   -   E  0       ]         subscript  ρ  s      continued-fraction  1  N    delimited-[]       continued-fraction  1  2    delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  T  x       subscript     ν  0     continued-fraction   superscript     quantum-operator-product  0   superscript   subscript  j  x   s   ν    2      subscript  E  ν    subscript  E  0           \rho_{s}=\cfrac{1}{N}\left[\cfrac{1}{2}\langle T_{x}\rangle+\sum_{\nu\neq 0}%
 \cfrac{|\langle 0|j_{x}^{(s)}|\nu\rangle|^{2}}{E_{\nu}-E_{0}}\right]   is the z-component of the spin current operator  $$T_{ij} = \cfrac{1}{2}(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+)$$ is the "spin kinetic energy"  Consider now the case of identical twists, θ x only that exist along nearest neighbor bonds along the x-axis Then since the spin stiffness is related to the difference in the ground state energy by  $$E(\theta) - E(0) = N\rho_s\theta_x^2$$  then for small θ x and with the help of second order perturbation theory we get:  $$\rho_s = \cfrac{1}{N} \left[ \cfrac{1}{2}\langle T_x \rangle + \sum_{\nu \neq 0} \cfrac{ | \langle 0| j_x^{(s)}|\nu\rangle |^2 }{E_{\nu} - E_0}\right]$$  See also   Spin wave   References          "  Category:Quantum mechanics  Category:Magnetism  Category:Statistical mechanics
