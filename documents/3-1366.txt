   Dodecagon      Dodecagon   In geometry , a dodecagon is any polygon with twelve sides and twelve angles .  A regular dodecagon has Schläfli symbol {12} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated  hexagon , t{6}, which alternates two types of edges.  Regular dodecagon  A regular dodecagon has all sides of equal length and all angles equal to 150°. It has 12 lines of symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 12. Its Schläfli symbol is {12}.  The area of a regular dodecagon with side a is given by:     A   A   \displaystyle A     Or, if R is the radius of the circumscribed circle, 1       A  =   6   sin   (   π  6   )     R  2    =   3   R  2     .        A    6      π  6     superscript  R  2           3   superscript  R  2       A=6\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)R^{2}=3R^{2}.     And, if r is the radius of the inscribed circle,     A   A   \displaystyle A     A simple formula for area (given the two measurements) is     A   =   3  a  d       A    3  a  d     \scriptstyle A\,=\,3ad   where d is the distance between parallel sides.  Length d is the height of the dodecagon when it sits on a side as base, and the diameter of the inscribed circle.  By simple trigonometry,     d   =   a   (    1   +   2  c  o  s    30  ∘     +   2  c  o  s   60  ∘     )        d    a    1    2  c  o  s   superscript  30       2  c  o  s   superscript  60         \scriptstyle d\,=\,a(1\,+\,2cos{30^{\circ}}\,+\,2cos{60^{\circ}})   .  The perimeter for an inscribed dodecagon of radius 1 is 12√(2 - √3), or approximately 6.21165708246. 2  The perimeter for a circumscribed dodecagon of radius 1 is 24(2 – √3), or approximately 6.43078061835. Interestingly, this is double the value of the area of the inscribed dodecagon of radius 1.

Uses  A regular dodecagon can fill a plane vertex with other regular polygons:      3.12.12   4.6.12   3.3.4.12   3.4.3.12     Dodecagon construction  A regular dodecagon is constructible using compass and straightedge :  Construction of a regular dodecagon  Dissection      A regular dodecagon can be dissected into a central hexagon, and alternating triangles and squares   Regular dodecagon made with pattern blocks     One of the ways the mathematical manipulative  pattern blocks are used is in creating a number of different dodecagons. 3  Occurrence  Tiling  Here are 3 example periodic plane tilings that use dodecagons:       Semiregular tiling 3.12.12    Semiregular tiling: 4.6.12   A demiregular tiling : 3.3.4.12 & 3.3.3.3.3.3     Related figures  A dodecagram is a 12-sided star polygon, represented by symbol {12/n}. There is one regular star polygon : {12/5}, using the same vertices, but connecting every fifth point. There are also three compounds: {12/2} is reduced to 2{6} as two hexagons , and {12/3} is reduced to 3{4} as three squares , {12/4} is reduced to 4{3} as four triangles, and {12/6} is reduced to 6{2} as six degenerate digons .      n   1   2   3   4   5   6       Form   Polygon   Compounds   Star polygon   Compound     Image   {12/1} = {12}   {12/2} or 2{6}   {12/3} or 3{4}   {12/4} or 4{3}   {12/5}   {12/6} or 6{2}     Deeper truncations of the regular dodecagon and dodecagrams can produce isogonal ( vertex-transitive ) intermediate star polygon forms with equal spaced vertices and two edge lengths. A truncated hexagon is a dodecagon, t{6}={12}. A quasitruncated hexagon, inverted as {6/5}, is a dodecagram: t{6/5}={12/5}. 4      Vertex-transitive truncations of the hexagon   Quasiregular   Isogonal   Quasiregular     t{6}={12}  (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_6_2.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_6_3.svg    t{6/5}={12/5}     Petrie polygons  The regular dodecagon is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, seen as orthogonal projections in Coxeter planes , including:      E 6   F 4   2G 2 (4D)        2 21    1 22    24-cell     A 11   D 7   B 6      11-simplex    (4 11 )    1 41     It is also the Petrie polygon for the grand 120-cell and great stellated 120-cell .  Examples in use  In block capitals , the letters E , H and X (and I in a slab serif font) have dodecagonal outlines.  The regular dodecagon features prominently in many buildings. The Torre del Oro is a dodecagonal military watchtower in Seville , southern Spain , built by the Almohad dynasty . The early thirteenth century Vera Cruz church in Segovia , Spain is dodecagonal. Another example is the Porta di Venere (Venus' Gate), in Spello , Italy , built in the 1st century BC has two dodecagonal towers, called "Propertius' Towers".  Regular dodecagonal coins include:   British threepenny bit from 1937 to 1971, when it ceased to be legal tender.  British One Pound Coin to be introduced in 2017.  Australian 50-cent coin  Fijian 50 cents  Tongan 50-seniti , since 1974  Solomon Islands 50 cents  Croatian 25 kuna  Romanian 5000 lei , 2001–2005  Canadian penny , 1982–1996  South Vietnamese 25 đồng , 1968–1975  Zambian 50 ngwee , 1969–1992  Malawian 50 tambala , 1986–1995  Mexican 20 centavos , since 1992   See also   Dodecagonal number  Dodecahedron – a regular polyhedron with 12 pentagonal faces.
