   Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase      Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-methylbutanoyl-CoA + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA and acceptor , whereas its two products are 3-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include isovaleryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , isovaleroyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase , and 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
