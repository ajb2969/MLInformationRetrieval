   Sulfopyruvate decarboxylase      Sulfopyruvate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a sulfopyruvate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-sulfopyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-sulfoacetaldehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-sulfopyruvate , and two products , 2-sulfoacetaldehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-sulfopyruvate carboxy-lyase (2-sulfoacetaldehyde-forming) . This enzyme is also called sulfopyruvate carboxy-lyase .
