Rodion Kuzmin

Rodion Osievich Kuzmin (, Nov. 9, 1891, Riabye village in the Haradok district – March 23, 1949, Leningrad) was a Russian mathematician, known for his works in number theory and analysis.1 His name is sometimes transliterated as Kusmin.
Selected results

In 1928, Kuzmin solved2 the following problem due to Gauss (see Gauss–Kuzmin distribution): if x is a random number chosen uniformly in (0, 1), and








is its continued fraction expansion, find a bound for
 
 



where
 
 



Gauss showed that Δn tends to zero as n goes to infinity, however, he was unable to give an explicit bound. Kuzmin showed that
 
 



where C,α > 0 are numerical constants. In 1929, the bound was improved to C 0.7n by Paul Lévy.
 


In 1930, Kuzmin proved3 that numbers of the form ab, where a is algebraic and b is a real quadratic irrational, are transcendental. In particular, this result implies that Gelfond–Schneider constant








is transcendental. See Gelfond–Schneider theorem for later developments.
 


He is also known for the Kusmin-Landau inequality: If 
 
 
 
  is continuously differentiable with monotonic derivative 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Nearest integer function) on a finite interval 
 
 
 
 , then
