   Rodion Kuzmin      Rodion Kuzmin   Rodion Osievich Kuzmin (, Nov. 9, 1891, Riabye village in the Haradok district – March 23, 1949, Leningrad ) was a Russian  mathematician , known for his works in number theory and analysis . 1 His name is sometimes transliterated as Kusmin.  Selected results   In 1928, Kuzmin solved 2 the following problem due to Gauss (see Gauss–Kuzmin distribution ): if x is a random number chosen uniformly in (0, 1), and         x  =   1    k  1   +   1    k  2   +  ⋯          x    1     subscript  k  1     1     subscript  k  2   normal-⋯        x=\frac{1}{k_{1}+\frac{1}{k_{2}+\cdots}}       is its continued fraction expansion, find a bound for      Δ  n    (  s  )   =  ℙ   {   x  n   ≤  s  }   -   log  2    (  1  +  s  )   ,     fragments   subscript  normal-Δ  n    fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-{   subscript  x  n    s  normal-}     subscript   2    fragments  normal-(  1   s  normal-)   normal-,    \Delta_{n}(s)=\mathbb{P}\left\{x_{n}\leq s\right\}-\log_{2}(1+s),      where       x  n   =   1    k   n  +  1    +   1    k   n  +  2    +  ⋯       .       subscript  x  n     1     subscript  k    n  1      1     subscript  k    n  2    normal-⋯        x_{n}=\frac{1}{k_{n+1}+\frac{1}{k_{n+2}+\cdots}}.      Gauss showed that Δ n tends to zero as n goes to infinity, however, he was unable to give an explicit bound. Kuzmin showed that       |    Δ  n    (  s  )    |   ≤   C    e   -   α   n         ,           subscript  normal-Δ  n   s      C   superscript  e      α    n         |\Delta_{n}(s)|\leq Ce^{-\alpha\sqrt{n}}~{},      where C , α > 0 are numerical constants. In 1929, the bound was improved to C 0.7 n by Paul Lévy .    In 1930, Kuzmin proved 3 that numbers of the form a b , where a is algebraic and b is a real quadratic irrational , are transcendental . In particular, this result implies that Gelfond–Schneider constant          2   2    =   2.6651441426902251886502972498731  …        superscript  2    2      2.6651441426902251886502972498731  normal-…     2^{\sqrt{2}}=2.6651441426902251886502972498731\ldots       is transcendental. See Gelfond–Schneider theorem for later developments.    He is also known for the Kusmin-Landau inequality : If   f   f   f   is continuously differentiable with monotonic derivative    f  ′     superscript  f  normal-′    f^{\prime}   satisfying     ∥    f  ′    (  x  )    ∥   ≥  λ  >  0         norm     superscript  f  normal-′   x    λ       0     \|f^{\prime}(x)\|\geq\lambda>0   (where    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   denotes the Nearest integer function ) on a finite interval   I   I   I   , then            ∑   n  ∈  I     e   2  π  i  f   (  n  )      ≪   λ   -  1     .     much-less-than    subscript     n  I     superscript  e    2  π  i  f  n      superscript  λ    1      \sum_{n\in I}e^{2\pi if(n)}\ll\lambda^{-1}.
