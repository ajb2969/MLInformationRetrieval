Bethe–Slater curve: elements above the horizontal axis are ferromagnetic, below the axis are antiferromagnetic

Bethe–Slater curve is a graphical representation of exchange energy for transition metals as a function of the ratio of the interatomic distance a to the radius r of the 3d electron shell.1
The curve illustrates why certain metals are ferromagnetic and other antiferromagnetic.
For a pair of atoms, the exchange interaction wij (responsible for the energy E) is calculated as:2


where: J = exchange integral; S = electron spins; i and j = indices of the two atoms.
