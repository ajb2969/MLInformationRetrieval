   Siegel identity      Siegel identity   In mathematics , Siegel's identity refers to one of two formulae that are used in the resolution of Diophantine equations .  Statement  The first formula is          x  3   -   x  1      x  2   -   x  1     +     x  2   -   x  3      x  2   -   x  1      =  1.             subscript  x  3    subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1          subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1      1.    \frac{x_{3}-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}+\frac{x_{2}-x_{3}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}=1.     The second is           x  3   -   x  1      x  2   -   x  1     ⋅    t  -   x  2     t  -   x  3      +      x  2   -   x  3      x  2   -   x  1     ⋅    t  -   x  1     t  -   x  3       =  1.         normal-⋅       subscript  x  3    subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1         t   subscript  x  2      t   subscript  x  3       normal-⋅       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1         t   subscript  x  1      t   subscript  x  3       1.    \frac{x_{3}-x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\cdot\frac{t-x_{2}}{t-x_{3}}+\frac{x_{2}-x_{3}}%
 {x_{2}-x_{1}}\cdot\frac{t-x_{1}}{t-x_{3}}=1.     Application  The identities are used in translating Diophantine problems connected with integral points on hyperelliptic curves into S-unit equations .
