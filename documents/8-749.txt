   Antiderivative (complex analysis)      Antiderivative (complex analysis)   In complex analysis , a branch of mathematics , the antiderivative , or primitive , of a complex -valued function  g is a function whose complex derivative is g . More precisely, given an open set    U   U   U   in the complex plane and a function     g  :   U  →  ℂ    ,     normal-:  g   normal-→  U  ℂ     g:U\to\mathbb{C},   the antiderivative of   g   g   g   is a function    f  :   U  →  ℂ      normal-:  f   normal-→  U  ℂ     f:U\to\mathbb{C}   that satisfies      d  f    d  z    =  g          d  f     d  z    g    \frac{df}{dz}=g   .  As such, this concept is the complex-variable version of the antiderivative of a real -valued function.  Uniqueness  The derivative of a constant function is zero. Therefore, any constant is an antiderivative of the zero function. If   U   U   U   is a connected set , then the constants are the only antiderivatives of the zero function. Otherwise, a function is an antiderivative of the zero function if and only if it is constant on each connected component of   U   U   U   (those constants need not be equal).  This observation implies that if a function    g  :   U  →  ℂ      normal-:  g   normal-→  U  ℂ     g:U\to\mathbb{C}   has an antiderivative, then that antiderivative is unique up to addition of a function which is constant on each connected component of   U   U   U   .  Existence  One can characterize the existence of antiderivatives via path integrals in the complex plane, much like the case of functions of a real variable. Perhaps not surprisingly, g has an antiderivative f if and only if, for every γ path from a to b , the path integral         ∫  γ    g   (  ζ  )   d  ζ    =    f   (  b  )    -   f   (  a  )      .        subscript   γ     g  ζ  d  ζ        f  b     f  a      \int_{\gamma}g(\zeta)d\zeta=f(b)-f(a).     Equivalently,         ∮  γ    g   (  ζ  )   d  ζ    =  0   ,        subscript  contour-integral  γ     g  ζ  d  ζ    0    \oint_{\gamma}g(\zeta)d\zeta=0,     for any closed path γ.  However, this formal similarity notwithstanding, possessing a complex-antiderivative is a much more restrictive condition than its real counterpart. While it is possible for a discontinuous real function to have an anti-derivative, anti-derivatives can fail to exist even for holomorphic functions of a complex variable. For example, consider the reciprocal function, g ( z ) = 1/ z which is holomorphic on the punctured plane C \{0}. A direct calculation shows that the integral of g along any circle enclosing the origin is non-zero. So g fails the condition cited above. This is similar to the existence of potential functions for conservative vector fields , in that Green's theorem is only able to guarantee path independence when the function in question is defined on a simply connected region, as in the case of the Cauchy integral theorem .  In fact, holomorphy is characterized by having an antiderivative locally , that is, g is holomorphic if for every z in its domain, there is some neighborhood U of z such that g has an antiderivative on U . Furthermore, holomorphy is a necessary condition for a function to have an antiderivative, since the derivative of any holomorphic function is holomorphic.  Various versions of Cauchy integral theorem , an underpinning result of Cauchy function theory, which makes heavy use of path integrals, gives sufficient conditions under which, for a holomorphic g ,       ∮  γ    g   (  ζ  )   d  ζ       subscript  contour-integral  γ     g  ζ  d  ζ     \oint_{\gamma}g(\zeta)d\zeta     vanishes for any closed path γ (which may be, for instance, that the domain of g be simply connected or star-convex).  Necessity  First we show that if f is an antiderivative of g on U , then g has the path integral property given above. Given any piecewise C 1  path γ : [ a , b ] → U , one can express the path integral of g over γ as         ∫  γ    g   (  z  )   d  z    =    ∫  a  b    g   (   γ   (  t  )    )    γ  ′    (  t  )   d  t    =    ∫  a  b     f  ′    (   γ   (  t  )    )    γ  ′    (  t  )   d  t     .          subscript   γ     g  z  d  z      superscript   subscript   a   b     g    γ  t    superscript  γ  normal-′   t  d  t           superscript   subscript   a   b      superscript  f  normal-′     γ  t    superscript  γ  normal-′   t  d  t       \int_{\gamma}g(z)\,dz=\int_{a}^{b}g(\gamma(t))\gamma^{\prime}(t)\,dt=\int_{a}^%
 {b}f^{\prime}(\gamma(t))\gamma^{\prime}(t)\,dt.     By the chain rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus one then has         ∫  γ    g   (  z  )   d  z    =    ∫  a  b     d   d  t    f   (   γ   (  t  )    )   d  t    =    f   (   γ   (  b  )    )    -   f   (   γ   (  a  )    )      .          subscript   γ     g  z  d  z      superscript   subscript   a   b       d    d  t    f    γ  t   d  t             f    γ  b      f    γ  a        \int_{\gamma}g(z)\,dz=\int_{a}^{b}\frac{d}{dt}f\left(\gamma(t)\right)\,dt=f%
 \left(\gamma(b)\right)-f\left(\gamma(a)\right).     Therefore the integral of g over γ does not depend on the actual path γ, but only on its endpoints, which is what we wanted to show.  Sufficiency  Next we show that if g is holomorphic, and the integral of g over any path depends only on the endpoints, then g has an antiderivative. We will do so by finding an anti-derivative explicitly.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that the domain U of g is connected, as otherwise one can prove the existence of an antiderivative on each connected component. With this assumption, fix a point z 0 in U and for any z in U define the function       f   (  z  )    =     ∫  γ     g   (  ζ  )   d  ζ          f  z     subscript   γ     g  ζ  d  ζ      f(z)=\int_{\gamma}\!g(\zeta)\,d\zeta     where γ is any path joining z 0 to z . Such a path exists since U is assumed to be an open connected set. The function f is well-defined because the integral depends only on the endpoints of γ.  That this f is an antiderivative of g can be argued in the same way as the real case. We have, for a given z in U ,      |       f   (  w  )    -   f   (  z  )      w  -  z     -   g   (  z  )     |              f  w     f  z      w  z      g  z      \displaystyle\left|\frac{f(w)-f(z)}{w-z}-g(z)\right|     where [ z , w ] denotes the line segment between z and w . By continuity of g , the final expression goes to zero as w approaches z . In other words, f′ = g .  References      External links     Fundamental Theorems of Integration by John H.
