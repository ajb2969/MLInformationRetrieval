   K-ary tree      K-ary tree   In graph theory , a k-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than k children. It is also sometimes known as a k-way tree , an N-ary tree , or an M-ary tree . A binary tree is the special case where k=2 .  Types of k-ary trees   A full k-ary tree is a k-ary tree where within each level every node has either 0 or k children.  A perfect k-ary tree is a full 1 k-ary tree in which all leaf nodes are at the same depth. 2  A complete k-ary tree is a k-ary tree which is maximally space efficient. It must be completely filled on every level (meaning that each node on that level has k children) except for the last level. However, if the last level is not complete, then all nodes of the tree must be "as far left as possible". 3   Properties of k-ary trees   For a k-ary tree with height h , the upper bound for the maximum number of leaves is    k  h     superscript  k  h    k^{h}   .  The height ''h ''of a k-ary tree does not include the root node, with a tree containing only a root node having a height of 0.  The total number of nodes in a perfect  k-ary tree is    ⌊     k   h  +  1    -  1    k  -  1    ⌋           superscript  k    h  1    1     k  1      \left\lfloor\frac{k^{h+1}-1}{k-1}\right\rfloor   , while the height h is        ⌈      log  k    (   k  -  1   )    +    log  k    (   𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  _  𝑜𝑓  _  𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠   )     -  1   ⌉   .            subscript   k     k  1      subscript   k     𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟  normal-_  𝑜𝑓  normal-_  𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠     1     \left\lceil\log_{k}(k-1)+\log_{k}(\mathit{number\_of\_nodes})-1\right\rceil.     Note : A Tree containing only one node is taken to be of height 0 for this formula to be applicable.  Note : Formula is not applicable for a 2-ary tree with height 0, as the ceiling operator approximates and simplifies the true formula, which can be described as          log  k    [      (   k  -  1   )   *  𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟   _  𝑜𝑓  _  𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠   +  1   ]    -  1   ,  k   ≥  2.           subscript   k           k  1   𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟   normal-_  𝑜𝑓  normal-_  𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠   1    1   k   2.    \log_{k}[(k-1)*\mathit{number\_of\_nodes}+1]-1,k\geq 2.     Methods for storing k-ary trees  Arrays  k-ary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an implicit data structure in arrays , and if the tree is a complete k-ary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index i , its c -th child is found at index     k  *  i   +  1  +  c        k  i   1  c    k*i+1+c   , while its parent (if any) is found at index     ⌊    i  -  1   k   ⌋          i  1   k     \left\lfloor\frac{i-1}{k}\right\rfloor    (assuming the root has index zero). This method benefits from more compact storage and better locality of reference , particularly during a preorder traversal.
