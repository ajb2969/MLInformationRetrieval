ADP-dependent NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase

ADP-dependent NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase (, (6S)-beta-6-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide hydro-lyase (ADP-hydrolysing), (6S)-6-beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide hydro-lyase (ADP-hydrolysing, NADH-forming)) is an enzyme with system name (6S)-6beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide hydro-lyase (ADP-hydrolysing; NADH-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) ADP + (6S)-6beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 
 
 
 
  AMP + phosphate + NADH
 
(2) ADP + (6S)-6beta-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
 
 
 
  AMP + phosphate + NADPH
 

This enzyme acts equally well on hydrated NADH and hydrated NADPH.
