In mathematics a divisor of an integer

 
 , also called a factor of 
 
 
 
 , is an integer that can be multiplied by some other integer to produce 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
Two versions of the definition of a divisor are commonplace:

For integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , it is said that 
 
 
divides

 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a divisor of 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
  is a multiple of 
 
 
 
 , and this is written as
 
 




if there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .1 Under this definition, the statement 
 
 
 
  holds.
 


As before, but with the additional constraint 
 
 
 
 .2 Under this definition, the statement 
 
 
 
  does not hold.

In the remainder of this article, which definition is applied is indicated where this is significant.
General
Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although sometimes the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.
1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself.3 Every integer is a divisor of 0.4 Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd.
1, −1, n and −n are known as the trivial divisors of n. A divisor of n that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor. A non-zero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units −1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.
There are divisibility rules which allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits.
The generalization can be said to be the concept of divisibility in any integral domain.

7 is a divisor of 42 because 
 
 
 
 , so we can say 
 
 
 
 . It can also be said that 42 is divisible by 7, 42 is a multiple of 7, 7 divides 42, or 7 is a factor of 42.
The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, −2, 3, −3.
The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

The set of all positive divisors of 60, 
 
 
 
 , partially ordered by divisibility, has the Hasse diagram:

Further notions and facts
There are some elementary rules:

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 , i.e. divisibility is a transitive relation.
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  holds, as does 
 
 
 
 .5 However, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  does not always hold (e.g. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  but 5 does not divide 6).

If 
 
 
 
 , and gcd

 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . This is called Euclid's lemma.
If 
 
 
 
  is a prime number and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
A positive divisor of 
 
 
 
  which is different from 
 
 
 
  is called a proper divisor or an aliquot part of 
 
 
 
 . A number that does not evenly divide 
 
 
 
  but leaves a remainder is called an aliquant part of 
 
 
 
 .
An integer 
 
 
 
  whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a prime number. Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer which has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself.
Any positive divisor of 
 
 
 
  is a product of prime divisors of 
 
 
 
  raised to some power. This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
A number 
 
 
 
  is said to be perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than 
 
 
 
 , and abundant if this sum exceeds 
 
 
 
 .
The total number of positive divisors of 
 
 
 
  is a multiplicative function

 
 , meaning that when two numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime, then 
 
 
 
 . For instance, 
 
 
 
 ; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  share a common divisor, then it might not be true that 
 
 
 
 . The sum of the positive divisors of 
 
 
 
  is another multiplicative function 
 
 
 
  (e.g. 
 
 
 
 ). Both of these functions are examples of divisor functions.
If the prime factorization of 
 
 
 
  is given by



then the number of positive divisors of 
 
 
 
  is


 
  and each of the divisors has the form



where 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 

For every natural 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Also,6


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is Euler–Mascheroni constant. One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer n has an expected number of divisors of about 
 
 
 
 .
In abstract algebra
Given the definition for which 
 
 
 
  holds, the relation of divisibility turns the set 
 
 
 
  of non-negative integers into a partially ordered set: a complete distributive lattice. The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation ∧ is given by the greatest common divisor and the join operation ∨ by the least common multiple. This lattice is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group
