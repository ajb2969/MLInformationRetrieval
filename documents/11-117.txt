Phytanate—CoA ligase




Phytanate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a phytanate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + phytanate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + phytanoyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, phytanate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and phytanoyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phytanate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme is also called phytanoyl-CoA ligase.
