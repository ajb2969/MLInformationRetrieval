   Georgi–Glashow model      Georgi–Glashow model   (Figure)  The pattern of weak isospins , weak hypercharges , and strong charges for particles in the Georgi-Glashow model, rotated by the predicted weak mixing angle , showing electric charge roughly along the vertical. In addition to Standard Model particles, the theory includes twelve colored X bosons, responsible for proton decay .   In particle physics , the Georgi–Glashow model is a particular grand unification theory (GUT) proposed by Howard Georgi and Sheldon Glashow in 1974. In this model the standard model gauge groups SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) are combined into a single simple gauge group— SU(5) . The unified group SU(5) is then thought to be spontaneously broken to the standard model subgroup at some high energy scale called the grand unification scale .  Since the Georgi–Glashow model combines leptons and quarks into single irreducible representations , there exist interactions which do not conserve baryon number, although they still conserve B-L . This yields a mechanism for proton decay , and the rate of proton decay can be predicted from the dynamics of the model. However, proton decay has not yet been observed experimentally, and the resulting lower limit on the lifetime of the proton contradicts the predictions of this model. However, the elegance of the model has led particle physicists to use it as the foundation for more complex models which yield longer proton lifetimes.  (For a more elementary introduction to how the representation theory of Lie algebras are related to particle physics, see the article Particle physics and representation theory .)  This model suffers from the doublet-triplet splitting problem .  Breaking SU(5)  SU(5) breaking occurs when a scalar field , analogous to the Higgs field , and transforming in the adjoint of SU(5) acquires a vacuum expectation value proportional to the weak hypercharge generator       Y  2   =   diag   (   -   1  /  3    ,   -   1  /  3    ,   -   1  /  3    ,   1  /  2   ,   1  /  2   )          Y  2    diag      1  3        1  3        1  3      1  2     1  2      \frac{Y}{2}=\operatorname{diag}\left(-1/3,-1/3,-1/3,1/2,1/2\right)   When this occurs SU(5) is spontaneously broken to the subgroup of SU(5) commuting with the group generated by Y . This unbroken subgroup is just the standard model group     [       S  U   (  3  )    ×  S   U   (  2  )    ×  U     (  1  )   Y    ]   /   ℤ  6        delimited-[]            S  U  3   S   U  2   U    subscript  1  Y      subscript  ℤ  6     [SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)_{Y}]/\mathbb{Z}_{6}   .  Under the unbroken subgroup the adjoint 24 transforms as      24  →     (  8  ,  1  )   0   ⊕    (  1  ,  3  )   0   ⊕    (  1  ,  1  )   0   ⊕    (  3  ,  2  )    -   5  6     ⊕    (   3  ¯   ,  2  )    5  6        normal-→  24   direct-sum   subscript   8  1   0    subscript   1  3   0    subscript   1  1   0    subscript   3  2       5  6      subscript    normal-¯  3   2     5  6       24\rightarrow(8,1)_{0}\oplus(1,3)_{0}\oplus(1,1)_{0}\oplus(3,2)_{-\frac{5}{6}}%

Note that fermions transforming as a 1 under SU(5) are now thought to be necessary because of the evidence for neutrino oscillations . Actually though, it is possible for there to be only left-handed neutrinos without any right-handed neutrinos if we could somehow introduce a tiny Majorana coupling for the left-handed neutrinos.

 \end{matrix}     The first column is an Abbreviation of the second column (neglecting proper normalization factors), where capital indices are SU(5) indices, and i and j are the generation indices.  The last two rows presupposes the multiplicity of N c is not zero (i.e. that a sterile neutrino exists). The coupling H u 10 i 10 j has coefficients which are symmetric in i and j. The coupling N c i N c j has coefficients which are symmetric in i and j. Note that the number of sterile neutrino  generations need not be three, unless the SU(5) is embedded in a higher unification scheme such as SO(10) .  Vacua  The vacua correspond to the mutual zeros of the F and D terms. Let's first look at the case where the VEVs of all the chiral fields are zero except for Φ.  The Φ sector      W  =   T  r   [    a   Φ  2    +   b   Φ  3     ]        W    T  r   delimited-[]      a   superscript  normal-Φ  2      b   superscript  normal-Φ  3         W=Tr[a\Phi^{2}+b\Phi^{3}]     The F zeros corresponds to finding the stationary points of W subject to the traceless constraint     T  r   [  Φ  ]    =  0        T  r   delimited-[]  normal-Φ    0    Tr[\Phi]=0   . So,      2  a  Φ   +   3  b   Φ  2     =   λ  𝟏           2  a  normal-Φ     3  b   superscript  normal-Φ  2       λ  1     2a\Phi+3b\Phi^{2}=\lambda\mathbf{1}   where λ is a Lagrange multiplier.  Up to an SU(5) (unitary) transformation,      Φ  =   {      diag   (  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )         diag   (    2  a    9  b    ,    2  a    9  b    ,    2  a    9  b    ,    2  a    9  b    ,   -    8  a    9  b     )         diag   (    4  a    3  b    ,    4  a    3  b    ,    4  a    3  b    ,   -    2  a   b    ,   -    2  a   b    )           fragments  Φ    fragments  normal-{     diag  0  0  0  0  0      diag      2  a     9  b        2  a     9  b        2  a     9  b        2  a     9  b          8  a     9  b         diag      4  a     3  b        4  a     3  b        4  a     3  b          2  a   b          2  a   b          \Phi=\left\{\begin{matrix}\operatorname{diag}(0,0,0,0,0)\\

 \operatorname{diag}(\frac{4a}{3b},\frac{4a}{3b},\frac{4a}{3b},-\frac{2a}{b},-%
 \frac{2a}{b})\end{matrix}\right.     The three cases are called case I, II and III and they break the gauge symmetry into SU(5),     [     S  U   (  4  )    ×  U    (  1  )    ]   /   ℤ  4        delimited-[]        S  U  4   U   1     subscript  ℤ  4     [SU(4)\times U(1)]/\mathbb{Z}_{4}   and     [       S  U   (  3  )    ×  S   U   (  2  )    ×  U    (  1  )    ]   /   ℤ  6        delimited-[]            S  U  3   S   U  2   U   1     subscript  ℤ  6     [SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)]/\mathbb{Z}_{6}   respectively (the stabilizer of the VEV).  In other words, there at least three different superselection sections, which is typical for supersymmetric theories.  Only case III makes any phenomenological sense and so, we will focus on this case from now onwards.  It can be verified that this solution together with zero VEVs for all the other chiral multiplets is a zero of the F-terms and D-terms . The matter parity remains unbroken (right up to the TeV scale).  Decomposition  The gauge algebra 24 decomposes as    (       (  8  ,  1  )   0         (  1  ,  3  )   0         (  1  ,  1  )   0         (  3  ,  2  )    -   5  6           (   3  ¯   ,  2  )    5  6       )       subscript   8  1   0      subscript   1  3   0      subscript   1  1   0      subscript   3  2       5  6        subscript    normal-¯  3   2     5  6       \begin{pmatrix}(8,1)_{0}\\
 (1,3)_{0}\\
 (1,1)_{0}\\
 (3,2)_{-\frac{5}{6}}\\
 (\bar{3},2)_{\frac{5}{6}}\end{pmatrix}   . This 24 is a real representation, so the last two terms need explanation. Both     (  3  ,  2  )    -   5  6       subscript   3  2       5  6      (3,2)_{-\frac{5}{6}}   and     (   3  ¯   ,  2  )    5  6      subscript    normal-¯  3   2     5  6     (\bar{3},2)_{\frac{5}{6}}   are complex representations. However, the direct sum of both representation decomposes into two irreducible real representations and we only take half of the direct sum, i.e. one of the two real irreducible copies. The first three components are left unbroken. The adjoint Higgs also has a similar decomposition, except that it is complex. The Higgs mechanism causes one real HALF of the     (  3  ,  2  )    -   5  6       subscript   3  2       5  6      (3,2)_{-\frac{5}{6}}   and     (   3  ¯   ,  2  )    5  6      subscript    normal-¯  3   2     5  6     (\bar{3},2)_{\frac{5}{6}}   of the adjoint Higgs to be absorbed. The other real half acquires a mass coming from the D-terms . And the other three components of the adjoint Higgs,     (  8  ,  1  )   0     subscript   8  1   0    (8,1)_{0}   ,     (  1  ,  3  )   0     subscript   1  3   0    (1,3)_{0}   and     (  1  ,  1  )   0     subscript   1  1   0    (1,1)_{0}   acquire GUT scale masses coming from self pairings of the superpotential, aΦ 2 +bΦ 2 .  The sterile neutrinos, if any exists, would also acquire a GUT scale Majorana mass coming from the superpotential coupling ν c2 .  Because of matter parity, the matter representations    5  ¯     normal-¯  5    \bar{5}   and 10 remain chiral.  It's the Higgs fields 5 H and     5  ¯   H     subscript   normal-¯  5   H    \bar{5}_{H}   which are interesting.          5  H     subscript  5  H    5_{H}            5  ¯   H     subscript   normal-¯  5   H    \bar{5}_{H}            (       (  3  ,  1  )    -   1  3           (  1  ,  2  )    1  2       )       subscript   3  1       1  3        subscript   1  2     1  2       \begin{pmatrix}(3,1)_{-\frac{1}{3}}\\

 (1,2)_{-\frac{1}{2}}\end{pmatrix}        The two relevant superpotential terms here are     5  H     5  ¯   H        subscript  5  H    subscript   normal-¯  5   H     5_{H}\bar{5}_{H}   and 5_H \bar{5}_H. Unless there happens to be some fine tuning , we would expect both the triplet terms and the doublet terms to pair up, leaving us with no light electroweak doublets. This is in complete disagreement with phenomenology. See doublet-triplet splitting problem for more details.  Fermion masses  Lee Smolin's view of SU(5)  In his book The Trouble with Physics , Smolin states:  Popular culture  When the filmmaker Sandy Bates (played by Woody Allen ) in the 1980 Woody Allen film Stardust Memories launches a depressive soliloquy with the quote, "Did anybody read on the front page of The Times that matter is decaying?", this was almost certainly a reference to the Georgi–Glashow model, given the film's period, the importance of the Georgi–Glashow model at the time and the many contemporary layperson articles in circulation about some of the model's most striking consequences, particularly its mechanism for proton decay. An actual New York Times article appeared two years later, 1 fulfilling Allen's blackly humorous foreshadowing of a world whose news was so baleful that the mainstream media were systematically reporting its material demise.
