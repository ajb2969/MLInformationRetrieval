   Graham number      Graham number   The Graham number or Benjamin Graham number is a figure used in securities investing that measures a stock 's so-called fair value. 1 Named after Benjamin Graham , the founder of value investing , the Graham number can be calculated as follows:       22.5  ×   (  earnings per share  )   ×   (  book value per share  )          22.5  earnings per share  book value per share     \sqrt{22.5\times(\text{earnings per share})\times(\text{book value per share})}     The final number is, theoretically, the maximum price that a defensive investor should pay for the given stock. Put another way, a stock priced below the Graham Number would be considered a good value, if it also meets a number of other criteria.  Graham writes: 2   Alternative calculation  Earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by shares outstanding . Book value is another way of saying shareholders' equity . Therefore, book value per share is calculated by dividing equity by shares outstanding . Consequently, the formula for the Graham number can also be written as follows:       15  ×  1.5  ×   (   net income  shares outstanding   )   ×   (      shareholders  ′    equity   shares outstanding   )          15  1.5    net income  shares outstanding        superscript  shareholders  normal-′   equity   shares outstanding      \sqrt{15\times 1.5\times\left(\frac{\text{net income}}{\text{shares %
 outstanding}}\right)\times\left(\frac{\mathrm{shareholders^{\prime}\ equity}}{%
 \text{shares outstanding}}\right)}     References  "  Category:Valuation (finance)  Category:Mathematical finance     Investopedia: Definition of 'Graham Number' ↩  ↩
