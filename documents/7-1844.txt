   Inverse beta decay      Inverse beta decay    Inverse beta decay is a somewhat vague term referring to one of several processes related to beta decay .  Inverse beta decay originally referred to the process       ν  ¯   e   +  p   →    e  +   +  n      normal-→     subscript   normal-¯  ν   e   p      superscript  e    n     \bar{\nu}_{e}+p\to e^{+}+n   ,  ( electron antineutrino  scattering off a proton into a positron and a neutron ) in which the existence of the antineutrino was decisively verified in the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment . Understanding this process is important to our understanding of the mechanism of a supernova explosion.  Inverse beta decay may also sometimes refer to the process      e  -   +  p   →    ν  e   +  n      normal-→     superscript  e    p      subscript  ν  e   n     e^{-}+p\to\nu_{e}+n   normally called electron capture .
