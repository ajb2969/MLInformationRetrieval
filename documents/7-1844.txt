Inverse beta decay

 Inverse beta decay is a somewhat vague term referring to one of several processes related to beta decay.
Inverse beta decay originally referred to the process 
 
 
 
  ,
(electron antineutrino scattering off a proton into a positron and a neutron) in which the existence of the antineutrino was decisively verified in the Cowanâ€“Reines neutrino experiment. Understanding this process is important to our understanding of the mechanism of a supernova explosion.
Inverse beta decay may also sometimes refer to the process 
 
 
 
  normally called electron capture.
