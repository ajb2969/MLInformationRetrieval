   Beilinson regulator      Beilinson regulator   In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry , the Beilinson regulator is the Chern class map from algebraic K-theory to Deligne cohomology :         K  n    (  X  )    →    ⊕   p  ≥  0      H  D    2  p   -  n     (  X  ,   𝐐   (  p  )    )      .     normal-→     subscript  K  n   X     subscript  direct-sum    p  0       superscript   subscript  H  D       2  p   n     X    𝐐  p        K_{n}(X)\rightarrow\oplus_{p\geq 0}H_{D}^{2p-n}(X,\mathbf{Q}(p)).     Here, X is a complex smooth projective variety , for example. It is named after Alexander Beilinson . The Beilinson regulator features in Beilinson's conjecture on special values of L-functions .

 \sigma(x)|)_{\sigma}     is a particular case of the Beilinson regulator. (As usual,    σ  :   F  ⊂  𝐂      normal-:  σ    F  𝐂     \sigma:F\subset\mathbf{C}   runs over all complex embeddings of F , where conjugate embeddings are considered equivalent.) Up to a factor 2, the Beilinson regulator is also generalization of the Borel regulator .  References     "  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Algebraic K-theory
