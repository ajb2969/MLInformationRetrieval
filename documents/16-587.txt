Format of math-tag: \int_a^b \! f(x)\,dx \,      The default is an integral for f(x) , from a to b . The amount of indentation can be reset by "indent=0" (a count of spaces). Examples:  :::*  →  :::*  →  When displaying the integral, there might be a delay as the math-tag is being formatted into the requested symbols. A re-display of a prior, common formula will be slightly faster than showing a new formula.  This template demonstrates the use of the #tag-function to allow generation of a math-tag based on various parameters passed into a template.
