   Body Shape Index      Body Shape Index   Body Shape Index ( BSI ) is a metric for assessing the health implications of a given human body height, mass and waist circumference. The inclusion of the latter is believed to make the BSI a better indicator of the health risks from excess weight than the standard Body Mass Index . 1 2  According to the original article the formula for calculating aBSI is     A  B  S  I   =    W  C      B  M   I   2  3     ×  H   e  i  g  h   t   1  2            A  B  S  I       W  C         B  M   superscript  I    2  3     H   e  i  g  h   superscript  t    1  2        ABSI={WC\over{BMI^{2\over 3}\times Height^{1\over 2}}}     Here WC (Waist circumference) and Height are measured in meters.
