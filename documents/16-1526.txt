Interpolative decomposition




Interpolative decomposition

In numerical analysis interpolative decomposition (ID) factors a matrix as the product of two matrices, one of which contains selected columns from the original matrix, and the other has a subset of columns that consists the identity matrix and all its values are not larger than 2 in absolute value.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
  with rank

 
 . than 
 
 
 
  can be written as:


 
  where:



 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
  indices from 
 
 

The 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  represents the 
 
 
 
 's columns of 
 
 



 
  is a 
 
 
 
  matrix that all its values are less than 2 in magnitude. 
 
 
 
  has a 
 
 
 
  identity sub-matrix.

Note that similar decomposition can be done using the rows of 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  be the 
 
 
 
  matrix of rank 2: 
 
 

Then
