   Majorana equation      Majorana equation   The Majorana equation is a relativistic wave equation similar to the Dirac equation but includes the charge conjugate ψ c of a spinor ψ. It is named after the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana , and it is        -    i  ∂   /  ψ    +   m   ψ  c     =   0   (  1  )                i    ψ      m   subscript  ψ  c      0  1     -i{\partial\!\!\!\big/}\psi+m\psi_{c}=0\qquad\qquad(1)   with the derivative operator    ∂  /     fragments      {\partial\!\!\!\big/}   written in Feynman slash notation to include the gamma matrices as well as a summation over the spinor components. In this equation ψ c is the charge conjugate of ψ, which can be defined in the Majorana basis as        ψ  c   :=   i   ψ  *     .     assign   subscript  ψ  c     i   superscript  ψ       \psi_{c}:=i\psi^{*}.   Equation (1) can alternatively be expressed as         i  ∂   /   ψ  c    +   m  ψ    =   0   (  2  )              i     subscript  ψ  c      m  ψ     0  2     i{\partial\!\!\!\big/}\psi_{c}+m\psi=0\qquad\qquad(2)   . In either case, the quantity   m   m   m   in the equation is called the Majorana mass .  The appearance of both ψ and ψ c in the Majorana equation means that the field ψ cannot be coupled to an electromagnetic field without violating charge conservation , so ψ is taken to be neutrally charged. Nonetheless, the quanta of the Majorana equation given here are two particle species, a neutral particle and its neutral antiparticle . The Majorana equation is frequently supplemented by the condition that (in which case one says that ψ is a Majorana spinor ); this results in a single neutral particle. For a Majorana spinor, the Majorana equation is equivalent to the Dirac equation .  Particles corresponding to Majorana spinors are aptly called Majorana particles . Such a particle is its own antiparticle. Thus far, of all the fermions included in the Standard Model , none is a Majorana fermion. However, there is the possibility that the neutrino is of a Majorana nature. If so, neutrinoless double-beta decay , as well as a range of lepton-number violating meson and charged lepton decays, are possible. A number of experiments probing whether the neutrino is a Majorana particle are currently underway. 1  References    External links   Majorana Legacy in Contemporary Physics  Majorana returns   "  Category:Quantum field theory  Category:Spinors  Category:Equations     A.
