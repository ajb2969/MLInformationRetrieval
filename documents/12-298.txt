   Hawking energy      Hawking energy   The Hawking energy or Hawking mass is one of the possible definitions of mass in general relativity . It is a measure of the bending of ingoing and outgoing rays of light that are orthogonal to a 2- sphere surrounding the region of space whose mass is to be defined.  Definition  Let    (   ℳ  3   ,   g   a  b    )      superscript  ℳ  3    subscript  g    a  b      (\mathcal{M}^{3},g_{ab})   be a 3-dimensional sub-manifold of a relativistic spacetime, and let    Σ  ⊂   ℳ  3       normal-Σ   superscript  ℳ  3     \Sigma\subset\mathcal{M}^{3}   be a closed 2-surface. Then the Hawking mass     m  H    (  Σ  )        subscript  m  H   normal-Σ    m_{H}(\Sigma)   of   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is defined 1 to be         m  H    (  Σ  )    :=       Area   Σ    16  π      (   1  -    1   16  π      ∫  Σ     H  2   d  a      )     ,     assign     subscript  m  H   normal-Σ           Area  normal-Σ     16  π       1      1    16  π      subscript   normal-Σ      superscript  H  2   d  a         m_{H}(\Sigma):=\sqrt{\frac{\text{Area}\,\Sigma}{16\pi}}\left(1-\frac{1}{16\pi}%
 \int_{\Sigma}H^{2}da\right),     where   H   H   H   is the mean curvature of   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   .  Properties  In the Schwarzschild metric , the Hawking mass of any sphere    S  r     subscript  S  r    S_{r}   about the central mass is equal to the value   m   m   m   of the central mass.  A result of Geroch 2 implies that Hawking mass satisfies an important monotonicity condition. Namely, if    ℳ  3     superscript  ℳ  3    \mathcal{M}^{3}   has nonnegative scalar curvature, then the Hawking mass of   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is non-decreasing as the surface   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   flows outward at a speed equal to the inverse of the mean curvature. In particular, if    Σ  t     subscript  normal-Σ  t    \Sigma_{t}   is a family of connected surfaces evolving according to         d  x    d  t    =    1  H   ν   (  x  )     ,          d  x     d  t        1  H   ν  x     \frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{H}\nu(x),     where   H   H   H   is the mean curvature of    Σ  t     subscript  normal-Σ  t    \Sigma_{t}   and   ν   ν   \nu   is the unit vector opposite of the mean curvature direction, then        d   d  t     m  H    (   Σ  t   )    ≥  0.          d    d  t     subscript  m  H    subscript  normal-Σ  t    0.    \frac{d}{dt}m_{H}(\Sigma_{t})\geq 0.     Said otherwise, Hawking mass is increasing for the inverse mean curvature flow . 3  Hawking mass is not necessarily positive. However, it is asymptotic to the ADM 4 or the Bondi mass, depending on whether the surface is asymptotic to spatial infinity or null infinity. 5  See also   Mass in general relativity  Inverse mean curvature flow   References   Section 6.1 in   "  Category:General relativity     [ http://books.google.com/books?id=HRr3jdBDXIgC&pg; ;=PA122#v=onepage Page 21] of Schoen, Richard, 2005, "Mean Curvature in Riemannian Geometry and General Relativity," in Global Theory of Minimal Surfaces: Proceedings of the Clay Mathematics Institute 2001 Summer School , David Hoffman (Ed.), p.113-136. ↩  Geroch, Robert. 1973.
