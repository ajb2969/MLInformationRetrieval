   Hunter–Saxton equation      Hunter–Saxton equation   In mathematical physics , the Hunter–Saxton equation 1        (    u  t   +   u   u  x     )   x   =     1  2     u  x  2         subscript     subscript  u  t     u   subscript  u  x     x       1  2    superscript   subscript  u  x   2      (u_{t}+uu_{x})_{x}=\frac{1}{2}\,u_{x}^{2}     is an integrable  PDE that arises in the theoretical study of nematic liquid crystals . If the molecules in the liquid crystal are initially all aligned, and some of them are then wiggled slightly, this disturbance in orientation will propagate through the crystal, and the Hunter–Saxton equation describes certain aspects of such orientation waves .  Physical background  In the models for liquid crystals considered here, it is assumed that there is no fluid flow, so that only the orientation of the molecules is of interest. Within the elastic continuum theory , the orientation is described by a field of unit vectors n ( x , y , z , t ). For nematic liquid crystals, there is no difference between orienting a molecule in the n direction or in the − n direction, and the vector field n is then called a director field . The potential energy density of a director field is usually assumed to be given by the Oseen – Frank energy functional 2        W   (  𝐧  ,   ∇  𝐧   )    =    1  2    (    α    (   ∇  ⋅  𝐧   )   2    +   β    (   𝐧  ⋅   (   ∇  ×  𝐧   )    )   2    +   γ    |   𝐧  ×   (   ∇  ×  𝐧   )    |   2     )     ,        W   𝐧   normal-∇  𝐧         1  2       α   superscript   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐧   2      β   superscript   normal-⋅  𝐧    normal-∇  𝐧    2      γ   superscript      𝐧    normal-∇  𝐧     2        W(\mathbf{n},\nabla\mathbf{n})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{n})^%
 {2}+\beta(\mathbf{n}\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{n}))^{2}+\gamma|\mathbf{n}\times%
 (\nabla\times\mathbf{n})|^{2}\right),     where the positive coefficients   α   α   \alpha   ,   β   β   \beta   ,   γ   γ   \gamma   are known as the elastic coefficients of splay, twist, and bend, respectively. The kinetic energy is often neglected because of the high viscosity of liquid crystals.  Derivation of the Hunter–Saxton equation  Hunter and Saxton 3 investigated the case when viscous damping is ignored and a kinetic energy term is included in the model. Then the governing equations for the dynamics of the director field are the Euler–Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian       ℒ  =     1  2     |    ∂  𝐧    ∂  t    |   2    -   W   (  𝐧  ,   ∇  𝐧   )    -    λ  2    (   1  -    |  𝐧  |   2    )      ,      ℒ        1  2    superscript        𝐧     t     2      W   𝐧   normal-∇  𝐧         λ  2     1   superscript    𝐧   2        \mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{n}}{\partial t}\right|^{2}-%
 W(\mathbf{n},\nabla\mathbf{n})-\frac{\lambda}{2}(1-|\mathbf{n}|^{2}),     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the constraint | n |=1. They restricted their attention to "splay waves" where the director field takes the special form        𝐧   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  t  )    =   (    cos  φ    (  x  ,  t  )    ,    sin  φ    (  x  ,  t  )    ,  0  )    .        𝐧   x  y  z  t         φ    x  t        φ    x  t    0     \mathbf{n}(x,y,z,t)=(\cos\varphi(x,t),\sin\varphi(x,t),0).     This assumption reduces the Lagrangian to        ℒ  =    1  2    (    φ  t  2   -    a  2    (  φ  )    φ  x  2     )     ,    a   (  φ  )    :=     α    sin  2   φ    +   γ    cos  2   φ        ,     formulae-sequence    ℒ      1  2      superscript   subscript  φ  t   2      superscript  a  2   φ   superscript   subscript  φ  x   2        assign    a  φ         α    superscript   2   φ      γ    superscript   2   φ         \mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{t}^{2}-a^{2}(\varphi)\varphi_{x}^{2}%
 \right),\qquad a(\varphi):=\sqrt{\alpha\sin^{2}\varphi+\gamma\cos^{2}\varphi},     and then the Euler–Lagrange equation for the angle φ becomes        φ   t  t    =   a   (  φ  )     [   a   (  φ  )    φ  x    ]   x     .       subscript  φ    t  t      a  φ   subscript   delimited-[]    a  φ   subscript  φ  x     x      \varphi_{tt}=a(\varphi)[a(\varphi)\varphi_{x}]_{x}.     There are trivial constant solutions φ=φ 0 corresponding to states where the molecules in the liquid crystal are perfectly aligned. Linearization around such an equilibrium leads to the linear wave equation which allows wave propagation in both directions with speed     a  0   :=   a   (   φ  0   )       assign   subscript  a  0     a   subscript  φ  0      a_{0}:=a(\varphi_{0})   , so the nonlinear equation can be expected to behave similarly. In order to study right-moving waves for large t , one looks for asymptotic solutions of the form        φ   (  x  ,  t  ;  ϵ  )    =    φ  0   +   ϵ   φ  1    (  θ  ,  τ  )    +   O   (   ϵ  2   )      ,        φ   x  t  ϵ       subscript  φ  0     ϵ   subscript  φ  1    θ  τ      O   superscript  ϵ  2       \varphi(x,t;\epsilon)=\varphi_{0}+\epsilon\varphi_{1}(\theta,\tau)+O(\epsilon^%
 {2}),     where        θ  :=   x  -    a  0   t     ,   τ  :=   ϵ  t     .     formulae-sequence   assign  θ    x     subscript  a  0   t      assign  τ    ϵ  t      \theta:=x-a_{0}t,\qquad\tau:=\epsilon t.     Inserting this into the equation, one finds at the order    ϵ  2     superscript  ϵ  2    \epsilon^{2}   that         (    φ   1  τ    +    a  ′    (   φ  0   )    φ  1    φ   1  θ      )   θ   =    1  2    a  ′    (   φ  0   )    φ   1  θ   2     .       subscript     subscript  φ    1  τ       superscript  a  normal-′    subscript  φ  0    subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ    1  θ      θ       1  2    superscript  a  normal-′    subscript  φ  0    superscript   subscript  φ    1  θ    2      (\varphi_{1\tau}+a^{\prime}(\varphi_{0})\varphi_{1}\varphi_{1\theta})_{\theta}%
 =\frac{1}{2}a^{\prime}(\varphi_{0})\varphi_{1\theta}^{2}.     A simple renaming and rescaling of the variables (assuming that      a  ′    (   φ  0   )    ≠  0         superscript  a  normal-′    subscript  φ  0    0    a^{\prime}(\varphi_{0})\neq 0   ) transforms this into the Hunter–Saxton equation.  Generalization  The analysis was later generalized by Alì and Hunter, 4 who allowed the director field to point in any direction, but with the spatial dependence still only in the x direction:        𝐧   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  t  )    =   (    cos  φ    (  x  ,  t  )    ,    sin  φ    (  x  ,  t  )    cos  ψ    (  x  ,  t  )    ,    sin  φ    (  x  ,  t  )    sin  ψ    (  x  ,  t  )    )    .        𝐧   x  y  z  t         φ    x  t        φ    x  t     ψ    x  t        φ    x  t     ψ    x  t       \mathbf{n}(x,y,z,t)=(\cos\varphi(x,t),\sin\varphi(x,t)\cos\psi(x,t),\sin%
 \varphi(x,t)\sin\psi(x,t)).     Then the Lagrangian is        ℒ  =    1  2    (     φ  t  2   -    a  2    (  φ  )    φ  x  2     +     sin  2   φ    [    ψ  t  2   -    b  2    (  φ  )    ψ  x  2     ]     )     ,     a   (  φ  )    :=     α    sin  2   φ    +   γ    cos  2   φ       ,    b   (  φ  )    :=     β    sin  2   φ    +   γ    cos  2   φ         .     formulae-sequence    ℒ      1  2        superscript   subscript  φ  t   2      superscript  a  2   φ   superscript   subscript  φ  x   2         superscript   2   φ    delimited-[]     superscript   subscript  ψ  t   2      superscript  b  2   φ   superscript   subscript  ψ  x   2           formulae-sequence   assign    a  φ         α    superscript   2   φ      γ    superscript   2   φ        assign    b  φ         β    superscript   2   φ      γ    superscript   2   φ          \mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\varphi_{t}^{2}-a^{2}(\varphi)\varphi_{x}^{2}+%
 \sin^{2}\varphi\left[\psi_{t}^{2}-b^{2}(\varphi)\psi_{x}^{2}\right]\right),%
 \qquad a(\varphi):=\sqrt{\alpha\sin^{2}\varphi+\gamma\cos^{2}\varphi},\quad b(%
 \varphi):=\sqrt{\beta\sin^{2}\varphi+\gamma\cos^{2}\varphi}.     The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations are coupled nonlinear wave equations for the angles φ and ψ, with φ corresponding to "splay waves" and ψ to "twist waves". The previous Hunter–Saxton case (pure splay waves) is recovered by taking ψ constant, but one can also consider coupled splay-twist waves where both φ and ψ vary. Asymptotic expansions similar to that above lead to a system of equations, which, after renaming and rescaling the variables, takes the form          (    v  t   +   u   v  x     )   x   =  0   ,    u   x  x    =   v  x  2     ,     formulae-sequence     subscript     subscript  v  t     u   subscript  v  x     x   0      subscript  u    x  x     superscript   subscript  v  x   2      (v_{t}+uv_{x})_{x}=0,\qquad u_{xx}=v_{x}^{2},     where u is related to φ and v to ψ. This system implies 5 that u satisfies         [     (    u  t   +   u   u  x     )   x   -     1  2     u  x  2     ]   x   =  0   ,       subscript   delimited-[]     subscript     subscript  u  t     u   subscript  u  x     x       1  2    superscript   subscript  u  x   2      x   0    \left[(u_{t}+uu_{x})_{x}-\frac{1}{2}\,u_{x}^{2}\right]_{x}=0,     so (rather remarkably) the Hunter–Saxton equation arises in this context too, but in a different way.  Variational structures and integrability  The integrability of the Hunter–Saxton equation, or, more precisely, that of its x derivative         (    u  t   +   u   u  x     )    x  x    =    u  x    u   x  x      ,       subscript     subscript  u  t     u   subscript  u  x       x  x       subscript  u  x    subscript  u    x  x       (u_{t}+uu_{x})_{xx}=u_{x}u_{xx},     was shown by Hunter and Zheng, 6 who exploited that this equation is obtained from the Camassa–Holm equation         u  t   -   u   x  x  t     +   3  u   u  x     =    2   u  x    u   x  x     +   u   u   x  x  x               subscript  u  t    subscript  u    x  x  t       3  u   subscript  u  x         2   subscript  u  x    subscript  u    x  x       u   subscript  u    x  x  x        u_{t}-u_{xxt}+3uu_{x}=2u_{x}u_{xx}+uu_{xxx}     in the "high frequency limit"        (  x  ,  t  )   ↦   (   ϵ  x   ,   ϵ  t   )    ,   ϵ  →  0.      formulae-sequence   maps-to   x  t      ϵ  x     ϵ  t      normal-→  ϵ  0.     (x,t)\mapsto(\epsilon x,\epsilon t),\qquad\epsilon\to 0.     Applying this limiting procedure to a Lagrangian for the Camassa–Holm equation, they obtained a Lagrangian       ℒ  2   =     1  2    u  x  2    +   w   (    v  t   +   u   v  x     )          subscript  ℒ  2         1  2    superscript   subscript  u  x   2      w     subscript  v  t     u   subscript  v  x         \mathcal{L}_{2}=\frac{1}{2}u_{x}^{2}+w(v_{t}+uv_{x})     which produces the Hunter–Saxton equation after elimination of v and w from the Euler–Lagrange equations for u , v , w . Since there is also the more obvious Lagrangian        ℒ  1   =     u  x    u  t    +   u   u  x  2      ,       subscript  ℒ  1        subscript  u  x    subscript  u  t      u   superscript   subscript  u  x   2       \mathcal{L}_{1}=u_{x}u_{t}+uu_{x}^{2},     the Hunter–Saxton has two inequivalent variational structures. Hunter and Zheng also obtained a bihamiltonian formulation and a Lax pair from the corresponding structures for the Camassa–Holm equation in a similar way.  The fact that the Hunter–Saxton equation arises physically in two different ways (as shown above) was used by Alì and Hunter 7 to explain why it has this bivariational (or bihamiltonian) structure.
