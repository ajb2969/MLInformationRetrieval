Axiom of power set




Axiom of power set

In mathematics, the axiom of power set is one of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of axiomatic set theory.
In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:



where P stands for the Power set of A, 
 
 
 
 . In English, this says:

Given any set A, there is a set 
 
 
 
  such that, given any set B, B is a member of 
 
 
if and only if every element of B is also an element of A.
 

More succinctly: for every set 
 
 
 
 , there is a set 
 
 
 
  consisting precisely of the subsets of 
 
 
 
 .
Note the subset relation 
 
 
 
  is not used in the formal definition as subset is not a primitive relation in formal set theory; rather, subset is defined in terms of set membership, 
 
 
 
 . By the axiom of extensionality, the set 
 
 
 
  is unique.
The axiom of power set appears in most axiomatizations of set theory. It is generally considered uncontroversial, although constructive set theory prefers a weaker version to resolve concerns about predicativity.
Consequences
The Power Set Axiom allows a simple definition of the Cartesian product of two sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



Notice that









and thus the Cartesian product is a set since



One may define the Cartesian product of any finite collection of sets recursively:



Note that the existence of the Cartesian product can be proved without using the power set axiom, as in the case of the Kripke–Platek set theory.
