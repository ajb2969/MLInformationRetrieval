   Burning Index      Burning Index   Burning Index (BI) is a number used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to describe the potential amount of effort needed to contain a single fire in a particular fuel type within a rating area. The National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) uses a modified version of Bryam's equation for flame length - based on the Spread Component (SC) and the available energy (ERC) - to calculate flame length from which the Burning Index is computed. 1  The equation for flame length is listed below: 2         F  L   =   j    [    (    S  C   60   )    (   25   (   E  R  C   )    )    ]   0.46         subscript  F  L     j   superscript   delimited-[]        S  C   60     25    E  R  C      0.46      F_{L}=j\left[\left(\frac{SC}{60}\right)(25(ERC))\right]^{0.46}        where:   j is a scaling factor,  SC is the spread component ,  and ERC is the Energy Release Component .   Consequently, the equation for the Burning Index is: 3         B  I   =     j  1     F  L          B  I      subscript  j  1    subscript  F  L      BI=j_{1}\ F_{L}        where    j  1     subscript  j  1    j_{1}   is the Burning Index scaling factor of (10/ft). Therefore, dividing the Burning Index by 10 produces a reasonable estimate of the flame length at the head of a fire. A unique Burning Index (BI) table is required for each fuel model. 4  References  "  Category:Fire  Category:Firefighting     http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/fire/olm/nfdr_ind.htm â†©
