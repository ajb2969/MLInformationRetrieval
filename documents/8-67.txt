   Admissible set      Admissible set   In set theory , a discipline within mathematics, an admissible set is a transitive set     A    A   A\,   such that    ⟨  A  ,  ∈  ⟩     A     \langle A,\in\rangle   is a model of Kripke–Platek set theory (Barwise 1975).  The smallest example of an admissible set is the set of hereditarily finite sets . Another example is the set of hereditarily countable sets .
