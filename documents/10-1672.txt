   Maltose alpha-D-glucosyltransferase      Maltose alpha-D-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a maltose alpha-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   maltose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha,alpha-trehalose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , maltose , and one product , alpha,alpha-trehalose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is maltose alpha-D-glucosylmutase . Other names in common use include trehalose synthase , and maltose glucosylmutase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 5.4.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
