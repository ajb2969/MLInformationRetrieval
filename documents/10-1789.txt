   Selenocysteine lyase      Selenocysteine lyase   In enzymology , a selenocysteine lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-selenocysteine + reduced acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   selenide + L-alanine + acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-selenocysteine and reduced acceptor , whereas its 3 products are selenide , L-alanine , and acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-selenocysteine selenide-lyase (L-alanine-forming) . Other names in common use include selenocysteine reductase , and selenocysteine beta-lyase . This enzyme participates in selenoamino acid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
