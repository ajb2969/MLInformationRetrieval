SHA-3

 
SHA-3, a subset of the cryptographic primitive family Keccak (, or ),12 is a cryptographic hash function designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche, building upon RadioGatún.
History
On October 2, 2012, Keccak was selected as the winner of the NIST hash function competition.3 SHA-3 is not meant to replace SHA-2, as no significant attack on SHA-2 has been demonstrated. Because of the successful attacks on MD5 and SHA-0 and theoretical attacks on SHA-1, 4 NIST perceived a need for an alternative, dissimilar cryptographic hash, which became SHA-3.
In 2014, the NIST has published a draft FIPS 202 "SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions".5 FIPS 202 was approved on August 5, 2015.6
The Keccak algorithm (pronounced "ket-chak") is the work of Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michael Peters, and Giles Van Assche.7
Design
SHA-3 uses the sponge construction,89 in which message blocks are XORed into a subset of the state, which is then transformed as a whole. In the version used in SHA-3, the state consists of a 5×5 array of 64-bit words, 1600 bits total. The authors claim 12.5 cycles per byte10 on an Intel Core 2 CPU. However, in hardware implementations, it is notably faster than all other finalists.11
Keccak's authors have proposed additional, not-yet-standardized uses for the function, including an authenticated encryption system and a "tree" hash for faster hashing on certain architectures.12 Keccak is also defined for smaller power-of-2 word sizes w down to 1 bit (25 bits total state). Small state sizes can be used to test cryptanalytic attacks, and intermediate state sizes (from , 200 bits, to , 800 bits) can be used in practical, lightweight applications.1314
The block permutation
This is defined for any power-of-two word size,  bits. The main SHA-3 submission uses 64-bit words, ℓ = 6.
The state can be considered to be a 5×5×w array of bits. Let a[i][j][k] be bit  of the input, using a little-endian bit numbering convention. Index arithmetic is performed modulo 5 for the first two dimensions and modulo w for the third.
The basic block permutation function consists of  iterations of five sub-rounds, each individually very simple:

θ
Compute the parity of each of the 5w (320, when ) 5-bit columns, and exclusive-or that into two nearby columns in a regular pattern. To be precise, 
 
ρ
Bitwise rotate each of the 25 words by a different triangular number 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, .... To be precise, a[0][0] is not rotated, and for all , a[i][j][k] ← a[i][j][k−(t+1)(t+2)/2], where 
 
 
 
 .
 
π
Permute the 25 words in a fixed pattern. 
 
χ
Bitwise combine along rows, using . To be precise, . This is the only non-linear operation in SHA-3.
 
ι
Exclusive-or a round constant into one word of the state. To be precise, in round n, for , a[0][0][2m−1] is exclusive-ORed with bit  of a degree-8 LFSR sequence. This breaks the symmetry that is preserved by the other sub-rounds.
 

Hashing variable-length messages
thumb|upright=1.35|right|alt=Illustration of the sponge construction |The sponge construction for hash functions. pi are input, zi are hashed output. The unused "capacity" c should be twice the desired resistance to collision or preimage attacks. SHA-3 uses the "sponge construction", where input is "absorbed" into the hash state at a given rate, then an output hash is "squeezed" from it at the same rate.
To absorb r bits of data, the data is XORed into the leading bits of the state, and the block permutation is applied. To squeeze, the first r bits of the state are produced as output, and the block permutation is applied if additional output is desired.
Central to this is the "capacity" of the hash function, which is the  state bits that are not touched by input or output. This can be adjusted based on security requirements, but the SHA-3 proposal sets a conservative , where n is the size of the output hash. Thus, r, the number of message bits processed per block permutation, depends on the output hash size. The NIST submission sets the rate r as 1152, 1088, 832, or 576 (144, 136, 104 and 72 bytes) for 224, 256, 384 and 512-bit hash sizes, respectively. In April 2014, NIST published a draft that confirms these values.15
To ensure the message can be evenly divided into r-bit blocks, padding is required. The submission proposes the bit pattern 10*1: a 1 bit, zero or more 0 bits (maximum ), and a final 1 bit. The final 1 bit is required because the sponge construction security proof requires that the rate is encoded in the final block ("multi rate padding"). The current draft includes adding bits 01 to the message before the applying the padding.16 This provides domain separation from the SHAKEs, the other sponge modes included in the draft. For byte granularity data, this never increases the message size, since we have six unused bits anyways.
To compute a hash, initialize the state to 0, pad the input, and break it into r-bit pieces. Absorb the input into the state; that is, for each piece, XOR it into the state and then apply the block permutation.
After the final block permutation, the leading n bits of the state are the desired hash. Because r is always greater than n, there is actually never a need for additional block permutations in the squeezing phase. However, arbitrary output length may be useful in applications such as optimal asymmetric encryption padding. In this case, n is a security parameter rather than the output size.
Although not part of the SHA-3 competition requirements, smaller variants of the block permutation can be used, for hash output sizes up to half their state size, if the rate r is limited appropriately. For example, a 256-bit hash can be computed using 25 32-bit words if  (36 bytes per iteration).
Tweaks
Throughout the NIST hash function competition, entrants were permitted to "tweak" their algorithms to address issues that were discovered. Changes that have been made to Keccak are:1718

The number of rounds was increased from  to  to be more conservative about security.
The message padding was changed from a more complex scheme to the simple 10*1 pattern described above.
The rate r was increased to the security limit, rather than rounding down to the nearest power of 2.

NIST announcement controversy
In February 2013 at the RSA Conference, and then in August 2013 at CHES, NIST announced they would select different values for the capacity, i.e. the security parameter, for the SHA-3 standard, compared to the submission.1920 The changes caused some turmoil.
In September 2013, Daniel J. Bernstein suggested on the NIST hash-forum mailing list21 to strengthen the security to the 576-bit capacity that was originally proposed as the default Keccak.22 In late September, the Keccak team responded by stating that they proposed 128-bit security by setting c=256 as an option already in their SHA-3 proposal.23 However, in the light of the uproar in the cryptographic community, they proposed raising the capacity to 512 bits for all instances.24
In early October 2013, Bruce Schneier criticized NIST's decision on the basis of its possible detrimental effects on the acceptance of the algorithm, saying 
Paul Crowley, a senior developer at an independent software development company, expressed his support of the decision, saying that Keccak is supposed to be tunable and there is no reason for different security levels within one primitive. He also added: 
There was also some confusion that internal changes were made to Keccak. The Keccak team clarified this, stating that NIST's proposal for SHA-3 is a subset of the Keccak family, for which one can generate test vectors using their reference code submitted to the contest, and that this proposal was the result of a series of discussions between them and the NIST hash team.25 Also, Bruce Schneier corrected his earlier statement, saying 
In November 2013, in the light of the uproar in the cryptographic community, John Kelsey of NIST proposed to go back to the original c=2n proposal for all SHA-2 drop-in replacement instances.26 These changes were confirmed in the April 2014 draft.27
Examples of SHA-3 and Keccak variants

Hash values of empty string. Actual parameters other than digest size are the same as the submission to NIST.

For SHA3-n and Keccak-n, where n is 224, 256, 384, or 512 and is the output length.
For SHA3-n, an additional two bits 01 are appended to the message before padding.
As mentioned above, capacity is set to double the output length, per the submission to NIST.
Rate is set to 1600 bits minus capacity (rate plus capacity must always equal state size, so specifying any two implies the third).
The digest is encoded as a hexadecimal string.

Even a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a mostly different hash, demonstrating the avalanche effect. For example, the RHASH implementation has published the following outputs with inputs differing only in a period:28 Using RHash implementation SHA3-256("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")

The RHash Implementation is not the same as either the final SHA3 submission, nor is it like the FIPS 202 draft from April. RHash does not use the same bit order when absorbing bits. It does still match the same result published by NIST for the empty string case, because no bits are absorbed on an empty string. The final SHA3 submission for Keccak appends a 1 bit directly to start padding, while both the FIPS 202 draft and the RHash implementation use three bits "011" at the end of the message to begin padding.29
SHA-3 also includes two variable length Extendable-Output Functions, SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, with the numerical component determining their expected security level. These differ in both their capacity and padding rules. The capacity for SHAKE128 is 256 bits, and for SHAKE256 is 512 bits. An additional four bits 1111 are appended to the message before padding, and the output is truncated to the desired length. The first two appended bits are to differentiate SHAKE from SHA3-n, last two appended bits are for the Sakura coding scheme, and will be different for future tree hashing extensions of SHA-3.
