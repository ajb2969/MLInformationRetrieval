   Elongated triangular pyramid      Elongated triangular pyramid   In geometry , the elongated triangular pyramid is one of the Johnson solids ( J 7 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a tetrahedron by attaching a triangular prism to its base. Like any elongated pyramid , the resulting solid is topologically (but not geometrically) self- dual .  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (    1  12    (    2   +   3   3     )    )    a  3    ≈   0.550864...   a  3          V        1  12       2     3    3       superscript  a  3           0.550864...   superscript  a  3       V=(\frac{1}{12}(\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}))a^{3}\approx 0.550864...a^{3}       A  =    (   3  +   3    )    a  2    ≈   4.73205...   a  2          A      3    3     superscript  a  2           4.73205...   superscript  a  2       A=(3+\sqrt{3})a^{2}\approx 4.73205...a^{2}     If the edges are not the same length, use the individual formulae for the tetrahedron and triangular prism separately, and add the results together.  Dual polyhedron  Topologically, the elongated triangular pyramid is its own dual. Geometrically, the dual has seven irregular faces: one equilateral triangle, three isosceles triangles and three isosceles trapezoids.
