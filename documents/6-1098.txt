   Twistor space      Twistor space   In mathematics , twistor space is the complex  vector space of solutions of the twistor equation      ‚àá   A  ‚Ä≤    (  A     Œ©   B  )     =  0        superscript   subscript  normal-‚àá   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤     fragments  normal-(  A     superscript  normal-Œ©   fragments  B  normal-)     0    \nabla_{A^{\prime}}^{(A}\Omega^{B)}=0   . It was described in the 1960s by Roger Penrose and MacCallum. 1 According to Andrew Hodges , twistor space is useful for conceptualizing the way photons travel through space, using four complex numbers . He also posits that twistor space may aid in understanding the asymmetry of the weak nuclear force . 2  For Minkowski space , denoted   ùïÑ   ùïÑ   \mathbb{M}   , the solutions to the twistor equation are of the form        Œ©  A    (  x  )    =    œâ  A   -   i   x   A   A  ‚Ä≤      œÄ   A  ‚Ä≤             superscript  normal-Œ©  A   x      superscript  œâ  A     i   superscript  x    A   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤      subscript  œÄ   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤        \Omega^{A}(x)=\omega^{A}-ix^{AA^{\prime}}\pi_{A^{\prime}}     where    œâ  A     superscript  œâ  A    \omega^{A}   and    œÄ   A  ‚Ä≤      subscript  œÄ   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤     \pi_{A^{\prime}}   are two constant Weyl spinors and     x   A   A  ‚Ä≤     =    œÉ  Œº   A   A  ‚Ä≤      x  Œº         superscript  x    A   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤        subscript   superscript  œÉ    A   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤     Œº    superscript  x  Œº      x^{AA^{\prime}}=\sigma^{AA^{\prime}}_{\mu}x^{\mu}   is a point in Minkowski space. This twistor space is a four-dimensional complex vector space, whose points are denoted by     Z  Œ±   =   (   œâ  A   ,   œÄ   A  ‚Ä≤    )        superscript  Z  Œ±     superscript  œâ  A    subscript  œÄ   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤       Z^{\alpha}=(\omega^{A},\pi_{A^{\prime}})   , and with a hermitian form       Œ£   (  Z  )    =     œâ  A     œÄ  ¬Ø   A    +     œâ  ¬Ø    A  ‚Ä≤     œÄ   A  ‚Ä≤            normal-Œ£  Z        superscript  œâ  A    subscript   normal-¬Ø  œÄ   A       superscript   normal-¬Ø  œâ    superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤     subscript  œÄ   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤        \Sigma(Z)=\omega^{A}\bar{\pi}_{A}+\bar{\omega}^{A^{\prime}}\pi_{A^{\prime}}     which is invariant under the group SU(2,2) which is a quadruple cover of the conformal group C(1,3) of compactified Minkowski spacetime.  Points in Minkowski space are related to subspaces of twistor space through the incidence relation        œâ  A   =   i   x   A   A  ‚Ä≤      œÄ   A  ‚Ä≤      .       superscript  œâ  A     i   superscript  x    A   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤      subscript  œÄ   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤       \omega^{A}=ix^{AA^{\prime}}\pi_{A^{\prime}}.     This incidence relation is preserved under an overall re-scaling of the twistor, so usually one works in projective twistor space, denoted PT , which is isomorphic as a complex manifold to    ‚ÑÇ   ‚Ñô  3       ‚ÑÇ   superscript  ‚Ñô  3     \mathbb{CP}^{3}   .  Given a point    x  ‚àà  M      x  M    x\in M   it is related to a line in projective twistor space where we can see the incidence relation as giving the linear embedding of a    ‚ÑÇ   ‚Ñô  1       ‚ÑÇ   superscript  ‚Ñô  1     \mathbb{CP}^{1}   parametrized by    œÄ   A  ‚Ä≤      subscript  œÄ   superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤     \pi_{A^{\prime}}   .  The geometric relation between projective twistor space and complexified compactified Minkowski space is the same as the relation between lines and two-planes in twistor space; more precisely, twistor space is  T := C 4 . It has associated to it the double fibration of flag manifolds  P ‚Üê Œº  F  ŒΩ ‚Üí M , where   projective twistor space  P := F 1 ( T ) = P 3 ( C ) = P ( C 4 )    compactified complexified Minkowski space  M := F 2 ( T ) = G 2 ( C 4 ) = G 2,4 ( C )    the correspondence space between P and M   F := F 1,2 ( T )     In the above, P stands for projective space , G a Grassmannian , and F a flag manifold . The double fibration gives rise to two correspondences , c := ŒΩ . Œº ‚àí1 and c ‚àí1 := Œº . ŒΩ ‚àí1 .  M is embedded in P 5 ~=~ P (Œõ 2 T ) by the Pl√ºcker embedding and the image is the Klein quadric .  Rationale  In the (translated) words of Jacques Hadamard : "the shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex domain." Therefore when studying R 4 it might be valuable to identify it with C 2 . However, since there is no canonical way of doing so, instead all isomorphisms respecting orientation and metric between the two are considered. It turns out that complex projective 3-space P 3 ( C ) parametrizes such isomorphisms together with complex coordinates. Thus one complex coordinate describes the identification and the other two describe a point in R 4 . It turns out that vector bundles with self-dual connections on R 4 ( instantons ) correspond bijectively to holomorphic bundles on complex projective 3-space P 3 ( C ).
