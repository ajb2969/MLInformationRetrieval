   Clifford torus      Clifford torus   In geometric topology , the Clifford torus is a special kind of torus sitting inside R 4 , the Euclidean space of four dimensions. Alternatively, it can be seen as a torus sitting inside C 2 since C 2 is topologically equivalent to R 4 . Furthermore, every point of the Clifford torus lies at a fixed distance from the origin; therefore, it can also be viewed as sitting inside a 3-sphere .  The Clifford torus is also known as a square torus , because it is isometric to a square with side length 2π and with opposite sides identified. It is further known as a Euclidean 2-torus (the "2" is its topological dimension); figures drawn on it obey Euclidean geometry as if it were flat, whereas the surface of a common " doughnut "-shaped torus is positively curved on the outer rim and negatively curved on the inner. The Clifford torus cannot exist in Euclidean three-dimensional space. 1  Formal definition  The unit circle S 1 in R 2 can be parameterized by an angle coordinate:        S  1   =   {   (   cos  θ   ,   sin  θ   )   |   0  ≤  θ  <   2  π    }    .       superscript  S  1    conditional-set     θ     θ        0  θ         2  π        S^{1}=\{(\cos{\theta},\sin{\theta})\,|\,0\leq\theta<2\pi\}.     In another copy of R 2 , take another copy of the unit circle        S  1   =   {   (   cos  ϕ   ,   sin  ϕ   )   |   0  ≤  ϕ  <   2  π    }    .       superscript  S  1    conditional-set     ϕ     ϕ        0  ϕ         2  π        S^{1}=\{(\cos{\phi},\sin{\phi})\,|\,0\leq\phi<2\pi\}.   Then the Clifford torus is         S  1   ×   S  1    =   {   (   cos  θ   ,   sin  θ   ,   cos  ϕ   ,   sin  ϕ   )   |    0  ≤  θ  <   2  π    ,   0  ≤  ϕ  <   2  π     }    .         superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1     conditional-set     θ     θ     ϕ     ϕ     formulae-sequence      0  θ         2  π         0  ϕ         2  π         S^{1}\times S^{1}=\{(\cos{\theta},\sin{\theta},\cos{\phi},\sin{\phi})\,|\,0%
 \leq\theta<2\pi,0\leq\phi<2\pi\}.     Since each copy of S 1 is an embedded submanifold of R 2 , the Clifford torus is an embedded torus in R 2 × R 2 = R 4 .  If R 4 is given by coordinates ( x 1 , y 1 , x 2 , y 2 ), then the Clifford torus is given by         x  1  2   +   y  1  2    =  1  =    x  2  2   +   y  2  2     .           superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  y  1   2    1          superscript   subscript  x  2   2    superscript   subscript  y  2   2       x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}=1=x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}.\,     Alternate definitions  It is also common to consider the Clifford torus as an embedded torus in C 2 . In two copies of C , we have the following unit circles (still parametrized by an angle coordinate):       S  1   =   {    e   i  θ     |   0  ≤  θ  <   2  π    }        superscript  S  1    conditional-set   superscript  e    i  θ        0  θ         2  π        S^{1}=\{e^{i\theta}\,|\,0\leq\theta<2\pi\}   and        S  1   =   {    e   i  ϕ     |   0  ≤  ϕ  <   2  π    }    .       superscript  S  1    conditional-set   superscript  e    i  ϕ        0  ϕ         2  π        S^{1}=\{e^{i\phi}\,|\,0\leq\phi<2\pi\}.   Now the Clifford torus appears as         S  1   ×   S  1    =   {   (   e   i  θ    ,   e   i  ϕ    )   |    0  ≤  θ  <   2  π    ,   0  ≤  ϕ  <   2  π     }    .         superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1     conditional-set    superscript  e    i  θ     superscript  e    i  ϕ      formulae-sequence      0  θ         2  π         0  ϕ         2  π         S^{1}\times S^{1}=\{(e^{i\theta},e^{i\phi})\,|\,0\leq\theta<2\pi,0\leq\phi<2%
 \pi\}.   As before, this is an embedded submanifold, in this case of C 2 .  If C 2 is given by coordinates ( z 1 , z 2 ), then the Clifford torus is given by         |   z  1   |   2   =  1  =    |   z  2   |   2    .         superscript     subscript  z  1    2   1        superscript     subscript  z  2    2      \left|z_{1}\right|^{2}=1=\left|z_{2}\right|^{2}.     In the Clifford torus as defined above, the distance of any point of the Clifford torus to the origin of C 2 is           |   e   i  θ    |   2   +    |   e   i  ϕ    |   2     =   2    .           superscript     superscript  e    i  θ     2    superscript     superscript  e    i  ϕ     2       2     \sqrt{\left|e^{i\theta}\right|^{2}+\left|e^{i\phi}\right|^{2}}=\sqrt{2}.   The set of all points at a distance of √2 from the origin of C 2 is a 3-sphere, and so the Clifford torus sits inside this 3-sphere. In fact, the Clifford torus divides this 3-sphere into two congruent solid tori . (See Heegaard splitting .)  Instead of defining the Clifford torus as the product of two unit circles, it is also common to use two circles of radius 1/√2. (For example, Paul Norbury uses this convention when describing the Lawson Conjecture . 2 ) With the alternate radius of 1/√2, the Clifford torus instead sits in the unit 3-sphere S 3 .  Since O (4) acts on R 4 by orthogonal transformations , we can move the "standard" Clifford torus defined above to other equivalent tori via rigid rotations. The six-dimensional group O (4) acts transitively on the space of all such Clifford tori sitting inside the 3-sphere. However, this action has a two-dimensional stabilizer (see group action ) since rotation in the meridional and longitudinal directions of a torus preserves the torus (as opposed to moving it to a different torus). Hence, there is actually a four-dimensional space of Clifford tori. 3  Properties   The Clifford torus is "flat" - it can be flattened out to a plane without stretching, unlike the standard torus of revolution.  The Clifford torus divides the 3-sphere into two congruent solid tori. (In a stereographic projection , the Clifford torus appears as a standard torus of revolution. The fact that it divides the 3-sphere equally means that the interior of the projected torus is equivalent to the exterior, which is not easily visualized).   Uses in mathematics  In symplectic geometry , the Clifford torus gives an example of an embedded Lagrangian submanifold of C 2 with the standard symplectic structure. (Of course, any product of embedded circles in C gives a Lagrangian torus of C 2 , so these need not be Clifford tori.)  The Lawson conjecture states that every minimally embedded torus in the 3-sphere with the round metric must be a Clifford torus. This conjecture was proved by Simon Brendle in 2012.
