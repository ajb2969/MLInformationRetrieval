3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA + NADP+

 
  3-acetoacetyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 3-acetoacetyl-CoA, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, L(+)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, BHBD, dehydrogenase, L-3-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A (nicotinamide adenine, dinucleotide phosphate), L-(+)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation and butanoate metabolism.
