Geometry index

In structural chemistry and crystallography, the geometry index or structural parameter (
 
 
 
 ) is the number in a range 0...1 that indicates what the geometry of the coordination center is. The first such parameter for 5-coordinate compounds was developed in 1984. Later, parameters for 4-coordinate compounds were developed.

To distinguish whether the geometry of the coordination center is trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal, the  (originally just 
 
 
 
 ) parameter was proposed by Addison et al.:1


 
  where: 
 
 
 
  are the two greatest valence angles of the coordination center.
When  is close to 0 the geometry is similar to square pyramidal, while if  is close to 1 the geometry is similar to trigonal bipyramidal:

In 2007 Yang et al. developed the analogous  parameter to distinguish whether the geometry of the coordination center is square planar or tetrahedral.2 The formula is:


 
  where: 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the two greatest valence angles of coordination center;  cos−1(− ) ≈ 109.5°}} is a tetrahedral angle.
When  is close to 0 the geometry is similar to square planar, while if  is close to 1 then the geometry is similar to tetrahedral. However, in contrast to the  parameter, this does not distinguish 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  angles, so structures of significantly different geometries can have similar  values. To overcome this issue, in 2015 Okuniewski et al. developed parameter  that adopts values similar to  but better differentiates the examined structures:3


 
  where: 
 
 
 
  are the two greatest valence angles of coordination center;  cos−1(− ) ≈ 109.5°}} is a tetrahedral angle.
Extreme values of  and  denote exactly the same geometries, however  is always less or equal to  so the deviation from ideal tetrahedral geometry is more visible.
