   Geometry index      Geometry index   In structural  chemistry and crystallography , the geometry index or structural parameter (   τ   τ   τ   ) is the number in a range 0...1 that indicates what the geometry of the coordination center is. The first such parameter for 5-coordinate compounds was developed in 1984. Later, parameters for 4-coordinate compounds were developed.  5-coordinate compounds   (Figure)  Tau5 parameter for selected geometries.gif    To distinguish whether the geometry of the coordination center is trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal, the (originally just   τ   τ   τ   ) parameter was proposed by Addison et al. : 1       τ  5   =    β  -  α    60  ∘    ≈    -   0.01667  α    +   0.01667  β           subscript  τ  5       β  α    superscript  60                0.01667  α      0.01667  β       \tau_{5}=\frac{\beta-\alpha}{60^{\circ}}\approx-0.01667\alpha+0.01667\beta   where:    β  >  α      β  α    β>α   are the two greatest valence angles of the coordination center.  When is close to 0 the geometry is similar to square pyramidal, while if is close to 1 the geometry is similar to trigonal bipyramidal:  | File:Trigonal-bipyramidal-3D-balls.png  |alt2=Trigonal bipyramidal geometry  |Trigonal bipyramidal geometry   1}}  }}  4-coordinate compounds   (Figure)  Tau4 and tau4prime parameters for selected geometries.gif    In 2007 Yang et al. developed the analogous parameter to distinguish whether the geometry of the coordination center is square planar or tetrahedral. 2 The formula is:       τ  4   =     360  ∘   -   (   α  +  β   )      360  ∘   -   2  θ     ≈     -   0.00709  α    -   0.00709  β    +  2.55          subscript  τ  4        superscript  360      α  β       superscript  360      2  θ                  0.00709  α      0.00709  β    2.55      \tau_{4}=\frac{360^{\circ}-(\alpha+\beta)}{360^{\circ}-2\theta}\approx-0.00709%
 \alpha-0.00709\beta+2.55   where:   α   α   α   and   β   β   β   are the two greatest valence angles of coordination center; cos −1 (− ) ≈ 109.5°}} is a tetrahedral angle.  When is close to 0 the geometry is similar to square planar, while if is close to 1 then the geometry is similar to tetrahedral. However, in contrast to the parameter, this does not distinguish   α   α   α   and   β   β   β   angles, so structures of significantly different geometries can have similar values. To overcome this issue, in 2015 Okuniewski et al. developed parameter that adopts values similar to but better differentiates the examined structures: 3       τ  4  ′   =     β  -  α     360  ∘   -  θ    +     180  ∘   -  β     180  ∘   -  θ     ≈     -   0.00399  α    -   0.01019  β    +  2.55          superscript   subscript  τ  4   normal-′         β  α      superscript  360    θ         superscript  180    β      superscript  180    θ                  0.00399  α      0.01019  β    2.55      \tau_{4}^{\prime}=\frac{\beta-\alpha}{360^{\circ}-\theta}+\frac{180^{\circ}-%
 \beta}{180^{\circ}-\theta}\approx-0.00399\alpha-0.01019\beta+2.55   where:    β  >  α      β  α    β>α   are the two greatest valence angles of coordination center; cos −1 (− ) ≈ 109.5°}} is a tetrahedral angle.  Extreme values of and denote exactly the same geometries, however is always less or equal to so the deviation from ideal tetrahedral geometry is more visible.  0}} | File:AX4E0-3D-balls.png  |alt2=Tetrahedral geometry  |Tetrahedral geometry    τ 4 ′ {{=}} 1}}  }}  References  "  Category:Crystallography  Category:Chemistry  Category:Chemical structures     ↩  ↩  ↩
