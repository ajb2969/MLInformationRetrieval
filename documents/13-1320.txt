Hessenberg variety

In geometry, Hessenberg varieties, first studied by De Mari, Procesi, and Shayman, are a family of subvarieties of the full flag variety which are defined by a Hessenberg function h and a linear transformation X. The study of Hessenberg varieties was first motivated by questions in numerical analysis in relation to algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenspaces of the linear operator X. Later work by Springer, Peterson, Kostant, among others, found connections with combinatorics, representation theory and cohomology.
Definitions
A Hessenberg function is a function of tuples



where



For example,



is a Hessenberg function.
For any Hessenberg function h and a linear transformation



the Hessenberg variety is the set of all flags 
 
 
 
  such that



for all i. Here

  vectors in the flag

Examples
Some examples of Hessenberg varieties (with their 
 
 
 
  function) include:
The Full Flag variety: h(i) = n for all i
