Dihydropyrimidinase

In enzymology, a dihydropyrimidinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5,6-dihydrouracil + H2O 
 
 
 
  3-ureidopropanoate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6-dihydrouracil and H2O, whereas its product is 3-ureidopropanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6-dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include hydantoinase, hydropyrimidine hydrase, hydantoin peptidase, pyrimidine hydrase, and D-hydantoinase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: pyrimidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.
