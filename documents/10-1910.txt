   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate aldolase      2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate aldolase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate 6-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate 6-phosphate , and two products , pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate-6-phosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include 6-phospho-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate aldolase , phospho-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate aldolase , 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonic aldolase , phospho-2-keto-3-deoxygalactonic aldolase , 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonic acid aldolase , (KDPGal)aldolase , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate-6-phosphate , and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
