(R)-amidase

(R)-amidase (, R-stereospecific amidase, R-amidase) is an enzyme with system name (R)-piperazine-2-carboxamide amidohydrolase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) (R)-piperazine-2-carboxamide + H2O 
 
 
 
  (R)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid + NH3

(2) beta-alaninamide + H2O 
 
 
beta-alanine + NH3


This enzyme also hydrolyses (R)-piperidine-3-carboxamide to (R)-piperidine-3-carboxylic acid and NH3.
