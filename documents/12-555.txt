   Codex Regius (New Testament)      Codex Regius (New Testament)   | type = Alexandrian text-type | cat = II | hand = badly written | note = marginalia }}  Codex Regius designated by siglum  L e or 019 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 56 ( von Soden ), is a Greek uncial  manuscript of the New Testament , dated paleographically to the 8th century. 1 The manuscript is lacunose. It has marginalia .  Description  The codex contains 257 thick parchment leaves ({{×|23.5|17}}), with an almost complete text of the four Gospels . The codex contains five lacunae ( Matt 4:22-5:14, 28:17-20, Mark 10:16-30, 15:2-20, John 21:15-25). 2  The text is written in two columns per page, 25 lines per page, in large, not round uncial letters. It has breathings ( Spiritus asper , Spiritus lenis ), and accents often added wrongly. 3 It is carelessly written by an ignorant scribe. The letter phi is enormously large, the letter alpha presents the last stage of the uncial script. 4  The text is divided according to the  ( chapters ), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their  ( titles ) at the top of the pages. It contains also the tables of the  ( tables of contents ) before each Gospel. There is also another division according to the Ammonian sections, with references to the Eusebian Canons at the margin. It contains lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical reading). 5  It was badly written by the scribe, who was more probably Egyptian than Greek, with a tendency for writing Coptic rather than Greek.  It has two endings to the Gospel of Mark (as in codices Ψ 099  0112  274 mg  579  Lectionary 1602 ), 6 while John 7:53-8:11 is omitted.   Omissions   :* Matthew 12:47 omitted (as in codices Codex Sinaiticus , B , 1009, ℓ  12 , ff 1 , k , syr c , syr s , cop sa ). Mark 7: 16; 9:44.46; 11:26; Luke 17:36, and John 5:4 are omitted. It contains Luke 22:43-44 (the agony) omitted by other Alexandrian witnesses.  :*   ( and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ), as in codices Sinaiticus, B, D , Z , Θ , 085 , f 1 , f 13 , it, syr s, c , cop sa . 7  :* Luke 9:55b-56a —  ( and He said: "You do not know what manner of spirit you are of; for the Son of man came not to destroy men's lives but to save them ) omitted as in codices Sinaiticus B C Θ Ξ 33 700 892 1241 syr, cop bo ; 8  :* Luke 11:4 phrase  ( but deliver us from evil ) omitted. Omission is supported by the manuscripts:    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 , Sinaiticus, B, f 1 , 700 , vg, syr s , cop sa, bo , arm geo. 9  (Figure)  widthpx|220px|John 12:13-14 (facsimile); the initial for epsilon has motif with a blessing hand    Additions   :* In Matthew 10:12 it reads λεγοντες ειρηνη τω οικω τουτω instead of αυτην. The reading is used by manuscripts: Sinaiticus* ,2 , Bezae , Washingtonianus , Koridethi , f  1 1010 (1424), it vg cl . 10  :* In Matt. 27:49 codex contains added text:  ( the other took a spear and pierced His side, and immediately came out water and blood ). This reading was derived from John 19:34 and occurs in other manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type (א, B, C, Γ , 1010, 1293, pc, vg mss ). 11  :* In John 20:31 it reads ζωην αιωνιον along with א C(*) D Ψ 0100  f 13 it vg mss syr p, h cop sa , cop bo ; majority reads ζωην; 12   Some readings   In Matthew 1:10 it reads Αμων for Αμως (א, B, C), the reading of the codex agrees with W , f 13 and the Byzantine text.  Text  The Greek text of this codex is representative of the Alexandrian text-type in its late stadium. 13 It contains a large number of Byzantine readings in the Gospel of Matthew (1:1–17:26). Aland placed it in Category II , which means it has a number of non-Alexandrian readings. 14 According to Wisse, who examined Luke 1; 10; 20, their text is a "core member" of the Alexandrian text. 15  It is probably the fourth-best manuscript of the Gospels, inferior only to P 75 , Codex Vaticanus , and Codex Sinaiticus . It is much closer to Vaticanus than to Sinaiticus.  In some cases it supports Sinaiticus and Vaticanus against almost all of the rest of manuscripts. In Matt 23:38 word ερημος ( desert ) omitted like in B and ℓ  184 . In Matt 19:29 instead εκατονπλασιονα ( hundredfold ) it has πολλαπλασιονα ( manifold ) like in codices B and 1010.  In Matthew 19:16 it reads διδασκαλε ( teacher ) along with manuscripts: א , B , D , f 1 , 892 txt , 1010, 1365, ℓ  5 , it a, d, e, ff1 , cop bo , eth, geo, Origen, Hilary;  In Luke 22:1 it reads ηγγισεν for εγγιζεν along with Codex Bezae . 16  In Luke 4:17 it has textual variant καὶ ἀνοίξας τὸ βιβλίον ( and opened the book ) together with the manuscripts A , B, W , Ξ , 33 , 892 , 1195, 1241, ℓ  547 , syr s, h, pal , cop sa, bo , against variant καὶ ἀναπτύξας τὸ βιβλίον ( and unrolled the book ) supported by א, D c , K , Δ , Θ , Π , Ψ , f 1 , f 13 , 28 , 565 , 700 , 1009, 1010 and many other manuscripts. 17 18  In Luke 14:5 it reads ὄνος ἢ βοῦς for υἱὸς ἢ βοῦς; the reading of the codex is supported by א, K, L, X, Π, Ψ, f 1 , f 13 , 33, 892, 1071, ℓ  547 ; 19  It was noted in the 19th century that there is strong resemblance to Codex Vaticanus, to the citations of Origen , and to the margin of the Harkleian Syriac. 20  History  Probably it was written in Egypt.  The text of the codex was cited by Robert Estienne as η' in his Editio Regia . It was loosely collated by Wettstein . Griesbach set a very high value on the codex. It was edited in 1846 by Tischendorf ( Monumenta sacra inedita ), but with errors. 21  The codex is located now at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Gr. 62), in Paris . 22 23  See also   List of New Testament uncials  Textual criticism   References  Further reading   Constantin von Tischendorf , Monumenta sacra inedita (Leipzig 1846), pp. 15–24, 57-399.
