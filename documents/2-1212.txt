   Eigenfunction      Eigenfunction   In mathematics , an eigenfunction of a linear operator ,   A   A   A   , defined on some function space , is any non-zero function    f   f   f   in that space that returns from the operator exactly as is, except for a multiplicative scaling factor. More precisely, one has       A  f   =   Œª  f         A  f     Œª  f     Af=\lambda f     for some scalar ,   Œª   Œª   Œª   , the corresponding eigenvalue . The solution of the differential eigenvalue problem also depends on any boundary conditions required of   f   f   f   . In each case there are only certain eigenvalues  Œª n ( n {{=}} 1, 2, 3, ...)}} that admit a corresponding solution for  f n }} (with each belonging to the eigenvalue ) when combined with the boundary conditions. Eigenfunctions are used to analyze   A   A   A   .  For example,  e kx }} is an eigenfunction for the differential operator      A  =    d  2    d   x  2         A     superscript  d  2     d   superscript  x  2       A=\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}     for any value of   k   k   k   , with corresponding eigenvalue  k 2 }} . Similarly, the functions    s  i  n   (   k  x   )       s  i  n    k  x     sin(kx)   and    c  o  s   (   k  x   )       c  o  s    k  x     cos(kx)   , have eigenvalue  -k 2 }} . If a boundary condition is applied to this system (e.g.,     f   (  0  )    =  0        f  0   0    f(0)=0   or     f   (  0  )    =  3        f  0   3    f(0)=3   ), then even fewer pairs of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues satisfy both the definition of an eigenfunction, and the boundary conditions.  Specifically, in the study of signals and systems , the eigenfunction of a system is the signal    f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   which when input into the system, produces a response     y   (  t  )    =   Œª   f   (  t  )          y  t     Œª  normal-  f  t     y(t)=Œª‚Äâf(t)   with the complex constant   Œª   Œª   Œª   . 1  Examples  Derivative operator  A widely used class of linear operators acting on function spaces are the differential operators on function spaces . As an example, on the space of infinitely differentiable real functions of a real argument   t   t   t   , the process of differentiation is a linear operator since          d   d  t     (    a  f   +   b  g    )    =     a    d  f    d  t     +   b    d  g    d  t      ,  f    ,    g  ‚àà    C  ‚àû   ,  a    ,   b  ‚àà  ùêë     .     formulae-sequence        d    d  t        a  f     b  g          a      d  f     d  t       b      d  g     d  t      f     formulae-sequence    g    superscript  C    a      b  ùêë      \frac{d}{dt}(af+bg)=a\frac{df}{dt}+b\frac{dg}{dt},\qquad f,g\in C^{\infty},%
 \quad a,b\in\mathbf{R}.     The eigenvalue equation for a linear differential operator   D   D   D   in is then a differential equation       D  f   =   Œª  f         D  f     Œª  f     Df=\lambda f     The functions that satisfy this equation are commonly called eigenfunctions . For the derivative operator    d   d  t       d    d  t     \frac{d}{dt}   , an eigenfunction is a function that, when differentiated, yields a constant times the original function. That is,        d   d  t    f   (  t  )    =   Œª  f   (  t  )            d    d  t    f  t     Œª  f  t     \frac{d}{dt}f(t)=\lambda f(t)     for all   t   t   t   . This equation can be solved for any value of   Œª   Œª   Œª   . The solution is an exponential function        f   (  t  )    =   A   e   Œª  t      .        f  t     A   superscript  e    Œª  t       f(t)=Ae^{\lambda t}.     The derivative operator is defined also for complex-valued functions of a complex argument. In the complex version of the space , the eigenvalue equation has a solution for any complex constant   Œª   Œª   Œª   . The spectrum of the operator    d   d  t       d    d  t     \frac{d}{dt}   is therefore the whole complex plane . This is an example of a continuous spectrum .  Applications  Vibrating strings  Let    h   (  x  ,  t  )       h   x  t     h(x,t)   denote the sideways displacement of a stressed elastic chord, such as the vibrating strings of a string instrument , as a function of the position   x   x   x   along the string and of time   t   t   t   . From the laws of mechanics, applied to infinitesimal portions of the string, one can deduce that the function   h   h   h   satisfies the partial differential equation          ‚àÇ  2   h    ‚àÇ   t  2     =    c  2      ‚àÇ  2   h    ‚àÇ   x  2       ,          superscript   2   h      superscript  t  2        superscript  c  2       superscript   2   h      superscript  x  2        \frac{\partial^{2}h}{\partial t^{2}}=c^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}h}{\partial x^{2}},     which is called the (one-dimensional) wave equation . Here   c   c   c   is a constant that depends on the tension and mass of the string.  This problem is amenable to the method of separation of variables . If we assume that    h   (  x  ,  t  )       h   x  t     h(x,t)   can be written as the product of the form    X   (  x  )   T   (  t  )       X  x  T  t    X(x)T(t)   , we can form a pair of ordinary differential equations:           d  2    d   x  2     X   =   -     œâ  2    c  2    X         d  2    d   t  2     T   =   -    œâ  2   T      .     formulae-sequence         superscript  d  2     d   superscript  x  2     X          superscript  œâ  2    superscript  c  2    X            superscript  d  2     d   superscript  t  2     T        superscript  œâ  2   T       \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}X=-\frac{\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}X\qquad\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}T=-%
 \omega^{2}T.     Each of these is an eigenvalue equation, for eigenvalues    -    œâ  2    c  2           superscript  œâ  2    superscript  c  2      -\tfrac{\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}   and , respectively. For any values of   œâ   œâ   œâ   and   c   c   c   , the equations are satisfied by the functions        X   (  x  )    =   sin   (     œâ  x   c   +  œÜ   )     ,        X  x           œâ  x   c   œÜ      X(x)=\sin\left(\frac{\omega x}{c}+\varphi\right),           T   (  t  )    =   sin   (    œâ  t   +  œà   )     ,        T  t         œâ  t   œà      T(t)=\sin(\omega t+\psi),     where   œÜ   œÜ   œÜ   and   œà   œà   œà   are arbitrary real constants. If we impose boundary conditions (that the ends of the string are fixed with     X   (  x  )    =  0        X  x   0    X(x)=0   at    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   and    x  =  L      x  L    x=L   , for example) we can constrain the eigenvalues. For those boundary conditions , we find     s  i  n   (  œÜ  )    =  0        s  i  n  œÜ   0    sin(œÜ)=0   , and so the phase angle    œÜ  =  0      œÜ  0    œÜ=0   and       sin   (    œâ  L   c   )    =  0.            œâ  L   c    0.    \sin\left(\frac{\omega L}{c}\right)=0.     Thus, the constant   œâ   œâ   œâ   is constrained to take one of the values }} , where   n   n   n   is any integer. Thus, the clamped string supports a family of standing waves of the form        h   (  x  ,  t  )    =    sin   (    n  œÄ  x   L   )     sin   (    œâ  n   t   )      .        h   x  t            n  œÄ  x   L         subscript  œâ  n   t       h(x,t)=\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)\sin(\omega_{n}t).     From the point of view of our musical instrument, the frequency is the frequency of the   n   n   n   -th harmonic , which is called the    (   n  ‚àí  1   )      n  normal-‚àí  1    (n‚àí1)   -th overtone .  Quantum mechanics  Eigenfunctions play an important role in many branches of physics. An important example is quantum mechanics , where the Schr√∂dinger equation        H  œà   =   E  œà    ,        H  œà     E  œà     H\psi=E\psi,     with      H  =    -     ‚Ñè  2    2  m     ‚àá  2     +   V   (  ùê´  ,  t  )         H           superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m     superscript  normal-‚àá  2       V   ùê´  t       H=-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V(\mathbf{r},t)     has solutions of the form        œà   (  t  )    =    ‚àë  k     e   -    i   E  k   t   ‚Ñè      œÜ  k      ,        œà  t     subscript   k      superscript  e        i   subscript  E  k   t   Planck-constant-over-2-pi      subscript  œÜ  k       \psi(t)=\sum_{k}e^{-\frac{iE_{k}t}{\hbar}}\varphi_{k},     where are eigenfunctions of the operator   H   H   H   with eigenvalues . The fact that only certain eigenvalues with associated eigenfunctions satisfy Schr√∂dinger's equation leads to a natural basis for quantum mechanics and the periodic table of the elements, with each an allowable energy state of the system. The success of this equation in explaining the spectral characteristics of hydrogen is considered one of the greatest triumphs of 20th century physics.  Since the Hamiltonian operator   H   H   H   is a Hermitian Operator , its eigenfunctions are orthogonal functions . This is not necessarily the case for eigenfunctions of other operators (such as the example   A   A   A   mentioned above). Orthogonal functions 1, 2, ...)}} have the property that      0  =   ‚ü®   f  i   ,   f  j   ‚ü©   =   ‚à´   d  ùê´    f  i   ¬Ø    f  j           0    subscript  f  i    subscript  f  j             d  ùê´   normal-¬Ø   subscript  f  i     subscript  f  j        0=\langle f_{i},f_{j}\rangle=\int d\mathbf{r}\overline{f_{i}}f_{j}     where is the complex conjugate of .  whenever    i  ‚â†  j      i  normal-‚â†  j    i‚â†j   , in which case the set  is said to be orthogonal. Also, it is linearly independent .
