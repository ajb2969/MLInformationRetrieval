   15-hydroxyprostaglandin-D dehydrogenase (NADP+)      15-hydroxyprostaglandin-D dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin-D dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,15-dihydroxy-11-oxoprosta-5,13-dienoate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (5Z,13E)-9alpha-hydroxy-11,15-dioxoprosta-5,13-dienoate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,15-dihydroxy-11-oxoprosta-5,13-dienoate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (5Z,13E)-9alpha-hydroxy-11,15-dioxoprosta-5,13-dienoate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,15-dihydroxy-11-oxoprosta-5,13-dienoate:NADP + 15-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include prostaglandin-D 15-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , dehydrogenase, prostaglandin D2 , NADP + -PGD2 dehydrogenase , dehydrogenase, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin (nicotinamide adenine , dinucleotide phosphate) , 15-hydroxy PGD2 dehydrogenase , 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , NADP + -dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase , prostaglandin D2 dehydrogenase , NADP + -linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase , NADP + -specific 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase , NADP + -linked prostaglandin D2 dehydrogenase , and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin-D dehydrogenase (NADP + ) . This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
