   16S rRNA (cytosine967-C5)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (cytosine967-C5)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (cytosine 967 -C 5 )-methyltransferase (, rsmB (gene) , fmu (gene) , 16S rRNA m5C967 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytosine 967 -C 5 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 967 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 967 in 16S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates cytosine 967 at C 5 in 16S rRNA.
