16S rRNA (cytosine967-C5)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (cytosine967-C5)-methyltransferase (, rsmB (gene), fmu (gene), 16S rRNA m5C967 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytosine967-C5)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine967 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine967 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates cytosine967 at C5 in 16S rRNA.
