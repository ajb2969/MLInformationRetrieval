Inosine kinase

In enzymology, an inosine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + inosine 
 
 
 
  ADP + IMP
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and inosine, whereas its two products are ADP and IMP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:inosine 5'-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include inosine-guanosine kinase, and inosine kinase (phosphorylating). This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.
