   4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase      4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxybenzoate + CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-hydroxybenzoate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA hydrolase . This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
