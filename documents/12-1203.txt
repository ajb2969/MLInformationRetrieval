   Calibrated geometry      Calibrated geometry   In the mathematical field of differential geometry , a calibrated manifold is a Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) of dimension n equipped with a differential p -form  φ (for some 0 ≤ p ≤ n ) which is a calibration in the sense that   φ is closed: d φ = 0, where d is the exterior derivative  for any x ∈ M and any oriented p -dimensional subspace ξ of T x M , φ | ξ = λ vol ξ with λ ≤ 1. Here vol ξ is the volume form of ξ with respect to g .   Set G x ( φ ) = { ξ as above : φ | ξ = vol ξ }. (In order for the theory to be nontrivial, we need G x ( φ ) to be nonempty.) Let G ( φ ) be the union of G x ( φ ) for x in M .  The theory of calibrations is due to R. Harvey and B. Lawson and others. Much earlier (in 1966) Edmond Bonan introduced G 2 -manifold and Spin(7)-manifold , constructed all the parallel forms and showed that those manifolds were Ricci-flat. Quaternion-Kähler manifold were simultaneously studied in 1965 by Edmond Bonan and Vivian Yoh Kraines and they constructed the parallel 4-form.  Calibrated submanifolds  A p -dimensional submanifold Σ of M is said to be a calibrated submanifold with respect to φ (or simply φ -calibrated) if T Σ lies in G ( φ ).  A famous one line argument shows that calibrated p -submanifolds minimize volume within their homology class. Indeed, suppose that Σ is calibrated, and Σ ′ is a p submanifold in the same homology class. Then        ∫  Σ    vol  Σ    =    ∫  Σ   ϕ   =    ∫   Σ  ′    ϕ   ≤    ∫   Σ  ′     vol   Σ  ′             subscript   normal-Σ    subscript  vol  normal-Σ      subscript   normal-Σ   ϕ          subscript    superscript  normal-Σ  normal-′    ϕ          subscript    superscript  normal-Σ  normal-′     subscript  vol   superscript  normal-Σ  normal-′        \int_{\Sigma}\mathrm{vol}_{\Sigma}=\int_{\Sigma}\phi=\int_{\Sigma^{\prime}}%
 \phi\leq\int_{\Sigma^{\prime}}\mathrm{vol}_{\Sigma^{\prime}}     where the first equality holds because Σ is calibrated, the second equality is Stokes' theorem (as φ is closed), and the third inequality holds because φ is a calibration.  Examples   On a Kähler manifold , suitably normalized powers of the Kähler form are calibrations, and the calibrated submanifolds are the complex submanifolds .  On a Calabi–Yau manifold , the real part of a holomorphic volume form (suitably normalized) is a calibration, and the calibrated submanifolds are special Lagrangian submanifolds .  On a G 2 -manifold , both the 3-form and the Hodge dual 4-form define calibrations. The corresponding calibrated submanifolds are called associative and coassociative submanifolds.  On a Spin(7)-manifold , the defining 4-form, known as the Cayley form, is a calibration. The corresponding calibrated submanifolds are called Cayley submanifolds.
