   Phenylacetyl-CoA dehydrogenase      Phenylacetyl-CoA dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a phenylacetyl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phenylacetyl-CoA + H 2 O + 2 quinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylglyoxylyl-CoA + 2 quinol   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are phenylacetyl-CoA , H 2 O , and quinone , whereas its two products are phenylglyoxylyl-CoA and quinol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on CH or CH 2 groups with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylacetyl-CoA:quinone oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called phenylacetyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase .
