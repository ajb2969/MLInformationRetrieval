   D-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome c-553)      D-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome c-553)   In enzymology , a D-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome c-553) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-lactate + 2 ferricytochrome c-553   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + 2 ferrocytochrome c-553   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-lactate and ferricytochrome c-553 , whereas its two products are pyruvate and ferrocytochrome c-553 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-lactate:ferricytochrome-c-553 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism .
