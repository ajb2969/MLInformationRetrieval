   Epispiral      Epispiral   The epispiral is a plane curve with polar equation       r   =   a   sec   n  θ         r    a      n  θ       \ r=a\sec{n\theta}   . There are n sections if n is odd and 2 n if n is even.  It is the polar or circle inversion of the rose curve.  See also   Logarithmic spiral  Rose (mathematics)   References     "  Category:Curves
