   Q-construction      Q-construction   In algebra, Quillen 's Q-construction associates to an exact category (e.g., an abelian category ) an algebraic K-theory . More precisely, given an exact category C , the construction creates a topological space      B  +   C       superscript  B    C    B^{+}C   so that     π  0    (    B  +   C   )        subscript  π  0      superscript  B    C     \pi_{0}(B^{+}C)   is the Grothendieck group of C and, when C is the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring R , for    i  =   0  ,  1  ,  2       i   0  1  2     i=0,1,2   ,     π  i    (    B  +   C   )        subscript  π  i      superscript  B    C     \pi_{i}(B^{+}C)   is the i -th K-group of R in the classical sense. (The notation "+" is meant to suggest the construction adds more to the classifying space BC .) One puts        K  i    (  C  )    =    π  i    (    B  +   C   )           subscript  K  i   C      subscript  π  i      superscript  B    C      K_{i}(C)=\pi_{i}(B^{+}C)   and call it the i -th K-group of C . Similarly, the i -th K-group of C with coefficients in a group G is defined as the homotopy group with coefficients :        K  i    (  C  ;  G  )    =    π  i    (    B  +   C   ;  G  )           subscript  K  i    C  G       subscript  π  i       superscript  B    C   G      K_{i}(C;G)=\pi_{i}(B^{+}C;G)   .  The construction is widely applicable and is used to define an algebraic K-theory in a non-classical context. For example, one can define equivariant K-theory as    π  *     subscript  π     \pi_{*}   of    B  +     superscript  B     B^{+}   of the category of equivariant sheaves on a scheme.  Waldhausen 's S-construction generalizes the Q-construction in a stable sense; in fact, the former, which uses a more general Waldhausen category , produces a spectrum instead of a space. Grayson's binary complex also gives a construction of algebraic K-theory for exact categories. 1 See also module spectrum#K-theory for a K-theory of a ring spectrum .  Operations  Every ring homomorphism    R  →  S     normal-→  R  S    R\to S   induces      B  +   P   (  R  )    →    B  +   P   (  S  )       normal-→     superscript  B    P  R      superscript  B    P  S     B^{+}P(R)\to B^{+}P(S)   and thus      K  i    (   P   (  R  )    )    =    K  i    (  R  )    →    K  i    (  S  )             subscript  K  i     P  R       subscript  K  i   R     normal-→       subscript  K  i   S      K_{i}(P(R))=K_{i}(R)\to K_{i}(S)   where    P   (  R  )       P  R    P(R)   is the category of finitely generated projective modules over R . One can easily show this map (called transfer) agrees with one defined in Milnor's Introduction to algebraic K-theory . 2 The construction is also compatible with the suspension of a ring (cf. Grayson).  Details  Let C be an exact category; i.e., an additive full subcategory of an abelian category that is closed under extension. If there is an exact sequence    0  →   M  ′   →  M  →   M  ′′   →  0       normal-→  0   superscript  M  normal-′     normal-→    M    normal-→     superscript  M  ′′     normal-→    0     0\to M^{\prime}\to M\to M^{\prime\prime}\to 0   in C , then the arrow from M ' is called an admissible mono and the arrow from M is called an admissible epi.  Let QC be the category whose objects are the same as those of C and morphisms from X to Y are isomorphism classes of diagrams    X  ←  Z  →  Y       normal-←  X  Z    normal-→    Y     X\leftarrow Z\to Y   such that the first arrow is an admissible epi and the second admissible mono and two diagrams are isomorphic if they differ only at the middle and there is an isomorphism between them. The composition of morphisms is given by pullback.  Define a topological space     B  +   C       superscript  B    C    B^{+}C   by      B  +   C   =   Ω  B  Q  C          superscript  B    C     normal-Ω  B  Q  C     B^{+}C=\Omega BQC   where   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a loop space functor and    B  Q  C      B  Q  C    BQC   is the classifying space of the category QC (geometric realization of the nerve). As it turns out, it is uniquely defined up to homotopy equivalence (so the notation is justified.)  A theorem of Quillen states that, when C is the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring R ,     π  i    (    B  +   C   )        subscript  π  i      superscript  B    C     \pi_{i}(B^{+}C)   is the i -th K-group of R in the classical sense for    i  =   0  ,  1  ,  2       i   0  1  2     i=0,1,2   . The usual proof of the theorem (cf. Weibel) relies on an intermediate homotopy equivalence. If S is a symmetric monoidal category in which every morphism is an isomorphism, one constructs (cf. Grayson) the category     S   -  1    S       superscript  S    1    S    S^{-1}S   that generalizes the Grothendieck group construction of a monoid. Let C be an exact category in which every exact sequence splits; e.g., the category of finitely generated projective modules, and put    S  =   iso  C       S   iso  C     S=\operatorname{iso}C   , the subcategory of C with the same class of objects but with morphisms that are isomorphisms in C . Then there is a "natural" homotopy equivalence: 3       Ω  B  Q  C   ≃   B   (    S   -  1    S   )       similar-to-or-equals    normal-Ω  B  Q  C     B     superscript  S    1    S      \Omega BQC\simeq B(S^{-1}S)   . The equivalence is constructed as follows. Let E be the category whose objects are short exact sequences in C and whose morphisms are isomorphism classes of diagrams between them. Let    f  :   E  →   Q  C       normal-:  f   normal-→  E    Q  C      f:E\to QC   be the functor that sends an short exact sequence to the third term in the sequence. Note the fiber     f   -  1     (  X  )        superscript  f    1    X    f^{-1}(X)   , which is a subcategory, consists of exact sequences whose third term is X . This makes E a category fibered over  QC . Writing     S   -  1    f       superscript  S    1    f    S^{-1}f   for      S   -  1    E   →   Q  C      normal-→     superscript  S    1    E     Q  C     S^{-1}E\to QC   , there is an obvious (hence natural) inclusion    Ω  B  Q  C      normal-Ω  B  Q  C    \Omega BQC   into the homotopy fiber     F   (   B   S   -  1    f   )       F    B   superscript  S    1    f     F(BS^{-1}f)   , which can be shown to be a homotopy equivalence. On the other hand, by Quillen's Theorem B , one can show that    B   (    S   -  1    S   )       B     superscript  S    1    S     B(S^{-1}S)   is the homotopy pullback of    B   S   -  1    f      B   superscript  S    1    f    BS^{-1}f   along    *  →  B  Q  C     fragments   normal-→  B  Q  C    *\to BQC   and thus is homotopy equivalent to the    F   (   B   S   -  1    f   )       F    B   superscript  S    1    f     F(BS^{-1}f)   .  We now take C to be the category of finitely generated projective modules over a ring R and shows that     π  i   B   (    S   -  1    S   )        subscript  π  i   B     superscript  S    1    S     \pi_{i}B(S^{-1}S)   are the    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   of R in the classical sense for    i  =   0  ,  1  ,  2       i   0  1  2     i=0,1,2   . First of all, by definition,      π  0   B   (    S   -  1    S   )    =    K  0    (  R  )           subscript  π  0   B     superscript  S    1    S       subscript  K  0   R     \pi_{0}B(S^{-1}S)=K_{0}(R)   . Next,     G   L  n    (  R  )    =   Aut   (   R  n   )    →    S   -  1    S           G   subscript  L  n   R    Aut   superscript  R  n      normal-→       superscript  S    1    S      GL_{n}(R)=\operatorname{Aut}(R^{n})\to S^{-1}S   gives us:       B  G  L   (  R  )    =    lim  →    B  G   L  n    (  R  )     →   B   (    S   -  1    S   )            B  G  L  R    injective-limit    B  G   subscript  L  n   R      normal-→      B     superscript  S    1    S       BGL(R)=\underrightarrow{\lim}BGL_{n}(R)\to B(S^{-1}S)   . (Here,    B  G  L   (  R  )       B  G  L  R    BGL(R)   is either the classifying space of the category    G  L   (  R  )       G  L  R    GL(R)   or the Eilenberg–MacLane space of the type    K   (   G  L   (  R  )    ,  1  )       K     G  L  R   1     K(GL(R),1)   , amounting to the same thing.) The image actually lies in the identity component of    B   (    S   -  1    S   )       B     superscript  S    1    S     B(S^{-1}S)   and so we get:       f  :    B  G  L   (  R  )    →   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0      .     normal-:  f   normal-→    B  G  L  R     B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0       f:BGL(R)\to B(S^{-1}S)^{0}.   Let    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   be the full subcategory of S consisting of modules isomorphic to    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   (thus,    B   S  n       B   subscript  S  n     BS_{n}   is the connected component containing    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   ). Let    e  ∈    π  0    (   B  S   )        e     subscript  π  0     B  S      e\in\pi_{0}(BS)   be the component containing R . Then, by a theorem of Quillen,         H  p    (   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0    )    ⊂    H  p    (   B   (    S   -  1    S   )    )    =    H  p    (   B  S   )    [    π  0     (   B  S   )    -  1     ]    =    H  p    (   B  S   )    [   e   -  1    ]     .           subscript  H  p     B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0        subscript  H  p     B     superscript  S    1    S             subscript  H  p     B  S    delimited-[]     subscript  π  0    superscript    B  S     1               subscript  H  p     B  S    delimited-[]   superscript  e    1         H_{p}(B(S^{-1}S)^{0})\subset H_{p}(B(S^{-1}S))=H_{p}(BS)[\pi_{0}(BS)^{-1}]=H_{%
 p}(BS)[e^{-1}].   Thus, a class on the left is of the form    x   e   -  n        x   superscript  e    n      xe^{-n}   . But    x  ↦   x   e  m       maps-to  x    x   superscript  e  m      x\mapsto xe^{m}   is induced by the action of     R  m   ∈  S       superscript  R  m   S    R^{m}\in S   . Hence,         H  p    (   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0    )    =    lim  →     H  p    (   B   S  n    )     =    lim  →     H  p    (   B  G   L  n    (  R  )    )     =    H  p    (   B  G  L   (  R  )    )     ,   p  ≥  0      formulae-sequence         subscript  H  p     B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0      injective-limit     subscript  H  p     B   subscript  S  n            injective-limit     subscript  H  p     B  G   subscript  L  n   R             subscript  H  p     B  G  L  R        p  0     H_{p}(B(S^{-1}S)^{0})=\underrightarrow{\lim}H_{p}(BS_{n})=\underrightarrow{%
 \lim}H_{p}(BGL_{n}(R))=H_{p}(BGL(R)),\quad p\geq 0   . Since    B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0       B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0     B(S^{-1}S)^{0}   is an H -group,         π  1    (   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0    )    =    π  1     (   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0    )   ab    =    H  1    (   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0    )    =    H  1    (   B  G  L   (  R  )    )    =    H  1    (   G  L   (  R  )    )    =   G  L    (  R  )   ab    =    K  1    (  R  )     .           subscript  π  1     B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0        subscript  π  1    superscript    B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0    ab            subscript  H  1     B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0             subscript  H  1     B  G  L  R            subscript  H  1     G  L  R           G  L   superscript  R  ab            subscript  K  1   R      \pi_{1}(B(S^{-1}S)^{0})=\pi_{1}(B(S^{-1}S)^{0})^{\text{ab}}=H_{1}(B(S^{-1}S)^{%
 0})=H_{1}(BGL(R))=H_{1}(GL(R))=GL(R)^{\text{ab}}=K_{1}(R).   It remains to see    π  2     subscript  π  2    \pi_{2}   is    K  2     subscript  K  2    K_{2}   . Writing    F  f      F  f    Ff   for the homotopy fiber, we have the long exact sequence:        π  2    (   B  G  L   (  R  )    )    =  0  →    π  2    (   B    (    S   -  1    S   )   0    )    →    π  1    (   F  f   )    →    π  1    (   B  G  L   (  R  )    )    =   G  L   (  R  )    →    K  1    (  R  )             subscript  π  2     B  G  L  R    0    normal-→       subscript  π  2     B   superscript     superscript  S    1    S   0       normal-→       subscript  π  1     F  f      normal-→       subscript  π  1     B  G  L  R           G  L  R     normal-→       subscript  K  1   R      \pi_{2}(BGL(R))=0\to\pi_{2}(B(S^{-1}S)^{0})\to\pi_{1}(Ff)\to\pi_{1}(BGL(R))=GL%
 (R)\to K_{1}(R)   . From homotopy theory, we know the second term is central; i.e.,      π  1    (   F  f   )    →   E   (  R  )       normal-→     subscript  π  1     F  f      E  R     \pi_{1}(Ff)\to E(R)   is a central extension . It then follows from the next lemma that     π  1    (   F  f   )        subscript  π  1     F  f     \pi_{1}(Ff)   is the universal central extension (i.e.,     π  1    (   F  f   )        subscript  π  1     F  f     \pi_{1}(Ff)   is the Steinberg group of R and the kernel is     K  2    (  R  )        subscript  K  2   R    K_{2}(R)   .)  Proof: The homotopy type of    F  f      F  f    Ff   does not change if we replace f by the pullback    f  ~     normal-~  f    \widetilde{f}   along the universal covering of Y      →  Y     normal-→  absent  Y    \to Y   . Thus, we can replace the hypothesis by one that Y is simply connected and       H  p    (  X  ,  ℤ  )    ≃    H  p    (  Y  ,  ℤ  )     ,   p  ≥  0      formulae-sequence   similar-to-or-equals     subscript  H  p    X  ℤ       subscript  H  p    Y  ℤ       p  0     H_{p}(X,\mathbb{Z})\simeq H_{p}(Y,\mathbb{Z}),p\geq 0   . Now, Serre spectral sequences for     F  f   →  X  →  Y       normal-→    F  f   X    normal-→    Y     Ff\to X\to Y   and    *  →  Y  →  Y     fragments   normal-→  Y  normal-→  Y    *\to Y\to Y   say:        E   p  q      2   =    H  p    (  Y  ,    H  q    (   F  f   ,  ℤ  )    )    ⇒    H   p  +  q     (  X  ,  ℤ  )     ,         superscript   subscript  E    p  q    2      subscript  H  p    Y     subscript  H  q      F  f   ℤ        normal-⇒       subscript  H    p  q     X  ℤ       {}^{2}E_{pq}=H_{p}(Y,H_{q}(Ff,\mathbb{Z}))\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(X,\mathbb{Z}),           E   p  q   ′    2   =    H  p    (  Y  ,    H  q    (  *  ,  ℤ  )    )    ⇒    H   p  +  q     (  Y  ,  ℤ  )     .         superscript   subscript   superscript  E  normal-′     p  q    2      subscript  H  p    Y     subscript  H  q     ℤ        normal-⇒       subscript  H    p  q     Y  ℤ       {}^{2}E^{\prime}_{pq}=H_{p}(Y,H_{q}(*,\mathbb{Z}))\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(Y,%
 \mathbb{Z}).   By the comparison theorem for spectral sequences , it follows that     E   0  q      2   =   E   0  q   ′    2        superscript   subscript  E    0  q    2    superscript   subscript   superscript  E  normal-′     0  q    2     {}^{2}E_{0q}={}^{2}E^{\prime}_{0q}   ; i.e.,    F  f      F  f    Ff   is acyclic . (Coincidentally, by reversing argument, one can say this implies      H  p    (  X  ,  ℤ  )    ≃    H  p    (  Y  ,  ℤ  )       similar-to-or-equals     subscript  H  p    X  ℤ       subscript  H  p    Y  ℤ      H_{p}(X,\mathbb{Z})\simeq H_{p}(Y,\mathbb{Z})   ; thus, the hypothesis of the lemma.) Next, the spectral sequence for the covering       F  f   ~   →   F  f      normal-→   normal-~    F  f      F  f     \widetilde{Ff}\to Ff   with group    G  =    π  1    (   F  f   )        G     subscript  π  1     F  f      G=\pi_{1}(Ff)   says:       E   p  q      2   =    H  p    (  G  ,    H  q    (    F  f   ~   ,  ℤ  )    )    ⇒    H   p  +  q     (   F  f   ,  ℤ  )    =    H   p  +  q     (  *  ,  ℤ  )           superscript   subscript  E    p  q    2      subscript  H  p    G     subscript  H  q     normal-~    F  f    ℤ        normal-⇒       subscript  H    p  q       F  f   ℤ            subscript  H    p  q      ℤ       {}^{2}E_{pq}=H_{p}(G,H_{q}(\widetilde{Ff},\mathbb{Z}))\Rightarrow H_{p+q}(Ff,%
 \mathbb{Z})=H_{p+q}(*,\mathbb{Z})   . An inspection with this spectral sequence gives the desired result.
