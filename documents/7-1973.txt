Rushbrooke inequality

In statistical mechanics, the Rushbrooke inequality relates the critical exponents of a magnetic system which exhibits a first-order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit for non-zero temperature T.
Since the Helmholtz free energy is extensive, the normalization to free energy per site is given as



The magnetization M per site in the thermodynamic limit, depending on the external magnetic field H and temperature T is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the spin at the i-th site, and the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at constant temperature and field are given by, respectively



and



Definitions
The critical exponents 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are defined in terms of the behaviour of the order parameters and response functions near the critical point as follows












where



measures the temperature relative to the critical point.
Derivation
For the magnetic analogue of the Maxwell relations for the response functions, the relation



follows, and with thermodynamic stability requiring that 
 
 
 
 , one has



which, under the conditions 
 
 
 
  and the definition of the critical exponents gives



which gives the Rushbrooke inequality



Remarkably, in experiment and in exactly solved models, the inequality actually holds as an equality.
