   Glucosylglycerol 3-phosphatase      Glucosylglycerol 3-phosphatase   In enzymology , a glucosylglycerol 3-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called salt tolerance protein A, StpA .
