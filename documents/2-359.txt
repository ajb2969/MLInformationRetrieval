   Monotone convergence theorem      Monotone convergence theorem   In the mathematical field of real analysis , the monotone convergence theorem is any of a number of related theorems proving the convergence of monotonic sequences (sequences that are increasing or decreasing ) that are also bounded . Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a supremum , then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an infimum , it will converge to the infimum.  Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers  Lemma 1  If a sequence of real numbers is increasing and bounded above, then its supremum is the limit.  Proof  We prove that if an increasing sequence    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   is bounded above, then it is convergent and the limit is     sup  n    {   a  n   }       subscript  supremum  n     subscript  a  n      \sup\limits_{n}\{a_{n}\}   .  Since    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   is non-empty and by assumption, it is bounded above, then, by the Least upper bound property of real numbers,    c  =    sup  n    {   a  n   }        c    subscript  supremum  n     subscript  a  n       c=\sup_{n}\{a_{n}\}   exists and is finite. Now for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   , there exists   N   N   N   such that     a  N   >   c  -  ε        subscript  a  N     c  ε     a_{N}>c-\varepsilon   , since otherwise    c  -  ε      c  ε    c-\varepsilon   is an upper bound of    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   , which contradicts to   c   c   c   being     sup  n    {   a  n   }       subscript  supremum  n     subscript  a  n      \sup_{n}\{a_{n}\}   . Then since    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   is increasing, if     n  >  N   ,    |   c  -   a  n    |   ≤   |   c  -   a  N    |   <  ε      formulae-sequence    n  N           c   subscript  a  n         c   subscript  a  N          ε      n>N,|c-a_{n}|\leq|c-a_{N}|<\varepsilon   , hence by definition, the limit of    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   is      sup  n    {   a  n   }    .      subscript  supremum  n     subscript  a  n      \sup_{n}\{a_{n}\}.     Lemma 2  If a sequence of real numbers is decreasing and bounded below, then its infimum is the limit.  Proof  The proof is similar to the proof for the case when the sequence is increasing and bounded above.  Theorem  If    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   is a monotone sequence of real numbers (i.e., if a n ≤ a n +1 for every n ≥ 1 or a n ≥ a n +1 for every n ≥ 1), then this sequence has a finite limit if and only if the sequence is bounded . 1  Proof  The proof follows directly from the lemmas.  Convergence of a monotone series  Theorem  If for all natural numbers j and k , a j , k is a non-negative real number and a j , k ≤ a j +1, k , then (see for instance 2 page 168)         lim   j  →  ∞      ∑  k    a   j  ,  k      =    ∑  k     lim   j  →  ∞     a   j  ,  k       .        subscript    normal-→  j       subscript   k    subscript  a   j  k        subscript   k     subscript    normal-→  j      subscript  a   j  k        \lim_{j\to\infty}\sum_{k}a_{j,k}=\sum_{k}\lim_{j\to\infty}a_{j,k}.     The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers such that   the columns are weakly increasing and bounded, and  for each row, the series whose terms are given by this row has a convergent sum,   then the limit of the sums of the rows is equal to the sum of the series whose term k is given by the limit of column k (which is also its supremum ). The series has a convergent sum if and only if the (weakly increasing) sequence of row sums is bounded and therefore convergent.  As an example, consider the infinite series of rows           (   1  +   1  /  n    )   n   =    ∑   k  =  0   n     (      n      k      )   /   n  k     =    ∑   k  =  0   n     1   k  !    ×   n  n   ×    n  -  1   n   ×  ⋯  ×     n  -  k   +  1   n      ,         superscript    1    1  n    n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    superscript  n  k            superscript   subscript     k  0    n       1    k      n  n       n  1   n   normal-⋯        n  k   1   n        (1+1/n)^{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}/n^{k}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}%
 \frac{1}{k!}\times\frac{n}{n}\times\frac{n-1}{n}\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}%
 {n},        where n approaches infinity (the limit of this series is e ). Here the matrix entry in row n and column k is         (     n      k     )   /   n  k    =    1   k  !    ×   n  n   ×    n  -  1   n   ×  ⋯  ×     n  -  k   +  1   n     ;         binomial  n  k    superscript  n  k        1    k      n  n       n  1   n   normal-⋯        n  k   1   n      {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}/n^{k}=\frac{1}{k!}\times\frac{n}{n}\times\frac{n-%
 1}{n}\times\cdots\times\frac{n-k+1}{n};     the columns (fixed k ) are indeed weakly increasing with n and bounded (by 1/ k !), while the rows only have finitely many nonzero terms, so condition 2 is satisfied; the theorem now says that you can compute the limit of the row sums     (   1  +   1  /  n    )   n     superscript    1    1  n    n    (1+1/n)^{n}   by taking the sum of the column limits, namely    1   k  !       1    k     \frac{1}{k!}   .  Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem  This theorem generalizes the previous one, and is probably the most important monotone convergence theorem. It is also known as Beppo Levi 's theorem.  Theorem  Let ( X , Σ, μ ) be a measure space . Let     f  1   ,   f  2   ,  …      subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2   normal-…    f_{1},f_{2},\ldots   be a pointwise non-decreasing sequence of [0, ∞]-valued Σ– measurable functions, i.e. for every k ≥ 1 and every x in X ,       0  ≤    f  k    (  x  )    ≤    f   k  +  1     (  x  )     .        0     subscript  f  k   x           subscript  f    k  1    x      0\leq f_{k}(x)\leq f_{k+1}(x).\,     Next, set the pointwise limit of the sequence    (   f  n   )     subscript  f  n    (f_{n})   to be f . That is, for every x in X ,        f   (  x  )    :=    lim   k  →  ∞      f  k    (  x  )      .     assign    f  x     subscript    normal-→  k        subscript  f  k   x      f(x):=\lim_{k\to\infty}f_{k}(x).\,     Then f is Σ– measurable and         lim   k  →  ∞     ∫     f  k    d  μ     =   ∫    f   d  μ     .        subscript    normal-→  k          subscript  f  k   normal-d  μ         f  normal-d  μ      \lim_{k\to\infty}\int f_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu.     Remark. If the sequence    (   f  k   )     subscript  f  k    (f_{k})   satisfies the assumptions μ –almost everywhere, one can find a set N ∈ Σ with μ ( N ) = 0 such that the sequence    (    f  k    (  x  )    )       subscript  f  k   x    (f_{k}(x))   is non-decreasing for every    x  ∉  N      x  N    x\notin N   . The result remains true because for every k ,         ∫     f  k    d  μ    =    ∫   X  ∖  N       f  k    d  μ     ,     and    ∫    f   d  μ     =    ∫   X  ∖  N      f   d  μ      ,     formulae-sequence         subscript  f  k   normal-d  μ      subscript     X  N       subscript  f  k   normal-d  μ         and      f  normal-d  μ       subscript     X  N      f  normal-d  μ       \int f_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int_{X\setminus N}f_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu,\ \text{and}%
 \ \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int_{X\setminus N}f\,\mathrm{d}\mu,     provided that f is Σ–measurable (see for instance 3 section 21.38).  Proof  We will first show that f is Σ– measurable (see for instance 4 section 21.3). To do this, it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of an interval [0, t ] under f is an element of the sigma algebra Σ on X , because (closed) intervals generate the Borel sigma algebra on the reals. Let I = [0, t ] be such a subinterval of [0, ∞]. Let         f   -  1     (  I  )    =   {   x  ∈  X   ∣    f   (  x  )    ∈  I   }    .         superscript  f    1    I    conditional-set    x  X       f  x   I      f^{-1}(I)=\{x\in X\mid f(x)\in I\}.     Since I is a closed interval and      ∀  k   ,    f  k    (  x  )     ≤   f   (  x  )          for-all  k      subscript  f  k   x      f  x     \forall k,f_{k}(x)\leq f(x)   ,         f   (  x  )    ∈  I   ⇔      f  k    (  x  )    ∈  I   ,    ∀  k   ∈  ℕ     .     normal-⇔      f  x   I    formulae-sequence       subscript  f  k   x   I      for-all  k   ℕ      f(x)\in I\Leftrightarrow f_{k}(x)\in I,~{}\forall k\in\mathbb{N}.     Thus,        {   x  ∈  X   ∣    f   (  x  )    ∈  I   }   =    ⋂   k  ∈  ℕ     {   x  ∈  X   ∣     f  k    (  x  )    ∈  I   }     .       conditional-set    x  X       f  x   I      subscript     k  ℕ     conditional-set    x  X        subscript  f  k   x   I       \{x\in X\mid f(x)\in I\}=\bigcap_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\{x\in X\mid f_{k}(x)\in I\}.     Note that each set in the countable intersection is an element of Σ because it is the inverse image of a Borel subset under a Σ- measurable function    f  k     subscript  f  k    f_{k}   . Since sigma algebras are, by definition, closed under countable intersections, this shows that f is Σ-measurable. In general, the supremum of any countable family of measurable functions is also measurable.  Now we will prove the rest of the monotone convergence theorem. The fact that f is Σ-measurable implies that the expression    ∫    f   d  μ         f  normal-d  μ     \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu   is well defined.  We will start by showing that      ∫    f   d  μ    ≥    lim  k    ∫     f  k    d  μ      .          f  normal-d  μ      subscript   k        subscript  f  k   normal-d  μ       \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu\geq\lim_{k}\int f_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu.     By the definition of the Lebesgue integral ,        ∫    f   d  μ    =   sup   {   ∫    g   d  μ    ∣    g  ∈   S  F    ,   g  ≤  f    }     ,          f  normal-d  μ     supremum   conditional-set      g  normal-d  μ     formulae-sequence    g    S  F      g  f        \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\sup\left\{\int g\,\mathrm{d}\mu\mid g\in SF,\ g\leq f%
 \right\},     where SF is the set of Σ-measurable simple functions on X . Since      f  k    (  x  )    ≤   f   (  x  )           subscript  f  k   x     f  x     f_{k}(x)\leq f(x)   at every x ∈ X , we have that        {   ∫    g   d  μ    ∣    g  ∈   S  F    ,   g  ≤   f  k     }   ⊆   {   ∫    g   d  μ    ∣    g  ∈   S  F    ,   g  ≤  f    }    .       conditional-set      g  normal-d  μ     formulae-sequence    g    S  F      g   subscript  f  k       conditional-set      g  normal-d  μ     formulae-sequence    g    S  F      g  f       \left\{\int g\,\mathrm{d}\mu\mid g\in SF,\ g\leq f_{k}\right\}\subseteq\left\{%
 \int g\,\mathrm{d}\mu\mid g\in SF,\ g\leq f\right\}.     Hence, since the supremum of a subset cannot be larger than that of the whole set, we have that:        ∫    f   d  μ    ≥    lim  k    ∫     f  k    d  μ      ,          f  normal-d  μ      subscript   k        subscript  f  k   normal-d  μ       \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu\geq\lim_{k}\int f_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu,     and the limit on the right exists, since the sequence is monotonic.  We now prove the inequality in the other direction (which also follows from Fatou's lemma ), that is we seek to show that        ∫    f   d  μ    ≤    lim  k    ∫     f  k    d  μ      .          f  normal-d  μ      subscript   k        subscript  f  k   normal-d  μ       \int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu\leq\lim_{k}\int f_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu.     It follows from the definition of integral, that there is a non-decreasing sequence ( g k ) of non-negative simple functions such that g k ≤ f and such that         lim  k    ∫     g  k    d  μ     =   ∫    f   d  μ     .        subscript   k        subscript  g  k   normal-d  μ         f  normal-d  μ      \lim_{k}\int g_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int f\,\mathrm{d}\mu.     It suffices to prove that for each    k  ∈  ℕ      k  ℕ    k\in\mathbb{N}   ,       ∫     g  k    d  μ    ≤    lim  j    ∫     f  j    d  μ              subscript  g  k   normal-d  μ      subscript   j        subscript  f  j   normal-d  μ       \int g_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu\leq\lim_{j}\int f_{j}\,\mathrm{d}\mu     because if this is true for each k , then the limit of the left-hand side will also be less than or equal to the right-hand side.  We will show that if g k is a simple function and        lim  j     f  j    (  x  )     ≥    g  k    (  x  )          subscript   j      subscript  f  j   x       subscript  g  k   x     \lim_{j}f_{j}(x)\geq g_{k}(x)\,     for every x , then         lim  j    ∫     f  j    d  μ     ≥   ∫     g  k    d  μ     .        subscript   j        subscript  f  j   normal-d  μ          subscript  g  k   normal-d  μ      \lim_{j}\int f_{j}\,\mathrm{d}\mu\geq\int g_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu.     Since the integral is linear, we may break up the function    g  k     subscript  g  k    g_{k}   into its constant value parts, reducing to the case in which    g  k     subscript  g  k    g_{k}   is the indicator function of an element B of the sigma algebra Σ. In this case, we assume that    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   is a sequence of measurable functions whose supremum at every point of B is greater than or equal to one.  To prove this result, fix ε > 0 and define the sequence of measurable sets        B  n   =   {   x  ∈  B   :     f  n    (  x  )    ≥   1  -  ϵ    }    .       subscript  B  n    conditional-set    x  B        subscript  f  n   x     1  ϵ       B_{n}=\{x\in B:f_{n}(x)\geq 1-\epsilon\}.\,     By monotonicity of the integral, it follows that for any    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   ,       μ   (   B  n   )    (   1  -  ϵ   )    =   ∫    (   1  -  ϵ   )     1   B  n     d  μ    ≤   ∫     f  n    d  μ            μ   subscript  B  n     1  ϵ          1  ϵ    subscript  1   subscript  B  n    normal-d  μ              subscript  f  n   normal-d  μ       \mu(B_{n})(1-\epsilon)=\int(1-\epsilon)1_{B_{n}}\,\mathrm{d}\mu\leq\int f_{n}%
 \,\mathrm{d}\mu     By the assumption that      lim  j     f  j    (  x  )     ≥    g  k    (  x  )          subscript   j      subscript  f  j   x       subscript  g  k   x     \lim_{j}f_{j}(x)\geq g_{k}(x)   , any x in B will be in    B  n     subscript  B  n    B_{n}   for sufficiently high values of n , and therefore         ⋃  n    B  n    =  B   .        subscript   n    subscript  B  n    B    \bigcup_{n}B_{n}=B.     Thus, we have that        ∫     g  k    d  μ    =   ∫     1  B    d  μ    =   μ   (  B  )    =   μ   (    ⋃  n    B  n    )     .             subscript  g  k   normal-d  μ         subscript  1  B   normal-d  μ           μ  B          μ    subscript   n    subscript  B  n        \int g_{k}\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int 1_{B}\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\mu(B)=\mu\left(\bigcup_{n%
 }B_{n}\right).     Using the monotonicity property of measures, we can continue the above equalities as follows:        μ   (    ⋃  n    B  n    )    =    lim  n    μ   (   B  n   )     ≤    lim  n      (   1  -  ϵ   )    -  1     ∫     f  n    d  μ       .          μ    subscript   n    subscript  B  n       subscript   n     μ   subscript  B  n            subscript   n      superscript    1  ϵ     1         subscript  f  n   normal-d  μ         \mu\left(\bigcup_{n}B_{n}\right)=\lim_{n}\mu(B_{n})\leq\lim_{n}(1-\epsilon)^{-%
 1}\int f_{n}\,\mathrm{d}\mu.     Taking k → ∞, and using the fact that this is true for any positive ε , the result follows.
