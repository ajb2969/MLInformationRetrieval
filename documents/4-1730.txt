Simon . Simon originally called it the Yule distribution . 1  The probability mass function of the Yule–Simon ( ρ ) distribution is        f   (  k  ;  ρ  )    =    ρ   B   (  k  ,   ρ  +  1   )     ,        f   k  ρ      ρ  normal-B   k    ρ  1       f(k;\rho)=\rho\,\mathrm{B}(k,\rho+1),\,     for integer     k  ≥  1      k  1    k\geq 1   and real     ρ  >  0      ρ  0    \rho>0   , where   B   normal-B   \mathrm{B}   is the beta function . Equivalently the pmf can be written in terms of the falling factorial as        f   (  k  ;  ρ  )    =     ρ   Γ   (   ρ  +  1   )      (   k  +  ρ   )     ρ  +  1   ¯      ,        f   k  ρ        ρ  normal-Γ    ρ  1     superscript    k  ρ    normal-¯    ρ  1        f(k;\rho)=\frac{\rho\,\Gamma(\rho+1)}{(k+\rho)^{\underline{\rho+1}}},\,     where   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the gamma function . Thus, if   ρ   ρ   \rho   is an integer,        f   (  k  ;  ρ  )    =     ρ    ρ  !     (   k  -  1   )   !      (   k  +  ρ   )   !     .        f   k  ρ        ρ    ρ       k  1         k  ρ       f(k;\rho)=\frac{\rho\,\rho!\,(k-1)!}{(k+\rho)!}.\,     The parameter   ρ   ρ   \rho   can be estimated using a fixed point algorithm. 2  The probability mass function f has the property that for sufficiently large k we have        f   (  k  ;  ρ  )    ≈     ρ   Γ   (   ρ  +  1   )     k   ρ  +  1     ∝   1   k   ρ  +  1      .          f   k  ρ        ρ  normal-Γ    ρ  1     superscript  k    ρ  1       proportional-to      1   superscript  k    ρ  1        f(k;\rho)\approx\frac{\rho\,\Gamma(\rho+1)}{k^{\rho+1}}\propto\frac{1}{k^{\rho%
 +1}}.\,     This means that the tail of the Yule–Simon distribution is a realization of Zipf's law     f   (  k  ;  ρ  )       f   k  ρ     f(k;\rho)   can be used to model, for example, the relative frequency of the   k   k   k   th most frequent word in a large collection of text, which according to Zipf's law is inversely proportional to a (typically small) power of   k   k   k   .  Occurrence  The Yule–Simon distribution arose originally as the limiting distribution of a particular stochastic process studied by Yule as a model for the distribution of biological taxa and subtaxa. 3 Simon dubbed this process the "Yule process" but it is more commonly known today as a preferential attachment process. The preferential attachment process is an urn process in which balls are added to a growing number of urns, each ball being allocated to an urn with probability linear in the number the urn already contains.  The distribution also arises as a compound distribution , in which the parameter of a geometric distribution is treated as a function of random variable having an exponential distribution . Specifically, assume that   W   W   W   follows an exponential distribution with scale     1  /  ρ      1  ρ    1/\rho   or rate   ρ   ρ   \rho   :       W  ∼   Exponential   (  ρ  )     ,     similar-to  W    Exponential  ρ     W\sim\mathrm{Exponential}(\rho)\,,   with density        h   (  w  ;  ρ  )    =    ρ    exp   (   -    ρ   w    )      .        h   w  ρ      ρ        ρ  w        h(w;\rho)=\rho\,\exp(-\rho\,w)\,.     Then a Yule–Simon distributed variable K has the following geometric distribution conditional on W :       K  ∼   Geometric   (   exp   (   -  W   )    )     .     similar-to  K    Geometric      W       K\sim\mathrm{Geometric}(\exp(-W))\,.     The pmf of a geometric distribution is       g   (  k  ;  p  )    =    p      (   1  -  p   )    k  -  1            g   k  p      p   superscript    1  p     k  1       g(k;p)=p\,(1-p)^{k-1}\,     for    k  ∈   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  }       k   1  2  normal-…     k\in\{1,2,\dots\}   . The Yule–Simon pmf is then the following exponential-geometric compound distribution:        f   (  k  ;  ρ  )    =     ∫  0  ∞     g   (  k  ;   exp   (   -  w   )    )   h   (  w  ;  ρ  )   d   w      .        f   k  ρ      superscript   subscript   0       g   k      w     h   w  ρ   d  w      f(k;\rho)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\,\,\,g(k;\exp(-w))\,h(w;\rho)\,dw\,.     Recurrence relation      {     k  P   (  k  )    =    (   α  +  k  +  1   )   P   (   k  +  1   )     ,    P   (  1  )    =   α  B   (   α  +  1   ,  1  )      }      formulae-sequence      k  P  k       α  k  1   P    k  1         P  1     α  B     α  1   1        \{kP(k)=(\alpha+k+1)P(k+1),P(1)=\alpha B(\alpha+1,1)\}     Generalizations  The two-parameter generalization of the original Yule distribution replaces the beta function with an incomplete beta function . The probability mass function of the generalized Yule–Simon( ρ , α ) distribution is defined as        f   (  k  ;  ρ  ,  α  )    =     ρ   1  -   α  ρ       B   1  -  α     (  k  ,   ρ  +  1   )     ,        f   k  ρ  α        ρ    1   superscript  α  ρ      subscript  normal-B    1  α     k    ρ  1       f(k;\rho,\alpha)=\frac{\rho}{1-\alpha^{\rho}}\;\mathrm{B}_{1-\alpha}(k,\rho+1),\,     with    0  ≤  α  <  1        0  α       1     0\leq\alpha<1   . For    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   the ordinary Yule–Simon( ρ ) distribution is obtained as a special case. The use of the incomplete beta function has the effect of introducing an exponential cutoff in the upper tail.
