   Snub dodecahedron      Snub dodecahedron   In geometry , the snub dodecahedron , or snub icosidodecahedron , is an Archimedean solid , one of thirteen convex isogonal nonprismatic solids constructed by two or more types of regular polygon  faces .  The snub dodecahedron has 92 faces (the most of the 13 Archimedean solids): 12 are pentagons and the other 80 are equilateral triangles . It also has 150 edges, and 60 vertices.  It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or " enantiomorphs ") of each other. The union of both forms is a compound of two snub dodecahedra , and the convex hull of both forms is a truncated icosidodecahedron .  Kepler first named it in Latin as dodecahedron simum in 1619 in his Harmonices Mundi . H. S. M. Coxeter , noting it could be derived equally from either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron, called it snub icosidodecahedron , with a vertical extended Schläfli symbol     s   {     5      3     }       s    5    3      s\begin{Bmatrix}5\\

Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a snub dodecahedron are all the even permutations of   (±2α, ±2, ±2β),  (±(α+β/ϕ+ϕ), ±(−αϕ+β+1/ϕ), ±(α/ϕ+βϕ−1)),  (±(−α/ϕ+βϕ+1), ±(−α+β/ϕ−ϕ), ±(αϕ+β−1/ϕ)),  (±(−α/ϕ+βϕ−1), ±(α−β/ϕ−ϕ), ±(αϕ+β+1/ϕ)) and  (±(α+β/ϕ−ϕ), ±(αϕ−β+1/ϕ), ±(α/ϕ+βϕ+1)),   with an even number of plus signs, where   α = ξ − 1 / ξ   and   β = ξϕ + ϕ 2 + ϕ /ξ,   where ϕ = (1 + √5)/2 is the golden ratio and ξ is the real solution to ξ 3 − 2ξ = ϕ, which is the number:      ξ  =      ϕ  2   +    1  2     ϕ  -   5  27       3   +     ϕ  2   -    1  2     ϕ  -   5  27       3        ξ       3       ϕ  2       1  2       ϕ    5  27           3       ϕ  2       1  2       ϕ    5  27           \xi=\sqrt[3]{\frac{\phi}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\phi-\frac{5}{27}}}+\sqrt[3]{%
 \frac{\phi}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\phi-\frac{5}{27}}}     or approximately 1.7155615.  This snub dodecahedron has an edge length of approximately 6.0437380841.  Taking the odd permutations of the above coordinates with an even number of plus signs gives another form, the enantiomorph of the other one. Though it may not be immediately obvious, the figure obtained by taking the even permutations with an even number of plus signs is the same as that obtained by taking the odd permutations with an odd number of plus signs. Similarly, the mirror image has either an odd permutation with an even number of plus signs or an even permutation with an odd number of plus signs.  Surface area and volume  For a snub dodecahedron whose edge length is 1, the surface area is      A  =    20   3    +   3    25  +   10   5        ≈  55.28674495844515        A      20    3      3      25    10    5             55.28674495844515     A=20\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{25+10\sqrt{5}}\approx 55.28674495844515   and the volume is      V  =     12   ξ  2    (    3  ϕ   +  1   )    -   ξ   (    36  ϕ   +  7   )    -   (    53  ϕ   +  6   )     6     3  -   ξ  2     3     ≈  37.61664996273336        V        12   superscript  ξ  2       3  ϕ   1      ξ      36  ϕ   7        53  ϕ   6      6   superscript      3   superscript  ξ  2     3          37.61664996273336     V=\frac{12\xi^{2}(3\phi+1)-\xi(36\phi+7)-(53\phi+6)}{6\sqrt{3-\xi^{2}}^{3}}%
 \approx 37.61664996273336   where ϕ is the golden ratio .  The snub dodecahedron has the highest sphericity of all Archimedean solids.  Orthogonal projections  The ''snub dodecahedron '' has two special orthogonal projections , centered, on two types of faces: triangles, and pentagons, correspond to the A 2 and H 2  Coxeter planes .      Orthogonal projections     Centered by     Image     Projective symmetry     Dual image     Geometric relations  The snub dodecahedron can be generated by taking the twelve pentagonal faces of the dodecahedron and pulling them outward so they no longer touch. At a proper distance this can create the rhombicosidodecahedron by filling in square faces between the divided edges and triangle faces between the divided vertices. But for the snub form, only add the triangle faces and leave the square gaps empty. Then apply an equal rotation to the centers of the pentagons and triangles, continuing the rotation until the gaps can be filled by two equilateral triangles.      Dodecahedron   Rhombicosidodecahedron ( Expanded dodecahedron )   Snub dodecahedron     The snub dodecahedron can also be derived from the truncated icosidodecahedron by the process of alternation . Sixty of the vertices of the truncated icosidodecahedron form a polyhedron topologically equivalent to one snub dodecahedron; the remaining sixty form its mirror-image. The resulting polyhedron is vertex-transitive but not uniform, because its edges are of unequal lengths; some deformation is required to transform it into a uniform polyhedron.  Related polyhedra and tilings  This semiregular polyhedron is a member of a sequence of snubbed polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure (3.3.3.3. n ) and Coxeter–Dynkin diagram . These figures and their duals have (n32) rotational symmetry , being in the Euclidean plane for n=6, and hyperbolic plane for any higher n. The series can be considered to begin with n=2, with one set of faces degenerated into digons .  Snub dodecahedral graph  In the mathematical field of graph theory , a snub dodecahedral graph is the graph of vertices and edges of the snub dodecahedron, one of the Archimedean solids . It has 60 vertices and 150 edges, and is an Archimedean graph . 1      Orthogonal projections  (Figure)  Snub dodecahedron A2.png   (Figure)  Snub dodecahedron H2.png   (Figure)  Snub dodecahedron e1.png      {{-}}  See also   Planar polygon to polyhedron transformation animation  ccw and cw spinning snub dodecahedron   References     (Section 3-9)    External links        [ http://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/polyhedral-nets.html?net=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&name; ;=Snub+Dodecahedron#applet Editable printable net of a Snub Dodecahedron with interactive 3D view]  The Uniform Polyhedra  Virtual Reality Polyhedra The Encyclopedia of Polyhedra  The Snub Dodecahedron made with LEGO by Antonio Nicassio (ITALY)   "  Category:Chiral polyhedra  Category:Uniform polyhedra  Category:Archimedean solids  Category:Snub tilings     ↩
