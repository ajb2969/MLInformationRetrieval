Papyrus 22

Papyrus 22 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 

22, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of John, only containing extant John 15:25-16:2, 21-32. The manuscript has been paleographically assigned to the early 3rd century.1
Description
The text was written in two consecutive columns on a roll (rather than a codex). The reverse side is blank.2
 The manuscript employs conventional Nomina Sacra: 
 
 





 
 .
 The text contains no punctuation marks.3
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto-Alexandrian). Aland described it as a normal text and placed it in Category I.4 This manuscript displays an independent text.5 Coincidences with the Codex Sinaiticus are frequent, but divergences are noticeable.6 There are no singular readings.7 According to Schofield the fragment rather represents the eclecticism of the early papyri before the crystallizing of the textual families had taken place.8
It was digitized by the CSNTM in 2008.9
It is currently housed at the Glasgow University Library (MS Gen 1026) in Glasgow.1011
