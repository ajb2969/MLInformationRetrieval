   Papyrus 22      Papyrus 22   Papyrus 22 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    22 , is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek . It is a papyrus  manuscript of the Gospel of John , only containing extant John 15:25-16:2, 21-32. The manuscript has been paleographically assigned to the early 3rd century. 1  Description  The text was written in two consecutive columns on a roll (rather than a codex). The reverse side is blank. 2 The manuscript employs conventional Nomina Sacra :     Π  Σ   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Π  normal-Σ     \overline{ΠΣ}        Π  Ν  Α   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Π  normal-Ν  normal-Α     \overline{ΠΝΑ}        Π  Ρ  Σ   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Π  normal-Ρ  normal-Σ     \overline{ΠΡΣ}        Π  Ρ  Α   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Π  normal-Ρ  normal-Α     \overline{ΠΡΑ}        Ι  Η  Σ   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Ι  normal-Η  normal-Σ     \overline{ΙΗΣ}        Α  Ν  Ο  Σ   ¯     normal-¯    normal-Α  normal-Ν  normal-Ο  normal-Σ     \overline{ΑΝΟΣ}   . The text contains no punctuation marks. 3  The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type (rather proto-Alexandrian). Aland described it as a normal text and placed it in Category I . 4 This manuscript displays an independent text. 5 Coincidences with the Codex Sinaiticus are frequent, but divergences are noticeable. 6 There are no singular readings. 7 According to Schofield the fragment rather represents the eclecticism of the early papyri before the crystallizing of the textual families had taken place. 8  It was digitized by the CSNTM in 2008. 9  It is currently housed at the Glasgow University Library (MS Gen 1026) in Glasgow . 10 11  See also   List of New Testament papyri   References  Further reading   B.
