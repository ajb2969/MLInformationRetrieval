   Conformal radius      Conformal radius   In mathematics, the conformal radius is a way to measure the size of a simply connected planar domain D viewed from a point z in it. As opposed to notions using Euclidean distance (say, the radius of the largest inscribed disk with center z ), this notion is well-suited to use in complex analysis , in particular in conformal maps and conformal geometry .  A closely related notion is the transfinite diameter or (logarithmic) capacity of a compact simply connected set D , which can be considered as the inverse of the conformal radius of the complement  E = D c viewed from infinity .  Definition  Given a simply connected domain D ⊂ C , and a point z ∈ D , by the Riemann mapping theorem there exists a unique conformal map f : D → D onto the unit disk (usually referred to as the uniformizing map ) with f ( z ) = 0 ∈ D and f ′( z ) ∈ R + . The conformal radius of D from z is then defined as        rad   (  z  ,  D  )    :=    1    f  ′    (  z  )       .     assign    rad   z  D      1     superscript  f  normal-′   z      \mathrm{rad}(z,D):=\frac{1}{f^{\prime}(z)}\,.     The simplest example is that the conformal radius of the disk of radius r viewed from its center is also r , shown by the uniformizing map x ↦ x / r . See below for more examples.  One reason for the usefulness of this notion is that it behaves well under conformal maps: if φ : D → D ′ is a conformal bijection and z in D , then     rad   (   φ   (  z  )    ,   D  ′   )    =    |    φ  ′    (  z  )    |   rad   (  z  ,  D  )          rad     φ  z    superscript  D  normal-′            superscript  φ  normal-′   z    rad   z  D      \mathrm{rad}(\varphi(z),D^{\prime})=|\varphi^{\prime}(z)|\,\mathrm{rad}(z,D)   .  A special case: the upper-half plane  Let K ⊂ H be a subset of the upper half-plane such that D := H \ K is connected and simply connected, and let z ∈ D be a point. (This is a usual scenario, say, in the Schramm-Loewner evolution ). By the Riemann mapping theorem, there is a conformal bijection g : D → H . Then, for any such map g , a simple computation gives that        rad   (  z  ,  D  )    =      2   Im   (   g   (  z  )    )     |    g  ′    (  z  )    |      .        rad   z  D        2  Im    g  z         superscript  g  normal-′   z       \mathrm{rad}(z,D)=\frac{2\,\mathrm{Im}(g(z))}{|g^{\prime}(z)|}\,.     For example, when K = ∅ and z = i , then g can be the identity map, and we get rad( i , H ) = 2. Checking that this agrees with the original definition: the uniformizing map f : H → D is        f   (  z  )    =   i    z  -  i    z  +  i      ,        f  z     i      z  i     z  i       f(z)=i\frac{z-i}{z+i},     and then the derivative can be easily calculated.  Relation to inradius  That it is a good measure of radius is shown by the following immediate consequence of the Schwarz lemma and the Koebe 1/4 theorem : for z ∈ D ⊂ C ,         rad   (  z  ,  D  )    4   ≤   dist   (  z  ,   ∂  D   )    ≤   rad   (  z  ,  D  )     ,            rad   z  D    4     dist   z    D            rad   z  D       \frac{\mathrm{rad}(z,D)}{4}\leq\mathrm{dist}(z,\partial D)\leq\mathrm{rad}(z,D),     where dist( z , ∂ D ) denotes the Euclidean distance between z and the boundary of D , or in other words, the radius of the largest inscribed disk with center z .  Both inequalities are best possible:   The upper bound is clearly attained by taking D = D and z = 0.    The lower bound is attained by the following “slit domain”: D = C \ R + and z = − r ∈ R − . The square root map φ takes D onto the upper half-plane H , with     φ   (   -  r   )    =   i   r          φ    r      i    r      \varphi(-r)=i\sqrt{r}   and derivative     |    φ  ′    (   -  r   )    |   =   1   2   r              superscript  φ  normal-′     r       1    2    r       |\varphi^{\prime}(-r)|=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{r}}   . The above formula for the upper half-plane gives     rad   (   i   r    ,  ℍ  )    =   2   r          rad     i    r    ℍ      2    r      \mathrm{rad}(i\sqrt{r},\mathbb{H})=2\sqrt{r}   , and then the formula for transformation under conformal maps gives rad(− r , D ) = 4 r , while, of course, dist(− r , ∂ D ) = r .   Version from infinity: transfinite diameter and logarithmic capacity  When D ⊂ C is a simply connected compact set, then its complement E = D c is a simply connected domain in the Riemann sphere that contains ∞, and one can define        rad   (  ∞  ,  D  )    :=   1   rad   (  ∞  ,  E  )     :=    lim   z  →  ∞      f   (  z  )    z     ,       assign    rad    D      1    rad    E       assign      subscript    normal-→  z         f  z   z       \mathrm{rad}(\infty,D):=\frac{1}{\mathrm{rad}(\infty,E)}:=\lim_{z\to\infty}%
 \frac{f(z)}{z},     where f : C \ D → E is the unique bijective conformal map with f(∞) = ∞ and that limit being positive real, i.e., the conformal map of the form         f   (  z  )    =     c  1   z   +   c  0   +    c   -  1     z   -  1     +  …    ,    c  1   ∈   𝐑  +     .     formulae-sequence      f  z        subscript  c  1   z    subscript  c  0      subscript  c    1     superscript  z    1     normal-…       subscript  c  1    subscript  𝐑       f(z)=c_{1}z+c_{0}+c_{-1}z^{-1}+\dots,\qquad c_{1}\in\mathbf{R}_{+}.     The coefficient c 1 = rad(∞, D ) equals the transfinite diameter and the (logarithmic) capacity of D ; see Chapter 11 of  and . See also the article on the capacity of a set .  The coefficient c 0 is called the conformal center of D . It can be shown to lie in the convex hull of D ; moreover,       D  ⊆   {  z  :    |   z  -   c  0    |   ≤   2   c  1     }    ,      D   conditional-set  z        z   subscript  c  0       2   subscript  c  1        D\subseteq\{z:|z-c_{0}|\leq 2c_{1}\}\,,     where the radius 2 c 1 is sharp for the straight line segment of length 4 c 1 . See pages 12–13 and Chapter 11 of .  The Fekete, Chebyshev and modified Chebyshev constants  We define three other quantities that are equal to the transfinite diameter even though they are defined from a very different point of view. Let        d  n    (  D  )    :=    sup     z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n    ∈  D     d    (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n   )    1   (     n      2     )          assign     subscript  d  n   D     subscript  supremum      subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n    D      d   superscript    subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n      1   binomial  n  2         d_{n}(D):=\sup_{z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}\in D}d(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n})^{\frac{1}{{\left%
 ({{n}\atop{2}}\right)}}}   and let us define the following quantity for a compact set D ⊂ C :       d  n    (  D  )        subscript  d  n   D    d_{n}(D)     In other words,     d   (  D  )    :=    lim   n  →  ∞      d  n    (  D  )        assign    d  D     subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  d  n   D      d(D):=\lim_{n\to\infty}d_{n}(D)   is the supremum of the geometric mean of pairwise distances of n points in D . Since D is compact, this supremum is actually attained by a set of points. Any such n -point set is called a Fekete set .  The limit    𝒫  n     subscript  𝒫  n    \mathcal{P}_{n}   exists and it is called the Fekete constant .  Now let    𝒬  n     subscript  𝒬  n    \mathcal{Q}_{n}   denote the set of all monic polynomials of degree n in C [ x ], let    𝒫  n     subscript  𝒫  n    \mathcal{P}_{n}   denote the set of polynomials in      μ  n    (  D  )    :=    inf   p  ∈  𝒫      sup   z  ∈  D     |   p   (  z  )    |        assign     subscript  μ  n   D     subscript  infimum    p  𝒫      subscript  supremum    z  D        p  z        \mu_{n}(D):=\inf_{p\in\mathcal{P}}\sup_{z\in D}|p(z)|   with all zeros in D and let us define         μ  ~   n    (  D  )    :=    inf   p  ∈  𝒬      sup   z  ∈  D     |   p   (  z  )    |        assign     subscript   normal-~  μ   n   D     subscript  infimum    p  𝒬      subscript  supremum    z  D        p  z        \tilde{\mu}_{n}(D):=\inf_{p\in\mathcal{Q}}\sup_{z\in D}|p(z)|   and     μ   (  D  )    :=    lim   n  →  ∞      μ  n     (  D  )    1  n         assign    μ  D     subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  μ  n    superscript  D    1  n        \mu(D):=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu_{n}(D)^{\frac{1}{n}}     Then the limits       μ   (  D  )    :=    lim   n  →  ∞       μ  ~   n     (  D  )    1  n         assign    μ  D     subscript    normal-→  n        subscript   normal-~  μ   n    superscript  D    1  n        \mu(D):=\lim_{n\to\infty}\tilde{\mu}_{n}(D)^{\frac{1}{n}}   and $\mu(D):=\lim_{n\to\infty} \tilde{\mu}_n(D)^\frac1n$  exist and they are called the Chebyshev constant and modified Chebyshev constant , respectively. Michael Fekete and Gábor Szegő proved that these constants are equal.  Applications  The conformal radius is a very useful tool, e.g., when working with the Schramm-Loewner evolution .
