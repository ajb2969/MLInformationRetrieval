   Pentagonal polytope      Pentagonal polytope   In geometry , a pentagonal polytope is a regular polytope in n dimensions constructed from the H n Coxeter group . The family was named by H. S. M. Coxeter , because the two-dimensional pentagonal polytope is a pentagon . It can be named by its Schläfli symbol as {5, 3 n − 2 } (dodecahedral) or {3 n − 2 , 5} (icosahedral).  Family members  The family starts as 1-polytopes and ends with n = 5 as infinite tessellations of 4-dimensional hyperbolic space.  There are two types of pentagonal polytopes; they may be termed the dodecahedral and icosahedral types, by their three-dimensional members. The two types are duals of each other.  Dodecahedral  The complete family of dodecahedral pentagonal polytopes are:   Line segment , { }  Pentagon , {5}  Dodecahedron , {5, 3} (12 pentagonal faces)  120-cell , {5, 3, 3} (120 dodecahedral cells)  Order-3 120-cell honeycomb , {5, 3, 3, 3} (tessellates hyperbolic 4-space (∞ 120-cell facets)   The facets of each dodecahedral pentagonal polytope are the dodecahedral pentagonal polytopes of one less dimension. Their vertex figures are the simplices of one less dimension.      Dodecahedral pentagonal polytopes     n     Vertices     1     2     3     4     5     Icosahedral  The complete family of icosahedral pentagonal polytopes are:   Line segment , { }  Pentagon , {5}  Icosahedron , {3, 5} (20 triangular faces)  600-cell , {3, 3, 5} (120 tetrahedron cells)  Order-5 5-cell honeycomb , {3, 3, 3, 5} (tessellates hyperbolic 4-space (∞ 5-cell facets)   The facets of each icosahedral pentagonal polytope are the simplices of one less dimension. Their vertex figures are icosahedral pentagonal polytopes of one less dimension.      Icosahedral pentagonal polytopes     n     Vertices     1     2     3     4     5     Related star polytopes and honeycombs  The pentagonal polytopes can be stellated to form new star regular polytopes :   In three dimensions, this forms the four Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra , { 3,5/2 }, { 5/2,3 }, { 5,5/2 }, and { 5/2,5 }.  In four dimensions, this forms the ten Schläfli–Hess polychora : { 3,5,5/2 }, { 5/2,5,3 }, { 5,5/2,5 }, { 5,3,5/2 }, { 5/2,3,5 }, { 5/2,5,5/2 }, { 5,5/2,3 }, { 3,5/2,5 }, { 3,3,5/2 }, and { 5/2,3,3 }.  In four-dimensional hyperbolic space there are four regular star-honeycombs : {5/2,5,3,3} , {3,3,5,5/2} , {3,5,5/2,5} , and {5,5/2,5,3} .
