   Abscisic-aldehyde oxidase      Abscisic-aldehyde oxidase   In enzymology , an abscisic-aldehyde oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   abscisic aldehyde + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   abscisate + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are abscisic aldehyde , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its two products are abscisate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is abscisic-aldehyde:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include abscisic aldehyde oxidase , AAO3 , AOd , and AOdelta . This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis - general .  References       "  Category:EC 1.2.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
