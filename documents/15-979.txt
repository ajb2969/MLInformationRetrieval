   Nitrate reductase (quinone)      Nitrate reductase (quinone)   Nitrate reductase ( quinone ) (, nitrate reductase A , nitrate reductase Z , quinol/nitrate oxidoreductase , quinol-nitrate oxidoreductase , quinol:nitrate oxidoreductase , NarA , NarZ , NarGHI ) is an enzyme with system name nitrite:quinone oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   nitrate + a quinol    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    nitrite + a quinone + H 2 O   This is a membrane-bound enzyme which supports [anaerobic respiration] on nitrate.
