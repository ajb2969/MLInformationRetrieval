   Swastika curve      Swastika curve   The swastika curve is the name given by Cundy and Rollett 1 to the quartic  plane curve with the Cartesian equation         y  4   -   x  4    =   x  y    ,         superscript  y  4    superscript  x  4      x  y     y^{4}-x^{4}=xy,\,     or, equivalently, the polar equation       r  2   =   -    tan   (   2  θ   )    /   2.          superscript  r  2           2  θ    2.      r^{2}=-\tan(2\theta)/2.\,     The curve looks similar to the right-handed swastika , but can be inverted with respect to a unit circle to resemble a left-handed swastika. The Cartesian equation then becomes         x  4   -   y  4    =   x  y    .         superscript  x  4    superscript  y  4      x  y     x^{4}-y^{4}=xy.\,       External links   Mathworld Article   "  Category:Curves     Mathematical Models by H.
