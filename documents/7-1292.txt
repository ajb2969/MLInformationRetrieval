Biconjugate gradient method

In mathematics, more specifically in numerical linear algebra, the biconjugate gradient method is an algorithm to solve systems of linear equations



Unlike the conjugate gradient method, this algorithm does not require the matrix

 
  to be self-adjoint, but instead one needs to perform multiplications by the conjugate transpose .
The algorithm

Choose initial guess 
 
 
 
 , two other vectors 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and a preconditioner














for 
 
 
 
  do
 


























In the above formulation, the computed 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy






and thus are the respective residuals corresponding to 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , as approximate solutions to the systems






 
  is the adjoint, and 
 
 
 
 
  is the complex conjugate.
Unpreconditioned version of the algorithm

Discussion
The biconjugate gradient method is numerically unstable (compare to the biconjugate gradient stabilized method), but very important from a theoretical point of view. Define the iteration steps by






where 
 
 

with






These related projections may be iterated themselves as



A relation to Quasi-Newton methods is given by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where



The new directions






are then orthogonal to the residuals:






which themselves satisfy






where 
 
 




With this particular choice, explicit evaluations of 
 
 
 
  and  are avoided, and the algorithm takes the form stated above.
Properties

The sequences produced by the algorithm are biorthogonal, i.e.,
