   Pole (complex analysis)      Pole (complex analysis)   In the mathematical field of complex analysis , a pole of a meromorphic function is a certain type of singularity that behaves like the singularity of    1   z  n       1   superscript  z  n     \frac{1}{z^{n}}   at z = 0. For a pole of the function f ( z ) at point a the function approaches infinity as z approaches a .  Definition  Formally, suppose U is an open subset of the complex plane  C , a is an element of U and f : U \ { a } → C is a function which is holomorphic over its domain. If there exists a holomorphic function g : U → C , such that g(a) is nonzero, and a positive integer n , such that for all z in U \ { a }       f   (  z  )    =    g   (  z  )      (   z  -  a   )   n          f  z       g  z    superscript    z  a   n      f(z)=\frac{g(z)}{(z-a)^{n}}   holds, then a is called a pole of f . The smallest such n is called the order of the pole . A pole of order 1 is called a simple pole .  A few authors allow the order of a pole to be zero, in which case a pole of order zero is either a regular point or a removable singularity . However, it is more usual to require the order of a pole to be positive.  From above several equivalent characterizations can be deduced:  If n is the order of pole a , then necessarily g ( a ) ≠ 0 for the function g in the above expression. So we can put       f   (  z  )    =   1   h   (  z  )           f  z     1    h  z      f(z)=\frac{1}{h(z)}     for some h that is holomorphic in an open neighborhood of a and has a zero of order n at a . So informally one might say that poles occur as reciprocals of zeros of holomorphic functions.  Also, by the holomorphy of g , f can be expressed as:        f   (  z  )    =     a   -  n      (   z  -  a   )   n    +  ⋯  +    a   -  1     (   z  -  a   )    +    ∑    k   ≥  0      a  k     (   z  -  a   )   k       .        f  z        subscript  a    n     superscript    z  a   n    normal-⋯     subscript  a    1      z  a      subscript     k  0       subscript  a  k    superscript    z  a   k        f(z)=\frac{a_{-n}}{(z-a)^{n}}+\cdots+\frac{a_{-1}}{(z-a)}+\sum_{k\,\geq\,0}a_{%
 k}(z-a)^{k}.     This is a Laurent series with finite principal part . The holomorphic function     ∑    k   ≥  0      a  k     (    z   -  a   )   k        subscript     k  0       subscript  a  k    superscript    z  a   k      \scriptstyle\sum_{k\,\geq\,0}a_{k}(z\,-\,a)^{k}   (on U ) is called the regular part of f . So the point a is a pole of order n of f if and only if all the terms in the Laurent series expansion of f around a below degree − n vanish and the term in degree − n is not zero.  Pole at infinity  A complex function can be defined as having a pole at the point at infinity . In this case U has to be a neighborhood of infinity, such as the exterior of any closed ball. To use the previous definition, a meaning for g being holomorphic at ∞ is needed. Alternately, a definition can be given starting from the definition at a finite point by suitably mapping the point at infinity to a finite point. The map    z  ↦    1  z       maps-to  z    1  z     \scriptstyle z\mapsto\frac{1}{z}   does that. Then, by definition, a function f holomorphic in a neighborhood of infinity has a pole at infinity if the function    f   (    1  z    )       f    1  z     \scriptstyle f(\frac{1}{z})   (which will be holomorphic in a neighborhood of    z  =  0      z  0    \scriptstyle z=0   ), has a pole at    z  =  0      z  0    \scriptstyle z=0   , the order of which will be regarded as the order of the pole of f at infinity.  Pole of a function on a complex manifold  In general, having a function    f  :    M   →  ℂ      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  ℂ     \scriptstyle f:\;M\,\rightarrow\,\mathbb{C}   that is holomorphic in a neighborhood,   U   U   \scriptstyle U   , of the point   a   a   \scriptstyle a   , in the complex manifold  M , it is said that f has a pole at a of order n if, having a chart     ϕ  :    U   →  ℂ      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  U  ℂ     \scriptstyle\phi:\;U\,\rightarrow\,\mathbb{C}   , the function      f   ∘   ϕ   -  1     :    ℂ   →  ℂ      normal-:    f   superscript  ϕ    1      normal-→  ℂ  ℂ     \scriptstyle f\,\circ\,\phi^{-1}:\;\mathbb{C}\,\rightarrow\,\mathbb{C}   has a pole of order n at    ϕ   (  a  )       ϕ  a    \scriptstyle\phi(a)   (which can be taken as being zero if a convenient choice of the chart is made). ] The pole at infinity is the simplest nontrivial example of this definition in which M is taken to be the Riemann sphere and the chart is taken to be     ϕ   (  z  )    =    1  z          ϕ  z     1  z     \scriptstyle\phi(z)\,=\,\frac{1}{z}   .  Examples   The function          f   (  z  )    =   3  z         f  z     3  z     f(z)=\frac{3}{z}         has a pole of order 1 or simple pole at    z  =  0      z  0    z=0   .    The function          f   (  z  )    =    z  +  2      (   z  -  5   )   2     (   z  +  7   )   3           f  z       z  2      superscript    z  5   2    superscript    z  7   3       f(z)=\frac{z+2}{(z-5)^{2}(z+7)^{3}}         has a pole of order 2 at    z  =  5      z  5    z=5   and a pole of order 3 at    z  =   -  7       z    7     z=-7   .    The function          f   (  z  )    =    z  -  4     e  z   -  1          f  z       z  4      superscript  e  z   1      f(z)=\frac{z-4}{e^{z}-1}         has poles of order 1 at       z   =   2  π  n  i  for   n    =  …   ,    -  1   ,  0  ,  1  ,  …    .     formulae-sequence      z    2  π  n  i  for  n        normal-…       1   0  1  normal-…     z\,=\,2\pi ni\text{ for }n\,=\,\dots,\,-1,\,0,\,1,\,\dots.   To see that, write    e  z     superscript  e  z    e^{z}   in Taylor series around the origin.    The function          f   (  z  )    =  z        f  z   z    f(z)=z         has a single pole at infinity of order 1.   Terminology and generalizations  If the first derivative of a function f has a simple pole at a , then a is a branch point of f . (The converse need not be true).  A non-removable singularity that is not a pole or a branch point is called an essential singularity .  A complex function which is holomorphic except for some isolated singularities and whose only singularities are poles is called meromorphic .
