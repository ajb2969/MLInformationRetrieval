   Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating)      Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating)   In enzymology , a malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-oxopropanoate + CoA + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl-CoA + CO 2 + NAD(P)H   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 3-oxopropanoate , CoA , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are acetyl-CoA , CO 2 , NADH , and NADPH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxopropanoate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating, CoA-acetylating) . This enzyme is also called malonic semialdehyde oxidative decarboxylase . This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways : inositol metabolism , alanine and aspartate metabolism , beta-alanine metabolism , and propanoate metabolism .
