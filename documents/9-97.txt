In optics and especially laser science, the Rayleigh length or Rayleigh range is the distance along the propagation direction of a beam from the waist to the place where the area of the cross section is doubled.1 A related parameter is the confocal parameter, b, which is twice the Rayleigh length.2 The Rayleigh length is particularly important when beams are modeled as Gaussian beams.
Explanation
For a Gaussian beam propagating in free space along the $\hat{z}$ axis, the Rayleigh length is given by 3
$$z_\mathrm{R} = \frac{\pi w_0^2}{\lambda} ,$$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $w_0$ is the beam waist, the radial size of the beam at its narrowest point. This equation and those that follow assume that the waist is not extraordinarily small; $w_0 \ge 2\lambda/\pi$.4
The radius of the beam at a distance $z$ from the waist is 5
$$w(z) = w_0 \, \sqrt{ 1+ {\left( \frac{z}{z_\mathrm{R}} \right)}^2 }  .$$
The minimum value of $w(z)$ occurs at $w(0) = w_0$, by definition. At distance $z_\mathrm{R}$ from the beam waist, the beam radius is increased by a factor $\sqrt{2}$ and the cross sectional area by 2.
Related quantities
The total angular spread of a Gaussian beam in radians is related to the Rayleigh length by6
$$\Theta_{\mathrm{div}} \simeq 2\frac{w_0}{z_R}.$$
The diameter of the beam at its waist (focus spot size) is given by
$$D = 2\,w_0 \simeq \frac{4\lambda}{\pi\, \Theta_{\mathrm{div}}}$$.
These equations are valid within the limits of the paraxial approximation. For beams with much larger divergence the Gaussian beam model is no longer accurate and a physical optics analysis is required.
