   23S rRNA (adenine1618-N6)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (adenine1618-N6)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (adenine 1618 -N 6 )-methyltransferase (, rRNA large subunit methyltransferase F , YbiN protein , rlmF (gene) , m6A1618 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (adenine 1618 -N 6 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 1618 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 6 - methyladenine 1618 in 23S rRNA   The recombinant YbiN protein is able to methylate partially deproteinized 50 S ribosomal subunit.
