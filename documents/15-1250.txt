23S rRNA (adenine1618-N6)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (adenine1618-N6)-methyltransferase (, rRNA large subunit methyltransferase F, YbiN protein, rlmF (gene), m6A1618 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (adenine1618-N6)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine1618 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N6-methyladenine1618 in 23S rRNA
 

The recombinant YbiN protein is able to methylate partially deproteinized 50 S ribosomal subunit.
