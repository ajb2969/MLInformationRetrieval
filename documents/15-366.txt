Mingarelli identity

In the field of ordinary differential equations, the Mingarelli identity (coined by Philip Hartman1) is a theorem that provides criteria for the oscillation and non-oscillation of solutions of some linear differential equations in the real domain. It extends the Picone identity from two to three or more differential equations of the second order. Its most basic form appears here.
The identity
Consider the 
 
 
 
  solutions of the following (uncoupled) system of second order linear differential equations over the t-interval [a, b]. 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the forward difference operator, i.e., 
 
 
 
  The second order difference operator is found by iterating the first order operator as in 
 
 
 
 , with a similar definition for the higher iterates.
Leaving out the independent variable t for convenience, and assuming the 
 
 
 
  on (a, b], there holds the identity,2



where 
 
 
 
 
  is a logarithmic derivative, 
 
 
 
 , is a Wronskian and the 
 
 
 
  are binomial coefficients. When 
 
 
 
  this reduces to the Picone identity.
The above identity leads quickly to the following comparison theorem for three linear differential equations,3 extending the Sturm–Picone comparison theorem.
Let 
 
 
i = 1, 2, 3 be real-valued continuous functions on the interval [a, b] and let











be three homogeneous linear second order differential equations in self-adjoint form with


 
  for each i and for all t in [a, b], and where the 
 
 
 
  are arbitrary real numbers.
Assume that for all t in [a, b] we have,


 
 ,


 
 ,


 
 . If 
 
 
 
  on [a, b], and 
 
 
 
 , then any solution 
 
 
 
 
  has at least one zero in [a, b].
