}} In probability theory and directional statistics, a wrapped exponential distribution is a wrapped probability distribution that results from the "wrapping" of the exponential distribution around the unit circle.
Definition
The probability density function of the wrapped exponential distribution is1



for 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the rate parameter of the unwrapped distribution. This is identical to the truncated distribution obtained by restricting observed values X from the exponential distribution with rate parameter λ to the range 
 
 
 
 .
Characteristic function
The characteristic function of the wrapped exponential is just the characteristic function of the exponential function evaluated at integer arguments:



which yields an alternate expression for the wrapped exponential PDF:



Circular moments
In terms of the circular variable 
 
 
 
  the circular moments of the wrapped exponential distribution are the characteristic function of the exponential distribution evaluated at integer arguments:



where 
 
 
 
  is some interval of length 
 
 
 
 . The first moment is then the average value of z, also known as the mean resultant, or mean resultant vector:



The mean angle is



and the length of the mean resultant is



Characterisation
The wrapped exponential distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for distributions restricted to the range 
 
 
 
  for a fixed value of the expectation
