(S)-3-hydroxyacid-ester dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a (S)-3-hydroxyacid-ester dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ethyl (S)-3-hydroxyhexanoate + NADP+

 
  ethyl 3-oxohexanoate + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ethyl (S)-3-hydroxyhexanoate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are ethyl 3-oxohexanoate, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ethyl-(S)-3-hydroxyhexanoate:NADP+ 3-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called 3-oxo ester (S)-reductase.
