   TRNA-queuosine beta-mannosyltransferase      TRNA-queuosine beta-mannosyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA-queuosine beta-mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + tRNAAsp-queuosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + tRNAAsp-O-5"-beta-D-mannosylqueuosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and tRNAAsp-queuosine , whereas its two products are GDP and tRNAAsp-O-5''-beta-D-mannosylqueuosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose:tRNAAsp-queuosine O-5"-beta-D-mannosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
