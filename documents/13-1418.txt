   Nash blowing-up      Nash blowing-up   In algebraic geometry , a Nash blowing-up is a process in which, roughly speaking, each singular point is replaced by all the limiting positions of the tangent spaces at the non-singular points. Strictly speaking, if X is an algebraic variety of pure codimension  r  embedded in a smooth variety of dimension n ,    Sing   (  X  )       Sing  X    \text{Sing}(X)   denotes the set of its singular points and     X  reg   :=   X  ∖   Sing   (  X  )        assign   subscript  X  reg     X    Sing  X      X_{\text{reg}}:=X\setminus\text{Sing}(X)   it is possible to define a map    τ  :    X  reg   →   X  ×   G  r  n        normal-:  τ   normal-→   subscript  X  reg     X   superscript   subscript  G  r   n       \tau:X_{\text{reg}}\rightarrow X\times G_{r}^{n}   , where    G  r  n     superscript   subscript  G  r   n    G_{r}^{n}   is the Grassmannian of r -planes in n -space, by     τ   (  a  )    :=   (  a  ,   T   X  ,  a    )      assign    τ  a    a   subscript  T   X  a       \tau(a):=(a,T_{X,a})   , where    T   X  ,  a      subscript  T   X  a     T_{X,a}   is the tangent space of X at a . Now, the closure of the image of this map together with the projection to X is called the Nash blowing-up of X .  Although (to emphasize its geometric interpretation) an embedding was used to define the Nash embedding it is possible to prove that it doesn't depend on it.  Properties   The Nash blowing-up is locally a monoidal transformation .  If X is a complete intersection defined by the vanishing of     f  1   ,   f  2   ,  …  ,   f   n  -  r        subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2   normal-…   subscript  f    n  r      f_{1},f_{2},\ldots,f_{n-r}   then the Nash blowing-up is the blowing-up with center given by the ideal generated by the ( n − r )-minors of the matrix with entries     ∂   f  i    /   ∂   x  j           subscript  f  i       subscript  x  j      \partial f_{i}/\partial x_{j}   .  For a variety over a field of characteristic zero, the Nash blowing-up is an isomorphism if and only if X is non-singular.  For an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero the application of Nash blowings-up leads to desingularization after a finite number of steps.  In characteristic q > 0, for the curve      y  2   -   x  q    =  0         superscript  y  2    superscript  x  q    0    y^{2}-x^{q}=0   the Nash blowing-up is the monoidal transformation with center given by the ideal    (   x  q   )     superscript  x  q    (x^{q})   , for q = 2, or    (   y  2   )     superscript  y  2    (y^{2})   , for    q  >  2      q  2    q>2   . Since the center is a hypersurface the blowing-up is an isomorphism. Then the two previous points are not true in positive characteristic.
