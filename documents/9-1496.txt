   Conditional variance      Conditional variance   In probability theory and statistics , a conditional variance is the variance of a conditional probability distribution . That is, it is the variance of a random variable given the value(s) of one or more other variables. Particularly in econometrics , the conditional variance is also known as the scedastic function or skedastic function . Conditional variances are important parts of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models.  Definition  The conditional variance of a random variable  Y given that the value of a random variable X takes the value x is        Var   (  Y  |   X  =  x   )    =   E   (    (   Y  -   E   (  Y  ∣   X  =  x   )     )   2   ∣   X  =  x   )     ,       Var  Y    X  x     normal-E   superscript    Y   normal-E  Y    X  x     2     X  x      \operatorname{Var}(Y|X=x)=\operatorname{E}((Y-\operatorname{E}(Y\mid X=x))^{2}%
 \mid X=x),     where E is the conditional expectation , i.e. the expectation operator with respect to the conditional distribution of Y given that the X takes the value x . An alternative notation for this is      Var   Y  ∣  X     (  Y  |  x  )    .      subscript  Var   fragments  Y  normal-∣  X    Y  x    \operatorname{Var}_{Y\mid X}(Y|x).     The above may be stated in the alternative form that, based on the conditional distribution of Y given that the X takes the value x , the conditional variance is the variance of this probability distribution .  Components of variance  The law of total variance says        Var   (  Y  )    =     E  X    (   Var   (  Y  ∣  X  )    )    +    Var  X    (   E   (  Y  ∣  X  )    )      ,       Var  Y       subscript  normal-E  X    Var  Y  X      subscript  Var  X    normal-E  Y  X       \operatorname{Var}(Y)=\operatorname{E}_{X}(\operatorname{Var}(Y\mid X))+%
 \operatorname{Var}_{X}(\operatorname{E}(Y\mid X)),     where, for example,    Var   (  Y  |  X  )      Var  Y  X    \operatorname{Var}(Y|X)   is understood to mean that the value x at which the conditional variance would be evaluated is allowed to be a random variable , X . In this "law", the inner expectation or variance is taken with respect to Y conditional on X , while the outer expectation or variance is taken with respect to X . This expression represents the overall variance of Y as the sum of two components, involving a prediction of Y based on X . Specifically, let the predictor be the least-mean-squares prediction based on X , which is the conditional expectation of Y given X . Then the two components are:  :*the average of the variance of Y about the prediction based on X , as X varies;  :*the variance of the prediction based on X , as X varies.
