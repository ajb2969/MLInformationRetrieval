Stipitatonate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a stipitatonate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

stipitatonate 
 
 
 
  stipitatate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, stipitatonate, and two products, stipitatate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is stipitatonate carboxy-lyase (decyclizing, stipitatate-forming). This enzyme is also called stipitatonate carboxy-lyase (decyclizing).
