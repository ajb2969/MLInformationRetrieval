   Stipitatonate decarboxylase      Stipitatonate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a stipitatonate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   stipitatonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   stipitatate + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , stipitatonate , and two products , stipitatate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is stipitatonate carboxy-lyase (decyclizing, stipitatate-forming) . This enzyme is also called stipitatonate carboxy-lyase (decyclizing) .
