Davenport constant

In mathematics, the Davenport constant of a group determines how large a sequence of elements can be without containing a subsequence of elements which sum to zero. Its determination is an example of a zero-sum problem.
In general, a finite abelian group G is considered. The Davenport constant D(G) is the smallest integer d such that every sequence of elements of G of length d contains a non-empty subsequence with sum equal to the zero element of G.1
Examples

The Davenport constant for the cyclic group G = Z/n is n.
If G is a p-group,








then
 
 




Properties

For a finite abelian group








with invariant factors

 
 , it is possible to find a sequence of 
 
 
 
  elements without a zero sum subsequence, so
 
 





It is known that D = M for p-groups and for r=1 or 2.
There are infinitely many examples with r at least 4 where D does not equal M; it is not known whether there are any with r = 3.2
