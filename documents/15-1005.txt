   Davenport constant      Davenport constant   In mathematics, the Davenport constant of a group determines how large a sequence of elements can be without containing a subsequence of elements which sum to zero. Its determination is an example of a zero-sum problem .  In general, a finite abelian group  G is considered. The Davenport constant D ( G ) is the smallest integer d such that every sequence of elements of G of length d contains a non-empty subsequence with sum equal to the zero element of G . 1  Examples   The Davenport constant for the cyclic group  G = Z / n is n .  If G is a p -group ,         G  =    ⊕  i    C   p   e  i          G    subscript  direct-sum  i    subscript  C   superscript  p   subscript  e  i        G=\oplus_{i}C_{p^{e_{i}}}       then       D   (  G  )    =   1  +    ∑  i    (    p   e  i    -  1   )      .        D  G     1    subscript   i      superscript  p   subscript  e  i    1       D(G)=1+\sum_{i}\left({p^{e_{i}}-1}\right)\ .       Properties   For a finite abelian group         G  =    ⊕  i    C   d  i         G    subscript  direct-sum  i    subscript  C   subscript  d  i       G=\oplus_{i}C_{d_{i}}       with invariant factors      d  1   |   d  2   |  ⋯  |   d  r      fragments   subscript  d  1   normal-|   subscript  d  2   normal-|  normal-⋯  normal-|   subscript  d  r     d_{1}|d_{2}|\cdots|d_{r}   , it is possible to find a sequence of     ∑  i    (    d  i   -  1   )       subscript   i      subscript  d  i   1     \sum_{i}(d_{i}-1)   elements without a zero sum subsequence, so       D   (  G  )    ≥   M   (  G  )    =    1  -  r   +    ∑  i     d  i       .          D  G     M  G            1  r     subscript   i    subscript  d  i        D(G)\geq M(G)=1-r+\sum_{i}d_{i}\ .        It is known that D = M for p -groups and for r =1 or 2.  There are infinitely many examples with r at least 4 where D does not equal M ; it is not known whether there are any with r = 3. 2   References       External links      "  Category:Sumsets      Bhowmik & Schlage-Puchta (2007) ↩
