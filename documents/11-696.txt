   Creatininase      Creatininase   In enzymology , a creatininase () is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of creatinine to creatine , which can then be metabolised to urea and sarcosine by creatinase .   creatinine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   creatine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are creatinine and H 2 O , whereas its product is creatine .  Creatininase is a member of the urease -related amidohydrolases , 1 the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is creatinine amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called creatinine hydrolase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  Structural studies  Creatininase from Pseudomonas putida has a core structure consisting of 3-layers, alpha/beta/alpha. 2  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
