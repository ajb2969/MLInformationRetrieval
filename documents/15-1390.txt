Pseudotropine acyltransferase

Pseudotropine acyltransferase (, pseudotropine:acyl-CoA transferase, tigloyl-CoA:pseudotropine acyltransferase, acetyl-CoA:pseudotropine acyltransferase, pseudotropine acetyltransferase, pseudotropine tigloyltransferase, PAT) is an enzyme with system name acyl-CoA:pseudotropine O-acyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + pseudotropine 
 
 
 
  CoA + O-acylpseudotropine


This enzyme exhibits absolute specificity for the exo/3beta configuration found in pseudotropine as tropine (tropan-3alpha-ol).
