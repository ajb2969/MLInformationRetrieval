   Essential extension      Essential extension   In mathematics , specifically module theory , given a ring  R and R - modules  M with a submodule N , the module M is said to be an essential extension of N (or N is said to be an essential submodule or large submodule of M ) if for every submodule H of M ,       H  ∩  N   =   {  0  }         H  N    0     H\cap N=\{0\}\,   implies that    H  =   {  0  }       H   0     H=\{0\}\,     As a special case, an essential left ideal of R is a left ideal which is essential as a submodule of the left module R R . The left ideal has non-zero intersection with any non-zero left ideal of R . Analogously, and essential right ideal is exactly an essential submodule of the right R module R R  The usual notations for essential extensions include the following two expressions:      N   ⊆  e    M       subscript   e   N  M    N\subseteq_{e}M\,   , and    N  ⊴  M      N  normal-⊴  M    N\trianglelefteq M     The dual notion of an essential submodule is that of superfluous submodule (or small submodule ). A submodule N is superfluous if for any other submodule H ,       N  +  H   =   M         N  H   M    N+H=M\,   implies that    H  =   M       H  M    H=M\,   .  The usual notations for superfluous submodules include:      N   ⊆  s    M       subscript   s   N  M    N\subseteq_{s}M\,   , and    N  ≪  M     much-less-than  N  M    N\ll M     Properties  Here are some of the elementary properties of essential extensions, given in the notation introduced above. Let M be a module, and K , N and H be submodules of M with K    ⊂     \subset    N   Clearly M is an essential submodule of M , and the zero submodule of a nonzero module is never essential.      K   ⊆  e   M      subscript   e   K  M    K\subseteq_{e}M   if and only if    K   ⊆  e   N      subscript   e   K  N    K\subseteq_{e}N   and    N   ⊆  e   M      subscript   e   N  M    N\subseteq_{e}M          K  ∩  H    ⊆  e   M      subscript   e     K  H   M    K\cap H\subseteq_{e}M   if and only if    K   ⊆  e   M      subscript   e   K  M    K\subseteq_{e}M   and    H   ⊆  e   M      subscript   e   H  M    H\subseteq_{e}M      Using Zorn's Lemma it is possible to prove another useful fact: For any submodule N of M , there exists a submodule C such that       N  ⊕  C    ⊆  e   M      subscript   e    direct-sum  N  C   M    N\oplus C\subseteq_{e}M   .  Furthermore, a module with no proper essential extension (that is, if the module is essential in another module, then it is equal to that module) is an injective module . It is then possible to prove that every module M has a maximal essential extension E ( M ), called the injective hull of M . The injective hull is necessarily an injective module, and is unique up to isomorphism. The injective hull is also minimal in the sense that any other injective module containing M contains a copy of E ( M ).  Many properties dualize to superfluous submodules, but not everything. Again with let M be a module, and K , N and H be submodules of M with K subset N .   The zero submodule is always superfluous, and a nonzero module M is never superfluous in itself.      N   ⊆  s   M      subscript   s   N  M    N\subseteq_{s}M   if and only if    K   ⊆  s   M      subscript   s   K  M    K\subseteq_{s}M   and     N  /  K    ⊆  s    M  /  K       subscript   s     N  K     M  K     N/K\subseteq_{s}M/K          K  +  H    ⊆  s   M      subscript   s     K  H   M    K+H\subseteq_{s}M   if and only if    K   ⊆  s   M      subscript   s   K  M    K\subseteq_{s}M   and    H   ⊆  s   M      subscript   s   H  M    H\subseteq_{s}M   .   Since every module can be mapped via a monomorphism whose image is essential in an injective module (its injective hull), one might ask if the dual statement is true, i.e. for every module M , is there a projective module  P and an epimorphism from P onto M whose kernel is superfluous? (Such a P is called a projective cover ). The answer is " No " in general, and the special class of rings which provide their right modules projective covers is the class of right perfect rings .  Generalization  This definition can be generalized to an arbitrary abelian category  C . An essential extension is a monomorphism  u : M → E such that for every non-zero subobject  s : N → E , the fibre product  N × E M ≠ 0.
