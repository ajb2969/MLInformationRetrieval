   Spaceship (cellular automaton)      Spaceship (cellular automaton)   (Figure)  Orthogonal spaceships in Conway's Game of Life of varying speeds. Note some spaceships “overtake” others due to speed differences.   In a cellular automaton , a finite pattern is called a spaceship if it reappears after a certain number of generations in the same orientation but in a different position. The smallest such number of generations is called the period of the spaceship.  The speed of a spaceship is often expressed in terms of c , the metaphorical speed of light (one cell per generation) which in many cellular automata is the fastest that an effect can spread. For example, a glider in Conway's Game of Life is said to have a speed of    c  /  4      c  4    c/4   , as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by one cell. Similarly, the lightweight spaceship is said to have a speed of    c  /  2      c  2    c/2   , as it takes four generations for a given state to be translated by two cells. More generally, if a spaceship in a 2D automaton is translated by    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   after   n   n   n   generations, then the speed   v   v   v   is defined as:       v  =      max   (   |  x  |   ,   |  y  |   )    n    c       v          x     y    n   c     v=\frac{\max\left(|x|,|y|\right)}{n}\,c      This notation can be readily generalised to cellular automata with dimensionality other than two.  A tagalong is a pattern that is not a spaceship in itself but that can be attached to the back of a spaceship to form a larger spaceship. Similarly, a pushalong is placed at the front.  A pattern that, when a spaceship is input, outputs a copy of the spaceship travelling in a different direction is called a reflector .  Spaceships are important because they can sometimes be modified to produce puffers . Spaceships can also be used to transmit information . For example, in Conway's Game of Life , the ability of the glider (Life's simplest spaceship) to transmit information is part of a proof that Life is Turing-complete .
