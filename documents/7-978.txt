   Fundamental unit (number theory)      Fundamental unit (number theory)   In algebraic number theory , a fundamental unit is a generator (modulo the roots of unity ) for the unit group of the ring of integers of a number field , when that group has rank 1 (i.e. when the unit group modulo its torsion subgroup is infinite cyclic ). Dirichlet's unit theorem shows that the unit group has rank 1 exactly when the number field is a real quadratic field , a complex cubic field , or a totally imaginary  quartic field . When the unit group has rank ≥ 1, a basis of it modulo its torsion is called a fundamental system of units . 1 Some authors use the term fundamental unit to mean any element of a fundamental system of units, not restricting to the case of rank 1 (e.g. ).  Real quadratic fields  For the real quadratic field    K  =   𝐐   (   d   )        K    𝐐    d      K=\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})   (with d square-free), the fundamental unit ε is commonly normalized so that    ε  >  1      ε  1    ε>1   (as a real number). Then it is uniquely characterized as the minimal unit among those that are greater than 1. If Δ denotes the discriminant of K , then the fundamental unit is      ε  =    a  +   b   Δ     2       ε      a    b    normal-Δ     2     \varepsilon=\frac{a+b\sqrt{\Delta}}{2}   where ( a , b ) is the smallest solution to 2        x  2   -   Δ   y  2     =   ±  4          superscript  x  2     normal-Δ   superscript  y  2      plus-or-minus  4     x^{2}-\Delta y^{2}=\pm 4   in positive integers. This equation is basically Pell's equation or the negative Pell equation and its solutions can be obtained similarly using the continued fraction expansion of    Δ      normal-Δ    \sqrt{\Delta}   .  Whether or not x 2 − Δ y 2 = −4 has a solution determines whether or not the class group of K is the same as its narrow class group , or equivalently, whether or not there is a unit of norm −1 in K . This equation is known to have a solution if, and only if, the period of the continued fraction expansion of    Δ      normal-Δ    \sqrt{\Delta}   is odd. A simpler relation can be obtained using congruences: if Δ is divisible by a prime that is congruent to 3 modulo 4, then K does not have a unit of norm −1. However, the converse does not hold as shown by the example d = 34. 3 In the early 1990s, Peter Stevenhagen proposed a probabilistic model that led him to a conjecture on how often the converse fails. Specifically, if D ( X ) is the number of real quadratic fields whose discriminant Δ −( X ) is those who have a unit of norm −1, then 4         lim   X  →  ∞       D  -    (  x  )     D   (  x  )      =   1  -    ∏   j  ≥   1  odd      (   1  -   2   -  j     )      .        subscript    normal-→  X          superscript  D    x     D  x       1    subscript  product    j    1  odd       1   superscript  2    j         \lim_{X\rightarrow\infty}\frac{D^{-}(x)}{D(x)}=1-\prod_{j\geq 1\text{ odd}}%
 \left(1-2^{-j}\right).   In other words, the converse fails about 42% of the time. As of March 2012, a recent result towards this conjecture was provided by Étienne Fouvry and Jürgen Klüners 5 who show that the converse fails between 33% and 59% of the time.  Cubic fields  If K is a complex cubic field then it has a unique real embedding and the fundamental unit ε can be picked uniquely such that |ε| > 1 in this embedding. If the discriminant Δ of K satisfies |Δ| ≥ 33, then 6        ϵ  3   >     |  Δ  |   -  27   4    .       superscript  ϵ  3         normal-Δ   27   4     \epsilon^{3}>\frac{|\Delta|-27}{4}.   For example, the fundamental unit of    𝐐   (   2  3   )       𝐐     3   2     \mathbf{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   is    1  +   2  3   +    2  2   3       1     3   2      3    superscript  2  2      1+\sqrt[3]{2}+\sqrt[3]{2^{2}}   whose cube is ≈ 56.9, whereas the discriminant of this field is −108 and         |  Δ  |   -  27   4   =  20.25.            normal-Δ   27   4   20.25.    \frac{|\Delta|-27}{4}=20.25.
