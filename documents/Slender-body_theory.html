<h1>Slender-body theory</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="fluid_dynamics" title="wikilink">fluid dynamics</a> and <a class="uri" href="electrostatics" title="wikilink">electrostatics</a>, <strong>slender-body theory</strong> is a methodology that can be used to take advantage of the slenderness of a body to obtain an approximation to a field surrounding it and/or the net effect of the field on the body. Principal applications are to <a href="Stokes_flow" title="wikilink">Stokes flow</a> — at very low <a href="Reynolds_number" title="wikilink">Reynolds numbers</a> — and in <a class="uri" href="electrostatics" title="wikilink">electrostatics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="theory-for-stokes-flow">Theory for Stokes flow</h2>
<p>Consider slender body of length <span class="LaTeX">$\ell$</span> and typical diameter <span class="LaTeX">$2a$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$\ell \gg a$</span>, surrounded by fluid of <a class="uri" href="viscosity" title="wikilink">viscosity</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\mu$</span> whose motion is governed by the <a href="Stokes_equations" title="wikilink">Stokes equations</a>. Note that the <a href="Stokes'_paradox" title="wikilink">Stokes' paradox</a> implies that the limit of infinite aspect ratio <span class="LaTeX">$\ell/a \rightarrow \infty$</span> is singular, as no Stokes flow can exist around an infinite cylinder.</p>
<p>Slender-body theory allows us to derive an approximate relationship between the velocity of the body at each point along its length and the force per unit length experienced by the body at that point.</p>
<p>Let the axis of the body be described by <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{X}(s,t)$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$s$</span> is an arc-length coordinate, and <span class="LaTeX">$t$</span> is time. By virtue of the slenderness of the body, the force exerted on the fluid at the surface of the body may be approximated by a distribution of <a href="Stokeslet" title="wikilink">Stokeslets</a> along the axis with force density <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{f}(s)$</span> per unit length. <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{f}$</span> is assumed to vary only over lengths much greater than <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>, and the fluid velocity at the surface adjacent to <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{X}(s,t)$</span> is well-approximated by <span class="LaTeX">$\partial\boldsymbol{X}/\partial t$</span>.</p>
<p>The fluid velocity <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x})$</span> at a general point <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{x}$</span> due to such a distribution can be written in terms of an integral of the <a href="Oseen_tensor" title="wikilink">Oseen tensor</a> (named after <a href="Carl_Wilhelm_Oseen" title="wikilink">Carl Wilhelm Oseen</a>), which acts as a <a href="Greens_function" title="wikilink">Greens function</a> for a single Stokeslet. We have</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \int_0^\ell \frac{\boldsymbol{f}(s)}{8\pi\mu} \cdot \left( \frac{\mathbf{I}}{|\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{X}|} + \frac{(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{X})(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{X})}{|\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{X}|^3} \right) \, \mathrm{d}s$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf{I}$</span> is the identity tensor.</p>
<p><a href="Asymptotic_analysis" title="wikilink">Asymptotic analysis</a> can then be used to show that the leading-order contribution to the integral for a point <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{x}$</span> on the surface of the body adjacent to position <span class="LaTeX">$s_0$</span> comes from the force distribution at <span class="LaTeX">$|s- s_0| = O(a)$</span>. Since <span class="LaTeX">$a \ll \ell$</span>, we approximate <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{f}(s) \approx \boldsymbol{f}(s_0)$</span>. We then obtain</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{X}}{\partial t} \sim \frac{\ln(\ell/a)}{4\pi\mu} \boldsymbol{f}(s) \cdot \Bigl( \mathbf{I}  + \boldsymbol{X}'\boldsymbol{X}' \Bigr)$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$\boldsymbol{X}' = \partial \boldsymbol{X}/\partial s$</span>.</p>
<p>The expression may be inverted to give the force density in terms of the motion of the body:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\boldsymbol{f}(s) \sim \frac{4\pi\mu}{\ln(\ell/a)} \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{X}}{\partial t} \cdot \Bigl( \mathbf{I}  - \textstyle\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{X}'\boldsymbol{X}' \Bigr)$$</span></p>
<p>Two canonical results that follow immediately are for the drag force <span class="LaTeX">$F$</span> on a rigid <a href="cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinder</a> (length <span class="LaTeX">$\ell$</span>, radius <span class="LaTeX">$a$</span>) moving a velocity <span class="LaTeX">$u$</span> either parallel to its axis or perpendicular to it. The parallel case gives</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$F \sim \frac{2\pi\mu\ell u}{\ln(\ell/a)}$$</span> while the perpendicular case gives</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$F \sim \frac{4\pi\mu\ell u}{\ln(\ell/a)}$$</span> with only a factor of two difference.</p>
<p>Note that the dominant length scale in the above expressions is the longer length <span class="LaTeX">$\ell$</span>; the shorter length has only a weak effect through the logarithm of the aspect ratio. In slender-body theory results, there are <span class="LaTeX">$O(1)$</span> corrections to the logarithm, so even for relatively large values of <span class="LaTeX">$\ell/a$</span> the error terms will not be that small.</p>
