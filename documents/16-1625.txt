Polyadic space

In mathematics, a polyadic space is a topological space that is the image under a continuous function of a topological power of an Alexandroff one-point compactification of a discrete topological space.
History
Polyadic spaces were first studied by S. Mrówka in 1970 as a generalisation of dyadic spaces.1 The theory was developed further by R. H. Marty, János Gerlits and Murray G. Bell,2 the latter of whom introduced the concept of the more general centred spaces.3
Background
A subset K of a topological space X is said to be compact if every open cover of K contains a finite subcover. It is said to be locally compact at a point x ∈ X if x lies in the interior of some compact subset of X. X is a locally compact space if it is locally compact at every point in the space.4
A proper subset A ⊂ X is said to be dense if the closure Ā = X. A space whose set has a countable, dense subset is called a separable space.
For a non-compact, locally compact Hausdorff topological space 
 
 
 
 , we define the Alexandroff one-point compactification as the topological space with the set 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
 , where

  defined as follows:56

Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a discrete topological space, and let 
 
 
 
  be an Alexandroff one-point compactification of 
 
 
 
 . A Hausdorff space 
 
 
 
  is polyadic if for some cardinal number

 
 , there exists a continuous surjective function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the product space obtained by multiplying 
 
 
 
  with itself 
 
 
 
  times.7
Examples
Take the set of natural numbers 
 
 
 
  with the discrete topology. Its Alexandroff one-point compactification is 
 
 
 
 . Choose 
 
 
 
  and define the homeomorphism 
 
 
 
  with the mapping


 
  It follows from the definition that the space 
 
 
 
  is polyadic and compact directly from the definition of compactness, without using Heine-Borel.
Every dyadic space (a compact space which is a continuous image of a Cantor set8) is a polyadic space.9
Let X be a separable, compact space. If X is a metrizable space, then it is polyadic (the converse is also true).10
Properties
The cellularity 
 
 
 
  of a space 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . The tightness 
 
 
 
  of a space 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows: let 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . We define 
 
 
 
 , and define 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
11 The topological weight

 
  of a polyadic space 
 
 
 
  satisfies the equality 
 
 
 
 .12
Let 
 
 
 
  be a polyadic space, and let 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists a polyadic space 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .13
Polyadic spaces are the smallest class of topological spaces that contain metric compact spaces and are closed under products and continuous images.14 Every polyadic space 
 
 
 
  of weight 
 
 
 
  is a continuous image of 
 
 
 
 .15
A topological space X has the Suslin property if there is no uncountable family of pairwise disjoint non-empty open subsets of X.16 Suppose that X has the Suslin property and X is polyadic. Then X is diadic.17
Let 
 
 
 
  be the least number of discrete sets needed to cover 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  denote the least cardinality of a non-empty open set in 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a polyadic space, then 
 
 
 
 .18
Ramsey's theorem
There is an analogue of Ramsey's theorem from combinatorics for polyadic spaces. For this, we describe the relationship between Boolean spaces and polyadic spaces. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the clopen algebra of all clopen subsets of 
 
 
 
 . We define a Boolean space as a compact Hausdorff space whose basis is 
 
 
 
 . The element 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is called the generating set for 
 
 
 
 . We say 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -disjoint collection if 
 
 
 
  is the union of at most 
 
 
 
  subcollections 
 
 
 
 , where for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a disjoint collection of cardinality at most 
 
 
 
  It was proven by Petr Simon that 
 
 
 
  is a Boolean space with the generating set 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  being 
 
 
 
 -disjoint if and only if 
 
 
 
  is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of 
 
 
 
 .19 The Ramsey-like property for polyadic spaces as stated by Murray Bell for Boolean spaces is then as follows: every uncountable clopen collection contains an uncountable subcollection which is either linked or disjoint.20
Compactness
We define the compactness number of a space 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , to be the least number 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  has an n-ary closed subbase. We can construct polyadic spaces with arbitrary compactness number. We will demonstrate this using two theorems proven by Murray Bell in 1985. Let 
 
 
 
  be a collection of sets and let 
 
 
 
  be a set. We denote the set 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 ; all subsets of 
 
 
 
  of size 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 ; and all subsets of size at most 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then we say that 
 
 
 
  is n-linked. If every n-linked subset of 
 
 
 
  has a non-empty intersection, then we say that 
 
 
 
  is n-ary. Note that if 
 
 
 
  is n-ary, then so is 
 
 
 
 , and therefore every space 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  has a closed, n-ary subbase 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Note that a collection 
 
 
 
  of closed subsets of a compact space 
 
 
 
  is a closed subbase if and only if for every closed 
 
 
 
  in an open set 
 
 
 
 , there exists a finite 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .21
Let 
 
 
 
  be an infinite set and let 
 
 
 
  by a number such that 
 
 
 
 . We define the product topology on 
 
 
 
  as follows: for 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the collection 
 
 
 
 . We take 
 
 
 
  as a clopen subbase for our topology on 
 
 
 
 . This topology is compact and Hausdorff. For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , we have that 
 
 
 
  is a discrete subspace of 
 
 
 
 , and hence that 
 
 
 
  is a union of 
 
 
 
  discrete subspaces.22
Theorem (Upper bound on 
 
 
 
 ): For each total order 
Proof: For 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Set 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -linked subset of 
 
 
 
 . Show that 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 

For a topological space 
 
 
 
  and a subspace 
 
 
 
 , we say that a continuous function 
 
 
 
  is a retraction if 
 
 
 
  is the identity map on 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  is a retract of 
 
 
 
 . If there exists an open set 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a retract of 
 
 
 
 , then we say that 
 
 
 
  is a neighbourhood retract of 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem (Lower bound on 
 
 
 
 ) Let 
 
 
 
  be such that 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  cannot be embedded as a neighbourhood retract in any space 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
From the two theorems above, it can be deduced that for 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , we have that 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the discrete space 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
 . We define the continuous surjection 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . It follows that 
 
 
 
  is a polyadic space. Hence 
 
 
 
  is a polyadic space with compactness number 
 
 
 
 .23
Generalisations
Centred spaces, AD-compact spaces24 and ξ-adic spaces25 are generalisations of polyadic spaces.
Centred space
Let 
 
 
 
  be a collection of sets. We say that 
 
 
 
  is centred if 
 
 
 
  for all finite subsets 
 
 
 
 .26 Define the Boolean space 
 
 
 
 , with the subspace topology from 
 
 
 
 . We say that a space 
 
 
 
  is a centred space if there exists a collection 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a continuous image of 
 
 
 
 .27
Centred spaces were introduced by Murray Bell in 2004.
AD-compact space
Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-empty set, and consider a family of its subsets 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  is an adequate family if:




given 
 
 
 
 , if every finite subset of 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .

We may treat 
 
 
 
  as a topological space by considering it a subset of the Cantor cube

 
 , and in this case, we denote it 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact space. If there exist a set 
 
 
 
  and an adequate family 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  is the continuous image of 
 
 
 
 , then we say that 
 
 
 
  is an AD-compact space.
AD-compact spaces were introduced by Grzegorz Plebanek. He proved that they are closed under arbitrary products and Alexandroff compactifications of disjoint unions. It follows that every polyadic space is hence an AD-compact space. The converse is not true, as there are AD-compact spaces that are not polyadic.28
ξ-adic space
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be cardinals, and let 
 
 
 
  be a Hausdorff space. If there exists a continuous surjection from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is said to be a ξ-adic space.29
ξ-adic spaces were proposed by S. Mrówka, and the following results about them were given by János Gerlits (they also apply to polyadic spaces, as they are a special case of ξ-adic spaces).30
Let 
 
 
 
  be an infinite cardinal, and let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space. We say that 
 
 
 
  has the property 
 
 
 
  if for any family 
 
 
 
  of non-empty open subsets of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , we can find a set 
 
 
 
  and a point 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and for each neighbourhood 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , we have that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a ξ-adic space, then 
 
 
 
  has the property 
 
 
 
  for each infinite cardinal 
 
 
 
 . It follows from this result that no infinite ξ-adic Hausdorff space can be an extremally disconnected space.31
Hyadic space
Hyadic spaces were introduced by Eric van Douwen.32 They are defined as follows.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Hausdorff space. We denote by 
 
 
 
  the hyperspace of 
 
 
 
 . We define the subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . A base of 
 
 
 
  is the family of all sets of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is any integer, and 
 
 
 
  are open in 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is compact, then we say a Hausdorff space 
 
 
 
  is hyadic if there exists a continuous surjection from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .33
Polyadic spaces are hyadic.34
