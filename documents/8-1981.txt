   Rodrigues equation      Rodrigues equation   The Rodrigues equation is an equation used in chromatography to describe the efficiency of a bed of permeable (large-pore) particles. It is thus an extension of Van Deemter's equation . It was developed by Alirio E. Rodrigues et al. . 1  Equation  The equation is:       H  E  T  P   =   A  +   B  u   +     C  ⋅  f    (  λ  )    ⋅  u          H  E  T  P     A    B  u    normal-⋅     normal-⋅  C  f   λ   u      HETP=A+\frac{B}{u}+C\cdot f(\lambda)\cdot u     Where   HETP is the height equivalent to a theoretical plate  A = Eddy diffusion  B = Longitudinal diffusion  C = Resistance to mass transfer  u = Flow rate       f   (  λ  )    =    3  λ    [    1   t  a  n  h   (  λ  )     -   1  λ    ]          f  λ       3  λ    delimited-[]      1    t  a  n  h  λ      1  λ        f(\lambda)=\frac{3}{\lambda}\left[\frac{1}{tanh(\lambda)}-\frac{1}{\lambda}\right]        λ   λ   \lambda   = Intraparticular Péclet number   References  "  Category:Chromatography  Category:Equations     ↩
