Rodrigues equation

The Rodrigues equation is an equation used in chromatography to describe the efficiency of a bed of permeable (large-pore) particles. It is thus an extension of Van Deemter's equation. It was developed by Alirio E. Rodrigues et al..1
Equation
The equation is:



Where

HETP is the height equivalent to a theoretical plate
A = Eddy diffusion
B = Longitudinal diffusion
C = Resistance to mass transfer
u = Flow rate
