   Baumé scale      Baumé scale   The Baumé scale is a pair of hydrometer scales developed by French pharmacist Antoine Baumé in 1768 to measure density of various liquids. The unit of the Baumé scale has been notated variously as degrees Baumé , B° , Bé° and simply Baumé (the accent is not always present). One scale measures the density of liquids heavier than water and the other, liquids lighter than water. The Baumé of distilled water is 0.  Conversions  The relationship between specific gravity (s.g.) ( relative density ) and degrees Baumé is function of the temperature. Different versions of the scale may use different reference temperatures. Different conversions formulae can therefore be found in various handbooks.  As an example, a recent handbook 1 indicates the following conversion rules at a temperature of :  :*For liquids more dense than water    s.g.  =   145   145  -    degrees   Baum   e  ´          s.g.    145    145    degrees  Baum   normal-´  normal-e        \text{s.g.}=\frac{145}{145-\mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}     :*For liquids less dense than water    s.g.  =   140   130  +    degrees   Baum   e  ´          s.g.    140    130    degrees  Baum   normal-´  normal-e        \text{s.g.}=\frac{140}{130+\mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}     An older handbook 2 gives the following formulae (no reference temperature being mentioned):  :*For liquids more dense than water    s.g.  =   144   144  -    degrees   Baum   e  ´          s.g.    144    144    degrees  Baum   normal-´  normal-e        \text{s.g.}=\frac{144}{144-\mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}     :*For liquids less dense than water    s.g.  =   144   134  +    degrees   Baum   e  ´          s.g.    144    134    degrees  Baum   normal-´  normal-e        \text{s.g.}=\frac{144}{134+\mathrm{degrees\ Baum\acute{e}}}     Definitions  Baumé degrees (heavy) originally represented the percent by mass of sodium chloride in water at . Baumé degrees (light) was calibrated with 0°Bé (light) being the density of 10% NaCl in water by mass and 10°Bé (light) set to the density of water.  Other scales  Because of vague instructions or errors in translation a large margin of error was introduced when the scale was adopted. The API gravity scale is a result of adapting to the subsequent errors from the Baumé scale. The Baumé scale is related to the Balling, Brix , Plato and ' specific gravity times 1000' scales.  Use  Before standardisation on specific gravity around the time of World War II the Baumé scale was generally used in industrial chemistry and pharmacology for the measurement of density of liquids. Today the Baumé scale is still used in various industries such as brewing, sugar beet processing , ophthalmics, starch industry, and winemaking.
