   Pyridoxal phosphatase      Pyridoxal phosphatase   In enzymology , a pyridoxal phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyridoxal 5'-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyridoxal + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are pyridoxal and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxal-5'-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include vitamine B 6 (pyridoxine) phosphatase , PLP phosphatase , vitamin B 6 -phosphate phosphatase , and PNP phosphatase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
