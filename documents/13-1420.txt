   Eight-dimensional space      Eight-dimensional space   In mathematics , a sequence of n  real numbers can be understood as a location in n - dimensional space. When n = 8, the set of all such locations is called 8-dimensional space . Often such spaces are studied as vector spaces , without any notion of distance. Eight-dimensional Euclidean space is eight-dimensional space equipped with a Euclidean metric , which is defined by the dot product .  More generally the term may refer to an eight-dimensional vector space over any field , such as an eight-dimensional complex vector space, which has 16 real dimensions. It may also refer to an eight-dimensional manifold such as an 8-sphere , or a variety of other geometric constructions.  Geometry  8-polytope  A polytope in eight dimensions is called an 8-polytope. The most studied are the regular polytopes , of which there are only three in eight dimensions : the 8-simplex , 8-cube , and 8-orthoplex . A broader family are the uniform 8-polytopes , constructed from fundamental symmetry domains of reflection, each domain defined by a Coxeter group . Each uniform polytope is defined by a ringed Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . The 8-demicube is a unique polytope from the D 8 family, and 4 21 , 2 41 , and 1 42 polytopes from the E 8 family.      Regular and uniform polytopes in eight dimensions (Displayed as orthogonal projections in each Coxeter plane of symmetry)     A 8      8-simplex      E 8      4 21      7-sphere  The 7-sphere or hypersphere in eight dimensions is the seven-dimensional surface equidistant from a point, e.g. the origin. It has symbol , with formal definition for the 7-sphere with radius r of        S  7   =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  8    :    ∥  x  ∥   =  r   }    .       superscript  S  7    conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  8       norm  x   r      S^{7}=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{8}:\|x\|=r\right\}.     The volume of the space bounded by this 7-sphere is        V  8    =      π  4   24     R  8         subscript  V  8        superscript  π  4   24    superscript  R  8      V_{8}\,=\frac{\pi^{4}}{24}\,R^{8}     which is 4.05871 × r 8 , or 0.01585 of the 8-cube that contains the 7-sphere.  Kissing number problem  The kissing number problem has been solved in eight dimensions, thanks to the existence of the 4 21 polytope and its associated lattice . The kissing number in eight dimensions is 240 .  Octonions  The octonions are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, the largest such algebra. Mathematically they can be specified by 8-tuplets of real numbers, so form an 8-dimensional vector space over the reals, with addition of vectors being the addition in the algebra. A normed algebra is one with a product that satisfies       ∥   x  y   ∥   ≤    ∥  x  ∥    ∥  y  ∥         norm    x  y       norm  x    norm  y      \|xy\|\leq\|x\|\|y\|   for all x and y in the algebra. A normed division algebra additionally must be finite-dimensional, and have the property that every non-zero vector has a unique multiplicative inverse. Hurwitz's theorem prohibits such a structure from existing in dimensions other than 1, 2, 4, or 8.  Biquaternions  The complexified quaternions     ℂ  ⊗  ℍ     tensor-product  ℂ  ℍ    \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}   , or " biquaternions ," are an eight-dimensional algebra dating to William Rowan Hamilton 's work in the 1850s. This algebra is equivalent (that is, isomorphic ) to the Clifford algebra     C   ℓ  2    (  ℂ  )       C   subscript  normal-ℓ  2   ℂ    C\ell_{2}(\mathbb{C})   and the Pauli algebra . It has also been proposed as a practical or pedagogical tool for doing calculations in special relativity , and in that context goes by the name Algebra of physical space (not to be confused with the Spacetime algebra , which is 16-dimensional.)
