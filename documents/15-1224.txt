   Sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase      Sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase   Sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase (, ApDMT , sarcosine-dimethylglycine methyltransferase , SDMT , sarcosine dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:N,N-dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:sarcosine(or N,N-dimethylglycine) N-methyltransferase (N,N-dimethylglycine(or betaine)-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + sarcosine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + betaine (overall reaction)  (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + sarcosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N,N-dimethylglycine  (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + N,N-dimethylglycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + betaine   This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of betaine from glycine in cyanobacterium  Aphanocthece halophytica .
