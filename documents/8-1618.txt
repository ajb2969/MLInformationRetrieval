 Schematic of Maxwell–Wiechert model

The Generalized Maxwell model also known as the Maxwell–Wiechert model (after James Clerk Maxwell and E Wiechert12) is the most general form of the linear model for viscoelasticity. In this model several Maxwell elements are assembled in parallel. It takes into account that the relaxation which does not occur at a single time, but in a set of times. Due to molecular segments of different lengths with shorter ones contributing less than longer ones, there is a varying time distribution. The Wiechert model shows this by having as many spring–dashpot Maxwell elements as are necessary to accurately represent the distribution. The figure on the right shows the generalised Wiechert model.34
General model form
Solids
Given 
 
 
 
  elements with moduli 
 
 
 
 , viscosities 
 
 
 
 , and relaxation times 
 
 

The general form for the model for solids is given by : {\partial{t}^{n}} }  
 
 



|cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = white}}
\right)} \frac{\partial{\sigma}}{\partial{t}} +  
 
 













|cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = white}} 
Example: standard linear solid model
Following the above model with 
 
 
 
  elements yields the standard linear solid model: {\partial{t}}=E_0\epsilon+\tau_1\left({E_0+E_1}\right)\frac{\partial{\epsilon}}{\partial{t}}  |cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = white}}
Liquids
Given 
 
 
 
  elements with moduli 
 
 
 
 , viscosities 
 
 
 
 , and relaxation times 
 
 

The general form for the model for liquids is given by: {\partial{t}^{n}} }  
 
 


|cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = white}}
\right)} \frac{\partial{\sigma}}{\partial{t}} +  
 
 












|cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = white}} 
Example: three parameter fluid
The analogous model to the standard linear solid model is the three parameter fluid, also known as the Jeffrey model:5 {\partial{t}}=\left({\eta_0+\tau_1 E_1}\right)\frac{\partial{\epsilon}}{\partial{t}}  |cellpadding = 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour = white}}
