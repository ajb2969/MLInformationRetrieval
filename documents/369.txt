   Analytically irreducible ring      Analytically irreducible ring   In algebra, an analytically irreducible ring is a local ring whose completion has no zero divisors. Geometrically this corresponds to a variety with only one analytic branch at a point.  proved that if a local ring of an algebraic variety is a normal ring , then it is analytically irreducible. There are many examples of reduced and irreducible local rings that are analytically reducible, such as the local ring of a node of an irreducible curve, but it is hard to find examples that are also normal.  gave such an example of a normal Noetherian local ring that is analytically reducible.  Nagata's example  Suppose that K is a field of characteristic not 2, and K [ [ x , y ]] is the formal power series ring over K in 2 variables. Let R be the subring of K [ [ x , y ]] generated by x , y , and the elements z n and localized at these elements, where      w  =    ∑   m  >  0      a  m    x  m         w    subscript     m  0       subscript  a  m    superscript  x  m       w=\sum_{m>0}a_{m}x^{m}   is transcendental over K ( x )       z  1   =    (   y  +  w   )   2        subscript  z  1    superscript    y  w   2     z_{1}=(y+w)^{2}         w  =    ∑   m  >  0      a  m    x  m         w    subscript     m  0       subscript  a  m    superscript  x  m       w=\sum_{m>0}a_{m}x^{m}
