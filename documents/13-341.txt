   Beta Pyxidis      Beta Pyxidis   Beta Pyxidis ( Beta Pyx , β Pyxidis , β Pyx ) is a double star 1 located in the southern constellation  Pyxis . It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.954, making it the second brightest star in that faint constellation.  Based upon parallax measurements, the star is an estimated 420 light-years (128 parsecs ) from the Earth . 2 The spectrum matches a bright giant or supergiant star of stellar classification G7Ib-II. The interferometer -measured angular diameter of this star is . 3 At its estimated distance, this yields a physical size of about 28 times the radius of the Sun . 4 The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 5,400 K, giving it the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star . 5 6  In 2010, the star was among a survey of massive, lower effective temperature supergiants in an attempt to detect a magnetic field. This star may have a longitudinal magnetic field with a strength of less than a Gauss . 7 It is a young disk star system with space velocity components,  = . 8 There is a magnitude 12.5 optical companion, located at an angular separation of 12.7 arcseconds and a position angle of 118° as of the year 1943. 9  Naming  In Chinese ,  (), meaning Celestial Dog , refers to an asterism consisting of β Pyxidis, e Velorum , f Velorum , α Pyxidis , γ Pyxidis and δ Pyxidis . Consequently, β Pyxidis itself is known as  (, .) 10  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 56\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 11  12  }}  "  Pyxidis, Beta  Category:G-type giants  Category:Pyxis (constellation)               AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 17 日 ↩  ↩  ↩
