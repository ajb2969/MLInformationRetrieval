   Bipartite matroid      Bipartite matroid   In mathematics, a bipartite matroid is a matroid all of whose circuits have even size.  Example  A uniform matroid     U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   is bipartite if and only if   r   r   r   is an odd number, because the circuits in such a matroid have size    r  +  1      r  1    r+1   .  Relation to bipartite graphs  Eulerian matroids were defined by  as a generalization of the bipartite graphs , graphs in which every cycle has even size. A graphic matroid is bipartite if and only if it comes from a bipartite graph. 1  Duality with Eulerian matroids  An Eulerian graph is one in which all vertices have even degree; Eulerian graphs may be disconnected. For planar graphs , the properties of being bipartite and Eulerian are dual: a planar graph is bipartite if and only if its dual graph is Eulerian. As Welsh showed, this duality extends to binary matroids : a binary matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual matroid is an Eulerian matroid , a matroid that can be partitioned into disjoint circuits.  For matroids that are not binary, the duality between Eulerian and bipartite matroids may break down. For instance, the uniform matroid    U    6  4      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  6   4     U{}^{4}_{6}   is non-bipartite but its dual    U    6  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  6   2     U{}^{2}_{6}   is Eulerian, as it can be partitioned into two 3-cycles. The self-dual uniform matroid    U    6  3      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  6   3     U{}^{3}_{6}   is bipartite but not Eulerian.  Computational complexity  It is possible to test in polynomial time whether a given binary matroid is bipartite. 2 However, any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is Eulerian, given access to the matroid via an independence oracle , must perform an exponential number of oracle queries, and therefore cannot take polynomial time. 3  References  "  Category:Matroid theory     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
