Cayley's nodal cubic surface

 In algebraic geometry, the Cayley surface, named after Arthur Cayley, is a cubic nodal surface in 3-dimensional projective space with four conical points. It can be given by the equation



when the four singular points are those with three vanishing coordinates. Changing variables gives several other simple equations defining the Cayley surface.
