Indole-3-glycerol-phosphate lyase

In enzymology, an indole-3-glycerol-phosphate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate 
 
 
 
  indole + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate, and two products, indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol-3-phosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase (indole-forming). Other names in common use include tryptophan synthase alpha, TSA, indoleglycerolphosphate aldolase, indole glycerol phosphate hydrolase, indole synthase, indole-3-glycerolphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase, IGL, BX1, (1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate, and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoxazinone biosynthesis.
