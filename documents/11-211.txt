Hydroperoxide dehydratase




Hydroperoxide dehydratase

In enzymology, a hydroperoxide dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(9Z,11E,14Z)-(13S)-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11,14-trienoate 
 
 
 
  (9Z)-(13S)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (9Z,11E,14Z)-(13S)-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11,14-trienoate, and two products, (9Z)-(13S)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (9Z,11E,14Z)-(13S)-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11,14-trienoate 12,13-hydro-lyase [(9Z)-(13S)-12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9,11-dienoate-forming]. Other names in common use include hydroperoxide isomerase, linoleate hydroperoxide isomerase, linoleic acid hydroperoxide isomerase, HPI, (9Z,11E,14Z)-(13S)-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,11,14-trienoate, and 12,13-hydro-lyase.
