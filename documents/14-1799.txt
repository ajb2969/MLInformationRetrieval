Fox–Wright function

In mathematics, the Fox–Wright function (also known as Fox–Wright Psi function or just Wright function, not to be confused with Wright Omega function) is a generalisation of the generalised hypergeometric function pFq(z) based on an idea of :



Its normalisation



becomes pFq(z) for A1...p = B1...q = 1.
The Fox–Wright function is a special case of the Fox H-function :
