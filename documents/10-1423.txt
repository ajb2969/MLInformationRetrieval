   Trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase      Trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+/-)-trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diol + 2 NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acenaphthenequinone + 2 NADPH + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (+/-)-trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are acenaphthenequinone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on diphenols and related substances as donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+/-)-trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diol:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called trans-1,2-acenaphthenediol dehydrogenase .
