Pöschl–Teller potential

In mathematical physics, a Pöschl–Teller potential, named after the physicists Herta Pöschl1 (credited as G. Pöschl) and Edward Teller, is a special class of potentials for which the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation can be solved in terms of special functions.
Definition
It is explicitly given by2 


 
  and the solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger equation


 
  with this potential can be found by virtue of the substitution 
 
 
 
 , which yields


 
 . Thus the solutions 
 
 
 
  are just the Legendre functions

 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, eigenvalues and scattering data can be explicitly computed.3 In the special case of integer 
 
 
 
 , the potential is reflectionless and such potentials also arise as the N-soliton solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
