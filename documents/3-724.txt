Geometric standard deviation

In probability theory and statistics, the geometric standard deviation describes how spread out are a set of numbers whose preferred average is the geometric mean. For such data, it may be preferred to the more usual standard deviation. Note that unlike the usual arithmetic standard deviation, the geometric standard deviation is a multiplicative factor, and thus is dimensionless, rather than having the same  dimension as the input values.
Definition
If the geometric mean of a set of numbers {A1, A2, ..., An} is denoted as Î¼g, then the geometric standard deviation is



Derivation
If the geometric mean is



then taking the natural logarithm of both sides results in



The logarithm of a product is a sum of logarithms (assuming 
 
 
 
  is positive for all 
 
 
 
 ), so



It can now be seen that 
 
 
 
  is the arithmetic mean of the set 
 
 
 
 , therefore the arithmetic standard deviation of this same set should be



This simplifies to



Geometric standard score
The geometric version of the standard score is



If the geometric mean, standard deviation, and z-score of a datum are known, then the raw score can be reconstructed by



Relationship to log-normal distribution
The geometric standard deviation was proposed for the first time by  Kirkwood (1979) as a measure of  log-normal dispersion analogously to the geometric mean.1 As the log-transform of a log-normal distribution results in a normal distribution, we see that the geometric standard deviation is the exponentiated value of the standard deviation of the log-transformed values, i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
As such, the geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation of a sample of data from a log-normally distributed population may be used to find the bounds of confidence intervals analogously to the way the arithmetic mean and standard deviation are used to bound confidence intervals for a normal distribution. See discussion in log-normal distribution for details.
