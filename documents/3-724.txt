   Geometric standard deviation      Geometric standard deviation   In probability theory and statistics , the geometric standard deviation describes how spread out are a set of numbers whose preferred average is the geometric mean . For such data, it may be preferred to the more usual standard deviation . Note that unlike the usual arithmetic standard deviation, the geometric standard deviation is a multiplicative factor, and thus is dimensionless , rather than having the same dimension as the input values.  Definition  If the geometric mean of a set of numbers { A 1 , A 2 , ..., A n } is denoted as μ g , then the geometric standard deviation is       σ  g   =  exp   (      ∑   i  =  1   n     (   ln    A  i    μ  g     )   2    n    )   .

 \right).\qquad\qquad(1)     Derivation  If the geometric mean is        μ  g   =     A  1    A  2   ⋯   A  n    n    .       subscript  μ  g      n      subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-⋯   subscript  A  n       \mu_{g}=\sqrt[n]{A_{1}A_{2}\cdots A_{n}}.\,     then taking the natural logarithm of both sides results in        ln   μ  g    =    1  n    ln   (    A  1    A  2   ⋯   A  n    )      .         subscript  μ  g        1  n        subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-⋯   subscript  A  n        \ln\mu_{g}={1\over n}\ln(A_{1}A_{2}\cdots A_{n}).     The logarithm of a product is a sum of logarithms (assuming    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is positive for all   i   i   i   ), so        ln   μ  g    =    1  n    [    ln   A  1    +   ln   A  2    +  ⋯  +   ln   A  n     ]     .         subscript  μ  g        1  n    delimited-[]       subscript  A  1       subscript  A  2    normal-⋯     subscript  A  n         \ln\mu_{g}={1\over n}[\ln A_{1}+\ln A_{2}+\cdots+\ln A_{n}].\,     It can now be seen that     ln    μ  g        subscript  μ  g     \ln\,\mu_{g}   is the arithmetic mean of the set    {   ln   A  1    ,   ln   A  2    ,  …  ,   ln   A  n    }        subscript  A  1       subscript  A  2    normal-…     subscript  A  n      \{\ln A_{1},\ln A_{2},\dots,\ln A_{n}\}   , therefore the arithmetic standard deviation of this same set should be        ln   σ  g    =      ∑   i  =  1   n     (    ln   A  i    -   ln   μ  g     )   2    n     .         subscript  σ  g          superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript       subscript  A  i       subscript  μ  g     2    n      \ln\sigma_{g}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\ln A_{i}-\ln\mu_{g})^{2}\over n}.     This simplifies to        σ  g   =   exp      ∑   i  =  1   n     (   ln    A  i    μ  g     )   2    n      .       subscript  σ  g           superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript       subscript  A  i    subscript  μ  g     2    n       \sigma_{g}=\exp{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\ln{A_{i}\over\mu_{g}})^{2}\over n}}.     Geometric standard score  The geometric version of the standard score is       z  =     ln   (  x  )    -   ln   (   μ  g   )      ln   σ  g     =    log   σ  g     (   x  /   μ  g    )     .        z        x      subscript  μ  g        subscript  σ  g            subscript    subscript  σ  g      x   subscript  μ  g        z={{\ln(x)-\ln(\mu_{g})}\over\ln\sigma_{g}}={\log_{\sigma_{g}}(x/\mu_{g})}.\,     If the geometric mean, standard deviation, and z-score of a datum are known, then the raw score can be reconstructed by       x  =    μ  g    σ  g    z     .      x     subscript  μ  g    superscript   subscript  σ  g   z      x=\mu_{g}{\sigma_{g}}^{z}.     Relationship to log-normal distribution  The geometric standard deviation was proposed for the first time by Kirkwood (1979) as a measure of log-normal dispersion analogously to the geometric mean. 1 As the log-transform of a log-normal distribution results in a normal distribution, we see that the geometric standard deviation is the exponentiated value of the standard deviation of the log-transformed values, i.e.     σ  g   =   exp   (   stdev   (   ln   (  A  )    )    )         subscript  σ  g      stdev    A       \sigma_{g}=\exp(\operatorname{stdev}(\ln(A)))   .  As such, the geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation of a sample of data from a log-normally distributed population may be used to find the bounds of confidence intervals analogously to the way the arithmetic mean and standard deviation are used to bound confidence intervals for a normal distribution.
