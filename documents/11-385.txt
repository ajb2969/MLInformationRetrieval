   Protein-secreting ATPase      Protein-secreting ATPase   In enzymology , a protein-secreting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (protein-secreting) .
