   Fructuronate reductase      Fructuronate reductase   In enzymology , a fructuronate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannonate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructuronate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannonate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-fructuronate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannonate:NAD + 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include mannonate oxidoreductase , mannonic dehydrogenase , D-mannonate dehydrogenase , and D-mannonate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
