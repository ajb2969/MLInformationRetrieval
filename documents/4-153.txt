   Noncommutative topology      Noncommutative topology   Noncommutative topology in mathematics is a term applied to the strictly C*-algebraic part of the noncommutative geometry program. The program has its origins in the Gel'fand duality between the topology of locally compact spaces and the algebraic structure of commutative  C*-algebras .  Several topological properties can be formulated as properties for the C*-algebras without making reference to commutativity or the underlying space , and so have an immediate generalization.  Amongst these are compactness (being unital ), dimension ( real or stable rank ), connectedness ( projectionless algebra ) and K-theory . So we think of a noncommutative C*-algebra as the algebra of functions on a 'noncommutative space' which does not exist classically.  A major tool in the field is a bivariant version of K-theory called KK-theory . It has a composition product         K  K   (  A  ,  B  )    ×  K   K   (  B  ,  C  )    →   K  K   (  A  ,  C  )       normal-→        K  K   A  B    K   K   B  C      K  K   A  C      KK(A,B)\times KK(B,C)\rightarrow KK(A,C)     of which the ring structure in ordinary K-theory is a special case. The product gives the structure of a category to KK. It has been related to correspondences of algebraic varieties. 1  References    "  Category:Banach algebras  Category:Topology     ↩
