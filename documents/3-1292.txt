   Initial value problem      Initial value problem   In mathematics , in the field of differential equations , an initial value problem (also called the Cauchy problem by some authors) is an ordinary differential equation together with a specified value, called the initial condition , of the unknown function at a given point in the domain of the solution. In physics or other sciences, modeling a system frequently amounts to solving an initial value problem; in this context, the differential equation is an evolution equation specifying how, given initial conditions, the system will evolve with time .  Definition  An initial value problem is a differential equation        y  ′    (  t  )    =   f   (  t  ,   y   (  t  )    )           superscript  y  normal-′   t     f   t    y  t       y^{\prime}(t)=f(t,y(t))   with    f  :   Ω  ⊂   ℝ  ×   ℝ  n    →   ℝ  n       normal-:  f      normal-Ω    ℝ   superscript  ℝ  n      normal-→     superscript  ℝ  n       f\colon\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}   where   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is an open set of    ℝ  ×   ℝ  n       ℝ   superscript  ℝ  n     \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}   , together with a point in the domain of   f   f   f          (   t  0   ,   y  0   )   ∈  Ω        subscript  t  0    subscript  y  0    normal-Ω    (t_{0},y_{0})\in\Omega   , called the initial condition .  A solution to an initial value problem is a function   y   y   y   that is a solution to the differential equation and satisfies       y   (   t  0   )    =   y  0         y   subscript  t  0     subscript  y  0     y(t_{0})=y_{0}   .  In higher dimensions, the differential equation is replaced with a family of equations      y  i  ′    (  t  )    =    f  i    (  t  ,    y  1    (  t  )    ,    y  2    (  t  )    ,  …  )           superscript   subscript  y  i   normal-′   t      subscript  f  i    t     subscript  y  1   t      subscript  y  2   t   normal-…      y_{i}^{\prime}(t)=f_{i}(t,y_{1}(t),y_{2}(t),\ldots)   , and    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)   is viewed as the vector    (    y  1    (  t  )    ,  …  ,    y  n    (  t  )    )        subscript  y  1   t   normal-…     subscript  y  n   t     (y_{1}(t),\ldots,y_{n}(t))   . More generally, the unknown function   y   y   y   can take values on infinite dimensional spaces, such as Banach spaces or spaces of distributions .  Initial value problems are extended to higher orders by treating the derivatives in the same way as an independent function, e.g.      y  ′′    (  t  )    =   f   (  t  ,   y   (  t  )    ,    y  ′    (  t  )    )           superscript  y  ′′   t     f   t    y  t      superscript  y  normal-′   t       y^{\prime\prime}(t)=f(t,y(t),y^{\prime}(t))   .  Existence and uniqueness of solutions  For a large class of initial value problems, the existence and uniqueness of a solution can be illustrated through the use of a calculator.  The Picard–Lindelöf theorem guarantees a unique solution on some interval containing t 0 if ƒ is continuous on a region containing t 0 and y 0 and satisfies the Lipschitz condition on the variable y . The proof of this theorem proceeds by reformulating the problem as an equivalent integral equation . The integral can be considered an operator which maps one function into another, such that the solution is a fixed point of the operator. The Banach fixed point theorem is then invoked to show that there exists a unique fixed point, which is the solution of the initial value problem.  An older proof of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem constructs a sequence of functions which converge to the solution of the integral equation, and thus, the solution of the initial value problem. Such a construction is sometimes called "Picard's method" or "the method of successive approximations". This version is essentially a special case of the Banach fixed point theorem.  Hiroshi Okamura obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique. This condition has to do with the existence of a Lyapunov function for the system.  In some situations, the function ƒ is not of class C 1 , or even Lipschitz , so the usual result guaranteeing the local existence of a unique solution does not apply. The Peano existence theorem however proves that even for ƒ merely continuous, solutions are guaranteed to exist locally in time; the problem is that there is no guarantee of uniqueness. The result may be found in Coddington & Levinson (1955, Theorem 1.3) or Robinson (2001, Theorem 2.6). An even more general result is the Carathéodory existence theorem , which proves existence for some discontinuous functions ƒ.  Examples  A simple example is to solve     y  ′   =   0.85  y        superscript  y  normal-′     0.85  y     y^{\prime}=0.85y   and     y   (  0  )    =  19        y  0   19    y(0)=19   . We are trying to find a formula for    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)   that satisfies these two equations.  Start by noting that     y  ′   =    d  y    d  t         superscript  y  normal-′       d  y     d  t      y^{\prime}=\frac{dy}{dt}   , so        d  y    d  t    =   0.85  y           d  y     d  t      0.85  y     \frac{dy}{dt}=0.85y     Now rearrange the equation so that   y   y   y   is on the left and   t   t   t   on the right        d  y   y   =   0.85  d  t           d  y   y     0.85  d  t     \frac{dy}{y}=0.85dt     Now integrate both sides (this introduces an unknown constant   B   B   B   ).       ln   |  y  |    =    0.85  t   +  B           y        0.85  t   B     \ln|y|=0.85t+B     Eliminate the   ln     \ln          |  y  |   =    e  B    e   0.85  t           y      superscript  e  B    superscript  e    0.85  t       |y|=e^{B}e^{0.85t}     Let   C   C   C   be a new unknown constant,    C  =   ±   e  B        C   plus-or-minus   superscript  e  B      C=\pm e^{B}   , so      y  =   C   e   0.85  t         y    C   superscript  e    0.85  t       y=Ce^{0.85t}     Now we need to find a value for   C   C   C   . Use     y   (  0  )    =  19        y  0   19    y(0)=19   as given at the start and substitute 0 for   t   t   t   and 19 for   y   y   y         19  =   C   e   0.85  *  0         19    C   superscript  e    0.85  0       19=Ce^{0.85*0}         C  =  19      C  19    C=19     this gives the final solution of     y   (  t  )    =   19   e   0.85  t           y  t     19   superscript  e    0.85  t       y(t)=19e^{0.85t}   .   Second example   The solution of         y  ′   +   3  y    =    6  t   +  5    ,    y   (  0  )    =  3      formulae-sequence       superscript  y  normal-′     3  y        6  t   5        y  0   3     y^{\prime}+3y=6t+5,\qquad y(0)=3     can be found to be       y   (  t  )    =    2   e   -   3  t      +   2  t   +   1.          y  t       2   superscript  e      3  t        2  t   1.     y(t)=2e^{-3t}+2t+1.\,     Indeed,       y  ′   +   3  y        superscript  y  normal-′     3  y     \displaystyle y^{\prime}+3y     See also   Boundary value problem  Constant of integration  Integral curve   References          el:Αρχική τιμή  it:Problema ai valori iniziali  sv:Begynnelsevärdesproblem "  Category:Boundary conditions
