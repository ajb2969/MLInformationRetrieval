UMP kinase




UMP kinase

In enzymology, an UMP kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + UMP 
 
 
 
  ADP + UDP
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and UMP, whereas its two products are ADP and UDP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:UMP phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include uridylate kinase, UMPK, uridine monophosphate kinase, PyrH, UMP-kinase, and SmbA. This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.
