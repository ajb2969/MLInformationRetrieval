   Extremal orders of an arithmetic function      Extremal orders of an arithmetic function   In mathematics , in number theory , the extremal orders of an arithmetic function are best possible bounds of the given arithmetic function . Specifically, if f ( n ) is an arithmetic function and m ( n ) is a non-decreasing function that is ultimately positive and        lim inf   n  →  ∞      f   (  n  )     m   (  n  )      =  1        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n         f  n     m  n     1    \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{m(n)}=1   we say that m is a minimal order for f . Similarly if M ( n ) is a non-decreasing function that is ultimately positive and        lim sup   n  →  ∞      f   (  n  )     M   (  n  )      =  1        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n         f  n     M  n     1    \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{M(n)}=1   we say that M is a maximal order for f . 1 The subject was first studied systematically by Ramanujan starting in 1915. 2  Examples   For the sum-of-divisors function σ( n ) we have the trivial result           lim inf   n  →  ∞      σ   (  n  )    n    =  1        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n         σ  n   n    1    \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sigma(n)}{n}=1       because always σ( n ) ≥ n and for primes σ( p ) = p + 1. We also have        lim sup   n  →  ∞      σ   (  n  )     n   ln   ln  n       =   e  γ    ,        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n         σ  n     n      n        superscript  e  γ     \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sigma(n)}{n\ln\ln n}=e^{\gamma},      proved by Gronwall in 1913. 3    4 Therefore n is a minimal order and e −γ  n ln ln n is a maximal order for σ( n ).   For the Euler totient φ( n ) we have the trivial result           lim inf   n  →  ∞      ϕ   (  n  )    n    =  1        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n         ϕ  n   n    1    \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{\phi(n)}{n}=1       because always φ( n ) ≤ n and for primes φ( p ) = p − 1. We also have        lim inf   n  →  ∞      ϕ   (  n  )    ln   ln  n     n    =   e   -  γ     ,        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n         ϕ  n      n     n     superscript  e    γ      \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{\phi(n)\ln\ln n}{n}=e^{-\gamma},      proved by Landau in 1903. 5 6     For the number of divisors function d ( n ) we have the trivial lower bound 2 ≤ d ( n ), in which equality occurs when n is prime, so 2 is a minimal order. For ln d ( n ) we have a maximal order ln 2 ln n / ln ln n , proved by Wigert in 1907. 7 8  For the number of distinct prime factors ω( n ) we have a trivial lower bound 1 ≤ ω( n ), in which equality occurs when n is a prime power. A maximal order for ω( n ) is ln n / ln ln n . 9  For the number of prime factors counted with multiplicity Ω( n ) we have a trivial lower bound 1 ≤ Ω( n ), in which equality occurs when n is prime. A maximal order for Ω( n ) is ln n / ln 2. 10   See also   Average order of an arithmetic function  Normal order of an arithmetic function   Notes  Further reading    A survey of extremal orders, with an extensive bibliography.
