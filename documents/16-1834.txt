Monoidal-category action

In algebra, an action of a monoidal category S on a category X is a functor


 
  such that there are natural isomorphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and those natural isomorphism satisfy the coherence conditions analogous to those in S.1 If there is such an action, S is said to act on X.
For example, S acts on itself via the monoid operation âŠ—.
