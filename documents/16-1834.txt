   Monoidal-category action      Monoidal-category action   In algebra, an action of a monoidal category  S on a category X is a functor      ⋅  :  S  ×  X  →  X     fragments  normal-⋅  normal-:  S   X  normal-→  X    \cdot:S\times X\to X   such that there are natural isomorphisms     s  ⋅   (   t  ⋅  x   )    ≃    (   s  ⋅  t   )   ⋅  x      similar-to-or-equals   normal-⋅  s   normal-⋅  t  x     normal-⋅   normal-⋅  s  t   x     s\cdot(t\cdot x)\simeq(s\cdot t)\cdot x   and     e  ⋅  x   ≃  x     similar-to-or-equals   normal-⋅  e  x   x    e\cdot x\simeq x   and those natural isomorphism satisfy the coherence conditions analogous to those in S . 1 If there is such an action, S is said to act on X .  For example, S acts on itself via the monoid operation ⊗.  References   C. Weibel " The K-book: An introduction to algebraic K-theory "   "  Category:Monoidal categories  Category:Functors     ↩
