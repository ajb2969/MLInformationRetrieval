   Ball-pen probe      Ball-pen probe   A ball-pen probe is novel technique used to measure directly the plasma potential 1 2 in strongly as well as weakly magnetized plasmas . The probe was invented by Jiří Adámek 1 in the Institute of Plasma Physics 2 AS CR in 2004. The ball-pen probe balances the electron saturation current to the same magnitude as that of the ion saturation current . In this case, its floating potential becomes identical to the plasma potential . This goal is attained by a ceramic shield, which screens off an adjustable part of the electron current from the probe collector due to the much smaller gyro–radius of the electrons. First systematic measurements have been performed on the CASTOR tokamak . 3 4 5 The probe has been already used at different fusion devices as ASDEX Upgrade , 6 7 8 9  COMPASS 10 11 12 13 14 3 , ISTTOK , 15 TJ-K 16 4 , RFX 5 , MAST , 17 18  H-1NF , 19 IR-T1 20 21 as well as low temperature devices as DC cylindrical magnetron in Prague 22 23 24 25 26 and linear magnetized plasma devices in Nancy 27 and Ljubljana . 28 29  How the ball-pen probe measures the plasma potential  If Langmuir probe (electrode) is inserted into a plasma , its potential generally lies considerably below the plasma potential   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   due to what is termed a Debye sheath . Thus, the potential of Langmuir probe is named as floating potential     V   f  l      subscript  V    f  l     V_{fl}   . Therefore, it is impossible to measure directly the plasma potential by simple Langmuir probe. The difference between plasma and floating potential is given by the electron temperature     T  e     subscript  T  e    T_{e}   [eV]:       V   f  l    =   Φ  -   α  *   T  e          subscript  V    f  l      normal-Φ    α   subscript  T  e       V_{fl}=\Phi-\alpha*T_{e}     and the coefficient   α   α   \alpha   . The coefficient is given by the ratio of the electron and ion saturation current density (    j  e   s  a  t      subscript   superscript  j    s  a  t    e    j^{sat}_{e}   and    j  i   s  a  t      subscript   superscript  j    s  a  t    i    j^{sat}_{i}   ) and collecting areas for electrons and ions (    A  e     subscript  A  e    A_{e}   and    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   )      α  =   l  n   (     A  e    j  e   s  a  t       A  i    j  i   s  a  t      )    =   l  n   (  R  )          α    l  n       subscript  A  e    subscript   superscript  j    s  a  t    e       subscript  A  i    subscript   superscript  j    s  a  t    i             l  n  R      \alpha=ln(\frac{A_{e}j^{sat}_{e}}{A_{i}j^{sat}_{i}})=ln(R)     The ball-pen probe, in magnetized plasma , modifies the collecting areas for electrons and ions and makes the ratio   R   R   R   equal to one. Thus, the coefficient   α   α   \alpha   is equal to zero and floating potential of ball-pen probe is equal to the plasma potential independently on electron temperature       V   f  l    =  Φ       subscript  V    f  l    normal-Φ    V_{fl}=\Phi     The ball-pen probe inserted into the magnetized plasma is directly on the plasma potential without additional power supplies or electronics.  The ball-pen probe design  The design of the ball-pen probe is shown in the schematic picture. The probe consists of a conically shaped collector (non-magnetic stainless steel , tungsten , copper , molybdenum ), which is shielded by an insulating tube ( boron nitride , Alumina ). The collector is fully shielded and the whole probe head must be oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines. It is necessary to find the sufficient retraction of ball-pen probe collector in order to reach    R  =  1      R  1    R=1   , which strongly depends on value of the magnetic field . The physics of ball-pen probe is not yet fully understood, but the collector retraction should be roughly below the ion Larmor radius. This "calibration" can be done in two different ways:  1) the ball-pen probe collector is biased by swept voltage (low frequency ) to provide the I-V characteristics and see both electron and ion saturation currents. The ball-pen probe collector is systematically retracted until the I-V characteristics become symmetric. In this case, the ratio   R   R   R   is close to one. However, the experimental observation at different fusion devices confirmed that the ratio   R   R   R   is close to one, but not equal. 30 31 32 The I-V characteristics remain symmetric as well as for deeper position of ball-pen probe collector.  2) the ball-pen probe collector is fully floating. The ball-pen probe collector is systematically retracted until its potential saturates at some value, which is above Langmuir probe potential. The floating potential of ball-pen probe remains almost constant as well as for deeper position.  The electron temperature measurements without power supply  The electron temperature can be measured by using ball-pen probe and common Langmuir probe with high temporal resolution in magnetized plasma without any external power supply . The electron temperature can be obtain from previous equation, assuming Maxwellian plasma       T  e   =    Φ  -   V   f  l     α        subscript  T  e       normal-Φ   subscript  V    f  l     α     T_{e}=\frac{\Phi-V_{fl}}{\alpha}     The value of coefficient   α   α   \alpha   is given by the Langmuir probe geometry, plasma gas ( Hydrogen , Deuterium , Helium , Argon , Neon ,...) and magnetic field . It can be partially effected by other features like secondary electron emission , sheath expansion etc. The coefficient   α   α   \alpha   can be calculated theoretically, 33 34 and its value is around 3 for non-magnetized hydrogen plasma. This value is obtained under assumption that the ion and electron temperatures are equal and there are no other above mentioned effects ( sheath expansion , ...). It should be also taken into account that ratio   R   R   R   of ball-pen probe is close to one, but not equal to one as mentioned above. 35 Therefore, the difference between ball-pen probe and Langmuir probe potential is given by the electron temperature, coefficient   α   α   \alpha   of Langmuir probe and empirical value of the ratio   R   R   R    36 37 38 39 40 of ball-pen probe (or you can use approximation    R  =  0      R  0    R=0   ). Therefore, the electron temperature can be simply measured by using formula       T  e   =     Φ   B  P  P    -   V   f  l      α  ¯         subscript  T  e        subscript  normal-Φ    B  P  P     subscript  V    f  l      normal-¯  α      T_{e}=\frac{\Phi_{BPP}-V_{fl}}{\bar{\alpha}}     with new coefficient    α  ¯     normal-¯  α    \bar{\alpha}   for different plasma condition      Device   Magnetic field   gas       α  ¯     normal-¯  α    \bar{\alpha}          COMPASS   1.15T   Deuterium   2.2     COMPASS (divertor region)   1.15T   Deuterium   2.2     ASDEX Upgrade   1.9T (on LFS)   Deuterium   2.2     MAST   0.6T   Deuterium   2.2     CASTOR   1T   Hydrogen   2.8     ISTTOK   0.6T   Hydrogen   2.3     TJ-K   0.07T   Hydrogen   3.0     IR-T1   0.7T   Hydrogen   2.8     DC cylindrical magnetron   0.04T   Argon   5.2     Linear device Mirabelle   0.08T   Argon   4.1     Linear device Mirabelle   0.08T   Helium   2.9     References  External links   PhD thesis, Jiri Adamek (Czech and English language) 6  Overview: Ball-pen probe design, theory and first results at different fusion devices 7 .  40th EPS Conference on Plasma, ISTTOK measurements 8 .
