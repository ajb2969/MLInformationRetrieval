Legg's equation

Legg's equation models magnetic material core loss at low flux densities. The equation has three loss components: hysteresis, residual, and eddy current.123
Equation



where


Rac is the effective core loss resistance (ohms)
 
μ is the material permeability

L is the inductance (henrys)
 
a hysteresis loss coefficient
 
Bmax is the maximum flux density (gauss)
 
c is the residual loss coefficient
 
f is the frequency (hertz)
 
e is the eddy loss coefficient
