   Legg's equation      Legg's equation   Legg's equation models magnetic material  core loss at low flux densities. The equation has three loss components: hysteresis, residual, and eddy current. 1 2 3  Equation        R  ac    μ  L    =    a   B  max   f   +   c  f   +   e   f  2            subscript  R  ac     μ  L        a   subscript  B  max   f     c  f     e   superscript  f  2       \frac{R_{\text{ac}}}{\mu L}=aB_{\text{max}}f+cf+ef^{2}     where    R ac is the effective core loss resistance (ohms)  μ is the material permeability   L is the inductance (henrys)  a hysteresis loss coefficient  B max is the maximum flux density (gauss)  c is the residual loss coefficient  f is the frequency (hertz)  e is the eddy loss coefficient     IEC Technical Committee is the modern definition. 4  References       "  Category:Electromagnetic components     ↩  ↩  ↩  refers to Publication 401 ↩
