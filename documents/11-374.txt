   Oligosaccharide-transporting ATPase      Oligosaccharide-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , an oligosaccharide-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + oligosaccharideout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + oligosaccharidein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and oligosaccharide , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and oligosaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (disaccharide-importing) .
