   Modulus (algebraic number theory)      Modulus (algebraic number theory)   In mathematics , in the field of algebraic number theory , a modulus (plural moduli ) (or cycle , 1 or extended ideal 2 ) is a formal product of places of a global field (i.e. an algebraic number field or a global function field ). It is used to encode ramification data for abelian extensions of a global field.  Definition  Let K be a global field with ring of integers  R . A modulus is a formal product 3 4       𝐦  =    ∏  𝐩    𝐩   ν   (  𝐩  )       ,    ν   (  𝐩  )    ≥  0      formulae-sequence    𝐦    subscript  product  𝐩    superscript  𝐩    ν  𝐩          ν  𝐩   0     \mathbf{m}=\prod_{\mathbf{p}}\mathbf{p}^{\nu(\mathbf{p})},\,\,\nu(\mathbf{p})\geq
 0     where p runs over all places of K , finite or infinite , the exponents ν( p ) are zero except for finitely many p . If K is a number field, ν( p ) = 0 or 1 for real places and ν( p ) = 0 for complex places. If K is a function field, ν( p ) = 0 for all infinite places.  In the function field case, a modulus is the same thing as an effective divisor , 5 and in the number field case, a modulus can be considered as special form of Arakelov divisor . 6  The notion of congruence can be extended to the setting of moduli. If a and b are elements of K × , the definition of a ≡ ∗ b (mod p ν ) depends on what type of prime p is: 7 8   if it is finite, then          a    ≡  ∗      b    (    mod    𝐩  ν    )     ⇔     ord  𝐩    (    a  b   -  1   )    ≥  ν      normal-⇔    superscript   normal-∗   a    b    mod   superscript  𝐩  ν           subscript  ord  𝐩       a  b   1    ν     a\equiv^{\ast}\!b\,(\mathrm{mod}\,\mathbf{p}^{\nu})\Leftrightarrow\mathrm{ord}%
 _{\mathbf{p}}\left(\frac{a}{b}-1\right)\geq\nu       where ord p is the normalized valuation associated to p ;    if it is a real place (of a number field) and ν = 1, then          a    ≡  ∗      b    (    mod   𝐩   )     ⇔    a  b   >  0      normal-⇔    superscript   normal-∗   a    b    mod  𝐩         a  b   0     a\equiv^{\ast}\!b\,(\mathrm{mod}\,\mathbf{p})\Leftrightarrow\frac{a}{b}>0       under the real embedding associated to p .    if it is any other infinite place, there is no condition.   Then, given a modulus m , a ≡ ∗ b (mod m ) if a ≡ ∗ b (mod p ν( p ) ) for all p such that ν( p ) > 0.  Ray class group  The ray modulo m is 9 10 11        K   𝐦  ,  1    =   {   a  ∈   K  ×    :   a    ≡  ∗      1    (    mod   𝐦   )     }    .       subscript  K   𝐦  1     conditional-set    a   superscript  K       superscript   normal-∗   a    1    mod  𝐦        K_{\mathbf{m},1}=\left\{a\in K^{\times}:a\equiv^{\ast}\!1\,(\mathrm{mod}\,%
 \mathbf{m})\right\}.     A modulus m can be split into two parts, m f and m ∞ , the product over the finite and infinite places, respectively. Let I m to be one of the following:   if K is a number field, the subgroup of the group of fractional ideals generated by ideals coprime to m f ; 12  if K is a function field of an algebraic curve over k , the group of divisors, rational over k , with support away from m . 13   In both case, there is a group homomorphism  i : K m ,1 → I m obtained by sending a to the principal ideal (resp. divisor ) ( a ).  The ray class group modulo m is the quotient C m = I m / i( K m ,1 ). 14 15 A coset of i( K m ,1 ) is called a ray class modulo m .  Erich Hecke 's original definition of Hecke characters may be interpreted in terms of characters of the ray class group with respect to some modulus m . 16  Properties  When K is a number field, the following properties hold. 17   When m = 1, the ray class group is just the ideal class group .  The ray class group is finite. Its order is the ray class number .  The ray class number is divisible by the class number of K .
