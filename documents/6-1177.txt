Group code

In computer science, group codes are a type of code. Group codes consist of 
 
 
linear block codes which are subgroups of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a finite Abelian group.
A systematic group code 
 
 
 
  is a code over 
 
 
 
  of order 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  homomorphisms which determine the parity check bits. The remaining 
 
 
 
  bits are the information bits themselves.
Construction
Group codes can be constructed by special generator matrices which resemble generator matrices of linear block codes except that the elements of those matrices are endomorphisms of the group instead of symbols from the code's alphabet. For example, consider the generator matrix



The elements of this matrix are 
 
 
 
  matrices which are endomorphisms. In this scenario, each codeword can be represented as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the generators of 
 
 
 
 .
