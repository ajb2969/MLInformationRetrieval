16S rRNA (guanine1405-N7)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (guanine1405-N7)-methyltransferase (, methyltransferase Sgm, m7G1405 Mtase, Sgm Mtase, Sgm, sisomicin-gentamicin methyltransferase, sisomicin-gentamicin methylase, GrmA, RmtB, RmtC, ArmA) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine1405-N7)-methyltransferase.123456789 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine1405 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 7-methylguanine1405 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates guanine1405 at N7 in 16S rRNA.
