ADP-phosphoglycerate phosphatase




ADP-phosphoglycerate phosphatase

In enzymology, an ADP-phosphoglycerate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-(ADP)-2-phosphoglycerate + H2O 
 
 
 
  3-(ADP)-glycerate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-(ADP)-2-phosphoglycerate and H2O, whereas its two products are 3-(ADP)-glycerate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-(ADP)-2-phosphoglycerate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called adenosine diphosphate phosphoglycerate phosphatase.
