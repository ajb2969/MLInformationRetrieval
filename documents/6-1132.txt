   Composition operator      Composition operator   In mathematics , the composition operator     C  ϕ     subscript  C  ϕ    C_{\phi}   with symbol   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a linear operator defined by the rule        C  ϕ    (  f  )    =   f  ∘  ϕ          subscript  C  ϕ   f     f  ϕ     C_{\phi}(f)=f\circ\phi     where    f  ∘  ϕ      f  ϕ    f\circ\phi   denotes function composition .  The study of composition operators is covered by AMS category 47B33 .  In physics  In physics , and especially the area of dynamical systems , the composition operator is usually referred to as the Koopman operator , 1 2 named after Bernard Koopman . It is the left-adjoint of the Frobenius-Perron or transfer operator .  In category theory  In the language of category theory , the composition operator is a pull-back on the space of measurable functions ; it is adjoint to the transfer operator in the same way that the pull-back is adjoint to the push-forward ; the composition operator is the inverse image functor .  In functional analysis  The domain of a composition operator is usually taken to be some Banach space , often consisting of holomorphic functions : for example, some Hardy space or Bergman space . Interesting questions posed in the study of composition operators often relate to how the spectral properties of the operator depend on the function space . Other questions include whether    C  ϕ     subscript  C  ϕ    C_{\phi}   is compact or trace-class ; answers typically depend on how the function φ behaves on the boundary of some domain.  Applications  In mathematics, composition operators commonly occur in the study of shift operators , for example, in the Beurling-Lax theorem and the Wold decomposition . Shift operators can be studied as one-dimensional spin lattices . Composition operators appear in the theory of Aleksandrov-Clark measures .  The eigenvalue equation of the composition operator is Schröder's equation , and the principal eigenfunction  f(x) is often called Schröder's function or Koenigs function .
