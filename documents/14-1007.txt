Quantum dilogarithm

In mathematics, the ' quantum dilogarithm' also known as q-exponential is a special function defined by the formula



Thus in the notation of the page on q-exponential mentioned above, 
 
 
 
  .
Let 
 
 
 
  be “q-commuting variables”, that is elements of a suitable noncommutative algebra satisfying Weyl’s relation 
 
 
 
 . Then, the quantum dilogarithm satisfies Schützenberger’s identity



Faddeev-Volkov's identity



and Faddeev-Kashaev's identity



The latter is known to be a quantum generalization of Roger's five term dilogarithm identity.
Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm

 
  is defined by the following formula:



where the contour of integration 
 
 
 
  goes along the real axis outside a small neighborhood of the origin and deviates into the upper half-plane near the origin. Ludvig Faddeev discovered the quantum pentagon identity:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are (normalized) quantum mechanical momentum and position operators satisfying Heisenberg's commutation relation



The quantum dilogarithm finds applications in mathematical physics, quantum topology, cluster algebra theory.
The precise relationship between the q-exponential and 
 
 
 
  is expressed by the equality



valid for Im
