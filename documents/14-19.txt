   Vibrational temperature      Vibrational temperature   The vibrational temperature is commonly used in thermodynamics , to simplify certain equations. It has units of temperature and is defined as       θ   v  i  b    =    h  ν    k  B         subscript  θ    v  i  b        h  ν    subscript  k  B      \theta_{vib}=\frac{h\nu}{k_{B}}    where    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is Boltzmann's constant  The vibrational temperature is used commonly when finding the vibrational partition function .
