Vibrational temperature




Vibrational temperature

The vibrational temperature is commonly used in thermodynamics, to simplify certain equations. It has units of temperature and is defined as



  where 
 
 
 
  is Boltzmann's constant
The vibrational temperature is used commonly when finding the vibrational partition function.
