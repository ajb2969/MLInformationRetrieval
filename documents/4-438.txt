   Epicycloid      Epicycloid   In geometry , an epicycloid is a plane curve produced by tracing the path of a chosen point of a circle — called an epicycle — which rolls without slipping around a fixed circle. It is a particular kind of roulette .  If the smaller circle has radius r , and the larger circle has radius R = kr , then the parametric equations for the curve can be given by either:       x   (  θ  )    =     (   R  +  r   )    cos  θ    -   r   cos   (     R  +  r   r   θ   )            x  θ         R  r     θ      r          R  r   r   θ        x(\theta)=(R+r)\cos\theta-r\cos\left(\frac{R+r}{r}\theta\right)           y   (  θ  )    =     (   R  +  r   )    sin  θ    -   r   sin   (     R  +  r   r   θ   )       ,        y  θ         R  r     θ      r          R  r   r   θ        y(\theta)=(R+r)\sin\theta-r\sin\left(\frac{R+r}{r}\theta\right),   or:       x   (  θ  )    =    r   (   k  +  1   )    cos  θ    -   r   cos   (    (   k  +  1   )   θ   )            x  θ       r    k  1     θ      r        k  1   θ        x(\theta)=r(k+1)\cos\theta-r\cos\left((k+1)\theta\right)\,           y   (  θ  )    =    r   (   k  +  1   )    sin  θ    -   r   sin   (    (   k  +  1   )   θ   )       .        y  θ       r    k  1     θ      r        k  1   θ        y(\theta)=r(k+1)\sin\theta-r\sin\left((k+1)\theta\right).\,     If k is an integer, then the curve is closed, and has k  cusps (i.e., sharp corners, where the curve is not differentiable ).  If k is a rational number , say k=p/q expressed in simplest terms, then the curve has p cusps.  If k is an irrational number , then the curve never closes, and forms a dense subset of the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius R + 2 r .

An epicycle with one cusp is a cardioid .  An epicycloid and its evolute are similar . 1  Proof  We assume that the position of   p   p   p   is what we want to solve,   α   α   \alpha   is the radian from the tangential point to the moving point   p   p   p   , and   θ   θ   \theta   is the radian from the starting point to the tangential point.  Since there is no sliding between the two cycles, then we have that       ℓ  R   =   ℓ  r        subscript  normal-ℓ  R    subscript  normal-ℓ  r     \ell_{R}=\ell_{r}   By the definition of radian (which is the rate arc over radius), then we have that        ℓ  R   =   θ  R    ,    ℓ  r   =   α  r       formulae-sequence     subscript  normal-ℓ  R     θ  R       subscript  normal-ℓ  r     α  r      \ell_{R}=\theta R,\ell_{r}=\alpha r   From these two conditions, we get the identity       θ  R   =   α  r         θ  R     α  r     \theta R=\alpha r   By calculating, we get the relation between   α   α   \alpha   and   θ   θ   \theta   , which is      α  =    R  r   θ       α      R  r   θ     \alpha=\frac{R}{r}\theta     From the figure, we see the position of the point   p   p   p   clearly.      x  =     (   R  +  r   )    cos  θ    -   r   cos   (   θ  +  α   )      =     (   R  +  r   )    cos  θ    -   r   cos   (     R  +  r   r   θ   )            x        R  r     θ      r      θ  α                 R  r     θ      r          R  r   r   θ         x=\left(R+r\right)\cos\theta-r\cos\left(\theta+\alpha\right)=\left(R+r\right)%
