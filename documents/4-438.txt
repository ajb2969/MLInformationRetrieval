Epicycloid

 In geometry, an epicycloid is a plane curve produced by tracing the path of a chosen point of a circle — called an epicycle — which rolls without slipping around a fixed circle. It is a particular kind of roulette.
If the smaller circle has radius r, and the larger circle has radius R = kr, then the parametric equations for the curve can be given by either:





 
  or:






If k is an integer, then the curve is closed, and has k cusps (i.e., sharp corners, where the curve is not differentiable).
If k is a rational number, say k=p/q expressed in simplest terms, then the curve has p cusps.
If k is an irrational number, then the curve never closes, and forms a dense subset of the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius R + 2r.

The epicycloid is a special kind of epitrochoid.
An epicycle with one cusp is a cardioid.
An epicycloid and its evolute are similar.1
Proof
 We assume that the position of 
 
 
 
  is what we want to solve, 
 
 
 
  is the radian from the tangential point to the moving point 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the radian from the starting point to the tangential point.
Since there is no sliding between the two cycles, then we have that


 
  By the definition of radian (which is the rate arc over radius), then we have that


 
  From these two conditions, we get the identity


 
  By calculating, we get the relation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , which is



From the figure, we see the position of the point 
 
 
 
  clearly.
