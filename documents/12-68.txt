   Martin's maximum      Martin's maximum   In set theory , Martin's maximum , introduced by , is a generalization of the proper forcing axiom , which is in turn a generalization of Martin's axiom . It represents the broadest class of forcings for which a forcing axiom is consistent.  Martin's maximum (MM) states that if D is a collection of    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   dense subsets of a notion of forcing that preserves stationary subsets of ω 1 , then there is a D -generic filter. It is a well known fact that forcing with a ccc notion of forcing preserves stationary subsets of ω 1 , thus MM extends MA(    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   ). If ( P ,≤) is not a stationary set preserving notion of forcing, i.e., there is a stationary subset of ω 1 , which becomes nonstationary when forcing with ( P ,≤), then there is a collection D of    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   dense subsets of ( P ,≤), such that there is no D -generic filter. This is why MM is called the maximal extension of Martin's axiom.  The existence of a supercompact cardinal implies the consistency of Martin's maximum. 1 The proof uses Shelah 's theories of semiproper forcing and iteration with revised countable supports.  MM implies that the value of the continuum is    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}    2 and that the ideal of nonstationary sets on ω 1 is    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}   -saturated. 3 It further implies stationary reflection, i.e., if S is a stationary subset of some regular cardinal κ≥ω 2 and every element of S has countable cofinality, then there is an ordinal α<κ such that S ∩α is stationary in α. In fact, S contains a closed subset of order type ω 1 .  References    correction     "  Category:Forcing (mathematics)     Jech (2003) p.684 ↩  Jech (2003) p.685 ↩  Jech (2003) p.687 ↩
