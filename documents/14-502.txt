Description
   We consider a multistage turbine, like in the picture. The design calculation is done for design flow rate (
 
 
 
 , the flow expected for the most uptime). The other parameters for design are the temperature and pressure at the stage group intake, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively the extraction pressure at the stage group outlet 
 
 
 
  (the symbol 
 
 
 
  is used for the pressure after a stage nozzles, pressure does not interfere in relations here).
For off-design calculations, the off-design flow rate is 
 
 
 
 , respectively the temperature and pressure at the stage group intake are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the outlet pressure is 
 
 
 
 .
Stodola established experimentally that the relationship between these three parameters represented in Cartesian coordinate system has the shape of a degenerate quadric surface, the cone directrix being an ellipse.34 For a constant initial pressure 
 
 
 
  the flow rate depends on the outlet pressure 
 
 
 
  as an arc of ellipse in a plane parallel to 
 
 

For very low outlet pressure 
 
 
 
 , like for condensing turbines, flow rates do not change with the outlet pressure, but drops very quickly with the increase of the backpressure. For a given outlet pressure 
 
 
 
 , flow rates changes depending on the inlet pressure 
 
 
 
  as an arc of hyperbola in a plane parallel to 
 
 
 
 .
Usually, Stodola's cone do not represent absolute flow rates and pressures, but relative to the maximum flow rate and pressures, the maximum values of the diagram having in this case the value of 1. The maximum flow rate has the symbol 
 
 
 
  and the maximum pressures at the inlet and outlet have the symbols 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The pressure ratios for design flow rate at the intake and outlet are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and the off-design ratios are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If the speed of sound is reached in a stage, the group of stages can be analyzed till that stage, which is the last in the group, the remaining stages forming another group of analysis. This division is imposed by the stage working in limited (choked) mode. The cone is shifted in the 
 
 
 
  axis direction, appearing a triangular surface, depending on the critical pressure ratio 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the outlet critical pressure of the stage group.56
The analytical expression of the flow ratio is:7



For condensing turbine the ratio 
 
 
 
  is very low, previous relation reduces to:


 
  simplified relationship obtained theoretically by Gustav Flügel (1885–1967).89
In the event that the variation of inlet temperature is low, the relationship is simplified:


 
  For condensing turbines 
 
 
 
 , so in this case:



During operation, the above relations allow the assessment of the flow rate depending on the operating pressure of a stage.
