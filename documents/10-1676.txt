   Methylaspartate mutase      Methylaspartate mutase   In enzymology , a methylaspartate mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-threo-3-methylaspartate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-glutamate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-threo-3-methylaspartate , and one product , L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threo-3-methylaspartate carboxy-aminomethylmutase . Other names in common use include glutamate mutase , glutamic mutase , glutamic isomerase , glutamic acid mutase , glutamic acid isomerase , methylaspartic acid mutase , beta-methylaspartate-glutamate mutase , and glutamate isomerase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , cobamide .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
