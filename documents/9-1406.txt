   Quasi-birth–death process      Quasi-birth–death process   In queueing models , a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , the quasi-birth–death process describes a generalisation of the birth–death process . 1 2 As with the birth-death process it moves up and down between levels one at a time, but the time between these transitions can have a more complicated distribution encoded in the blocks.  Discrete time  The stochastic matrix describing the Markov chain has block structure 3    P=\begin{pmatrix}     A_1^\ast & A_2^\ast \\ A_0^\ast & A_1 & A_2 \\ & A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ && A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ &&& \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \end{pmatrix}  where each of A 0 , A 1 and A 2 are matrices and A * 0 , A * 1 and A * 2 are irregular matrices for the first and second levels. 4  Continuous time  The transition rate matrix for a quasi-birth-death process has a tridiagonal block structure    Q=\begin{pmatrix}     B_{00} & B_{01} \\ B_{10} & A_1 & A_2 \\ & A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ && A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ &&& A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ &&&& \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \end{pmatrix}  where each of B 00 , B 01 , B 10 , A 0 , A 1 and A 2 are matrices. 5 The process can be viewed as a two dimensional chain where the block structure are called levels and the intra-block structure phases . 6 When describing the process by both level and phase it is a continuous-time Markov chain , but when considering levels only it is a semi-Markov process (as transition times are then not exponentially distributed).  Usually the blocks have finitely many phases, but models like the Jackson network can be considered as quasi-birth-death processes with infinitely (but countably ) many phases. 7 8  Stationary distribution  The stationary distribution of a quasi-birth-death process can be computed using the matrix geometric method .
