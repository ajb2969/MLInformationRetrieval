Banach–Mazur theorem

In mathematics, the Banach–Mazur theorem is a theorem of functional analysis. Very roughly, it states that most well-behaved normed spaces are subspaces of the space of continuous paths. It is named after Stefan Banach and Stanisław Mazur.
Statement of the theorem
Every real, separable Banach space

 
  is isometrically isomorphic to a closed subspace of , the space of all continuous functions from the unit interval into the real line.
Comments
On the one hand, the Banach–Mazur theorem seems to tell us that the seemingly vast collection of all separable Banach spaces is not that vast or difficult to work with, since a separable Banach space is "just" a collection of continuous paths. On the other hand, the theorem tells us that  is a "really big" space, big enough to contain every possible separable Banach space.
Non-separable Banach spaces cannot embed isometrically in the separable space , but for every Banach space 
 
 
 
 , one can find a compact Hausdorff space

 
  and an isometric linear embedding 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  into the space 
 
 
 
  of scalar continuous functions on 
 
 
 
 . The simplest choice is to let 
 
 
 
  be the unit ball of the continuous dual

 
 , equipped with the w*-topology. This unit ball 
 
 
 
  is then compact by the Banach–Alaoglu theorem. The embedding 
 
 
 
  is introduced by saying that for every 
 
 
 
 , the continuous function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is defined by



The mapping 
 
 
 
  is linear, and it is isometric by the Hahn–Banach theorem.
Another generalization was given by Kleiber and Pervin (1969): a metric space of density equal to an infinite cardinal 
 
 
 
  is isometric to a subspace of , the space of real continuous functions on the product of 
 
 
 
  copies of the unit interval.
Stronger versions of the theorem
Let us write  for . In 1995, Luis Rodríguez-Piazza proved that the isometry  can be chosen so that every non-zero function in the image

 
  is nowhere differentiable. Put another way, if  consists of functions that are differentiable at at least one point of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  can be chosen so that  This conclusion applies to the space  itself, hence there exists a linear map  that is an isometry onto its image, such that image under 
 
 
 
  of  (the subspace consisting of functions that are everywhere differentiable with continuous derivative) intersects 
 
 
 
  only at 
 
 
 
 : thus the space of smooth functions (with respect to the uniform distance) is isometrically isomorphic to a space of nowhere-differentiable functions. Note that the (metrically incomplete) space of smooth functions is dense in .
