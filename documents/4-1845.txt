   Virial expansion      Virial expansion   The classical virial expansion expresses the pressure of a many-particle system in equilibrium as a power series in the density . The virial expansion, introduced in 1901 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes , is a generalization of the ideal gas law. He wrote that for a gas containing   N   N   N   atoms or molecules,        p    k  B   T    =   ρ  +    B  2    (  T  )    ρ  2    +    B  3    (  T  )    ρ  3    +  ⋯    ,        p     subscript  k  B   T      ρ     subscript  B  2   T   superscript  ρ  2       subscript  B  3   T   superscript  ρ  3    normal-⋯     \frac{p}{k_{B}T}=\rho+B_{2}(T)\rho^{2}+B_{3}(T)\rho^{3}+\cdots,     where   p   p   p   is the pressure,    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   is the Boltzmann constant ,   T   T   T   is the absolute temperature, and    ρ  ≡   N  /  V       ρ    N  V     \rho\equiv N/V   is the number density of the gas. Note that for a gas containing a fraction   n   n   n   of    N  A     subscript  N  A    N_{A}   ( Avogadro's number ) molecules, truncation of the virial expansion after the first term leads to     p  V   =   n   N  A    k  B   T   =   n  R  T           p  V     n   subscript  N  A    subscript  k  B   T          n  R  T      pV=nN_{A}k_{B}T=nRT   , which is the ideal gas law .  Writing    β  =    (    k  B   T   )    -  1        β   superscript     subscript  k  B   T     1      \beta=(k_{B}T)^{-1}   , the virial expansion can be written as        β  p   ρ   =   1  +    ∑   i  =  1   ∞     B   i  +  1     (  T  )    ρ  i              β  p   ρ     1    superscript   subscript     i  1         subscript  B    i  1    T   superscript  ρ  i        \frac{\beta p}{\rho}=1+\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}B_{i+1}(T)\rho^{i}   .  The virial coefficients      B  i    (  T  )        subscript  B  i   T    B_{i}(T)   are characteristic of the interactions between the particles in the system and in general depend on the temperature   T   T   T   . Virial expansion can also be applied to aqueous ionic solutions , as shown by Harold Friedman .
