Virial expansion

The classical virial expansion expresses the pressure of a many-particle system in equilibrium as a power series in the density. The virial expansion, introduced in 1901 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, is a generalization of the ideal gas law. He wrote that for a gas containing 
 
 
 
  atoms or molecules,



where 
 
 
 
  is the pressure, 
 
 
 
  is the Boltzmann constant, 
 
 
 
  is the absolute temperature, and 
 
 
 
  is the number density of the gas. Note that for a gas containing a fraction 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  (Avogadro's number) molecules, truncation of the virial expansion after the first term leads to 
 
 
 
 , which is the ideal gas law.
Writing 
 
 
 
 , the virial expansion can be written as


 
 .
The virial coefficients

 
  are characteristic of the interactions between the particles in the system and in general depend on the temperature 
 
 
 
 . Virial expansion can also be applied to aqueous ionic solutions, as shown by Harold Friedman.
