   Curvature collineation      Curvature collineation   A curvature collineation (often abbreviated to CC ) is vector field which preserves the Riemann tensor in the sense that,       ℒ  X    R  a    =    b  c  d     0     fragments   subscript  ℒ  X    superscript  R  a    subscript     b  c  d    0    \mathcal{L}_{X}R^{a}{}_{bcd}=0     where     R  a      b  c  d       fragments   superscript  R  a      b  c  d      R^{a}{}_{bcd}   are the components of the Riemann tensor. The set of all smooth curvature collineations forms a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation (if the smoothness condition is dropped, the set of all curvature collineations need not form a Lie algebra). The Lie algebra is denoted by    C  C   (  M  )       C  C  M    CC(M)   and may be infinite - dimensional . Every affine vector field is a curvature collineation.
