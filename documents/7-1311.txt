   168P/Hergenrother      168P/Hergenrother   168P/Hergenrother is a periodic  comet in the solar system . The comet originally named P/1998 W2 returned in 2005 and got the temporary name P/2005 N2 . 1  The comet came to perihelion on 1 October 2012, 2 and was expected to reach about apparent magnitude 15.2, but due to an outburst the comet reached apparent magnitude 8. 3 As a result of the outburst of gas and dust, the comet was briefly more than 500 times brighter than it would have been without the outburst. 4 Images by the Faulkes Telescope North on 26 October 2012 confirm a fragmentation event . 5 The secondary fragment was about magnitude 17. Further observations by the Gemini telescope show that the comet fragmented into at least 4 parts. 6  References  External links   Orbital simulation from JPL (Java) / [ http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&body;_group=sb&sstr; ;=168P Horizons Ephemeris]  168P on Seiichi Yoshida's comet list  [ http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&o; ;=0168P Elements and Ephemeris for 168P/Hergenrother] â€“ Minor Planet Center  168P at Kronk's Cometography  Comet 168P Hergenrother in outburst (Google+ chat archive Oct 12, 2012)  Comet Hergenrother in Outburst (Carl Hergenrother : 20 Oct 2012)  Comet 168P and fragment as seen by Kitt Peak  WIYN on 30 Oct 2012  Scientists Monitor Comet Breakup (168P-Hergenrother was imaged by the NOAO/ Gemini telescope Nov. 2, 2012)  Temporal Correlation Between Outbursts and Fragmentation Events of Comet 168P/Hergenrother ( arXiv :1409.7641 : 26 Sep 2014)   "  Category:Comets  Category:Periodic comets
