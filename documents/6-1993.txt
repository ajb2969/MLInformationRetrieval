   Ductal      Ductal   Ductal® is a proprietary pre-mixed ultra-high performance concrete whose physical characteristics allegedly exceed those of common concrete used in the construction of buildings . It is manufactured by Lafarge and Bouygues . Ductal® is claimed to have high compressive strength and flexural resistance compared to other concretes. It also has high durability, abrasion resistance, and chemical/environmental resistances (e.g. freeze and thaw, salt water, etc.). Due to these properties, Ductal® can be used in thinner cross-sections and in more varied applications than common concrete. Ductal® is almost self placing and is best suited for precast elements or in-situ repair or upgrade works.  Ductal® is a ductile material that allegedly possesses ultra high compressive strength, high tensile strength and high durability together with high fatigue performance. It also claims excellent impact, blast and abrasion resistance.
