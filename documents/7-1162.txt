   Supporting hyperplane      Supporting hyperplane   In geometry , a supporting hyperplane of a set    S   S   S   in Euclidean space     ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   is a hyperplane that has both of the following two properties:      S   S   S   is entirely contained in one of the two closed  half-spaces bounded by the hyperplane     S   S   S   has at least one boundary-point on the hyperplane.   Here, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the points within the hyperplane.  Supporting hyperplane theorem  This theorem states that if   S   S   S   is a convex set in the topological vector space      X  =   ℝ  n    ,      X   superscript  ℝ  n     X=\mathbb{R}^{n},   and    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is a point on the boundary of    S  ,    S   S,   then there exists a supporting hyperplane containing     x  0   .     subscript  x  0    x_{0}.   If     x  *   ∈    X  *   \   {  0  }         superscript  x     normal-\   superscript  X     0      x^{*}\in X^{*}\backslash\{0\}   (    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   is the dual space of   X   X   X   ,    x  *     superscript  x     x^{*}   is a nonzero linear functional) such that      x  *    (   x  0   )    ≥    x  *    (  x  )           superscript  x     subscript  x  0       superscript  x    x     x^{*}\left(x_{0}\right)\geq x^{*}(x)   for all    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   , then      H  =   {   x  ∈  X   :     x  *    (  x  )    =    x  *    (   x  0   )     }       H   conditional-set    x  X        superscript  x    x      superscript  x     subscript  x  0        H=\{x\in X:x^{*}(x)=x^{*}\left(x_{0}\right)\}   defines a supporting hyperplane. 1  Conversely, if   S   S   S   is a closed set with nonempty interior such that every point on the boundary has a supporting hyperplane, then   S   S   S   is a convex set. 2  The hyperplane in the theorem may not be unique, as noticed in the second picture on the right. If the closed set   S   S   S   is not convex, the statement of the theorem is not true at all points on the boundary of    S  ,    S   S,   as illustrated in the third picture on the right.  The supporting hyperplanes of convex sets are also called tac-planes or tac-hyperplanes . 3  A related result is the separating hyperplane theorem , that every two disjoint convex sets can be separated by a hyperplane.
