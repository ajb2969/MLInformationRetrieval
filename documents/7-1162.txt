Supporting hyperplane

 In geometry, a supporting hyperplane of a set

 
  in Euclidean space

 
  is a hyperplane that has both of the following two properties:



 
  is entirely contained in one of the two closed half-spaces bounded by the hyperplane


 
 
  has at least one boundary-point on the hyperplane.

Here, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the points within the hyperplane.
Supporting hyperplane theorem
 This theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  is a convex set in the topological vector space

 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a point on the boundary of 
 
 
 
  then there exists a supporting hyperplane containing 
 
 
 
 
  If 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  is the dual space of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a nonzero linear functional) such that 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then


 
  defines a supporting hyperplane.1
Conversely, if 
 
 
 
  is a closed set with nonempty interior such that every point on the boundary has a supporting hyperplane, then 
 
 
 
  is a convex set.2
The hyperplane in the theorem may not be unique, as noticed in the second picture on the right. If the closed set 
 
 
 
 
  is not convex, the statement of the theorem is not true at all points on the boundary of 
 
 
 
  as illustrated in the third picture on the right.
The supporting hyperplanes of convex sets are also called tac-planes or tac-hyperplanes.3
A related result is the separating hyperplane theorem, that every two disjoint convex sets can be separated by a hyperplane.
