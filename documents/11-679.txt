Arylacetonitrilase

In enzymology, an arylacetonitrilase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-chlorophenylacetonitrile + 2 H2O 
 
 
 
  4-chlorophenylacetate + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile and H2O, whereas its two products are 4-chlorophenylacetate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in nitriles. The systematic name of this enzyme class is arylacetonitrile aminohydrolase. This enzyme participates in cyanoamino acid metabolism.
