   Electric potential energy      Electric potential energy   Electric potential energy , or electrostatic potential energy , is a potential energy (measured in joules ) that results from conservative  Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system . An object may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged objects .  The term "electric potential energy" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-variant  electric fields , while the term "electrostatic potential energy" is used to describe the potential energy in systems with time-invariant  electric fields .  Definition  We define the electric potential energy of a system of point charges as the work required assembling this system of charges by bringing them close together,as in the system from an infinite distance.   The electrostatic potential energy, U E , of one point charge q at position r in the presence of an electric field  E is defined as the negative of the work  W done by the electrostatic force to bring it from the reference position r ref 1 to that position r . 2 3 4     where E is the electrostatic field and d s is the displacement vector in a curve from the reference position r ref to the final position r .   The electrostatic potential energy can also be defined from the electric potential as follows:   The electrostatic potential energy, U E , of one point charge q at position r in the presence of an electric potential    Φ   normal-Φ   \scriptstyle\Phi   is defined as the product of the charge and the electric potential.    where   Φ   normal-Φ   \scriptstyle\Phi   is the electric potential generated by the charges, which is a function of position r .   Units  The SI unit of electric potential energy is the joule (named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule ). In the CGS system the erg is the unit of energy, being equal to 10 −7 J. Also electronvolts may be used, 1 eV = 1.602×10 −19 J.  Electrostatic potential energy of one point charge  One point charge q in the presence of one point charge Q  (Figure)  A point charge q in the electric field of another charge Q.|thumb|434px   The electrostatic potential energy, U E , of one point charge q at position r in the presence of a point charge Q , taking an infinite separation between the charges as the reference position, is:  where     k  e   =   1   4  π   ε  0          subscript  k  e     1    4  π   subscript  ε  0       k_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}   is Coulomb's constant , r is the distance between the point charges q & Q , and q & Q are the signed values of the charges (not the modules of the charges. For example, an electron would have a negative value of charge when placed in the formula). The following outline of proof states the derivation from the definition of electric potential energy and Coulomb's law to this formula.        Outline of proof       The electrostatic force F acting on a charge q can be written in terms of the electric field E as      𝐅  =   q  𝐄       𝐅    q  𝐄     \mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E}   , By definition, the electrostatic potential energy, U E , of one point charge q at position r in the presence of an electric field E is the negative of the work done by the electrostatic force to bring it from the reference position r ref to that position r .

This happens in time-invariant electric fields. When talking about electrostatic potential energy, time-invariant electric fields are always assumed so, in this case, the electric field is conservative and Coulomb's law can be used. Using Coulomb's law , it is known that the electrostatic force F and the electric field '''E ''' created by a discrete point charge Q are radially directed from Q . By the definition of the position vector r and the displacement vector s , it follows that r and s are also radially directed from Q . So, E and d s must be parallel:        𝐄  ⋅  d   𝐬   =     |  𝐄  |   ⋅   |   d  𝐬   |     cos   (  0  )     =   E  d  s            normal-⋅  𝐄  normal-d   𝐬      normal-⋅    𝐄       normal-d  𝐬       0           E  normal-d  s      \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}=|\mathbf{E}|\cdot|\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s}|%

 \varepsilon_{0}}\frac{qQ}{r}=k_{e}\frac{qQ}{r}          One point charge q in the presence of n point charges Q i  The electrostatic potential energy, U E , of one point charge q in the presence of n point charges Q i , taking an infinite separation between the charges as the reference position, is:  where     k  e   =   1   4  π   ε  0          subscript  k  e     1    4  π   subscript  ε  0       k_{e}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}   is Coulomb's constant , r i is the distance between the point charges q & Q i , and q & Q i are the signed values of the charges.  Electrostatic potential energy stored in a system of point charges  The electrostatic potential energy U E stored in a system of N charges q 1 , q 2 , ..., q N at positions r 1 , r 2 , ..., r N respectively, is:  | 1 }}  where, for each i value, Φ( r i ) is the electrostatic potential due to all point charges except the one at r i , 5 and is equal to:       Φ   (   𝐫  i   )    =    ∑   j  =  1    N   (  j  ≠  i  )       k  e     q  j    𝐫   i  j             normal-Φ   subscript  𝐫  i      superscript   subscript     j  1     fragments  N   fragments  normal-(  j   i  normal-)        subscript  k  e      subscript  q  j    subscript  𝐫    i  j         \Phi(\mathbf{r}_{i})=\sum_{j=1}^{N(j\neq i)}k_{e}\frac{q_{j}}{\mathbf{r}_{ij}}   ,  where r ij is the distance between q j and r i .        Outline of proof       The electrostatic potential energy U E stored in a system of two charges is equal to the electrostatic potential energy of a charge in the electrostatic potential generated by the other. That is to say, if charge q 1 generates an electrostatic potential Φ 1 , which is a function of position r , then        U  E   =    q  2    Φ  1    (   𝐫  2   )     .       subscript  U  normal-E      subscript  q  2    subscript  normal-Φ  1    subscript  𝐫  2      U_{\mathrm{E}}=q_{2}\Phi_{1}(\mathbf{r}_{2}).   Doing the same calculation with respect to the other charge, we obtain        U  E   =    q  1    Φ  2    (   𝐫  1   )     .       subscript  U  normal-E      subscript  q  1    subscript  normal-Φ  2    subscript  𝐫  1      U_{\mathrm{E}}=q_{1}\Phi_{2}(\mathbf{r}_{1}).   This can be generalized to say that the electrostatic potential energy U E stored in a system of N charges q 1 , q 2 , ..., q N at positions r 1 , r 2 , ..., r N respectively, is:     U  E   =    1  2     ∑   i  =  1   N     q  i   Φ   (   𝐫  i   )           subscript  U  normal-E       1  2     superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  q  i   normal-Φ   subscript  𝐫  i        U_{\mathrm{E}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}q_{i}\Phi(\mathbf{r}_{i})   .       Energy stored in a system of one point charge  The electrostatic potential energy of a system containing only one point charge is zero, as there are no other sources of electrostatic potential against which an external agent must do work in moving the point charge from infinity to its final location.  Energy stored in a system of two point charges  Consider bringing a point charge, q , into its final position in the vicinity of a point charge, Q 1 . The electrostatic potential Φ( r ) due to Q 1 is       Φ   (  r  )    =    k  e     Q  1   r          normal-Φ  r      subscript  k  e      subscript  Q  1   r      \Phi(r)=k_{e}\frac{Q_{1}}{r}     Hence we obtain, the electric potential energy of q in the potential of Q 1 as       U  E   =    1   4  π   ε  0       q   Q  1     r  1          subscript  U  E       1    4  π   subscript  ε  0         q   subscript  Q  1     subscript  r  1       U_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{qQ_{1}}{r_{1}}     where r 1 is the separation between the two point charges.  Energy stored in a system of three point charges  The electrostatic potential energy of a system of three charges should not be confused with the electrostatic potential energy of Q 1 due to two charges Q 2 and Q 3 , because the latter doesn't include the electrostatic potential energy of the system of the two charges Q 2 and Q 3 .  The electrostatic potential energy stored in the system of three charges is:       U  E   =    1   4  π   ε  0      (      Q  1    Q  2     r  12    +     Q  1    Q  3     r  13    +     Q  2    Q  3     r  23     )         subscript  U  normal-E       1    4  π   subscript  ε  0            subscript  Q  1    subscript  Q  2     subscript  r  12         subscript  Q  1    subscript  Q  3     subscript  r  13         subscript  Q  2    subscript  Q  3     subscript  r  23        U_{\mathrm{E}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r_{12}}+%

Energy in electronic elements  Some elements in a circuit can convert energy from one form to another. For example, a resistor converts electrical energy to heat, this is known as the Joule effect . A capacitor stores it in its electric field. The total electric potential energy stored in a capacitor is given by       U  E   =    1  2   Q  V   =    1  2   C   V  2    =    Q  2    2  C           subscript  U  E       1  2   Q  V            1  2   C   superscript  V  2            superscript  Q  2     2  C       U_{E}=\frac{1}{2}QV=\frac{1}{2}CV^{2}=\frac{Q^{2}}{2C}     where C is the capacitance , V is the electric potential difference, and Q the charge stored in the capacitor.
