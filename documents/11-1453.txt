CDP-ribitol ribitolphosphotransferase

In enzymology, a CDP-ribitol ribitolphosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CDP-ribitol + (ribitol phosphate)n 
 
 
 
  CMP + (ribitol phosphate)n+1
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-ribitol and (ribitol phosphate)n, whereas its two products are CMP and (ribitol phosphate)n+1.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-ribitol:poly(ribitol phosphate) ribitolphosphotransferase. Other names in common use include teichoic-acid synthase, polyribitol phosphate synthetase, teichoate synthetase, poly(ribitol phosphate) synthetase, polyribitol phosphate polymerase, and teichoate synthase.
