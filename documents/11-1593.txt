Pyruvate, water dikinase

In enzymology, a pyruvate, water dikinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + pyruvate + H2O 
 
 
 
  AMP + phosphoenolpyruvate + phosphate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, pyruvate, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are AMP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, to be specific, those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with paired acceptors (dikinases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:pyruvate, water phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, pyruvate-water dikinase (phosphorylating), PEP synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, phoephoenolpyruvate synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvic synthase, and phosphopyruvate synthetase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and reductive carboxylate cycle ( fixation). It employs one cofactor, manganese.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
