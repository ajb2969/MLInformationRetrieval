   MacCormack method      MacCormack method   In computational fluid dynamics , the MacCormack method is a widely used discretization scheme for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations . This second-order finite difference method was introduced by Robert W. MacCormack in 1969. 1 The MacCormack method is elegant and easy to understand and program. 2  The algorithm  The MacCormack method is a variation of the two-step Lax–Wendroff scheme but is much simpler in application. To illustrate the algorithm, consider the following first order hyperbolic equation          ∂  u    ∂  t     +   a    ∂  u    ∂  x      =  0.            u     t      a      u     x      0.    \qquad\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+a\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0.   The application of MacCormack method to the above equation proceeds in two steps; a predictor step which is followed by a corrector step .  Predictor step: In the predictor step, a "provisional" value of   u   u   u   at time level    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   (denoted by    u  i    n  +  1   ¯      superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1      u_{i}^{\overline{n+1}}   ) is estimated as follows       u  i    n  +  1   ¯    =    u  i  n   -   a    Δ  t    Δ  x     (    u   i  +  1   n   -   u  i  n    )          superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1        superscript   subscript  u  i   n     a      normal-Δ  t     normal-Δ  x       superscript   subscript  u    i  1    n    superscript   subscript  u  i   n        u_{i}^{\overline{n+1}}=u_{i}^{n}-a\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left(u_{i+1}^{n}-u%
 _{i}^{n}\right)   It may be noted that the above equation is obtained by replacing the spatial and temporal derivatives in the previous first order hyperbolic equation using forward differences .  Corrector step: In the corrector step, the predicted value    u  i    n  +  1   ¯      superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1      u_{i}^{\overline{n+1}}   is corrected according to the equation       u  i   n  +  1    =    u  i   n  +   1  /  2     -   a    Δ  t    2  Δ  x     (    u  i    n  +  1   ¯    -   u   i  -  1     n  +  1   ¯     )          superscript   subscript  u  i     n  1       superscript   subscript  u  i     n    1  2       a      normal-Δ  t     2  normal-Δ  x       superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1      superscript   subscript  u    i  1     normal-¯    n  1          u_{i}^{n+1}=u_{i}^{n+1/2}-a\frac{\Delta t}{2\Delta x}\left(u_{i}^{\overline{n+%
 1}}-u_{i-1}^{\overline{n+1}}\right)   Note that the corrector step uses backward finite difference approximations for spatial derivative. Note also that the time-step used in the corrector step is     Δ  t   /  2        normal-Δ  t   2    \Delta t/2   in contrast to the    Δ  t      normal-Δ  t    \Delta t   used in the predictor step.  Replacing the    u  i   n  +   1  /  2       superscript   subscript  u  i     n    1  2      u_{i}^{n+1/2}   term by the temporal average       u  i   n  +   1  /  2     =     u  i  n   +   u  i    n  +  1   ¯     2        superscript   subscript  u  i     n    1  2          superscript   subscript  u  i   n    superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1      2     u_{i}^{n+1/2}=\frac{u_{i}^{n}+u_{i}^{\overline{n+1}}}{2}   to obtain the corrector step as       u  i   n  +  1    =      u  i  n   +   u  i    n  +  1   ¯     2   -   a    Δ  t    2  Δ  x     (    u  i    n  +  1   ¯    -   u   i  -  1     n  +  1   ¯     )          superscript   subscript  u  i     n  1           superscript   subscript  u  i   n    superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1      2     a      normal-Δ  t     2  normal-Δ  x       superscript   subscript  u  i    normal-¯    n  1      superscript   subscript  u    i  1     normal-¯    n  1          u_{i}^{n+1}=\frac{u_{i}^{n}+u_{i}^{\overline{n+1}}}{2}-a\frac{\Delta t}{2%
 \Delta x}\left(u_{i}^{\overline{n+1}}-u_{i-1}^{\overline{n+1}}\right)     Some remarks  The MacCormack method is well suited for nonlinear equations (Inviscid Burgers equation , Euler equations , etc.) The order of differencing can be reversed for the time step (i.e., forward/backward followed by backward/forward). For nonlinear equations, this procedure provides the best results. For linear equations, the MacCormack scheme is equivalent to the Lax–Wendroff method . 3  Unlike first-order upwind scheme , the MacCormack does not introduce diffusive errors in the solution. However, it is known to introduce dispersive errors ( Gibbs phenomenon ) in the region where the gradient is high.
