   Rising sun lemma      Rising sun lemma   (Figure)  Rising sun lemma.svg   In mathematical analysis , the rising sun lemma is a lemma due to Frigyes Riesz , used in the proof of the Hardy–Littlewood maximal theorem . The lemma was a precursor in one dimension of the Calderón–Zygmund lemma . 1  The lemma is stated as follows: See:          Let g ( x ) be a real-valued continuous function on the interval [ a , b ], and let E be the set of x ∈ (a, b ) such that g ( y ) > g ( x ) for some y with x < y < b .    Then E is an open set, and can be written as a disjoint union of intervals     E  =    ⋃  k    (   a  k   ,   b  k   )        E    subscript   k     subscript  a  k    subscript  b  k       E=\bigcup_{k}(a_{k},b_{k})      such that g ( a k ) = g ( b k ), except possibly if a k = a when g ( b k ) ≥ g ( a k ).   The colorful name of the lemma comes from imagining the graph of the function g as a mountainous landscape, with the sun shining horizontally from the right. The set E consist of points that are in the shadow.  Proof  The set E is open, so it is composed of a countable disjoint union of intervals ( a n , b n ).  The main step is to show that g ( b n ) ≥ g ( x ) for x in ( a n , b n ). If not take x with g ( b n ) n ] consisting of points y such that g ( y ) ≥ g ( x ). It contains x but not b n . It has a largest element, z say. Since z lies in E , there is a y with z  g ( z ). Since b n ∉ E , g ( t ) ≤ g ( b n ) if b n ≤ t ≤ b . Since g ( y ) > g ( z ) ≥ g ( x ) > g ( b n ), y must lie in ( z , b n ). That contradicts the maximality of z . Hence g ( b n ) ≥ g ( a n ).  If a n ≠ a , the reverse inequality holds. In fact since a n ∉ E , g ( y ) ≤ g ( a n ) if a n ≤ y ≤ b . So g ( b n ) ≤ g ( a n ). Hence g ( b n ) = g ( a n ). If g ( x ) = g ( a n ) at an interior point, then g ( y ) ≤ g ( x ) for x        .     "  Category:Real analysis  Category:Lemmas     ↩
