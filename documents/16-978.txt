Rankin–Cohen bracket

In mathematics, the Rankin–Cohen bracket of two modular forms is another modular form, generalizing the product of two modular forms.  gave some general conditions for polynomials in derivatives of modular forms to be modular forms, and  found the explicit examples of such polynomials that give Rankin–Cohen brackets. They were named by , who introduced Rankin–Cohen algebras as an abstract setting for Rankin–Cohen brackets.
Definition
If f and g are modular form of weight k and h respectively then their nth Rankin–Cohen bracket [f,g]n is given by


 
  It is a modular form of weight k + h + 2n.
Representation theory
The mysterious formula for the Rankin–Cohen bracket can be explained in terms of representation theory. Modular forms can be regarded as lowest weight vectors for discrete series representations of SL2(R) in a space of functions on SL2(R)/SL2(Z). The tensor product of two lowest weight representations corresponding to modular forms f and g splits as a direct sum of lowest weight representations indexed by non-negative integers n, and a short calculation shows that the corresponding lowest weight vectors are the Rankin–Cohen brackets [f,g]n.
