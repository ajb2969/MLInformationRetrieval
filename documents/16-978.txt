   Rankin–Cohen bracket      Rankin–Cohen bracket   In mathematics, the Rankin–Cohen bracket of two modular forms is another modular form, generalizing the product of two modular forms.  gave some general conditions for polynomials in derivatives of modular forms to be modular forms, and  found the explicit examples of such polynomials that give Rankin–Cohen brackets. They were named by , who introduced Rankin–Cohen algebras as an abstract setting for Rankin–Cohen brackets.  Definition  If f and g are modular form of weight k and h respectively then their n th Rankin–Cohen bracket [ f , g ] n is given by         [  f  ,  g  ]   n   =    ∑    r  +  s   =  n       (   -  1   )   r    (       k  +  n   -  1       r     )    (       h  +  n   -  1       s     )      d  r   f    d   τ  r         d  s   g    d   τ  s         .       subscript   f  g   n     subscript       r  s   n       superscript    1   r    binomial      k  n   1   r    binomial      h  n   1   s        superscript  d  r   f     d   superscript  τ  r          superscript  d  s   g     d   superscript  τ  s         [f,g]_{n}=\sum_{r+s=n}(-1)^{r}{\left({{k+n-1}\atop{r}}\right)}{\left({{h+n-1}%
 \atop{s}}\right)}\frac{d^{r}f}{d\tau^{r}}\frac{d^{s}g}{d\tau^{s}}\ .   It is a modular form of weight k + h + 2 n .  Representation theory  The mysterious formula for the Rankin–Cohen bracket can be explained in terms of representation theory . Modular forms can be regarded as lowest weight vectors for discrete series representations of SL 2 ( R ) in a space of functions on SL 2 ( R )/SL 2 ( Z ). The tensor product of two lowest weight representations corresponding to modular forms f and g splits as a direct sum of lowest weight representations indexed by non-negative integers n , and a short calculation shows that the corresponding lowest weight vectors are the Rankin–Cohen brackets [ f , g ] n .
