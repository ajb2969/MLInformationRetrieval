   Ford circle      Ford circle   upright=1.35|right|thumb|Ford circles for q from 1 to 20. Circles with q ≤ 10 are labelled as    p  q      p  q    \frac{p}{q}   and colour-coded according to q . Each circle is tangential to the base line and its neighboring circles. Irreducible fractions with the same denominator have circles of the same size.  In mathematics , a Ford circle is a circle with centre at    (   p  /  q   ,   1  /   (   2   q  2    )    )       p  q     1    2   superscript  q  2       (p/q,1/(2q^{2}))   and radius      1  /   (   2   q  2    )    ,      1    2   superscript  q  2      1/(2q^{2}),   where    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   is an irreducible fraction , i.e.   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   are coprime  integers . Each Ford circle is tangent to the horizontal axis     y  =  0   ,      y  0    y=0,   and any two circles are either tangent or disjoint from each other. 1  History  Ford circles are a special case of mutually tangent circles; the base line can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius. Systems of mutually tangent circles were studied by Apollonius of Perga , after whom the problem of Apollonius and the Apollonian gasket are named. 2 In the 17th century René Descartes discovered Descartes' theorem , a relationship between the reciprocals of the radii of mutually tangent circles. 3  Ford circles also appear in the Sangaku (geometrical puzzles) of Japanese mathematics . A typical problem, which is presented on an 1824 tablet in the Gunma Prefecture , covers the relationship of three touching circles with a common tangent . Given the size of the two outer large circles, what is the size of the small circle between them? The answer is equivalent to a Ford circle: 4        1    r  middle     =    1    r  left     +   1    r  right       .        1     subscript  r  middle         1     subscript  r  left       1     subscript  r  right        \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_{\text{middle}}}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{r_{\text{left}}}}+\frac{1}{%
 \sqrt{r_{\text{right}}}}.     Ford circles are named after the American mathematician Lester R. Ford, Sr. , who wrote about them in 1938. 5  Properties  The Ford circle associated with the fraction    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   is denoted by    C   [   p  /  q   ]       C   delimited-[]    p  q      C[p/q]   or     C   [  p  ,  q  ]    .      C   p  q     C[p,q].   There is a Ford circle associated with every rational number . In addition, the line    y  =  1      y  1    y=1   is counted as a Ford circle – it can be thought of as the Ford circle associated with infinity , which is the case     p  =  1   ,   q  =  0.      formulae-sequence    p  1     q  0.     p=1,q=0.     Two different Ford circles are either disjoint or tangent to one another. No two interiors of Ford circles intersect, even though there is a Ford circle tangent to the x -axis at each point on it with rational coordinates. If    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   is between 0 and 1, the Ford circles that are tangent to    C   [   p  /  q   ]       C   delimited-[]    p  q      C[p/q]   can be described variously as   the circles    C   [   r  /  s   ]       C   delimited-[]    r  s      C[r/s]   where      |    p  s   -   q  r    |   =  1   ,            p  s     q  r     1    |ps-qr|=1,    6  the circles associated with the fractions    r  /  s      r  s    r/s   that are the neighbours of    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   in some Farey sequence , 7 or  the circles    C   [   r  /  s   ]       C   delimited-[]    r  s      C[r/s]   where    r  /  s      r  s    r/s   is the next larger or the next smaller ancestor to    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   in the Stern–Brocot tree or where    p  /  q      p  q    p/q   is the next larger or next smaller ancestor to    r  /  s      r  s    r/s   . 8   Ford circles can also be thought of as curves in the complex plane . The modular group of transformations of the complex plane maps Ford circles to other Ford circles. 9  By interpreting the upper half of the complex plane as a model of the hyperbolic plane (the Poincaré half-plane model) Ford circles can also be interpreted as a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by horocycles . Any two Ford circles are congruent in hyperbolic geometry . 10 If    C   [   p  /  q   ]       C   delimited-[]    p  q      C[p/q]   and    C   [   r  /  s   ]       C   delimited-[]    r  s      C[r/s]   are tangent Ford circles, then the half-circle joining    (   p  /  q   ,  0  )       p  q   0    (p/q,0)   and    (   r  /  s   ,  0  )       r  s   0    (r/s,0)   that is perpendicular to the   x   x   x   -axis is a hyperbolic line that also passes through the point where the two circles are tangent to one another.  Ford circles are a sub-set of the circles in the Apollonian gasket generated by the lines    y  =  0      y  0    y=0   and    y  =  1      y  1    y=1   and the circle     C   [   0  /  1   ]    .      C   delimited-[]    0  1      C[0/1].    11  Total area of Ford circles  There is a link between the area of Ford circles, Euler's totient function     φ  ,    φ   \varphi,   the Riemann zeta function     ζ  ,    ζ   \zeta,   and Apéry's constant      ζ   (  3  )    .      ζ  3    \zeta(3).    12 As no two Ford circles intersect, it follows immediately that the total area of the Ford circles      {   C   [  p  ,  q  ]    :   0  ≤   p  q   ≤  1   }     conditional-set    C   p  q        0    p  q        1      \left\{C[p,q]:0\leq\frac{p}{q}\leq 1\right\}     is less than 1. In fact the total area of these Ford circles is given by a convergent sum, which can be evaluated. From the definition, the area is       A  =    ∑   q  ≥  1      ∑        (  p  ,  q  )   =  1        1  ≤  p  <  q         π    (   1   2   q  2     )   2       .      A    subscript     q  1      subscript    STACKED     p  q   1       1  p       q        π   superscript    1    2   superscript  q  2     2        A=\sum_{q\geq 1}\sum_{(p,q)=1\atop 1\leq p     Simplifying this expression gives       A  =    π  4     ∑   q  ≥  1      1   q  4      ∑        (  p  ,  q  )   =  1        1  ≤  p  <  q        1      =    π  4     ∑   q  ≥  1      φ   (  q  )     q  4      =    π  4     ζ   (  3  )     ζ   (  4  )       ,        A      π  4     subscript     q  1        1   superscript  q  4      subscript    STACKED     p  q   1       1  p       q      1               π  4     subscript     q  1        φ  q    superscript  q  4               π  4       ζ  3     ζ  4        A=\frac{\pi}{4}\sum_{q\geq 1}\frac{1}{q^{4}}\sum_{(p,q)=1\atop 1\leq p     where the last equality reflects the Dirichlet generating function for Euler's totient function      φ   (  q  )    .      φ  q    \varphi(q).   Since      ζ   (  4  )    =    π  4   /  90    ,        ζ  4      superscript  π  4   90     \zeta(4)=\pi^{4}/90,   this finally becomes      A  =    45  2     ζ   (  3  )     π  3     ≈  0.872284041.        A      45  2       ζ  3    superscript  π  3          0.872284041.     A=\frac{45}{2}\frac{\zeta(3)}{\pi^{3}}\approx 0.872284041.
