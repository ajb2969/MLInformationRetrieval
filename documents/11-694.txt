Citrullinase

In enzymology, a citrullinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-citrulline + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-ornithine + CO2 + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-citrulline and H2O, whereas its 3 products are L-ornithine, CO2, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-citrulline N5-carbamoyldihydrolase. Other names in common use include citrulline ureidase, citrulline hydrolase, and L-citrulline 5-N-carbamoyldihydrolase.
