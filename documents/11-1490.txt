Galacturonokinase

In enzymology, a galacturonokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + D-galacturonate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1-phospho-alpha-D-galacturonate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-galacturonate, whereas its two products are ADP and 1-phospho-alpha-D-galacturonate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-galacturonate 1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called galacturonokinase (phosphorylating) D-galacturonic acid kinase. This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism.
