   Final topology      Final topology   In general topology and related areas of mathematics , the final topology (or strong topology or colimit topology or inductive topology ) on a set    X   X   X   , with respect to a family of functions into   X   X   X   , is the finest topology on X which makes those functions continuous .  The dual notion is the initial topology .  Definition  Given a set   X   X   X   and a family of topological spaces     Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   with functions       f  i   :    Y  i   →  X      normal-:   subscript  f  i    normal-→   subscript  Y  i   X     f_{i}:Y_{i}\to X   the final topology    τ   τ   \tau   on   X   X   X   is the finest topology such that each       f  i   :    Y  i   →   (  X  ,  τ  )       normal-:   subscript  f  i    normal-→   subscript  Y  i    X  τ      f_{i}:Y_{i}\to(X,\tau)   is continuous .  Explicitly, the final topology may be described as follows: a subset U of X is open if and only if      f  i   -  1     (  U  )        superscript   subscript  f  i     1    U    f_{i}^{-1}(U)   is open in Y i for each i ∈ I .  Examples   The quotient topology is the final topology on the quotient space with respect to the quotient map .  The disjoint union is the final topology with respect to the family of canonical injections .  More generally, a topological space is coherent with a family of subspaces if it has the final topology coinduced by the inclusion maps.  The direct limit of any direct system of spaces and continuous maps is the set-theoretic direct limit together with the final topology determined by the canonical morphisms.  Given a family of topologies {τ i } on a fixed set X the final topology on X with respect to the functions id X : ( X , τ i ) → X is the infimum (or meet) of the topologies {τ i } in the lattice of topologies on X . That is, the final topology τ is the intersection of the topologies {τ i }.  The etale space of a sheaf is topologized by a final topology.   Properties  A subset of   X   X   X   is closed/open if and only if its preimage under f i is closed/open in    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   for each i ∈ I .  The final topology on X can be characterized by the following universal property : a function   g   g   g   from   X   X   X   to some space   Z   Z   Z   is continuous if and only if    g  ∘   f  i       g   subscript  f  i     g\circ f_{i}   is continuous for each i ∈ I .  By the universal property of the disjoint union topology we know that given any family of continuous maps f i : Y i → X there is a unique continuous map      f  :     ∐  i    Y  i    →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→    subscript  coproduct  i    subscript  Y  i    X     f\colon\coprod_{i}Y_{i}\to X   If the family of maps f i  covers  X (i.e. each x in X lies in the image of some f i ) then the map f will be a quotient map if and only if X has the final topology determined by the maps f i .  Categorical description  In the language of category theory , the final topology construction can be described as follows. Let Y be a functor from a discrete category  J to the category of topological spaces  Top which selects the spaces Y i for i in J . Let Δ be the diagonal functor from Top to the functor category  Top J (this functor sends each space X to the constant functor to X ). The comma category ( Y ↓ Δ) is then the category of cones from Y , i.e. objects in ( Y ↓ Δ) are pairs ( X , f ) where f i : Y i → X is a family of continuous maps to X . If U is the forgetful functor from Top to Set and Δ′ is the diagonal functor from Set to Set J then the comma category ( UY ↓ Δ′) is the category of all cones from UY . The final topology construction can then be described as a functor from ( UY ↓ Δ′) to ( Y ↓ Δ). This functor is left adjoint to the corresponding forgetful functor.
