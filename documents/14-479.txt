   Thompson order formula      Thompson order formula   In mathematical finite  group theory , the Thompson order formula , introduced by John Griggs Thompson , gives a formula for the order of a finite group in terms of the centralizers of involutions, extending the results of .  Statement  If a finite group G has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions with representatives t and z , then the Thompson order formula   states   |G| = |C G ( z )| a ( t ) + |C G ( t )| a ( z )   Here a ( x ) is the number of pairs ( u , v ) with u conjugate to t , v conjugate to z , and x in the subgroup generated by uv .  gives the following more complicated version of the Thompson order formula for the case when G has more than two conjugacy classes of involution.       |  G  |   =    C  G    (  t  )    C  G    (  z  )     ∑  x     a   (  x  )      C  G    (  x  )             G      subscript  C  G   t   subscript  C  G   z    subscript   x       a  x      subscript  C  G   x        |G|=C_{G}(t)C_{G}(z)\sum_{x}\frac{a(x)}{C_{G}(x)}   where t and z are non-conjugate involutions, the sum is over a set of representatives x for the conjugacy classes of involutions, and a ( x ) is the number of ordered pairs of involutions u , v such that u is conjugate to t , v is conjugate to z , and x is the involution in the subgroup generated by tz .  Proof  The Thompson order formula can be rewritten as         |  G  |     C  G    (  z  )       |  G  |     C  G    (  t  )      =    ∑  x    a   (  x  )     |  G  |     C  G    (  x  )                 G      subscript  C  G   z        G      subscript  C  G   t       subscript   x     a  x      G      subscript  C  G   x        \frac{|G|}{C_{G}(z)}\frac{|G|}{C_{G}(t)}=\sum_{x}a(x)\frac{|G|}{C_{G}(x)}     where as before the sum is over a set of representatives x for the classes of involutions. The left hand side is the number of pairs on involutions ( u , v ) with u conjugate to t , v conjugate to z . The right hand side counts these pairs in classes, depending the class of the involution in the cyclic group generated by uv . The key point is that uv has even order (as if it had odd order then u and v would be conjugate) and so the group it generates contains a unique involution x .
