   Morse–Palais lemma      Morse–Palais lemma   In mathematics , the Morse–Palais lemma is a result in the calculus of variations and theory of Hilbert spaces . Roughly speaking, it states that a smooth enough function near a critical point can be expressed as a quadratic form after a suitable change of coordinates.  The Morse–Palais lemma was originally proved in the finite-dimensional case by the American  mathematician  Marston Morse , using the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process . This result plays a crucial role in Morse theory . The generalization to Hilbert spaces is due to Richard Palais and Stephen Smale .  Statement of the lemma  Let ( H , 〈 , 〉) be a real Hilbert space, and let U be an open neighbourhood of 0 in H . Let f : U → R be a ( k + 2)-times continuously differentiable function with k ≥ 1, i.e. f ∈ C k +2 ( U ; R ). Assume that f (0) = 0 and that 0 is a non-degenerate critical point of f , i.e. the second derivative D 2 f (0) defines an isomorphism of H with its continuous dual space  H ∗ by       H  ∋  x  ↦    D  2   f   (  0  )    (  x  ,  -  )    ∈   H  *    .       contains  H  x    maps-to       superscript  normal-D  2   f  0   x           superscript  H       H\ni x\mapsto\mathrm{D}^{2}f(0)(x,-)\in H^{*}.\,     Then there exists a subneighbourhood V of 0 in U , a diffeomorphism  φ : V → V that is C k with C k inverse, and an invertible  symmetric operator  A : H → H , such that       f   (  x  )    =   ⟨   A  φ   (  x  )    ,   φ   (  x  )    ⟩         f  x      A  φ  x     φ  x      f(x)=\langle A\varphi(x),\varphi(x)\rangle     for all x ∈ V .  Corollary  Let f : U → R be C k +2 such that 0 is a non-degenerate critical point. Then there exists a C k -with- C k -inverse diffeomorphism ψ : V → V and an orthogonal decomposition       H  =   G  ⊕   G  ⟂     ,      H   direct-sum  G   superscript  G  perpendicular-to      H=G\oplus G^{\perp},     such that, if one writes         ψ   (  x  )    =   y  +   z  with  y    ∈  G   ,   z  ∈   G  ⟂     ,     formulae-sequence        ψ  x     y    z  with  y         G      z   superscript  G  perpendicular-to      \psi(x)=y+z\mbox{ with }y\in G,z\in G^{\perp},     then       f   (   ψ   (  x  )    )    =    ⟨  y  ,  y  ⟩   -   ⟨  z  ,  z  ⟩          f    ψ  x       y  y    z  z      f(\psi(x))=\langle y,y\rangle-\langle z,z\rangle     for all x ∈ V .
