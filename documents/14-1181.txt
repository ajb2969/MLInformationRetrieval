Symplectic frame bundle

In symplectic geometry, the symplectic frame bundle1 of a given symplectic manifold

 
  is the canonical principal 
 
 
 
 -subbundle

 
  of the tangent frame bundle

 
  consisting of linear frames which are symplectic with respect to 
 
 
 
 . In other words, an element of the symplectic frame bundle is a linear frame 
 
 
 
  at point 
 
 
 
  i.e. an ordered basis 
 
 
 
  of tangent vectors at 
 
 
 
  of the tangent vector space 
 
 
 
 , satisfying


 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
 , each fiber 
 
 
 
  of the principal 
 
 
 
 -bundle 
 
 
 
  is the set of all symplectic bases of 
 
 
 
 .
The symplectic frame bundle

 
 , a subbundle of the tangent frame bundle 
 
 
 
 , is an example of reductive G-structure on the manifold 
 
 
 
 .
