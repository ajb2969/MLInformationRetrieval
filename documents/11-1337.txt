Nicotinate glucosyltransferase




Nicotinate glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a nicotinate glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + nicotinate 
 
 
 
  UDP + N-glucosylnicotinate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and nicotinate, whereas its two products are UDP and N-glucosylnicotinate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:nicotinate N-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-nicotinate N-glucosyltransferase, and UDP-glucose:nicotinic acid-N-glucosyltransferase.
