It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schläfli symbol {3,3,6}. It has six tetrahedra {3,3} around each edge. All vertices are ideal vertices with infinitely many tetrahedra existing around each ideal vertex in an triangular tiling vertex arrangement.1 
Symmetry constructions
 It has a second construction as a uniform honeycomb, Schläfli symbol {3,3[3]}, with alternating types or colors of tetrahedral cells. In Coxeter notation the half symmetry is [3,3,6,1+] ↔ [3,((3,3,3))] or [3,3[3]]:  ↔ .
