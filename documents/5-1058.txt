   Fractional Brownian motion      Fractional Brownian motion   In probability theory , fractional Brownian motion (fBm) , also called a fractal Brownian motion , is a generalization of Brownian motion . Unlike classical Brownian motion, the increments of fBm need not be independent. fBm is a continuous-time  Gaussian process  B H ( t ) on [0, T ], which starts at zero, has expectation zero for all t in [0, T ], and has the following covariance function :        E   [    B  H    (  t  )    B  H    (  s  )    ]    =     1  2     (      |  t  |    2  H    +    |  s  |    2  H     -    |   t  -  s   |    2  H     )     ,        E   delimited-[]     subscript  B  H   t   subscript  B  H   s         1  2        superscript    t     2  H     superscript    s     2  H      superscript      t  s      2  H        E[B_{H}(t)B_{H}(s)]=\tfrac{1}{2}(|t|^{2H}+|s|^{2H}-|t-s|^{2H}),     where H is a real number in (0, 1), called the Hurst index or Hurst parameter associated with the fractional Brownian motion. The Hurst exponent describes the raggedness of the resultant motion, with a higher value leading to a smoother motion. It was introduced by .  The value of H determines what kind of process the fBm is:   if H = 1/2 then the process is in fact a Brownian motion or Wiener process ;  if H > 1/2 then the increments of the process are positively correlated ;  if H < 1/2 then the increments of the process are negatively correlated.   The increment process, X ( t ) = B H ( t +1) − B H ( t ), is known as fractional Gaussian noise .  There is also a generalization of fractional Brownian motion: n -th order fractional Brownian motion , abbreviated as n-fBm. 1 n-fBm is a Gaussian , self-similar, non-stationary process whose increments of order n are stationary. For n = 1, n-fBm is classical fBm.  Like the Brownian motion that it generalizes, fractional Brownian motion is named after 19th century biologist Robert Brown ; fractional Gaussian noise is named after mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss .  Background and definition  Prior to the introduction of the fractional Brownian motion,  used the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral to define the process        X  H    (  t  )    =    1   Γ   (   H  +   1  /  2    )       ∫  0  t       (   t  -  s   )    H  -   1  /  2      d  B   (  s  )             superscript  X  H   t       1    normal-Γ    H    1  2        superscript   subscript   0   t      superscript    t  s     H    1  2     d  B  s       X^{H}(t)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(H+1/2)}\int_{0}^{t}(t-s)^{H-1/2}\,dB(s)   where integration is with respect to the white noise measure dB ( s ). This integral turns out to be ill-suited to applications of fractional Brownian motion because of its over-emphasis of the origin .  The idea instead is to use a different fractional integral of white noise to define the process: the Weyl integral        B  H    (  t  )    =     B  H    (  0  )    +    1   Γ   (   H  +   1  /  2    )      {     ∫   -  ∞   0     [     (   t  -  s   )    H  -   1  /  2     -    (   -  s   )    H  -   1  /  2      ]   d  B   (  s  )     +    ∫  0  t       (   t  -  s   )    H  -   1  /  2      d  B   (  s  )      }            subscript  B  H   t        subscript  B  H   0       1    normal-Γ    H    1  2           superscript   subscript        0      delimited-[]     superscript    t  s     H    1  2      superscript    s     H    1  2       d  B  s      superscript   subscript   0   t      superscript    t  s     H    1  2     d  B  s          B_{H}(t)=B_{H}(0)+\frac{1}{\Gamma(H+1/2)}\left\{\int_{-\infty}^{0}\left[(t-s)^%
 {H-1/2}-(-s)^{H-1/2}\right]\,dB(s)+\int_{0}^{t}(t-s)^{H-1/2}\,dB(s)\right\}   for t > 0 (and similarly for t 1/2.)  Properties  Self-similarity  The process is self-similar , since in terms of probability distributions :         B  H    (   a  t   )    ∼     |  a  |   H    B  H    (  t  )     .     similar-to     subscript  B  H     a  t       superscript    a   H    subscript  B  H   t     B_{H}(at)\sim|a|^{H}B_{H}(t).     This property is due to the fact that the covariance function is homogeneous of order 2H and can be considered as a fractal property. Fractional Brownian motion is the only self-similar Gaussian process .  Stationary increments  It has stationary increments:          B  H    (  t  )    -    B  H    (  s  )     ∼    B  H    (   t  -  s   )     .     similar-to       subscript  B  H   t      subscript  B  H   s       subscript  B  H     t  s      B_{H}(t)-B_{H}(s)\;\sim\;B_{H}(t-s).     Long-range dependence  For H > ½ the process exhibits long-range dependence ,         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    E   [    B  H    (  1  )    (     B  H    (   n  +  1   )    -    B  H    (  n  )     )    ]     =  ∞   .        superscript   subscript     n  1        E   delimited-[]     subscript  B  H   1       subscript  B  H     n  1       subscript  B  H   n           \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}E[B_{H}(1)(B_{H}(n+1)-B_{H}(n))]=\infty.     Regularity  Sample-paths are almost  nowhere differentiable . However, almost-all trajectories are Hölder continuous of any order strictly less than H : for each such trajectory, there exists a constant c such that         |     B  H    (  t  )    -    B  H    (  s  )     |   ≤   c    |   t  -  s   |    H  -  ε                subscript  B  H   t      subscript  B  H   s       c   superscript      t  s      H  ε       |B_{H}(t)-B_{H}(s)|\leq c|t-s|^{H-\varepsilon}        for every ε > 0.  Dimension  With probability 1, the graph of B H ( t ) has both Hausdorff dimension and box dimension of 2− H .  Integration  As for regular Brownian motion, one can define stochastic integrals with respect to fractional Brownian motion, usually called "fractional stochastic integrals". In general though, unlike integrals with respect to regular Brownian motion, fractional stochastic integrals are not semimartingales .  Sample paths  Practical computer realisations of an fBm can be generated, although they are only a finite approximation. The sample paths chosen can be thought of as showing discrete sampled points on an fBm process. Three realisations are shown below, each with 1000 points of an fBm with Hurst parameter 0.75.     (Figure)  "H" = 0.75 realisation 1   (Figure)  "H" = 0.75 realisation 2   (Figure)  "H" = 0.75 realisation 3      Two realisations are shown below, each showing 1000 points of an fBm , the first with Hurst parameter 0.95 and the second with Hurst parameter 0.55.     (Figure)  "H" = 0.95   (Figure)  "H" = 0.55      Method 1 of simulation  One can simulate sample-paths of an fBm using methods for generating stationary Gaussian processes with known covariance function. The simplest method relies on the Cholesky decomposition method of the covariance matrix (explained below), which on a grid of size   n   n   n   has complexity of order    O   (   n  3   )       O   superscript  n  3     O(n^{3})   . A more complex, but computationally faster method is the circulant embedding method of .  Suppose we want to simulate the values of the fBM at times     t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n       subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n     t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}   using the Cholesky decomposition method .   Form the matrix    Γ  =   (  R   (   t  i   ,   t  j   )   ,  i  ,  j  =  1  ,  …  ,  n  )      fragments  Γ    fragments  normal-(  R   fragments  normal-(   subscript  t  i   normal-,   subscript  t  j   normal-)   normal-,  i  normal-,  j   1  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  n  normal-)     \Gamma=\bigl(R(t_{i},\,t_{j}),i,j=1,\ldots,\,n\bigr)   where      R    (  t  ,  s  )    =    (     s   2  H    +   t   2  H     -    |   t  -  s   |    2  H     )   /  2         R   t  s           superscript  s    2  H     superscript  t    2  H      superscript      t  s      2  H     2     \,R(t,s)=(s^{2H}+t^{2H}-|t-s|^{2H})/2   .    Compute    Σ    normal-Σ   \,\Sigma   the square root matrix of    Γ    normal-Γ   \,\Gamma   , i.e.      Σ   2   =  Γ       superscript  normal-Σ  2   normal-Γ    \,\Sigma^{2}=\Gamma   . Loosely speaking,    Σ    normal-Σ   \,\Sigma   is the "standard deviation" matrix associated to the variance-covariance matrix    Γ    normal-Γ   \,\Gamma   .    Construct a vector    v    v   \,v   of n numbers drawn according a standard Gaussian distribution,    If we define     u   =   Σ  v       u    normal-Σ  v     \,u=\Sigma v   then    u    u   \,u   yields a sample path of an fBm .   In order to compute    Σ    normal-Σ   \,\Sigma   , we can use for instance the Cholesky decomposition method . An alternative method uses the eigenvalues of    Γ    normal-Γ   \,\Gamma   :   Since    Γ    normal-Γ   \,\Gamma   is symmetric , positive-definite matrix, it follows that all eigenvalues      λ   i     subscript  λ  i    \,\lambda_{i}   of    Γ    normal-Γ   \,\Gamma   satisfy      λ   i   ≥  0       subscript  λ  i   0    \,\lambda_{i}\geq 0   , (    i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       i   1  normal-…  n     i=1,\dots,n   ).    Let    Λ    normal-Λ   \,\Lambda   be the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, i.e.     Λ   i  j    =     λ  i     δ   i  j          subscript  normal-Λ    i  j       subscript  λ  i    subscript  δ    i  j       \Lambda_{ij}=\lambda_{i}\,\delta_{ij}   where    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   is the Kronecker delta . We define    Λ   1  /  2      superscript  normal-Λ    1  2     \Lambda^{1/2}   as the diagonal matrix with entries    λ  i   1  /  2      superscript   subscript  λ  i     1  2     \lambda_{i}^{1/2}   , i.e.     Λ   i  j    1  /  2    =     λ  i   1  /  2      δ   i  j          superscript   subscript  normal-Λ    i  j      1  2       superscript   subscript  λ  i     1  2     subscript  δ    i  j       \Lambda_{ij}^{1/2}=\lambda_{i}^{1/2}\,\delta_{ij}   .   Note that the result is real-valued because     λ  i   ≥  0       subscript  λ  i   0    \lambda_{i}\geq 0   .   Let     v   i     subscript  v  i    \,v_{i}   an eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue     λ   i     subscript  λ  i    \,\lambda_{i}   . Define    P    P   \,P   as the matrix whose   i   i   i   -th column is the eigenvector     v   i     subscript  v  i    \,v_{i}   .   Note that since the eigenvectors are linearly independent, the matrix    P    P   \,P   is inversible.   It follows then that    Σ  =    P     Λ   1  /  2      P   -  1         normal-Σ    P   superscript  normal-Λ    1  2     superscript  P    1       \Sigma=P\,\Lambda^{1/2}\,P^{-1}   because    Γ  =    P    Λ    P   -  1         normal-Γ    P  normal-Λ   superscript  P    1       \Gamma=P\,\Lambda\,P^{-1}   .   Method 2 of simulation  It is also known that        B  H    (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t     K  H    (  t  ,  s  )   d  B   (  s  )            subscript  B  H   t     superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  K  H    t  s   d  B  s      B_{H}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}K_{H}(t,s)\,dB(s)     where B is a standard Brownian motion and         K  H    (  t  ,  s  )    =        (   t  -  s   )    H  -   1  2      Γ   (   H  +   1  2    )      2    F  1    (   H  -   1  2    ;    1  2   -  H   ;   H  +   1  2    ;   1  -   t  s    )     .         subscript  K  H    t  s       subscript     superscript    t  s     H    1  2       normal-Γ    H    1  2      2    subscript  F  1      H    1  2        1  2   H     H    1  2      1    t  s        K_{H}(t,s)=\frac{(t-s)^{H-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Gamma(H+\frac{1}{2})}\;_{2}F_{1}\left%
 (H-\frac{1}{2};\,\frac{1}{2}-H;\;H+\frac{1}{2};\,1-\frac{t}{s}\right).     Where    F  1    2      subscript   subscript  F  1   2    {}_{2}F_{1}   is the Euler hypergeometric integral .  Say we want simulate an fBm at points    0  =   t  0   <   t  1   <  ⋯  <   t  n   =  T        0   subscript  t  0         subscript  t  1        normal-⋯        subscript  t  n        T     0=t_{0}   .   Construct a vector of n numbers drawn according a standard Gaussian distribution.    Multiply it component-wise by √( T / n ) to obtain the increments of a Brownian motion on [0, T ]. Denote this vector by    (   δ   B  1    ,  …  ,   δ   B  n    )       δ   subscript  B  1    normal-…    δ   subscript  B  n      (\delta B_{1},\ldots,\delta B_{n})   .    For each    t  j     subscript  t  j    t_{j}   , compute            B  H    (   t  j   )    =    n  T     ∑   i  =  0    j  -  1      ∫   t  i    t   i  +  1       K  H    (   t  j   ,  s  )   d   s   δ   B  i        .         subscript  B  H    subscript  t  j        n  T     superscript   subscript     i  0      j  1      superscript   subscript    subscript  t  i     subscript  t    i  1        subscript  K  H     subscript  t  j   s   d  s  δ   subscript  B  i         B_{H}(t_{j})=\frac{n}{T}\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}}K_{H}(t_{j},\,s)%
