   Chitin deacetylase      Chitin deacetylase   In enzymology , a chitin deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   chitin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   chitosan + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chitin and H 2 O , whereas its two products are chitosan and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chitin amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
