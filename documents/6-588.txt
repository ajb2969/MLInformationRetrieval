   Normal bundle      Normal bundle   In differential geometry , a field of mathematics , a normal bundle is a particular kind of vector bundle , complementary to the tangent bundle , and coming from an embedding (or immersion ).  Definition  Riemannian manifold  Let    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   be a Riemannian manifold , and    S  ‚äÇ  M      S  M    S\subset M   a Riemannian submanifold . Define, for a given    p  ‚àà  S      p  S    p\in S   , a vector    n  ‚àà    T  p   M       n     subscript  normal-T  p   M     n\in\mathrm{T}_{p}M   to be normal to   S   S   S   whenever     g   (  n  ,  v  )    =  0        g   n  v    0    g(n,v)=0   for all    v  ‚àà    T  p   S       v     subscript  normal-T  p   S     v\in\mathrm{T}_{p}S   (so that   n   n   n   is orthogonal to     T  p   S       subscript  normal-T  p   S    \mathrm{T}_{p}S   ). The set     N  p   S       subscript  normal-N  p   S    \mathrm{N}_{p}S   of all such   n   n   n   is then called the normal space to   S   S   S   at   p   p   p   .  Just as the total space of the tangent bundle to a manifold is constructed from all tangent spaces to the manifold, the total space of the normal bundle     N  S      normal-N  S    \mathrm{N}S   to   S   S   S   is defined as       N  S   :=    ‚àê   p  ‚àà  S      N  p   S       assign    normal-N  S     subscript  coproduct    p  S       subscript  normal-N  p   S      \mathrm{N}S:=\coprod_{p\in S}\mathrm{N}_{p}S   .  The conormal bundle is defined as the dual bundle to the normal bundle. It can be realised naturally as a sub-bundle of the cotangent bundle .  General definition  More abstractly, given an immersion     i  :   N  ‚Üí  M      normal-:  i   normal-‚Üí  N  M     i\colon N\to M   (for instance an embedding), one can define a normal bundle of N in M , by at each point of N , taking the quotient space of the tangent space on M by the tangent space on N . For a Riemannian manifold one can identify this quotient with the orthogonal complement, but in general one cannot (such a choice is equivalent to a section of the projection    V  ‚Üí   V  /  W      normal-‚Üí  V    V  W     V\to V/W   ).  Thus the normal bundle is in general a quotient of the tangent bundle of the ambient space restricted to the subspace.  Formally, the normal bundle to N in M is a quotient bundle of the tangent bundle on M : one has the short exact sequence of vector bundles on N :      0  ‚Üí   T  N   ‚Üí     T  M   |    i   (  N  )     ‚Üí   T   M  /  N    :=       T  M   |    i   (  N  )     /  T   N   ‚Üí  0       normal-‚Üí  0    T  N     normal-‚Üí     evaluated-at    T  M     i  N      normal-‚Üí     subscript  T    M  N      assign         evaluated-at    T  M     i  N    T   N     normal-‚Üí    0     0\to TN\to TM|_{i(N)}\to T_{M/N}:=TM|_{i(N)}/TN\to 0     where      T  M   |    i   (  N  )       evaluated-at    T  M     i  N     TM|_{i(N)}   is the restriction of the tangent bundle on M to N (properly, the pullback     i  *   T  M       superscript  i    T  M    i^{*}TM   of the tangent bundle on M to a vector bundle on N via the map   i   i   i   ).  The normal bundle itself forms an N-dimensional manifold differentiably embedded in    ùêë   2  N      superscript  ùêë    2  N     \mathbf{R}^{2N}   if the manifold itself is of dimension 2N.  Stable normal bundle  Abstract  manifolds have a canonical tangent bundle, but do not have a normal bundle: only an embedding (or immersion) of a manifold in another yields a normal bundle. However, since every compact manifold can be embedded in    ùêë  N     superscript  ùêë  N    \mathbf{R}^{N}   , by the Whitney embedding theorem , every manifold admits a normal bundle, given such an embedding.  There is in general no natural choice of embedding, but for a given M , any two embeddings in    ùêë  N     superscript  ùêë  N    \mathbf{R}^{N}   for sufficiently large N are regular homotopic , and hence induce the same normal bundle. The resulting class of normal bundles (it is a class of bundles and not a specific bundle because N could vary) is called the stable normal bundle .  Dual to tangent bundle  The normal bundle is dual to the tangent bundle in the sense of K-theory : by the above short exact sequence,        [   T  N   ]   +   [   T   M  /  N    ]    =   [   T  M   ]          delimited-[]    T  N     delimited-[]   subscript  T    M  N       delimited-[]    T  M      [TN]+[T_{M/N}]=[TM]   in the Grothendieck group . In case of an immersion in    ùêë  N     superscript  ùêë  N    \mathbf{R}^{N}   , the tangent bundle of the ambient space is trivial (since    ùêë  N     superscript  ùêë  N    \mathbf{R}^{N}   is contractible, hence parallelizable ), so      [   T  N   ]   +   [   T   M  /  N    ]    =  0         delimited-[]    T  N     delimited-[]   subscript  T    M  N      0    [TN]+[T_{M/N}]=0   , and thus     [   T   M  /  N    ]   =   -   [   T  N   ]         delimited-[]   subscript  T    M  N        delimited-[]    T  N       [T_{M/N}]=-[TN]   .  This is useful in the computation of characteristic classes , and allows one to prove lower bounds on immersibility and embeddability of manifolds in Euclidean space .  For symplectic manifolds  Suppose a manifold   X   X   X   is embedded in to a symplectic manifold     (  M  ,  œâ  )     M  œâ    (M,\omega)   , such that the pullback of the symplectic form has constant rank on   X   X   X   . Then one can define the symplectic normal bundle to X as the vector bundle over X with fibres           (    T   i   (  x  )     X   )   œâ   /   (     T   i   (  x  )     X   ‚à©    (    T   i   (  x  )     X   )   œâ    )    ,  x   ‚àà  X   ,          superscript     subscript  T    i  x    X   œâ        subscript  T    i  x    X    superscript     subscript  T    i  x    X   œâ     x   X    (T_{i(x)}X)^{\omega}/(T_{i(x)}X\cap(T_{i(x)}X)^{\omega}),\quad x\in X,   where    i  :   X  ‚Üí  M      normal-:  i   normal-‚Üí  X  M     i:X\rightarrow M   denotes the embedding. Notice that the constant rank condition ensures that these normal spaces fit together to form a bundle. Furthermore, any fibre inherits the structure of a symplectic vector space.  By Darboux's theorem , the constant rank embedding is locally determined by    i  *   (   T  M   )       i    T  M     i*(TM)   . The isomorphism          i  *    (   T  M   )    ‚âÖ     T  X   /  ŒΩ   ‚äï     (   T  X   )   œâ   /  ŒΩ   ‚äï   (   ŒΩ  ‚äï   ŒΩ  *    )     ,   ŒΩ  =    T  X   ‚à©    (   T  X   )   œâ      ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  i      T  M     direct-sum      T  X   ŒΩ      superscript    T  X   œâ   ŒΩ    direct-sum  ŒΩ   superscript  ŒΩ         ŒΩ      T  X    superscript    T  X   œâ       i^{*}(TM)\cong TX/\nu\oplus(TX)^{\omega}/\nu\oplus(\nu\oplus\nu^{*}),\quad\nu=%
 TX\cap(TX)^{\omega},   of symplectic vector bundles over   X   X   X   implies that the symplectic normal bundle already determines the constant rank embedding locally. This feature is similar to the Riemannian case.  Algebraic geometry  In algebraic geometry , the normal bundle N X Y of a regular embedding i: X ‚Üí Y , defined by some sheaf of ideals I is the vector bundle on X corresponding to the dual of the sheaf I / I 2 . The regularity of the embedding ensures that this sheaf is locally free and agrees with the normal cone C X Y , which is defined as     S  p  e  c    ‚äï   n  ‚â•  0      I  n   /   I   n  +  1         subscript  direct-sum    n  0      S  p  e  c      superscript  I  n    superscript  I    n  1       Spec\oplus_{n\geq 0}I^{n}/I^{n+1}   . 1  References    "  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Differential geometry  Category:Differential topology  Category:Vector bundles     , section B.7 ‚Ü©
