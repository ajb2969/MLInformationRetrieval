   Gravitational instanton      Gravitational instanton   In mathematical physics and differential geometry , a gravitational instanton is a four-dimensional complete  Riemannian manifold satisfying the vacuum  Einstein equations . They are so named because they are analogues in quantum theories of gravity of instantons in Yang–Mills theory . In accordance with this analogy with self-dual Yang–Mills instantons , gravitational instantons are usually assumed to look like four dimensional Euclidean space at large distances, and to have a self-dual Riemann tensor . Mathematically, this means that they are asymptotically locally Euclidean (or perhaps asymptotically locally flat) hyperkähler 4-manifolds , and in this sense, they are special examples of Einstein manifolds . From a physical point of view, a gravitational instanton is a non-singular solution of the vacuum Einstein equations with positive-definite , as opposed to Lorentzian , metric.  There are many possible generalizations of the original conception of a gravitational instanton: for example one can allow gravitational instantons to have a nonzero cosmological constant or a Riemann tensor which is not self-dual. One can also relax the boundary condition that the metric is asymptotically Euclidean.  There are many methods for constructing gravitational instantons, including the Gibbons–Hawking Ansatz , twistor theory , and the hyperkähler quotient construction.  Properties   A four-dimensional Kähler – Einstein manifold has a self-dual Riemann tensor .  Equivalently, a self-dual gravitational instanton is a four-dimensional complete hyperkähler manifold .  Gravitational instantons are analogous to self-dual Yang–Mills instantons .   Taxonomy  By specifying the 'boundary conditions', i.e. the asymptotics of the metric 'at infinity' on a noncompact Riemannian manifold, gravitational instantons are divided into a few classes, such as asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces (ALE spaces), asymptotically locally flat spaces (ALF spaces). There also exist ALG spaces whose name is chosen by induction.  Examples  It will be convenient to write the gravitational instanton solutions below using left-invariant 1-forms on the three-sphere  S 3 (viewed as the group Sp(1) or SU(2)). These can be defined in terms of Euler angles by       σ  1   =    sin    ψ   d  θ    -    cos  ψ    sin    θ   d  ϕ           subscript  σ  1         ψ  d  θ        ψ       θ  d  ϕ        \sigma_{1}=\sin\psi\,d\theta-\cos\psi\sin\theta\,d\phi          σ  2   =    cos    ψ   d  θ    +    sin  ψ    sin    θ   d  ϕ           subscript  σ  2         ψ  d  θ        ψ       θ  d  ϕ        \sigma_{2}=\cos\psi\,d\theta+\sin\psi\sin\theta\,d\phi           σ  3   =    d  ψ   +   cos    θ   d  ϕ      .       subscript  σ  3       d  ψ       θ  d  ϕ       \sigma_{3}=d\psi+\cos\theta\,d\phi.

Its metric is given by        d   s  2    =      (   1  -   a   r  4     )    -  1    d   r  2    +     r  2   4    (   1  -   a   r  4     )    σ  3    2    +     r  2   4    (    σ  1  2   +   σ  2  2    )      .        d   superscript  s  2         superscript    1    a   superscript  r  4       1    d   superscript  r  2         superscript  r  2   4     1    a   superscript  r  4      superscript   subscript  σ  3   2         superscript  r  2   4      superscript   subscript  σ  1   2    superscript   subscript  σ  2   2        ds^{2}=\left(1-\frac{a}{r^{4}}\right)^{-1}dr^{2}+\frac{r^{2}}{4}\left(1-\frac{%
 a}{r^{4}}\right){\sigma_{3}}^{2}+\frac{r^{2}}{4}(\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}).     where    r  ≥   a   1  /  4        r   superscript  a    1  4      r\geq a^{1/4}   . This metric is smooth everywhere if it has no conical singularity at    r  →   a   1  /  4       normal-→  r   superscript  a    1  4      r\rightarrow a^{1/4}   ,    θ  =   0  ,  π       θ   0  π     \theta=0,\pi   . For    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   this happens if   ψ   ψ   \psi   has a period of    4  π      4  π    4\pi   , which gives a flat metric on R 4 ; However for    a  ≠  0      a  0    a\neq 0   this happens if   ψ   ψ   \psi   has a period of    2  π      2  π    2\pi   .  Asymptotically (i.e., in the limit    r  →  ∞     normal-→  r     r\rightarrow\infty   ) the metric looks like       d   s  2    =    d   r  2    +     r  2   4    σ  3  2    +     r  2   4    (    σ  1  2   +   σ  2  2    )           d   superscript  s  2        d   superscript  r  2         superscript  r  2   4    superscript   subscript  σ  3   2         superscript  r  2   4      superscript   subscript  σ  1   2    superscript   subscript  σ  2   2        ds^{2}=dr^{2}+\frac{r^{2}}{4}\sigma_{3}^{2}+\frac{r^{2}}{4}(\sigma_{1}^{2}+%
 \sigma_{2}^{2})   which naively seems as the flat metric on R 4 . However, for    a  ≠  0      a  0    a\neq 0   ,   ψ   ψ   \psi   has only half the usual periodicity, as we have seen. Thus the metric is asymptotically R 4 with the identification     ψ   ∼   ψ  +   2  π       similar-to  ψ    ψ    2  π      \psi\,{\sim}\,\psi+2\pi   , which is a Z 2  subgroup of SO(4) , the rotation group of R 4 . Therefore the metric is said to be asymptotically R 4 / Z 2 .  There is a transformation to another coordinate system , in which the metric looks like        d   s  2    =     1   V   (  𝐱  )       (    d  ψ   +    𝝎  ⋅  d   𝐱    )   2    +     V   (  𝐱  )   d  𝐱   ⋅  d   𝐱     ,        d   superscript  s  2          1    V  𝐱     superscript      d  ψ      normal-⋅  𝝎  d   𝐱    2       normal-⋅    V  𝐱  d  𝐱   d   𝐱      ds^{2}=\frac{1}{V(\mathbf{x})}(d\psi+\boldsymbol{\omega}\cdot d\mathbf{x})^{2}%
 +V(\mathbf{x})d\mathbf{x}\cdot d\mathbf{x},   where       ∇  V   =   ±   ∇  ×  𝝎     ,   V  =    ∑   i  =  1   2    1   |   𝐱  -   𝐱  i    |       .     formulae-sequence     normal-∇  V    plus-or-minus    normal-∇  𝝎       V    superscript   subscript     i  1    2     1      𝐱   subscript  𝐱  i          \nabla V=\pm\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\omega},\quad V=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{1}{|%
 \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}|}.      (For a = 0,    V  =   1   |  𝐱  |        V    1    𝐱      V=\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|}   , and the new coordinates are defined as follows: one first defines    ρ  =    r  2   /  4       ρ     superscript  r  2   4     \rho=r^{2}/4   and then parametrizes   ρ   ρ   \rho   ,   θ   θ   \theta   and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   by the R 3 coordinates   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   , i.e.    𝐱  =   (   ρ   sin  θ    cos  ϕ    ,   ρ   sin  θ    sin  ϕ    ,   ρ   cos  θ    )       𝐱     ρ    θ     ϕ      ρ    θ     ϕ      ρ    θ       \mathbf{x}=(\rho\sin\theta\cos\phi,\rho\sin\theta\sin\phi,\rho\cos\theta)   ).   In the new coordinates,   ψ   ψ   \psi   has the usual periodicity      ψ   ∼   ψ  +   4  π     .     similar-to  ψ    ψ    4  π      \psi\ {\sim}\ \psi+4\pi.     One may replace V by        V   =    ∑   i  =  1   n    1   |   𝐱  -   𝐱  i    |      .      V    superscript   subscript     i  1    n     1      𝐱   subscript  𝐱  i         \quad V=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}_{i}|}.   For some n points    𝐱  i     subscript  𝐱  i    \mathbf{x}_{i}   , i = 1, 2..., n . This gives a multi-center Eguchi–Hanson gravitational instanton, which is again smooth everywhere if the angular coordinates have the usual periodicities (to avoid conical singularities ). The asymptotic limit (    r  →  ∞     normal-→  r     r\rightarrow\infty   ) is equivalent to taking all    𝐱  i     subscript  𝐱  i    \mathbf{x}_{i}   to zero, and by changing coordinates back to r,   θ   θ   \theta   and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , and redefining    r  →   r  /   n       normal-→  r    r    n      r\rightarrow r/\sqrt{n}   , we get the asymptotic metric        d   s  2    =    d   r  2    +     r  2   4     (     d  ψ   n   +   cos    θ   d  ϕ     )   2    +     r  2   4    [     (   σ  1  L   )   2   +    (   σ  2  L   )   2    ]      .        d   superscript  s  2        d   superscript  r  2         superscript  r  2   4    superscript        d  ψ   n       θ  d  ϕ     2         superscript  r  2   4    delimited-[]     superscript   superscript   subscript  σ  1   L   2    superscript   superscript   subscript  σ  2   L   2         ds^{2}=dr^{2}+\frac{r^{2}}{4}\left({d\psi\over n}+\cos\theta\,d\phi\right)^{2}%
 +\frac{r^{2}}{4}[(\sigma_{1}^{L})^{2}+(\sigma_{2}^{L})^{2}].     This is R 4 / Z n = C 2 / Z n , because it is R 4 with the angular coordinate   ψ   ψ   \psi   replaced by    ψ  /  n      ψ  n    \psi/n   , which has the wrong periodicity (     4  π   /  n        4  π   n    4\pi/n   instead of    4  π      4  π    4\pi   ). In other words, it is R 4 identified under     ψ   ∼   ψ  +    4  π  k   /  n       similar-to  ψ    ψ      4  π  k   n      \psi\ {\sim}\ \psi+4\pi k/n   , or, equivalnetly, C 2 identified under z i ~    e    2  π  i  k   /  n      superscript  e      2  π  i  k   n     e^{2\pi ik/n}    z i for i = 1, 2.  To conclude, the multi-center Eguchi–Hanson geometry is a Kähler Ricci flat geometry which is asymptotically C 2 / Z n . According to Yau's theorem this is the only geometry satisfying these properties. Therefore this is also the geometry of a C 2 / Z n  orbifold in string theory after its conical singularity has been smoothed away by its "blow up" (i.e., deformation) 1 .
