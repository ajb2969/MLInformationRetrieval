   Quasi-Hopf algebra      Quasi-Hopf algebra   A quasi-Hopf algebra is a generalization of a Hopf algebra , which was defined by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Drinfeld in 1989.  A quasi-Hopf algebra is a quasi-bialgebra      ℬ  𝒜   =   (  𝒜  ,  Δ  ,  ε  ,  Φ  )        subscript  ℬ  𝒜    𝒜  normal-Δ  ε  normal-Φ     \mathcal{B_{A}}=(\mathcal{A},\Delta,\varepsilon,\Phi)   for which there exist     α  ,  β   ∈  𝒜       α  β   𝒜    \alpha,\beta\in\mathcal{A}   and a bijective  antihomomorphism  S ( antipode ) of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   such that        ∑  i    S   (   b  i   )   α   c  i     =   ε   (  a  )   α         subscript   i     S   subscript  b  i   α   subscript  c  i       ε  a  α     \sum_{i}S(b_{i})\alpha c_{i}=\varepsilon(a)\alpha           ∑  i     b  i   β  S   (   c  i   )     =   ε   (  a  )   β         subscript   i      subscript  b  i   β  S   subscript  c  i       ε  a  β     \sum_{i}b_{i}\beta S(c_{i})=\varepsilon(a)\beta     for all    a  ∈  𝒜      a  𝒜    a\in\mathcal{A}   and where       Δ   (  a  )    =    ∑  i     b  i   ⊗   c  i           normal-Δ  a     subscript   i    tensor-product   subscript  b  i    subscript  c  i       \Delta(a)=\sum_{i}b_{i}\otimes c_{i}     and         ∑  i     X  i   β  S   (   Y  i   )   α   Z  i     =  𝕀   ,        subscript   i      subscript  X  i   β  S   subscript  Y  i   α   subscript  Z  i     𝕀    \sum_{i}X_{i}\beta S(Y_{i})\alpha Z_{i}=\mathbb{I},            ∑  j    S   (   P  j   )   α   Q  j   β  S   (   R  j   )     =  𝕀   .        subscript   j     S   subscript  P  j   α   subscript  Q  j   β  S   subscript  R  j     𝕀    \sum_{j}S(P_{j})\alpha Q_{j}\beta S(R_{j})=\mathbb{I}.     where the expansions for the quantities   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   and    Φ   -  1      superscript  normal-Φ    1     \Phi^{-1}   are given by      Φ  =    ∑  i     X  i   ⊗   Y  i   ⊗   Z  i         normal-Φ    subscript   i    tensor-product   subscript  X  i    subscript  Y  i    subscript  Z  i       \Phi=\sum_{i}X_{i}\otimes Y_{i}\otimes Z_{i}   and        Φ   -  1    =    ∑  j     P  j   ⊗   Q  j   ⊗   R  j      .       superscript  normal-Φ    1      subscript   j    tensor-product   subscript  P  j    subscript  Q  j    subscript  R  j       \Phi^{-1}=\sum_{j}P_{j}\otimes Q_{j}\otimes R_{j}.     As for a quasi-bialgebra , the property of being quasi-Hopf is preserved under twisting .  Usage  Quasi-Hopf algebras form the basis of the study of Drinfeld twists and the representations in terms of F-matrices associated with finite-dimensional irreducible representations of quantum affine algebra . F-matrices can be used to factorize the corresponding R-matrix . This leads to applications in Statistical mechanics , as quantum affine algebras, and their representations give rise to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation , a solvability condition for various statistical models, allowing characteristics of the model to be deduced from its corresponding quantum affine algebra . The study of F-matrices has been applied to models such as the Heisenberg XXZ model in the framework of the algebraic Bethe ansatz . It provides a framework for solving two-dimensional integrable models by using the Quantum inverse scattering method .
