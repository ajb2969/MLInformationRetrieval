   3-methylquercetin 7-O-methyltransferase      3-methylquercetin 7-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a 3-methylquercetin 7-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone (isorhamnetin), whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (rhamnazin).  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone 7-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include flavonol 7-O-methyltransferase , flavonol 7-methyltransferase , 7-OMT , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3-methoxyflavone , 7-O-methyltransferase , and 3-methylquercitin 7-O-methyltransferase [mis-spelt] .  The enzyme can be found in Chrysosplenium americanum (American Golden Saxifrage).  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
