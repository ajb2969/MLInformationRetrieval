Contour set

In mathematics, contour sets generalize and formalize the everyday notions of

everything superior to something
everything superior or equivalent to something
everything inferior to something
everything inferior or equivalent to something.

Formal definitions
Given a relation on pairs of elements of set




 
  and an element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 




The upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  is the set of all 
 
 
 
  that are related to 
 
 
 
 :



The lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  is the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is related to them:



The strict upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  is the set of all 
 
 
 
  that are related to 
 
 
 
  without 
 
 
 
  being in this way related to any of them:



The strict lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  is the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is related to them without any of them being in this way related to 
 
 
 
 :



The formal expressions of the last two may be simplified if we have defined


 
  so that 
 
 
 
  is related to 
 
 
 
  but 
 
 
 
  is not related to 
 
 
 
 , in which case the strict upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  is



and the strict lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  is



Contour sets of a function
In the case of a function

 
  considered in terms of relation 
 
 
 
 , reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the implied relation



Examples
Arithmetic
Consider a real number

 
 , and the relation 

. Then

the upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of numbers that were greater than or equal to 
 
 
 
 ,
the strict upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of numbers that were greater than 
 
 
 
 ,
the lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of numbers that were less than or equal to 
 
 
 
 , and
the strict lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of numbers that were less than 
 
 
 
 .

Consider, more generally, the relation


 
  Then

the upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ,
the strict upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ,
the lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and
the strict lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

It would be technically possible to define contour sets in terms of the relation


 
  though such definitions would tend to confound ready understanding.
In the case of a real-valued function 
 
 
 
  (whose arguments might or might not be themselves real numbers), reference to the contour sets of the function is implicitly to the contour sets of the relation


 
  Note that the arguments to 
 
 
 
  might be vectors, and that the notation used might instead be



Economic
In economics, the set 
 
 
 
  could be interpreted as a set of goods and services or of possible outcomes, the relation 
 
 
 
  as strict preference, and the relationship 
 
 
 
  as weak preference. Then

the upper contour set, or better set,1 of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were at least as desired as 
 
 
 
 ,
the strict upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were more desired than 
 
 
 
 ,
the lower contour set, or worse set,2 of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were no more desired than 
 
 
 
 , and
the strict lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all goods, services, or outcomes that were less desired than 
 
 
 
 .

Such preferences might be captured by a utility function 
 
 
 
 , in which case

the upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ,
the strict upper contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ,
the lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and
the strict lower contour set of 
 
 
 
  would be the set of all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

Complementarity
On the assumption that 
 
 
 
  is a total ordering of 
 
 
 
 , the complement of the upper contour set is the strict lower contour set.






and the complement of the strict upper contour set is the lower contour set.
