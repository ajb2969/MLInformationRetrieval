Damping ratio

[[File:Damped spring.gif|right|frame|Underdamped spring–mass system with ζ that characterizes the frequency response of a second order ordinary differential equation. It is particularly important in the study of control theory. It is also important in the harmonic oscillator.
The damping ratio provides a mathematical means of expressing the level of damping in a system relative to critical damping. For a damped harmonic oscillator with mass m, damping coefficient c, and spring constant k, it can be defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient in the system's differential equation to the critical damping coefficient:






where the system's equation of motion is



and the corresponding critical damping coefficient is



or



The damping ratio is dimensionless, being the ratio of two coefficients of identical units.
Derivation
Using the natural frequency of the simple harmonic oscillator

 
  and the definition of the damping ratio above, we can rewrite this as:



This equation can be solved with the approach.



where C and s are both complex constants. That approach assumes a solution that is oscillatory and/or decaying exponentially. Using it in the ODE gives a condition on the frequency of the damped oscillations,




Undamped: Is the case where 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the undamped simple harmonic oscillator, and in that case the solution looks like 
 
 
 
 , as expected.


Underdamped: If s is a complex number, then the solution is a decaying exponential combined with an oscillatory portion that looks like 
 
 
 
 . This case occurs for 
 
 
 
 , and is referred to as underdamped.


Overdamped: If s is a real number, then the solution is simply a decaying exponential with no oscillation. This case occurs for 
 
 
 
 
 , and is referred to as overdamped.


Critically damped:The case where 
 
 
 
  is the border between the overdamped and underdamped cases, and is referred to as critically damped. This turns out to be a desirable outcome in many cases where engineering design of a damped oscillator is required (e.g., a door closing mechanism).

Q factor and decay rate
The factors Q, damping ratio ζ, and exponential decay rate α are related such that1



When a second-order system has 
 
 
 
  (that is, when the system is underdamped), it has two complex conjugate poles that each have a real part of 
 
 
 
 ; that is, the decay rate parameter 
 
 
 
 
  represents the rate of exponential decay of the oscillations. A lower damping ratio implies a lower decay rate, and so very underdamped systems oscillate for long times.2 For example, a high quality tuning fork, which has a very low damping ratio, has an oscillation that lasts a long time, decaying very slowly after being struck by a hammer.
Logarithmic decrement
The damping ratio is also related to the logarithmic decrement

 
  for underdamped vibrations via the relation



This relation is only meaningful for underdamped systems because the logarithmic decrement is defined as the natural log of the ratio of any two successive amplitudes, and only underdamped systems exhibit oscillation.
