   Propionate CoA-transferase      Propionate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a propionate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + propanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + propanoyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and propanoate , whereas its two products are acetate and propanoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:propanoate CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include propionate coenzyme A-transferase , propionate-CoA:lactoyl-CoA transferase , propionyl CoA:acetate CoA transferase , and propionyl-CoA transferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : pyruvate metabolism , propanoate metabolism , and styrene degradation .
