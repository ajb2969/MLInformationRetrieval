   Faithful representation      Faithful representation   In mathematics , especially in the area of abstract algebra known as representation theory , a faithful representation ρ of a group  G on a vector space  V is a linear representation in which different elements g of G are represented by distinct linear mappings ρ( g ).  In more abstract language, this means that the group homomorphism   ρ: G → GL ( V )   is injective .  Caveat: While representations of G over a field K are de facto the same as    K   [  G  ]       K   delimited-[]  G     K[G]   -modules (with    K   [  G  ]       K   delimited-[]  G     K[G]   denoting the group algebra of the group G ), a faithful representation of G is not necessarily a faithful module for the group algebra. In fact each faithful    K   [  G  ]       K   delimited-[]  G     K[G]   -module is a faithful representation of G , but the converse does not hold. Consider for example the natural representation of the symmetric group  S n in n dimensions by permutation matrices , which is certainly faithful. Here the order of the group is n ! while the n × n matrices form a vector space of dimension n 2 . As soon as n is at least 4, dimension counting means that some linear dependence must occur between permutation matrices (since 24 > 16); this relation means that the module for the group algebra is not faithful.  Properties  A representation V of a finite group G over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero is faithful (as a representation) if and only if every irreducible representation of G occurs as a subrepresentation of S n V (the n -th symmetric power of the representation V ) for a sufficiently high n . Also, V is faithful (as a representation) if and only if every irreducible representation of G occurs as a subrepresentation of       V    ⊗  n    =     V  ⊗  V  ⊗  ⋯  ⊗  V   ⏟    n  times         superscript  V   tensor-product  absent  n     subscript   normal-⏟   tensor-product  V  V  normal-⋯  V      n  times      V^{\otimes n}=\underbrace{V\otimes V\otimes\cdots\otimes V}_{n\text{ times}}   (the n -th tensor power of the representation V ) for a sufficiently high n .
