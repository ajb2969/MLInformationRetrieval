   Bunch–Nielsen–Sorensen formula      Bunch–Nielsen–Sorensen formula   In mathematics , in particular linear algebra , the Bunch–Nielsen–Sorensen formula , 1 named after James R. Bunch, Christopher P. Nielsen and Danny C. Sorensen, expresses the eigenvectors of the sum of a symmetric matrix    A   A   A   and the outer product ,    v   v  T       v   superscript  v  T     vv^{T}   , of vector    v   v   v   with itself.  Statement  Let    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   denote the eigenvalues of   A   A   A   and     λ  ~   i     subscript   normal-~  λ   i    \tilde{\lambda}_{i}   denote the eigenvalues of the updated matrix     A  ~   =   A  +   v   v  T          normal-~  A     A    v   superscript  v  T       \tilde{A}=A+vv^{T}   . In the special case when   A   A   A   is diagonal, the eigenvectors     q  ~   i     subscript   normal-~  q   i    \tilde{q}_{i}   of    A  ~     normal-~  A    \tilde{A}   can be written        (    q  ~   i   )   k   =     N  i    v  k      λ  k   -    λ  ~   i          subscript   subscript   normal-~  q   i   k        subscript  N  i    subscript  v  k       subscript  λ  k    subscript   normal-~  λ   i       (\tilde{q}_{i})_{k}=\frac{N_{i}v_{k}}{\lambda_{k}-\tilde{\lambda}_{i}}     where    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   is a number that makes the vector     q  ~   i     subscript   normal-~  q   i    \tilde{q}_{i}   normalized.  Derivation  This formula can be derived from the Sherman–Morrison formula by examining the poles of     (    A  -   λ  ~    +   v   v  T     )    -  1      superscript      A   normal-~  λ      v   superscript  v  T       1     (A-\tilde{\lambda}+vv^{T})^{-1}   .  Remarks  The eigenvalues of    A  ~     normal-~  A    \tilde{A}   were studied by Golub. 2  Numerical stability of the computation is studied by Gu and Eisenstadt. 3  See also   Sherman–Morrison formula   References  External links   Rank-One Modification of the Symmetric Eigenproblem at EUDML  Some Modified Matrix Eigenvalue Problems  A Stable and Efficient Algorithm for the Rank-One Modification of the Symmetric Eigenproblem   "  Category:Linear algebra     ↩  ↩  ↩
