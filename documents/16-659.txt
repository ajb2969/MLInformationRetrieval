Bunch–Nielsen–Sorensen formula

In mathematics, in particular linear algebra, the Bunch–Nielsen–Sorensen formula,1 named after James R. Bunch, Christopher P. Nielsen and Danny C. Sorensen, expresses the eigenvectors of the sum of a symmetric matrix

 
 
  and the outer product, 
 
 
 
 , of vector

 
  with itself.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  denote the eigenvalues of the updated matrix 
 
 
 
 . In the special case when 
 
 
 
  is diagonal, the eigenvectors 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  can be written



where 
 
 
 
  is a number that makes the vector 
 
 
 
  normalized.
Derivation
This formula can be derived from the Sherman–Morrison formula by examining the poles of 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks
The eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  were studied by Golub.2
Numerical stability of the computation is studied by Gu and Eisenstadt.3
