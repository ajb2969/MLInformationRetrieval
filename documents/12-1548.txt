   Quartic surface      Quartic surface   In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry , a quartic surface is a surface defined by an equation of degree 4.  More specifically there are two closely related types of quartic surface: affine and projective. An affine quartic surface is the solution set of an equation of the form       f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =  0        f   x  y  z    0    f(x,y,z)=0   where f is a polynomial of degree 4, such as f ( x , y , z ) = x 4 + y 4 + xyz + z 2 − 1. This is a surface in affine space  A 3 .  On the other hand, a projective quartic surface is a surface in projective space  P 3 of the same form, but now f is a homogeneous polynomial of 4 variables of degree 4, so for example f ( x , y , z , w ) = x 4 + y 4 + xyzw + z 2 w 2 − w 4 .  If the base field in R or C the surface is said to be real or complex . One must be careful to distinguish between algebraic Riemann surfaces , which are in fact quartic curves over C , and quartic surfaces over R . For instance, the Klein quartic is a real surface given as a quartic curve over C . If on the other hand the base field is finite, then it is said to be an arithmetic quartic surface .
