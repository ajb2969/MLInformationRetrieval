Carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase

Carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase (, CARDO) is an enzyme with system name 9H-carbazole,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (2,3-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

9H-carbazole + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol + NAD(P)+


Carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase catalyses the first reaction in the pathway of carbazole degradation.
