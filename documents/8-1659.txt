   Phase factor      Phase factor   For any complex number written in polar form (such as r e i θ ), the phase factor is the complex exponential factor (e i θ ). As such, the term "phase factor" is related to the more general term phasor , which may have any magnitude (i.e., not necessarily part of the circle group ). The phase factor is a unit complex number , i.e., of absolute value  1 . It is commonly used in quantum mechanics.  The variable θ appearing in such an expression is generally referred to as the phase . Multiplying the equation of a plane wave  A e i( k·r − ωt ) by a phase factor shifts the phase of the wave by θ :        e   i  θ    A   e   i   (    𝐤  ⋅  𝐫   -   ω  t    )      =   A   e   i   (     𝐤  ⋅  𝐫   -   ω  t    +  θ   )             superscript  e    i  θ    A   superscript  e    i     normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐫     ω  t         A   superscript  e    i       normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐫     ω  t    θ        \text{e}^{i\theta}A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t}\right%
 )}=A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t+\theta}\right)}   .  In quantum mechanics , a phase factor is a complex coefficient e i θ that multiplies a ket     |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   or bra     ⟨  ϕ  |     bra  ϕ    \langle\phi|   . It does not, in itself, have any physical meaning, since the introduction of a phase factor does not change the expectation values of a Hermitian operator . That is, the values of    ⟨  ϕ  |  A  |  ϕ  ⟩     quantum-operator-product  ϕ  A  ϕ    \langle\phi|A|\phi\rangle   and    ⟨  ϕ  |    e   -   i  θ     A   e   i  θ     |  ϕ  ⟩     quantum-operator-product  ϕ     superscript  e      i  θ     A   superscript  e    i  θ     ϕ    \langle\phi|e^{-i\theta}Ae^{i\theta}|\phi\rangle   are the same. 1 However, differences in phase factors between two interacting quantum states can sometimes be measurable (such as in the Berry phase ) and this can have important consequences.  In optics , the phase factor is an important quantity in the treatment of interference .
