Finite-dimensional distribution

In mathematics, finite-dimensional distributions are a tool in the study of measures and stochastic processes. A lot of information can be gained by studying the "projection" of a measure (or process) onto a finite-dimensional vector space (or finite collection of times).
Finite-dimensional distributions of a measure
Let 
 
 
 
  be a measure space. The finite-dimensional distributions of 
 
 
 
  are the pushforward measures

 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , is any measurable function.
Finite-dimensional distributions of a stochastic process
Let 
 
 
 
  be a probability space and let 
 
 
 
  be a stochastic process. The finite-dimensional distributions of 
 
 
 
  are the push forward measures 
 
 
 
  on the product space

 
  for 
 
 
 
  defined by



Very often, this condition is stated in terms of measurable rectangles:



The definition of the finite-dimensional distributions of a process 
 
 
 
  is related to the definition for a measure 
 
 
 
  in the following way: recall that the law

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a measure on the collection 
 
 
 
  of all functions from 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 . In general, this is an infinite-dimensional space. The finite dimensional distributions of 
 
 
 
  are the push forward measures 
 
 
 
  on the finite-dimensional product space 
 
 
 
 , where


 
  is the natural "evaluate at times 
 
 
 
 " function.
Relation to tightness
It can be shown that if a sequence of probability measures

 
  is tight and all the finite-dimensional distributions of the 
 
 
converge weakly to the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions of some probability measure 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  converges weakly to 
 
 
 
 .
