   Quasi-commutative property      Quasi-commutative property   In mathematics , the quasi-commutative property is an extension or generalization of the general commutative property . This property is used in certain specific applications with various definitions.  Applied to matrices  Two matrices  p and q are said to have the commutative property whenever       p  q   =   q  p         p  q     q  p     pq=qp     The quasi-commutative property in matrices is defined 1 as follows. Given two non-commutable matrices x and y        x  y   -   y  x    =  z          x  y     y  x    z    xy-yx=z   satisfy the quasi-commutative property whenever z satisfies the following properties:       x  z   =   z  x         x  z     z  x     xz=zx          y  z   =   z  y         y  z     z  y     yz=zy     An example is found in the matrix mechanics introduced by Heisenberg as a version of quantum mechanics . In this mechanics, p and q are infinite matrices corresponding respectively to the momentum and position variables of a particle. 2 These matrices are written out at Matrix mechanics#Harmonic oscillator , and z = iħ times the infinite unit matrix , where ħ is the reduced Planck constant .  Applied to functions  A function f , defined as follows:      f  :    X  ×  Y   →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→    X  Y   X     f:X\times Y\rightarrow X   is said to be quasi-commutative 3 if for all    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   and for all      y  1   ,   y  2    ∈  Y        subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2    Y    y_{1},y_{2}\in Y   ,       f   (   f   (  x  ,   y  1   )    ,   y  2   )    =   f   (   f   (  x  ,   y  2   )    ,   y  1   )          f     f   x   subscript  y  1      subscript  y  2       f     f   x   subscript  y  2      subscript  y  1       f(f(x,y_{1}),y_{2})=f(f(x,y_{2}),y_{1})     See also   Commutative property  Accumulator (cryptography)   References  "  Category:Mathematical relations  *Quasi-commutativity     Neal H.
