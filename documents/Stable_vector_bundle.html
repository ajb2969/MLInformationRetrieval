<h1>Stable vector bundle</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In mathematics, a <strong>stable vector bundle</strong> is a <a href="vector_bundle" title="wikilink">vector bundle</a> that is stable in the sense of <a href="geometric_invariant_theory" title="wikilink">geometric invariant theory</a>. They were defined by .</p>

<p>A bundle <em>W</em> over an <a href="algebraic_curve" title="wikilink">algebraic curve</a> (or over a <a href="Riemann_surface" title="wikilink">Riemann surface</a>) is stable if and only if</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle\frac{\deg(V)}{\hbox{rank}(V)} < \frac{\deg(W)}{\hbox{rank}(W)}$$</span></p>
<p>for all proper non-zero subbundles <em>V</em> of <em>W</em> and is semistable if</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\displaystyle\frac{\deg(V)}{\hbox{rank}(V)} \le \frac{\deg(W)}{\hbox{rank}(W)}$$</span></p>
<p>for all proper non-zero subbundles <em>V</em> of <em>W</em>. Informally this says that a bundle is stable if it is "more <a class="uri" href="ample" title="wikilink">ample</a>" than any proper subbundle, and is unstable if it contains a "more ample" subbundle. The moduli space of stable bundles of given rank and degree is an <a href="algebraic_variety" title="wikilink">algebraic variety</a>.</p>
<p>showed that stable bundles on projective nonsingular curves are the same as those that have projectively flat unitary irreducible connections; these correspond to irreducible unitary representations of the fundamental group. Kobayashi and <a href="Nigel_Hitchin" title="wikilink">Hitchin</a> conjectured an analogue of this in higher dimensions; this was proved for projective nonsingular surfaces by , who showed that in this case a vector bundle is stable if and only if it has an irreducible <a href="Hermitian–Einstein_connection" title="wikilink">Hermitian–Einstein connection</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a> of the <a href="moduli_space" title="wikilink">moduli space</a> of stable vector bundles over a curve was described by  and .</p>

<p>If <em>X</em> is a smooth projective variety of dimension <em>n</em> and <em>H</em> is a hyperplane section, then a vector bundle (or torsionfree sheaf) <em>W</em> is called stable if</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\frac{\chi(V(nH))}{\hbox{rank}(V)} < \frac{\chi(W(nH))}{\hbox{rank}(W)}\text{ for }n\text{ large}$$</span></p>
<p>for all proper non-zero subbundles (or subsheaves) <em>V</em> of <em>W</em>, where <span class="LaTeX">$\chi$</span> denotes the Euler characteristic of an algebraic vector bundle and the vector bundle <span class="LaTeX">$V(nH)$</span> means the <em>n</em>-th twist of <em>V</em> by <em>H</em>. <em>W</em> is called semistable if the above holds with </p>
