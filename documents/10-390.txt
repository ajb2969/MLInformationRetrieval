Quadratic eigenvalue problem

In mathematics, the quadratic eigenvalue problem1 (QEP), is to find scalar eigenvalues

 
 , left eigenvectors

 
 
  and right eigenvectors 
 
 
 
  such that



where 
 
 
 
 , with matrix coefficients 
 
 
 
  and we require that 
 
 
 
 
 , (so that we have a nonzero leading coefficient). There are 
 
 
 
  eigenvalues that may be infinite or finite, and possibly zero. This is a special case of a nonlinear eigenproblem. 
 
 
 
  is also known as a quadratic matrix polynomial.
Applications
A QEP can result in part of the dynamic analysis of structures discretized by the finite element method. In this case the quadratic, 
 
 
 
  has the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is the mass matrix, 
 
 
 
  is the damping matrix and 
 
 
 
  is the stiffness matrix. Other applications include vibro-acoustics and fluid dynamics.
Methods of solution
Direct methods for solving the standard or generalized eigenvalue problems 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are based on transforming the problem to Schur or Generalized Schur form. However, there is no analogous form for quadratic matrix polynomials. One approach is to transform the quadratic matrix polynomial to a linear matrix pencil (
 
 
 
 
 ), and solve a generalized eigenvalue problem. Once eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linear problem have been determined, eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the quadratic can be determined.
The most common linearization is the first companion linearization


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 
 -by-
 
 
 
  identity matrix, with corresponding eigenvector


 
  We solve 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for example by computing the Generalized Schur form. We can then take the first 
 
 
 
  components of 
 
 
 
  as the eigenvector 
 
 
 
  of the original quadratic 
 
 
 
 .
