   Potential of mean force      Potential of mean force   General description  The PMF is a type of simulation which can be done in Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulations which examines how a system's energy changes as a function of some specific reaction coordinate parameter. For example, it may examine how the system's energy changes as a function of the distance between two residues, or as a protein is pulled through a lipid bilayer. It can be a geometrical coordinate or a more general energetic (solvent) coordinate. Often PMF simulations are used in conjunction with umbrella sampling because typically the PMF simulation will fail to adequately sample the system space as it proceeds. 1  Mathematical description  The Potential of Mean Force  2 of a system with N particles is strictly the potential that gives the average force over all the configurations of all the n+1...N particles acting on a particle j at any fixed configuration keeping fixed a set of particles 1...n        -   ∇  j     w   (  n  )     =     ∫    e   -   β  V      (   -    ∇  j   V    )   d   q   n  +  1    …  d   q  N         ∫    e   -   β  V     d   q   n  +  1    …     .   d   q  N      ,  j  =  1  ,  2  ,  …  .  ,  n     fragments    subscript  normal-∇  j    superscript  w  n           superscript  e      β  V         subscript  normal-∇  j   V    d   subscript  q    n  1    normal-…  d   subscript  q  N      formulae-sequence       superscript  e      β  V     d   subscript  q    n  1    normal-…      d   subscript  q  N      normal-,  j   1  normal-,  2  normal-,  normal-…  normal-.  normal-,  n    -\nabla_{j}w^{(n)}\,=\,\frac{\int e^{-\beta V}(-\nabla_{j}V)dq_{n+1}...dq_{N}}%

And    w   (  n  )      superscript  w  n    w^{(n)}   is the so-called potential of mean force. For    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   ,     w   (  2  )     (  r  )        superscript  w  2   r    w^{(2)}(r)   is the average work needed to bring the two particles from infinite separation to a distance   r   r   r   . It is also related to the radial distribution function of the system,    g   (  r  )       g  r    g(r)   , by: 3         g   (  r  )    =   e   -   β   w   (  2  )     (  r  )            g  r    superscript  e      β   superscript  w  2   r       g(r)=e^{-\beta w^{(2)}(r)}        Application  The potential of mean force    w   (  2  )      superscript  w  2    w^{(2)}   is usually applied in the Boltzmann inversion method as first guess for the effective pair interaction potential that ought reproduce the correct radial distribution function in a mesoscopic simulation. 4  See also   Statistical potential   References  Further reading   McQuarrie, D.
