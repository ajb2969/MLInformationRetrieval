Thymidylate kinase

Thymidylate kinase (; dTMP kinase) catalyzes the phosphorylation of thymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP) to form thymidine 5'-diphosphate (dTDP) in the presence of ATP and magnesium:

ATP + thymidine 5'-phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + thymidine 5'-diphosphate
 

Thymidylate kinase is a ubiquitous enzyme of about 25 Kd and is important in the dTTP synthesis pathway for DNA synthesis. The function of dTMP kinase in eukaryotes comes from the study of a cell cycle mutant, cdc8, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural and functional analyses suggest that the cDNA codes for authentic human dTMP kinase. The mRNA levels and enzyme activities corresponded to cell cycle progression and cell growth stages.1
