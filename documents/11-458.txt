Choline-sulfatase

In enzymology, a choline-sulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

choline sulfate + H2O 
 
 
 
  choline + sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are choline sulfate and H2O, whereas its two products are choline and sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is choline-sulfate sulfohydrolase.
