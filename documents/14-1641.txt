Perimeter/Circumference





Square

A = side^2

P = 4 x side



Rectangle ( l = length, w = width)

A = l × w

P = 2l + 2w



Circle

A = π × 
 
 


C = 2 × π × r



Ellipse (where a is the semimajor axis and b is the semiminor axis)

A = π × a × b




Triangle (b = base, h = height, a,b,c = sides)

A = ½ × b × h

P = a + b + c



Parallelogram (b = base, h = height, a = side)

A = b × h

P = 2a + 2b



Trapezoid (where a and b are the bases)

A = ½(a + b) × h
