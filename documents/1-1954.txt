   Angular displacement      Angular displacement   (Figure)  Rotation of a rigid object P about a fixed object about a fixed axis O .   Angular displacement of a body is the angle in radians ( degrees , revolutions ) through which a point or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis . When an object rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, since in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time ( t ). When dealing with the rotation of an object, it becomes simpler to consider the body itself rigid. A body is generally considered rigid when the separations between all the particles remains constant throughout the objects motion, so for example parts of its mass are not flying off. In a realistic sense, all things can be deformable, however this impact is minimal and negligible. Thus the rotation of a rigid body over a fixed axis is referred to as rotational motion .  Example  In the example illustrated to the right (or above in some mobile versions) , a particle on object P at a fixed distance r from the origin, O , rotating counterclockwise. It becomes important to then represent the position of particle P in terms of its polar coordinates ( r , θ ). In this particular example, the value of θ is changing, while the value of the radius remains the same. (In rectangular coordinates ( x , y ) both x and y vary with time). As the particle moves along the circle, it travels an arc length  s , which becomes related to the angular position through the relationship:      s  =   r   θ        s    r  θ     s=r\theta\,     Measurements of angular displacement  Angular displacement may be measured in radians or degrees. If using radians, it provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle and the distance r from the centre.      θ  =   s  r       θ    s  r     \theta=\frac{s}{r}     For example if an object rotates 360 degrees around a circle of radius r , the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2π r divided by the radius    θ  =    2  π  r   r       θ      2  π  r   r     \theta=\frac{2\pi r}{r}   which easily simplifies to    θ  =   2  π       θ    2  π     \theta=2\pi   . Therefore 1 revolution is    2  π      2  π    2\pi   radians.  When object travels from point P to point Q, as it does in the illustration to the left, over    δ  t      δ  t    \delta t   the radius of the circle goes around a change in angle.     Δ  θ   =    Δ   θ  2    -   Δ   θ  1           normal-Δ  θ       normal-Δ   subscript  θ  2      normal-Δ   subscript  θ  1       \Delta\theta=\Delta\theta_{2}-\Delta\theta_{1}   which equals the Angular Displacement .  Three dimensions  In three dimensions, angular displacement is an entity with a direction and a magnitude. The direction specifies the axis of rotation, which always exists by virtue of the Euler's rotation theorem ; the magnitude specifies the rotation in radians about that axis (using the right-hand rule to determine direction).  Despite having direction and magnitude, angular displacement is not a vector because it does not obey the commutative law for addition. 1  Matrix notation  Given that any frame in the space can be described by a rotation matrix, the displacement among them can also be described by a rotation matrix. Being    A  0     subscript  A  0    A_{0}   and    A  f     subscript  A  f    A_{f}   two matrices, the angular displacement matrix between them can be obtained as      d  A   =   A  f    .
