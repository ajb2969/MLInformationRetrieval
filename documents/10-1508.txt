L-pipecolate dehydrogenase




L-pipecolate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a L-pipecolate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-pipecolate + acceptor 
 
 
 
  2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-pipecolate and acceptor, whereas its two products are 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-pipecolate:acceptor 1,6-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called L-pipecolate:(acceptor) 1,6-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation.
