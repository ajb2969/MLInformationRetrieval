   Majority logic decoding      Majority logic decoding   In error detection and correction , majority logic decoding is a method to decode repetition codes , based on the assumption that the largest number of occurrences of a symbol was the transmitted symbol.  Theory  In a binary alphabet made of    0  ,  1     0  1    0,1   , if a    (  n  ,  1  )     n  1    (n,1)   repetition code is used, then each input bit is mapped to the code word as a string of   n   n   n   -replicated input bits. Generally    n  =    2  t   +  1       n      2  t   1     n=2t+1   , an odd number.  The repetition codes can detect up to    [   n  /  2   ]     delimited-[]    n  2     [n/2]   transmission errors. Decoding errors occur when the more than these transmission errors occur. Thus, assuming bit-transmission errors are independent, the probability of error for a repetition code is given by     P  e   =    ∑   k  =    n  +  1   2    n     (      n      k      )    ϵ  k     (   1  -  ϵ   )    (   n  -  k   )           subscript  P  e     superscript   subscript     k      n  1   2     n      binomial  n  k    superscript  ϵ  k    superscript    1  ϵ     n  k        P_{e}=\sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n}{n\choose k}\epsilon^{k}(1-\epsilon)^{(n-k)}   , where   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the error over the transmission channel.  Algorithm  Assumptions  The code word is    (  n  ,  1  )     n  1    (n,1)   , where    n  =    2  t   +  1       n      2  t   1     n=2t+1   , an odd number.   Calculate the    d  H     subscript  d  H    d_{H}    Hamming weight of the repetition code.  if     d  H   ≤  t       subscript  d  H   t    d_{H}\leq t   , decode code word to be all 0's  if     d  H   ≥   t  +  1        subscript  d  H     t  1     d_{H}\geq t+1   , decode code word to be all 1's   Example  In a    (  n  ,  1  )     n  1    (n,1)   code, if R=[1 0 1 1 0], then it would be decoded as,        n  =  5   ,   t  =  2      formulae-sequence    n  5     t  2     n=5,t=2   ,     d  H   =  3       subscript  d  H   3    d_{H}=3   , so R'=[1 1 1 1 1]  Hence the transmitted message bit was 1.
