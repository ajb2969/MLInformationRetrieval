Majority logic decoding

In error detection and correction, majority logic decoding is a method to decode repetition codes, based on the assumption that the largest number of occurrences of a symbol was the transmitted symbol.
Theory
In a binary alphabet made of 
 
 
 
 , if a 
 
 
 
  repetition code is used, then each input bit is mapped to the code word as a string of 
 
 
 
 -replicated input bits. Generally 
 
 
 
 , an odd number.
The repetition codes can detect up to 
 
 
 
  transmission errors. Decoding errors occur when the more than these transmission errors occur. Thus, assuming bit-transmission errors are independent, the probability of error for a repetition code is given by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the error over the transmission channel.
Algorithm
Assumptions
The code word is 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , an odd number.

Calculate the 
 
 
Hamming weight of the repetition code.
if 
 
 
 
 , decode code word to be all 0's
if 
 
 
 
 , decode code word to be all 1's

Example
In a 
 
 
 
  code, if R=[1 0 1 1 0], then it would be decoded as,



 
 , 
 
 
 
 , so R'=[1 1 1 1 1]
Hence the transmitted message bit was 1.
