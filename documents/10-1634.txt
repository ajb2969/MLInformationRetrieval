   Cycloartenol synthase      Cycloartenol synthase   In enzymology , a cycloartenol synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cycloartenol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (S)-2,3-epoxy squalene , and one product , cycloartenol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene mutase (cyclizing, cycloartenol-forming) . Other names in common use include 2,3-epoxysqualene cycloartenol-cyclase , squalene-2,3-epoxide-cycloartenol cyclase , 2,3-epoxysqualene cycloartenol-cyclase , 2,3-epoxysqualene-cycloartenol cyclase , and 2,3-oxidosqualene-cycloartenol cyclase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .  References     "  Category:EC 5.4.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
