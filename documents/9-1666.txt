N = 1 supersymmetry algebra in 1 + 1 dimensions

In 1 + 1 dimensions the N = 1 supersymmetry algebra (also known as 
 
 
 
  because we have one left-moving SUSY generator and one right moving one) has the following generators:

supersymmetric charges


supersymmetric central charge
 
 

time translation generator
 
 

space translation generator
 
 

boost generator
 
 

fermionic parity


unit element



The following relations are satisfied by the generators:



 
  is a central element.
The supersymmetry algebra admits a 
 
 
-grading. The generators 
 
 
 
  are even (degree 0), the generators 
 
 
 
 
  are odd (degree 1).
2(H − P) gives the left-moving momentum and 2(H + P) the right-moving momentum.
Basic representations of this algebra are the vacuum, kink and boson-fermion representations, which are relevant e.g. to the supersymmetric (quantum) sine-Gordon model.
