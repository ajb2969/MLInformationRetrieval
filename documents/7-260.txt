   Recessional velocity      Recessional velocity   Recessional velocity is the rate at which an object is moving away, typically from Earth .  Application to cosmology  Recessional velocity is most pertinent to distant galaxies , which (due to Hubble's Law ) redshift proportionally to their distance from the Earth. The redshift is usually interpreted as due to recessional velocity, which can be calculated according to the formula:      v  =    H  0   D       v     subscript  H  0   D     v=H_{0}D     where    H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   is the Hubble constant ,   D   D   D   is the intervening distance, and   v   v   v   is the recessional velocity, generally measured in km/s.  The recessional velocity of a galaxy is usually calculated from the redshift observed in its emitted electromagnetic radiation . The distance to the galaxy is then estimated using Hubble's Law . Since the distance is constantly increasing, the recession velocity is also increasing in magnitude. Therefore, "recession velocity" is a misnomer. More properly, this phenomena should be referred to as the recession acceleration.  References  "  Category:Observational astronomy
