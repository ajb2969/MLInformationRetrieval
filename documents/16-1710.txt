Combining rules




Combining rules
In [[computational chemistry]] and [[molecular dynamics]], the '''combination rules''' or '''combining rules''' are equati
 ons that provide the interaction energy between two dissimilar non-bonded atoms, usually for the part of the potential representing the van der Waals interaction.1 In the simulation of mixtures, the choice of combining rules can sometimes effect the outcome of the simulation.2
Combining rules for the Lennard-Jones potential
Lorentz-Berthelot rules
The Lorentz rule was proposed by H. A. Lorentz in 1881:3



The Loretz rule is only analytically correct for hard sphere systems.
The Berthelot rule (Daniel Berthelot, 1898) is given by:4



These rules are the most widely used and are the default in many molecular simulation packages, but are not without failings.567
Waldman-Hagler rules
The Waldman-Hagler rules are given by:8


 
  and



Fender-Halsey
The Fender-Halsey combining rule is given by 9



Kong rules
The Kong rules for the Lennard-Jones potential are given by:10






Others
Many others have been proposed, including those of Tang and Toennies11 Pena,1213 Hudson and McCoubrey14 and Sikora(1970).15
Combining rules for other potentials
Good-Hope rule
The Good-Hope rule for Mie–Lennard‐Jones or Buckingham potentials is given by:16



Hogervorst rules
The Hogervorst rules for the Exp-6 potential are:17


 
  and



Kong-Chakrabarty rules
The Kong-Chakrabarty rules for the Exp-6 potential are:18






and



Other rules for that have been proposed for the Exp-6 potential are the Mason-Rice rules19 and the Srivastava and Srivastava rules (1956).20
