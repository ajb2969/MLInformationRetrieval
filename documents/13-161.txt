   Danny Calegari      Danny Calegari    Danny M. C. Calegari (born 24 May 1972, Australia ) is an Australian-American mathematician who was the Richard Merkin Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology , and is one of the recipients of the 2009 Clay Research Award for his work in geometric topology and geometric group theory . He has joined the faculty of the University of Chicago .  Education and early career  In 1994, Calegari received a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Melbourne with honors. He received his Ph.D. in 2000 from the University of California, Berkeley under the joint supervision of Andrew Casson and William Thurston ; his dissertation concerned foliations of three-dimensional manifolds . 1  From 2000–2002 he was Benjamin Peirce Assistant Professor at Harvard University , after which he joined the California Institute of Technology faculty; he became Merkin Professor in 2007. 2 In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 3  Calegari is also an author of short fiction, published in Quadrant , Southerly , and Overland . His story A Green Light was a winner of a 1992 The Age Short Story Award . 4  Selected works   Foliations and the geometry of 3-manifolds .
