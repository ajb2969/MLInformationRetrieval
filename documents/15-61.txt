   Sayre equation      Sayre equation   In crystallography , the Sayre equation , named after David Sayre who introduced it in 1952, is a mathematical relationship that allows to calculate probable values for the phases of some diffracted beams. It is used when employing direct methods to solve a structure. Its formulation is the following:       F   h  k  l    =    ∑    h  ′    k  ′    l  ′       F    h  ′    k  ′    l  ′      F    h  -   h  ′    ,   k  -   k  ′    ,   l  -   l  ′             subscript  F    h  k  l      subscript      superscript  h  normal-′    superscript  k  normal-′    superscript  l  normal-′        subscript  F     superscript  h  normal-′    superscript  k  normal-′    superscript  l  normal-′      subscript  F     h   superscript  h  normal-′      k   superscript  k  normal-′      l   superscript  l  normal-′          F_{hkl}=\sum_{h^{\prime}k^{\prime}l^{\prime}}F_{h^{\prime}k^{\prime}l^{\prime}%
 }F_{h-h^{\prime},k-k^{\prime},l-l^{\prime}}     which states how the structure factor for a beam can be calculated as the sum of the products of pairs of structure factors whose indices sum to the desired values of    h  ,  k  ,  l     h  k  l    h,k,l   . Since weak diffracted beams will contribute a little to the sum, this method can be a powerful way of finding the phase of related beams, if some of the initial phases are already known by other methods.  In particular, for three such related beams in a centrosymmetric structure, the phases can only be 0 or   π   π   \pi   and the Sayre equation reduces to the triplet relationship:       S  h   ≈    S   h  ′     S   h  -   h  ′           subscript  S  h      subscript  S   superscript  h  normal-′     subscript  S    h   superscript  h  normal-′        S_{h}\approx S_{h^{\prime}}S_{h-h^{\prime}}     where the   S   S   S   indicates the sign of the structure factor (positive if the phase is 0 and negative if it is   π   π   \pi   ) and the   ≈     \approx   sign indicates that there is a certain degree of probability that the relationship is true, which becomes higher the stronger the beams are.
