Simpson correspondence

In algebraic geometry, the Simpson correspondence (named after Carlos Simpson) is a description vector bundles in terms of representations of the fundamental group.
Unitary representations
For a compact Riemann surface X of genus at least 2, Narasimhan and Seshadri established a bijection between irreducible unitary representations of 
 
 
 
  and the isomorphism classes of stable vector bundles of degree 0.1 This was then extended to arbitrary complex smooth projective varieties by Donaldson.2
Arbitrary representations
The previous results were extended to arbitrary representations by Simpson, who established an equivalence of categories between the finite-dimensional complex representations of the fundamental group and the semi-stable Higgs bundles whose Chern class is zero.34
