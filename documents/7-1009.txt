   Krasovskii–LaSalle principle      Krasovskii–LaSalle principle   The Krasovskii–LaSalle principle (also known as the invariance principle 1 ) is a criterion for the asymptotic stability of an autonomous (possibly nonlinear) dynamical system .  The global Krasovskii–LaSalle principle  Given a representation of the system       𝐱  ˙   =   f   (  𝐱  )         normal-˙  𝐱     f  𝐱     \dot{\mathbf{x}}=f\left(\mathbf{x}\right)     where   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   is the vector of variables, with       f   (  𝟎  )    =  𝟎        f  0   0    f\left(\mathbf{0}\right)=\mathbf{0}     If a    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}    function     V   (  𝐱  )       V  𝐱    V(\mathbf{x})   can be found such that       V   (  𝐱  )    >  0        V  𝐱   0    V(\mathbf{x})>0   , for all    𝐱  ≠  𝟎      𝐱  0    \mathbf{x}\neq\mathbf{0}   (positive definite)        V  ˙    (  𝐱  )    ≤  0         normal-˙  V   𝐱   0    \dot{V}(\mathbf{x})\leq 0   for all   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   (negative semidefinite)       V   (  𝐱  )    →  ∞     normal-→    V  𝐱      V(\mathbf{x})\to\infty   , if    𝐱  →  ∞     normal-→  𝐱     \mathbf{x}\to\infty   and       V   (  𝟎  )    =    V  ˙    (  𝟎  )    =  0          V  0      normal-˙  V   0        0     V(\mathbf{0})=\dot{V}(\mathbf{0})=0   (Such functions can be thought of as "energy-like".)  Let   ℐ   ℐ   {\mathcal{I}}   be the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set    {  𝐱  :     V  ˙    (  𝐱  )    =  0   }     conditional-set  𝐱       normal-˙  V   𝐱   0     \{\mathbf{x}:\dot{V}(\mathbf{x})=0\}   . Then the set of accumulation points of any trajectory is contained in   ℐ   ℐ   {\mathcal{I}}   .  In particular, if   ℐ   ℐ   {\mathcal{I}}   contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory     𝐱   (  t  )    =  𝟎        𝐱  t   0    \mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{0}   for    t  ≥  0      t  0    t\geq 0   , then the origin is globally asymptotically stable .  Local version of the Krasovskii–LaSalle principle  If       V   (  𝐱  )    >  0        V  𝐱   0    V(\mathbf{x})>0   , when    𝐱  ≠  𝟎      𝐱  0    \mathbf{x}\neq\mathbf{0}           V  ˙    (  𝐱  )    ≤  0         normal-˙  V   𝐱   0    \dot{V}(\mathbf{x})\leq 0     hold only for   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   in some neighborhood   D   D   D   of the origin, and the set       {   V  ˙    (  𝐱  )   =  0  }   ⋂  D     fragments   fragments  normal-{   normal-˙  V    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    0  normal-}    D    \{\dot{V}(\mathbf{x})=0\}\bigcap D     does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory      𝐱   (  t  )    =  𝟎   ,   t  ≥  0      formulae-sequence      𝐱  t   0     t  0     \mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{0},t\geq 0   , then the local version of the Krasovskii–LaSalle principle states that the origin is locally asymptotically stable .  Relation to Lyapunov theory  If     V  ˙    (  𝐱  )        normal-˙  V   𝐱    \dot{V}(\mathbf{x})   is negative definite , the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of Lyapunov's second theorem . The Krasovskii–LaSalle principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when     V  ˙    (  𝐱  )        normal-˙  V   𝐱    \dot{V}(\mathbf{x})   is only negative semidefinite .  Example: the pendulum with friction  This section will apply the Krasovskii–LaSalle principle to establish the local asymptotic stability of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation       m  l   θ  ¨    =    -   m  g   sin  θ     -   k  l   θ  ˙           m  l   normal-¨  θ          m  g    θ       k  l   normal-˙  θ       ml\ddot{\theta}=-mg\sin\theta-kl\dot{\theta}     where   θ   θ   \theta   is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal,   m   m   m   is the mass of the pendulum,   l   l   l   is the length of the pendulum,   k   k   k   is the friction coefficient , and g is acceleration due to gravity.  This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations        x  ˙   1   =   x  2        subscript   normal-˙  x   1    subscript  x  2     \dot{x}_{1}=x_{2}           x  ˙   2   =    -    g  l    sin   x  1      -    k  m    x  2          subscript   normal-˙  x   2           g  l      subscript  x  1          k  m    subscript  x  2       \dot{x}_{2}=-\frac{g}{l}\sin x_{1}-\frac{k}{m}x_{2}     Using the Krasovskii–LaSalle principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin     x  1   =   x  2   =  0         subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2        0     x_{1}=x_{2}=0   asymptotically converge to the origin. We define    V   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )       V    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      V(x_{1},x_{2})   as       V   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    =     g  l    (   1  -   cos   x  1     )    +    1  2    x  2  2           V    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2           g  l     1     subscript  x  1          1  2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2       V(x_{1},x_{2})=\frac{g}{l}(1-\cos x_{1})+\frac{1}{2}x_{2}^{2}     This    V   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )       V    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      V(x_{1},x_{2})   is simply the scaled energy of the system  Clearly,    V   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )       V    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      V(x_{1},x_{2})   is positive definite in an open ball of radius   π   π   \pi   around the origin. Computing the derivative,        V  ˙    (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    =     g  l    sin    x  1     x  ˙   1      +    x  2     x  ˙   2     =   -    k  m    x  2  2              normal-˙  V     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2           g  l        subscript  x  1    subscript   normal-˙  x   1         subscript  x  2    subscript   normal-˙  x   2                k  m    superscript   subscript  x  2   2        \dot{V}(x_{1},x_{2})=\frac{g}{l}\sin x_{1}\dot{x}_{1}+x_{2}\dot{x}_{2}=-\frac{%
 k}{m}x_{2}^{2}     Observe that     V   (  0  )    =    V  ˙    (  0  )    =  0          V  0      normal-˙  V   0        0     V(0)=\dot{V}(0)=0   . If it were true that     V  ˙   <  0       normal-˙  V   0    \dot{V}<0   , we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by Lyapunov's second theorem . Unfortunately,     V  ˙   ≤  0       normal-˙  V   0    \dot{V}\leq 0   and    V  ˙     normal-˙  V    \dot{V}   is only negative semidefinite . However, the set      S  =   {   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )   |     V  ˙    (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    =  0   }       S   conditional-set    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2         normal-˙  V     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     0      S=\{(x_{1},x_{2})|\dot{V}(x_{1},x_{2})=0\}     which is simply the set      S  =   {   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )   |    x  2   =  0   }       S   conditional-set    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       subscript  x  2   0      S=\{(x_{1},x_{2})|x_{2}=0\}     does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory x = 0 . Indeed, if at some time   t   t   t   ,      x  2    (  t  )    =  0         subscript  x  2   t   0    x_{2}(t)=0   , then because    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   must be less than   π   π   \pi   away from the origin,     sin   x  1    ≠  0         subscript  x  1    0    \sin x_{1}\neq 0   and       x  ˙   2    (  t  )    ≠  0         subscript   normal-˙  x   2   t   0    \dot{x}_{2}(t)\neq 0   . As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set   S   S   S   .  All the conditions of the local Krasovskii–LaSalle principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as    t  →  ∞     normal-→  t     t\rightarrow\infty   .  History  While LaSalle was the first author in the West to publish this theorem in 1960, its first publication was in 1952 by Barbashin and Krasovskii in a special case, and in 1959 by Krasovskii in the general case .
