   Glycosyltransferase DesVII      Glycosyltransferase DesVII   Glycosyltransferase DesVII (, DesVII ) is an enzyme with system name dTDP-3-dimethylamino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose:10-deoxymethynolide 3-dimethylamino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   dTDP-3-dimethylamino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose + 10-deoxymethynolide    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTDP + 10-deoxymethymycin   DesVII is the glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of TDP-D-desosamine to macrolactones of varied ring sizes.
