Glycosyltransferase DesVII

Glycosyltransferase DesVII (, DesVII) is an enzyme with system name dTDP-3-dimethylamino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose:10-deoxymethynolide 3-dimethylamino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

dTDP-3-dimethylamino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose + 10-deoxymethynolide

 
  dTDP + 10-deoxymethymycin
 

DesVII is the glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of TDP-D-desosamine to macrolactones of varied ring sizes.
