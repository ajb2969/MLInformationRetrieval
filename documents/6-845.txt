   Neumann series      Neumann series   A Neumann series is a mathematical series of the form       ∑   k  =  0   ∞    T  k       superscript   subscript     k  0       superscript  T  k     \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}T^{k}   where T is an operator . Hence, T k is a mathematical notation for k consecutive operations of the operator T . This generalizes the geometric series .  The series is named after the mathematician Carl Neumann , who used it in 1877 in the context of potential theory . The Neumann series is used in functional analysis . It forms the basis of the Liouville-Neumann series , which is used to solve Fredholm integral equations . It is also important when studying the spectrum of bounded operators.  Properties  Suppose that T is a bounded operator on the normed vector space  X . If the Neumann series converges in the operator norm , then Id – T is invertible and its inverse is the series:        (   Id  -  T   )    -  1    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞    T  k         superscript    Id  T     1      superscript   subscript     k  0       superscript  T  k      (\mathrm{Id}-T)^{-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}T^{k}   , where   Id   Id   \mathrm{Id}   is the identity operator in X . To see why, consider the partial sums       S  n   :=    ∑   k  =  0   n    T  k       assign   subscript  S  n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n    superscript  T  k      S_{n}:=\sum_{k=0}^{n}T^{k}   . Then we have         lim   n  →  ∞      (   Id  -  T   )    S  n     =    lim   n  →  ∞     (     ∑   k  =  0   n    T  k    -    ∑   k  =  0   n    T   k  +  1      )    =    lim   n  →  ∞     (   Id  -   T   n  +  1     )    =  Id   .          subscript    normal-→  n         Id  T    subscript  S  n       subscript    normal-→  n         superscript   subscript     k  0    n    superscript  T  k      superscript   subscript     k  0    n    superscript  T    k  1              subscript    normal-→  n       Id   superscript  T    n  1           Id     \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(\mathrm{Id}-T)S_{n}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(%
 \sum_{k=0}^{n}T^{k}-\sum_{k=0}^{n}T^{k+1}\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}%
 \left(\mathrm{Id}-T^{n+1}\right)=\mathrm{Id}.   This result on operators is analogous to geometric series in   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , in which we find that:       1   1  -  x    =   1  +  x  +   x  2   +  ⋯         1    1  x      1  x   superscript  x  2   normal-⋯     \frac{1}{1-x}=1+x+x^{2}+\cdots     One case in which convergence is guaranteed is when X is a Banach space and | T | ' be an invertible operator and let T : B → B ' be another operator. If | S – T | −1| −1 , then T is also invertible. This follows by writing T as      T  =   S   (   Id  -   (   Id  -    S   -  1    T    )    )        T    S    Id    Id     superscript  S    1    T        T=S(\mathrm{Id}-(\mathrm{Id}-S^{-1}T))\,   and applying the result in the previous section on the second factor. The norm of T −1 can be bounded by         |   T   -  1    |   ≤      1   1  -  q      |   S   -  1    |    where     q  =    |   S  -  T   |    |   S   -  1    |      .     formulae-sequence       superscript  T    1          1    1  q       superscript  S    1      where      q        S  T       superscript  S    1         |T^{-1}|\leq\tfrac{1}{1-q}|S^{-1}|\quad\text{where}\quad q=|S-T|\,|S^{-1}|.
