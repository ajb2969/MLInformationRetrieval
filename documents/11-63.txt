Citrate—CoA ligase




Citrate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a citrate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + citrate + CoA 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + (3S)-citryl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, citrate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and (3S)-citryl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is citrate:CoA ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include citryl-CoA synthetase, citrate:CoA ligase, and citrate thiokinase. This enzyme participates in citric acid cycle.
