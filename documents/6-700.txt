   Simple set      Simple set   In recursion theory a subset of the natural numbers is called a simple set if it is co-infinite and recursively enumerable , but every infinite subset of its complement fails to be enumerated recursively. Simple sets are examples of recursively enumerable sets that are not recursive .  Relation to Post's problem  Simple sets were devised by Emil Leon Post in the search for a non-Turing-complete recursively enumerable set. Whether such sets exist is known as Post's problem . Post had to prove two things in order to obtain his result, one is that the simple set, say A , does not Turing-reduce to the empty set, and that the K , the halting problem , does not Turing-reduce to A . He succeeded in the first part (which is obvious by definition), but for the other part, he managed only to prove a many-one reduction .  It was affirmed by Friedberg and Muchnik in the 1950s using a novel technique called the priority method . They give a construction for a set that is simple (and thus non-recursive), but fails to compute the halting problem. 1  Formal definitions and some properties   A set    I  ⊆  ℕ      I  ℕ    I\subseteq\mathbb{N}   is called immune if   I   I   I   is infinite, but for every index   e   e   e   , we have      W  e   infinite   ⟹   W  e   ⊈  I           subscript  W  e   infinite    subscript  W  e     not-subset-of-or-equals    I     W_{e}\text{ infinite}\implies W_{e}\not\subseteq I   . Or equivalently: there is no infinite subset of   I   I   I   that is recursively enumerable.  A set    S  ⊆  ℕ      S  ℕ    S\subseteq\mathbb{N}   is called ''' simple ''' if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is immune.  A set    I  ⊆  ℕ      I  ℕ    I\subseteq\mathbb{N}   is called effectively immune if   I   I   I   is infinite, but there exists a recursive function   f   f   f   such that for every index   e   e   e   , we have that     W  e   ⊆  I  ⟹   #   (   W  e   )    <   f   (  e  )           subscript  W  e   I         normal-#   subscript  W  e           f  e      W_{e}\subseteq I\implies\#(W_{e})   .  A set    S  ⊆  ℕ      S  ℕ    S\subseteq\mathbb{N}   is called effectively simple if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is effectively immune. Every effectively simple set, is simple and Turing-complete.  A set    I  ⊆  ℕ      I  ℕ    I\subseteq\mathbb{N}   is called hyperimmune if   I   I   I   is infinite, but    p  I     subscript  p  I    p_{I}   is not computably dominated, where    p  I     subscript  p  I    p_{I}   is the list of members of   I   I   I   in order. 2  A set    S  ⊆  ℕ      S  ℕ    S\subseteq\mathbb{N}   is called hypersimple if it is simple and its complement is hyperimmune. 3   Notes  References       "  Category:Computability theory     Nies (2009) p.35 ↩  Nies (2009) p.27 ↩  Nies (2009) p.37 ↩
