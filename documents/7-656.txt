Commutativity of conjunction

In propositional logic, the commutativity of conjunction is a valid argument form and truth-functional tautology. It is considered to be a law of classical logic. It is the principle that the conjuncts of a logical conjunction may switch places with each other, while preserving the truth-value of the resulting proposition.1
Formal notation
Commutativity of conjunction can be expressed in sequent notation as:



and



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
 , in the one case, and 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
  in the other, in some logical system;
or in rule form:



and



where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "
 
 
 
 " and wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "
 
 
 
 ";
or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:



and



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
Generalized principle
For any propositions H1, H2, ... Hn, and permutation σ(n) of the numbers 1 through n, it is the case that:

H1

 
  H2

 
  ... 
 
 
 
  Hn


is equivalent to

Hσ(1)

 
  Hσ(2)

 
  Hσ(n).
 

For example, if H1 is

It is raining


H2 is

Socrates is mortal


and H3 is

2+2=4


then
It is raining and Socrates is mortal and 2+2=4
is equivalent to
Socrates is mortal and 2+2=4 and it is raining
and the other orderings of the predicates.
