   Commutativity of conjunction      Commutativity of conjunction   In propositional logic , the commutativity of conjunction is a valid  argument form and truth-functional tautology . It is considered to be a law of classical logic . It is the principle that the conjuncts of a logical conjunction may switch places with each other, while preserving the truth-value of the resulting proposition. 1  Formal notation  Commutativity of conjunction can be expressed in sequent notation as:       (   P  and  Q   )   ⊢   (   Q  and  P   )      proves    P  italic- and  Q     Q  italic- and  P     (P\and Q)\vdash(Q\and P)     and       (   Q  and  P   )   ⊢   (   P  and  Q   )      proves    Q  italic- and  P     P  italic- and  Q     (Q\and P)\vdash(P\and Q)     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    (   Q  and  P   )      Q  italic- and  P    (Q\and P)   is a syntactic consequence of    (   P  and  Q   )      P  italic- and  Q    (P\and Q)   , in the one case, and    (   P  and  Q   )      P  italic- and  Q    (P\and Q)   is a syntactic consequence of    (   Q  and  P   )      Q  italic- and  P    (Q\and P)   in the other, in some logical system ;  or in rule form :       P  and  Q     ∴   Q  and  P          P  italic- and  Q    therefore  absent    Q  italic- and  P      \frac{P\and Q}{\therefore Q\and P}     and       Q  and  P     ∴   P  and  Q          Q  italic- and  P    therefore  absent    P  italic- and  Q      \frac{Q\and P}{\therefore P\and Q}     where the rule is that wherever an instance of "    (   P  and  Q   )      P  italic- and  Q    (P\and Q)   " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "    (   Q  and  P   )      Q  italic- and  P    (Q\and P)   " and wherever an instance of "    (   Q  and  P   )      Q  italic- and  P    (Q\and P)   " appears on a line of a proof, it can be replaced with "    (   P  and  Q   )      P  italic- and  Q    (P\and Q)   ";  or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:       (   P  and  Q   )   →   (   Q  and  P   )      normal-→    P  italic- and  Q     Q  italic- and  P     (P\and Q)\to(Q\and P)     and       (   Q  and  P   )   →   (   P  and  Q   )      normal-→    Q  italic- and  P     P  italic- and  Q     (Q\and P)\to(P\and Q)     where   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are propositions expressed in some formal system.  Generalized principle  For any propositions H 1 , H 2 , ... H n , and permutation σ(n) of the numbers 1 through n, it is the case that:   H 1    ∧     \land   H 2    ∧     \land   ...   ∧     \land   H n    is equivalent to   H σ(1)    ∧     \land   H σ(2)    ∧     \land   H σ(n) .   For example, if H 1 is   It is raining    H 2 is   Socrates is mortal    and H 3 is   2+2=4    then  It is raining and Socrates is mortal and 2+2=4  is equivalent to  Socrates is mortal and 2+2=4 and it is raining  and the other orderings of the predicates.
