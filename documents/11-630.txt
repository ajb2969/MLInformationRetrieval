   NMN nucleosidase      NMN nucleosidase   In enzymology , a NMN nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribose 5-phosphate + nicotinamide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-ribose 5-phosphate and nicotinamide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nicotinamide-nucleotide phosphoribohydrolase . Other names in common use include NMNase , nicotinamide mononucleotide nucleosidase , nicotinamide mononucleotidase , NMN glycohydrolase , and NMNGhase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.2.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
