   Flavonol-3-O-glycoside xylosyltransferase      Flavonol-3-O-glycoside xylosyltransferase   In enzymology , a flavonol-3-O-glycoside xylosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-xylose + a flavonol 3-O-glycoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + a flavonol 3-[-D-xylosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glycoside]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-xylose and flavonol 3-O-glycoside , whereas its two products are UDP and flavonol 3-[-D-xylosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glycoside ].  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 'UDP-D-xylose:flavonol-3-O-glycoside 2 -O-beta-D-xylosyltransferase'''.  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
