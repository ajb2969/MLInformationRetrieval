   Licodione synthase      Licodione synthase   In enzymology , a licodione synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   liquiritigenin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   licodione + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are liquiritigenin , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are licodione , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is liquiritigenin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (licodione-forming) .
