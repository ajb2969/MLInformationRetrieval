   Complex affine space      Complex affine space   In mathematics , n -dimensional complex space is a multi-dimensional generalisation of the complex numbers , which have both real and imaginary parts or dimensions. The n -dimensional complex space can be seen as n  cartesian products of the complex numbers with itself:        \C   n   =      \C   ×   \C   ×  ⋯  ×   \C    ⏟    n  -times         superscript  \C  n    subscript   normal-⏟    \C  \C  normal-⋯  \C      n  -times      \C^{n}=\underbrace{\C\times\C\times\cdots\times\C}_{n\text{-times}}   The n -dimensional complex space consists of ordered n -tuples of complex numbers, called coordinates :        \C   n   =   {   (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n   )   :    z  i   ∈    \C   for all  1   ≤  i  ≤  n   }        superscript  \C  n    conditional-set    subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n         subscript  z  i     \C  for all  1        i       n       \C^{n}=\{(z_{1},\ldots,z_{n}):z_{i}\in\C\text{ for all }1\leq i\leq n\}     The real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be treated as separate dimensions. With this interpretation, the space     \C   n     superscript  \C  n    \C^{n}   of n complex numbers can be seen as having    2  ×  n      2  n    2\times n   dimensions represented by    2  ×  n      2  n    2\times n   -tuples of real numbers. The two different interpretations can cause confusion about the dimension of a complex space.  The study of complex spaces, or complex manifolds , is called complex geometry .  One dimension  The complex line      \C   1     superscript  \C  1    \C^{1}   has one real and one imaginary dimension. It is analogous in some ways to two-dimensional real space, and may be represented as an Argand diagram in the real plane.  In projective geometry , the complex projective line includes a point at infinity in the Argand diagram and is an example of a Riemann sphere .  Two dimensions  The term "complex plane" can be confusing. It is sometimes used to denote     \C   2     superscript  \C  2    \C^{2}   , and sometimes to denote the     \C   1     superscript  \C  1    \C^{1}   space represented in the Argand diagram (with the Riemann sphere referred to as the "extended complex plane"). In the present context of     \C   n     superscript  \C  n    \C^{n}   , it is understood to denote     \C   2     superscript  \C  2    \C^{2}   .  An intuitive understanding of the complex projective plane is given by Edwards (2003), which he attributes to Von Staudt .
