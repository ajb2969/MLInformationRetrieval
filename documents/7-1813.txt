Complex affine space

In mathematics, n-dimensional complex space is a multi-dimensional generalisation of the complex numbers, which have both real and imaginary parts or dimensions. The n-dimensional complex space can be seen as n cartesian products of the complex numbers with itself:


 
  The n-dimensional complex space consists of ordered n-tuples of complex numbers, called coordinates:



The real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be treated as separate dimensions. With this interpretation, the space 
 
 
 
  of n complex numbers can be seen as having 
 
 
 
  dimensions represented by 
 
 
 
 -tuples of real numbers. The two different interpretations can cause confusion about the dimension of a complex space.
The study of complex spaces, or complex manifolds, is called complex geometry.
One dimension
The complex line

 
  has one real and one imaginary dimension. It is analogous in some ways to two-dimensional real space, and may be represented as an Argand diagram in the real plane.
In projective geometry, the complex projective line includes a point at infinity in the Argand diagram and is an example of a Riemann sphere.
Two dimensions
The term "complex plane" can be confusing. It is sometimes used to denote 
 
 
 
 , and sometimes to denote the 
 
 
 
  space represented in the Argand diagram (with the Riemann sphere referred to as the "extended complex plane"). In the present context of 
 
 
 
 , it is understood to denote 
 
 
 
 .
An intuitive understanding of the complex projective plane is given by Edwards (2003), which he attributes to Von Staudt.
