Beta-alanine—pyruvate transaminase




Beta-alanine—pyruvate transaminase

In enzymology, a beta-alanine-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-alanine + 3-oxopropanoate 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + beta-alanine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-alanine and 3-oxopropanoate, whereas its two products are pyruvate and beta-alanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-alanine:3-oxopropanoate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include beta-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase, and beta-alanine-alpha-alanine transaminase. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: alanine and aspartate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, and propanoate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
