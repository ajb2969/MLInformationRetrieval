   Fritz Carlson      Fritz Carlson   Fritz David Carlson (23 July 1888 – 28 November 1952) was a Swedish  mathematician . 1 After the death of Torsten Carleman , he headed the Mittag-Leffler Institute .  Carlson's contributions to analysis include Carlson's theorem , the Polyá–Carlson theorem on rational functions, and Carlson's inequality         (    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   a  n   |    )   4   ≤    π  2     ∑   n  =  1   ∞       |   a  n   |   2      ∑   n  =  1   ∞     n  2      |   a  n   |   2          .       superscript    superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n     4      superscript  π  2     superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript     subscript  a  n    2     superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript  n  2    superscript     subscript  a  n    2          \left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_{n}|\right)^{4}\leq\pi^{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_{n%
 }|^{2}\,\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n^{2}|a_{n}|^{2}~{}.     In number theory , his results include Carlson's theorem on Dirichlet series .  Hans Rådström , Germund Dahlquist , and Tord Ganelius were among his students.
