   Ostrowski numeration      Ostrowski numeration   In mathematics, Ostrowski numeration , named after Alexander Ostrowski , is either of two related numeration systems based on continued fractions : a non-standard positional numeral system for integers and a non-integer representation of real numbers .  Fix a positive irrational number  α with continued fraction expansion [ a 1 , a 2 ,...]. Let ( q n ) be the sequence of denominators of the convergents p n / q n to α: so q n = a n q n −1 + q n −2 . Let α n denote T n ( α ) where T is the Gauss map T ( x ) = {1/ x }, and write β n = (−1) n +1  α 0 α 1 ... α n : we have β n = a n β n −1 + β n −2 .  Real number representations  Every positive real x can be written as      x  =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     b  n    β  n         x    superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  b  n    subscript  β  n       x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}\beta_{n}     where the integer coefficients 0 ≤ b n ≤ a n and if b n = a n then b n −1 = 0.  Integer representations  Every positive integer N can be written uniquely as      N  =    ∑   n  =  1   k     b  n    q  n         N    superscript   subscript     n  1    k      subscript  b  n    subscript  q  n       N=\sum_{n=1}^{k}b_{n}q_{n}     where the integer coefficients 0 ≤ b n ≤ a n and if b n = a n then b n −1 = 0.  If α is the golden ratio , then all the partial quotients a n are equal to 1, the denominators q n are the Fibonacci numbers and we recover Zeckendorf's theorem on the Fibonacci representation of positive integers as a sum of distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
