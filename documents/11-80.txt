Glutamate—ethylamine ligase




Glutamate—ethylamine ligase

In enzymology, a glutamate-ethylamine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-glutamate + ethylamine 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + N5-ethyl-L-glutamine
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-glutamate, and ethylamine, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and N5-ethyl-L-glutamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-ammonia (or amine) ligases (amide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:ethylamine ligase (ADP-forming). Other names in common use include N5-ethyl-L-glutamine synthetase, theanine synthetase, and N5-ethylglutamine synthetase.
