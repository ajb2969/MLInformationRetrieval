   Stella octangula number      Stella octangula number   In mathematics, a stella octangula number is a figurate number based on the stella octangula , of the form n (2 n 2 − 1). 1 2  The sequence of stella octangula numbers begins   0, 1, 14, 51, 124, 245, 426, 679, 1016, 1449, 1990, .... 3    Ljunggren's equation  There are only two positive square stella octangula numbers, 1 and 9653449 = 3107 2 = (13 × 239) 2 , corresponding to n = 1 and n = 169 respectively. 4 5 The elliptic curve describing the square stella octangula numbers,       m  2   =   n   (    2   n  2    -  1   )         superscript  m  2     n      2   superscript  n  2    1      m^{2}=n(2n^{2}-1)   may be placed in the equivalent Weierstrass form       x  2   =    y  3   -   2  y         superscript  x  2      superscript  y  3     2  y      x^{2}=y^{3}-2y   by the change of variables x = 2 m , y = 2 n . Because the two factors n and 2 n 2 − 1 of the square number m 2 are relatively prime , they must each be squares themselves, and the second change of variables    X  =   m  /   n        X    m    n      X=m/\sqrt{n}   and    Y  =   n       Y    n     Y=\sqrt{n}   leads to Ljunggren's equation       X  2   =    2   Y  4    -  1        superscript  X  2       2   superscript  Y  4    1     X^{2}=2Y^{4}-1    6  A theorem of Siegel states that every elliptic curve has only finitely many integer solutions, and  found a difficult proof that the only integer solutions to his equation were (1,1) and (239,13), corresponding to the two square stella octangula numbers. 7  Louis J. Mordell conjectured that the proof could be simplified, and several later authors published simplifications. 8 9 10  References  External links     "  Category:Figurate numbers     . ↩  . ↩    . ↩   . ↩   . ↩  . ↩
