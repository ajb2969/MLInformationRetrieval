Stella octangula number

 In mathematics, a stella octangula number is a figurate number based on the stella octangula, of the form n(2n2 − 1).12
The sequence of stella octangula numbers begins

0, 1, 14, 51, 124, 245, 426, 679, 1016, 1449, 1990, ....3


Ljunggren's equation
There are only two positive square stella octangula numbers, 1 and 9653449 = 31072 = (13 × 239)2, corresponding to n = 1 and n = 169 respectively.45 The elliptic curve describing the square stella octangula numbers,


 
  may be placed in the equivalent Weierstrass form


 
  by the change of variables x = 2m, y = 2n. Because the two factors n and 2n2 − 1 of the square number m2 are relatively prime, they must each be squares themselves, and the second change of variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  leads to Ljunggren's equation

A theorem of Siegel states that every elliptic curve has only finitely many integer solutions, and  found a difficult proof that the only integer solutions to his equation were (1,1) and (239,13), corresponding to the two square stella octangula numbers.7 Louis J. Mordell conjectured that the proof could be simplified, and several later authors published simplifications.8910
