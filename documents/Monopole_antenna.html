<h1>Monopole antenna</h1>
<hr/>

<p> A <strong>monopole antenna</strong> is a class of <a href="radio_antenna" title="wikilink">radio antenna</a> consisting of a straight <a href="Rod_(geometry)" title="wikilink">rod</a>-shaped conductor, often mounted perpendicularly over some type of <a href="Electrical_conductor" title="wikilink">conductive</a> surface, called a <em><a href="ground_plane" title="wikilink">ground plane</a></em>. The driving signal from the <a class="uri" href="transmitter" title="wikilink">transmitter</a> is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the <a href="radio_receiver" title="wikilink">receiver</a> is taken, between the lower end of the monopole and the ground plane. One side of the antenna <a class="uri" href="feedline" title="wikilink">feedline</a> is attached to the lower end of the monopole, and the other side is attached to the ground plane, which is often the Earth. This contrasts with a <a href="dipole_antenna" title="wikilink">dipole antenna</a> which consists of two identical rod conductors, with the signal from the transmitter applied between the two halves of the antenna.</p>

<p>The monopole is a <a class="uri" href="resonant" title="wikilink">resonant</a> antenna; the rod functions as a <a class="uri" href="resonator" title="wikilink">resonator</a> for radio waves, with oscillating <a href="standing_wave" title="wikilink">standing waves</a> of voltage and current along its length. Therefore the length of the antenna is determined by the <a class="uri" href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelength</a> of the radio waves it is used with. The most common form is the <em>quarter-wave monopole</em>, in which the antenna is approximately 1/4 of a wavelength of the radio waves.</p>

<p>The monopole antenna was invented in 1895 by radio pioneer <a href="Guglielmo_Marconi" title="wikilink">Guglielmo Marconi</a>, who discovered if he attached one terminal of his transmitter to a long wire suspended in the air and the other to the Earth, he could transmit for longer distances. For this reason it is sometimes called a <em>Marconi antenna</em>, although <a href="Alexander_Stepanovich_Popov" title="wikilink">Alexander Popov</a> independently invented it at about the same time. Common types of monopole antenna are the <a href="whip_antenna" title="wikilink">whip</a>, <a href="Rubber_Ducky_antenna" title="wikilink">rubber ducky</a>, <a href="helical_antenna" title="wikilink">helical</a>, <a href="Random_wire_antenna" title="wikilink">random wire</a>, <a href="umbrella_antenna" title="wikilink">umbrella</a>, inverted-L and <a class="uri" href="T-antenna" title="wikilink">T-antenna</a>, <a href="mast_radiator" title="wikilink">mast radiator</a>, and <a href="whip_antenna" title="wikilink">ground plane</a> antennas.</p>
<h2 id="radiation-pattern">Radiation pattern</h2>

<p>Like a <a href="dipole_antenna" title="wikilink">dipole antenna</a>, a monopole has an <a href="Omnidirectional_antenna" title="wikilink">omnidirectional</a> <a href="radiation_pattern" title="wikilink">radiation pattern</a>. That is it radiates equal power in all azimuthal directions perpendicular to the antenna, but the radiated power varies with elevation angle, with the radiation dropping off to zero at the zenith, on the antenna axis. It radiates <a href="Vertical_polarization" title="wikilink">vertically polarized</a> radio waves.</p>

<p><a href="Image:Monopole_and_image_antenna.svg" title="wikilink">thumb|upright=1.5|Showing the monopole antenna has the same radiation pattern over perfect ground as a dipole in free space with twice the voltage</a></p>

<p>A monopole can be visualized <em>(right)</em> as being formed by replacing the bottom half of a vertical <a href="dipole_antenna" title="wikilink">dipole antenna</a> <em>(c)</em> with a conducting plane (<a href="ground_plane" title="wikilink">ground plane</a>) at right-angles to the remaining half. If the ground plane is large enough, the radio waves from the remaining upper half of the dipole <em>(a)</em> reflected from the ground plane will seem to come from an <a href="image_antenna" title="wikilink">image antenna</a> <em>(b)</em> forming the missing half of the dipole, which adds to the direct radiation to form a dipole radiation pattern. So the pattern of a monopole with a perfectly conducting, infinite ground plane is identical to the top half of a dipole pattern, with its maximum radiation in the horizontal direction, perpendicular to the antenna. Because it radiates only into the space above the ground plane, or half the space of a dipole antenna, a monopole antenna will have a <a href="antenna_gain" title="wikilink">gain</a> of twice (3 <a href="decibel" title="wikilink">dB</a> over) the gain of a similar dipole antenna, and a <a href="radiation_resistance" title="wikilink">radiation resistance</a> half that of a dipole. Thus a quarter-wave monopole, the most common type, will have a gain of 5.19 dBi and a radiation resistance of about 36.8 ohms if it is mounted above a good ground plane.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The general effect of electrically small ground planes, as well as imperfectly conducting earth grounds, is to tilt the direction of maximum radiation up to higher elevation angles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>

<p> The ground plane used with a monopole may be the actual earth; in this case the antenna is mounted on the ground and one side of the feedline is connected to an earth <a href="ground_(electricity)" title="wikilink">ground</a> at the base of the antenna. This design is used for the <a href="mast_radiator" title="wikilink">mast radiator</a> antennas employed in <a href="radio_broadcasting" title="wikilink">radio broadcasting</a> at low <a href="Frequency" title="wikilink">frequencies</a>, as well as other low frequency antennas such as the <a class="uri" href="T-antenna" title="wikilink">T-antenna</a> and <a href="umbrella_antenna" title="wikilink">umbrella antenna</a>. At <a href="Very_high_frequency" title="wikilink">VHF</a> and <a href="Ultrahigh_frequency" title="wikilink">UHF</a> frequencies the size of the ground plane needed is smaller, so artificial ground planes are used to allow the antenna to be mounted above the ground. A common type of monopole antenna at these frequencies consists of a quarter-wave <a href="whip_antenna" title="wikilink">whip antenna</a> with a ground plane consisting of several wires or rods radiating horizontally or diagonally from its base; this is called a <strong>ground-plane antenna</strong>. At <a class="uri" href="gigahertz" title="wikilink">gigahertz</a> frequencies the metal surface of a car roof or airplane body makes a good ground plane, so car <a href="cell_phone" title="wikilink">cell phone</a> antennas consist of short whips mounted on the roof, and aircraft communication antennas frequently consist of a short conductor in an aerodynamic <a href="fairing_(aircraft)" title="wikilink">fairing</a> projecting from the fuselage; this is called a <em>blade antenna</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The quarter-wave whip and "<a href="Rubber_Ducky_antenna" title="wikilink">Rubber Ducky</a>" antennas used with handheld radios such as <a href="walkie-talkie" title="wikilink">walkie-talkies</a> and <a href="cell_phone" title="wikilink">cell phones</a> are also monopole antennas. These don't use a ground plane, and the ground side of the transmitter is just connected to the ground connection on its circuit board. The hand and body of the person holding them may function as a rudimentary ground plane.</p>

<h2 id="monopole-broadcasting-antennas">Monopole broadcasting antennas</h2>

<p>When used for radio broadcasting, the radio frequency power from the broadcasting transmitter is fed across the base insulator between the tower and a ground system. The ideal ground system for <a href="AM_broadcasting" title="wikilink">AM</a> broadcasters comprises at least 120 buried <a class="uri" href="copper" title="wikilink">copper</a> or <a href="phosphor_bronze" title="wikilink">phosphor bronze</a> radial wires at least one-quarter wavelength long and a ground-screen in the immediate vicinity of the tower. All the ground system components are bonded together, usually by <a class="uri" href="welding" title="wikilink">welding</a>, <a class="uri" href="brazing" title="wikilink">brazing</a> or using <a href="coin_silver" title="wikilink">coin silver</a> solder to help reduce corrosion. Monopole antennas that use <a href="guy-wire" title="wikilink">guy-wires</a> for support are called masts in some countries. In the United States, the term “mast” is generally used to describe a pipe supporting a smaller antenna, so both self-supporting and guy-wire supported radio antennas are simply called monopoles if they stand alone. If multiple monopole antennas are used in order to control the direction of <a href="Radio_Frequency" title="wikilink">radio frequency</a> (RF) propagation, they are called <a href="directional_antenna" title="wikilink">directional antenna</a> arrays.</p>

<p>In the United States, the <a href="Federal_Communications_Commission" title="wikilink">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) requires that the transmitter power input to the antenna be measured and maintained. The power input is calculated as the square of the measured current,

<p>This impedance is periodically measured to verify the stability of the antenna and ground system. Normally, an <a href="impedance_matching" title="wikilink">impedance matching</a> network matches the impedance of the antenna to the impedance of the <a href="transmission_line" title="wikilink">transmission line</a> feeding it.</p>

<p>Monopole antennas have become one of the components of mobile and internet networks across the globe. Their relative low cost and fast installation makes them an obvious choice for developing countries.</p>
