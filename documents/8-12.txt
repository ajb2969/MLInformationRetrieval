Siegel–Walfisz theorem

In analytic number theory, the Siegel–Walfisz theorem was obtained by Arnold Walfisz1 as an application of a theorem by Carl Ludwig Siegel2 to primes in arithmetic progressions.
Statement
Define



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the von Mangoldt function and φ to be Euler's totient function.
Then the theorem states that given any real number N there exists a positive constant CN depending only on N such that



whenever (a, q) = 1 and



Remarks
The constant CN is not effectively computable because Siegel's theorem is ineffective.
From the theorem we can deduce the following form of the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions: If, for (a,q)=1, by 
 
 
 
  we denote the number of primes less than or equal to x which are congruent to a mod q, then


 
  where N, a, q, CN and φ are as in the theorem, and Li denotes the offset logarithmic integral.
