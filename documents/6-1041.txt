   Hyperbolic set      Hyperbolic set   In dynamical systems theory , a subset Λ of a smooth manifold  M is said to have a hyperbolic structure with respect to a smooth map  f if its tangent bundle may be split into two invariant subbundles , one of which is contracting and the other is expanding under f , with respect to some Riemannian metric on M . An analogous definition applies to the case of flows .  In the special case when the entire manifold M is hyperbolic, the map f is called an Anosov diffeomorphism . The dynamics of f on a hyperbolic set, or hyperbolic dynamics , exhibits features of local structural stability and has been much studied, cf. Axiom A .  Definition  Let M be a compact  smooth manifold , f : M → M a diffeomorphism , and Df : TM → TM the differential of f . An f -invariant subset Λ of M is said to be hyperbolic , or to have a hyperbolic structure , if the restriction to Λ of the tangent bundle of M admits a splitting into a Whitney sum of two Df -invariant subbundles, called the stable bundle and the unstable bundle and denoted E s and E u . With respect to some Riemannian metric on M , the restriction of Df to E s must be a contraction and the restriction of Df to E u must be an expansion. Thus, there exist constants 00 such that        T  Λ   M   =    E  s   ⊕   E  u           subscript  T  normal-Λ   M    direct-sum   superscript  E  s    superscript  E  u      T_{\Lambda}M=E^{s}\oplus E^{u}     and         (   D  f   )   x    E  x  s    =   E   f   (  x  )    s          subscript    D  f   x    subscript   superscript  E  s   x     subscript   superscript  E  s     f  x      (Df)_{x}E^{s}_{x}=E^{s}_{f(x)}   and       (   D  f   )   x    E  x  u    =   E   f   (  x  )    u          subscript    D  f   x    subscript   superscript  E  u   x     subscript   superscript  E  u     f  x      (Df)_{x}E^{u}_{x}=E^{u}_{f(x)}   for all    x  ∈  Λ      x  normal-Λ    x\in\Lambda     and       ∥   D   f  n   v   ∥   ≤   c   λ  n    ∥  v  ∥         norm    D   superscript  f  n   v      c   superscript  λ  n    norm  v      \|Df^{n}v\|\leq c\lambda^{n}\|v\|   for all    v  ∈   E  s       v   superscript  E  s     v\in E^{s}   and    n  >  0      n  0    n>0     and       ∥   D   f   -  n    v   ∥   ≤   c   λ  n    ∥  v  ∥         norm    D   superscript  f    n    v      c   superscript  λ  n    norm  v      \|Df^{-n}v\|\leq c\lambda^{n}\|v\|   for all    v  ∈   E  u       v   superscript  E  u     v\in E^{u}   and    n  >  0      n  0    n>0   .  If Λ is hyperbolic then there exists a Riemannian metric for which c = 1 — such a metric is called adapted .  Examples   Hyperbolic equilibrium point  p is a fixed point , or equilibrium point, of f , such that ( Df ) p has no eigenvalue with absolute value 1. In this case, Λ = { p }.  More generally, a periodic orbit of f with period n is hyperbolic if and only if Df n at any point of the orbit has no eigenvalue with absolute value 1, and it is enough to check this condition at a single point of the orbit.
