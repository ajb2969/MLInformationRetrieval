D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase




D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase

In enzymology, a D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CTP + D-ribitol 5-phosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + CDP-ribitol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and D-ribitol 5-phosphate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and CDP-ribitol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. Other names in common use include CDP ribitol pyrophosphorylase, cytidine diphosphate ribitol pyrophosphorylase, ribitol 5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, and cytidine diphosphoribitol pyrophosphorylase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
