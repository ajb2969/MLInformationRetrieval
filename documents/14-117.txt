   Zariski ring      Zariski ring   In commutative algebra , a Zariski ring is a commutative Noetherian topological ring A whose topology is defined by an ideal m contained in the Jacobson radical , the intersection of all maximal ideals. They were introduced by  under the name "semi-local ring" which now means something different, and named "Zariski rings" by . Examples of Zariski rings are noetherian local rings and   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   -adic completions of noetherian rings.  Let A be a noetherian ring and    A  ^     normal-^  A    \widehat{A}   its   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   -adic completion. Then the following are equivalent.       A  ^     normal-^  A    \widehat{A}   is faithfully flat over A (in general, only flat over it).  Every maximal ideal is closed for the   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   -adic topology.  A is a Zariski ring.   References   M. Atiyah, I.
