Stably free module

In mathematics, a stably free module is a module which is close to being free.
Definition
A finitely generated module M over a ring R is stably free if there exist free finitely generated modules F and G over R such that
$$M \oplus F = G . \,$$
Properties

A projective module is stably free if and only if it possesses a finite free resolution (Theorem XXI.2.1 of Lang's Algebra).
An infinitely generated module is stably free if and only if it is free.
