   List of probability distributions      List of probability distributions   Many probability distributions are so important in theory or applications that they have been given specific names.  Discrete distributions    With finite support   The Bernoulli distribution , which takes value 1 with probability p and value 0 with probability q = 1 − p .  The Rademacher distribution , which takes value 1 with probability 1/2 and value −1 with probability 1/2.  The binomial distribution , which describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments all with the same probability of success.  The beta-binomial distribution , which describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments with heterogeneity in the success probability.  The degenerate distribution at x 0 , where X is certain to take the value x 0 . This does not look random, but it satisfies the definition of random variable . This is useful because it puts deterministic variables and random variables in the same formalism.  The discrete uniform distribution , where all elements of a finite set are equally likely. This is the theoretical distribution model for a balanced coin, an unbiased die, a casino roulette, or the first card of a well-shuffled deck.  The hypergeometric distribution , which describes the number of successes in the first m of a series of n consecutive Yes/No experiments, if the total number of successes is known. This distribution arises when there is no replacement.  The Poisson binomial distribution , which describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments with different success probabilities.  Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution  Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution  Benford's law , which describes the frequency of the first digit of many naturally occurring data.     With infinite support   The beta negative binomial distribution  The Boltzmann distribution , a discrete distribution important in statistical physics which describes the probabilities of the various discrete energy levels of a system in thermal equilibrium . It has a continuous analogue. Special cases include:  The Gibbs distribution  The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution   The Borel distribution  The extended negative binomial distribution  The extended hypergeometric distribution  The generalized log-series distribution  The geometric distribution , a discrete distribution which describes the number of attempts needed to get the first success in a series of independent Yes/No experiments, or alternatively only the number of losses before the first success (i.e. one less).  The logarithmic (series) distribution  The negative binomial distribution or Pascal distribution a generalization of the geometric distribution to the n th success.  The parabolic fractal distribution  The Poisson distribution , which describes a very large number of individually unlikely events that happen in a certain time interval. Related to this distributions are a number of other distributions: the displaced Poisson , the hyper-Poisson, the general Poisson binomial and the Poisson type distributions.  The Conway–Maxwell–Poisson distribution , a two-parameter extension of the Poisson distribution with an adjustable rate of decay.  The Zero-truncated Poisson distribution , for processes in which zero counts are not observed   The Polya–Eggenberger distribution  The Skellam distribution , the distribution of the difference between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables.  The skew elliptical distribution  The Yule–Simon distribution  The zeta distribution has uses in applied statistics and statistical mechanics, and perhaps may be of interest to number theorists. It is the Zipf distribution for an infinite number of elements.  Zipf's law or the Zipf distribution. A discrete power-law distribution, the most famous example of which is the description of the frequency of words in the English language.

The Logitnormal distribution on (0,1).  The Dirac delta function although not strictly a function, is a limiting form of many continuous probability functions. It represents a discrete probability distribution concentrated at 0 — a degenerate distribution — but the notation treats it as if it were a continuous distribution.  The continuous uniform distribution on [ a , b ], where all points in a finite interval are equally likely.  The rectangular distribution is a uniform distribution on [−1/2,1/2].   The Irwin–Hall distribution is the distribution of the sum of n i.i.d. U(0,1) random variables.  The Bates distribution is the distribution of the mean of n i.i.d. U(0,1) random variables.  The Kent distribution on the three-dimensional sphere.  The Kumaraswamy distribution is as versatile as the Beta distribution but has simple closed forms for both the cdf and the pdf.  The logarithmic distribution (continuous)  The Marchenko%E2%80%93Pastur distribution is important in the theory of random matrices .  The PERT distribution is a special case of the beta distribution  The raised cosine distribution on [     μ  -  s   ,   μ  +  s        μ  s     μ  s     \mu-s,\mu+s   ]  The reciprocal distribution  The triangular distribution on [ a , b ], a special case of which is the distribution of the sum of two independent uniformly distributed random variables (the convolution of two uniform distributions).  The trapezoidal distribution  The truncated normal distribution on [ a , b ].  The U-quadratic distribution on [ a , b ].  The von Mises distribution on the circle.
