   Methylamine—glutamate N-methyltransferase      Methylamine—glutamate N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a methylamine-glutamate N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methylamine + L-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NH 3 + N-methyl-L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methylamine and L- glutamate , whereas its two products are NH 3 and N-methyl-L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methylamine:L-glutamate N-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include N-methylglutamate synthase , and methylamine-glutamate methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in methane metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
