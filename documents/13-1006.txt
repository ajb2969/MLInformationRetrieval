Perfect digit-to-digit invariant

A perfect digit-to-digit invariant (PDDI) (also known as a Canouchi number1) is a natural number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to a power equal to the digit.



0 and 1 are PDDIs in any base (using the convention that 00 = 0). Apart from 0 and 1 there are only two other PDDIs in the decimal system, 3435 and 438579088 . Note that the second of these is only a PDDI under the convention that 00 = 0, but this is standard usage in this area.23


















More generally, there are finitely many PDDIs in any base. This can be proved as follows:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a base. Every PDDI 
 
 
 
  in base 
 
 
 
  is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to a power equal to the digit. This sum is less than or equal to 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the number of digits in 
 
 
 
 , because 
 
 
 
  is the largest possible digit in base 
 
 
 
 . Thus,
 
 



The expression 
 
 
 
  increases linearly with respect to 
 
 
 
 , whereas the expression 
 
 
 
  increases exponentially with respect to 
 
 
 
 . So there is some 
 
 
 
  such that
 
 :

There are finitely many natural numbers 
 
 
 
  with fewer than k digits, so there are finitely many natural numbers 
 
 
 
  satisfying the first inequality. Thus, there are only finitely many PDDIs in base 
 
 
 
 .
 

In base 2 the only PDDI is 1.
 In base 3 there are 3 PDDIs, namely 1, 12 and 22. (1, 5, 8 in decimals)
 In base 4 there are also 3 PDDIs, namely 1, 131 and 313. (1, 29, 55 in decimals)
 In base 5 there are none except for the trivial case 1.
 In base 6 there are 3 PDDIs, namely 1, 22352 and 23452. (1, 3164, 3416 in decimals)
 In base 7 there are 2 PDDIs, namely 1 and 13454. (1, 3665 in decimals)
 In base 8 there is again only the trivial case 1.
 In base 9 there are 4 PDDIs, namely 1, 31, 156262 and 1656547. (1, 28, 96446, 923362 in decimals)
