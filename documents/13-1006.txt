   Perfect digit-to-digit invariant      Perfect digit-to-digit invariant   A perfect digit-to-digit invariant (PDDI) (also known as a Canouchi number 1 ) is a natural number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to a power equal to the digit.       n  =    d  k   d  k    +   d   k  -  1    d   k  -  1     +  …  +   d  2   d  2    +    d  1   d  1       .      n     superscript   subscript  d  k    subscript  d  k     superscript   subscript  d    k  1     subscript  d    k  1     normal-…   superscript   subscript  d  2    subscript  d  2     superscript   subscript  d  1    subscript  d  1       n=d_{k}^{d_{k}}+d_{k-1}^{d_{k-1}}+\dots+d_{2}^{d_{2}}+d_{1}^{d_{1}}\,.     0 and 1 are PDDIs in any base (using the convention that 0 0 = 0). Apart from 0 and 1 there are only two other PDDIs in the decimal system, 3435 and 438579088 . Note that the second of these is only a PDDI under the convention that 0 0 = 0, but this is standard usage in this area. 2 3        3  3   +   4  4   +   3  3   +   5  5    =   27  +  256  +  27  +  3125   =  3435           superscript  3  3    superscript  4  4    superscript  3  3    superscript  5  5      27  256  27  3125        3435     3^{3}+4^{4}+3^{3}+5^{5}=27+256+27+3125=3435             4  4   +   3  3   +   8  8   +   5  5   +   7  7   +   9  9   +   0  0   +   8  8   +   8  8        superscript  4  4    superscript  3  3    superscript  8  8    superscript  5  5    superscript  7  7    superscript  9  9    superscript  0  0    superscript  8  8    superscript  8  8     4^{4}+3^{3}+8^{8}+5^{5}+7^{7}+9^{9}+0^{0}+8^{8}+8^{8}             =   256  +  27  +  16777216  +  3125  +  823543  +  387420489  +  0  +  16777216  +  16777216   =  438579088        absent    256  27  16777216  3125  823543  387420489  0  16777216  16777216        438579088     =256+27+16777216+3125+823543+387420489+0+16777216+16777216=438579088        More generally, there are finitely many PDDIs in any base . This can be proved as follows:   Let   b   b   b   be a base. Every PDDI   n   n   n   in base   b   b   b   is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to a power equal to the digit. This sum is less than or equal to    a    (   b  -  1   )    b  -  1        a   superscript    b  1     b  1      a(b-1)^{b-1}   , where   a   a   a   is the number of digits in   n   n   n   , because    b  -  1      b  1    b-1   is the largest possible digit in base   b   b   b   . Thus,       a    (   b  -  1   )    b  -  1     ≥  n  ≥   b   a  -  1     .          a   superscript    b  1     b  1     n        superscript  b    a  1       a(b-1)^{b-1}\geq n\geq b^{a-1}.      The expression    a    (   b  -  1   )    b  -  1        a   superscript    b  1     b  1      a(b-1)^{b-1}   increases linearly with respect to   a   a   a   , whereas the expression    b   a  -  1      superscript  b    a  1     b^{a-1}   increases exponentially with respect to   a   a   a   . So there is some    k  >  0      k  0    k>0   such that : \forall a\geq k,\,\, a(b-1)^{b-1}   There are finitely many natural numbers   n   n   n   with fewer than k digits, so there are finitely many natural numbers   n   n   n   satisfying the first inequality. Thus, there are only finitely many PDDIs in base   b   b   b   .   In base 2 the only PDDI is 1. In base 3 there are 3 PDDIs, namely 1, 12 and 22. (1, 5, 8 in decimals) In base 4 there are also 3 PDDIs, namely 1, 131 and 313. (1, 29, 55 in decimals) In base 5 there are none except for the trivial case 1. In base 6 there are 3 PDDIs, namely 1, 22352 and 23452. (1, 3164, 3416 in decimals) In base 7 there are 2 PDDIs, namely 1 and 13454. (1, 3665 in decimals) In base 8 there is again only the trivial case 1. In base 9 there are 4 PDDIs, namely 1, 31, 156262 and 1656547.
