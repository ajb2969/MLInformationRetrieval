   Bernstein's inequality (mathematical analysis)      Bernstein's inequality (mathematical analysis)   In mathematical analysis , Bernstein's inequality is named after Sergei Natanovich Bernstein . The inequality states that on the complex plane , within the disk of radius 1, the degree of a polynomial times the maximum value of a polynomial is an upper bound for the similar maximum of its derivative .  Theorem  Let P be a polynomial of degree   n   n   n   on complex numbers with derivative P′ . Then        max    |  z  |   ≤  1     (   |    P  ′    (  z  )    |   )    ≤   n  ⋅    max    |  z  |   ≤  1     (   |   P   (  z  )    |   )           subscript       z   1         superscript  P  normal-′   z      normal-⋅  n    subscript       z   1        P  z        \max_{|z|\leq 1}(|P^{\prime}(z)|)\leq n\cdot\max_{|z|\leq 1}(|P(z)|)     The inequality finds uses in the field of approximation theory .  Using the Bernstein's inequality we have for the k :th derivative,         max    |  z  |   ≤  1     (   |    P   (  k  )     (  z  )    |   )    ≤     n  !     (   n  -  k   )   !    ⋅    max    |  z  |   ≤  1     (   |   P   (  z  )    |   )      .        subscript       z   1         superscript  P  k   z      normal-⋅      n       n  k       subscript       z   1        P  z        \max_{|z|\leq 1}(|P^{(k)}(z)|)\leq\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\cdot\max_{|z|\leq 1}(|P(z)%
