Absorption (logic)




Absorption (logic)

Absorption is a valid argument form and rule of inference of propositional logic.12 The rule states that if 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The rule makes it possible to introduce conjunctions to proofs. It is called the law of absorption because the term 
 
 
 
  is "absorbed" by the term 
 
 
 
  in the consequent.3 The rule can be stated:



where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, "
 
 
 
 " can be placed on a subsequent line.
Formal notation
The absorption rule may be expressed as a sequent:



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequences of 
 
 
 
  in some logical system;
and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic. The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by Russell and Whitehead in Principia Mathematica as:



where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
Examples
If it will rain, then I will wear my coat.
 Therefore, if it will rain then it will rain and I will wear my coat.
