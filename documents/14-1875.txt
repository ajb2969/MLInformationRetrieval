   Absorption (logic)      Absorption (logic)   Absorption is a valid  argument form and rule of inference of propositional logic . 1 2 The rule states that if   P   P   P   implies   Q   Q   Q   , then   P   P   P   implies   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   . The rule makes it possible to introduce conjunctions to proofs . It is called the law of absorption because the term   Q   Q   Q   is "absorbed" by the term   P   P   P   in the consequent . 3 The rule can be stated:       P  →  Q     ∴   P  →   (   P  and  Q   )          normal-→  P  Q    therefore  absent   normal-→  P    P  italic- and  Q       \frac{P\to Q}{\therefore P\to(P\and Q)}     where the rule is that wherever an instance of "    P  →  Q     normal-→  P  Q    P\to Q   " appears on a line of a proof, "    P  →   (   P  and  Q   )      normal-→  P    P  italic- and  Q     P\to(P\and Q)   " can be placed on a subsequent line.  Formal notation  The absorption rule may be expressed as a sequent :       P  →  Q   ⊢   P  →   (   P  and  Q   )       proves   normal-→  P  Q    normal-→  P    P  italic- and  Q      P\to Q\vdash P\to(P\and Q)     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that    P  →   (   P  and  Q   )      normal-→  P    P  italic- and  Q     P\to(P\and Q)   is a syntactic consequences of    (   P  →  Q   )     normal-→  P  Q    (P\rightarrow Q)   in some logical system ;  and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic . The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by Russell and Whitehead in Principia Mathematica as:       (  P  →  Q  )   ↔   (  P  →   (  P  and  Q  )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   normal-↔   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  P  and  Q  normal-)   normal-)     (P\to Q)\leftrightarrow(P\to(P\and Q))     where   P   P   P   , and   Q   Q   Q   are propositions expressed in some formal system .  Examples  If it will rain, then I will wear my coat. Therefore, if it will rain then it will rain and I will wear my coat.  Proof by truth table      ''' '''        P   P   P\,\!
