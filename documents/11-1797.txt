Stone–Geary utility function

The Stone–Geary utility function takes the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is utility, 
 
 
 
  is consumption of good 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are parameters.
For 
 
 
 
 , the Stone-Geary function reduces to the generalised Cobb–Douglas function.
The Stone–Geary utility function gives rise to the Linear Expenditure System, in which the demand function equals


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is total expenditure, and 
 
 
 
  is the price of good 
 
 
 
 .
The Stone–Geary utility function was first derived by Roy C. Geary in a comment on earlier work by Lawrence Klein and Herman Rubin. Richard Stone was the first to estimate the Linear Expenditure System.
