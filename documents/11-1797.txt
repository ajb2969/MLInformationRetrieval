   Stone–Geary utility function      Stone–Geary utility function   The Stone–Geary utility function takes the form      U  =    ∏  i     (    q  i   -   γ  i    )    β  i         U    subscript  product  i    superscript     subscript  q  i    subscript  γ  i     subscript  β  i       U=\prod_{i}(q_{i}-\gamma_{i})^{\beta_{i}}   where   U   U   U   is utility ,    q  i     subscript  q  i    q_{i}   is consumption of good   i   i   i   , and   β   β   \beta   and   γ   γ   \gamma   are parameters.  For     γ  i   =  0       subscript  γ  i   0    \gamma_{i}=0   , the Stone-Geary function reduces to the generalised Cobb–Douglas function.  The Stone–Geary utility function gives rise to the Linear Expenditure System, in which the demand function equals       q  i   =    γ  i   +     β  i    p  i     (   y  -    ∑  j     γ  j    p  j      )          subscript  q  i      subscript  γ  i        subscript  β  i    subscript  p  i      y    subscript   j      subscript  γ  j    subscript  p  j          q_{i}=\gamma_{i}+\frac{\beta_{i}}{p_{i}}(y-\sum_{j}\gamma_{j}p_{j})   where   y   y   y   is total expenditure, and    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   is the price of good   i   i   i   .  The Stone–Geary utility function was first derived by Roy C. Geary in a comment on earlier work by Lawrence Klein and Herman Rubin . Richard Stone was the first to estimate the Linear Expenditure System.  Sources     "  Category:Utility
