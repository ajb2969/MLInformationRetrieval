   Leucocyanidin oxygenase      Leucocyanidin oxygenase   In enzymology , a leucocyanidin oxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   leucocyanidin + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cis- and trans-dihydroquercetins + succinate + CO 2 + 2 H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are leucocyanidin , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 5 products are cis-dihydroquercetin , trans-dihydroquercetin , succinate , CO 2 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is leucocyanidin,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) or anthocyanidin synthase (ANS). This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .  In a broader way, leucocyanidin oxygenase uses flavan-3,4-diols (leucoanthocyanidins) to produce 3-hydroxyanthocyanidins . 1 The gene encoding the enzyme (PpLDOX) has been identified in peach 2 and expression has been studied in Vitis vinifera . 3  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure , in Arabidopsis thaliana , has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
