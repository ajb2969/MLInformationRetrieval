   Moore plane      Moore plane   In mathematics , the Moore plane , also sometimes called Niemytzki plane (or Nemytskii plane , Nemytskii's tangent disk topology ), is a topological space . It is a completely regular Hausdorff space (also called Tychonoff space ) which is not normal . It is named after Robert Lee Moore and Viktor Vladimirovich Nemytskii .  Definition  If   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the upper half-plane    Γ  =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈    \R   2    |   y  ≥  0   }       normal-Γ   conditional-set     x  y    superscript  \R  2      y  0      \Gamma=\{(x,y)\in\R^{2}|y\geq 0\}   , then a topology may be defined on   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   by taking a local basis     ℬ   (  p  ,  q  )       ℬ   p  q     \mathcal{B}(p,q)   as follows:   Elements of the local basis at points    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   with    y  >  0      y  0    y>0   are the open discs in the plane which are small enough to lie within   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   . Thus the subspace topology inherited by    Γ  \   {   (  x  ,  0  )   |   x  ∈   \R    }      normal-\  normal-Γ   conditional-set   x  0     x  \R      \Gamma\backslash\{(x,0)|x\in\R\}   is the same as the subspace topology inherited from the standard topology of the Euclidean plane.    Elements of the local basis at points    p  =   (  x  ,  0  )       p   x  0     p=(x,0)   are sets     {  p  }   ∪  A       p   A    \{p\}\cup A   where A is an open disc in the upper half-plane which is tangent to the x axis at p .   That is, the local basis is given by       ℬ   (  p  ,  q  )    =   {       {     U  ϵ    (  p  ,  q  )    :=    {   (  x  ,  y  )   :      (   x  -  p   )   2   +    (   y  -  q   )   2    <   ϵ  2    }    ∣  ϵ  >   0    }   ,        if  q   >  0   ;         {     V  ϵ    (  p  )    :=    {   (  p  ,  0  )   }   ∪    {   (  x  ,  y  )   :      (   x  -  p   )   2   +    (   y  -  ϵ   )   2    <   ϵ  2    }    ∣  ϵ  >   0     }   ,       if  q   =  0.             ℬ   p  q     cases    assign     subscript  U  ϵ    p  q       conditional-set   x  y        superscript    x  p   2    superscript    y  q   2     superscript  ϵ  2      ket  ϵ   0         if  q   0     assign     subscript  V  ϵ   p       p  0       conditional-set   x  y        superscript    x  p   2    superscript    y  ϵ   2     superscript  ϵ  2      ket  ϵ   0          if  q   0.      \mathcal{B}(p,q)=\begin{cases}\{U_{\epsilon}(p,q):=\{(x,y):(x-p)^{2}+(y-q)^{2}%

The Moore plane is a completely regular Hausdorff space (i.e. Tychonoff space ), which is not normal .  The subspace    {    (  x  ,  0  )   ∈  Γ   |   x  ∈  R   }     conditional-set     x  0   normal-Γ     x  R     \{(x,0)\in\Gamma|x\in R\}   of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   has, as its subspace topology , the discrete topology . Thus, the Moore plane shows that a subspace of a separable space need not be separable.  The Moore plane is first countable , but not second countable or Lindelöf .  The Moore plane is not locally compact .  The Moore plane is countably metacompact but not metacompact .   Proof that the Moore plane is not normal  The fact that this space M is not normal can be established by the following counting argument (which is very similar to the argument that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal):   On the one hand, the countable set    S  :=   {    (  p  ,  q  )   ∈   ℚ  ×  ℚ    :   q  >  0   }      assign  S   conditional-set     p  q     ℚ  ℚ      q  0      S:=\{(p,q)\in\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}:q>0\}   of points with rational coordinates is dense in M ; hence every continuous function    f  :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  ℝ     f:M\to\mathbb{R}   is determined by its restriction to   S   S   S   , so there can be at most      |  ℝ  |    |  S  |    =   2   ℵ  0         superscript    ℝ     S     superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0      |\mathbb{R}|^{|S|}=2^{\aleph_{0}}   many continuous real-valued functions on M .  On the other hand, the real line    L  :=   {   (  p  ,  0  )   :   p  ∈  ℝ   }      assign  L   conditional-set   p  0     p  ℝ      L:=\{(p,0):p\in\mathbb{R}\}   is a closed discrete subspace of M with    2   ℵ  0      superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     2^{\aleph_{0}}   many points. So there are     2   2   ℵ  0     >   2   ℵ  0         superscript  2   superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0      superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0      2^{2^{\aleph_{0}}}>2^{\aleph_{0}}   many continuous functions from L to   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . Not all these functions can be extended to continuous functions on M .  Hence M is not normal, because by the Tietze extension theorem all continuous functions defined on a closed subspace of a normal space can be extended to a continuous function on the whole space.   In fact, if X is a separable topological space having an uncountable closed discrete subspace, X cannot be normal.  See also   Moore space  Hedgehog space   References   Stephen Willard.
