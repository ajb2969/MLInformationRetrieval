   Brunn–Minkowski theorem      Brunn–Minkowski theorem   In mathematics , the Brunn–Minkowski theorem (or Brunn–Minkowski inequality ) is an inequality relating the volumes (or more generally Lebesgue measures ) of compact  subsets of Euclidean space . The original version of the Brunn–Minkowski theorem ( Hermann Brunn 1887; Hermann Minkowski 1896) applied to convex sets; the generalization to compact nonconvex sets stated here is due to L. A. Lyusternik (1935).  Statement of the theorem  Let n ≥ 1 and let μ denote the Lebesgue measure on R n . Let A and B be two nonempty compact subsets of R n . Then the following inequality holds:         [   μ   (   A  +  B   )    ]    1  /  n    ≥     [   μ   (  A  )    ]    1  /  n    +    [   μ   (  B  )    ]    1  /  n      ,       superscript   delimited-[]    μ    A  B       1  n       superscript   delimited-[]    μ  A      1  n     superscript   delimited-[]    μ  B      1  n       [\mu(A+B)]^{1/n}\geq[\mu(A)]^{1/n}+[\mu(B)]^{1/n},     where A + B denotes the Minkowski sum :        A  +  B   :=   {    a  +  b   ∈   ℝ  n    ∣    a  ∈  A   ,   b  ∈   B     }    .     assign    A  B    conditional-set      a  b    superscript  ℝ  n     formulae-sequence    a  A     b  B       A+B:=\{\,a+b\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\mid a\in A,\ b\in B\,\}.     Remarks  The proof of the Brunn–Minkowski theorem establishes that the function      A  ↦    [   μ   (  A  )    ]    1  /  n       maps-to  A   superscript   delimited-[]    μ  A      1  n      A\mapsto[\mu(A)]^{1/n}     is concave in the sense that, for every pair of nonempty compact subsets A and B of R n and every 0 ≤ t ≤ 1,         [   μ   (    t  A   +    (   1  -  t   )   B    )    ]    1  /  n    ≥    t    [   μ   (  A  )    ]    1  /  n     +    (   1  -  t   )     [   μ   (  B  )    ]    1  /  n       .       superscript   delimited-[]    μ      t  A       1  t   B        1  n        t   superscript   delimited-[]    μ  A      1  n         1  t    superscript   delimited-[]    μ  B      1  n        \left[\mu(tA+(1-t)B)\right]^{1/n}\geq t[\mu(A)]^{1/n}+(1-t)[\mu(B)]^{1/n}.     For convex sets A and B , the inequality in the theorem is strict for 0
