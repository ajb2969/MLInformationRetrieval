Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase




Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase

Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (, ACADVL (gene).) is an enzyme with system name very-long-chain acyl-CoA:electron-transfer flavoprotein 2,3-oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a very-long-chain acyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein

 
  a very-long-chain trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein
 

This enzyme contains FAD as prosthetic group.
