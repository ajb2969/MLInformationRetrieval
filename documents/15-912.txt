   Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase      Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase   Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (, ACADVL (gene). ) is an enzyme with system name very-long-chain acyl-CoA:electron-transfer flavoprotein 2,3-oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   a very-long-chain acyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a very-long-chain trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein   This enzyme contains FAD as prosthetic group .
