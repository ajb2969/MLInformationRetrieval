   Bisymmetric matrix      Bisymmetric matrix   In mathematics , a bisymmetric matrix is a square matrix that is symmetric about both of its main diagonals. More precisely, an n × n matrix A is bisymmetric if it satisfies both A = A T and AJ = JA where J is the n × n  exchange matrix .  For example:       [     a    b    c    d    e      b    f    g    h    d      c    g    i    g    c      d    h    g    f    b      e    d    c    b    a     ]   .      a  b  c  d  e    b  f  g  h  d    c  g  i  g  c    d  h  g  f  b    e  d  c  b  a     \begin{bmatrix}a&b&c&d&e\\
 b&f&g&h&d\\
 c&g&i&g&c\\
 d&h&g&f&b\\
 e&d&c&b&a\end{bmatrix}.     Properties  Bisymmetric matrices are both symmetric centrosymmetric and symmetric persymmetric . It has been shown that real-valued bisymmetric matrices are precisely those symmetric matrices whose eigenvalues are the same up to sign after pre or post multiplication by the exchange matrix. 1  The product of two bisymmetric matrices results in a centrosymmetric matrix  References  "  Category:Matrices     ↩
