Fisher's z-distribution is the statistical distribution of half the logarithm of an F distribution variate:



It was first described by Ronald Fisher in a paper delivered at the International Mathematical Congress of 1924 in Toronto, entitled "On a distribution yielding the error functions of several well-known statistics" (Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematics, Toronto, 2: 805-813 (1924). Nowadays one usually uses the F distribution instead.
The probability density function and cumulative distribution function can be found by using the F-distribution at the value of 
 
 
 
 . However, the mean and variance do not follow the same transformation.
The probability density function is12


 
  where B is the beta function.
When the degrees of freedom becomes large (
 
 
 
 ) the distribution approach normality with mean3


 
  and variance
