   1000 (number)      1000 (number)   1000 or one thousand is the natural number following 999 and preceding 1001 in most English-speaking countries . It is conventionally written with a comma separating the thousands unit: 1,000 .  It may also be described as the short thousand in historical discussion of medieval contexts where it might be confused with the Germanic concept of the " long thousand " (1200).  In mathematics   The decimal representation for one thousand is  1,000 —a one followed by three zeros , in the general notation ;  1 × 10 3 —in engineering notation , which for this number coincides with :  1 × 10 3 exactly—in scientific normalized exponential notation ;  1 E+3 exactly—in scientific E notation .   The SI  prefix for a thousand is kilo- , officially abbreviated as k —for instance, prefixed to "metre" or its abbreviation m , kilometre or km signifies a thousand metres. As such, people occasionally represent the number in a non-standard notation by replacing the last three zeros of the general numeral with "K": for instance, 30K for 30,000.  By the SI writing style , a space can be used to as a thousands separator , i.e., to separate the digits of a number every power of 1000.  The sum of Euler's totient function over the first 57 integers is 1000.  Prime Curios! mentions that 1000 is the smallest number that generates three primes in the fastest way possible by concatenation of decremented numbers (1000999, 1000999998997, and 1000999998997996995994993 are prime). The criterion excludes counting the number itself.  1000 is a Harshad number in base 10.   In time   A millennium is 1000 years. The year 1000 was the last year of the 1st millennium .  In the Bible , Saint Peter quotes Old Testament verse which states that "a day is as a thousand years as a thousand years is as a day", establishing an equivalence of Time between the earth and in Heaven.  In the Bible , the Age of Man is six millennia long, the current fifth and fourth (last) millennia being the age recognized as the Age of the Body of Christ .  In the Bible , a week of Days (seven days) is equivalent to seven millennia.   In popular culture   A grand is a slang term for one thousand units of a given currency , usually dollars or pounds . Several grand can be shortened to G s.  The symbol K is sometimes used for a thousand; for example, in referring to units of salary or in reference to the Y2K computer bug.  Especially in the United States, the gambling community often refers to denominations of $1000 as dimes .  A picture is worth a thousand words .  According to an ancient Japanese legend, anyone who folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by a crane.
