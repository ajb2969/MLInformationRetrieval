   Caffeate 3,4-dioxygenase      Caffeate 3,4-dioxygenase   Caffeate 3,4-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,4-dihydroxy- trans - cinnamate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-(2-carboxyethenyl)- cis , cis - muconate    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3,4-dihydroxy-trans-cinnamate (caffeic acid) and oxygen , whereas its product is 3-(2-carboxyethenyl)-cis,cis-muconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxy-trans-cinnamate:oxygen 3,4-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biodegradation .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Hydroxycinnamic acids metabolism
