   20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 20-α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   17alpha,20alpha-dihydroxypregn-4-en-3-one + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 17alpha,20alpha-dihydroxypregn-4-en-3-one , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 20alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P) + 20-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 20alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , 20alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , 20alpha-HSD , and 20alpha-HSDH . This enzyme participates in c21-steroid hormone metabolism .  20alpha-HSD has been initially described as a progesterone metabolizing enzyme of the ovary. On a functional level, ovarian 20alpha-HSD is actively involved in the control of progesterone homeostasis in pregnancy of rats and mice. While 20alpha-HSD expression and activity is downregulated in the corpus luteum of pregnancy, 24 hrs prior to parturition ovarian 20alpha-HSD activity is acutely stimulated. Accordingly, in mice with targeted deletion of the 20alpha-HSD gene, progesterone blood concentration remain high throughout pregnancy which results in a delay of 2–4 days in parturition. Indicating that expression of 20alpha-HSD activity is mandatory for the induction of parturition through reduction of progesterone blood concentration. In mice, 20alpha-HSD is also expressed in the adrenals, kidneys, brain, thymus, T cells and bone marrow. Its induction in hematopoietic cells was used as an assay for the identification of T cell derived factor interleukin-3. In addition, the enzyme reduces and inactivates 17-deoxycorticosterone, the precursor of aldosterone and corticosterone.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
