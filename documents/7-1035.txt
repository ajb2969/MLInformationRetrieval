   Risk-seeking      Risk-seeking   In economics and finance , a risk-seeker or risk-lover is a person who has a preference for  risk . While most investors are considered risk averse , one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking. If offered either $50 or a 50% each chance of either $100 or nothing, a risk-seeking person would prefer the gamble even though the gamble and the sure thing have the same expected value .  Risk-seeking behavior can be observed in the negative domain    x  <  0      x  0    x<0   for prospect theory value functions, where the functions are convex for    x  <  0      x  0    x<0   but concave for    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   .  The risk-seeking utility function  Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of expected utility . Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first derivative . The utility function whose expected value is maximized is convex for a risk-seeker, concave for a risk-averse agent, and linear for a risk-neutral agent. Its convexity in the risk-seeking case has the effect of causing a mean-preserving spread of any probability distribution of wealth outcomes to be preferred over the unspread distribution.
