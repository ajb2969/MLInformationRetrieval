   Dark-energy-dominated era      Dark-energy-dominated era   In physical cosmology , the dark-energy-dominated era refers to the last of the three phases of the known universe, the other two being the matter-dominated era and the radiation-dominated era . The dark-energy-dominated era began after the matter-dominated era, i.e. when the Universe was about 9.8 billion years old. 1 As other forms of the matter – dust and radiation – dropped to very low concentrations, the cosmological constant term started to dominate the energy density of the Universe.  For a dark-energy-dominated universe, the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric is easily obtained solving the Friedmann equations :       a   (  t  )    ∝   exp   (   H  t   )       proportional-to    a  t       H  t      a(t)\propto\exp(Ht)   Here, the coefficient H in the exponential, the Hubble constant , is       H  =     8  π  G   ρ  full    /  3    =    Λ  /  3     .        H        8  π  G   subscript  ρ  full    3             normal-Λ  3       H=\sqrt{8\pi G\rho_{\mathrm{full}}/3}=\sqrt{\Lambda/3}.   This exponential dependence on time makes the spacetime geometry identical to the de Sitter Universe , and only holds for a positive sign of the cosmological constant, the sign that was observed to be realized in Nature anyway. The current density of the observable universe is of the order of 9.44 x 10 −27 kg m −3 and the age of the universe is of the order of 13.8 billion years, or 4.358 x 10 17 s. The Hubble parameter, H, is ~70.88 km s −1 Mpc −1 . (The Hubble time is 13.79 billion years.) The value of the cosmological constant, Λ, is ~2 x 10 −35 s −2 .
