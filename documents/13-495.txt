   Nelson–Aalen estimator      Nelson–Aalen estimator   The Nelson–Aalen estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the cumulative hazard rate function in case of censored data or incomplete data . 1 It is used in survival theory , reliability engineering and life insurance to estimate the cumulative number of expected events. An "event" can be the failure of a non-repairable component, the death of a human being, or any occurrence for which the experimental unit remains in the "failed" state (e.g., death) from the point at which it changed on. The estimator is given by         H  ~    (  t  )    =    ∑    t  i   ≤  t      d  i    n  i      ,         normal-~  H   t     subscript      subscript  t  i   t       subscript  d  i    subscript  n  i       \tilde{H}(t)=\sum_{t_{i}\leq t}\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}},     with    d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   the number of events at    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   and    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   the total individuals at risk at    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   . 2  The curvature of the Nelson–Aalen estimator gives an idea of the hazard rate shape. A concave shape is an indicator for infant mortality while a convex shape indicates wear out mortality .  It can be used for example when testing the homogeneity of Poisson processes . 3  See also   Kaplan–Meier estimator   References  External links  "  Category:Life insurance  Category:Reliability engineering  Category:Survival analysis     ↩  ↩  ↩
