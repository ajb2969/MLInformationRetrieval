   Cephalosporin-C transaminase      Cephalosporin-C transaminase   In enzymology , a cephalosporin-C transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (7R)-7-(5-carboxy-5-oxopentanoyl)aminocephalosporinate + D-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cephalosporin C + 2-oxoglutarate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (7R)-7-(5-carboxy-5-oxopentanoyl)aminocephalosporinate and D-glutamate , whereas its two products are cephalosporin C and 2-oxoglutarate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cephalosporin-C:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include cephalosporin C aminotransferase , and L-alanine:cephalosporin-C aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis .
