2519 – the smallest number congruent to 1 (mod 2), 2 (mod 3), 3 (mod 4), ..., 9 (mod 10)
2520 – superior highly composite number; smallest number divisible by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 ; colossally abundant number; Harshad number in several bases. It is also the highest number with more divisors than any number less than double itself. Not only is it the 7th (and last) number with more divisors than any number double itself but it also the 7th number that is highly composite and the lowest common multiple of a consecutive set of integers from 1  which is a property the previous number with this pattern of divisors does not have (360). That is, although 360 and 2520 both have more divisors than any number twice themselves, 2520 is the lowest number divisible by both 1 to 9 and 1 to 10, whereas 360 is not the lowest number divisible by 1 to 6 (which 60 is) and is not divisible by 1 to 7 (which 420 is). It is also the 6th and largest highly composite number that is a divisor of every higher highly composite number.
