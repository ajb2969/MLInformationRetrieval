   Acetone carboxylase      Acetone carboxylase   In enzymology , an acetone carboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetone + CO 2 + ATP + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetoacetate + AMP + 2 phosphate   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are acetone , CO 2 , ATP , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are acetoacetate , AMP , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetone:carbon-dioxide ligase (AMP-forming) .
