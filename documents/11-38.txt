Acetone carboxylase

In enzymology, an acetone carboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetone + CO2 + ATP + 2 H2O 
 
 
 
  acetoacetate + AMP + 2 phosphate
 

The 4 substrates of this enzyme are acetone, CO2, ATP, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are acetoacetate, AMP, and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetone:carbon-dioxide ligase (AMP-forming).
