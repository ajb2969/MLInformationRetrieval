Boedeker(June 2007).  The system used was    \partial_t q = (d_r+ i d_i) \Delta q + l_r q + (c_r + i     c_i)|q|^2 q + (q_r + i q_i) |q|^4 q.  with parameters d r = 0.5, d i = 1.0, l r = -0.1, c r = 1.8, c i = 1.0, q r = -0.8, q i = -0.1, no-flux boundary conditions. The initial phase difference between the dissipative solitons is Ï€/4 , a finite element code was used for the simulation.  Licensing  "
