== Summary == Space time plot of two colliding dissipative solitons in the cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, generated by Dr. Hendrik U. Boedeker(June 2007).
The system used was






c_i)|q|^2 q + (q_r + i q_i) |q|^4 q.
with parameters dr = 0.5, di = 1.0, lr = -0.1, cr = 1.8, ci = 1.0, qr = -0.8, qi = -0.1, no-flux boundary conditions. The initial phase difference between the dissipative solitons is Ï€/4, a finite element code was used for the simulation.
