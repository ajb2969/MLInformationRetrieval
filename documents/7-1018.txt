   Reflection formula      Reflection formula   In mathematics , a reflection formula or reflection relation for a function  f is a relationship between f ( a − x ) and f ( x ). It is a special case of a functional equation , and it is very common in the literature to use the term "functional equation" when "reflection formula" is meant.  Reflection formulas are useful for numerical computation of special functions . In effect, an approximation that has greater accuracy or only converges on one side of a reflection point (typically in the positive half of the complex plane ) can be employed for all arguments.  Known formula  The even and odd functions satisfy simple reflection relations around a = 0. For all even functions,        f   (   -  x   )    =   f   (  x  )     ,        f    x      f  x     f(-x)=f(x),\,\!     and for all odd functions,        f   (   -  x   )    =   -   f   (  x  )      .        f    x        f  x      f(-x)=-f(x).\,\!     A famous relationship is Euler's reflection formula       Γ   (  z  )   Γ   (   1  -  z   )    =    π   sin   (   π  z   )            normal-Γ  z  normal-Γ    1  z      π      π  z       \Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z)=\frac{\pi}{\sin{(\pi z)}}\!     for the Gamma function Γ( z ), due to Leonhard Euler .  There is also a reflection formula for the general n -th order polygamma function ψ (n) ( z ),         ψ   (  n  )     (   1  -  z   )    +     (   -  1   )    n  +  1     ψ   (  n  )     (  z  )     =     (   -  1   )   n   π    d  n    d   z  n      cot   (   π  z   )              superscript  ψ  n     1  z       superscript    1     n  1     superscript  ψ  n   z       superscript    1   n   π     superscript  d  n     d   superscript  z  n         π  z       \psi^{(n)}(1-z)+(-1)^{n+1}\psi^{(n)}(z)=(-1)^{n}\pi\frac{d^{n}}{dz^{n}}\cot{(%
 \pi z)}\,     which springs trivally from the fact that the polygamma functions are defined as the derivations of the    ln  Γ      normal-Γ    \ln\Gamma   and thus its reflection formula is inherited to them.  The Riemann zeta function ζ( z ) satisfies         ζ   (   1  -  z   )     ζ   (  z  )     =      2   Γ   (  z  )      (   2  π   )   z     cos   (    π  z   2   )      ,          ζ    1  z      ζ  z          2  normal-Γ  z    superscript    2  π   z          π  z   2       \frac{\zeta(1-z)}{\zeta(z)}=\frac{2\,\Gamma(z)}{(2\pi)^{z}}\cos\left(\frac{\pi
 z%
 }{2}\right),\,\!     and the Riemann Xi function ξ( z ) satisfies        ξ   (  z  )    =   ξ   (   1  -  z   )     .        ξ  z     ξ    1  z      \xi(z)=\xi(1-z).\,\!     References      "  Category:Calculus
