   Ventilation (physiology)      Ventilation (physiology)   In respiratory physiology , ventilation is the movement of air between the environment and the lungs via inhalation and exhalation . Thus, for organisms with lungs, it is synonymous with breathing . Ventilation usually happens in a rhythmic pattern, and the frequency of that pattern is called the ventilation rate (or, by long-standing convention, the respiratory rate , although in precise usage  ventilation is a hyponym , not a synonym , of respiration ).  Ventilation volumes and rates are categorized under the following definitions:      Measurement   Symbol   Equation   Description     Minute ventilation        V  ˙   E     subscript   normal-˙  V   E    \dot{V}_{E}      = tidal volume * respiratory rate 1 2   the total volume of gas entering the lungs per minute.     Alveolar ventilation        V  ˙   A     subscript   normal-˙  V   A    \dot{V}_{A}      = ( tidal volume - dead space ) * respiratory rate  3   the volume of gas per unit time that reaches the alveoli , the respiratory portions of the lungs where gas exchange occurs.     Dead space ventilation        V  ˙   D     subscript   normal-˙  V   D    \dot{V}_{D}      = dead space * respiratory rate 4   | is the volume of gas per unit time that does not reach these respiratory portions, but instead remains in the airways ( trachea , bronchi , etc.).
