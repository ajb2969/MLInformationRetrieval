   Astroid      Astroid     An astroid is a particular mathematical curve : a hypocycloid with four cusps . Specifically, it is the locus of a point on a circle as it rolls inside a fixed circle with four times the radius. 1 By double generation, it is also the locus of a point on a circle as it rolls inside a fixed circle with 4/3 times the radius. It can also be defined as the envelope of a line segment with an end point on each of the axes. It is therefore the envelope of the moving bar in the Trammel of Archimedes .  Its modern name comes from the Greek word for " star ". The curve had a variety of names, including tetracuspid (still used), cubocycloid, and paracycle. It is nearly identical in form to the evolute of an ellipse.  Equations  If the radius of the fixed circle is a then the equation is given by 2         x   2  /  3    +   y   2  /  3     =   a   2  /  3     .         superscript  x    2  3     superscript  y    2  3      superscript  a    2  3      x^{2/3}+y^{2/3}=a^{2/3}.\,   This implies that an astroid is also a superellipse .  Parametric equations are       x  =   a    cos  3   t    =    a  4    (    3   cos  t    +   cos   3  t     )     ,        x    a    superscript   3   t             a  4       3    t        3  t         x=a\cos^{3}t={a\over 4}(3\cos t+\cos 3t),          y  =   a    sin  3   t    =    a  4    (    3   sin  t    -   sin   3  t     )     .        y    a    superscript   3   t             a  4       3    t        3  t         y=a\sin^{3}t={a\over 4}(3\sin t-\sin 3t).     The pedal equation with respect to the origin is        r  2   =    a  2   -   3   p  2      ,       superscript  r  2      superscript  a  2     3   superscript  p  2       r^{2}=a^{2}-3p^{2},     the Whewell equation is       s  =     3  a   4    cos   2  φ      ,      s        3  a   4       2  φ       s={3a\over 4}\cos 2\varphi,     and the Cesàro equation is         R  2   +   4   s  2     =    9   a  2    4    .         superscript  R  2     4   superscript  s  2         9   superscript  a  2    4     R^{2}+4s^{2}=\frac{9a^{2}}{4}.     The polar equation is 3       r  =   a    (     cos   2  /  3    θ   +    sin   2  /  3    θ    )    3  /  2      .      r    a   superscript      superscript     2  3    θ     superscript     2  3    θ      3  2       r=\frac{a}{(\cos^{2/3}\theta+\sin^{2/3}\theta)^{3/2}}.     The astroid is a real locus of a plane algebraic curve of genus zero. It has the equation         (     x  2   +   y  2    -   a  2    )   3   +   27   a  2    x  2    y  2     =   0.          superscript       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  a  2    3     27   superscript  a  2    superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     0.    (x^{2}+y^{2}-a^{2})^{3}+27a^{2}x^{2}y^{2}=0.\,     The astroid is therefore a real algebraic curve of degree six.

It has two more complex cusp singularities at infinity, and four complex double points, for a total of ten singularities.  The dual curve to the astroid is the cruciform curve with equation       x  2    y  2    =    x  2   +   y  2     .         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      \textstyle x^{2}y^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}.   The evolute of an astroid is an astroid twice as large.
