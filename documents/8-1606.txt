   Bessel process      Bessel process   In mathematics , a Bessel process , named after Friedrich Bessel , is a type of stochastic process .  Formal definition  The Bessel process of order n is the real-valued process X given by        X  t   =   ∥   W  t   ∥    ,       subscript  X  t    norm   subscript  W  t      X_{t}=\|W_{t}\|,     where ||·|| denotes the Euclidean norm in R n and W is an n -dimensional Wiener process ( Brownian motion ) started from the origin. The n-dimensional Bessel process is the solution to the stochastic differential equation       d   X  t    =    d   Z  t    +     n  -  1   2     d  t    X  t            d   subscript  X  t        d   subscript  Z  t          n  1   2       d  t    subscript  X  t        dX_{t}=dZ_{t}+\frac{n-1}{2}\frac{dt}{X_{t}}   where Z is a 1 -dimensional Wiener process ( Brownian motion ). Note that this SDE makes sense for any real parameter   n   n   n   (although the drift term is singular at zero). Since W was assumed to have started from the origin the initial condition is X 0 = 0.  Notation  A notation for the Bessel process of dimension ''n' started at zero is BES 0 (n).  In specific dimensions  For n ≥ 2, the n -dimensional Wiener process is transient from its starting point: with probability one , X t > 0 for all t > 0. It is, however, neighbourhood-recurrent for n = 2, meaning that with probability 1, for any r > 0, there are arbitrarily large t with X t 2, meaning that X t ≥ r for all t sufficiently large.  For n ≤ 0, the Bessel process is usually started at points other than 0, since the drift to 0 so strong that the process becomes stuck at 0 as soon as it hits 0.  Relationship with Brownian motion  0- and 2-dimensional Bessel processes are related to local times of Brownian motion via the Ray-Knight theorems . 1  The law of a Brownian motion near x-extrema is the law of a 3-dimensional Bessel process (theorem of Tanaka).
