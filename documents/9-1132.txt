Prime zeta function

In mathematics, the Prime zeta function is an analogue of the Riemann zeta function, studied by . It is defined as the following infinite series, which converges for 
 
 
 
 :


 
 .
Properties
The Euler product for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) implies that


 
  which by Möbius inversion gives



When s goes to 1, we have 
 
 
 
 . This is used in the definition of Dirichlet density.
This gives the continuation of P(s) to 
 
 
 
 , with an infinite number of logarithmic singularities at points s where ns is a pole (only ns=1)), or zero of the Riemann zeta function ζ(.). The line 
 
 
 
  is a natural boundary as the singularities cluster near all points of this line.
If we define a sequence



then



(Exponentiation shows that this is equivalent to Lemma 2.7 by Li.)
The prime zeta function is related with the Artin's constant by



where Ln is the nth Lucas number.1

Analysis
Integral
The integral over the prime zeta function is usually anchored at infinity, because the pole at 
 
 
 
  prohibits to define a nice lower bound at some finite integer without entering a discussion on branch cuts in the complex plane:



The noteworthy values are again those where the sums converge slowly:

Generalizations
Almost-prime Zeta Functions
As the Riemann Zeta Function is a sum of inverse powers over the integers and the Prime Zeta Function a sum of inverse powers of the prime numbers, the k-primes (the integers which a are a product of 
 
 
 
  not necessarily distinct primes) define a sort of intermediate sums:



where 
 
 
 
  is the total number of prime factors.

Each integer in the denominator of the Riemann Zeta Function 
 
 
 
  may be classified by its value of the index 
 
 
 
 , which decomposes the Riemann Zeta Function into an infinite sum of the 
 
 
 
 :



Prime Modulo Zeta Functions
Constructing the sum not over all primes but only over primes which are in the same modulo class introduces further types of infinite series that are a reduction of the Dirichlet L-function.
