Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase

In the field of enzymology, phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

10-formyltetrahydrofolate + N1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide 
 
 
tetrahydrofolate + N2-formyl-N1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)glycinamide
 

This enzyme is required for the de novo biosynthesis of purines.
