L-saccharopine oxidase

L-saccharopine oxidase (, FAP2) is an enzyme with system name L-saccharopine:oxygen oxidoreductase (L-glutamate forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

N6-(L-1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine + H2O + O2

 
  (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate + L-glutamate + H2O2


The enzyme is involved in pipecolic acid biosynthesis.
