   Stizolobate synthase      Stizolobate synthase   In enzymology , a stizolobate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-(L-alanin-3-yl)-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate 6-semialdehyde   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine and O 2 , whereas its product is 4-(L-alanin-3-yl)-2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate 6-semialdehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine:oxygen 4,5-oxidoreductase (recyclizing) . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , zinc .  References      "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Zinc enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
