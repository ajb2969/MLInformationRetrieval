Long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + acceptor 
 
 
 
  2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and acceptor, whereas its two products are 2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-acyl-CoA:acceptor 2,3-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase, palmitoyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, and long-chain-acyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism and ppar signaling pathway. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
Mitochondrial mutations in this enzyme may be associated with some forms of dilated cardiomyopathy.
