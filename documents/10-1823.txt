   Aryl-sulfate sulfotransferase      Aryl-sulfate sulfotransferase   In enzymology , an aryl-sulfate sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aryl sulfate + a phenol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a phenol + an aryl sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are aryl sulfate and phenol , whereas its two products are phenol and aryl sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aryl-sulfate:phenol sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include arylsulfate-phenol sulfotransferase , arylsulfotransferase , ASST , arylsulfate sulfotransferase , and arylsulfate:phenol sulfotransferase .
