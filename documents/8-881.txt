   Lambert (unit)      Lambert (unit)   The lambert (symbol L, la or Lb) is a non- SI unit of luminance named for Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777), a Swiss mathematician, physicist and astronomer. A related unit of luminance, the foot-lambert , is used in the lighting, cinema and flight simulation industries. The SI unit is the candela per square metre (cd/m²).  Definition  1 lambert (L) =    1  π      1  π    \frac{1}{\pi}    candela per square centimetre (0.3183 cd/cm²) or     10  4   π       superscript  10  4   π    \frac{10^{4}}{\pi}    cd m −2  See also  Other units of luminance:   Apostilb (asb)  Blondel (blondel)  Bril (bril)  Nit (nit)  Stilb (sb)  Skot (sk)   References   "Lighting Design Glossary: Luminance" at Schorsch Lighting Design Knowledgebase   "  Category:Units of luminance  Category:Non-SI metric units  Category:Photometry
