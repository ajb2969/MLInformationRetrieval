   Deoxynucleoside kinase      Deoxynucleoside kinase   In enzymology , a deoxynucleoside kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2'-deoxynucleoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2'-deoxynucleoside , whereas its two products are ADP and 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include multispecific deoxynucleoside kinase , ms-dNK , multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase , multifunctional deoxynucleoside kinase , D. melanogaster deoxynucleoside kinase , and Dm-dNK .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
