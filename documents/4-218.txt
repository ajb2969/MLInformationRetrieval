Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism




Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism
In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Batalin–Vilkovisky''' ('''BV''') '''formalism''' (named for [[Igor Batalin]] and [[Grigori Vilkovi
 sky]]) was developed as a method for determining the ghost structure for Lagrangian gauge theories, such as gravity and supergravity, whose corresponding Hamiltonian formulation has constraints not related to a Lie algebra (i.e., the role of Lie algebra structure constants are played by more general structure functions). The BV formalism, based on an action that contains both fields and "antifields", can be thought of as a vast generalization of the original BRST formalism for pure Yang–Mills theory to an arbitrary Lagrangian gauge theory. Other names for the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism are field-antifield formalism, Lagrangian BRST formalism, or BV-BRST formalism. It should not be confused with the Batalin–Fradkin–Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism, which is the Hamiltonian counterpart.
Batalin–Vilkovisky algebras
In mathematics, a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is a graded supercommutative algebra (with a unit 1) with a second-order nilpotent operator Δ of degree −1. More precisely, it satisfies the identities

|ab| = |a| + |b| (The product has degree 0)
|Δ(a)| = |a| − 1 (Δ has degree −1)
(ab)c = a(bc) (The product is associative)
ab = (−1)|a||b|ba (The product is (super-)commutative)
Δ2 = 0 (Nilpotency (of order 2))
Δ(abc) − Δ(ab)c −(−1)|a|a Δ(bc) − (−1)(|a|+1)|b|b Δ(ac) + Δ(a)bc + (−1)|a|aΔ(b)c + (−1)|a| + |b|abΔ(c) − Δ(1)abc = 0 (The Δ operator is of second order)

One often also requires normalization:

Δ(1) = 0 (normalization)

Antibracket
A Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra becomes a Gerstenhaber algebra if one defines the Gerstenhaber bracket by


 
  Other names for the Gerstenhaber bracket are Buttin bracket, antibracket, or odd Poisson bracket. The antibracket satisfies

|(a,b)| = |a|+|b| − 1 (The antibracket (,) has degree −1)
(a,b) = −(−1)(|a|+1)(|b|+1)(b,a) (Skewsymmetry)
(−1)(|a|+1)(|c|+1)(a,(b,c)) + (−1)(|b|+1)(|a|+1)(b,(c,a)) + (−1)(|c|+1)(|b|+1)(c,(a,b)) = 0 (The Jacobi identity)
(ab,c) = a(b,c) + (−1)|a||b|b(a,c) (The Poisson property;The Leibniz rule)

Odd Laplacian
The normalized operator is defined as


 
  It is often called the odd Laplacian, in particular in the context of odd Poisson geometry. It "differentiates" the antibracket



 
 
  (The 
 
 
 
  operator differentiates (,))

The square 
 
 
 
  of the normalized 
 
 
 
  operator is a Hamiltonian vector field with odd Hamiltonian Δ(1)



 
  (The Leibniz rule)

which is also known as the modular vector field. Assuming normalization Δ(1)=0, the odd Laplacian 
 
 
 
 
  is just the Δ operator, and the modular vector field 
 
 
 
  vanishes.
Compact formulation in terms of nested commutators
If one introduces the left multiplication operator

 
  as


 
  and the supercommutator [,] as


 
  for two arbitrary operators S and T, then the definition of the antibracket may be written compactly as


 
  and the second order condition for Δ may be written compactly as


 
  (The Δ operator is of second order) where it is understood that the pertinent operator acts on the unit element 1. In other words, 
 
 
 
  is a first-order (affine) operator, and 
 
 
 
  is a zeroth-order operator.
Master equation
The classical master equation for an even degree element S (called the action) of a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is the equation


 
  The quantum master equation for an even degree element W of a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is the equation


 
  or equivalently,


 
  Assuming normalization Δ(1) = 0, the quantum master equation reads



Generalized BV algebras
In the definition of a generalized BV algebra, one drops the second-order assumption for Δ. One may then define an infinite hierarchy of higher brackets of degree −1


 
  The brackets are (graded) symmetric


 
  (Symmetric brackets) where 
 
 
 
 
  is a permutation, and 
 
 
 
  is the Koszul sign of the permutation


 
 . The brackets constitute a homotopy Lie algebra, also known as an 
 
 
 
  algebra, which satisfies generalized Jacobi identities


 
  (Generalized Jacobi identities) The first few brackets are:



 
 
  (The zero-bracket)


 
  (The one-bracket)


 
  (The two-bracket)


 
  (The three-bracket)




In particular, the one-bracket 
 
 
 
 
  is the odd Laplacian, and the two-bracket 
 
 
 
  is the antibracket up to a sign. The first few generalized Jacobi identities are:



 
  (
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -closed)


 
 
  (
 
 
 
  is the Hamiltonian for the modular vector field 
 
 
 
 )


 
  (The 
 
 
 
  operator differentiates (,) generalized)


 
 
  (The generalized Jacobi identity)




where the Jacobiator for the two-bracket 
 
 
 
  is defined as



BV n-algebras
The Δ operator is by definition of n'th order if and only if the (n + 1)-bracket 
 
 
 
  vanishes. In that case, one speaks of a BV n-algebra. Thus a BV 2-algebra is by definition just a BV algebra. The Jacobiator 
 
 
 
  vanishes within a BV algebra, which means that the antibracket here satisfies the Jacobi identity. A BV 1-algebra that satisfies normalization Δ(1) = 0 is the same as a differential graded algebra (DGA) with differential Δ. A BV 1-algebra has vanishing antibracket.
Odd Poisson manifold with volume density
Let there be given an (n|n) supermanifold with an odd Poisson bi-vector 
 
 
 
  and a Berezin volume density 
 
 
 
 , also known as a P-structure and an S-structure, respectively. Let the local coordinates be called 
 
 
 
 . Let the derivatives 
 
 
 
  and


 
  denote the left and right derivative of a function f wrt. 
 
 
 
 , respectively. The odd Poisson bi-vector 
 
 
 
  satisfies more precisely



 
  (The odd Poisson structure has degree –1)


 
  (Skewsymmetry)


 
  (The Jacobi identity)

Under change of coordinates 
 
 
 
  the odd Poisson bi-vector 
 
 
 
  and Berezin volume density 
 
 
 
  transform as








where sdet denotes the superdeterminant, also known as the Berezinian. Then the odd Poisson bracket is defined as


 
  A Hamiltonian vector field

 
  with Hamiltonian f can be defined as


 
  The (super-)divergence of a vector field 
 
 
 
  is defined as


 
  Recall that Hamiltonian vector fields are divergencefree in even Poisson geometry because of Liouville's Theorem. In odd Poisson geometry the corresponding statement does not hold. The odd Laplacian

 
  measures the failure of Liouville's Theorem. Up to a sign factor, it is defined as one half the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field,


 
  The odd Poisson structure 
 
 
 
  and Berezin volume density 
 
 
 
  are said to be compatible if the modular vector field 
 
 
 
  vanishes. In that case the odd Laplacian

 
  is a BV Δ operator with normalization Δ(1)=0. The corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions.
Odd symplectic manifold
If the odd Poisson bi-vector 
 
 
 
  is invertible, one has an odd symplectic manifold. In that case, there exists an odd Darboux Theorem. That is, there exist local Darboux coordinates, i.e., coordinates 
 
 
 
 , and momenta 
 
 
 
 , of degree


 
  such that the odd Poisson bracket is on Darboux form


 
  In theoretical physics, the coordinates 
 
 
 
  and momenta 
 
 
 
  are called fields and antifields, and are typically denoted 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively.


 
  acts on the vector space of semidensities, and is a globally well-defined operator on the atlas of Darboux neighborhoods. Khudaverdian's 
 
 
 
  operator depends only on the P-structure. It is manifestly nilpotent 
 
 
 
 , and of degree −1. Nevertheless, it is technically not a BV Δ operator as the vector space of semidensities has no multiplication. (The product of two semidensities is a density rather than a semidensity.) Given a fixed density 
 
 
 
 , one may construct a nilpotent BV Δ operator as


 
  whose corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions, or equivalently, scalars. The odd symplectic structure 
 
 
 
  and density 
 
 
 
  are compatible if and only if Δ(1) is an odd constant.
Examples

The Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket for multi-vector fields is an example of an antibracket.
If L is a Lie superalgebra, and Π is the operator exchanging the even and odd parts of a super space, then the symmetric algebra of Π(L) (the "exterior algebra" of L) is a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra with Δ given by the usual differential used to compute Lie algebra cohomology.
