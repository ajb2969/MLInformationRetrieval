Trirectangular tetrahedron

[[File:2D-simplex.svg|thumb|A trirectangular tetrahedron can be constructed by a coordinate octant and a plane crossing all 3 axes away from the origin, like:
 x>0
 y>0
 z>0
 and x/a+y/b+z/cV=\frac{abc}{6}.
The altitude h satisfies1



The area 
 
 
 
  of the base is given by2



De Gua's theorem
If the area of the base is 
 
 
 
  and the areas of the three other (right-angled) faces are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then



This is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to a tetrahedron.
