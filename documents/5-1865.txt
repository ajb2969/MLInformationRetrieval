   Weil–Châtelet group      Weil–Châtelet group   In arithmetic geometry , the Weil–Châtelet group or WC-group of an algebraic group such as an abelian variety  A defined over a field  K is the abelian group of principal homogeneous spaces for A , defined over K .  named it for  who introduced it for elliptic curves , and , who introduced it for more general groups. It plays a basic role in the arithmetic of abelian varieties , in particular for elliptic curves, because of its connection with infinite descent .  It can be defined directly from Galois cohomology , as H 1 ( G K , A ), where G K is the absolute Galois group of K . It is of particular interest for local fields and global fields , such as algebraic number fields . For K a finite field ,  proved that the Weil–Châtelet group is trivial for elliptic curves, and  proved that it is trivial for any algebraic group.  See also  The Tate–Shafarevich group of an abelian variety A defined over a number field K consists of the elements of the Weil–Châtelet group that become trivial in all of the completions of K .  The Selmer group , named after Ernst S. Selmer , of A with respect to an isogeny  f : A → B of abelian varieties is a related group which can be defined in terms of Galois cohomology as       Sel   (  f  )     (  A  /  K  )   =   ⋂  v   ker   (   H  1    (   G  K   ,  ker   (  f  )   )   →   H  1    (   G   K  v    ,   A  v    [  f  ]   )   /  im   (   κ  v   )   )      fragments   superscript  Sel  f    fragments  normal-(  A   K  normal-)     subscript   v   ker   fragments  normal-(   superscript  H  1    fragments  normal-(   subscript  G  K   normal-,  ker   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→   superscript  H  1    fragments  normal-(   subscript  G   subscript  K  v    normal-,   subscript  A  v    fragments  normal-[  f  normal-]   normal-)    im   fragments  normal-(   subscript  κ  v   normal-)   normal-)     \mathrm{Sel}^{(f)}(A/K)=\bigcap_{v}\mathrm{ker}(H^{1}(G_{K},\mathrm{ker}(f))%
