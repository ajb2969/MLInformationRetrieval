   Aminoimidazolase      Aminoimidazolase   In enzymology , an aminoimidazolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-aminoimidazole + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   unidentified product + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-aminoimidazole and H 2 O , whereas its two products are unidentified product and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-aminoimidazole aminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called 4-aminoimidazole hydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.4  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
