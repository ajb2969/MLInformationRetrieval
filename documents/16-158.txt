   Centered dodecahedral number      Centered dodecahedral number   A centered dodecahedral number is a centered  figurate number that represents a dodecahedron . The centered dodecahedral number for a specific n is given by       (    2  n   +  1   )   Ã—   (    5   n  2    +   5  n   +  1   )           2  n   1       5   superscript  n  2      5  n   1     (2n+1)\times(5n^{2}+5n+1)     The first such numbers are 1, 33, 155, 427, 909, 1661, 2743, 4215, 6137, 8569, â€¦ .
