   Severi–Brauer variety      Severi–Brauer variety   In mathematics , a Severi–Brauer variety over a field  K is an algebraic variety  V which becomes isomorphic to a projective space over an algebraic closure of K . The varieties are associated to central simple algebras in such a way that the algebra splits over K if and only if the variety has a point rational over K . 1 studied these varieties, and they are also named after Richard Brauer because of their close relation to the Brauer group .  In dimension one, the Severi–Brauer varieties are conics . The corresponding central simple algebras are the quaternion algebras . The algebra ( a , b ) K corresponds to the conic C ( a , b ) with equation       z  2   =    a   x  2    +   b   y  2          superscript  z  2       a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2       z^{2}=ax^{2}+by^{2}   and the algebra ( a , b ) K  splits , that is, ( a , b ) K is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over K , if and only if C ( a , b ) has a point defined over K : this is in turn equivalent to C ( a , b ) being isomorphic to the projective line over K . 2 3  Such varieties are of interest not only in diophantine geometry , but also in Galois cohomology . They represent (at least if K is a perfect field ) Galois cohomology classes in   H 1 ( PGL n )   in the projective linear group , where n is the dimension of V . There is a short exact sequence   1 → GL 1 → GL n → PGL n → 1   of algebraic groups . This implies a connecting homomorphism   H 1 ( PGL n ) → H 2 ( GL 1 )   at the level of cohomology. Here H 2 ( GL 1 ) is identified with the Brauer group of K , while the kernel is trivial because   H 1 ( GL n ) = {1}   by an extension of Hilbert's Theorem 90 . 4 5 Therefore the Severi–Brauer varieties can be faithfully represented by Brauer group elements, i.e. classes of central simple algebras .  Lichtenbaum showed that if X is a Severi–Brauer variety over K then there is an exact sequence      0  →   Pic   (  X  )    →  ℤ   →  δ    Br   (  K  )    →   Br   (  K  )    (  X  )    →  0 .       normal-→  0    Pic  X     normal-→    ℤ     superscript  normal-→  δ       Br  K     normal-→      Br  K  X     normal-→    0 .     0\rightarrow\mathrm{Pic}(X)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}\stackrel{\delta}{\rightarrow}%
 \mathrm{Br}(K)\rightarrow\mathrm{Br}(K)(X)\rightarrow 0\ .     Here the map δ sends 1 to the Brauer class corresponding to X . 6  As a consequence, we see that if the class of X has order d in the Brauer group then there is a divisor class of degree d on X . The associated linear system defines the d -dimensional embedding of X over a splitting field L . 7  References          Further reading     External links   Expository paper on Galois descent (PDF)   "  Category:Algebraic varieties  Category:Diophantine geometry  Category:Homological algebra  Category:Algebraic groups  Category:Ring theory     Jacobson (1996) p.113 ↩   Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.129 ↩  Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.26 ↩  ↩   Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.131 ↩
