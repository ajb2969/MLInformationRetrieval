   File:Null-balance voltmeter.png      File:Null-balance voltmeter.png   An illustration for how to use a potentiometer and known voltage supply to measure a voltage across a portion of an unknown circuit. The potentiometer's resistance is changed at the wiper until the null detector shows zero voltage between the two circuits.       V  t   =     V  k    R  e    R  w         V  t         V  k     R  e    R  w     Vt=\frac{Vk}{Re}Rw     where  Vt: Voltage across test points  Vk: Known voltage  Re: Potentiometer resistance from one end terminal to the other end terminal  Rw: Potentiometer resistance from wiper to end terminal  "
