An illustration for how to use a potentiometer and known voltage supply to measure a voltage across a portion of an unknown circuit. The potentiometer's resistance is changed at the wiper until the null detector shows zero voltage between the two circuits.



where
Vt: Voltage across test points
Vk: Known voltage
Re: Potentiometer resistance from one end terminal to the other end terminal
Rw: Potentiometer resistance from wiper to end terminal
