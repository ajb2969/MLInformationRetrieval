   Non-chaperonin molecular chaperone ATPase      Non-chaperonin molecular chaperone ATPase   Non-chaperonin molecular chaperone ATPase (, molecular chaperone Hsc70 ATPase ) is an enzyme with system name ATP phosphohydrolase (polypeptide-polymerizing) . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate    These enzymes perform many functions that are similar to those of chaperonins .
