Non-chaperonin molecular chaperone ATPase

Non-chaperonin molecular chaperone ATPase (, molecular chaperone Hsc70 ATPase) is an enzyme with system name ATP phosphohydrolase (polypeptide-polymerizing).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + H2O 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate


These enzymes perform many functions that are similar to those of chaperonins.
