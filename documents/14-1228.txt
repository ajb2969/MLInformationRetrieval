The Lomax distribution, conditionally also called the Pareto Type II distribution, is a heavy-tail probability distribution often used in business, economics, and actuarial modeling.12 It is named after K. S. Lomax. It is essentially a Pareto distribution that has been shifted so that its support begins at zero.3
Characterization
Probability density function
The probability density function (pdf) for the Lomax distribution is given by


 
  with shape parameter 
 
 
 
  and scale parameter 
 
 
 
 . The density can be rewritten in such a way that more clearly shows the relation to the Pareto Type I distribution. That is:


 
 .
Differential equation
The pdf of the Lomax distribution is a solution to the following differential equation:



Relation to the Pareto distribution
The Lomax distribution is a Pareto Type I distribution shifted so that its support begins at zero. Specifically:



The Lomax distribution is a Pareto Type II distribution with xm=λ and μ=0:4



Relation to generalized Pareto distribution
The Lomax distribution is a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution. Specifically:



Relation to q-exponential distribution
The Lomax distribution is a special case of the q-exponential distribution. The q-exponential extends this distribution to support on a bounded interval. The Lomax parameters are given by:



Non-central moments
The 
 
 
 
 th non-central moment 
 
 
 
  exists only if the shape parameter 
 
 
 
  strictly exceeds 
 
 
 
 
 , when the moment has the value
