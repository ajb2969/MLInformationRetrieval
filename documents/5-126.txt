Compression body

In the theory of 3-manifolds, a compression body is a kind of generalized handlebody.
A compression body is either a handlebody or the result of the following construction:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact, closed surface (not necessarily connected). Attach 1-handles to 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 .
 

Let 
 
 
 
  be a compression body. The negative boundary of C, denoted 
 
 
 
 , is 
 
 
 
 . (If 
 
 
 
  is a handlebody then 
 
 
 
 .) The positive boundary of C, denoted 
 
 
 
 , is 
 
 
 
  minus the negative boundary.
There is a dual construction of compression bodies starting with a surface 
 
 
 
  and attaching 2-handles to 
 
 
 
 . In this case 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  minus the positive boundary.
Compression bodies often arise when manipulating Heegaard splittings.
