   Compression body      Compression body   In the theory of 3-manifolds , a compression body is a kind of generalized handlebody .  A compression body is either a handlebody or the result of the following construction:   Let   S   S   S   be a compact, closed surface (not necessarily connected). Attach 1- handles to    S  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]       S   0  1     S\times[0,1]   along    S  ×   {  1  }       S   1     S\times\{1\}   .   Let   C   C   C   be a compression body. The negative boundary of C, denoted     ∂  -   C      subscript     C    \partial_{-}C   , is    S  ×   {  0  }       S   0     S\times\{0\}   . (If   C   C   C   is a handlebody then      ∂  -   C   =  ∅        subscript     C      \partial_{-}C=\emptyset   .) The positive boundary of C, denoted     ∂  +   C      subscript     C    \partial_{+}C   , is    ∂  C      C    \partial C   minus the negative boundary.  There is a dual construction of compression bodies starting with a surface   S   S   S   and attaching 2-handles to    S  ×   {  0  }       S   0     S\times\{0\}   . In this case     ∂  +   C      subscript     C    \partial_{+}C   is    S  ×   {  1  }       S   1     S\times\{1\}   , and     ∂  -   C      subscript     C    \partial_{-}C   is    ∂  C      C    \partial C   minus the positive boundary.
