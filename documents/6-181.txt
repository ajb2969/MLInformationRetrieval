It provides supplementary physical, thermodynamic, and vapor pressure data, some of which is redundant with data in the tables above, and some of which is additional.  Physical and thermodynamic tables  In the following tables, values are temperature dependent and to a lesser degree pressure dependent, and are arranged by state of aggregation (s=solid, lq=liquid, g=gas), which are clearly a function of temperature and pressure. All of the data were computed from data given in "Formulation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for Scientific and General Use" (1984). This applies to:   T – temperature in degrees Celsius  V – specific volume in decimeter 3 per kilogram (1 dm 3 is equivalent to 1 liter)  H – specific enthalpy in k J per kilogram  U – specific internal energy in kJ per kilogram  S – specific entropy in kJ per kilogram-kelvin  c p – specific heat capacity at constant pressure in kJ per kilogram-kelvin  γ – Thermal expansion coefficient as 10 −3 per kelvin  λ – Heat conductivity in milliwatt per meter-kelvin  η – Viscosity in micropascal -seconds (1 c P = 1000 µPa·s)  σ – surface tension in millinewtons per meter (equivalent to dyn/cm)   Standard conditions  In the following table, material data are given for standard pressure of 0.1 M Pa (equivalent to 1 bar). Up to 99.63 °C (the boiling point of water at 0.1 MPa), at this pressure water exists as a liquid. Above that, it exists as water vapor. Note that the boiling point of 100.0 °C is at a pressure of 0.101325 MPa (1 atm ), which is the average atmospheric pressure.

Values for the gas section of the table are for a liquid/saturated steam interface.     Triple point  In the following table, material data are given with a pressure of 611.7 Pa (equivalent to 0.006117 bar). Up to a temperature of 0.01 °C, the triple point of water, water normally exists as ice, except for supercooled water, for which one data point is tabulated here. At the triple point, ice can exist together with both liquid water and vapor. At higher temperatures, the data are for water vapor only.

The values in the temperature range of −100 °C to 100 °C were inferred from D. Sunday (1982) and are quite uniform and exact. The values in the temperature range of the boiling point of water up to the critical point (100 °C to 374 °C) are drawn from different sources and are substantially less accurate; hence they should be used only as approximate values. 12 13 14 15  To use the values correctly, consider the following points:   The values apply only to smooth interfaces and in the absence other gases or gas mixtures such as air. Hence they apply only to pure phases and need a correction factor for systems in which air is present.  The values were not computed according formulas widely used in the US, but using somewhat more exact formulas (see below), which can also be used to compute further values in the appropriate temperature ranges.  The saturated vapor pressure over water in the temperature range of −100 °C to −50 °C is only extrapolated [Translator's note: Supercooled liquid water is not known to exist below −42 °C].  The values have various units (Pa, hPa or bar), which must be considered when reading them.   Formulas  The table values for −100 °C to 100 °C were computed by the following formulas, where T is in kelvins and vapor pressures, P w and P i , are in pascals .  Over liquid water   log e ( P w )  =  –6094.4642 T −1 + 21.1249952 – 2.724552×10 −2  T + 1.6853396×10 −5  T 2 + 2.4575506 log e ( T )   For temperature range: 173.15 K to 373.15 K or equivalently −100 °C to 100 °C  Over ice   log e ( P i )  =  –5504.4088 T −1 – 3.5704628 – 1.7337458×10 −2  T + 6.5204209×10 −6  T 2 + 6.1295027 log e ( T )   For temperature range: 173.15 K to 273.15 K or equivalently −100 °C to 0 °C  At triple point  An important basic value, which is not registered in the table, is the saturated vapor pressure at the triple point of water. The internationally accepted value according to measurements of Guildner, Johnson and Jones (1976) amounts to:   P w ( t tp =  0.01 °C)  =  611.657 Pa ± 0.010 Pa at (1- α )  =  99%           Values of saturated vapor pressure of water       Temp.
