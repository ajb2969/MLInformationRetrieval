Multiply perfect number

In mathematics, a multiply perfect number (also called multiperfect number or pluperfect number) is a generalization of a perfect number.
For a given natural number k, a number n is called k-perfect (or k-fold perfect) if and only if the sum of all positive divisors of n (the divisor function, σ(n)) is equal to kn; a number is thus perfect if and only if it is 2-perfect. A number that is k-perfect for a certain k is called a multiply perfect number. As of 2014, k-perfect numbers are known for each value of k up to 11.1
It can be proven that:

For a given prime number p, if n is p-perfect and p does not divide n, then pn is (p+1)-perfect. This implies that an integer n is a 3-perfect number divisible by 2 but not by 4, if and only if n/2 is an odd perfect number, of which none are known.
If 3n is 4k-perfect and 3 does not divide n, then n is 3k-perfect.

For example, 120 is 3-perfect because the sum of the divisors of 120 is
 1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60+120 = 360 = 3 × 120.

  for all positive ε.6
The only known odd multiply perfect number is 1.

Specific values of k
Perfect numbers
A number n with σ(n) = 2n is perfect.
Triperfect numbers
A number n with σ(n) = 3n is triperfect. An odd triperfect number must exceed 1070, have at least 12 distinct prime factors, the largest exceeding 105.7
