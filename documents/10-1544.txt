Polyamine oxidase

In enzymology, a polyamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N1-acetylspermine + O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  N1-acetylspermidine + 3-aminopropanal + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N1-acetylspermine, O2, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are N1-acetylspermidine, 3-aminopropanal, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N1-acetylspermidine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating). This enzyme is also called 1-N-acetylspermidine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating). It has 2 cofactors: FAD, and Iron. A similar enzyme in plants catalyzes non-acetylated polyamines.1
