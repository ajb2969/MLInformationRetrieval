   Quasidihedral group      Quasidihedral group   In mathematics , the quasi-dihedral groups , also called semi-dihedral groups , are certain non-abelian groups of order a power of 2. For every positive integer n greater than or equal to 4, there are exactly four isomorphism classes of nonabelian groups of order 2 n which have a cyclic subgroup of index 2. Two are well known, the generalized quaternion group and the dihedral group . One of the remaining two groups is often considered particularly important, since it is an example of a 2-group of maximal nilpotency class . In Bertram Huppert 's text Endliche Gruppen , this group is called a Quasidiedergruppe. In Daniel Gorenstein 's text, Finite Groups , this group is called the semidihedral group. Dummit and Foote refer to it as the quasidihedral group; we adopt that name in this article. All give the same presentation for this group:      ⟨   r  ,  s   ∣     r   2   n  -  1     =   s  2   =  1   ,    s  r  s   =   r    2   n  -  2    -  1      ⟩     inner-product   r  s    formulae-sequence       superscript  r   superscript  2    n  1      superscript  s  2        1        s  r  s    superscript  r     superscript  2    n  2    1        \langle r,s\mid r^{2^{n-1}}=s^{2}=1,srs=r^{2^{n-2}-1}\rangle\,\!   .  The other non-abelian 2-group with cyclic subgroup of index 2 is not given a special name in either text, but referred to as just G or M_m(2). When this group has order 16 Dummit and Foote refer to this group as the modular group of order 16, as its lattice of subgroups is modular , so in this article this group will be called the modular maximal-cyclic group. Its presentation is:      ⟨   r  ,  s   ∣     r   2   n  -  1     =   s  2   =  1   ,    s  r  s   =   r    2   n  -  2    +  1      ⟩     inner-product   r  s    formulae-sequence       superscript  r   superscript  2    n  1      superscript  s  2        1        s  r  s    superscript  r     superscript  2    n  2    1        \langle r,s\mid r^{2^{n-1}}=s^{2}=1,srs=r^{2^{n-2}+1}\rangle\,\!   .  Both these two groups and the dihedral group are semidirect products of a cyclic group  of order 2 n-1 with a cyclic group  of order 2. Such a non-abelian semi-direct product is uniquely determined by an element of order 2 in the group of units of the ring     ℤ  /   2   n  -  1     ℤ        ℤ   superscript  2    n  1     ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/2^{n-1}\mathbb{Z}   and there are precisely three such elements,     2   n  -  1    -  1       superscript  2    n  1    1    2^{n-1}-1   ,     2   n  -  2    -  1       superscript  2    n  2    1    2^{n-2}-1   , and     2   n  -  2    +  1       superscript  2    n  2    1    2^{n-2}+1   , corresponding to the dihedral group, the quasidihedral, and the modular maximal-cyclic group.  The generalized quaternion group, the dihedral group, and the quasidihedral group of order 2 n all have nilpotency class n −1, and are the only isomorphism classes of groups of order 2 n with nilpotency class n −1. The groups of order p n and nilpotency class n −1 were the beginning of the classification of all p-groups via coclass . The modular maximal-cyclic group of order 2 n always has nilpotency class 2. This makes the modular maximal-cyclic group less interesting, since most groups of order p n for large n have nilpotency class 2 and have proven difficult to understand directly.  The generalized quaternion, the dihedral, and the quasidihedral group are the only 2-groups whose derived subgroup has index 4. The Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem classifies the simple groups, and to a degree the finite groups, with quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups.  Examples  The Sylow 2-subgroups of the following groups are quasidihedral:   PSL 3 ( F q ) for q = 3 mod 4  PSU 3 ( F q ) for q = 1 mod 4.
