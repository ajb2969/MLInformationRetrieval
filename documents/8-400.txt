   Shapiro inequality      Shapiro inequality   In mathematics , the Shapiro inequality is an inequality proposed by H. Shapiro in 1954.  Statement of the inequality  Suppose n is a natural number and     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n}   are positive numbers and:   n is even and less than or equal to 12, or  n is odd and less than or equal to 23.   Then the Shapiro inequality states that        ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i     x   i  +  1    +   x   i  +  2       ≥   n  2         superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  x  i      subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x    i  2         n  2     \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{x_{i}}{x_{i+1}+x_{i+2}}\geq\frac{n}{2}     where      x   n  +  1    =   x  1    ,    x   n  +  2    =   x  2       formulae-sequence     subscript  x    n  1     subscript  x  1       subscript  x    n  2     subscript  x  2      x_{n+1}=x_{1},x_{n+2}=x_{2}   .  For greater values of n the inequality does not hold and the strict lower bound is    γ   n  2       γ    n  2     \gamma\frac{n}{2}   with    γ  ≈   0.9891  …       γ    0.9891  normal-…     \gamma\approx 0.9891\dots   .  The initial proofs of the inequality in the pivotal cases n = 12 (Godunova and Levin, 1976) and n = 23 (Troesch, 1989) rely on numerical computations. In 2002, P.J. Bushell and J.B. McLeod published an analytical proof for n = 12.  The value of γ was determined in 1971 by Vladimir Drinfeld , who won a Fields Medal in 1990. Specifically, Drinfeld showed that the strict lower bound γ is given by     1  2   ψ   (  0  )         1  2   ψ  0    \frac{1}{2}\psi(0)   , where ψ is the function convex hull of f ( x ) = e − x and     g   (  x  )    =   2    e  x   +   e   x  2            g  x     2     superscript  e  x    superscript  e    x  2        g(x)=\frac{2}{e^{x}+e^{\frac{x}{2}}}   . (That is, the region above the graph of ψ is the convex hull of the union of the regions above the graphs of f and g .)  Interior local mimima of the left-hand side are always ≥ n /2 (Nowosad, 1968).  Counter-examples for higher n  The first counter-example was found by Lighthill in 1956, for n = 20:       x  20   =   (   1  +   5  ϵ    ,   6  ϵ   ,   1  +   4  ϵ    ,   5  ϵ   ,   1  +   3  ϵ    ,   4  ϵ   ,   1  +   2  ϵ    ,   3  ϵ   ,   1  +  ϵ   ,   2  ϵ   ,   1  +   2  ϵ    ,  ϵ  ,   1  +   3  ϵ    ,   2  ϵ   ,   1  +   4  ϵ    ,   3  ϵ   ,   1  +   5  ϵ    ,   4  ϵ   ,   1  +   6  ϵ    ,   5  ϵ   )        subscript  x  20      1    5  ϵ      6  ϵ     1    4  ϵ      5  ϵ     1    3  ϵ      4  ϵ     1    2  ϵ      3  ϵ     1  ϵ     2  ϵ     1    2  ϵ    ϵ    1    3  ϵ      2  ϵ     1    4  ϵ      3  ϵ     1    5  ϵ      4  ϵ     1    6  ϵ      5  ϵ      x_{20}=(1+5\epsilon,\ 6\epsilon,\ 1+4\epsilon,\ 5\epsilon,\ 1+3\epsilon,\ 4%
 \epsilon,\ 1+2\epsilon,\ 3\epsilon,\ 1+\epsilon,\ 2\epsilon,\ 1+2\epsilon,\ %

 \epsilon,\ 1+6\epsilon,\ 5\epsilon)   where   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is close to 0. Then the left-hand side is equal to     10  -   ϵ  2    +   O   (   ϵ  3   )          10   superscript  ϵ  2      O   superscript  ϵ  3      10-\epsilon^{2}+O(\epsilon^{3})   , thus lower than 10 when   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is small enough.  The following counter-example for n = 14 is by Troesch (1985):      x  14     subscript  x  14    x_{14}   = (0, 42, 2, 42, 4, 41, 5, 39, 4, 38, 2, 38, 0, 40) (Troesch, 1985)  References     They give an analytic proof of the formula for even n ≤ 12, from which the result for all n ≤ 12 follows. They state n = 23 as an open problem.   External links   Usenet discussion in 1999 (Dave Rusin's notes)  PlanetMath   "  Category:Inequalities
