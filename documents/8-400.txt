Shapiro inequality

In mathematics, the Shapiro inequality is an inequality proposed by H. Shapiro in 1954.
Statement of the inequality
Suppose n is a natural number and 
 
 
 
  are positive numbers and:

n is even and less than or equal to 12, or
n is odd and less than or equal to 23.

Then the Shapiro inequality states that



where 
 
 
 
 .
For greater values of n the inequality does not hold and the strict lower bound is 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
The initial proofs of the inequality in the pivotal cases n = 12 (Godunova and Levin, 1976) and n = 23 (Troesch, 1989) rely on numerical computations. In 2002, P.J. Bushell and J.B. McLeod published an analytical proof for n = 12.
The value of γ was determined in 1971 by Vladimir Drinfeld, who won a Fields Medal in 1990. Specifically, Drinfeld showed that the strict lower bound γ is given by 
 
 
 
 , where ψ is the function convex hull of f(x) = e−x and 
 
 
 
 . (That is, the region above the graph of ψ is the convex hull of the union of the regions above the graphs of f and g.)
Interior local mimima of the left-hand side are always ≥ n/2 (Nowosad, 1968).
Counter-examples for higher n
The first counter-example was found by Lighthill in 1956, for n = 20:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is close to 0. Then the left-hand side is equal to 
 
 
 
 , thus lower than 10 when 
 
 
 
  is small enough.
The following counter-example for n = 14 is by Troesch (1985):


 
  = (0, 42, 2, 42, 4, 41, 5, 39, 4, 38, 2, 38, 0, 40) (Troesch, 1985)

They give an analytic proof of the formula for even n ≤ 12, from which the result for all n ≤ 12 follows. They state n = 23 as an open problem.
