   Autonomous consumption      Autonomous consumption   Autonomous consumption (also exogenous consumption ) is consumption expenditure that occurs when income levels are zero. Such consumption is considered autonomous of income only when expenditure on these consumables does not vary with changes in income; generally, it may be required to fund necessities and debt obligations. If income levels are actually zero, this consumption counts as dissaving , because it is financed by borrowing or using up savings . Autonomous consumption contrasts with induced consumption , in that it does not systematically fluctuate with income, whereas induced consumption does. 1 The two are related, for all households, through the consumption function :      C  =    c  0   +    c  1    Y  d         C     subscript  c  0      subscript  c  1    subscript  Y  d       C=c_{0}+c_{1}Y_{d}   where   C = total consumption,  c 0 = autonomous consumption ( c 0 > 0),  c 1 = the marginal propensity to consume (the gradient of induced consumption) (0 1'' < 1), and  Y d = disposable income (income after government taxes, benefits, and transfer payments).
