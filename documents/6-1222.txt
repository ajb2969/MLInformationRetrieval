   Trident curve      Trident curve   In mathematics, a trident curve (also trident of Newton or parabola of Descartes ) is any member of the family of curves that have the formula :        x  y   +   a   x  3    +   b   x  2    +   c  x    =   d           x  y     a   superscript  x  3      b   superscript  x  2      c  x    d    xy+ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx=d\,     (Figure)  trident curve with a = b = c = d = 1   Trident curves are cubic plane curves with an ordinary double point in the real projective plane at x = 0, y = 1, z = 0; if we substitute x = x / z and y = 1/ z into the equation of the trident curve, we get         a   x  3    +   b   x  2   z   +   c  x   z  2    +   x  z    =   d   z  3     ,          a   superscript  x  3      b   superscript  x  2   z     c  x   superscript  z  2      x  z      d   superscript  z  3      ax^{3}+bx^{2}z+cxz^{2}+xz=dz^{3},\,     (Figure)  trident curve at y = ∞ with a = b = c = d = 1   which has an ordinary double point at the origin. Trident curves are therefore rational plane algebraic curves of genus zero.  References     External links     "  Category:Algebraic curves
