   Polyadic space      Polyadic space   In mathematics, a polyadic space is a topological space that is the image under a continuous function of a topological power of an Alexandroff one-point compactification of a discrete topological space.  History  Polyadic spaces were first studied by S. Mrówka in 1970 as a generalisation of dyadic spaces . 1 The theory was developed further by R. H. Marty, János Gerlits and Murray G. Bell, 2 the latter of whom introduced the concept of the more general centred spaces . 3  Background  A subset K of a topological space X is said to be compact if every open cover of K contains a finite subcover. It is said to be locally compact at a point x ∈ X if x lies in the interior of some compact subset of X . X is a locally compact space if it is locally compact at every point in the space. 4  A proper subset A ⊂ X is said to be dense if the closure  Ā = X . A space whose set has a countable, dense subset is called a separable space .  For a non-compact, locally compact Hausdorff topological space    (  X  ,   τ  X   )     X   subscript  τ  X     (X,\tau_{X})   , we define the Alexandroff one-point compactification as the topological space with the set     {  ω  }   ∪  X       ω   X    \left\{\omega\right\}\cup X   , denoted    ω  X      ω  X    \omega X   , where    ω  ∉  X      ω  X    \omega\notin X   , with the topology    τ   ω  X      subscript  τ    ω  X     \tau_{\omega X}   defined as follows: 5 6        τ  X   ⊆   τ   ω  X         subscript  τ  X    subscript  τ    ω  X      \tau_{X}\subseteq\tau_{\omega X}           X  ∖  C   ∪   {  ω  }    ∈   τ   ω  X            X  C    ω     subscript  τ    ω  X      X\setminus C\cup\left\{\omega\right\}\in\tau_{\omega X}   , for every compact subset    C  ⊆  X      C  X    C\subseteq X   .   Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a discrete topological space, and let    ω  X      ω  X    \omega X   be an Alexandroff one-point compactification of   X   X   X   . A Hausdorff space   P   P   P   is polyadic if for some cardinal number    λ   λ   \lambda   , there exists a continuous surjective function    f  :    ω   X  λ    →  P      normal-:  f   normal-→    ω   superscript  X  λ    P     f:\omega X^{\lambda}\rightarrow P   , where    ω   X  λ       ω   superscript  X  λ     \omega X^{\lambda}   is the product space obtained by multiplying    ω  X      ω  X    \omega X   with itself   λ   λ   \lambda   times. 7  Examples  Take the set of natural numbers    ℤ  +     limit-from  ℤ     \mathbb{Z}+   with the discrete topology. Its Alexandroff one-point compactification is     ω  ℤ   +     limit-from    ω  ℤ      \omega\mathbb{Z}+   . Choose    λ  =  1      λ  1    \lambda=1   and define the homeomorphism    h  :     ω  ℤ   +   →   [  0  ,  1  ]       normal-:  h   normal-→   limit-from    ω  ℤ      0  1      h:\omega\mathbb{Z}+\rightarrow\left[0,1\right]   with the mapping       h   (  x  )    =   {       1  /  x   ,       if  x   ∈   ℤ  +         0  ,       if  x   =  ω             h  x    cases    1  x       if  x    limit-from  ℤ     0      if  x   ω      h(x)=\begin{cases}1/x,&\text{if }x\in\mathbb{Z}+\\
 0,&\text{if }x=\omega\end{cases}   It follows from the definition that the space     {  0  }   ∪    ⋃   n  ∈  ℕ     {   1  /  n   }         0     subscript     n  ℕ       1  n       \left\{0\right\}\cup\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{1/n\right\}   is polyadic and compact directly from the definition of compactness, without using Heine-Borel.  Every dyadic space (a compact space which is a continuous image of a Cantor set 8 ) is a polyadic space. 9  Let X be a separable, compact space. If X is a metrizable space , then it is polyadic (the converse is also true). 10  Properties  The cellularity    c   (  X  )       c  X    c(X)   of a space   X   X   X   is    sup   {   |  B  |   :   B  is a disjoint collection of open sets of  X   }      supremum   conditional-set    B     B  is a disjoint collection of open sets of  X      \sup\left\{|B|:B\text{ is a disjoint collection of open sets of }X\right\}   . The tightness    t   (  X  )       t  X    t(X)   of a space   X   X   X   is defined as follows: let    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   , and    p  ∈   A  ¯       p   normal-¯  A     p\in\bar{A}   . We define     a   (  p  ,  A  )    :=   min   {    |  B  |   :    p  ∈   B  ¯    ,   B  ⊂  A     }       assign    a   p  A       normal-:    B    formulae-sequence    p   normal-¯  B      B  A        a(p,A):=\min\left\{|B|:p\in\bar{B},B\subset A\right\}   , and define     t   (  p  ,  X  )    :=   sup   {   a   (  p  ,  A  )    :    A  ⊂  X   ,   p  ∈   A  ¯     }       assign    t   p  X     supremum   conditional-set    a   p  A     formulae-sequence    A  X     p   normal-¯  A         t(p,X):=\sup\left\{a(p,A):A\subset X,p\in\bar{A}\right\}   . Then      t   (  X  )    :=   sup   {   t   (  p  ,  X  )    :   p  ∈  X   }     .     assign    t  X    supremum   conditional-set    t   p  X      p  X       t(X):=\sup\left\{t(p,X):p\in X\right\}.    11 The topological weight     w   (  X  )       w  X    w(X)   of a polyadic space   X   X   X   satisfies the equality     w   (  X  )    =     c   (  X  )    ⋅  t    (  X  )          w  X      normal-⋅    c  X   t   X     w(X)=c(X)\cdot t(X)   . 12  Let   X   X   X   be a polyadic space, and let    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   . Then there exists a polyadic space    P  ⊂  X      P  X    P\subset X   such that    A  ⊂  P      A  P    A\subset P   and     c   (  P  )    ≤   c   (  A  )          c  P     c  A     c(P)\leq c(A)   . 13  Polyadic spaces are the smallest class of topological spaces that contain metric compact spaces and are closed under products and continuous images. 14 Every polyadic space   X   X   X   of weight     ≤   2  ω       absent   superscript  2  ω     \leq 2^{\omega}   is a continuous image of    ℤ  +     limit-from  ℤ     \mathbb{Z}+   . 15  A topological space X has the Suslin property if there is no uncountable family of pairwise disjoint non-empty open subsets of X. 16 Suppose that X has the Suslin property and X is polyadic. Then X is diadic. 17  Let    d  i  s   (  X  )       d  i  s  X    dis(X)   be the least number of discrete sets needed to cover   X   X   X   , and let    Δ   (  X  )       normal-Δ  X    \Delta(X)   denote the least cardinality of a non-empty open set in   X   X   X   . If   X   X   X   is a polyadic space, then     d  i  s   (  X  )    ≥   Δ   (  X  )          d  i  s  X     normal-Δ  X     dis(X)\geq\Delta(X)   . 18  Ramsey's theorem  There is an analogue of Ramsey's theorem from combinatorics for polyadic spaces. For this, we describe the relationship between Boolean spaces and polyadic spaces. Let    C  O   (  X  )       C  O  X    CO(X)   denote the clopen algebra of all clopen subsets of   X   X   X   . We define a Boolean space as a compact Hausdorff space whose basis is    C  O   (  X  )       C  O  X    CO(X)   . The element    G  ∈   C  O    (  X  )   ′        G    C  O   superscript  X  normal-′      G\in CO(X)^{\prime}   such that     ⟨   ⟨  G  ⟩   ⟩   =   C  O   (  X  )         delimited-⟨⟩   delimited-⟨⟩  G      C  O  X     \langle\langle G\rangle\rangle=CO(X)   is called the generating set for    C  O   (  X  )       C  O  X    CO(X)   . We say   G   G   G   is a    (  τ  ,  κ  )     τ  κ    (\tau,\kappa)   -disjoint collection if   G   G   G   is the union of at most   τ   τ   \tau   subcollections    G  α     subscript  G  α    G_{\alpha}   , where for each   α   α   \alpha   ,    G  α     subscript  G  α    G_{\alpha}   is a disjoint collection of cardinality at most   κ   κ   \kappa   It was proven by Petr Simon that   X   X   X   is a Boolean space with the generating set   G   G   G   of    C  O   (  X  )       C  O  X    CO(X)   being    (  τ  ,  κ  )     τ  κ    (\tau,\kappa)   -disjoint if and only if   X   X   X   is homeomorphic to a closed subspace of    α   κ  τ       α   superscript  κ  τ     \alpha\kappa^{\tau}   . 19 The Ramsey-like property for polyadic spaces as stated by Murray Bell for Boolean spaces is then as follows: every uncountable clopen collection contains an uncountable subcollection which is either linked or disjoint. 20  Compactness  We define the compactness number of a space   X   X   X   , denoted by    cmpn  X     cmpn  X    \operatorname{cmpn}\,X   , to be the least number   n   n   n   such that   X   X   X   has an n-ary closed subbase . We can construct polyadic spaces with arbitrary compactness number. We will demonstrate this using two theorems proven by Murray Bell in 1985. Let   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   be a collection of sets and let   S   S   S   be a set. We denote the set    {   ⋂  ℱ   :   ℱ  is a finite subset of  𝒮   }     conditional-set    ℱ     ℱ  is a finite subset of  𝒮     \{\bigcap\mathcal{F}:\mathcal{F}\text{ is a finite subset of }\mathcal{S}\}   by    𝒮   ℱ  ^      superscript  𝒮   normal-^  ℱ     \mathcal{S}^{\widehat{\mathcal{F}}}   ; all subsets of   S   S   S   of size   n   n   n   by     [  S  ]   n     superscript   delimited-[]  S   n    [S]^{n}   ; and all subsets of size at most   n   n   n   by     [  S  ]    <    =  n       superscript   delimited-[]  S       absent  n      [S]^{<=n}   . If    2  ≤  n  <  ω        2  n       ω     2\leq n<\omega   and     ⋂  ℱ   ≠         ℱ   absent    \bigcap\mathcal{F}\neq   for all    ℱ  ∈    [  𝒮  ]   n       ℱ   superscript   delimited-[]  𝒮   n     \mathcal{F}\in[\mathcal{S}]^{n}   , then we say that   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is n-linked. If every n-linked subset of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   has a non-empty intersection, then we say that   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is n-ary. Note that if   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is n-ary, then so is    𝒮   ℱ  ^      superscript  𝒮   normal-^  ℱ     \mathcal{S}^{\widehat{\mathcal{F}}}   , and therefore every space   X   X   X   with     cmpn  X   ≤  n       cmpn  X   n    \operatorname{cmpn}\,X\leq n   has a closed, n-ary subbase   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   with    𝒮  =   𝒮   ℱ  ^        𝒮   superscript  𝒮   normal-^  ℱ      \mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}^{\widehat{\mathcal{F}}}   . Note that a collection    𝒮  =   𝒮   ℱ  ^        𝒮   superscript  𝒮   normal-^  ℱ      \mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}^{\widehat{\mathcal{F}}}   of closed subsets of a compact space   X   X   X   is a closed subbase if and only if for every closed   K   K   K   in an open set   U   U   U   , there exists a finite   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   such that    ℱ  ⊂  𝒮      ℱ  𝒮    \mathcal{F}\subset\mathcal{S}   and    K  ⊂   ⋃  ℱ   ⊂  U        K    ℱ        U     K\subset\bigcup\mathcal{F}\subset U   . 21  Let   S   S   S   be an infinite set and let   n   n   n   by a number such that    1  ≤  n  <  ω        1  n       ω     1\leq n<\omega   . We define the product topology on     [  S  ]     ≤  n      superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n     [S]^{\leq n}   as follows: for    s  ∈  S      s  S    s\in S   , let     s  -   =   {   F  ∈    [  S  ]     ≤  n     :   s  ∈  F   }        superscript  s     conditional-set    F   superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n       s  F      s^{-}=\{F\in[S]^{\leq n}:s\in F\}   , and let     s  +   =   {   F  ∈    [  S  ]     ≤  n     :   s  ∉  F   }        superscript  s     conditional-set    F   superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n       s  F      s^{+}=\{F\in[S]^{\leq n}:s\notin F\}   . Let   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   be the collection    𝒮  =    ⋃   s  ∈  S     {   s  +   ,   s  -   }        𝒮    subscript     s  S      superscript  s     superscript  s        \mathcal{S}=\bigcup_{s\in S}\{s^{+},s^{-}\}   . We take   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   as a clopen subbase for our topology on     [  S  ]     ≤  n      superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n     [S]^{\leq n}   . This topology is compact and Hausdorff. For   k   k   k   and   n   n   n   such that    0  ≤  k  ≤  n        0  k       n     0\leq k\leq n   , we have that     [  S  ]   k     superscript   delimited-[]  S   k    [S]^{k}   is a discrete subspace of     [  S  ]     ≤  n      superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n     [S]^{\leq n}   , and hence that     [  S  ]     ≤  n      superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n     [S]^{\leq n}   is a union of    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   discrete subspaces. 22  Theorem (Upper bound on    cmpn    [  S  ]     ≤  n       fragments  cmpn   superscript   fragments  normal-[  S  normal-]     absent  n      \operatorname{cmpn}\,[S]^{\leq n}   ): For each total order  on   S   S   S   , there is an    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   -ary closed subbase   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   of     [  S  ]     ≤   2  n       superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent    2  n      [S]^{\leq 2n}   .

It follows that     [  S  ]     ≤  n      superscript   delimited-[]  S     absent  n     [S]^{\leq n}   is a polyadic space. Hence     [   ω  1   ]     ≤    2  n   -  1       superscript   delimited-[]   subscript  ω  1      absent      2  n   1      [\omega_{1}]^{\leq 2n-1}   is a polyadic space with compactness number    cmpn    [   ω  1   ]     ≤    2  n   -  1     =  n  +  1     fragments  cmpn   superscript   fragments  normal-[   subscript  ω  1   normal-]     absent      2  n   1      n   1    \operatorname{cmpn}\,[\omega_{1}]^{\leq 2n-1}=n+1   . 23  Generalisations  Centred spaces, AD-compact spaces 24 and ξ-adic spaces 25 are generalisations of polyadic spaces.  Centred space  Let   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   be a collection of sets. We say that   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is centred if     ⋂  ℱ   ≠         ℱ   absent    \bigcap\mathcal{F}\neq   for all finite subsets    ℱ  ⊆  𝒮      ℱ  𝒮    \mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{S}   . 26 Define the Boolean space     C  e  n   (  𝒮  )    =   {   χ  T   :   T  is a centred subcollection of  𝒮   }         C  e  n  𝒮    conditional-set   subscript  χ  T     T  is a centred subcollection of  𝒮      Cen(\mathcal{S})=\{\chi_{T}:T\text{ is a centred subcollection of }\mathcal{S}\}   , with the subspace topology from    2  𝒮     superscript  2  𝒮    2^{\mathcal{S}}   . We say that a space   X   X   X   is a centred space if there exists a collection   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   such that   X   X   X   is a continuous image of    C  e  n   (  𝒮  )       C  e  n  𝒮    Cen(\mathcal{S})   . 27  Centred spaces were introduced by Murray Bell in 2004.  AD-compact space  Let   X   X   X   be a non-empty set, and consider a family of its subsets    𝒜  ⊆   𝒫   (  X  )        𝒜    𝒫  X     \mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)   . We say that   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is an adequate family if:       A  ∈   𝒜  and  B   ⊆  𝒜  ⇒  B  ∈  𝒜        A    𝒜  italic- and  B        𝒜    normal-⇒    B       𝒜     A\in\mathcal{A}\and B\subseteq\mathcal{A}\Rightarrow B\in\mathcal{A}     given    A  ⊆  X      A  X    A\subseteq X   , if every finite subset of   A   A   A   is in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , then    A  ∈  𝒜      A  𝒜    A\in\mathcal{A}   .   We may treat   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   as a topological space by considering it a subset of the Cantor cube     D  X     superscript  D  X    D^{X}   , and in this case, we denote it    K   (  𝒜  )       K  𝒜    K(\mathcal{A})   .  Let   K   K   K   be a compact space. If there exist a set   X   X   X   and an adequate family    𝒜  ⊆   𝒫   (  X  )        𝒜    𝒫  X     \mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)   , such that   K   K   K   is the continuous image of    K   (  𝒜  )       K  𝒜    K(\mathcal{A})   , then we say that   K   K   K   is an AD-compact space.  AD-compact spaces were introduced by Grzegorz Plebanek. He proved that they are closed under arbitrary products and Alexandroff compactifications of disjoint unions . It follows that every polyadic space is hence an AD-compact space. The converse is not true, as there are AD-compact spaces that are not polyadic. 28  ξ-adic space  Let   κ   κ   \kappa   and   τ   τ   \tau   be cardinals, and let   X   X   X   be a Hausdorff space. If there exists a continuous surjection from     (   κ  +  1   )   τ     superscript    κ  1   τ    (\kappa+1)^{\tau}   to   X   X   X   , then   X   X   X   is said to be a ξ-adic space. 29  ξ-adic spaces were proposed by S. Mrówka, and the following results about them were given by János Gerlits (they also apply to polyadic spaces, as they are a special case of ξ-adic spaces). 30  Let   𝔫   𝔫   \mathfrak{n}   be an infinite cardinal, and let   X   X   X   be a topological space. We say that   X   X   X   has the property    𝐁   (  𝔫  )       𝐁  𝔫    \mathbf{B}(\mathfrak{n})   if for any family    {   G  α   :   α  ∈  A   }     conditional-set   subscript  G  α     α  A     \{G_{\alpha}:\alpha\in A\}   of non-empty open subsets of   X   X   X   , where     |  A  |   =  𝔫        A   𝔫    |A|=\mathfrak{n}   , we can find a set    B  ⊂  A      B  A    B\subset A   and a point    p  ∈  X      p  X    p\in X   such that     |  B  |   =  𝔫        B   𝔫    |B|=\mathfrak{n}   and for each neighbourhood   N   N   N   of   p   p   p   , we have that    |   {  β  ∈  B  :  N  ∩   G  β   =  }   |  <  𝔫     fragments  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  β   B  normal-:  N    subscript  G  β    normal-}   normal-|   n    |\{\beta\in B:N\cap G_{\beta}=\}|<\mathfrak{n}   .  If   X   X   X   is a ξ-adic space, then   X   X   X   has the property    𝐁   (  𝔫  )       𝐁  𝔫    \mathbf{B}(\mathfrak{n})   for each infinite cardinal   𝔫   𝔫   \mathfrak{n}   . It follows from this result that no infinite ξ-adic Hausdorff space can be an extremally disconnected space . 31  Hyadic space  Hyadic spaces were introduced by Eric van Douwen . 32 They are defined as follows.  Let   X   X   X   be a Hausdorff space. We denote by    H   (  X  )       H  X    H(X)   the hyperspace of   X   X   X   . We define the subspace     J  2    (  X  )        subscript  J  2   X    J_{2}(X)   of    H   (  X  )       H  X    H(X)   by    {   F  ∈   H   (  X  )     :    |  F  |   ≤  2   }     conditional-set    F    H  X        F   2     \{F\in H(X):|F|\leq 2\}   . A base of    H   (  X  )       H  X    H(X)   is the family of all sets of the form     ⟨   U  0   ,  …  ,   U  n   ⟩   =   {   F  ∈   H   (  X  )     :    F  ⊆    U  0   ∪  …  ∪   U  n     ,    F  ∩   U  i    ≠   for  0   ≤  i  ≤  n    }         subscript  U  0   normal-…   subscript  U  n     conditional-set    F    H  X     formulae-sequence    F     subscript  U  0   normal-…   subscript  U  n           F   subscript  U  i      for  0        i       n        \langle U_{0},\dots,U_{n}\rangle=\{F\in H(X):F\subseteq U_{0}\cup\dots\cup U_{%
 n},F\cap U_{i}\neq\text{ for }0\leq i\leq n\}   , where   n   n   n   is any integer, and    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   are open in   X   X   X   . If   X   X   X   is compact, then we say a Hausdorff space   Y   Y   Y   is hyadic if there exists a continuous surjection from    H   (  X  )       H  X    H(X)   to   Y   Y   Y   . 33  Polyadic spaces are hyadic. 34  See also   Dyadic space  Eberlein compactum  Stone space  Stone–Čech compactification  Supercompact space   References  "  Category:Properties of topological spaces  Category:General topology     ↩    ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩
