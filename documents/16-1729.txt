   Tensor product bundle      Tensor product bundle       In differential geometry , the tensor product of vector bundles  E , F is a vector bundle, denoted by E ⊗ F , whose fiber over a point x is the tensor product of vector spaces  E x ⊗ F x . 1  Example: If O is a trivial line bundle, then E ⊗ O = E for any E .  Example: E ⊗ E * is canonically isomorphic to the endomorphism bundle End( E ), where E * is the dual bundle of E .  Example: A line bundle  L has tensor inverse: in fact, L ⊗ L * is (isomorphic to) a trivial bundle by the previous example, as End( L ) is trivial. Thus, the set of the isomorphism classes of all line bundles on the some topological space X forms an abelian group called the Picard group of X .  Variants  One can also define a symmetric power and an exterior power of a vector bundle in a similar way. For example, a section of     Λ  p    T  *   M       superscript  normal-Λ  p    superscript  T    M    \Lambda^{p}T^{*}M   is a differential p -form and a section of      Λ  p    T  *   M   ⊗  E     tensor-product     superscript  normal-Λ  p    superscript  T    M   E    \Lambda^{p}T^{*}M\otimes E   is a differential p -form with values in a vector bundle E .

For the general case, if the base is compact, choose E{{'}} such that E ⊕ E{{'}} is trivial. Choose F{{'}} in the same way. Then let E ⊗ F be the subbundle of ( E ⊕ E{{'}} ) ⊗ ( F ⊕ F{{'}} ) with the desired fibers. Finally, use the approximation argument to handle a non-compact base. See Hatcher for a general direct approach. ↩
