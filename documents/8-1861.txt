Development (topology)

In the mathematical field of topology, a development is a countable collection of open covers of a topological space that satisfies certain separation axioms.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space. A development for 
 
 
 
  is a countable collection 
 
 
 
  of open coverings of 
 
 
 
 , such that for any closed subset 
 
 
 
  and any point 
 
 
 
  in the complement of 
 
 
 
 , there exists a cover 
 
 
 
  such that no element of 
 
 
 
  which contains 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
 . A space with a development is called developable.
A development 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  is called a nested development. A theorem from Vickery states that every developable space in fact has a nested development. If 
 
 
 
  is a refinement of 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 , then the development is called a refined development.
Vickery's theorem implies that a topological space is a Moore space if and only if it is regular and developable.
