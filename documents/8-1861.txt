   Development (topology)      Development (topology)   In the mathematical field of topology , a development is a countable collection of open covers of a topological space that satisfies certain separation axioms .  Let   X   X   X   be a topological space. A development for   X   X   X   is a countable collection     F  1   ,   F  2   ,  …      subscript  F  1    subscript  F  2   normal-…    F_{1},F_{2},\ldots   of open coverings of   X   X   X   , such that for any closed subset    C  ⊂  X      C  X    C\subset X   and any point   p   p   p   in the complement of   C   C   C   , there exists a cover    F  j     subscript  F  j    F_{j}   such that no element of    F  j     subscript  F  j    F_{j}   which contains   p   p   p   intersects   C   C   C   . A space with a development is called developable .  A development     F  1   ,   F  2   ,  …      subscript  F  1    subscript  F  2   normal-…    F_{1},F_{2},\ldots   such that     F   i  +  1    ⊂   F  i        subscript  F    i  1     subscript  F  i     F_{i+1}\subset F_{i}   for all   i   i   i   is called a nested development . A theorem from Vickery states that every developable space in fact has a nested development. If    F   i  +  1      subscript  F    i  1     F_{i+1}   is a refinement of    F  i     subscript  F  i    F_{i}   , for all   i   i   i   , then the development is called a refined development .  Vickery's theorem implies that a topological space is a Moore space if and only if it is regular and developable.  References         "  Category:General topology
