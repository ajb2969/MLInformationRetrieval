   Glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase      Glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CTP + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + CDP-glycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and CDP-glycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase . Other names in common use include CDP-glycerol pyrophosphorylase , cytidine diphosphoglycerol pyrophosphorylase , cytidine diphosphate glycerol pyrophosphorylase , CTP:glycerol 3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase , and Gro-PCT . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
