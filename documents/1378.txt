   Thymidine phosphorylase      Thymidine phosphorylase   In enzymology , a thymidine phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   thymidine + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   thymine + 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thymidine and phosphate , whereas its two products are thymine and 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate .  Thymidine phosphorylase is involved and used in the diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE).  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thymidine:phosphate deoxy-alpha-D-ribosyltransferase . Other names in common use include pyrimidine phosphorylase , thymidine-orthophosphate deoxyribosyltransferase , animal growth regulators, blood platelet-derived endothelial cell , growth factors , blood platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor , deoxythymidine phosphorylase , gliostatins , pyrimidine deoxynucleoside phosphorylase , and thymidine:phosphate deoxy-D-ribosyltransferase . This enzyme is involved in metabolic pathways : purine metabolism / pyrimidine metabolism , and bladder cancer .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
