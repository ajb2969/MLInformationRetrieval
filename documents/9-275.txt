Ponderomotive energy

In strong-field laser physics, ponderomotive energy is the cycle-averaged quiver energy of a free electron in an electromagnetic field.1
Equation
The ponderomotive energy is given by


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the electron charge, 
 
 
 
  is the linearly polarised electric field amplitude, 
 
 
 
 
  is the laser carrier frequency and 
 
 
 
  is the electron mass.
In terms of the laser intensity

 
 , using 
 
 
 
 , it reads less simply:


 
 .
Atomic units
In atomic units, 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . If one uses the atomic unit of electric field,2 then the ponderomotive energy is just



Derivation
The formula for the ponderomotive energy can be easily derived. A free electron of charge 
 
 
 
 
  interacts with an electric field 
 
 
 
 . The force on the electron is


 
 .
The acceleration of the electron is


 
 .
Because the electron executes harmonic motion, the electron's position is


 
 .
For a particle experiencing harmonic motion, the time-averaged energy is


 
 .
In laser physics, this is called the ponderomotive energy 
 
 
 
 .
