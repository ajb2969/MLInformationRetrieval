   68 (number)      68 (number)   68 ( sixty-eight ) is the natural number following 67 and preceding 69 .  In mathematics  68 is a Perrin number . 1  It is the largest known number to be the sum of two primes in exactly two different ways: 68 = 7 + 61 = 31 + 37. 2 All higher even numbers that have been checked are the sum of three or more pairs of primes; the conjecture that 68 is the largest number with this property is closely related to the Goldbach conjecture and like it remains unproven. 3  Because of the factorization of 68 as     2  2   ⋅   (    2   2  2    +  1   )      normal-⋅   superscript  2  2      superscript  2   superscript  2  2    1     2^{2}\cdot(2^{2^{2}}+1)   , a 68-sided regular polygon may be constructed with compass and straightedge . 4  There are exactly 68 10-bit binary numbers in which each bit has an adjacent bit with the same value, 5 exactly 68 combinatorially distinct triangulations of a given triangle with four points interior to it, 6 and exactly 68 intervals in the Tamari lattice describing the ways of parenthesizing five items. 7 The largest graceful graph on 13 nodes has exactly 68 edges. 8 There are 68 different undirected graphs with six edges and no isolated nodes, 9 68 different minimally 2-connected graphs on seven unlabeled nodes, 10 68 different degree sequences of four-node connected graphs, 11 and 68 matroids on four labeled elements. 12  Størmer's theorem proves that, for every number p , there are a finite number of pairs of consecutive numbers that are both p -smooth (having no prime factor larger than p ). For p = 13 this finite number is exactly 68. 13 On an infinite chessboard, there are 68 squares three knight's moves away from any cell. 14  As a decimal number , 68 is the last two-digit number to appear in the digits of pi . 15 It is a happy number , meaning that repeatedly summing the squares of its digits eventually leads to 1: 16      68  →    6  2   +   8  2    =  100  →    1  2   +   0  2   +   0  2    =  1.       normal-→  68     superscript  6  2    superscript  8  2         100    normal-→       superscript  1  2    superscript  0  2    superscript  0  2         1.     68\to 6^{2}+8^{2}=100\to 1^{2}+0^{2}+0^{2}=1.     Other uses   68 is the atomic number of erbium , a lanthanide  In the restaurant industry, 68 may be used as a code meaning "put back on the menu", being the opposite of 86 which means "remove from the menu". 17  68 may also be used as slang for oral sex , based on a play on words involving the number 69 . 18   See also   68 (disambiguation)   References  "  6 8     ↩  http://math.fau.edu/richman/Interesting/WebSite/Number68.pdf retrieved 13 March 2013 ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  . ↩  . ↩
