   Nerve of a covering      Nerve of a covering   In mathematics , the nerve of an open covering is a construction in topology , of an abstract simplicial complex from an open covering of a topological space  X .  The notion of nerve was introduced by Pavel Alexandrov . 1  Given an index set  I , and open sets ''U i'' contained in X , the nerve  N is the set of finite subsets of I defined as follows:   a finite set J ⊆ I belongs to N if and only if the intersection of the U i whose subindices are in J is non-empty. That is, if and only if            ⋂   j  ∈  J     U  j    ≠  ∅   .        subscript     j  J     subscript  U  j       \bigcap_{j\in J}U_{j}\neq\varnothing.        Obviously, if J belongs to N , then any of its subsets is also in N . Therefore N is an abstract simplicial complex.  In general, the complex N need not reflect the topology of X accurately. For example we can cover any n -sphere with two contractible sets U and V , in such a way that N is a 1- simplex . However, if we also insist that the open sets corresponding to every intersection indexed by a set in N is also contractible , the situation changes. This means for instance that a circle covered by three open arcs, intersecting in pairs in one arc, is modelled by a homeomorphic complex, the geometrical realization of N .
