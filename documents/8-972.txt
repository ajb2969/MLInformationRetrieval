Hexadecagon

In mathematics, a hexadecagon (sometimes called a hexakaidecagon) is a polygon with 16 sides and 16 vertices.1
A regular hexadecagon is a hexadecagon in which all angles are equal and all sides are congruent. Its Schläfli symbol is {16} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated octagon, t{8}, which alternates two types of edges.
Construction
As the ancient Greek mathematicians already knew,2 a regular hexadecagon is constructible using compass and straightedge:

Measurements
Each angle of a regular hexadecagon is 157.5 degrees, and the total angle measure of any hexadecagon is 2520 degrees.
The area of a regular hexadecagon is: (with t = edge length)



Because the hexadecagon has a number of sides that is a power of two, its area can be computed in terms of the circumradius r by truncating Viète's formula:



Related figures
A hexadecagram is an 16-sided star polygon, represented by symbol {16/n}. There are three regular star polygons, {16/3}, {16/5}, {16/7}, using the same vertices, but connecting every third, fifth or seventh points. There are also three compounds: {16/2} is reduced to 2{8} as two octagons, {16/4} is reduced to 4{4} as four squares and {16/6} reduces to 2{8/3} as two octagrams, and finally {16/8} is reduced to 8{2} as eight digons.

Deeper truncations of the regular octagon and octagram can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate hexadecagram forms with equally spaced vertices and two edge lengths. 3
A truncated octagon is a hexadecagon, t{8}={16}. A quasitruncated octagon, inverted as {8/7}, is a hexadecagram: t{8/7}={16/7}. A truncated octagram {8/3} is a hexadecagram: t{8/3}={16/3} and a quasitruncated octagram, inverted as {8/5}, is a hexadecagram: t{8/5}={16/5}.

In art
 In the early 16th century, Raphael was the first to construct a perspective image of a regular hexadecagon: the tower in his painting The Marriage of the Virgin has 16 sides, elaborating on an eight-sided tower in a previous painting by Pietro Perugino.4
 Hexadecagrams, 16-pointed star polygons, are included in the Girih patterns in the Alhambra.5
Irregular hexadecagons
An octagonal star can be seen as a concave hexadecagon:
