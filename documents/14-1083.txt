   Bethe–Feynman formula      Bethe–Feynman formula   The Bethe-Feynman efficiency formula , a simple method for calculating the yield of a fission bomb, 1 was first derived in 1943 after development in 1942. Aspects of the formula are speculated to be secret restricted data . 2  Related formula   a = internal energy per gram  b = growth rate  c = sphere radius       a  ≈     (   b  c   )   2   f       a     superscript    b  c   2   f     a\approx(bc)^{2}f     A numerical coefficient would then be included to create the Bethe–Feynman formula—increasing accuracy more than an order of magnitude. 3  See also   Richard Feynman  Hans Bethe  Robert Serber   References  "  Category:Nuclear physics     http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html ↩  Meeting and working with Richard Feynman at Los Alamos , Web of Stories, story by Hans Bethe recorded in December 1996, last accessed 2015/04/20. ↩  ↩
