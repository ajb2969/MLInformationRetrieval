The q-exponential distribution is a probability distribution arising from the maximization of the Tsallis entropy under appropriate constraints, including constraining the domain to be positive. It is one example of a Tsallis distribution. The q-exponential is a generalization of the exponential distribution in the same way that Tsallis entropy is a generalization of standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy or Shannon Entropy.1 The exponential distribution is recovered as

Characterization
Probability density function
The q-exponential distribution has the probability density function



where



is the q-exponential, if q≠1. When q=1, eq(x) is just exp(x).
Derivation
In a similar procedure to how the exponential distribution can be derived using the standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy or Shannon entropy and constraining the domain of the variable to be positive, the q-exponential distribution can be derived from a maximization of the Tsallis Entropy subject to the appropriate constraints.
Relationship to other distributions
The q-exponential is a special case of the Generalized Pareto distribution where



The q-exponential is the generalization of the Lomax distribution (Pareto Type II), as it extends this distribution to the cases of finite support. The Lomax parameters are:



As the Lomax distribution is a shifted version of the Pareto distribution, the q-exponential is a shifted reparameterized generalization of the Pareto. When q > 1, the q-exponential is equivalent to the Pareto shifted to have support starting at zero. Specifically:



Generating random deviates
Random deviates can be drawn using Inverse transform sampling. Given a variable U that is uniformly distributed on the interval (0,1), then

Applications
Economics (econophysics)
The q-exponential distribution has been used to describe the distribution of wealth (assets) between individuals.2
