   Pillai prime      Pillai prime   In number theory , a Pillai prime is a prime number  p for which there is an integer n > 0 such that the factorial of n is one less than a multiple of the prime, but the prime is not one more than a multiple of n . To put it algebraically,     n  !   ≡    -  1   mod  p         n    modulo    1   p     n!\equiv-1\mod p   but    p  ≢   1  mod  n      not-equivalent-to  p   modulo  1  n     p\not\equiv 1\mod n   . The first few Pillai primes are   23 , 29 , 59 , 61 , 67 , 71 , 79 , 83 , 109 , 137 , 139 , 149 , 193 , ...   Pillai primes are named after the mathematician Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai , who asked about these numbers. Their infinitude has been proved several times, by Subbarao , Erdős, and Hardy & Subbarao.  References    .   .    "  Category:Classes of prime numbers  Category:Factorial and binomial topics
