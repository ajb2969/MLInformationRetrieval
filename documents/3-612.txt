   Artin–Wedderburn theorem      Artin–Wedderburn theorem  In [[abstract algebra]], the '''Artin–Wedderburn theorem''' is a [[classification theorem]] for [[semisimple ring]]s and [[semisimple algebra]]s.  The theorem states that an (Artinian) 1 semisimple ring R is isomorphic to a product of finitely many n i -by- n i  matrix  rings over division  rings  D i , for some integers n i , both of which are uniquely determined up to permutation of the index i .  In particular, any simple left or right Artinian  ring is isomorphic to an n -by- n  matrix  ring over a division  ring  D , where both n and D are uniquely determined. 2  As a direct corollary, the Artin–Wedderburn theorem implies that every simple ring that is finite-dimensional over a division ring (a simple algebra ) is a matrix ring . This is Joseph Wedderburn 's original result. Emil Artin later generalized it to the case of Artinian rings.  Note that if R is a finite-dimensional simple algebra over a division ring E , D need not be contained in E . For example, matrix rings over the complex numbers are finite-dimensional simple algebras over the real numbers .  The Artin–Wedderburn theorem reduces classifying simple rings over a division ring to classifying division rings that contain a given division ring. This in turn can be simplified: The center of D must be a field K. Therefore R is a K -algebra, and itself has K as its center. A finite-dimensional simple algebra R is thus a central simple algebra over K. Thus the Artin–Wedderburn theorem reduces the problem of classifying finite-dimensional central simple algebras to the problem of classifying division rings with given center.  Examples  Let R be the field of real numbers, C be the field of complex numbers, and H the quaternions .   Every finite-dimensional simple algebra over R must be a matrix ring over R , C , or H . Every central simple algebra over R must be a matrix ring over R or H . These results follow from the Frobenius theorem .  Every finite-dimensional simple algebra over C must be a matrix ring over C and hence every central simple algebra over C must be a matrix ring over C .  Every finite-dimensional central simple algebra over a finite field must be a matrix ring over that field.  Every commutative semisimple ring must be a finite direct product of fields. 3  The Artin–Wedderburn theorem implies that a semisimple algebra over a field   k   k   k   is isomorphic to a finite product    ∏    M   n  i     (   D  i   )       product     subscript  M   subscript  n  i     subscript  D  i      \prod M_{n_{i}}(D_{i})   where the    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   are natural numbers, the    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   are finite dimensional division algebras over   k   k   k   , and     M   n  i     (   D  i   )        subscript  M   subscript  n  i     subscript  D  i     M_{n_{i}}(D_{i})   is the algebra of     n  i   ×   n  i        subscript  n  i    subscript  n  i     n_{i}\times n_{i}   matrices over    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   . Again, this product is unique up to permutation of the factors.   See also   Maschke's theorem  Brauer group  Jacobson density theorem  Hypercomplex number   References   P. M.

Some  authors  use  "semisimple"  to  mean  the  ring  has  a  trivial  Jacobson  radical .  For  Artinian  rings,  the  two  notions  are  equivalent,  so  "Artinian"  is  included  here  to  eliminate  that  ambiguity. ↩  ↩  This is clear since matrix rings larger than 1×1 are never commutative. ↩
