Mycinamicin III 3''-O-methyltransferase

'Mycinamicin III 3-O-methyltransferase''' (, MycF) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:mycinamicin III 3-O-methyltransferase''.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + mycinamicin III $\rightleftharpoons$ S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + mycinamicin IV
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of mycinamicin macrolide antibiotics.
