Correlation immunity

In mathematics, the correlation immunity of a Boolean function is a measure of the degree to which its outputs are uncorrelated with some subset of its inputs. Specifically, a Boolean function is said to be correlation-immune of order m if every subset of m or fewer variables in 
 
 
 
  is statistically independent of the value of 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
A function 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -th order correlation immune if for any independent 
 
 
 
  binary random variables 
 
 
 
 , the random variable 
 
 
 
  is independent from any random vector 
 
 
 
  with
