   Yoshio Koide      Yoshio Koide   is a Japanese theoretical physicist specializing in particle physics. Koide is famous for his eponymous Koide formula , which some physicists think has great importance while other physicists contend that the formula is merely a numerical coincidence.  Koide earned in 1967 a B.Sc. with major in physics and in 1967 a M.Sc. in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics from Kanazawa University . In 1970, he received his Doctor of Science degree from Hiroshima University with a thesis “On the Two-Body Bound State Problem of Dirac Particles”. 1 After working as a postdoc in the physics department of Hiroshima University and then a postdoc in the applied mathematics department of Osaka University , he became, from 1972 to 1973, a Lecturer in the School of Science and Engineering, Kinki University , Osaka. Koide was Assistant Professor (1973-1977) then Associate Professor (1977-1987) of General Education, Shizuoka Women's University, Shizuoka . From April 1987 to March 2007 he was a Professor of Physics at University of Shizuoka , Shizuoka and then retired as professor emeritus. In 1986 he was a visiting professor at the University of Maryland and in 2002 a visiting researcher at CERN . Koide was from April 2007 to March 2009, a guest professor at Research Institute for Higher Education and Practice, Osaka University, then from April 2009 to March 2011 a guest professor and from April 2011 a guest researcher at Osaka University, and from April 2010 a professor, Department of Maskawa Institute, Kyoto Sangyo University , Kyoto.  In the composite model of mesons, Koide's thesis demonstrated that a mass   m   m   m   of a composite particle which consists of the rest masses     m  1   ,   m  2       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2     m_{1},m_{2}   cannot be lighter than     1  2    (    m  1   +   m  2    )         1  2      subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2      \frac{1}{2}(m_{1}+m_{2})   except for the case     m  1   =   m  2        subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2     m_{1}=m_{2}   when J P is not = 0 - . This offered a severe problem for the quark model. (Koide’s work was done before the establishment of QCD .) 2  Katuya and Koide predicted that lifetimes of D ± and D 0 should be considerably different from what was at that time the conventional anticipation tau(D ± )= tau(D 0 ). Their prediction of these lifetimes was the first in the world prior to the experimental observation. 3  He published the famous Koide formula in 1982 4 with a different presentation in 1983. 5  Originally, Koide's proposed charged lepton mass formula was based on a composite model of quarks and leptons. In a 1990 paper, from the standpoint that the charged leptons are elementary, by introducing a scalar boson with (octet + singlet) of a family symmetry U(3), Koide re-derived the charged lepton mass formula from minimizing conditions for the scalar potential. 6  In 2009, he related the neutrino mixing matrix to the up-quark mass matrix. 7  References  External links   physics papers by Y.
