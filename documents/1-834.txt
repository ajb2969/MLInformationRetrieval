   P-group      P-group   In mathematical group theory , given a prime number  p , a p -group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order . That is, for each element g of a p -group, there exists a nonnegative integer  n such that the product of p n copies of g is equal to the identity element . The orders of different elements may be different powers of p . Such groups are also called p -primary or simply primary .  A finite group is a p -group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p . Given a finite group G , the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power  p n that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order p n .  The remainder of this article deals with finite p -groups. For an example of an infinite abelian p -group, see Prüfer group , and for an example of an infinite simple p -group, see Tarski monster group .  Properties  Every p -group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order .  Non-trivial center  One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p -group cannot be the trivial subgroup ( proof ).  This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p -groups.  For instance, the normalizer  N of a proper subgroup  H of a finite p -group G properly contains H , because for any counterexample with H = N , the center Z is contained in N , and so also in H , but then there is a smaller example H / Z whose normalizer in G / Z is N / Z = H / Z , creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p -group is nilpotent .  In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p -group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p -group is central and has order p . Indeed, the socle of a finite p -group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p .  If G is a p -group, then so is G / Z , and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G / Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series . Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p -group with order p n contains normal subgroups of order p i with 0 ≤ i ≤ n , and any normal subgroup of order p i is contained in the i th center Z i . If a normal subgroup is not contained in Z i , then its intersection with Z i +1 has size at least p i +1 .  Automorphisms  The automorphism groups of p -groups are well studied. Just as every finite p -group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p -group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group . Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G /Φ( G ), where Φ( G ) is the Frattini subgroup of G . The quotient G/Φ( G ) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group , so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside , who showed that the kernel of this map is a p -group.  Examples  p -groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic ; for example, the cyclic group  C 4 and the Klein group  V 4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.  Nor need a p -group be abelian ; the dihedral group Dih 4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p 2 is abelian. 1  The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups . Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class , that is those groups of order 2 n +1 and nilpotency class n .  Iterated wreath products  The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p -groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W (1), and the wreath product of W ( n ) with W (1) as W ( n + 1). Then W ( n ) is the Sylow p -subgroup of the symmetric group Sym( p n ). Maximal p -subgroups of the general linear group GL( n , Q ) are direct products of various W ( n ). It has order p k where k = ( p n − 1)/( p − 1). It has nilpotency class p n −1 , and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent- p central series, and upper exponent- p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p , but its exponent is p n . The second such group, W (2), is also a p -group of maximal class, since it has order p p +1 and nilpotency class p , but is not a regular p -group . Since groups of order p p are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.  Generalized dihedral groups  When p = 2 and n = 2, W ( n ) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W ( n ) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2 n , but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive p th root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z [ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z . Form the semidirect product  E ( p ) of Z [ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers P n are normal subgroups of E ( p ), and the example groups are E ( p , n ) = E ( p )/ P n . E ( p , n ) has order p n +1 and nilpotency class n , so is a p -group of maximal class. When p = 2, E (2, n ) is the dihedral group of order 2 n . When p is odd, both W (2) and E ( p , p ) are irregular groups of maximal class and order p p +1 , but are not isomorphic.  Unitriangular matrix groups  The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e 1 , e 2 , …, e n } and define V i to be the vector space generated by { e i , e i +1 , …, e n } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n , and define V i = 0 when i > n . For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n , the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each V i to V i + m form a subgroup of Aut( V ) denoted U m . If V is a vector space over Z / p Z , then U 1 is a Sylow p -subgroup of Aut( V ) = GL( n , p ), and the terms of its lower central series are just the U m . In terms of matrices, U m are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m −1 superdiagonals. The group U 1 has order p n ·( n −1)/2 , nilpotency class n , and exponent p k where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p  logarithm of n .  Classification  The groups of order p n for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory , and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p 7 , though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend . An example is , which classifies groups of order      2  n   ,  n   ≤  6        superscript  2  n   n   6    2^{n},n\leq 6   .  Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite p -groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups .  An entirely different method classifies finite p -groups by their coclass , that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class . The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite p -groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups . The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups . The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite p -groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.  Every group of order p 5 is metabelian . 2  Up to p 3  The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group C p is the only group of order p . There are exactly two groups of order p 2 , both abelian, namely C p 2 and C p × C p .  There are three abelian groups of order p 3 , namely C p 3 , C p 2 × C p , and C p × C p × C p . There are also two non-abelian groups.  For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of C p × C p with C p , and the other is a semi-direct product of C p 2 with C p . The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3, p ) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p .  For p = 2 the both semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih 4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group  Q 8 .  Prevalence  Among groups  The number of isomorphism classes of groups of order p n grows as    p     2  27    n  3    +   O   (   n   8  /  3    )        superscript  p        2  27    superscript  n  3      O   superscript  n    8  3        p^{\frac{2}{27}n^{3}+O(n^{8/3})}   , and these are dominated by the classes that are two-step nilpotent . Because of this rapid growth, there is a folklore conjecture asserting that almost all finite groups are 2-groups: the fraction of isomorphism classes of 2-groups among isomorphism classes of groups of order at most n is thought to tend to 1 as n tends to infinity. For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, 49 487 365 422, or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024 .  Within a group  Every finite group whose order is divisible by p contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial p -group, namely a cyclic group of order p generated by an element of order p obtained from Cauchy's theorem . In fact, it contains a p -group of maximal possible order: if     |  G  |   =  n  =    p  k   m           G   n          superscript  p  k   m      |G|=n=p^{k}m   where p does not divide m, then G has a subgroup P of order     p  k   ,     superscript  p  k    p^{k},   called a Sylow p -subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any p -subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p -subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems .  Application to structure of a group  p -groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups . p -groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups. As subgroups, for a given prime p one has the Sylow p -subgroups P (largest p -subgroup not unique but all conjugate) and the p -core      O  p    (  G  )        subscript  O  p   G    O_{p}(G)   (the unique largest normal  p -subgroup), and various others. As quotients, the largest p -group quotient is the quotient of G by the p -residual subgroup       O  p    (  G  )    .       superscript  O  p   G    O^{p}(G).   These groups are related (for different primes), possess important properties such as the focal subgroup theorem , and allow one to determine many aspects of the structure of the group.  Local control  Much of the structure of a finite group is carried in the structure of its so-called local subgroups , the normalizers of non-identity p -subgroups .  The large elementary abelian subgroups of a finite group exert control over the group that was used in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem . Certain central extensions of elementary abelian groups called extraspecial groups help describe the structure of groups as acting symplectic vector spaces .  Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and Walter , Gorenstein , Bender , Suzuki , Glauberman , and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.
