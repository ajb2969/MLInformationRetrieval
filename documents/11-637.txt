Raucaffricine beta-glucosidase

In enzymology, a raucaffricine beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

raucaffricine + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + vomilenine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are raucaffricine and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and vomilenine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is raucaffricine beta-D-glucohydrolase. Other names in common use include raucaffricine beta-D-glucosidase, and raucaffricine glucosidase. This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.
