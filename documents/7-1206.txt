   Starred transform      Starred transform   In applied mathematics , the starred transform , or star transform , is a discrete-time variation of the Laplace transform , so-named because of the asterisk or "star" in the customary notation of the sampled signals. The transform is an operator of a continuous-time function    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   , which is transformed to a function  in the following manner: 1         X  *    (  s  )    =   ℒ   [     x   (  t  )    ⋅   δ  T     (  t  )    ]    =   ℒ   [    x  *    (  t  )    ]     ,           superscript  X    s     ℒ   delimited-[]     normal-⋅    x  t    subscript  δ  T    t            ℒ   delimited-[]     superscript  x    t        \displaystyle X^{*}(s)=\mathcal{L}[x(t)\cdot\delta_{T}(t)]=\mathcal{L}[x^{*}(t%
 )],     where is a Dirac comb function, with period of time T.  The starred transform is a convenient mathematical abstraction that represents the Laplace transform of an impulse sampled function , which is the output of an ideal sampler , whose input is a continuous function,    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   .  The starred transform is similar to the Z transform , with a simple change of variables, where the starred transform is explicitly declared in terms of the sampling period (T), while the Z transform is performed on a discrete signal and is independent of the sampling period. This makes the starred transform a de-normalized version of the one-sided Z-transform , as it restores the dependence on sampling parameter T .  Relation to Laplace transform  Since , where:        x  *    (  t  )      =  def       x   (  t  )    ⋅   δ  T     (  t  )        superscript   def      superscript  x    t      normal-⋅    x  t    subscript  δ  T    t     \displaystyle x^{*}(t)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ x(t)\cdot\delta_{T}(t)     Then per the convolution theorem , the starred transform is equivalent to the complex convolution of  and }}, hence: 2         X  *    (  s  )    =    1   2  π  j      ∫   c  -   j  ∞     c  +   j  ∞        X   (  p  )    ⋅   1   1  -   e   -   T   (   s  -  p   )        ⋅  d   p      .         superscript  X    s       1    2  π  j      superscript   subscript     c    j        c    j         normal-⋅    X  p     1    1   superscript  e      T    s  p        d   p       X^{*}(s)=\frac{1}{2\pi j}\int_{c-j\infty}^{c+j\infty}{X(p)\cdot\frac{1}{1-e^{-%
 T(s-p)}}\cdot dp}.     This line integration is equivalent to integration in the positive sense along a closed contour formed by such a line and an infinite semicircle that encloses the poles of X(s) in the left half-plane of p . The result of such an integration (per the residue theorem ) would be:         X  *    (  s  )    =    ∑   λ  =   poles of  X   (  s  )        Res   p  =  λ     [   X   (  p  )    1   1  -   e   -   T   (   s  -  p   )         ]      .         superscript  X    s     subscript     λ    poles of  X  s       subscript  Res    p  λ      X  p    1    1   superscript  e      T    s  p             X^{*}(s)=\sum_{\lambda=\text{poles of }X(s)}\operatorname{Res}\limits_{p=%
 \lambda}\bigg[X(p)\frac{1}{1-e^{-T(s-p)}}\bigg].   Alternatively, the aforementioned line integration is equivalent to integration in the negative sense along a closed contour formed by such a line and an infinite semicircle that encloses the infinite poles of }} in the right half-plane of p . The result of such an integration would be:         X  *    (  s  )    =     1  T     ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    X   (   s  -   j     2  π   T    k    )      +    x   (  0  )    2     .         superscript  X    s         1  T     superscript   subscript     k            X    s    j      2  π   T   k           x  0   2      X^{*}(s)=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X\left(s-j\tfrac{2\pi}{T}k\right)%
 +\frac{x(0)}{2}.     Relation to Z transform  Given a Z-transform , X ( z ), the corresponding starred transform is a simple substitution :      .   X  *    (  s  )   =  X   (  z  )    |   z  =   e   s  T         fragments  normal-.   superscript  X     fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    X   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)    subscript  normal-|    z   superscript  e    s  T        \bigg.X^{*}(s)=X(z)\bigg|_{\displaystyle z=e^{sT}}    3  This substitution restores the dependence on T .  Properties of the starred transform  Property 1:      X  *    (  s  )        superscript  X    s    X^{*}(s)   is periodic in   s   s   s   with period     j    2  π   T    .      j      2  π   T     j\tfrac{2\pi}{T}.           X  *    (   s  +   j     2  π   T    k    )    =    X  *    (  s  )           superscript  X      s    j      2  π   T   k        superscript  X    s     X^{*}(s+j\tfrac{2\pi}{T}k)=X^{*}(s)     Property 2: If has a pole at    s  =   s  1       s   subscript  s  1     s=s_{1}   , then  must have poles at    s  =    s  1   +   j    2  π   T   k        s     subscript  s  1     j      2  π   T   k      s=s_{1}+j\tfrac{2\pi}{T}k   , where    k  =   0  ,   ±  1   ,   ±  2   ,  …       k   0   plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  2   normal-…     \scriptstyle k=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots     Citations  References         Phillips and Nagle, "Digital Control System Analysis and Design", 3rd Edition, Prentice Hall, 1995.
