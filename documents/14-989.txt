   Cartesian monoid      Cartesian monoid   A Cartesian monoid is a monoid , with additional structure of pairing and projection operators. It was first formulated by Dana Scott and Joachim Lambek independently. 1  Definition  A Cartesian monoid is a structure with signature     ⟨  *  ,  e  ,   (  -  ,  -  )   ,  L  ,  R  ⟩      e      L  R    \langle*,e,(-,-),L,R\rangle   where   *     *   and    (  -  ,  -  )         (-,-)   are binary operations ,    L  ,  R     L  R    L,R   , and   e   e   e   are constants satisfying the following axioms for all    x  ,  y  ,  z     x  y  z    x,y,z   in its universe :   Monoid    *     *   is a monoid with identity   e   e   e     Left Projection      L  *   (  x  ,  y  )    =  x        L   x  y    x    L*(x,\,y)=x     Right Projection      R  *   (  x  ,  y  )    =  y        R   x  y    y    R*(x,\,y)=y     Surjective Pairing      (   L  *  x   ,   R  *  x   )   =  x         L  x     R  x    x    (L*x,\,R*x)=x     Right Homogeneity      (   x  *  z   ,   y  *  z   )   =    (  x  ,  y  )   *  z          x  z     y  z       x  y   z     (x*z,\,y*z)=(x,\,y)*z      The interpretation is that   L   L   L   and   R   R   R   are left and right projection functions respectively for the pairing function    (  -  ,  -  )         (-,-)   .
