A Cartesian monoid is a monoid, with additional structure of pairing and projection operators. It was first formulated by Dana Scott and Joachim Lambek independently.1
Definition
A Cartesian monoid is a structure with signature

 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are binary operations, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are constants satisfying the following axioms for all

Left Projection


Right Projection


Surjective Pairing


Right Homogeneity



The interpretation is that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are left and right projection functions respectively for the pairing function
