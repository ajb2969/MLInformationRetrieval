   Pantetheine hydrolase      Pantetheine hydrolase   In enzymology , a pantetheine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-pantetheine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-pantothenate + 2-aminoethanethiol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-pantetheine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (R)-pantothenate and 2-aminoethanethiol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-pantetheine amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include pantetheinase , vanin , and vanin-1 . This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .  References           "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
