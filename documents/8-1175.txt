Metric derivative

In mathematics, the metric derivative is a notion of derivative appropriate to parametrized paths in metric spaces. It generalizes the notion of "speed" or "absolute velocity" to spaces which have a notion of distance (i.e. metric spaces) but not direction (such as vector spaces).
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a metric space. Let 
 
 
 
  have a limit point at 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a path. Then the metric derivative of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
 , is defined by



if this limit exists.
Properties
Recall that ACp(I; X) is the space of curves γ : I → X such that



for some m in the Lp space Lp(I; R). For γ ∈ ACp(I; X), the metric derivative of γ exists for Lebesgue-almost all times in I, and the metric derivative is the smallest m ∈ Lp(I; R) such that the above inequality holds.
If Euclidean space

 
  is equipped with its usual Euclidean norm 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the usual Fréchet derivative with respect to time, then



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the Euclidean metric.
