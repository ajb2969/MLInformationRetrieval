Rectified Gaussian distribution

In probability theory, the rectified Gaussian distribution is a modification of the Gaussian distribution when its negative elements are reset to 0 (analogous to an electronic rectifier). It is essentially a mixture of a discrete distribution (constant 0) and a continuous distribution (a truncated Gaussian distribution with interval 
 
 
 
 ).
Density function
The probability density function of a rectified Gaussian distribution, for which random variables X having this distribution are displayed as 
 
 
 
 , is given by


 
   Here, 
 
 
 
  is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the standard normal distribution:



 
  is the Dirac delta function


 
  and, 
 
 
 
  is the unit step function:



Alternative form
Often, a simpler alternative form is to consider a case, where,


 
  then,



Application
A rectified Gaussian distribution is semi-conjugate to the Gaussian likelihood, and it has been recently applied to factor analysis, or particularly, (non-negative) rectified factor analysis. Harva 1 proposed a variational learning algorithm for the rectified factor model, where the factors follow a mixture of rectified Gaussian; and later Meng 2 proposed an infinite rectified factor model coupled with its Gibbs sampling solution, where the factors follow a Dirichlet process mixture of rectified Gaussian distribution, and applied it in computational biology for reconstruction of gene regulatory network.
