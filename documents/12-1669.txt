Piezoelectric coefficient

Piezoelectric coefficient or Piezoelectric Modulus, aka D33, quantifies the volume change when a piezoelectric material is subject to an electric field, or the polarization on application of a stress
 
 
 
  where P is polarization, and 
 
 
 
  is the stress.
There are actually many Piezoelectric coefficients: Dxy.
