   Piezoelectric coefficient      Piezoelectric coefficient   Piezoelectric coefficient or Piezoelectric Modulus, aka D 33 , quantifies the volume change when a piezoelectric material is subject to an electric field , or the polarization on application of a stress    d  =   P  σ       d    P  σ     d=\dfrac{P}{\sigma}   where P is polarization, and   σ   σ   \sigma   is the stress.  There are actually many Piezoelectric coefficients: D xy .  See Piezoelectricity#Mechanism .
