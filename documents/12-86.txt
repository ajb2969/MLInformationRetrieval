   Hilbert C*-module      Hilbert C*-module  Hilbert C*-modules are mathematical objects which generalise the notion of a Hilbert space (which itself is a generalisation of Euclidean space ), in that they endow a linear space with an " inner product " which takes values in a C*-algebra . Hilbert C*-modules were first introduced in the work of Irving Kaplansky in 1953 , which developed the theory for commutative , unital algebras (though Kaplansky observed that the assumption of a unit element was not "vital"). 1 In the 1970s the theory was extended to non-commutative C*-algebras independently by William Lindall Paschke 2 and Marc Rieffel , the latter in a paper which used Hilbert C*-modules to construct a theory of induced representations of C*-algebras. 3 Hilbert C*-modules are crucial to Kasparov's formulation of KK-theory , 4 and provide the right framework to extend the notion of Morita equivalence to C*-algebras . 5 They can be viewed as the generalization of vector bundles to noncommutative C*-algebras and as such play an important role in noncommutative geometry , notably in C*-algebraic quantum group theory , 6 7 and groupoid  C*-algebras .  Definitions  Inner-product A -modules  Let A be a C*-algebra (not assumed to be commutative or unital), its involution denoted by *. An inner-product A -module (or pre-Hilbert A -module ) is a complex linear space E which is equipped with a compatible right A -module structure, together with a map       ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩   :    E  ×  E   →  A      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    E  E   A     \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:E\times E\rightarrow A   which satisfies the following properties:   For all x , y , z in E , and α, β in C :          ⟨  x  ,    α  y   +   β  z    ⟩   =    α   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩    +   β   ⟨  x  ,  z  ⟩          x      α  y     β  z         α   x  y      β   x  z       \langle x,\alpha y+\beta z\rangle=\alpha\langle x,y\rangle+\beta\langle x,z\rangle         ( i.e. the inner product is linear in its second argument).    For all x , y in E , and a in A :          ⟨  x  ,   y  a   ⟩   =    ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   a        x    y  a       x  y   a     \langle x,ya\rangle=\langle x,y\rangle a         For all x , y in E :           ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   =    ⟨  y  ,  x  ⟩   *    ,       x  y    superscript   y  x       \langle x,y\rangle=\langle y,x\rangle^{*},         from which it follows that the inner product is conjugate linear in its first argument ( i.e. it is a sesquilinear form ).    For all x in E :          ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩   ≥  0       x  x   0    \langle x,x\rangle\geq 0         and           ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩   =  0   ⇔   x  =  0.      iff     x  x   0     x  0.     \langle x,x\rangle=0\iff x=0.         (An element of a C*-algebra A is said to be positive if it is self-adjoint with non-negative spectrum .) 8 9    Hilbert A -modules  An analogue to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds for an inner-product A -module E : 10        ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩    ⟨  y  ,  x  ⟩    ≤    ∥   ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩   ∥    ⟨  y  ,  y  ⟩           x  y    y  x       norm   x  x     y  y      \langle x,y\rangle\langle y,x\rangle\leq\|\langle x,x\rangle\|\langle y,y\rangle     for x , y in E .  On the pre-Hilbert module E , define a norm by        ∥  x  ∥   =    ∥   ⟨  x  ,  x  ⟩   ∥    1  2     .       norm  x    superscript   norm   x  x      1  2      \|x\|=\|\langle x,x\rangle\|^{\frac{1}{2}}.     The norm-completion of E , still denoted by E , is said to be a Hilbert A -module or a Hilbert C*-module over the C*-algebra A . The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies the inner product is jointly continuous in norm and can therefore be extended to the completion.  The action of A on E is continuous: for all x in E        a  λ   →  a  ⇒   x   a  λ    →   x  a    .       normal-→   subscript  a  λ   a    normal-⇒      x   subscript  a  λ      normal-→      x  a      a_{\lambda}\rightarrow a\Rightarrow xa_{\lambda}\rightarrow xa.     Similarly, if { e λ } is an approximate unit for A (a net of self-adjoint elements of A for which ae λ and e λ a tend to a for each a in A ), then for x in E       x   e  λ    →  x     normal-→    x   subscript  e  λ    x    xe_{\lambda}\rightarrow x     whence it follows that EA is dense in E , and x 1 = x when A is unital.  Let        ⟨  E  ,  E  ⟩   =   span   {   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   |  x  ,   y  ∈  E   }     ,       E  E    span   x  y   x    y  E      \langle E,E\rangle=\operatorname{span}\{\langle x,y\rangle|x,y\in E\},     then the closure of  is a two-sided ideal in A . Two-sided ideals are C*-subalgebras and therefore possess approximate units. One can verify that E is dense in E . In the case when  is dense in A , E is said to be full . This does not generally hold.  Examples  Hilbert spaces  A complex Hilbert space H is a Hilbert C -module under its inner product, the complex numbers being a C*-algebra with an involution given by complex conjugation .  Vector bundles  If X is a locally compact Hausdorff space and E a vector bundle over X with a Riemannian metric  g , then the space of continuous sections of E is a Hilbert C(X) -module. The inner product is given by           ⟨  f  ,  h  ⟩    (  x  )    :=   g   (   f   (  x  )    ,   h   (  x  )    )     .     assign     f  h   x     g     f  x     h  x       \langle f,h\rangle(x):=g(f(x),h(x)).        The converse holds as well: Every countably generated Hilbert C*-module over a commutative C*-algebra A = C(X) is isomorphic to the space of sections vanishing at infinity of a continuous field of Hilbert spaces over X .  C*-algebras  Any C*-algebra A is a Hilbert A -module under the inner product  = a * b . By the C*-identity, the Hilbert module norm coincides with C*-norm on A .  The (algebraic) direct sum of n copies of A       A  n   =    ⊕  1  n   A        superscript  A  n     superscript   subscript  direct-sum  1   n   A     A^{n}=\oplus_{1}^{n}A     can be made into a Hilbert A -module by defining        ⟨   (   a  i   )   ,   (   b  i   )   ⟩   =   ∑    a  i  *    b  i      .        subscript  a  i    subscript  b  i         superscript   subscript  a  i      subscript  b  i       \langle(a_{i}),(b_{i})\rangle=\sum a_{i}^{*}b_{i}.     One may also consider the following elements in the countable direct product of A        ℋ  A   =   {   (   a  i   )   |   ∑    a  i  *    a  i   converges in  A    }    .       subscript  ℋ  A    conditional-set   subscript  a  i        superscript   subscript  a  i      subscript  a  i   converges in  A       \mathcal{H}_{A}=\{(a_{i})|\sum a_{i}^{*}a_{i}\text{ converges in }A\}.     Given an inner product analogous to that on A n , the resulting Hilbert A -module is called the standard Hilbert module .
