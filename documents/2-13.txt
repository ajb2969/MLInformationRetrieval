   Wave function collapse      Wave function collapse   In quantum mechanics , wave function collapse is said to occur when a wave function ‚Äîinitially in a superposition of several eigenstates ‚Äîappears to reduce to a single eigenstate (by "observation"). It is the essence of measurement in quantum mechanics and connects the wave function with classical observables like position and momentum . Collapse is one of two processes by which quantum systems evolve in time; the other is continuous evolution via the Schr√∂dinger equation . 1 However, in this role, collapse is merely a black box for thermodynamically irreversible interaction with a classical environment. 2 3 Calculations of quantum decoherence predict apparent wave function collapse when a superposition forms between the quantum system's states and the environment's states. Significantly, the combined wave function of the system and environment continue to obey the Schr√∂dinger equation . 4  In 1927, Werner Heisenberg used the idea of wave function reduction to explain quantum measurement. 5 Nevertheless, it was debated, for if collapse were a fundamental physical phenomenon, rather than just the epiphenomenon of some other process, it would mean nature was fundamentally stochastic , i.e. nondeterministic , an undesirable property for a theory. 6 7 This issue remained until quantum decoherence entered mainstream opinion after its reformulation in the 1980s. 8 9 10 Decoherence explains the perception of wave function collapse in terms of interacting large- and small-scale quantum systems, and is commonly taught at the graduate level (e.g. the Cohen-Tannoudji textbook). 11 The quantum filtering approach 12 13 14 and the introduction of quantum causality non-demolition principle 15 allows for a classical-environment derivation of wave function collapse from the stochastic Schr√∂dinger equation .  Mathematical description  Before collapse, the wave function may be any square-integrable function. This function is expressible as a linear combination of the eigenstates of any observable . Observables represent classical dynamical variables, and when one is measured by a classical observer , the wave function is projected onto a random eigenstate of that observable. The observer simultaneously measures the classical value of that observable to be the eigenvalue of the final state. 16  Mathematical background  The quantum state of a physical system is described by a wave function (in turn ‚Äì an element of a projective  Hilbert space ). This can be expressed in Dirac or bra‚Äìket notation as a vector:        |  œà  ‚ü©   =    ‚àë  i     c  i    |   œï  i   ‚ü©      .       ket  œà     subscript   i      subscript  c  i    ket   subscript  œï  i        |\psi\rangle=\sum_{i}c_{i}|\phi_{i}\rangle.     The kets     |   œï  1   ‚ü©   ,   |   œï  2   ‚ü©   ,    |   œï  3   ‚ü©   ‚ãØ       ket   subscript  œï  1     ket   subscript  œï  2       ket   subscript  œï  3    normal-‚ãØ     \scriptstyle{|\phi_{1}\rangle,|\phi_{2}\rangle,|\phi_{3}\rangle\cdots}   , specify the different quantum "alternatives" available - a particular quantum state. They form an orthonormal  eigenvector  basis , formally        ‚ü®   œï  i   |   œï  j   ‚ü©   =   Œ¥   i  j     .       inner-product   subscript  œï  i    subscript  œï  j     subscript  Œ¥    i  j      \langle\phi_{i}|\phi_{j}\rangle=\delta_{ij}.   Where    Œ¥   i  j      subscript  Œ¥    i  j     \delta_{ij}   represents the Kronecker delta .  An observable (i.e. measurable parameter of the system) is associated with each eigenbasis, with each quantum alternative having a specific value or eigenvalue , e i , of the observable. A "measurable parameter of the system" could be the usual position r and the momentum p of (say) a particle, but also its energy E , z-components of spin ( s z ), orbital ( L z ) and total angular ( J z ) momenta etc. In the basis representation these are respectively      |   ùê´  ,  t   ‚ü©   =    |   x  ,  t   ‚ü©   +   |   y  ,  t   ‚ü©   +   |   z  ,  t   ‚ü©     ,    |   ùê©  ,  t   ‚ü©   =     |    p  x   ,  t   ‚ü©   +   |    p  y   ,  t   ‚ü©   +   |    p  z   ,  t   ‚ü©    ,   |  E  ‚ü©   ,   |   s  z   ‚ü©   ,   |   L  z   ‚ü©   ,   |   J  z   ‚ü©   ,  ‚ãØ       formulae-sequence     ket   ùê´  t       ket   x  t     ket   y  t     ket   z  t         ket   ùê©  t        ket    subscript  p  x   t     ket    subscript  p  y   t     ket    subscript  p  z   t      ket  E    ket   subscript  s  z     ket   subscript  L  z     ket   subscript  J  z    normal-‚ãØ      \scriptstyle{|\mathbf{r},t\rangle=|x,t\rangle+|y,t\rangle+|z,t\rangle,|\mathbf%
 {p},t\rangle=|p_{x},t\rangle+|p_{y},t\rangle+|p_{z},t\rangle,|E\rangle,|s_{z}%
 \rangle,|L_{z}\rangle,|J_{z}\rangle,\cdots}   .  The coefficients c 1 , c 2 , c 3 ... are the probability amplitudes corresponding to each basis     |   œï  1   ‚ü©   ,   |   œï  2   ‚ü©   ,    |   œï  3   ‚ü©   ‚ãØ       ket   subscript  œï  1     ket   subscript  œï  2       ket   subscript  œï  3    normal-‚ãØ     \scriptstyle{|\phi_{1}\rangle,|\phi_{2}\rangle,|\phi_{3}\rangle\cdots}   . These are complex numbers . The moduli square of c i , that is | c i | 2 = c i * c i (* denotes complex conjugate ), is the probability of measuring the system to be in the state    |   œï  i   ‚ü©     ket   subscript  œï  i     \scriptstyle|\phi_{i}\rangle   .  For simplicity in the following, all wave functions are assumed to be normalized ; the total probability of measuring all possible states is unity:       ‚ü®  œà  |  œà  ‚ü©   =    ‚àë  i     |   c  i   |   2    =  1.         inner-product  œà  œà     subscript   i    superscript     subscript  c  i    2         1.     \langle\psi|\psi\rangle=\sum_{i}|c_{i}|^{2}=1.     The process  With these definitions it is easy to describe the process of collapse. For any observable, the wave function is initially some linear combination of the eigenbasis    {   |   œï  i   ‚ü©   }      ket   subscript  œï  i      \{|\phi_{i}\rangle\}   of that observable. When an external agency (an observer, experimenter) measures the observable associated with the eigenbasis    {   |   œï  i   ‚ü©   }      ket   subscript  œï  i      \{|\phi_{i}\rangle\}   , the wave function collapses from the full    |  œà  ‚ü©     ket  œà    |\psi\rangle   to just one of the basis eigenstates,    |   œï  i   ‚ü©     ket   subscript  œï  i     |\phi_{i}\rangle   , that is:        |  œà  ‚ü©   ‚Üí   |   œï  i   ‚ü©    .     normal-‚Üí   ket  œà    ket   subscript  œï  i      |\psi\rangle\rightarrow|\phi_{i}\rangle.     The probability of collapsing to a given eigenstate    |   œï  k   ‚ü©     ket   subscript  œï  k     |\phi_{k}\rangle   is the Born probability ,     P  k   =    |   c  k   |   2        subscript  P  k    superscript     subscript  c  k    2     P_{k}=|c_{k}|^{2}   . Post-measurement, other elements of the wave function vector,    c   i  ‚â†  k      subscript  c    i  k     c_{i\neq k}   , have "collapsed" to zero, and     c  k   =  1       subscript  c  k   1    c_{k}=1   .  More generally, collapse is defined for an operator    Q  ^     normal-^  Q    \hat{Q}   with eigenbasis    {  |   œï  i    \rang   }     fragments  normal-{  normal-|   subscript  œï  i   \rang  normal-}    \{|\phi_{i}\rang\}   . If the system is in state    |  œà   \rang      fragments  normal-|  œà  \rang    |\psi\rang   , and    Q  ^     normal-^  Q    \hat{Q}   is measured, the probability of collapsing the system to state    |   œï  i    \rang      fragments  normal-|   subscript  œï  i   \rang    |\phi_{i}\rang   (and measuring    |   œï  i    \rang      fragments  normal-|   subscript  œï  i   \rang    |\phi_{i}\rang   ) would be    |   \lang   œà  |   œï  i    \rang    |  2      fragments  normal-|  \lang  œà  normal-|   subscript  œï  i   \rang   superscript  normal-|  2     |\lang\psi|\phi_{i}\rang|^{2}   . Note that this is not the probability that the particle is in state    |   œï  i   ‚ü©     ket   subscript  œï  i     |\phi_{i}\rangle   ; it is in state    |  œà   \rang      fragments  normal-|  œà  \rang    |\psi\rang   until cast to an eigenstate of    Q  ^     normal-^  Q    \hat{Q}   .  However, we never observe collapse to a single eigenstate of a continuous-spectrum operator (e.g. position , momentum , or a scattering  Hamiltonian ), because such eigenfunctions are non-normalizable. In these cases, the wave function will partially collapse to a linear combination of "close" eigenstates (necessarily involving a spread in eigenvalues) that embodies the imprecision of the measurement apparatus. The more precise the measurement, the tighter the range. Calculation of probability proceeds identically, except with an integral over the expansion coefficient    c   (  q  ,  t  )   d  q      c   q  t   d  q    c(q,t)dq   . 17 This phenomenon is unrelated to the uncertainty principle , although increasingly precise measurements of one operator (e.g. position) will naturally homogenize the expansion coefficient of wave function with respect to another, incompatible operator (e.g. momentum), lowering the probability of measuring any particular value of the latter.  The determination of preferred-basis  The complete set of orthogonal functions which a wave function will collapse to is also called preferred-basis. 18 There lacks theoretical foundation for the preferred-basis to be the eigenstates of observables such as position , momentum , etc. In fact the eigenstates of position are not even physical due to the infinite energy associated with them. A better approach is to derive the preferred-basis from basic principles. It is proved that only special dynamic equation can collapse the wave function. 19 By applying one axiom of the quantum mechanics and the assumption that preferred-basis depends on the total Hamiltonian , a unique set of equations is obtained from the collapse equation which determines the preferred-basis for general situations. Depending on the system Hamiltonian and wave function , the determination equations may yield preferred-basis as energy eigenfunctions , quasi-position eigenfunctions , mixed energy and quasi-position eigenfunctions , i.e., energy eigenfunctions for the interior of a macroscopic object and quasi-position eigenfunctions for the particles on the surface, and so on.  Quantum decoherence  Wave function collapse is not fundamental from the perspective of quantum decoherence . 20 There are several equivalent approaches to deriving collapse, like the density matrix approach , but each has the same effect: decoherence irreversibly converts the "averaged" or "environmentally traced over" density matrix from a pure state to a reduced mixture, giving the appearance of wave function collapse.  History and context  The concept of wavefunction collapse was introduced by Werner Heisenberg in his 1927 paper on the uncertainty principle , "√úber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematic und Mechanik", and incorporated into the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics by John von Neumann , in his 1932 treatise Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik . 21 Consistent with Heisenberg, von Neumann postulated that there were two processes of wave function change:   The probabilistic , non- unitary , non-local , discontinuous change brought about by observation and measurement , as outlined above.  The deterministic , unitary, continuous time evolution of an isolated system that obeys the Schr√∂dinger equation (or a relativistic equivalent, i.e. the Dirac equation ).   In general, quantum systems exist in superpositions of those basis states that most closely correspond to classical descriptions, and, in the absence of measurement, evolve according to the Schr√∂dinger equation. However, when a measurement is made, the wave function collapses‚Äîfrom an observer's perspective‚Äîto just one of the basis states, and the property being measured uniquely acquires the eigenvalue of that particular state,    Œª  i     subscript  Œª  i    \lambda_{i}   . After the collapse, the system again evolves according to the Schr√∂dinger equation.  By explicitly dealing with the interaction of object and measuring instrument , von Neumann 22 has attempted to create consistency of the two processes of wave function change.  He was able to prove the possibility of a quantum mechanical measurement scheme consistent with wave function collapse. However, he did not prove the necessity of such a collapse. Although von Neumann's projection postulate is often presented as a normative description of quantum measurement, it was conceived by taking into account experimental evidence available during the 1930s (in particular the Compton-Simon experiment was paradigmatic), but many important present-day measurement procedures do not satisfy it (so-called measurements of the second kind). 23 24 25  The existence of the wave function collapse is required in   the Copenhagen interpretation  the objective collapse interpretations  the transactional interpretation  the von Neumann interpretation in which consciousness causes collapse .   On the other hand, the collapse is considered a redundant or optional approximation in   the Consistent histories approach, self-dubbed "Copenhagen done right"  the Bohm interpretation  the Many-worlds interpretation  the Ensemble Interpretation   The cluster of phenomena described by the expression wave function collapse is a fundamental problem in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and is known as the measurement problem . The problem is deflected by the Copenhagen Interpretation, which postulates that this is a special characteristic of the "measurement" process. Everett 's many-worlds interpretation deals with it by discarding the collapse-process, thus reformulating the relation between measurement apparatus and system in such a way that the linear laws of quantum mechanics are universally valid; that is, the only process according to which a quantum system evolves is governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation or some relativistic equivalent.  Originating from de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory, but no longer tied to it, is the physical process of decoherence , which causes an apparent collapse. Decoherence is also important for the consistent histories interpretation. A general description of the evolution of quantum mechanical systems is possible by using density operators and quantum operations . In this formalism (which is closely related to the C*-algebraic formalism) the collapse of the wave function corresponds to a non-unitary quantum operation.  The significance ascribed to the wave function varies from interpretation to interpretation, and varies even within an interpretation (such as the Copenhagen Interpretation). If the wave function merely encodes an observer's knowledge of the universe then the wave function collapse corresponds to the receipt of new information. This is somewhat analogous to the situation in classical physics, except that the classical "wave function" does not necessarily obey a wave equation. If the wave function is physically real, in some sense and to some extent, then the collapse of the wave function is also seen as a real process, to the same extent.
