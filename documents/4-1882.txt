   Markov blanket      Markov blanket   (Figure)  In a Bayesian network, the Markov blanket of node A includes its parents, children and the other parents of all of its children.   In machine learning , the Markov blanket for a node    A   A   A   in a Bayesian network is the set of nodes    ∂  A      A    \partial A   composed of   A   A   A   's parents, its children, and its children's other parents. In a Markov network , the Markov blanket of a node is its set of neighboring nodes. A Markov blanket may also be denoted by    M  B   (  A  )       M  B  A    MB(A)   .  Every set of nodes in the network is conditionally independent of   A   A   A   when conditioned on the set    ∂  A      A    \partial A   , that is, when conditioned on the Markov blanket of the node   A   A   A   . The probability has the Markov property ; formally, for distinct nodes   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   :        Pr   (  A  ∣   ∂  A   ,  B  )    =   Pr   (  A  ∣   ∂  A   )     .       Pr  A    A   B    Pr  A    A      \Pr(A\mid\partial A,B)=\Pr(A\mid\partial A).\!     The Markov blanket of a node contains all the variables that shield the node from the rest of the network. This means that the Markov blanket of a node is the only knowledge needed to predict the behavior of that node. The term was coined by Pearl in 1988. 1  In a Bayesian network, the values of the parents and children of a node evidently give information about that node; however, its children's parents also have to be included, because they can be used to explain away the node in question. In a Markov random field, the Markov blanket for a node is simply its adjacent nodes.
