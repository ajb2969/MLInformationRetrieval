In a Bayesian network, the Markov blanket of node A includes its parents, children and the other parents of all of its children.

In machine learning, the Markov blanket for a node

 
  in a Bayesian network is the set of nodes 
 
 
 
  composed of 
 
 
 
 's parents, its children, and its children's other parents. In a Markov network, the Markov blanket of a node is its set of neighboring nodes. A Markov blanket may also be denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Every set of nodes in the network is conditionally independent of 
 
 
 
  when conditioned on the set 
 
 
 
 , that is, when conditioned on the Markov blanket of the node 
 
 
 
 . The probability has the Markov property; formally, for distinct nodes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



The Markov blanket of a node contains all the variables that shield the node from the rest of the network. This means that the Markov blanket of a node is the only knowledge needed to predict the behavior of that node. The term was coined by  Pearl in 1988.1
In a Bayesian network, the values of the parents and children of a node evidently give information about that node; however, its children's parents also have to be included, because they can be used to explain away the node in question. In a Markov random field, the Markov blanket for a node is simply its adjacent nodes.
