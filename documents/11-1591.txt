   Pyridoxal kinase      Pyridoxal kinase   In enzymology , a pyridoxal kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + pyridoxal   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + pyridoxal 5'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and pyridoxal , whereas its two products are ADP and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:pyridoxal 5'-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include pyridoxal kinase (phosphorylating) , pyridoxal 5-phosphate-kinase , pyridoxal phosphokinase , and pyridoxine kinase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 15 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
