Chebyshev's sum inequality

In mathematics, Chebyshev's sum inequality, named after Pafnuty Chebyshev, states that if



and



then



Similarly, if



and



then

Proof
Consider the sum



The two sequences are non-increasing, therefore  and  have the same sign for any 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 .
Opening the brackets, we deduce:



whence



An alternative proof is simply obtained with the rearrangement inequality.
Continuous version
There is also a continuous version of Chebyshev's sum inequality:
If f and g are real-valued, integrable functions over [0,1], both non-increasing or both non-decreasing, then



with the inequality reversed if one is non-increasing and the other is non-decreasing.
