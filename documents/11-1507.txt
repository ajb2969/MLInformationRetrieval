   Glycerone kinase      Glycerone kinase   In enzymology , a glycerone kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + glycerone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + glycerone phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and glycerone , whereas its two products are ADP and glycerone phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:glycerone phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include dihydroxyacetone kinase , acetol kinase , and acetol kinase (phosphorylating) . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
