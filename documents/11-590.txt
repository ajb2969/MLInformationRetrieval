   1,2-alpha-L-fucosidase      1,2-alpha-L-fucosidase   In enzymology , a 1,2-alpha-L-fucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methyl-2-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl-beta-D-galactoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-fucose + methyl beta-D-galactoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methyl-2-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl-beta-D-galactoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-fucose and methyl beta-D-galactoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl-beta-D-galactoside fucohydrolase . Other names in common use include almond emulsin fucosidase , and alpha-(1->2)-L-fucosidase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
