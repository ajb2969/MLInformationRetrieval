   (cytochrome c)-lysine N-methyltransferase      (cytochrome c)-lysine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a [cytochrome c]-lysine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [cytochrome c]-L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [cytochrome c]-N 6 -methyl-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and cytochrome c -L- lysine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and cytochrome c - N6-methyl-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[cytochrome c]-L-lysine N6-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include cytochrome c (lysine) methyltransferase , cytochrome c methyltransferase , cytochrome c-specific protein methylase III , cytochrome c-specific protein-lysine methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[cytochrome c]-L-lysine , and 6-N-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References       "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
