   Fractional-order system      Fractional-order system   In the fields of dynamical systems and control theory , a fractional-order system is a dynamical system that can be modeled by a fractional differential equation containing derivatives of non-integer order . 1 Fractional-order systems are useful in in studying the anomalous behavior of dynamical systems in electrochemistry, biology, viscoelasticity and chaotic systems. 2  Definition  A general dynamical system of fractional order can be written in the form 3       H   (   D    α  1   ,   α  2   ,  …  ,   α  m     )    (   y  1   ,   y  2   ,  …  ,   y  l   )    =   G   (   D    β  1   ,   β  2   ,  …  ,   β  n     )    (   u  1   ,   u  2   ,  …  ,   u  k   )          H   superscript  D    subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2   normal-…   subscript  α  m       subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-…   subscript  y  l       G   superscript  D    subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2   normal-…   subscript  β  n       subscript  u  1    subscript  u  2   normal-…   subscript  u  k       H(D^{\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{m}})(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{l})=G(D^{%
 \beta_{1},\beta_{2},\ldots,\beta_{n}})(u_{1},u_{2},\ldots,u_{k})     where   H   H   H   and   G   G   G   are functions of the fractional derivative operator of orders     α  1   ,   α  2   ,  …  ,   α  m       subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2   normal-…   subscript  α  m     \alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{m}   and     β  1   ,   β  2   ,  …  ,   β  n       subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2   normal-…   subscript  β  n     \beta_{1},\beta_{2},\ldots,\beta_{n}   and    y  i     subscript  y  i    y_{i}   and    u  j     subscript  u  j    u_{j}   are functions of time. A common special case of this is the linear time-invariant (LTI) system in one variable:        (    ∑   k  =  0   m     a  k    D   α  k      )   y   (  t  )    =    (    ∑   k  =  0   n     b  k    D   β  k      )   u   (  t  )            superscript   subscript     k  0    m      subscript  a  k    superscript  D   subscript  α  k      y  t       superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  b  k    superscript  D   subscript  β  k      u  t     \left(\sum_{k=0}^{m}a_{k}D^{\alpha_{k}}\right)y(t)=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_{k}D^%
 {\beta_{k}}\right)u(t)     The orders    α  k     subscript  α  k    \alpha_{k}   and    β  k     subscript  β  k    \beta_{k}   are in general complex quantities, but two interesting cases are when the orders are commensurate         α  k   ,   β  k    =   k  δ    ,   δ  ∈   R  +       formulae-sequence      subscript  α  k    subscript  β  k      k  δ      δ   superscript  R       \alpha_{k},\beta_{k}=k\delta,\quad\delta\in R^{+}     and when they are also rational :         α  k   ,   β  k    =   k  δ    ,    δ  =   1  q    ,   q  ∈   Z  +        formulae-sequence      subscript  α  k    subscript  β  k      k  δ     formulae-sequence    δ    1  q      q   superscript  Z        \alpha_{k},\beta_{k}=k\delta,\quad\delta=\frac{1}{q},q\in Z^{+}     When    q  =  1      q  1    q=1   , the derivatives are of integer order and the system becomes an ordinary differential equation. Thus by increasing specialization, LTI systems can be of general order, commensurate order, rational order or integer order.  Transfer function  By applying a Laplace transform to the LTI system above, the transfer function becomes       G   (  s  )    =    Y   (  s  )     U   (  s  )     =     ∑   k  =  0   n     b  k    s   β  k        ∑   k  =  0   m     a  k    s   α  k               G  s       Y  s     U  s             superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  b  k    superscript  s   subscript  β  k        superscript   subscript     k  0    m      subscript  a  k    superscript  s   subscript  α  k          G(s)=\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_{k}s^{\beta_{k}}}{\sum_{k=0}^{m}a%
 _{k}s^{\alpha_{k}}}     For general orders    α  k     subscript  α  k    \alpha_{k}   and    β  k     subscript  β  k    \beta_{k}   this is a non-rational transfer function. Non-rational transfer functions cannot be written as an expansion in a finite number of terms (e.g., a binomial expansion would have an infinite number of terms) and in this sense fractional orders systems can be said to have the potential for unlimited memory. 4  Motivation to study fractional-order system  Exponential laws are classical approach to study dynamics of population densities, but there are many systems where dynamics undergo faster or slower-than-exponential laws. In such case the anomalous changes in dynamics may be best described by Mittag-Leffler functions . 5  Anomalous diffusion is one more dynamic system where fractional-order systems play significant role to describe the anomalous flow in the diffusion process.  Viscoelasticity is the property of material in which the material exhibits its nature between purely elastic and pure fluid. In case of real materials the relation ship between stress and strain given by Hooke's law and Newton's law both have obvious disadvances. So G. W. Scott Blair introduced a new relationship between stress and strain given by        σ   (  t  )    =   E   D  t  α   ε   (  t  )     ,   0  <  α  <  1.      formulae-sequence      σ  t     E   superscript   subscript  D  t   α   ε  t        0  α       1.      \sigma(t)=E{D_{t}^{\alpha}}\varepsilon(t),\quad 0<\alpha<1.     Preliminaries  Fractional integration and several forms of fractional derivatives are defined in fractional calculus . Due to involvement of definite integration in definitions of fractional integration and derivatives, these operators are non-local concepts and hence non-local geometrical and physical interpretation for these operators has been established by Igor Podlubny.  Analysis of fractional differential equations  Consider a fractional-order initial value problem :         D  t  α   0  C   x   (  t  )    =   f   (  t  ,   x   (  t  )    )     ,    t  ∈   [  0  ,  T  ]    ,     x   (  0  )    =   x  0    ,   0  <  α  <  1.        formulae-sequence       subscript   superscript   superscript   subscript  D  t   α   C   0   x  t     f   t    x  t       formulae-sequence    t   0  T     formulae-sequence      x  0    subscript  x  0        0  α       1.        {{}_{0}^{C}D_{t}^{\alpha}}x(t)=f(t,x(t)),\quad t\in[0,T],\quad x(0)=x_{0},%
 \quad 0<\alpha<1.     Existence and uniqueness  Here, under the continuity condition on function f, one can convert the above equation into corresponding integral equation.        x   (  t  )    =    x  0   +    D  t   -  α    0  C   f   (  t  ,   x   (  t  )    )     =    x  0   +    1   Γ   (  α  )       ∫  0  t     f   (  s  ,   x   (  s  )    )   d  s     (   t  -  s   )    1  -  α         ,          x  t      subscript  x  0      subscript   superscript   superscript   subscript  D  t     α    C   0   f   t    x  t              subscript  x  0       1    normal-Γ  α      superscript   subscript   0   t       f   s    x  s    d  s    superscript    t  s     1  α           x(t)=x_{0}+{{}_{0}^{C}D_{t}^{-\alpha}}f(t,x(t))=x_{0}+\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}%
 \int_{0}^{t}\frac{f(s,x(s))\,ds}{(t-s)^{1-\alpha}},     One can construct a solution space and define, by that equation, a continuous self-map on the solution space, then apply a fixed-point theorem , to get a fixed-point , which is the solution of above equation.  Numerical simulation  For numerical simulation of solution of the above equations, Kai Diethelm has suggested fractional Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method .  Chaos  In chaos theory , it has been observed that chaos occurs in dynamical systems of order 3 or more. With the introduction of fractional-order systems, some researchers study chaos in the system of total order less than 3. 6  See also   Fractional calculus  Fractional dynamics  Fractional order control  Fractional order integrator   References        An Introduction to the Fractional Calculus and Fractional Differential Equations , by Kenneth S.
