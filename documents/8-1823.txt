Traced monoidal category

In category theory, a traced monoidal category is a category with some extra structure which gives a reasonable notion of feedback.
A traced symmetric monoidal category is a symmetric monoidal category C together with a family of functions


 
  called a trace, satisfying the following conditions (where we sometimes denote an identity morphism by the corresponding object, e.g., using U to denote 
 
 
 
 ):

naturality in X: for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ,

Properties

Every compact closed category admits a trace.


Given a traced monoidal category C, the Int construction generates the free (in some bicategorical sense) compact closure Int(C) of C.
