Template:A5 honeycombs

This honeycomb is one of 12 unique uniform honeycombs1 constructed by the 
 
 
Coxeter group. The extended symmetry of the hexagonal diagram of the 
 
 
 
  Coxeter group allows for isomorphisms that map diagram nodes (mirrors) on to each other. So the various 12 honeycombs represent higher symmetries based on the ring arrangement symmetry in the diagrams:
