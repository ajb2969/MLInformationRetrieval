   Gauge group (mathematics)      Gauge group (mathematics)   A gauge group is a group of gauge symmetries of the Yang – Mills gauge theory of principal connections on a principal bundle . Given a principal bundle    P  →  X     normal-→  P  X    P\to X   with a structure Lie group   G   G   G   , a gauge group is defined to be a group of its vertical automorphisms. This group is isomorphic to the group    G   (  X  )       G  X    G(X)   of global sections of the associated group bundle     P  ~   →  X     normal-→   normal-~  P   X    \widetilde{P}\to X   whose typical fiber is a group   G   G   G   which acts on itself by the adjoint representation . The unit element of    G   (  X  )       G  X    G(X)   is a constant unit-valued section     g   (  x  )    =  1        g  x   1    g(x)=1   of     P  ~   →  X     normal-→   normal-~  P   X    \widetilde{P}\to X   .  At the same time, gauge gravitation theory exemplifies field theory on a principal frame bundle whose gauge symmetries are general covariant transformations which are not elements of a gauge group.  It should be emphasized that, in the physical literature on gauge theory , a structure group of a principal bundle often is called the gauge group .  In quantum gauge theory , one considers a normal subgroup     G  0    (  X  )        superscript  G  0   X    G^{0}(X)   of a gauge group    G   (  X  )       G  X    G(X)   which is the stabilizer       G  0    (  X  )   =   {  g   (  x  )   ∈  G   (  X  )   :  g   (   x  0   )   =  1  ∈    P  ~    x  0    }      fragments   superscript  G  0    fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     fragments  normal-{  g   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    G   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)    normal-:   g   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  0   normal-)    1    subscript   normal-~  P    subscript  x  0    normal-}     G^{0}(X)=\{g(x)\in G(X)\quad:\quad g(x_{0})=1\in\widetilde{P}_{x_{0}}\}     of some point    1  ∈    P  ~    x  0        1   subscript   normal-~  P    subscript  x  0      1\in\widetilde{P}_{x_{0}}   of a group bundle     P  ~   →  X     normal-→   normal-~  P   X    \widetilde{P}\to X   . It is called the pointed gauge group . This group acts freely on a space of principal connections. Obviously,       G   (  X  )    /   G  0     (  X  )    =  G            G  X    superscript  G  0    X   G    G(X)/G^{0}(X)=G   . One also introduces the effective gauge group       G  ¯    (  X  )    =    G   (  X  )    /  Z          normal-¯  G   X       G  X   Z     \overline{G}(X)=G(X)/Z   where   Z   Z   Z   is the center of a gauge group    G   (  X  )       G  X    G(X)   . This group     G  ¯    (  X  )        normal-¯  G   X    \overline{G}(X)   acts freely on a space of irreducible principal connections.  If a structure group   G   G   G   is a complex semisimple matrix group , the Sobolev completion       G  ¯   k    (  X  )        subscript   normal-¯  G   k   X    \overline{G}_{k}(X)   of a gauge group    G   (  X  )       G  X    G(X)   can be introduced. It is a Lie group. A key point is that the action of      G  ¯   k    (  X  )        subscript   normal-¯  G   k   X    \overline{G}_{k}(X)   on a Sobolev completion    A  k     subscript  A  k    A_{k}   of a space of principal connections is smooth, and that an orbit space      A  k   /    G  ¯   k     (  X  )          subscript  A  k    subscript   normal-¯  G   k    X    A_{k}/\overline{G}_{k}(X)   is a Hilbert space . It is a configuration space of quantum gauge theory.  References   Mitter, P., Viallet, C., On the bundle of connections and the gauge orbit manifold in Yang – Mills theory, Commun. Math.
