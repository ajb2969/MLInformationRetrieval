   Atom-transfer radical-polymerization      Atom-transfer radical-polymerization   Atom transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP ) is an example of a reversible-deactivation radical polymerization . Like its counterpart, ATRA or atom transfer radical addition , it is a means of forming a carbon-carbon bond through a transition metal  catalyst . As the name implies, the atom transfer step is the key step in the reaction responsible for uniform polymer chain growth. ATRP (or transition metal-mediated living radical polymerization) was independently discovered by Mitsuo Sawamoto  1 and by Dr. Jin-Shan Wang in 1995. 2    The following scheme presents a typical ATRP reaction:       Overview of ATRP  ATRP usually employs a transition metal complex as the catalyst with an alkyl halide as the initiator (R-X). Various transition metal complexes, namely those of Cu, Fe, Ru, Ni, Os, etc., have been employed as catalysts for ATRP. In an ATRP process, the dormant species is activated by the transition metal complex to generate radicals via one electron transfer process. Simultaneously the transition metal is oxidized to higher oxidation state. This reversible process rapidly establishes an equilibrium that is predominately shifted to the side with very low radical concentrations. The number of polymer chains is determined by the number of initiators. Each growing chain has the same probability to propagate with monomers to form living/dormant polymer chains (R-P n -X). As a result, polymers with similar molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distribution can be prepared.  ATRP reactions are very robust in that they are tolerant of many functional groups like allyl, amino, epoxy, hydroxy and vinyl groups present in either the monomer or the initiator. 3 ATRP methods are also advantageous due to the ease of preparation, commercially available and inexpensive catalysts (copper complexes), pyridine based ligands and initiators (alkyl halides). 4  (Figure)  The ATRP with styrene. If all the styrene is reacted (the conversion is 100%) the polymer will have 100 units of styrene built into it. PMDETA stands for N,N,N',N,N pentamethyldiethylenetriamine.   Components of Normal ATRP  There are four important variable components of Atom Transfer Radical Polymerizations. They are the monomer, initiator, catalyst and solvent. The following section breaks down the contributions of each component to the overall polymerization.  Monomer  Monomers that are typically used in ATRP are molecules with substituents that can stabilize the propagating radicals; for example, styrenes, (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylamides, and acrylonitrile. 5 ATRP are successful at leading to polymers of high number average molecular weight and a narrow polydispersity index when the concentration of the propagating radical balances the rate of radical termination. Yet, the propagating rate is unique to each individual monomer. Therefore, it is important that the other components of the polymerization (initiator, catalysts, ligands and solvents) are optimized in order for the concentration of the dormant species to be greater than the concentration of the propagating radical and yet not too great to slow down or halt the reaction. 6 7  Initiator  The number of growing polymer chains is determined by the initiator. Fast initiation insures consistency of the number of propagating chains leading and to narrow molecular weight distributions. 8 Organic halides that are similar in the organic framework as the propagating radical are often chosen as initiators. 9 Most initiators for ATRP are alkyl halides. 10 Alkyl halides such as alkyl bromides are more reactive than alkyl chlorides and both have good molecular weight control. 11 12 The shape or structure of your initiator can determine the architecture of your polymer. For example, initiators with multiple alkyl halide groups on a single core can lead to a star-like polymer shape. 13  .  Catalyst  The catalyst is the most important component of ATRP because it determines the equilibrium constant between the active and dormant species. This equilibrium determines the polymerization rate and an equilibrium constant too small may inhibit or slow the polymerization while an equilibrium constant too large leads to a high distribution of chain lengths. 14  There are several requirements for the metal catalyst:   there needs to be two accessible oxidation states that are separated by one electron  the metal center needs to have a reasonable affinity for halogens  the coordination sphere of the metal needs to be expandable when it is oxidized so to be able to accommodate the halogen  the transition metal catalyst should not lead to significant side reactions, such as irreversible coupling with the propagating radicals and catalytic radical termination, etc.   The most studied catalysts are those that include copper, which has shown the most versatility, with successful polymerizations for a wide selection of monomers.  Solvents  Toluene,1,4-dioxane, xylene, anisole, DMF, DMSO, water, methanol, acetonitrile, and other solvents are used.  Kinetics of Normal ATRP  (Figure)  Reactions in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization   ATRP Equilibrium Constant  The radical concentration in normal ATRP can be calculated via the following equation:       [   R-P  n  ∙   ]   =    K  ATRP   ⋅   [    R-P  n   -X   ]   ⋅    [     Cu  I   X   /  L   ]    [     Cu  II    X  2    /  L   ]          delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  R-P  n   normal-∙     normal-⋅   subscript  K  ATRP    delimited-[]     subscript  R-P  n   -X       delimited-[]       superscript  Cu  I   X   L     delimited-[]       superscript  Cu  II    subscript  X  2    L        [\text{R-P}_{\text{n}}^{\bullet}]=K_{\text{ATRP}}\cdot[\text{R-P}_{\text{n}}%
 \text{-X}]\cdot\frac{[\text{Cu}^{\text{I}}\text{X}/\text{L}]}{[\text{Cu}^{%
 \text{II}}\text{X}_{2}/\text{L}]}     It is important to know the K ATRP value to adjust the radical concentration. The K ATRP value depends on the homo-cleavage energy of the alkyl halide and the redox potential of the Cu catalyst with different ligands. Given two alkyl halides (R 1 -X and R 2 -X) and two ligands (L 1 and L 2 ), there will be four combinations between different alkyl halides and ligands. Let K ij ATRP refer to the K ATRP value for R i -X and L j . If we know three of these four combinations, the fourth one can be calculated as K 22 ATRP = K 12 ATRP × K 21 ATRP / K 11 ATRP . The K ATRP values for different alkyl halides and different Cu catalysts can be found in literature. 15  Solvents have significant effects on the K ATRP values. The K ATRP value increases dramatically with the polarity of the solvent for the same alkyl halide and the same Cu catalyst. 16 The polymerization must take place in solvent/monomer mixture, which changes to solvent/monomer/polymer mixture gradually. The K ATRP values could change 10000 times by switching the reaction medium from pure methyl acrylate to pure dimethyl sulfoxide. 17  Activation and Deactivation Rate Coefficients  Deactivation rate coefficient, k d , values must be sufficiently large to obtain low M w / M n value. The direct measurement of k d value is difficult though not impossible. In most cases the k d values were calculated from known K ATRP and k a . 18 19 20 Cu complexes giving very low k d values are not recommended to be used in ATRP reactions.  Retention of Chain End Functionality  (Figure)  Halogen Conservation in Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization   High level retention of chain end functionality is desired. However, the determination of the loss of chain end functionality based on 1 H NMR and MS methods cannot provide precise values. As a result, it is difficult to identify the contributions of different chain breaking reactions in ATRP. There is a simple rule in ATRP which is the principle of halogen conservation. 21 Halogen conservation means the total amount of halogen in the reaction systems must remain as a constant. Based on the simple rule, the level of retention of chain end functionality can be precisely determined in many cases. The precise determination of the loss of chain end functionality enabled further investigation of the chain breaking reactions in ATRP. 22  Different ATRP Methods  Activator Regeneration ATRP Methods  In a normal ATRP, the concentration of radicals is determined by the K ATRP value, concentration of dormant species and [Cu I ]/[Cu II ] ratio. In principle, the total amount of Cu catalyst should not influence the polymerization kinetics. However, the loss of chain end functionality slowly but irreversibly converts [Cu I ] to [Cu II ]. Thus the initial [Cu I ] is typically 0.1~1 equiv to the initiator. When very low concentrations of catalysts are used, usually at tens of ppm level, activator regeneration processes are generally required to compensate the loss of CEF and regenerate a sufficient amount of [Cu I ] to continue the polymerization. Several activator regeneration ATRP methods were developed, namely ICAR ATRP, ARGET ATRP, SARA ATRP, e ATRP and Photoinduced ATRP. The activator regeneration process is introduced to compensate the loss of chain end functionality, thus the cumulative amount of activator regeneration should roughly equal the total amount of the loss of chain end functionality.  ICAR ATRP  Initiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) is a technique that uses conventional radical initiators to continuously regenerate the activator, lowering its required concentration from thousands of ppm to I. A good reducing agent (e.g. hydrazine, phenoles, sugars, ascorbic acid, etc...) should only react with Cu II and not with radicals or other reagents in the reaction mixture.  SARA ATRP  A typical SARA ATRP employs Cu 0 as both supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA). Cu 0 can active alkyl halide directly but slowly. Cu 0 can also reduce Cu II to Cu I . Both processes help to regenerate Cu I activator. Other zero valent metals, such as Mg, Zn and Fe, have also been employed for Cu-based SARA ATRP.  e ATRP  In e ATRP the activator Cu I is regenerated via electrochemical process. The development of e ATRP enables precise control of the reduction process and external regulation of the polymerization. In an e ATRP process, the redox reaction involves two electrodes. The Cu II species is reduced to Cu I at the cathode; while halide anions migrate to the anode where the oxidation reaction takes place.  Photoinduced ATRP  The direct photo reduction of transition metal catalysts in ATRP and/or photo assistant activation of alkyl halide is particularly interesting because such a procedure will allow performing of ATRP with ppm level of catalysts without any other additives.  Other ATRP Methods  Reverse ATRP  In reverse ATRP, the catalyst is added in its higher oxidation state. Chains are activated by conventional radical initiators (e.g. AIBN) and deactivated by the transition metal. The source of transferrable halogen is the copper salt, so this must be present in concentrations comparable to the transition metal.  SR&NI; ATRP  A mixture of radical initiator and active (lower oxidation state) catalyst allows for the creation of block copolymers (contaminated with homopolymer) which is impossible using standard reverse ATRP. This is called SR&NI; (simultaneous reverse and normal initiation ATRP).  AGET ATRP  Activators generated by electron transfer uses a reducing agent unable to initiate new chains (instead of organic radicals) as regenerator for the low-valent metal. Examples are metallic Cu, tin(II), ascorbic acid , or triethylamine . It allows for lower concentrations of transition metals, and may also be possible in aqueous or dispersed media.  Hybrid and bimetallic systems  This technique uses a variety of different metals/oxidation states, possibly on solid supports, to act as activators/deactivators, possibly with reduced toxicity or sensitivity. 23 24 Iron salts can, for example, efficiently activate alkyl halides but requires an efficient Cu(II) deactivator which can be present in much lower concentrations (3–5 mol%)  Metal-free ATRP  Trace metal catalyst remaining in the final product has limited the application of ATRP in biomedical and electronic fields. In 2014, Craig Hawker and coworkers developed a new catalysis system involving photoredox reaction of 10-phenothiazine. The metal-free ATRP has been demonstrated to be capable of controlled polymerization of methacrylates. 25 This technique was later expanded to polymerization of acrylonitrile by Krzysztof Matyjaszewski et al. 26  Polymers Made by ATRP   Polystyrene  Poly (methyl methacrylate)  Polyacrylamide   See also   Heteropolymer  Radical (chemistry)  Reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization  Nitroxide mediated radical polymerization   External Links   About ATRP - Matyjaszewski Polymer Group   References  "  Category:Polymers  Category:Polymer chemistry  Category:Polymerization reactions     ↩  ↩  Cowie, J.
