   Shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase      Shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-coumaroyl-CoA + shikimate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 4-coumaroylshikimate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-coumaroyl-CoA and shikimate , whereas its two products are CoA and 4-coumaroylshikimate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-coumaroyl-CoA:shikimate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase . This enzyme is also called shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Hydroxycinnamic acids metabolism
