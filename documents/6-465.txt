Special right triangles

 A special right triangle is a right triangle with some regular feature that makes calculations on the triangle easier, or for which simple formulas exist. For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45–45–90. This is called an "angle-based" right triangle. A "side-based" right triangle is one in which the lengths of the sides form ratios of whole numbers, such as 3 : 4 : 5, or of other special numbers such as the golden ratio. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these special right triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without resorting to more advanced methods.

(Figure)
Special angle-based triangles inscribed in a unit circle are handy for visualizing and remembering trigonometric functions of multiples of 30 and 45 degrees.

"Angle-based" special right triangles are specified by the relationships of the angles of which the triangle is composed. The angles of these triangles are such that the larger (right) angle, which is 90 degrees or π/2 radians, is equal to the sum of the other two angles.
The side lengths are generally deduced from the basis of the unit circle or other geometric methods. This approach may be used to rapidly reproduce the values of trigonometric functions for the angles 30°, 45°, and 60°.
Special triangles are used to aid in calculating common trigonometric functions, as below:

The 45–45–90 triangle, the 30–60–90 triangle, and the equilateral/equiangular (60–60–60) triangle are the three Möbius triangles in the plane, meaning that they tessellate the plane via reflections in their sides; see Triangle group.

In plane geometry, constructing the diagonal of a square results in a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 1 : 2, adding up to 180° or π radians. Hence, the angles respectively measure 45° (π/4), 45° (π/4), and 90° (π/2). The sides in this triangle are in the ratio 1 : 1 : √2, which follows immediately from the Pythagorean theorem.
Of all right triangles, the 45-45-90 degree triangle has the smallest ratio of the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely

Of all right triangles, the 45-45-90 degree triangle has the greatest ratio of the altitude from the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely

Triangles with these angles are the only possible right triangles that are also isosceles triangles in Euclidean geometry. However, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, there are infinitely many different shapes of right isosceles triangles.

The side lengths of a 30–60–90 triangle

This is a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 and respectively measure 30°, 60°, and 90°. The sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2.
The proof of this fact is clear using trigonometry. The geometric proof is:

Draw an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 2 and with point D as the midpoint of segment BC. Draw an altitude line from A to D. Then ABD is a 30–60–90 triangle with hypotenuse of length 2, and base BD of length 1.
 


The fact that the remaining leg AD has length √3 follows immediately from the Pythagorean theorem.
 

The 30-60-90 triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. The proof of this fact is simple and follows on from the fact that if α, α+δ, α+2δ are the angles in the progression then the sum of the angles 3α+3δ = 180°. After dividing by 3, the angle α+δ must be 60°. The right angle is 90°, leaving the remaining angle to be 30°.
Side-based
Right triangles whose sides are of integer lengths, Pythagorean triples, possess angles that cannot all be rational numbers of degrees.3 They are most useful in that they may be easily remembered and any multiple of the sides produces the same relationship. Using Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples, the sides must be in the ratio



where m and n are any positive integers such that m>n.

The 3 : 4 : 5 triangles are the only right triangles with edges in arithmetic progression. Triangles based on Pythagorean triples are Heronian, meaning they have integer area as well as integer sides.

Almost-isosceles Pythagorean triples
Isosceles right-angled triangles cannot have sides with integer values. However, infinitely many almost-isosceles right triangles do exist. These are right-angled triangles with integral sides for which the lengths of the non-hypotenuse edges differ by one.45 Such almost-isosceles right-angled triangles can be obtained recursively,

a0 = 1, b0 = 2
 
an = 2bn–1 + an–1''
 
bn = 2an + bn–1''
 

an is length of hypotenuse, n = 1, 2, 3, .... Equivalently,



where {x, y} are the solutions to the Pell equation

 
 , with the hypotenuse y being the odd terms of the Pell numbers 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378... .. The smallest Pythagorean triples resulting are:6

Alternatively, the same triangles can be derived from the square triangular numbers.7
Right triangle whose sides are in a geometric progression
(Figure)
A Kepler triangle is a right triangle formed by three squares with areas in geometric progression according to the golden ratio.

The Kepler triangle is a right triangle whose sides are in a geometric progression. If the sides are formed from the geometric progression a, ar, ar2 then its common ratio r is given by r = √φ where φ is the golden ratio. Its sides are therefore in the ratio 
 
 

Sides of regular polygons
 Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the side length of a regular decagon inscribed in a unit circle, where 
 
 
 
  is the golden ratio. Let 
 
 
 
  be the side length of a regular hexagon, and let 
 
 
 
  be the side length of a regular pentagon. Then 
 
 
 
 , so these three lengths form the sides of a right triangle.8 The same triangle forms half of a golden rectangle. It may also be found within a regular icosahedron of side length c: the shortest line segment from any vertex v to the plane of its five neighbors has length a, and the endpoints of this line segment together with any of the neighbors of v form the vertices of a right triangle with sides a, b, and c.9
