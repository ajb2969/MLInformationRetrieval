Galactonate dehydratase

In enzymology, a galactonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-galactonate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-galactonate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-galactonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate-forming). Other names in common use include D-galactonate dehydrase, D-galactonate dehydratase, and D-galactonate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism.
