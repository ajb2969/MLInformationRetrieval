   Multiplier-accelerator model      Multiplier-accelerator model   The Multiplier–accelerator model is a macroeconomic model which analyzes the business cycle . 1 This model was developed by Paul Samuelson in . 2 3 This model is based on the Keynesian multiplier and the accelerator theory of investment .  Model  The multiplier–accelerator model can be stated as follows: 4       Y  t   =    g  t   +   C  t   +   I  t         subscript  Y  t      subscript  g  t    subscript  C  t    subscript  I  t      Y_{t}=g_{t}+C_{t}+I_{t}          C  t   =   α   Y   t  -  1          subscript  C  t     α   subscript  Y    t  1       C_{t}=\alpha Y_{t-1}          I  t   =   β   ∣    C  t   -   C   t  -  1     ∣         subscript  I  t     β   delimited-∣∣     subscript  C  t    subscript  C    t  1         I_{t}=\beta\mid C_{t}-C_{t-1}\mid          g  t   =  1       subscript  g  t   1    g_{t}=1   where    Y  t     subscript  Y  t    Y_{t}   is national income,    g  t     subscript  g  t    g_{t}   is government expenditure,    C  t     subscript  C  t    C_{t}   is consumption expenditure,    I  t     subscript  I  t    I_{t}   is induced private investment, and the subscript   t   t   t   is time. Here we can rearrange these equations and rewrite them as a second order linear difference equation: 5       Y  t   =    1  +   α   (   1  +  β   )    Y   t  -  1      -   α  β   Y   t  -  2           subscript  Y  t       1    α    1  β    subscript  Y    t  1        α  β   subscript  Y    t  2        Y_{t}=1+\alpha(1+\beta)Y_{t-1}-\alpha\beta Y_{t-2}   Samuelson demonstrated that there are several kinds of solution path for national income to be derived from this second order linear difference equation. 6 This solution path changes its form, depending on the values of the roots of the equation or the relationships between the parameter   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   . 7  References     "  Category:Macroeconomics     ↩    ↩
