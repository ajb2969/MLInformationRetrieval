Multiplier-accelerator model

The Multiplier–accelerator model is a macroeconomic model which analyzes the business cycle.1 This model was developed by Paul Samuelson in .23 This model is based on the Keynesian multiplier and the accelerator theory of investment.
Model
The multiplier–accelerator model can be stated as follows:4











 
  where 
 
 
 
  is national income, 
 
 
 
  is government expenditure, 
 
 
 
  is consumption expenditure, 
 
 
 
  is induced private investment, and the subscript 
 
 
 
  is time. Here we can rearrange these equations and rewrite them as a second order linear difference equation:5


 
  Samuelson demonstrated that there are several kinds of solution path for national income to be derived from this second order linear difference equation.6 This solution path changes its form, depending on the values of the roots of the equation or the relationships between the parameter 
 
 
 
  and
