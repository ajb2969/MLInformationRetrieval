   Ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene synthase      Ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene synthase   Ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene synthase (, PMD synthase ) is an enzyme with system name ent-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ent-copalyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene + diphosphate    This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the diterpenoid viguiepinol and requires Mg 2+ , Co 2+ , Zn 2+ or Ni 2+ for activity.
