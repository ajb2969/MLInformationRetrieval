Ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene synthase




Ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene synthase

Ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene synthase (, PMD synthase) is an enzyme with system name ent-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ent-copalyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  ent-pimara-9(11),15-diene + diphosphate


This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the diterpenoid viguiepinol and requires Mg2+, Co2+, Zn2+ or Ni2+ for activity.
