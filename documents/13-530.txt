Summary
The animated gif demonstrates chaotic behavior in an uncoupled 2 dimensional lattice. Each site is updated by the logistic map 
 
 
 
 . The range of the logistic map (randomly seeded between 0.1 and 0.5) is bounded from 0 to 1. The resulting animated contour map smooths the distinction between the sites with respect to the value they hold.
Each frame is taken at an iterative time step where the parameter r is increased 
 
 
 
 . Notably not until 
 
 
 
  does the map truly demonstrate chaotic behavior.
