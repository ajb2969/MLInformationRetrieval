Each site is updated by the logistic map     x   n  +  1    =   r   x  n    (   1  -   x  n    )         subscript  x    n  1      r   subscript  x  n     1   subscript  x  n       x_{n+1}=rx_{n}(1-x_{n})   . The range of the logistic map (randomly seeded between 0.1 and 0.5) is bounded from 0 to 1. The resulting animated contour map smooths the distinction between the sites with respect to the value they hold.  Each frame is taken at an iterative time step where the parameter r is increased    r  =   3.5  ,  3.51  ,  …  ,  3.9       r   3.5  3.51  normal-…  3.9     r=3.5,3.51,...,3.9   . Notably not until   3.58   3.58   3.58   does the map truly demonstrate chaotic behavior.  Licensing:  "
