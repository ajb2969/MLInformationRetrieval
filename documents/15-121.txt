   Ambit field      Ambit field   In mathematics , an ambit field is a d -dimensional random field describing the stochastic properties of a given system. The input is in general a d -dimensional vector (e.g. d-dimensional space or (1-dimensional) time and ( d ‚àí¬†1)-dimensional space) assigning a real value to each of the points in the field. In its most general form, the ambit field,   Y   Y   Y   , is defined by a constant plus a stochastic integral , where the integration is done with respect to a L√©vy basis , plus a smooth term given by an ordinary Lebesgue integral . The integrations are done over so-called ambit sets , which is used to model the sphere of influence (hence the name, ambit, latin for "sphere of influence" or "boundary") which affect a given point.  The use and development of ambit fields is motivated by the need of flexible stochastic models to describe turbulence 1 and the evolution of electricity prices 2 for use in e.g. risk management and derivative pricing . It was pioneered by Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen and J√ºrgen Schmiegel to model turbulence and tumour growth. 3  Note, that this article will use notation that includes time as a dimension, i.e. we consider ( d ‚àí¬†1)-dimensional space together with 1-dimensional time. The theory and notation easily carries over to d -dimensional space (either including time herin or in a setting involving no time at all).  Intuition and motivation  In stochastic analysis, the usual way to model a random process, or field, is done by specifying the dynamics of the process through a stochastic (partial) differential equation (SPDE). It is known, that solutions of (partial) differential equations can in some cases be given as an integral of a Green's function  convolved with another function ‚Äì if the differential equation is stochastic, i.e. contaminated by random noise (e.g. white noise ) the corresponding solution would be a stochastic integral of the Green's function. This fact motivates the reason for modelling the field of interest directly through a stochastic integral, taking a similar form as a solution through a Green's Function, instead of first specifying a SPDE and then trying to find a solution to this. This provides a very flexible and general framework for modelling a variety of phenomena. 4  Definition  A tempo-spatial ambit field,   Y   Y   Y   , is a random field in space-time     œá  √ó  ‚Ñù      œá  ‚Ñù    \chi\times\mathbb{R}   taking values in   ‚Ñù   ‚Ñù   \mathbb{R}   . Let    Œº  ‚àà   ‚Ñù  ,    A  t    (  x  )    ,    B  t    (  x  )         Œº   ‚Ñù     subscript  A  t   x      subscript  B  t   x      \mu\in\mathbb{R},A_{t}(x),B_{t}(x)   be ambit sets in     œá  √ó   ‚Ñù  +    ,  g  ,  q       œá   subscript  ‚Ñù     g  q    \chi\times\mathbb{R}_{+},g,q    deterministic  kernel functions,   a   a   a   a stochastic  function ,    œÉ  ‚â•  0      œÉ  0    \sigma\geq 0   a stochastic field (called the energy dissipation field in turbulence and volatility in finance ) and   L   L   L   a L√©vy basis. Now, the ambit field   Y   Y   Y   is       Y  t   =   Œº  +    ‚à´    A  t    (  x  )      g   (  Œ∑  ,  s  ,  x  ,  t  )    œÉ  s    (  Œ∑  )   L   (   d  Œ∑   ,   d  s   )     +    ‚à´    B  t    (  x  )      q   (  Œ∑  ,  s  ,  x  ,  t  )    a  s    (  Œ∑  )   d   Œ∑   d  s          subscript  Y  t     Œº    subscript      subscript  A  t   x      g   Œ∑  s  x  t    subscript  œÉ  s   Œ∑  L     d  Œ∑     d  s        subscript      subscript  B  t   x      q   Œ∑  s  x  t    subscript  a  s   Œ∑  d  Œ∑  d  s       Y_{t}=\mu+\int_{A_{t}(x)}g(\eta,s,x,t)\sigma_{s}(\eta)L(d\eta,ds)+\int_{B_{t}(%
 x)}q(\eta,s,x,t)a_{s}(\eta)\,d\eta\,ds     Ambit sets  In the above, the ambit sets      A  t    (  x  )        subscript  A  t   x    A_{t}(x)   and     B  t    (  x  )        subscript  B  t   x    B_{t}(x)   describe the sphere of influence for a given point in space-time. I.e. at a given point,     (  t  ,  x  )   ‚àà   œá  √ó  ‚Ñù        t  x     œá  ‚Ñù     (t,x)\in\chi\times\mathbb{R}   the sets     A  t    (  x  )        subscript  A  t   x    A_{t}(x)   and     B  t    (  x  )        subscript  B  t   x    B_{t}(x)   are the points in space-time which affect the value of the ambit field at     (  t  ,  x  )   ,    Y  t    (  x  )        t  x      subscript  Y  t   x     (t,x),Y_{t}(x)   . When time is considered as one of the dimensions, the sets are often taken to only include time-coordinates which are at or prior to the current time, t, so as to preserve causality of the field (i.e. a given point in space-time can only be affected by events that happened prior to time   t   t   t   and can thus not be affected by the future).  The ambit sets can be of a variety of forms and when using ambit fields for modelling purposes, the choice of ambit sets should be made in a way that captures the desired properties (e.g. stylized facts ) of the system considered in the best possible way. In this sense, the sets can be used to make a particular model fit the data as closely as possible and thus provides a very flexible ‚Äì yet general ‚Äì way of specifying the model.  Ambit process  Often, the object of interest is not the ambit field itself, but instead a process taking a particular path through the field. Such a process is called an ambit process . As an example such a process can represent the price of a particular financial object ‚Äì e.g. the price of a forward contract for a certain time and point in space, space representing things such as time to delivery, spot price , period of delivery etc. 5 This motivates the following definition:  Let the ambit field, Y , be given as above and consider a curve in space-time     œÑ   (  Œ∏  )    =   (   x   (  Œ∏  )    ,   t   (  Œ∏  )    )   ‚àà   œá  √ó  ‚Ñù           œÑ  Œ∏      x  Œ∏     t  Œ∏           œá  ‚Ñù      \tau(\theta)=(x(\theta),t(\theta))\in\chi\times\mathbb{R}   . An ambit process is defined as the value of the field along the curve, i.e.       X  Œ∏   =    Y   t   (  Œ∏  )      (   x   (  Œ∏  )    )         subscript  X  Œ∏      subscript  Y    t  Œ∏      x  Œ∏      X_{\theta}=Y_{t(\theta)}(x(\theta))     Stochastic intermittency/volatility  The energy dissipation field/volatility,   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   , is, in general, stochastic (called intermittency in the context of turbulence ), and can be modelled as a stochastic variable or field. Particularly, it may itself be modelled by another ambit field, i.e.        œÉ  t  2    (  x  )    =    ‚à´    C  t    (  x  )      h   (  Œ∑  ,  s  ,  x  ,  t  )    L  ~    (   d  Œ∑   ,   d  s   )            subscript   superscript  œÉ  2   t   x     subscript      subscript  C  t   x      h   Œ∑  s  x  t    normal-~  L      d  Œ∑     d  s        \sigma^{2}_{t}(x)=\int_{C_{t}(x)}h(\eta,s,x,t)\tilde{L}(d\eta,ds)     where    L  ~     normal-~  L    \tilde{L}   is a non-negative L√©vy basis.  Integration with respect to a L√©vy basis  The stochastic integral,     ‚à´    A  t    (  x  )      g   (  Œ∑  ,  s  ,  x  ,  t  )    œÉ  s    (  Œ∑  )   L   (   d  Œ∑   ,   d  s   )        subscript      subscript  A  t   x      g   Œ∑  s  x  t    subscript  œÉ  s   Œ∑  L     d  Œ∑     d  s       \int_{A_{t}(x)}g(\eta,s,x,t)\sigma_{s}(\eta)L(d\eta,ds)   , in the definition of the ambit process is an integral of a stochastic field (the integrand ) over L√©vy basis (the integrator ), and is thus more complicated than the usual stochastic It√¥-integral . A new theory of integration was provided by Walsh (1987) 6 where integration is done with respect to random fields and this theory can be extended to integration with respect to so-called L√©vy bases, 7 which is the main building block of the ambit field.  Definition of L√©vy basis  A family    (    Œõ   (  A  )    :   A  ‚àà    ùîπ  b    (  S  )      )     normal-:    normal-Œõ  A     A     subscript  ùîπ  b   S      (\Lambda(A):A\in\mathbb{B}_{b}(S))   of random vectors in    ‚Ñù  d     superscript  ‚Ñù  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   is called a L√©vy basis on   S   S   S   if:   1. The law of    Œõ   (  A  )       normal-Œõ  A    \Lambda(A)   is infinitely divisible for all    A  ‚àà    ùîπ  b    (  S  )        A     subscript  ùîπ  b   S     A\in\mathbb{B}_{b}(S)   .  2. If      A  1   ,   A  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   A  n    ‚àà    ùîπ  b    (  S  )          subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  A  n       subscript  ùîπ  b   S     A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{n}\in\mathbb{B}_{b}(S)   are disjoint, then     Œõ   (   A  1   )    ,   Œõ   (   A  2   )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   Œõ   (   A  n   )         normal-Œõ   subscript  A  1      normal-Œõ   subscript  A  2    normal-‚Ä¶    normal-Œõ   subscript  A  n      \Lambda(A_{1}),\Lambda(A_{2}),\ldots,\Lambda(A_{n})   are independent.  3. If      A  1   ,   A  2   ,  ‚Ä¶   ‚àà    ùîπ  b    (  S  )          subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-‚Ä¶      subscript  ùîπ  b   S     A_{1},A_{2},\ldots\in\mathbb{B}_{b}(S)   are disjoint with      ‚ãÉ   i  =  1   ‚àû    A  i    ‚àà    ùîπ  b    (  S  )          superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  A  i       subscript  ùîπ  b   S     \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}\in\mathbb{B}_{b}(S)   , then        Œõ   (    ‚ãÉ   i  =  1   ‚àû    A  i    )    =    ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    Œõ   (   A  i   )           normal-Œõ    superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  A  i       superscript   subscript     i  1        normal-Œõ   subscript  A  i       \Lambda(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i})=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\Lambda(A_{i})   , a.s.       where the convergence on the right hand side of 3. is a.s.  Note that proporties 2. and 3. define an independently scattered random measure .  A stationary example  In some data (e.g. commodity prices) there is often found a stationary component, which a good model should be able to capture. The ambit field can be made stationary in a straight forward way. Consider the ambit field   Y   Y   Y   , defined as       Y  t   =   Œº  +    ‚à´    A  t    (  x  )      g   (  Œ∑  ,   t  -  s   ,  x  )    œÉ  s    (  Œ∑  )   L   (   d  Œ∑   ,   d  s   )     +    ‚à´    B  t    (  x  )      q   (  Œ∑  ,   t  -  s   ,  x  )    a  s    (  Œ∑  )   d   Œ∑   d  s          subscript  Y  t     Œº    subscript      subscript  A  t   x      g   Œ∑    t  s   x    subscript  œÉ  s   Œ∑  L     d  Œ∑     d  s        subscript      subscript  B  t   x      q   Œ∑    t  s   x    subscript  a  s   Œ∑  d  Œ∑  d  s       Y_{t}=\mu+\int_{A_{t}(x)}g(\eta,t-s,x)\sigma_{s}(\eta)L(d\eta,ds)+\int_{B_{t}(%
 x)}q(\eta,t-s,x)a_{s}(\eta)\,d\eta\,ds     where the ambit sets,      A  t    (  x  )    ,    B  t    (  x  )          subscript  A  t   x      subscript  B  t   x     A_{t}(x),B_{t}(x)   are of the form      A  t    (  x  )    =   A  +   (  x  ,  t  )           subscript  A  t   x     A   x  t      A_{t}(x)=A+(x,t)   where the time-coordinates of   A   A   A   are negative (same for   B   B   B   ). Furthermore, we take     g   (  Œ∑  ,  t  ,  x  )    =   q   (  Œ∑  ,  t  ,  x  )    =  0          g   Œ∑  t  x      q   Œ∑  t  x         0     g(\eta,t,x)=q(\eta,t,x)=0   for    t  ‚â§  0      t  0    t\leq 0   and that   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   and   a   a   a   are also stationary random variables/fields. In particular, we can take   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   to be a stationary ambit field itself:        œÉ  t  2    (  x  )    =    ‚à´    C  t    (  x  )      h   (  Œ∑  ,   t  -  s   ,  x  )    L  ~    (   d  Œ∑   ,   d  s   )            subscript   superscript  œÉ  2   t   x     subscript      subscript  C  t   x      h   Œ∑    t  s   x    normal-~  L      d  Œ∑     d  s        \sigma^{2}_{t}(x)=\int_{C_{t}(x)}h(\eta,t-s,x)\tilde{L}(d\eta,ds)     where    L  ~     normal-~  L    \tilde{L}   is a non-negative L√©vy basis and   h   h   h   is a positive function.
