   Tubular neighborhood      Tubular neighborhood   In mathematics , a tubular neighborhood of a submanifold of a smooth manifold is an open set around it resembling the normal bundle .  The idea behind a tubular neighborhood can be explained in a simple example. Consider a smooth curve in the plane without self-intersections. On each point on the curve draw a line perpendicular to the curve. Unless the curve is straight, these lines will intersect among themselves in a rather complicated fashion. However, if one looks only in a narrow band around the curve, the portions of the lines in that band will not intersect, and will cover the entire band without gaps. This band is a tubular neighborhood.  In general, let S be a submanifold of a manifold  M , and let N be the normal bundle of S in M . Here S plays the role of the curve and M the role of the plane containing the curve. Consider the natural map      i  :    N  0   →  S      normal-:  i   normal-→   subscript  N  0   S     i:N_{0}\rightarrow S   which establishes a bijective correspondence between the zero section  N 0 of N and the submanifold S of M . An extension j of this map to the entire normal bundle N with values in M such that j ( N ) is an open set in M and j is a homeomorphism between N and j ( N ) is called a tubular neighbourhood.  Often one calls the open set T = j ( N ), rather than j itself, a tubular neighbourhood of S , it is assumed implicitly that the homeomorphism j mapping N to T exists.  Normal tube  A normal tube to a smooth  curve is a manifold defined as the union of all discs such that   all the discs have the same fixed radius;  the center of each disc lies on the curve; and  each disc lies in a plane normal to the curve where the curve passes through that disc's center.   Formal definition  Let S ⊂ M be smooth manifolds. A tubular neighborhood of S in M is a vector bundle     π  :   E  →  S      normal-:  π   normal-→  E  S     \pi:E\rightarrow S   together with a smooth map    J  :   E  →  M      normal-:  J   normal-→  E  M     J:E\rightarrow M   such that        J  ∘   0  E    =  i        J   subscript  0  E    i    J\circ 0_{E}=i   where i is the embedding    S  ↪  M     normal-↪  S  M    S\hookrightarrow M   and    0  E     subscript  0  E    0_{E}   the zero section        ∃  U   ⊆  E   ,   V  ⊆  M      formulae-sequence      U   E     V  M     \exists\ U\subseteq E,V\subseteq M   with      0  E    [  S  ]    ⊆  U         subscript  0  E    delimited-[]  S    U    0_{E}[S]\subseteq U   and    S  ⊆  V      S  V    S\subseteq V   such that      J  |   U   :   U  →  V      normal-:   evaluated-at  J  U    normal-→  U  V     J|_{U}:U\rightarrow V   is a diffeomorphism   The normal bundle is a tubular neighborhood and because of the diffeomorphism condition in the second point, all tubular neighborhood have the same dimension, namely (the dimension of the vector bundle considered as a manifold is) that of M .  Generalizations  Generalizations of smooth manifolds yield generalizations of tubular neighborhoods, such as regular neighborhoods , or spherical fibrations for Poincaré spaces .  These generalizations are used to produce analogs to the normal bundle, or rather to the stable normal bundle , which are replacements for the tangent bundle (which does not admit a direct description for these spaces).
