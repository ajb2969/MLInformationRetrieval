   Harish-Chandra's Ξ function      Harish-Chandra's Ξ function   In mathematical  harmonic analysis , Harish-Chandra's Ξ function is a special spherical function on a semisimple Lie group , studied by .  Harish-Chandra used it to define Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space .  gives a detailed description of the properties of Ξ .  Definition        Ξ   (  g  )    =    ∫  K    a    (   k  g   )   ρ   d  k     ,        normal-Ξ  g     subscript   K     a   superscript    k  g   ρ   d  k      \Xi(g)=\int_{K}a(kg)^{\rho}dk,     where   K is a maximal compact subgroup of a semisimple Lie group with Iwasawa decomposition  G = NAK  g is an element of G  ρ is a Weyl vector  a ( g ) is the element a in the Iwasawa decomposition g = nak   References      "  Category:Harmonic analysis  Category:Representation theory  Category:Special functions
