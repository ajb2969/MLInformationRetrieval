Lupan-3beta,20-diol synthase

Lupan-3beta,20-diol synthase (, LUP1 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (3S)-2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydrosqualene hydro-lyase (lupan-3beta,20-diol forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

lupan-3beta,20-diol 
 
 
 
  (3S)-2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydrosqualene + H2O
 

The reaction occurs in the reverse direction.
