   List of finite simple groups      List of finite simple groups   In mathematics , the classification of finite simple groups states that every finite simple group is cyclic , or alternating , or in one of 16 families of groups of Lie type , or one of 26 sporadic groups .  The list below gives all finite simple groups, together with their order , the size of the Schur multiplier , the size of the outer automorphism group , usually some small representations , and lists of all duplicates.  Summary  The following table is a complete list of the 18 families of finite simple groups and the 26 sporadic simple groups, along with their orders. Any non-simple members of each family are listed, as well as any members duplicated within a family or between families. (In removing duplicates it is useful to note that no two finite simple groups have the same order, except that the group A 8 = A 3 (2) and A 2 (4) both have order 20160, and that the group B n ( q ) has the same order as C n ( q ) for q odd, n > 2. The smallest of the latter pairs of groups are B 3 (3) and C 3 (3) which both have order 4585351680.)  There is an unfortunate conflict between the notations for the alternating groups A n and the groups of Lie type A n ( q ). Some authors use various different fonts for A n to distinguish them. In particular, in this article we make the distinction by setting the alternating groups A n in Roman font and the Lie-type groups A n ( q ) in italic.  In what follows, n is a positive integer, and q is a positive power of a prime number p , with the restrictions noted.

The order of the outer automorphism group is written as d · f · g , where d is the order of the group of "diagonal automorphisms", f is the order of the (cyclic) group of "field automorphisms" (generated by a Frobenius automorphism ), and g is the order of the group of "graph automorphisms" (coming from automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram ).

" Hypoabelian group " is an archaic name for this group in characteristic 2.     Isomorphisms:   A 1 (2) is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 3 points of order 6. A 1 (3) is isomorphic to the alternating group A 4 (solvable). A 1 (4) and A 1 (5) are isomorphic, and are both isomorphic to the alternating group A 5 . A 1 (7) and A 2 (2) are isomorphic. A 1 (8) is isomorphic to the derived group 2 G 2 (3)′. A 1 (9) is isomorphic to A 6 and to the derived group B 2 (2)′. A 3 (2) is isomorphic to A 8 .   B n (2 m ) is isomorphic to C n (2 m ). B 2 (2) is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 6 points, and the derived group B 2 (2)′ is isomorphic to A 1 (9) and to A 6 . B 2 (3) is isomorphic to 2 A 3 (2 2 ).   C n (2 m ) is isomorphic to B n (2 m )      Remarks:   These groups are obtained from the general linear groups  GL n +1 ( q ) by taking the elements of determinant 1 (giving the special linear groups  SL n +1 ( q )) and then quotienting out by the center.   This is the group obtained from the orthogonal group in dimension 2 n +1 by taking the kernel of the determinant and spinor norm maps. B 1 ( q ) also exists, but is the same as A 1 ( q ). B 2 ( q ) has a non-trivial graph automorphism when q is a power of 2.   This group is obtained from the symplectic group in 2 n dimensions by quotienting out the center. C 1 ( q ) also exists, but is the same as A 1 ( q ). C 2 ( q ) also exists, but is the same as B 2 ( q ).   This is the group obtained from the split orthogonal group in dimension 2 n by taking the kernel of the determinant (or Dickson invariant in characteristic 2) and spinor norm maps and then killing the center. The groups of type D 4 have an unusually large diagram automorphism group of order 6, containing the triality automorphism. D 2 ( q ) also exists, but is the same as A 1 ( q )× A 1 ( q ). D 3 ( q ) also exists, but is the same as A 3 ( q ).
