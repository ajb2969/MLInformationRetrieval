   Mittag-Leffler distribution      Mittag-Leffler distribution   The Mittag-Leffler distributions are two families of probability distributions on the half-line    [  0  ,  ‚àû  )     0     [0,\infty)   . They are parametrized by a real    Œ±  ‚àà   (  0  ,  1  ]       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in(0,1]   or    Œ±  ‚àà   [  0  ,  1  ]       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in[0,1]   . Both are defined with the Mittag-Leffler function . 1  The Mittag-Leffler function  For any complex   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   whose real part is positive, the series        E  Œ±    (  z  )    :=    ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû     z  n    Œì   (   1  +   Œ±  n    )         assign     subscript  E  Œ±   z     superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  z  n     normal-Œì    1    Œ±  n         E_{\alpha}(z):=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{\Gamma(1+\alpha n)}     defines an entire function. For    Œ±  =  0      Œ±  0    \alpha=0   , the series converges only on a disc of radius one, but it can be analytically extended to    ‚ÑÇ  -   {  1  }       ‚ÑÇ   1     \mathbb{C}-\{1\}   .  First family of Mittag-Leffler distributions  The first family of Mittag-Leffler distributions is defined by a relation between the Mittag-Leffler function and their cumulative distribution functions .  For all    Œ±  ‚àà   (  0  ,  1  ]       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in(0,1]   , the function    E  Œ±     subscript  E  Œ±    E_{\alpha}   is increasing on the real line, converges to   0   0    in    -  ‚àû         -\infty   , and      E  Œ±    (  0  )    =  1         subscript  E  Œ±   0   1    E_{\alpha}(0)=1   . Hence, the function    x  ‚Ü¶   1  -    E  Œ±    (   -   x  Œ±    )        maps-to  x    1     subscript  E  Œ±      superscript  x  Œ±        x\mapsto 1-E_{\alpha}(-x^{\alpha})   is the cumulative distribution function of a probability measure on the non-negative real numbers. The distribution thus defined, and any of its multiples, is called a Mittag-Leffler distribution of order   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   .  All these probability distribution are Absolutely_continuous#Absolute_continuity_of_measures . Since    E  1     subscript  E  1    E_{1}   is the exponential function, the Mittag-Leffler distribution of order   1   1   1   is an exponential distribution . However, for    Œ±  ‚àà   (  0  ,  1  )       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in(0,1)   , the Mittag-Leffler distributions are Heavy-tailed_distribution . Their Laplace transform is given by:        ùîº   (   e   -   Œª   X  Œ±      )    =   1   1  +   Œª  Œ±      ,        ùîº   superscript  e      Œª   subscript  X  Œ±         1    1   superscript  Œª  Œ±       \mathbb{E}(e^{-\lambda X_{\alpha}})=\frac{1}{1+\lambda^{\alpha}},     which implies that, for    Œ±  ‚àà   (  0  ,  1  )       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in(0,1)   , the expectation is infinite. In addition, these distributions are geometric stable distributions .  Second family of Mittag-Leffler distributions  The second family of Mittag-Leffler distributions is defined by a relation between the Mittag-Leffler function and their moment-generating functions .  For all    Œ±  ‚àà   [  0  ,  1  ]       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in[0,1]   , a random variable    X  Œ±     subscript  X  Œ±    X_{\alpha}   is said to follow a Mittag-Leffler distribution of order   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   if, for some constant    C  >  0      C  0    C>0   ,        ùîº   (   e   z   X  Œ±     )    =    E  Œ±    (   C  z   )     ,        ùîº   superscript  e    z   subscript  X  Œ±         subscript  E  Œ±     C  z      \mathbb{E}(e^{zX_{\alpha}})=E_{\alpha}(Cz),     where the convergence stands for all   z   z   z   in the complex plane if    Œ±  ‚àà   (  0  ,  1  ]       Œ±   0  1     \alpha\in(0,1]   , and all   z   z   z   in a disc of radius    1  /  C      1  C    1/C   if    Œ±  =  0      Œ±  0    \alpha=0   .  A Mittag-Leffler distribution of order   0   0    is an exponential distribution. A Mittag-Leffler distribution of order    1  /  2      1  2    1/2   is the distribution of the absolute value of a normal distribution random variable. A Mittag-Leffler distribution of order   1   1   1   is a degenerate distribution . In opposition to the first family of Mittag-Leffler distribution, these distributions are not heavy-tailed.  These distributions are commonly found in relation with the local time of Markov processes.  References  "  Category:Probability distributions  Category:Continuous distributions     ‚Ü©
