   Hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase      Hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase   In enzymology , a hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-3-((R)-3-hydroxybutanoyloxy)butanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-3-((R)-3-hydroxybutanoyloxy)butanoate and H 2 O , whereas its product is (R)-3-hydroxybutanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-3-((R)-3-hydroxybutanoyloxy)butanoate hydroxybutanoylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
