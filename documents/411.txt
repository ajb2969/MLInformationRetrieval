   Affirming a disjunct      Affirming a disjunct   The formal fallacy of affirming a disjunct also known as the fallacy of the alternative disjunct or a false exclusionary disjunct occurs when a deductive argument takes the following logical form :   A or B  A  Therefore, it is not the case that B   Or in logical operators :      p  ∨  q      p  q    p\vee q        p   p   p        ⊢   proves   {}\vdash{}   ¬   q   q   q     Where   ⊢   proves   {}\vdash{}   denotes a logical assertion .  Explanation  The fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact they may both be true because "or" is defined inclusively rather than exclusively. It is a fallacy of equivocation between the operations OR and XOR .  Affirming the disjunct should not be confused with the valid argument known as the disjunctive syllogism .  Example  The following argument indicates the unsoundness of affirming a disjunct:   Max is a cat or Max is a mammal.  Max is a cat.  Therefore, Max is not a mammal.   This inference is unsound. If Max is a cat then Max is also a mammal. (Remember "or" is defined in an inclusive sense not an exclusive sense.)  A second example provides a first proposition that appears realistic and shows how an obviously flawed conclusion still arises under this fallacy.   To be on the cover of Vogue Magazine, one must be a celebrity or very beautiful.  This month's cover was a celebrity.  Therefore, this celebrity is not very beautiful.
