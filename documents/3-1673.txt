   Symbolic method      Symbolic method   In mathematics , the symbolic method in invariant theory is an algorithm developed by , , , and  in the 19th century for computing invariants of algebraic forms . It is based on treating the form as if it were a power of a degree one form, which corresponds to embedding a symmetric power of a vector space into the symmetric elements of a tensor product of copies of it.  Symbolic notation  The symbolic method uses a compact but rather confusing and mysterious notation for invariants, depending on the introduction of new symbols a , b , c , ... (from which the symbolic method gets its name) with apparently contradictory properties.  Example: the discriminant of a binary quadratic form  These symbols can be explained by the following example from . Suppose that       f   (  x  )    =     A  0    x  1  2    +   2   A  1    x  1    x  2    +    A  2    x  2  2           f  x        subscript  A  0    superscript   subscript  x  1   2      2   subscript  A  1    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       subscript  A  2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2       \displaystyle f(x)=A_{0}x_{1}^{2}+2A_{1}x_{1}x_{2}+A_{2}x_{2}^{2}   is a binary quadratic form with an invariant given by the discriminant       Δ  =     A  0    A  2    -   A  1  2     .      normal-Δ       subscript  A  0    subscript  A  2     superscript   subscript  A  1   2      \displaystyle\Delta=A_{0}A_{2}-A_{1}^{2}.   The symbolic representation of the discriminant is       2  Δ   =    (   a  b   )   2         2  normal-Δ    superscript    a  b   2     \displaystyle 2\Delta=(ab)^{2}   where a and b are the symbols. The meaning of the expression ( ab ) 2 is as follows. First of all, ( ab ) is a shorthand form for the determinant of a matrix whose rows are a 1 , a 2 and b 1 , b 2 , so        (   a  b   )   =     a  1    b  2    -    a  2    b  1      .        a  b        subscript  a  1    subscript  b  2       subscript  a  2    subscript  b  1       \displaystyle(ab)=a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1}.   Squaring this we get         (   a  b   )   2   =      a  1  2    b  2  2    -   2   a  1    a  2    b  1    b  2     +    a  2  2    b  1  2      .       superscript    a  b   2          superscript   subscript  a  1   2    superscript   subscript  b  2   2      2   subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  b  1    subscript  b  2        superscript   subscript  a  2   2    superscript   subscript  b  1   2       \displaystyle(ab)^{2}=a_{1}^{2}b_{2}^{2}-2a_{1}a_{2}b_{1}b_{2}+a_{2}^{2}b_{1}^%
 {2}.   Next we pretend that       f   (  x  )    =    (     a  1    x  1    +    a  2    x  2     )   2   =    (     b  1    x  1    +    b  2    x  2     )   2           f  x    superscript       subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2     2         superscript       subscript  b  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  b  2    subscript  x  2     2      \displaystyle f(x)=(a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2})^{2}=(b_{1}x_{1}+b_{2}x_{2})^{2}   so that       A  i   =    a  1   2  -  i     a  2  i    =    b  1   2  -  i     b  2  i           subscript  A  i      superscript   subscript  a  1     2  i     superscript   subscript  a  2   i            superscript   subscript  b  1     2  i     superscript   subscript  b  2   i       \displaystyle A_{i}=a_{1}^{2-i}a_{2}^{i}=b_{1}^{2-i}b_{2}^{i}   and we ignore the fact that this does not seem to make sense if f is not a power of a linear form. Substituting these values gives         (   a  b   )   2   =      A  2    A  0    -   2   A  1    A  1     +    A  0    A  2     =   2  Δ    .         superscript    a  b   2          subscript  A  2    subscript  A  0      2   subscript  A  1    subscript  A  1        subscript  A  0    subscript  A  2            2  normal-Δ      \displaystyle(ab)^{2}=A_{2}A_{0}-2A_{1}A_{1}+A_{0}A_{2}=2\Delta.     Higher degrees  More generally if       f   (  x  )    =     A  0    x  1  n    +    (     n      1     )    A  1    x  1   n  -  1     x  2    +  ⋯  +    A  n    x  2  n           f  x        subscript  A  0    superscript   subscript  x  1   n       binomial  n  1    subscript  A  1    superscript   subscript  x  1     n  1     subscript  x  2    normal-⋯     subscript  A  n    superscript   subscript  x  2   n       \displaystyle f(x)=A_{0}x_{1}^{n}+{\left({{n}\atop{1}}\right)}A_{1}x_{1}^{n-1}%
 x_{2}+\cdots+A_{n}x_{2}^{n}   is a binary form of higher degree, then one introduces new variables a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , c 1 , c 2 , with the properties        f   (  x  )    =    (     a  1    x  1    +    a  2    x  2     )   n   =    (     b  1    x  1    +    b  2    x  2     )   n   =    (     c  1    x  1    +    c  2    x  2     )   n   =  ⋯   .          f  x    superscript       subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2     n         superscript       subscript  b  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  b  2    subscript  x  2     n         superscript       subscript  c  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  c  2    subscript  x  2     n        normal-⋯     f(x)=(a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2})^{n}=(b_{1}x_{1}+b_{2}x_{2})^{n}=(c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}%
 x_{2})^{n}=\cdots.     What this means is that the following two vector spaces are naturally isomorphic:   The vector space of homogeneous polynomials in A 0 ,... A n of degree m  The vector space of polynomials in 2 m variables a 1 , a 2 , b 1 , b 2 , c 1 , c 2 , ... that have degree n in each of the m pairs of variables ( a 1 , a 2 ), ( b 1 , b 2 ), ( c 1 , c 2 ), ... and are symmetric under permutations of the m symbols a , b , ....,   The isomorphism is given by mapping a a , b b , .... to A j . This mapping does not preserve products of polynomials.  More variables  The extension to a form f in more than two variables x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,... is similar: one introduces symbols a 1 , a 2 , a 3 and so on with the properties        f   (  x  )    =    (     a  1    x  1    +    a  2    x  2    +    a  3    x  3    +  ⋯   )   n   =    (     b  1    x  1    +    b  2    x  2    +    b  3    x  3    +  ⋯   )   n   =    (     c  1    x  1    +    c  2    x  2    +    c  3    x  3    +  ⋯   )   n   =  ⋯   .          f  x    superscript       subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2       subscript  a  3    subscript  x  3    normal-⋯   n         superscript       subscript  b  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  b  2    subscript  x  2       subscript  b  3    subscript  x  3    normal-⋯   n         superscript       subscript  c  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  c  2    subscript  x  2       subscript  c  3    subscript  x  3    normal-⋯   n        normal-⋯     f(x)=(a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+a_{3}x_{3}+\cdots)^{n}=(b_{1}x_{1}+b_{2}x_{2}+b_{3%
 }x_{3}+\cdots)^{n}=(c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}+c_{3}x_{3}+\cdots)^{n}=\cdots.     Symmetric products  The rather mysterious formalism of the symbolic method corresponds to embedding a symmetric product S n ( V ) of a vector space V into a tensor product of n copies of V , as the elements preserved by the action of the symmetric group. In fact this is done twice, because the invariants of degree n of a quantic of degree m are the invariant elements of S n S m ( V ), which gets embedded into a tensor product of mn copies of V , as the elements invariant under a wreath product of the two symmetric groups. The brackets of the symbolic method are really invariant linear forms on this tensor product, which give invariants of S n S m ( V ) by restriction.
