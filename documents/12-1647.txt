Brillouin's theorem

In quantum chemistry, Brillouin's theorem, proposed by the French physicist LÃ©on Brillouin in 1934, states that given a self-consistent optimized Hartree-Fock wavefunction 
 
 
 
 , the matrix element of the Hamiltonian between the ground state and a single excited determinant (i.e. one where an occupied orbital a is replaced by a virtual orbital r)








This theorem is important in constructing a configuration interaction method, among other applications.
Proof
The electronic Hamiltonian of the system can be divided into two parts: one consisting one-electron operators 
 
 
 
  and two-electron operators 
 
 
 
 
 . Using the Slater-Condon rules we can simply evaluate








which we recognize is simply an off-diagonal element of the Fock matrix

 
 . But the whole point of the SCF procedure was to diagonalize the Fock matrix and hence for an optimized wavefunction this quantity must be zero.
