   Brillouin's theorem      Brillouin's theorem   In quantum chemistry , Brillouin's theorem , proposed by the French physicist Léon Brillouin in 1934, states that given a self-consistent optimized Hartree-Fock wavefunction    |   ψ  0   ⟩     ket   subscript  ψ  0     |\psi_{0}\rangle   , the matrix element of the Hamiltonian between the ground state and a single excited determinant (i.e. one where an occupied orbital a is replaced by a virtual orbital r )         ⟨   ψ  0   |   H  ^   |   ψ  a  r   ⟩   =  0       quantum-operator-product   subscript  ψ  0    normal-^  H    superscript   subscript  ψ  a   r    0    \langle\psi_{0}|\hat{H}|\psi_{a}^{r}\rangle=0        This theorem is important in constructing a configuration interaction method, among other applications.  Proof  The electronic Hamiltonian of the system can be divided into two parts: one consisting one-electron operators     h   (  1  )    =    -    1  2    ∇  1  2     -    ∑  α     Z  α    r   1  α             h  1           1  2    subscript   superscript  normal-∇  2   1       subscript   α      subscript  Z  α    subscript  r    1  α         h(1)=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^{2}_{1}-\sum_{\alpha}\frac{Z_{\alpha}}{r_{1\alpha}}   and two-electron operators     ∑  j     |    r  1   -   r  j    |    -  1        subscript   j    superscript       subscript  r  1    subscript  r  j       1      \sum_{j}|r_{1}-r_{j}|^{-1}   . Using the Slater-Condon rules we can simply evaluate         ⟨   ψ  0   |   H  ^   |   ψ  a  r   ⟩   =    ⟨  a  |  h  |  r  ⟩   +    ∑  b     ⟨   a  b   |    |   r  b   ⟩           quantum-operator-product   subscript  ψ  0    normal-^  H    superscript   subscript  ψ  a   r       quantum-operator-product  a  h  r     subscript   b      bra    a  b     ket    r  b         \langle\psi_{0}|\hat{H}|\psi_{a}^{r}\rangle=\langle a|h|r\rangle+\sum_{b}%
 \langle ab||rb\rangle        which we recognize is simply an off-diagonal element of the Fock matrix     ⟨   χ  a   |  f  |   χ  r   ⟩     quantum-operator-product   subscript  χ  a   f   subscript  χ  r     \langle\chi_{a}|f|\chi_{r}\rangle   . But the whole point of the SCF procedure was to diagonalize the Fock matrix and hence for an optimized wavefunction this quantity must be zero.
