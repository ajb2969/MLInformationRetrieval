   Archimedes number      Archimedes number   In viscous fluid dynamics , the Archimedes number ( Ar ) (not to be confused with Archimedes' constant , π ), named after the ancient Greek scientist Archimedes is used to determine the motion of fluids due to density differences. It is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of external forces to internal viscous forces 1 and has the form:      Ar  =    g   L  3    ρ  ℓ    (   ρ  -   ρ  ℓ    )     μ  2        Ar      g   superscript  L  3    subscript  ρ  normal-ℓ     ρ   subscript  ρ  normal-ℓ      superscript  μ  2      \mathrm{Ar}=\frac{gL^{3}\rho_{\ell}(\rho-\rho_{\ell})}{\mu^{2}}     where:   g : local external field (for example gravitational acceleration ),  ρ l = density of the fluid,    kg  /   m  3       kg   superscript  normal-m  3     {\rm kg/m}^{3}     ρ = density of the body,    kg  /   m  3       kg   superscript  normal-m  3     {\rm kg/m}^{3}        μ   μ   \mu   = dynamic viscosity,    kg  /  ms      kg  ms    {\rm kg/ms}     L = characteristic length of body, m   When analyzing potentially mixed heat convection of a liquid, the Archimedes number parametrizes the relative strength of free and forced convection . When Ar >> 1 natural convection dominates, i.e. less dense bodies rise and denser bodies sink, and when Ar \frac{\rho - \rho_0}{\rho_0} = \beta \left( T_0 - T \right)  where:      β   β   \beta   is the volumetric expansion coefficient     T   T   T   is temperature  subscript 0 refers to a reference point within the fluid body   Doing this gives the Grashof number , i.e. the Archimedes and Grashof numbers are equivalent but suited to describing situations where there is a material difference in density and heat transfer causes the density difference respectively. The Archimedes number is related to both the Richardson number and Reynolds number via      Ar  =    Ri    Re  2        Ar    Ri   superscript  Re  2      \mathrm{Ar}=\mathrm{Ri}\,\mathrm{Re}^{2}     See also   Viscous fluid dynamics  Convective heat transfer  Galilei number  Grashof number   References    "  Category:Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics  Category:Fluid dynamics     ↩
