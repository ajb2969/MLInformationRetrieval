Half range Fourier series

A half range Fourier series is a Fourier series defined on an interval 
 
 
 
  instead of the more common 
 
 
 
 , with the implication that the analyzed function 
 
 
 
  should be extended to 
 
 
 
 
  as either an even (f(-x)=f(x)) or odd function (f(-x)=-f(x)). This allows the expansion of the function in a series solely of sines (odd) or cosines (even). The choice between odd and even is typically motivated by boundary conditions associated with a differential equation satisfied by 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Calculate the half range Fourier sine series for the function 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  Now, 
 
 

When n is odd, 
 
 
 
  When n is even, 
 
 
 
  thus 
 
 

With the special case 
 
 
 
 , hence the required Fourier sine series is
$\cos(x) =  {{8 \over \pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {n \over(4n^2-1)}\sin(2nx)}$
