   Rationalisation (mathematics)      Rationalisation (mathematics)   In elementary algebra , root rationalisation is a process by which surds in the denominator of an irrational fraction are eliminated.  These surds may be monomials or binomials involving square roots , in simple examples. There are wide extensions to the technique.  Rationalisation of a monomial square root and cube root  For the fundamental technique, the numerator and denominator must be multiplied by the same factor.  Example 1:      10   a       10    a     \frac{10}{\sqrt{a}}     To rationalise this kind of monomial , bring in the factor    a      a    \sqrt{a}   :       10   a    =    10   a    ⋅    a    a     =    10   a      a   2            10    a     normal-⋅    10    a        a     a              10    a     superscript    a   2       \frac{10}{\sqrt{a}}=\frac{10}{\sqrt{a}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a}}=\frac{{1%
 0\sqrt{a}}}{\sqrt{a}^{2}}     The square root disappears from the denominator, because it is squared:        10   a      a   2    =    10   a    a           10    a     superscript    a   2        10    a    a     \frac{{10\sqrt{a}}}{\sqrt{a}^{2}}=\frac{10\sqrt{a}}{a}     This gives the result, after simplification:       10   a    a        10    a    a    \frac{{10\sqrt{a}}}{{a}}     Example 2:      10   b  3       10     3   b     \frac{10}{\sqrt[3]{b}}     To rationalise this radical, bring in the factor     b  3   2     superscript     3   b   2    \sqrt[3]{b}^{2}   :       10   b  3    =    10   b  3    ⋅     b  3   2     b  3   2     =    10    b  3   2      b  3   3            10     3   b     normal-⋅    10     3   b       superscript     3   b   2    superscript     3   b   2              10   superscript     3   b   2     superscript     3   b   3       \frac{10}{\sqrt[3]{b}}=\frac{10}{\sqrt[3]{b}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt[3]{b}^{2}}{\sqrt%
 [3]{b}^{2}}=\frac{{10\sqrt[3]{b}^{2}}}{\sqrt[3]{b}^{3}}     The cube root disappears from the denominator, because it is cubed:        10    b  3   2      b  3   3    =    10    b  3   2    b           10   superscript     3   b   2     superscript     3   b   3        10   superscript     3   b   2    b     \frac{{10\sqrt[3]{b}^{2}}}{\sqrt[3]{b}^{3}}=\frac{10\sqrt[3]{b}^{2}}{b}     This gives the result, after simplification:       10    b  3   2    b        10   superscript     3   b   2    b    \frac{{10\sqrt[3]{b}^{2}}}{{b}}     Dealing with more square roots  For a denominator that is:       2   +    3          2     3     \sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}\,     Rationalisation can be achieved by multiplying by the Conjugate :       2   -    3          2     3     \sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}\,     and applying the difference of two squares identity, which here will yield −1. To get this result, the entire fraction should be multiplied by         2   -   3      2   -   3     =  1.            2     3        2     3     1.    \frac{\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}-\sqrt{3}}=1.     This technique works much more generally. It can easily be adapted to remove one square root at a time, i.e. to rationalise      x  +    y        x    y     x+\sqrt{y}\,     by multiplication by      x  -   y       x    y     x-\sqrt{y}     Example:      3    3   +   5        3      3     5      \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}}     The fraction must be multiplied by a quotient containing     3   -   5         3     5     {\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}}   .        3    3   +   5     ⋅     3   -   5      3   -   5      =    3   (    3   -   5    )       3   2   -    5   2          normal-⋅    3      3     5           3     5        3     5          3      3     5        superscript    3   2    superscript    5   2       \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5}}=%
 \frac{3(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5})}{\sqrt{3}^{2}-\sqrt{5}^{2}}     Now, we can proceed to remove the square roots in the denominator:        3   (    3   -   5    )       3   2   -    5   2     =    3   (    3   -   5    )     3  -  5    =    3   (    3   -   5    )     -  2              3      3     5        superscript    3   2    superscript    5   2         3      3     5       3  5             3      3     5       2       \frac{{3(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5})}}{\sqrt{3}^{2}-\sqrt{5}^{2}}=\frac{3(\sqrt{3}-%
 \sqrt{5})}{3-5}=\frac{3(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{5})}{-2}     Generalisations  Rationalisation can be extended to all algebraic numbers and algebraic functions (as an application of norm forms ). For example, to rationalise a cube root , two linear factors involving cube roots of unity should be used, or equivalently a quadratic factor.
