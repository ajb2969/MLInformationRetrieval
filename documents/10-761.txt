   Cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase      Cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase   In enzymology , a cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + phospholipid olefinic fatty acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + phospholipid cyclopropane fatty acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and phospholipid olefinic fatty acid , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and phospholipid cyclopropane fatty acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:unsaturated-phospholipid methyltransferase (cyclizing) . Other names in common use include cyclopropane synthetase , unsaturated-phospholipid methyltransferase , cyclopropane synthase , cyclopropane fatty acid synthase , cyclopropane fatty acid synthetase , and CFA synthase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
