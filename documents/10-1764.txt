   Cluster state      Cluster state   In quantum information and quantum computing , a cluster state is a type of highly entangled state of multiple qubits . Cluster states are generated in lattices of qubits with Ising type interactions. A cluster C is a connected subset of a d-dimensional lattice, and a cluster state is a pure state of the qubits located on C . They are different from other types of entangled states such as GHZ states or W states because it is more difficult to eliminate quantum entanglement (via projective measurements ) in the case of cluster states. Another way of thinking of cluster states is as a particular instance of graph states , where the underlying graph is a connected subset of a d-dimensional lattice . Cluster states are especially useful in the context of the one-way quantum computer .  Formally a cluster state is a state which obeys the set eigenvalue equations:        K  G   (  a  )     |  G  ⟩    =     (   -  1   )    k  a     |  G  ⟩           superscript   subscript  K  G   a    ket  G       superscript    1    subscript  k  a     ket  G      K_{G}^{(a)}{\left|G\right\rangle}=(-1)^{k_{a}}{\left|G\right\rangle}     where        K  G   (  a  )    =    σ  x   (  a  )      ⊗   b  ∈   N   (  a  )       σ  z   (  b  )       .       superscript   subscript  K  G   a      superscript   subscript  σ  x   a     subscript  tensor-product    b    normal-N  a      superscript   subscript  σ  z   b       K_{G}^{(a)}=\sigma_{x}^{(a)}\bigotimes_{b\in\mathrm{N}(a)}\sigma_{z}^{(b)}.     with    N   (  a  )       N  a    N(a)   denoting the neighbourhood of   a   a   a   .
