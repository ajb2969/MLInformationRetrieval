4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate reductase

In enzymology, a 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate + NAD(P)+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate + NAD(P)H + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate, NAD+ or NADP+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate, NADH or NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis.
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on CH or CH2 groups with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate:NAD(P)+ 4-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include:

dihydrodipicolinate reductase,
dihydrodipicolinic acid reductase, and
2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.
