   Scytalone dehydratase      Scytalone dehydratase   In enzymology , a scytalone dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   scytalone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , scytalone , and two products , 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is scytalone 7,8-hydro-lyase (1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene-forming) . This enzyme is also called scytalone 7,8-hydro-lyase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
