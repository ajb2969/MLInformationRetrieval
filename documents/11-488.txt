Glutathione thiolesterase

In enzymology, a glutathione thiolesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-acylglutathione + H2O 
 
 
 
  glutathione + a carboxylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-acylglutathione and H2O, whereas its two products are glutathione and carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-acylglutathione hydrolase. This enzyme is also called citryl-glutathione thioesterhydrolase.
