25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase

 
25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase (VD3 1A hydroxylase) also known as cytochrome p450 27B1 (CYP27B1) is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CYP27B1 gene.123
VD3 1A hydroxylase is located in the proximal tubule of the kidney and a variety of other tissues, including skin (keratinocytes), immune cells,4 and bone (osteoblasts).5 The enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of Calcifediol to calcitriol (the bioactive form of Vitamin D):6

calcidiol + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  calcitriol + NADP+ + H2O
