Adenosine-tetraphosphatase




Adenosine-tetraphosphatase

In enzymology, an adenosine-tetraphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  ATP + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are ATP and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenosine-tetraphosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
