D-ornithine 4,5-aminomutase

In enzymology, a D-ornithine 4,5-aminomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-ornithine 
 
 
 
  (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-ornithine, and one product, (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring amino groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-ornithine 4,5-aminomutase. Other names in common use include D-alpha-ornithine 5,4-aminomutase, and D-ornithine aminomutase. This enzyme participates in d-arginine and d-ornithine metabolism. It has 3 cofactors: pyridoxal phosphate, Cobamide coenzyme, and Dithiothreitol.
