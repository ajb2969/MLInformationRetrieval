   Password length parameter      Password length parameter   In telecommunication , a password length parameter is a basic parameter the value of which affects password strength against brute force attack and so is a contributor to computer security .  One use of the password length parameters is in the expression    P  =    L  Ã—  R   /  S       P      L  R   S     P=L\times R/S   , where   P   P   P   is the probability that a password can be guessed in its lifetime,   L   L   L   is the maximum lifetime a password can be used to log into a system ,   R   R   R   is the number of guesses per unit of time , and   S   S   S   is the number of unique algorithm-generated passwords (the 'password space').  The degree of password security is determined by the probability that a password can be guessed in its lifetime.  References  "  Category:Computer network security  Category:Password authentication
