Password length parameter

In telecommunication, a password length parameter is a basic parameter the value of which affects password strength against brute force attack and so is a contributor to computer security.
One use of the password length parameters is in the expression 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the probability that a password can be guessed in its lifetime, 
 
 
 
  is the maximum lifetime a password can be used to log into a system, 
 
 
 
  is the number of guesses per unit of time, and 
 
 
 
  is the number of unique algorithm-generated passwords (the 'password space').
The degree of password security is determined by the probability that a password can be guessed in its lifetime.
