   Representation theory of Hopf algebras      Representation theory of Hopf algebras   In abstract algebra , a representation of a Hopf algebra is a representation of its underlying associative algebra . That is, a representation of a Hopf algebra H over a field K is a K - vector space  V with an action  H × V → V usually denoted by juxtaposition ( that is, the image of ( h , v ) is written hv ). The vector space V is called an H -module.  Properties  The module structure of a representation of a Hopf algebra H is simply its structure as a module for the underlying associative algebra. The main use of considering the additional structure of a Hopf algebra is when considering all H -modules as a category. The additional structure is also used to define invariant elements of an H -module V . An element v in V is invariant under H if for all h in H , hv = ε( h ) v , where ε is the counit of H . The subset of all invariant elements of V forms a submodule of V .  Categories of representations as a motivation for Hopf algebras  For an associative algebra H , the tensor product  V 1 ⊗ V 2 of two H -modules V 1 and V 2 is a vector space, but not necessarily an H -module. For the tensor product to be a functorial product operation on H -modules, there must be a linear binary operation Δ : H → H ⊗ H such that for any v in V 1 ⊗ V 2 and any h in H ,        h  v   =   Δ  h   (    v   (  1  )    ⊗   v   (  2  )     )    =      h   (  1  )     v   (  1  )     ⊗   h   (  2  )      v   (  2  )      ,          h  v     normal-Δ  h   tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2             tensor-product     subscript  h  1    subscript  v  1     subscript  h  2     subscript  v  2       hv=\Delta h(v_{(1)}\otimes v_{(2)})=h_{(1)}v_{(1)}\otimes h_{(2)}v_{(2)},     and for any v in V 1 ⊗ V 2 and a and b in H ,        Δ   (   a  b   )    (    v   (  1  )    ⊗   v   (  2  )     )    =    (   a  b   )   v   =   a   [   b   [  v  ]    ]    =   Δ  a   [   Δ  b   (    v   (  1  )    ⊗   v   (  2  )     )    ]    =    (   Δ  a   )    (   Δ  b   )    (    v   (  1  )    ⊗   v   (  2  )     )     .          normal-Δ    a  b    tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2         a  b   v          a   delimited-[]    b   delimited-[]  v             normal-Δ  a   delimited-[]    normal-Δ  b   tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2                normal-Δ  a     normal-Δ  b    tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2        \Delta(ab)(v_{(1)}\otimes v_{(2)})=(ab)v=a[b[v]]=\Delta a[\Delta b(v_{(1)}%
 \otimes v_{(2)})]=(\Delta a)(\Delta b)(v_{(1)}\otimes v_{(2)}).     using sumless Sweedler's notation , which is somewhat like an index free form of Einstein's summation convention . This is satisfied if there is a Δ such that Δ( ab ) = Δ( a )Δ( b ) for all a , b in H .  For the category of H -modules to be a strict monoidal category with respect to ⊗,     V  1   ⊗   (    V  2   ⊗   V  3    )      tensor-product   subscript  V  1    tensor-product   subscript  V  2    subscript  V  3      V_{1}\otimes(V_{2}\otimes V_{3})   and     (    V  1   ⊗   V  2    )   ⊗   V  3      tensor-product   tensor-product   subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2     subscript  V  3     (V_{1}\otimes V_{2})\otimes V_{3}   must be equivalent and there must be unit object ε H , called the trivial module, such that ε H ⊗ V , V and V ⊗ ε H are equivalent.  This means that for any v in        V  1   ⊗   (    V  2   ⊗   V  3    )    =    (    V  1   ⊗   V  2    )   ⊗   V  3         tensor-product   subscript  V  1    tensor-product   subscript  V  2    subscript  V  3      tensor-product   tensor-product   subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2     subscript  V  3      V_{1}\otimes(V_{2}\otimes V_{3})=(V_{1}\otimes V_{2})\otimes V_{3}     and for h in H ,         (    (   id  ⊗  Δ   )   Δ  h   )    (    v   (  1  )    ⊗   v   (  2  )    ⊗   v   (  3  )     )    =        h   (  1  )     v   (  1  )     ⊗   h    (  2  )    (  1  )       v   (  2  )     ⊗   h    (  2  )    (  2  )       v   (  3  )     =   h  v   =    (    (   Δ  ⊗  id   )   Δ  h   )    (    v   (  1  )    ⊗   v   (  2  )    ⊗   v   (  3  )     )     .             tensor-product  id  normal-Δ   normal-Δ  h    tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3        tensor-product     tensor-product     subscript  h  1    subscript  v  1     subscript  h    2  1      subscript  v  2     subscript  h    2  2      subscript  v  3           h  v             tensor-product  normal-Δ  id   normal-Δ  h    tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3        ((\operatorname{id}\otimes\Delta)\Delta h)(v_{(1)}\otimes v_{(2)}\otimes v_{(3%
 )})=h_{(1)}v_{(1)}\otimes h_{(2)(1)}v_{(2)}\otimes h_{(2)(2)}v_{(3)}=hv=((%
 \Delta\otimes\operatorname{id})\Delta h)(v_{(1)}\otimes v_{(2)}\otimes v_{(3)}).     This will hold for any three H -modules if Δ satisfies         (   id  ⊗  Δ   )   Δ  A   =    (   Δ  ⊗  id   )   Δ  A    .         tensor-product  id  normal-Δ   normal-Δ  A      tensor-product  normal-Δ  id   normal-Δ  A     (\operatorname{id}\otimes\Delta)\Delta A=(\Delta\otimes\operatorname{id})%
 \Delta A.     The trivial module must be one-dimensional, and so an algebra homomorphism ε : H → F may be defined such that hv = ε( h ) v for all v in ε H . The trivial module may be identified with F , with 1 being the element such that 1 ⊗ v = v = v ⊗ 1 for all v . It follows that for any v in any H -module V , any c in ε H and any h in H ,         (   ε   (   h   (  1  )    )    h   (  2  )     )   c  v   =      h   (  1  )    c   ⊗   h   (  2  )     v   =   h   (   c  ⊗  v   )    =   h   (   c  v   )    =    (    h   (  1  )    ε   (   h   (  2  )    )    )   c  v    .            ε   subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2    c  v      tensor-product     subscript  h  1   c    subscript  h  2    v          h   tensor-product  c  v           h    c  v              subscript  h  1   ε   subscript  h  2    c  v      (\varepsilon(h_{(1)})h_{(2)})cv=h_{(1)}c\otimes h_{(2)}v=h(c\otimes v)=h(cv)=(%
 h_{(1)}\varepsilon(h_{(2)}))cv.     The existence of an algebra homomorphism ε satisfying       ε   (   h   (  1  )    )    h   (  2  )     =  h  =    h   (  1  )    ε   (   h   (  2  )    )            ε   subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2    h          subscript  h  1   ε   subscript  h  2       \varepsilon(h_{(1)})h_{(2)}=h=h_{(1)}\varepsilon(h_{(2)})     is a sufficient condition for the existence of the trivial module.  It follows that in order for the category of H -modules to be a monoidal category with respect to the tensor product, it is sufficient for H to have maps Δ and ε satisfying these conditions. This is the motivation for the definition of a bialgebra , where Δ is called the comultiplication and ε is called the counit .  In order for each H -module V to have a dual representation  V such that the underlying vector spaces are dual and the operation * is functorial over the monoidal category of H -modules, there must be a linear map S : H → H such that for any h in H , x in V and y in V* ,        ⟨  y  ,   S   (  h  )   x   ⟩   =   ⟨   h  y   ,  x  ⟩    .       y    S  h  x       h  y   x     \langle y,S(h)x\rangle=\langle hy,x\rangle.     where    ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   is the usual pairing of dual vector spaces. If the map    φ  :    V  ⊗   V  *    →   ε  H       normal-:  φ   normal-→   tensor-product  V   superscript  V      subscript  ε  H      \varphi:V\otimes V^{*}\rightarrow\varepsilon_{H}   induced by the pairing is to be an H -homomorphism, then for any h in H , x in V and y in V* ,        φ   (   h   (   x  ⊗  y   )    )    =   φ   (    x  ⊗  S    (   h   (  1  )    )    h   (  2  )    y   )    =   φ   (    S   (   h   (  2  )    )    h   (  1  )    x   ⊗  y   )    =   h  φ   (   x  ⊗  y   )    =   ε   (  h  )   φ   (   x  ⊗  y   )     ,          φ    h   tensor-product  x  y       φ     tensor-product  x  S    subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2   y           φ   tensor-product    S   subscript  h  2    subscript  h  1   x   y           h  φ   tensor-product  x  y           ε  h  φ   tensor-product  x  y       \varphi\left(h(x\otimes y)\right)=\varphi\left(x\otimes S(h_{(1)})h_{(2)}y%
 \right)=\varphi\left(S(h_{(2)})h_{(1)}x\otimes y\right)=h\varphi(x\otimes y)=%
 \varepsilon(h)\varphi(x\otimes y),     which is satisfied if       S   (   h   (  1  )    )    h   (  2  )     =   ε   (  h  )    =    h   (  1  )    S   (   h   (  2  )    )            S   subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2      ε  h           subscript  h  1   S   subscript  h  2       S(h_{(1)})h_{(2)}=\varepsilon(h)=h_{(1)}S(h_{(2)})     for all h in H .  If there is such a map S , then it is called an antipode , and H is a Hopf algebra. The desire for a monoidal category of modules with functorial tensor products and dual representations is therefore one motivation for the concept of a Hopf algebra.  Representations on an algebra  A Hopf algebra also has representations which carry additional structure, namely they are algebras.  Let H be a Hopf algebra. If A is an algebra with the product operation μ : A ⊗ A → A , and ρ : H ⊗ A → A is a representation of H on A , then ρ is said to be a representation of H on an algebra if μ is H - equivariant . As special cases, Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras and groups can also have representations on an algebra.
