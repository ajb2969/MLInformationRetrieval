   Stoner criterion      Stoner criterion   The Stoner criterion is a condition to be fulfilled for the ferromagnetic order to arise in a simplified model of a solid. It is named after Edmund Clifton Stoner .  Stoner model of ferromagnetism  Ferromagnetism ultimately stems from electron-electron interactions. The simplified model of a solid which is nowadays usually called the Stoner model, can be formulated in terms of dispersion relations for spin up and spin down electrons,          E  ↑    (  k  )    =    ϵ   (  k  )    -   I     N  ↑   -   N  ↓    N      ,     E  ↓    (  k  )    =    ϵ   (  k  )    +   I     N  ↑   -   N  ↓    N       ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  E  normal-↑   k       ϵ  k     I       subscript  N  normal-↑    subscript  N  normal-↓    N           subscript  E  normal-↓   k       ϵ  k     I       subscript  N  normal-↑    subscript  N  normal-↓    N        E_{\uparrow}(k)=\epsilon(k)-I\frac{N_{\uparrow}-N_{\downarrow}}{N},\qquad E_{%
 \downarrow}(k)=\epsilon(k)+I\frac{N_{\uparrow}-N_{\downarrow}}{N},     where the second term accounts for the exchange energy,     N  ↑   /  N       subscript  N  normal-↑   N    N_{\uparrow}/N   (     N  ↓   /  N       subscript  N  normal-↓   N    N_{\downarrow}/N   ) is the dimensionless density [1 ] of spin up (down) electrons and    ϵ   (  k  )       ϵ  k    \epsilon(k)   is the dispersion relation of spinless electrons where the electron-electron interaction is disregarded. If     N  ↑   +   N  ↓        subscript  N  normal-↑    subscript  N  normal-↓     N_{\uparrow}+N_{\downarrow}   is fixed,      E  ↑    (  k  )    ,    E  ↓    (  k  )          subscript  E  normal-↑   k      subscript  E  normal-↓   k     E_{\uparrow}(k),E_{\downarrow}(k)   can be used to calculate the total energy of the system as a function of its polarization    P  =    (    N  ↑   -   N  ↓    )   /  N       P       subscript  N  normal-↑    subscript  N  normal-↓    N     P=(N_{\uparrow}-N_{\downarrow})/N   . If the lowest total energy is found for P=0, the system prefers to remain paramagnetic but for larger values of I, polarized ground states occur. It can be shown that for       I  D   (   E  F   )    >  1        I  D   subscript  E  F    1    ID(E_{F})>1     the P=0 state will spontaneously pass into a polarized one. This is the Stoner criterion, expressed in terms of the P=0 density of states [1 ] at the Fermi level    D   (   E  F   )       D   subscript  E  F     D(E_{F})   .  Note that a non-zero P state may be favoured over P=0 even before the Stoner criterion is fulfilled.  Relationship to the Hubbard model  The Stoner model can be obtained from the Hubbard model by applying the mean-field approximation. The particle density operators are written as their mean value    ⟨   n  i   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  n  i     \langle n_{i}\rangle   plus fluctuation     n  i   -   ⟨   n  i   ⟩        subscript  n  i    delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  n  i      n_{i}-\langle n_{i}\rangle   and the product of spin-up and spin-down fluctuations is neglected. We obtain [1 ]       H  =      U    ∑  i     n   i  ,  ↑     ⟨   n   i  ,  ↓    ⟩      +    n   i  ,  ↓     ⟨   n   i  ,  ↑    ⟩     -    ⟨   n   i  ,  ↑    ⟩    ⟨   n   i  ,  ↓    ⟩     +    ∑   i  ,  σ      ϵ  i    n   i  ,  σ        .      H          U    subscript   i      subscript  n   i  normal-↑     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  n   i  normal-↓           subscript  n   i  normal-↓     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  n   i  normal-↑          delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  n   i  normal-↑      delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  n   i  normal-↓         subscript    i  σ       subscript  ϵ  i    subscript  n   i  σ         H=U\sum_{i}n_{i,\uparrow}\langle n_{i,\downarrow}\rangle+n_{i,\downarrow}%
 \langle n_{i,\uparrow}\rangle-\langle n_{i,\uparrow}\rangle\langle n_{i,%
 \downarrow}\rangle+\sum_{i,\sigma}\epsilon_{i}n_{i,\sigma}.     Note the third term which was omitted in the definition above. With this term included, we arrive at the better-known form of the Stoner criterion       D   (   E  F   )   U   >  1.        D   subscript  E  F   U   1.    D(E_{F})U>1.

Having a lattice model in mind, N is the number of lattice sites and    N  ↑     subscript  N  normal-↑    N_{\uparrow}   is the number of spin-up electrons in the whole system. The density of states has the units of inverse energy. On a finite lattice,    ϵ   (  k  )       ϵ  k    \epsilon(k)   is replaced by discrete levels    ϵ  i     subscript  ϵ  i    \epsilon_{i}   and then     D   (  E  )    =    ∑  i    δ   (   E  -   ϵ  i    )           D  E     subscript   i     δ    E   subscript  ϵ  i        D(E)=\sum_{i}\delta(E-\epsilon_{i})   .
