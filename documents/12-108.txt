   Small Veblen ordinal      Small Veblen ordinal   In mathematics, the small Veblen ordinal is a certain large countable ordinal , named after Oswald Veblen . It is occasionally called the Ackermann ordinal , though the Ackermann ordinal described by  is somewhat smaller than the small Veblen ordinal.  Unfortunately there is no standard notation for ordinals beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal Γ 0 . Most systems of notation use symbols such as ψ(α), θ(α), ψ α (β), some of which are modifications of the Veblen functions to produce countable ordinals even for uncountable arguments, and some of which are " collapsing functions ".  The small Veblen ordinal      ϕ   Ω  ω     (  0  )        subscript  ϕ   superscript  normal-Ω  ω    0    \phi_{{\Omega^{\omega}}}(0)   or    θ   (   Ω  ω   )       θ   superscript  normal-Ω  ω     \theta(\Omega^{\omega})   or    ψ   (   Ω   Ω  ω    )       ψ   superscript  normal-Ω   superscript  normal-Ω  ω      \psi(\Omega^{\Omega^{\omega}})   is the limit of ordinals that can be described using a version of Veblen functions with finitely many arguments. It is the ordinal that measures the strength of Kruskal's theorem . It is also the ordinal type of a certain ordering of rooted trees .  References         "  Category:Ordinal numbers
