   Irradiance      Irradiance  In [[radiometry]], '''irradiance''' is the [[radiant flux]] ''recei ved'' by a surface per unit area, and spectral irradiance is the irradiance of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength , depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The SI unit of irradiance is the watt per square metre ( ), while that of spectral irradiance is the watt per square metre per hertz (W¬∑m ‚àí2 ¬∑Hz ‚àí1 ) or the watt per square metre per metre (W¬∑m ‚àí3 )‚Äîcommonly the watt per square metre per nanometre ( ). The CGS unit  erg per square centimeter per second ( ) is often used in astronomy . Irradiance is often called "intensity" in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity .  Mathematical definitions  Irradiance  Irradiance of a surface , denoted E e ("e" for "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as 1        E  e   =    ‚àÇ   Œ¶  e     ‚àÇ  A     ,       subscript  E  normal-e        subscript  normal-Œ¶  normal-e      A      E_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{\partial\Phi_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial A},   where   ‚àÇ is the partial derivative symbol;  Œ¶ e is the radiant flux received ;  A is the area.   If we want to talk about the radiant flux emitted by a surface, we speak of radiant exitance .  Spectral irradiance  Spectral irradiance in frequency of a surface , denoted E e,ŒΩ , is defined as 2        E   e  ,  ŒΩ    =    ‚àÇ   E  e     ‚àÇ  ŒΩ     ,       subscript  E   normal-e  ŒΩ         subscript  E  normal-e      ŒΩ      E_{\mathrm{e},\nu}=\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial\nu},   where ŒΩ is the frequency.  Spectral irradiance in wavelength of a surface , denoted E e,Œª , is defined as 3        E   e  ,  Œª    =    ‚àÇ   E  e     ‚àÇ  Œª     ,       subscript  E   normal-e  Œª         subscript  E  normal-e      Œª      E_{\mathrm{e},\lambda}=\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{e}}}{\partial\lambda},   where Œª is the wavelength.  Property  Irradiance of a surface is also, according to the definition of radiant flux , equal to the time-average of the component of the Poynting vector perpendicular to the surface:        E  e   =    ‚ü®   |  ùêí  |   ‚ü©    cos  Œ±     ,       subscript  E  normal-e      delimited-‚ü®‚ü©    ùêí      Œ±      E_{\mathrm{e}}=\langle|\mathbf{S}|\rangle\cos\alpha,   where   is the time-average;  S is the Poynting vector;  n is a unit vector normal to that surface;  Œ± is the angle between n and S .   For a propagating sinusoidal  linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave , the Poynting vector always points to the direction of propagation while oscillating in magnitude. The irradiance of a surface is then given by 4        E  e   =    n   2   Œº  0   c     E  m  2    cos  Œ±    =     n   Œµ  0   c   2    E  m  2    cos  Œ±     ,         subscript  E  normal-e       n    2   subscript  Œº  0   normal-c     superscript   subscript  E  normal-m   2     Œ±               n   subscript  Œµ  0   normal-c   2    superscript   subscript  E  normal-m   2     Œ±       E_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{n}{2\mu_{0}\mathrm{c}}E_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\cos\alpha=\frac{%
 n\varepsilon_{0}\mathrm{c}}{2}E_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}\cos\alpha,   where   E m is the amplitude of the wave's electric field;  n is the refractive index of the medium of propagation;  c is the speed of light in vacuum ;  Œº 0 is the vacuum permeability ;  Œµ 0 is the vacuum permittivity .   This formula assumes that the magnetic susceptibility is negligible, i.e. that Œº r ‚âà 1 where Œº r is the magnetic permeability of the propagation medium. This assumption is typically valid in transparent media in the optical frequency range.  Solar energy  The global irradiance on a horizontal surface on Earth consists of the direct irradiance E e,dir and diffuse irradiance E e,diff . On a tilted plane, there is another irradiance component, E e,refl , which is the component that is reflected from the ground. The average ground reflection is about 20% of the global irradiance. Hence, the irradiance E e on a tilted plane consists of three components: 5        E  e   =    E   e  ,  dir    +   E   e  ,  diff    +   E   e  ,  refl      .       subscript  E  normal-e      subscript  E   normal-e  dir     subscript  E   normal-e  diff     subscript  E   normal-e  refl       E_{\mathrm{e}}=E_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{dir}}+E_{\mathrm{e},\mathrm{diff}}+E_{%
 \mathrm{e},\mathrm{refl}}.     The integral of solar irradiance over a time period is called " solar exposure " or " insolation ". 6 7  SI radiometry units  See also   Illuminance  Spectral flux density  Albedo  Fluence  Insolation  Light diffusion  PI curve (photosynthesis-irradiance curve)  Solar azimuth angle  Solar irradiation  Solar noon  Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law   References  "  Category:Physical quantities  Category:Radiometry     ‚Ü©    ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©   ‚Ü©
