Stuttering equivalence

In theoretical computer science, stuttering equivalence,1 a relation written as
(Figure)
The paths 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are stuttering equivalent.



 
 ,
can be seen as a partitioning of path 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  into blocks, so that states in the 
 
 
 
  block of one path are labeled (
 
 
 
 ) the same as states in the 
 
 
 
  block of the other path. Corresponding blocks may have different lengths.
Formally, this can be expressed as two infinite paths 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are stuttering equivalent (
 
 
 
 ) if there are two infinite sequences of integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that for every block 
 
 
 
  holds 
 
 
 
 .
Stuttering equivalence is not the same as bisimulation, since bisimulation cannot capture the semantics of the 'eventually' (or 'finally') operator found in linear temporal/computation tree logic(branching time logic)(modal logic). So-called branching bisimulation has to be used.
