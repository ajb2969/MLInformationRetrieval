   D-glutaminase      D-glutaminase   In enzymology , a D-glutaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glutamate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glutamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glutamate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glutamine amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism and nitrogen metabolism .
