   Acyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)—phospholipid O-acyltransferase      Acyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)—phospholipid O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-phospholipid O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + O-(2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)ethanolamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [acyl-carrier protein] + O-(1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)ethanolamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl- acyl-carrier protein and O-(2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)ethanolamine , whereas its two products are acyl-carrier protein and O-(1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)ethanolamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-[acyl-carrier protein]:O-(2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)ethanolamine O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include acyl-[acyl-carrier , protein]:O-(2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-ethanolamine , and O-acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .
