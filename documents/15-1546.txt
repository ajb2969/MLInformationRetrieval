Trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate synthase ((2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate specific)




Trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate synthase ((2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate specific)

Trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate synthase ((2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate specific) () is an enzyme with system name (2Z,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate cistransferase (adding 9--11 isopentenyl units).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + n isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  n diphosphate + trans,polycis-polyprenyl diphosphate (n = 9 - 11)
 

This enzyme has the highest activity with (2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate as allylic substrate.
