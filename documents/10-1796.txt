   Ureidoglycolate lyase      Ureidoglycolate lyase   In enzymology , an ureidoglycolate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-ureidoglycolate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glyoxylate + urea   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (S)-ureidoglycolate , and two products , glyoxylate and urea .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically amidine lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-ureidoglycolate urea-lyase (glyoxylate-forming) . Other names in common use include ureidoglycolatase , ureidoglycolase , ureidoglycolate hydrolase , and (S)-ureidoglycolate urea-lyase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .
