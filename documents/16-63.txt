(+)-alpha-barbatene synthase

(+)-alpha-barbatene synthase (, AtBS) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-alpha-barbatene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-alpha-barbatene + diphosphate


The recombinant enzyme from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana produces alpha-barbatene, thujopsene and beta-chamigrene.
