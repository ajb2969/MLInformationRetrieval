   Nucleoside phosphotransferase      Nucleoside phosphotransferase   In enzymology , a nucleoside phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a nucleotide + a 2'-deoxynucleoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a nucleoside + a 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nucleotide and 2'-deoxynucleoside , whereas its two products are nucleoside and 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nucleotide:nucleoside 5'-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include nonspecific nucleoside phosphotransferase , and nucleotide:3'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphotransferase .
