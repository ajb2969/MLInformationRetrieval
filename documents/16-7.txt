   N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase      N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase   N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase (, MurNAc-6-P etherase , MurQ ) is an enzyme with system name (R)-lactate hydro-lyase (adding N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate; N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (R)-lactate + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate + H 2 O   This enzyme is required for the utilization of anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid in proteobacteria .
