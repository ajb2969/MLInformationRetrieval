N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase

N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase (, MurNAc-6-P etherase, MurQ) is an enzyme with system name (R)-lactate hydro-lyase (adding N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate; N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate-forming).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(R)-lactate + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate + H2O
 

This enzyme is required for the utilization of anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid in proteobacteria.
