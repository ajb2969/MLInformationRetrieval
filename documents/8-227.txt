 Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin (; Krasavka, Saratov Oblast, November 15, 1894 – 21 October 1919, Krasavka) (sometimes transliterated Souslin) was a Russian mathematician who made major contributions to the fields of general topology and descriptive set theory.
His name is especially associated to Suslin's problem, a question relating to totally ordered sets that was eventually found to be independent of the standard system of set-theoretic axioms, ZFC.
He contributed greatly to the theory of analytic sets, sometimes called after him, a kind of a set of reals which is definable via trees. In fact, while he was a research student of Nikolai Luzin (in 1917) he found an error in an argument of Lebesgue, who believed he had proved that for any Borel set in 
 
 
 
  (i. e. the analytic sets), the projection onto the real axis was also a Borel set.
Suslin died of typhus in the 1919 Moscow epidemic following the Russian Civil War.
