Monoterpenol beta-glucosyltransferase




Monoterpenol beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a monoterpenol beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + (-)-menthol 
 
 
 
  UDP + (-)-menthyl O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and (-)-menthol, whereas its two products are UDP and (-)-menthyl O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:(-)-menthol O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-monoterpenol glucosyltransferase, and UDPglucose:monoterpenol glucosyltransferase.
