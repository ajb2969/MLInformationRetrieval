   Multiplier ideal      Multiplier ideal   In commutative algebra , the multiplier ideal associated to a sheaf of ideals over a complex  variety and a real number c consists (locally) of the functions h such that        |  h  |   2    ∑    |   f  i  2   |   c         superscript    h   2      superscript     superscript   subscript  f  i   2    c      \frac{|h|^{2}}{\sum|f_{i}^{2}|^{c}}     is locally integrable , where the f i are a finite set of local generators of the ideal. Multiplier ideals were independently introduced by  (who worked with sheaves over complex manifolds rather than ideals) and , who called them adjoint ideals.  Multiplier ideals are discussed in the survey articles , , and .  Algebraic geometry  In algebraic geometry, the multiplier ideal of an effective   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   - divisor measures singularities coming from the fractional parts of D so to allow one to prove vanishing theorems .  Let X be a smooth complex variety and D an effective   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   -divisor on it. Let    μ  :    X  ′   →  X      normal-:  μ   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   X     \mu:X^{\prime}\to X   be a log resolution of D (e.g., Hironaka's resolution). The multiplier ideal of D is       J   (  D  )    =    μ  *   𝒪   (    K    X  ′   /  X    -   [    μ  *   D   ]    )          J  D      subscript  μ    𝒪     subscript  K     superscript  X  normal-′   X     delimited-[]     superscript  μ    D        J(D)=\mu_{*}\mathcal{O}(K_{X^{\prime}/X}-[\mu^{*}D])   where    K    X  ′   /  X      subscript  K     superscript  X  normal-′   X     K_{X^{\prime}/X}   is the relative canonical divisor     K    X  ′   /  X    =    K   X  ′    -    μ  *    K  X          subscript  K     superscript  X  normal-′   X       subscript  K   superscript  X  normal-′       superscript  μ     subscript  K  X       K_{X^{\prime}/X}=K_{X^{\prime}}-\mu^{*}K_{X}   . It is an ideal sheaf of    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   . If D is integral, then     J   (  D  )    =    𝒪  X    (   -  D   )          J  D      subscript  𝒪  X     D      J(D)=\mathcal{O}_{X}(-D)   .
