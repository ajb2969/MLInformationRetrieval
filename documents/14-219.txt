Multiplier ideal

In commutative algebra, the multiplier ideal associated to a sheaf of ideals over a complex variety and a real number c consists (locally) of the functions h such that



is locally integrable, where the fi are a finite set of local generators of the ideal. Multiplier ideals were independently introduced by  (who worked with sheaves over complex manifolds rather than ideals) and , who called them adjoint ideals.
Multiplier ideals are discussed in the survey articles , , and .
Algebraic geometry
In algebraic geometry, the multiplier ideal of an effective 
 
 
 
 -divisor measures singularities coming from the fractional parts of D so to allow one to prove vanishing theorems.
Let X be a smooth complex variety and D an effective 
 
 
 
 -divisor on it. Let 
 
 
 
  be a log resolution of D (e.g., Hironaka's resolution). The multiplier ideal of D is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the relative canonical divisor
 
 
 
 . It is an ideal sheaf of 
 
 
 
 . If D is integral, then 
 
 
 
 .
