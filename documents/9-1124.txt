   Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies      Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies   In mathematics , Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies is a geometrical result due to the German  mathematician  Hermann Minkowski . The inequality is closely related to the Brunn–Minkowski inequality and the isoperimetric inequality .  Statement of the inequality  Let K and L be two n - dimensional  convex bodies in n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n . Define a quantity V 1 ( K , L ) by        n   V  1    (  K  ,  L  )    =    lim   ε  ↓  0       V   (   K  +   ε  L    )    -   V   (  K  )     ε     ,        n   subscript  V  1    K  L      subscript    normal-↓  ε  0          V    K    ε  L       V  K    ε      nV_{1}(K,L)=\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\frac{V(K+\varepsilon L)-V(K)}{%
 \varepsilon},     where V denotes the n -dimensional Lebesgue measure and + denotes the Minkowski sum . Then         V  1    (  K  ,  L  )    ≥   V    (  K  )     (   n  -  1   )   /  n    V    (  L  )    1  /  n      ,         subscript  V  1    K  L      V   superscript  K      n  1   n    V   superscript  L    1  n       V_{1}(K,L)\geq V(K)^{(n-1)/n}V(L)^{1/n},     with equality if and only if  K and L are homothetic , i.e. are equal up to translation and dilation .  Remarks   V 1 is just one example of a class of quantities known as mixed volumes .  If L is the n -dimensional unit ball  B , then n  V 1 ( K , B ) is the ( n − 1)-dimensional surface measure of K , denoted S ( K ).   Connection to other inequalities  The Brunn–Minkowski inequality  One can show that the Brunn–Minkowski inequality for convex bodies in R n implies Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies in R n , and that equality in the Brunn–Minkowski inequality implies equality in Minkowski's first inequality.  The isoperimetric inequality  By taking L = B , the n -dimensional unit ball, in Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies, one obtains the isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies in R n : if K is a convex body in R n , then         (    V   (  K  )     V   (  B  )     )    1  /  n    ≤    (    S   (  K  )     S   (  B  )     )    1  /   (   n  -  1   )      ,       superscript      V  K     V  B      1  n     superscript      S  K     S  B      1    n  1       \left(\frac{V(K)}{V(B)}\right)^{1/n}\leq\left(\frac{S(K)}{S(B)}\right)^{1/(n-1%
 )},     with equality if and only if K is a ball of some radius.  References     "  Category:Calculus of variations  Category:Geometric inequalities
