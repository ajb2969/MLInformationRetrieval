   Monoid factorisation      Monoid factorisation   In mathematics, a factorisation of a free monoid is a sequence of subsets of words with the property that every word in the free monoid can be written as a concatenation of elements drawn from the subsets. The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that the Lyndon words furnish a factorisation. The Schützenberger theorem relates the definition in terms of a multiplicative property to an additive property.  Let A * be the free monoid on an alphabet A . Let X i be a sequence of subsets of A * indexed by a totally ordered index set I . A factorisation of a word w in A * is an expression      w  =    x   i  1     x   i  2    ⋯   x   i  n         w     subscript  x   subscript  i  1     subscript  x   subscript  i  2    normal-⋯   subscript  x   subscript  i  n       w=x_{i_{1}}x_{i_{2}}\cdots x_{i_{n}}     with     x   i  j    ∈   X   i  j         subscript  x   subscript  i  j     subscript  X   subscript  i  j      x_{i_{j}}\in X_{i_{j}}   and     i  1   ≥   i  2   ≥  …  ≥   i  n          subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2        normal-…        subscript  i  n      i_{1}\geq i_{2}\geq\ldots\geq i_{n}   .  Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem  A Lyndon word over a totally ordered alphabet A is a word which is lexicographically less than all its rotations. 1 The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that every string may be formed in a unique way by concatenating a non-increasing sequence of Lyndon words. Hence taking X l to be the singleton set { l } for each Lyndon word l , with the index set L of Lyndon words ordered lexicographically, we obtain a factorisation of A * . 2 Such a factorisation can be found in linear time. 3  Bisection  A bisection of a free monoid is a factorisation with just two classes X 0 , X 1 . 4  Examples:   A = { a , b }, X 0 = { a * b }, X 1 = { a }.   If X , Y are disjoint sets of non-empty words, then ( X , Y ) is a bisection of A * if and only if 5         Y  X   ∪  A   =   X  ∪   Y     .          Y  X   A     X  Y     YX\cup A=X\cup Y\ .     As a consequence, for any partition P , Q of A + there is a unique bisection ( X , Y ) with X a subset of P and Y a subset of Q . 6  Schützenberger theorem  This theorem states that a sequence X i of subsets of A * forms a factorisation if and only if two of the following three statements holds:   Every element of A * has at least one expression in the required form;  Every element of A * has at most one expression in the required form;  Each conjugate class C meets just one of the monoids M i = X i * and the elements of C in M i are conjugate in M i . 7   References     "  Category:Formal languages     Lothaire (1997) p.64 ↩  Lothaire (1997) p.67 ↩  . ↩  Lothaire (1997) p.68 ↩  Lothaire (1997) p.69 ↩  Lothaire (1997) p.71 ↩  Lothaire (1997) p.92 ↩
