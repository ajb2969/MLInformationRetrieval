Monoid factorisation

In mathematics, a factorisation of a free monoid is a sequence of subsets of words with the property that every word in the free monoid can be written as a concatenation of elements drawn from the subsets. The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that the Lyndon words furnish a factorisation. The Schützenberger theorem relates the definition in terms of a multiplicative property to an additive property.
Let A* be the free monoid on an alphabet A. Let Xi be a sequence of subsets of A* indexed by a totally ordered index set I. A factorisation of a word w in A* is an expression

Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem
A Lyndon word over a totally ordered alphabet A is a word which is lexicographically less than all its rotations.1 The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that every string may be formed in a unique way by concatenating a non-increasing sequence of Lyndon words. Hence taking Xl to be the singleton set {l} for each Lyndon word l, with the index set L of Lyndon words ordered lexicographically, we obtain a factorisation of A*.2 Such a factorisation can be found in linear time.3
Bisection
A bisection of a free monoid is a factorisation with just two classes X0, X1.4
Examples:

A = {a,b}, X0 = {a*b}, X1 = {a}.
 

If X, Y are disjoint sets of non-empty words, then (X,Y) is a bisection of A* if and only if5



As a consequence, for any partition P , Q of A+ there is a unique bisection (X,Y) with X a subset of P and Y a subset of Q.6
Schützenberger theorem
This theorem states that a sequence Xi of subsets of A* forms a factorisation if and only if two of the following three statements holds:

Every element of A* has at least one expression in the required form;
Every element of A* has at most one expression in the required form;
Each conjugate class C meets just one of the monoids Mi = Xi* and the elements of C in Mi are conjugate in Mi.7
