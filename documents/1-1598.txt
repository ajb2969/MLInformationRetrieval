   Alternating group      Alternating group   In mathematics , an alternating group is the group of even permutations of a finite set . The alternating group on the set {1,..., n } is called the alternating group of degree n , or the alternating group on n letters and denoted by A n or Alt( n ).  Basic properties  For , the group A n is the commutator subgroup of the symmetric group  S n with index 2 and has therefore n ! /2 elements. It is the kernel of the signature group homomorphism explained under symmetric group .  The group A n is abelian  if and only if and simple if and only if  or . A 5 is the smallest non-abelian simple group , having order 60, and the smallest non- solvable group .  The group A 4 has a Klein four-group V as a proper normal subgroup , namely the identity and the double transpositions  and maps to , from the sequence . In Galois theory , this map, or rather the corresponding map , corresponds to associating the Lagrange resolvent cubic to a quartic, which allows the quartic polynomial to be solved by radicals, as established by Lodovico Ferrari .  Conjugacy classes  As in the symmetric group , the conjugacy classes in A n consist of elements with the same cycle shape . However, if the cycle shape consists only of cycles of odd length with no two cycles the same length, where cycles of length one are included in the cycle type, then there are exactly two conjugacy classes for this cycle shape .  Examples:   the two permutations (123) and (132) are not conjugates in A 3 , although they have the same cycle shape, and are therefore conjugate in S 3  the permutation (123)(45678) is not conjugate to its inverse (132)(48765) in A 8 , although the two permutations have the same cycle shape, so they are conjugate in S 8 .

For n = 1 and 2, the automorphism group is trivial. For  the automorphism group is Z 2 , with trivial inner automorphism group and outer automorphism group Z 2 .  The outer automorphism group of A 6 is the Klein four-group  , and is related to the outer automorphism of S 6 . The extra outer automorphism in A 6 swaps the 3-cycles (like (123)) with elements of shape 3 2 (like (123)(456)).  Exceptional isomorphisms  There are some exceptional isomorphisms between some of the small alternating groups and small groups of Lie type , particularly projective special linear groups . These are:   A 4 is isomorphic to PSL 2 (3) 1 and the symmetry group of chiral tetrahedral symmetry .  A 5 is isomorphic to PSL 2 (4), PSL 2 (5), and the symmetry group of chiral icosahedral symmetry . (See 2 for an indirect isomorphism of using a classification of simple groups of order 60, and here for a direct proof).  A 6 is isomorphic to PSL 2 (9) and PSp 4 (2)'  A 8 is isomorphic to PSL 4 (2)   More obviously, A 3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group  Z 3 , and A 0 , A 1 , and A 2 are isomorphic to the trivial group (which is also for any q ).

A subgroup of three elements (generated by a cyclic rotation of three objects) with any additional element generates the whole group.  Group homology  The group homology of the alternating groups exhibits stabilization, as in stable homotopy theory : for sufficiently large n , it is constant. However, there are some low-dimensional exceptional homology. Note that the homology of the symmetric group exhibits similar stabilization, but without the low-dimensional exceptions (additional homology elements).  H 1 : Abelianization  The first homology group coincides with abelianization , and (since    A  n     subscript  normal-A  n    \mathrm{A}_{n}   is perfect , except for the cited exceptions) is thus:        H  1    (   A  n   ,  ùêô  )    =  0         subscript  H  1     subscript  normal-A  n   ùêô    0    H_{1}(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathbf{Z})=0   for    n  =   0  ,  1  ,  2       n   0  1  2     n=0,1,2   ;        H  1    (   A  3   ,  ùêô  )    =   A  3  ab   =   A  3   =   ùêô  /  3            subscript  H  1     subscript  normal-A  3   ùêô     superscript   subscript  normal-A  3   ab         subscript  normal-A  3          ùêô  3      H_{1}(\mathrm{A}_{3},\mathbf{Z})=\mathrm{A}_{3}^{\text{ab}}=\mathrm{A}_{3}=%
 \mathbf{Z}/3   ;        H  1    (   A  4   ,  ùêô  )    =   A  4  ab   =   ùêô  /  3            subscript  H  1     subscript  normal-A  4   ùêô     superscript   subscript  normal-A  4   ab          ùêô  3      H_{1}(\mathrm{A}_{4},\mathbf{Z})=\mathrm{A}_{4}^{\text{ab}}=\mathbf{Z}/3   ;        H  1    (   A  n   ,  ùêô  )    =  0         subscript  H  1     subscript  normal-A  n   ùêô    0    H_{1}(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathbf{Z})=0   for    n  ‚â•  5      n  5    n\geq 5   .  This is easily seen directly, as follows.    A  n     subscript  normal-A  n    \mathrm{A}_{n}   is generated by 3-cycles ‚Äì so the only non-trivial abelianization maps are      A  n   ‚Üí   C  3    ,     normal-‚Üí   subscript  normal-A  n    subscript  normal-C  3     \mathrm{A}_{n}\to\mathrm{C}_{3},   since order 3 elements must map to order 3 elements ‚Äì and for    n  ‚â•  5      n  5    n\geq 5   all 3-cycles are conjugate, so they must map to the same element in the abelianization, since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups. Thus a 3-cycle like (123) must map to the same element as its inverse (321), but thus must map to the identity, as it must then have order dividing 2 and 3, so the abelianization is trivial.  For    n  <  3      n  3    n<3   ,    A  n     subscript  normal-A  n    \mathrm{A}_{n}   is trivial, and thus has trivial abelianization. For    A  3     subscript  normal-A  3    \mathrm{A}_{3}   and    A  4     subscript  normal-A  4    \mathrm{A}_{4}   one can compute the abelianization directly, noting that the 3-cycles form two conjugacy classes (rather than all being conjugate) and there are non-trivial maps     A  3   ‚Ü†   C  3      normal-‚Ü†   subscript  normal-A  3    subscript  normal-C  3     \mathrm{A}_{3}\twoheadrightarrow\mathrm{C}_{3}   (in fact an isomorphism) and      A  4   ‚Ü†   C  3    .     normal-‚Ü†   subscript  normal-A  4    subscript  normal-C  3     \mathrm{A}_{4}\twoheadrightarrow\mathrm{C}_{3}.     H 2 : Schur multipliers  The Schur multipliers of the alternating groups A n (in the case where n is at least 5) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where n is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is (the cyclic group) of order 6. 3 These were first computed in .        H  2    (   A  n   ,  ùêô  )    =  0         subscript  H  2     subscript  normal-A  n   ùêô    0    H_{2}(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathbf{Z})=0   for    n  =   1  ,  2  ,  3       n   1  2  3     n=1,2,3   ;        H  2    (   A  n   ,  ùêô  )    =   ùêô  /  2          subscript  H  2     subscript  normal-A  n   ùêô      ùêô  2     H_{2}(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathbf{Z})=\mathbf{Z}/2   for    n  =   4  ,  5       n   4  5     n=4,5   ;        H  2    (   A  n   ,  ùêô  )    =   ùêô  /  6          subscript  H  2     subscript  normal-A  n   ùêô      ùêô  6     H_{2}(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathbf{Z})=\mathbf{Z}/6   for    n  =   6  ,  7       n   6  7     n=6,7   ;        H  2    (   A  n   ,  ùêô  )    =   ùêô  /  2          subscript  H  2     subscript  normal-A  n   ùêô      ùêô  2     H_{2}(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathbf{Z})=\mathbf{Z}/2   for    n  ‚â•  8      n  8    n\geq 8   .
