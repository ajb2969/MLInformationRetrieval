   Poisson algebra      Poisson algebra   In mathematics , a Poisson algebra is an associative algebra together with a Lie bracket that also satisfies Leibniz' law ; that is, the bracket is also a derivation . Poisson algebras appear naturally in Hamiltonian mechanics , and are also central in the study of quantum groups . Manifolds with a Poisson algebra structure are known as Poisson manifolds , of which the symplectic manifolds and the Poisson-Lie groups are a special case. The algebra is named in honour of Siméon Denis Poisson .  Definition  A Poisson algebra is a vector space over a field  K equipped with two bilinear products, ⋅ and {, }, having the following properties:   The product ⋅ forms an associative K -algebra .    The product {, }, called the Poisson bracket , forms a Lie algebra , and so it is anti-symmetric, and obeys the Jacobi identity .    The Poisson bracket acts as a derivation of the associative product ⋅, so that for any three elements x , y and z in the algebra, one has { x , y ⋅ z } = { x , y } ⋅ z + y ⋅ { x , z }.   The last property often allows a variety of different formulations of the algebra to be given, as noted in the examples below.  Examples  Poisson algebras occur in various settings.  Symplectic manifolds  The space of real-valued smooth functions over a symplectic manifold forms a Poisson algebra. On a symplectic manifold, every real-valued function H on the manifold induces a vector field X H , the Hamiltonian vector field . Then, given any two smooth functions F and G over the symplectic manifold, the Poisson bracket may be defined as:       {  F  ,  G  }   =   d  G   (   X  F   )    =    X  F    (  G  )           F  G     d  G   subscript  X  F            subscript  X  F   G      \{F,G\}=dG(X_{F})=X_{F}(G)\,   .  This definition is consistent in part because the Poisson bracket acts as a derivation. Equivalently, one may define the bracket {,} as       X   {  F  ,  G  }    =   [   X  F   ,   X  G   ]        subscript  X   F  G      subscript  X  F    subscript  X  G      X_{\{F,G\}}=[X_{F},X_{G}]\,     where [,] is the Lie derivative . When the symplectic manifold is R 2 n with the standard symplectic structure, then the Poisson bracket takes on the well-known form        {  F  ,  G  }   =     ∑   i  =  1   n      ∂  F    ∂   q  i       ∂  G    ∂   p  i       -     ∂  F    ∂   p  i       ∂  G    ∂   q  i        .       F  G       superscript   subscript     i  1    n         F      subscript  q  i         G      subscript  p  i             F      subscript  p  i         G      subscript  q  i         \{F,G\}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial F}{\partial q_{i}}\frac{\partial G}{%
 \partial p_{i}}-\frac{\partial F}{\partial p_{i}}\frac{\partial G}{\partial q_%
 {i}}.     Similar considerations apply for Poisson manifolds , which generalize symplectic manifolds by allowing the symplectic bivector to be vanishing on some (or trivially, all) of the manifold.  Associative algebras  If A is an associative algebra , then the commutator [ x , y ]≡ xy − yx turns it into a Poisson algebra.  Vertex operator algebras  For a vertex operator algebra  (V,Y, ω, 1) , the space V/C 2 (V) is a Poisson algebra with {a, b} = a 0 b and a ⋅ b = a −1 b . For certain vertex operator algebras, these Poisson algebras are finite-dimensional.
