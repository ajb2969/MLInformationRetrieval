Supporting functional

In convex analysis and mathematical optimization, the supporting functional is a generalization of the supporting hyperplane of a set.
Mathematical definition
Let X be a locally convex topological space, and 
 
 
 
  be a convex set, then the continuous linear functional

 
  is a supporting functional of C at the point 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 
  for every

Relation to support function
If 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the dual space of 
 
 
 
 ) is a support function of the set C, then if 
 
 
 
 
 , it follows that 
 
 
 
  defines a supporting functional 
 
 
 
  of C at the point 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 
 .
Relation to supporting hyperplane
If 
 
 
 
  is a supporting functional of the convex set C at the point 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  then 
 
 
 
  defines a supporting hyperplane to C at
