   Laminaribiose phosphorylase      Laminaribiose phosphorylase   In enzymology , a laminaribiose phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-beta-D-glucosyl-D-glucose + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-beta-D-glucosyl-D-glucose and phosphate , whereas its two products are D-glucose and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-beta-D-glucosyl-D-glucose:phosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
