   Triacetate-lactonase      Triacetate-lactonase   In enzymology , a triacetate-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   triacetate lactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   triacetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are triacetate lactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is triacetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is triacetolactone lactonohydrolase . Other names in common use include triacetic lactone hydrolase , triacetic acid lactone hydrolase , TAL hydrolase , and triacetate lactone hydrolase .
