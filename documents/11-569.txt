In enzymology, a triacetate-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

triacetate lactone + H2O 
 
 
 
  triacetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are triacetate lactone and H2O, whereas its product is triacetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is triacetolactone lactonohydrolase. Other names in common use include triacetic lactone hydrolase, triacetic acid lactone hydrolase, TAL hydrolase, and triacetate lactone hydrolase.
