   Linear flow on the torus      Linear flow on the torus   In mathematics , especially in the area of mathematical analysis known as dynamical systems theory , a linear flow on the torus is a flow on the n -dimensional torus       𝕋  n   =      S  1   ×   S  1   ×  ⋯  ×   S  1    ⏟   n        superscript  𝕋  n    subscript   normal-⏟     superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1   normal-⋯   superscript  S  1     n     \mathbb{T}^{n}=\underbrace{S^{1}\times S^{1}\times\cdots\times S^{1}}_{n}     which is represented by the following differential equations with respect to the standard angular coordinates (θ 1 , θ 2 , ..., θ n ):          d   θ  1     d  t    =   ω  1    ,      d   θ  2     d  t    =    ω  2   ,  ⋯    ,     d   θ  n     d  t    =   ω  n      .     formulae-sequence        d   subscript  θ  1      d  t     subscript  ω  1     formulae-sequence        d   subscript  θ  2      d  t      subscript  ω  2   normal-⋯          d   subscript  θ  n      d  t     subscript  ω  n       \frac{d\theta_{1}}{dt}=\omega_{1},\quad\frac{d\theta_{2}}{dt}=\omega_{2},\quad%
 \cdots,\quad\frac{d\theta_{n}}{dt}=\omega_{n}.     The solution of these equations can explicitly be expressed as         Φ  ω  t    (   θ  1   ,   θ  2   ,  …  ,   θ  n   )    =    (    θ  1   +    ω  1   t    ,    θ  2   +    ω  2   t    ,  …  ,    θ  n   +    ω  n   t    )   mod   2  π     .         superscript   subscript  normal-Φ  ω   t     subscript  θ  1    subscript  θ  2   normal-…   subscript  θ  n      modulo      subscript  θ  1      subscript  ω  1   t       subscript  θ  2      subscript  ω  2   t    normal-…     subscript  θ  n      subscript  ω  n   t       2  π      \Phi_{\omega}^{t}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\dots,\theta_{n})=(\theta_{1}+\omega_{%
 1}t,\theta_{2}+\omega_{2}t,\dots,\theta_{n}+\omega_{n}t)\mod 2\pi.     If we respesent the torus as R n / Z n we see that a starting point is moved by the flow in the direction ω=(ω 1 , ω 2 , ..., ω n ) at constant speed and when it reaches the border of the unitary n -cube it jumps to the opposite face of the cube.  For a linear flow on the torus either all orbits are periodic or all orbits are dense on a subset of the n -torus which is a k -torus. When the components of ω are rationally independent all the orbits are dense on the whole space. This can be easily seen in the two dimensional case: if the two components of ω are rationally independent then the Poincaré section of the flow on an edge of the unit square is an irrational rotation on a circle and therefore its orbits are dense on the circle, as a consequence the orbits of the flow must be dense on the torus.
