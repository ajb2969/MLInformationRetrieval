Protoaphin-aglucone dehydratase (cyclizing)

In enzymology, a protoaphin-aglucone dehydratase (cyclizing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

protoaphin aglucone 
 
 
 
  xanthoaphin + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, protoaphin aglucone, and two products, xanthoaphin and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is protoaphin-aglucone hydro-lyase (cyclizing; xanthoaphin-forming). Other names in common use include protoaphin dehydratase, protoaphin dehydratase (cyclizing), and protoaphin-aglucone hydro-lyase (cyclizing).
