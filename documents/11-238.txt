   Protoaphin-aglucone dehydratase (cyclizing)      Protoaphin-aglucone dehydratase (cyclizing)   In enzymology , a protoaphin-aglucone dehydratase (cyclizing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protoaphin aglucone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   xanthoaphin + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , protoaphin aglucone , and two products , xanthoaphin and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is protoaphin-aglucone hydro-lyase (cyclizing; xanthoaphin-forming) . Other names in common use include protoaphin dehydratase , protoaphin dehydratase (cyclizing) , and protoaphin-aglucone hydro-lyase (cyclizing) .
