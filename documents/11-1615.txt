   Sulfate adenylyltransferase (ADP)      Sulfate adenylyltransferase (ADP)   In enzymology , a sulfate adenylyltransferase (ADP) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP + sulfate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + adenylyl sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and sulfate , whereas its two products are phosphate and adenylyl sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP:sulfate adenylyltransferase . Other names in common use include ADP-sulfurylase , sulfate (adenosine diphosphate) adenylyltransferase , and adenosine diphosphate sulfurylase . This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism .
