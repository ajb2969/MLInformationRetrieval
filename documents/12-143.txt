   Von Neumann's inequality      Von Neumann's inequality   In operator theory , von Neumann's inequality , due to John von Neumann , states that, for a fixed contraction T , the polynomial functional calculus map is itself a contraction.  Formal statement  For a contraction  T acting on a Hilbert space and a polynomial p , then the norm of p ( T ) is bounded by the supremum of | p ( z )| for z in the unit disk ." 1  Proof  The inequality can be proved by considering the unitary dilation of T , for which the inequality is obvious.  Generalizations  This inequality is a specific case of Matsaev's conjecture. That is that for any polynomial P and contraction T on    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}           ||   P   (  T  )    ||    L  p    ≤    ||   P   (  S  )    ||    ℓ  p         subscript   norm    P  T     superscript  L  p     subscript   norm    P  S     superscript  normal-ℓ  p      ||P(T)||_{L^{p}}\leq||P(S)||_{\ell^{p}}     where S is the right-shift operator. The von Neumann inequality proves it true for    p  =  2      p  2    p=2   and for    p  =  1      p  1    p=1   and    p  =  ∞      p     p=\infty   it is true by straightforward calculation. S.W. Drury has recently shown that the conjecture fails in the general case. 2  References    "  Category:Operator theory  Category:Inequalities     Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University Colloquium, AY 2007-2008 ↩  S.W.
