Von Neumann's inequality

In operator theory, von Neumann's inequality, due to John von Neumann, states that, for a fixed contraction T, the polynomial functional calculus map is itself a contraction.
Formal statement
For a contraction T acting on a Hilbert space and a polynomial p, then the norm of p(T) is bounded by the supremum of |p(z)| for z in the unit disk."1
Proof
The inequality can be proved by considering the unitary dilation of T, for which the inequality is obvious.
Generalizations
This inequality is a specific case of Matsaev's conjecture. That is that for any polynomial P and contraction T on 
 
 




where S is the right-shift operator. The von Neumann inequality proves it true for 
 
 
 
  and for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  it is true by straightforward calculation. S.W.Â Drury has recently shown that the conjecture fails in the general case.2
