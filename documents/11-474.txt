   Dolichyl-phosphatase      Dolichyl-phosphatase   In enzymology , a dolichyl-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dolichyl phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dolichol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dolichol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , to be specific, those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include dolichol phosphate phosphatase , dolichol phosphatase , dolichol monophosphatase , dolichyl monophosphate phosphatase , dolichyl phosphate phosphatase , polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase , polyprenylphosphate phosphatase , and Dol-P phosphatase . This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
