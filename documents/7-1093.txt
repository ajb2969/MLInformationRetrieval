   Air-to-cloth ratio      Air-to-cloth ratio   The air-to-cloth ratio is the volumetric flow rate of air (m³/ minute ; SI m³/ second ) flowing through a dust collector 's inlet duct divided by the total cloth area (m²) in the filters. The result is expressed in units of velocity .      v  =     V  /  Δ   t   A       v        V  normal-Δ   t   A     v={V/\Delta t\over{A}}     The air-to-cloth ratio is typically between 1.5 and 3.5 metres per minute , mainly depending on the concentration of dust loading.
