   Ewens's sampling formula      Ewens's sampling formula   In population genetics , Ewens' sampling formula , describes the probabilities associated with counts of how many different alleles are observed a given number of times in the sample.  Definition  Ewens' sampling formula, introduced by Warren Ewens , states that under certain conditions (specified below), if a random sample of n  gametes is taken from a population and classified according to the gene at a particular locus then the probability that there are a 1  alleles represented once in the sample, and a 2 alleles represented twice, and so on, is        Pr   (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   ;  θ  )    =     n  !    θ   (   θ  +  1   )   ⋯   (    θ  +  n   -  1   )       ∏   j  =  1   n     θ   a  j      j   a  j      a  j   !        ,       Pr   subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n   θ         n     θ    θ  1   normal-⋯      θ  n   1       superscript   subscript  product    j  1    n      superscript  θ   subscript  a  j       superscript  j   subscript  a  j       subscript  a  j          \operatorname{Pr}(a_{1},\dots,a_{n};\theta)={n!\over\theta(\theta+1)\cdots(%
 \theta+n-1)}\prod_{j=1}^{n}{\theta^{a_{j}}\over j^{a_{j}}a_{j}!},     for some positive number θ , whenever a 1 , ..., a n is a sequence of nonnegative integers such that         a  1   +   2   a  2    +   3   a  3    +  ⋯  +   n   a  n     =  n   .         subscript  a  1     2   subscript  a  2      3   subscript  a  3    normal-⋯    n   subscript  a  n     n    a_{1}+2a_{2}+3a_{3}+\cdots+na_{n}=n.\,     The phrase "under certain conditions" used above is made precise by the following assumptions:   The sample size n is small by comparison to the size of the whole population; and  The population is in statistical equilibrium under mutation and genetic drift and the role of selection at the locus in question is negligible; and  Every mutant allele is novel. (See also idealised population .)   This is a probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the integer  n . Among probabilists and statisticians it is often called the multivariate Ewens distribution .  Mathematical properties  When θ = 0, the probability is 1 that all n genes are the same. When θ = 1, then the distribution is precisely that of the integer partition induced by a uniformly distributed random permutation . As θ → ∞, the probability that no two of the n genes are the same approaches 1.  This family of probability distributions enjoys the property that if after the sample of n is taken, m of the n gametes are chosen without replacement, then the resulting probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the smaller integer m is just what the formula above would give if m were put in place of n .  The Ewens distribution arises naturally from the Chinese restaurant process .
