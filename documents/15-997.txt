Plastoquinol/plastocyanin reductase

Plastoquinol/plastocyanin reductase (, plastoquinol/plastocyanin oxidoreductase, cytochrome f/b6 complex) is an enzyme with system name plastoquinol:oxidized-plastocyanin oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

plastoquinol + 2 oxidized plastocyanin + 2 H+ [side 1] 
 
 
plastoquinone + 2 reduced plastocyanin + 2 H+ [side 2]
 

Plastoquinol reductase contains two b-type cytochromes, two c-type cytochromes (cn and f), and a [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster.
