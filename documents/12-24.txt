   Ampère's force law      Ampère's force law   (Figure)  The top wire with current I 1 experiences a Lorentz force F 12 due to magnetic field B 2 created by the bottom wire. (Not shown is the simultaneous process where the bottom wire I 2 experiences a magnetic force F 21 due to magnetic field B 1 created by the top wire.)   In magnetostatics , the force of attraction or repulsion between two current-carrying wires (see first figure below) is often called Ampère's force law . The physical origin of this force is that each wire generates a magnetic field, as defined by the Biot–Savart law , and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a consequence, as defined by the Lorentz force .  Equation  The best-known and simplest example of Ampère's force law, which underlies the definition of the ampere , the SI unit of current, states that the force per unit length between two straight parallel conductors is          F  m   L   =   2   k  A      I  1    I  2    r           subscript  F  m   L     2   subscript  k  A        subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2    r      \frac{F_{m}}{L}=2k_{A}\frac{I_{1}I_{2}}{r}   ,     where k A is the magnetic force constant from the Biot–Savart law , F m /L is the total force on either wire per unit length of the shorter (the longer is approximated as infinitely long relative to the shorter), r is the distance between the two wires, and I 1 , I 2 are the direct currents carried by the wires.  This is a good approximation if one wire is sufficiently longer than the other that it can be approximated as infinitely long, and if the distance between the wires is small compared to their lengths (so that the one infinite-wire approximation holds), but large compared to their diameters (so that they may also be approximated as infinitely thin lines). The value of k A depends upon the system of units chosen, and the value of k A decides how large the unit of current will be. In the SI system, 1  2          k  A      =    def       μ  0    4  π         subscript  k  A     def  absent        subscript  μ  0     4  π      k_{A}\ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\ \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}        with μ 0 the magnetic constant , defined in SI units as 3 4           μ  0     =    def    4  π   ×   10   -  7           subscript  μ  0     def  absent     4  π    superscript  10    7      \mu_{0}\ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\ 4\pi\times 10^{-7}    N / A 2 .     Thus, in vacuum,   ''the force per meter of length between two parallel conductors – spaced apart by 1 m and each carrying a current of 1 A – is exactly''         2  ×   10   -  7        2   superscript  10    7      \displaystyle 2\times 10^{-7}    N / m .     The general formulation of the magnetic force for arbitrary geometries is based on iterated line integrals and combines the Biot–Savart law and Lorentz force in one equation as shown below. 5   6 7          F  →   12   =     μ  0    4  π      ∫   L  1      ∫   L  2        I  1   d     ℓ  →   1     ×   (     I  2   d     ℓ  →   2     ×    𝐫  ^   21    )      |  r  |   2            subscript   normal-→  F   12        subscript  μ  0     4  π      subscript    subscript  L  1      subscript    subscript  L  2           subscript  I  1   d   subscript   normal-→  normal-ℓ   1         subscript  I  2   d   subscript   normal-→  normal-ℓ   2     subscript   normal-^  𝐫   21      superscript    r   2         \vec{F}_{12}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\int_{L_{1}}\int_{L_{2}}\frac{I_{1}d\vec{\ell%

To determine the force between wires in a material medium, the magnetic constant is replaced by the actual permeability of the medium.  Historical Background  (Figure)  Diagram of original Ampere experiment   The form of Ampere's force law commonly given was derived by Maxwell and is one of several expressions consistent with the original experiments of Ampere and Gauss . The x-component of the force between two linear currents I and I’, as depicted in the diagram to the right, was given by Ampere in 1825 and Gauss in 1833 as follows: 8        d   F  x    =   k  I   I  ′   d   s  ′    ∫   d  s      cos   (   x  d  s   )     cos   (   r  d   s  ′    )     -    cos   (   r  x   )     cos   (   d  s  d   s  ′    )       r  2        .        d   subscript  F  x      k  I   superscript  I  normal-′   d   superscript  s  normal-′       d  s            x  d  s        r  d   superscript  s  normal-′            r  x        d  s  d   superscript  s  normal-′        superscript  r  2         dF_{x}=kII^{\prime}ds^{\prime}\int ds\frac{\cos(xds)\cos(rds^{\prime})-\cos(rx%
 )\cos(dsds^{\prime})}{r^{2}}.     Following Ampere, a number of scientists, including Wilhelm Weber , Rudolf Clausius , James Clerk Maxwell , Bernhard Riemann and Walter Ritz , developed this expression to find a fundamental expression of the force. Through differentiation, it can be shown that:         cos   (   x  d  s   )     cos   (   r  d   s  ′    )      r  2    =   -    cos   (   r  x   )      (    cos  ϵ   -   3   cos  ϕ    cos   ϕ  ′      )    r  2                  x  d  s        r  d   superscript  s  normal-′       superscript  r  2            r  x          ϵ     3    ϕ      superscript  ϕ  normal-′       superscript  r  2        \frac{\cos(xds)\cos(rds^{\prime})}{r^{2}}=-\cos(rx)\frac{(\cos\epsilon-3\cos%
 \phi\cos\phi^{\prime})}{r^{2}}   .  and also the identity:         cos   (   r  x   )     cos   (   d  s  d   s  ′    )      r  2    =     cos   (   r  x   )     cos  ϵ     r  2                r  x        d  s  d   superscript  s  normal-′       superscript  r  2            r  x      ϵ     superscript  r  2      \frac{\cos(rx)\cos(dsds^{\prime})}{r^{2}}=\frac{\cos(rx)\cos\epsilon}{r^{2}}   .  With these expressions, Ampere's force law can be expressed as:       d   F  x    =   k  I   I  ′   d   s  ′    ∫   d   s  ′    cos   (   r  x   )       2   cos  ϵ    -   3   cos  ϕ    cos   ϕ  ′       r  2             d   subscript  F  x      k  I   superscript  I  normal-′   d   superscript  s  normal-′       d   superscript  s  normal-′       r  x          2    ϵ      3    ϕ      superscript  ϕ  normal-′       superscript  r  2         dF_{x}=kII^{\prime}ds^{\prime}\int ds^{\prime}\cos(rx)\frac{2\cos\epsilon-3%
 \cos\phi\cos\phi^{\prime}}{r^{2}}   .  Using the identities:         ∂  r    ∂  s    =   cos  ϕ    ,     ∂  r    ∂   s  ′     =   -   cos   ϕ  ′         formulae-sequence        r     s      ϕ          r      superscript  s  normal-′          superscript  ϕ  normal-′        \frac{\partial r}{\partial s}=\cos\phi,\frac{\partial r}{\partial s^{\prime}}=%
 -\cos\phi^{\prime}   .  and         ∂  2   r     ∂  s    ∂   s  ′      =     -   cos  ϵ    +    cos  ϕ    cos   ϕ  ′      r           superscript   2   r       s      superscript  s  normal-′              ϵ        ϕ      superscript  ϕ  normal-′      r     \frac{\partial^{2}r}{\partial s\partial s^{\prime}}=\frac{-\cos\epsilon+\cos%
 \phi\cos\phi^{\prime}}{r}   .  Ampere's results can be expressed in the form:        d  2   F   =     k  I   I  ′   d  s  d   s  ′     r  2     (      ∂  r    ∂  s      ∂  r    ∂   s  ′      -   2  r     ∂  2   r     ∂  s    ∂   s  ′        )           superscript  d  2   F         k  I   superscript  I  normal-′   d  s  d   superscript  s  normal-′     superscript  r  2            r     s        r      superscript  s  normal-′        2  r      superscript   2   r       s      superscript  s  normal-′           d^{2}F=\frac{kII^{\prime}dsds^{\prime}}{r^{2}}\left(\frac{\partial r}{\partial
 s%
 }\frac{\partial r}{\partial s^{\prime}}-2r\frac{\partial^{2}r}{\partial s%
 \partial s^{\prime}}\right)   .  As Maxwell noted, terms can be added to this expression, which are derivatives of a function Q(r) and, when integrated, cancel each other out. Thus, Maxwell gave "the most general form consistent with the experimental facts" for the force on ds arising from the action of ds': 9        d  2    F  x    =   k  I   I  ′   d  s  d   s  ′    [      (     1   r  2     (      ∂  r    ∂  s      ∂  r    ∂   s  ′      -   2  r     ∂  2   r     ∂  s    ∂   s  ′        )    +   r     ∂  2   Q     ∂  s    ∂   s  ′        )    cos   (   r  x   )     +     ∂  Q    ∂   s  ′      cos   (   x  d  s   )      -     ∂  Q    ∂  s     cos   (   x  d   s  ′    )      ]           superscript  d  2    subscript  F  x      k  I   superscript  I  normal-′   d  s  d   superscript  s  normal-′    delimited-[]              1   superscript  r  2            r     s        r      superscript  s  normal-′        2  r      superscript   2   r       s      superscript  s  normal-′           r      superscript   2   Q       s      superscript  s  normal-′            r  x           Q      superscript  s  normal-′         x  d  s            Q     s        x  d   superscript  s  normal-′           d^{2}F_{x}=kII^{\prime}dsds^{\prime}\left[\left(\frac{1}{r^{2}}\left(\frac{%

 (xds)-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial s}\cos(xds^{\prime})\right]   .  Q is a function of r, according to Maxwell, which "cannot be determined, without assumptions of some kind, from experiments in which the active current forms a closed circuit." Taking the function Q(r) to be of the form:      Q  =   -    (   1  +  k   )    2  r         Q        1  k     2  r       Q=-\frac{(1+k)}{2r}     We obtain the general expression for the force exerted on ds by ds:        𝐝  𝟐   𝐅   =   -     k  I   I  ′     2   r  2      [     (   3  -  k   )     𝐫  𝟏   ^    (   𝐝𝐬𝐝𝐬  ′   )    -   3   (   1  -  k   )     𝐫  𝟏   ^    (     𝐫  𝟏   ^   𝐝𝐬   )    (     𝐫  𝟏   ^    𝐝𝐬  ′    )    -    (   1  +  k   )   𝐝𝐬   (     𝐫  𝟏   ^    𝐝𝐬  ′    )    -    (   1  +  k   )    𝐝  ′   𝐬   (     𝐫  𝟏   ^   𝐝𝐬   )     ]            superscript  𝐝  2   𝐅           k  I   superscript  I  normal-′      2   superscript  r  2      delimited-[]        3  k    normal-^   subscript  𝐫  1     superscript  𝐝𝐬𝐝𝐬  normal-′      3    1  k    normal-^   subscript  𝐫  1       normal-^   subscript  𝐫  1    𝐝𝐬      normal-^   subscript  𝐫  1     superscript  𝐝𝐬  normal-′         1  k   𝐝𝐬     normal-^   subscript  𝐫  1     superscript  𝐝𝐬  normal-′         1  k    superscript  𝐝  normal-′   𝐬     normal-^   subscript  𝐫  1    𝐝𝐬          \mathbf{d^{2}F}=-\frac{kII^{\prime}}{2r^{2}}\left[(3-k)\hat{\mathbf{r_{1}}}(%

Thus, as far as the original Ampere experiments are concerned, the value of k has no significance. Ampere took k=-1; Gauss took k=+1, as did Grassmann and Clausius, although Clausius omitted the S component. In the non-ethereal electron theories, Weber took k=-1 and Riemann took k=+1. Ritz left k undetermined in his theory. If we take k = -1, we obtain the Ampere expression:        𝐝  𝟐   𝐅   =   -     k  I   I  ′     r  3     [    2  𝐫   (   𝐝𝐬𝐝𝐬  ′   )    -   3  𝐫   (  𝐫𝐝𝐬  )    (   𝐫𝐝𝐬  ′   )     ]            superscript  𝐝  2   𝐅           k  I   superscript  I  normal-′     superscript  r  3     delimited-[]      2  𝐫   superscript  𝐝𝐬𝐝𝐬  normal-′      3  𝐫  𝐫𝐝𝐬   superscript  𝐫𝐝𝐬  normal-′          \mathbf{d^{2}F}=-\frac{kII^{\prime}}{r^{3}}\left[2\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{dsds^{%

Next, we integrate    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   from    -  ∞         -\infty   to    +  ∞         +\infty   :        F  →   12   =      μ  0    I  1    I  2     4  π     2  D    (  0  ,   -  1   ,  0  )     ∫   L  1     d   x  1           subscript   normal-→  F   12          subscript  μ  0    subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2      4  π      2  D    0    1   0     subscript    subscript  L  1      d   subscript  x  1        \vec{F}_{12}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{1}I_{2}}{4\pi}\frac{2}{D}(0,-1,0)\int_{L_{1}}dx_{1}   . If wire 1 is also infinite, the integral diverges, because the total attractive force between two infinite parallel wires is infinity. In fact, what we really want to know is the attractive force per unit length of wire 1. Therefore, assume wire 1 has a large but finite length    L  1     subscript  L  1    L_{1}   . Then the force vector felt by wire 1 is:        F  →   12   =      μ  0    I  1    I  2     4  π     2  D    (  0  ,   -  1   ,  0  )    L  1         subscript   normal-→  F   12          subscript  μ  0    subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2      4  π      2  D    0    1   0    subscript  L  1      \vec{F}_{12}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{1}I_{2}}{4\pi}\frac{2}{D}(0,-1,0)L_{1}   . As expected, the force that the wire feels is proportional to its length. The force per unit length is:         F  →   12    L  1    =      μ  0    I  1    I  2     2  π  D     (  0  ,   -  1   ,  0  )           subscript   normal-→  F   12    subscript  L  1           subscript  μ  0    subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2      2  π  D     0    1   0      \frac{\vec{F}_{12}}{L_{1}}=\frac{\mu_{0}I_{1}I_{2}}{2\pi D}(0,-1,0)   . The direction of the force is along the y-axis, representing wire 1 getting pulled towards wire 2 if the currents are parallel, as expected. The magnitude of the force per unit length agrees with the expression for     F  m   L       subscript  F  m   L    \frac{F_{m}}{L}   shown above.
