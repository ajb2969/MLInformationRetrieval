   Fedosov manifold      Fedosov manifold  In mathematics, a '''Fedosov manifold''' is a [[symplectic manifold]] with a compatible torsion-free [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]], that is, a triple (''M'', ω, ∇), where (''M'', ω) is a [[symplectic manifold]] (i.e., ω is a [[symplectic form]], a non-degenerate closed exterior 2-form, on a ''C'' ∞ -manifold ''M''), and ∇ is a symplectic torsion-free connection on ''M''. {{cite paper |last=Gelfand |first=I. |last2=Retakh |first2=V. |last3=Shubin |first3=M. |arxiv=dg-ga/9707024 |title=Fedosov Manifolds |work=Preprint |year=1997 |accessdate=2009-10-27 }} (A connection ∇ is called '''compatible''' or '''symplectic''' if ''X' ' ⋅ ω( Y,Z ) = ω(∇ X Y , Z ) + ω( Y ,∇ X Z ) for all vector fields X,Y,Z ∈ Γ(T M ). In other words, the symplectic form is parallel with respect to the connection, i.e., its covariant derivative vanishes.) Note that every symplectic manifold admits a symplectic torsion-free connection. Cover the manifold with Darboux charts and on each chart define a connection ∇ with Christoffel symbol     Γ   j  k   i   =  0       subscript   superscript  normal-Γ  i     j  k    0    \Gamma^{i}_{jk}=0   . Then choose a partition of unity (subordinate to the cover) and glue the local connections together to a global connection which still preserves the symplectic form. The famous result of Boris Vasilievich Fedosov gives a canonical deformation quantization of a Fedosov manifold. 1  References  "  Category:Mathematical physics     ↩
