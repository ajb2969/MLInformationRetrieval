   Glycine hydroxymethyltransferase      Glycine hydroxymethyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycine hydroxymethyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + glycine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrahydrofolate + L-serine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , glycine , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are tetrahydrofolate and L-serine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the hydroxymethyl-, formyl- and related transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:glycine hydroxymethyltransferase . Other names in common use include serine aldolase , threonine aldolase , serine hydroxymethylase , serine hydroxymethyltransferase , allothreonine aldolase , L-serine hydroxymethyltransferase , L-threonine aldolase , serine hydroxymethyltransferase , and serine transhydroxymethylase . This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways : glycine, serine and threonine metabolism , lysine degradation , cyanoamino acid metabolism , one carbon pool by folate , and methane metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 18 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
