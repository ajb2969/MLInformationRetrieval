   DBZ (meteorology)      DBZ (meteorology)    dBZ stands for decibel relative to Z . It is a logarithmic  dimensionless technical unit used in radar , mostly in weather radar , to compare the equivalent reflectivity (Z) of a radar signal reflected off a remote object (in mm 6 per m 3 ) to the return of a droplet of rain with a diameter of 1 mm (1 mm 6 per m 3 ). 1 It is proportional to the number of drops per unit volume and the sixth power of drops diameter and is thus used to estimate the rain or snow intensity. 2 With other variables analyzed from the radar returns, it will help to determine the type of precipitation, too.  Principle  The radar reflectivity ( Z ) of a cloud is dependent on the number ( N ) and size ( D ) of reflectors ( hydrometeors ), which includes rain , snow , graupel , and hail . It is expressed by: 3      Z  =    ∫  0   D  m  a  x      N  0    e   -   Λ  D      D  6   d  D        Z    superscript   subscript   0     D  m  a  x       subscript  N  0    superscript  e      normal-Λ  D      superscript  D  6   d  D      Z=\int_{0}^{Dmax}N_{0}e^{-\Lambda D}D^{6}dD     As rain droplets have a diameter of the order of 1 millimetre , Z is in mm 6 m −3 ( μm 3 ), a quite unusual unit. By dividing Z with the equivalent return of a 1 mm drop in a volume of a meter cube (Z 0 ) and using the logarithm of the result (because the values vary greatly from drizzle to hail), one obtains the dimensionless quantity dBZ:       d  B  Z   ∝    10     log  10    Z   Z  0         proportional-to    d  B  Z     10    subscript   10     Z   subscript  Z  0        dBZ\propto 10\,\log_{10}\frac{Z}{Z_{0}}     dBZ values can be converted to rainfall rates in millimetres per hour using the Marshall-Palmer formula: 4       mm  hr   =    (    10   (    d  B  Z   /  10   )    200   )    5  8          mm  hr    superscript     superscript  10      d  B  Z   10    200     5  8      \frac{\mathrm{mm}}{\mathrm{hr}}=\left(\frac{10^{(dBZ/10)}}{200}\right)^{5\over

The signal returned to the radar will be equivalent in both situations, so a group of small hydrometeors is virtually indistinguishable from one large hydrometeor on the resulting radar image. The reflectivity image is just one type of image produced by a radar, using it alone a meteorologist could not tell with certainty the type of precipitation and distinguish any artifacts affecting the radar return.  In combination with other information gathered by the radar during the same scan (dual polarization products and phase shifting due to the Doppler effect ), meteorologists can distinguish between hail , rain , snow , biologicals (birds, insects), and other atmospheric phenomena.
