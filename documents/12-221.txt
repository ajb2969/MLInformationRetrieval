   Size pair      Size pair   In size theory , a size pair is a pair    (  M  ,  φ  )     M  φ    (M,\varphi)   , where   M   M   M   is a compact topological space and    φ  :   M  →   ℝ  k       normal-:  φ   normal-→  M   superscript  ℝ  k      \varphi:M\to\mathbb{R}^{k}   is a continuous function . 1 2 3 The function   φ   φ   \varphi   is called a measuring function . The topological space   M   M   M   is usually assumed to be also a locally connected and Hausdorff space .
