Size pair

In size theory, a size pair is a pair 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a compact topological space and 
 
 
 
  is a continuous function.123 The function 
 
 
 
 
  is called a measuring function. The topological space 
 
 
 
  is usually assumed to be also a locally connected and Hausdorff space.
