16S rRNA (guanine1516-N2)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (guanine1516-N2)-methyltransferase (, yhiQ (gene), rsmJ (gene), m2G1516 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine1516-N2)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine1516 in 16S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine1516 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates guanine1516 at N2 in 16S rRNA.
