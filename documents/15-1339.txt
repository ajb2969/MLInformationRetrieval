   16S rRNA (guanine1516-N2)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (guanine1516-N2)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (guanine 1516 -N 2 )-methyltransferase (, yhiQ (gene) , rsmJ (gene) , m2G1516 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine 1516 -N 2 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 1516 in 16S rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 - methylguanine 1516 in 16S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates guanine 1516 at N 2 in 16S rRNA.
