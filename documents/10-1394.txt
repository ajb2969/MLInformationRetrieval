   Hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase      Hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzene-1,2,4-triol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are benzene-1,2,4-triol (hydroxyquinol) and O 2 , whereas its product is 3-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzene-1,2,4-triol:oxygen 1,2-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . This enzyme is also called hydroxyquinol dioxygenase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation . It employs one cofactor , iron .  Structural studies  , only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
