Elliptic hypergeometric series

In mathematics, an elliptic hypergeometric series is a series Σcn such that the ratio cn/cn−1 is an elliptic function of n, analogous to generalized hypergeometric series where the ratio is a rational function of n, and basic hypergeometric series where the ratio is a periodic function of the complex number n. They were introduced by  in their study of elliptic 6-j symbols.
