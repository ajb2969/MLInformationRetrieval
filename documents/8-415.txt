   Capital recovery factor      Capital recovery factor   A capital recovery factor is the ratio of a constant annuity to the present value of receiving that annuity for a given length of time. Using an interest rate  i , the capital recovery factor is:       C  R  F   =    i    (   1  +  i   )   n       (   1  +  i   )   n   -  1          C  R  F       i   superscript    1  i   n       superscript    1  i   n   1      CRF=\frac{i(1+i)^{n}}{(1+i)^{n}-1}     where   n   n   n   is the number of annuities received. 1  This is related to the annuity formula , which gives the present value in terms of the annuity, the interest rate, and the number of annuities.  If    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , the    C  R  F      C  R  F    CRF   reduces to    1  +  i      1  i    1+i   . As    n  →  ∞     normal-→  n     n\to\infty   , the     C  R  F   →  i     normal-→    C  R  F   i    CRF\to i   .
