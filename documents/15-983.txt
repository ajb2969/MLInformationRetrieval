   Associated graded ring      Associated graded ring   In mathematics , the associated graded ring of a ring  R with respect to a proper ideal  I is the graded ring :        gr  I   R   =    ⊕   n  =  0   ∞     I  n   /   I   n  +  1            subscript  gr  I   R     superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0         superscript  I  n    superscript  I    n  1        \operatorname{gr}_{I}R=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty}I^{n}/I^{n+1}   . Similarly, if M is a left R -module, then the associated graded module is the graded module over     gr  I   R      subscript  gr  I   R    \operatorname{gr}_{I}R   :        gr  I   M   =    ⊕  0  ∞       I  n   M   /   I   n  +  1     M          subscript  gr  I   M     superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0            superscript  I  n   M    superscript  I    n  1     M      \operatorname{gr}_{I}M=\oplus_{0}^{\infty}I^{n}M/I^{n+1}M   .  Basic definitions and properties  For a ring R and ideal I , multiplication in     gr  I   R      subscript  gr  I   R    \operatorname{gr}_{I}R   is defined as follows: First, consider homogeneous elements     a  ∈    I  i   /   I   i  +  1         a     superscript  I  i    superscript  I    i  1       a\in I^{i}/I^{i+1}   and    b  ∈    I  j   /   I   j  +  1         b     superscript  I  j    superscript  I    j  1       b\in I^{j}/I^{j+1}   and suppose     a  ′   ∈   I  i        superscript  a  normal-′    superscript  I  i     a^{\prime}\in I^{i}   is a representative of a and     b  ′   ∈   I  j        superscript  b  normal-′    superscript  I  j     b^{\prime}\in I^{j}   is a representative of b . Then define    a  b      a  b    ab   to be the equivalence class of     a  ′    b  ′        superscript  a  normal-′    superscript  b  normal-′     a^{\prime}b^{\prime}   in     I   i  +  j    /   I   i  +  j  +  1         superscript  I    i  j     superscript  I    i  j  1      I^{i+j}/I^{i+j+1}   . Note that this is well-defined modulo    I   i  +  j  +  1      superscript  I    i  j  1     I^{i+j+1}   . Multiplication of inhomogeneous elements is defined by using the distributive property.  A ring or module may be related to its associated graded through the initial form map . Let M be an R -module and I an ideal of R . Given    f  ∈  M      f  M    f\in M   , the initial form of f in     gr  I   M      subscript  gr  I   M    \operatorname{gr}_{I}M   , written    in   (  f  )       in  f    \mathrm{in}(f)   , is the equivalence class of f in       I  m   M   /   I   m  +  1     M           superscript  I  m   M    superscript  I    m  1     M    I^{m}M/I^{m+1}M   where m is the maximum integer such that    f  ∈    I  m   M       f     superscript  I  m   M     f\in I^{m}M   . If    f  ∈    I  m   M       f     superscript  I  m   M     f\in I^{m}M   for every m , then set     in   (  f  )    =  0        in  f   0    \mathrm{in}(f)=0   . The initial form map is only a map of sets and generally not a homomorphism . For a submodule     N  ⊂  M      N  M    N\subset M   ,    in   (  N  )       in  N    \mathrm{in}(N)   is defined to be the submodule of     gr  I   M      subscript  gr  I   M    \operatorname{gr}_{I}M   generated by    {   in   (  f  )    |   f  ∈  N   }     conditional-set    in  f     f  N     \{\mathrm{in}(f)|f\in N\}   . This may not be the same as the submodule of     gr  I   M      subscript  gr  I   M    \operatorname{gr}_{I}M   generated by the only initial forms of the generators of N .  A ring inherits some "good" properties from its associated graded ring. For example, if R is a noetherian  local ring , and     gr  I   R      subscript  gr  I   R    \operatorname{gr}_{I}R   is an integral domain , then R is itself an integral domain. 1  Examples  Let U be the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   over a field k ; it is filtered by degree. The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem implies that    gr  U     gr  U    \operatorname{gr}U   is a polynomial ring; in fact, it is the coordinate ring     k   [   𝔤  *   ]       k   delimited-[]   superscript  𝔤       k[\mathfrak{g}^{*}]   .  The associated graded algebra of a Clifford algebra is an exterior algebra; i.e., a Clifford algebra  degenerates to an exterior algebra .  Generalization to multiplicative filtrations  The associated graded can also be defined more generally for multiplicative descending filtrations of R , Let F be a descending chain of ideals of the form      R  =   I  0   ⊃   I  1   ⊃   I  2   ⊃  ⋯        R   subscript  I  0     superset-of     subscript  I  1     superset-of     subscript  I  2     superset-of    normal-⋯     R=I_{0}\supset I_{1}\supset I_{2}\supset\cdots   such that      I  j    I  k    ⊂   I   j  +  k           subscript  I  j    subscript  I  k     subscript  I    j  k      I_{j}I_{k}\subset I_{j+k}   . The graded ring associated with this filtration is      gr  F   R   =    ⊕   n  =  0   ∞     I  n   /   I   n  +  1            subscript  gr  F   R     superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0         subscript  I  n    subscript  I    n  1        \operatorname{gr}_{F}R=\oplus_{n=0}^{\infty}I_{n}/I_{n+1}   . Multiplication and the initial form map are defined as above.  See also   Graded (mathematics)  Rees algebra   References      "  Category:Ring theory     ↩
