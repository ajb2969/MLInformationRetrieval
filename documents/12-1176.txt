Lebedev–Milin inequality

In mathematics, the Lebedev–Milin inequality is any of several inequalities for the coefficients of the exponential of a power series, found by  and . It was used in the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture, as it shows that the Milin conjecture implies the Robertson conjecture.
They state that if



for complex numbers βk and αk, and n is a positive integer, then
