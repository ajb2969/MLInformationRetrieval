   Channel-state duality      Channel-state duality   In quantum information theory , the channel-state duality refers to the correspondence between quantum channels and quantum states (described by density matrices ). Phrased differently, the duality is the isomorphism between completely positive maps (channels) from A to C n × n , where A is a C*-algebra and C n × n denotes the n × n complex entries, and positive linear functionals ( states ) on the tensor product        ℂ   n  ×  n    ⊗  A   .     tensor-product   superscript  ℂ    n  n    A    \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}\otimes A.     Details  Let H 1 and H 2 be (finite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces. The family of linear operators acting on H i will be denoted by L ( H i ). Consider two quantum systems, indexed by 1 and 2, whose states are density matrices in L ( H i ) respectively. A quantum channel , in the Schrödinger picture, is a completely positive (CP for short) linear map      Φ  :    L   (   H  1   )    →   L   (   H  2   )        normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-→    L   subscript  H  1      L   subscript  H  2       \Phi:L(H_{1})\rightarrow L(H_{2})     that takes a state of system 1 to a state of system 2. Next we describe the dual state corresponding to Φ.  Let E i j denote the matrix unit whose ij -th entry is 1 and zero elsewhere. The (operator) matrix       ρ  Φ   =    (   Φ   (   E   i  j    )    )    i  j    ∈     L   (   H  1   )    ⊗  L    (   H  2   )           subscript  ρ  normal-Φ    subscript    normal-Φ   subscript  E    i  j       i  j            tensor-product    L   subscript  H  1    L    subscript  H  2       \rho_{\Phi}=(\Phi(E_{ij}))_{ij}\in L(H_{1})\otimes L(H_{2})     is called the Choi matrix of Φ. By Choi's theorem on completely positive maps , Φ is CP if and only if ρ Φ is positive (semidefinite). One can view ρ Φ as a density matrix, and therefore the state dual to Φ.  The duality between channels and states refers to the map       Φ  →   ρ  Φ    ,     normal-→  normal-Φ   subscript  ρ  normal-Φ     \Phi\rightarrow\rho_{\Phi},     a linear bijection. This map is also called Jamiołkowski isomorphism or Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism .  "  Category:Quantum information theory
