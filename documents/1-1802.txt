Thermal diffusivity




Thermal diffusivity
 <
 hr>In heat transfer analysis, thermal diffusivity is the thermal conductivity divided by density and specific heat capacity at constant pressure.1 It measures the ability of a material to conduct thermal energy relative to its ability to store thermal energy. It has the SI unit of m²/s. Thermal diffusivity is usually denoted α but a, κ,2 K,3 and D are also used. The formula is:



where



 
  is thermal conductivity (W/(m·K))


 
  is density (kg/m³)


 
  is specific heat capacity (J/(kg·K))

Together, 
 
 
 
  can be considered the volumetric heat capacity (J/(m³·K)).
As seen in the heat equation,4


 
 ,
thermal diffusivity is the ratio of the time derivative of temperature to its curvature, quantifying the rate at which temperature concavity is "smoothed out". In a sense, thermal diffusivity is the measure of thermal inertia.5 In a substance with high thermal diffusivity, heat moves rapidly through it because the substance conducts heat quickly relative to its volumetric heat capacity or 'thermal bulk'.
Thermal diffusivity is often measured with the flash method.67 It involves heating a strip or cylindrical sample with a short energy pulse at one end and analyzing the temperature change (reduction in amplitude and phase shift of the pulse) a short distance away.89
