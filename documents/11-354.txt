   Monosaccharide-transporting ATPase      Monosaccharide-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a monosaccharide-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + monosaccharideout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + monosaccharidein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and monosaccharide , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and monosaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (monosaccharide-importing) . This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
