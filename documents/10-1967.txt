Dimethylaniline-N-oxide aldolase

In enzymology, a dimethylaniline-N-oxide aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N,N-dimethylaniline N-oxide 
 
 
 
  N-methylaniline + formaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, N,N-dimethylaniline N-oxide, and two products, N-methylaniline and formaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N,N-dimethylaniline-N-oxide formaldehyde-lyase (N-methylaniline-forming). Other names in common use include microsomal oxidase II, microsomal N-oxide dealkylase, and N,N-dimethylaniline-N-oxide formaldehyde-lyase.
