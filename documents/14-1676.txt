Stefan adhesion

Stefan adhesion is the stress (force per area) between two disks. Stefan's law governs the flow of polymer between the solid parallel plates. If a downward force 
 
 
 
  is applied to separate two disks of radius 
 
 
 
  in a viscous polymer with viscosity

 
  and height 
 
 
 
 
  that varies with time 
 
 
 
 ,








Stefan adhesion is mentioned in conjunction with bioadhesion by mucus-secreting animals.1 Because of the complexity of the biomolecules, the involvement of capillarity, van der Waals forces and lubrication, the situation can be difficult to understand.
