   Stefan adhesion      Stefan adhesion   Stefan adhesion is the stress (force per area) between two disks. Stefan's law governs the flow of polymer between the solid parallel plates. If a downward force   F   F   F   is applied to separate two disks of radius   R   R   R   in a viscous polymer with viscosity    η   η   \eta   and height   h   h   h   that varies with time   t   t   t   ,         F  =     3  π   R  4     2  h    (  t  )   3       d  h    d  t     η     .

Stefan adhesion is mentioned in conjunction with bioadhesion by mucus -secreting animals. 1 Because of the complexity of the biomolecules , the involvement of capillarity , van der Waals forces and lubrication , the situation can be difficult to understand.
