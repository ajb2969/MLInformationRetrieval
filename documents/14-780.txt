   Transvectant      Transvectant   In mathematical invariant theory, a transvectant is an invariant formed from n invariants in n variables using Cayley's Ω process .  Definition  If Q 1 ,..., Q n are functions of n variables x = ( x 1 ,..., x n ) and r ≥ 0 is an integer then the r th transvectant of these functions is a function of n variables given by      t  r   Ω  r    (    Q  1   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   Q  n    )       t  r   superscript  normal-Ω  r    tensor-product   subscript  Q  1   normal-⋯   subscript  Q  n      tr\Omega^{r}(Q_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes Q_{n})   where Ω is Cayley's Ω process , the tensor product means take a product of functions with different variables x 1 ,..., x n , and tr means set all the vectors x k equal.  Partial transvectants  Examples  The zeroth transvectant is the product of the n functions.  The first transvectant is the Jacobian determinant of the n functions.  The second transvectant is a constant times the completely polarized form of the Hessian of the n functions.  References      "  Category:Invariant theory
