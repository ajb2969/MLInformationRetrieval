Polar space

In mathematics, in the field of geometry, a polar space of rank n (), or projective index , consists of a set P, conventionally the set of points, together with certain subsets of P, called subspaces, that satisfy these axioms:

Every subspace, together with its own subspaces, is isomorphic with a projective geometry  with  and q a prime power. By definition, for each subspace the corresponding d is its dimension.
The intersection of two subspaces is always a subspace.
For each point p not in a subspace A of dimension of , there is a unique subspace B of dimension  such that  is -dimensional. The points in  are exactly the points of A that are in a common subspace of dimension 1 with p.
There are at least two disjoint subspaces of dimension .

A polar space of rank two is a generalized quadrangle. Finite polar spaces (where P is a finite set) are also studied as combinatorial objects.
Examples

In , with d odd and , the set of all points, with as subspaces the totally isotropic subspaces of an arbitrary symplectic polarity, forms a polar space of rank .
Let Q be a nonsingular quadric in  with character Ï‰. Then the index of Q will be . The set of all points on the quadric, together with the subspaces on the quadric, forms a polar space of rank .
Let H be a nonsingular Hermitian variety in . The index of H will be 
 
 
 
 . The points on H, together with the subspaces on it, form a polar space of rank 
 
 
 
 .

Classification
Jacques Tits proved that a finite polar space of rank at least three, is always isomorphic with one of the three structures given above. This leaves only the problem of classifying generalized quadrangles.
