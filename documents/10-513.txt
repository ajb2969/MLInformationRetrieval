   Galactose 1-dehydrogenase      Galactose 1-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a galactose 1-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-galactose + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-galactono-1,4-lactone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-galactose and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-galactono-1,4-lactone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-galactose:NAD + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-galactose dehydrogenase , beta-galactose dehydrogenase , and NAD + -dependent D-galactose dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .
