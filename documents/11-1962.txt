Exponential dispersion model

Exponential dispersion models are statistical models in which the probability distribution is of a special form.12 This class of models represents a generalisation of the exponential family of models which themselves play an important role in statistical theory because they have a special structure which enables deductions to be made about appropriate statistical inference.
Definition
Exponential dispersion models are a generalisation of the natural exponential family: these have a probability density function which, for a multivariate model, can be written as


 
  where the parameter 
 
 
 
  has the same dimension as the observation variable 
 
 
 
 . The generalisation includes an extra scalar "index parameter", 
 
 
 
 
 , and has density function of the form3


 
  The terminology "dispersion parameter" is used for 
 
 
 
 , while 
 
 
 
  is the "natural parameter" (also known as "canonical parameter").
