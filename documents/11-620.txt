   Glycosylceramidase      Glycosylceramidase   In enzymology , a glycosylceramidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycosyl-N-acylsphingosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-acylsphingosine + a sugar   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycosyl-N-acylsphingosine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N-acylsphingosine and sugar .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycosyl-N-acylsphingosine glycohydrolase . Other names in common use include phlorizin hydrolase , phloretin-glucosidase , glycosyl ceramide glycosylhydrolase , cerebrosidase , phloridzin beta-glucosidase , lactase-phlorizin hydrolase , and phloridzin glucosidase .
