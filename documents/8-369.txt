Expansive

In mathematics, the notion of expansivity formalizes the notion of points moving away from one another under the action of an iterated function. The idea of expansivity is fairly rigid, as the definition of positive expansivity, below, as well as the Schwarz-Ahlfors-Pick theorem demonstrate.
Definition
If 
 
 
 
  is a metric space, a homeomorphism

 
  is said to be expansive if there is a constant



called the expansivity constant, such that for any pair of points 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  there is an integer 
 
 
 
  such that


 
 .
Note that in this definition, 
 
 
 
  can be positive or negative, and so 
 
 
 
  may be expansive in the forward or backward directions.
The space 
 
 
 
  is often assumed to be compact, since under that assumption expansivity is a topological property; i.e. if 
 
 
 
  is any other metric generating the same topology as 
 
 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
  is expansive in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is expansive in 
 
 
 
  (possibly with a different expansivity constant).
If



is a continuous map, we say that 
 
 
 
  is positively expansive (or forward expansive) if there is a



such that, for any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , there is an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem of uniform expansivity
Given f an expansive homeomorphism, the theorem of uniform expansivity states that for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  there is an 
 
 
 
  such that for each pair 
 
 
 
  of points of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , there is an 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  such that



where 
 
 
 
  is the expansivity constant of 
 
 
 
  (proof).
Discussion
Positive expansivity is much stronger than expansivity. In fact, one can prove that if 
 
 
 
  is compact and 
 
 
 
  is a positively expansive homeomorphism, then 
 
 
 
  is finite (proof).
