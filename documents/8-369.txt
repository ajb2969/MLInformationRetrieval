   Expansive      Expansive   In mathematics , the notion of expansivity formalizes the notion of points moving away from one another under the action of an iterated function . The idea of expansivity is fairly rigid , as the definition of positive expansivity, below, as well as the Schwarz-Ahlfors-Pick theorem demonstrate.  Definition  If    (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   is a metric space , a homeomorphism     f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f\colon X\to X   is said to be expansive if there is a constant        ε  0   >  0   ,       subscript  ε  0   0    \varepsilon_{0}>0,     called the expansivity constant , such that for any pair of points    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   in   X   X   X   there is an integer   n   n   n   such that       d   (    f  n    (  x  )    ,    f  n    (  y  )    )    ≥   ε  0         d      superscript  f  n   x      superscript  f  n   y      subscript  ε  0     d(f^{n}(x),f^{n}(y))\geq\varepsilon_{0}   .  Note that in this definition,   n   n   n   can be positive or negative, and so   f   f   f   may be expansive in the forward or backward directions.  The space   X   X   X   is often assumed to be compact , since under that assumption expansivity is a topological property; i.e. if    d  ′     superscript  d  normal-′    d^{\prime}   is any other metric generating the same topology as   d   d   d   , and if   f   f   f   is expansive in    (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   , then   f   f   f   is expansive in    (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   (possibly with a different expansivity constant).  If      f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f\colon X\to X     is a continuous map, we say that   X   X   X   is positively expansive (or forward expansive ) if there is a      ε  0     subscript  ε  0    \varepsilon_{0}     such that, for any    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   in   X   X   X   , there is an    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   such that     d   (    f  n    (  x  )    ,    f  n    (  y  )    )    ≥   ε  0         d      superscript  f  n   x      superscript  f  n   y      subscript  ε  0     d(f^{n}(x),f^{n}(y))\geq\varepsilon_{0}   .  Theorem of uniform expansivity  Given f an expansive homeomorphism, the theorem of uniform expansivity states that for every    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   and    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   there is an    N  >  0      N  0    N>0   such that for each pair    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   of points of   X   X   X   such that     d   (  x  ,  y  )    >  ϵ        d   x  y    ϵ    d(x,y)>\epsilon   , there is an    n  ∈  ℤ      n  ℤ    n\in\mathbb{Z}   with     |  n  |   ≤  N        n   N    |n|\leq N   such that        d   (    f  n    (  x  )    ,    f  n    (  y  )    )    >   c  -  δ    ,        d      superscript  f  n   x      superscript  f  n   y       c  δ     d(f^{n}(x),f^{n}(y))>c-\delta,     where   c   c   c   is the expansivity constant of   f   f   f   ( proof ).  Discussion  Positive expansivity is much stronger than expansivity. In fact, one can prove that if   X   X   X   is compact and   f   f   f   is a positively expansive homeomorphism, then   X   X   X   is finite ( proof ).
