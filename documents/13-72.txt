The amount of premium written is a better measure than the total amount insured because the level of premiums is linked to the likelihood of claims.  Different countries use different methodologies to calculate the solvency ratio, and have different requirements. For example, in India insurers are required to maintain a minimum ratio of 1.5. 1  See also   Current Ratio  Solvency   References  "  Category:Actuarial science     http://www.irdaindia.org/Finance_And_Analysis/Annexure221107.xls โฉ
