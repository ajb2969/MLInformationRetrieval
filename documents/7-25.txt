   Bragg plane      Bragg plane   (Figure)  Ray diagram of Von Laue formulation   In physics , a Bragg plane is a plane in reciprocal space which bisects one reciprocal lattice vector   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   . 1 It is relevant to define this plane as part of the definition of the Von Laue condition for diffraction peaks in x-ray diffraction crystallography .  Considering the diagram at right, the arriving x-ray  plane wave is defined by:       e    i  𝐤   ⋅  𝐫    =    cos   (   𝐤  ⋅  𝐫   )    +   i   sin   (   𝐤  ⋅  𝐫   )           superscript  e   normal-⋅    i  𝐤   𝐫         normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐫      i     normal-⋅  𝐤  𝐫        e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}=\cos{(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}+i\sin{(%
 \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})}     Where   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   is the incident wave vector given by:      𝐤  =     2  π   λ    n  ^        𝐤        2  π   λ    normal-^  n      \mathbf{k}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\hat{n}     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the wavelength of the incident photon . While the Bragg formulation assumes a unique choice of direct lattice planes and specular reflection of the incident X-rays, the Von Laue formula only assumes monochromatic light and that each scattering center acts as a source of secondary wavelets as described by the Huygens principle . Each scattered wave contributes to a new plane wave given by:       𝐤  ′   =     2  π   λ     n  ^   ′         superscript  𝐤  normal-′         2  π   λ    superscript   normal-^  n   normal-′      \mathbf{k^{\prime}}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\hat{n}^{\prime}     The condition for constructive interference in the     n  ^   ′     superscript   normal-^  n   normal-′    \hat{n}^{\prime}   direction is that the path difference between the photons is an integer multiple (m) of their wavelength. We know then that for constructive interference we have:         |  𝐝  |    cos  θ    +    |  𝐝  |    cos   θ  ′      =   𝐝  ⋅   (    n  ^   -    n  ^   ′    )    =   m  λ               𝐝     θ        𝐝      superscript  θ  normal-′       normal-⋅  𝐝     normal-^  n    superscript   normal-^  n   normal-′            m  λ      |\mathbf{d}|\cos{\theta}+|\mathbf{d}|\cos{\theta^{\prime}}=\mathbf{d}\cdot(%
 \hat{n}-\hat{n}^{\prime})=m\lambda     where    m  ∈  ℤ      m  ℤ    m\in\mathbb{Z}   . Multiplying the above by     2  π   /  λ        2  π   λ    2\pi/\lambda   we formulate the condition in terms of the wave vectors   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   and    𝐤  ′     superscript  𝐤  normal-′    \mathbf{k^{\prime}}   :       𝐝  ⋅   (   𝐤  -   𝐤  ′    )    =   2  π  m        normal-⋅  𝐝    𝐤   superscript  𝐤  normal-′       2  π  m     \mathbf{d}\cdot(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k^{\prime}})=2\pi m     (Figure)  The Bragg plane in blue, with its associated reciprocal lattice vector K.   Now consider that a crystal is an array of scattering centres, each at a point in the Bravais lattice . We can set one of the scattering centres as the origin of an array. Since the lattice points are displaced by the Bravais lattice vectors   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   , scattered waves interfere constructively when the above condition holds simultaneously for all values of   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   which are Bravais lattice vectors, the condition then becomes:       𝐑  ⋅   (   𝐤  -   𝐤  ′    )    =   2  π  m        normal-⋅  𝐑    𝐤   superscript  𝐤  normal-′       2  π  m     \mathbf{R}\cdot(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k^{\prime}})=2\pi m     An equivalent statement (see mathematical description of the reciprocal lattice ) is to say that:       e    i   (   𝐤  -   𝐤  ′    )    ⋅  𝐑    =  1       superscript  e   normal-⋅    i    𝐤   superscript  𝐤  normal-′     𝐑    1    e^{i(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k^{\prime}})\cdot\mathbf{R}}=1     By comparing this equation with the definition of a reciprocal lattice vector, we see that constructive interference occurs if    𝐊  =   𝐤  -   𝐤  ′        𝐊    𝐤   superscript  𝐤  normal-′      \mathbf{K}=\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k^{\prime}}   is a vector of the reciprocal lattice. We notice that   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   and    𝐤  ′     superscript  𝐤  normal-′    \mathbf{k^{\prime}}   have the same magnitude, we can restate the Von Laue formulation as requiring that the tip of incident wave vector   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   must lie in the plane that is a perpendicular bisector of the reciprocal lattice vector   𝐊   𝐊   \mathbf{K}   . This reciprocal space plane is the Bragg plane .
