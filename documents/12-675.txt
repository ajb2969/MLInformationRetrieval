   Rational dependence      Rational dependence   In mathematics , a collection of real numbers is rationally independent if none of them can be written as a linear combination of the other numbers in the collection with rational coefficients. A collection of numbers which is not rationally independent is called rationally dependent . For instance we have the following example.        independent          3  ,   8    ⏞   ,   1  +   2     ⏟       dependent        independent     normal-⏟    normal-⏞   fragments  3  normal-,    8   normal-      1    2        dependent     \begin{matrix}\mbox{independent}\\
 \underbrace{\overbrace{3,\quad\sqrt{8}\quad},1+\sqrt{2}}\\
 \mbox{dependent}\\
 \end{matrix}     Formal definition  The real numbers ω 1 , ω 2 , ... , ω n are said to be rationally dependent if there exist integers k 1 , k 2 , ... , k n , not all of which are zero, such that         k  1    ω  1    +    k  2    ω  2    +  ⋯  +    k  n    ω  n     =  0.           subscript  k  1    subscript  ω  1       subscript  k  2    subscript  ω  2    normal-⋯     subscript  k  n    subscript  ω  n     0.    k_{1}\omega_{1}+k_{2}\omega_{2}+\cdots+k_{n}\omega_{n}=0.     If such integers do not exist, then the vectors are said to be rationally independent . This condition can be reformulated as follows: ω 1 , ω 2 , ... , ω n are rationally independent if the only n -tuple of integers k 1 , k 2 , ... , k n such that         k  1    ω  1    +    k  2    ω  2    +  ⋯  +    k  n    ω  n     =  0           subscript  k  1    subscript  ω  1       subscript  k  2    subscript  ω  2    normal-⋯     subscript  k  n    subscript  ω  n     0    k_{1}\omega_{1}+k_{2}\omega_{2}+\cdots+k_{n}\omega_{n}=0   is the trivial solution in which every k i is zero.  The real numbers form a vector space over the rational numbers , and this is equivalent to the usual definition of linear independence in this vector space.
