Maximal semilattice quotient

In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a maximal semilattice quotient is a commutative monoid derived from another commutative monoid by making certain elements equivalent to each other.
Every commutative monoid can be endowed with its algebraic preordering ≤ . By definition, x≤ y holds, if there exists z such that x+z=y. Further, for x, y in M, let 
 
 
 
  hold, if there exists a positive integer n such that x≤ ny, and let 
 
 
 
  hold, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . The binary relation

 
  is a monoid congruence of M, and the quotient monoid 
 
 
 
  is the maximal semilattice quotient of M.
This terminology can be explained by the fact that the canonical projection p from M onto 
 
 
 
  is universal among all monoid homomorphisms from M to a (∨,0)-semilattice, that is, for any (∨,0)-semilattice S and any monoid homomorphism f: M→ S, there exists a unique (∨,0)-homomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that f=gp.
If M is a refinement monoid, then 
 
 
 
 
  is a distributive semilattice.
