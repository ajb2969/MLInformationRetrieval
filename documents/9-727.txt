   Maximal semilattice quotient      Maximal semilattice quotient   In abstract algebra , a branch of mathematics , a maximal semilattice quotient is a commutative monoid derived from another commutative monoid by making certain elements equivalent to each other.  Every commutative monoid can be endowed with its algebraic  preordering ≤ . By definition, x≤ y holds, if there exists z such that x+z=y . Further, for x, y in M , let    x  ∝  y     proportional-to  x  y    x\propto y   hold, if there exists a positive integer n such that x≤ ny , and let    x  ≍  y     asymptotically-equals  x  y    x\asymp y   hold, if    x  ∝  y     proportional-to  x  y    x\propto y   and    y  ∝  x     proportional-to  y  x    y\propto x   . The binary relation    ≍   asymptotically-equals   \asymp   is a monoid congruence of M , and the quotient monoid    M  /  ≍     fragments  M   asymptotically-equals    M/{\asymp}   is the maximal semilattice quotient of M .  This terminology can be explained by the fact that the canonical projection p from M onto    M  /  ≍     fragments  M   asymptotically-equals    M/{\asymp}   is universal among all monoid homomorphisms from M to a (∨,0)- semilattice , that is, for any (∨,0)-semilattice S and any monoid homomorphism f: M→ S , there exists a unique (∨,0)-homomorphism    g  :  M  /  ≍  →  S     fragments  g  normal-:  M   asymptotically-equals  normal-→  S    g\colon M/{\asymp}\to S   such that f=gp .  If M is a refinement monoid , then    M  /  ≍     fragments  M   asymptotically-equals    M/{\asymp}   is a distributive semilattice .  References  A.H. Clifford and G.B.
