LogSumExp

The LogSumExp (LSE) function is a smooth approximation to the maximum function, mainly used by machine learning algorithms. It's defined as the logarithm of the sum of the exponentials of the arguments:



The LogSumExp function domain is 
 
 
 
 , the real coordinate space, and its range is 
 
 
 
 , the real line. The larger the values of 
 
 
 
  or their deviation, the better the approximation becomes. The LogSumExp function is convex, and is strictly monotonically increasing everywhere in its domain1 (but not strictly convex everywhere 2).
