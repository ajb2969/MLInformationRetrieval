   LogSumExp      LogSumExp   The LogSumExp (LSE) function is a smooth approximation to the maximum function, mainly used by machine learning algorithms. It's defined as the logarithm of the sum of the exponentials of the arguments:       L  S  E   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   log   (    exp   (   x  1   )    +  ⋯  +   exp   (   x  n   )     )          L  S  E    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n            subscript  x  1    normal-⋯     subscript  x  n        LSE(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})=\log\left(\exp(x_{1})+\cdots+\exp(x_{n})\right)     The LogSumExp function domain is     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   , the real coordinate space , and its range is    \R    \R   \R   , the real line . The larger the values of    x  k     subscript  x  k    x_{k}   or their deviation, the better the approximation becomes. The LogSumExp function is convex, and is strictly monotonically increasing everywhere in its domain 1 (but not strictly convex everywhere 2 ).
