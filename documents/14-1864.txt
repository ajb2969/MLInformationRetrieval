   Higman group      Higman group   In mathematics , the Higman group , introduced by , was the first example of an infinite finitely presented group with no non-trivial finite quotients. The quotient by the maximal proper normal subgroup is a finitely generated infinite simple group .  later found some finitely presented infinite groups G n , r that are simple if n is even and have a simple subgroup of index 2 if n is odd, one of which is one of the Thompson groups .  Higman's group is generated by 4 elements a , b , c , d with the relations         a   -  1    b  a   =   b  2    ,      b   -  1    c  b   =   c  2    ,      c   -  1    d  c   =   d  2    ,     d   -  1    a  d   =   a  2         formulae-sequence       superscript  a    1    b  a    superscript  b  2     formulae-sequence       superscript  b    1    c  b    superscript  c  2     formulae-sequence       superscript  c    1    d  c    superscript  d  2         superscript  d    1    a  d    superscript  a  2        a^{-1}ba=b^{2},\quad b^{-1}cb=c^{2},\quad c^{-1}dc=d^{2},\quad d^{-1}ad=a^{2}   .
