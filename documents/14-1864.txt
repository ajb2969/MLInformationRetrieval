Higman group

In mathematics, the Higman group, introduced by , was the first example of an infinite finitely presented group with no non-trivial finite quotients. The quotient by the maximal proper normal subgroup is a finitely generated infinite simple group.  later found some finitely presented infinite groups Gn,r that are simple if n is even and have a simple subgroup of index 2 if n is odd, one of which is one of the Thompson groups.
Higman's group is generated by 4 elements a, b, c, d with the relations
