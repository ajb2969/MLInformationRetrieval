History
Fi23 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and is one the three Fischer groups introduced by  while investigating 3-transposition groups.
The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial.
Representations
The Fischer group Fi23 has a rank 3 action on a graph of 31671 vertices corresponding to 3-transpositions, with point stabilizer the double cover of the Fischer group Fi22. It has a second rank-3 action on 137632 points
The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 782. The group has an irreducible representation of dimension 253 over the field with 3 elements.
Generalized Monstrous Moonshine
Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For Fi23, the relevant McKay-Thompson series is 
 
 
 
  where one can set the constant term a(0) = 42 (),



and η(τ) is the Dedekind eta function.
Maximal subgroups
found the 14 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Fi23 as follows:

2.Fi22
O8+(3):S3
22.U6(2).2
S8(2)
O7(3) × S3
211.M23
31+8.21+6.31+2.2S4
[310].(L3(3) × 2)
S12
(22 × 21+8).(3 × U4(2)).2
26+8:(A7 × S3)
S6(2) × S4
S4(4):4
L2(23)
