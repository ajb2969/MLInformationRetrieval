   Fischer group Fi23      Fischer group Fi23     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Fischer group  Fi 23 is a sporadic simple group of order   2 18 {{·}}3 13 {{·}}5 2 {{·}}7{{·}}11{{·}}13{{·}}17{{·}}23  = 4089470473293004800  ≈ 4     ×    10  1   8       absent     superscript  10  1   8     \times 10^{1}8   .   History  Fi 23 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and is one the three Fischer groups introduced by  while investigating 3-transposition groups .  The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial .  Representations  The Fischer group Fi 23 has a rank 3 action on a graph of 31671 vertices corresponding to 3-transpositions, with point stabilizer the double cover of the Fischer group Fi22 . It has a second rank-3 action on 137632 points  The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 782. The group has an irreducible representation of dimension 253 over the field with 3 elements.  Generalized Monstrous Moonshine  Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For Fi 23 , the relevant McKay-Thompson series is     T   3  A     (  τ  )        subscript  T    3  A    τ    T_{3A}(\tau)   where one can set the constant term a(0) = 42 (),       j   3  A     (  τ  )        subscript  j    3  A    τ    \displaystyle j_{3A}(\tau)     and η ( τ ) is the Dedekind eta function .  Maximal subgroups  found the 14 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Fi 23 as follows:   2.Fi 22  O 8 + (3):S 3  2 2 .U 6 (2).2  S 8 (2)  O 7 (3) × S 3  2 11 .M 23  3 1+8 .2 1+6 .3 1+2 .2S 4  [3 10 ].(L 3 (3) × 2)  S 12  (2 2 × 2 1+8 ).(3 × U 4 (2)).2  2 6+8 :(A 7 × S 3 )  S 6 (2) × S 4  S 4 (4):4  L 2 (23)   References    contains a complete proof of Fischer's theorem.   This is the first part of Fischer's preprint on the construction of his groups. The remainder of the paper is unpublished (as of 2010).     Wilson, R. A. ATLAS of Finite Group Representations.
