Cache-oblivious matrix multiplication

Rectangular matrices can be multiplied when the size of the cache and cache line is not known to the algorithm, or cache-obliviously. Cache-oblivious matrix multiplication was first formalized by Harald Prokop.1
Matrix multiplication
Two matrixes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of size 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with a cache of size 
 
 
 
  and cache lines of length 
 
 
 
  can be multiplied with 
 
 
 
  cache misses under the tall cache assumption 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not known at runtime.
Algorithm
The matrices are stored in row major order, meaning that a matrix is laid out in memory with the each row's elements contiguously, from the first row to the last row. The algorithm works by recursive divide and conquer. In each step, the largest dimension halved.
Case 1
 
 


Case 2
 
 


Case 3
 
 


In the base case 
 
 
 
 , the single element matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are multiplied and then added to the resulting matrix.
Cache complexity and work


 
  caches misses are incurred. 
 
 
 
  additions and multiplications are done.
