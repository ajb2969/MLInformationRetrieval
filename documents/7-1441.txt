Martingale difference sequence

In probability theory, a martingale difference sequence (MDS) is related to the concept of the martingale. A stochastic series X is an MDS if its expectation with respect to the past is zero. Formally, consider an adapted sequence 
 
 
 
  on a probability space

 
 . 
 
 
 
  is an MDS if it satisfies the following two conditions:


 
 , and


 
 ,
for all 
 
 
 
 . By construction, this implies that if 
 
 
 
  is a martingale, then 
 
 
 
  will be an MDSâ€”hence the name.
The MDS is an extremely useful construct in modern probability theory because it implies much milder restrictions on the memory of the sequence than independence, yet most limit theorems that hold for an independent sequence will also hold for an MDS.
