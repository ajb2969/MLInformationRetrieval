   Generalised logistic function      Generalised logistic function   The generalised logistic function or curve , also known as Richards' curve , originally developed for growth modelling, is an extension of the logistic or sigmoid functions, allowing for more flexible S-shaped curves:       Y   (  t  )    =   A  +    K  -  A     (   C  +   Q   e   -   B  t       )    1  /  ν            Y  t     A      K  A    superscript    C    Q   superscript  e      B  t         1  ν        Y(t)=A+{K-A\over(C+Qe^{-Bt})^{1/\nu}}     where   Y   Y   Y   = weight, height, size etc., and   t   t   t   = time.  It has five parameters:      A   A   A   : the lower asymptote;     K   K   K   : the upper asymptote. If    A  =  0      A  0    A=0   then   K   K   K   is called the carrying capacity;     B   B   B   : the growth rate;      ν  >  0      ν  0    \nu>0   : affects near which asymptote maximum growth occurs.     Q   Q   Q   : is related to the value    Y   (  0  )       Y  0    Y(0)        C   C   C   : typically takes a value of 1.   The equation can also be written:       Y   (  t  )    =   A  +    K  -  A     (   C  +   e   -   B   (   t  -  M   )       )    1  /  ν            Y  t     A      K  A    superscript    C   superscript  e      B    t  M         1  ν        Y(t)=A+{K-A\over(C+e^{-B(t-M)})^{1/\nu}}     where   M   M   M   can be thought of a starting time,    t  0     subscript  t  0    t_{0}   (at which     Y   (   t  0   )    =   A  +    K  -  A     (   C  +  1   )    1  /  ν            Y   subscript  t  0      A      K  A    superscript    C  1     1  ν        Y(t_{0})=A+{K-A\over(C+1)^{1/\nu}}   )  Including both   Q   Q   Q   and   M   M   M   can be convenient:       Y   (  t  )    =   A  +    K  -  A     (   C  +   Q   e   -   B   (   t  -  M   )        )    1  /  ν            Y  t     A      K  A    superscript    C    Q   superscript  e      B    t  M          1  ν        Y(t)=A+{K-A\over(C+Qe^{-B(t-M)})^{1/\nu}}     this representation simplifies the setting of both a starting time and the value of Y at that time.  The logistic , with maximum growth rate at time   M   M   M   , is the case where    Q  =  ν      Q  ν    Q=\nu   = 1.  Generalised logistic differential equation  A particular case of the generalised logistic function is:       Y   (  t  )    =   K    (   1  +   Q   e   -   α  ν   (   t  -   t  0    )        )    1  /  ν           Y  t     K   superscript    1    Q   superscript  e      α  ν    t   subscript  t  0           1  ν       Y(t)={K\over(1+Qe^{-\alpha\nu(t-t_{0})})^{1/\nu}}     which is the solution of the so-called Richard's differential equation (RDE):        Y  ′    (  t  )    =   α   (   1  -    (   Y  K   )   ν    )   Y          superscript  Y  normal-′   t     α    1   superscript    Y  K   ν    Y     Y^{\prime}(t)=\alpha\left(1-\left(\frac{Y}{K}\right)^{\nu}\right)Y     with initial condition       Y   (   t  0   )    =   Y  0         Y   subscript  t  0     subscript  Y  0     Y(t_{0})=Y_{0}     where      Q  =    -  1   +    (   K   Y  0    )   ν        Q      1    superscript    K   subscript  Y  0    ν      Q=-1+\left(\frac{K}{Y_{0}}\right)^{\nu}     provided that ν > 0 and α > 0.  The classical logistic differential equation is a particular case of the above equation, with ν =1, whereas the Gompertz curve can be recovered in the limit    ν  →   0  +      normal-→  ν   superscript  0      \nu\rightarrow 0^{+}   provided that:      α  =   O   (   1  ν   )        α    O    1  ν      \alpha=O\left(\frac{1}{\nu}\right)     In fact, for small ν it is        Y  ′    (  t  )    =   Y  r    1  -   exp   (   ν   ln   (   Y  K   )     )     ν    ≈   r  Y   ln   (   Y  K   )              superscript  Y  normal-′   t     Y  r      1      ν      Y  K       ν           r  Y      Y  K        Y^{\prime}(t)=Yr\frac{1-\exp\left(\nu\ln\left(\frac{Y}{K}\right)\right)}{\nu}%

Concerning its applications in oncology, its main biological features are similar to those of Logistic curve model.
