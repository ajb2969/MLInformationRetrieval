Muckenhoupt weights

In mathematics, the class of Muckenhoupt weights  consists of those weights $ω$ for which the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator is bounded on . Specifically, we consider functions $f$ on  and their associated maximal functions $M ( f )$ defined as
$$M(f)(x) = \sup_{r>0} \frac{1}{r^n} \int_{B_r(x)} |f|,$$
where  is the ball in  with radius $r$ and centre $x$. Let $1 ≤ p , we wish to characterise the functions  for which we have a bound
$$\int |M(f)(x)|^p \, \omega(x) dx \leq C \int |f|^p \, \omega(x)\, dx,$$
where $C$ depends only on $p$ and $ω$. This was first done by Benjamin Muckenhoupt.1
Definition
For a fixed $1 , we say that a weight  belongs to  if $ω$ is locally integrable and there is a constant $C$ such that, for all balls $B$ in , we have
$$\left(\frac{1}{|B|} \int_B \omega(x) \, dx \right)\left(\frac{1}{|B|} \int_B \omega(x)^{-\frac{q}{p}} \, dx \right)^\frac{p}{q} \leq C < \infty,$$
where $| B |$ is the Lebesgue measure of $B$, and $q$ is a real number such that: $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1$.
We say  belongs to  if there exists some $C$ such that
$$\frac{1}{|B|} \int_B \omega(x) \, dx \leq C\omega(x),$$
for all $x ∈ B$ and all balls $B$.2
Equivalent characterizations
This following result is a fundamental result in the study of Muckenhoupt weights.

Theorem. A weight $ω$ is in  if and only if any one of the following hold.3




(a) The Hardy–Littlewood maximal function is bounded on , that is
 





$\int |M(f)(x)|^p \, \omega(x)\, dx \leq C \int |f|^p \, \omega(x)\, dx,$






for some $C$ which only depends on $p$ and the constant $A$ in the above definition.
 





(b) There is a constant $c$ such that for any locally integrable function $f$ on , and all balls $B$:
 





$(f_B)^p \leq \frac{c}{\omega(B)} \int_B f(x)^p \, \omega(x)\,dx,$






where:
 





$f_B = \frac{1}{|B|}\int_B f, \qquad \omega(B) = \int_B \omega(x)\,dx.$




Equivalently:

Theorem. Let $1 , then  eφ ∈ Ap}} if and only if both of the following hold:
 



$\sup_{B}\frac{1}{|B|}\int_{B}e^{\varphi-\varphi_B}dx<\infty$

$\sup_{B}\frac{1}{|B|}\int_{B}e^{-\frac{\varphi-\varphi_B}{p-1}}dx<\infty.$




This equivalence can be verified by using Jensen's Inequality.
Reverse Hölder inequalities and 
The main tool in the proof of the above equivalence is the following result.4 The following statements are equivalent

 for some $1 ≤ p .
There exist $0  such that for all balls $B$ and subsets $E ⊂ B$, $| E | ≤ γ | B |$ implies $ω ( E ) ≤ δ ω ( B )$.
There exist $1  and $c$ (both depending on $ω$) such that for all balls $B$ we have:



$\frac{1}{|B|} \int_{B} \omega^q \leq \left(\frac{c}{|B|} \int_{B} \omega \right)^q.$




We call the inequality in the third formulation a reverse Hölder inequality as the reverse inequality follows for any non-negative function directly from Hölder's inequality. If any of the three equivalent conditions above hold we say $ω$ belongs to .
Weights and BMO
The definition of an  weight and the reverse Hölder inequality indicate that such a weight cannot degenerate or grow too quickly. This property can be phrased equivalently in terms of how much the logarithm of the weight oscillates:

(a) If  then $log( w ) ∈ BMO$ (i.e. $log( w )$ has bounded mean oscillation).
 


(b) If $f ∈ BMO$, then for sufficiently small $δ > 0$, we have  for some $p ≥ 1$.
 

This equivalence can be established by using the exponential characterization of weights above, Jensen's inequality, and the John–Nirenberg inequality.
Note that the smallness assumption on $δ > 0$ in part (b) is necessary for the result to be true, as $−log | x | ∈ BMO$, but:
$$e^{-\log|x|}=\frac{1}{e^{\log|x|}} = \frac{1}{|x|}$$
is not in any .
Further properties
Here we list a few miscellaneous properties about weights, some of which can be verified from using the definitions, others are nontrivial results:
$$A_1 \subseteq A_p \subseteq A_\infty, \qquad 1\leq p\leq\infty.$$
$$A_\infty = \bigcup_{p<\infty}A_p.$$

If , then $w dx$ defines a doubling measure: for any ball $B$, if $2 B$ is the ball of twice the radius, then $w (2 B ) ≤ Cw ( B )$ where $C > 1$ is a constant depending on $w$.
 


If , then there is $δ > 1$ such that .
 


If , then there is $δ > 0$ and weights $w_1,w_2\in A_1$ such that $w=w_1 w_2^{-\delta}$.5


Boundedness of singular integrals
It is not only the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator that is bounded on these weighted  spaces. In fact, any Calderón-Zygmund singular integral operator is also bounded on these spaces.6 Let us describe a simpler version of this here.7 Suppose we have an operator $T$ which is bounded on , so we have
$$\forall f \in C^{\infty}_c : \qquad \|T(f)\|_{L^2} \leq C\|f\|_{L^2}.$$
Suppose also that we can realise $T$ as convolution against a kernel $K$ in the following sense: if $f , g$ are smooth with disjoint support, then:
$$\int g(x) T(f)(x) \, dx = \iint g(x) K(x-y) f(y) \, dy\,dx.$$
Finally we assume a size and smoothness condition on the kernel $K$:
$$\forall x \neq 0, \forall |\alpha| \leq 1 : \qquad \left |\partial^{\alpha} K \right | \leq C |x|^{-n-\alpha}.$$
Then, for each $1  and , $T$ is a bounded operator on . That is, we have the estimate
$$\int |T(f)(x)|^p \, \omega(x)\,dx \leq C \int |f(x)|^p \, \omega(x)\, dx,$$
for all $f$ for which the right-hand side is finite.
A converse result
If, in addition to the three conditions above, we assume the non-degeneracy condition on the kernel $K$: For a fixed unit vector 
$$|K(x)| \geq a |x|^{-n}$$
whenever $x = t \dot u_0$ with $−∞ , then we have a converse. If we know
$$\int |T(f)(x)|^p \, \omega(x)\,dx \leq C \int |f(x)|^p \, \omega(x)\, dx,$$
for some fixed $1  and some $ω$, then .8
Weights and quasiconformal mappings
For $K > 1$, a $K$-quasiconformal mapping is a homeomorphism  such that
$$f\in W^{1,2}_{loc}(\mathbf{R}^n), \quad \text{ and } \quad \frac{\|Df(x)\|^n}{J(f,x)}\leq K,$$
where $Df ( x )$ is the derivative of $f$ at $x$ and $J ( f , x ) = det( Df ( x ))$ is the Jacobian.
A theorem of Gehring9 states that for all $K$-quasiconformal functions , we have , where $p$ depends on $K$.
Harmonic measure
If you have a simply connected domain $Ω ⊆ \mathbf{ C } $, we say its boundary curve $Γ = ∂Ω$ is $K$-chord-arc if for any two points $z , w$ in $Γ$ there is a curve $γ ⊆ Γ$ connecting $z$ and $w$ whose length is no more than $K | z − w |$. For a domain with such a boundary and for any  in $Ω$, the harmonic measure  w(z0, Ω, ⋅)}} is absolutely continuous with respect to one-dimensional Hausdorff measure and its Radon–Nikodym derivative is in .10 (Note that in this case, one needs to adapt the definition of weights to the case where the underlying measure is one-dimensional Hausdorff measure).
