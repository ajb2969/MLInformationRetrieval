   Dimethylglycine oxidase      Dimethylglycine oxidase   In enzymology , a dimethylglycine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N,N-dimethylglycine + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sarcosine + formaldehyde + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N,N-dimethylglycine , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are sarcosine , formaldehyde , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N,N-dimethylglycine:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating) . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
