Dolichyl-xylosyl-phosphate—protein xylosyltransferase




Dolichyl-xylosyl-phosphate—protein xylosyltransferase

In enzymology, a dolichyl-xylosyl-phosphate-protein xylosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dolichyl D-xylosyl phosphate + protein 
 
 
 
  dolichyl phosphate + D-xylosylprotein
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl D-xylosyl phosphate and protein, whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and D-xylosylprotein.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-D-xylosyl-phosphate:protein D-xylosyltransferase.
