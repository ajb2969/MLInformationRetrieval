   Pseudoisotopy theorem      Pseudoisotopy theorem   In mathematics , the pseudoisotopy theorem is a theorem of Jean Cerf's 1 which refers to the connectivity of a group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold.  Statement  Given a differentiable manifold  M (with or without boundary), a pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphism of M is a diffeomorphism of M × [0, 1] which restricts to the identity on     M  ×   {  0  }    ∪    ∂  M   ×   [  0  ,  1  ]          M   0        M    0  1      M\times\{0\}\cup\partial M\times[0,1]   .  Given    f  :    M  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →   M  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]        normal-:  f   normal-→    M   0  1      M   0  1       f:M\times[0,1]\to M\times[0,1]   a pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphism, its restriction to    M  ×   {  1  }       M   1     M\times\{1\}   is a diffeomorphism   g   g   g   of M . We say g is pseudo-isotopic to the identity . One should think of a pseudo-isotopy as something that is almost an isotopy —the obstruction to ƒ being an isotopy of g to the identity is whether or not ƒ preserves the level-sets    M  ×   {  t  }       M   t     M\times\{t\}   for    t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       t   0  1     t\in[0,1]   .  Cerf's theorem states that, provided M is simply-connected and dim( M ) ≥ 5, the group of pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphisms of M is connected. Equivalently, a diffeomorphism of M is isotopic to the identity if and only if it is pseudo-isotopic to the identity. 2  Relation to Cerf theory  The starting point of the proof is to think of the height function as a 1-parameter family of smooth functions on M by considering the function     π   [  0  ,  1  ]    ∘   f  t        subscript  π   0  1     subscript  f  t     \pi_{[0,1]}\circ f_{t}   . One then applies Cerf theory . 3  References    "  Category:Theorems in differential topology  Category:Singularity theory     French mathematician, born 1928 ↩   J.Cerf, La stratification naturelle des espaces de fonctions différentiables réelles et le théorème de la pseudo-isotopie, Inst.
