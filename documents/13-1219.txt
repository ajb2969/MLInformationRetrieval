Pseudoisotopy theorem

In mathematics, the pseudoisotopy theorem is a theorem of Jean Cerf's1 which refers to the connectivity of a group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold.
Statement
Given a differentiable manifold M (with or without boundary), a pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphism of M is a diffeomorphism of M × [0, 1] which restricts to the identity on 
 
 
 
 .
Given 
 
 
 
  a pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphism, its restriction to 
 
 
 
  is a diffeomorphism 
 
 
 
  of M. We say g is pseudo-isotopic to the identity. One should think of a pseudo-isotopy as something that is almost an isotopy—the obstruction to ƒ being an isotopy of g to the identity is whether or not ƒ preserves the level-sets 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Cerf's theorem states that, provided M is simply-connected and dim(M) ≥ 5, the group of pseudo-isotopy diffeomorphisms of M is connected. Equivalently, a diffeomorphism of M is isotopic to the identity if and only if it is pseudo-isotopic to the identity. 2
Relation to Cerf theory
The starting point of the proof is to think of the height function as a 1-parameter family of smooth functions on M by considering the function 
 
 
 
 . One then applies Cerf theory.3
