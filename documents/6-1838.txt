   Hermitian function      Hermitian function   In mathematical analysis , a Hermitian function is a complex  function with the property that its complex conjugate is equal to the original function with the variable changed in sign :       f   (   -  x   )    =    f   (  x  )    ¯         f    x     normal-¯    f  x      f(-x)=\overline{f(x)}     (where the overbar indicates the complex conjugate) for all   x   x   x   in the domain of   f   f   f   .  This definition extends also to functions of two or more variables, e.g., in the case that   f   f   f   is a function of two variables it is Hermitian if       f   (   -   x  1    ,   -   x  2    )    =    f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    ¯         f      subscript  x  1       subscript  x  2       normal-¯    f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2        f(-x_{1},-x_{2})=\overline{f(x_{1},x_{2})}     for all pairs    (   x  1   ,   x  2   )      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     (x_{1},x_{2})   in the domain of   f   f   f   .  From this definition it follows immediately that   f   f   f   is a Hermitian function if and only if   the real part of   f   f   f   is an even function , and  the imaginary part of   f   f   f   is an odd function .   Motivation  Hermitian functions appear frequently in mathematics, physics, and signal processing. For example, the following two statements follow from basic properties of the Fourier transform:   The function   f   f   f   is real-valued if and only if the Fourier transform of   f   f   f   is Hermitian.    The function   f   f   f   is Hermitian if and only if the Fourier transform of   f   f   f   is real-valued.   Since the Fourier transform of a real signal is guaranteed to be Hermitian, it can be compressed using the Hermitian even/odd symmetry. This, for example, allows the discrete Fourier transform of a signal (which is in general complex) to be stored in the same space as the original real signal.   If f is Hermitian, then     f  ⋆  g   =   f  *  g        normal-⋆  f  g     f  g     f\star g=f*g   .   Where the   ⋆   normal-⋆   \star   is cross-correlation , and   *     *   is convolution .   If both f and g are Hermitian, then     f  ⋆  g   =   g  ⋆  f        normal-⋆  f  g    normal-⋆  g  f     f\star g=g\star f   .
