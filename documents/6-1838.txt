Hermitian function

In mathematical analysis, a Hermitian function is a complex function with the property that its complex conjugate is equal to the original function with the variable changed in sign:



(where the overbar indicates the complex conjugate) for all 
 
 
 
  in the domain of 
 
 
 
 .
This definition extends also to functions of two or more variables, e.g., in the case that 
 
 
 
  is a function of two variables it is Hermitian if



for all pairs 
 
 
 
  in the domain of 
 
 
 
 .
From this definition it follows immediately that
 
 
 
  is a Hermitian function if and only if

the real part of 
 
 
 
  is an even function, and
the imaginary part of 
 
 
 
  is an odd function.

Motivation
Hermitian functions appear frequently in mathematics, physics, and signal processing. For example, the following two statements follow from basic properties of the Fourier transform:

The function 
 
 
 
  is real-valued if and only if the Fourier transform of 
 
 
 
  is Hermitian.


The function 
 
 
 
  is Hermitian if and only if the Fourier transform of 
 
 
 
  is real-valued.

Since the Fourier transform of a real signal is guaranteed to be Hermitian, it can be compressed using the Hermitian even/odd symmetry. This, for example, allows the discrete Fourier transform of a signal (which is in general complex) to be stored in the same space as the original real signal.

If f is Hermitian, then

If both f and g are Hermitian, then
