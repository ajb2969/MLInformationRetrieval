Schur's lemma (from Riemannian geometry)

Schur's lemma is a result in Riemannian geometry that says, heuristically, whenever certain curvatures are pointwise constant then they are forced to be globally constant. It is essentially a degree of freedom counting argument.
Statement of the Lemma
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a Riemannian manifold and 
 
 
 
 . Then if

the sectional curvature is pointwise constant, that is, there exists some function 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  for all two-dimensional subspaces 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 


then 
 
 
 
  is constant, and the manifold has constant sectional curvature (also known as a space form when 
 
 
 
  is complete); alternatively
 


the Ricci curvature endomorphism is pointwise a multiple of the identity, that is, there exists some function 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 


then 
 
 
 
  is constant, and the manifold is Einstein.
 

The requirement that 
 
 
 
  cannot be lifted. This result is far from true on two-dimensional surfaces. In two dimensions sectional curvature is always pointwise constant since there is only one two-dimensional subspace 
 
 
 
 , namely 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, in two dimensions the Ricci curvature endomorphism is always a multiple of the identity (scaled by Gauss curvature). On the other hand, certainly not all two-dimensional surfaces have constant sectional (or Ricci) curvature.
