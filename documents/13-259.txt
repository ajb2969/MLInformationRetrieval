   Schur's lemma (from Riemannian geometry)      Schur's lemma (from Riemannian geometry)   Schur's lemma is a result in Riemannian geometry that says, heuristically, whenever certain curvatures are pointwise constant then they are forced to be globally constant. It is essentially a degree of freedom counting argument.  Statement of the Lemma  Suppose    (   M  n   ,  g  )      superscript  M  n   g    (M^{n},g)   is a Riemannian manifold and    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   . Then if   the sectional curvature is pointwise constant, that is, there exists some function    f  :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  ℝ     f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   such that        sect   (   Π  p   )    =   f   (  p  )          sect   subscript  normal-Π  p      f  p     \mathrm{sect}(\Pi_{p})=f(p)   for all two-dimensional subspaces     Π  p   ⊂    T  p   M        subscript  normal-Π  p      subscript  T  p   M     \Pi_{p}\subset T_{p}M   and all     p  ∈  M   ,      p  M    p\in M,      then   f   f   f   is constant, and the manifold has constant sectional curvature (also known as a space form when   M   M   M   is complete); alternatively    the Ricci curvature  endomorphism is pointwise a multiple of the identity, that is, there exists some function    f  :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  ℝ     f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   such that        Ric   (   X  p   )    =   f   (  p  )    X  p          Ric   subscript  X  p      f  p   subscript  X  p      \mathrm{Ric}(X_{p})=f(p)X_{p}   for all     X  p   ∈    T  p   M        subscript  X  p      subscript  T  p   M     X_{p}\in T_{p}M   and all     p  ∈  M   ,      p  M    p\in M,      then   f   f   f   is constant, and the manifold is Einstein .   The requirement that    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   cannot be lifted. This result is far from true on two-dimensional surfaces. In two dimensions sectional curvature is always pointwise constant since there is only one two-dimensional subspace     Π  p   ⊂    T  p   M        subscript  normal-Π  p      subscript  T  p   M     \Pi_{p}\subset T_{p}M   , namely     T  p   M       subscript  T  p   M    T_{p}M   . Furthermore, in two dimensions the Ricci curvature endomorphism is always a multiple of the identity (scaled by Gauss curvature ). On the other hand, certainly not all two-dimensional surfaces have constant sectional (or Ricci) curvature.  Reference   S. Kobayashi, K. Nomizu.
