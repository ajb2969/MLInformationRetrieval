   Cyclotomic character      Cyclotomic character   In number theory , a cyclotomic character is a character of a Galois group giving the Galois action on a group of roots of unity . As a one-dimensional representation over a ring  R , its representation space is generally denoted by R (1) (that is, it is a representation ).  p -adic cyclotomic character  If p is a prime , and G is the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers , the p -adic cyclotomic character is a group homomorphism       œá  p   :   G  ‚Üí   ùêô  p  √ó       normal-:   subscript  œá  p    normal-‚Üí  G   superscript   subscript  ùêô  p        \chi_{p}:G\rightarrow\mathbf{Z}_{p}^{\times}     where Z p √ó is the group of units of the ring of p-adic integers . This homomorphism is defined as follows. Let Œ∂ n be a primitive  p n root of unity. Every p n root of unity is a power of Œ∂ n uniquely defined as an element of the ring of integers modulo p n . Primitive roots of unity correspond to the invertible elements , i.e. to ( Z / p n ) √ó . An element g of the Galois group G sends Œ∂ n to another primitive p n root of unity      Œ∏  =   Œ∂  n   a   g  ,  n         Œ∏   superscript   subscript  Œ∂  n    subscript  a   g  n       \theta=\zeta_{n}^{a_{g,n}}     where a g , n ‚àà ( Z / p n ) √ó . For a given g , as n varies, the a g , n form a comptatible system in the sense that they give an element of the inverse limit of the ( Z / p n ) √ó , which is Z p √ó . Therefore, the p -adic cyclotomic character sends g to the system ( a g , n ) n , thus encoding the action of g on all p -power roots of unity.  In fact,    œá  p     subscript  œá  p    \chi_{p}   is a continuous homomorphism (where the topology on G is the Krull topology , and that on Z p √ó is the p-adic topology).  As a compatible system of ‚Ñì-adic representations  By varying ‚Ñì over all prime numbers, a compatible system of ‚Ñì-adic representations is obtained from the ‚Ñì-adic cyclotomic characters (when considering compatible systems of representations, the standard terminology is to use the symbol ‚Ñì to denote a prime instead of p ). That is to say, œá = { œá ‚Ñì } ‚Ñì is a "family" of ‚Ñì-adic representations       œá  ‚Ñì   :    G  ùêê   ‚Üí    GL  1    (   ùêô  ‚Ñì   )        normal-:   subscript  œá  normal-‚Ñì    normal-‚Üí   subscript  G  ùêê     subscript  GL  1    subscript  ùêô  normal-‚Ñì       \chi_{\ell}:G_{\mathbf{Q}}\rightarrow\operatorname{GL}_{1}(\mathbf{Z}_{\ell})     satisfying certain compatibilities between different primes. In fact, the œá ‚Ñì form a strictly compatible system of ‚Ñì-adic representations .  Geometric realizations  The p -adic cyclotomic character is the p -adic Tate module of the multiplicative group scheme  G m , Q over Q . As such, its representation space can be viewed as the inverse limit of the groups of p n th roots of unity in .  In terms of cohomology , the p -adic cyclotomic character is the dual of the first p -adic √©tale cohomology group of G m . It can also be found in the √©tale cohomology of a projective variety , namely the projective line : it is the dual of H 2 √©t ( P 1 ).  In terms of motives , the p -adic cyclotomic character is the p -adic realization of the Tate motive  Z (1). As a Grothendieck motive , the Tate motive is the dual of H 2 ( P 1 ). 1  Properties  The p -adic cyclotomic character satisfies several nice properties.   It is unramified at all primes ‚Ñì ‚â† p (i.e. the inertia subgroup at ‚Ñì acts trivially).  If Frob ‚Ñì is a Frobenius element for ‚Ñì ‚â† p , then œá p (Frob ‚Ñì ) =¬†‚Ñì  It is crystalline at p .
