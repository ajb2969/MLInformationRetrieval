Freiheitssatz

In mathematics, the Freiheitssatz (German: "freedom/independence theorem": Freiheit + Satz) is a result in the presentation theory of groups. The result was proposed by the German mathematician Max Dehn and proved by his student, Wilhelm Magnus, in his doctoral thesis.
Statement of the theorem
Consider a group presentation



given by n generators xi and a single cyclically reduced relator r. If x1 appears in r, then the subgroup of G generated by x2, ..., xn is a free group, freely generated by x2, ..., xn. In other words, the only relations involving x2, ..., xn are the trivial ones.
