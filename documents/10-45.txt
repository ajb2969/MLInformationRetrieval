   Freiheitssatz      Freiheitssatz   In mathematics , the Freiheitssatz ( German : "freedom/independence theorem": Freiheit + Satz ) is a result in the presentation theory of groups . The result was proposed by the German  mathematician  Max Dehn and proved by his student, Wilhelm Magnus , in his doctoral thesis.  Statement of the theorem  Consider a group presentation      G  =   ⟨    x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n    |   r  =  1   ⟩       G   inner-product    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      r  1      G=\langle x_{1},\dots,x_{n}|r=1\rangle     given by n generators x i and a single cyclically reduced relator r . If x 1 appears in r , then the subgroup of G generated by x 2 , ..., x n is a free group , freely generated by x 2 , ..., x n . In other words, the only relations involving x 2 , ..., x n are the trivial ones.  References     External links     "  Category:Combinatorial group theory
