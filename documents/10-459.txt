   Estradiol 17alpha-dehydrogenase      Estradiol 17alpha-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an estradiol 17alpha-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   estradiol-17alpha + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   estrone + NAD(P)H + H +    The three substrates of this enzyme are estradiol-17alpha , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its four products are estrone , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 17alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P) + 17-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 17alpha-estradiol dehydrogenase , 17alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , 17alpha-hydroxy steroid oxidoreductase , 17alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase , and estradiol 17alpha-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism.
