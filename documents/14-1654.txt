Mean airway pressure




Mean airway pressure

Mean airway pressure typically refers to the mean pressure applied during positive-pressure mechanical ventilation. Mean airway pressure correlates with alveolar ventilation, arterial oxygenation,1 hemodynamic performance, and barotrauma.2
Equations
Determining the real mean airway pressure is a difficult task and there are several equations aimed at determining the real mean airway pressure. Various equations are suggested to be used to determine the actual mean airway pressure;
