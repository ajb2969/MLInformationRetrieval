   Differential stress      Differential stress   Differential stress is the difference between the greatest and the least compressive stress experienced by an object. For both the geological and civil engineering convention    σ  1     subscript  σ  1    \sigma_{1}   is the greatest compressive stress and    σ  3     subscript  σ  3    \sigma_{3}   is the weakest,        σ   D   =    σ  1   -   σ  3         subscript  σ  D      subscript  σ  1    subscript  σ  3      \!\sigma_{D}=\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3}   .  In other engineering fields and in physics ,    σ  3     subscript  σ  3    \sigma_{3}   is the greatest compressive stress and    σ  1     subscript  σ  1    \sigma_{1}   is the weakest, so        σ   D   =    σ  3   -   σ  1         subscript  σ  D      subscript  σ  3    subscript  σ  1      \!\sigma_{D}=\sigma_{3}-\sigma_{1}   .  These conventions originated because geologists and civil engineers (especially soil mechanicians ) are often concerned with failure in compression, while many other engineers are concerned with failure in tension . A further reason for the second convention is that it allows a positive stress to cause a compressible object to increase in size, making the sign convention self-consistent.  In structural geology , differential stress is used to assess whether tensile or shear failure will occur when a Mohr circle (plotted using    σ  1     subscript  σ  1    \sigma_{1}   and    σ  3     subscript  σ  3    \sigma_{3}   ) touches the failure envelope of the rocks. If the differential stress is less than four times the tensile strength of the rock , then extensional failure will occur. If the differential stress is more than four times the tensile strength of the rock, then shear failure will occur. 1  References    "  Category:Tectonics     Cosgrove. J. W.
