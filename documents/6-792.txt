   Banach manifold      Banach manifold   In mathematics , a Banach manifold is a manifold modeled on Banach spaces . Thus it is a topological space in which each point has a neighbourhood  homeomorphic to an open set in a Banach space (a more involved and formal definition is given below). Banach manifolds are one possibility of extending manifolds to infinite  dimensions .  A further generalisation is to Fréchet manifolds , replacing Banach spaces by Fréchet spaces . On the other hand, a Hilbert manifold is a special case of a Banach manifold in which the manifold is locally modelled on Hilbert spaces .  Definition  Let X be a set . An atlas of class  C r , r ≥ 0, on X is a collection of pairs (called charts ) ( U i , φ i ), i ∈ I , such that   each U i is a subset of X and the union of the U i is the whole of X ;  each φ i is a bijection from U i onto an open subset  φ i ( U i ) of some Banach space E i , and for any i and j , φ i ( U i ∩ U j ) is open in E i ;  the crossover map           φ  j   ∘   φ  i   -  1     :     φ  i    (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )    →    φ  j    (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )        normal-:     subscript  φ  j    superscript   subscript  φ  i     1      normal-→     subscript  φ  i      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j        subscript  φ  j      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j        \varphi_{j}\circ\varphi_{i}^{-1}:\varphi_{i}(U_{i}\cap U_{j})\to\varphi_{j}(U_%
 {i}\cap U_{j})         is an r -times continuously differentiable function for every i and j in I , i.e. the r th Fréchet derivative            d  r    (    φ  j   ∘   φ  i   -  1     )    :     φ  i    (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )    →   Lin   (   E  i  r   ;   E  j   )        normal-:     superscript  normal-d  r      subscript  φ  j    superscript   subscript  φ  i     1       normal-→     subscript  φ  i      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j       Lin    superscript   subscript  E  i   r    subscript  E  j        \mathrm{d}^{r}\big(\varphi_{j}\circ\varphi_{i}^{-1}\big):\varphi_{i}(U_{i}\cap
 U%
 _{j})\to\mathrm{Lin}\big(E_{i}^{r};E_{j}\big)         exists and is a continuous function with respect to the E i - norm  topology on subsets of E i and the operator norm topology on Lin( E i r ; E j .)   One can then show that there is a unique topology on X such that each U i is open and each φ i is a homeomorphism . Very often, this topological space is assumed to be a Hausdorff space , but this is not necessary from the point of view of the formal definition.  If all the Banach spaces E i are equal to the same space E , the atlas is called an E -atlas . However, it is not a priori necessary that the Banach spaces E i be the same space, or even isomorphic as topological vector spaces . However, if two charts ( U i , φ i ) and ( U j , φ j ) are such that U i and U j have a non-empty intersection , a quick examination of the derivative of the crossover map        φ  j   ∘   φ  i   -  1     :     φ  i    (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )    →    φ  j    (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )        normal-:     subscript  φ  j    superscript   subscript  φ  i     1      normal-→     subscript  φ  i      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j        subscript  φ  j      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j        \varphi_{j}\circ\varphi_{i}^{-1}:\varphi_{i}(U_{i}\cap U_{j})\to\varphi_{j}(U_%
 {i}\cap U_{j})     shows that E i and E j must indeed be isomorphic as topological vector spaces. Furthermore, the set of points x ∈ X for which there is a chart ( U i , φ i ) with x in U i and E i isomorphic to a given Banach space E is both open and closed . Hence, one can without loss of generality assume that, on each connected component of X , the atlas is an E -atlas for some fixed E .  A new chart ( U , φ ) is called compatible with a given atlas { ( U i , φ i ) | i ∈ I } if the crossover map        φ  i   ∘   φ   -  1     :    φ   (   U  ∩   U  i    )    →    φ  i    (   U  ∩   U  i    )        normal-:     subscript  φ  i    superscript  φ    1      normal-→    φ    U   subscript  U  i        subscript  φ  i     U   subscript  U  i        \varphi_{i}\circ\varphi^{-1}:\varphi(U\cap U_{i})\to\varphi_{i}(U\cap U_{i})     is an r -times continuously differentiable function for every i ∈ I . Two atlases are called compatible if every chart in one is compatible with the other atlas. Compatibility defines an equivalence relation on the class of all possible atlases on X .  A C r -manifold structure on X is then defined to be a choice of equivalence class of atlases on X of class C r . If all the Banach spaces E i are isomorphic as topological vector spaces (which is guaranteed to be the case if X is connected ), then an equivalent atlas can be found for which they are all equal to some Banach space E . X is then called an E -manifold , or one says that X is modeled on E .  Examples   If ( X , ||⋅||) is a Banach space, then X is a Banach manifold with an atlas containing a single, globally-defined chart (the identity map ).  Similarly, if U is an open subset of some Banach space, then U is a Banach manifold. (See the classification theorem below.)   Classification up to homeomorphism  It is by no means true that a finite-dimensional manifold of dimension n is globally homeomorphic to R n , or even an open subset of R n . However, in an infinite-dimensional setting, it is possible to classify “ well-behaved ” Banach manifolds up to homeomorphism quite nicely. A 1969 theorem of David Henderson states that every infinite-dimensional, separable , metric Banach manifold X can be embedded as an open subset of the infinite-dimensional, separable Hilbert space, H (up to linear isomorphism, there is only one such space). In fact, Henderson's result is stronger: the same conclusion holds for any metric manifold modeled on a separable infinite-dimensional Fréchet space .  The embedding homeomorphism can be used as a global chart for X . Thus, in the infinite-dimensional, separable, metric case, the “only” Banach manifolds are the open subsets of Hilbert space.
