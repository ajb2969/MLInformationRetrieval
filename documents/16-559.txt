   Derived scheme      Derived scheme   In algebraic geometry , a derived scheme is a pair    (  X  ,  𝒪  )     X  𝒪    (X,\mathcal{O})   consisting of a topological space  X and a sheaf    𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   of commutative ring spectra  1 on X such that (1) the pair    (  X  ,    π  0   𝒪   )     X     subscript  π  0   𝒪     (X,\pi_{0}\mathcal{O})   is a scheme and (2)     π  k   𝒪       subscript  π  k   𝒪    \pi_{k}\mathcal{O}   is a quasi-coherent      π  0   𝒪       subscript  π  0   𝒪    \pi_{0}\mathcal{O}   - module . The notion gives a homotopy -theoretic generalization of a scheme.  Connection with differential graded rings  Just as affine algebraic geometry is equivalent (in categorical sense ) to the theory of commutative rings (commonly called commutative algebra ), affine derived algebraic geometry is (roughly in homotopical sense) equivalent to the theory of commutative differential graded rings .  Generalizations  A derived stack is a stacky generalization of a derived scheme.  Notes  References   P. Goerss, Topological Modular Forms [after Hopkins, Miller, and Lurie]  B.
