Derived scheme

In algebraic geometry, a derived scheme is a pair 
 
 
 
  consisting of a topological space X and a sheaf

 
  of commutative ring spectra 1 on X such that (1) the pair 
 
 
 
  is a scheme and (2) 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-coherent

 
 -module. The notion gives a homotopy-theoretic generalization of a scheme.
Connection with differential graded rings
Just as affine algebraic geometry is equivalent (in categorical sense) to the theory of commutative rings (commonly called commutative algebra), affine derived algebraic geometry is (roughly in homotopical sense) equivalent to the theory of commutative differential graded rings.
Generalizations
A derived stack is a stacky generalization of a derived scheme.
