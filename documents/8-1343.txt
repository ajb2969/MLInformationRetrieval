   Factorization system      Factorization system   In mathematics , it can be shown that every function can be written as the composite of a surjective function followed by an injective function. Factorization systems are a generalization of this situation in category theory .  Definition  A factorization system ( E , M ) for a category  C consists of two classes of morphisms  E and M of C such that:   E and M both contain all isomorphisms of C and are closed under composition.  Every morphism f of C can be factored as    f  =   m  ∘  e       f    m  e     f=m\circ e   for some morphisms    e  ∈  E      e  E    e\in E   and    m  ∈  M      m  M    m\in M   .  The factorization is functorial : if   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   are two morphisms such that     v  m  e   =    m  ′    e  ′   u         v  m  e      superscript  m  normal-′    superscript  e  normal-′   u     vme=m^{\prime}e^{\prime}u   for some morphisms     e  ,   e  ′    ∈  E       e   superscript  e  normal-′    E    e,e^{\prime}\in E   and     m  ,   m  ′    ∈  M       m   superscript  m  normal-′    M    m,m^{\prime}\in M   , then there exists a unique morphism   w   w   w   making the following diagram commute:   (Figure)  Factorization_system_functoriality.png   Orthogonality  Two morphisms   e   e   e   and   m   m   m   are said to be orthogonal , denoted    e  ↓  m     normal-↓  e  m    e\downarrow m   , if for every pair of morphisms   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   such that     v  e   =   m  u         v  e     m  u     ve=mu   there is a unique morphism   w   w   w   such that the diagram  (Figure)  Factorization_system_orthogonality.png   commutes. This notion can be extended to define the orthogonals of sets of morphisms by       H  ↑   =   {  e  |  ∀  h  ∈  H  ,  e  ↓  h  }      fragments   superscript  H  normal-↑     fragments  normal-{  e   normal-|   for-all  h   H  normal-,  e  normal-↓  h  normal-}     H^{\uparrow}=\{e\quad|\quad\forall h\in H,e\downarrow h\}   and     H  ↓   =   {  m  |  ∀  h  ∈  H  ,  h  ↓  m  }   .     fragments   superscript  H  normal-↓     fragments  normal-{  m   normal-|   for-all  h   H  normal-,  h  normal-↓  m  normal-}   normal-.    H^{\downarrow}=\{m\quad|\quad\forall h\in H,h\downarrow m\}.     Since in a factorization system    E  ∩  M      E  M    E\cap M   contains all the isomorphisms, the condition (3) of the definition is equivalent to   (3')    E  ⊂   M  ↑       E   superscript  M  normal-↑     E\subset M^{\uparrow}   and     M  ⊂   E  ↓    .      M   superscript  E  normal-↓     M\subset E^{\downarrow}.      Equivalent definition  The pair    (  E  ,  M  )     E  M    (E,M)   of classes of morphisms of C is a factorization system if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:   Every morphism f of C can be factored as    f  =   m  ∘  e       f    m  e     f=m\circ e   with    e  ∈  E      e  E    e\in E   and     m  ∈  M   .      m  M    m\in M.         E  =   M  ↑       E   superscript  M  normal-↑     E=M^{\uparrow}   and     M  =   E  ↓    .      M   superscript  E  normal-↓     M=E^{\downarrow}.      Weak factorization systems  Suppose e and m are two morphisms in a category C . Then e has the left lifting property with respect to m (resp. m has the right lifting property with respect to e ) when for every pair of morphisms u and v such that ve = mu there is a morphism w such that the following diagram commutes. The difference with orthogonality is that w is not necessarily unique.  (Figure)  Factorization_system_orthogonality.png   A weak factorization system ( E , M ) for a category C consists of two classes of morphisms E and M of C such that :   The class E is exactly the class of morphisms having the left lifting property wrt the morphisms of M .  The class M is exactly the class of morphisms having the right lifting property wrt the morphisms of E .  Every morphism f of C can be factored as    f  =   m  ∘  e       f    m  e     f=m\circ e   for some morphisms    e  ∈  E      e  E    e\in E   and    m  ∈  M      m  M    m\in M   .
