Factorization system

In mathematics, it can be shown that every function can be written as the composite of a surjective function followed by an injective function. Factorization systems are a generalization of this situation in category theory.
Definition
A factorization system (E, M) for a category C consists of two classes of morphisms E and M of C such that:

E and M both contain all isomorphisms of C and are closed under composition.
Every morphism f of C can be factored as 
 
 
 
  for some morphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The factorization is functorial: if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two morphisms such that 
 
 
 
  for some morphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a unique morphism 
 
 
 
  making the following diagram commute:

Orthogonality
Two morphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are said to be orthogonal, denoted 
 
 
 
 , if for every pair of morphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  there is a unique morphism 
 
 
 
  such that the diagram

commutes. This notion can be extended to define the orthogonals of sets of morphisms by


 
  and 
 
 

Since in a factorization system 
 
 
 
  contains all the isomorphisms, the condition (3) of the definition is equivalent to

(3') 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


Equivalent definition
The pair 
 
 
 
  of classes of morphisms of C is a factorization system if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:

Every morphism f of C can be factored as 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 



 
  and 
 
 


Weak factorization systems
Suppose e and m are two morphisms in a category C. Then e has the left lifting property with respect to m (resp. m has the right lifting property with respect to e) when for every pair of morphisms u and v such that ve=mu there is a morphism w such that the following diagram commutes. The difference with orthogonality is that w is not necessarily unique.

A weak factorization system (E, M) for a category C consists of two classes of morphisms E and M of C such that :

The class E is exactly the class of morphisms having the left lifting property wrt the morphisms of M.
The class M is exactly the class of morphisms having the right lifting property wrt the morphisms of E.
Every morphism f of C can be factored as 
 
 
 
  for some morphisms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
