   Exact differential equation      Exact differential equation   In mathematics , an exact differential equation or total differential equation is a certain kind of ordinary differential equation which is widely used in physics and engineering .  Definition  Given a simply connected and open subset D of R 2 and two functions I and J which are continuous on D then an implicit  first-order  ordinary differential equation of the form         I   (  x  ,  y  )   d  x   +   J   (  x  ,  y  )   d  y    =  0   ,          I   x  y   normal-d  x     J   x  y   normal-d  y    0    I(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x+J(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y=0,\,\!     is called an exact differential equation if there exists a continuously differentiable function F , called the potential function , so that         ∂  F    ∂  x     (  x  ,  y  )    =  I            F     x     x  y    I    \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x,y)=I   and          ∂  F    ∂  y     (  x  ,  y  )    =  J   .            F     y     x  y    J    \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x,y)=J.     The nomenclature of "exact differential equation" refers to the exact derivative of a function. For a function    F   (   x  0   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x   n  -  1    ,   x  n   )       F    subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x    n  1     subscript  x  n      F(x_{0},x_{1},...,x_{n-1},x_{n})   , the exact or total derivative with respect to    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   is given by         d  F    d   x  0     =     ∂  F    ∂   x  0     +    ∑   i  =  1   n      ∂  F    ∂   x  i       d   x  i     d   x  0         .          normal-d  F     normal-d   subscript  x  0           F      subscript  x  0       superscript   subscript     i  1    n         F      subscript  x  i         normal-d   subscript  x  i      normal-d   subscript  x  0          \frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x_{0}}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_{0}}+\sum_{i=%
 1}^{n}\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_{i}}\frac{\mathrm{d}x_{i}}{\mathrm{d}x_{0}}.     Example  The function       F   (  x  ,  y  )    :=    1  2    (    x  2   +   y  2    )       assign    F   x  y        1  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       F(x,y):=\frac{1}{2}(x^{2}+y^{2})   is a potential function for the differential equation        x  d  x   +   y  d  y    =   0.           x  d  x     y  d  y    0.    xdx+ydy=0.\,     Existence of potential functions  In physical applications the functions I and J are usually not only continuous but even continuously differentiable . Schwarz's Theorem then provides us with a necessary criterion for the existence of a potential function. For differential equations defined on simply connected sets the criterion is even sufficient and we get the following theorem:  Given a differential equation of the form (for example, when F has zero slope in the x and y direction at F(x,y) ):         I   (  x  ,  y  )   d  x   +   J   (  x  ,  y  )   d  y    =  0   ,          I   x  y   normal-d  x     J   x  y   normal-d  y    0    I(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}x+J(x,y)\,\mathrm{d}y=0,\,\!   with I and J continuously differentiable on a simply connected and open subset D of R 2 then a potential function F exists if and only if          ∂  I    ∂  y     (  x  ,  y  )    =     ∂  J    ∂  x     (  x  ,  y  )     .            I     y     x  y          J     x     x  y      \frac{\partial I}{\partial y}(x,y)=\frac{\partial J}{\partial x}(x,y).     Solutions to exact differential equations  Given an exact differential equation defined on some simply connected and open subset D of R 2 with potential function F then a differentiable function f with (x, f ( x )) in D is a solution if and only if there exists real number  c so that        F   (  x  ,   f   (  x  )    )    =  c   .        F   x    f  x     c    F(x,f(x))=c.\,     For an initial value problem       y   (   x  0   )    =    y  0          y   subscript  x  0     subscript  y  0     y(x_{0})=y_{0}\,   we can locally find a potential function by        F   (  x  ,  y  )    =     ∫   x  0   x    I   (  t  ,   y  0   )   d  t    +    ∫   y  0   y     [    J   (  x  ,  t  )    -    ∫   x  0   x      ∂  I    ∂  t     (  u  ,  t  )   d   u      ]   d  t      .        F   x  y        superscript   subscript    subscript  x  0    x     I   t   subscript  y  0    normal-d  t      superscript   subscript    subscript  y  0    y      delimited-[]      J   x  t      superscript   subscript    subscript  x  0    x         I     t     u  t   normal-d  u      normal-d  t       F(x,y)=\int_{x_{0}}^{x}I(t,y_{0})\mathrm{d}t+\int_{y_{0}}^{y}\left[J(x,t)-\int%
 _{x_{0}}^{x}\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}(u,t)\,\mathrm{d}u\,\right]\mathrm{d}t.     Solving       F   (  x  ,  y  )    =   c         F   x  y    c    F(x,y)=c\,   for y , where c is a real number, we can then construct all solutions.
