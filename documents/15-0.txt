Kervaire semi-characteristic

In mathematics, the Kervaire semi-characteristic, introduced by , is an invariant of manifolds M of dimension 4n+1 taking values in Z/2Z, given by

k(M) = $\sum_{i=0}^n \dim H^{2i}(M,R)\bmod 2$


showed that it is given by the index of a skew-adjoint elliptic operator.
