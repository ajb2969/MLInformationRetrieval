   Zeta Apodis      Zeta Apodis   Zeta Apodis (ζ Aps, ζ Apodis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the southern constellation of Apus . It has an apparent visual magnitude of +4.78, 1 which is bright enough to allow it to be seen with the naked eye. The distance to this star is known from parallax measurements to be around . 2  The spectrum of Zeta Apodis matches a stellar classification of K2 III, 3 with the luminosity class of III indicating it is an evolved  giant star . The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening , is . 4 At the estimated distance of Eta Draconis, 5 this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the Sun . 6 The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of 4,388 K, 7 which gives it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star . 8  Naming  In Chinese caused by adaptation of the European southern hemisphere constellations into the Chinese system,  (), meaning Exotic Bird , refers to an asterism consisting of ζ Apodis, ι Apodis , β Apodis , γ Apodis , δ Octantis , δ 1 Apodis , η Apodis , α Apodis and ε Apodis . Consequently, ζ Apodis itself is known as  (, .) 9  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 40\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 10  11  }}  External links   [ http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Zeta+Apodis&NbIdent; ;=1&Radius;=2&Radius.unit;=arcmin&submit;=submit+id Simbad]  [ http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=17+21+59.4776-67+46+14.407&ident; ;=*+zet+Aps&submit;=Aladin+previewer Image Zeta Apodis]   "  156277  Apodis, Zeta  Category:Apus (constellation)  Category:K-type giants              AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 29 日 ↩  ↩  ↩
