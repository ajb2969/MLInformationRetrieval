   Sparsely totient number      Sparsely totient number   In mathematics , a sparsely totient number is a certain kind of natural number . A natural number, n , is sparsely totient if for all m > n ,       φ   (  m  )    >   φ   (  n  )          φ  m     φ  n     \varphi(m)>\varphi(n)     where   φ   φ   \varphi   is Euler's totient function . The first few sparsely totient numbers are:  2 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 30 , 42 , 60 , 66 , 90 , 120 , 126 , 150 , 210 , 240 , 270 , 330 , 420 , 462, 510, 630 .  For example, 18 is a sparsely totient number because ϕ(18) = 6, and any number m > 18 falls into at least one of the following classes:   m has a prime factor p ≥ 11, so ϕ( m ) ≥ ϕ(11) = 10 > ϕ(18).  m is a multiple of 7 and m /7 ≥ 3, so ϕ( m ) ≥ 2ϕ(7) = 12 > ϕ(18).  m is a multiple of 5 and m /5 ≥ 4, so ϕ( m ) ≥ 2ϕ(5) = 8 > ϕ(18).  m is a multiple of 3 and m /3 ≥ 7, so ϕ( m ) ≥ 4ϕ(3) = 8 > ϕ(18).  m is a power of 2 and m ≥ 32, so ϕ( m ) ≥ ϕ(32) = 16 > ϕ(18).   The concept was introduced by David Masser and Peter Shiu in 1986. As they showed, every primorial is sparsely totient.  Properties   If P ( n ) is the largest prime factor of n , then     lim inf    P   (  n  )    /   log  n     =  1       limit-infimum      P  n     n     1    \liminf P(n)/\log n=1   .       P   (  n  )    ≪    log  δ   n      much-less-than    P  n     superscript   δ   n     P(n)\ll\log^{\delta}n   holds for an exponent    δ  =   37  /  20       δ    37  20     \delta=37/20   .  It is conjectured that     lim sup    P   (  n  )    /   log  n     =  2       limit-supremum      P  n     n     2    \limsup P(n)/\log n=2   .   References      "  Category:Integer sequences
