Elias Bassalygo bound

The Elias-Bassalygo bound is a mathematical limit used in coding theory for error correction during data transmission or communications. The properties of the Elias-Bassalygo bound are defined, below, using mathematical expressions.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 -ary code of length 
 
 
 
 , i.e. a subset of 
 
 
 
 . (Each 
 
 
 
 -ary block code of length 
 
 
 
  is a subset of the strings of 
 
 
 
  where the alphabet set 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  elements). Let 
 
 
 
  be the rate of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (delta) be the relative distance.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Hamming ball of radius 
 
 
 
  centered at 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the volume of the Hamming ball of radius 
 
 
 
 . It is obvious that the volume of a Hamming Ball is translation-invariant, i.e. irrelevant with position of 
 
 
 
 . In particular, 
 
 
 
  .
With large enough 
 
 
 
 , the rate

 
  and the relative distance

 
  satisfies the Elias-Bassalygo bound:


where



is the q-ary entropy function and


 
  is a function related with Johnson bound.
Proof
To prove the Elias–Bassalygo bound, start with the following Lemma:
Lemma 1: Given a q-ary code, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , there exists a Hamming ball of radius 
 
 
 
  with at least 
 
 
 
  codewords in it.
Proof of Lemma 1: To prove Lemma 1, use the probability method. Randomly pick a received word 
 
 
 
 . The expected size of overlapped region between 
 
 
 
  and the Hamming ball centered at 
 
 
 
  with radius 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
  is (uniform) randomly selected. Since this is the expected value of the size, there must exist at least one 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , otherwise the expectation must be smaller than this value.
Now we prove the Elias–Bassalygo bound.
Define 
 
 
 
 .
By Lemma 1, there exists a Hamming ball with 
 
 
 
  codewords such that 
 
 

By the Johnson bound, we have 
 
 
 
 . Thus,



The second inequality follows from lower bound on the volume of a Hamming ball: 
 
 
 
 .
Putting in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  gives the second inequality.
Therefore we have
