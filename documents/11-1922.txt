Red blood cell indices

Red blood cell indices are blood tests that provide information about the hemoglobin content and size of red blood cells. Abnormal values indicate the presence of anemia and which type of anemia it is.1
Mean corpuscular volume
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is the average volume of a red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hematocrit (Hct) by the red blood cell count.



 
  x 10
Normal range: 80-100 fL

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is the average amount of hemoglobin (Hb) per red blood cell and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the red blood cell count.



 
  x 10
Normal range: 27-31 pg/cell

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is the average concentration of hemoglobin per unit volume of red blood cells and is calculated by dividing the hemoglobin by the hematocrit.



 
  x 100
Normal range: 32-36 g/dL
