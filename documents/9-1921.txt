   Magnetic impurity      Magnetic impurity   A magnetic impurity is an impurity in a host metal that has a magnetic moment . The magnetic impurity can then interact with the conduction electrons of the metal, leading to interesting physics such as the Kondo effect , and heavy fermion behaviour. Some examples of magnetic impurities that metals can be doped with are iron and nickel . Such an impurity will contribute a Curie-Weiss term to the magnetic susceptibility ,     χ   i  m  p    =   C   T  +  θ         subscript  χ    i  m  p      C    T  θ      \chi_{imp}=\frac{C}{T+\theta}   .  Early theoretical work concentrated on explaining the trend observed as the impurity was varied across the transition metal group. Based on the idea of a virtual bound state , Anderson proposed a model that was successful in explaining the formation of a localized magnetic moment from a magnetic impurity.
