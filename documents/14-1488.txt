Submodular set function

In mathematics, a submodular set function (also known as a submodular function) is a set function whose value, informally, has the property that the difference in the incremental value of the function, that a single element makes when added to an input set , decreases as the size of the input set increases. Submodular functions have a natural diminishing returns property which makes them suitable for many applications, including approximation algorithms, game theory (as functions modeling user preferences), electrical networks, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Definition
If 
 
 
 
  is a set, a submodular function is a set function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the power set of 
 
 
 
 
 , which satisfies one of the following equivalent definitions.1

For every 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
 .
For every 
 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
 .
For every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
 .

A nonnegative submodular function is also a subadditive function, but a subadditive function need not be submodular.
Types of submodular functions
Monotone
A submodular function 
 
 
 
 
  is monotone if for every 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
 . Examples of monotone submodular functions include:

Linear functions : Any function of the form 
 
 
 
  is called a linear function. Additionally if 
 
 
 
  then f is monotone.
 Budget-additive functions : Any function of the form 
 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called budget additive.
 Coverage functions : Let 
 
 
 
  be a collection of subsets of some ground set 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  is called a coverage function. This can be generalized by adding non-negative weights to the elements.
Entropy : Let 
 
 
 
  be a set of random variables. Then for any 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
  is a submodular function, where 
 
 
 
 
  is the entropy of the set of random variables 
 
 

Matroid rank functions : Let 
 
 
 
  be the ground set on which a matroid is defined. Then the rank function of the matroid is a submodular function.2

Non-monotone
A submodular function which is not monotone is called non-monotone.
Symmetric
A non-monotone submodular function 
 
 
 
  is called symmetric if for every 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
 
 . Examples of symmetric non-monotone submodular functions include:

Graph cuts : Let 
 
 
 
  be the vertices of a graph. For any set of vertices 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
  denote the number of edges 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This can be generalized by adding non-negative weights to the edges.
Mutual information : Let 
 
 
 
  be a set of random variables. Then for any 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
  is a submodular function, where 
 
 
 
 
  is the mutual information.

Asymmetric
A non-monotone submodular function which is not symmetric is called asymmetric.

Directed cuts : Let 
 
 
 
  be the vertices of a directed graph. For any set of vertices 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
  denote the number of edges 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This can be generalized by adding non-negative weights to the directed edges.

Continuous extensions
Lovász extension
This extension is named after mathematician László Lovász. Consider any vector 
 
 
 
  such that each 
 
 
 
 . Then the Lovász extension is defined as 
 
 
 
  where the expectation is over 
 
 
 
 
  chosen from the uniform distribution on the interval 
 
 
 
 . The Lovász extension is a convex function.
Multilinear extension
Consider any vector 
 
 
 
  such that each 
 
 
 
 . Then the multilinear extension is defined as 
 
 
 
 .
Convex closure
Consider any vector 
 
 
 
 
  such that each 
 
 
 
 . Then the convex closure is defined as 
 
 
 
 . It can be shown that 
 
 
 
 .
Concave closure
Consider any vector 
 
 
 
  such that each 
 
 
 
 
 . Then the concave closure is defined as 
 
 
 
 .
Properties

The class of submodular functions is closed under non-negative linear combinations. Consider any submodular function 
 
 
 
  and non-negative numbers 
 
 
 
 . Then the function 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
 
  is submodular. Furthermore, for any submodular function 
 
 
 
 , the function defined by 
 
 
 
  is submodular. The function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a real number, is submodular whenever 
 
 
 
 
  is monotonic.
If 
 
 
 
  is a submodular function then 
 
 
 
  defined as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a concave function, is also a submodular function.
Consider a random process where a set 
 
 
 
 
  is chosen with each element in 
 
 
 
  being included in 
 
 
 
  independently with probability 
 
 
 
 . Then the following inequality is true 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the empty set. More generally consider the following random process where a set 
 
 
 
  is constructed as follows. For each of 
 
 
 
  construct 
 
 
 
  by including each element in 
 
 
 
  independently into 
 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore let 
 
 
 
 . Then the following inequality is true 
 
 
 
 .

Optimization problems
Submodular functions have properties which are very similar to convex and concave functions. For this reason, an optimization problem which concerns optimizing a convex or concave function can also be described as the problem of maximizing or minimizing a submodular function subject to some constraints.
Submodular Minimization
The simplest minimization problem is to find a set 
 
 
 
  which minimizes a submodular function subject to no constraints. This problem is computable in (strongly)34 polynomial time.56 Computing the minimum cut in a graph is a special case of this general minimization problem. Unfortunately, however, even simple constraints like cardinality lower bound constraints make this problem NP hard, with polynomial lower bound approximation factors.78
Submodular Maximization
Unlike minimization, maximization of submodular functions is usually NP-hard. Many problems, such as max cut and the maximum coverage problem, can be cast as special cases of this general maximization problem under suitable constraints. Typically, the approximation algorithms for these problems are based on either greedy algorithms or local search algorithms. The problem of maximizing a symmetric non-monotone submodular function subject to no constraints admits a 1/2 approximation algorithm.9 Computing the maximum cut of a graph is a special case of this problem. The more general problem of maximizing an arbitrary non-monotone submodular function subject to no constraints also admits a 1/2 approximation algorithm.10 The problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint admits a 
 
 
 
 
  approximation algorithm.11 The maximum coverage problem is a special case of this problem. The more general problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint also admits a 
 
 
 
  approximation algorithm.1213 Many of these algorithms can be unified within a semi-differential based framework of algorithms.14
Related Optimization Problems
Apart from submodular minimization and maximization, another natural problem is Difference of Submodular Optimization.1516 Unfortunately, this problem is not only NP hard, but also inapproximable.17 A related optimization problem is minimize or maximize a submodular function, subject to a submodular level set constraint (also called submodular optimization subject to submodular cover or submodular knapsack constraint). This problem admits bounded approximation guarantees.18 Another optimization problem involves partitioning data based on a submodular function, so as to maximize the average welfare. This problem is called the submodular welfare problem.19
Applications
Submodular functions naturally occur in several real world applications, in economics, game theory, machine learning and computer vision. Owing the diminishing returns property, submodular functions naturally model costs of items, since there is often a larger discount, with an increase in the items one buys. Submodular functions model notions of complexity, similarity and cooperation when they appear in minimization problems. In maximization problems, on the other hand, they model notions of diversity, information and coverage.
