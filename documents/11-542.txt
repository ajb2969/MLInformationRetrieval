   Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase      Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase   In enzymology , a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate]n + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate]n-x + poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate]x; x   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-5   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are [[poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate]n]] and H 2 O , whereas its two products are [[poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate]n-x]] and [[poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate]x; x]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate] hydrolase . Other names in common use include PHB depolymerase , poly(3HB) depolymerase , poly[(R)-hydroxyalkanoic acid] depolymerase , poly(HA) depolymerase , poly(HASCL) depolymerase , and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] hydrolase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
