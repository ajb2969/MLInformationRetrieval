Tartrate epimerase

In enzymology, a tartrate epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R,R)-tartrate 
 
 
 
  meso-tartrate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (R,R)-tartrate, and one product, meso-tartrate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on hydroxy acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is tartrate epimerase. This enzyme is also called tartaric racemase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
