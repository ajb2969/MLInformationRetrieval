   Bochner's theorem      Bochner's theorem   In mathematics , Bochner's theorem (named for Salomon Bochner ) characterizes the Fourier transform of a positive finite Borel measure on the real line. More generally in harmonic analysis , Bochner's theorem asserts that under Fourier transform a continuous positive definite function on a locally compact  abelian group corresponds to a finite positive measure on the Pontryagin dual group .  The theorem for locally compact abelian groups  Bochner's theorem for a locally compact Abelian group G , with dual group    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   , says the following:  Theorem For any normalized continuous positive definite function f on G (normalization here means f is 1 at the unit of G ), there exists a unique probability measure on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   such that        f   (  g  )    =    ‚à´   G  ^     Œæ   (  g  )   d  Œº   (  Œæ  )      ,        f  g     subscript    normal-^  G      Œæ  g  d  Œº  Œæ      f(g)=\int_{\widehat{G}}\xi(g)d\mu(\xi),     i.e. f is the Fourier transform of a unique probability measure Œº on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   . Conversely, the Fourier transform of a probability measure on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   is necessarily a normalized continuous positive definite function f on G . This is in fact a one-to-one correspondence.  The Gelfand-Fourier transform is an isomorphism between the group C*-algebra C*( G ) and C 0 ( G ^). The theorem is essentially the dual statement for states of the two Abelian C*-algebras.  The proof of the theorem passes through vector states on strongly continuous  unitary representations of G (the proof in fact shows every normalized continuous positive definite function must be of this form).  Given a normalized continuous positive definite function f on G , one can construct a strongly continuous unitary representation of G in a natural way: Let F 0 ( G ) be the family of complex valued functions on G with finite support, i.e. h ( g ) = 0 for all but finitely many g . The positive definite kernel K ( g 1 , g 2 ) = f ( g 1 - g 2 ) induces a (possibly degenerate) inner product on F 0 ( G ). Quotiening out degeneracy and taking the completion gives a Hilbert space      (  ‚Ñã  ,    ‚ü®  ,  ‚ü©   f   )     fragments  normal-(  H  normal-,   subscript   fragments  normal-‚ü®  normal-,  normal-‚ü©   f   normal-)    (\mathcal{H},\langle\;,\;\rangle_{f})     whose typical element is an equivalence class [ h ]. For a fixed g in G , the " shift operator " U g defined by ( U g )('' h '') (g') = h ( g' - g ), for a representative of [ h ], is unitary. So the map       g   ‚Ü¶   U  g      maps-to  g   subscript  U  g     g\;\mapsto\;U_{g}     is a unitary representations of G on    (  ‚Ñã  ,    ‚ü®  ,  ‚ü©   f   )     fragments  normal-(  H  normal-,   subscript   fragments  normal-‚ü®  normal-,  normal-‚ü©   f   normal-)    (\mathcal{H},\langle\;,\;\rangle_{f})   . By continuity of f , it is weakly continuous, therefore strongly continuous. By construction, we have        ‚ü®    U  g    [  e  ]    ,   [  e  ]   ‚ü©   f   =   f   (  g  )         subscript      subscript  U  g    delimited-[]  e     delimited-[]  e    f     f  g     \langle U_{g}[e],[e]\rangle_{f}=f(g)     where [ e ] is the class of the function that is 1 on the identity of G and zero elsewhere. But by Gelfand-Fourier isomorphism, the vector state     ‚ü®  ‚ãÖ   [  e  ]   ,   [  e  ]   ‚ü©   f     subscript   fragments  normal-‚ü®  normal-‚ãÖ   fragments  normal-[  e  normal-]   normal-,   fragments  normal-[  e  normal-]   normal-‚ü©   f    \langle\cdot[e],[e]\rangle_{f}   on C*( G ) is the pull-back of a state on     C  0    (   G  ^   )        subscript  C  0    normal-^  G     C_{0}(\widehat{G})   , which is necessarily integration against a probability measure Œº. Chasing through the isomorphisms then gives         ‚ü®    U  g    [  e  ]    ,   [  e  ]   ‚ü©   f   =    ‚à´   G  ^     Œæ   (  g  )   d  Œº   (  Œæ  )      .       subscript      subscript  U  g    delimited-[]  e     delimited-[]  e    f     subscript    normal-^  G      Œæ  g  d  Œº  Œæ      \langle U_{g}[e],[e]\rangle_{f}=\int_{\widehat{G}}\xi(g)d\mu(\xi).     On the other hand, given a probability measure Œº on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   , the function        f   (  g  )    =    ‚à´   G  ^     Œæ   (  g  )   d  Œº   (  Œæ  )      .        f  g     subscript    normal-^  G      Œæ  g  d  Œº  Œæ      f(g)=\int_{\widehat{G}}\xi(g)d\mu(\xi).     is a normalized continuous positive definite function. Continuity of f follows from the dominated convergence theorem . For positive definiteness, take a nondegenerate representation of     C  0    (   G  ^   )        subscript  C  0    normal-^  G     C_{0}(\widehat{G})   . This extends uniquely to a representation of its multiplier algebra      C  b    (   G  ^   )        subscript  C  b    normal-^  G     C_{b}(\widehat{G})   and therefore a strongly continuous unitary representation U g . As above we have f given by some vector state on U g        f   (  g  )    =   ‚ü®    U  g   v   ,  v  ‚ü©    ,        f  g       subscript  U  g   v   v     f(g)=\langle U_{g}v,v\rangle,     therefore positive-definite.  The two constructions are mutual inverses.  Special cases  Bochner's theorem in the special case of the discrete group  Z is often referred to as Herglotz 's theorem, (see Herglotz representation theorem ) and says that a function f on Z with f (0) = 1 is positive definite if and only if there exists a probability measure Œº on the circle T such that        f   (  k  )    =    ‚à´  ùïã     e   -   2  œÄ  i  k  x     d  Œº   (  x  )      .        f  k     subscript   ùïã      superscript  e      2  œÄ  i  k  x     d  Œº  x      f(k)=\int_{\mathbb{T}}e^{-2\pi ikx}d\mu(x).     Similarly, a continuous function f on R with f (0) = 1 is positive definite if and only if there exists a probability measure Œº on R such that        f   (  t  )    =    ‚à´  ‚Ñù     e   -   2  œÄ  i  Œæ  t     d  Œº   (  Œæ  )      .        f  t     subscript   ‚Ñù      superscript  e      2  œÄ  i  Œæ  t     d  Œº  Œæ      f(t)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}e^{-2\pi i\xi t}d\mu(\xi).     Applications  In statistics , Bochner's theorem can be used to describe the serial correlation of certain type of time series . A sequence of random variables    {   f  n   }      subscript  f  n     \{f_{n}\}   of mean 0 is a (wide-sense) stationary time series if the covariance      Cov   (   f  n   ,   f  m   )       Cov    subscript  f  n    subscript  f  m      \mbox{Cov}(f_{n},f_{m})     only depends on n - m . The function       g   (   n  -  m   )    =   Cov   (   f  n   ,   f  m   )          g    n  m      Cov    subscript  f  n    subscript  f  m       g(n-m)=\mbox{Cov}(f_{n},f_{m})     is called the autocovariance function of the time series. By the mean zero assumption,       g   (   n  -  m   )    =   ‚ü®   f  n   ,   f  m   ‚ü©         g    n  m      subscript  f  n    subscript  f  m      g(n-m)=\langle f_{n},f_{m}\rangle     where ‚ü®‚ãÖ , ‚ãÖ‚ü© denotes the inner product on the Hilbert space of random variables with finite second moments. It is then immediate that g is a positive definite function on the integers ‚Ñ§. By Bochner's theorem, there exists a unique positive measure Œº on [0, 1] such that       g   (  k  )    =   ‚à´    e   -   2  œÄ  i  k  x     d  Œº   (  x  )           g  k        superscript  e      2  œÄ  i  k  x     d  Œº  x      g(k)=\int e^{-2\pi ikx}d\mu(x)   .  This measure Œº is called the spectral measure of the time series. It yields information about the "seasonal trends" of the series.  For example, let z be an m -th root of unity (with the current identification, this is 1/m ‚àà [0,1]) and f be a random variable of mean 0 and variance 1. Consider the time series    {    z  n   f   }        superscript  z  n   f     \{z^{n}f\}   . The autocovariance function is       g   (  k  )    =   z  k         g  k    superscript  z  k     g(k)=z^{k}   .  Evidently the corresponding spectral measure is the Dirac point mass centered at z . This is related to the fact that the time series repeats itself every m periods.  When g has sufficiently fast decay, the measure Œº is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and its Radon-Nikodym derivative  f is called the spectral density of the time series. When g lies in l 1 (‚Ñ§), f is the Fourier transform of g .  See also   Positive definite function on a group  Characteristic function (probability theory)   References    M. Reed and B.
