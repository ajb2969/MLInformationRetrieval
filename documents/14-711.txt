   No free lunch with vanishing risk      No free lunch with vanishing risk   No free lunch with vanishing risk ( NFLVR ) is a no- arbitrage argument. We have free lunch with vanishing risk if by utilizing a sequence of tame self-financing portfolios which converge to an arbitrage strategy, we can approximate a self-financing portfolio (called the free lunch with vanishing risk ). 1  Mathematical representation  For a semimartingale  S , let    K  =   {    (   H  ⋅  S   )   ∞   :     H  admissible   ,    (   H  ⋅  S   )   ∞    =    lim   t  →  ∞       (   H  ⋅  S   )   t   exists a.s.     }       K   conditional-set   subscript   normal-⋅  H  S          H  admissible    subscript   normal-⋅  H  S        subscript    normal-→  t        subscript   normal-⋅  H  S   t   exists a.s.        K=\{(H\cdot S)_{\infty}:H\text{ admissible},(H\cdot S)_{\infty}=\lim_{t\to%
 \infty}(H\cdot S)_{t}\text{ exists a.s.}\}   where a strategy is admissible if it is permitted by the market . Then define    C  =   {   g  ∈    L  ∞    (  P  )     :   g  ≤    f    ∀  f    ∈  K   }       C   conditional-set    g     superscript  L    P        g    f   for-all  f         K       C=\{g\in L^{\infty}(P):g\leq f\;\forall f\in K\}   . S is said to satisfy no free lunch with vanishing risk if      C  ¯   ∩    L  +  ∞    (  P  )     =   {  0  }          normal-¯  C      subscript   superscript  L      P     0     \bar{C}\cap L^{\infty}_{+}(P)=\{0\}   such that    C  ¯     normal-¯  C    \bar{C}   is the closure of C in the norm topology of     L  +  ∞    (  P  )        subscript   superscript  L      P    L^{\infty}_{+}(P)   . 2  Fundamental theorem of asset pricing  If    S  =    (   S  t   )    t  =  0   T       S   superscript   subscript   subscript  S  t     t  0    T     S=(S_{t})_{t=0}^{T}   is a semimartingale with values in    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   then S does not allow for a free lunch with vanishing risk if and only if there exists an equivalent martingale measure    ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   such that S is a sigma-martingale under   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   . 3  References  "  Category:Financial markets  Category:Mathematical finance     ↩  ↩  ↩
