No free lunch with vanishing risk

No free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) is a no-arbitrage argument. We have free lunch with vanishing risk if by utilizing a sequence of tame self-financing portfolios which converge to an arbitrage strategy, we can approximate a self-financing portfolio (called the free lunch with vanishing risk).1
Mathematical representation
For a semimartingale S, let 
 
 
 
  where a strategy is admissible if it is permitted by the market. Then define 
 
 
 
 . S is said to satisfy no free lunch with vanishing risk if 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the closure of C in the norm topology of

Fundamental theorem of asset pricing
If 
 
 
 
  is a semimartingale with values in 
 
 
 
  then S does not allow for a free lunch with vanishing risk if and only if there exists an equivalent martingale measure

 
  such that S is a sigma-martingale under
