   End extension      End extension   In model theory and set theory , which are disciplines within mathematics, a model    𝔅  =   ⟨  B  ,  F  ⟩       𝔅   B  F     \mathfrak{B}=\langle B,F\rangle   of some axiom system of set theory     T    T   T\,   in the language of set theory is an end extension of    𝔄  =   ⟨  A  ,  E  ⟩       𝔄   A  E     \mathfrak{A}=\langle A,E\rangle   , in symbols    𝔄   ⊆  end   𝔅      subscript   end   𝔄  𝔅    \mathfrak{A}\subseteq_{\text{end}}\mathfrak{B}   , if      𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   is a substructure of   𝔅   𝔅   \mathfrak{B}   , and      b  ∈  A      b  A    b\in A   whenever    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   and    b  F   a       b  F  a    bFa\,   hold, i.e., no new elements are added by   𝔅   𝔅   \mathfrak{B}   to the elements of   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   .   The following is an equivalent definition of end extension   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   is a substructure of   𝔅   𝔅   \mathfrak{B}   , and     {   b  ∈  A   :   b  E  a   }   =   {   b  ∈  B   :   b  F  a   }        conditional-set    b  A     b  E  a     conditional-set    b  B     b  F  a      \{b\in A:bEa\}=\{b\in B:bFa\}   for all    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   .  For example,    ⟨  B  ,  ∈  ⟩     B     \langle B,\in\rangle   is an end extension of    ⟨  A  ,  ∈  ⟩     A     \langle A,\in\rangle   if    A    A   A\,   and    B    B   B\,   are transitive sets , and    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   .
