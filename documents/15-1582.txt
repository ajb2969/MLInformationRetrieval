L-tryptophan—pyruvate aminotransferase

L-tryptophan---pyruvate aminotransferase (, TAA1 (gene), vt2 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name L-tryptophan:pyruvate aminotransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-tryptophan + pyruvate

 
  indole-3-pyruvate + L-alanine


This plant enzyme, along with EC 1.14.13.168, indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase, is responsible for the biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetate from L-tryptophan.
