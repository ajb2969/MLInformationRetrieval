   Spherical segment      Spherical segment   (Figure)  A spherical segment.   In geometry , a spherical segment is the solid defined by cutting a sphere with a pair of parallel planes .  It can be thought of as a spherical cap with the top truncated, and so it corresponds to a spherical frustum . The surface of the spherical segment (excluding the bases) is called spherical zone .  If the radius of the sphere is called R , the radius of the spherical segment bases r 1 and r 2 , and the height of the segment (the distance from one parallel plane to the other) called h , the volume of the spherical segment is then:      V  =     π  h   6    (    3   r  1  2    +   3   r  2  2    +   h  2    )        V        π  h   6       3   superscript   subscript  r  1   2      3   superscript   subscript  r  2   2     superscript  h  2       V=\frac{\pi h}{6}(3r_{1}^{2}+3r_{2}^{2}+h^{2})\,     The area of the spherical zone —which excludes the top and bottom bases— is given by:      A  =   2  π  R   h        A    2  π  R  h     A=2\pi Rh\,     See also   Spherical cap  Spherical wedge  Spherical sector   Reference   William F.
