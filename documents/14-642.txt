   Sum-of-squares optimization      Sum-of-squares optimization    This article deals with sum-of-squares constraints. For problems with sum-of-squares cost functions, see Least squares .    A sum-of-squares optimization program is an optimization problem with a linear cost function and a particular type of constraint on the decision variables. These constraints are of the form that when the decision variables are used as coefficients in certain polynomials , those polynomials should have the polynomial SOS property. Sum-of-squares optimization techniques have been successfully applied by researchers in the control engineering field. 1 2 3  Optimization problem  The problem can be expressed as       min   u  ∈    \R   n       c  T   u       subscript     u   superscript  \R  n        superscript  c  T   u     \min_{u\in\R^{n}}c^{T}u   subject to       a   k  ,  0     (  x  )   +   a   k  ,  1     (  x  )    u  1   +  ⋯  +   a   k  ,  n     (  x  )    u  n   ∈  SOS   (  k  =  1  ,  …  ,   N  s   )   .     fragments   subscript  a   k  0     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  a   k  1     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    subscript  u  1    normal-⋯    subscript  a   k  n     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    subscript  u  n    SOS    fragments  normal-(  k   1  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  N  s   normal-)   normal-.    a_{k,0}(x)+a_{k,1}(x)u_{1}+\cdots+a_{k,n}(x)u_{n}\in\text{SOS}\quad(k=1,\ldots%
 ,N_{s}).     Here "SOS" represents the class of SOS polynomials. The vector    c  ∈    \R   n       c   superscript  \R  n     c\in\R^{n}   and polynomials    {   a   k  ,  j    }      subscript  a   k  j      \{a_{k,j}\}   are given as part of the data for the optimization problem. The quantities    u  ∈    \R   n       u   superscript  \R  n     u\in\R^{n}   are the decision variables. SOS programs can be converted to semidefinite programs (SDPs) using the connection between SOS polynomials and positive-semidefinite matrices .  Sum-of-squares background  A polynomial   p   p   p   is a sum of squares ( SOS ) if there exist polynomials     {   f  i   }    i  =  1   m     superscript   subscript    subscript  f  i      i  1    m    \{f_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}   such that    p  =    ∑   i  =  1   m    f  i  2        p    superscript   subscript     i  1    m    superscript   subscript  f  i   2      p=\sum_{i=1}^{m}f_{i}^{2}   . For example,      p  =     x  2   -   4  x  y    +   7   y  2         p       superscript  x  2     4  x  y      7   superscript  y  2       p=x^{2}-4xy+7y^{2}   is a sum of squares since      p  =    f  1  2   +   f  2  2        p     superscript   subscript  f  1   2    superscript   subscript  f  2   2      p=f_{1}^{2}+f_{2}^{2}   where        f  1   =    (   x  -   2  y    )   and   f  2    =    3   y    .         subscript  f  1       x    2  y    and   subscript  f  2             3   y      f_{1}=(x-2y)\text{ and }f_{2}=\sqrt{3}y.   Note that if   p   p   p   is a sum of squares then     p   (  x  )    ≥  0        p  x   0    p(x)\geq 0   for all    x  ∈    \R   n       x   superscript  \R  n     x\in\R^{n}   . Detailed descriptions of polynomial SOS are available. 4 5 6  Quadratic forms can be expressed as     p   (  x  )    =    x  T   Q  x         p  x      superscript  x  T   Q  x     p(x)=x^{T}Qx   where   Q   Q   Q   is a symmetric matrix. Similarly, polynomials of degree ≤ 2 d can be expressed as        p   (  x  )    =   z    (  x  )   T   Q  z   (  x  )     ,        p  x     z   superscript  x  T   Q  z  x     p(x)=z(x)^{T}Qz(x),   where the vector   z   z   z   contains all monomials of degree     ≤  d      absent  d    \leq d   . This is known as the Gram matrix form. An important fact is that   p   p   p   is SOS if and only if there exists a symmetric and positive-semidefinite matrix    Q   Q   Q   such that     p   (  x  )    =   z    (  x  )   T   Q  z   (  x  )          p  x     z   superscript  x  T   Q  z  x     p(x)=z(x)^{T}Qz(x)   . This provides a connection between SOS polynomials and positive-semidefinite matrices.  Software tools   SOSTOOLS , licensed under the GNU GPL .
