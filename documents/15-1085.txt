(+)-Menthofuran synthase

(+)-Menthofuran synthase (, menthofuran synthase, (+)-pulegone 9-hydroxylase, (+)-MFS, cytochrome P450 menthofuran synthase) is an enzyme with system name (+)-pulegone,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (9-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(+)-pulegone + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  (+)-menthofuran + NADP+ + H2O
 

Menthofuran synthase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
