Splitting principle

In mathematics, the splitting principle is a technique used to reduce questions about vector bundles to the case of line bundles.
In the theory of vector bundles, one often wishes to simplify computations, say of Chern classes. Often computations are well understood for line bundles and for direct sums of line bundles. In this case the splitting principle can be quite useful.
The theorem above holds for complex vector bundles and integer coefficients or for real vector bundles with 
 
 
 
  coefficients. In the complex case, the line bundles 
 
 
 
  or their first characteristic classes are called Chern roots.
The fact that 
 
 
 
  is injective means that any equation which holds in 
 
 
 
  (say between various Chern classes) also holds in 
 
 
 
 .
The point is that these equations are easier to understand for direct sums of line bundles than for arbitrary vector bundles, so equations should be understood in 
 
 
 
  and then pushed down to 
 
 
 
 .
Symmetric polynomial
Under the splitting principle, characteristic classes for complex vector bundles correspond to symmetric polynomials in the first Chern classes of complex line bundles; these are the Chern classes.
