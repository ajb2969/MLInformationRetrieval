Representation in powers of 10 would be impractical (the number of digits in the exponent far exceeds the number of particles in the observable universe).  Mathematics:  TREE(3) : appears in relation to a theorem on trees in graph theory . Representation of the number is difficult, but one weak lower bound is A A (187196) (1), where A(n) is a version of the Ackermann function .

That makes 410 x 40 x 80 = 1,312,000 characters. The fifth paragraph tells us that "there are 25 orthographic symbols" including spaces and punctuation. The magnitude of the resulting number is found by taking logarithms. However, this calculation only gives a lower bound on the number of books as it does not take into account variations in the titles – the narrator does not specify a limit on the number of characters on the spine.
