   Frequency addition source of optical radiation      Frequency addition source of optical radiation   (Figure)  A 50W FASOR used at the Starfire Optical Range .   In physics , a FASOR is a frequency addition source of optical radiation , a device similar to a laser where the emitted light is produced in a sum-frequency generation process from two laser sources that operate at different wavelengths. The frequencies of the sources add directly to a summed frequency. Thus, if the source wavelengths are    λ  1     subscript  λ  1    \lambda_{1}   and    λ  2     subscript  λ  2    \lambda_{2}   , the resulting wavelength is       λ  =    (    1   λ  1    +   1   λ  2     )    -  1     .      λ   superscript      1   subscript  λ  1      1   subscript  λ  2       1      \lambda=\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_{1}}+\frac{1}{\lambda_{2}}\right)^{-1}.     Applications  The FASOR in the image is used for laser guide star experiments. It is tuned to the D2A hyperfine component of the sodium D line and used to excite sodium atoms in the mesospheric upper atmosphere . The FASOR consists of two single-frequency injection-locked Nd:YAG lasers close to 1064 and 1320 nm that are both resonant in a cavity containing a lithium triborate (LBO) crystal, which sums the frequencies yielding 589.158 nm light.
