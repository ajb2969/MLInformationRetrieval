In physics, a FASOR is a frequency addition source of optical radiation, a device similar to a laser where the emitted light is produced in a sum-frequency generation process from two laser sources that operate at different wavelengths. The frequencies of the sources add directly to a summed frequency. Thus, if the source wavelengths are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the resulting wavelength is



Applications
The FASOR in the image is used for laser guide star experiments. It is tuned to the D2A hyperfine component of the sodium D line and used to excite sodium atoms in the mesospheric upper atmosphere. The FASOR consists of two single-frequency injection-locked Nd:YAG lasers close to 1064 and 1320 nm that are both resonant in a cavity containing a lithium triborate (LBO) crystal, which sums the frequencies yielding 589.158 nm light.
