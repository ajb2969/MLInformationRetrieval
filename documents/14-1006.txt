Factor regression model

The factor regression model,1 or hybrid factor model,2 is a special multivariate model with the following form.


 
  where,


 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th 
 
 
 
  (known) observation.


 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th sample 
 
 
 
  (unknown) hidden factors.


 
  is the (unknown) loading matrix of the hidden factors.


 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th sample 
 
 
 
  (known) design factors.


 
  is the (unknown) regression coefficients of the design factors.


 
  is a vector of (unknown) constant term or intercept.


 
  is a vector of (unknown) errors, often white Gaussian noise.
Relationship between factor regression model, factor model and regression model
The factor regression model can be viewed as a combination of factor analysis model (
 
 
 
 ) and regression model (
 
 
 
 ).
Alternatively, the model can be viewed as a special kind of factor model, the hybrid factor model 3


 
 
  where, 
 
 
 
  is the loading matrix of the hybrid factor model and 
 
 
 
  are the factors, including the known factors and unknown factors.
