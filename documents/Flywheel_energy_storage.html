<p><strong>Flywheel energy storage</strong> (<strong>FES</strong>) works by accelerating a rotor (<a class="uri" href="flywheel" title="wikilink">flywheel</a>) to a very high speed and maintaining the energy in the system as <a href="rotational_energy" title="wikilink">rotational energy</a>. When energy is extracted from the system, the flywheel's rotational speed is reduced as a consequence of the principle of <a href="conservation_of_energy" title="wikilink">conservation of energy</a>; adding energy to the system correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.</p>

<p>Most FES systems use electricity to accelerate and decelerate the flywheel, but devices that directly use <a href="mechanical_energy" title="wikilink">mechanical energy</a> are being developed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Since FES can be used to absorb or release electrical energy such devices may sometimes be incorrectly and confusingly described as either mechanical or <a class="uri" href="inertia" title="wikilink">inertia</a> batteries <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Advanced FES systems have rotors made of high strength carbon-fiber composites, suspended by <a href="magnetic_bearing" title="wikilink">magnetic bearings</a>, and spinning at speeds from 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Such flywheels can come up to speed in a matter of minutes – reaching their energy capacity much more quickly than some other forms of storage.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> </p>
<h2 id="main-components">Main components</h2>

<p> A typical system consists of a rotor suspended by bearings inside a <a class="uri" href="vacuum" title="wikilink">vacuum</a> chamber to reduce friction, connected to a combination <a href="electric_motor" title="wikilink">electric motor</a> and <a href="electric_generator" title="wikilink">electric generator</a>.</p>

<p>First generation flywheel energy storage systems use a large <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> flywheel rotating on mechanical bearings. Newer systems use <a class="uri" href="carbon-fiber" title="wikilink">carbon-fiber</a> composite rotors that have a higher <a href="tensile_strength" title="wikilink">tensile strength</a> than steel and are an order of magnitude less heavy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Magnetic_bearing" title="wikilink">Magnetic bearings</a> are sometimes used instead of <a href="bearing_(mechanical)" title="wikilink">mechanical bearings</a>, to reduce <a class="uri" href="friction" title="wikilink">friction</a>.</p>
<h3 id="possible-future-use-of-superconducting-bearings">Possible future use of superconducting bearings</h3>

<p>The expense of refrigeration led to the early dismissal of low temperature superconductors for use in magnetic bearings. However, <a href="high-temperature_superconductivity" title="wikilink">high-temperature superconductor</a> (HTSC) bearings may be economical and could possibly extend the time energy could be stored economically. Hybrid bearing systems are most likely to see use first. High-temperature superconductor bearings have historically had problems providing the lifting forces necessary for the larger designs, but can easily provide a stabilizing force. Therefore, in hybrid bearings, permanent magnets support the load and high-temperature superconductors are used to stabilize it. The reason superconductors can work well stabilizing the load is because they are perfect <a href="diamagnet" title="wikilink">diamagnets</a>. If the rotor tries to drift off center, a restoring force due to <a href="flux_pinning" title="wikilink">flux pinning</a> restores it. This is known as the magnetic stiffness of the bearing. Rotational axis vibration can occur due to low stiffness and damping, which are inherent problems of superconducting magnets, preventing the use of completely superconducting magnetic bearings for flywheel applications.</p>

<p>Since flux pinning is the important factor for providing the stabilizing and lifting force, the HTSC can be made much more easily for FES than for other uses. HTSC powders can be formed into arbitrary shapes so long as flux pinning is strong. An ongoing challenge that has to be overcome before superconductors can provide the full lifting force for an FES system is finding a way to suppress the decrease of levitation force and the gradual fall of rotor during operation caused by the <a href="flux_creep" title="wikilink">flux creep</a> of SC material.</p>

<p>Compared with other ways to store electricity, FES systems have long lifetimes (lasting decades with little or no maintenance;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> full-cycle lifetimes quoted for flywheels range from in excess of 10<sup>5</sup>, up to 10<sup>7</sup>, cycles of use),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> high <a href="energy_density" title="wikilink">energy density</a> (100–130 W·h/kg, or 360–500 kJ/kg),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> and large maximum power output. The <a href="energy_conversion_efficiency" title="wikilink">energy efficiency</a> (<em>ratio of energy out per energy in</em>) of flywheels can be as high as 90%. Typical capacities range from 3 <a href="kilowatt_hour" title="wikilink">kWh</a> to 133 kWh.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Rapid charging of a system occurs in less than 15 minutes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The high energy densities often cited with flywheels can be a little misleading as commercial systems built have much lower energy density, for example 11 W·h/kg, or 40 kJ/kg.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="energy-density">Energy density</h3>

<p>The maximum <a href="energy_density" title="wikilink">energy density</a> of a flywheel rotor is mainly dependent on two factors, the first being the rotor's geometry, and the second being the properties of the material being used. For single-material, <a class="uri" href="isotropic" title="wikilink">isotropic</a> rotors this relationship can be expressed as<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<h4 id="material-properties">Material properties</h4>

<p>For energy storage purposes, materials with high strength, and low density are desirable. For this reason, composite materials are frequently being used in advanced flywheels. The strength-to-density ratio of a material can be expressed in the units [Wh/kg], and values greater than 400 Wh/kg can be achieved by certain composite materials.</p>
<h4 id="composite-rotors">Composite rotors</h4>

<p>Several modern flywheel rotors are made from composite materials. Examples include the <em>Smart Energy 25</em> flywheel from Beacon Power Corporation,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and the <em>PowerThru</em> flywheel from Phillips Service Industries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>For these rotors, the relationship between material properties, geometry and energy density can be expressed by using a weighed-average approach.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tensile-strength-and-failure-modes">Tensile strength and failure modes</h3>

<p>One of the primary limits to flywheel design is the tensile strength of the material used for the rotor. Generally speaking, the stronger the disc, the faster it may be spun, and the more energy the system can store.</p>

<p>When the tensile strength of a composite flywheel's outer binding cover is exceeded, the binding cover will fracture, followed by the wheel shattering as the outer wheel compression is lost around the entire circumference, releasing all of its stored energy at once; this is commonly referred to as "flywheel explosion" since wheel fragments can reach kinetic energy comparable to that of a bullet. Composite materials that are wound and glued in layers tend to disintegrate quickly, first into small-diameter filaments that entangle and slow each other, and then into red-hot powder, instead of large chunks of high-velocity shrapnel as can occur with a cast metal flywheel.</p>

<p>For a <a href="cast_metal" title="wikilink">cast metal</a> flywheel, the failure limit is the binding strength of the <a href="grain_boundaries" title="wikilink">grain boundaries</a> of the <a class="uri" href="polycrystalline" title="wikilink">polycrystalline</a> molded metal. Aluminum in particular suffers from <a href="Fatigue_(material)" title="wikilink">fatigue</a> and can develop <a href="microfracture" title="wikilink">microfractures</a> due to repeated low-energy stretching. Angular forces may cause portions of a metal flywheel to bend outward and begin dragging on the outer containment vessel, or to separate completely and bounce randomly around the interior. The rest of the flywheel is now severely unbalanced, which may lead to rapid bearing failure from vibration, and sudden shock fracturing of large segments of the flywheel.</p>

<p>Traditional flywheel systems require strong containment vessels as a safety precaution, which increases the total mass of the device. The energy release from failure can be dampened with a gelatinous or encapsulated liquid inner housing lining, which will boil and absorb the energy of destruction. Still, many customers of large-scale flywheel energy-storage systems prefer to have them embedded in the ground to halt any material that might escape the containment vessel.</p>
<h3 id="energy-storage-efficiency">Energy storage efficiency</h3>

<p>Flywheel energy storage systems using mechanical bearings can lose 20% to 50% of their energy in two hours.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Much of the friction responsible for this energy loss results from the flywheel changing orientation due to the rotation of the earth (an effect similar to that shown by a <a href="Foucault_pendulum" title="wikilink">Foucault pendulum</a>). This change in orientation is resisted by the gyroscopic forces exerted by the flywheel's angular momentum, thus exerting a force against the mechanical bearings. This force increases friction. This can be avoided by aligning the flywheel's axis of rotation parallel to that of the earth's axis of rotation.</p>

<p>Conversely, flywheels with <a href="magnetic_bearings" title="wikilink">magnetic bearings</a> and high vacuum can maintain 97% <a href="mechanical_efficiency" title="wikilink">mechanical efficiency</a>, and 85% round trip efficiency.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="effects-of-angular-momentum-in-vehicles">Effects of angular momentum in vehicles</h3>

<p>When used in vehicles, flywheels also act as <a href="gyroscope" title="wikilink">gyroscopes</a>, since their <a href="angular_momentum" title="wikilink">angular momentum</a> is typically of a similar order of magnitude as the forces acting on the moving vehicle. This property may be detrimental to the vehicle's handling characteristics while turning or driving on rough ground; driving onto the side of a sloped embankment may cause wheels to partially lift off the ground as the flywheel opposes sideways tilting forces. On the other hand, this property could be utilized to keep the car balanced so as to keep it from rolling over during sharp turns.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>When a flywheel is used entirely for its effects on the attitude of a vehicle, rather than for energy storage, it is called a <a href="reaction_wheel" title="wikilink">reaction wheel</a> or a <a href="control_moment_gyroscope" title="wikilink">control moment gyroscope</a>.</p>

<p>The resistance of angular tilting can be almost completely removed by mounting the flywheel within an appropriately applied set of <a href="gimbal" title="wikilink">gimbals</a>, allowing the flywheel to retain its original orientation without affecting the vehicle (see <a href="gyroscope#Properties" title="wikilink"><em>Properties</em> of a gyroscope</a>). This doesn't avoid the complication of <a href="gimbal_lock" title="wikilink">gimbal lock</a>, and so a compromise between the number of gimbals and the angular freedom is needed.</p>

<p>The center axle of the flywheel acts as a single gimbal, and if aligned vertically, allows for the 360 degrees of yaw in a horizontal plane. However, for instance driving up-hill requires a second pitch gimbal, and driving on the side of a sloped embankment requires a third roll gimbal.</p>
<h4 id="full-motion-gimbals">Full-motion gimbals</h4>

<p>Although the flywheel itself may be of a flat ring shape, a free-movement gimbal mounting inside a vehicle requires a spherical volume for the flywheel to freely rotate within. Left to its own, a spinning flywheel in a vehicle would slowly precess following the Earth's rotation, and precess further yet in vehicles that travel long distances over the Earth's curved spherical surface.</p>

<p>A full-motion gimbal has additional problems of how to communicate power into and out of the flywheel, since the flywheel could potentially flip completely over once a day, precessing as the Earth rotates. Full free rotation would require <a href="slip_ring" title="wikilink">slip rings</a> around each gimbal axis for power conductors, further adding to the design complexity.</p>
<h4 id="limited-motion-gimbals">Limited-motion gimbals</h4>

<p>To reduce space usage, the gimbal system may be of a limited-movement design, using shock absorbers to cushion sudden rapid motions within a certain number of degrees of out-of-plane angular rotation, and then gradually forcing the flywheel to adopt the vehicle's current orientation. This reduces the gimbal movement space around a ring-shaped flywheel from a full sphere, to a short thickened cylinder, encompassing for example ± 30 degrees of pitch and ± 30 degrees of roll in all directions around the flywheel.</p>
<h4 id="counterbalancing-of-angular-momentum">Counterbalancing of angular momentum</h4>

<p>An alternative solution to the problem is to have two joined flywheels spinning synchronously in opposite directions. They would have a total angular momentum of zero and no gyroscopic effect. A problem with this solution is that when the difference between the momentum of each flywheel is anything other than zero the housing of the two flywheels would exhibit torque. Both wheels must be maintained at the same speed to keep the angular velocity at zero. Strictly speaking, the two flywheels would exert a huge <a href="torque" title="wikilink">torqueing</a> moment at the central point, trying to bend the axle. However, if the axle were sufficiently strong, no gyroscopic forces would have a net effect on the sealed container, so no torque would be noticed.</p>

<p>To further balance the forces and spread out strain, a single large flywheel can be balanced by two half-size flywheels on each side, or the flywheels can be reduced in size to be a series of alternating layers spinning in opposite directions. However this increases housing and bearing complexity.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, flywheel-powered buses, known as <a href="gyrobus" title="wikilink">gyrobuses</a>, were used in <a class="uri" href="Yverdon" title="wikilink">Yverdon</a> (<a class="uri" href="Switzerland" title="wikilink">Switzerland</a>) and <a class="uri" href="Ghent" title="wikilink">Ghent</a> (<a class="uri" href="Belgium" title="wikilink">Belgium</a>) and there is ongoing research to make flywheel systems that are smaller, lighter, cheaper and have a greater capacity. It is hoped that flywheel systems can replace conventional chemical batteries for mobile applications, such as for electric vehicles. Proposed flywheel systems would eliminate many of the disadvantages of existing battery power systems, such as low capacity, long charge times, heavy weight and short usable lifetimes. Flywheels may have been used in the experimental <a href="Chrysler_Patriot" title="wikilink">Chrysler Patriot</a>, though that has been disputed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

The ,  <a href="carbon_fiber" title="wikilink">carbon fiber</a> flywheel spins in a vacuum to eliminate friction. When partnered with a four-cylinder engine, it offers up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption versus a comparably performing turbo six-cylinder, providing an 80 hp boost and allowing it to reach  in 5.5 seconds.

<p>Flywheel power storage systems in production  have storage capacities comparable to batteries and faster discharge rates. They are mainly used to provide load leveling for large battery systems, such as an <a href="uninterruptible_power_supply" title="wikilink">uninterruptible power supply</a> for data centers as they save a considerable amount of space compared to battery systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Flywheel maintenance in general runs about one-half the cost of traditional battery UPS systems. The only maintenance is a basic annual preventive maintenance routine and replacing the bearings every five to ten years, which takes about four hours.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> Newer flywheel systems completely levitate the spinning mass using maintenance-free <a href="magnetic_bearing" title="wikilink">magnetic bearings</a>, thus eliminating mechanical bearing maintenance and failures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>

<p>Costs of a fully installed flywheel UPS are about $330 per <a class="uri" href="kilowatt" title="wikilink">kilowatt</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> In combination with a diesel generator set or integrated design, it supplies continuous power as long as there is fuel.</p>
<h3 id="laboratories">Laboratories</h3>

<p>A long-standing niche market for flywheel power systems are facilities where circuit-breakers and similar devices are tested: even a small household circuit-breaker may be rated to interrupt a current of 10,000 or more amperes, and larger units may have <a href="breaking_capacity" title="wikilink">interrupting ratings</a> of 100,000 or 1,000,000 amperes. The enormous transient loads produced by deliberately forcing such devices to demonstrate their ability to interrupt simulated short circuits would have unacceptable effects on the local grid if these tests were done directly from building power. Typically such a laboratory will have several large motor-generator sets, which can be spun up to speed over some minutes; then the motor is disconnected before a circuit breaker is tested.</p>

<p>Other similar high power applications are in <a class="uri" href="tokamak" title="wikilink">tokamak</a> fusion (like the <a href="Joint_European_Torus" title="wikilink">Joint European Torus</a>) and <a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a> experiments, where very high currents are also used for very brief intervals. JET has two 775 ton flywheels that spin up to 225 rpm. Each flywheel stores 3 GJ.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

The shipboard power system cannot on its own supply the high power transients necessary to launch aircraft. Each of four rotors will store 121 MJ at 6400 rpm. They can store 122 MJ in 45 secs and release it in 2–3 seconds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> The flywheel energy densities are 28 kJ/kg; including the stators and cases this comes down to 18.1 kJ/kg, excluding the torque frame.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nasa-g2-flywheel-for-spacecraft-energy-storage">NASA G2 flywheel for spacecraft energy storage</h3>

<p>This was a design funded by <a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a>'s Glenn Research Center and intended for component testing in a laboratory environment. it used a carbon fiber rim with a titanium hub designed to spin at 60,000 rpm, mounted on magnetic bearings.

<p>The <a href="Incredible_Hulk_Coaster" title="wikilink">Incredible Hulk roller coaster</a> at <a href="Islands_of_Adventure" title="wikilink">Universal's Islands of Adventure</a> features a rapidly accelerating uphill launch as opposed to the typical gravity drop. This is achieved through powerful <a href="traction_motor" title="wikilink">traction motors</a> that throw the car up the track. To achieve the brief very high current required to accelerate a full coaster train to full speed uphill, the park utilizes several motor generator sets with large flywheels. Without these stored energy units, the park would have to invest in a new substation or risk <a href="Brownout_(electricity)" title="wikilink">browning-out</a> the local energy grid every time the ride launches.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-power">Pulse power</h3>

<p>Since FES can store and release energy quickly, they have found a niche providing pulsed power (see <a class="uri" href="compulsator" title="wikilink">compulsator</a>).</p>
<h3 id="motor-sports">Motor sports</h3>

<p> Using a <a href="continuously_variable_transmission" title="wikilink">continuously variable transmission</a> (CVT), energy is recovered from the drive train during braking and stored in a flywheel.

<p><a href="Friction_motor" title="wikilink">Friction motors</a> used to power many <a href="toy_car" title="wikilink">toy cars</a>, trucks, trains, action toys and such, are simple flywheel motors.</p>
<h3 id="toggle-action-presses">Toggle action presses</h3>

<p>In industry, <a href="toggle_action_press" title="wikilink">toggle action presses</a> are still popular. The usual arrangement involves a very strong <a class="uri" href="crankshaft" title="wikilink">crankshaft</a> and a heavy duty connecting rod which drives the press. Large and heavy flywheels are driven by electric motors but the flywheels only turn the crankshaft when clutches are activated.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-batteries">Comparison to batteries</h2>

<p>Flywheels are not as adversely affected by temperature changes, can operate at a much wider temperature range, and are not subject to many of the common failures of chemical <a href="rechargeable_battery" title="wikilink">rechargeable batteries</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> They are also less potentially damaging to the environment, being largely made of <a class="uri" href="inert" title="wikilink">inert</a> or benign materials. Another advantage of flywheels is that by a simple measurement of the rotation speed it is possible to know the exact amount of energy stored.</p>

<p>Unlike most batteries which only operate for a finite period (for example roughly 36 months in the case of <a href="lithium_ion_polymer_batteries" title="wikilink">lithium ion polymer batteries</a>), a flywheel potentially has an indefinite working lifespan. Flywheels built as part of <a href="James_Watt" title="wikilink">James Watt</a> <a href="steam_engines" title="wikilink">steam engines</a> have been continuously working for more than two hundred years.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Working examples of ancient flywheels used mainly in milling and pottery can be found in many locations in Africa, Asia, and Europe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>Most modern batteries are typically a sealed device that needs minimal maintenance throughout its service life. Magnetic bearing flywheels in a vacuum enclosure, such as the NASA model depicted above, do not need any bearing maintenance and are therefore superior to batteries both in terms of total lifetime and energy storage capacity. Flywheel systems with mechanical bearings will have a limited lifespan due to wear.</p>

<p>The arrangement of batteries can be designed to a wide variety of configurations, whereas a flywheel at a minimum must occupy a square surface area. Where space is a constraint for the application of energy storage (e.g. under trains in tunnels) the flywheel may not be a valid application.</p>
