Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase

In enzymology, a gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(5-L-glutamyl)-L-amino acid 
 
 
 
  5-oxoproline + L-amino acid
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (5-L-glutamyl)-L-amino acid, and two products, 5-oxoproline and L-amino acid.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the aminoacyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5-L-glutamyl)-L-amino-acid 5-glutamyltransferase (cyclizing). Other names in common use include gamma-glutamyl-amino acid cyclotransferase, gamma-L-glutamylcyclotransferase, and L-glutamic cyclase. This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
