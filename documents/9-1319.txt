Céa's lemma

Céa's lemma is a lemma in mathematics. It is an important tool for proving error estimates for the finite element method applied to elliptic partial differential equations.
Lemma statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a real Hilbert space with the norm

 
  Let 
 
 
 
  be a bilinear form with the properties



 
  for some constant 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  (continuity)




 
  for some constant 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  (coercivity or 
 
 
 
 -ellipticity).

Let 
 
 
 
  be a bounded linear operator. Consider the problem of finding an element 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

Consider the same problem on a finite-dimensional subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  so, 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  satisfies


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

By the Lax–Milgram theorem, each of these problems has exactly one solution. Céa's lemma states that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

That is to say, the subspace solution 
 
 
 
  is "the best" approximation of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
up to the constant 
 
 

The proof is straightforward


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  We used the 
 
 
 
 -orthogonality of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 



 
  in 
 
 
 
  which follows directly from 
 
 



 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Note: Céa's lemma holds on complex Hilbert spaces also, one then uses a sesquilinear form

 
  instead of a bilinear one. The coercivity assumption then becomes 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  (notice the absolute value sign around 
 
 
 
 ).
Error estimate in the energy norm
 In many applications, the bilinear form 
 
 
 
  is symmetric, so


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

This, together with the above properties of this form, implies that 
 
 
 
  is an inner product on 
 
 
 
  The resulting norm



is called the energy norm, since it corresponds to a physical energy in many problems. This norm is equivalent to the original norm 
 
 

Using the 
 
 
 
 -orthogonality of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Hence, in the energy norm, the inequality in Céa's lemma becomes


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

(notice that the constant 
 
 
 
 
  on the right-hand side is no longer present).
This states that the subspace solution 
 
 
 
  is the best approximation to the full-space solution 
 
 
 
  in respect to the energy norm. Geometrically, this means that 
 
 
 
  is the projection of the solution 
 
 
 
  onto the subspace 
 
 
 
 
  in respect to the inner product 
 
 
 
  (see the picture on the right).
Using this result, one can also derive a sharper estimate in the norm 
 
 
 
 . Since


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 , it follows that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
An application of Céa's lemma
We will apply Céa's lemma to estimate the error of calculating the solution to an elliptic differential equation by the finite element method.
 Consider the problem of finding a function 
 
 
 
  satisfying the conditions


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a given continuous function.
Physically, the solution 
 
 
 
  to this two-point boundary value problem represents the shape taken by a string under the influence of a force such that at every point 
 
 
 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the force density is 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is a unit vector pointing vertically, while the endpoints of the string are on a horizontal line, see the picture on the right). For example, that force may be the gravity, when 
 
 
 
  is a constant function (since the gravitational force is the same at all points).
Let the Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  be the Sobolev space

 
  which is the space of all square integrable functions

 
  defined on 
 
 
 
  that have a weak derivative on 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  also being square integrable, and 
 
 
 
  satisfies the conditions 
 
 
 
  The inner product on this space is


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

After multiplying the original boundary value problem by 
 
 
 
  in this space and performing an integration by parts, one obtains the equivalent problem


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

with



(here the bilinear form is given by the same expression as the inner product, this is not always the case), and



It can be shown that the bilinear form 
 
 
 
  and the operator 
 
 
 
  satisfy the assumptions of Céa's lemma.
 In order to determine a finite-dimensional subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  consider a partition



of the interval 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be the space of all continuous functions that are affine on each subinterval in the partition (such functions are called piecewise-linear). In addition, assume that any function in 
 
 
 
  takes the value 0 at the endpoints of 
 
 
 
  It follows that 
 
 
 
  is a vector subspace of 
 
 
 
  whose dimension is 
 
 
 
  (the number of points in the partition that are not endpoints).
Let 
 
 
 
  be the solution to the subspace problem


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

so one can think of 
 
 
 
  as of a piecewise-linear approximation to the exact solution 
 
 
 
  By Céa's lemma, there exists a constant 
 
 
 
  dependent only on the bilinear form 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

To explicitly calculate the error between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  consider the function 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  that has the same values as 
 
 
 
  at the nodes of the partition (so 
 
 
 
  is obtained by linear interpolation on each interval 
 
 
 
  from the values of 
 
 
 
  at interval's endpoints). It can be shown using Taylor's theorem that there exists a constant 
 
 
 
  that depends only on the endpoints 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that



for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the largest length of the subintervals 
 
 
 
  in the partition, and the norm on the right-hand side is the L2 norm.
This inequality then yields an estimate for the error



Then, by substituting 
 
 
 
  in Céa's lemma it follows that



where 
 
 
 
  is a different constant from the above (it depends only on the bilinear form, which implicitly depends on the interval 
 
 
 
 ).
This result is of a fundamental importance, as it states that the finite element method can be used to approximately calculate the solution of our problem, and that the error in the computed solution decreases proportionately to the partition size 
 
 
 
  Céa's lemma can be applied along the same lines to derive error estimates for finite element problems in higher dimensions (here the domain of 
 
 
 
  was in one dimension), and while using higher order polynomials for the subspace
