   Nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase      Nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + nonpolar amino acidout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + nonpolar amino acidin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and nonpolar amino acid , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and nonpolar amino acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting) .  References       "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
