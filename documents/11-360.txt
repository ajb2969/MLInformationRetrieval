Nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase




Nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + nonpolar amino acidout 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + nonpolar amino acidin
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and nonpolar amino acid, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and nonpolar amino acid.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (nonpolar-amino-acid-transporting).
