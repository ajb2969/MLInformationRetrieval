   Böttcher's equation      Böttcher's equation   Böttcher's equation , named after Lucjan Böttcher , is the functional equation          F   (   h   (  z  )    )    =     (   F   (  z  )    )   n     ,        F    h  z     superscript    F  z   n     F(h(z))=(F(z))^{n}~{},        where      h   h   h   is a given analytic function with a superattracting fixed point of order   n   n   n   at   a   a   a   , (that is,      h   (  z  )    =   a  +   c    (   z  -  a   )   n    +   O   (    (   z  -  a   )    n  +  1    )      ,        h  z     a    c   superscript    z  a   n      O   superscript    z  a     n  1        h(z)=a+c(z-a)^{n}+O((z-a)^{n+1})~{},   in a neighbourhood of   a   a   a   ), with n ≥ 2     F   F   F   is a sought function.   The logarithm of this functional equation amounts to Schröder's equation .  Solution  Lucian Emil Böttcher sketched a proof in 1904 on the existence of an analytic solution F in a neighborhood of the fixed point a , such that F ( a ) = 0. 1 This solution is sometimes called the Böttcher coordinate . (The complete proof was published by Joseph Ritt in 1920, 2 who was unaware of the original formulation. 3 )  Böttcher's coordinate (the logarithm of the Schröder function ) conjugates    h   (  z  )       h  z    h(z)   in a neighbourhood of the fixed point to the function . An especially important case is when    h   (  z  )       h  z    h(z)   is a polynomial of degree   n   n   n   , and   a   a   a   = ∞ . 4  Applications  Böttcher's equation plays a fundamental role in the part of holomorphic dynamics which studies iteration of polynomials of one complex variable .  Global properties of the Böttcher coordinate were studied by Fatou  5 and Douady and Hubbard . 6  See also   Schröder's equation  External ray   References    "  Category:Functional equations     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ; ; ↩  ; ↩
