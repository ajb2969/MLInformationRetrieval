   Classical Wiener space      Classical Wiener space   (Figure)  Norbert Wiener   In mathematics , classical Wiener space is the collection of all continuous functions on a given domain (usually a sub- interval of the real line ), taking values in a metric space (usually n -dimensional Euclidean space ). Classical Wiener space is useful in the study of stochastic processes whose sample paths are continuous functions. It is named after the American  mathematician  Norbert Wiener .  Definition  Consider E ⊆ R n and a metric space ( M , d ). The classical Wiener space  C ( E ; M ) is the space of all continuous functions f : E → M . I.e. for every fixed t in E ,       d   (   f   (  s  )    ,   f   (  t  )    )    →  0     normal-→    d     f  s     f  t     0    d(f(s),f(t))\to 0   as     |   s  -  t   |   →  0.     normal-→      s  t    0.    |s-t|\to 0.     In almost all applications, one takes E = [0, T ] or [0, +∞) and M = R n for some n in N . For brevity, write C for C ([0, T ]; R n ); this is a vector space . Write C 0 for the linear subspace consisting only of those functions that take the value zero at the infimum of the set E . Many authors refer to C 0 as "classical Wiener space".  Properties of classical Wiener space  Uniform topology  The vector space C can be equipped with the uniform norm       ∥  f  ∥   :=    sup   t  ∈   [  0  ,  T  ]      |   f   (  t  )    |       assign   norm  f     subscript  supremum    t   0  T         f  t       \|f\|:=\sup_{t\in[0,T]}|f(t)|     turning it into a normed vector space (in fact a Banach space ). This norm induces a metric on C in the usual way     d   (  f  ,  g  )    :=   ∥   f  -  g   ∥      assign    d   f  g     norm    f  g      d(f,g):=\|f-g\|   . The topology generated by the open sets in this metric is the topology of uniform convergence on [0, T ], or the uniform topology .  Thinking of the domain [0, T ] as "time" and the range R n as "space", an intuitive view of the uniform topology is that two functions are "close" if we can "wiggle space a bit" and get the graph of f to lie on top of the graph of g , while leaving time fixed. Contrast this with the Skorokhod topology , which allows us to "wiggle" both space and time.  Separability and completeness  With respect to the uniform metric, C is both a separable and a complete space :   separability is a consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem ;  completeness is a consequence of the fact that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions is itself continuous.   Since it is both separable and complete, C is a Polish space .  Tightness in classical Wiener space  Recall that the modulus of continuity for a function f : [0, T ] → R n is defined by         ω  f    (  δ  )    :=   sup   {   |    f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )     |   |     s  ,  t   ∈   [  0  ,  T  ]    ,    |   s  -  t   |   ≤  δ    }     .     assign     subscript  ω  f   δ    supremum   conditional-set        f  s     f  t      formulae-sequence     s  t    0  T          s  t    δ        \omega_{f}(\delta):=\sup\left\{|f(s)-f(t)|\left|s,t\in[0,T],|s-t|\leq\delta%
 \right.\right\}.     This definition makes sense even if f is not continuous, and it can be shown that f is continuous if and only if its modulus of continuity tends to zero as δ → 0:       f  ∈  C   ⇔     ω  f    (  δ  )    →  0      iff    f  C    normal-→     subscript  ω  f   δ   0     f\in C\iff\omega_{f}(\delta)\to 0   as δ → 0.  By an application of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem , one can show that a sequence     (   μ  n   )    n  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript   subscript  μ  n     n  1       (\mu_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}   of probability measures on classical Wiener space C is tight if and only if both the following conditions are met:         lim   a  →  ∞      lim sup   n  →  ∞      μ  n    {   f  ∈  C   |    |   f   (  0  )    |   ≥  a   }      =  0   ,        subscript    normal-→  a       subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  μ  n    conditional-set    f  C         f  0    a       0    \lim_{a\to\infty}\limsup_{n\to\infty}\mu_{n}\{f\in C||f(0)|\geq a\}=0,   and        lim   δ  →  0      lim sup   n  →  ∞      μ  n    {   f  ∈  C   |     ω  f    (  δ  )    ≥  ε   }      =  0        subscript    normal-→  δ  0      subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  μ  n    conditional-set    f  C        subscript  ω  f   δ   ε       0    \lim_{\delta\to 0}\limsup_{n\to\infty}\mu_{n}\{f\in C|\omega_{f}(\delta)\geq%
 \varepsilon\}=0   for all ε > 0.  Classical Wiener measure  There is a "standard" measure on C 0 , known as classical Wiener measure (or simply Wiener measure ). Wiener measure has (at least) two equivalent characterizations:  If one defines Brownian motion to be a Markov  stochastic process  B : [0, T ] × Ω → R n , starting at the origin, with almost surely continuous paths and independent increments         B  t   -   B  s    ∼   Normal   (  0  ,   |   t  -  s   |   )     ,     similar-to     subscript  B  t    subscript  B  s      Normal   0      t  s        B_{t}-B_{s}\sim\mathrm{Normal}\left(0,|t-s|\right),     then classical Wiener measure γ is the law of the process B .  Alternatively, one may use the abstract Wiener space construction, in which classical Wiener measure γ is the radonification of the canonical Gaussian cylinder set measure on the Cameron-Martin Hilbert space corresponding to C 0 .  Classical Wiener measure is a Gaussian measure : in particular, it is a strictly positive probability measure.  Given classical Wiener measure γ on C 0 , the product measure γ n × γ is a probability measure on C , where γ n denotes the standard Gaussian measure on R n .
