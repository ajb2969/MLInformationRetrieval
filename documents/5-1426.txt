Guanidine nitrate

Guanidine nitrate is the chemical compound with the formula [C(NH2)3]NO3. It is a colorless, water-soluble salt. It is produced on a large scale as high energy fuel used as gas generator and solid rocket propellant applications. Its more official name is guanidinium nitrate, but the incorrect term guanidine nitrate is widely used.
Production and properties
Although it is the salt formed by neutralizing guanidine with nitric acid, guanidine nitrate is produced industrially by the reaction of dicyandiamide (or calcium salt) and ammonium nitrate.1
It has been used as a monopropellant in the Jetex engine for model airplanes. It is attractive because it has a high gas output and low flame temperature. It has a relatively high monopropellant specific impulse of 177 seconds (
 
 
 
 ).2
Safety
The compound is hazardous substance, being an explosive and containing an oxidant (nitrate). It is also harmful to the eyes, skin, and inhalation.3
