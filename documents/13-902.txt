Inverse bundle

In mathematics, the inverse bundle of a fibre bundle is its inverse with respect to the Whitney sum operation.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a fibre bundle. A bundle 
 
 
 
  is called the inverse bundle of 
 
 
 
  if their Whitney sum is a trivial bundle, namely if



Any vector bundle over a compact Hausdorff base has an inverse bundle.
