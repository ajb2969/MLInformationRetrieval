Boole's rule

In mathematics, Boole's rule, named after George Boole, is a method of numerical integration. It approximates an integral



by using the values of ƒ at five equally spaced points



It is expressed thus in Abramowitz and Stegun (1972, p. 886):



and the error term is



for some number c between x1 and x5. (945 = 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9.)
It is often known as Bode's rule, due to a typographical error that propagated; e.g. in Abramowitz and Stegun (1972, p. 886).1
