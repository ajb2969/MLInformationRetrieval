   Dual of BCH is an independent source      Dual of BCH is an independent source   A certain family of BCH codes have a particularly useful property, which is that treated as linear operators , their dual operators turns their input into an   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   -wise independent source . That is, the set of vectors from the input vector space are mapped to an   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   -wise independent source. The proof of this fact below as the following Lemma and Corollary is useful in derandomizing the algorithm for a    1  -   2   -  ℓ        1   superscript  2    normal-ℓ      1-2^{-\ell}   -approximation to MAXEkSAT .  Lemma  Let    C  ⊆   F  2  n       C   superscript   subscript  F  2   n     C\subseteq F_{2}^{n}   be a linear code such that    C  ⟂     superscript  C  perpendicular-to    C^{\perp}   has distance greater than    ℓ  +  1      normal-ℓ  1    \ell+1   . Then   C   C   C   is an   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   -wise independent source.  Proof of Lemma  It is sufficient to show that given any    k  ×  l      k  l    k\times l   matrix M , where k is greater than or equal to l , such that the rank of M is l , for all    x  ∈   F  2  k       x   superscript   subscript  F  2   k     x\in F_{2}^{k}   ,    x  M      x  M    xM   takes every value in    F  2  l     superscript   subscript  F  2   l    F_{2}^{l}   the same number of times.  Since M has rank l , we can write M as two matrices of the same size,    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   and    M  2     subscript  M  2    M_{2}   , where    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   has rank equal to l . This means that    x  M      x  M    xM   can be rewritten as      x  1    M  1    +    x  2    M  2           subscript  x  1    subscript  M  1       subscript  x  2    subscript  M  2      x_{1}M_{1}+x_{2}M_{2}   for some    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   and    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   .  If we consider M written with respect to a basis where the first l rows are the identity matrix, then    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   has zeros wherever    M  2     subscript  M  2    M_{2}   has nonzero rows, and    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   has zeros wherever    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   has nonzero rows.  Now any value y , where    y  =   x  M       y    x  M     y=xM   , can be written as      x  1    M  1    +    x  2    M  2           subscript  x  1    subscript  M  1       subscript  x  2    subscript  M  2      x_{1}M_{1}+x_{2}M_{2}   for some vectors     x  1   ,   x  2       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     x_{1},x_{2}   .  We can rewrite this as:        x  1    M  1    =   y  -    x  2    M  2            subscript  x  1    subscript  M  1      y     subscript  x  2    subscript  M  2       x_{1}M_{1}=y-x_{2}M_{2}     Fixing the value of the last    k  -  l      k  l    k-l   coordinates of     x  2   ∈   F  2  k        subscript  x  2    superscript   subscript  F  2   k     x_{2}\in F_{2}^{k}   (note that there are exactly    2   k  -  l      superscript  2    k  l     2^{k-l}   such choices), we can rewrite this equation again as:        x  1    M  1    =  b         subscript  x  1    subscript  M  1    b    x_{1}M_{1}=b   for some b .  Since    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   has rank equal to l , there is exactly one solution    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   , so the total number of solutions is exactly    2   k  -  l      superscript  2    k  l     2^{k-l}   , proving the lemma.  Corollary  Recall that BCH 2, m , d is an     [  n  =   2  m   ,  n  -  1  -   ⌈  d  -  2  /  2  ⌉   m  ,  d  ]   2     subscript   fragments  normal-[  n    superscript  2  m   normal-,  n   1    fragments  normal-⌈  d   2   2  normal-⌉   m  normal-,  d  normal-]   2    [n=2^{m},n-1-\lceil{d-2}/2\rceil m,d]_{2}   linear code.  Let    C  ⟂     superscript  C  perpendicular-to    C^{\perp}   be BCH 2,log n , ℓ +1 . Then   C   C   C   is an   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   -wise independent source of size    O   (   n   ⌊   ℓ  /  2   ⌋    )       O   superscript  n      normal-ℓ  2       O(n^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor})   .  Proof of Corollary  The dimension d of C is just      ⌈    (    ℓ  +  1   -  2   )   /  2   ⌉    log  n    +  1                normal-ℓ  1   2   2      n    1    \lceil{(\ell+1-2)/{2}}\rceil\log n+1   . So    d  =     ⌈    (   ℓ  -  1   )   /  2   ⌉    log  n    +  1   =     ⌊   ℓ  /  2   ⌋    log  n    +  1         d            normal-ℓ  1   2      n    1                normal-ℓ  2      n    1      d=\lceil{(\ell-1)}/2\rceil\log n+1=\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor\log n+1   .  So the cardinality of   C   C   C   considered as a set is just     2  d   =   O   (   n   ⌊   ℓ  /  2   ⌋    )         superscript  2  d     O   superscript  n      normal-ℓ  2        2^{d}=O(n^{\lfloor\ell/2\rfloor})   , proving the Corollary.
