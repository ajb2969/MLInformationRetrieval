Dual of BCH is an independent source




Dual of BCH is an independent source

A certain family of BCH codes have a particularly useful property, which is that treated as linear operators, their dual operators turns their input into an 
 
 
 
 -wise independent source. That is, the set of vectors from the input vector space are mapped to an 
 
 
 
 -wise independent source. The proof of this fact below as the following Lemma and Corollary is useful in derandomizing the algorithm for a 
 
 
 
 -approximation to MAXEkSAT.
Lemma
Let 
 
 
 
  be a linear code such that 
 
 
 
  has distance greater than 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -wise independent source.
Proof of Lemma
It is sufficient to show that given any 
 
 
 
  matrix M, where k is greater than or equal to l, such that the rank of M is l, for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  takes every value in 
 
 
 
  the same number of times.
Since M has rank l, we can write M as two matrices of the same size, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  has rank equal to l. This means that 
 
 
 
  can be rewritten as 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If we consider M written with respect to a basis where the first l rows are the identity matrix, then 
 
 
 
  has zeros wherever 
 
 
 
  has nonzero rows, and 
 
 
 
  has zeros wherever 
 
 
 
  has nonzero rows.
Now any value y, where 
 
 
 
 , can be written as 
 
 
 
  for some vectors 
 
 
 
 .
We can rewrite this as:



Fixing the value of the last 
 
 
 
  coordinates of 
 
 
 
  (note that there are exactly 
 
 
 
  such choices), we can rewrite this equation again as:


 
  for some b.
Since 
 
 
 
  has rank equal to l, there is exactly one solution 
 
 
 
 , so the total number of solutions is exactly 
 
 
 
 , proving the lemma.
Corollary
Recall that BCH2,m,d is an 
 
 
 
  linear code.
Let 
 
 
 
  be BCH2,log n,ℓ+1. Then 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -wise independent source of size 
 
 
 
 .
Proof of Corollary
The dimension d of C is just 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
 .
So the cardinality of 
 
 
 
  considered as a set is just 
 
 
 
 , proving the Corollary.
