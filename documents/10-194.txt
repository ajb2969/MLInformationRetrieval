   Stengle's Positivstellensatz      Stengle's Positivstellensatz   In real  semialgebraic geometry , Stengle's (German for "positive-locus-theorem" – see Satz ) characterizes polynomials that are positive on a semialgebraic set , which is defined by systems of inequalities of polynomials with real coefficients, or more generally, coefficients from any real closed field .  It can be thought of as an ordered analogue of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz . It was proved by Jean-Louis Krivine and then rediscovered by Gilbert Stengle .  Statement  Let  be a real closed field , and  a finite set of polynomials over  in  variables. Let  be the semialgebraic set       W  =   {   x  ∈   R  n    ∣    ∀  f   ∈    F   f   (  x  )    ≥  0   }    ,      W   conditional-set    x   superscript  R  n         for-all  f     F  f  x        0       W=\{x\in R^{n}\mid\forall f\in F\,f(x)\geq 0\},   and let  be the cone generated by  (i.e., the subsemiring of [ 1 ,…, ] generated by  and arbitrary squares). Let  ∈ [ 1 ,…, ] be a polynomial. Then       ∀  x   ∈    W   p   (  x  )    >  0         for-all  x     W  p  x        0     \forall x\in W\;p(x)>0   if and only if      ∃   f  1    ,   f  2    ∈    C   p   f  1    =   1  +   f  2              subscript  f  1     subscript  f  2      C  p   subscript  f  1           1   subscript  f  2       \exists f_{1},f_{2}\in C\;pf_{1}=1+f_{2}   .  The weak is the following variant of the . Let  be a real-closed field, and , , and  finite subsets of [ 1 ,…, ]. Let  be the cone generated by , and  the ideal generated by . Then       {   x  ∈   R  n    ∣    ∀  f   ∈    F   f   (  x  )    ≥   0  ∧   ∀  g    ∈    G   g   (  x  )    =   0  ∧   ∀  h    ∈    H   h   (  x  )    ≠  0   }   =  ∅       conditional-set    x   superscript  R  n         for-all  f     F  f  x          0   for-all  g           G  g  x          0   for-all  h           H  h  x        0        \{x\in R^{n}\mid\forall f\in F\,f(x)\geq 0\land\forall g\in G\,g(x)=0\land%
 \forall h\in H\,h(x)\neq 0\}=\emptyset   if and only if        ∃  f   ∈  C   ,    g  ∈  I   ,   n  ∈     ℕ   f   +  g  +    (   ∏  H   )    2  n     =  0.       formulae-sequence      f   C    formulae-sequence    g  I       n      ℕ  f   g   superscript   product  H     2  n          0.       \exists f\in C,g\in I,n\in\mathbb{N}\;f+g+\left(\prod H\right)^{2n}=0.     (Unlike , the "weak" form actually includes the "strong" form as a special case, so the terminology is a misnomer.)
