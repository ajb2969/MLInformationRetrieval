Stengle's Positivstellensatz

In real semialgebraic geometry, Stengle's  (German for "positive-locus-theorem" – see Satz) characterizes polynomials that are positive on a semialgebraic set, which is defined by systems of inequalities of polynomials with real coefficients, or more generally, coefficients from any real closed field.
It can be thought of as an ordered analogue of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. It was proved by Jean-Louis Krivine and then rediscovered by Gilbert Stengle.
Statement
Let  be a real closed field, and  a finite set of polynomials over  in  variables. Let  be the semialgebraic set


 
  and let  be the cone generated by  (i.e., the subsemiring of [1,…,] generated by  and arbitrary squares). Let  ∈ [1,…,] be a polynomial. Then


 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
The weak  is the following variant of the . Let  be a real-closed field, and , , and  finite subsets of [1,…,]. Let  be the cone generated by , and  the ideal generated by . Then


 
  if and only if



(Unlike , the "weak" form actually includes the "strong" form as a special case, so the terminology is a misnomer.)
