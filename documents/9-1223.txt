   Swizzling (computer graphics)      Swizzling (computer graphics)   In computer graphics , swizzling means rearranging the elements of a vector. 1 For example, if A = {1,2,3,4} , where the components are x , y , z , and w respectively, you could compute B = A.wwxy , whereupon B would equal {4,4,1,2} . This is common in GPGPU applications.  In terms of linear algebra , this is equivalent to multiplying by a permutation matrix . If    A  =    (  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  )   T       A   superscript   1  2  3  4   T     A=(1,2,3,4)^{T}   , then swizzling   A   A   A   as above looks like      A  .    w  w  x  y   =    [     0    0    0    1      0    0    0    1      1    0    0    0      0    1    0    0     ]    [     1      2      3      4     ]    =   [     4      4      1      2     ]       formulae-sequence  A        w  w  x  y       0  0  0  1    0  0  0  1    1  0  0  0    0  1  0  0      1    2    3    4            4    4    1    2        A.wwxy=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&1\\
 0&0&0&1\\
 1&0&0&0\\
 0&1&0&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1\\
 2\\
 3\\
 4\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}4\\
 4\\
 1\\
 2\end{bmatrix}   .  References  External links   OpenGL Vertex Program documentation   "  Category:Computer graphics     â†©
