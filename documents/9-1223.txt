Swizzling (computer graphics)

In computer graphics, swizzling means rearranging the elements of a vector.1 For example, if A = {1,2,3,4}, where the components are x, y, z, and w respectively, you could compute B = A.wwxy, whereupon B would equal {4,4,1,2}. This is common in GPGPU applications.
In terms of linear algebra, this is equivalent to multiplying by a permutation matrix. If
