   Glycine dehydrogenase (cyanide-forming)      Glycine dehydrogenase (cyanide-forming)   In enzymology , a glycine dehydrogenase (cyanide-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycine + 2 A   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hydrogen cyanide + CO 2 + 2 AH 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycine and A, whereas its 3 products are hydrogen cyanide , CO 2 , and AH 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine:acceptor oxidoreductase (hydrogen-cyanide-forming) . Other names in common use include hydrogen cyanide synthase , and HCN synthase .
