Elliptic Gauss sum

In mathematics, an elliptic Gauss sum is an analog of a Gauss sum depending on an elliptic curve with complex mutliplication. The quadratic residue symbol in a Gauss sum is replaced by a higher residue symbol such as a cubic or quartic residue symbol, and the exponential function in a Gauss sum is replaced by an elliptic function. They were introduced by , at least in the lemniscate case when the elliptic curve has complex multiplication by i, but seem to have been forgotten or ignored until the paper .
Example
gives the following example of an elliptic Gauss sum, for the case of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by i.


 
  where

The sum is over residues mod P whose representatives are Gaussian integers
n is a positive integer
m is a positive integer dividing 4n
p = 4n+1 is a rational prime congruent to 1 mod 4
φ(z) = sl((1 – i)ωz) where sl is the sine lemniscate function, an elliptic function.
χ is the mth power residue symbol in K with respect to the prime P of K
K is the field k[ζ]
k is the field Q[i]
ζ is a primitive 4n-th root of 1
π is a primary prime in the Gaussian integers Z[i] with norm p
P is a prime in the ring of integers of K lying above π with inertia degree 1
