Stably finite ring

In algebra, a ring

 
  is said to be stably finite (or weakly finite) if, for all square matrices A, B of the same size over R, AB = 1 implies BA = 1. This is a slightly stronger property for a ring than its having the invariant basis number: any nontrivial1 stably finite ring has IBN. Commutative rings, noetherian rings and artinian rings are stably finite. A subring of a stably finite ring and a matrix ring over a stably finite ring is stably finite. A ring satisfying Klein's nilpotence condition is stably finite.

A trivial ring is stably finite but doesn't have IBN.
