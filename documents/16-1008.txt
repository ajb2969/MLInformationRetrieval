   Principal factor      Principal factor   In algebra, the principal factor of a   𝒥   𝒥   \mathcal{J}   -class J of a semigroup  S is equal to J if J is the kernel of S , and to    J  ∪   {  0  }       J   0     J\cup\{0\}   otherwise.  Properties   A principal factor is a simple , 0-simple or null semigroup . 1   References    .   .   .   "  Category:Semigroup theory     Grillet (1995), p. 50, Proposition 4.9. ↩
