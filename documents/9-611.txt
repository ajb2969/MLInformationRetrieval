   Quadratically constrained quadratic program      Quadratically constrained quadratic program   In mathematical optimization , a quadratically constrained quadratic program ( QCQP ) is an optimization problem in which both the objective function and the constraints are quadratic functions. It has the form        1  2    x  T    P  0   x   +    q  0  T   x           1  2    superscript  x  normal-T    subscript  P  0   x      superscript   subscript  q  0   normal-T   x     \displaystyle\tfrac{1}{2}x^{\mathrm{T}}P_{0}x+q_{0}^{\mathrm{T}}x     where P 0 , … P m are n -by- n matrices and x ∈ R n is the optimization variable.  If P 0 , … P m are all positive semidefinite , then the problem is convex . If these matrices are neither positive nor negative semidefinite, the problem is non-convex. If P 1 , … P m are all zero, then the constraints are in fact linear and the problem is a quadratic program .  Hardness  Solving the general case is an NP-hard problem. To see this, note that the two constraints x 1 ( x 1 − 1) ≤ 0 and x 1 ( x 1 − 1) ≥ 0 are equivalent to the constraint x 1 ( x 1 − 1) = 0, which is in turn equivalent to the constraint x 1 ∈ {0, 1}. Hence, any 0–1 integer program (in which all variables have to be either 0 or 1) can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program. Since 0–1 integer programming is NP-hard in general, QCQP is also NP-hard.  Relaxation  There are two main relaxations of QCQP: using semidefinite programming (SDP), and using the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT).  Semidefinite programming  When P 0 , … P m are all positive-definite matrices , the problem is convex and can be readily solved using interior point methods , as done with semidefinite programming .  Example  Max Cut is a problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. Given a graph, the problem is to divide the vertices in two sets, so that as many edges as possible go from one set to the other. Max Cut can be formulated as a QCQP, and SDP relaxation of the dual provides good lower bounds.
