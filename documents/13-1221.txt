   Dini's surface      Dini's surface   In geometry , Dini's surface is a surface with constant negative curvature that can be created by twisting a pseudosphere . 1 It is named after Ulisse Dini 2 and described by the following parametric equations : 3      x  =   a   cos   (  u  )     sin   (  v  )         x    a    u     v      x=a\cos\left(u\right)\sin\left(v\right)         y  =   a   sin   (  u  )     sin   (  v  )         y    a    u     v      y=a\sin\left(u\right)\sin\left(v\right)         z  =    a   (    cos   (  v  )    +   ln   (   tan   (   v  2   )    )     )    +   b  u        z      a      v         v  2         b  u      z=a\left(\cos\left(v\right)+\ln\left(\tan\left(\frac{v}{2}\right)\right)\right%
