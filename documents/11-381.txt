   Phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase      Phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphoribosyl-ATP diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-ATP diphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase , and phosphoribosyladenosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase . This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , H+ .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
