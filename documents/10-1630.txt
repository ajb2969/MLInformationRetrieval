   Cholestenol Delta-isomerase      Cholestenol Delta-isomerase   In enzymology , a cholestenol Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5alpha-cholest-8-en-3beta-ol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol , and one product , 5alpha-cholest-8-en-3beta-ol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is Delta7-cholestenol Delta7-Delta8-isomerase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .
