   Dehydrogluconokinase      Dehydrogluconokinase   In enzymology , a dehydrogluconokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2-dehydro-D-gluconate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 6-phospho-2-dehydro-D-gluconate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2-dehydro-D-gluconate , whereas its two products are ADP and 6-phospho-2-dehydro-D-gluconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:2-dehydro-D-gluconate 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ketogluconokinase , 2-ketogluconate kinase , ketogluconokinase (phosphorylating) , and 2-ketogluconokinase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway .
