   Poly(ribitol-phosphate) beta-glucosyltransferase      Poly(ribitol-phosphate) beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a poly(ribitol-phosphate) beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + poly(ribitol phosphate)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + (beta-D-glucosyl)poly(ribitol phosphate)   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and poly(ribitol phosphate) , whereas its two products are UDP and (beta-D-glucosyl)poly(ribitol phosphate) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:poly(ribitol-phosphate) beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP glucose-poly(ribitol-phosphate) beta-glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-poly(ribitol-phosphate) , beta-glucosyltransferase , UDP-D-glucose polyribitol phosphate glucosyl transferase , and UDP-D-glucose:polyribitol phosphate glucosyl transferase .
