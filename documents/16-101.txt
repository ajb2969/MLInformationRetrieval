   (E)-beta-ocimene synthase      (E)-beta-ocimene synthase   (E)-beta-ocimene synthase (, beta-ocimene synthase , AtTPS03 , ama0a23 , LjEbetaOS , MtEBOS ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((E)-beta-ocimene-forming) . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-beta-ocimene + diphosphate    This enzyme is widely distributed in plants , which release beta-ocimene when attacked by herbivorous insects .
