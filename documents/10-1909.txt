   2,3-dimethylmalate lyase      2,3-dimethylmalate lyase   In enzymology , a 2,3-dimethylmalate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   propanoate + pyruvate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate , and two products , propanoate and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate pyruvate-lyase (propanoate-forming) . Other names in common use include 2,3-dimethylmalate pyruvate-lyase , and (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylmalate pyruvate-lyase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .
