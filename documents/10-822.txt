   Putrescine N-methyltransferase      Putrescine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a putrescine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + putrescine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylputrescine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and putrescine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methylputrescine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:putrescine N-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called putrescine methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis ii .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
