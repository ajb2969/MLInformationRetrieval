   Polychord      Polychord   (Figure)  Bitonal polychord: F major on top of C major. 1    In music and music theory , a bichord or polychord consists of two or more chords , one on top of the other. 2 3 4 In shorthand they are written with the top chord above a line and the bottom chord below, 5 for example F above C    F  C      F  C    \frac{F}{C}   .  The use of polychords may suggest bitonality or polytonality. Harmonic parallelism may suggest bichords.  Examples may be found in Igor Stravinsky 's Petrushka , p. 15, and Rite of Spring , "Dance of the Adolescents" (1921) 6 (see Petrushka chord ). They may also be found in the song "Point of No Return" from Andrew Lloyd Webber 's The Phantom of the Opera , including chords such as Em over Fm. 7  (Figure)  Polychords: Em, EbM, EbM, and DM over Dm. Kostka & Payne (1995). Tonal Harmony , p.494. Third Edition. ISBN 0-07-035874-5.   In the polychords in the image above, the 1st, "might well suggest," a thirteenth chord , the 2nd may suggest a, "d minor ninth chord with upper extensions," but the octave separation of the 3rd makes the suggestion of, "two independent triads with their a m9 apart," even more likely, and the 4th is a, " split-third chord ."  Extended chords contain more than one triad , and so can be regarded as a type of polychord:  (Figure)  Separate chords within an extended chord . 8    For example G 7 (119) (G-B-D-F-A-C) is formed from G major (G-B-D) and D major (D-F-A), or     D  b   G        D  b   G    \frac{Db}{G}   . 9 (C=D)  The Lydian augmented scale , "has a polychord sound built in," 10 created by superimposing the Caug and the Emaj () and/or Fdim () triads that exist in the scale, this being, "a very common practice for most bop and post-bop players [such as McCoy Tyner ]." 11  Examples of extended chords include the Elektra chord .  (Figure)  Fred Steiner 's 1957 Perry Mason  theme , " Park Avenue Beat ", ends with a DM/Cm polychord quoted by Frank Zappa in " Jezebel Boy ", Broadway the Hard Way (1988) and described by Walter Everett as "juicy". 12    When one or both of the chords in a polychord are not "chords" in some exclusive sense according to some preferred chord theory or other, polychords devolves into chordioid technique .
