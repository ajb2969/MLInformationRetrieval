   Microactuator      Microactuator   A microactuator is a microscopic  servomechanism that supplies and transmits a measured amount of energy for the operation of another mechanism or system. As a general actuator , following standards have to be met.   Large travel  High precision  Fast switching  Low power consumption  Power free force sustainability   For microactuator, there are two in addition   Microstructurability  Integrability   Principle of microactuators  The basic principle can be described as the expression for mechanical work     W  =     F  →   ⋅  Δ    r  →        W     normal-⋅   normal-→  F   normal-Δ    normal-→  r      W=\overrightarrow{F}\cdot\Delta\overrightarrow{r}    since an actuator is to manipulate positions and therefore force is needed. For different kind of microactuators, different physical principles are applied.
