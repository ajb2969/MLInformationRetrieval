   Cantor's intersection theorem      Cantor's intersection theorem   In real analysis , a branch of mathematics, Cantor's intersection theorem , named after Georg Cantor , is a theorem related to compact sets of a compact space   S   S   S   . It states that a decreasing nested sequence of non-empty compact subsets of   S   S   S   has nonempty intersection. In other words, supposing { C k } is a sequence of non-empty, closed and totally bounded sets satisfying        C  0   ⊇   C  1   ⊇   ⋯   C  k    ⊇    C   k  +  1    ⋯    ,       superset-of-or-equals   subscript  C  0    subscript  C  1     superset-of-or-equals      normal-⋯   subscript  C  k      superset-of-or-equals       subscript  C    k  1    normal-⋯      C_{0}\supseteq C_{1}\supseteq\cdots C_{k}\supseteq C_{k+1}\cdots,\,     it follows that        (    ⋂  k    C  k    )   ≠  ∅   .        subscript   k    subscript  C  k       \left(\bigcap_{k}C_{k}\right)\neq\emptyset.\,     The result is typically used as a lemma in proving the Heine–Borel theorem , which states that sets of real numbers are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. Conversely, if the Heine–Borel theorem is known, then it can be restated as: a decreasing nested sequence of non-empty, compact subsets of a compact space has nonempty intersection.  As an example, if C k = [0, 1/ k ], the intersection over { C k } is {0}. On the other hand, both the sequence of open bounded sets C k = (0, 1/ k ) and the sequence of unbounded closed sets C k = [ k , ∞) have empty intersection. All these sequences are properly nested.  The theorem generalizes to R n , the set of n -element vectors of real numbers, but does not generalize to arbitrary metric spaces . For example, in the space of rational numbers , the sets       C  k   =   [   2   ,    2   +   1  /  k    ]   =   (   2   ,    2   +   1  /  k    )          subscript  C  k      2       2     1  k             2       2     1  k        C_{k}=[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}+1/k]=(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}+1/k)     are closed and bounded, but their intersection is empty.  A simple corollary of the theorem is that the Cantor set is nonempty, since it is defined as the intersection of a decreasing nested sequence of sets, each of which is defined as the union of a finite number of closed intervals; hence each of these sets is non-empty, closed, and bounded. In fact, the Cantor set contains uncountably many points.  Proof  Assume, by way of contradiction, that     ⋂   C  n    =  ∅         subscript  C  n       \bigcap C_{n}=\emptyset   . For each n, let     U  n   =   X  ∖   C  n         subscript  U  n     X   subscript  C  n      U_{n}=X\setminus C_{n}   . Since     ⋃   U  n    =   X  ∖   ⋂   C  n            subscript  U  n      X     subscript  C  n       \bigcup U_{n}=X\setminus\bigcap C_{n}   and     ⋂   C  n    =  ∅         subscript  C  n       \bigcap C_{n}=\emptyset   , thus     ⋃   U  n    =  X         subscript  U  n    X    \bigcup U_{n}=X   .  Since   X   X   X   is compact and    (   U  n   )     subscript  U  n    (U_{n})   is an open cover of it, we can extract a finite cover. Let    U  k     subscript  U  k    U_{k}   be the largest set of this cover; then    X  =   U  k       X   subscript  U  k     X=U_{k}   . But then     C  k   =   X  ∖   U  k    =  ∅         subscript  C  k     X   subscript  U  k             C_{k}=X\setminus U_{k}=\emptyset   , a contradiction.  Variant in complete metric spaces  In a complete metric space , the following variant of Cantor's intersection theorem holds. Suppose that X is a non-empty complete metric space, and C n is a sequence of closed nested subsets of X whose diameters tend to zero:        lim   n  →  ∞     diam   (   C  n   )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n      diam   subscript  C  n     0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam}(C_{n})=0   where diam( C n ) is defined by        diam   (   C  n   )    =   sup   {   d   (  x  ,  y  )    |    x  ,  y   ∈   C  n    }     .       diam   subscript  C  n     supremum   conditional-set    d   x  y       x  y    subscript  C  n        \operatorname{diam}(C_{n})=\sup\{d(x,y)|x,y\in C_{n}\}.   Then the intersection of the C n contains exactly one point:        ∩   n  =  1   ∞    C  n    =   {  x  }         superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  C  n     x     \cap_{n=1}^{\infty}C_{n}=\{x\}   for some x in X .  A proof goes as follows. Since the diameters tend to zero, the diameter of the intersection of the C n is zero, so it is either empty or consists of a single point. So it is sufficient to show that it is not empty. Pick an element x n of C n for each n . Since the diameter of C n tends to zero and the C n are nested, the x n form a Cauchy sequence. Since the metric space is complete this Cauchy sequence converges to some point x . Since each C n is closed, and x is a limit of a sequence in C n , x must lie in C n . This is true for every n , and therefore the intersection of the C n must contain x .  A converse to this theorem is also true: if X is a metric space with the property that the intersection of any nested family of closed subsets whose diameters tend to zero is non-empty, then X is a complete metric space. (To prove this, let x n be a Cauchy sequence in X , and let C n be the closure of the tail of this sequence.)  References    Jonathan Lewin. An interactive introduction to mathematical analysis.
