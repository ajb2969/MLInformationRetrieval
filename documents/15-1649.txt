Undecaprenyl phosphate N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 1-phosphate transferase

Undecaprenyl phosphate N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 1-phosphate transferase (, PglC) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine:tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl-phosphate N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine transferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine + tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl phosphate 
 
 
 
  UMP + N,N'-diacetyl-alpha-D-bacillosaminyl-diphospho-tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenol
 

This enzyme is isolated from Campylobacter jejuni.
