   Tryptophan transaminase      Tryptophan transaminase   In enzymology , a tryptophan transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-tryptophan + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)pyruvate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophan and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are (indol-3-yl)pyruvate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include L-phenylalanine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase , tryptophan aminotransferase , 5-hydroxytryptophan-ketoglutaric transaminase , hydroxytryptophan aminotransferase , L-tryptophan aminotransferase , and L-tryptophan transaminase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
