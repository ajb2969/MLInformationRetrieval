   Polar set      Polar set    See also polar set (potential theory) .    In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics the polar set of a given subset of a vector space is a certain set in the dual space .  Given a dual pair     (  X  ,  Y  )     X  Y    (X,Y)   the polar set or polar of a subset   A   A   A   of   X   X   X   is a set    A  ∘     superscript  A     A^{\circ}   in   Y   Y   Y   defined as       A  ∘   :=   {   y  ∈  Y   :     sup   x  ∈  A     |   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   |    ≤  1   }      assign   superscript  A     conditional-set    y  Y       subscript  supremum    x  A       x  y     1      A^{\circ}:=\{y\in Y:\sup_{x\in A}|\langle x,y\rangle|\leq 1\}     The bipolar of a subset   A   A   A   of   X   X   X   is the polar of    A  ∘     superscript  A     A^{\circ}   . It is denoted    A    ∘  ∘      superscript  A    absent      A^{\circ\circ}   and is a set in   X   X   X   .  Properties       A  ∘     superscript  A     A^{\circ}   is absolutely convex  If    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   then     B  ∘   ⊆   A  ∘        superscript  B     superscript  A      B^{\circ}\subseteq A^{\circ}     So      ⋃   i  ∈  I     A  i  ∘    ⊆    (    ⋂   i  ∈  I     A  i    )   ∘         subscript     i  I     superscript   subscript  A  i       superscript    subscript     i  I     subscript  A  i        \bigcup_{i\in I}A_{i}^{\circ}\subseteq(\bigcap_{i\in I}A_{i})^{\circ}   , where equality of sets does not necessarily hold.   For all    γ  ≠  0      γ  0    \gamma\neq 0         (   γ  A   )   ∘   =    1   ∣  γ  ∣     A  ∘         superscript    γ  A         1   delimited-∣∣  γ     superscript  A       (\gamma A)^{\circ}=\frac{1}{\mid\gamma\mid}A^{\circ}           (    ⋃   i  ∈  I     A  i    )   ∘   =    ⋂   i  ∈  I     A  i  ∘         superscript    subscript     i  I     subscript  A  i        subscript     i  I     superscript   subscript  A  i        (\bigcup_{i\in I}A_{i})^{\circ}=\bigcap_{i\in I}A_{i}^{\circ}     For a dual pair    (  X  ,  Y  )     X  Y    (X,Y)       A  ∘     superscript  A     A^{\circ}   is closed in   Y   Y   Y   under the weak-*-topology on   Y   Y   Y     The bipolar    A    ∘  ∘      superscript  A    absent      A^{\circ\circ}   of a set   A   A   A   is the absolutely convex envelope of   A   A   A   , that is the smallest absolutely convex set containing   A   A   A   . If   A   A   A   is already absolutely convex then     A    ∘  ∘    =  A       superscript  A    absent     A    A^{\circ\circ}=A   .  For a closed convex cone    C   C   C   in   X   X   X   , the polar cone is equivalent to the one-sided polar set for   C   C   C   , given by        C  ∘   =   {   y  ∈  Y   :    sup   {   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   :   x  ∈  C   }    ≤  1   }        superscript  C     conditional-set    y  Y      supremum   conditional-set   x  y     x  C     1      C^{\circ}=\{y\in Y:\sup\{\langle x,y\rangle:x\in C\}\leq 1\}   . 1  Geometry  In geometry , the polar set may also refer to a duality between points and planes. In particular, the polar set of a point    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   , given by the set of points   x   x   x   satisfying     ⟨  x  ,   x  0   ⟩   =  0       x   subscript  x  0    0    \langle x,x_{0}\rangle=0   is its polar hyperplane, and the dual relationship for a hyperplane yields its pole.
