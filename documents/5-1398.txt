Polar set


See also polar set (potential theory).


In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics the polar set of a given subset of a vector space is a certain set in the dual space.
Given a dual pair

 
  the polar set or polar of a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a set 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  defined as



The bipolar of a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the polar of 
 
 
 
 
 . It is denoted 
 
 
 
  and is a set in

The bipolar

For a closed convex cone

Geometry
In geometry, the polar set may also refer to a duality between points and planes. In particular, the polar set of a point 
 
 
 
 , given by the set of points 
 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  is its polar hyperplane, and the dual relationship for a hyperplane yields its pole.
