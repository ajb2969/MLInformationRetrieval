   Fundamental frequency      Fundamental frequency   (Figure)  Vibration and standing waves in a string, The fundamental and the first 6 overtones   The fundamental frequency , often referred to simply as the fundamental , is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic  waveform . In terms of a superposition of sinusoids (e.g. Fourier series ), the fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency sinusoidal in the sum. In some contexts, the fundamental is usually abbreviated as f 0 (or FF ), indicating the lowest frequency counting from zero . 1 2 3 In other contexts, it is more common to abbreviate it as f 1 , the first harmonic . 4 5 6 7 8 (The second harmonic is then f 2 = 2⋅f 1 , etc. In this context, the zeroth harmonic would be 0 Hz.)  Explanation  All sinusoidal and many non-sinusoidal waveforms are periodic, which is to say they repeat exactly over time. A single period is thus the smallest repeating unit of a signal, and one period describes the signal completely. We can show a waveform is periodic by finding some period T for which the following equation is true:       x   (  t  )    =   x   (   t  +  T   )   for all  t   ∈  ℝ          x  t     x    t  T   for all  t        ℝ     x(t)=x(t+T)\text{ for all }t\in\mathbb{R}     Where x ( t ) is the function of the waveform.  This means that for multiples of some period T the value of the signal is always the same. The least possible value of T for which this is true is called the fundamental period and the fundamental frequency ( f 0 ) is:       f  0   =   1  T        subscript  f  0     1  T     f_{0}=\frac{1}{T}     Where f 0 is the fundamental frequency and T is the fundamental period.    For a tube of length L with one end closed and the other end open the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic is 4 L , as indicated by the top two animations on the right. Hence,        λ  0   =   4  L    .       subscript  λ  0     4  L     \lambda_{0}=4L.     Therefore, using the relation       λ  0   =   v   f  0         subscript  λ  0     v   subscript  f  0      \lambda_{0}=\frac{v}{f_{0}}   , where v is the speed of the wave, we can find the fundamental frequency in terms of the speed of the wave and the length of the tube:        f  0   =   v   4  L     .       subscript  f  0     v    4  L      f_{0}=\frac{v}{4L}.     If the ends of the same tube are now both closed or both opened as in the bottom two animations on the right, the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic becomes 2 L . By the same method as above, the fundamental frequency is found to be        f  0   =   v   2  L     .       subscript  f  0     v    2  L      f_{0}=\frac{v}{2L}.     At 20 °C (68 °F) the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s (1129 ft/s). This speed is temperature dependent and does increase at a rate of 0.6 m/s for each degree Celsius increase in temperature (1.1 ft/s for every increase of 1 °F).  The velocity of a sound wave at different temperatures:-   v = 343.2 m/s at 20 °C  v = 331.3 m/s at 0 °C   Mechanical systems  Consider a spring, fixed at one end and having a mass attached to the other; this would be a single degree of freedom (SDoF) oscillator. Once set into motion it will oscillate at its natural frequency. For a single degree of freedom oscillator, a system in which the motion can be described by a single coordinate, the natural frequency depends on two system properties: mass and stiffness; (providing the system is undamped). The radian frequency, ω n , can be found using the following equation:       ω  n  2   =    k  m         superscript   subscript  ω  normal-n   2     k  m     \omega_{\mathrm{n}}^{2}=\frac{k}{m}\,     Where:  k = stiffness of the spring  m = mass  ω n = radian frequency (radians per second)  From the radian frequency, the natural frequency, f n , can be found by simply dividing ω n by 2 π . Without first finding the radian frequency, the natural frequency can be found directly using:       f  n   =    1   2  π       k  m           subscript  f  normal-n       1    2  π        k  m       f_{\mathrm{n}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\,     Where:  f n = natural frequency in hertz (cycles/second)  k = stiffness of the spring (Newtons/meter or N/m)  m = mass(kg) while doing the modal analysis of structures and mechanical equipment, the frequency of 1st mode is called fundamental frequency.
