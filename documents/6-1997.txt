   Elliptic complex      Elliptic complex   In mathematics , in particular in partial differential equations and differential geometry , an elliptic complex generalizes the notion of an elliptic operator to sequences. Elliptic complexes isolate those features common to the de Rham complex and the Dolbeault complex which are essential for performing Hodge theory . They also arise in connection with the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Atiyah-Bott fixed point theorem .  Definition  If E 0 , E 1 , ..., E k are vector bundles on a smooth manifold  M (usually taken to be compact), then a differential complex is a sequence       Γ   (   E  0   )     ⟶   P  1     Γ   (   E  1   )     ⟶   P  2    …   ⟶   P  k     Γ   (   E  k   )          superscript  normal-⟶   subscript  P  1      normal-Γ   subscript  E  0      normal-Γ   subscript  E  1       superscript  normal-⟶   subscript  P  2      normal-…     superscript  normal-⟶   subscript  P  k        normal-Γ   subscript  E  k       \Gamma(E_{0})\stackrel{P_{1}}{\longrightarrow}\Gamma(E_{1})\stackrel{P_{2}}{%

A differential complex is elliptic if the sequence of symbols      0  →    π  *    E  0     ⟶   σ   (   P  1   )       π  *    E  1     ⟶   σ   (   P  2   )     …   ⟶   σ   (   P  k   )       π  *    E  k    →  0       normal-→  0     superscript  π     subscript  E  0       superscript  normal-⟶    σ   subscript  P  1          superscript  π     subscript  E  1       superscript  normal-⟶    σ   subscript  P  2       normal-…     superscript  normal-⟶    σ   subscript  P  k          superscript  π     subscript  E  k      normal-→    0     0\rightarrow\pi^{*}E_{0}\stackrel{\sigma(P_{1})}{\longrightarrow}\pi^{*}E_{1}%
