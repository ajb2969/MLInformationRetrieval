Club filter

In mathematics, particularly in set theory, if 
 
 
 
  is a regular uncountable cardinal then 
 
 
 
 , the filter of all sets containing a club subset of 
 
 
 
 , is a 
 
 
 
 -complete filter closed under diagonal intersection called the club filter.
To see that this is a filter, note that 
 
 
 
  since it is thus both closed and unbounded (see club set). If 
 
 
 
  then any subset of 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  is also in 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
 , and therefore anything containing it, contains a club set.
It is a 
 
 
 
 -complete filter because the intersection of fewer than 
 
 
 
  club sets is a club set. To see this, suppose 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of club sets where 
 
 
 
 . Obviously 
 
 
 
  is closed, since any sequence which appears in 
 
 
 
  appears in every 
 
 
 
 , and therefore its limit is also in every 
 
 
 
 . To show that it is unbounded, take some 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be an increasing sequence with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 . Such a sequence can be constructed, since every 
 
 
 
  is unbounded. Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is regular, the limit of this sequence is less than 
 
 
 
 . We call it 
 
 
 
 , and define a new sequence 
 
 
 
  similar to the previous sequence. We can repeat this process, getting a sequence of sequences 
 
 
 
  where each element of a sequence is greater than every member of the previous sequences. Then for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an increasing sequence contained in 
 
 
 
 , and all these sequences have the same limit (the limit of 
 
 
 
 ). This limit is then contained in every 
 
 
 
 , and therefore 
 
 
 
 , and is greater than 
 
 
 
 .
To see that 
 
 
 
  is closed under diagonal intersection, let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of club sets, and let 
 
 
 
 . To show 
 
 
 
  is closed, suppose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Since each 
 
 
 
  is closed, 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 . To show 
 
 
 
  is unbounded, let 
 
 
 
 , and define a sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  as follows
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the minimal element of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Such an element exists since by the above, the intersection of 
 
 
 
  club sets is club. Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , since it is in each 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
