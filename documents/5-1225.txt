   Club filter      Club filter   In mathematics , particularly in set theory , if   κ   κ   \kappa   is a regular  uncountable  cardinal then    club   (  κ  )      club  κ    \operatorname{club}(\kappa)   , the filter of all sets containing a club subset of   κ   κ   \kappa   , is a   κ   κ   \kappa   -complete filter closed under diagonal intersection called the club filter .  To see that this is a filter, note that    κ  ∈   club   (  κ  )        κ   club  κ     \kappa\in\operatorname{club}(\kappa)   since it is thus both closed and unbounded (see club set ). If    x  ∈   club   (  κ  )        x   club  κ     x\in\operatorname{club}(\kappa)   then any subset of   κ   κ   \kappa   containing   x   x   x   is also in    club   (  κ  )      club  κ    \operatorname{club}(\kappa)   , since   x   x   x   , and therefore anything containing it, contains a club set.  It is a   κ   κ   \kappa   -complete filter because the intersection of fewer than   κ   κ   \kappa   club sets is a club set. To see this, suppose     ⟨   C  i   ⟩    i  <  α      subscript   delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  C  i      i  α     \langle C_{i}\rangle_{i<\alpha}   is a sequence of club sets where    α  <  κ      α  κ    \alpha<\kappa   . Obviously    C  =   ⋂   C  i        C     subscript  C  i      C=\bigcap C_{i}   is closed, since any sequence which appears in   C   C   C   appears in every    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   , and therefore its limit is also in every    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   . To show that it is unbounded, take some    β  <  κ      β  κ    \beta<\kappa   . Let    ⟨   β   1  ,  i    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  β   1  i      \langle\beta_{1,i}\rangle   be an increasing sequence with     β   1  ,  1    >  β       subscript  β   1  1    β    \beta_{1,1}>\beta   and     β   1  ,  i    ∈   C  i        subscript  β   1  i     subscript  C  i     \beta_{1,i}\in C_{i}   for every    i  <  α      i  α    i<\alpha   . Such a sequence can be constructed, since every    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   is unbounded. Since    α  <  κ      α  κ    \alpha<\kappa   and   κ   κ   \kappa   is regular, the limit of this sequence is less than   κ   κ   \kappa   . We call it    β  2     subscript  β  2    \beta_{2}   , and define a new sequence    ⟨   β   2  ,  i    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  β   2  i      \langle\beta_{2,i}\rangle   similar to the previous sequence. We can repeat this process, getting a sequence of sequences    ⟨   β   j  ,  i    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  β   j  i      \langle\beta_{j,i}\rangle   where each element of a sequence is greater than every member of the previous sequences. Then for each    i  <  α      i  α    i<\alpha   ,    ⟨   β   j  ,  i    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  β   j  i      \langle\beta_{j,i}\rangle   is an increasing sequence contained in    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   , and all these sequences have the same limit (the limit of    ⟨   β   j  ,  i    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  β   j  i      \langle\beta_{j,i}\rangle   ). This limit is then contained in every    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   , and therefore   C   C   C   , and is greater than   β   β   \beta   .  To see that    club   (  κ  )      club  κ    \operatorname{club}(\kappa)   is closed under diagonal intersection, let    ⟨   C  i   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  C  i     \langle C_{i}\rangle   ,    i  <  κ      i  κ    i<\kappa   be a sequence of club sets, and let    C  =    Δ   i  <  κ     C  i        C     subscript  normal-Δ    i  κ     subscript  C  i      C=\Delta_{i<\kappa}C_{i}   . To show   C   C   C   is closed, suppose    S  ⊆  α  <  κ        S  α       κ     S\subseteq\alpha<\kappa   and     ⋃  S   =  α        S   α    \bigcup S=\alpha   . Then for each    γ  ∈  S      γ  S    \gamma\in S   ,    γ  ∈   C  β       γ   subscript  C  β     \gamma\in C_{\beta}   for all    β  <  γ      β  γ    \beta<\gamma   . Since each    C  β     subscript  C  β    C_{\beta}   is closed,    α  ∈   C  β       α   subscript  C  β     \alpha\in C_{\beta}   for all    β  <  α      β  α    \beta<\alpha   , so    α  ∈  C      α  C    \alpha\in C   . To show   C   C   C   is unbounded, let    α  <  κ      α  κ    \alpha<\kappa   , and define a sequence    ξ  i     subscript  ξ  i    \xi_{i}   ,    i  <  ω      i  ω    i<\omega   as follows     ξ  0   =  α       subscript  ξ  0   α    \xi_{0}=\alpha   , and    ξ   i  +  1      subscript  ξ    i  1     \xi_{i+1}   is the minimal element of     ⋂   γ  <   ξ  i      C  γ       subscript     γ   subscript  ξ  i      subscript  C  γ     \bigcap_{\gamma<\xi_{i}}C_{\gamma}   such that     ξ   i  +  1    >   ξ  i        subscript  ξ    i  1     subscript  ξ  i     \xi_{i+1}>\xi_{i}   . Such an element exists since by the above, the intersection of    ξ  i     subscript  ξ  i    \xi_{i}   club sets is club. Then    ξ  =    ⋃   i  <  ω     ξ  i    >  α        ξ    subscript     i  ω     subscript  ξ  i         α     \xi=\bigcup_{i<\omega}\xi_{i}>\alpha   and    ξ  ∈  C      ξ  C    \xi\in C   , since it is in each    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   with    i  <  ξ      i  ξ    i<\xi   .
