   Euclidean relation      Euclidean relation   In mathematics , Euclidean relations are a class of binary relations that satisfy a weakened form of transitivity that formalizes Euclid 's "Common Notion 1" in The Elements : things which equal the same thing also equal one another.  Definition  A binary relation  R on a set  X is Euclidean (sometimes called right Euclidean ) if it satisfies the following: for every a , b , c in X , if a is related to b and c , then b is related to c . 1  To write this in predicate logic :      ∀  a  ,  b  ,  c  ∈   X    (   a    R   b  ∧   a    R   c  →   b    R   c  )   .     fragments  for-all  a  normal-,  b  normal-,  c   X   fragments  normal-(  a  R  b   a  R  c  normal-→  b  R  c  normal-)   normal-.    \forall a,b,c\in X\,(a\,R\,b\land a\,R\,c\to b\,R\,c).     Dually, a relation R on X is left Euclidean if for every a , b , c in X , if b is related to a and c is related to a , then b is related to c :      ∀  a  ,  b  ,  c  ∈   X    (   b    R   a  ∧   c    R   a  →   b    R   c  )   .     fragments  for-all  a  normal-,  b  normal-,  c   X   fragments  normal-(  b  R  a   c  R  a  normal-→  b  R  c  normal-)   normal-.    \forall a,b,c\in X\,(b\,R\,a\land c\,R\,a\to b\,R\,c).     Relation to transitivity  The property of being Euclidean is different from transitivity : both the Euclidean property and transitivity infer a relation between b and c from relations between a and b and between a and c , but with different argument orderings in the relations. However, if a relation is symmetric , then the argument orders do not matter; thus a symmetric relation with any one of these three properties (transitive, right Euclidean, left Euclidean) must have all three. 2  If a relation is Euclidean and reflexive , then it must also be symmetric and hence transitive (following the previous paragraph), and so it must be an equivalence relation . Consequently, equivalence relations are exactly the reflexive Euclidean relations. 3  References  "  Category:Mathematical relations  Relation     . ↩
