   Alanine—oxomalonate transaminase      Alanine—oxomalonate transaminase   In enzymology , an alanine-oxomalonate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-alanine + oxomalonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + aminomalonate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-alanine and oxomalonate , whereas its two products are pyruvate and aminomalonate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-alanine:oxomalonate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include alanine-oxomalonate aminotransferase , L-alanine-ketomalonate transaminase , and alanine-ketomalonate (mesoxalate) transaminase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
