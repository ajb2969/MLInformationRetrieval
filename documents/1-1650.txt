   Zero divisor      Zero divisor  In [[abstract algebra]], an [[element (mathematics)|element]] {{mvar|a}} of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] {{mvar|R}} is called a '''left zero divisor''' if there exists a nonzero {{mvar|x}} such that {{math|1=''ax'' = 0}}, See Bourbaki, p. 9 8. or equivalently if the map from   R   R   R   to   R   R   R   that sends   x   x   x   to    a  x      a  x    ax   is not injective. 1 Similarly, an element    a   a   a   of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero   y   y   y   such that     y  a   =  0        y  a   0    ya=0   . This is a partial case of divisibility in rings. An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor . 2 An element   a   a   a   that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two-sided zero divisor (the nonzero   x   x   x   such that     a  x   =  0        a  x   0    ax=0   may be different from the nonzero   y   y   y   such that     y  a   =  0        y  a   0    ya=0   ). If the ring is commutative , then the left and right zero divisors are the same.  An element of a ring that is not a zero divisor is called regular , or a non-zero-divisor . A zero divisor that is nonzero is called a nonzero zero divisor or a nontrivial zero divisor .  Examples   In the ring     ℤ  /  4   ℤ        ℤ  4   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}    , the residue class    2  ¯     normal-¯  2    \overline{2}   is a zero divisor since .  The only zero divisor of the ring   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   of integers is 0.  A nilpotent element of a nonzero ring is always a two-sided zero divisor.  A idempotent element     e  ≠  1      e  1    e\neq 1   of a ring is always a two-sided zero divisor, since     e   (   1  -  e   )    =  0  =    (   1  -  e   )   e           e    1  e    0           1  e   e      e(1-e)=0=(1-e)e   .  Examples of zero divisors in the ring of    2  ×  2      2  2    2\times 2   matrices (over any nonzero ring ) are shown here:        (     1    1      2    2     )    (     1    1       -  1      -  1      )    =    (      -  2     1       -  2     1     )    (     1    1      2    2     )    =   (     0    0      0    0     )    ,            1  1    2  2      1  1      1     1            2   1      2   1      1  1    2  2            0  0    0  0       \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\
 2&2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\
 -1&-1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-2&1\\
 -2&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\
 2&2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix},     : \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}   \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}  \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}.   A direct product of two or more nonzero rings always has nonzero zero divisors. For example, in R 1 × R 2 with each R i nonzero, (1,0)(0,1) = (0,0), so (1,0) is a zero divisor.   One-sided zero-divisor   Consider the ring of (formal) matrices    (     x     y  ;       0     z  ;      )      x  y    0  z     \begin{pmatrix}x&y\\
 0&z\end{pmatrix}   with     x  ,  z   ∈  ℤ       x  z   ℤ    x,z\in\mathbb{Z}   and    y  ∈    ℤ  /  2   ℤ       y      ℤ  2   ℤ     y\in\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}   . Then      (     x     y  ;       0     z  ;      )    (     a     b  ;       0     c  ;      )    =   (      x  a       x  b   ;   +   y  c         0      z  c   ;      )           x  y    0  z      a  b    0  c         x  a      x  b       y  c       0    z  c       \begin{pmatrix}x&y\\
 0&z\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 0&c\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}xa&xb+yc\\
 0&zc\end{pmatrix}   and      (     a     b  ;       0     c  ;      )    (     x     y  ;       0     z  ;      )    =   (      x  a       y  a   ;   +   z  b         0      z  c   ;      )           a  b    0  c      x  y    0  z         x  a      y  a       z  b       0    z  c       \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 0&c\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x&y\\
 0&z\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}xa&ya+zb\\
 0&zc\end{pmatrix}   . If    x  ≠  0  ≠  y        x  0       y     x\neq 0\neq y   , then    (     x     y  ;       0     z  ;      )      x  y    0  z     \begin{pmatrix}x&y\\
 0&z\end{pmatrix}   is a left zero divisor iff    x   x   x   is even, since      (     x     y  ;       0     z  ;      )    (     0    1      0    0     )    =   (     0     x  ;       0    0     )           x  y    0  z      0  1    0  0       0  x    0  0      \begin{pmatrix}x&y\\
 0&z\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&x\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix}   ; and it is a right zero divisor iff   z   z   z   is even for similar reasons. If either of    x  ,  z     x  z    x,z   is   0   0    , then it is a two-sided zero-divisor.  Here is another example of a ring with an element that is a zero divisor on one side only. Let   S   S   S   be the set of all sequences of integers    (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  )       a  1     a  2     a  3   normal-…    (a1,a2,a3,...)   . Take for the ring all additive maps from   S   S   S   to   S   S   S   , with pointwise addition and composition as the ring operations. (That is, our ring is    End   (  S  )       End  S    \mathrm{End}(S)   , the endomorphism ring of the additive group   S   S   S   .) Three examples of elements of this ring are the right shift      R   (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  )    =   (  0  ,   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  )         R     a  1     a  2     a  3   normal-…     0    a  1     a  2   normal-…     R(a1,a2,a3,...)=(0,a1,a2,...)   , the left shift      L   (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  )    =   (   a  2   ,   a  3   ,   a  4   ,  …  )         L     a  1     a  2     a  3   normal-…       a  2     a  3     a  4   normal-…     L(a1,a2,a3,...)=(a2,a3,a4,...)   , and the projection map onto the first factor     P   (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  )    =   (   a  1   ,  0  ,  0  ,  …  )         P     a  1     a  2     a  3   normal-…       a  1   0  0  normal-…     P(a1,a2,a3,...)=(a1,0,0,...)   . All three of these additive maps are not zero, and the composites    L  P      L  P    LP   and    P  R      P  R    PR   are both zero, so   L   L   L   is a left zero divisor and   R   R   R   is a right zero divisor in the ring of additive maps from   S   S   S   to   S   S   S   . However,   L   L   L   is not a right zero divisor and   R   R   R   is not a left zero divisor: the composite    L  R      L  R    LR   is the identity. Note also that    R  L      R  L    RL   is a two-sided zero-divisor since     R  L  P   =  0  =   P  R  L           R  L  P   0         P  R  L      RLP=0=PRL   , while     L  R   =  1        L  R   1    LR=1   is not in any direction.   Non-examples   The ring of integers modulo a prime number has no zero divisors other than 0. Since every nonzero element is a unit , this ring is a field .    More generally, a division ring has no zero divisors except 0.    A nonzero  commutative ring whose only zero divisor is 0 is called an integral domain .   Properties   In the ring of   n   n   n   -by-   n   n   n   matrices over a field , the left and right zero divisors coincide; they are precisely the singular matrices . In the ring of   n   n   n   -by-   n   n   n   matrices over an integral domain , the zero divisors are precisely the matrices with determinant  zero .    Left or right zero divisors can never be units , because if   a   a   a   is invertible and     a  x   =  0        a  x   0    ax=0   , then , whereas   x   x   x   must be nonzero.   Zero as a zero divisor  There is no need for a separate convention regarding the case    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   , because the definition applies also in this case:   If   R   R   R   is a ring other than the zero ring , then 0 is a (two-sided) zero divisor, because     0  ·  1   =  0        0  normal-·  1   0    0·1=0   and     1  ·  0   =  0        1  normal-·  0   0    1·0=0   .  If   R   R   R   is the zero ring , in which    0  =  1      0  1    0=1   , then 0 is not a zero divisor, because there is no nonzero element that when multiplied by 0 yields 0.   Such properties are needed in order to make the following general statements true:   In a commutative ring   R   R   R   , the set of non-zero-divisors is a multiplicative set in   R   R   R   . (This, in turn, is important for the definition of the total quotient ring .) The same is true of the set of non-left-zero-divisors and the set of non-right-zero-divisors in an arbitrary ring, commutative or not.  In a commutative Noetherian ring   R   R   R   , the set of zero divisors is the union of the associated prime ideals of   R   R   R   .   Some references choose to exclude 0 as a zero divisor by convention, but then they must introduce exceptions in the two general statements just made.  Zero divisor on a module  Let   R   R   R   be a commutative ring, let   M   M   M   be an   R   R   R   -module, and let   a   a   a   be an element of   R   R   R   . One says that   a   a   a   is    M   M   M   -regular if the multiplication by   a   a   a   map    M   →  a   M      superscript  normal-→  a   M  M    M\stackrel{a}{\to}M   is injective, and that   a   a   a   is a zero divisor on   M   M   M    otherwise. 3 The set of   M   M   M   -regular elements is a multiplicative set in   R   R   R   . 4  Specializing the definitions of "   M   M   M   -regular" and "zero divisor on   M   M   M   " to the case   M   M   M   =   R   R   R   recovers the definitions of "regular" and "zero divisor" given earlier in this article.
