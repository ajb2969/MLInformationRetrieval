Zero divisor
In [[abstract algebra]], an [[element (mathematics)|element]] {{mvar|a}} of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] {{mvar|R}} is called a '''left zero divisor''' if there exists a nonzero {{mvar|x}} such that {{math|1=''ax'' = 0}},See Bourbaki, p. 9
 8. or equivalently if the map from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  that sends 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is not injective.1 Similarly, an element

 
  of a ring is called a right zero divisor if there exists a nonzero 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . This is a partial case of divisibility in rings. An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a zero divisor.2 An element 
 
 
 
  that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a two-sided zero divisor (the nonzero 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  may be different from the nonzero 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ). If the ring is commutative, then the left and right zero divisors are the same.
An element of a ring that is not a zero divisor is called regular, or a non-zero-divisor. A zero divisor that is nonzero is called a nonzero zero divisor or a nontrivial zero divisor.
Examples

In the ring 
 
 
, the residue class 
 
 
 
  is a zero divisor since .
The only zero divisor of the ring 
 
 
 
  of integers is 0.
A nilpotent element of a nonzero ring is always a two-sided zero divisor.
A idempotent element

 
  of a ring is always a two-sided zero divisor, since 
 
 
 
 .
Examples of zero divisors in the ring of 
 
 
 
  matrices (over any nonzero ring) are shown here:
 
 


:

\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}.

A direct product of two or more nonzero rings always has nonzero zero divisors. For example, in R1 × R2 with each Ri nonzero, (1,0)(0,1) = (0,0), so (1,0) is a zero divisor.

One-sided zero-divisor

Consider the ring of (formal) matrices 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a left zero divisor iff

 
  is even, since 
 
 
 
 ; and it is a right zero divisor iff 
 
 
 
  is even for similar reasons. If either of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , then it is a two-sided zero-divisor.
Here is another example of a ring with an element that is a zero divisor on one side only. Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of all sequences of integers 
 
 
 
 . Take for the ring all additive maps from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , with pointwise addition and composition as the ring operations. (That is, our ring is 
 
 
 
 , the endomorphism ring of the additive group 
 
 
 
 .) Three examples of elements of this ring are the right shift

 
 , the left shift

 
 , and the projection map onto the first factor 
 
 
 
 . All three of these additive maps are not zero, and the composites 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both zero, so 
 
 
 
  is a left zero divisor and 
 
 
 
  is a right zero divisor in the ring of additive maps from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . However, 
 
 
 
  is not a right zero divisor and 
 
 
 
  is not a left zero divisor: the composite 
 
 
 
  is the identity. Note also that 
 
 
 
  is a two-sided zero-divisor since 
 
 
 
 , while 
 
 
 
  is not in any direction.

Non-examples

The ring of integers modulo a prime number has no zero divisors other than 0. Since every nonzero element is a unit, this ring is a field.


More generally, a division ring has no zero divisors except 0.


A nonzero commutative ring whose only zero divisor is 0 is called an integral domain.

Properties

In the ring of 
 
 
 
 -by-
 
 
 
  matrices over a field, the left and right zero divisors coincide; they are precisely the singular matrices. In the ring of 
 
 
 
 -by-
 
 
 
  matrices over an integral domain, the zero divisors are precisely the matrices with determinant zero.


Left or right zero divisors can never be units, because if 
 
 
 
  is invertible and 
 
 
 
 , then , whereas 
 
 
 
  must be nonzero.

Zero as a zero divisor
There is no need for a separate convention regarding the case 
 
 
 
 , because the definition applies also in this case:

If 
 
 
 
  is a ring other than the zero ring, then 0 is a (two-sided) zero divisor, because 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is the zero ring, in which 
 
 
 
 , then 0 is not a zero divisor, because there is no nonzero element that when multiplied by 0 yields 0.

Such properties are needed in order to make the following general statements true:

In a commutative ring 
 
 
 
 , the set of non-zero-divisors is a multiplicative set in 
 
 
 
 . (This, in turn, is important for the definition of the total quotient ring.) The same is true of the set of non-left-zero-divisors and the set of non-right-zero-divisors in an arbitrary ring, commutative or not.
In a commutative Noetherian ring 
 
 
 
 , the set of zero divisors is the union of the associated prime ideals of 
 
 
 
 .

Some references choose to exclude 0 as a zero divisor by convention, but then they must introduce exceptions in the two general statements just made.
Zero divisor on a module
Let 
 
 
 
  be a commutative ring, let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
 -module, and let 
 
 
 
  be an element of 
 
 
 
 . One says that 
 
 
 
  is 

 
 -regular if the multiplication by 
 
 
 
  map 
 
 
 
  is injective, and that 
 
 
 
  is a zero divisor on 
 
 
 otherwise.3 The set of 
 
 
 
 -regular elements is a multiplicative set in 
 
 
 
 .4
Specializing the definitions of "
 
 
 
 -regular" and "zero divisor on 
 
 
 
 " to the case 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
  recovers the definitions of "regular" and "zero divisor" given earlier in this article.
