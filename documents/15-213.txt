Symmetric decreasing rearrangement

In mathematics, the symmetric decreasing rearrangement of a function is a function which is symmetric and decreasing, and whose level sets are of the same size as those of the original function.1
Definition for sets
Given a measurable set, 
 
 
 
 , in Rn one can obtain the symmetric rearrangement of 
 
 
 
 , called 
 
 
 
 , by



where 
 
 
 
  is the volume of the unit ball and where 
 
 
 
  is the volume of 
 
 
 
 . Notice that this is just the ball centered at the origin whose volume is the same as that of the set 
 
 
 
 .
Definition for functions
The rearrangement of a non-negative, measurable function 
 
 
 
  whose level sets have finite measure is



In words, the value of 
 
 
 
  gives the height t for which the radius of the symmetric rearrangement of 
 
 
 
  is equal to x. We have the following motivation for this definition. Because the identity



holds for any non-negative function 
 
 
 
 , the above definition is the unique definition that forces the identity 
 
 
 
  to hold.
Properties
The function 
 
 
 
  is a symmetric and decreasing function whose level sets have the same measure as the level sets of 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



If 
 
 
 
  is a function in 
 
 
 
 , then



The Hardy–Littlewood inequality holds, i.e.



Further, the Szegő inequality holds. This says that if 
 
 
 
  and if 
 
 
 
  then



The symmetric decreasing rearrangement is order preserving and decreases 
 
 
 
  distance, i.e.



and



Applications
The Pólya–Szegő inequality yields, in the limit case, with 
 
 
 
 , the isoperimetric inequality. Also, one can use some relations with harmonic functions to prove the Rayleigh–Faber–Krahn inequality.
