   Domain coloring      Domain coloring   (Figure)  Domain coloring plot of the function ƒ( x ) =( x 2 − 1)( x − 2 − i ) 2 /( x 2 + 2 + 2 i ). The hue represents the function argument, while the saturation and value represent the multiply-wrapped magnitude.   Domain coloring is a technique for visualizing functions of a complex variable . The term "domain coloring" was coined by Frank Farris, possibly around 1998. 1 2 There were many earlier uses of color to visualize complex functions, typically mapping argument (phase) to hue. 3 The technique of using continuous color to map points from domain to codomain or image plane was used in 1999 by George Abdo and Paul Godfrey 4 and colored grids were used in graphics by Doug Arnold that he dates to 1997. 5  Motivation  Insufficient dimensions  A real function     f  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow{}\mathbb{R}   (for example     f   (  x  )    =   x  2         f  x    superscript  x  2     f(x)=x^{2}   ) can be graphed using two Cartesian coordinates on a plane .  A graph of a complex function     g  :   ℂ  →  ℂ      normal-:  g   normal-→  ℂ  ℂ     g:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow{}\mathbb{C}   of one complex variable lives in a space with two complex dimensions. Since the complex plane itself is two-dimensional, a graph of a complex function is an object in four real dimensions. That makes complex functions difficult to visualize in a three-dimensional space. One way of depicting holomorphic functions is with a Riemann surface .  Visual encoding of complex numbers  Given a complex number    z  =   r   e   i  θ         z    r   superscript  e    i  θ       z=re^{i\theta}   , the phase (also known as argument)   θ   θ   \theta   can be represented by a hue , and the modulus    r  =   |  z  |       r    z     r=|z|   is represented by either intensity or variations in intensity. The arrangement of hues is arbitrary, but often it follows the color wheel . Sometimes the phase is represented by a specific gradient rather than hue.
