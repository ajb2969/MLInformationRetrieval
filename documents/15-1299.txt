Reaction and explanation
The Compromise was analyzed by various authors234 and received attention in the popular press.5 The system is based on the square root law of Penrose, which implies that a priori voting power defined by the Penrose–Banzhaf index of a member of a voting body is inversely proportional to the square root of its size. Hence the number of votes obtained by a representative of a state 
 
 
 
  with population 
 
 
 
  is proportional to 
 
 
 
 . Jagiellonian Compromise is based on a single criterion only. Decision of the Council of the Union of 
 
 
 
  Member States is taken if the sum of the weights of States voting in favour of a given proposal exceeds the qualified majority quota 
 
 
 
  equal to


 
  For a generic distribution of population among 
 
 
 
  States of the Union the optimal threshold 
 
 
 
  decreases with
