   Jagiellonian Compromise      Jagiellonian Compromise   The Jagiellonian Compromise is a voting system for two tier voting bodies originally proposed in 2004 1 for the Council of the European Union as a way of achieving "one person, one vote" within the Union.  Reaction and explanation  The Compromise was analyzed by various authors 2 3 4 and received attention in the popular press. 5 The system is based on the square root law of Penrose , which implies that a priori voting power defined by the Penrose–Banzhaf index of a member of a voting body is inversely proportional to the square root of its size. Hence the number of votes obtained by a representative of a state   j   j   j   with population    N  j     subscript  N  j    N_{j}   is proportional to     N  j        subscript  N  j     \sqrt{N_{j}}   . Jagiellonian Compromise is based on a single criterion only. Decision of the Council of the Union of   M   M   M   Member States is taken if the sum of the weights of States voting in favour of a given proposal exceeds the qualified majority quota   q   q   q   equal to      q  =    1  2   ⋅   (   1  +      ∑   i  =  1   M    N  i       ∑   i  =  1   M     N  i       )        q   normal-⋅    1  2     1        superscript   subscript     i  1    M    subscript  N  i       superscript   subscript     i  1    M      subscript  N  i          q=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\left(1+\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{M}N_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{M}%
 \sqrt{N_{i}}}\right)   For a generic distribution of population among   M   M   M   States of the Union the optimal threshold    q  *     subscript  q     q_{*}   decreases with   M   M   M   as     q  *   ≈    1  /  2   +   1  /    π  M           subscript  q        1  2     1      π  M        q_{*}\approx 1/2+1/\sqrt{\pi M}   . 6  See also   Penrose method  List of countries by population   References  "  Category:Voting systems  Category:European Union     ↩  ↩  Pukelsheim, Friedrich.
