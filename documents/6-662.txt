   Differential graded algebra      Differential graded algebra   In mathematics , in particular abstract algebra and topology , a differential graded algebra is a graded algebra with an added chain complex structure that respects the algebra structure.  __TOC__  Definition  A differential graded algebra (or simply DG-algebra ) A is a graded algebra equipped with a map    d  :   A  →  A      normal-:  d   normal-→  A  A     d\colon A\to A   which is either degree 1 (cochain complex convention) or degree    -  1      1    -1   (chain complex convention) that satisfies two conditions:   (i)     d  ∘  d   =  0        d  d   0    d\circ d=0     This says that d gives A the structure of a chain complex or cochain complex (accordingly as the differential reduces or raises degree).  (ii)     d   (   a  ⋅  b   )    =     (   d  a   )   ⋅  b   +      (   -  1   )    deg   (  a  )     a   ⋅   (   d  b   )           d   normal-⋅  a  b       normal-⋅    d  a   b    normal-⋅     superscript    1    deg  a    a     d  b       d(a\cdot b)=(da)\cdot b+(-1)^{\operatorname{deg}(a)}a\cdot(db)   , where deg is the degree .  This says that the differential  d respects the graded Leibniz rule .   A DGA is an augmented DG-algebra, or differential graded augmented algebra (the terminology is due to Henri Cartan). 1 Many sources use the term DGAlgebra for a DG-algebra.  Examples of DGAs   The Koszul complex is a DGA.  The Tensor algebra is a DGA with differential similar to that of the Koszul complex.  The Singular cohomology with coefficients in a ring is a DGA; the differential is given by the Bockstein homomorphism , and the product given by the cup product .  Differential forms on a manifold , together with the exterior derivation and the wedge-product form a DGA. See also de Rham cohomology .   Other facts about DGAs   The homology       H  *    (  A  )    =    ker   (  d  )    /   im   (  d  )            subscript  H    A      kernel  d    im  d      H_{*}(A)=\ker(d)/\operatorname{im}(d)   of a DG-algebra    (  A  ,  d  )     A  d    (A,d)   is a graded algebra. The homology of a DGA is an augmented algebra .
