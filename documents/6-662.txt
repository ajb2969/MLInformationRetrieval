Differential graded algebra

In mathematics, in particular abstract algebra and topology, a differential graded algebra is a graded algebra with an added chain complex structure that respects the algebra structure.

Definition
A differential graded algebra (or simply DG-algebra) A is a graded algebra equipped with a map 
 
 
 
  which is either degree 1 (cochain complex convention) or degree 
 
 
 
  (chain complex convention) that satisfies two conditions:

(i) 
 
 

This says that d gives A the structure of a chain complex or cochain complex (accordingly as the differential reduces or raises degree).
 
(ii) 
 
 
 
 , where deg is the degree.
 
This says that the differential d respects the graded Leibniz rule.
 

A DGA is an augmented DG-algebra, or differential graded augmented algebra (the terminology is due to Henri Cartan).1 Many sources use the term DGAlgebra for a DG-algebra.
Examples of DGAs

The Koszul complex is a DGA.
The Tensor algebra is a DGA with differential similar to that of the Koszul complex.
The Singular cohomology with coefficients in a ring is a DGA; the differential is given by the Bockstein homomorphism, and the product given by the cup product.
Differential forms on a manifold, together with the exterior derivation and the wedge-product form a DGA. See also de Rham cohomology.

Other facts about DGAs

The homology

 
  of a DG-algebra 
 
 
 
  is a graded algebra. The homology of a DGA is an augmented algebra.
