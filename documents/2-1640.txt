   Weight (representation theory)      Weight (representation theory)   In the mathematical field of representation theory , a weight of an algebra  A over a field F is an algebra homomorphism from A to F , or equivalently, a one-dimensional representation of A over F . It is the algebra analogue of a multiplicative character of a group . The importance of the concept, however, stems from its application to representations of Lie algebras and hence also to representations of algebraic and Lie groups . In this context, a weight of a representation is a generalization of the notion of an eigenvalue , and the corresponding eigenspace is called a weight space .  Motivation and general concept  Weights  Given a set S of matrices , each of which is diagonalizable , and any two of which commute , it is always possible to simultaneously diagonalize all of the elements of S . 1 2 Equivalently, for any set S of mutually commuting semisimple  linear transformations of a finite-dimensional vector space  V there exists a basis of V consisting of simultaneous eigenvectors of all elements of S . Each of these common eigenvectors v ∈ V defines a linear functional on the subalgebra U of End( V ) generated by the set of endomorphisms S ; this functional is defined as the map which associates to each element of U its eigenvalue on the eigenvector v . This "generalized eigenvalue" is a prototype for the notion of a weight.  The notion is closely related to the idea of a multiplicative character in group theory , which is a homomorphism χ from a group  G to the multiplicative group of a field  F . Thus χ : G → F × satisfies χ ( e ) = 1 (where e is the identity element of G ) and       χ   (   g  h   )    =   χ   (  g  )   χ   (  h  )          χ    g  h      χ  g  χ  h     \chi(gh)=\chi(g)\chi(h)   for all g , h in G . Indeed, if G  acts on a vector space V over F , each simultaneous eigenspace for every element of G , if such exists, determines a multiplicative character on G : the eigenvalue on this common eigenspace of each element of the group.  The notion of multiplicative character can be extended to any algebra  A over F , by replacing χ : G → F × by a linear map  χ : A → F with:       χ   (   a  b   )    =   χ   (  a  )   χ   (  b  )          χ    a  b      χ  a  χ  b     \chi(ab)=\chi(a)\chi(b)   for all a , b in A . If an algebra A  acts on a vector space V over F to any simultaneous eigenspace corresponds an algebra homomorphism from A to F assigning to each element of A its eigenvalue.  If A is a Lie algebra , then the commutativity of the field and the anticommutativity of the Lie bracket imply that this map vanish on commutators : χ ([a,b])=0. A weight on a Lie algebra g over a field F is a linear map λ: g → F with λ([ x , y ])=0 for all x , y in g . Any weight on a Lie algebra g vanishes on the derived algebra [ g , g ] and hence descends to a weight on the abelian Lie algebra  g /[ g , g ]. Thus weights are primarily of interest for abelian Lie algebras, where they reduce to the simple notion of a generalized eigenvalue for space of commuting linear transformations.  If G is a Lie group or an algebraic group , then a multiplicative character θ: G → F × induces a weight χ = dθ: g → F on its Lie algebra by differentiation. (For Lie groups, this is differentiation at the identity element of G , and the algebraic group case is an abstraction using the notion of a derivation.)  Weight space of a representation of a Lie algebra  Among the set of weights, some are related to the data of a representation. Let V be a representation of a Lie algebra g over a field F and let λ be a weight of g . Then the weight space of V with weight λ: ħ → F ( ħ is the Cartan subalgebra of g .) is the subspace       V  λ   :=   {   v  ∈  V   :     ∀  ξ   ∈  𝔥   ,    ξ  ⋅  v   =   λ   (  ξ  )   v     }      assign   subscript  V  λ    conditional-set    v  V    formulae-sequence     for-all  ξ   𝔥      normal-⋅  ξ  v     λ  ξ  v        V_{\lambda}:=\{v\in V:\forall\xi\in\mathfrak{h},\quad\xi\cdot v=\lambda(\xi)v\}   (where    ξ  ⋅  v     normal-⋅  ξ  v    \xi\cdot v   denotes the action of ħ on V ). A weight of the representation  V is a weight λ such that the corresponding weight space is nonzero. Nonzero elements of the weight space are called weight vectors .  If V is the direct sum of its weight spaces      V  =    ⊕   λ  ∈   𝔥  *      V  λ        V    subscript  direct-sum    λ   superscript  𝔥       subscript  V  λ      V=\bigoplus_{\lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^{*}}V_{\lambda}   then it is called a ; this corresponds to there being a common eigenbasis (a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors) for all the represented elements of the algebra, i.e., to their being simultaneously diagonalizable matrices (see diagonalizable matrix ).  Similarly, we can define a weight space V λ for any representation of a Lie group or an associative algebra .  Semisimple Lie algebras  Let g be a Lie algebra , h a maximal  commutative  Lie subalgebra consisting of semi-simple elements (sometimes called Cartan subalgebra ) and let V be a finite dimensional representation of g . If g is semisimple , then [ g , g ] = g and so all weights on g are trivial. However, V is, by restriction, a representation of h , and it is well known that V is a weight module for h , i.e., equal to the direct sum of its weight spaces. By an abuse of language, the weights of V as a representation of h are often called weights of V as a representation of g .  Similar definitions apply to a Lie group G , a maximal commutative Lie subgroup  H and any representation V of G . Clearly, if λ is a weight of the representation V of G , it is also a weight of V as a representation of the Lie algebra g of G .  If V is the adjoint representation of g , its weights are called roots , the weight spaces are called root spaces, and weight vectors are sometimes called root vectors.  We now assume that g is semisimple, with a chosen Cartan subalgebra h and corresponding root system . Let us suppose also that a choice of positive roots Φ + has been fixed. This is equivalent to the choice of a set of simple roots .  Ordering on the space of weights  Let h * 0 be the real subspace of h * (if it is complex) generated by the roots of g .  There are two concepts how to define an ordering of h * 0 .  The first one is   μ ≤ λ if and only if λ − μ is nonnegative linear combination of simple roots .   The second concept is given by an element f in h 0 and   μ ≤ λ if and only if μ ( f ) ≤ λ( f ).   Usually, f is chosen so that β( f ) > 0 for each positive root β.  Integral weight  A weight λ ∈ h * is integral (or g -integral), if λ( H γ ) ∈ Z for each coroot  H γ such that γ is a positive root.  The fundamental weights     ω  1   ,  …  ,   ω  n       subscript  ω  1   normal-…   subscript  ω  n     \omega_{1},\ldots,\omega_{n}   are defined by the property that they form a basis of h * dual to the set of simple coroots      H   α  1    ,  …  ,   H   α  n        subscript  H   subscript  α  1    normal-…   subscript  H   subscript  α  n      H_{\alpha_{1}},\ldots,H_{\alpha_{n}}   .  Hence λ is integral if it is an integral combination of the fundamental weights. The set of all g -integral weights is a lattice in h * called weight lattice for g , denoted by P ( g ).  A weight λ of the Lie group G is called integral, if for each t in h such that      exp   (  t  )    =  1  ∈  G   ,    λ   (  t  )    ∈   2  π  i  𝐙       formulae-sequence        t   1       G        λ  t     2  π  i  𝐙      \exp(t)=1\in G,\,\,\lambda(t)\in 2\pi i\mathbf{Z}   . For G semisimple, the set of all G -integral weights is a sublattice P ( G ) ⊂ P ( g ). If G is simply connected , then P ( G ) = P ( g ). If G is not simply connected, then the lattice P ( G ) is smaller than P ( g ) and their quotient is isomorphic to the fundamental group of G .  Dominant weight  A weight λ is dominant if     λ   (   H  γ   )    ≥  0        λ   subscript  H  γ    0    \lambda(H_{\gamma})\geq 0   for each coroot  H γ such that γ is a positive root. Equivalently, λ is dominant, if it is a non-negative linear combination of the fundamental weights.  The convex hull of the dominant weights is sometimes called the fundamental Weyl chamber .  Sometimes, the term dominant weight is used to denote a dominant (in the above sense) and integral weight.  Highest weight  A weight λ of a representation V is called the highest weight if no other weight of V is larger than λ. Sometimes, it is assumed that a highest weight is a weight, such that all other weights of V are strictly smaller than λ in the partial ordering given above. The term highest weight denotes often the highest weight of a "highest-weight module".  Similarly, we define the lowest weight .  The space of all possible weights is a vector space. Let's fix a total ordering of this vector space such that a nonnegative linear combination of positive vectors with at least one nonzero coefficient is another positive vector.  Then, a representation is said to have highest weight λ if λ is a weight and all its other weights are less than λ.  Similarly, it is said to have lowest weight λ if λ is a weight and all its other weights are greater than it.  A weight vector     v  λ   ∈  V       subscript  v  λ   V    v_{\lambda}\in V   of weight λ is called a highest-weight vector , or vector of highest weight , if all other weights of V are smaller than λ.  Highest-weight module  A representation V of g is called highest-weight module if it is generated by a weight vector v ∈ V that is annihilated by the action of all positive root spaces in g .  This is something more special than a g - module with a highest weight .  Similarly we can define a highest-weight module for representation of a Lie group or an associative algebra .  Verma module  For each dominant weight λ ∈ h *, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) simple highest-weight g -module with highest weight λ, which is denoted L (λ).  It can be shown that each highest weight module with highest weight λ is a quotient of the Verma module  M (λ). This is just a restatement of universality property in the definition of a Verma module.  A highest-weight module is a weight module. The weight spaces in a highest-weight module are always finite dimensional.  See also   Highest-weight category   Notes  References    .   .   .     .
