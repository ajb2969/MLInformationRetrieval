Galactolipid O-acyltransferase




Galactolipid O-acyltransferase

In enzymology, a galactolipid O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 mono-beta-D-galactosyldiacylglycerol 
 
 
 
  acylmono-beta-D-galactosyldiacylglycerol + mono-beta-D-galactosylacylglycerol
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, mono-beta-D-galactosyldiacylglycerol, and two products, acylmono-beta-D-galactosyldiacylglycerol and mono-beta-D-galactosylacylglycerol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is mono-beta-D-galactosyldiacylglycerol:mono-beta-D-galactosyldiacylgly cerol acyltransferase. This enzyme is also called galactolipid:galactolipid acyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism.
