   Superoxide reductase      Superoxide reductase   Superoxide reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of highly reactive and toxic superoxide (O 2 − ) into less toxic hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ):   reduced rubredoxin + O 2 − + 2 H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   rubredoxin + H 2 O 2   Fe 2+ + O 2 − + 2 H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   Fe 3+ + H 2 O 2    Hydrogen peroxide in turn is reduced to water by rubrerythrin . The 3 substrates of this enzyme are reduced rubredoxin , superoxide , and H + , whereas its two products are rubredoxin and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on superoxide as acceptor (only sub-subclass identified to date). The systematic name of this enzyme class is rubredoxin:superoxide oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include neelaredoxin , and desulfoferrodoxin .
