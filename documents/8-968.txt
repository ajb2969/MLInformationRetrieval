   Reactive inhibition      Reactive inhibition   Reactive inhibition is a phrase coined by Clark L. Hull (1951) in his postulate X.A.:   Whenever a reaction R is evoked from an organism there is left an increment of primary negative drive I R which inhibits to a degree according to its magnitude the reaction potential S E R to that response (Hull, 1951, p. 74).   According to Hull's postulate X.B. inhibition I dissipates exponentially with time t :.:   With the passage of time since its formation I R spontaneously dissipates approximately as a simple decay function of the time t elapsed, i.e.,       I  R  ′   =    I  R   x   10   -   a  t           subscript   superscript  I  normal-′   R      subscript  I  R   x   superscript  10      a  t        I^{\prime}_{R}=I_{R}x10^{-at}   (Hull, 1951, p. 74).   Hull's decay formula is somewhat awkward and might give rise to confusion. For example, I ' R does not refer to the derivative of I R . A more convenient way of writing the formula would be as follows:       I   (  t  )    =   I   (  0  )    e   -   b  t            I  t     I  0   superscript  e      b  t        I(t)=I(0)e^{-bt}     with    b  =   a   ln   (  10  )         b    a    10      b=a\ln(10)   .    I   (  0  )       I  0    I(0)   is the inhibition at the beginning the time interval [0, t ]. Note, that if one takes the natural logarithm of both sides one obtains:       Y   (  t  )    =    Y   (  0  )    -   b  t          Y  t       Y  0     b  t      Y(t)=Y(0)-bt     where     Y   (  t  )    =    ln  I    (  t  )          Y  t       I   t     Y(t)=\ln I(t)   and     Y   (  0  )    =    ln  I    (  0  )          Y  0       I   0     Y(0)=\ln I(0)   . The last formula is used in Inhibition Theory .  References  Hull, C.L.: Essentials of behavior. Westport (Connecticut): Greenwood Press, 1951.  "  Category:Perception
