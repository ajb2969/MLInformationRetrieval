Riesz potential

In mathematics, the Riesz potential is a potential named after its discoverer, the Hungarian mathematician Marcel Riesz. In a sense, the Riesz potential defines an inverse for a power of the Laplace operator on Euclidean space. They generalize to several variables the Riemann–Liouville integrals of one variable.
If 0 αf of a locally integrable function f on Rn is the function defined by
^n} \frac{f(y)}{| x - y |^{n-\alpha}} \, \mathrm{d}y|1}}
where the constant is given by



This singular integral is well-defined provided f decays sufficiently rapidly at infinity, specifically if f ∈ Lp(Rn) with 1 ≤ p  1, then the rate of decay of f and that of Iαf are related in the form of an inequality (the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality)


 
  More generally, the operators Iα are well-defined for complex α such that 0 I_\alpha f = f*K_\alpha\,
where Kα is the locally integrable function:


 
  The Riesz potential can therefore be defined whenever f is a compactly supported distribution. In this connection, the Riesz potential of a positive Borel measure μ with compact support is chiefly of interest in potential theory because Iαμ is then a (continuous) subharmonic function off the support of μ, and is lower semicontinuous on all of Rn.
Consideration of the Fourier transform reveals that the Riesz potential is a Fourier multiplier. In fact, one has


 
  and so, by the convolution theorem,



The Riesz potentials satisfy the following semigroup property on, for instance, rapidly decreasing continuous functions


 
  provided


 
  Furthermore, if 2 \Delta I_{\alpha+2} = -I_\alpha.\  One also has, for this class of functions,
