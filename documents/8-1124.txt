   Riesz potential      Riesz potential   In mathematics , the Riesz potential is a potential named after its discoverer, the Hungarian  mathematician  Marcel Riesz . In a sense, the Riesz potential defines an inverse for a power of the Laplace operator on Euclidean space. They generalize to several variables the Riemann–Liouville integrals of one variable.  If 0 α f of a locally integrable function  f on R n is the function defined by  ^n} \frac{f(y)}{| x - y |^{n-\alpha}} \, \mathrm{d}y| 1 }}  where the constant is given by        c  α   =    π   n  /  2     2  α     Γ   (   α  /  2   )     Γ   (    (   n  -  α   )   /  2   )       .       subscript  c  α      superscript  π    n  2     superscript  2  α       normal-Γ    α  2      normal-Γ      n  α   2        c_{\alpha}=\pi^{n/2}2^{\alpha}\frac{\Gamma(\alpha/2)}{\Gamma((n-\alpha)/2)}.     This singular integral is well-defined provided f decays sufficiently rapidly at infinity, specifically if f ∈ L p ( R n ) with 1 ≤ p 1, then the rate of decay of f and that of I α f are related in the form of an inequality (the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality )          ∥    I  α   f   ∥    p  *    ≤    C  p     ∥  f  ∥   p     ,    p  *   =    n  p    n  -   α  p       .     formulae-sequence     subscript   norm     subscript  I  α   f     superscript  p        subscript  C  p    subscript   norm  f   p        superscript  p        n  p     n    α  p        \|I_{\alpha}f\|_{p^{*}}\leq C_{p}\|f\|_{p},\quad p^{*}=\frac{np}{n-\alpha p}.   More generally, the operators I α are well-defined for complex α such that 0 I_\alpha f = f*K_\alpha\,  where K α is the locally integrable function:         K  α    (  x  )    =    1   c  α     1    |  x  |    n  -  α       .         subscript  K  α   x       1   subscript  c  α      1   superscript    x     n  α        K_{\alpha}(x)=\frac{1}{c_{\alpha}}\frac{1}{|x|^{n-\alpha}}.   The Riesz potential can therefore be defined whenever f is a compactly supported distribution. In this connection, the Riesz potential of a positive Borel measure μ with compact support is chiefly of interest in potential theory because I α μ is then a (continuous) subharmonic function off the support of μ, and is lower semicontinuous on all of R n .  Consideration of the Fourier transform reveals that the Riesz potential is a Fourier multiplier . In fact, one has         K  α   ^    (  ξ  )    =    |   2  π  ξ   |    -  α           normal-^   subscript  K  α    ξ    superscript      2  π  ξ      α      \widehat{K_{\alpha}}(\xi)=|2\pi\xi|^{-\alpha}   and so, by the convolution theorem ,           I  α   f   ^    (  ξ  )    =     |   2  π  ξ   |    -  α     f  ^    (  ξ  )     .         normal-^     subscript  I  α   f    ξ      superscript      2  π  ξ      α     normal-^  f   ξ     \widehat{I_{\alpha}f}(\xi)=|2\pi\xi|^{-\alpha}\hat{f}(\xi).     The Riesz potentials satisfy the following semigroup property on, for instance, rapidly decreasing  continuous functions        I  α    I  β    =   I   α  +  β           subscript  I  α    subscript  I  β     subscript  I    α  β      I_{\alpha}I_{\beta}=I_{\alpha+\beta}   provided        0  <   Re  α    ,     Re  β   <  n   ,   0  <   Re   (   α  +  β   )    <  n     .     formulae-sequence    0   Re  α     formulae-sequence     Re  β   n       0   Re    α  β         n       0<\operatorname{Re\,}\alpha,\operatorname{Re\,}\beta   Furthermore, if 2 \Delta I_{\alpha+2} = -I_\alpha.\  One also has, for this class of functions,         lim   α  →   0  +       (    I  α   f   )    (  x  )     =   f   (  x  )     .        subscript    normal-→  α   superscript  0           superscript  I  α   f   x      f  x     \lim_{\alpha\to 0^{+}}(I^{\alpha}f)(x)=f(x).
