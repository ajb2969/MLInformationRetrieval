   NADPH:quinone reductase      NADPH:quinone reductase   In enzymology , a NADPH:quinone reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NADPH + H + + 2quinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NADP + + 2semiquinone   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADPH , H + , and quinone , whereas its two products are NADP + and semiquinone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called NADPH2:quinone reductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
