   Tarski's exponential function problem      Tarski's exponential function problem   In model theory , Tarski 's exponential function problem asks whether the theory of the real numbers together with the exponential function is decidable . Tarski had previously shown that the theory of the real numbers (without the exponential function) is decidable.  The problem  The ordered real field R is a structure over the language of ordered rings  L or = (+,·,−,or-sentence φ there is an effective procedure for determining whether        Th   (   \R   )    ⊧  φ   .     models   Th  \R   φ    \operatorname{Th}(\R)\models\varphi.     He then asked whether this was still the case if one added a unary function exp to the language that was interpreted as the exponential function on R , to get the structure R exp .  Conditional and equivalent results  The problem can be reduced to finding an effective procedure for determining whether any given exponential polynomial in n variables and with coefficients in Z has a solution in R n .  showed that Schanuel's conjecture implies such a procedure exists, and hence gave a conditional solution to Tarski's problem. Schanuel's conjecture deals with all complex numbers so would be expected to be a stronger result than the decidability of R exp , and indeed, Macintyre and Wilkie proved that only a real version of Schanuel's conjecture is required to imply the decidability of this theory.  Even the real version of Schanuel's conjecture is not a necessary condition for the decidability of the theory. In their paper, Macintyre and Wilkie showed that an equivalent result to the decidability of Th( R exp ) is what they dubbed the Weak Schanuel's Conjecture. This conjecture states that there is an effective procedure that, given n ≥ 1 and exponential polynomials in n variables with integer coefficients f 1 ,..., f n , g , produces an integer η ≥ 1 that depends on n , f 1 ,..., f n , g , and such that if α ∈ R n is a non-singular solution of the system        f  1    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,   e   x  1    ,  …  ,   e   x  n    )    =  …  =    f  n    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,   e   x  1    ,  …  ,   e   x  n    )    =  0           subscript  f  1     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    superscript  e   subscript  x  1    normal-…   superscript  e   subscript  x  n      normal-…          subscript  f  n     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    superscript  e   subscript  x  1    normal-…   superscript  e   subscript  x  n           0     f_{1}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},e^{x_{1}},\ldots,e^{x_{n}})=\ldots=f_{n}(x_{1},\ldots%
 ,x_{n},e^{x_{1}},\ldots,e^{x_{n}})=0     then either g ( α ) = 0 or | g ( α )| > η −1 .  Workaround  Recently there are attempts at handling the theory of the real numbers with functions such as exp, sin by relaxing decidability to the weaker notion of quasi-decidability. A theory is quasi-decidable iff there is a procedure that decides satisfiability but that may run forever for inputs that are not robust in a certain, well-defined sense. Such a procedure exists for systems of n equations in n variables ().  References       "  Category:Model theory  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics
