Jacobson density theorem

In mathematics, more specifically non-commutative ring theory, modern algebra, and module theory, the Jacobson density theorem is a theorem concerning simple modules over a ring 
 
 
 
 .1
The theorem can be applied to show that any primitive ring can be viewed as a "dense" subring of the ring of linear transformations of a vector space.23 This theorem first appeared in the literature in 1945, in the famous paper "Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions" by Nathan Jacobson.4 This can be viewed as a kind of generalization of the Artin-Wedderburn theorem's conclusion about the structure of simple Artinian rings.
Motivation and formal statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a ring and let 
 
 
 
  be a simple right 
 
 
 
 -module. If 
 
 
 
 
  is a non-zero element of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the cyclic submodule of 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
 
 ). Therefore, if 
 
 
 
  are non-zero elements of 
 
 
 
 , there is an element of 
 
 
 
  that induces an endomorphism of 
 
 
 
  transforming 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The natural question now is whether this can be generalized to arbitrary (finite) tuples of elements. More precisely, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the tuple  and  separately, so that there is an element of 
 
 
 
  with the property that  yi}} for all 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the set of all 
 
 
 
 
 -module endomorphisms of 
 
 
 
 , then Schur's lemma asserts that 
 
 
 
  is a division ring, and the Jacobson density theorem answers the question on tuples in the affirmative, provided that the  are linearly independent over 
 
 
 
 .
With the above in mind, the theorem may be stated this way:

The Jacobson Density Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a simple right 
 
 
 
 
 -module,  End(UR)}}, and 
 
 
 
  a finite and 
 
 
 
 -linearly independent set. If 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -linear transformation on 
 
 
 
 
  then there exists 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .5


Proof
In the Jacobson density theorem, the right 
 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is simultaneously viewed as a left 
 
 
 
 -module where  End(UR)}}, in the natural way: 
 
 
 
 . It can be verified that this is indeed a left module structure on 
 
 
 
 .6 As noted before, Schur's lemma proves 
 
 
 
 
  is a division ring if 
 
 
 
  is simple, and so 
 
 
 
  is a vector space over 
 
 
 
 .
The proof also relies on the following theorem proven in  p. 185:

Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a simple right 
 
 
 
 
 -module,  End(UR)}}, and 
 
 
 
  a finite set. Write  annR(X)}} for the annihilator of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be in 
 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
 ; the 
 
 
 
 -span of 
 
 
 
 
 .
 

Proof of the Jacobson density theorem
We use induction on 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is empty, then the theorem is vacuously true and the base case for induction is verified.
Assume 
 
 
 
  is non-empty, let 
 
 
 
  be an element of 
 
 
 
 
  and write  If 
 
 
 
  is any 
 
 
 
 -linear transformation on 
 
 
 
 , by the induction hypothesis there exists 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . Write  annR(Y)}}. It is easily seen that 
 
 
 
  is a submodule of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
 , then the previous theorem implies that 
 
 
 
  would be in the 
 
 
 
 -span of 
 
 
 
 , contradicting the 
 
 
 
 -linear independence of 
 
 
 
 
 , therefore 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is simple, we have: 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
 , there exists 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Define 
 
 
 
  and observe that for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
  we have:



Now we do the same calculation for 
 
 
 
 :



Therefore, 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , as desired. This completes the inductive step of the proof. It follows now from mathematical induction that the theorem is true for finite sets 
 
 
 
  of any size.
Topological characterization
A ring 
 
 
 
 
  is said to act densely on a simple right 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  if it satisfies the conclusion of the Jacobson density theorem.7 There is a topological reason for describing 
 
 
 
  as "dense". Firstly, 
 
 
 
  can be identified with a subring of  by identifying each element of 
 
 
 
 
  with the 
 
 
 
  linear transformation it induces by right multiplication. If 
 
 
 
  is given the discrete topology, and if  is given the product topology, and  is viewed as a subspace of  and is given the subspace topology, then 
 
 
 
  acts densely on 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 
  is dense set in  with this topology.8
Consequences
The Jacobson density theorem has various important consequences in the structure theory of rings.9 Notably, the Artin–Wedderburn theorem's conclusion about the structure of simple right Artinian rings is recovered. The Jacobson density theorem also characterizes right or left primitive rings as dense subrings of the ring of 
 
 
 
 -linear transformations on some 
 
 
 
 -vector space 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a division ring.10
Relations to other results
This result is related to the Von Neumann bicommutant theorem, which states that, for a *-algebra 
 
 
 
 
  of operators on a Hilbert space

 
 , the double commutant 
 
 
 
  can be approximated by 
 
 
 
  on any given finite set of vectors. See also the Kaplansky density theorem in the von Neumann algebra setting.
