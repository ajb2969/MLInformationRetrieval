Entropic risk measure

In financial mathematics, the entropic risk measure is a risk measure which depends on the risk aversion of the user through the exponential utility function. It is a possible alternative to other risk measures as value-at-risk or expected shortfall.
It is a theoretically interesting measure because it provides different risk values for different individuals whose attitudes toward risk may differ. However, in practice it would be difficult to use since quantifying the risk aversion for an individual is difficult to do. The entropic risk measure is the prime example of a convex risk measure which is not coherent.1 Given the connection to utility functions, it can be used in utility maximization problems.
Mathematical definition
The entropic risk measure with the risk aversion parameter 
 
 
 
  is defined as


2 where 
 
 
 
  is the relative entropy of Q [[Absolutely continuous#Absolute continuity of measures|
Acceptance set
The acceptance set for the entropic risk measure is the set of payoffs with positive expected utility. That is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the exponential utility function.3
Dynamic entropic risk measure
The conditional risk measure associated with dynamic entropic risk with risk aversion parameter 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  This is a time consistent risk measure if 
 
 
 
  is constant through time.4
