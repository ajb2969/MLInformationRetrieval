   Frozen orbit      Frozen orbit   In orbital mechanics , a frozen orbit is an orbit for an artificial satellite in which the natural drifts due to the Central body 's shape have been minimized by carefully choosing the orbital parameters . Typically this is an orbit where over a long time, the altitude is always the same at the same point in each orbit 1 —changes in the inclination , position of the lowest point of the orbit , and eccentricity have been minimized by choosing initial values so that their perturbations cancel out. 2 This results in a long-term stable orbit that minimizes stationkeeping propellant usage.  Background & Reasons for Selecting a Frozen Orbit  For many spacecraft, changes to the orbit are caused by the oblateness of the Earth , gravitational attraction from the Sun and Moon, solar radiation pressure , and air drag . These are called "perturbing forces". They must be counteracted by maneuvers to keep the spacecraft in the desired orbit. For a geostationary spacecraft , correction maneuvers on the order of 40–50 m/s per year are required to counteract these forces.  For Sun-synchronous spacecraft , intentional shifting of the orbit plane (called "precession") can be used for the benefit of the mission. For these missions, a near-circular orbit with an altitude of 600–900 km is used. An appropriate inclination (97.8-99.0 degrees) is selected so that the precession of the orbital plane is equal to the rate of movement of the Earth around the Sun - or about 1 degree per day.  As a result, the spacecraft will pass over points on the Earth that have the same time of day during every orbit. For instance, if the orbit is "square to the Sun", the vehicle will always pass over points at which it is 6 a.m. on the north-bound portion, and 6 p.m. on the south-bound portion. This is called a "Dawn-Dusk" orbit. Alternatively, if the orbit plane is perpendicular to the Sun, the vehicle will always pass over Earth noon on the north-bound leg, and Earth midnight on the south-bound leg. These are called "Noon-Midnight" orbits. Such orbits are desirable for many Earth observation missions such as weather, imagery, and mapping.  Perturbing forces caused by the oblateness of the Earth will also change the shape (called the "eccentricity") of the orbit. To compensate, there are near-circular orbits where there are no secular/long periodic perturbations of the eccentricity, only periodic perturbations with the same period as the orbit. Such an orbit is called a "frozen orbit". These orbits are often the preferred choice for Earth observation missions where repeated observations under constant conditions are desirable.  The Earth observation satellites  ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat are operated in Sun-synchronous frozen orbits.  Classical theory  The classical theory of frozen orbits is essentially based on the analytical perturbation analysis for artificial satellites of Dirk Brouwer made under contract with NASA and published in 1959. 3  This analysis can be carried out as follows:  In the article Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft) the secular perturbation of the orbital pole    Δ    z  ^        normal-Δ   normal-^  z     \Delta\hat{z}\,   from the     J  2      subscript  J  2    J_{2}\,   term is shown to be     what in terms of orbital elements is expressed as      Making the analogue analysis for the     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   term, one gets     what in terms of orbital elements is expressed as      In the same article the secular perturbation of the components of the eccentricity vector caused by the     J  2      subscript  J  2    J_{2}\,   is shown to be:     where:   The first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the in-plane component of the perturbing force  The second term is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new orbital plane, the orbital plane being perturbed by the out-of-plane force component   Making the analogue analysis for the     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   term one gets for the first term, i.e. for the perturbation of the eccentricity vector from the in-plane force component     For inclinations in the range 97.8–99.0 deg, the    Δ   Ω       normal-Δ  normal-Ω    \Delta\Omega\,   value given by () is much smaller than the value given by () and can be ignored. Similarly the quadratic terms of the eccentricity vector components in () can be ignored for almost circular orbits, i.e. () can be approximated with     Adding the     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   contribution    2   π      J  3     μ    p  3        3  2     sin   i     (      5  4      sin  2    i     -  1   )    (   1   ,  0  )       2  π     subscript  J  3     μ   superscript  p  3       3  2     i         5  4     superscript   2   i    1    1  0     2\pi\ \frac{J_{3}}{\mu\ p^{3}}\ \frac{3}{2}\ \sin i\ \left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^{%
 2}i\ -\ 1\right)\ (1\ ,\ 0)     to () one gets     This the difference equation saying that the eccentricity vector will describe a circle centered at the point    (   0   ,   -       J  3     sin  i      J  2    2   p      )     0         subscript  J  3     i       subscript  J  2   2  p       (\ 0\ ,\ -\frac{J_{3}\ \sin i}{J_{2}\ 2\ p}\ )\,   , the polar argument of the eccentricity vector increasing with    -   2   π     J  2     μ    p  2     3   (      5  4      sin  2    i     -  1   )          2  π     subscript  J  2     μ   superscript  p  2     3        5  4     superscript   2   i    1      -2\pi\ \frac{J_{2}}{\mu\ p^{2}}\ 3\left(\frac{5}{4}\ \sin^{2}i\ -\ 1\right)\,   radians between consecutive orbits.  As      μ  =    398600.440   km  3    /    s  2         μ      398600.440   superscript  km  3     superscript  s  2      \mu=398600.440\text{ km}^{3}/s^{2}\,           J  2    =     1.7555 10  10    km  5    /    s  2          subscript  J  2        superscript  1.7555 10  10    superscript  km  5     superscript  s  2      J_{2}\ =\ 1.7555\ 10^{10}\text{ km}^{5}/s^{2}\,           J  3    =   -     2.619 10  11    km  6    /    s  2           subscript  J  3          superscript  2.619 10  11    superscript  km  6     superscript  s  2       J_{3}\ =\ -2.619\ 10^{11}\text{ km}^{6}/s^{2}\,     one gets for a polar orbit (    i  =   90   deg        i    90  deg     i=90\text{ deg}\,   ) with    p  =   7200   km        p    7200  km     p=7200\text{ km}\,   that the center of the circle is    (   0   ,   0.001036   )     0  0.001036    (\ 0\ ,\ 0.001036\ )\,   and the change of polar argument is 0.00400 radians per orbit.  The latter figure means that the eccentricity vector will have described a full circle in 1569 orbits. Selecting the initial mean eccentricity vector to    (   0   ,  0.001036  )     0  0.001036    (0\ ,\ 0.001036)\,   the mean eccentricity vector will stay constant for successive orbits, i.e. the orbit is frozen because the secular perturbations of the     J  2      subscript  J  2    J_{2}\,   term given by () and of the     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   term given by () cancel out.  In terms of classical orbital elements this means that a frozen orbit should have the following (mean!) elements:      e  =   -       J  3     sin  i      J  2    2   p          e         subscript  J  3     i       subscript  J  2   2  p       e=-\frac{J_{3}\ \sin i}{J_{2}\ 2\ p}\,         ω  =    90    deg        ω    90  deg     \omega=\ 90\ \text{deg}\,     Modern theory  The modern theory of frozen orbits is based on the algorithm given in. 4  For this the analytical expression () is used to iteratively update the initial (mean) eccentricity vector to obtain that the (mean) eccentricity vector several orbits later computed by the precise numerical propagation takes precisely the same value. In this way the secular perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the     J  2      subscript  J  2    J_{2}\,   term is used to counteract all secular perturbations, not only those (dominating) caused by the     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   term. One such additional secular perturbation that in this way can be compensated for is the one caused by the solar radiation pressure , this perturbation is discussed in the article " Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft) ".  Applying this algorithm for the case discussed above, i.e. a polar orbit (    i  =   90   deg        i    90  deg     i=90\text{ deg}\,   ) with    p  =   7200   km        p    7200  km     p=7200\text{ km}\,   ignoring all other perturbing forces then the     J  2      subscript  J  2    J_{2}\,   and the     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   forces for the numerical propagation one gets exactly the same optimal average eccentricity vector as with the "classical theory", i.e.    (   0   ,  0.001036  )     0  0.001036    (0\ ,\ 0.001036)\,   .  Including also the forces due to the higher zonal terms the optimal value changes to    (   0   ,  0.001285  )     0  0.001285    (0\ ,\ 0.001285)\,   .  Assuming in addition a reasonable solar pressure (a "cross-sectional-area" of 0.05 square meters per kg, the direction to the Sun in the direction towards the ascending node) the optimal value for the average eccentricity vector gets    (   0.000069   ,  0.001285  )     0.000069  0.001285    (0.000069\ ,\ 0.001285)\,   what corresponds to    ω  =    87    deg        ω    87  deg     \omega=\ 87\ \text{deg}\,   , i.e. the optimal value is no more     ω  =    90    deg        ω    90  deg     \omega=\ 90\ \text{deg}\,     This algorithm is implemented in the orbit control software used for the Earth observation satellites  ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat  Derivation of the closed form expressions for the J3 perturbation  The main perturbing force to be counter-acted to have a frozen orbit is the "     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   force", i.e. the gravitational force caused by an imperfect symmetry north/south of the Earth, and the "classical theory" is based on the closed form expression for this "     J  3      subscript  J  3    J_{3}\,   perturbation". With the "modern theory" this explicit closed form expression is not directly used but it is certainly still worthwhile to derive it.  The derivation of this expression can be done as follows:  The potential from a zonal term is rotational symmetric around the polar axis of the Earth and corresponding force is entirely in a longitudial plane with one component      F  r      r  ^         subscript  F  r    normal-^  r     F_{r}\ \hat{r}\,   in the radial direction and one component      F  λ      λ  ^         subscript  F  λ    normal-^  λ     F_{\lambda}\ \hat{\lambda}\,   with the unit vector     λ  ^      normal-^  λ    \hat{\lambda}\,   orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions     r  ^      normal-^  r    \hat{r}\,   and     λ  ^      normal-^  λ    \hat{\lambda}\,   are illustrated in Figure 1.
