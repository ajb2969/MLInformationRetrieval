   Density contrast      Density contrast   The Density Contrast is a parameter used in galaxy formation to indicate where there are local enhancements in matter density.      Δ  =    ∂  ϱ   ϱ       normal-Δ      ϱ   ϱ     \Delta=\frac{\partial\varrho}{\varrho}     It is believed that after inflation , although the universe was mostly uniform, some regions were slightly denser than others with contrast densities on the order of 1 trillionth. As the horizon distance expanded, the enclosed causally connected (i.e. gravitationally connected) masses increased until they reached the Jeans mass and began to collapse, which allowed galaxies , galaxy clusters , superclusters , and filaments to form.
