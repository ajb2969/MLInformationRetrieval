   Phosphate-transporting ATPase      Phosphate-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a phosphate-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + phosphateout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + phosphatein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and phosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (phosphate-importing) . This enzyme is also called ABC phosphate transporter . This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general .  References         "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
