Pushforward (homology)

In algebraic topology, the pushforward of a continuous function


 
  between two topological spaces is a homomorphism

 
  between the homology groups for 
 
 
 
 .
Homology is a functor which converts a topological space 
 
 
 
  into a sequence of homology groups 
 
 
 
 . (Often, the collection of all such groups is referred to using the notation 
 
 
 
 ; this collection has the structure of a graded ring.) In any category, a functor must induce a corresponding morphism. The pushforward is the morphism corresponding to the homology functor.
Definition for singular and simplicial homology
We build the pushforward homomorphism as follows (for singular or simplicial homology):
First we have an induced homomorphism between the singular or simplicial chain complex

 
  and 
 
 
 
  defined by composing each singular n-simplex


 
  with 
 
 
 
  to obtain a singular n-simplex of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 

 
 . Then we extend 
 
 
 
  linearly via 
 
 
 
 .
The maps 
 
 

 
  satisfy 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the boundary operator between chain groups, so 
 
 
 
  defines a chain map.
We have that 
 
 
 
  takes cycles to cycles, since 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 . Also 
 
 
 
  takes boundaries to boundaries since 
 
 
 
 .
Hence 
 
 
 
  induces a homomorphism between the homology groups 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Properties and homotopy invariance
Two basic properties of the push-forward are:



 
  for the composition of maps 
 
 
 
 .


 
  where 
 
 

 
  refers to identity function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  refers to the identity isomorphism of homology groups.


 A main result about the push-forward is the homotopy invariance: if two maps 
 
 
 
  are homotopic, then they induce the same homomorphism 
 
 
 
 .
This immediately implies that the homology groups of homotopy equivalent spaces are isomorphic:
The maps 
 
 
 
  induced by a homotopy equivalence 
 
 

 
  are isomorphisms for all 
 
 
 
 .
