   Symplectomorphism      Symplectomorphism   In mathematics , a symplectomorphism or symplectic map is an isomorphism in the category of symplectic manifolds . In classical mechanics , a symplectomorphism represents a transformation of phase space that is volume-preserving and preserves the symplectic structure of phase space, and is called a canonical transformation .  Formal definition  A diffeomorphism between two symplectic manifolds     f  :    (  M  ,  ω  )   →   (  N  ,   ω  ′   )       normal-:  f   normal-→   M  ω    N   superscript  ω  normal-′       f:(M,\omega)\rightarrow(N,\omega^{\prime})   is called a symplectomorphism if         f  *    ω  ′    =  ω   ,         superscript  f     superscript  ω  normal-′    ω    f^{*}\omega^{\prime}=\omega,   where    f  *     superscript  f     f^{*}   is the pullback of   f   f   f   . The symplectic diffeomorphisms from   M   M   M   to   M   M   M   are a (pseudo-)group, called the symplectomorphism group (see below).  The infinitesimal version of symplectomorphisms gives the symplectic vector fields. A vector field    X  ∈    Γ  ∞    (   T  M   )        X     superscript  normal-Γ      T  M      X\in\Gamma^{\infty}(TM)   is called symplectic if        ℒ  X   ω   =  0.         subscript  ℒ  X   ω   0.    \mathcal{L}_{X}\omega=0.   Also,   X   X   X   is symplectic iff the flow     ϕ  t   :   M  →  M      normal-:   subscript  ϕ  t    normal-→  M  M     \phi_{t}:M\rightarrow M   of   X   X   X   is symplectic for every   t   t   t   . These vector fields build a Lie subalgebra of     Γ  ∞    (   T  M   )        superscript  normal-Γ      T  M     \Gamma^{\infty}(TM)   .  Examples of symplectomorphisms include the canonical transformations of classical mechanics and theoretical physics , the flow associated to any Hamiltonian function, the map on cotangent bundles induced by any diffeomorphism of manifolds, and the coadjoint action of an element of a Lie Group on a coadjoint orbit .  Flows  Any smooth function on a symplectic manifold gives rise, by definition, to a Hamiltonian vector field and the set of all such form a subalgebra of the Lie Algebra of symplectic vector fields . The integration of the flow of a symplectic vector field is a symplectomorphism. Since symplectomorphisms preserve the symplectic 2-form and hence the symplectic volume form , Liouville's theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics follows. Symplectomorphisms that arise from Hamiltonian vector fields are known as Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms.  Since  the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field also preserves H . In physics this is interpreted as the law of conservation of energy .  If the first Betti number of a connected symplectic manifold is zero, symplectic and Hamiltonian vector fields coincide, so the notions of Hamiltonian isotopy and symplectic isotopy of symplectomorphisms coincide.  We can show that the equations for a geodesic may be formulated as a Hamiltonian flow.  The group of (Hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms  The symplectomorphisms from a manifold back onto itself form an infinite-dimensional pseudogroup . The corresponding Lie algebra consists of symplectic vector fields. The Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms form a subgroup, whose Lie algebra is given by the Hamiltonian vector fields. The latter is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of smooth functions on the manifold with respect to the Poisson bracket , modulo the constants.  The group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of    (  M  ,  ω  )     M  ω    (M,\omega)   usually denoted as    Ham   (  M  ,  ω  )      Ham   M  ω     \mathop{\rm Ham}(M,\omega)   .  Groups of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms are simple , by a theorem of Banyaga . They have natural geometry given by the Hofer norm . The homotopy type of the symplectomorphism group for certain simple symplectic four-manifolds , such as the product of spheres , can be computed using Gromov 's theory of pseudoholomorphic curves .  Comparison with Riemannian geometry  Unlike Riemannian manifolds , symplectic manifolds are not very rigid: Darboux's theorem shows that all symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally isomorphic. In contrast, isometries in Riemannian geometry must preserve the Riemann curvature tensor , which is thus a local invariant of the Riemannian manifold. Moreover, every function H on a symplectic manifold defines a Hamiltonian vector field  X H , which exponentiates to a one-parameter group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. It follows that the group of symplectomorphisms is always very large, and in particular, infinite-dimensional. On the other hand, the group of isometries of a Riemannian manifold is always a (finite-dimensional) Lie group . Moreover, Riemannian manifolds with large symmetry groups are very special, and a generic Riemannian manifold has no nontrivial symmetries.  Quantizations  Representations of finite-dimensional subgroups of the group of symplectomorphisms (after ħ-deformations, in general) on Hilbert spaces are called quantizations . When the Lie group is the one defined by a Hamiltonian, it is called a "quantization by energy". The corresponding operator from the Lie algebra to the Lie algebra of continuous linear operators is also sometimes called the quantization ; this is a more common way of looking at it in physics.  Arnold conjecture  A celebrated conjecture of Vladimir Arnold relates the minimum number of fixed points for a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism ƒ on M , in case M is a closed manifold , to Morse theory . More precisely, the conjecture states that ƒ has at least as many fixed points as the number of critical points a smooth function on M must have (understood as for a generic case, Morse functions , for which this is a definite finite number which is at least 2).  It is known that this would follow from the Arnold–Givental conjecture named after Arnold and Alexander Givental , which is a statement on Lagrangian submanifolds . It is proven in many cases by the construction of symplectic Floer homology .  See also  References    .   . See section 3.2 .    Symplectomorphism groups:     .   .
