   Lee-Kesler method      Lee-Kesler method   The Lee-Kesler method  1 allows the estimation of the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature for all components for which the critical pressure P c , the critical temperature T c , and the acentric factor ω are known.  Equations       ln   P  r    =    f   (  0  )    +   ω  ⋅   f   (  1  )             subscript  P  r       superscript  f  0    normal-⋅  ω   superscript  f  1       \ln P_{r}=f^{(0)}+\omega\cdot f^{(1)}        f   (  0  )    =    5.92714  -   6.09648   T  r    -   1.28862  ⋅   ln   T  r      +   0.169347  ⋅   T  r  6          superscript  f  0       5.92714    6.09648   subscript  T  r     normal-⋅  1.28862     subscript  T  r       normal-⋅  0.169347   superscript   subscript  T  r   6       f^{(0)}=5.92714-\frac{6.09648}{T_{r}}-1.28862\cdot\ln T_{r}+0.169347\cdot T_{r%

 ^{6}     with       P  r   =   P   P  c         subscript  P  r     P   subscript  P  c      P_{r}=\frac{P}{P_{c}}   ( reduced pressure ) and     T  r   =   T   T  c         subscript  T  r     T   subscript  T  c      T_{r}=\frac{T}{T_{c}}   ( reduced temperature ).  Typical errors  The prediction error can be up to 10% for polar components and small pressures and the calculated pressure is typically too low. For pressures above 1 bar, that means, above the normal boiling point, the typical errors are below 2%. 2  Example calculation  For benzene with   T c = 562.12 K 3  P c = 4898 kPa 4  T b = 353.15 K 5  ω = 0.2120 6   the following calculation for T=T b results:   T r = 353.15 / 562.12 = 0.628247  f (0) = -3.167428  f (1) = -3.429560  P r = exp( f (0) + ω f (1) ) = 0.020354  P = P r * P c = 99.69 kPa   The correct result would be P = 101.325 kPa, the normal (atmospheric) pressure. The deviation is -1.63 kPa or -1.61 %.  It is important to use the same absolute units for T and T c as well as for P and P c . The unit system used (K or R for T) is irrelevant because of the usage of the reduced values T r and P r .
