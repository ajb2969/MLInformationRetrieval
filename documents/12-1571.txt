Lee-Kesler method

The Lee-Kesler method 1 allows the estimation of the saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature for all components for which the critical pressure Pc, the critical temperature Tc, and the acentric factor ω are known.
Equations

  (reduced pressure) and 
 
 
 
  (reduced temperature).
Typical errors
The prediction error can be up to 10% for polar components and small pressures and the calculated pressure is typically too low. For pressures above 1 bar, that means, above the normal boiling point, the typical errors are below 2%. 2
Example calculation
For benzene with

Tc = 562.12 K3
Pc = 4898 kPa4
Tb = 353.15 K5
ω = 0.21206

the following calculation for T=Tb results:

Tr = 353.15 / 562.12 = 0.628247
f(0) = -3.167428
f(1) = -3.429560
Pr = exp( f(0) + ω f(1) ) = 0.020354
P = Pr * Pc = 99.69 kPa

The correct result would be P = 101.325 kPa, the normal (atmospheric) pressure. The deviation is -1.63 kPa or -1.61 %.
It is important to use the same absolute units for T and Tc as well as for P and Pc. The unit system used (K or R for T) is irrelevant because of the usage of the reduced values Tr and Pr.
