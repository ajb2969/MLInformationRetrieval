Vantieghems theorem

In number theory, Vantieghems theorem is a primality criterion. It states that a natural number n is prime if and only if



Similarly, n is prime, if and only if the following congruence for polynomials in X holds:



or:



Example
Let n=7 forming the product 1*3*7*15*31*63 = 615195. 615195 = 7 mod 127 and so 7 is prime
 Let n=9 forming the product 1*3*7*15*31*63*127*255 = 19923090075. 19923090075 = 301 mod 511 and so 9 is composite
