Moore space (algebraic topology)


See also Moore space for other meanings in mathematics.


In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, Moore space is the name given to a particular type of topological space that is the homology analogue of the Eilenberg–Maclane spaces of homotopy theory.
Formal definition
Given an abelian group G and an integer n ≥ 1, let X be a CW complex such that



and



for i ≠ n, where Hn(X) denotes the n-th singular homology group of X and 
 
 
 
 
  is the ith reduced homology group. Then X is said to be a Moore space.
Examples
