   Moore space (algebraic topology)      Moore space (algebraic topology)    See also Moore space for other meanings in mathematics.    In algebraic topology , a branch of mathematics , Moore space is the name given to a particular type of topological space that is the homology analogue of the Eilenberg–Maclane spaces of homotopy theory .  Formal definition  Given an abelian group  G and an integer  n ≥ 1, let X be a CW complex such that        H  n    (  X  )    ≅  G         subscript  H  n   X   G    H_{n}(X)\cong G     and         H  ~   i    (  X  )    ≅  0         subscript   normal-~  H   i   X   0    \tilde{H}_{i}(X)\cong 0     for i ≠ n , where H n ( X ) denotes the n -th singular homology group of X and      H  ~   i    (  X  )        subscript   normal-~  H   i   X    \tilde{H}_{i}(X)   is the i th reduced homology group. Then X is said to be a Moore space .  Examples       S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   is a Moore space of   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   for    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   .        ℝ   ℙ  2       ℝ   superscript  ℙ  2     \mathbb{RP}^{2}   is a Moore space of     ℤ  /  2   ℤ        ℤ  2   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}   (n=1).   References   Hatcher, Allen .
