Alpha-glucuronidase

For beta-glucuronidase, see Beta-glucuronidase
In enzymology, an alpha-glucuronidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an alpha-D-glucuronoside + H2O 
 
 
 
  an alcohol + D-glucuronate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-D-glucuronoside and H2O, whereas its two products are alcohol and D-glucuronate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, to be specific those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucosiduronate glucuronohydrolase. This enzyme is also called alpha-glucosiduronase.
Structural studies
