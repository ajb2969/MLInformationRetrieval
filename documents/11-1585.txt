Polyphosphate kinase

In enzymology, a polyphosphate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of polyphosphate from ATP, with chain lengths of up to a thousand or more orthophosphate molecules.1

ATP + (phosphate)n

 
  ADP + (phosphate)n+1


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and (phosphate)n, whereas its two products are ADP and (phosphate)n+1.
It is a membrane protein and goes through an intermediate stage during the reaction where it is autophosphorylated with a phosphate group covalently linked to a basic amino acid residue through an N-P bond.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:polyphosphate phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called polyphosphoric acid kinase. This enzyme participates in oxidative phosphorylation.
