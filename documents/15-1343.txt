5-methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase

5-methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein Co-methyltransferase (, cdhD (gene), cdhE (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 5-methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction:

[methyl-Co(III) corrinoid Fe-S protein] + tetrahydrosarcinapterin

 
  [Co(I) corrinoid Fe-S protein] + 5-methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin
 

This enzyme catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from the cobamide cofactor of a corrinoid/Fe-S protein to the N5 group of tetrahydrosarcinapterin.
