   Shelah cardinal      Shelah cardinal   In axiomatic set theory , Shelah cardinals are a kind of large cardinals . A cardinal    κ   κ   \kappa   is called Shelah iff for every    f  :   κ  →  κ      normal-:  f   normal-→  κ  κ     f:\kappa\rightarrow\kappa   , there exists a transitive class    N   N   N   and an elementary embedding     j  :   V  →  N      normal-:  j   normal-→  V  N     j:V\rightarrow N   with critical point    κ   κ   \kappa   ; and     V   j   (  f  )    (  κ  )     ⊂  N       subscript  V    j  f  κ    N    V_{j(f)(\kappa)}\subset N   .  A Shelah cardinal has a normal ultrafilter containing the set of weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals below it.
