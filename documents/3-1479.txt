Shelah cardinal

In axiomatic set theory, Shelah cardinals are a kind of large cardinals. A cardinal

 
  is called Shelah iff for every 
 
 
 
 , there exists a transitive class

 
  and an elementary embedding

 
  with critical point

 
 ; and 
 
 
 
 .
A Shelah cardinal has a normal ultrafilter containing the set of weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals below it.
