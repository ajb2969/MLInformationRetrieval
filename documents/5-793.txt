   Coplanarity      Coplanarity   In geometry , a set of points in space are coplanar if there exists a geometric plane that contains them all. For example, three points are always coplanar, and if the points are distinct and non-collinear , the plane they determine is unique. However, a set of four or more distinct points will, in general, not lie in a single plane.  Two lines in three-dimensional space are coplanar if there is a plane that includes them both. This occurs if the lines are parallel , or if they intersect each other. Two lines that are not coplanar are called skew lines .  Distance geometry provides a solution technique for the problem of determining whether a set of points is coplanar, knowing only the distances between them.  Properties  In three-dimensional space, two independent vectors with the same initial point determine a plane through that point. Their cross product is a normal vector to that plane, and any vector orthogonal to this cross product through the initial point will lie in the plane. 1 This leads to the following coplanarity test. Four distinct points, x 1 , x 2 , x 3 and x 4 are coplanar if and only if,        (    x  3   -   x  1    )   ⋅   [    (    x  2   -   x  1    )   ×   (    x  4   -   x  3    )    ]    =  0.       normal-⋅     subscript  x  3    subscript  x  1     delimited-[]       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1       subscript  x  4    subscript  x  3       0.    (x_{3}-x_{1})\cdot[(x_{2}-x_{1})\times(x_{4}-x_{3})]=0.     If three vectors    𝐚  ,  𝐛     𝐚  𝐛    \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}   and   𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}   are coplanar, then          (   𝐜  ⋅   𝐚  ^    )    𝐚  ^    +    (   𝐜  ⋅   𝐛  ^    )    𝐛  ^     =  𝐜   ,           normal-⋅  𝐜   normal-^  𝐚     normal-^  𝐚       normal-⋅  𝐜   normal-^  𝐛     normal-^  𝐛     𝐜    (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}})\mathbf{\hat{a}}+(\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\hat%
 {b}})\mathbf{\hat{b}}=\mathbf{c},     where    𝐚  ^     normal-^  𝐚    \mathbf{\hat{a}}   denotes the unit vector in the direction of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   . That is, the vector projections of   𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}   on   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   and   𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}   on   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   add to give the original   𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}   .  Coplanarity of points whose coordinates are given  In coordinate geometry , in n -dimensional space, a set of four or more distinct points are coplanar if and only if the matrix of the coordinates of these points is of rank 2 or less. For example, given four points, W = ( w 1 , w 2 , ... , w n ), X = ( x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n ), Y = ( y 1 , y 2 , ... , y n ), and Z = ( z 1 , z 2 , ... , z n ), if the matrix      [      w  1      w  2     …     w  n        x  1      x  2     …     x  n        y  1      y  2     …     y  n        z  1      z  2     …     z  n      ]       subscript  w  1    subscript  w  2   normal-…   subscript  w  n      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-…   subscript  y  n      subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2   normal-…   subscript  z  n      \begin{bmatrix}w_{1}&w_{2}&\dots&w_{n}\\
 x_{1}&x_{2}&\dots&x_{n}\\
 y_{1}&y_{2}&\dots&y_{n}\\
 z_{1}&z_{2}&\dots&z_{n}\end{bmatrix}   is of rank 2 or less, the four points are coplanar.  Geometric shapes  A skew polygon is a polygon whose vertices are not coplanar. Such a polygon must have at least four vertices; there are no skew triangles.  A polyhedron that has positive volume has vertices that are not all coplanar.
