   Codeinone reductase (NADPH)      Codeinone reductase (NADPH)   In enzymology , a codeinone reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   codeine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   codeinone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are codeine and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are codeinone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is codeine:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
