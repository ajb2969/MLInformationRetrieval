Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion

The Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion is a condition for linear stability (sometimes called spectral stability) of solitary wave solutions to a wide class of U(1)-invariant Hamiltonian systems, named after Russian scientists Aleksandr Kolokolov (Александр Александрович Колоколов) and Nazib Vakhitov (Назиб Галиевич Вахитов). The condition for linear stability of a solitary wave

 
  with frequency 
 
 
 
  has the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the charge (or momentum) of the solitary wave 
 
 
 
 , conserved by Noether's theorem due to U(1)-invariance of the system.
Original formulation
Originally, this criterion was obtained for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation,


 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a smooth real-valued function. The solution 
 
 
 
  is assumed to be complex-valued. Since the equation is U(1)-invariant, by Noether's theorem, it has an integral of motion, 
 
 
 
 , which is called charge or momentum, depending on the model under consideration. For a wide class of functions 
 
 
 
 , the nonlinear Schrödinger equation admits solitary wave solutions of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  decays for large 
 
 
 
  (one often requires that 
 
 
 
  belongs to the Sobolev space

 
 ). Usually such solutions exist for 
 
 
 
  from an interval or collection of intervals of a real line. Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion,1 2


 
  is a condition of spectral stability of a solitary wave solution. Namely, if this condition is satisfied at a particular value of 
 
 
 
 , then the linearization at the solitary wave with this 
 
 
 
  has no spectrum in the right half-plane.
This result is based on an earlier work3 by Vladimir Zakharov.
Generalizations
This result has been generalized to abstract Hamiltonian systems with U(1)-invariance .4 It was shown that under rather general conditions the Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion guarantees not only spectral stability but also orbital stability of solitary waves.
The stability condition has been generalized 5 to traveling wave solutions to the generalized Korteweg–de Vries equation of the form


 
 .
The stability condition has also been generalized to Hamiltonian systems with a more general symmetry group .6
