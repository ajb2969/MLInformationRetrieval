Cyanophycin synthase (L-aspartate-adding)

Cyanophycin synthase (L-aspartate-adding) (, CphA, CphA1, CphA2, cyanophycin synthetase, multi-L-arginyl-poly-L-aspartate synthase) is an enzyme with system name cyanophycin:L-aspartate ligase (ADP-forming).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + [L-Asp(4-L-Arg)]n + L-Asp 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + [L-Asp(4-L-Arg)]n-L-Asp
 

This enzyme requires Mg2+ for activity.
