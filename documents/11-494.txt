Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase

In enzymology, a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a glycerophosphodiester + H2O 
 
 
 
  an alcohol + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycerophosphodiester and H2O, whereas its two products are alcohol and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycerophosphodiester glycerophosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include gene hpd protein, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, and IgD-binding protein D. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
