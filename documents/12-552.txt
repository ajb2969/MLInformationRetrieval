   C space      C space   In the mathematical field of functional analysis , the space denoted by c is the vector space of all convergent sequences ( x n ) of real numbers or complex numbers . When equipped with the uniform norm :        ∥  x  ∥   ∞   =    sup  n    |   x  n   |         subscript   norm  x       subscript  supremum  n      subscript  x  n       \|x\|_{\infty}=\sup_{n}|x_{n}|     the space c becomes a Banach space . It is a closed  linear subspace of the space of bounded sequences , ℓ ∞ , and contains as a closed subspace the Banach space c 0 of sequences converging to zero. The dual of c is isometrically isomorphic to ℓ 1 , as is that of c 0 . In particular, neither c nor c 0 is reflexive .  In the first case, the isomorphism of ℓ 1 with c * is given as follows. If ( x 0 , x 1 ,...) ∈ ℓ 1 , then the pairing with an element ( y 1 , y 2 ,...) in c is given by         x  0     lim   n  →  ∞     y  n     +    ∑   i  =  1   ∞     x  i    y  i      .         subscript  x  0     subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  y  n       superscript   subscript     i  1         subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i       x_{0}\lim_{n\to\infty}y_{n}+\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}x_{i}y_{i}.     This is the Riesz representation theorem on the ordinal ω.  For c 0 , the pairing between ( x i ) in ℓ 1 and ( y i ) in c 0 is given by        ∑   i  =  0   ∞     x  i    y  i     .      superscript   subscript     i  0         subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i      \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_{i}y_{i}.
