   Spin–lattice relaxation in the rotating frame      Spin–lattice relaxation in the rotating frame   Spin–lattice relaxation in the rotating frame is the mechanism by which M xy , the transverse component of the magnetization vector, exponentially decays towards its equilibrium value of zero, under the influence of a radio frequency (RF) field in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is characterized by the spin–lattice relaxation time constant in the rotating frame, T 1ρ . It is named in contrast to T 1 , the spin-lattice relaxation time .  T 1ρ MRI is an alternative to conventional T 1 and T 2 MRI by its use of a long-duration, low-power radio frequency referred to as spin-lock (SL) pulse applied to the magnetization in the transverse plane. The magnetization is effectively spin-locked around an effective B 1 field created by the vector sum of the applied B 1 and any off-resonant component. The spin-locked magnetization will relax with a time constant T 1ρ , which is the time it takes for the magnetic resonance signal to reach 37% (1/e) of its initial value,     M   x  y     (  0  )        subscript  M    x  y    0    M_{xy}(0)   . Hence the relation:      M   x  y     (   t   S  L    )    =    M   x  y     (  0  )     e   -    t   S  L    /   T   1  r  h  o                subscript  M    x  y     subscript  t    S  L        subscript  M    x  y    0   superscript  e       subscript  t    S  L     subscript  T    1  r  h  o          M_{xy}(t_{SL})=M_{xy}(0)e^{-t_{SL}/T_{1rho}}\,   , where t SL is the duration of the RF field.  Measuring Spin–lattice relaxation in the rotating frame  T 1ρ can be quantified (relaxometry) by curve fitting the signal expression above as a function of the duration of the SL pulse while the amplitude of SL pulse (γB 1 ~0.1-few kHz) is fixed. Quantitative T 1ρ MRI relaxation maps reflect the biochemical composition of tissues. 1  T 1ρ MR images  T 1ρ MRI has been used to image tissues such as cartilage, 2 3 intervertebral discs, 4 brain, 5 6 and heart, 7 as well as certain types of cancers. 8 9  References     "  Category:Magnetic resonance imaging     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
