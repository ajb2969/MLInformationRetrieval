Herman ring

(Figure)
The Julia set of the cubic rational function e2πitz2(z−4)/(1−4z) with t=.6151732... chosen so that the rotation number is (√5−1)/2, which has a Herman ring (shaded).

In the mathematical discipline known as complex dynamics, the Herman ring is a Fatou component.1 where the rational function is conformally conjugate to an irrational rotation of the standard annulus.
Formal definition
Namely if ƒ possesses a Herman ring U with period p, then there exists a conformal mapping


 
 , such that



So the dynamics on the Herman ring is simple.
Name
It was introduced by, and later named after,  who first found and constructed this type of Fatou component.
Function

Polynomials do not have Herman rings.
Rational functions can have Herman rings
Transcendental entire maps do not have them2

Examples
Here is an example of a rational function which possesses a Herman ring.3



where 
 
 
 
 
  such that the rotation number of ƒ on the unit circle is 
 
 
 
 .
The picture shown on the right is the Julia set of ƒ: the curves in the white annulus are the orbits of some points under the iterations of ƒ while the dashed line denotes the unit circle.
There is an example of rational function that possesses a Herman ring, and some periodic parabolic Fatou components at the same time. 
Further, there is a rational function which possesses a Herman ring with period 2.  Here the expression of this rational function is



where



This example was constructed by quasiconformal surgery4 from the quadratic polynomial



which possesses a Siegel disk with period 2. The parameters a, b, c are calculated by trial and error.
Letting
$$\begin{align}
 a & = 0.14285933+0.06404502i, \\
 b & = 0.14362386+0.06461542i,\text{ and} \\
 c & = 0.18242894+0.81957139i,
 \end{align}$$
then the period of one of the Herman ring of ga,b,c is 3.
Shishikura also given an example:5 a rational function which possesses a Herman ring with period 2, but the parameters showed above are different from his.
So there is a question: How to find the formulas of the rational functions which possess Herman rings with higher period?
According to the result of Shishikura, if a rational function ƒ possesses a Herman ring, then the degree of ƒ is at least 3. There also exist meromorphic functions that possess Herman rings.
