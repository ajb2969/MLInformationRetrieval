   Fraňková–Helly selection theorem      Fraňková–Helly selection theorem   In mathematics , the Fraňková–Helly selection theorem is a generalisation of Helly's selection theorem for functions of bounded variation to the case of regulated functions . It was proved in 1991 by the Czech  mathematician  Dana Fraňková .  Background  Let X be a separable  Hilbert space , and let BV([0, T ]; X ) denote the normed vector space of all functions f : [0, T ] → X with finite total variation over the interval [0, T ], equipped with the total variation norm. It is well known that BV([0, T ]; X ) satisfies the compactness theorem known as Helly's selection theorem : given any sequence of functions ( f n ) n ∈ N in BV([0, T ]; X ) that is uniformly bounded in the total variation norm, there exists a subsequence       (   f   n   (  k  )     )   ⊆   (   f  n   )   ⊂   BV   (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )           subscript  f    n  k     subscript  f  n          BV    0  T   X       \left(f_{n(k)}\right)\subseteq(f_{n})\subset\mathrm{BV}([0,T];X)     and a limit function f ∈ BV([0, T ]; X ) such that f n ( k ) ( t ) converges weakly in X to f ( t ) for every t ∈ [0, T ]. That is, for every continuous linear functional  λ ∈ X *,        λ   (    f   n   (  k  )      (  t  )    )    →   λ   (   f   (  t  )    )   in  ℝ  as  k   →  ∞   .       normal-→    λ     subscript  f    n  k    t      λ    f  t   in  ℝ  as  k     normal-→        \lambda\left(f_{n(k)}(t)\right)\to\lambda(f(t))\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}\mbox{ as %
 }k\to\infty.     Consider now the Banach space Reg([0, T ]; X ) of all regulated functions f : [0, T ] → X , equipped with the supremum norm . Helly's theorem does not hold for the space Reg([0, T ]; X ): a counterexample is given by the sequence         f  n    (  t  )    =   sin   (   n  t   )     .         subscript  f  n   t       n  t      f_{n}(t)=\sin(nt).     One may ask, however, if a weaker selection theorem is true, and the Fraňková–Helly selection theorem is such a result.  Statement of the Fraňková–Helly selection theorem  As before, let X be a separable Hilbert space and let Reg([0, T ]; X ) denote the space of regulated functions f : [0, T ] → X , equipped with the supremum norm. Let ( f n ) n ∈ N be a sequence in Reg([0, T ]; X ) satisfying the following condition: for every ε > 0, there exists some L ε > 0 so that each f n may be approximated by a u n ∈ BV([0, T ]; X ) satisfying        ∥    f  n   -   u  n    ∥   ∞   <  ε       subscript   norm     subscript  f  n    subscript  u  n       ε    \|f_{n}-u_{n}\|_{\infty}<\varepsilon     and         |    u  n    (  0  )    |   +   Var   (   u  n   )     ≤   L  ε    ,             subscript  u  n   0      Var   subscript  u  n      subscript  L  ε     |u_{n}(0)|+\mathrm{Var}(u_{n})\leq L_{\varepsilon},     where |-| denotes the norm in X and Var( u ) denotes the variation of u , which is defined to be the supremum       sup  Π     ∑   j  =  1   m    |    u   (   t  j   )    -   u   (   t   j  -  1    )     |        subscript  supremum  normal-Π     superscript   subscript     j  1    m         u   subscript  t  j      u   subscript  t    j  1          \sup_{\Pi}\sum_{j=1}^{m}|u(t_{j})-u(t_{j-1})|     over all partitions      Π  =   {  0  =   t  0   <   t  1   <  …  <   t  m   =  T  ,  m  ∈  𝐍  }      fragments  Π    fragments  normal-{  0    subscript  t  0     subscript  t  1    normal-…    subscript  t  m    T  normal-,  m   N  normal-}     \Pi=\{0=t_{0}     of [0, T ]. Then there exists a subsequence       (   f   n   (  k  )     )   ⊆   (   f  n   )   ⊂   Reg   (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )           subscript  f    n  k     subscript  f  n          Reg    0  T   X       \left(f_{n(k)}\right)\subseteq(f_{n})\subset\mathrm{Reg}([0,T];X)     and a limit function f ∈ Reg([0, T ]; X ) such that f n ( k ) ( t ) converges weakly in X to f ( t ) for every t ∈ [0, T ]. That is, for every continuous linear functional λ ∈ X *,        λ   (    f   n   (  k  )      (  t  )    )    →   λ   (   f   (  t  )    )   in  ℝ  as  k   →  ∞   .       normal-→    λ     subscript  f    n  k    t      λ    f  t   in  ℝ  as  k     normal-→        \lambda\left(f_{n(k)}(t)\right)\to\lambda(f(t))\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}\mbox{ as %
