Other names

Truncated small rhombicosidodecahedron
Beveled icosidodecahedron

Zonohedron
As a zonohedron, it can be constructed with all but 30 octagons as regular polygons. It is 2-uniform, with 2 sets of 120 vertices existing on two distances from its center.
This polyhedron represents the Minkowski sum of a truncated icosidodecahedron, and a rhombic triacontahedron.1
Related polyhedra
The truncated icosidodecahedron is similar, with all regular faces, and 4.6.10 vertex figure.

 4.8.10 and 4.6.8



The truncated rhombicosidodecahedron can be seen in sequence of rectification and truncation operations from the icosidodecahedron. A further alternation step leads to the snub rhombicosidodecahedron.
