   Distortion problem      Distortion problem   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics, the distortion problem is to determine by how much one can distort the unit sphere in a given Banach space using an equivalent norm. Specifically, a Banach space X is called λ-distortable if there exists an equivalent norm | x | on X such that, for all infinite-dimensional subspaces Y in X ,        sup      y  1   ,   y  2    ∈  Y   ,    ∥   y  i   ∥   =  1       |   y  1   |    |   y  2   |     ≥  λ        subscript  supremum   formulae-sequence      subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2    Y      norm   subscript  y  i    1          subscript  y  1       subscript  y  2      λ    \sup_{y_{1},y_{2}\in Y,\|y_{i}\|=1}\frac{|y_{1}|}{|y_{2}|}\geq\lambda   (see distortion (mathematics) ). Note that every Banach space is trivially 1-distortable. A Banach space is called distortable if it is λ-distortable for some λ > 1 and it is called arbitrarily distortable if it is λ-distortable for any λ. Distortability first emerged as an important property of Banach spaces in the 1960s, where it was studied by  and .  James proved that c 0 and ℓ 1 are not distortable. Milman showed that if X is a Banach space that does not contain an isomorphic copy of c 0 or ℓ p for some  (see sequence space ), then some infinite-dimensional subspace of X is distortable. So the distortion problem is now primarily of interest on the spaces ℓ p , all of which are separable and uniform convex, for .  In separable and uniform convex spaces, distortability is easily seen to be equivalent to the ostensibly more general question of whether or not every real-valued Lipschitz function  ƒ defined on the sphere in X stabilizes on the sphere of an infinite dimensional subspace, i.e., whether there is a real number a ∈ R so that for every δ > 0 there is an infinite dimensional subspace Y of X , so that |a − ƒ ( y )| 1 there are Lipschitz functions which do not stabilize, although this space is not distortable by . In a separable Hilbert space , the distortion problem is equivalent to the question of whether there exist subsets of the unit sphere separated by a positive distance and yet intersect every infinite-dimensional closed subspace. Unlike many properties of Banach spaces, the distortion problem seems to be as difficult on Hilbert spaces as on other Banach spaces. On a separable Hilbert space, and for the other ℓ p -spaces, 1 2 is arbitrarily distortable, using the first known arbitrarily distortable space constructed by .
