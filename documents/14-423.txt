   Commensurator      Commensurator   In group theory , a branch of abstract algebra , the commensurator of a subgroup  H of a group  G is a specific subgroup of G .  Definition  The commensurator of a subgroup H of a group G , denoted comm G ( H ) or by some comm( H ), 1 is the set of all elements g of G that conjugate  H and leave the result commensurable with H . In other words         comm  G    (  H  )    =   {   g  ∈  G   :    g  H   g   -  1     ∩   H  has finite index in both  H  and  g  H   g   -  1      }    .         subscript  comm  G   H    conditional-set    g  G       g  H   superscript  g    1       H  has finite index in both  H  and  g  H   superscript  g    1         \mathrm{comm}_{G}(H)=\{g\in G:gHg^{-1}\cap H\text{ has finite index in both }H%
 \text{ and }gHg^{-1}\}.    2  Properties   comm G ( H ) is a subgroup of G .  comm G ( H ) = G for any compact open subgroup H .
