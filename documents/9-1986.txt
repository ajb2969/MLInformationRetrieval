It is also known as the Singh–Maddala distribution 2 and is one of a number of different distributions sometimes called the "generalized log-logistic distribution ". It is most commonly used to model household income (See: Household income in the U.S. and compare to magenta graph at right).  The Burr (Type XII) distribution has probability density function : 3 4       f   (  x  ;  c  ,  k  )    =   c  k     x   c  -  1      (   1  +   x  c    )    k  +  1             f   x  c  k      c  k     superscript  x    c  1     superscript    1   superscript  x  c      k  1        f(x;c,k)=ck\frac{x^{c-1}}{(1+x^{c})^{k+1}}\!     and cumulative distribution function :        F   (  x  ;  c  ,  k  )    =   1  -    (   1  +   x  c    )    -  k      .        F   x  c  k      1   superscript    1   superscript  x  c      k       F(x;c,k)=1-\left(1+x^{c}\right)^{-k}.     Note when c =1, the Burr distribution becomes the Pareto Type II distribution . When k =1, the Burr distribution is a special case of the Champernowne distribution , often referred to as the Fisk distribution . 5 6  The Burr Type XII distribution is a member of a system of continuous distributions introduced by Irving W. Burr (1942), which comprises 12 distributions. 7  See also   Dagum distribution , also known as the inverse Burr Distribution.
