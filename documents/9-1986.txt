In probability theory, statistics and econometrics, the Burr Type XII distribution or simply the Burr distribution1 is a continuous probability distribution for a non-negative random variable. It is also known as the Singh–Maddala distribution2 and is one of a number of different distributions sometimes called the "generalized log-logistic distribution". It is most commonly used to model household income (See: Household income in the U.S. and compare to magenta graph at right).
The Burr (Type XII) distribution has probability density function:34



and cumulative distribution function:



Note when c=1, the Burr distribution becomes the Pareto Type II distribution. When k=1, the Burr distribution is a special case of the Champernowne distribution, often referred to as the Fisk distribution.56
The Burr Type XII distribution is a member of a system of continuous distributions introduced by Irving W. Burr (1942), which comprises 12 distributions.7
