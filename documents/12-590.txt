   Stokes stream function      Stokes stream function   In fluid dynamics , the Stokes stream function is used to describe the streamlines and flow velocity in a three-dimensional incompressible flow with axisymmetry . A surface with a constant value of the Stokes stream function encloses a streamtube , everywhere tangential to the flow velocity vectors. Further, the volume  flux within this streamtube is constant, and all the streamlines of the flow are located on this surface. The velocity field associated with the Stokes stream function is solenoidal —it has zero divergence . This stream function is named in honor of George Gabriel Stokes .  Cylindrical coordinates  Consider a cylindrical coordinate system ( ρ , φ , z ), with the z –axis the line around which the incompressible flow is axisymmetrical, φ the azimuthal angle and ρ the distance to the z –axis. Then the flow velocity components u ρ and u z can be expressed in terms of the Stokes stream function   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   by: 1      u  ρ     subscript  u  ρ    \displaystyle u_{\rho}     The azimuthal velocity component u φ does not depend on the stream function. Due to the axisymmetry, all three velocity components ( u ρ , u φ , u z ) only depend on ρ and z and not on the azimuth φ .  The volume flux, through the surface bounded by a constant value ψ of the Stokes stream function, is equal to 2π ψ .  Spherical coordinates  In spherical coordinates ( r , θ , φ ), r is the radial distance from the origin , θ is the zenith angle and φ is the azimuthal angle . In axisymmetric flow, with θ = 0 the rotational symmetry axis, the quantities describing the flow are again independent of the azimuth φ . The flow velocity components u r and u θ are related to the Stokes stream function   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   through: 2      u  r     subscript  u  r    \displaystyle u_{r}     Again, the azimuthal velocity component u φ is not a function of the Stokes stream function ψ . The volume flux through a stream tube, bounded by a surface of constant ψ , equals 2π ψ , as before.  Vorticity  The vorticity is defined as:      𝝎  =   ∇  ×  𝒖   =   ∇  ×  ∇  ×  𝝍         𝝎    normal-∇  𝒖          normal-∇  normal-∇  𝝍      \boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}=\nabla\times\nabla\times%
 \boldsymbol{\psi}   , where     𝝍  =   -    Ψ   r   sin  θ      ϕ  ^      ,      𝝍        normal-Ψ    r    θ      bold-^  bold-italic-ϕ       \boldsymbol{\psi}=-\frac{\Psi}{r\sin\theta}\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}},     with    ϕ  ^     bold-^  bold-italic-ϕ    \boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}   the unit vector in the    ϕ    ϕ   \phi\,   –direction.        Derivation of vorticity   𝝎   𝝎   \boldsymbol{\omega}   using a Stokes stream function       Consider the vorticity as defined by       𝝎  =   ∇  ×  𝒖    .      𝝎    normal-∇  𝒖     \boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}.   From the definition of the curl in spherical coordinates :      ω  r     subscript  ω  r    \displaystyle\omega_{r}   First notice that the   r   r   r   and   θ   θ   \theta   components are equal to 0. Secondly substitute    u  r     subscript  u  r    u_{r}   and    u  θ     subscript  u  θ    u_{\theta}   into     ω  ϕ   .     subscript  ω  ϕ    \omega_{\phi}.   The result is:      ω  r     subscript  ω  r    \displaystyle\omega_{r}   Next the following algebra is performed:      ω  ϕ     subscript  ω  ϕ    \displaystyle\omega_{\phi}          As a result, from the calculation the vorticity vector is found to be equal to:       𝝎  =   (     0      0       -    1   r   sin  θ      (      ∂  2   Ψ    ∂   r  2     +     sin  θ    r  2     ∂   ∂  θ     (    1   sin  θ      ∂  Ψ    ∂  θ     )     )        )    .      𝝎    0    0          1    r    θ           superscript   2   normal-Ψ      superscript  r  2           θ    superscript  r  2         θ        1    θ        normal-Ψ     θ             \boldsymbol{\omega}=\begin{pmatrix}0\\

 \theta}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial\theta}\right)\right)\end{pmatrix}.     Comparison with cylindrical  The cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems are related through      z  =    r    cos   (  θ  )         z    r    θ      z=r\,\cos(\theta)\,   and     ρ  =    r    sin   (  θ  )      .      ρ    r    θ      \rho=r\,\sin(\theta).\,     Alternative definition with opposite sign  As explained in the general stream function article, definitions using an opposite sign convention – for the relationship between the Stokes stream function and flow velocity – are also in use. 3  Zero divergence  In cylindrical coordinates, the divergence of the velocity field u becomes: 4      ∇  ⋅  𝒖     normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝒖    \displaystyle\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}   as expected for an incompressible flow.  And in spherical coordinates: 5      ∇  ⋅  𝒖     normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝒖    \displaystyle\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}     Streamlines as curves of constant stream function  From calculus it is known that the gradient vector    ∇  Ψ     normal-∇  normal-Ψ    \nabla\Psi   is normal to the curve    Ψ  =  C      normal-Ψ  C    \Psi=C   (see e.g. Level set#Level sets versus the gradient ). If it is shown that everywhere      𝒖  ⋅   ∇  Ψ    =  0   ,       normal-⋅  𝒖   normal-∇  normal-Ψ    0    \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\Psi=0,   using the formula for   𝒖   𝒖   \boldsymbol{u}   in terms of    Ψ  ,    normal-Ψ   \Psi,   then this proves that level curves of   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   are streamlines.   Cylindrical coordinates:   In cylindrical coordinates,       ∇  Ψ   =      ∂  Ψ    ∂  ρ     𝒆  ρ    +     ∂  Ψ    ∂  z     𝒆  z          normal-∇  normal-Ψ           normal-Ψ     ρ     subscript  𝒆  ρ          normal-Ψ     z     subscript  𝒆  z       \nabla\Psi={\partial\Psi\over\partial\rho}\boldsymbol{e}_{\rho}+{\partial\Psi%

So that       ∇   Ψ  ⋅  𝒖    =      ∂  Ψ    ∂  ρ     (   -    1  ρ     ∂  Ψ    ∂  z      )    +     ∂  Ψ    ∂  z     1  ρ     ∂  Ψ    ∂  ρ      =  0.         normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-Ψ  𝒖            normal-Ψ     ρ          1  ρ       normal-Ψ     z             normal-Ψ     z      1  ρ       normal-Ψ     ρ           0.     \nabla\Psi\cdot\boldsymbol{u}={\partial\Psi\over\partial\rho}(-{1\over\rho}{%

 \partial\Psi\over\partial\rho}=0.      Spherical coordinates:   And in spherical coordinates       ∇  Ψ   =      ∂  Ψ    ∂  r     𝒆  r    +    1  r     ∂  Ψ    ∂  θ     𝒆  θ          normal-∇  normal-Ψ           normal-Ψ     r     subscript  𝒆  r        1  r       normal-Ψ     θ     subscript  𝒆  θ       \nabla\Psi={\partial\Psi\over\partial r}\boldsymbol{e}_{r}+{1\over r}{\partial%
 \Psi\over\partial\theta}\boldsymbol{e}_{\theta}     and       𝒖  =     u  r    𝒆  r    +    u  θ    𝒆  θ     =     1    r  2    sin   (  θ  )        ∂  Ψ    ∂  θ     𝒆  r    -    1   r   sin   (  θ  )        ∂  Ψ    ∂  r     𝒆  θ      .        𝒖       subscript  u  r    subscript  𝒆  r       subscript  u  θ    subscript  𝒆  θ                1     superscript  r  2     θ         normal-Ψ     θ     subscript  𝒆  r        1    r    θ         normal-Ψ     r     subscript  𝒆  θ        \boldsymbol{u}=u_{r}\boldsymbol{e}_{r}+u_{\theta}\boldsymbol{e}_{\theta}={1%
 \over r^{2}\sin(\theta)}{\partial\Psi\over\partial\theta}\boldsymbol{e}_{r}-{1%
 \over r\sin(\theta)}{\partial\Psi\over\partial r}\boldsymbol{e}_{\theta}.     So that       ∇   Ψ  ⋅  𝒖    =       ∂  Ψ    ∂  r    ⋅   1    r  2    sin   (  θ  )         ∂  Ψ    ∂  θ     +     1  r     ∂  Ψ    ∂  θ     ⋅   (   -    1   r   sin   (  θ  )        ∂  Ψ    ∂  r      )     =  0.         normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-Ψ  𝒖         normal-⋅      normal-Ψ     r      1     superscript  r  2     θ          normal-Ψ     θ      normal-⋅      1  r       normal-Ψ     θ           1    r    θ         normal-Ψ     r             0.     \nabla\Psi\cdot\boldsymbol{u}={\partial\Psi\over\partial r}\cdot{1\over r^{2}%
