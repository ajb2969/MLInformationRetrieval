   Conic bundle      Conic bundle   In algebraic geometry , a conic bundle is an algebraic variety that appears as a solution of a Cartesian equation of the form         X  2   +   a  X  Y   +   b   Y  2     =   P   (  T  )     .         superscript  X  2     a  X  Y     b   superscript  Y  2       P  T     X^{2}+aXY+bY^{2}=P(T).\,     Theoretically, it can be considered as a Severi–Brauer surface , or more precisely as a Châtelet surface . This can be a double covering of a ruled surface . Through an isomorphism, it can be associated with a symbol    (  a  ,  P  )     a  P    (a,P)   in the second Galois cohomology of the field   k   k   k   .  In fact, it is a surface with a well-understood divisor class group and simplest cases share with Del Pezzo surfaces the property of being a rational surface . But many problems of contemporary mathematics remain open, notably (for those examples which are not rational) the question of unirationality .  A naive point of view  To write correctly a conic bundle, one must first reduce the quadratic form of the left hand side. Thus, after a harmless change, it has a simple expression like         X  2   -   a   Y  2     =   P   (  T  )     .         superscript  X  2     a   superscript  Y  2       P  T     X^{2}-aY^{2}=P(T).\,     In a second step, it should be placed in a projective space in order to complete the surface "at infinity".  To do this, we write the equation in homogeneous coordinates and expresses the first visible part of the fiber         X  2   -   a   Y  2     =   P   (  T  )    Z  2     .         superscript  X  2     a   superscript  Y  2       P  T   superscript  Z  2      X^{2}-aY^{2}=P(T)Z^{2}.\,     That is not enough to complete the fiber as non-singular (clean and smooth), and then glue it to infinity by a change of classical maps:  Seen from infinity, (i.e. through the change    T  ↦   T  ′   =   1  T        maps-to  T   superscript  T  normal-′          1  T      T\mapsto T^{\prime}=\frac{1}{T}   ), the same fiber (excepted the fibers    T  =  0      T  0    T=0   and     T  ′   =  0       superscript  T  normal-′   0    T^{\prime}=0   ), written as the set of solutions      X   ′  2    -   a   Y   ′  2      =    P  *    (   T  ′   )    Z   ′  2            superscript  X   normal-′  2      a   superscript  Y   normal-′  2         superscript  P     superscript  T  normal-′    superscript  Z   normal-′  2       X^{\prime 2}-aY^{\prime 2}=P^{*}(T^{\prime})Z^{\prime 2}   where     P  *    (   T  ′   )        superscript  P     superscript  T  normal-′     P^{*}(T^{\prime})   appears naturally as the reciprocal polynomial of   P   P   P   . Details are below about the map-change    [    x  ′   :   y  ′   :   z  ′    ]     delimited-[]     normal-:   superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  y  normal-′     normal-:     superscript  z  normal-′       [x^{\prime}:y^{\prime}:z^{\prime}]   .  The fiber c  Going a little further, while simplifying the issue, limit to cases where the field   k   k   k   is of characteristic zero and denote by   m   m   m   any integer except zero. Denote by P ( T ) a polynomial with coefficients in the field   k   k   k   , of degree 2 m or 2 m − 1, without multiple root. Consider the scalar a .  One defines the reciprocal polynomial by      P  *    (   T  ′   )    =    T   2  m    P   (   1  T   )           superscript  P     superscript  T  normal-′       superscript  T    2  m    P    1  T      P^{*}(T^{\prime})=T^{2m}P(\frac{1}{T})   , and the conic bundle F a , P as follows :   Definition:       F   a  ,  P      subscript  F   a  P     F_{a,P}   is the surface obtained as "gluing" of the two surfaces   U   U   U   and    U  ′     superscript  U  normal-′    U^{\prime}   of equations        X  2   -   a   Y  2     =   P   (  T  )    Z  2           superscript  X  2     a   superscript  Y  2       P  T   superscript  Z  2      X^{2}-aY^{2}=P(T)Z^{2}     and        X   ′  2    -   Y   ′  2     =   P   (   T  ′   )    Z   ′  2            superscript  X   normal-′  2     superscript  Y   normal-′  2       P   superscript  T  normal-′    superscript  Z   normal-′  2       X^{\prime 2}-Y^{\prime 2}=P(T^{\prime})Z^{\prime 2}     along the open sets by isomorphisms       x  ′   =  x  ,  ,   y  ′   =  y  ,     fragments   superscript  x  normal-′    x  normal-,  normal-,   superscript  y  normal-′    y  normal-,    x^{\prime}=x,,y^{\prime}=y,   and     z  ′   =   z   t  m         superscript  z  normal-′     z   superscript  t  m      z^{\prime}=zt^{m}   .  One shows the following result :   Fundamental property:   The surface F a , P is a k clean and smooth surface, the mapping defined by      p  :   U  →   P   1  ,  k        normal-:  p   normal-→  U   subscript  P   1  k       p:U\to P_{1,k}     by       (   [  x  :  y  :  z  ]   ,  t  )   ↦  t     fragments   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[  x  normal-:  y  normal-:  z  normal-]   normal-,  t  normal-)   maps-to  t    ([x:y:z],t)\mapsto t     and the same on    U  ′     superscript  U  normal-′    U^{\prime}   gives to F a , P a structure of conic bundle over P 1, k .
