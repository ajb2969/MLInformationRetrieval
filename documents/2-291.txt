Unitary matrix

In mathematics, a complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U* is also its inverse. That is, if


$U^* U = UU^* = I \,$




where I is the identity matrix. In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the Hermitian conjugate of a matrix is denoted by a dagger (†) and the equation above becomes


$U^\dagger U = UU^\dagger = I. \,$




The real analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.
Properties
For any unitary matrix U of finite size, the following hold:

Given two complex vectors x and y, multiplication by U preserves their inner product; that is,

$$\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle$$.

U is normal
U is diagonalizable; that is, U is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, as a consequence of the spectral theorem. Thus U has a decomposition of the form



$U = VDV^*\;$



where V is unitary and D is diagonal and unitary.
 


$|\det(U)|=1$.
Its eigenspaces are orthogonal.
U can be written as U=e$i$H where e indicates matrix exponential, $i$ is the imaginary unit and H is an Hermitian matrix.

For any nonnegative integer n, the set of all n by n unitary matrices with matrix multiplication forms a group, called the unitary group U(n).
Any square matrix with unit Euclidean norm is the average of two unitary matrices.1
Equivalent conditions
If U is a square, complex matrix, then the following conditions are equivalent:

U is unitary.
U* is unitary.
U is invertible with U−1=U*.
The columns of U form an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{C}^n$ with respect to the usual inner product.
The rows of U form an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{C}^n$ with respect to the usual inner product.
U is an isometry with respect to the usual norm.
U is a normal matrix with eigenvalues lying on the unit circle.

Elementary constructions
2×2 unitary matrix
The general expression of a 2x2 unitary matrix is:
$$U = 
 e^{i\varphi}\begin{bmatrix}
 a & b \\
 -b^* & a^* \\
 \end{bmatrix},\qquad |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 ,$$
which depends on 4 real parameters. The determinant of such a matrix is:
$$\det(U)=e^{i2\varphi} .$$
If φ=0, the group created by U is called special unitary group SU(2).
Matrix U can also be written in this alternative form:
$$U = 
 e^{i\varphi}\begin{bmatrix}
 \cos \theta e^{i\varphi_1} & \sin \theta e^{i\varphi_2}\\
 -\sin \theta e^{-i\varphi_2}& \cos \theta e^{-i\varphi_1}\\
 \end{bmatrix} ,$$
which, by introducing φ1 = ψ + Δ and φ2 = ψ - Δ, takes the following factorization:
$$U = 
 e^{i\varphi}\begin{bmatrix}
 e^{i\psi} & 0 \\
 0 & e^{-i\psi}
 \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
 \cos \theta  & \sin \theta \\
 -\sin \theta & \cos \theta \\
 \end{bmatrix} 
 \begin{bmatrix}
 e^{i\Delta} & 0 \\
 0 & e^{-i\Delta}
 \end{bmatrix} .$$
This expression highlights the relation between 2x2 unitary matrices and 2x2 orthogonal matrices of angle θ.
Many other factorizations of a unitary matrix in basic matrices are possible.
3×3 unitary matrix
The general expression of 3x3 unitary matrix is:2
$$U = \begin{bmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & e^{j\varphi_4} & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & e^{j\varphi_5}
 \end{bmatrix} 
 K
 \begin{bmatrix}
 e^{j\varphi_1} & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & e^{j\varphi_2} & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & e^{j\varphi_3}
 \end{bmatrix}$$
where φn, n=1,...,5 are arbitrary real numbers, while K is the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix.
