Alternant matrix

In linear algebra, an alternant matrix is a matrix with a particular structure, in which successive columns have a particular function applied to their entries. An alternant determinant is the determinant of an alternant matrix. Such a matrix of size m Ã— n may be written out as


 
  or more succinctly


 
  for all indices i and j. (Some authors use the transpose of the above matrix.)
Examples of alternant matrices include Vandermonde matrices, for which 
 
 
 
 , and Moore matrices, for which 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
 
  functions are all polynomials, there are some additional results: if 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 , then the determinant of any alternant matrix is zero (as a row is then repeated), thus 
 
 
 
  divides the determinant for all 
 
 
 
 . As such, if one takes


 
  (a Vandermonde matrix), then 
 
 
 
  divides such polynomial alternant determinants. The ratio 
 
 
 
  is called a bialternant. The case where each function 
 
 
 
  forms the classical definition of the Schur polynomials.
Alternant matrices are used in coding theory in the construction of alternant codes.
