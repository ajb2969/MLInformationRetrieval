<p>In <a class="uri" href="enzymology" title="wikilink">enzymology</a>, a <strong>lactoylglutathione lyase</strong> () (also known as <strong>glyoxalase I</strong>) is an <a class="uri" href="enzyme" title="wikilink">enzyme</a> that <a href="catalysis" title="wikilink">catalyzes</a> the <a class="uri" href="isomerization" title="wikilink">isomerization</a> of hemithioacetal adducts, which are formed in a spontaneous reaction between a <a href="glutathione" title="wikilink">glutathionyl group</a> and <a href="aldehyde" title="wikilink">aldehydes</a> such as <a class="uri" href="methylglyoxal" title="wikilink">methylglyoxal</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Glyoxalase I derives its name from its catalysis of the first step in the <a href="glyoxalase_system" title="wikilink">glyoxalase system</a>, a critical two-step detoxification system for <a class="uri" href="methylglyoxal" title="wikilink">methylglyoxal</a>. Methylglyoxal is produced naturally as a byproduct of normal biochemistry, but is highly toxic, due to its chemical reactions with <a href="protein" title="wikilink">proteins</a>, <a href="nucleic_acid" title="wikilink">nucleic acids</a>, and other cellular components. The second detoxification step, in which (R)-S-lactoylglutathione is split into glutathione and D-lactate, is carried out by <a href="glyoxalase_II" title="wikilink">glyoxalase II</a>, a <a class="uri" href="hydrolase" title="wikilink">hydrolase</a>. Unusually, these reactions carried out by the glyoxalase system does not oxidize glutathione, which usually acts as a <a class="uri" href="redox" title="wikilink">redox</a> <a class="uri" href="coenzyme" title="wikilink">coenzyme</a>. Although <a href="aldose_reductase" title="wikilink">aldose reductase</a> can also detoxify methylgloxal, the glyoxalase system is more efficient and seems to be the most important of these pathways. Glyoxalase I is an attractive target for the development of drugs to treat infections by some parasitic protozoa, and <a class="uri" href="cancer" title="wikilink">cancer</a>. Several <a href="enzyme_inhibitor" title="wikilink">inhibitors</a> of glyoxalase I have been identified, such as S-(N-hydroxy-N-methylcarbamoyl)glutathione.</p>

<p>Glyoxalase I is classified as a carbon-sulfur <a class="uri" href="lyase" title="wikilink">lyase</a> although, strictly speaking, the enzyme does not form or break a carbon-sulfur bond. Rather, the enzyme shifts two hydrogen atoms from one carbon atom of the methylglyoxal to the adjacent carbon atom. In effect, the reaction is an intramolecular <a class="uri" href="redox" title="wikilink">redox</a> reaction; one carbon is oxidized whereas the other is reduced. The mechanism proceeds by subtracting and then adding <a href="proton" title="wikilink">protons</a>, forming an enediolate intermediate, rather than by transferring <a href="hydride" title="wikilink">hydrides</a>. Unusually for a <a class="uri" href="metalloprotein" title="wikilink">metalloprotein</a>, this enzyme shows <a href="enzymatic_activity" title="wikilink">activity</a> with several different metals. Glyoxalase I is also unusual in that it is <a href="stereospecificity" title="wikilink">stereospecific</a> in the second half of its mechanism, but not in the first half. Structurally, the enzyme is a domain-swapped dimer in many species, although the two subunits have merged into a monomer in <a class="uri" href="yeast" title="wikilink">yeast</a>, through <a href="gene_duplication" title="wikilink">gene duplication</a>.</p>
<h2 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h2>

<p>The systematic name of this enzyme class is <strong>(R)-S-lactoylglutathione methylglyoxal-lyase (isomerizing glutathione-forming)</strong>; other names include <em>methylglyoxalase</em>, <em>aldoketomutase</em>, <em>ketone-aldehyde mutase</em>, and <em>(R)-S-lactoylglutathione methylglyoxal-lyase (isomerizing)</em>. In some instances, the glutathionyl moiety may be supplied by <a class="uri" href="trypanothione" title="wikilink">trypanothione</a>, the analog of glutathione in parasitic protozoa such as the <a href="Trypanosoma" title="wikilink">trypanosomes</a>. The human gene for this enzyme is called <a class="uri" href="GLO1" title="wikilink">GLO1</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gene">Gene</h2>

<p>Lactoylglutathione lyase in humans is encoded by the <em>GLO1</em> <a class="uri" href="gene" title="wikilink">gene</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Several <a href="tertiary_structure" title="wikilink">structures</a> of glyoxalase I have been solved. Four structures of the human form have been published, with <a href="Protein_Data_Bank" title="wikilink">PDB</a> accession codes , , , and . Five structures of the <em><a href="Escherichia_coli" title="wikilink">Escherichia coli</a></em> form have been published, with accession codes , , , , and . Finally, one structure of the trypanothione-specific version from <em><a href="Leishmania_major" title="wikilink">Leishmania major</a></em> has been solved, . In all these cases, the <a href="quaternary_structure" title="wikilink">quaternary structure</a> of the biological unit is a domain-swapped dimer, in which the active site and the 8-stranded <a href="beta_sheet" title="wikilink">beta sheet</a> <a href="secondary_structure" title="wikilink">secondary structure</a> is formed from both subunits. However, in <a class="uri" href="yeast" title="wikilink">yeast</a> such as <em><a href="Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="wikilink">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></em>, the two subunits have fused into a single monomer of double size, through <a href="gene_duplication" title="wikilink">gene duplication</a>. Each half of the structural dimer is a sandwich of 3-4 <a href="alpha_helix" title="wikilink">alpha helices</a> on both sides of an 8-stranded antiparallel beta sheet; the dimer interface is largely composed of the face-to-face meeting of the two beta sheets.</p>

<p>The tertiary and quaternary structures of glyoxalase I is similar to those of several other types of proteins. For example, glyoxalase I resembles several proteins that allow bacteria to resist antibiotics such as <a class="uri" href="fosfomycin" title="wikilink">fosfomycin</a>, <a class="uri" href="bleomycin" title="wikilink">bleomycin</a> and <a class="uri" href="mitomycin" title="wikilink">mitomycin</a>. Likewise, the unrelated enzymes <a href="methylmalonyl-CoA_epimerase" title="wikilink">methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase</a>, <a href="3-demethylubiquinone-9_3-O-methyltransferase" title="wikilink">3-demethylubiquinone-9 3-O-methyltransferase</a> and numerous <a href="dioxygenase" title="wikilink">dioxygenases</a> such as <a href="biphenyl-2,3-diol_1,2-dioxygenase" title="wikilink">biphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase</a>, <a href="catechol_2,3-dioxygenase" title="wikilink">catechol 2,3-dioxygenase</a>, <a href="3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate_2,3-dioxygenase" title="wikilink">3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase</a> and <a href="4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate_dioxygenase" title="wikilink">4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase</a> all resemble glyoxalase I in structure. Finally, many proteins of unknown or uncertain function likewise resemble glyoxalase I, such as At5g48480 from the plant, <em><a href="Arabidopsis_thaliana" title="wikilink">Arabidopsis thaliana</a></em>.</p>

<p>The active site has four major regions.</p>
<h2 id="function">Function</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption><a class="uri" href="Methylglyoxal" title="wikilink">Methylglyoxal</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The principal physiological function of glyoxalase I is the detoxification of <a class="uri" href="methylglyoxal" title="wikilink">methylglyoxal</a>, a reactive 2-oxoaldehyde that is cytostatic at low concentrations<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and cytotoxic at millimolar concentrations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Methylglyoxal is a by-product of normal biochemistry that is a carcinogen, a mutagen<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and can chemically damage several components of the cell, such as proteins and nucleic acids.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Methylglyoxal is formed spontaneously from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, enzymatically by triosephosphate isomerase and methylglyoxal synthase, as also in the catabolism of <a class="uri" href="threonine" title="wikilink">threonine</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>To minimize the amount of toxic methylglyoxal and other reactive 2-oxoaldehydes, the <a href="glyoxalase_system" title="wikilink">glyoxalase system</a> has evolved. The methylglyoxal reacts spontaneously with reduced <a class="uri" href="glutathione" title="wikilink">glutathione</a> (or its equivalent, <a class="uri" href="trypanothione" title="wikilink">trypanothione</a>), forming a hemithioacetal. The glyoxalase system converts such compounds into D-<a href="Lactic_acid" title="wikilink">lactate</a> and restored the glutathione. In this conversion, the two carbonyl carbons of the 2-oxoaldehyde are oxidized and reduced, respectively, the aldehyde being oxidized to a carboxylic acid and the acetal group being reduced to an alcohol. The glyoxalase system evolved very early in life's history and is found nearly universally through life-forms.</p>

<p>The glyoaxalase system consists of two enzymes, glyoxalase I and <a href="glyoxalase_II" title="wikilink">glyoxalase II</a>. The former enzyme, described here, rearranges the hemithioacetal formed naturally by the attack of <a class="uri" href="glutathione" title="wikilink">glutathione</a> on methylglyoxal into the product. Glyoxalase II hydrolyzes the product to re-form the glutathione and produce D-<a href="Lactic_acid" title="wikilink">lactate</a>. Thus, glutathione acts unusually as a <a class="uri" href="coenzyme" title="wikilink">coenzyme</a> and is required only in catalytic (i.e., very small) amounts; normally, glutathione acts instead as a <a class="uri" href="redox" title="wikilink">redox</a> couple in oxidation-reduction reactions.</p>

<p>The glyoxalase system has also been suggested to play a role in regulating cell growth<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> and in assembling <a href="microtubule" title="wikilink">microtubules</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>Glyoxalase I requires bound metal ions for catalysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> The human enzyme<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and its counterparts in yeast (<em><a href="Saccharomyces_cerevisiae" title="wikilink">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a></em>)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and <em><a href="Pseudomonas_putida" title="wikilink">Pseudomonas putida</a></em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> use divalent <a class="uri" href="zinc" title="wikilink">zinc</a>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>. By contrast, the prokaryotic versions often use a <a class="uri" href="nickel" title="wikilink">nickel</a> ion. Interestingly, the glyoxalase I found in eukaryotic <a href="Trypanosomatid" title="wikilink">trypanosomal</a> parasites such as <em><a href="Leishmania_major" title="wikilink">Leishmania major</a></em> and <em><a href="Trypanosoma_cruzi" title="wikilink">Trypanosoma cruzi</a></em> can also use nickel for activity, possibly reflecting an acquisition of their GLO1 gene by <a href="horizontal_gene_transfer" title="wikilink">horizontal gene transfer</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>A striking property of glyoxalase I is its lack of specificity for the catalytic metal ion. Most enzymes prefer to bind one particular type of metal, and their catalytic activity depends on having bound that metal. For example, <a href="oxidoreductase" title="wikilink">oxidoreductases</a> often use a specific <a class="uri" href="metal" title="wikilink">metal</a> ion such as <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a>, <a class="uri" href="manganese" title="wikilink">manganese</a> or <a class="uri" href="copper" title="wikilink">copper</a> and will fail to function if their preferred metal ion is replaced, due to differences in the <a href="reduction_potential" title="wikilink">redox potential</a>; thus, the ferrous <a href="superoxide_dismutase" title="wikilink">superoxide dismutase</a> cannot function if its catalytic iron is replaced by manganese, and vice versa. By contrast, although human glyoxalase I prefers to use divalent zinc, it is able to function with many other divalent metals, including <a class="uri" href="magnesium" title="wikilink">magnesium</a>, <a class="uri" href="manganese" title="wikilink">manganese</a>, <a class="uri" href="cobalt" title="wikilink">cobalt</a>, <a class="uri" href="nickel" title="wikilink">nickel</a> and even <a class="uri" href="calcium" title="wikilink">calcium</a>.;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> however, the enzyme is inactive with the ferrous cation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Similarly, although the prokaryotic glyoxalase I prefers nickel, it is able to function with cobalt, manganese and <a class="uri" href="cadmium" title="wikilink">cadmium</a>; however, the enzyme is inert with bound zinc, due to a change in <a href="coordination_geometry" title="wikilink">coordination geometry</a> from <a href="Octahedral_molecular_geometry" title="wikilink">octahedral</a> to <a href="Trigonal_bipyramidal_molecular_geometry" title="wikilink">trigonal bipyramidal</a>. Structural and computational studies have revealed that the metal binds the two carbonyl oxygens of the methylglyoxal moiety at two of its coordination sites, stabilizing the enediolate anion intermediate.</p>

<p>Another unusual property of glyoxalase I is its inconsistent stereospecificity. The first step of its reaction mechanism (the abstraction of the proton from C<sub>1</sub> and subsequent protonation of O<sub>2</sub>) is not stereospecific, and works equally well regardless of the initial chirality at C<sub>1</sub> in the hemithioacetal substrate. The resulting enediolate intermediate is achiral, but the second step of the reaction mechanism (the abstraction of a proton from O<sub>1</sub> and subsequent protonation of C<sub>2</sub>) is definitely stereospecific, producing only the (<em>S</em>) form of D-lactoylglutathione. This is believed to result from the two <a href="glutamate" title="wikilink">glutamates</a> bound oppositely on the metal ion; either one is able to carry out the first step, but only one is able to carry out the second step. The reason from this asymmetry is not yet fully determined.</p>
<h2 id="mechanism">Mechanism</h2>

<p>The <a class="uri" href="methylglyoxal" title="wikilink">methylglyoxal</a> molecule consists of two <a class="uri" href="carbonyl" title="wikilink">carbonyl</a> groups flanked by a <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a> atom and a <a class="uri" href="methyl" title="wikilink">methyl</a> group. In the discussion below, these two carbonyl carbons will be denoted as C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>, respectively. In both the hemithioacetal substrate and the (R)-S-lactoylglutathione product, the <a class="uri" href="glutathione" title="wikilink">glutathione</a> moiety is bonded to the C<sub>1</sub> carbonyl group.</p>

<p>The basic mechanism of glyoxalase I is as follows. The substrate hemithioacetal is formed when a molecule of <a class="uri" href="glutathione" title="wikilink">glutathione</a> — probably in its reactive <a class="uri" href="thiolate" title="wikilink">thiolate</a> form — attacks the C<sub>1</sub> carbonyl of methylglyoxal or a related compound, rendering that carbon tetravalent. This reaction occurs spontaneously in the cell, without the involvement of the enzyme. This hemithioacetal is then bound by the enzyme, which shifts a hydrogen from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub>. The C<sub>2</sub> carbonyl is reduced to a tetravalent alcohol form by the addition of two protons, whereas the C<sub>1</sub> carbonyl is restored by losing a hydrogen while retaining its bond to the glutathione moiety.</p>

<p>A computational study, combined with the available experimental data, suggests the following atomic-resolution mechanism for glyoxalase I.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> In the active site, the catalytic metal adopts an octahedral coordination geometry and, in the absence of substrate, binds two waters, two opposite <a href="glutamate" title="wikilink">glutamates</a>, a <a class="uri" href="histidine" title="wikilink">histidine</a> and one other sidechain, usually another histidine or <a href="glutamate" title="wikilink">glutamates</a>. When the substrate enters the active site, the two waters are shed and the two carbonyl oxygens of the substrate are bound directly to the metal ion. The two opposing glutamates add and subtract protons from C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> and their respective oxygens, O<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. The first half of the reaction transfers a proton from C<sub>1</sub> to O<sub>2</sub>, whereas the second half transfers a proton from O<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub>. The former reaction may be carried out by either of the opposing glutamates, depending on the initial chirality of C<sub>1</sub> in the hemithioacetal substrate; however, the second half is stereospecific and is carried out by only one of the opposing glutamates.</p>
<h3 id="proton-vs.-hydride-transfer">Proton vs. hydride transfer</h3>

<p>Glyoxalase I was originally believed to operate by the transfer of a <a class="uri" href="hydride" title="wikilink">hydride</a>, which is a <a class="uri" href="proton" title="wikilink">proton</a> surrounded by two <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> (H<sup>–</sup>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> In this, it was thought to resemble the classic <a href="Cannizzaro_reaction" title="wikilink">Cannizzaro reaction</a> mechanism, in which the attack of a hydroxylate on an aldehyde renders it into a tetravalent alcohol anion; this anion donates its hydrogens to a second aldehyde, forming a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. (In effect, two identical aldehydes reduce and oxidize each other, leaving the net oxidation state the same.)</p>

<p>In glyoxalase I, such a hydride-transfer mechanism would work as follows. The attack of the glutathione would leave a charged O<sup>–</sup> and the aldehyde hydrogen bound to C<sub>1</sub>. If the carbonyl oxygen of C<sub>2</sub> can secure a hydrogen from an obliging acidic sidechain of the enzyme, forming an alcohol, then the hydrogen of C<sub>1</sub> might simultaneously slide over with its electrons onto C<sub>2</sub> (the hydride transfer). At the same time, the extra electron on the oxygen of C<sub>1</sub> could reform the double bond of the carbonyl, thus giving the final product.</p>

<p>An alternative (and ultimately correct) mechanism using <a class="uri" href="proton" title="wikilink">proton</a> (H<sup>+</sup>) transfer was put forward in the 1970s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> In this mechanism, a basic sidechain of the enzyme abstracts the aldehyde proton from C<sub>1</sub>; at the same time, the a proton is added to the oxygen of C<sub>2</sub>, thus forming a <em>enediol</em>. The <em>ene</em> means that a double bond has formed between C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>1</sub>, from the electrons left behind by the abstraction of the aldehyde proton; the <em>diol</em> refers to the fact that two alcohols have been made of the initial two carbonyl groups. In this mechanism, the intermediate forms the product by adding another proton to C<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>It was expected that solvent protons would contribute to forming the product from the enediol intermediate of the proton-transfer mechanism and when such contributions were not observed in <a href="tritium" title="wikilink">tritiated</a> water, <sup>3</sup>H<sub>1</sub>O, the hydride-transfer mechanism was favored. However, an alternate hypothesis — that the enzyme active site was deeply buried away from water — could not be ruled out and ultimately proved to be correct. The first indications came when ever-increasing temperatures showed ever-increasing incorporation of tritium, which is consistent with proton transfer and unexpected by hydride transfer. The clinching evidence can with studies of the hydrogen-deuterium <a href="isotope_effect" title="wikilink">isotope effect</a> on substrates <a href="fluorine" title="wikilink">fluorinated</a> on the methyl group and deuterated on the aldehyde. The fluoride is a good leaving group; the hydride-transfer mechanism predicts <em>less</em> fluoride ion elimination with the deuterated sample, whereas the proton-transfer mechanism predicts <em>more</em>. Experiments on three types of glyoxalase I (yeast, rat and mouse forms) supported the proton-transfer mechanism in every case.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> This mechanism was finally observed in crystal structures of glyoxalase I.</p>
<h2 id="clinical-significance">Clinical significance</h2>
<h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>

<p>Multiple studies have reported evidence that <em>Glo1</em> expression is correlated with differences in anxiety-like behavior in mice<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> as well as behavior in the <a href="tail_suspension_test" title="wikilink">tail suspension test</a>, which is sensitive to <a class="uri" href="antidepressant" title="wikilink">antidepressant</a> drugs;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> however, the direction of these effects have not always been consistent, which has raised skepticism.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Differences in <em>Glo1</em> expression in mice appear to be caused by a <a href="copy_number_variant" title="wikilink">copy number variant</a> that is common among <a href="inbred_strain" title="wikilink">inbred strains</a> of mice.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> It has been proposed that the behavioral effects of <em>Glo1</em> are due to the activity of its principal substrate <a class="uri" href="methylglyoxal" title="wikilink">methylglyoxal</a> at <a href="GABAA_receptor" title="wikilink">GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> A small molecule inhibitor of glyoxalase I has been shown to have anxiolytic properties, thus identifying another possible indication for inhibitors of Glyoxalase I.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="as-a-drug-target">As a drug target</h3>

<p>Glyoxalase I is a target for the development of pharmaceuticals against bacteria, protozoans (especially <em><a href="Trypanosoma_cruzi" title="wikilink">Trypanosoma cruzi</a></em> and the <em><a class="uri" href="Leishmania" title="wikilink">Leishmania</a></em>) and human cancer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> Numerous inhibitors have been developed, most of which share the <a class="uri" href="glutathione" title="wikilink">glutathione</a> moiety.
