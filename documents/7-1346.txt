Kerala

Kerala (), sometimes referred to in historical terms as Keralam,1 is a state in the south-west region of India on the Malabar coast. It was created on 1November 1956 following the States Reorganisation Act by combining various Malayalam-speaking regions. Spread over , it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and north east, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the thirteenth largest state by population and is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken and official language of the state.
The region was a prominent spice exporter from 3000 BCE to 3rd century. The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala, though it frequently struggled against attacks from the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. During the Chera period, Kerala remained an international spice trading center. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for the European colonisation of India. After independence, Travancore and Cochin joined the Republic of India and Travancore-Cochin was given the status of a state. Later, the state was formed in 1956 by merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks), and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara.
Kerala is the state with the lowest positive population growth rate in India; 3.44% and has a density of 860 people per km2. The state has the highest Human Development Index (HDI); 0.790 in the country according to the Human Development Report (2011).2 It also has the highest literacy rate; 93.91%, the highest life expectancy; 77 years and the highest sex ratio; 1,084 women per 1000 men. A survey in 2005 by Transparency International ranked Kerala as the least corrupt state in the country. The state has witnessed significant emigration of its people, especially to the Gulf states during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. The culture of the state is a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.3
Production of pepper and natural rubber contributes to a significant portion of the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. The state's coastline extends for , and around 1.1 million people of the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% of the state's income. The state's  of roads, constitute 4.2% of all Indian roadways. There are three existing, and one proposed, international airports. Waterways are also used for transportation. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine different languages; mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is an important tourist destination, with backwaters, beaches, Ayurvedic tourism, and tropical greenery among its major attractions.
Etymology
The name Kerala has an uncertain etymology. Keralam may stem from the Classical Tamil cherive-alam ("declivity of a hill or a mountain slope") or chera alam ("Land of the Cheras"). Kerala may represent an imperfect Malayalam portmanteau fusing kera ("coconut palm tree") and alam ("land" or "location").4 "Kerala" can also be derived from the word "Cheral" that refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings. In turn the word "Cheral" is derived from the Proto-Tamil-Malayalam word for "lake".5
The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala is the [Aitareya Aranyaka] of the Rigveda. It is also mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the two Hindu epics.6 The word Kerala is first recorded (as Keralaputra means Cherathala makan or Cheraman) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription (Rock Edict 2) left by the Maurya emperor Ashoka (274–237 BCE).7 The rock inscription refers to the local ruler as Keralaputra (Sanskrit for "son of Kerala"; or "son of Chera[s]", this is contradictory to a popular theory that etymology derives "Kerala" from "Kera"; coconut tree in Malayalam).8 At that time, one of three states in the region was called Cheralam in Classical Tamil: Chera and Kera are variants of the same word.9 The Graeco-Roman trade map Periplus Maris Erythraei refers to this Keralaputra as Celobotra.10
History
Mythology

Dahsavthar stories of Hindu mythology, linked to Kerala by Aryan settlers from north. According to them, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, 6th avatar of Vishnu, hence Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama"). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.11 Consensus among scientific geographers agrees that a substantial portion of this area was under the sea in ancient times.12 The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama.13 In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolize his lordship over it.14
Another much earlier Puranic character associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical king of justice, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala.15 The Matsya Purana, which is among the oldest of the 18 Puranas,1617 uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Lord Matsya, the first incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and King Manu, the first man and the king of the region.1819
Pre-history

Pre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area in Idukki district. They are locally known as "muniyara", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen).20 Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad are thought to date from the early to late Neolithic eras around 6000 BCE.2122 Archaeological studies have identified many Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala.23 The studies point to the indigenous development of the ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, and its continuity through Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages.24 Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation;25 historians suggest possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age.26
Ancient period
 Kerala was a major spice exporter from as early as 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records.27 Kerala, known for its spices, attracted ancient Babylonians, Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Arabs and Phoenicians also established their prominence in the Kerala trade during this early period.28 The Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola, Pandya, and Satiyaputra.29 Scholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras, the first dominant dynasty based on Kerala.3031 These territories once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as Tamilakam.32 While the Cheras ruled the major part of modern Kerala, its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas,33 which had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda (or Neacyndi).34 At later times the region fell under the control of the Pandyas, Cheras, and Cholas. Ays and Mushikas were two other remarkable dynasties of ancient Kerala, whose kingdoms lay to the south and north of Cheras respectively.3536
In the last centuries BCE the coast became prominent among the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially black pepper. The Cheras had trading links with China, West Asia, Egypt, Greece, and the Roman Empire. In the foreign-trade circles the region was identified by the name Male or Malabar.37 Muziris, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time.38 The value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces;39 contemporary Sangam literature describes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala have been Eudoxus of Cyzicus, around 118 or 166 BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII, king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. Various Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana; the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus.4041
Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala.42 Jewish connection with Kerala started in 573 BCE.434445 Arabs also had trade links with Kerala, started before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus (484–413 BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Jews at Eden.46 They intermarried with local people, resulting in formation of the Muslim Mappila community.47 In the 4th century, some Christians also immigrated from Persia and joined the early Syrian Christian community who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.4849 Mappila was an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim immigration account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas, Nasrani Mappilas, and Muslim Mappilas.5051 According to the legends of these communities, the earliest churches,52 mosque,53 and synagogue (1568 CE)54 in India were built in Kerala.55
Early medieval period
 A Second Chera Kingdom (c. 800–1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram, was established by Kulasekhara Varman, which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagerkovil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire.5657 During Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism.58 A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period.59 For the local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis.60
The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. Buddhism and Jainism disappeared from the land.61 The social system became fractured with internal divisions on the lines of caste.62 Finally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas and Later Cholas.63 However, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299–1314) of the southern Venad kingdom was able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into thirty small warring principalities; most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri in the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. Later in the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all kingdoms up to Northern Kerala through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of pre-eminence in Kerala. The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal, Malabar came under direct British rule until the Independence of India.6465
Colonial era
 The maritime spice trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean stayed with Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper, became an influential activity for European traders.66 Around the 15th century, the Portuguese began to dominate the eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular, culminating in Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad Kozhikode in 1498.676869 The Zamorin of Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and a fort. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and King of Kochi and allied with Kochi. When Francisco de Almeida was appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel) rather than in Kozhikode. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses in Malabar coast.70 However, the Portuguese suffered setbacks from the attacks of Zamorin forces; especially from naval attacks under the leadership of admirals of Kozhikode known as Kunjali Marakkars, which compelled them to seek a treaty. In 1571, Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at Chaliyam fort.71
The Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company, who during the conflicts between Kozhikode and Kochi, gained control of the trade.72 The Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741.73 An agreement, known as "Treaty of Mavelikkara", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region.747576 Marthanda Varma annexed many northern kingdoms through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala.77
In 1766, Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore invaded northern Kerala.78 His son and successor, Tipu Sultan, launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company, resulting in two of the four Anglo-Mysore Wars.7980 Tipu ultimately ceded Malabar District and South Kanara to the Company in the 1790s; both were annexed to the Madras Presidency of British India in 1792.8182 The Company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795.83 By the end of 18th century, the whole of Kerala fell under the control of the British, either administered directly or under suzerainty.84 There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century; most notable among them is the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the many social struggles in Travancore. In the Malabar Rebellion, Mappila Muslims of Malabar rioted against Hindu zamindars and the British Raj.85 Some social struggles against caste inequalities also erupted in the early decades of 20th century, leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes.86
Post colonial period
After British India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi, part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin.87 On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras, and Travancore-Cochin, without four southern taluks (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act.8889 A Communist-led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957.90 It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments, after Communist success in the 1945 elections in the Republic of San Marino.919293
Geography
The state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats. Lying between north latitudes 8°18' and 12°48' and east longitudes 74°52' and 77°22',94 Kerala experiences the humid equatorial tropic climate. The state has a coast of 95 and the width of the state varies between 11 and 121 km (22–75 miles).96 Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain, the central mid-lands; rolling hills, and the western lowlands; coastal plains.97 The state is located at the extreme southern tip of the Indian subcontinent and lies near the centre of the Indian tectonic plate; hence, it is subject to comparatively low seismic and volcanic activity.98 Pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala's terrain.99100 A catastrophic flood in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history; it also created a natural harbor for spice transport.101 The eastern region of Kerala consists of high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' rain shadow.102 41 of Kerala's west-flowing rivers,103 and three of its east-flowing ones originate in this region.104105 The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near Palakkad; hence also known Palghat, where the Palakkad Gap breaks.106 The Western Ghats rise on average to 1,500 m (4920 ft) above sea level,107 while the highest peaks reach around 2,500 m (8200 ft).108 Anamudi, the highest peak in south India, is at an elevation of 2,695 metres (8,842 ft).109
Kerala's western coastal belt is relatively flat to the eastern region,110 and is criss-crossed by a network of interconnected brackish canals, lakes, estuaries,111 and rivers known as the Kerala Backwaters.112 The state's largest lake Vembanad, dominates the backwaters; it lies between Alappuzha and Kochi and is about  in area.113 Around eight percent of India's waterways are found in Kerala.114 Kerala's forty-four rivers include the Periyar; 244 km, Bharathapuzha; 209 km, Pamba; 176 km, Chaliyar; 169 km, Kadalundipuzha; 130 km, Chalakudipuzha; 130 km, Valapattanam; 129 km and the Achankovil River; 128 km. The average length of the rivers is 64 km. Many of the rivers are small and entirely fed by monsoon rain.115 As Kerala's rivers are small and lacking in delta, they are more prone to environmental effects. The rivers face problems such as sand mining and pollution.116 The state experiences several natural hazards like landslides, floods and droughts. The state was also affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.117 
Climate
With around 120–140 rainy days per year,118 Kerala has a wet and maritime tropical climate influenced by the seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast winter monsoon.119 Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon.120 Southwest monsoon; The moisture-laden winds, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, it divides into two branches; the "Arabian Sea Branch" and the "Bay of Bengal Branch".121 The "Arabian Sea Branch" of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats in the state,122 making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon.123124 Northeast monsoon: The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed during this season and the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it in the east coast of peninsular India.125126 In Kerala, the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only.127 Kerala's rainfall averages 2,923 mm (115 in) annually.128 Some of Kerala's drier lowland regions average only 1,250 mm (49 in); the mountains of eastern Idukki district receive more than 5,000 mm (197 in) of orographic precipitation: the highest in the state. In eastern Kerala, a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails. During summer, the state is prone to gale force winds, storm surges, cyclone-related torrential downpours, occasional droughts, and rises in sea level.129 The mean daily temperatures range from 19.8 °C to 36.7 °C.130 Mean annual temperatures range from 25.0–27.5 °C in the coastal lowlands to 20.0–22.5 °C in the eastern highlands.131
Flora and fauna
  Most of the biodiversity is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats. Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species 900 species are medicinal plants; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala and 159 threatened.132 Its 9,400 km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations—3,470 km2), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations—4,100 km2 and 100 km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations—100 km2). Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested.133 Three of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands—Lake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands—are in Kerala, as well as 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century,134 much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling.135 Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests, which are common in the Western Ghats.136137
Kerala's fauna are notable for their diversity and high rates of endemism: it includes 102 species of mammals (56 of which are endemic), 476 species of birds, 202 species of freshwater fishes, 169 species of reptiles (139 of them endemic), and 89 species of amphibians (86 endemic).138 These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number among the more than 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides.139 Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrel are also found in the forests.140 Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna. In lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus are found.141 
Subdivisions
 The state's 14 districts are distributed among Kerala's six regions: North Malabar (far-north Kerala), South Malabar (northern Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore, Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (far-south Kerala). The districts which serve as the administrative regions for taxation purposes are further subdivided into 75 taluks, which have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders, including maintenance of local land records. Kerala's taluks are further sub-divided into 1,453 revenue villages.142 Consequent to the 73rd and 74th Amendment to the Constitution of India, the local self-government institutions are to function as the third tier of government, which constitutes 14 District Panchayats, 152 Block Panchayats, 978 Grama Panchayats, 60 Municipalities, six Corporations and one Township.143 Mahé, a part of the Indian union territory of Puducherry,144 though  remote from it,145 is a coastal exclave surrounded by Kerala on all of its landward approaches. The Kannur District surrounds Mahé on three sides and Kozhikode District from one side.146
There are five Municipal corporations in Kerala that govern Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Kollam and Thrissur.147 Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation is the largest corporation in Kerala while Kochi metropolitan area named Greater Cochin or Kochi UA is the largest urban agglomeration.148 According to a survey by economics research firm Indicus Analytivs, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur found place in the "best cities in India to spend life"; the survey used parameters such as health, education, environment, safety, public facilities and entertainment to rank the cities.149
Government and administration
 Kerala hosts two major political alliances: the United Democratic Front (India) (UDF); led by the Indian National Congress and the Left Democratic Front (Kerala) (LDF); led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). At present, the UDF is the ruling coalition in government; Oommen Chandy of the Indian National Congress is the Chief Minister, while V.S. Achuthanandan of the LDF is the Leader of Opposition. Strikes, protests and marches are ubiquitous in Kerala because of the comparatively strong presence of labour unions.150151 According to the Constitution of India, Kerala has a parliamentary system of representative democracy for its governance; universal suffrage is granted to state residents.152 The government structure is organised into the three branches:

Legislature: The unicameral legislature, the Kerala Legislative Assembly, comprises elected members and special office bearers; the Speaker and Deputy Speaker elected by the members from among themselves. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker and in the Speaker's absence, by the Deputy Speaker. The state has 140 assembly constituencies.153 The state elects 20 and nine members for representation in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha respectively.154
Executive: The Governor of Kerala is the constitutional head of state, and is appointed by the President of India.155 P Sathasivam is the Governor of Kerala.156 The executive authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Kerala, who is the de facto head of state and is vested with extensive executive powers; the head of the party attaining majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed to the post by the Governor.157 The Council of Ministers, has its members appointed by the Governor, taking the advice of the Chief Minister.158 Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.159 
Judiciary: The judiciary consists of the Kerala High Court and a system of lower courts.160 The High Court, located at Kochi,161 has a Chief Justice along with 23 permanent and seven additional pro tempore justices as of 2012.162 The high court also hears cases from the Union Territory of Lakshadweep.163164

The local self-government bodies; Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance was started in 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction.165 With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in the year 1994, the state implemented various reforms in the local self-governance.166 Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of local-government with Gram panchayat, Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy.167 The acts ensure clear demarcation of power among these institutions.168 However, Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed at par with Gram panchayat of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation.169 As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government.170 
Economy
After independence, the state was managed as a democratic socialist welfare economy. From the 1990s, liberalisation of the mixed economy allowed onerous Licence Raj restrictions against capitalism and foreign direct investment to be lightened, leading to economic expansion and increase in employment. In the fiscal years 2007–2008, the nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP) was . GSDP growth; 9.2% in 2004–2005 and 7.4% in 2003–2004 had been high compared to average of 2.3% annually in the 1980s and between 5.1%171 and 5.99%172 in the 1990s.173 The state recorded 8.93% growth in enterprises from 1998 to 2005, higher than the nation's rate of 4.80%.174 Human Development Index rating is the highest in India at 0.790.175 The "Kerala phenomenon" or "Kerala model of development" of very high human development and not much high economic development resulted due to a stronger service sector.176177
Kerala's economy depends on emigrants working in foreign countries, mainly in the Gulf states, and remittances annually contribute more than a fifth of GSDP.178 In 2008, the Gulf countries together had a Keralite population of more than 2.5 million, who sent home annually a sum of 6.81 billion, which is the highest among Indian states and more than 15.13% of remittance to India in 2008.179 In 2012, Kerala still received the highest remittances of all states: $11.3 billion, which was nearly 16% of the $71 billion remittances to the country.180 However, a study commissioned by the Kerala State Planning Board, suggested the state to look for other reliable sources instead of relying on remittances to finance its expenditure.181
The tertiary sector comprises services such as transport, storage, communications, tourism, banking and insurance and real estate. In 2011–2012, it contributed 63.22% of the state's GDP, agriculture and allied sectors contributed 15.73%, while manufacturing, construction and utilities contributed 21.05%.182183 Nearly half of Kerala's people depend on agriculture alone for income.184 Around 600 varieties185 of rice which are Kerala's most used staple food and cereal crop186 are harvested from 3105.21 km2; a decline from 5883.4 km2 in 1990.187 688,859 tonne paddy are also produced per year.188 Other key crops include coconut; 899,198 ha, tea, coffee; 23% of Indian production,189 or 57,000 tonnes,190) rubber, cashews, and spices—including pepper, cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Around 1.050 million fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of 1999–2000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the 590 km coast. Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland. Kerala's coastal belt of Karunagappally is known for high background radiation from thorium-containing monazite sand. In some coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy/yr and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy/yr.191
Traditional industries manufacturing items; coir, handlooms, and handicrafts employ around one million people.192 Kerala supplies 60% of the total global produce of white coir fibre. India's first coir factory was set up in Alleppey in 1859-60.193 The Central Coir Research Institute was also established in 1959 in Alleppy. As per the 2006–2007 census by SIDBI, there are 1,468,104 micro, small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3,031,272 people.194195 The KSIDC has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala, creating employment for 72,500 people.196 A mining sector of 0.3% of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite, kaolin, bauxite, silica, quartz, rutile, zircon, and sillimanite.197 Other major sectors are tourism, manufacturing, home gardens, animal husbandry and business process outsourcing. As of March 2002, Kerala's banking sector comprised 3341 local branches: each branch served 10,000 persons, lower than the national average of 16,000; the state has the third-highest bank penetration among Indian states.198 On 1 October 2011, Kerala became the first state in the country to have at least one banking facility in every village.199 Unemployment in 2007 was estimated at 9.4%;200 chronic issues are underemployment, low employability of youth, and a low female labor participation rate of only 13.5%,201 as is the practice of Nokku kooli, "wages for looking on".202 By 1999–2000, the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10.0% and 9.6% respectively.203
Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram is the largest IT employer in Kerala and employs around 35,000 people. It was the first technology park in India204205 and with the inauguration of the Thejaswini complex on 22 February 2007, Technopark became the largest IT Park in India.206 Software giants like Infosys, Oracle, Tata Consultancy Services, Capgemini, HCL, UST Global, Nest, Suntec and IBS have offices in the state.207 Thiruvananthapuram is also the "IT Hub of Kerala" and accounts for around 80% of the software exports.208 The Grand Kerala Shopping Festival (GKSF) claimed to be "Asia's largest shopping festival" was started in the year 2007.209
The state's budget of 2012–2013 was  481.42 billion.210 The state government's tax revenues (excluding the shares from Union tax pool) amounted to  217.22 billion in 2010–2011; up from  176.25 billion in 2009–2010. Its non-tax revenues (excluding the shares from Union tax pool) of the Government of Kerala reached  19,308 million in 2010–2011.211 However, Kerala's high ratio of taxation to GSDP has not alleviated chronic budget deficits and unsustainable levels of government debt, which have impacted social services.212 A record total of 223 hartals were observed in 2006, resulting in a revenue loss of over  20 billion ( 20 billion).213 Kerala's 10% rise in GDP is 3% more than the national GDP. In 2013, capital expenditure rose 30% compared to the national average of 5%, owners in two-wheelers rose by 35% compared to the national 15%, and the teacher-pupil ratio rose 50% from 2:100 to 4:100.214
Agriculture
Agriculture in Kerala has passed through many phases. The major change occurred in the 1970s when production of rice reduced due to increased availability of rice supply all over India and decreased availability of labour supply.215 Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and a major portion of the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops.216217 Profitability of crops reduced due to shortage of farm labour, the high price of land and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.218
Kerala produces 97% of the national output of black pepper219 and accounts for 85% of the area under natural rubber in the country.220221 Coconut, tea, coffee, cashew, and spices—including cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg comprise a critical agricultural sector.222223224225226227 The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields.228 Home gardens comprise a significant portion of the agricultural sector.229 Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless.230231 The state government promotes these activity via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini.232233
Though the contribution of agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012-13, under the strength of the allied livestock sector, it has picked up from 7.03% (2011–12) to 7.2%. In the current fiscal (2013–14), the contribution has been estimated at a high of 7.75%. The total growth of farm sector has recorded a 4.39% increase in 2012-13, over a paltry 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal. The primary sector comprising agriculture has a share of 9.34% in the sectoral distribution of Gross State Domestic Product at Constant Price, while the secondary and tertiary sectors has contributed 23.94% and 66.72% respectively.234
Ill-effects due to the usage of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has gradually contributed to preferences for organic products and home farming, and as a result the Kerala government plans to shift to fully organic cultivation by 2016.235236

Fisheries
With 590 km of coastal belt,237 400,000 hectares of inland water resources238 and approximately 220,000 active fishermen,239 Kerala is one of the leading producers of fish in India.240 According to 2003–04 reports, about 1.1 million people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries. The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 608,000 tons in 2003–04.241 This contributes to about 3% of the total economy of the state. In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from the state.242 During the southwest monsoon, a suspended mud bank develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishery industry. This phenomenon is locally called chakara.243244 The fish landings consist of a large variety: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18%.245
Urban development
In 2015, the central government selected the following cities of Kerala state for a comprehensive development program called the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT):246 Kochi, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, Kollam, Cherathala, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Palakkad, Alappuzha, Ottappalam, Kanhangad, Kasaragod, Changanassery, Chalakkudi and Kothamangalam.
Transport
Roads
 Kerala has  of roads; it accounts for 4.2% of India's total. This translates to about  of road per thousand population, compared to an average of  in the country. Roads in Kerala include 1,524 km of national highway; it is 2.6% of the nation's total, 4341.6 km of state highway and 18900 km of district roads.247 Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through two national highways: NH 47 and NH 17, and the eastern side is accessible through various state highways.248 There is also a hill highway proposed, to make easy access to eastern hills.249 National Highway 17 with the longest stretch of 421 km connects Edapally to Panvel; it starts from Kochi and passes through Kozhikode, Kannur, Kanhangad, Kasaragod and Uppala before entering Karnataka.250 District Palakkad is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap, in the Western Ghats, which connects the Northern (Malabar) and Southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala to rest of India via road and rail. It has the state's largest check post Walayar through which all the major public and commercial transportation happens, to reach all other districts of Kerala.251
The Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways system and major district roads.252 The Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), which includes the GIS-based Road Information and Management Project (RIMS), is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways in Kerala; it also oversees a few major district roads.253254 Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10–11% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. Road density is nearly four times the national average, reflecting the state's high population density. Kerala's annual total of road accidents is among the nation's highest. The accidents are mainly the result of the narrow roads and irresponsible driving.255 National Highways in Kerala are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are 45 meters wide. In other states National Highways are grade separated highways 60 meters wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8 lane access-controlled expressways.256257 NHAI has threatened the kerala state government that it will give high priority to other states in highway development as political commitment to the better highways has been lacking from the government,258 although State had the highest road accident rate in the country, with most fatal accidents taking place along the State's NHs.259
Railways
 The Indian Railways' Southern Railway line runs through the state connecting most of the major towns and cities except those in the highland districts of Idukki and Wayanad.260 The railway network in the state is controlled by two out of six divisions of Southern Railway; Thiruvananthapuram Railway division and Palakkad Railway Division.261 Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC) is the busiest railway station in the state. Kerala's major railway stations are Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC), Ernakulam Junction (South) (ERS), Kozhikode (CLT), Shornur Junction (SRR), Palakkad Junction (PGT), Kollam Junction (QLN), Kannur (CAN), Thrissur Railway Station (TCR), Ernakulam Town (North)(ERN) Alappuzha (ALLP), Kottayam (KTYM) Kayamkulam Junction (KYJ) and Chengannur (CNGR). Major railway transport between Beypore–Tirur began on 12 March 1861, from Shoranur–Cochin Harbour section in 1902, from Shenkottai–Punalur on 26 November 1904, from Nilambur-Shoranur in 1927, from Punalur–Thiruvananthapuramon 4 November 1931, from Ernakulam–Kottayam in 1956, from Kottayam–Kollam in 1958, from Thiruvananthapuram–Kanyakumari in 1979 and from Thrissur-Guruvayur Section in 1994.262
Airports
Kerala has three international airports; Trivandrum International Airport, Cochin International Airport and Calicut International Airport. One international airport is proposed, at Kannur.263 Officials say that the Kannur International Airport will be completed in December 2015 and will make Kerala the only state in the country to have four international airports.264265 Kollam Airport in Kerala was the first airport in Madras Presidency which had been closed before the inauguration of the airport in the capital city of Kerala.266 Trivandrum International Airport, the oldest existing airport in South India, managed by the Airport Authority of India while Cochin International Airport is the busiest in the state and 7th busiest Airport in the country. It was the first Indian airport to be incorporated as a public limited company; it was funded by nearly 10,000 non-resident Indians from 30 countries. Cochin Airport is the primary hub of Air India Express and the secondary hub of Air Asia India267
Inland water transport
 Kerala has numerous backwaters, which are used for commercial inland navigation. Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels.268 There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is .269 The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals, and lack of a cargo handling system.270 A  long canal, National Waterway 3, runs between Kottapuram and Kollam.271
Demographics
Kerala is home to 2.76% of India's population; at 859 persons per km2, its land is nearly three times as densely settled as the rest of India, which is at a population density of 370 persons per km2.272 As of 2011, Kochi is the most populous city in Kerala.273 In the state, the rate of population growth is India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than one third of the all-India average of 17.64%.274 Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 by adding 15.6 million people to reach 29.1 million residents in 1991; the population stood at 33.3 million by 2011.275 Kerala's coastal regions are the most densely settled with population density of coastal districts being 2022 persons per km2, 2.5 times the overall population density of the state, 859 persons per km2, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated.276 Around 31.8 million Keralites are predominantly Malayali.277 State's 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis, 1.10% of the population, are concentrated in the east.278 Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language.279 Tamil, Kannada, Tulu, Hindi, Bengali, Mahl and various Adivasi (tribal) languages are also spoken.280281282283284 As of early 2013, there are close to 2.5 million (7.5% of state population) migrant workers from other states of India in Kerala.285 
Religion

In comparison with the rest of India, Kerala experiences relatively little sectarianism.286 According to 2001 Census of India figures, 56.2% of Kerala's residents are Hindus, 24.7% are Muslims, 19% are Christians, and the remaining 0.1% follows other religions.287 The major Hindu castes are Dalit, Ezhava, Thiyya, Arayan, Nadars, Nair, Chettiar and Nambudiri. The rest of the Hindu castes, including those in the list of Other Backward Class (OBC), are minority communities.Hindus constitute the majority in 10 districts except Malappuram, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, and Idukki.288 Islam arrived in Kerala through Arab traders in the 7th century AD.289290 Muslims of Kerala, generally referred to as Moplahs, mostly follow the Shafi'i Madh'hab under Sunni Islam.291 The major Muslim organisations are Sunni, Mujahid and Jama'at-e-Islami.292 Ancient Christian tradition says that Christianity reached the shores of Kerala in AD 52 with the arrival of Thomas the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ.293294295296 Saint Thomas Christians include Syro-Malabar Catholic,297 Syro-Malankara Catholic,298 Malankara Orthodox Syrian,299 Jacobite Syrian,300 Marthoma Syrian,301 the Syrian Anglicans in the CSI302 and several Pentecostal and evangelical303 denominations. Latin Catholic Christians were converted by the Portuguese in the 16th and 19th centuries.304305306 Judaism reached Kerala in the 10th century BC during the time of King Solomon.307 They are called Cochin Jews or Malabar Jews and are the oldest group of Jews in India.308309 There was a significant Jewish community existed in Kerala until the 20th century, when most of them migrated to Israel.310 The Paradesi Synagogue at Kochi is the oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth.311 Jainism has a considerable following in the Wayanad district.312313 Buddhism was dominant at the time of Ashoka the Great but vanished by the 8th century CE.314 Certain Hindu communities such as the Kshatriyas, Nairs, Tiyyas and the Muslims around North Malabar used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as marumakkathayam,315316 although this practice ended in the years after Indian independence.317 Other Muslims, Christians, and some Hindu castes such as the Namboothiris and the Ezhavas followed makkathayam, a patrilineal system.318319320 Owing to the former matrilineal system, women in Kerala enjoy a high social status.321 However, gender inequality among low caste men and women is reportedly higher compared to that in other castes.322

Gender
There are a number of possible explanations for the position of women in Kerala. The primary reason was the democratic rise of the Communist Party of India in the state, culminating in the chief ministership of EMS Namboodiripad. His government helped to distribute land and implement education reforms.323 Another reason is the tradition of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother is the head of the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families.324 Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations of both boys and girls. Low birth rate and high literacy rate are often the twin hallmarks of the healthy advancement of a society.
While having the opportunities that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit. Women who break the rules are often looked down on. Kerala is a state in flux where, despite the social progress made so far, gender still influences social mobility.325326327
Human Development Index
As of 2014, Kerala has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.790328 which comes under the "high" category and it is the highest in the country.329 Comparatively higher spending of the government in primary level education, health care and elimination of poverty from the 19th century onward has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI;330331 report was prepared by the central government's Institute of Applied Manpower Research.332333 However, the Human Development Report, 2005 prepared by Centre for Development Studies envisages a virtuous phase of inclusive development for the state since the advancement in human development had already started aiding the economic development of the state.334
According to a 2005–2006 national survey and the 2011 census, Kerala has the highest literacy rate among Indian states.335336 The life expectancy in Kerala is 74 years, among the highest in India as of 2011.337 Kerala's rural poverty rate fell from 59% (1973–1974) to 12% (1999–2010); the overall (urban and rural) rate fell 47% between the 1970s and 2000s against the 29% fall in overall poverty rate in India.338 By 1999–2000, the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10.0% and 9.6% respectively.339 These changes stem largely from efforts begun in the late 19th century by the kingdoms of Cochin and Travancore to boost social welfare.340341 This focus was maintained by Kerala's post-independence government.342343 The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organisation designated Kerala the world's first "baby-friendly state" because of its effective promotion of breast-feeding over formulas.344 Third National Family Health Survey ranks Kerala first in the list of "Institutional Delivery" with 100% births in medical facility.345 Ayurveda (both elite and popular forms),346 siddha, and many endangered and endemic modes of traditional medicine, including kalari, marmachikitsa and vishavaidyam, are practised. Some occupational communities such as Kaniyar were known as native medicine men in relation with practice of such streams of medical systems, apart from their traditional vocation.347 These propagate via gurukula discipleship,348 and comprise a fusion of both medicinal and supernatural treatments.349
Kerala has undergone the "demographic transition" characteristic of such developed nations as Canada, Japan, and Norway.350 as 11.2% of people are over the age of 60,351 and due to the low birthrate of 18 per 1,000.352 In 1991, Kerala's total fertility rate (TFR) was the lowest in India. Hindus had a TFR of 1.66, Christians; 1.78, and Muslims; 2.97.353 The sub-replacement fertility level and infant mortality rate are lower compared to those of other states; estimated from 12354355 to 14356 deaths per 1,000 live births. According to Human Development Report 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was reported to be 597; higher than any other state of India. Many factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable female-to-male ratio, had contributed to it.357 Kerala's female-to-male ratio of 1.058 is higher than that of the rest of India.358 The state also is regarded as the "least corrupt Indian state" according to the surveys conducted by Transparency International (2005)359 and India Today (1997)360
Kerala is the cleanest and healthiest state in India.361 However, Kerala's morbidity rate is higher than that of any other Indian state—118 (rural) and 88 (urban) per 1,000 people. The corresponding figures for all India were 55 and 54 per 1,000 respectively as of 2004.362 Kerala's 13.3% prevalence of low birth weight is higher than that of many first world nations.363 Outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid among the more than 50% of people who rely on 3 million water wells is an issue worsened by the lack of sewers.364 Kerala has the lowest homicide rate among Indian states, with 1.1 per 100,000 in 2011.365 In respect of women empowerment, some negative factors such as higher suicide rate, lower share of earned income, complaints of sexual harassment and limited freedom are reported.366

The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts including results—series expansion for trigonometric functions.367368 Following the instructions of the Wood's despatch of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with the support from different agencies mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives.369 The efforts by leaders, Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru and Ayyankali, towards the socially discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and different congregations of Christian churches, led to development in the mass education of Kerala.370
In 1991, Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as a completely literate state, though the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90%. As of 2007, the net enrollment in elementary education was almost 100 per cent and was almost balanced among different sexes, social groups and regions, unlike other states of India.371 The state topped the Education Development Index (EDI) among 21 major states in India in the year 2006–2007.372 According to the first Economic Census, conducted in 1977, 99.7% of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within 2 km, 98.6% had a middle school within 2 km and 96.7% had a high school or higher secondary school within 5 km.373 According to the 2011 census, Kerala has 93.91 percent literacy with the national literacy rate being 74.04 percent.374
The educational system prevailing in the state schooling is for 10 years, which are streamlined into lower primary, upper primary and secondary school stages with a 4+3+3 pattern.375 After 10 years of secondary schooling, students typically enroll in Higher Secondary Schooling in one of the three major streams—liberal arts, commerce or science.376 Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional under-graduate (UG) programmes. The majority of the public schools are affiliated with the Kerala State Education Board. Other familiar educational boards are the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), and the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self-financing schools, while government and government-aided schools offer English or Malayalam.377 Though the education cost is generally considered low in Kerala,378 according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (2004–2005), per capita spending on education by the rural households in Kerala was reported to be  41 for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in the household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.379
Universities in Kerala are Central University of Kerala, Kannur University, Mahatma Gandhi University, University of Calicut, National University of Advanced Legal Studies, University of Kerala, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kerala Agricultural University, Aligarh Muslim University Malappuram, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, EFLU Malappuram Campus, and an Islamic university (Darul Huda Islamic university). Premier educational institutions in Kerala are the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC), the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Trivandrum (IIST), The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-TVM), College of Engineering, Trivandrum(CET), and the College of Architecture, Trivandrum (CAT), Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam.
Culture
The culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it's an integral part of Indian culture.380 It has been elaborated through centuries of contact with neighboring and overseas cultures.381 However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions.382 There are around 10,000 festivals celebrated in the state.383 The Malayalam calendar, a solar calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala,384 finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities.385
Onam
Onam is a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala, India. It is also the state festival of Kerala with State holidays on 4 days starting from Onam Eve (Uthradom) to the 4th Onam Day. Onam Festival falls during the Malayalam month of Chingam (Aug–Sep) and marks the commemoration of Vamana avatara of Vishnu and the subsequent homecoming of King Mahabali. Onam is reminiscent of Kerala's agrarian past, as it is considered to be a harvest festival.
The festival falls during the Malayalam month of Chingam (Aug–Sep) and marks the homecoming of the mythical King Mahabali who Malayalees consider as their King. It is one of the festivals celebrated with most number of cultural elements. Some of them are Vallam Kali, Pulikkali, Pookkalam, Onatthappan, Thumbi Thullal, Onavillu, Kazhchakkula, Onapottan, Atthachamayam etc.
Temple Festivals
Kerala has a large number of Hindu temples. Many of the temples have unique traditions and most hold festivals on specific days of the year. Temple festivals usually continue for a number of days. A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is then brought down only on the final day of the festival. Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram. Temples that can afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities. The idol of the God in the temple is taken out on a procession around the country side atop this elephant. When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to the God. Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam.

These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal and Krishnanattam, originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses.386 Kerala natanam, Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region.387 Some traditional dance forms such as Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians,388389 while Oppana and Duffmuttu are popular among the Muslims of the state.390
Music
Development of classical music in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala.391 Development of the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich contribution that temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala.392 Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music. This was the result of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century.393 Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances.394 Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music:395 it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda. Panchavadyam is a different form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument.396 Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter.397 Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), ''Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them.398
Cinema
Malayalam films carved a niche for themselves in the Indian film industry with the presentation of social themes.399400 Directors from Kerala, like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, John Abraham, P. Padmarajan, G. Aravindan and Shaji N Karun have made a considerable contribution to the Indian parallel cinema. Kerala has also given birth to numerous actors, such as Satyan, Prem Nazir, Jayan, Adoor Bhasi, Bharath Gopi, Mammootty, Mohanlal, Suresh Gopi, Sreenivasan, Jayaram, Murali, Dileep, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, Thilakan, Jagathy Sreekumar Nedumudi Venu and KPAC Lalitha. Late Malayalam actor Prem Nazir holds the world record for having acted as the protagonist of over 720 movies.401 Since the 1980s, actors Mammootty and Mohanlal have dominated the movie industry; Mammootty has won three National Awards for best actor while Mohanlal has two to his credit.402 Malayalam Cinema has produced a few more notable personalities such as K.J. Yesudas,403 K.S. Chitra,404 Vayalar Rama Varma, M.T. Vasudevan Nair,405 and O.N.V. Kurup,406 the last two mentioned being recipients of Jnanpith award, the highest literary award in India.407
Literature
 Malayalam literature starts from the late medieval period and includes such notable writers as the 14th-century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar),408409 and the 17th-century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and poetry.410 Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar and Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran are noted for their contribution to Malayalam prose.411412413 The "triumvirate of poets" (Kavithrayam): Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon, and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, are recognised for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics, and towards a more lyrical mode.414415416
In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair and O. N. V. Kurup had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature.417418419420421 Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, had gained international recognition.422423424425
Cuisine
 
Kerala cuisine has a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine.426 Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day.427 Breakfast dishes are frequently based on the rice preparations idli, puttu, Idiyappam, or pulse-based vada or tapioca.428 These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, Appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry.429 Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar.430 Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, that is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam.431 Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam.432433434 Sea food specialities include karimeen, prawn, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.435 Kerala is one of the few places in India where there is no communal distinction between the different food types. People of all religions share the same vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.
Elephants
Elephants have been an integral part of culture of the state. Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of elephant in India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals.436 These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state. About 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants.437 In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the 'sons of the sahya.438 The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.439
Media
The media, telecommunications, broadcasting and cable services are regulated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The National Family Health Survey – 3, conducted in 2007, ranked Kerala as a state with the highest media exposure in India. Dozens of newspapers are published in Kerala, in nine major languages,440 but principally Malayalam and English.441 Most widely circulating Malayalam-language newspapers are Malayala Manorama, Mathrubhumi, Madhyamam, Deshabhimani, Mangalam, Kerala Kaumudi, Chandrika, Thejas, Udaya keralam,442 Janayugam, Janmabhumi, Deepika and Siraj Daily. Major Malayalam periodicals include Mathrubhumi, India Today Malayalam, Madhyamam Weekly, Grihalakshmi, Vanitha, Dhanam, Chithrabhumi, and Bhashaposhini. The English reading population is slowly gaining strength in Kerala. The Hindu is the largest read English language newspaper in the State; followed by Deccan Chronicle, The New Indian Express and The Times of India.
Doordarshan is the state-owned television broadcaster. Multi system operators provide a mix of Malayalam, English and international channels via cable television. Some of the popular Malayalam television channels are Asianet, Surya TV, Kiran TV, Mazhavil Manorama, Manorama News, Indiavision, Kairali TV, Kairali WE, Kairali People, Yes Indiavision, Asianet News, Asianet Plus, Asianet Movies, Amrita TV, Reporter, Jaihind, Jeevan TV, Mathrubhumi News, Kaumudi, Shalom TV, Powervision,443 Goodness,444 Athmeeyayathra,445 Kappa TV446 and Media One TV. Television serials, reality shows and the Internet have become major sources of entertainment and information for the people of Kerala. A Malayalam version of Google News was launched in September 2008.447 A sizeable "people's science" movement has taken root in the state, and such activities as writers' cooperatives are becoming increasingly common.448449 BSNL, Reliance Infocomm, Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, Tata Docomo and Aircel are the major cell phone service providers in the state.450 Broadband Internet services are widely available throughout the state; some of the major ISPs are BSNL, Asianet Satellite communications, Reliance Communications, Airtel and VSNL. According to the Telecom Regulatory Commission of India (TRAI) report, as of January 2012 the total number of wireless phone subscribers in Kerala is about 34.3 million and the wireline subscriber base is at 3.2 million, accounting for the telephone density of 107.77.451 Unlike in many other States, the urban-rural divide is not visible in Kerala with respect to mobile phone penetration.452
Sports
 By 21st century, almost all of the native sports and games from Kerala have either disappeared or become just an art form performed during local festivals; including Poorakkali, Padayani, Thalappandukali, Onathallu, Parichamuttukali, Velakali, Kilithattukali etc.453 However, Kalaripayattu, regarded as "the mother of all martial arts in the world", as an exception was practised as indigenous martial sport.454 Another traditional sport of Kerala is the boat race, especially the race of Snake boats.455
Cricket and football became popular in the state; both were introduced in Malabar during the British colonial period in the 19th century. Cricketers, like Tinu Yohannan, Abey Kuruvilla, Sreesanth and Sanju Samson, found places in the national cricket team. However, the Kerala cricket team had never won or performed well at the Ranji Trophy.456 A cricket club from Kerala, the Kochi Tuskers, played in the Indian Premier League's fourth season. However, the team was disbanded after the season because of conflict of interests among its franchises.457 Football is one of the most widely played and watched sports with huge support for club and district level matches. Kerala is one of the major footballing states in India along with West Bengal and Goa and has produced national players of the likes of I. M. Vijayan, C. V. Pappachan, V. P. Sathyan, Jo Paul Ancheri, and Pappachen Pradeep.458459 The Kerala state football team had won the Santhosh Trophy five times; in 1973, 1992, 1993, 2001 and 2004. They were also the runners-up eight times.460
Among the prominent athletes hailing from the state are P. T. Usha, Shiny Wilson and M.D. Valsamma, all three of whom are recipients of Padma Shri as well as Arjuna Award, while K. M. Beenamol and Anju Bobby George are Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and Arjuna Award winners. T. C. Yohannan, Suresh Babu, Sinimol Paulose, Angel Mary Joseph, Mercy Kuttan, K. Saramma, K. C. Rosakutty and Padmini Selvan are the other Arjuna Award winners from Kerala.461462 Volleyball is another popular sport463 and is often played on makeshift courts on sandy beaches along the coast. Jimmy George was a notable Indian volleyball player, rated in his prime as among the world's ten best players.464 Other popular sports include badminton, basketball and kabaddi.465
Tourism
Its culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. National Geographic's Traveller magazine names Kerala as one of the "ten paradises of the world"466467 and "50 must see destinations of a lifetime".468 Travel and Leisure names Kerala as "One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century".469470471 In 2012, it overtook Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India.472 Kerala's beaches, backwaters, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries are major attractions for both domestic and international tourists. The city of Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourists in Kerala.473474
Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination to other states of the country.475 In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism as an industry and it was the first state in India to do so.476 Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the tourism industry.477 Many advertisements branded Kerala with a catchy tagline Kerala, God's Own Country.478 Today, Kerala tourism is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest recall.479 In 2006, Kerala attracted 8.5 million tourist arrivals, an increase of 23.68% over the previous year, making the state one of the fastest-growing destinations in the world.480 In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million mark.481
Ayurvedic tourism became very popular since the 1990s, and private agencies have played a notable role in tandem with the initiatives of Tourism Department.482 Kerala is known for its ecotourism initiatives and in this segment it promotes mountaineering, trekking and bird-watching programmes in the Western Ghats as the major products.483 As of 2005, the state's tourism industry was a major contributor to the state's economy, which is currently growing at a rate of 13.31%.484 The revenue from tourism increased five-fold between 2001 and 2011 and crossed the  190 billion mark in 2011. Moreover, the industry provides employment opportunity to approximately 1.2 million people.485
Asia's largest and World's third largest Naval Academy-Ezhimala Naval Academy-at Kannur is in Kerala. Idukki arch dam-World's second and Asia's first arch dam is in Kerala. The most popular tourist attractions in the state are beaches, backwaters and hill stations. Major beaches are at Kovalam, Varkala, Fort Kochi, Cherai, Payyambalam, Kappad, Muzhappilangad (South India's only drive-in beach) and Bekal. Popular hill stations are at Munnar, Wayanad, Wagamon, Peermade, Paithalmala, Nelliampathi and Ponmudi.486 Munnar is 4500 feet above sea level and is known for various tea plantations, and rich spread of flora and fauna.487 Kerala's ecotourism destinations include 12 wildlife sanctuaries and two national parks: Periyar Tiger Reserve, Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary, Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Thattekad Bird Sanctuary, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Eravikulam National Park, and Silent Valley National Park are the most popular among them.488 The "backwaters" are an extensive network of interlocking rivers (41 west-flowing rivers), lakes, and canals that center around Alleppey, Kumarakom and Punnamada (where the annual Nehru Trophy Boat Race is held in August). Padmanabhapuram Palace and the Mattancherry Palace are two notable heritage sites. According to a survey conducted among foreign tourists, Elephants, fireworks display and huge crowd are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram. Nemmara Vela is also famous for the fireworks.489
