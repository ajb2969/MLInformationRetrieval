   Femtosecond      Femtosecond   A femtosecond is the SI unit of time equal to 10 −15 or 1 / 1,000,000,000,000,000 of a second. That is one quadrillionth, or one millionth of one billionth, of a second . 1 For context, a femtosecond is to a second as a second is to about 31.7 million years; a ray of light travels approximately 0.3 µm (micrometers) in 1 femtosecond, a distance comparable to the diameter of a virus . 2  The word femtosecond is formed by the SI prefix  femto and the SI unit  second . Its symbol is fs . 3  A femtosecond is equal to 1000 attoseconds , or 1/1000 picosecond . Because the next higher SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10 −14 and 10 −13 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of femtoseconds.  Shorter Times   Typical time steps for molecular dynamics simulations are on the order of 1 fs. 4  The waves of visible light oscillate with a period (reciprocal frequency ) of about 2 femtoseconds     λ  c   =     600  ×    10   -  9      m     3  ×    10  8      m    s   -  1      =    2.0  ×    10   -  15      s           λ  c         600   superscript  10    9     normal-m       3   superscript  10  8    normal-m   superscript  normal-s    1               2.0   superscript  10    15     normal-s      {\lambda\over{c}}={600\times 10^{-9}~{}{\rm m}\over 3\times 10^{8}~{}{\rm m}~{%

(See wave-particle duality ) This time can be calculated by dividing the wavelength of the light by the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10 8 m/s) to determine the time required for light to travel that distance. 5   1.3 fs – cycle time for 390 nanometer light, at the transition between violet visible light and ultraviolet 6  2.57 fs – cycle time for 770 nanometer light, at the transition between red visible light and near- infrared 7   15 fs – the swiftest chemical reaction , such as the absorption of a light photon in the Photosynthetic antenna molecule  200 fs – the average chemical reaction , such as the reaction of pigments in an eye to light 8  300 fs – the duration of a vibration of the atoms in an iodine molecule 9   Longer Times  See also   Femtochemistry  Femtosecond pulse shaping  Ultrafast laser spectroscopy  SI unit  Second  Microsecond  Millisecond  Nanosecond  Picosecond  Orders of magnitude (time)   References  de:Sekunde#Abgeleitete Maßeinheiten  fr:1 E-15 s "  Category:Orders of magnitude (time)     ↩  Compared with overview in:  Page 3 ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩     ↩
