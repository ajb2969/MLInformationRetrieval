Draft:Hamiltonian group action

In differential geometry, a Hamiltonian group action is a group action by a Lie group on a symplectic manifold 
 
 
 
  with a moment map

 
 .
One of the driving forces for the study of Hamiltonian group action is its application to moduli spaces; for example, the moduli space of flat connections.1 (This article however focuses on finite-dimensional spaces.)
