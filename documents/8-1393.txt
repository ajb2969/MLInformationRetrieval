Itō isometry

In mathematics, the Itō isometry, named after Kiyoshi Itō, is a crucial fact about Itō stochastic integrals. One of its main applications is to enable the computation of variances for stochastic processes.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the canonical real-valued Wiener process defined up to time 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a stochastic process that is adapted to the natural filtration

 
 
  of the Wiener process. Then



where 
 
 
 
  denotes expectation with respect to classical Wiener measure

 
 . In other words, the Itō stochastic integral, as a function, is an isometry of normed vector spaces with respect to the norms induced by the inner products



and
