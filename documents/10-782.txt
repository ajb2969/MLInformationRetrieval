(Iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase




(Iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a (iso)eugenol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + isoeugenol 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + isomethyleugenol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and isoeugenol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and isomethyleugenol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:isoeugenol O-methyltransferase.
