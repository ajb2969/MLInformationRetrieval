Sulfopropanediol 3-dehydrogenase

Sulfopropanediol 3-dehydrogenase (, DHPS 3-dehydrogenase (sulfolactate forming), 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate 3-dehydrogenase (sulfolactate forming), dihydroxypropanesulfonate 3-dehydrogenase, hpsN (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (R)-2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate:NAD+ 3-oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(R)-2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate + 2 NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  (R)-3-sulfolactate + 2 NADH + 2 H+


The enzyme is involved in degradation of (R)-2,3-dihydroxypropanesulfonate.
