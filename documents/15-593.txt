Agrawal's conjecture




Agrawal's conjecture

In number theory, Agrawal's conjecture, due to Manindra Agrawal in 2002,1 forms the basis for the cyclotomic AKS test. Agrawal's conjecture states formally:
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two coprime positive integers. If



then either 
 
 
 
  is prime or 
 
 

Ramifications
If Agrawal's conjecture were true, it would decrease the runtime complexity of the AKS primality test from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
Truth or falsehood
Agrawal's conjecture has been computationally verified for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , however a heuristic argument by Carl Pomerance and Hendrik W. Lenstra suggests there is an infinite number of counterexamples.2 In particular, the heuristic shows that such counterexamples have asymptotic density greater than 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 .
Assuming Agrawal's conjecture is false by the above argument, a modified version (the Agrawal–Popovych conjecture3) may still be true:
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two coprime positive integers. If



and



then either 
 
 
 
  is prime or 
 
 
 
 .
