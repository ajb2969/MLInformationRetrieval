   Spache readability formula      Spache readability formula   The Spache readability formula is a readability test for writing in English, designed by George Spache . It works best on texts that are for children up to fourth grade . For older children, the Dale–Chall readability formula is more appropriate.  It was introduced in 1952 in Spache's "A new readability formula for primary-grade reading materials," ( The Elementary School Journal , 53, 410–413), and has subsequently been revised.  Calculation  The method compares words in a text to a set list of everyday words. The number of words per sentence and the percentage of unfamiliar words determine the reading age.  The original formula was:      Grade Level  =    (   0.141  ×  Average sentence length   )   +   (   0.086  ×  Number of unique unfamiliar words   )   +  0.839       Grade Level      0.141  Average sentence length     0.086  Number of unique unfamiliar words   0.839     \mbox{Grade Level}=\left(0.141\times\mbox{Average sentence length}\right)+%
 \left(0.086\times\mbox{Number of unique unfamiliar words}\right)+0.839     The revised formula is:      Grade Level  =    (   0.121  ×  Average sentence length   )   +   (   0.082  ×  Number of unique unfamiliar words   )   +  0.659       Grade Level      0.121  Average sentence length     0.082  Number of unique unfamiliar words   0.659     \mbox{Grade Level}=\left(0.121\times\mbox{Average sentence length}\right)+%
 \left(0.082\times\mbox{Number of unique unfamiliar words}\right)+0.659     Further reading    Clarence R. Stone.
