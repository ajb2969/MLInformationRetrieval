   Orsellinate-depside hydrolase      Orsellinate-depside hydrolase   In enzymology , an orsellinate-depside hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   orsellinate depside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 orsellinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are orsellinate depside and H 2 O , whereas its product is orsellinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is orsellinate-depside hydrolase . This enzyme is also called lecanorate hydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
