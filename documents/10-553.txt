   Inositol 2-dehydrogenase      Inositol 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an inositol 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   myo-inositol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are myo-inositol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is myo-inositol:NAD + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include myo-inositol 2-dehydrogenase , myo-inositol:NAD + oxidoreductase , inositol dehydrogenase , and myo-inositol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in inositol metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
