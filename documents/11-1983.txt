   Saturated-surface-dry      Saturated-surface-dry   Saturated surface dry (SSD) is defined as the condition of an aggregate in which the surfaces of the particles are "dry" ( i.e. , surface adsorption would no longer take place), but the inter-particle voids are saturated with water. In this condition aggregates will not affect the free water content of a composite material . 1 2  The water adsorption by mass (A m )) is defined in terms of the mass of saturated-surface-dry (M ssd ) sample and the mass of oven dried test sample (M dry ) by      A  =     M   s  s  d    -   M   d  r  y      M   d  r  y         A       subscript  M    s  s  d     subscript  M    d  r  y      subscript  M    d  r  y       A=\frac{M_{ssd}-M_{dry}}{M_{dry}}     See also   Construction aggregate   References  3- Neville, A.
