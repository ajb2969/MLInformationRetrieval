<h1>Static hashing</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Static Hashing</strong> is another form of the hashing problem which allows users to perform lookups on a finalized dictionary set (all objects in the dictionary are final and not changing).</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></h2>
<h3 id="application">Application</h3>

<p>Since static hashing requires that the <a class="uri" href="database" title="wikilink">database</a>, its objects and reference remain the same its applications are limited. Databases which contain information which changes rarely are also eligible as it would only require a full rehash of the entire database on rare occasion. Examples of this include sets of words and definitions of specific languages, sets of significant data for an organization's personnel, etc.</p>
<h3 id="perfect-hashing">Perfect Hashing</h3>

<p>Perfect hashing is a model of hashing in which any set of n elements can be stored in a <a href="hash_table" title="wikilink">hash table</a> of equal size and can have lookups done in constant time. It was specifically discovered and discussed by Fredman, Komlos and Szemeredi (1984) and has therefore been nicknamed "FKS Hashing".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="fks-hashing">FKS Hashing</h2>

<p>FKS Hashing makes use of a hash table with two levels in which the top level contains n buckets which each contain their own hash table. FKS hashing requires that if collisions occur they must do so only on the top level.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>The top level contains a randomly created hash function, h(x), which fits within the constraints of a Carter and Wegman hash function - seen in <a href="Universal_hashing" title="wikilink">Universal hashing</a>. Having done so the top level shall contain n buckets labeled k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, ..., k<sub>n</sub>. Following this pattern, all of the buckets hold a hash table of size s<sub>i</sub> and a respective hash function, h<sub>i</sub>(x). The hash function will be decided by setting s<sub>i</sub> to k<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> and randomly going through functions until there are no collisions. This can be done in constant time.</p>

 pairs of elements, of which have a probability of collision equal to 1/n, FKS hashing can expect to have strictly less than n/2 collisions. Based on this fact and that each h(x) was selected so that the number of collisions would be at most n/2, the size of each table on the lower level will be no greater than 2n.</p>
