   4-acetamidobutyryl-CoA deacetylase      4-acetamidobutyryl-CoA deacetylase   In enzymology , a 4-acetamidobutyryl-CoA deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-acetamidobutanoyl-CoA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + 4-aminobutanoyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-acetamidobutanoyl-CoA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acetate and 4-aminobutanoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-acetamidobutanoyl-CoA amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include aminobutyryl-CoA thiolesterase , and deacetylase-thiolesterase .
