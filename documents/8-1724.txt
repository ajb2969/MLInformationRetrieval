Lipschitz domain

In mathematics, a Lipschitz domain (or domain with Lipschitz boundary) is a domain in Euclidean space whose boundary is "sufficiently regular" in the sense that it can be thought of as locally being the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function. The term is named after the German mathematician Rudolf Lipschitz.
Definition
Let n ∈ N, and let Ω be an open subset of Rn. Let ∂Ω denote the boundary of Ω. Then Ω is said to have Lipschitz boundary, and is called a Lipschitz domain, if, for every point p ∈ ∂Ω, there exists a radius r > 0 and a map hp : Br(p) → Q such that

hp is a bijection;
hp and hp−1 are both Lipschitz continuous functions;
hp(∂Ω ∩ Br(p)) = Q0;
hp(Ω ∩ Br(p)) = Q+;

where



denotes the n-dimensional open ball of radius r about p, Q denotes the unit ball B1(0), and






Applications of Lipschitz domains
Many of the Sobolev embedding theorems require that the domain of study be a Lipschitz domain. Consequently, many partial differential equations and variational problems are defined on Lipschitz domains.
