   Lipschitz domain      Lipschitz domain   In mathematics , a Lipschitz domain (or domain with Lipschitz boundary ) is a domain in Euclidean space whose boundary is "sufficiently regular" in the sense that it can be thought of as locally being the graph of a Lipschitz continuous function . The term is named after the German  mathematician  Rudolf Lipschitz .  Definition  Let n ∈ N , and let Ω be an open  subset of R n . Let ∂Ω denote the boundary of Ω. Then Ω is said to have Lipschitz boundary , and is called a Lipschitz domain , if, for every point p ∈ ∂Ω, there exists a radius r > 0 and a map h p : B r ( p ) → Q such that   h p is a bijection ;  h p and h p −1 are both Lipschitz continuous functions;  h p (∂Ω ∩ B r ( p )) = Q 0 ;  h p (Ω ∩ B r ( p )) = Q + ;   where        B  r    (  p  )    :=   {   x  ∈   ℝ  n    |    ∥   x  -  p   ∥   <  r   }      assign     subscript  B  r   p    conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  n       norm    x  p    r      B_{r}(p):=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}|\|x-p\|     denotes the n - dimensional  open ball of radius r about p , Q denotes the unit ball B 1 (0), and        Q  0   :=   {    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   ∈  Q   |    x  n   =  0   }    ;     assign   subscript  Q  0    conditional-set      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    Q      subscript  x  n   0      Q_{0}:=\{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\in Q|x_{n}=0\};           Q  +   :=   {    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   ∈  Q   |    x  n   >  0   }    .     assign   subscript  Q     conditional-set      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    Q      subscript  x  n   0      Q_{+}:=\{(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\in Q|x_{n}>0\}.     Applications of Lipschitz domains  Many of the Sobolev embedding theorems require that the domain of study be a Lipschitz domain. Consequently, many partial differential equations and variational problems are defined on Lipschitz domains.  References     "  Category:Geometry  Category:Lipschitz maps  Category:Sobolev spaces
