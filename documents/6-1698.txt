   Kretschmann scalar      Kretschmann scalar   In the theory of Lorentzian manifolds , particularly in the context of applications to general relativity , the Kretschmann scalar is a quadratic scalar invariant . It was introduced by Erich Kretschmann . 1  Definition  The Kretschmann invariant is 2 3      K  =     R   a  b  c  d      R   a  b  c  d         K     subscript  R    a  b  c  d     superscript  R    a  b  c  d       K=R_{abcd}\,R^{abcd}   where    R   a  b  c  d      subscript  R    a  b  c  d     R_{abcd}   is the Riemann curvature tensor . Because it is a sum of squares of tensor components, this is a quadratic invariant.  For Schwarzschild black hole , the Kretschmann scalar is 4       K  =     48   G  2    M  2      c  4    r  6       .      K      48   superscript  G  2    superscript  M  2       superscript  c  4    superscript  r  6       K=\frac{48G^{2}M^{2}}{c^{4}r^{6}}\,.     Relation to other invariants  Another possible invariant (which has been employed for example in writing the gravitational term of the Lagrangian for some higher-order gravity theories) is        C   a  b  c  d      C   a  b  c  d         subscript  C    a  b  c  d     superscript  C    a  b  c  d      C_{abcd}\,C^{abcd}   where    C   a  b  c  d      subscript  C    a  b  c  d     C_{abcd}   is the Weyl tensor , the conformal curvature tensor which is also the completely traceless part of the Riemann tensor. In   d   d   d   dimensions this is related to the Kretschmann invariant by 5         R   a  b  c  d      R   a  b  c  d     =       C   a  b  c  d      C   a  b  c  d     +    4   d  -  2      R   a  b      R   a  b      -    2    (   d  -  1   )    (   d  -  2   )      R  2            subscript  R    a  b  c  d     superscript  R    a  b  c  d            subscript  C    a  b  c  d     superscript  C    a  b  c  d         4    d  2     subscript  R    a  b     superscript  R    a  b          2      d  1     d  2      superscript  R  2       R_{abcd}\,R^{abcd}=C_{abcd}\,C^{abcd}+\frac{4}{d-2}R_{ab}\,R^{ab}-\frac{2}{(d-%
 1)(d-2)}R^{2}   where    R   a  b      superscript  R    a  b     R^{ab}   is the Ricci curvature tensor and   R   R   R   is the Ricci scalar curvature (obtained by taking successive traces of the Riemann tensor). The Ricci tensor vanishes in vacuum spacetimes (such as the Schwarzschild solution mentioned above), and hence there the Riemann tensor and the Weyl tensor coincide, as do their invariants.  The Kretschmann scalar and the Chern-Pontryagin scalar        R   a  b  c  d      R    a  b  c  d     ⋆        subscript  R    a  b  c  d     superscript   superscript  R    a  b  c  d    normal-⋆     R_{abcd}\,{{}^{\star}\!R}^{abcd}   where    R    a  b  c  d     ⋆     superscript   superscript  R    a  b  c  d    normal-⋆    {{}^{\star}R}^{abcd}   is the left dual of the Riemann tensor, are mathematically analogous (to some extent, physically analogous) to the familiar invariants of the electromagnetic field tensor         F   a  b      F   a  b     ,     F   a  b      F    a  b     ⋆          subscript  F    a  b     superscript  F    a  b        subscript  F    a  b     superscript   superscript  F    a  b    normal-⋆      F_{ab}\,F^{ab},\;\;F_{ab}\,{{}^{\star}\!F}^{ab}     See also   Carminati-McLenaghan invariants , for a set of invariants.
