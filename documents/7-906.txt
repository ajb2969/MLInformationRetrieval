Method of averaging

In the study of dynamical systems, the method of averaging is used to study certain time-varying systems by analyzing easier, time-invariant systems obtained by averaging the original system.
Definition
Consider a general, nonlinear dynamical system



where 
 
 
 
  is periodic in 
 
 
 
  with period 
 
 
 
 . The evolution of this system is said to occur in two timescales: a fast oscillatory one associated with the presence of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and a slow one associated with the presence of 
 
 
 
  in front of 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding (leading order in 
 
 
 
 ) averaged system is



Averaging mods out the fast oscillatory dynamics by averaging their effect (through time integration - see the formula above). In this way, the mean (or long-term) behavior of the system is retained in the form of the dynamical equation for the evolution for 
 
 
 
 . Standard methods for time-invariant (autonomous) systems may then be employed to analyze the equilibria (and their stability) as well as other dynamical objects of interest present in the phase space of the averaged system.
Example
Consider a simple pendulum whose point of suspension is vibrated vertically by a small amplitude, high frequency signal (this is usually known as dithering). The equation of motion for such a pendulum is given by



where 
 
 
 
  describes the motion of the suspension point and 
 
 
 
  is the angle made by the pendulum with the vertical.
The state space form of this equation is given as
