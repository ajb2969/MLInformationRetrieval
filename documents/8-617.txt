   Abel equation      Abel equation   The Abel equation , named after Niels Henrik Abel , is a type of functional equations which can be written in the form       f   (   h   (  x  )    )    =   h   (   x  +  1   )          f    h  x      h    x  1      f(h(x))=h(x+1)   or, equivalently,       α   (   f   (  x  )    )    =    α   (  x  )    +  1         α    f  x        α  x   1     \alpha(f(x))=\alpha(x)+1   and controls the iteration of   f   f   f   .  Equivalence  These equations are equivalent. Assuming that   α   α   α   is an invertible function , the second equation can be written as         α   -  1     (   α   (   f   (  x  )    )    )    =    α   -  1     (    α   (  x  )    +  1   )     .         superscript  α    1      α    f  x        superscript  α    1        α  x   1      \alpha^{-1}(\alpha(f(x)))=\alpha^{-1}(\alpha(x)+1)\,.     Taking  α −1 ( y )}} , the equation can be written as          f   (    α   -  1     (  y  )    )    =    α   -  1     (   y  +  1   )     .        f     superscript  α    1    y       superscript  α    1      y  1      f(\alpha^{-1}(y))=\alpha^{-1}(y+1)\,.        For a function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   assumed to be known, the task is to solve the functional equation for the function , possibly satisfying additional requirements, such as 1}} .  The change of variables Ψ( x )}} , for a real parameter   s   s   s   , brings Abel's equation into the celebrated Schröder's equation ,     Ψ   (   f   (  x  )    )    =   s  Ψ   (  x  )          normal-Ψ    f  x      s  normal-Ψ  x     Ψ(f(x))=sΨ(x)   .  The further change exp( s α ( x ) )}} into Böttcher's equation ,  F ( x ) s }} .  The Abel equation is a special case of (and easily generalizes to) the translation equation , 1        ω   (   ω   (  x  ,  u  )    ,  v  )    =   ω   (  x  ,   u  +  v   )     ,        ω     ω   x  u    v      ω   x    u  v       \omega(\omega(x,u),v)=\omega(x,u+v)~{},   e.g., for     ω   (  x  ,  1  )    =   f   (  x  )          ω   x  1      f  x     \omega(x,1)=f(x)   ,       ω   (  x  ,  u  )    =    α   -  1     (    α   (  x  )    +  u   )          ω   x  u       superscript  α    1        α  x   u      \omega(x,u)=\alpha^{-1}(\alpha(x)+u)   .     (Observe     ω   (  x  ,  0  )    =  x        ω   x  0    x    ω(x,0)=x   .)  History  Initially, the equation in the more general form 2  3 was reported. Even in the case of a single variable, the equation is non-trivial, and admits special analysis. 4  5 6  In the case of a linear transfer function, the solution is expressible compactly. 7  Special cases  The equation of tetration is a special case of Abel's equation, with    f  =   e  x  p       f    e  x  p     f=exp   .  In the case of an integer argument, the equation encodes a recurrent procedure, e.g.,        α   (   f   (   f   (  x  )    )    )    =    α   (  x  )    +   2     ,        α    f    f  x         α  x   2     \alpha(f(f(x)))=\alpha(x)+2~{},   and so on,        α   (    f  n    (  x  )    )    =    α   (  x  )    +   n     .        α     subscript  f  n   x        α  x   n     \alpha(f_{n}(x))=\alpha(x)+n~{}.
