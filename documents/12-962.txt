   Semialgebraic space      Semialgebraic space   In mathematics , especially in real algebraic geometry , a semialgebraic space is a space which is locally isomorphic to a semialgebraic set .  Definition  Let U be an open subset of R n for some n . A semialgebraic function on U is defined to be a continuous  real -valued function on U whose restriction to any semialgebraic set contained in U has a graph which is a semialgebraic subset of the product space R n × R . This endows R n with a sheaf    𝒪   𝐑  n      subscript  𝒪   superscript  𝐑  n     \mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}   of semialgebraic functions.  (For example, any polynomial mapping between semialgebraic sets is a semialgebraic function, as is the maximum of two semialgebraic functions.)  A semialgebraic space is a locally ringed space     (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )     X   subscript  𝒪  X     (X,\mathcal{O}_{X})   which is locally isomorphic to R n with its sheaf of semialgebraic functions.
