   Spin tensor      Spin tensor    Not to be confused with tensor products of spin representations .    In mathematics , mathematical physics , and theoretical physics , the spin tensor is a quantity used to describe the rotational motion of particles in spacetime . The tensor has application in general relativity and special relativity , as well as quantum mechanics , relativistic quantum mechanics , and quantum field theory .  The Euclidean group SE(d) of direct isometries is generated by translations and rotations . Its Lie algebra is written    𝔰  𝔢   (  d  )       𝔰  𝔢  d    \mathfrak{se}(d)   .  This article uses Cartesian coordinates and tensor index notation .  Background on Noether currents  The Noether current for translations in space is momentum, while the current for increments in time is energy. These two statements combine into one in spacetime: translations in spacetime, i.e. a displacement between two events, is generated by the four-momentum P . Conservation of four-momentum is given by the continuity equation :         ∂  ν    T   μ  ν     =   0    ,        subscript   ν    superscript  T    μ  ν     0    \partial_{\nu}T^{\mu\nu}=0\,,     where     T   μ  ν       superscript  T    μ  ν     T^{\mu\nu}\,   is the stress–energy tensor , and ∂ are partial derivatives that make up the four gradient (in non-Cartesian coordinates this must be replaced by the covariant derivative ). Integrating over spacetime:       ∫    d  4   x   T   μ  0     (   x  →   ,  t  )     =   P  μ            superscript  d  4   x   superscript  T    μ  0      normal-→  x   t      superscript  P  μ     \int d^{4}xT^{\mu 0}(\vec{x},t)=P^{\mu}     gives the four-momentum vector at time t .  The Noether current for a rotation about the point y is given by a tensor of 3rd order, denoted    M  y   α  β  μ      subscript   superscript  M    α  β  μ    y    M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_{y}   . Because of the Lie algebra relations         M  y   α  β  μ     (  x  )    =      M  0   α  β  μ     (  x  )    +    y  α    T   β  μ     (  x  )     -    y  β    T   α  μ     (  x  )      ,         subscript   superscript  M    α  β  μ    y   x          subscript   superscript  M    α  β  μ    0   x      superscript  y  α    superscript  T    β  μ    x       superscript  y  β    superscript  T    α  μ    x      M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_{y}(x)=M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_{0}(x)+y^{\alpha}T^{\beta\mu}(x)-%
 y^{\beta}T^{\alpha\mu}(x)\,,     where the 0 subscript indicates the origin (unlike momentum, angular momentum depends on the origin), the integral:      ∫    d  4   x   M  0   μ  ν     (   x  →   ,  t  )           superscript  d  4   x   subscript   superscript  M    μ  ν    0     normal-→  x   t      \int d^{4}xM^{\mu\nu}_{0}(\vec{x},t)     gives the angular momentum tensor     M   μ  ν       superscript  M    μ  ν     M^{\mu\nu}\,   at time t .  Definition  The spin tensor is defined at a point x to be the value of the Noether current at x of a rotation about x ,        S   α  β  μ     (  𝐱  )      =  def      M  x   α  β  μ     (  𝐱  )    =      M  0   α  β  μ     (  𝐱  )    +    x  α    T   β  μ     (  𝐱  )     -    x  β    T   α  μ     (  𝐱  )           superscript   def      superscript  S    α  β  μ    𝐱      subscript   superscript  M    α  β  μ    x   𝐱               subscript   superscript  M    α  β  μ    0   𝐱      superscript  x  α    superscript  T    β  μ    𝐱       superscript  x  β    superscript  T    α  μ    𝐱       S^{\alpha\beta\mu}(\mathbf{x})\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ M^{\alpha\beta\mu}%

 \mathbf{x})-x^{\beta}T^{\alpha\mu}(\mathbf{x})     The continuity equation         ∂  μ    M  0   α  β  μ     =   0    ,        subscript   μ    subscript   superscript  M    α  β  μ    0    0    \partial_{\mu}M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_{0}=0\,,     implies:        ∂  μ    S   α  β  μ     =    T   β  α    -   T   α  β     ≠  0          subscript   μ    superscript  S    α  β  μ        superscript  T    β  α     superscript  T    α  β          0     \partial_{\mu}S^{\alpha\beta\mu}=T^{\beta\alpha}-T^{\alpha\beta}\neq 0     and therefore, the stress–energy tensor is not a symmetric tensor .  The quantity S is the density of spin angular momentum (spin in this case is not only for a point-like particle, but also for an extended bodies), and M is the density of orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum is always the sum of spin and orbital contributions.  The relation:       T   i  j    -   T   j  i         subscript  T    i  j     subscript  T    j  i      T_{ij}-T_{ji}     gives the torque density showing the rate of conversion between the orbital angular momentum and spin.  Examples  Examples of materials with a nonzero spin density are molecular fluids , the electromagnetic field and turbulent fluids . For molecular fluids, the individual molecules may be spinning. The electromagnetic field can have circularly polarized light . For turbulent fluids, we may arbitrarily make a distinction between long wavelength phenomena and short wavelength phenomena. A long wavelength vorticity may be converted via turbulence into tinier and tinier vortices transporting the angular momentum into smaller and smaller wavelengths while simultaneously reducing the vorticity . This can be approximated by the eddy viscosity .
