   Landau–Ramanujan constant      Landau–Ramanujan constant   In mathematics , the Landau–Ramanujan constant occurs in a number theory result stating that the number of positive integers less than x that are the sum of two square numbers , for large x , varies as       x  /    ln   (  x  )      .      x      x      x/{\sqrt{\ln(x)}}.     The constant of proportionality is the Landau–Ramanujan constant, which was discovered independently by Edmund Landau and Srinivasa Ramanujan .  More formally, if N ( x ) is the number of positive integers less than x that are the sum of two squares, then        lim   x  →  ∞      N   (  x  )     ln   (  x  )      x    ≈  0.76422365358922066299069873125.        subscript    normal-→  x         N  x      x     x    0.76422365358922066299069873125.    \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{N(x)\sqrt{\ln(x)}}{x}\approx 0.7642236535892206%
