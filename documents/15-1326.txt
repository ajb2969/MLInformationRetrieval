TRNA (carboxymethyluridine34-5-O)-methyltransferase

TRNA (carboxymethyluridine34-5-O)-methyltransferase (, ALKBH8, ABH8, Trm9, tRNA methyltransferase 9) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (carboxymethyluridine34-5-O)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + carboxymethyluridine34 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)uridine34 in tRNA
 

The enzyme catalyses the posttranslational modification of uridine residues at the wobble position 34 of the anticodon loop of tRNA.
