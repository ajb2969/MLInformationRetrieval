Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase

In enzymology, a mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2(alpha-D-mannosyl)-3-phosphoglycerate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2(alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glycerate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2(alpha-D-mannosyl)-3-phosphoglycerate and H2O, whereas its two products are 2(alpha-D-mannosyl)-D-glycerate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphohydrolase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
