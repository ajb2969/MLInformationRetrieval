<p>A <strong>gas engine</strong> is an <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a> which runs on a gas fuel, such as <a href="coal_gas" title="wikilink">coal gas</a>, <a href="producer_gas" title="wikilink">producer gas</a>, <a class="uri" href="biogas" title="wikilink">biogas</a>, <a href="landfill_gas" title="wikilink">landfill gas</a> or <a href="natural_gas" title="wikilink">natural gas</a>. In the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">UK</a>, the term is unambiguous. In the <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">US</a>, due to the widespread use of "gas" as an abbreviation for <a class="uri" href="gasoline" title="wikilink">gasoline</a>, such an engine might also be called a gaseous-fueled engine or natural gas engine or spark ignited.</p>

<p>Generally the term <em>gas engine</em> refers to a heavy-duty industrial engine capable of running continuously at full load for periods approaching a high fraction of 8,760 hours per year. Unlike a gasoline automobile engine, which is lightweight, high-revving and typically runs for no more than 4,000 hours in its entire life. Typical power ranges from  to .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="lenoir">Lenoir</h3>

<p>There were many experiments with gas engines in the 19th century but the first practical gas fuelled <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a> was built by the Belgian engineer <a href="Étienne_Lenoir" title="wikilink">Étienne Lenoir</a> in 1860.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, the Lenoir engine suffered from a low power output and high fuel consumption.</p>
<h3 id="otto-and-langen">Otto and Langen</h3>

<p>His work was further researched and improved by a German engineer <a href="Nikolaus_August_Otto" title="wikilink">Nikolaus August Otto</a>, who was later to invent the first 4-stroke engine to efficiently burn fuel directly in a piston chamber. In August 1864 Otto met <a href="Eugen_Langen" title="wikilink">Eugen Langen</a> who, being technically trained, glimpsed the potential of Otto's development, and one month after the meeting, founded the first engine factory in the world, NA Otto &amp; Cie, in Cologne. In 1867 Otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the Grand Prize at the 1867 Paris World Exhibition. This atmospheric engine worked by drawing a mixture of gas and air into a vertical cylinder. When the piston has risen about eight inches, the gas and air mixture is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside, which forces the piston (which is connected to a toothed rack) upwards, creating a partial vacuum beneath it. No work is done on the upward stroke. The work is done when the piston and toothed rack descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight, turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall. Its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand, making it ideal for intermittent work such as barge loading or unloading.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="four-stroke-engine">Four-stroke engine</h3>

<p>The atmospheric gas engine was in turn replaced by Otto's <a href="four-stroke_engine" title="wikilink">four-stroke engine</a>. The changeover to four-stroke engines was remarkably rapid with the last atmospheric engines being made in 1877. Liquid fuelled engines soon followed using diesel (around 1898) or gasoline (petrol) (around 1900).</p>
<h3 id="crossley">Crossley</h3>

<p>The best-known builder of gas engines in the <a class="uri" href="UK" title="wikilink">UK</a> was <a class="uri" href="Crossley" title="wikilink">Crossley</a> of Manchester, who in 1869 acquired the UK and world (except German) rights to the patents of Otto and Langden for the new gas fuelled atmospheric engine. In 1876 they acquired the rights to the more efficient Otto four stroke cycle engine.</p>
<h3 id="tangye">Tangye</h3>

<p>There were several other firms based in the <a class="uri" href="Manchester" title="wikilink">Manchester</a> area as well. <a href="Richard_Tangye" title="wikilink">Tangye Ltd.</a>, of Smethwick, near Birmingham, sold its first gas engine, a 1 <a href="nominal_horsepower" title="wikilink">nominal horsepower</a> two-cycle type, in 1881, and in 1890 the firm commenced manufacture of the four-cycle gas engine.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="preservation">Preservation</h3>

<p>The <a href="Anson_Engine_Museum" title="wikilink">Anson Engine Museum</a> in <a class="uri" href="Poynton" title="wikilink">Poynton</a>, near <a class="uri" href="Stockport" title="wikilink">Stockport</a>, <a class="uri" href="England" title="wikilink">England</a>, has a collection of engines that includes several working gas engines, including the largest running <a class="uri" href="Crossley" title="wikilink">Crossley</a> atmospheric engine ever made.</p>
<h2 id="current-manufacturers">Current manufacturers</h2>

<p>Manufacturers of gas engines include <a href="Hyundai_Heavy_Industries" title="wikilink">Hyundai Heavy Industries</a>, Rolls-Royce with the <a href="Bergen_Marine" title="wikilink">Bergen-Engines AS</a>, <a href="Kawasaki_Heavy_Industries" title="wikilink">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a>, <a href="MTU_Friedrichshafen" title="wikilink">MTU Friedrichshafen</a>, <a href="GE_Jenbacher" title="wikilink">GE Jenbacher</a>, <a href="Caterpillar_Inc." title="wikilink">Caterpillar Inc.</a>, <a href="Perkins_Engines" title="wikilink">Perkins Engines</a>, <a href="MWM_(Motoren_Werke_Mannheim_AG)" title="wikilink">MWM</a>, <a class="uri" href="Cummins" title="wikilink">Cummins</a>, <a class="uri" href="Wärtsilä" title="wikilink">Wärtsilä</a>, <a href="Waukesha_Engine" title="wikilink">GE Energy Waukesha</a>, <a href="Dresser-Rand_Group" title="wikilink">Guascor Power</a>, <a href="Deutz_AG" title="wikilink">Deutz</a>, MTU, MAN, <a href="Fairbanks_Morse" title="wikilink">Fairbanks Morse</a>, Doosan, and <a class="uri" href="Yanmar" title="wikilink">Yanmar</a>. Output ranges from about  <a href="Cogeneration" title="wikilink">micro CHP [combined heat and power</a>] to .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Generally speaking, the modern high-speed gas engine is very competitive with gas turbines up to about  depending on circumstances, and the best ones are much more fuel efficient than the gas turbines. Rolls-Royce with the Bergen Engines, Caterpillar and many other manufacturers base their products on a diesel engine block and crankshaft. GE Jenbacher are the sole company whose engines are designed and dedicated to gas alone. Waukesha gas engines are also designed and dedicated to gas use only.</p>

<p>Typical applications are <a class="uri" href="baseload" title="wikilink">baseload</a> or high-hour generation schemes, including <a href="combined_heat_and_power" title="wikilink">combined heat and power</a> (for typical performance figures see,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="landfill" title="wikilink">landfill</a> gas, <a href="mining" title="wikilink">mines</a> gas, <a href="oil_well" title="wikilink">well</a>-head gas and <a class="uri" href="biogas" title="wikilink">biogas</a> (where the waste heat from the engine may be used to warm the digesters).

<h2 id="use-of-methane-or-propane-gases">Use of methane or propane gases</h2>

<p>Since <a href="natural_gas" title="wikilink">natural gas</a> (<a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a>) has long been a clean, economical, and readily available fuel, many industrial engines are either designed or modified to use gas, as distinguished from <a class="uri" href="gasoline" title="wikilink">gasoline</a>. Although the carbon emission footprint does not differ significantly, their operation produces less complex-hydrocarbon pollution, and the engines have fewer internal problems. One example is the <a href="liquefied_petroleum_gas" title="wikilink">liquefied petroleum gas</a> (<a class="uri" href="propane" title="wikilink">propane</a>) engine used in vast numbers of <a href="forklift_truck" title="wikilink">forklift trucks</a>. Common US usage of "gas" to mean "gasoline" requires the explicit identification of a natural gas engine. (There is also such a thing as "natural gasoline", but this term is very rarely observed outside the refining industry.)</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>

<p>A gas engine differs from a <a href="petrol_engine" title="wikilink">petrol engine</a> in the way the fuel and air are mixed. A petrol engine uses a <a class="uri" href="carburetor" title="wikilink">carburetor</a> or <a href="fuel_injection" title="wikilink">fuel injection</a> but a gas engine often uses a <a href="Venturi_effect" title="wikilink">venturi</a> system to introduce gas into the air flow. Early gas engines used a three-valve system, with separate inlet valves for air and gas.</p>

<p>The weak point of a gas engine compared to a <a href="diesel_engine" title="wikilink">diesel engine</a> is the exhaust valves, since the gas engine exhaust gases are much hotter for a given output, and this limits the power output. Thus a diesel engine from a given manufacturer will usually have a higher maximum output than the same engine block size in the gas engine version. The diesel engine will generally have three different ratings - Standby, Prime, and Continuous, (UK, 1 hour rating, 12 hour rating and continuous rating) whereas the gas engine will generally only have a Continuous rating, which will be less than the Diesel Continuous rating</p>
<h2 id="energy-balance">Energy balance</h2>
<h3 id="thermal-efficiency">Thermal efficiency</h3>

<p>Gas engines that run on natural gas typically have a thermal efficiency between 35-45% (LCV basis).,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The best engines can achieve a thermal efficiency of slightly more than 48% (LCV basis). These gas engines are usually medium speed engines <a href="http://www.rolls-royce.com/energy/energy_products/gas_engines/bergen_b-gas/index.jsp">Bergen Engines</a> Fuel energy arises at the output shaft, the remainder appears as waste heat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Large engines are more efficient than small engines. Gas engines running on <a class="uri" href="biogas" title="wikilink">biogas</a> typically have a slightly lower efficiency (~1-2%) and <a class="uri" href="syngas" title="wikilink">syngas</a> reduces the efficiency further still. GE Jenbacher's recent J624 engine is the world's first 24 cylinder gas engine with high efficiency running on methane.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>When considering engine efficiency one should consider whether this is based on the lower heating value (LCV) or higher heating value (HCV) of the gas. Engine manufacturers will typically quote efficiencies based on the lower heating value of the gas, i.e. the efficiency after energy has been taken to evaporate the intrinsic moisture within the gas itself. Gas distribution networks will typically charge based upon the higher heating value of the gas (i.e. total energy content). A quoted engine efficiency based on LCV might be say 44% whereas the same engine might have an HCV of 39.6% based on HCV on natural gas. It is also important to ensure that efficiency comparisons are on a like for like basis. for example some manufactures have mechanically driven pumps whereas other use electrically driven pumps to drive engine cooling water, and the electrical usage can sometimes be ignored giving a falsely high apparent efficiency compared to the direct drive engines.</p>
<h3 id="combined-heat-and-power">Combined heat and power</h3>

<p>Engine reject heat can be used for building heating or heating a process. In an engine, roughly half the waste heat arises (from the engine jacket, oil cooler and after-cooler circuits) as hot water which can be at up to 110 °C. The remainder arises as high-temperature heat which can generate pressurised hot water or steam by the use of an exhaust gas <a href="heat_exchanger" title="wikilink">heat exchanger</a>.</p>
<h3 id="engine-cooling">Engine cooling</h3>

<p>Two most common engine types are an <a href="air-cooled_engine" title="wikilink">air-cooled engine</a> or <a href="Water-cooled#Automotive_usage" title="wikilink">water cooled</a> engine. Water cooled nowadays use <a class="uri" href="antifreeze" title="wikilink">antifreeze</a> in the <a href="internal_combustion_engine" title="wikilink">internal combustion engine</a></p>

<p>Some engines (air or water) have an added <a href="Oil_cooling" title="wikilink">oil cooler.</a></p>

<p>Cooling is required to remove excessive heat, over heating can cause engine failure, usually from wear, cracking or warping.</p>
