   (-)-beta-pinene synthase      (-)-beta-pinene synthase   (-)-beta-pinene synthase (, beta-geraniolene synthase , (-)-(1S,5S)-pinene synthase , geranyldiphosphate diphosphate lyase (pinene forming) ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (-)-beta-pinene-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (-)- beta-pinene + diphosphate    Cyclase II of Salvia officinalis (sage) produces about equal parts (-)- alpha-pinene , (-)-beta-pinene and (-)- camphene .
