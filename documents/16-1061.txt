Continuous Proportion
According to Euclid, a proportion is the equality of two ratios12 (magnitude A is to magnitude B as magnitude C is to magnitude D). A proportion is said to be continuous if there is an equivalent relationship between each succeeding magnitude or term (i.e. A is to B as B is to C). A minimum of three terms is required to define a Continuous Proportion.3 Hence, all continuous proportions are predicated upon the continued maintenance of a fixed relationship between three consecutive terms.4 It is therefore convenient to delineate such succeeding magnitudes with subscripts: m1, m2, m3, ... generalized as mn-1, mn, mn+1, ... (past, present, and future magnitudes).5 Proportions differ from a simple ratio in that, as Matila Ghyka states, they express the permanency of a characteristic ratio... , which is transmitted from one ratio to another; it is this analogical invariant [that] brings an ordering principle.6

Plato's Timaeus (dialogue) … it’s not possible for two things alone to be beautifully combined apart from some third: some bond must get in the middle and bring them both together. And the most beautiful of these bonds is that which, as much as possible, makes itself and the things bound together one, and proportion is suited by nature to accomplish this most beautifully. For whenever, of three numbers, the middle term of any two of them, whether cubic or square, is such that as the first is to it so is it to the last – and again, conversely, as the last is to the middle so is the middle to the first – then the middle term becomes first and last, while the last and first in turn both become middle terms, so that of necessity it will turn out that all the terms will be the same; and once they’ve come to be the same in relation to each other, all will be one.7

Continuous Equal Proportion
A proportion is said to be continuously equal when all terms have the same magnitude: m1=m2=m3= ... generalized as mn-1=mn=mn+1= ... The Continuous Equal Proportion is used to describe spherical symmetry, since all the radii of a given sphere or circle are equal.

According to Archytas ...everything moves in proportion; and this proportion of equality is the only one which, when it occurs, produces circles and spheres, because it returns on itself.8

Continuous Arithmetic Proportion
To begin consider a series of proportioned magnitudes, as many as one pleases, arranged from smallest to largest: m1, m2, m3, ..., mn-1, mn, mn+1. At present let the difference between the two larger of three terms be the numerator and the difference between the two smaller of three terms be the denominator of the Characteristic Ratio, R :
    $R=\frac{m_3-m_2}{m_2-m_1}\qquad \text{generalized...}\qquad R=\frac{m_{n+1}-m_n}{m_n-m_{n-1}}$
When the difference between sequential terms is equal, the Characteristic Ratio equals one (R=1) and the series of numbers is said to have Continuous Arithmetic Proportion, which may alternately be expressed as an equality:910 $m_3=2m_2-m_1 \qquad \text{generalized...}\qquad m_{n+1}=2m_n-m_{n-1} \qquad \text{Example: }1, 2, 3, ...,  m_{n-1}, m_n, m_{n+1}$
Continuous Geometrical Proportion
For continuous geometrical proportion the Characteristic Ratio is equal to the ratio of any two consecutive terms. In keeping with the established convention, the ratio is defined as the difference between the largest and middle term divided by the difference between the middle and smallest term, which is equal to the ratio of the larger over smaller consecutive magnitudes:1112 $R=\frac{m_3-m_2}{m_2-m_1}=\frac{m_2}{m_1}=\frac{m_3}{m_2}\qquad \text{generalized...}\qquad R=\frac{m_{n+1}-m_n}{m_n-m_{n-1}}=\frac{m_n}{m_{n-1}}=\frac{m_{n+1}}{m_n}$
Alternately expressed as an equality:
    $\frac{m_n}{m_{n-1}}=\frac{m_{n+1}}{m_n}\qquad \text{or}\qquad m_n^2=m_{n+1}m_{n-1}$
Continuous geometrical proportion, commonly referred to as exponential growth, begins at base-2 with the continuous doubling of the number one:
    $\frac{2}{1}=\frac{4}{2}=\frac{8}{4}=\frac{16}{8}=\frac{32}{16}=\frac{64}{32}=...\qquad \text{or}\qquad \frac{2^1}{2^0}=\frac{2^2}{2^1}=\frac{2^3}{2^2}=\frac{2^4}{2^3}=\frac{2^5}{2^4}=\frac{2^6}{2^5}=\frac{2^{n+1}}{2^n}$
Continuous Golden Proportion
Golden proportion is the special case of geometrical proportion where, of the three terms required to define a proportion, the third term is the sum of the preceding two terms. Therefore the Characteristic Ratio of the continuous golden proportion is derived from the continuous geometrical proportion by substituting the sum of the first and second terms for the third as follows:1314 $\text{Let }\quad m_{n+1}=m_n+m_{n-1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m_n}{m_{n-1}}=\frac{m_n+m_{n-1}}{m_n} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left (\frac{m_n}{m_{n-1}}\right )^2=\frac{m_n}{m_{n-1}}+1$
As in the case of continuous geometrical proportion, the Characteristic Ratio is equal to the ratio of sequential terms. Substituting R for the ratio in quadratic equation above gives:
    $\text{Let }\quad R=\frac{m_n}{m_{n-1}}  \quad \Rightarrow \quad  R^2=R+1$  
R is found using the Quadratic Formula, which yields both positive and negative golden roots. Therefore there are two Characteristic Ratios that describe this form of proportion: the Golden Ratio (φ+) and its negative reciprocal (φ-):
    $\therefore R=\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \varphi_+=\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \varphi_-=\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$
Together these two golden roots serve as base and anti-base of this special golden form of continuous geometrical proportion. The Fibonacci number (Fn) series and Lucas number (Ln) series are the two most noteworthy examples of Continuous Golden Proportion. The Fibonacci Continuous Golden Proportion is described by a difference relationship between base and anti-base, and each magnitude is equal to the difference between the future and past magnitudes:15 $\text {Let } m_n=F_n \quad \Rightarrow  \quad  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...,F_{n-1}, F_n, F_{n-1}+F_n$ $$ $$ $F_n = \frac{\varphi_+^n - \varphi_-^n}{\varphi_+ - \varphi_-}=\frac{\varphi_+^n - \varphi_-^n}{\sqrt{5}}  \quad \text{and} \quad F_n = F_{n+1}-F_{n-1}$ And the Lucas Continuous Golden Proportion is described by an additive relationship between the golden base and anti-base, and each magnitude is equal to the sum of the future and past magnitudes of the Fibonacci Continuous Golden Proportion:
    $\text {Let } m_n=L_n \quad \Rightarrow \quad  2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...,L_{n-1}, L_n, L_{n-1}+L_n$
$$ $$ $L_n = \frac{\varphi_+^n + \varphi_-^n}{\varphi_+ + \varphi_-} =\frac{\varphi_+^n + \varphi_-^n}{1}   \quad \text{and} \quad L_n = F_{n+1}+F_{n-1}$

Continuous Dimensional Proportion
While expounding the Greek understanding of proportion Ghyka states: The notions of periodicity and proportion, and their interplay, can be used for succession in time as well as for spatial associations.16 Leveraging Pythagorean concepts of number and proportion, Williams casts the unified continuous proportion(s) of Pascal's Triangle in a spatial/temporal dimensional context by equating the mirror symmetry of its columns and rows with a spatial/temporal negative reciprocal dimensional relationship. As shown in the adjacent figures, Pascals triangle is presented with rows temporally incremented and columns spatially incremented such that each column represents a continuous spatial proportion and each row represents a continuous temporal proportion. The relative orientation of spatial and temporal proportions expresses both direction (sign) and inversion (reciprocal) relationships geometrically without the necessity of the conventional negative sign or reciprocal functions. 17

Philolaus wrote: The universe is one, and it began to come into being from the centre, and from the centre upwards at the same intervals (of distance) as those below. For the parts above from the centre are in inverse relationship to those below; for the centre is to what is below as it is to what is above, and so with all the rest; for both stand in the same relationship to the centre, except in so far as their positions are reversed.18

Continuous Translational Proportion
 The continuous translational proportion of Pascal's triangle are commonly referred to as figurate or polygonal number. Each succeeding dimensional proportion is the orthogonal sum of the preceding creating geometric growth of a symmetric array of points. The continuous proportion of succeeding columns or rows have a right angle relationship to one another (dimensional invariance), as shown in the adjacent figure. Incremental growth is coordinated about the central point so as to cause the close-packing of equal spheres symmetry of the continuous tetrahedral proportion. The continuous proportion of a given column or row is defined as either a spatial or temporal translational proportion since incremental growth of said proportion proceeds as if through translation along these invariant lines or axes of dimensional constraint (dimensional frames of reference), the simplest example of which is the continuous arithmetic (linear) proportion (incremental sums of the singular point). A given spatially oriented continuous translational proportion is defined by temporal increments and a given temporally oriented continuous translational proportion is defined by spatial increments. The Continuous Translational Proportion Equality is the general case of the Continuous Arithmetic Proportion Equality where either the $^{\ s-2}m_{t+1} \text{  }$ or $\text{  } ^{\ t-2}m_{s+1}$ terms are continuously equal to zero or void.19
Spatial Translational Proportion
    $^sm_{\Delta t}\ \Rightarrow \ ^sm_{t-1},\ ^sm_t,\ ^sm_{t+1},\ ...$
$$ $\text {where, }\ ^sm_{t+1}=\  ^sm_t+\ ^{s-1}m_{t+1}=2\ ^sm_t-\ ^sm_{t-1} + ^{\ s-2}m_{t+1}$ $$ $$ $\text {Example:  Let the} ~orientation\ \text{be } \  s=4 \ \text { and the} ~interval \  \text{be }  \  t=2$ $$ $\Rightarrow \ ^4m_3=\  ^4m_2+\ ^3m_3= 2 \times \ ^4m_2-\ ^4m_1+\ ^2m_3$ $$ $\therefore \ \ ^4m_3=\  4+6= 2 \times 4-1+3=10$
Temporal Translational Proportion
    $^tm_{\Delta s}\ \Rightarrow \ ^tm_{s-1},\ ^tm_s,\ ^tm_{s+1},\ ...$
$$ $\text {where, }\ ^tm_{s+1}=\  ^tm_s+\ ^{t-1}m_{s+1}=2\ ^tm_s-\ ^tm_{s-1} + ^{\ t-2}m_{s+1}$ $$ $$ $\text {Example:  Let the} ~orientation\ \text{be } \  t=3 \ \text { and the} ~interval \  \text{be }  \  s=1$ $$ $\Rightarrow \ ^3m_2=\  ^3m_1+\ ^2m_2= 2 \times \ ^3m_1-\ ^3m_0+\ ^1m_2$ $$ $\therefore \ \ ^3m_2=\  1+2= 2 \times 1-0+1=3$

Dimensional Invariance

And the Pythagoreans say that there is void, ... and this void defines the nature of things, inasmuch as it is a certain separation and definition of things that lie together; and this is true first in the case of numbers, for the void defines the nature of these. Aristotle20

At the dimensional origin of Pascal's triangle lies the point, whose symmetry is expressed by the number one, and the void, whose symmetry is expressed by the number zero. As the point is incrementally summed with void the orthogonal continuous translational proportions of Pascal's triangle are differentiated. The orthogonal relationship between successive proportions originates from the right-angle relationship between the formative symmetry elements of point and void. Each incremental sum of point and void is accompanied by the incorporation of Dimensional Invariance within these successive translational proportions. This dimensional invariance can be observed in two ways: by the relative geometric orientation of each proportion, and with modulus nine wherewith the integration of neutral invariance is observed.21
In modulus nine the number 0 and the number 9 are analog equivalents. Hence when point and void are summed it causes analog numeric invariance within the resulting continuous proportions that is accompanied by an incrementally increasing number of neutral void-like nines within the modulus nine complementary analog symmetry of each successive translational proportion. Both point and void have continuous equal proportion implying that they both have spherical symmetry. Yet since point and void are orthogonal to one another and the point is finite whereas the void infinite, Williams suggests the the point and void are in relation to one another as a radius is to a tangent. He goes further to suggest the finite-point (1) and the infinite-void (0) are the limited-odd (Peras) and the unlimited-even (Apeiron) formative symmetry elements expressed in Pythagorean and other near-Eastern pre-Christian number theory based cosmologies.22
The physical connection between modulus nine symmetry and continuous proportion geometry is most readily observed by examination of the 1-like, 3-like, and 6-like planes of the continuous triangular proportion (Triangular Number) that form the cuboctahedral spherical close-pack symmetry of the continuous tetrahedral proportion. Beginning with 1, and every third plane thereafter, the concentric triangles about the central point are formed by the 1+9+18+27+...(9n) additive series of points, hence in modulus nine all 1-like planes reduce to 1 by casting out nines. For instance the next 1-like plane after 1 is 10 or 1 surrounded by 1 times 9 points (the Tetraktys), Beginning with 3, and every third plane thereafter, concentric triangles about the central 3 are formed by the 3+12+21+30+...(3+9n) additive series of points, hence in modulus nine 3-like planes alternate 3-6-9. Beginning with 6, and every third plane thereafter, concentric triangles about the central 6 are formed by the 6+15+24+33+...(6+9n) additive series of points, hence in modulus nine 6-like planes alternate 6-3-9. As is shown in the adjacent figure, the central point of the cuboctahedron is coordinated between 3-like and 6-like complementary planes.
Modulus nine complementary symmetry
 Often referred to as the digital root, modulus nine (mod 9) is composed of three residue classes of modulus three: 1-4-7, 2-5-8, and 3-6-9.23 By analogy to complementary color symmetry (see Itten) the 1-4-7 class may be designated the primary phase (yellow, blue, red), the 2-5-8 class the secondary phase (green, orange, violet), and the 3-6-9 class the tertiary phase (white, black, grey).24 The evident cubic symmetry of primary and secondary colors is then equated with the cubic number symmetry of the continuous base-2 geometrical proportion to reveal a continuous complementary cubic symmetry transformation where complements 1-8 (yellow-violet), 2-7 (green-red), and 4-5 (blue-orange) are on opposite faces of a cubic symmetry rotating about the diagonal between the vertex shared by the primary phase and the vertex shared by the secondary phase. As shown in the figure on the right, the primary 1-4-7 vertex sums to 12 which is 3 (white) in modulus nine and the secondary 2-5-8 vertex sums to 15 which is 6 (black) in modulus nine. Both in this instance and in the case of the 3-like and 6-like triangular planes of the continuous triangular proportion 3 and 6 form opposing complementary octahedral faces of the complementary cuboctahedron. The other six complementary octahedral faces are found in the same manner by summing the cube faces that intersect at the other vertices of the cube, as shown in the adjacent figure. All complementarily opposing faces sum to 9 (neutral grey).

Continuous Rotational Proportion
Recall that the term translational refers to the proportional growth of points axially along orthogonal lines of dimensional invariance. In contrast, continuous rotational proportion describe the proportional growth of points by rotation between orthogonal lines of dimensional invariance. Rotational proportions are also distinguished from translational by the type of modulus nine complementary symmetry transformations that accompany them.
Complementary Cubic Proportion
In the animation below incremental temporal invariance first aligns spatial intervals (1:1 diagonals) in columns. The sums of these finite spatial intervals are in continuous base-2 geometrical proportion. which in modulus nine is a 6-fold complementary dipole symmetry transformation (,,,,,, ...) that is consistent with the 6-fold analog rotation of dimensional invariance. This complementary cubic rotational symmetry has complements on opposing cube faces accompanied by antiparallel invariance. Complementary rotational inversion begins in 3-fold succession with antiparallel inversion between spatially polarized cube faces of  and , followed by  to  then  to .25
For spatial rotational intervals let n = Σ:
   $\therefore \quad R=\frac{m_\Sigma}{m_{\Sigma-1}}=\frac{m_{\Sigma+1}}{m_\Sigma} \qquad \text{or}\qquad \frac{2^1}{2^0}=\frac{2^2}{2^1}=\frac{2^3}{2^2}=\frac{2^4}{2^3}=\frac{2^5}{2^4}=\frac{2^6}{2^5}=\frac{2^\Sigma}{2^{\Sigma-1}}=\frac{2^{\Sigma+1}}{2^\Sigma} \quad \circlearrowright$
The opposing invariance of equivalent spatial and temporal 6-fold cubic rotational intervals creates two chiral symmetry transformations: the spatially polarized clockwise transformation shown in the animation below, and a temporally polarized counterclockwise transformation when incremental invariance is imposed in a temporal/spatial orientation (putting temporal intervals in rows instead).
For temporal rotational intervals let n = Τ:
   $\therefore \quad R=\frac{m_\Tau}{m_{\Tau-1}}=\frac{m_{\Tau+1}}{m_\Tau} \qquad \text{or}\qquad \frac{2^1}{2^0}=\frac{2^2}{2^1}=\frac{2^3}{2^2}=\frac{2^4}{2^3}=\frac{2^5}{2^4}=\frac{2^6}{2^5}=\frac{2^\Tau}{2^{\Tau-1}}=\frac{2^{\Tau+1}}{2^\Tau} \quad \circlearrowleft$
Complementary Cuboctahedral Proportion
Fibonacci Proportion
As shown in the animation below, incremental spatial invariance next aligns spatial/temporal intervals (2:1 diagonals) in rows. The sums of these finite spatial/temporal intervals are in continuous golden proportion (Fibonacci series), which in modulus nine is a 24-fold complementary dipole symmetry transformation between the parallel spatial-cubic  and temporal-cubic  poles that is consistent with the 12-fold analog rotation of spatial/temporal dimensional invariance. This complementary cuboctahedral proportion inverts between cubic, octahedral, spatial, and temporal frames of reference through rotation about the parallel 1-8 (spatial-temporal) complementary cubic dipole axis. Equivalent 12-fold invariance analogs within the greater 24-fold modulus nine analog are accompanied by polarization inversion between spatial- and temporal- cubic poles of the spatially and temporally polarized chiral complementary cuboctahedral rotational symmetries.26
For spatial/temporal rotational intervals:
    $\text{Let interval } n=\tfrac{\Sigma}{\Tau} \ \text{ and Fibonacci number } F_n=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau} \qquad \therefore \ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}=\frac{\varphi_+^\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}  - \varphi_-^\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}}{\varphi_+ - \varphi_-} =\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}+1} - \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}-1}$
$$ $$ $\Rightarrow  \quad  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...,\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}-1}, \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}, \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}+1}, \  \text{ where} \ \ \ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}+1} =\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}-1}+\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_\frac{\Sigma}{\Tau}$
(Figure)
 Complementary cubic and cuboctaheral continuous proportion are revealed with invariant modulus 9 complementary number symmetry.

Complementary cubic and cuboctaheral continuous rotational proportion ordered by incremental temporal and spatial dimensional invariance are revealed with invariant modulus nine complementary number symmetry.
Were incremental invariance to be imposed in a temporal/spatial orientation, temporal/spatial intervals would be in columns and analog dipole inversion would occur through antithetical rotation about the parallel temporal- spatial- complementary cubic poles instead.
For temporal/spatial rotational intervals:
   $\text{Let interval } n=\tfrac{\Tau}{\Sigma} \ \text{ and Fibonacci number } F_n=\overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma} \qquad \therefore \ \overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}= \frac{\varphi_+^\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}  - \varphi_-^\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}}{\varphi_+ - \varphi_-}=\overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_{\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}+1} - \overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_{\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}-1}$
$$ $$ $\Rightarrow  \quad  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...,\overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_{\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}-1}, \overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}, \overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_{\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}+1}, \  \text{ where} \ \ \ \overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_{\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}+1} =\overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_{\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}-1}+ \overset{\leftharpoondown}{E}_\frac{\Tau}{\Sigma}$
(Figure)
Side by side comparison of Fibonacci and Lucas continuous complementary cuboctahedral dipole fields showing coordination between inversion centers.

Lucas Proportion
The sums of past and future terms of the Fibonacci series form the Lucas series, which is a 2-7 complementary cuboctahedral dipole field that may be characterized in the same manner as the 1-8 dipole field except it begins with the central octahedral polarity-2 inversion center that is aligned with the neutral center of the 1-8 dipole field. This different frame of reference is still characterized by rotation about cubic poles, however in this case it is the  and  cubic poles.27
To simplify notation let interval $\tfrac{\Sigma}{\Tau}$ be denoted I, and let Lucas number Ln = FI:
    $\therefore \ \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_\text{I}= \frac{\varphi_+^\text{I}  + \varphi_-^\text{I}}{\varphi_+ + \varphi_-}= \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\text{I}-1} + \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{\text{I}+1}$
$$ $$ $\Rightarrow \quad  2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...,\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{\text{I}-1}, \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_\text{I}, \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{\text{I}+1}, \ \text{where} \ \ \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{\text{I}+1} =\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{\text{I}-1}+\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_\text{I}$
The 4-fold transformations within the Lucas series (shown in the adjacent figure by transformation arrows) are consistent with the following relationships that bind even and odd intervals together.28
For all even intervals:
    $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{2\text{I}}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_\text{I}^2-2$
Even intervals are in harmony with a 4-fold power structure that accompanies the continuous complementary inversion transformation between the complements  and .
    $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_0=2 \ \Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_0=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_0^2-2=2^2-2=2$
$$ $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_2=3 \ \Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_4=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_2^2-2=3^2-2=7$ $$ $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_4=7 \ \Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_8=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_4^2-2=7^2-2=47$ $$ $$ $\Rightarrow \quad  \underline{\bold{2}},\  1,\  3,\  4,\  \underline{\bold{7}},\  11,\  18,\  29,\  \underline{\bold{47}},\  76,\  123,\  199,\  \underline{\bold{322}},\  521,\  843,\  ...$
For all odd intervals:
    $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{2\text{I}}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_\text{I}^2+2$
Odd intervals are in harmony with a 4-fold power structure that accompanies the continuous complementary inversion transformation between tertiary phase polarities.
    $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_1=1 \ \ \Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_2 \ =\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_1^2+2=1^2+2 \ =3$
$$ $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_3=4 \ \ \Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_6 \ =\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_3^2+2=4^2+2 \ =18$ $$ $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_5=11 \ \Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_{10}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_5^2+2=11^2+2=123$ $$ $$ $\Rightarrow \quad  2,\  1,\  \underline{\bold{3}},\  4,\  7,\  11,\  \underline{\bold{18}},\  29,\  47,\  76,\  \underline{\bold{123}},\  199,\  322,\  521,\  \underline{\bold{843}},\  ...$
For ALL intervals:
    $\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{2\text{I}}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_\text{I}\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_\text{I}$
Present intervals of the Fibonacci and Lucas proportion harmonize continuously so as to always predict the 2x future Fibonacci interval and thereby link all even intervals in a continuous a priori chain.
    $\underline{\bold{0}},\  1,\  \underline{\bold{1}},\  2,\  \underline{\bold{3}},\ \  5,\ \  \underline{\bold{8}},\  13,\  \underline{\bold{21}},\  34,\ \ \underline{\bold{55}},\ 89,\ \underline{\bold{144}},\  233,\ \underline{\bold{377}},\  ...$
$$ $2,\  1,\  3,\  4,\  7,\  11,\  18,\  29,\  47,\  76,\  123,\  199,\  322,\  521,\  843,\  ...$ $$ $$ $\Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{2\times0}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_0=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_0\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_0=0\times2=0$ $$ $\Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{2\times1}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_2=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_1\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_1=1\times1=1$ $$ $\Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{2\times2}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_4=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_2\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_2=1\times3=3$ $$ $\Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{2\times3}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_6=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_3\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_3=2\times4=8$ $$ $\Rightarrow \  \overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_{2\times4}=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_8=\overset{\rightharpoonup}{E}_4\overset{\rightharpoonup}{F}_4=3\times7=21$ $$
