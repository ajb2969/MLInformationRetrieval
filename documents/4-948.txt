   Poisson superalgebra      Poisson superalgebra   In mathematics , a Poisson superalgebra is a Z 2 - graded generalization of a Poisson algebra . Specifically, a Poisson superalgebra is an (associative) superalgebra  A with a Lie superbracket       [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   :    A  ⊗  A   →  A      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→   tensor-product  A  A   A     [\cdot,\cdot]:A\otimes A\to A   such that ( A , [·,·]) is a Lie superalgebra and the operator       [  x  ,  ⋅  ]   :   A  →  A      normal-:   x  normal-⋅    normal-→  A  A     [x,\cdot]:A\to A   is a superderivation of A :        [  x  ,   y  z   ]   =     [  x  ,  y  ]   z   +     (   -  1   )     |  x  |    |  y  |     y   [  x  ,  z  ]      .       x    y  z         x  y   z      superscript    1       x     y     y   x  z       [x,yz]=[x,y]z+(-1)^{|x||y|}y[x,z].\,     A supercommutative Poisson algebra is one for which the (associative) product is supercommutative .  This is one possible way of "super"izing the Poisson algebra. This gives the classical dynamics of fermion fields and classical spin-1/2 particles. The other is to define an antibracket algebra instead. This is used in the BRST and Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.  Examples   If A is any associative Z 2 graded algebra, then, defining a new product [.,.] (which is called the super-commutator) by [x,y]:=xy-(-1) |x||y| yx for any pure graded x, y turns A into a Poisson superalgebra.
