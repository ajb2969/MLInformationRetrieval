   Blasius boundary layer      Blasius boundary layer   In physics and fluid mechanics , a Blasius boundary layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius ) describes the steady two-dimensional laminar boundary layer that forms on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow   U   U   U   .  (Figure)  A schematic diagram of the Blasius flow profile. The streamwise velocity component      u   (  η  )    /  U    (  x  )           u  η   U   x    u(\eta)/U(x)   is shown, as a function of the stretched co-ordinate   η   η   \eta   .   The solution to the Navier–Stokes equation for this flow begins with an order-of-magnitude analysis to determine what terms are important. Within the boundary layer the usual balance between viscosity and convective inertia is struck, resulting in the scaling argument        U  2   L   ≈   ν   U   δ  2            superscript  U  2   L     ν    U   superscript  δ  2       \frac{U^{2}}{L}\approx\nu\frac{U}{\delta^{2}}   ,  where   δ   δ   \delta   is the boundary-layer thickness and   ν   ν   \nu   is the kinematic viscosity .  However the semi-infinite plate has no natural length scale   L   L   L   and so the steady, incompressible, two-dimensional boundary-layer equations for continuity and momentum are  Continuity       ∂  u    ∂  x    +    ∂  v    ∂  y     =  0            u     x        v     y     0    \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0     x-Momentum      u    ∂  u    ∂  x     +   v    ∂  u    ∂  y      =   ν     ∂  2   u    ∂   y  2              u      u     x       v      u     y        ν      superscript   2   u      superscript  y  2        u\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y}={\nu}\dfrac{%
 \partial^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}     (note that the x-independence of   U   U   U   has been accounted for in the boundary-layer equations) admit a similarity solution. In the system of partial differential equations written above it is assumed that a fixed solid body wall is parallel to the x-direction whereas the y-direction is normal with respect to the fixed wall, as shown in the above schematic.   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   denote here the x- and y-components of the fluid velocity vector. Furthermore, from the scaling argument it is apparent that the boundary layer grows with the downstream coordinate   x   x   x   , e.g.        δ   (  x  )    ≈    (    ν  x   U   )    1  /  2     .        δ  x    superscript      ν  x   U     1  2      \delta(x)\approx\left(\frac{\nu x}{U}\right)^{1/2}.     This suggests adopting the similarity variable      η  =   y   δ   (  x  )     =   y    (   U   ν  x    )    1  /  2           η    y    δ  x           y   superscript    U    ν  x      1  2        \eta=\frac{y}{\delta(x)}=y\left(\frac{U}{\nu x}\right)^{1/2}   and writing       u  =   U   f  ′    (  η  )     .      u    U   superscript  f  normal-′   η     u=Uf^{\prime}(\eta).     It proves convenient to work with the stream function    ψ   ψ   \psi   , in which case      ψ  =     (   ν  U  x   )    1  /  2    f   (  η  )        ψ     superscript    ν  U  x     1  2    f  η     \psi=(\nu Ux)^{1/2}f(\eta)     and on differentiating, to find the velocities, and substituting into the boundary-layer equation we obtain the Blasius equation        f  ′′′   +    1  2   f   f  ′′     =  0         superscript  f  ′′′       1  2   f   superscript  f  ′′     0    f^{\prime\prime\prime}+\frac{1}{2}ff^{\prime\prime}=0     subject to    f  =   f  ′   =  0        f   superscript  f  normal-′        0     f=f^{\prime}=0   on    η  =  0      η  0    \eta=0   and     f  ′   →  1     normal-→   superscript  f  normal-′   1    f^{\prime}\rightarrow 1   as    η  →  ∞     normal-→  η     \eta\rightarrow\infty   . This non-linear ODE can be solved numerically, with the shooting method proving an effective choice. The shear stress on the plate        τ   x  y    =     f  ′′    (  0  )   ρ   U  2    ν      U  x      .       subscript  τ    x  y         superscript  f  ′′   0  ρ   superscript  U  2     ν        U  x       \tau_{xy}=\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(0)\rho U^{2}\sqrt{\nu}}{\sqrt{Ux}}.     can then be computed. The numerical solution gives      f  ′′    (  0  )    ≈  0.332         superscript  f  ′′   0   0.332    f^{\prime\prime}(0)\approx 0.332   .  Falkner–Skan boundary layer  We can generalize the Blasius boundary layer by considering a wedge at an angle of attack   β   β   {\beta}   from some uniform velocity field    U  0     subscript  U  0    U_{0}   . We then estimate the outer flow to be of the form:        u  e    (  x  )    =    U  0     (   x  /  L   )   m           subscript  u  e   x      subscript  U  0    superscript    x  L   m      u_{e}(x)=U_{0}\left(x/L\right)^{m}     Where   L   L   L   is a characteristic length and m is a dimensionless constant. In the Blasius solution, m = 0 corresponding to an angle of attack of zero radians. Thus we can write:      β  =    2  m    m  +  1        β      2  m     m  1      {\beta}=\frac{2m}{m+1}     As in the Blasius solution, we use a similarity variable   η   η   {\eta}   to solve the Navier-Stokes Equations.      η  =   y      U  0    (   m  +  1   )     2  ν  L       (   x  L   )     m  -  1   2         η    y         subscript  U  0     m  1      2  ν  L      superscript    x  L       m  1   2       {\eta}=y\sqrt{\frac{U_{0}(m+1)}{2{\nu}L}}\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)^{\frac{m-1}{%
 2}}     It becomes easier to describe this in terms of its stream function which we write as      ψ  =   U   (  x  )   δ   (  x  )   f   (  η  )    =   y     2  ν   U  0   L    m  +  1       (   x  L   )     m  +  1   2    f   (  η  )          ψ    U  x  δ  x  f  η          y        2  ν   subscript  U  0   L     m  1      superscript    x  L       m  1   2    f  η      \psi=U(x)\delta(x)f(\eta)=y\sqrt{\frac{2{\nu}U_{0}L}{m+1}}\left(\frac{x}{L}%
 \right)^{\frac{m+1}{2}}f(\eta)     Thus the initial differential equation which was written as follows:         u    ∂  u    ∂  x     +   v    ∂  u    ∂  y      =     c  2   m   x    2  m   -  1     +   ν     ∂  2   u    ∂   y  2        .          u      u     x       v      u     y           superscript  c  2   m   superscript  x      2  m   1       ν      superscript   2   u      superscript  y  2         u{\partial u\over\partial x}+v{\partial u\over\partial y}=c^{2}mx^{2m-1}+{\nu}%
 {\partial^{2}u\over\partial y^{2}}.     Can now be expressed in terms of the non-linear ODE known as the Falkner–Skan equation (named after V. M. Falkner and Sylvia W. Skan 1 ).          ∂  3   f    ∂   η  3     +   f     ∂  2   f    ∂   η  2      +   β   [   1  -    (    d  f    d  η    )   2    ]     =  0            superscript   3   f      superscript  η  3       f      superscript   2   f      superscript  η  2        β   delimited-[]    1   superscript      normal-d  f     normal-d  η    2       0    \frac{\partial^{3}f}{\partial\eta^{3}}+f\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial\eta^{2}}%
 +\beta\left[1-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}\eta}\right)^{2}\right]=0     (note that    m  =  0      m  0    m=0   produces the Blasius equation). See Wilcox 2007.  In 1937 Douglas Hartree revealed that physical solutions exist only in the range     -  0.0905   ≤  m  ≤  2          0.0905   m       2     -0.0905\leq m\leq 2   . Here, m  0 represents a favorable pressure gradient.  References    (English translation)       (see homotopy analysis method )     (see homotopy analysis method )    Wilcox, David C.
