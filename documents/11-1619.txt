   Tau-protein kinase      Tau-protein kinase   In enzymology , a tau-protein kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + tau protein    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + O-phospho- tau-protein    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and tau protein , whereas its two products are ADP and O-phospho-tau-protein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ). This enzyme participates in 14 metabolic pathways : erbb signaling pathway , cell cycle , wnt signaling pathway , hedgehog signaling pathway , axon guidance , focal adhesion , b cell receptor signaling pathway , insulin signaling pathway , melanogenesis , alzheimer's disease , colorectal cancer , endometrial cancer , prostate cancer , and basal cell carcinoma .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[tau-protein] O-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ATP:tau-protein O-hosphotransferase , brain protein kinase PK40erk , cdk5/p20 , CDK5/p23 , glycogen synthase kinase-3beta , GSK , protein tau kinase , STK31 , tau kinase , [tau-protein] kinase , tau-protein kinase I , tau-protein kinase II , tau-tubulin kinase , TPK , TPK I , TPK II , and TTK .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .  Examples  Human genes encoding proteins with Tau-protein kinase activity include:   BRSK1  BRSK2  GSK3A  GSK3B   References        "  Category:EC 2.7.11  Category:Enzymes of known structure
