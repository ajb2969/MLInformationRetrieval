Squalene methyltransferase

Squalene methyltransferase (, TMT-1, TMT-2) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:squalene C-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + squalene

 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,22-dimethyl-1,2,23,24-tetradehydro-2,3,22,23-tetrahydrosqualene (overall reaction)
 
(1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + squalene 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrosqualene
 
(1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3-methyl-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrosqualene 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3,22-dimethyl-1,2,23,24-tetradehydro-2,3,22,23-tetrahydrosqualene
 

There are two isoforms in the green alga Botryococcus braunii BOT22 that differ in their specificity .
