 The <strong>oceanic whitetip shark</strong>, <em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>, is a large <a href="pelagic_zone" title="wikilink">pelagic</a> <a class="uri" href="shark" title="wikilink">shark</a> of tropical and warm temperate seas. It is a stocky shark, most notable for its long, white tipped rounded fins.</p>

<p>This aggressive but slow-moving fish dominates feeding frenzies, and has attacked more humans than all other shark species combined — it is a notable danger to survivors of oceanic ship wrecks and downed aircraft. Recent studies have shown that its numbers are in steep decline — its large fins are highly valued as the chief ingredient of <a href="shark-fin_soup" title="wikilink">shark-fin soup</a> and, as with other shark species, the oceanic whitetip faces mounting pressure from <a href="fishery" title="wikilink">fishing</a> throughout its range.</p>

<p>The oceanic whitetip shark was first described by naturalist <a href="Rene_Primevere_Lesson" title="wikilink">Rene Primevere Lesson</a> in his account of observations made during <a href="Louis_Isidore_Duperrey" title="wikilink">Louis Duperrey</a>'s 1822–1825 circumnavigation of the world on the corvette <em><a class="uri" href="Coquille" title="wikilink">Coquille</a></em>. Lesson described two specimens found in the <a href="Tuamotu_Archipelago" title="wikilink">Tuamotu Archipelago</a> in <a href="French_Polynesia" title="wikilink">French Polynesia</a>, and <a href="binomial_nomenclature" title="wikilink">named</a> the shark <em>Squalus maou</em> after a Polynesian word for "shark". However, Lesson's description and name were forgotten.</p>
