Van der Corput lemma (harmonic analysis)

In mathematics, in the field of harmonic analysis, the van der Corput lemma is an estimate for oscillatory integrals named after the Dutch mathematician J. G. van der Corput.
The following result is stated by E. Stein:1
Suppose that a real-valued function 
 
 
 
  is smooth in an open interval 
 
 
 
 , and that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Assume that either 
 
 
 
 , or that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is monotone for 
 
 
 
 . There is a constant 
 
 
 
 , which does not depend on 
 
 
 
 , such that



for any 
 
 
 
 .
Sublevel set estimates
The van der Corput lemma is closely related to the sublevel set estimates (see for example 2), which give the upper bound on the measure of the set where a function takes values not larger than 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose that a real-valued function 
 
 
 
  is smooth on a finite or infinite interval 
 
 
 
 , and that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . There is a constant 
 
 
 
 , which does not depend on 
 
 
 
 , such that for any 
 
 
 
  the measure of the sublevel set 
 
 
 
  is bounded by 
 
 
 
 .
