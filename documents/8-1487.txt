   Kopp's law      Kopp's law   (Figure)  Hermann Franz Moritz Kopp   Kopp's law can refer to either of two relationships discovered by the German chemist Hermann Franz Moritz Kopp (1817–1892).   Kopp found "that the molecular heat capacity of a solid compound is the sum of the atomic heat capacities of the elements composing it; the elements having atomic heat capacities lower than those required by the law of Dulong and Petit retain these lower values in their compounds." 1  In studying organic compounds, Kopp found a regular relationship between boiling points and the number of CH 2 groups present. 2   Kopp–Neumann law  Kopp–Neumann law states that the specific heat  C per unit mass (in J•kg −1 •K −1 ) for alloys can be calculated from the following equation:      C  =    ∑   i  =  1   N    (    C  i   ⋅   f  i    )        C    superscript   subscript     i  1    N    normal-⋅   subscript  C  i    subscript  f  i       C=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(C_{i}\cdot f_{i})     where: i - subsequent numbers from 1 to N , N - total number of alloy constituents, C i and f i - specific heat and mass fraction of the i -th constituent.
