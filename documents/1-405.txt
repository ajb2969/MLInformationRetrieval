   Freeman Dyson      Freeman Dyson   Freeman John Dyson  FRS (born 15 December 1923) is an English-born American 1 2 theoretical physicist and mathematician , known for his work in quantum electrodynamics , solid-state physics , astronomy and nuclear engineering . Dyson is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists . 3  Biography  Early life  Born on 15 December 1923, at Crowthorne in Berkshire , Dyson is the son of the English composer George Dyson , who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker. 4 Although not known to be related to the early 20th-century astronomer Frank Watson Dyson , as a small boy Dyson was aware of him and has credited the popularity of an astronomer sharing his surname as having helped to spark his own interest in science. At the age of five he calculated the number of atoms in the sun. 5 As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book Men of Mathematics by Eric Temple Bell . 6  From 1936 to 1941, Dyson was a Scholar at Winchester College , where his father was Director of Music. On 25 July 1943, he entered the Operational Research Section (ORS) of the Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command , 7 where he developed analytical methods to help the Royal Air Force to bomb German targets during the Second World War . 8 After the war, Dyson was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge , 9 where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics. 10 From 1946 to 1949 he was a Fellow of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein , who resigned his professorship in 1947. 11 In 1947 he published two papers in Number theory 12 13  Career in the United States  In 1947 Dyson moved to the US, as Commonwealth Fellow at Cornell University (1947–1948) and the Institute for Advanced Study (1948–1949). Between 1949 and 1951, he was a teaching fellow at the University of Birmingham (UK). 14  In 1951 he joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor, although still lacking a doctorate, and in 1953 he received a permanent post at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey —where he has now lived for more than fifty years. 15 In 1957 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and renounced his British nationality . One reason he gave decades later is that his children born in the US had not been recognized as British subjects. 16 17  In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two then-current formulations of quantum electrodynamics — Richard Feynman 's diagrams and the operator method developed by Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga . 18 He was the first person (besides Feynman) to appreciate the power of Feynman diagrams , and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the renormalization problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED (quantum electrodynamics) in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. Robert Oppenheimer , in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words. 19  Also in 1949, in a related work, Dyson invented the Dyson series . 20 It was this paper that inspired John Ward to derive his celebrated Ward identity . 21  Dyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices. 22 There is an interesting story involving random matrices. In 1973 the number theorist Hugh Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function . He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg who said it looked like something in mathematical physics and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble , which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the distribution of primes 2,3,5,7,11, ... and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium . 23  From 1957 to 1961 he worked on the Orion Project , which proposed the possibility of space-flight using nuclear pulse propulsion . A prototype was demonstrated using conventional explosives , but the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty (which Dyson was involved in and supported) permitted only underground nuclear testing , so the project was abandoned.  In 1958 he led the design team for the TRIGA , a small, inherently safe nuclear reactor used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of medical isotopes .  A seminal work by Dyson came in 1966 when, together with Andrew Lenard and independently of Elliott H. Lieb and Walter Thirring , he proved rigorously that the exclusion principle plays the main role in the stability of bulk matter. 24 25 26 Hence, it is not the electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons which prevents two wood blocks that are left on top of each other from coalescing into a single piece, but rather it is the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic normal force . In condensed matter physics , Dyson also did studies in the phase transition of the Ising model in 1 dimension and spin waves . 27  Around 1979, Dyson worked with the Institute for Energy Analysis on climate studies . This group, under the direction of Alvin Weinberg , pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, he worked on climate studies conducted by the JASON defense advisory group. 28  Dyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994. 29 In 1998, Dyson joined the board of the Solar Electric Light Fund .  he was president of the Space Studies Institute , the space research organization founded by Gerard K. O'Neill ;  he is on its Board of Trustees. 30 Dyson is a long-time member of the JASON group.  Dyson is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books .  Dyson has won numerous scientific awards but never a Nobel Prize . Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg has said that the Nobel committee has "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson himself remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style." 31  In 2012, he published (with William H. Press ) a fundamental new result about the Prisoner's Dilemma in PNAS . 32  Marriages and children  With his first wife, the mathematician Verena Huber-Dyson , Dyson has two children, Esther and George . In 1958 he married Imme Jung, a masters runner , and they eventually had four more children, Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson. 33  Dyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called "the most influential woman in all the computer world." 34 His son George is a historian of science , 35 one of whose books is Project Orion : The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965 .  Character  Friends and colleagues describe Dyson as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends find refreshing but his intellectual opponents find exasperating. "I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice", Steven Weinberg said of him. His friend, the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks , said: "A favorite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life." 36 In The God Delusion (2006), biologist Richard Dawkins criticized Dyson for accepting the religious Templeton Prize in 2000; "It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists." 37 However, Dyson declared in 2000 that he is a (non-denominational) Christian, 38 and he has disagreed with Dawkins on several occasions, as when he criticized Dawkins' understanding of evolution . 39  Honors and awards  In 1952 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society . 40  Dyson was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1966, Max Planck Medal in 1969, the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1970, 41 42 and the Harvey Prize in 1977.  In the 1984–85 academic year he gave the Gifford lectures at Aberdeen , which resulted in the book Infinite In All Directions .  In 1989, Dyson taught at Duke University as a Fritz London Memorial Lecturer. In the same year, he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, University of Cambridge.  Dyson has published a number of collections of speculations and observations about technology, science, and the future. In 1996 he was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science .  In 1993, Dyson was given the Enrico Fermi Award .  In 1995 he gave the Jerusalem-Harvard Lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , sponsored jointly by the Hebrew University and Harvard University Press that grew into the book Imagined Worlds . 43  In 2000, Dyson was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.  In 2003, Dyson was awarded the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology in Telluride, Colorado .  In 2011, Dyson was received as one of twenty distinguished Old Wykehamists at the Ad Portas celebration, the highest honour that Winchester College bestows.  Concepts  Biotechnology and genetic engineering   Dyson cheerfully admits his record as a prophet is mixed, but "it is better to be wrong than to be vague." 44  "To answer the world's material needs, technology has to be not only beautiful but also cheap." 45  The Origin of Life  Dyson favors the dual origin concept: Life first formed cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian Alexander Oparin . 46  J. B. S. Haldane developed the same theory independently. 47 Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. He proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, DNA was invented accidentally because of the similarity of the two. Current cells contain Adenosine triphosphate or ATP and adenosine 5'-monophosphate or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity of the two. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed Eigen 's experiment and produced RNA.  Unfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these "little city economies" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment. 48  Dyson sphere    In 1960 Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal Science , entitled "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation". 49 In it, he theorized that a technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization might completely surround its native star with artificial structures in order to maximize the capture of the star's available energy. Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as infrared radiation. Therefore, one method of searching for extraterrestrial civilizations would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum .  Dyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of asteroid -sized space habitats , though science fiction writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often referred to as a Dyson sphere , although Dyson himself used the term "shell". Dyson says that he used the term "artificial biosphere" in the article meaning a habitat, not a shape. 50 The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been advanced decades earlier by author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel Star Maker , a source that Dyson has credited publicly. 51 52  Dyson tree  Dyson has also proposed the creation of a Dyson tree , a genetically-engineered plant capable of growing on a comet . He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer solar system .   Space colonies   Dyson has been interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such science fiction classics as Olaf Stapledon 's Star Maker . As a young man, he worked for General Atomics on the nuclear-powered Orion spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. He's been unhappy for a quarter-century on how the government conducts space travel:  He still hopes for cheap space travel, but is resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new—and cheap.  Dyson also has proposed the use of bioengineered space colonies to colonize the Kuiper Belt on the outer edge of our Solar System. He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores. The colonies could then be warmed by large reflector plant leaves that could focus the dim, distant sunlight back on the growing colony. This was illustrated by Pat Rawlings on the cover of the National Space Society's Ad Astra magazine.  Space exploration  Dyson's transform  Dyson also has some credits in pure mathematics. His concept "Dyson's transform" led to one of the most important lemmas of Olivier Ramaré 's theorem that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.  Dyson series  The Dyson series , the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent Schrödinger equation by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator     𝒯  ,     𝒯   \mathcal{T}\,,   an entity of basic importance in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics , are also named after Dyson.  (Figure)  Freeman Dyson in 2007 at the Institute for Advanced Study   Quantum physics and prime numbers  Dyson and Hugh Montgomery discovered together an intriguing connection between quantum physics and Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture about the zeros of the Zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the Riemann Zeta function , and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers. 53 What Montgomery and Dyson discovered is that the eigenvalues of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the Zeta function. Andrew Odlyzko has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm to calculate many zeros. Dyson recognized this connection because of a number-theory question Montgomery asked him. Dyson had published results in number theory in 1947 while a Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge and so was able to understand Montgomery's question. If Montgomery had not been visiting the Institute for Advanced Study that week, this connection might not have been discovered.  Views  Metaphysics  Dyson has suggested a kind of cosmic metaphysics of mind . In his book Infinite in All Directions he writes about three levels of mind: "The universe shows evidence of the operations of mind on three levels. The first level is the level of elementary physical processes in quantum mechanics. Matter in quantum mechanics is [...] constantly making choices between alternative possibilities according to probabilistic laws. [...] The second level at which we detect the operations of mind is the level of direct human experience. [...] [I]t is reasonable to believe in the existence of a third level of mind, a mental component of the universe. If we believe in this mental component and call it God, then we can say that we are small pieces of God's mental apparatus" (p. 297).  Global warming  Dyson agrees that anthropogenic global warming exists, and has written that "[one] of the main causes of warming is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from our burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal and natural gas." 54 However, he believes that existing simulation models of climate fail to account for some important factors, and hence the results will contain too much error to reliably predict future trends:  He is among signatories of a letter to the UN criticizing the IPCC 55 56 and has also argued against ostracizing scientists whose views depart from the acknowledged mainstream of scientific opinion on climate change , stating that "heretics" have historically been an important force in driving scientific progress. "[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies." 57  Dyson says his views on global warming have been strongly criticized. In reply, he notes that "[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it’s rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have." 58  More recently, he has endorsed the now common usage of "global warming" as synonymous with global anthropogenic climate change, referring to "measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science." 59  He has, however, argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority:  Since originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson has suggested that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculates that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere. 60 61  In a 2014 interview, he said that "What I’m convinced of is that we don’t understand climate ... It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled." 62  Nuclear winter  From his 1988 book Infinite in All Directions , he offered some criticism of then current models predicting a devastating nuclear winter in the event of a large-scale nuclear war:  Warfare and weapons  At the British Bomber Command , Dyson and colleagues proposed ripping out two gun turrets from the RAF Lancaster bombers , to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the Battle of Berlin . A Lancaster without turrets could fly  faster and be much more maneuverable.  On hearing the news of the bombing of Hiroshima :  In 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War . When a general said in a meeting "I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing," 63 Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia , published by the Institute for Defense Analyses , was obtained, with some redactions, by The Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability under the Freedom of Information act in 2002.) 64 It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that even from a narrow military point of view the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the Dick Cavett show that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because "our targets were large and theirs were small." (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)  Dyson opposed the Vietnam War , the Gulf War , and the invasion of Iraq . He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 US presidential election and The New York Times has described him as a political liberal . 65  Civil Defense  While teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defense authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US doesn't build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of Mutual assured destruction and destabilize things, because the US would be able to launch a first strike and survive a retaliatory second strike. 66  The role of failure   On English academics  Science and religion  He is a non-denominational Christian and has attended various churches from Presbyterian to Roman Catholic . Regarding doctrinal or Christological issues, he has said, "I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology." 67  Dyson partially disagrees with the famous remark by his fellow physicist Steven Weinberg that "With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion." 68   While Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith. 69 70 For example, here is a passage from Dyson's review of The God of Hope and the End of the World from John Polkinghorne :   Works   Symmetry Groups in Nuclear and Particle Physics , 1966 (Academic-oriented text)  Interstellar Transport , Physics Today 1968  Disturbing the Universe , 1979, ISBN 0-06-011108-9. 71 [ http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983IrAJ ...16...88D Review]  Weapons and Hope , 1984 (Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award). 72 73  Review  Origins of Life , 1986.
