Guanidinoacetase

In enzymology, a guanidinoacetase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

guanidinoacetate + H2O 
 
 
 
  glycine + urea
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are guanidinoacetate and H2O, whereas its two products are glycine and urea.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is guanidinoacetate amidinohydrolase. This enzyme is also called glycocyaminase. It employs one cofactor, manganese.
