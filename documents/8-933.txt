   Relaxation (approximation)      Relaxation (approximation)   In mathematical optimization and related fields, relaxation is a modeling strategy . A relaxation is an approximation of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve. A solution of the relaxed problem provides information about the original problem.  For example, a linear programming relaxation of an integer programming problem removes the integrality constraint and so allows non-integer rational solutions. A Lagrangian relaxation of a complicated problem in combinatorial optimization penalizes violations of some constraints, allowing an easier relaxed problem to be solved. Relaxation techniques complement or supplement branch and bound algorithms of combinatorial optimization; linear programming and Lagrangian relaxations are used to obtain bounds in branch-and-bound algorithms for integer programming. 1  The modeling strategy of relaxation should not be confused with iterative methods of relaxation , such as successive over-relaxation (SOR); iterative methods of relaxation are used in solving problems in differential equations , linear least-squares , and linear programming . 2 3 4 However, iterative methods of relaxation have been used to solve Lagrangian relaxations. 5  Definition  A relaxation of the minimization problem      z  =   min   {    c   (  x  )    :   x  ‚àà  X  ‚äÜ   ùêë  n     }        z     normal-:    c  x       x  X        superscript  ùêë  n         z=\min\{c(x):x\in X\subseteq\mathbf{R}^{n}\}     is another minimization problem of the form       z  R   =   min   {     c  R    (  x  )    :   x  ‚àà   X  R   ‚äÜ   ùêë  n     }         subscript  z  R      normal-:     subscript  c  R   x       x   subscript  X  R         superscript  ùêë  n         z_{R}=\min\{c_{R}(x):x\in X_{R}\subseteq\mathbf{R}^{n}\}     with these two properties        X  R   ‚äá  X      X   subscript  X  R     X_{R}\supseteq X           c  R    (  x  )    ‚â§   c   (  x  )           subscript  c  R   x     c  x     c_{R}(x)\leq c(x)   for all    x  ‚àà  X      x  X    x\in X   .   The first property states that the original problem's feasible domain is a subset of the relaxed problem's feasible domain. The second property states that the original problem's objective-function is greater than or equal to the relaxed problem's objective-function. 6  Properties  If    x  *     superscript  x     x^{*}   is an optimal solution of the original problem, then     x  *   ‚àà  X  ‚äÜ   X  R          superscript  x    X        subscript  X  R      x^{*}\in X\subseteq X_{R}   and    z  =   c   (   x  *   )    ‚â•    c  R    (   x  *   )    ‚â•   z  R         z    c   superscript  x             subscript  c  R    superscript  x           subscript  z  R      z=c(x^{*})\geq c_{R}(x^{*})\geq z_{R}   . Therefore     x  *   ‚àà   X  R        superscript  x     subscript  X  R     x^{*}\in X_{R}   provides an upper bound on    z  R     subscript  z  R    z_{R}   .  If in addition to the previous assumptions,      c  R    (  x  )    =   c   (  x  )           subscript  c  R   x     c  x     c_{R}(x)=c(x)   ,     ‚àÄ  x   ‚àà  X       for-all  x   X    \forall x\in X   , the following holds: If an optimal solution for the relaxed problem is feasible for the original problem, then it is optimal for the original problem. 7  Some relaxation techniques   Linear programming relaxation  Lagrangian relaxation    Semidefinite relaxation  Surrogate relaxation and duality   Notes    References       .        . )|        W.
