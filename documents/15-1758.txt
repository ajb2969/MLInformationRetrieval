   Hagen–Rubens relation      Hagen–Rubens relation   In optics , the Hagen–Rubens relation (or Hagen–Rubens formula ) is a relation between the coefficient of reflection and the conductivity for materials that are good conductors. 1 The relation states that for solids where the contribution of the dielectric constant to the index of refraction is negligible, the reflection coefficient can be written as (in SI Units ): 2     R  ≈   1  -   2     2   ϵ  0   ω   σ          R    1    2        2   subscript  ϵ  0   ω   σ        R\approx 1-2\sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_{0}\omega}{\sigma}}     where   ω   ω   \omega   is the frequency of observation,   σ   σ   \sigma   is the conductivity, and    ϵ  0     subscript  ϵ  0    \epsilon_{0}   is the vacuum permittivity .  The relation is named after German physicists Ernst Bessel Hagen and Heinrich Rubens in 1903, who discovered it in 1903. 3  References  "  Category:Infrared spectroscopy     ↩  ↩  ↩
