Hagen–Rubens relation

In optics, the Hagen–Rubens relation (or Hagen–Rubens formula) is a relation between the coefficient of reflection and the conductivity for materials that are good conductors.1 The relation states that for solids where the contribution of the dielectric constant to the index of refraction is negligible, the reflection coefficient can be written as (in SI Units):2


where 
 
 
 
  is the frequency of observation, 
 
 
 
  is the conductivity, and 
 
 
 
 
  is the vacuum permittivity.
The relation is named after German physicists Ernst Bessel Hagen and Heinrich Rubens in 1903, who discovered it in 1903.3
