Prosolanapyrone-III cycloisomerase

Prosolanapyrone-III cycloisomerase (, Sol5, SPS, solanapyrone synthase (bifunctional enzyme: prosolanapyrone II oxidase/prosolanapyrone III cyclosiomerase)) is an enzyme with system name prosolanapyrone-III:(-)-solanapyrone A isomerase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

prosolanapyrone III 
 
 
 
  (-)-solanapyrone A
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin solanapyrone in some fungi.
