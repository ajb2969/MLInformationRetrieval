Serine—tRNA ligase




Serine—tRNA ligase

In enzymology, a serine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-serine + tRNASer 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-seryl-tRNASer
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-serine, and tRNA(Ser), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and L-seryl-tRNA(Ser).
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine:tRNASer ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include seryl-tRNA synthetase, SerRS, seryl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase, seryl-transfer RNA synthetase, seryl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase, and serine translase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis.
