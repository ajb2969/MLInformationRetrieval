   Paraxial approximation      Paraxial approximation   In geometric optics , the paraxial approximation is a small-angle approximation used in Gaussian optics and ray tracing of light through an optical system (such as a lens ). 1  2  A paraxial ray is a ray which makes a small angle ( θ ) to the optical axis of the system, and lies close to the axis throughout the system. 3 Generally, this allows three important approximations (for θ in radians ) for calculation of the ray's path, namely: 4        sin  θ   ≈  θ   ,     tan  θ   ≈   θ  and      cos  θ   ≈  1.       formulae-sequence      θ   θ    formulae-sequence      θ    θ  and        θ   1.      \sin\theta\approx\theta,\quad\tan\theta\approx\theta\quad\text{and}\quad\cos%
 \theta\approx 1.     The paraxial approximation is used in Gaussian optics and first-order ray tracing. 5  Ray transfer matrix analysis is one method that uses the approximation.  In some cases, the second-order approximation is also called "paraxial". The approximations above for sine and tangent do not change for the "second-order" paraxial approximation (the second term in their Taylor series expansion is zero), while for cosine the second order approximation is        cos  θ   ≈   1  -     θ  2   2      .        θ     1     superscript  θ  2   2      \cos\theta\approx 1-{\theta^{2}\over 2}\ .     The second-order approximation is accurate within 0.5% for angles under about 10°, but its inaccuracy grows significantly for larger angles. 6  For larger angles it is often necessary to distinguish between meridional rays , which lie in a plane containing the optical axis , and sagittal rays , which do not.
