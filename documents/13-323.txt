Hausdorff–Young inequality

In mathematics, the Hausdorff−Young inequality bounds the Lq-norm of the Fourier coefficients of a periodic function for q ≥ 2.  proved the inequality for some special values of q, and  proved it in general. More generally the inequality also applies to the Fourier transform of a function on a locally compact group, such as Rn, and in this case  and  gave a sharper form of it called the Babenko–Beckner inequality.
We consider the Fourier operator, namely let T be the operator that takes a function 
 
 
 
  on the unit circle and outputs the sequence of its Fourier coefficients



Parseval's theorem shows that T is bounded from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  with norm 1. On the other hand, clearly,



so T is bounded from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  with norm 1. Therefore we may invoke the Riesz–Thorin theorem to get, for any 1 L^p to 
 
 
 
 , is bounded with norm 1, where



In a short formula, this says that



This is the well known Hausdorff–Young inequality. For p > 2 the natural extrapolation of this inequality fails, and the fact that a function belongs to 
 
 
 
 , does not give any additional information on the order of growth of its Fourier series beyond the fact that it is in 
 
 
 
 .
Optimal estimates
The constant involved in the Hausdorff–Young inequality can be made optimal by using careful estimates from the theory of harmonic analysis. If
