   (S)-carnitine 3-dehydrogenase      (S)-carnitine 3-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (S)-carnitine 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-carnitine + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-dehydrocarnitine + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-carnitine and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydrocarnitine , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-carnitine:NAD + oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
