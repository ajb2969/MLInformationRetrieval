   Branching theorem      Branching theorem   In mathematics , the branching theorem is a theorem about Riemann surfaces . Intuitively, it states that every non-constant holomorphic function is locally a polynomial .  Statement of the theorem  Let   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   be Riemann surfaces, and let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a non-constant holomorphic map. Fix a point    a  ∈  X      a  X    a\in X   and set    b  :=   f   (  a  )    ∈  Y       assign  b    f  a        Y     b:=f(a)\in Y   . Then there exist    k  ∈  𝒩      k  𝒩    k\in\mathcal{N}   and charts      ψ  1   :    U  1   →   V  1       normal-:   subscript  ψ  1    normal-→   subscript  U  1    subscript  V  1      \psi_{1}:U_{1}\to V_{1}   on   X   X   X   and     ψ  2   :    U  2   →   V  2       normal-:   subscript  ψ  2    normal-→   subscript  U  2    subscript  V  2      \psi_{2}:U_{2}\to V_{2}   on   Y   Y   Y   such that         ψ  1    (  a  )    =    ψ  2    (  b  )    =  0           subscript  ψ  1   a      subscript  ψ  2   b        0     \psi_{1}(a)=\psi_{2}(b)=0   ; and        ψ  2   ∘  f  ∘   ψ  1   -  1     :    V  1   →   V  2       normal-:     subscript  ψ  2   f   superscript   subscript  ψ  1     1      normal-→   subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2      \psi_{2}\circ f\circ\psi_{1}^{-1}:V_{1}\to V_{2}   is     z  ↦   z  k    .     maps-to  z   superscript  z  k     z\mapsto z^{k}.      This theorem gives rise to several definitions:   We call   k   k   k   the ''[[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity   ]]'' of   f   f   f   at   a   a   a   . Some authors denote this    ν   (  f  ,  a  )       ν   f  a     \nu(f,a)   .   If    k  >  1      k  1    k>1   , the point   a   a   a   is called a branch point of   f   f   f   .  If   f   f   f   has no branch points, it is called unbranched . See also unramified morphism .   References    .   "  Category:Theorems in complex analysis  Category:Riemann surfaces
