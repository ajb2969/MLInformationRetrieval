   Rank 3 permutation group      Rank 3 permutation group   In mathematical finite group theory , a rank 3 permutation group  acts transitively on a set such that the stabilizer of a point has 3 orbits . The study of these groups was started by . Several of the sporadic simple groups were discovered as rank 3 permutation groups.  Classification  The primitive rank 3 permutation groups are all in one of the following classes:    classified the ones such that     T  ×  T   ≤  G  ≤    T  0    wr    Z  /  2   Z             T  T   G          subscript  T  0    wr      Z  2   Z        T\times T\leq G\leq T_{0}\operatorname{wr}Z/2Z   where the socle  T of T 0 is simple, and T 0 is a 2-transitive group of degree √ n .   classified the ones with a regular elementary abelian normal subgroup   classified the ones whose socle is a simple alternating group   classified the ones whose socle is a simple classical group   classified the ones whose socle is a simple exceptional or sporadic group.   Examples  If G is any 4-transitive group acting on a set S , then its action on pairs of elements of S is a rank 3 permutation group. 1 In particular most of the alternating groups, symmetric groups, and Mathieu groups have 4-transitive actions, and so can be made into rank 3 permutation groups.  The projective general linear group acting on lines in a projective space of dimension at least 3 is a rank-3 permutation group.  Several 3-transposition groups are rank-3 permutation groups (in the action on transpositions).  It is common for the point-stabilizer of a rank-3 permutation group acting on one of the orbits to be a rank-3 permutation group. This gives several "chains" of rank-3 permutation groups, such as the Suzuki chain and the chain ending with the Fischer groups .  Some unusual rank-3 permutation groups (many from ) are listed below.
