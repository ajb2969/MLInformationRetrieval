Rank 3 permutation group

In mathematical finite group theory, a rank 3 permutation group acts transitively on a set such that the stabilizer of a point has 3 orbits. The study of these groups was started by . Several of the sporadic simple groups were discovered as rank 3 permutation groups.
Classification
The primitive rank 3 permutation groups are all in one of the following classes:


classified the ones such that 
 
 
 
  where the socle T of T0 is simple, and T0 is a 2-transitive group of degree √n.

classified the ones with a regular elementary abelian normal subgroup

classified the ones whose socle is a simple alternating group

classified the ones whose socle is a simple classical group

classified the ones whose socle is a simple exceptional or sporadic group.

Examples
If G is any 4-transitive group acting on a set S, then its action on pairs of elements of S is a rank 3 permutation group.1 In particular most of the alternating groups, symmetric groups, and Mathieu groups have 4-transitive actions, and so can be made into rank 3 permutation groups.
The projective general linear group acting on lines in a projective space of dimension at least 3 is a rank-3 permutation group.
Several 3-transposition groups are rank-3 permutation groups (in the action on transpositions).
It is common for the point-stabilizer of a rank-3 permutation group acting on one of the orbits to be a rank-3 permutation group. This gives several "chains" of rank-3 permutation groups, such as the Suzuki chain and the chain ending with the Fischer groups.
Some unusual rank-3 permutation groups (many from ) are listed below.
