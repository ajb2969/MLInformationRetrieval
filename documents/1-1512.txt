Catalan's constant




Catalan's constant

In mathematics, Catalan's constant G, which occasionally appears in estimates in combinatorics, is defined by



where β is the Dirichlet beta function. Its numerical value 1 is approximately 

G = 0.915 965 594 177 219 015 054 603 514 932 384 110 774 …
 

It is not known whether G is irrational, let alone transcendental.
Catalan's constant was named after Eugène Charles Catalan.
Integral identities
Some identities include






















If K(t) is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind, then





With Gamma function







The integral





is a known special function, called the Inverse tangent integral, and was extensively studied by Ramanujan.
 

Uses
G appears in combinatorics, as well as in values of the second polygamma function, also called the trigamma function, at fractional arguments:






Simon Plouffe gives an infinite collection of identities between the trigamma function, π2 and Catalan's constant; these are expressible as paths on a graph.
It also appears in connection with the hyperbolic secant distribution.
Relation to other special function
Catalan's constant occurs frequently in relation to the Clausen function, the Inverse tangent integral, the Inverse sine integral, Barnes G-function, as well as integrals and series summable in terms of the aforementioned functions.
As a particular example, by first expressing the Inverse tangent integral in its closed form – in terms of Clausen functions - and then expressing those Clausen functions in terms of the Barnes G-function, the following expression is easily obtained (N.B. all the relevant relations for this derivation have been added to the page for the Clausen function):

If one defines the Lerch transcendent, 
 
 
 
 , (related to the Lerch zeta function) by,


 
 ,
then it is clear that



Quickly converging series
The following two formulas involve quickly converging series, and are thus appropriate for numerical computation:



and



The theoretical foundations for such series is given by Broadhurst (the first formula)1 and Ramanujan (the second formula).2 The algorithms for fast evaluation of the Catalan constant is constructed by E. Karatsuba.34
Known digits
The number of known digits of Catalan's constant G has increased dramatically during the last decades. This is due both to the increase of performance of computers as well as to algorithmic improvements.5
