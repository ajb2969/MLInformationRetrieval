It has 8 vertices , 28 edges , 56 triangle faces , 70 tetrahedral cells , 56 5-cell 5-faces, 28 5-simplex 6-faces, and 8 6-simplex 7-faces. Its dihedral angle is cos −1 (1/7), or approximately 81.79°.  Alternate names  It can also be called an octaexon , or octa-7-tope , as an 8- facetted polytope in 7-dimensions. The name  octaexon is derived from octa for eight facets in Greek and -ex for having six-dimensional facets, and -on . Jonathan Bowers gives an octaexon the acronym oca . 1  Coordinates  The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of an origin-centered regular octaexon having edge length 2 are:      (    1  /  28    ,    1  /  21    ,    1  /  15    ,    1  /  10    ,    1  /  6    ,    1  /  3    ,   ±  1   )         1  28        1  21        1  15        1  10        1  6        1  3     plus-or-minus  1     \left(\sqrt{1/28},\ \sqrt{1/21},\ \sqrt{1/15},\ \sqrt{1/10},\ \sqrt{1/6},\ %

This construction is based on facets of the 8-orthoplex .
