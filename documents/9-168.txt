   Hexacontagon      Hexacontagon   In geometry , a hexacontagon or hexecontagon is a sixty-sided polygon . 1 2 The sum of any hexacontagon's interior angles is 10440 degrees.  A regular hexacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {60} and also can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated  triacontagon , t{30}, which alternates two types of edges.  Regular hexacontagon properties  One interior angle in a regular hexacontagon is 174°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 6°.  The area of a regular hexacontagon is (with )      A  =   15   t  2    cot   π  60         A    15   superscript  t  2       π  60       A=15t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{60}     and its inradius is      r  =    1  2   t   cot   π  60         r      1  2   t      π  60       r=\frac{1}{2}t\cot\frac{\pi}{60}     The circumradius of a regular hexacontagon is      R  =    1  2   t   csc   π  60         R      1  2   t      π  60       R=\frac{1}{2}t\csc\frac{\pi}{60}     A regular hexacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge . 3 As a truncated  triacontagon , it can be constructed by an edge- bisection of a regular triacontagon.
