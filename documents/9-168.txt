Hexacontagon

In geometry, a hexacontagon or hexecontagon is a sixty-sided polygon.12 The sum of any hexacontagon's interior angles is 10440 degrees.
A regular hexacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {60} and also can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated triacontagon, t{30}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular hexacontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular hexacontagon is 174°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 6°.
The area of a regular hexacontagon is (with )



and its inradius is



The circumradius of a regular hexacontagon is



A regular hexacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.3 As a truncated triacontagon, it can be constructed by an edge-bisection of a regular triacontagon. This means that the trigonometric functions of π/60 can be expressed in radicals:












Hexacontagram
A hexacontagram is a 60-sided star polygon. There are 7 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {60/7}, {60/11}, {60/13}, {60/17}, {60/19}, {60/23}, and {60/29}, as well as 22 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration.
