<h1>List of recurring Futurama characters</h1>
<hr/>

<p>This is a <strong>list of recurring characters appearing in the TV show <em><a class="uri" href="Futurama" title="wikilink">Futurama</a></em></strong>. It is an <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">American</a> <a href="Cartoon_series" title="wikilink">animated</a> <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> <a class="uri" href="sitcom" title="wikilink">sitcom</a> created by <a href="Matt_Groening" title="wikilink">Matt Groening</a> and developed by Groening and <a href="David_X._Cohen" title="wikilink">David X. Cohen</a> for the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="wikilink">Fox Broadcasting Company</a>. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> <a href="pizza_delivery" title="wikilink">pizza delivery</a> boy, <a href="Philip_J._Fry" title="wikilink">Philip J. Fry</a>, who, after being unwittingly <a href="cryonics" title="wikilink">cryogenically</a> frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the <a href="Retro-futurism" title="wikilink">retro-futuristic</a> 31st century. Futurama has eight main cast members and many other incidental characters. For an overview of the show's main characters, see the <a href="list_of_Futurama_characters" title="wikilink">list of Futurama characters</a>.</p>
<h2 id="main-recurring-characters">Main recurring characters</h2>
<h3 id="nibbler">Nibbler</h3>

<p><strong>Lord Nibbler</strong> (voiced by <a href="Frank_Welker" title="wikilink">Frank Welker</a>) masquerades as an innocent, cute and unintelligent pet during most of the series. In reality, he is a highly intelligent Nibblonian and capable of communication, but tries to avoid suspicion while he protects the Earth in general and Fry in particular from the Brainspawn. Nibbler's feces consist of <a href="dark_matter" title="wikilink">dark matter</a> (as the feces of all of those of his species do), which can be used as starship fuel. It is an extremely dense material, "each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds", according to Professor Farnsworth in the season 1 episode, "<a href="Love's_Labours_Lost_in_Space" title="wikilink">Love's Labours Lost in Space</a>". After he accidentally reveals to the Planet Express crew that he can speak in <em><a href="Futurama:_Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em>, he forgets to wipe their memory of his intelligence, which it turns out does not affect them much, and from then on he speaks freely to the crew.</p>
<h3 id="zapp-brannigan">Zapp Brannigan</h3>

<p><strong>Zapp Brannigan</strong> (voiced by <a href="Billy_West" title="wikilink">Billy West</a>) is a senior member of the military of the Democratic Order of Planets (D.O.O.P.), although his title varies. Brannigan was first seen in the episode "<a href="Love's_Labours_Lost_in_Space" title="wikilink">Love's Labours Lost in Space</a>" as Captain of the starship <em>Nimbus</em>, where he imprisons Fry, Leela and Bender for violating "Brannigan's Law".</p>

<p>Zapp is generally idiotic, egotistical and painfully short-sighted. He will often mispronounce words, such as <a href="champagne_(wine)" title="wikilink">champagne</a> ("sham-PAGG-Enn") and <a class="uri" href="guacamole" title="wikilink">guacamole</a> ("GWACK-a-mole") in the episodes "Love's Labours Lost in Space" and "<a href="The_Problem_with_Popplers" title="wikilink">The Problem with Popplers</a>" (respectively). He remains lustful towards <a href="Leela_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Leela</a>. He is known to make catastrophic mistakes (such as destroying D.O.O.P. headquarters in "<a href="Brannigan,_Begin_Again" title="wikilink">Brannigan, Begin Again</a>"), yet, in the public eye, he is seen as an established and reputable leader of the Earth's army (<em><a href="Futurama:_Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em>, among others).</p>
<h3 id="kif-kroker">Kif Kroker</h3>

<p>Lieutenant <strong>Kif Kroker</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is the long-suffering assistant to Captain Zapp Brannigan, and Fourth Lieutenant on the Democratic Order of Planets (DOOP) starship Nimbus. His frustration with Brannigan's arrogance and general incompetence in Season 1 leads him to be a disaffected, indifferent, sardonic lackey, although his personality differs greatly in later seasons. Zapp thinks Kif to be his best friend and loyal confidant, whereas Kif sees Brannigan as an incompetent jerk, going so far as to call him a jackass in "Love's Labours Lost in Space". Despite this, Kif seemingly has some loyalty to Brannigan, even continuing to associate with him after Brannigan caused him to be court-martialed along with him. He is in a relationship with <a href="Amy_Wong" title="wikilink">Amy Wong</a>.</p>
<h3 id="morbo">Morbo</h3>

<p><strong>Morbo the Annihilator</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is the lovable <a href="misanthropy" title="wikilink">misanthropic</a> <a href="News_presenter" title="wikilink">anchor</a> for <em>√2 News</em>, <em>Entertainment and Earth Invasion Tonight</em>, <em>Good Morning Earth</em>, and other shows on the √2 Television Network. Morbo is an advance scout for a forthcoming alien invasion, but does not bother to be subtle about it, often expressing his contempt and extreme hatred for mankind during live news broadcasts and frequently comments on his species' extremely violent invasion plans. He appears to be using his job to gather information about the human race for the invasion still yet to come. He is good friends with President <a href="#Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His co-host <a href="#Linda_van_Schoonhoven" title="wikilink">Linda van Schoonhoven</a> seems either blissfully ignorant or entirely dismissive of Morbo's hatred and usually responds with an empty-headed laugh to Morbo's contemptuous outbursts. He is married to Mrs. (Fawn) Morbo, another member of his species.</p>
<h3 id="linda-van-schoonhoven">Linda van Schoonhoven</h3>

<p><strong>Linda van Schoonhoven</strong> (voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>) is the co-anchor of √2 News with Morbo. She is blissfully unaware of or indifferent to his hatred for humanity, often giggling absentmindedly when he calls for the death of humans. Linda joins Leela and her feministas in <em><a href="Into_the_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into the Wild Green Yonder</a></em> due to Morbo being treated better than her by the producers with higher pay and more air time. In "<a class="uri" href="Benderama" title="wikilink">Benderama</a>", it is revealed that she is a severe alcoholic, which may explain her cheerful and seemingly oblivious demeanor. It is also revealed that a contributing cause to her alcoholism is her relationship to her children.</p>
<h3 id="scruffy">Scruffy</h3>

<p><strong>Scruffy</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is the Planet Express janitor who appears in many episodes. He generally approaches both his job and the rest of his life with a high level of apathy, as shown in "<a href="Parasites_Lost" title="wikilink">Parasites Lost</a>", in which he ignores a broken boiler in the Planet Express Headquarters to read a <a href="pornographic_magazine" title="wikilink">pornographic magazine</a>, and continues to read even after said boiler explodes, declaring, "Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived." In "<a href="Future_Stock" title="wikilink">Future Stock</a>", it is revealed that he is deeply fond of the company, and owns four times as much stock as the other employees. The first several times he is referred to or seen by his co-workers, they ask who he is, to which he replies, "I'm Scruffy. The janitor." He is shown several times to read porn magazines like <em>National Pornographic</em> and <em>Zero G Juggs</em> (parodies of actual magazines, <em><a href="National_Geographic_(magazine)" title="wikilink">National Geographic</a></em> and <em><a class="uri" href="Juggs" title="wikilink">Juggs</a></em>). The Season 6 episode "<a href="The_Prisoner_of_Benda" title="wikilink">The Prisoner of Benda</a>" reveals that he is in love with his robotic wash bucket, but avoids a full relationship. He is murdered by Robot Santa in the non-canonical anthology episode "<a href="The_Futurama_Holiday_Spectacular" title="wikilink">The Futurama Holiday Spectacular</a>". In "<a href="Law_&amp;_Oracle" title="wikilink">Law &amp; Oracle</a>", it is revealed that Scruffy was <a href="necromancy" title="wikilink">brought back to life</a> as a <a class="uri" href="zombie" title="wikilink">zombie</a>, remarking that "Life and death are a seamless continuum."</p>
<h2 id="planet-express-crew-relatives">Planet Express crew relatives</h2>
<h3 id="cubert-farnsworth">Cubert Farnsworth</h3>

<p><strong>Cubert Farnsworth</strong> (voiced by <a href="Kath_Soucie" title="wikilink">Kath Soucie</a>) is <a href="Professor_Farnsworth" title="wikilink">Professor Farnsworth</a>'s clone, which the Professor produced in order to serve as his heir and continue his scientific legacy. He is introduced in the episode "<a href="A_Clone_of_My_Own" title="wikilink">A Clone of My Own</a>", in which he rejects Farnsworth and becomes hostile to the entire Planet Express crew. Professor Farnsworth reveals that he had been lying about his age, and is taken to the Near Death Star for retirement. The crew rescues the professor, and Cubert announces that he will continue the professor's science after all.</p>

<p>The Professor created Cubert with the intention that he would continue his work after discovering that his life was wasted with nothing but failed or worthless inventions. Hubert is delighted until he discovers that Cubert's intentions are not as he planned. Cubert wants to do something 'better' with his life and does not accept the responsibility Hubert gives to him. He believes most things that happen to be "Impossible" contrary to the Professor's belief that nothing is impossible. Cubert has an epiphany after getting hit on the head, realizing how the starship engines Hubert invented work, allowing them to be repaired while Hubert is incapacitated. After this, he decides he wants to follow in his "father's" footsteps after all.</p>
<h3 id="dwight-conrad">Dwight Conrad</h3>

<p><strong>Dwight Conrad</strong> (voiced by <a href="Bumper_Robinson" title="wikilink">Bumper Robinson</a> in the TV series, <a href="Phil_LaMarr" title="wikilink">Phil LaMarr</a> in the films) is the son of <a href="Hermes_Conrad" title="wikilink">Hermes Conrad</a> and LaBarbara Conrad. He is the close friend of Cubert Farnsworth, and takes after his father in the ways of accounting and <a class="uri" href="bureaucracy" title="wikilink">bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="labarbara-conrad">LaBarbara Conrad</h3>

<p><strong>LaBarbara Conrad</strong> (voiced by <a href="Dawnn_Lewis" title="wikilink">Dawnn Lewis</a>) is the wife of <a href="Hermes_Conrad" title="wikilink">Hermes Conrad</a> and mother of Dwight Conrad. She is the ex-wife of Barbados Slim, the rival of Hermes, who she refers to as "a human <a class="uri" href="Adonis" title="wikilink">Adonis</a>" and "a mahogany god." Hermes is insecure when Barbados is around, and LaBarbara leaves Hermes temporarily in <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em> to be with Barbados Slim after Hermes loses his body. She often wears clothes that reveal her <a href="belly_button" title="wikilink">belly button</a> (like <a href="Amy_Wong" title="wikilink">Amy Wong</a>).</p>
<h3 id="turanga-morris-and-munda">Turanga Morris and Munda</h3>

<p><strong>Turanga Morris</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) and <strong>Turanga Munda</strong> (voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>) are Leela's father and mother. They are sewer mutants who love Leela deeply and try to give her as normal a life as possible by passing her off as an alien and leaving her to be raised in an orphanage. They participate in her life as much as possible from the sewers until Leela finally learns the truth and attempts to form a real relationship. They each have one eye, Morris has a vertically oriented mouth, ten toes on each foot, and the ability to shed his skin, while Munda has a lion tail, ungulate legs, and octopus tentacles in place of arms. Their original appearance in "<a href="I_Second_That_Emotion_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">I Second That Emotion</a>" shows them as plain cyclopes like Leela. The plot of "<a href="Leela's_Homeworld" title="wikilink">Leela's Homeworld</a>" required the addition of extra mutations to fit with the idea that Leela is able to live a normal life, while they cannot.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the same episode it is also revealed that Munda has a <a class="uri" href="Ph.D." title="wikilink">Ph.D.</a> in "exo-linguistics", which allows her to write in "<a class="uri" href="Alienese" title="wikilink">Alienese</a>".</p>
<h3 id="leo-and-inez-wong">Leo and Inez Wong</h3>

<p><strong>Leo Wong</strong> (voiced by <a href="Billy_West" title="wikilink">Billy West</a>) and <strong>Inez Wong</strong> (voiced by <a href="Lauren_Tom" title="wikilink">Lauren Tom</a>) are the very wealthy parents of <a href="Amy_Wong" title="wikilink">Amy Wong</a>. They are human <a href="Martian" title="wikilink">Martians</a> of Chinese descent who own the entire <a href="Geography_of_Mars" title="wikilink">western hemisphere of Mars</a> (which they claim is the best one) and the Wong <a href="Where_the_Buggalo_Roam" title="wikilink">buggalo</a> ranch. They often pester Amy about their lack of grandchildren and meddle in her love life, trying to find a man to father their grandchild. When Amy and Kif Kroker begin dating, they decide Kif is not man enough for her. They do seem happy when <a href="Kif_Gets_Knocked_Up_a_Notch" title="wikilink">he and Amy have children</a>. Leo is one of the primary villains in <em><a href="Into_the_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into the Wild Green Yonder</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="antagonists">Antagonists</h2>
<h3 id="mom">Mom</h3>

<p><strong>Mom</strong> (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an aggressive, threatening and <a class="uri" href="Machiavellian" title="wikilink">Machiavellian</a> bully, reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the West. She manages and owns 99.7% of MomCorp, a large, multi-billion dollar industrial complex with numerous subsidiaries and a monopoly on robot production. Publicly, she retains the corporate image of a sweet, bustling old woman who often slips into the stereotype of a Deep South grandmother; behind the scenes, she removes her fat suit and emerges as a skeleton-thin, malevolent, and foul-mouthed old crow. She has three sons, Walt, Larry and Igner, whom she terrorizes and often employs to do her dirty work. Mom has a romantic history with <a href="Hubert_J._Farnsworth" title="wikilink">Hubert J. Farnsworth</a>, who worked at MomCorp as a young(ish) man, and she was previously married to Dr. Ogden Wernstrom.</p>
<h3 id="walt-larry-and-igner">Walt, Larry and Igner</h3>

<p><strong>Walt</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>), <strong>Larry</strong> (<a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) and <strong>Igner</strong> (<a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a>) are Mom's three sons, who are often on the receiving end of her verbal and physical abuse. It is revealed in <em><a href="Bender's_Game" title="wikilink">Bender's Game</a></em> that Professor Farnsworth is Igner's father.</p>
<h3 id="omicronians">Omicronians</h3>

<p>The <strong>Omicronians</strong> are an alien race of the planet Omicron Persei 8.</p>
<h4 id="drrr">Drrr</h4>

<p>Drrr, Doctor of planet Omicron Persei 8 is the Veterinarian to whom Lrrr's son Jrrr takes Fry after Fry becomes sick from ingesting Omicronian feces as candy.</p>
<h4 id="lrrr">Lrrr</h4>

<p><strong>Lrrr</strong> (, voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is ruler of the planet <a href="Stars_and_planetary_systems_in_fiction#Omicron_Persei_(Al_Atik)" title="wikilink">Omicron Persei 8</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and is currently married to Ndnd , his second wife. His first major appearance in the series was in the episode "<a href="When_Aliens_Attack" title="wikilink">When Aliens Attack</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In "<a href="Lrrreconcilable_Ndndifferences" title="wikilink">Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</a>", he claims to have murdered his father for his cape. Omicronian young were briefly a fast-food menu item on Earth known as <a href="The_Problem_with_Popplers" title="wikilink">Popplers</a>. This practice ended after Lrrr and Ndnd came to Earth and demanded they be allowed to eat the Earthlings as payback.</p>

<p>Lrrr's character has been described as "ridiculous" by Zack Handlen of <a href="The_A.V._Club" title="wikilink">The A.V. Club</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> whereas Sean Gandert of <a href="Paste_(magazine)" title="wikilink">Paste</a> describes the character as a "<a href="stock_character" title="wikilink">stock character</a>".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Gandert also describes the character as a "midlife-crisis oaf" who is dumb and lazy in the episode "Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="ndnd">Ndnd</h4>

<p><strong>Ndnd</strong> (, pronounced <em>nn-da-NN-da</em> prior to season six, <em>nn-da NN-da</em> in season six, and voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>) is Lrrr's second wife. She is overbearing and bossy, often nagging Lrrr to eat more healthily and fulfill his duties as supreme ruler of Omicron Persei 8. In "<a href="Lrrreconcilable_Ndndifferences" title="wikilink">Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</a>" she seems entirely unconcerned by Lrrr's infidelity with another Omicronian woman (actually a human trans-species cross-dresser), but is deeply upset by him listening to <a href="Leela_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Leela</a>'s nagging over her own. Their marital problems also feature heavily in "<a href="Spanish_Fry" title="wikilink">Spanish Fry</a>".</p>
<h3 id="robot-mafia">Robot Mafia</h3>

<p><strong>The Robot Mafia</strong> is a three-member crime syndicate operating out of "Fronty's Meat Market" and "Small Bill's Laundry", who periodically dine at Elzar's, hijack shipments of Zuban cigars, arrange "accidents" for robots who act against them, as well as other unspecified Mafia-related illegal activities. They are made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Donbot</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) - The leader of the Robot Mafia. Surprisingly oblivious to various plots against him, particular repeated infractions by Bender, such as but not limited to: having sex with the Donbot's wife, having sex with his daughter, stealing from the Donbot, and literally stealing the Donbot's own foot.</li>
<li><strong>Joey Mousepad</strong> (voiced by <a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a>) - A burly goonbot wearing a computer-mouse necklace.</li>
<li><strong>Clamps</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) - An unstable robot obsessed with using the clamps that act as his hands. In the Season 6 episode "<a href="The_Silence_of_the_Clamps" title="wikilink">The Silence of the Clamps</a>," a package meant for him lists his full name as <strong>Francis X. Clampazzo</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="additional-family-members">Additional family members</h4>

<p>The Donbot is married to <strong>Fanny</strong>, a female robot who has a propeller built into her rear end. She has an affair with Bender during <em><a href="Into_the_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into the Wild Green Yonder</a></em>, leading the Donbot to have both of them shot and buried several times. They survive and Fanny returns to her husband. The couple have at least two daughters, including <strong>Bella</strong>, with whom Bender has a brief relationship during "The Silence of the Clamps". Her body contains a <a href="church_bell" title="wikilink">church bell</a> that rings loudly whenever she moves.</p>
<h3 id="dr.-ogden-wernstrom">Dr. Ogden Wernstrom</h3>

<p><strong>Dr. Ogden Wernstrom</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is rival of his former college professor, <a href="Hubert_J._Farnsworth" title="wikilink">Professor Farnsworth</a>, in the field of science. He resents an "A−" grade given for sloppy penmanship by Farnsworth in 2900, and worked for over one hundred years in order to obtain revenge. Farnsworth usually greets him with an angry shaking fist and a long, drawn-out "Weeeerrnnn-strom!" He often competes against Farnsworth in various competitions, such as the Annual Inventors' Symposium, though their rivalry appears to have softened over the years, and they have even managed to collaborate with one another every once in a while. Wernstrom also appears to respect some of Farnsworth's decisions if he himself believes them to be right as well, as showed in <em><a href="The_Beast_with_a_Billion_Backs" title="wikilink">The Beast with a Billion Backs</a></em>. In <em><a href="Bender's_Game" title="wikilink">Bender's Game</a></em> it is revealed that he was once previously married to <a href="Mom_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Mom</a>, and may be the father of Mom's two eldest sons Walt and Larry.</p>

<p>The Season 6 episode "<a href="Cold_Warriors" title="wikilink">Cold Warriors</a>" reveals that Wernstrom has been appointed Surgeon General of Earth.</p>
<h3 id="richard-nixon">Richard Nixon</h3>

<p><strong><a href="Richard_Nixon" title="wikilink">Richard Nixon</a></strong> (voiced by <a href="Billy_West" title="wikilink">Billy West</a>) is kept alive as a <a href="#Celebrity_heads" title="wikilink">head in a jar</a> like many other celebrities. He originally resides in the Hall of <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Presidents</a> in the head museum, but he eventually leaves and becomes the <a href="Politics_in_Futurama" title="wikilink">President of Earth</a>, winning by a single vote.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Nixon's administration is marked by a violent and aggressive <a href="foreign_policy" title="wikilink">foreign policy</a>, frequently entering into wars which serve little or no purpose. Nixon's head is sometimes accompanied by the headless body of <a href="Spiro_Agnew" title="wikilink">Spiro Agnew</a>.</p>

<p>Billy West has commented that he is not impersonating Richard Nixon for the role; he is impersonating <a href="Anthony_Hopkins" title="wikilink">Anthony Hopkins</a> in <em><a href="Nixon_(film)" title="wikilink">Nixon</a></em> (with "a little bit of werewolf", his Nixon has a tendency to inject a sound similar to "aroo" into his sentences), and that he, instead of trying to cultivate a good impersonation, cultivates the flaws in his impersonation. Matt Groening also frequently expresses his pleasure that he can continue to poke fun at Nixon 30 or 40 years after he was in office.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Nixon's head was included in <a href="TV_Squad" title="wikilink">TV Squad</a>'s list of the five best television appearances by Presidents in animated or puppet form.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> The character was considered to be particularly interesting because he could be "pure evil" but also command respect and also because "Nixon's head trapped in glass is just really funny."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="roberto">Roberto</h3>

<p><strong>Roberto</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is a criminally insane, <a class="uri" href="psychotic" title="wikilink">psychotic</a> robot who appears to be some kind of stab-bot. His insane acts include targeting the same establishment for robbery three times in a row, killing other robots to provide a disguise, and "practicin' my stabbin'."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> There are conflicting reasons for his insanity. In the climactic scene of "<a href="Insane_in_the_Mainframe" title="wikilink">Insane in the Mainframe</a>" his dialogue suggests that his parents (namely his mother) were abusive but in <em><a href="Bender's_Game" title="wikilink">Bender's Game</a></em> he states that his creators were trying to make an insane robot, but "failed". This violent nature is enhanced by a body that David X. Cohen and Matt Groening say is based on the shape of a tombstone.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Roberto appears in <em><a href="Bender's_Game" title="wikilink">Bender's Game</a></em> as a patient in the institute for insane robots in which Bender is committed. During a group therapy session, he stabs a robot vending machine, causing it to cough up candy bars. He later appears in the alternate reality as a <a class="uri" href="Denethor" title="wikilink">Denethor</a> equivalent in the <a class="uri" href="Middle-earth" title="wikilink">Middle-earth</a> spoof. He is still insane in this alternate reality, having sent most of his military on a suicide mission against sealife. He briefly becomes sane after he is whacked on the head during a battle, almost immediately he is again hit on the head and becomes insane again. He appears once more in "<a href="Proposition_Infinity" title="wikilink">Proposition Infinity</a>" in the same holding cell that Bender is put in, this time, with a sock instead of his usual knife. He says to Bender, "You ever kill a man with a sock? It ain't so hard," as he makes his usual stabbing noise while stabbing the air around Bender with his sock.</p>

<p>In the Season 7 episode "The Six Million Dollar Mon," Roberto is arrested when he tries to rob <a href="Hermes_Conrad" title="wikilink">Hermes Conrad</a> and his wife LaBarbara of their skin. He is executed for this crime, but Bender later digs him up and steals his brain circuitry so that Hermes can have it installed in his own head to complete his transformation into a robot. When the robot tries to steal the skin from the real Hermes (reassembled by <a href="Doctor_Zoidberg" title="wikilink">Doctor Zoidberg</a> from the discarded body parts), it melts down due to the accumulated residue of heavy spices from LaBarbara's cooking.</p>
<h3 id="robot-devil">Robot Devil</h3>

<p><strong>The Robot Devil</strong> (voiced by <a href="Dan_Castellaneta" title="wikilink">Dan Castellaneta</a> in regular appearances, <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a> in "<a href="A_Tale_of_Two_Santas" title="wikilink">A Tale of Two Santas</a>"), serves as the leader of <a href="Robot_Hell" title="wikilink">Robot Hell</a>, which is hidden beneath the "Inferno" ride at the amusement park "Reckless Ted's Funland" in <a href="New_Jersey" title="wikilink">New Jersey</a>. His function is to torment robots who have committed various sins under the practice of Robotology. If a deal is made with the Robot Devil, he appears to have unlimited power and can grant almost any request. The voice acting of the Robot Devil by Dan Castellaneta has been described as a "<a class="uri" href="bravura" title="wikilink">bravura</a> performance" on his part.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The Robot Devil is available as a build-a-figure from the first three series of <em>Futurama</em> <a href="action_figure" title="wikilink">action figures</a> by <a class="uri" href="Toynami" title="wikilink">Toynami</a>.</p>

<p>He first appears in "<a href="Hell_Is_Other_Robots" title="wikilink">Hell Is Other Robots</a>", kidnapping Bender and tormenting him until Fry and Leela manage to save Bender. He plays another major role in "<a href="The_Devil's_Hands_Are_Idle_Playthings" title="wikilink">The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings</a>", in which Fry makes a <a href="deal_with_the_Devil" title="wikilink">deal with the Devil</a> to improve his holophonor skills. Fry wins the Robot Devil's hands, though the Robot Devil manages to reverse the trade after setting up a complicated scheme to force Fry into relinquishing them. The character also makes brief cameos in "<a href="A_Tale_of_Two_Santas" title="wikilink">A Tale of Two Santas</a>" and "<a href="Crimes_of_the_Hot" title="wikilink">Crimes of the Hot</a>". In the episode "<a href="The_Silence_of_the_Clamps" title="wikilink">The Silence of the Clamps</a>" he is shown as one of the wedding guests. He plays a key role in the Season 6 episode "<a href="Ghost_in_the_Machines" title="wikilink">Ghost in the Machines</a>," offering to reunite Bender's body and spirit if Bender scares Fry to death. This same episode reveals that he keeps several spare bodies in his office and can transfer his spirit to one of these if his body is destroyed.</p>

<p>The Robot Devil appears in the film series on several occasions, most notably <em><a href="Futurama:_The_Beast_with_a_Billion_Backs" title="wikilink">The Beast with a Billion Backs</a></em>, where Bender makes a deal with the Robot Devil exchanging his first-born son for the Armies of Hell. Bender more than happily locates his son and kicks the child into a vat of lava, causing the Robot Devil to comment, "That was pretty brutal, even by my standards." Bender simply replies, "No backsies!" In <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em>, he conducts the band at Lars and Leela's wedding.</p>

<p>In the commentary for "<a href="The_Devil's_Hands_Are_Idle_Playthings" title="wikilink">The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings</a>", Castellaneta says the voice is based on a "bad impression of <a href="Hans_Conried" title="wikilink">Hans Conried</a>."</p>
<h3 id="robot-santa">Robot Santa</h3>

<p><strong>Robot Santa</strong> (voiced by <a href="John_Goodman" title="wikilink">John Goodman</a> in the first appearance, <a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a> in later appearances)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> is a robot created in 2801 by The Friendly Robot Company to judge beings as naughty or nice and distribute presents or punishments accordingly. Due to a programming error, his standards are too high and he judges everyone to be naughty (with the one-time exception of <a href="Dr._Zoidberg" title="wikilink">Dr. Zoidberg</a>). This leads him to go on destructive rampages across Earth every <a class="uri" href="Xmas" title="wikilink">Xmas</a> using Christmas-themed weapons, such as grenades shaped like Christmas ornaments, bicycle guns, and <a href="BGM-71_TOW" title="wikilink">T.O.W. missile</a> launchers (a weaponized retort to <a class="uri" href="mistletoe" title="wikilink">mistletoe</a>) to punish the "naughty" beings. He resides in a death fortress on <a class="uri" href="Neptune" title="wikilink">Neptune</a> along with a number of Neptunians that act as slave labor for the toy factory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> In <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em>, he assisted the Earth's population in reclaiming their planet after it was purchased by the devious Scammers, forcing his Neptunian elves to build weapons for an assault and participating personally in the ensuing battle. He is part of an alliance called The Trinity, a trio of holiday-themed madmen, comprising himself, Kwanzaabot, and the Chanukah Zombie in the song.</p>
<h3 id="barbados-slim">Barbados Slim</h3>

<p><strong>Barbados Slim</strong> (voiced by <a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a>) is Hermes' arch-rival. He not only defeated Hermes at the 3004 Olympics to win the <a href="gold_medal" title="wikilink">gold medal</a> in <a href="limbo_(dance)" title="wikilink">limbo</a>, but is also the only person ever to win gold medals in both limbo and sex. He was formerly married to LaBarbara Conrad, who still refers to him as a "mahogany god." In <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Futurama: Bender's Big Score</a></em>, after Hermes was decapitated in a limboing accident, LaBarbara left him (believing as a head in a jar he would not be able to provide for her) and got back together with Barbados, even going so far as to take his last name (Dwight also took his last name), even though they never re-married and Dwight was never adopted. After Hermes uses his bureaucratic prowess to save Earth from the scammers and wins back LaBarbara (and gets a new body), Slim vows "You have not seen the last of Barbados Slim!" before adding "Now goodbye forever!" As he prepares to leave the bridge, the sliding door malfunctions and goes down halfway. Slim then tries to limbo beneath only for the door to fall and crush his chest.</p>

<h3 id="antonio-calculon">Antonio Calculon</h3>

<p><strong>Calculon</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is an <a href="actor" title="wikilink">acting</a> <a class="uri" href="robot" title="wikilink">robot</a> renowned for his <a href="melodrama" title="wikilink">melodramatic</a> roles and his <a href="Orson_Welles" title="wikilink">Orson Welles</a>-speaking style. His most famous role is as the lead character in the long-running robot <a href="soap_opera" title="wikilink">soap opera</a> <em>All My Circuits</em>, and it is claimed that Calculon received his acting ability from the Robot Devil. Calculon is from the 21st century, having been created as a standard <a href="industrial_robot" title="wikilink">industrial robot</a> called Calculon 1.0. He changes his name and appearance every few decades to conceal his true age, claiming that one of his disguises was <a href="David_Duchovny" title="wikilink">David Duchovny</a>. In the episode "<a href="The_Honking" title="wikilink">The Honking</a>", it is revealed that his first job was as a motorised service arm building the most evil car in existence, Project Satan. Calculon was run over by Project Satan, and became a were-car (the robot equivalent of a <a class="uri" href="werewolf" title="wikilink">werewolf</a>). The curse is broken at the end of the episode, when Project Satan is destroyed. It is revealed in "<a href="Bender_Should_Not_Be_Allowed_on_TV" title="wikilink">Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV</a>" that throughout his entire time on <em>All My Circuits</em>, he has only ever done one take for each scene. In "<a href="Bend_Her" title="wikilink">Bend Her</a>", Calculon begins a relationship with Coilette of Robonia, who is actually Bender after undergoing <a href="gender_reassignment" title="wikilink">gender reassignment</a> to become a Fembot. He becomes smitten with Coilette, who is merely using him for material gain. Calculon proposes to Coilette, who accepts and then decides that she cannot continue the deception, and subsequently fakes her death at their wedding. In the conclusion of the episode, Coilette undergoes surgery to become a Manbot again, and Calculon makes a film in tribute to Coilette. It is shown in <em><a href="Futurama:_The_Beast_With_a_Billion_Backs" title="wikilink">The Beast With A Billion Backs</a></em> that Calculon is the leader of the League of Robots, a robot supremacy society. Bender cheats in a duel with Calculon, resulting in the loss of one of Calculon's arms and the destruction of the league's headquarters. Calculon subsequently becomes outraged at Bender and resigns from the league, relinquishing the presidency to Bender. In <em><a href="Futurama:_Into_The_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into The Wild Green Yonder</a></em>, it is said that his operating system is <a href="Windows_Vista" title="wikilink">Windows Vista</a>. In re-airings of the movie on <a href="Comedy_Central" title="wikilink">Comedy Central</a>, he says his operating system is <a href="Windows_7" title="wikilink">Windows 7</a>.</p>

<p>Calculon dies in "<a href="The_Thief_of_Baghead" title="wikilink">The Thief of Baghead</a>" when he tries to defeat Langdon Cobb in the World Acting Championship after Leela and Bender advise him to do the <em><a href="Romeo_and_Juliet" title="wikilink">Romeo and Juliet</a></em> scene and give him water and food coloring. Unfortunately, food coloring is fatal to robots. Calculon decides the only way to win the award is to actually die and drink the food coloring. After he dies, Cobb wins the award instead of him, making his death pointless.</p>

<p>Bender and Fry decide to revive Calculon after deciding that they do not care for his replacement on <em>All My Circuits</em>, Vaxtron. They journey to Robot Hell and obtain Calculon's soul from the Robot Devil. The Professor has the crew perform a series of ritualistic "scientific" tasks to put the soul of Calculon back in his body. After Calculon is brought back to life he returns to acting. He first performs a one man show. When the show receives poor reviews, Calculon determines that maybe he should not be acting and should have remained in hell. Leela, who opposed Calculon's return to acting, now wants to help him return to <em>All My Circuits</em>. She explains that he should go to an audition in disguise to play Calculon for the show. When he lands the part, Calculon returns to his former ways. Leela then makes him feel bad by saying that he has no acting skills, and that the world had forgotten he had even been alive within the first month of his death. She then explains to Bender and Fry that it was a ploy to save his part in the show. The show crew is smitten by his down-to-earth acting skills, and he reveals himself as Calculon. As he takes a bow, once again thinking that his life is worth living, a massive lighting fixture falls, crushing him. His life as Calculon 2.0 is honored; he watches the ceremony in Robot Hell where his soul resides once more.</p>

<p><strong>Brain Slugs</strong> are small, one-eyed, vaguely sluglike aliens which attach themselves to the heads of sentient beings in order to control them. Brain slugs apparently use this as a method of trapping more "prey", since those beings under brain slug control are driven by the desire to place brain slugs on other beings. It is hinted that the host under the brain slug's control retains awareness of their condition, which Hermes referred to as a "nightmare." The brain slug can be seen in numerous episodes, normally attached to <a href="Hermes_Conrad" title="wikilink">Hermes</a>.

Their main enemies are the Nibblonians, who send Nibbler on a mission to find <a href="Philip_J._Fry" title="wikilink">Fry</a>, the only being resistant to the Brainspawn. Fry lacks the <a href="Delta_wave" title="wikilink">delta brainwave</a>, so he is able to repel the Brainspawn when they attack Earth. Fry later sends the Brainspawn and their space station, the Infosphere, into another dimension with a bomb given to him by the Nibblonians.</p>
<h3 id="cookieville-minimum-security-orphanarium-residents">Cookieville Minimum Security Orphanarium residents</h3>

<p>The Cookieville Minimum Security Orphanarium houses a large number of orphans, including <a href="Leela_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Leela</a> during her childhood. The orphans often suffer harsh conditions and various disappointing setbacks. It is run by Mr. Vogel, voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>, who takes care of the orphans and keeps all records; he is apparently a bureaucrat grade 135 who has not been promoted since about the time Leela was born. Three orphans, Albert, Nina, and Sally, are featured most often. Albert and Nina are voiced by <a href="Kath_Soucie" title="wikilink">Kath Soucie</a> and Sally is voiced by Nicole St. John. Sally has a third ear on her forehead which she is teased about by the other orphans. She also claims to have a <a class="uri" href="tail" title="wikilink">tail</a>. Twelve of the orphans were briefly adopted and later returned by Bender—who adopted them only for the government fund checks—in "<a href="The_Cyber_House_Rules" title="wikilink">The Cyber House Rules</a>".</p>
<h3 id="the-crushinator">The Crushinator</h3>

<p><strong>The Crushinator</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is the robot daughter of a farmer on the moon.

She briefly appears in the background in <em><a href="Futurama:_Into_the_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into the Wild Green Yonder</a></em>. Unlike her sisters, the Crushinator is more machine-like and has a masculine voice. She also has two orange tubes sticking out from her head and can transform into a car.</p>
<h3 id="father-changstein-el-gamal">Father Changstein-El-Gamal</h3>

<p><strong>Father Changstein-El-Gamal</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is a priest in the First Amalgamated Church, a mixture of many 20th century religions. He wears a <a href="Bindi_(decoration)" title="wikilink">bindi</a> on his forehead (<a class="uri" href="Hinduism" title="wikilink">Hinduism</a>), wears a <a class="uri" href="mitre" title="wikilink">mitre</a> and clerical collar (<a class="uri" href="Catholicism" title="wikilink">Catholicism</a>) with a <a class="uri" href="taijitu" title="wikilink">taijitu</a> (or <a class="uri" href="yin-yang" title="wikilink">yin-yang</a>) symbol on the peak (<a class="uri" href="Taoism" title="wikilink">Taoism</a>), <a class="uri" href="payot" title="wikilink">payot</a> (<a class="uri" href="Judaism" title="wikilink">Judaism</a>), an orange wrap (<a class="uri" href="Buddhism" title="wikilink">Buddhism</a>) with a shoulder scarf adorned with stars and moons (<a class="uri" href="spiritism" title="wikilink">spiritism</a>). In <em>Bender's Big Score</em>, he uses the phrases "dearly liked" instead of "dearly beloved" and "We are gathered here today before one or more gods, or fewer..." when officiating a wedding.</p>
<h3 id="flexo">Flexo</h3>

<p><strong>Flexo</strong> (voiced by <a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a>) is a bending robot who looks and sounds almost exactly like <a href="Bender_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Bender</a> with the exception of having a small triangular metal <a class="uri" href="goatee" title="wikilink">goatee</a>, a reference to the <em><a href="Star_Trek" title="wikilink">Star Trek</a></em> <a href="Mirror_Universe_(Star_Trek)" title="wikilink">mirror universe</a>. Flexo first meets and befriends Bender in "<a href="Lesser_of_Two_Evils_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Lesser of Two Evils</a>". Fry believes Flexo to be an "evil twin" of Bender, though it turns out that Flexo attempts to stop Bender from stealing the expensive crown from the Miss Universe pageant. Flexo is mistaken for Bender and is arrested for that crime. Critics have called Flexo's appearance in this episode one of the "Great Moments" in <em>Futurama</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> He returns in "<a href="Bendless_Love" title="wikilink">Bendless Love</a>" in which Bender briefly dates Flexo's ex-wife, Anglelyne, and impersonates Flexo. Flexo is targeted by the Robot Mafia because of this. Eventually, he reunites with Anglelyne. He makes a cameo appearance in <em><a href="Into_The_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into The Wild Green Yonder</a></em> along with Anglelyne as members of the audience seeing the Encyclopod being "born".</p>

<p>He makes another brief appearance in "<a href="Attack_of_the_Killer_App" title="wikilink">Attack of the Killer App</a>" in a garbage bin, where he is found by Bender and tells him that bending robots are now obsolete, though he is ignored. His signature character trait is the way he says something, usually a mild insult, and then immediately retracts it, laughing and saying some variation of "Naw, I'm just kidding... you're all right!" This, apparently, is also reversed when referring to situations or actions that cause him frustration or anger, such as Bender shoving him in one episode, with Flexo responding by saying, "Thanks! I appreciated that... Naw I'm kidding. That was quite annoying."</p>
<h3 id="the-grand-midwife">The Grand Midwife</h3>

<p><strong>The Grand Midwife</strong> (voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>) is an Amphibosian who first appears in the fourth season episode "<a href="Kif_Gets_Knocked_Up_a_Notch" title="wikilink">Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch</a>".

<p><strong>Guenter</strong> (voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a> with the vocal effects provided by <a href="Frank_Welker" title="wikilink">Frank Welker</a>) is an intelligent monkey experiment made by <a href="Professor_Farnsworth" title="wikilink">Professor Farnsworth</a>. His intelligence comes from his small hat which uses sunspots to create cognitive radiation. If he is not wearing the hat, he acts like a normal monkey. His first appearance was in the episode "<a href="Mars_University" title="wikilink">Mars University</a>" in which the Professor enrolls him at the university where he becomes <a href="Philip_J._Fry" title="wikilink">Fry</a>'s roommate. Guenter later appears in the episode, "Fry and Leela's Big Fling", where he shows <a href="Amy_Wong" title="wikilink">Amy Wong</a>, <a href="Bender_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Bender</a> and <a class="uri" href="Zoidberg" title="wikilink">Zoidberg</a> around the planet Simian 7. Guenter is seen in other episodes in the background, and crowds.</p>
<h3 id="gypsy-bot">Gypsy-Bot</h3>

<p><strong>The Gypsy-Bot</strong> (voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>) is a carnival <a href="Fortune_teller_machine" title="wikilink">fortune-telling robot</a>. In "<a class="uri" href="Godfellas" title="wikilink">Godfellas</a>" the gypsy-bot hints that she does not actually have psychic powers; after <a href="Philip_J._Fry" title="wikilink">Fry</a> asks her a question, she replies,"What am I, psychic?". The gypsy-bot appears earlier in "<a href="The_Honking" title="wikilink">The Honking</a>", telling <a href="Bender_(Futurama)" title="wikilink">Bender</a> he is a werecar; and in "<a href="Ghost_in_the_Machines" title="wikilink">Ghost in the Machines</a>," performing a <a class="uri" href="séance" title="wikilink">séance</a> in which Bender's ghost possesses her and causes her head to explode.</p>
<h3 id="headless-body-of-agnew">Headless Body of Agnew</h3>

<p><strong>The Headless Body of Spiro Agnew</strong> joins Nixon as the Vice-President of Earth, imitating his <a href="Spiro_Agnew" title="wikilink">U.S version</a>. Though he is headless, Agnew can still make growling noises. In "<a href="Into_the_Wild_Green_Yonder" title="wikilink">Into the Wild Green Yonder</a>" Agnew is accidentally killed by the 'eco-feministas' (joined by Leela) when a run-away golf cart runs him over. However, he does get cloned, which leads him to be referred to by Nixon as 'The Headless Clone of Agnew'.</p>
<h3 id="horrible-gelatinous-blob">Horrible Gelatinous Blob</h3>

<p><strong>Horrible Gelatinous (H.G.) Blob</strong> (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is a three-eyed, green, translucent, ill-tempered alien. He first appeared on the season one episode "<a href="The_Series_Has_Landed" title="wikilink">The Series Has Landed</a>" in a commercial the Professor made for Planet Express. He contemptuously refers to humanoids as "solids" and ridicules their one-way digestive system. According to the episode <em>The Route of All Evil</em>, the Horrible Gelatinous Blob has a son named <strong>Brett Blob</strong>, who regularly bullies Cubert and Dwight. In <em><a href="Futurama:_Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Futurama: Bender's Big Score</a></em> he, or perhaps a more famous member of his species, is shown to be on the twenty dollar bill.</p>
<h3 id="judge-ron-whitey">Judge Ron Whitey</h3>

<h3 id="kwanzaabot-and-chanukah-zombie">Kwanzaabot and Chanukah Zombie</h3>

<p><strong>Kwanzaabot</strong> and <strong>Chanukah <a class="uri" href="Zombie" title="wikilink">Zombie</a></strong> are Robot Santa's <a class="uri" href="Kwanzaa" title="wikilink">Kwanzaa</a> and <a class="uri" href="Hanukkah" title="wikilink">Hanukkah</a> analogues. Precisely what role they play on their respective holidays is unknown. In the episode "<a href="A_Tale_of_Two_Santas" title="wikilink">A Tale of Two Santas</a>", Kwanzaabot mentions he has been distributing books titled "What the Hell is Kwanza [sic]?" for 647 years, with little effect. Kwanzaabot and Chanukah Zombie are evidently friendly with Robot Santa, as he calls them for support in <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em>, and Kwanzaabot invites Bender to join him and the Chanukah Zombie at the B'nai B'rith in "A Tale of Two Santas".</p>

<p>From his first appearance, Kwanzaabot has been voiced by rapper <a class="uri" href="Coolio" title="wikilink">Coolio</a>. Although Chanukah Zombie had been mentioned, he did not appear onscreen until <em>Bender's Big Score</em>, in which he is voiced by <a href="Mark_Hamill" title="wikilink">Mark Hamill</a> and in a reference to Hamill's famous role in <a href="Star_Wars" title="wikilink">Star Wars</a>, pilots a jewel-encrusted <a href="Tie_Fighter" title="wikilink">TIE Fighter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="malfunctioning-eddie">Malfunctioning Eddie</h3>

<p><strong>Malfunctioning Eddie</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is a robot that runs a hovercar dealership. His character refers to the real life electronics chain <a href="Crazy_Eddie" title="wikilink">Crazy Eddie</a>, and its mascot of the same name. It turned out that Malfunctioning Eddie's prices were so low that he really was insane. He had an exploding-problem associated with surprise in "<a href="Insane_in_the_Mainframe" title="wikilink">Insane in the Mainframe</a>".</p>
<h3 id="michelle">Michelle</h3>

<p><strong>Michelle</strong> (voiced by <a href="Kath_Soucie" title="wikilink">Kath Soucie</a> in the first appearance, <a href="Sarah_Silverman" title="wikilink">Sarah Silverman</a> in the second appearance) is Fry's on and off girlfriend from the 20th century. She dumps Fry shortly before he is frozen New Year's Eve for a man named Constantine (called Charles in "<a href="The_Cryonic_Woman" title="wikilink">The Cryonic Woman</a>", whom she later marries). They eventually split up, and she decides to freeze herself to try again in the distant future. She wakes up in 3002, meets Fry again, and restarts her relationship with him. She fails to fit into the 31st century life to which Fry has become so accustomed, and so asks him to freeze himself with her for another thousand years. This plan fails, as does the rekindled relationship, so Fry leaves her. She later is shown in a limousine with the recently unfrozen <a href="Pauly_Shore" title="wikilink">Pauly Shore</a> and later seen holding his hand in "<a href="Proposition_Infinity" title="wikilink">Proposition Infinity</a>".</p>

<p>In <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em>, it is revealed that Michelle had been frozen roughly 736 years longer than she had actually intended, a result of Fry (as Lars) using her <a href="cryogenics" title="wikilink">cryotube</a> to return to the future and be with Leela. This, along with the fact that Fry had accidentally broken off part of Michelle's hair while climbing into her cryotube, was not mentioned or shown in Michelle's previous appearances. She was one of the many people seen on the date with Yivo in <em>The Beast With a Billion Backs</em>.</p>
<h3 id="nibblonians">Nibblonians</h3>

<p><strong>The Nibblonians</strong> are an ancient race that came into existence 17 years before the moment of the Big Bang. They have extremely long life spans, eat animals whole to fill their stomachs, which are thousands of times larger than themselves, and excrete extremely dense and potent <a href="dark_matter" title="wikilink">dark matter</a>. Despite their nature, other beings find their small stature to be extremely adorable. Their arch-enemy is the Brainspawn. They believe <a href="Philip_J._Fry" title="wikilink">Fry</a> is the only hope of the universe in that he can stop the Brainspawn due to his lack of the Delta <a href="Electroencephalography#Wave_patterns" title="wikilink">brainwave</a>. The main Nibblonians in the series are Nibbler, Ken, voiced by <a href="Billy_West" title="wikilink">Billy West</a>, and Fiona, voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>.</p>
<h3 id="number-nine-man">Number Nine Man</h3>

<p><strong>The Number 9 Man</strong> (or just Number 9 or simply Nine, voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is a cameo character appearing in the first and second production seasons of <em>Futurama</em>.</p>

<p>The Number Nine Man reappeared in <em>Bender's Big Score</em> and <em>Into the Wild Green Yonder</em>, where it was revealed he was the Grand Curator of the Legion of Mad Fellows. When Nine became grand curator is unknown, but the audio commentary track for <em>Into the Wild Green Yonder</em> hints that he was in the Legion prior to the year 3000. As grand curator (which is essentially a knowledgeable leader) of the Legion, he becomes the story teller for Philip J. Fry's mission to possibly end the epic long battle between two ancient races, as they by 3009 have noticed that the Chi have been re-emerging. It is later revealed in "Murder On the Planet Express" that he operates a discount spy store called For Your Eyes Mainly.</p>
<h3 id="mr.-panucci">Mr. Panucci</h3>

<p><strong>Mr. Panucci</strong> (voiced by <a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a>) is the surly Italian-American owner of Panucci's Pizza where Fry worked before getting frozen. Although in the first episode it appears that he does not like Fry that much, it is shown in later episodes that he had a strong friendship with and acted as a <a href="father_figure" title="wikilink">father figure</a> to Fry. It is revealed in <em><a href="Bender's_Big_Score" title="wikilink">Bender's Big Score</a></em> that he likes Fry because Fry's life is so horrible it helps Panucci feel better about himself. Panucci is noticeably upset when Fry goes missing and he takes responsibility for Fry's pet dog Seymour Asses (named as such after Fry feeds the dog pizza delivered because of a prank phone call).</p>

<p>In <em>Bender's Big Score</em>, Fry creates a time paradox by going back in time and living out his old life and thus continues working at Panucci's Pizza. Shortly after he arrives Panucci fires him because he did not get the money from the customer the previous night (since it was a prank call made by Nibbler). Fry asks Panucci if he can live in Panucci's upstairs storeroom, which Panucci allows.</p>
<h3 id="pazuzu">Pazuzu</h3>

<p><strong>Pazuzu</strong> (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is a <a class="uri" href="gargoyle" title="wikilink">gargoyle</a> who Professor Farnsworth owned and put through college. He has a French accent and a son. He initially appears in "<a href="Teenage_Mutant_Leela's_Hurdles" title="wikilink">Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</a>", where he escapes from the Professor. He returns at the end of the episode to rescue the Professor and "earn his freedom." He later appears in <em><a href="Beast_With_a_Billion_Backs" title="wikilink">Beast With a Billion Backs</a></em>, rescuing the Professor and Wernstrom from prison and informing the Professor that he has one wish left.</p>
<h3 id="randy">Randy</h3>

<p><strong>Randy</strong> (voiced by <a href="John_DiMaggio" title="wikilink">John DiMaggio</a>) is the man in pink. He is a stereotypically <a href="homosexuality" title="wikilink">gay</a> man and has an effeminate voice. Originally, he is depicted with blond hair, but sometimes appears with brown hair. John DiMaggio says he is his favorite character to voice. The original design for Randy was very different. He was originally an old man in a mob, with his name in the script for "I, Roommate" literally "Man in Mob". DiMaggio changed the voice and therefore the character.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="reverend-lionel-preacherbot">Reverend Lionel Preacherbot</h3>

<p><strong>Reverend Lionel Preacherbot</strong> (voiced by <a href="Phil_LaMarr" title="wikilink">Phil LaMarr</a>) is a preacher at the Temple of <a class="uri" href="Robotology" title="wikilink">Robotology</a>. He presides over weddings and funerals of robots and humans.

<p>In the episode "<a href="Hell_is_Other_Robots" title="wikilink">Hell is Other Robots</a>" (S01E09), Preacherbot encourages Bender to give up his addiction to recreational electricity (i.e. 'jacking on') in favour of the Church of Robotology, to which Bender replies; "Do I preach to you while you're laying stoned in the gutter?". During the Season 6 episode "<a href="Ghost_in_the_Machines" title="wikilink">Ghost in the Machines</a>," Preacherbot performs an <a class="uri" href="exorcism" title="wikilink">exorcism</a> on the Planet Express headquarters in order to drive off Bender's ghost, which has begun to possess various machinery in an attempt to kill Fry.</p>
<h3 id="sewer-mutants">Sewer mutants</h3>

<p><strong>Sewer mutants</strong> are humans mutated by years of pollution and radioactive waste poured into the sewers under New New York. Because they are considered genetically <a href="Dysgenics" title="wikilink">inferior</a> they were <a href="Genism" title="wikilink">forbidden</a> by law to travel to the surface without special permission (until the events of "<a href="The_Mutants_Are_Revolting" title="wikilink">The Mutants Are Revolting</a>"), so they reside in a community made out of objects flushed down toilets. Among the more prominent mutants in the series are Dwayne, Raoul and Vyolet. Dwayne (voiced by <a href="David_Herman" title="wikilink">David Herman</a>) is a mutant with two noses and a large forehead. Raoul (voiced by <a href="Maurice_LaMarche" title="wikilink">Maurice LaMarche</a>) is the "Supreme Mutant", the democratically elected leader of the sewer mutants. His most notable mutation is a third arm, which in his first appearance had grown in place of his right ear but above it in later appearances. Vyolet (voiced by <a href="Tress_MacNeille" title="wikilink">Tress MacNeille</a>) is a chain-smoking mutant with gills and a pig nose; she seems to be romantically involved with Raoul.</p>
<h3 id="stephen-hawking">Stephen Hawking</h3>

<p><strong><a href="Stephen_Hawking" title="wikilink">Stephen Hawking</a></strong> (voiced by himself) made a guest appearance in the episode "Anthology of Interest I" as a member of the Vice Presidential Action Rangers (VPAR), who guard the <a href="space-time_continuum" title="wikilink">space-time continuum</a>. Along with Hawking at the end of the twentieth century they include <a href="Al_Gore" title="wikilink">Al Gore</a>, <a href="Nichelle_Nichols" title="wikilink">Nichelle Nichols</a>, <a href="Gary_Gygax" title="wikilink">Gary Gygax</a> and their summer intern <a href="Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)" title="wikilink">Deep Blue</a>. He first appears as a customer at the pizzeria where Fry mistakenly believes him to have invented gravity for which Hawking accepts credit ("Yeah, sure. Why not?"). After learning of Fry's inter-dimensional experience, he arranges for him to be kidnapped by the VPAR.</p>

<p>Hawking also appears in <em>The Beast with a Billion Backs</em> as his own head in a flying jar, leading a scientific convention organized to study and discuss a tear in the universe. He says that despite writing a book about it, he has no idea what it is, although he has already cashed the check he got for writing it. Apparently he has the ability to shoot lasers that stun people from his eyes; he himself is surprised, remarking, "I didn't know I could do that" after stunning Professor Farnsworth and Professor Wernstrom.</p>

<p>Due to a debilitating, long-term illness, Hawking is unable to speak with his own larynx, but his computer-assisted speech device is a trademark voice in popular culture.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
