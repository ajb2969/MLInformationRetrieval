   Diaminopimelate dehydrogenase      Diaminopimelate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a diaminopimelate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate + H 2 O + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate + NH 3 + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate , H 2 O , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate , NH 3 , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include meso-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase , and meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
