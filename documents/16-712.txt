   K-trivial set      K-trivial set    In mathematics , a set of natural numbers is called a K-trivial set if its initial segments viewed as binary strings are easy to describe: the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity is as low as possible, close to that of a computable set . Solovay proved in 1975 that a set can be K-trivial without being computable.  The Schnorr–Levin theorem says that random sets have a high initial segment complexity. Thus the K-trivials are far from random. This is why these sets are studied in the field of algorithmic randomness , which is a subfield of Computability theory and related to algorithmic information theory in computer science .  At the same time, K-trivial sets are close to computable. For instance, they are all superlow , i.e. sets whose Turing jump is computable from the Halting problem , and form a Turing ideal , i.e. class of sets closed under Turing join and closed downward under Turing reduction .  Definition  Let K be the prefix-free Kolmogorov Complexity , i.e. given a string x, K(x) outputs the least length of the input string under a prefix-free universal machine . Such a machine, intuitively, represents a universal programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program. For more background of K, see e.g. Chaitin's constant .  We say a set A of the natural numbers is K-trivial via a constant b ∈ ℕ if      ∀  n  K   (  A  ↾  n  )   ≤  K   (  n  )   +  b     fragments  for-all  n  K   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-↾  n  normal-)    K   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)    b    \forall nK(A\upharpoonright n)\leq K(n)+b   .  A set is K-trivial if it is K-trivial via some constant. 1 2  Brief history and development  In the early days of the development of K-triviality, attention was paid to separation of K-trivial sets and computable sets .  Chaitin in his 1976 paper Gregory J. Chaitin (1976),  "Information-Theoretic Characterizations of Recursive Infinite Strings",  Theoretical Computer Science  Volume 2, Issue 1, June 1976, Pages 45–48 mainly studied sets such that there exists b ∈ℕ with      ∀  n  C   (  A  ↾  n  )   ≤  C   (  n  )   +  b     fragments  for-all  n  C   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-↾  n  normal-)    C   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)    b    \forall nC(A\upharpoonright n)\leq C(n)+b     where C denotes the plain Kolmogorov complexity . These sets are known as C-trivial sets. Chaitin showed they coincide with the computable sets. He also showed that the K-trivials are computable in the halting problem . This class of sets is commonly known as    Δ  2  0     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  2   0    \Delta_{2}^{0}   sets in arithmetical hierarchy .  Robert M. Solovay was the first to construct a noncomputable K-trivial set, while construction of a computably enumerable such A was attempted by Calude , Coles 3 and other unpublished constructions by Kummer of a K-trivial, and Muchnik junior of a low for K set.  Developments 1999–2008  In the context of computability theory, a cost function is a computable function       c  :    ℕ  ×  ℕ   →   ℚ    ≥  0      .     normal-:  c   normal-→    ℕ  ℕ    superscript  ℚ    absent  0       c:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q}^{\geq 0}.     For a computable approximation    ⟨   A  s   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  A  s     \langle A_{s}\rangle   of    Δ  2  0     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  2   0    \Delta_{2}^{0}   set A , such a function measures the cost c ( n , s ) of changing the approximation to A(n) at stage s. The first cost function construction was due to Kučera and Terwijn. 4 They built a computably enumerable set that is low for Martin-Löf-randomness but not computable. Their cost function was adaptive, in that the definition of the cost function depends on the computable approximation of the    Δ  2  0     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  2   0    \Delta_{2}^{0}   set being built.  A cost function construction of a K-trivial computably enumerable noncomputable set first appeared in Downey et al. 5  We say a    Δ  2  0     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  2   0    \Delta_{2}^{0}   set A obeys a cost function c if there exists a computable approximation of A,    ⟨    A  s   :   s  ∈  ω    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   subscript  A  s     s  ω      \langle A_{s}:s\in\omega\rangle         K  s    (  x  )    =   min   {    |  σ  |   :     𝕌  s    (  σ  )    =  x    }           subscript  K  s   x      normal-:    σ        subscript  𝕌  s   σ   x       K_{s}(x)=\min\{|\sigma|:\mathbb{U}_{s}(\sigma)=x\}   where    𝕌  s     subscript  𝕌  s    \mathbb{U}_{s}     and   𝕌   𝕌   \mathbb{U}   is the s -th step in a computable approximation of a fixed universal prefix-free machine    P   S  e   :  |   W  e   |  =  ∞  ⇒  ∃  s  ∃  x   [  x  ∈   W   e  ,  s    \   W   e  ,   s  -  1     ∧  x  ∈   A  s   ]      fragments  P   subscript  S  e   normal-:  normal-|   subscript  W  e   normal-|    normal-⇒   s   x   fragments  normal-[  x    subscript  W   e  s    normal-\   subscript  W   e    s  1      x    subscript  A  s   normal-]     PS_{e}:|W_{e}|=\infty\Rightarrow\exists s\exists x[x\in W_{e,s}\backslash W_{e%
 ,s-1}\wedge x\in A_{s}]   .  Sketch of the construction of a non-computable K-trivial set  In fact the set can be made promptly simple . The idea is to meet the prompt simplicity requirements,        lim  x     sup   s  >  x     c   (  x  ,  s  )      =  0        subscript   x     subscript  supremum    s  x      c   x  s      0    \lim_{x}\sup_{s>x}c(x,s)=0     as well as to keep the costs low. We need the cost function to satisfy the limit condition     A   A   A     namely the supremum over stages of the cost for x goes to 0 as x increases. For instance, the standard cost function has this property. The construction essentially waits until the cost is low before putting numbers into    ⟨    A  s   :   s  ∈  ω    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   subscript  A  s     s  ω      \langle A_{s}:s\in\omega\rangle   to meet the promptly simple requirements. We define a computable enumeration     A  0   =  ∅       subscript  A  0      A_{0}=\emptyset   such that      x  ∈    W   e  ,  s    \   W   e  ,   s  -  1          x   normal-\   subscript  W   e  s     subscript  W   e    s  1        x\in W_{e,s}\backslash W_{e,s-1}   . At stage s > 0 , for each e PS_e has not been met yet and there exists x ≥ 2 e such that     c   (  x  ,  s  )    ≤   2   -  e          c   x  s     superscript  2    e      c(x,s)\leq 2^{-e}   and    A  s     subscript  A  s    A_{s}   , then we put x into    P   S  e       P   subscript  S  e     PS_{e}   and declare that       Σ  e    2   -  e     <  ∞   .         subscript  normal-Σ  e    superscript  2    e        \Sigma_{e}2^{-e}<\infty.   is met. End of construction.  To verify that the construction works, note first that A obeys the cost function since at most one number enters A for the sake of each requirement. The sum S is therefore at most      W  e     subscript  W  e    W_{e}     Secondly, each requirement is met: if       ∀   n   K  A    (  n  )     +  b   ≥   K   (  n  )     .         for-all    n   superscript  K  A   n    b     K  n     \forall nK^{A}(n)+b\geq K(n).   is infinite, by the fact that the cost function satisfies the limit condition, some number will eventually be enumerated into A to meet the requirement.  Equivalent characterizations  K-triviality turns out to coincide with some computational lowness notions, saying that a set is close to computable. The following notions capture the same class of sets. 6  Lowness for K  We say that A is low for K if there is b ∈ ℕ such that      K  A     superscript  K  A    K^{A}     Here   A   A   A   is prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity relative to oracle $A$ .  Lowness for Martin-Löf-randomness  A is low for Martin-Löf-randomness 7 if whenever Z is Martin-Löf random , it is already Martin-Löf random relative to A .  Base for Martin-Löf-randomness  A is a base for Martin-Löf-randomness if A is Turing reducible to Z for some set Z that is Martin-Löf random relative to A .  8  More equivalent characterizations of K-triviality have been studied, such as:   Lowness for weakly-2-randomness;  Lowness for difference-left-c.e. reals (notice here no randomness is mentioned).   Developments after 2008  From 2009 on, concepts from analysis entered the stage. This helped solving some notorious problems.  One says that a set Y is a positive density point if every effectively closed class containing Y has positive lower Lebesgue density at Y. Bienvenu Hölzl Miller and Nies 9 showed that a ML-random is Turing incomplete iff it is a positive density point. Day and Miller (2012) 10 used this for an affirmative answer to the ML-cupping problem: 11 A is K-trivial iff for every Martin-Löf random set Z such that A⊕Z compute the halting problem , already Z by itself computes the halting problem .  One says that a set Y is a density-one point if every effectively closed class containing Y has Lebesgue density 1 at Y. Any Martin-Löf random set that is not a density-one point computes every K trivial set by Bienvenu et al. 12 Day and Miller (2012) showed that there is Martin-Löf random set which is a positive density point but not a density one point. Thus there is an incomplete such Martin-Löf random set which computes every K-trivial set. This affirmatively answered the covering problem first asked by Stephan and then published by Miller and Nies. 13 For a summary see L. Bienvenu, A. Day, N. Greenberg, A. Kucera, J. Miller, A. Nies, and D. Turetsky 14 Variants of K-triviality have been studied: Schnorr trivial sets where the machines have domain with computable measure; strongly jump traceable sets , a lowness property of sets far inside K-triviality.
