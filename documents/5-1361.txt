   Convergent series      Convergent series   In mathematics , a series is the sum of the terms of a sequence of numbers.  Given a sequence    {   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  }      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…    \left\{a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},\dots\right\}   , the n th partial sum     S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence, that is,        S  n   =    ∑   k  =  1   n    a  k     .       subscript  S  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  a  k      S_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}.     A series is convergent if the sequence of its partial sums    {   S  1   ,   S  2   ,   S  3   ,  …  }      subscript  S  1    subscript  S  2    subscript  S  3   normal-…    \left\{S_{1},\ S_{2},\ S_{3},\dots\right\}   converges; in other words, it approaches a given number. In more formal language, a series converges if there exists a limit    ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   such that for any arbitrarily small positive number    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   , there is a large integer    N   N   N   such that for all    n  ≥  N      n  N    n\geq\ N   ,        |    S  n   -  ℓ   |   ≤  ε   .           subscript  S  n   normal-ℓ    ε    \left|S_{n}-\ell\right|\leq\ \varepsilon.     Any series that is not convergent is said to be divergent .  Examples of convergent and divergent series   The reciprocals of the positive integers produce a divergent series ( harmonic series ):        1  1   +   1  2   +   1  3   +   1  4   +   1  5   +   1  6   +  ⋯   →  ∞   .     normal-→      1  1     1  2     1  3     1  4     1  5     1  6   normal-⋯      {1\over 1}+{1\over 2}+{1\over 3}+{1\over 4}+{1\over 5}+{1\over 6}+\cdots%
 \rightarrow\infty.     Alternating the signs of the reciprocals of positive integers produces a convergent series:          1  1   -   1  2    +   1  3    -   1  4    +    1  5   ⋯    =   ln   (  2  )                  1  1     1  2      1  3      1  4        1  5   normal-⋯      2     {1\over 1}-{1\over 2}+{1\over 3}-{1\over 4}+{1\over 5}\cdots=\ln(2)     The reciprocals of prime numbers produce a divergent series (so the set of primes is " large "):        1  2   +   1  3   +   1  5   +   1  7   +   1  11   +   1  13   +  ⋯   →  ∞   .     normal-→      1  2     1  3     1  5     1  7     1  11     1  13   normal-⋯      {1\over 2}+{1\over 3}+{1\over 5}+{1\over 7}+{1\over 11}+{1\over 13}+\cdots%
 \rightarrow\infty.     The reciprocals of triangular numbers produce a convergent series:       1  1   +   1  3   +   1  6   +   1  10   +   1  15   +   1  21   +  ⋯   =  2.          1  1     1  3     1  6     1  10     1  15     1  21   normal-⋯   2.    {1\over 1}+{1\over 3}+{1\over 6}+{1\over 10}+{1\over 15}+{1\over 21}+\cdots=2.     The reciprocals of factorials produce a convergent series (see e ):        1  1   +   1  1   +   1  2   +   1  6   +   1  24   +   1  120   +  ⋯   =  e   .          1  1     1  1     1  2     1  6     1  24     1  120   normal-⋯   e    \frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{24}+\frac{1}{120}+%
 \cdots=e.     The reciprocals of square numbers produce a convergent series (the Basel problem ):        1  1   +   1  4   +   1  9   +   1  16   +   1  25   +   1  36   +  ⋯   =    π  2   6    .          1  1     1  4     1  9     1  16     1  25     1  36   normal-⋯      superscript  π  2   6     {1\over 1}+{1\over 4}+{1\over 9}+{1\over 16}+{1\over 25}+{1\over 36}+\cdots={%
 \pi^{2}\over 6}.     The reciprocals of powers of 2 produce a convergent series (so the set of powers of 2 is " small "):       1  1   +   1  2   +   1  4   +   1  8   +   1  16   +   1  32   +  ⋯   =  2.          1  1     1  2     1  4     1  8     1  16     1  32   normal-⋯   2.    {1\over 1}+{1\over 2}+{1\over 4}+{1\over 8}+{1\over 16}+{1\over 32}+\cdots=2.     Alternating the signs of reciprocals of powers of 2 also produces a convergent series:             1  1   -   1  2    +   1  4    -   1  8    +   1  16    -   1  32    +  ⋯   =   2  3    .                    1  1     1  2      1  4      1  8      1  16      1  32    normal-⋯     2  3     {1\over 1}-{1\over 2}+{1\over 4}-{1\over 8}+{1\over 16}-{1\over 32}+\cdots={2%
 \over 3}.     The reciprocals of Fibonacci numbers produce a convergent series (see ψ ):        1  1   +   1  1   +   1  2   +   1  3   +   1  5   +   1  8   +  ⋯   =  ψ   .          1  1     1  1     1  2     1  3     1  5     1  8   normal-⋯   ψ    \frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{8}+\cdots%
 =\psi.      Convergence tests  There are a number of methods of determining whether a series converges or diverges . Comparison test . The terms of the sequence    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \left\{a_{n}\right\}   are compared to those of another sequence    {   b  n   }      subscript  b  n     \left\{b_{n}\right\}   . If,  for all n ,    0  ≤   a  n   ≤   b  n         0   subscript  a  n         subscript  b  n      0\leq\ a_{n}\leq\ b_{n}   , and     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    b  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  b  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}   converges, then so does      ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n    .      superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}.     However, if,  for all n ,    0  ≤   b  n   ≤   a  n         0   subscript  b  n         subscript  a  n      0\leq\ b_{n}\leq\ a_{n}   , and     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    b  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  b  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}   diverges, then so does      ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n    .      superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}.     Ratio test . Assume that for all n ,     a  n   >  0       subscript  a  n   0    a_{n}>0   . Suppose that there exists   r   r   r   such that         lim   n  →  ∞     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |    =  r   .        subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n      r    \lim_{n\to\infty}\left|{\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}}\right|=r.     If r 1,}} then the series diverges. If  the ratio test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.  Root test or ''' n th root test'''. Suppose that the terms of the sequence in question are non-negative . Define r as follows:       r  =    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   a  n   |   n     ,      r    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        n      subscript  a  n        r=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{|a_{n}|},      where "lim sup" denotes the limit superior (possibly ∞; if the limit exists it is the same value).   If r 1,}} then the series diverges. If  the root test is inconclusive, and the series may converge or diverge.  The ratio test and the root test are both based on comparison with a geometric series, and as such they work in similar situations. In fact, if the ratio test works (meaning that the limit exists and is not equal to 1) then so does the root test; the converse, however, is not true. The root test is therefore more generally applicable, but as a practical matter the limit is often difficult to compute for commonly seen types of series.  Integral test . The series can be compared to an integral to establish convergence or divergence. Let     f   (  n  )    =   a  n         f  n    subscript  a  n     f(n)=a_{n}   be a positive and monotone decreasing function . If         ∫  1  ∞    f   (  x  )   d  x    =    lim   t  →  ∞      ∫  1  t    f   (  x  )   d  x     <  ∞   ,          superscript   subscript   1       f  x  d  x      subscript    normal-→  t       superscript   subscript   1   t     f  x  d  x              \int_{1}^{\infty}f(x)\,dx=\lim_{t\to\infty}\int_{1}^{t}f(x)\,dx<\infty,     then the series converges. But if the integral diverges, then the series does so as well.  Limit comparison test . If      {   a  n   }   ,   {   b  n   }    >  0         subscript  a  n      subscript  b  n     0    \left\{a_{n}\right\},\left\{b_{n}\right\}>0   , and the limit     lim   n  →  ∞      a  n    b  n        subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n      \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}   exists and is not zero, then     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   converges if and only if      ∑   n  =  1   ∞    b  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  b  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}   converges.  Alternating series test . Also known as the Leibniz criterion , the alternating series test states that for an alternating series of the form     ∑   n  =  1   ∞     a  n     (   -  1   )   n        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n    superscript    1   n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}(-1)^{n}   , if    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \left\{a_{n}\right\}   is monotone decreasing , and has a limit of 0 at infinity, then the series converges.  Cauchy condensation test . If    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \left\{a_{n}\right\}   is a positive monotone decreasing sequence, then     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   converges if and only if     ∑   k  =  1   ∞     2  k    a   2  k         superscript   subscript     k  1         superscript  2  k    subscript  a   superscript  2  k       \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}2^{k}a_{2^{k}}   converges.  Dirichlet's test  Abel's test  Raabe's test  Conditional and absolute convergence  (Figure)  Illustration of the absolute convergence of the power series of Exp[ z ] around 0 evaluated at . The length of the line is finite.   (Figure)  Illustration of the conditional convergence of the power series of log( z +1) around 0 evaluated at  The length of the line is infinite.   For any sequence    {   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  …  }      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…    \left\{a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},\dots\right\}   ,     a  n   ≤   |   a  n   |        subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n      a_{n}\leq\ \left|a_{n}\right|   for all n. Therefore,         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n    ≤    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   a  n   |     .        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n      superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\leq\ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|.     This means that if     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   a  n   |       superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|   converges, then     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   also converges (but not vice versa).  If the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   a  n   |       superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|   converges, then the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   is absolutely convergent . An absolutely convergent sequence is one in which the length of the line created by joining together all of the increments to the partial sum is finitely long. The power series of the exponential function is absolutely convergent everywhere.  If the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   converges but the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    |   a  n   |       superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|   diverges, then the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   is conditionally convergent . The path formed by connecting the partial sums of a conditionally convergent series is infinitely long. The power series of the logarithm is conditionally convergent.  The Riemann series theorem states that if a series converges conditionally, it is possible to rearrange the terms of the series in such a way that the series converges to any value, or even diverges.  Uniform convergence  Let    {   f  1   ,   f  2   ,   f  3   ,  …  }      subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    subscript  f  3   normal-…    \left\{f_{1},\ f_{2},\ f_{3},\dots\right\}   be a sequence of functions. The series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    f  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  f  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_{n}   is said to converge uniformly to f if the sequence    {   s  n   }      subscript  s  n     \{s_{n}\}   of partial sums defined by        s  n    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   n     f  k    (  x  )            subscript  s  n   x     superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  f  k   x      s_{n}(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}f_{k}(x)     converges uniformly to f .  There is an analogue of the comparison test for infinite series of functions called the Weierstrass M-test .  Cauchy convergence criterion  The Cauchy convergence criterion states that a series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n       superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}   converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums is a Cauchy sequence . This means that for every     ε  >  0   ,      ε  0    \varepsilon>0,   there is a positive integer   N   N   N   such that for all    n  ≥  m  ≥  N        n  m       N     n\geq m\geq N   we have        |    ∑   k  =  m   n    a  k    |   <  ε   ,          superscript   subscript     k  m    n    subscript  a  k     ε    \left|\sum_{k=m}^{n}a_{k}\right|<\varepsilon,   which is equivalent to        lim       n  →  ∞        m  →  ∞          ∑   k  =  n    n  +  m     a  k     =  0.        subscript    STACKED   normal-→  n     normal-→  m        superscript   subscript     k  n      n  m     subscript  a  k     0.    \lim_{n\to\infty\atop m\to\infty}\sum_{k=n}^{n+m}a_{k}=0.
