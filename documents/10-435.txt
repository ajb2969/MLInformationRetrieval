Chapman–Robbins bound

In statistics, the Chapman–Robbins bound or Hammersley–Chapman–Robbins bound is a lower bound on the variance of estimators of a deterministic parameter. It is a generalization of the Cramér–Rao bound; compared to the Cramér–Rao bound, it is both tighter and applicable to a wider range of problems. However, it is usually more difficult to compute.
The bound was independently discovered by John Hammersley in 1950,1 and by Douglas Chapman and Herbert Robbins in 1951.2
Statement
Let  be an unknown, deterministic parameter, and let  be a random variable, interpreted as a measurement of θ. Suppose the probability density function of X is given by p(x; θ). It is assumed that p(x; θ) is well-defined and that  for all values of x and θ.
Suppose δ(X) is an unbiased estimate of an arbitrary scalar function  of θ, i.e.,



The Chapman–Robbins bound then states that

Relation to Cramér–Rao bound
The Chapman–Robbins bound converges to the Cramér–Rao bound when , assuming the regularity conditions of the Cramér–Rao bound hold. This implies that, when both bounds exist, the Chapman–Robbins version is always at least as tight as the Cramér–Rao bound; in many cases, it is substantially tighter.
The Chapman–Robbins bound also holds under much weaker regularity conditions. For example, no assumption is made regarding differentiability of the probability density function p(x; θ). When p(x; θ) is non-differentiable, the Fisher information is not defined, and hence the Cramér–Rao bound does not exist.
