   NDP-glucose—starch glucosyltransferase      NDP-glucose—starch glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a NDP-glucose—starch glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NDP-glucose + (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NDP + (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NDP-glucose and (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n , whereas its two products are NDP and (1,4-alpha-D-glucosyl)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NDP-glucose:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include granule-bound starch synthase , starch synthase II (ambiguous) , waxy protein , starch granule-bound nucleoside diphosphate glucose-starch , glucosyltransferase , granule-bound starch synthase I , GBSSI , granule-bound starch synthase II , GBSSII , GBSS , and NDPglucose-starch glucosyltransferase .
