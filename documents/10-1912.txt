2-dehydro-3-deoxyglucarate aldolase

In enzymology, a 2-dehydro-3-deoxyglucarate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-glucarate 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + tartronate semialdehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-glucarate, and two products, pyruvate and tartronate semialdehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-glucarate tartronate-semialdehyde-lyase (pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxyglucarate aldolase, alpha-keto-beta-deoxy-D-glucarate aldolase, and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-glucarate tartronate-semialdehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
