5'-nucleotidase

5'-nucleotidase (, uridine 5'-nucleotidase, 5'-adenylic phosphatase, adenosine 5'-phosphatase, AMP phosphatase, adenosine monophosphatase, 5'-mononucleotidase, AMPase, UMPase, snake venom 5'-nucleotidase, thimidine monophosphate nucleotidase, 5'-AMPase, 5'-AMP nucleotidase, AMP phosphohydrolase, IMP 5'-nucleotidase) is an enzyme with system name 5'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a 5'-ribonucleotide + H2O 
 
 
 
  a ribonucleoside + phosphate


This enzyme has a wide specificity for 5'-nucleotides.
