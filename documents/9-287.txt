   Misner space      Misner space   Misner space is an abstract mathematical spacetime , discovered by Charles Misner of the University of Maryland . It is also known as the Lorentzian  orbifold       ℝ   1  ,  1    /  b   o  o  s  t         superscript  ℝ   1  1    b   o  o  s  t    \mathbb{R}^{1,1}/boost   .  An intuitive analogy may be drawn with a video game screen, where a screen element exits the frame through the right side, only to re-enter the frame right away through the left side.  Moving the spatial limits (e.g.: the walls of a room) enclosing an existing Misner space in the physical world, could theoretically lead to time travel .  References   M. Berkooz, B. Pioline, M.
