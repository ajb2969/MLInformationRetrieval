Estimation lemma

In mathematics the estimation lemma, also known as the M-L inequality, gives an upper bound for a contour integral. If 
 
 
 
  is a complex-valued, continuous function on the contour 
 
 
 
  and if its absolute value

 
  is bounded by a constant 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the arc length of 
 
 
 
 . In particular, we may take the maximum



as upper bound. Intuitively, the lemma is very simple to understand. If a contour is thought of as many smaller contour segments connected together, then there will be a maximum 
 
 
 
  for each segment. Out of all the maximum 
 
 
 
 s for the segments, there will be an overall largest one. Hence, if the overall largest 
 
 
 
  is summed over the entire path then the integral of 
 
 
 
  over the path must be less than or equal to it.
Formally, the inequality can be shown to hold using the definition of contour integral, the absolute value inequality for integrals and the formula for the length of a curve as follows:



The estimation lemma is most commonly used as part of the methods of contour integration with the intent to show that the integral over part of a contour goes to zero as 
 
 
 
 
  goes to infinity. An example of such a case is shown below.
Example
 Problem. Find an upper bound for



where 
 
 
 
  is the upper half-circle

 
  with radius

 
  traversed once in the counterclockwise direction.
Solution. First observe that the length of the path of integration is half the circumference of a circle with radius 
 
 
 
 
 , hence


 
  Next we seek an upper bound 
 
 
 
  for the integrand when 
 
 
 
 . By the triangle inequality we see that


 
  therefore


 
  because 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Hence


 
  Therefore we apply the estimation lemma with  1 / (a2 − 1)2}}. The resulting bound is
