   Conjugate transpose      Conjugate transpose   In mathematics , the conjugate transpose or Hermitian transpose of an m -by- n  matrix     A   A   A    with complex entries is the n -by- m matrix    A   A   A    * obtained from    A   A   A    by taking the transpose and then taking the complex conjugate of each entry (i.e., negating their imaginary parts but not their real parts). The conjugate transpose is formally defined by        (   𝑨  *   )    i  j    =    𝑨   j  i    ¯        subscript   superscript  𝑨      i  j     normal-¯   subscript  𝑨    j  i       (\boldsymbol{A}^{*})_{ij}=\overline{\boldsymbol{A}_{ji}}   where the subscripts denote the i , j -th entry, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m , and the overbar denotes a scalar complex conjugate . (The complex conjugate of    a  +   b  i       a    b  i     a+bi   , where a and b are reals, is    a  -   b  i       a    b  i     a-bi   .)  This definition can also be written as       𝑨  *   =    (   𝑨  ¯   )   T   =    𝑨  T   ¯          superscript  𝑨     superscript   normal-¯  𝑨   normal-T         normal-¯   superscript  𝑨  normal-T       \boldsymbol{A}^{*}=(\overline{\boldsymbol{A}})^{\mathrm{T}}=\overline{%
 \boldsymbol{A}^{\mathrm{T}}}   where    𝑨  T     superscript  𝑨  normal-T    \boldsymbol{A}^{\mathrm{T}}\,\!   denotes the transpose and    𝑨  ¯     normal-¯  𝑨    \overline{\boldsymbol{A}}\,\!   denotes the matrix with complex conjugated entries.  Other names for the conjugate transpose of a matrix are Hermitian conjugate , bedaggered matrix , adjoint matrix or transjugate . The conjugate transpose of a matrix    A   A   A    can be denoted by any of these symbols:       𝑨  *     superscript  𝑨     \boldsymbol{A}^{*}\,\!   or    𝑨  H     superscript  𝑨  normal-H    \boldsymbol{A}^{\mathrm{H}}\,\!   , commonly used in linear algebra      𝑨  †     superscript  𝑨  normal-†    \boldsymbol{A}^{\dagger}\,\!   (sometimes pronounced as "    A   A   A     dagger "), universally used in quantum mechanics      𝑨  +     superscript  𝑨     \boldsymbol{A}^{+}\,\!   , although this symbol is more commonly used for the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse   In some contexts,    𝑨  *     superscript  𝑨     \boldsymbol{A}^{*}\,\!   denotes the matrix with complex conjugated entries, and the conjugate transpose is then denoted by    𝑨    *  T      superscript  𝑨    absent  normal-T     \boldsymbol{A}^{*\mathrm{T}}\,\!   or    𝑨   T  *      superscript  𝑨   normal-T      \boldsymbol{A}^{\mathrm{T}*}\,\!   .  Example  If      𝑨  =   [     1      -  2   -  i        1  +  i     i     ]       𝑨    1      2   i       1  i   i      \boldsymbol{A}=\begin{bmatrix}1&-2-i\\
 1+i&i\end{bmatrix}   then       𝑨  *   =   [     1     1  -  i         -  2   +  i      -  i      ]        superscript  𝑨      1    1  i         2   i     i       \boldsymbol{A}^{*}=\begin{bmatrix}1&1-i\\
 -2+i&-i\end{bmatrix}     Basic remarks  A square matrix   A   A   A   with entries    a   i  j      subscript  a    i  j     a_{ij}   is called   Hermitian or self-adjoint if , i.e.,     a   i  j    =    a   j  i    ¯        subscript  a    i  j     normal-¯   subscript  a    j  i       a_{ij}=\overline{a_{ji}}   .  skew Hermitian or antihermitian if , i.e.,     a   i  j    =   -    a   j  i    ¯         subscript  a    i  j       normal-¯   subscript  a    j  i        a_{ij}=-\overline{a_{ji}}   .  normal if .  unitary if .   Even if   A   A   A   is not square, the two matrices and are both Hermitian and in fact positive semi-definite matrices .  The conjugate transpose "adjoint" matrix should not be confused with the adjugate     a  d  j   (  A  )       a  d  j  A    adj(A)   , which is also sometimes called "adjoint".  Finding the conjugate transpose of a matrix   A   A   A   with real entries reduces to finding the transpose of   A   A   A   , as the conjugate of a real number is the number itself.  Motivation  The conjugate transpose can be motivated by noting that complex numbers can be usefully represented by 2×2 real matrices, obeying matrix addition and multiplication:        a  +   i  b    ≡   (     a     -  b       b    a     )    .        a    i  b      a    b     b  a      a+ib\equiv\left(\begin{matrix}a&-b\\
 b&a\end{matrix}\right).     That is, denoting each complex number z by the real 2×2 matrix of the linear transformation on the Argand diagram (viewed as the real vector space    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   ) affected by complex z -multiplication on   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   .  An m -by- n matrix of complex numbers could therefore equally well be represented by a 2m -by- 2n matrix of real numbers. The conjugate transpose therefore arises very naturally as the result of simply transposing such a matrix, when viewed back again as n -by- m matrix made up of complex numbers.

Here,    ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   denotes the standard complex inner product on    ℂ  m     superscript  ℂ  m    \mathbb{C}^{m}   and    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   .   Generalizations  The last property given above shows that if one views   A   A   A   as a linear transformation from Euclidean Hilbert space  to , then the matrix corresponds to the adjoint operator of   A   A   A   . The concept of adjoint operators between Hilbert spaces can thus be seen as a generalization of the conjugate transpose of matrices with respect to an orthonormal basis.  Another generalization is available: suppose   A   A   A   is a linear map from a complex vector space    V   V   V   to another,   W   W   W   , then the complex conjugate linear map as well as the transposed linear map are defined, and we may thus take the conjugate transpose of   A   A   A   to be the complex conjugate of the transpose of   A   A   A   . It maps the conjugate dual of   W   W   W   to the conjugate dual of   V   V   V   .
