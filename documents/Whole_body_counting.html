<h1>Whole body counting</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="health_physics" title="wikilink">health physics</a>, <strong>whole-body counting</strong> refers to the measurement of <a class="uri" href="radioactivity" title="wikilink">radioactivity</a> <em>within</em> the human body. The technique is primarily applicable to radioactive material that emits <a href="Gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma</a> rays. <a href="Alpha_particle" title="wikilink">Alpha particle</a> decays can also be detected indirectly by their coincident gamma radiation. In certain circumstances, <a href="Beta_ray" title="wikilink">beta</a> emitters can be measured, but with degraded sensitivity.</p>

<p>This must not be confused with whole body <strong>personnel exit monitoring</strong>, which is the term used in <a href="Radiation_protection" title="wikilink">Radiation protection</a> for checking of external contamination of a whole body leaving a contamination controlled area. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<p>If a gamma ray is emitted from a radioactive element within the human body due to <a href="radioactive_decay" title="wikilink">radioactive decay</a>, and its energy is sufficient to escape then it can be detected. This would be by means of either a <a href="scintillation_detector" title="wikilink">scintillation detector</a> or a <a href="semiconductor_detector" title="wikilink">semiconductor detector</a>, placed in close proximity to the body. Radioactive decay may give rise to gamma radiation which cannot escape the body due to being absorbed or other interaction whereby it can lose energy; so account must be taken of this in any measurement analysis.</p>

<p>There are many ways a person can be positioned for this measurement: sitting, lying, standing. The detectors can be single or multiple and can either be stationary or moving.</p>

<p>The advantages of whole body counting are that it measures body contents directly, does not rely on indirect methods (such as <a class="uri" href="urinalysis" title="wikilink">urinalysis</a>) and that it can measure insoluble radionuclides in the lungs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, disadvantages of whole body counting are that it can only be used for gamma emitters, except in special circumstances, and it can misinterpret external contamination as an internal contamination. On its own, it may be unable to distinguish between radioisotopes that have similar gamma energies. Alpha and beta radiation is largely shielded by the body and will not be detected externally, but the coincident gamma from alpha decay may be detected, as well as radiation from the parent or daughter nuclides.</p>

<h2 id="calibration">Calibration</h2>

<p>Any radiation detector is a relative instrument, that is to say the measurement value can only be converted to an amount of material present by comparing the response signal (usually counts per minute, or per second) to the signal obtained from a standard whose quantity (activity) is well known.</p>

<p>A whole body counter is calibrated with a device known as a "phantom" containing a known distribution and known activity of radioactive material. The accepted <a href="http://hps.org/hpssc/N13_35_1999.html">industry standard</a> is the Bottle Manikin Absorber phantom (BOMAB). The BOMAB phantom consists of 10 high density polyethylene containers and is used to calibrate <em>in vivo</em> counting systems that are designed to measure the radionuclides that emit high energy photons (200 keV 200 keV) at levels far below that which would cause adverse health effects in people. A typical detection limit for radioactive caesium (<a href="Caesium-137" title="wikilink">Cs-137</a>) is about 40 Bq. The Annual Limit on Intake (i.e., the amount that would give a person a dose equal to the worker limit that is 20 mSv) is about 2,000,000 Bq. The amount of naturally occurring radioactive potassium present in all humans is also easily detectable.</p>

<p>The reason that these instruments are so sensitive is that they are often housed in low background counting chambers. Typically this is a small room with very thick walls made of <a href="low-background_steel" title="wikilink">low-background steel</a> (~20 cm) and sometimes lined with a thin layer of lead (~1 cm). This shielding can reduce <a href="background_radiation" title="wikilink">background radiation</a> inside the chamber by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<h2 id="count-times-and-detection-limit">Count times and detection limit</h2>

<p>Depending on the counting geometry of the system, count times can be from 1 minute to about 30 minutes. The sensitivity of a counter does depend on counting time so the longer the count, for the same system, the better the <a href="detection_limit" title="wikilink">detection limit</a>. The detection limit, often referred to as the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA), is given by the formula:</p>

 ...where N is the number of counts of background in the region of interest; E is the counting efficiency; and T is the counting time.</p>

<p>This quantity is approximately twice the Decision Limit, another statistical quantity, that can be used to decide if there is any activity present. (i.e., a trigger point for more analysis).</p>
