Carboxybiotin decarboxylase

Carboxybiotin decarboxylase (, MadB, carboxybiotin protein decarboxylase) is an enzyme with system name carboxybiotinyl-(protein) carboxy-lyase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a carboxybiotinyl-[protein] + n Na+in + H+out

 
  CO2 + a biotinyl-[protein] + n Na+out (n = 1--2)
 

This enzyme is an integral membrane protein MadB from the anaerobic bacterium Malonomonas rubra.
