   Du Noüy ring method      Du Noüy ring method   The du Noüy ring method is one technique by which the surface tension of a liquid can be measured. The method involves slowly lifting a ring, often made of platinum, from the surface of a liquid. The force,   F   F   F   , required to raise the ring from the liquid's surface is measured and related to the liquid's surface tension,   γ   γ   \gamma   :      F  =    2  π   ⋅   (    r  i   +   r  a    )   ⋅  γ       F   normal-⋅    2  π      subscript  r  i    subscript  r  a    γ     F=2\pi\cdot(r_{i}+r_{a})\cdot\gamma     where    r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}   is the radius of the inner ring of the liquid film pulled and    r  a     subscript  r  a    r_{a}   is the radius of the outer ring of the liquid film. 1  This technique was proposed by the French physicist Pierre Lecomte du Noüy (1883–1947) in a paper published in 1925. 2  See also   Sessile drop technique  Tensiometer (surface tension)  Wilhelmy plate   References    External links   Papers of Pierre Lecomte du Noüy, 1883-1972  Movie showing a du Noüy tensiometer  Picture of a du Noüy tensiometer (National Institutes of Health)   "  Category:Measuring instruments  Category:Laboratory equipment     ↩  ↩
