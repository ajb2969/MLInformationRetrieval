   Glycerol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate 2-phosphodiesterase      Glycerol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate 2-phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a glycerol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate 2-phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycerol 1,2-cyclic phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerol 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycerol 1,2-cyclic phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is glycerol 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is rac-glycerol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate 2-glycerophosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called rac-glycerol 1:2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphodiesterase .
