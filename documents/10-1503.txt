   L-glutamate oxidase      L-glutamate oxidase   In enzymology , a L-glutamate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamate + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutarate + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamate , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxoglutarate , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include glutamate (acceptor) dehydrogenase , glutamate oxidase , glutamic acid oxidase , glutamic dehydrogenase (acceptor) , and L-glutamic acid oxidase . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References     "  Category:EC 1.4.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
