   Hausdorff maximal principle      Hausdorff maximal principle   In mathematics , the Hausdorff maximal principle is an alternate and earlier formulation of Zorn's lemma proved by Felix Hausdorff in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any partially ordered set , every totally ordered  subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.  The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the axiom of choice over ZF ( Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the Hausdorff maximality theorem or the Kuratowski lemma (Kelley 1955:33).  Statement  The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any partially ordered set , every totally ordered  subset is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.  An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.  To prove that it follows from the original form, let A be a poset . Then   ∅     \varnothing   is a totally ordered subset of A , hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing   ∅     \varnothing   , in particular A contains a maximal totally ordered subset.  For the converse direction, let A be a partially ordered set and T a totally ordered subset of A . Then      {  S  ∣   T  ⊆  S  ⊆   A  and S totally ordered    }     conditional-set  S      T  S         A  and S totally ordered       \{S\mid T\subseteq S\subseteq A\mbox{ and S totally ordered}\}   is partially ordered by set inclusion   ⊆     \subseteq   , therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset P . Then the set    M  =   ⋃  P       M    P     M=\bigcup P   satisfies the desired properties.  The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.  References   John Kelley (1955), General topology , Von Nostrand.
