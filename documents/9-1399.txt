Automorphic factor

In mathematics, an automorphic factor is a certain type of analytic function, defined on subgroups of SL(2,R), appearing in the theory of modular forms. The general case, for general groups, is reviewed in the article 'factor of automorphy'.
Definition
An automorphic factor of weight k is a function


 
  satisfying the four properties given below. Here, the notation 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  refer to the upper half-plane and the complex plane, respectively. The notation 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of SL(2,R), such as, for example, a Fuchsian group. An element 
 
 
 
  is a 2x2 matrix



with a, b, c, d real numbers, satisfying adâˆ’bc=1.
An automorphic factor must satisfy:

1. For a fixed 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is a holomorphic function of 
 
 
 
 .
 


2. For all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , one has
 
 



for a fixed real number k.
 


3. For all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , one has
 










Here, 
 
 
 
  is the fractional linear transform of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 .
 


4.If 
 
 
 
 , then for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , one has
 










Here, I denotes the identity matrix.
 

Properties
Every automorphic factor may be written as



with



The function 
 
 
 
  is called a multiplier system. Clearly,


 
 , while, if 
 
 
 
 , then
