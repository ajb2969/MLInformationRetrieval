Regulated rewriting

Regulated rewriting is a specific area of formal languages studying grammatical systems which are able to take some kind of control over the production applied in a derivation step. For this reason, the grammatical systems studied in Regulated Rewriting theory are also called "Grammars with Controlled Derivations". Among such grammars can be noticed:
Matrix Grammars
Basic concepts
Definition
 A Matrix Grammar, 
 
 
 
 , is a four-tuple 
 
 
 
  where
 1.- 
 
 
 
  is an alphabet of non-terminal symbols
 2.- 
 
 
 
  is an alphabet of terminal symbols disjoint with 
 
 

 3.- 
 
 
 
  is a finite set of matrices, which are non-empty sequences 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , where each 
 
 
 
 , is an ordered pair 
 
 
 
  being 
 
 
 
  these pairs are called "productions", and are denoted 
 
 
 
 . In these conditions the matrices can be written down as 
 
 

 4.- S is the start symbol
Definition
 Let 
 
 
 
  be a matrix grammar and let 
 
 
 
  the collection of all productions on matrices of 
 
 
 
 . We said that 
 
 
 
  is of type i according to Chomsky's hierarchy with 
 
 
 
 , or "increasing length" or "linear" or "without 
 
 
 
 -productions" if and only if the grammar 
 
 
 
  has the corresponding property.
The classic example

Note: taken from Abraham 1965, with change of nonterminals names


The context-sensitive language 
 
 
 
  is generated by the 
 
 

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the non-terminal set, 
 
 
 
  is the terminal set, and the set of matrices is defined as 
 
 

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Time Variant Grammars
Basic concepts
Definition
 A Time Variant Grammar is a pair 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a grammar and 
 
 
 
  is a function from the set of natural numbers to the class of subsets of the set of productions.
Programmed Grammars
Basic concepts
Definition
A Programmed Grammar is a pair 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a grammar and 
 
 
 
  are the success and fail functions from the set of productions to the class of subsets of the set of productions.
Grammars with regular control language
Basic concepts
Definition
 A Grammar With Regular Control Language, 
 
 
 
 , is a pair 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a grammar and 
 
 
 
  is a regular expression over the alphabet of the set of productions.
A naive example
Consider the CFG 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the non-terminal set, 
 
 
 
  is the terminal set, and the productions set is defined as 
 
 
 
  being 
 
 

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Clearly, 
 
 
 
 . Now, considering the productions set 
 
 
 
  as an alphabet (since it is a finite set), define the regular expression over 
 
 
 
 : 
 
 
 
 .
Combining the CFG grammar 
 
 
 
  and the regular expression 
 
 
 
 , we obtain the CFGWRCL 
 
 
 
  which generates the language 
 
 
 
 .
Besides there are other grammars with regulated rewriting, the four cited above are good examples of how to extend context-free grammars with some kind of control mechanism to obtain a Turing machine powerful grammatical device.
