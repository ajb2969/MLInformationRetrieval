   Local time (mathematics)      Local time (mathematics)   (Figure)  A sample path of an Itō process together with its surface of local times.   In the mathematical theory of stochastic processes , local time is a stochastic process associated with diffusion processes such as Brownian motion , that characterizes the amount of time a particle has spent at a given level. Local time appears in various stochastic integration formulas, such as Tanaka's formula , if the integrand is not sufficiently smooth. It is also studied in statistical mechanics in the context of random fields .  Formal definition  For a diffusion process     (   b  s   )    s  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  b  s     s  0     (b_{s})_{s\geq 0}   , the local time of   b   b   b   at the point   x   x   x   is the stochastic process         L  x    (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t    δ   (   x  -   b   (  s  )     )   d  s     ,         superscript  L  x   t     superscript   subscript   0   t     δ    x    b  s    d  s      L^{x}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\delta(x-b(s))\,ds,     where   δ   δ   \delta   is the Dirac delta function . It is a notion invented by Paul Lévy . The basic idea is that     L  x    (  t  )        superscript  L  x   t    L^{x}(t)   is a (rescaled) measure of how much time    b   (  s  )       b  s    b(s)   has spent at   x   x   x   up to time   t   t   t   . It may be written as         L  x    (  t  )    =    lim   ε  ↓  0      1   2  ε      ∫  0  t      1   {  x  -  ε  <  b   (  s  )   <  x  +  ε  }     d  s       ,         superscript  L  x   t     subscript    normal-↓  ε  0        1    2  ε      superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  1   fragments  normal-{  x   ε   b   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    x   ε  normal-}    d  s        L^{x}(t)=\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\frac{1}{2\varepsilon}\int_{0}^{t}1_{\{%
 x-\varepsilon     which explains why it is called the local time of   b   b   b   at   x   x   x   . For a discrete state-space process     (   X  s   )    s  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  X  s     s  0     (X_{s})_{s\geq 0}   , the local time can be expressed more simply as 1         L  x    (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t     1   {  x  }     (   X  s   )   d  s     .         superscript  L  x   t     superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  1   x     subscript  X  s   d  s      L^{x}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}1_{\{x\}}(X_{s})\,ds.     Tanaka's Formula  Tanaka's formula provides a definition of local time for an arbitrary continuous semimartingale     (   X  s   )    s  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  X  s     s  0     (X_{s})_{s\geq 0}   on    ℝ  :      normal-:  ℝ  absent    \mathbb{R}:    2         L  x    (  t  )    =    |    X  t   -  x   |   -   |    X  0   -  x   |   -    ∫  0  t     (     1   (  0  ,  ∞  )     (    X  s   -  x   )    -    1   (   -  ∞   ,  0  ]     (    X  s   -  x   )     )   d   X  s       ,   t  ≥  0.      formulae-sequence       superscript  L  x   t          subscript  X  t   x         subscript  X  0   x      superscript   subscript   0   t          subscript  1   0        subscript  X  s   x       subscript  1       0       subscript  X  s   x     d   subscript  X  s         t  0.     L^{x}(t)=|X_{t}-x|-|X_{0}-x|-\int_{0}^{t}\left(1_{(0,\infty)}(X_{s}-x)-1_{(-%
 \infty,0]}(X_{s}-x)\right)dX_{s},\qquad t\geq 0.   A more general form was proven independently by Meyer 3 and Wang; 4 the formula extends Itô's lemma for twice differentiable functions to a more general class of functions. If    F  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  F   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is absolutely continuous with derivative     F  ′   ,     superscript  F  normal-′    F^{\prime},   which is of bounded variation, then        F   (   X  t   )    =    F   (   X  0   )    +    ∫  0  t     F  -  ′    (   X  s   )   d   X  s     +    1  2     ∫   -  ∞   ∞     L  x    (  t  )   d   F  ′    (  x  )        ,        F   subscript  X  t        F   subscript  X  0      superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript   superscript  F  normal-′      subscript  X  s   d   subscript  X  s         1  2     superscript   subscript             superscript  L  x   t  d   superscript  F  normal-′   x        F(X_{t})=F(X_{0})+\int_{0}^{t}F^{\prime}_{-}(X_{s})dX_{s}+\frac{1}{2}\int_{-%
 \infty}^{\infty}L^{x}(t)dF^{\prime}(x),   where    F  -  ′     subscript   superscript  F  normal-′      F^{\prime}_{-}   is the left derivative.  Tanaka's formula can be used to show that the field of local times    L  =    (    L  x    (  t  )    )     x  ∈  ℝ   ,   t  ≥  0         L   subscript     superscript  L  x   t    formulae-sequence    x  ℝ     t  0       L=(L^{x}(t))_{x\in\mathbb{R},t\geq 0}   has a modification which is càdlàg in   x   x   x   , and uniformly bounded in   t   t   t   . 5  Tanaka's formula provides the explicit Doob-Meyer decomposition for the one-dimensional reflecting Brownian motion,     (   |   B  s   |   )    s  ≥  0      subscript     subscript  B  s      s  0     (|B_{s}|)_{s\geq 0}   .  Ray-Knight Theorems  The field of local times     L  t   =    (   L  t  x   )    x  ∈  E         subscript  L  t    subscript   subscript   superscript  L  x   t     x  E      L_{t}=(L^{x}_{t})_{x\in E}   associated to a stochastic process on a space   E   E   E   is a well studied topic in the area of random fields. Ray-Knight type theorems relate the field L t to an associated Gaussian process .  In general Ray-Knight type theorems of the first kind consider the field L t at a hitting time of the underlying process, whilst theorems of the second kind are in terms of a stopping time at which the field of local times first exceeds a given value.  First Ray-Knight Theorem  Let ( B t ) t ≥ 0 be a one-dimensional Brownian motion started from B 0 = a > 0 , and ( W t ) t≥0 be a standard two-dimensional Brownian motion W 0 = 0  ∈  R 2 . Define the stopping time at which B first hits the origin,    T  =   inf   {   t  ≥  0   :    B  t   =  0   }        T   infimum   conditional-set    t  0      subscript  B  t   0       T=\inf\{t\geq 0\colon B_{t}=0\}   . Ray 6 and Knight 7 (independently) showed that {=} \left\{ |W_x|^2 \colon x \in [0,a] \right\} \,| 1 }} where ( L t ) t ≥ 0 is the field of local times of ( B t ) t ≥ 0 , and equality is in distribution on C [ 0 , a ]. The process | W x | 2 is known as the squared Bessel process .  Second Ray-Knight Theorem  Let ( B t ) t ≥ 0 be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion B 0 = 0  ∈  R , and let ( L t ) t ≥ 0 be the associated field of local times. Let T a be the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds a > 0        T  a   =   inf   {   t  ≥  0   :    L  t  0   >  a   }     .       subscript  T  a    infimum   conditional-set    t  0      subscript   superscript  L  0   t   a       T_{a}=\inf\{t\geq 0\colon L^{0}_{t}>a\}.   Let ( W t ) t ≥ 0 be an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion started from W 0 = 0 , then 8 {=} \left\{ (W_x + \sqrt a )^2 \colon x \geq 0 \right \}. \,| 2 }} Equivalently, the process     (   L   T  a   x   )    x  ≥  0      subscript   subscript   superscript  L  x    subscript  T  a      x  0     (L^{x}_{T_{a}})_{x\geq 0}   (which is a process in the spatial variable   x   x   x   ) is equal in distribution to the square of a 0-dimensional Bessel process , and as such is Markovian.  Generalized Ray-Knight Theorems  Results of Ray-Knight type for more general stochastic processes have been intensively studied, and analogue statements of both () and () are known for strongly symmetric Markov processes.
