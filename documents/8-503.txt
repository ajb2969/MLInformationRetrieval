In the mathematical theory of stochastic processes, local time is a stochastic process associated with diffusion processes such as Brownian motion, that characterizes the amount of time a particle has spent at a given level. Local time appears in various stochastic integration formulas, such as Tanaka's formula, if the integrand is not sufficiently smooth. It is also studied in statistical mechanics in the context of random fields.
Formal definition
For a diffusion process 
 
 
 
 , the local time of 
 
 
 
  at the point 
 
 
 
  is the stochastic process



where 
 
 
 
  is the Dirac delta function. It is a notion invented by Paul Lévy. The basic idea is that 
 
 
 
  is a (rescaled) measure of how much time 
 
 
 
  has spent at 
 
 
 
  up to time 
 
 
 
 . It may be written as



which explains why it is called the local time of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . For a discrete state-space process 
 
 
 
 , the local time can be expressed more simply as1



Tanaka's Formula
Tanaka's formula provides a definition of local time for an arbitrary continuous semimartingale 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
2


 
  A more general form was proven independently by Meyer3 and Wang;4 the formula extends Itô's lemma for twice differentiable functions to a more general class of functions. If 
 
 
 
  is absolutely continuous with derivative 
 
 
 
  which is of bounded variation, then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the left derivative.
Tanaka's formula can be used to show that the field of local times 
 
 
 
  has a modification which is càdlàg in 
 
 
 
 , and uniformly bounded in 
 
 
 
 .5
Tanaka's formula provides the explicit Doob-Meyer decomposition for the one-dimensional reflecting Brownian motion, 
 
 
 
 .
Ray-Knight Theorems
The field of local times 
 
 
 
  associated to a stochastic process on a space 
 
 
 
  is a well studied topic in the area of random fields. Ray-Knight type theorems relate the field Lt to an associated Gaussian process.
In general Ray-Knight type theorems of the first kind consider the field Lt at a hitting time of the underlying process, whilst theorems of the second kind are in terms of a stopping time at which the field of local times first exceeds a given value.
First Ray-Knight Theorem
Let (Bt)t ≥ 0 be a one-dimensional Brownian motion started from B0 = a > 0, and (Wt)t≥0 be a standard two-dimensional Brownian motion W0 = 0 ∈ R2. Define the stopping time at which B first hits the origin, 
 
 
 
 . Ray6 and Knight7 (independently) showed that {=} \left\{ |W_x|^2 \colon x \in [0,a] \right\} \,|1}} where (Lt)t ≥ 0 is the field of local times of (Bt)t ≥ 0, and equality is in distribution on C[0, a]. The process |Wx|2 is known as the squared Bessel process.
Second Ray-Knight Theorem
Let (Bt)t ≥ 0 be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion B0 = 0 ∈ R, and let (Lt)t ≥ 0 be the associated field of local times. Let Ta be the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds a > 0


 
  Let (Wt)t ≥ 0 be an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion started from W0 = 0, then8 {=} \left\{ (W_x + \sqrt a )^2 \colon x \geq 0 \right \}. \,|2}} Equivalently, the process 
 
 
 
  (which is a process in the spatial variable 
 
 
 
 ) is equal in distribution to the square of a 0-dimensional Bessel process, and as such is Markovian.
Generalized Ray-Knight Theorems
Results of Ray-Knight type for more general stochastic processes have been intensively studied, and analogue statements of both () and () are known for strongly symmetric Markov processes.
