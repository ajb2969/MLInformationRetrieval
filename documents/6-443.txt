Global symmetry

In physics, a global symmetry is a symmetry that holds at all points in the spacetime under consideration, as opposed to a local symmetry which varies from point to point.
Global symmetries require conservation laws, but not forces, in physics.
An example of a global symmetry is the action of the 
 
 
 
  (for 
 
 
 
  a constant - making it a global transformation) group on the Dirac Lagrangian:








Under this transformation the wavefunction changes as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and so:
