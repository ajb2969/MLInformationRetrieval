Nicotinate riboside kinase

Nicotinate riboside kinase (, ribosylnicotinic acid kinase, nicotinic acid riboside kinase, NRK1) is an enzyme with system name ATP:beta-D-ribosylnicotinate 5-phosphotransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + beta-D-ribosylnicotinate 
 
 
 
  ADP + nicotinate beta-D-ribonucleotide
 

The enzyme from yeast and human also acts as EC 2.7.1.22 (ribosylnicotinamide kinase).
