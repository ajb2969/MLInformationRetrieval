   Weyl's lemma (Laplace equation)      Weyl's lemma (Laplace equation)   In mathematics , Weyl's lemma , named after Hermann Weyl , states that every weak solution of Laplace's equation is a smooth solution. This contrasts with the wave equation , for example, which has weak solutions that are not smooth solutions. Weyl's lemma is a special case of elliptic or hypoelliptic regularity .  Statement of the lemma  Let   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   be an open subset of   n   n   n   -dimensional Euclidean space    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , and let   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   denote the usual Laplace operator . Weyl's lemma 1 states that if a locally integrable function    u  ∈    L  loc  1    (  Ω  )        u     superscript   subscript  L  loc   1   normal-Ω     u\in L_{\mathrm{loc}}^{1}(\Omega)   is a weak solution of Laplace's equation, in the sense that        ∫  Ω    u   (  x  )   Δ  ϕ   (  x  )   d  x    =  0        subscript   normal-Ω     u  x  normal-Δ  ϕ  x  d  x    0    \int_{\Omega}u(x)\Delta\phi(x)\,dx=0     for every smooth test function    ϕ  ∈    C  c  ∞    (  Ω  )        ϕ     superscript   subscript  C  c     normal-Ω     \phi\in C_{c}^{\infty}(\Omega)   with compact support , then (up to redefinition on a set of measure zero )    u  ∈    C  ∞    (  Ω  )        u     superscript  C    normal-Ω     u\in C^{\infty}(\Omega)   is smooth and satisfies     Δ  u   =  0        normal-Δ  u   0    \Delta u=0   pointwise in   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   .  This result implies the interior regularity of harmonic functions in   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , but it does not say anything about their regularity on the boundary    ∂  Ω      normal-Ω    \partial\Omega   .  Idea of the proof  To prove Weyl's lemma, one convolves the function   u   u   u   with an appropriate mollifier     ϕ  ϵ     subscript  ϕ  ϵ    \phi_{\epsilon}   and shows that the mollification     u  ϵ   =    ϕ  ϵ   ∗  u        subscript  u  ϵ    normal-∗   subscript  ϕ  ϵ   u     u_{\epsilon}=\phi_{\epsilon}\ast u   satisfies Laplace's equation, which implies that    u  ϵ     subscript  u  ϵ    u_{\epsilon}   has the mean value property. Taking the limit as    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\to 0   and using the properties of mollifiers, one finds that   u   u   u   also has the mean value property, which implies that it is a smooth solution of Laplace's equation. 2 Alternative proofs use the smoothness of the fundamental solution of the Laplacian or suitable a priori elliptic estimates.  Generalization to distributions  More generally, the same result holds for every distributional solution of Laplace's equation: If    T  ∈    D  ′    (  Ω  )        T     superscript  D  normal-′   normal-Ω     T\in D^{\prime}(\Omega)   satisfies     ⟨  T  ,   Δ  ϕ   ⟩   =  0       T    normal-Δ  ϕ    0    \langle T,\Delta\phi\rangle=0   for every    ϕ  ∈    C  c  ∞    (  Ω  )        ϕ     superscript   subscript  C  c     normal-Ω     \phi\in C_{c}^{\infty}(\Omega)   , then    T  =   T  u       T   subscript  T  u     T=T_{u}   is a regular distribution associated with a smooth solution    u  ∈    C  ∞    (  Ω  )        u     superscript  C    normal-Ω     u\in C^{\infty}(\Omega)   of Laplace's equation. 3  Connection with hypoellipticity  Weyl's lemma follows from more general results concerning the regularity properties of elliptic or hypoelliptic operators. 4 A linear partial differential operator   P   P   P   with smooth coefficients is hypoelliptic if the singular support of    P  u      P  u    Pu   is equal to the singular support of   u   u   u   for every distribution   u   u   u   . The Laplace operator is hypoelliptic, so if     Δ  u   =  0        normal-Δ  u   0    \Delta u=0   , then the singular support of   u   u   u   is empty since the singular support of   0   0    is empty, meaning that    u  ∈    C  ∞    (  Ω  )        u     superscript  C    normal-Ω     u\in C^{\infty}(\Omega)   . In fact, since the Laplacian is elliptic, a stronger result is true, and solutions of     Δ  u   =  0        normal-Δ  u   0    \Delta u=0   are real-analytic .
