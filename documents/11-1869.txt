   Vague topology      Vague topology   In mathematics , particularly in the area of functional analysis and topological vector spaces , the vague topology is an example of the weak-* topology which arises in the study of measures on locally compact Hausdorff spaces .  Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space . Let M ( X ) be the space of complex  Radon measures on X , and C 0 ( X ) * denote the dual of C 0 ( X ), the Banach space of complex continuous functions on X  vanishing at infinity equipped with the uniform norm . By the Riesz representation theorem  M ( X ) is isometric to C 0 ( X ) * . The isometry maps a measure μ to a linear functional         I  μ    (  f  )    :=    ∫  X     f   d  μ     .     assign     subscript  I  μ   f     subscript   X     f  d  μ      I_{\mu}(f):=\int_{X}f\,d\mu.     The vague topology is the weak-* topology on C 0 ( X ) * . The corresponding topology on M ( X ) induced by the isometry from C 0 ( X ) * is also called the vague topology on M ( X ). Thus, in particular, one may refer to vague convergence of measure μ n → μ .  One application of this is to probability theory : for example, the central limit theorem is essentially a statement that if μ n are the probability measures for certain sums of independent random variables , then μ n converge weakly (and then vaguely) to a normal distribution , i.e. the measure μ n is "approximately normal" for large n .
