Schnorr signature

In cryptography, a Schnorr signature is a digital signature produced by the Schnorr signature algorithm. Its security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems. The Schnorr signature is considered the simplest1 digital signature scheme to be provably secure in a random oracle model.2 It is efficient and generates short signatures. It is covered by , which expired in February 2008.
Algorithm
Choosing parameters

All users of the signature scheme agree on a group

 
  with generator 
 
 
 
  of prime order 
 
 
 
  in which the discrete log problem is hard. Typically a Schnorr group is used.
All users agree on a cryptographic hash function

Notation
In the following,

Exponentiation stands for repeated application of the group operation
Juxtaposition stands for multiplication on the set of congruence classes or application of the group operation (as applicable)
Subtraction stands for subtraction on set of equivalence groups


 
 , the set of finite bit strings


 
 , the set of congruence classes modulo 
 
 



 
 , the multiplicative group of integers modulo

 )

Signing
To sign a message

Choose a random 
 
 
 
  from the allowed set.
Let

Let 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes concatenation and 
 
 
 
  is represented as a bit string.
Let 
 
 
 
 .

The signature is the pair

Verifying

Let 
 
 


If 
 
 
 
  then the signature is verified.
Proof of correctness
It is relatively easy to see that 
 
 
 
  if the signed message equals the verified message:

Security argument
The signature scheme was constructed by applying the Fiat–Shamir transform3 to Schnorr's identification protocol.4 Therefore (per Fiat and Shamir's arguments), it is secure if 
 
 
 
  is modeled as a random oracle.
Its security can also be argued in the generic group model, under the assumption that 
 
 
 
  is "random-prefix preimage resistant" and "random-prefix second-preimage resistant".5 In particular, 
 
 
 
  does not need to be collision resistant.
In 2012, Seurin6 provided an exact proof of the Schnorr signature scheme. In particular, Seurin shows that the security proof using the Forking lemma is the best possible result for any signature schemes based on one-way group homomorphisms including Schnorr-Type signatures and the Guillou-Quasiquater signature schemes. Namely, under the ROMDL assumption, any algebraic reduction must lose a factor 
 
 
 
  in its time-to-success ratio, where 
 
 
 
 ''' '''is a function that remains close to 1 as long as "

 
  is noticeably smaller than 1", where 
 
 
 
  is the probability of forging an error making at most 
 
 
 
  queries to the random oracle.
