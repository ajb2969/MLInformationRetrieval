   Cologarithm      Cologarithm   In mathematics , the base- b  cologarithm , sometimes shortened to colog , of a number is the base- b  logarithm of the reciprocal of the number. It is equal to the negative base- b logarithm of the number.         colog  b    x   =    log  b    (   1  x   )    =     log  b   1   -    log  b   x    =   -    log  b    x             subscript  colog  b   x     subscript   b     1  x             subscript   b   1     subscript   b   x             subscript   b   x       \operatorname{colog}_{b}\ x=\log_{b}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=\log_{b}1-\log_{b%
 }x=-\log_{b}x\,     In chemistry , a decimal cologarithm is indicated by the letter p. This usage originated with the quantity pH , defined as –log 10 [H 3 O + ]. Based on pH, the quantity p K a was later defined as –log 10  K a .  References   Meriam Webster definition of cologarithm  "Cologarithm." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.
