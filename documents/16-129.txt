5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase

5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase (, 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine ammoniophospholyase, AGXT2L2 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (5R)-5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine phosphate-lyase (deaminating; (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(5R)-5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine + H2O 
 
 
 
  (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate + NH3 + phosphate


This enzyme is a pyridoxal-phosphate protein.
