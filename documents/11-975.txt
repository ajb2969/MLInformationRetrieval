   Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase      Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase   In enzymology , a protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protein glutamine + alkylamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protein N 5 -alkylglutamine + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are protein glutamine and alkylamine , whereas its two products are protein N(5)-alkylglutamine and NH 3 .  This enzyme participates in complement and coagulation cascades and Huntington's disease . It employs one cofactor , calcium .  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is protein-glutamine:amine gamma-glutamyltransferase . Other names in common use include:   factor XIIIa,  fibrin stabilizing factor,  fibrinoligase,  glutaminylpeptide gamma-glutamyltransferase,  polyamine transglutaminase,  R-glutaminyl-peptide:amine gamma-glutamyl transferase  tissue transglutaminase, and  transglutaminase.
