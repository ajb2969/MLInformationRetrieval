   Viridiflorene synthase      Viridiflorene synthase   Viridiflorene synthase (, TPS31 ) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (viridiflorene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    viridiflorene + diphosphate    Viridiflorene is the only product of this enzyme from Solanum lycopersicum .
