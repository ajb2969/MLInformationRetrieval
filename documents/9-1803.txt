   Method of simulated moments      Method of simulated moments  In [[econometrics]], the '''method of simulated moments (MSM)''' (also called '''simulated method of mom ents''' 1 ) is a structural estimation technique introduced by Daniel McFadden . 2 It extends the generalized method of moments to cases where theoretical moment functions cannot be evaluated directly, such as when moment functions involve high-dimensional integrals . MSM's earliest and principal applications have been to research in industrial organization , after its development by Ariel Pakes , David Pollard, and others, though applications in consumption are emerging.

Indirect Inference  MSM is a special case of Indirect Inference . While Indirect Inference allows the researcher to use any of the features of sample statistics as a basis for comparison of moments and data, the name MSM applies only when those statistics are moments of the data, i.e. averages, across the sample of functions defined for a single sample element. 3  References  "  Category:Econometrics  Category:Estimation theory     ↩  D.
