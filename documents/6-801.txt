   Vietoris–Begle mapping theorem      Vietoris–Begle mapping theorem   The Vietoris–Begle mapping theorem is a result in the mathematical field of algebraic topology . It is named for Leopold Vietoris and Edward G. Begle . The statement of the theorem, below, is as formulated by Stephen Smale .  Theorem  Let   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   be compact  metric spaces , and let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be surjective and continuous . Suppose that the fibers of   f   f   f   are acyclic , so that          H  ~   r    (    f   -  1     (  y  )    )    =  0   ,         subscript   normal-~  H   r      superscript  f    1    y    0    \tilde{H}_{r}(f^{-1}(y))=0,   for all    0  ≤  r  ≤   n  -  1         0  r         n  1      0\leq r\leq n-1   and all    y  ∈  Y      y  Y    y\in Y   , with     H  ~   r     subscript   normal-~  H   r    \tilde{H}_{r}   denoting the   r   r   r   th reduced homology  group . Then, the induced homomorphism       f  *   :      H  ~   r    (  X  )    →     H  ~   r    (  Y  )        normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript   normal-~  H   r   X      subscript   normal-~  H   r   Y      f_{*}:\tilde{H}_{r}(X)\to\tilde{H}_{r}(Y)   is an isomorphism for    r  ≤   n  -  1       r    n  1     r\leq n-1   and a surjection for    r  =  n      r  n    r=n   .
