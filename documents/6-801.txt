Vietoris–Begle mapping theorem

The Vietoris–Begle mapping theorem is a result in the mathematical field of algebraic topology. It is named for Leopold Vietoris and Edward G. Begle. The statement of the theorem, below, is as formulated by Stephen Smale.
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be compact metric spaces, and let 
 
 
 
  be surjective and continuous. Suppose that the fibers of 
 
 
 
  are acyclic, so that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  denoting the 
 
 
 
 th reduced homology group. Then, the induced homomorphism


 
  is an isomorphism for 
 
 
 
  and a surjection for 
 
 
 
 .
