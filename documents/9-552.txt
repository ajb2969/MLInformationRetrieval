The other two are its dual the 24-cell honeycomb, and the tesseractic honeycomb. This honeycomb is constructed from 16-cell facets, three around every face. It has a 24-cell vertex figure.
This vertex arrangement or lattice is called the B4, D4, or F4 lattice.12
Alternate names

Hexadecachoric tetracomb/honeycomb
Demitesseractic tetracomb/honeycomb

Coordinates
As a regular honeycomb, {3,3,4,3}, it has a 2-dimensional analogue, {3,6}, and as an alternated form (the demitesseractic honeycomb, h{4,3,3,4}) it is related to the alternated cubic honeycomb.
Vertices can be placed at all integer coordinates (i,j,k,l), such that the sum of the coordinates is even.
D4 lattice
Its vertex arrangement is called the D4 lattice or F4 lattice.3 The vertices of this lattice are the centers of the 3-spheres in the densest possible packing of equal spheres in 4-space; its kissing number is 24, which is also the highest possible in 4-space.4

The D
 
 
 
  lattice (also called D
 
 
 
 ) can be constructed by the union of two 4-demicubic lattices, and is identical to the tesseractic honeycomb:


∪  =  = 


This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 23=8, (2n-1 for n8).5
The D
 
 
 
 
  lattice (also called D
 
 
 
  and C
 
 
 
 ) can be constructed by the union of all four 5-demicubic honeycombs, but it is identical to the D4 lattice: It is also the 4-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 4-cube honeycombs in dual positions.


∪  ∪  ∪  =  =  ∪ .


The kissing number of the D
 
 
 
  lattice (and D4 lattice) is 246 and its Voronoi tessellation is a 24-cell honeycomb, , containing all rectified 16-cells (24-cell) Voronoi cells,  or .7
Symmetry constructions
There are three different symmetry constructions of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by different arrangements of colored 16-cell facets.
