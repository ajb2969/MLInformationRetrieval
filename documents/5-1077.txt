   Pulse wave      Pulse wave   (Figure)  The shape of the pulse wave is defined by its duty cycle D, which is the ratio between the pulse duration (   τ   τ   \tau   ) and the period (T)   A pulse wave or pulse train is a kind of non-sinusoidal  waveform that is similar to a square wave , but does not have the symmetrical shape associated with a perfect square wave. It is a term common to synthesizer programming, and is a typical waveform available on many synthesizers. The exact shape of the wave is determined by the duty cycle of the oscillator . In many synthesizers, the duty cycle can be modulated (sometimes called pulse-width modulation) for a more dynamic timbre. 1 The pulse wave is also known as the rectangular wave , the periodic version of the rectangular function .  The Fourier series expansion for a rectangular pulse wave with period   T   T   T   and pulse time   τ   τ   τ   is       f   (  t  )    =    τ  T   +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     2   n  π     sin   (    π  n  τ   T   )     cos   (     2  π  n   T   t   )             f  t       τ  T     superscript   subscript     n  1          2    n  π          π  n  τ   T            2  π  n   T   t         f(t)=\frac{\tau}{T}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{n\pi}\sin\left(\frac{\pi n\tau%
 }{T}\right)\cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{T}t\right)     Note that, for symmetry, the starting time (    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   ) in this expansion is halfway through the first pulse. The phase can be offset to match the accompanying graph by replacing   t   t   t   with    t  -   τ  /  2       t    τ  2     t-τ/2   .  A pulse wave can be created by subtracting a sawtooth wave from a phase-shifted version of itself. If the sawtooth waves are bandlimited , the resulting pulse wave is bandlimited, too. Another way to create one is with a single ramp wave (sawtooth or triangle) and a comparator, with the ramp wave on one input, and a variable DC threshold on the other. The result will be a precisely controlled pulse width, but it will not be bandlimited.
