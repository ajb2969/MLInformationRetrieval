4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase

In enzymology, a 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-chlorobenzoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-hydroxybenzoate + chloride
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorobenzoate and H2O, whereas its two products are 4-hydroxybenzoate and chloride.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on halide bonds in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-chlorobenzoate chlorohydrolase. This enzyme is also called halobenzoate dehalogenase.
