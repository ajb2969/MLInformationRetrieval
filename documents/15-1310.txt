   TRNA (guanine10-N2)-methyltransferase      TRNA (guanine10-N2)-methyltransferase   TRNA (guanine 10 -N 2 )-methyltransferase (, (m2G10) methyltransferase , Trm11-Trm112 complex ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine 10 -N 2 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 10 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 2 -methylguanine 10 in tRNA   tRNA (guanine 10 -N 2 )-methyltransferase from yeast does not catalyse the methylation from N 2 -methylguanine 10 to N 2 -dimethylguanine 10 in tRNA.
