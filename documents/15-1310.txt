TRNA (guanine10-N2)-methyltransferase

TRNA (guanine10-N2)-methyltransferase (, (m2G10) methyltransferase, Trm11-Trm112 complex) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine10-N2)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine10 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N2-methylguanine10 in tRNA
 

tRNA (guanine10-N2)-methyltransferase from yeast does not catalyse the methylation from N2-methylguanine10 to N2-dimethylguanine10 in tRNA.
