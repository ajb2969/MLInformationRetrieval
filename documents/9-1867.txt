A structure

 
  for 
 
 
 
  is a Herbrand structure if the domain of 
 
 
 
  is the Herbrand universe of 
 
 
 
  and the interpretation of 
 
 
 
  is a Herbrand interpretation. This fixes the domain of 
 
 
 
 , and so each Herbrand structure can be identified with its interpretation.
A Herbrand model of a theory
