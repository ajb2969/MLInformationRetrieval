   Herbrand structure      Herbrand structure   In mathematics , for a language    ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   , define the Herbrand universe to be the set of ground terms of   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   .  A structure    𝔐   𝔐   \mathfrak{M}   for   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   is a Herbrand structure if the domain of   𝔐   𝔐   \mathfrak{M}   is the Herbrand universe of   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   and the interpretation of   𝔐   𝔐   \mathfrak{M}   is a Herbrand interpretation . This fixes the domain of   𝔐   𝔐   \mathfrak{M}   , and so each Herbrand structure can be identified with its interpretation.  A Herbrand model of a theory    T   T   T   is a Herbrand structure that is a model of    T  .    T   T.     See also   Herbrand base  Herbrand's theorem   "  Category:Mathematical logic
