   Level (logarithmic quantity)      Level (logarithmic quantity)   In the International System of Quantities , the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same quantity. 1 2 Examples are sound power level (literally, the level of the sound power , abbreviated SWL), sound exposure level (SEL), sound pressure level (SPL) and particle velocity level (SVL). 3  Mathematical definitions  Level  Level of a quantity Q, denoted L Q , is defined by        L  Q   =     log  r     (   Q   Q  0    )     ,       subscript  L  Q     subscript   r     Q   subscript  Q  0       L_{Q}=\log_{r}\!\left(\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right)\!,   where   r is the base of the logarithm;  Q is the root-power quantity;  Q 0 is the reference value of Q .   Level of a field quantity  Level of a field quantity, denoted L F , is defined by        L  F   =    ln    (   F   F  0    )     ,       subscript  L  F       F   subscript  F  0       L_{F}=\ln\!\left(\frac{F}{F_{0}}\right)\!,   where   F is the field quantity;  F 0 is the reference value of F .   For the level of a field quantity, the base of the logarithm is r = e .  Level of a root-power quantity  A root-power quantity is a field quantity. The Level of a root-power quantity, denoted L F , is therefore        L  F   =    ln    (   F   F  0    )     ,       subscript  L  F       F   subscript  F  0       L_{F}=\ln\!\left(\frac{F}{F_{0}}\right)\!,   where   F is the root-power quantity;  F 0 is the reference value of F .   For the level of a root-power quantity, the base of the logarithm is r = e .  Level of a power quantity  Level of a power quantity, denoted L P , is defined by        L  P   =     log   e  2      (   P   P  0    )    =    1  2     ln    (   P   P  0    )      ,         subscript  L  P     subscript    superscript  e  2      P   subscript  P  0              1  2       P   subscript  P  0         L_{P}=\log_{e^{2}}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_{0}}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\ln\!\left(\frac{P%
 }{P_{0}}\right)\!,   where   P is the power quantity;  P 0 is the reference value of P .   For the level of a power quantity, the base of the logarithm is r = e 2 . 4  Units of level  Power level  The neper , bel , and decibel (one tenth of a bel) are units of level that are often applied to such quantities as power, intensity, or gain. The neper, bel, and decibel are defined by    ;   ;   .   If F is a root-power quantity:        L  F   =     ln    (   F   F  0    )    Np   =   2     log  10     (   F   F  0    )    B   =   20     log  10     (   F   F  0    )    dB    .         subscript  L  F         F   subscript  F  0     Np          2    subscript   10     F   subscript  F  0     normal-B          20    subscript   10     F   subscript  F  0     dB      L_{F}=\ln\!\left(\frac{F}{F_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{Np}=2\log_{10}\!\left(%
 \frac{F}{F_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{B}=20\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{F}{F_{0}}\right%
 )\!~{}\mathrm{dB}.     If P is a power quantity:        L  P   =    1  2     ln    (   P   P  0    )    Np   =      log  10     (   P   P  0    )    B   =   10     log  10     (   P   P  0    )    dB    .         subscript  L  P       1  2       P   subscript  P  0     Np            subscript   10     P   subscript  P  0     normal-B          10    subscript   10     P   subscript  P  0     dB      L_{P}=\frac{1}{2}\ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{Np}=\log_{10}\!%
 \left(\frac{P}{P_{0}}\right)\!~{}\mathrm{B}=10\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_{0}}%
 \right)\!~{}\mathrm{dB}.     If the power quantity P is equal to F 2 , and if the reference value of the power quantity, P 0 , is equal to F 0 2 , the levels L F and L P are equal.  Frequency level  The octave is a unit of level (specifically "frequency level", for r = 2) though that concept is seldom seen outside of the standard. 5 A semitone is one twelfth of an octave.  Standardization  The level and its units are defined in ISO 80000-3 .
