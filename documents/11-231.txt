Oligogalacturonide lyase




Oligogalacturonide lyase

In enzymology, an oligogalacturonide lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-(4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl)-D-galacturonate 
 
 
 
  2 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-(4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl)-D-galacturonate, and one product, 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on polysaccharides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oligogalacturonide lyase. Other names in common use include oligogalacturonate lyase, unsaturated oligogalacturonate transeliminase, and OGTE. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
