   Moving shock      Moving shock   In fluid dynamics , a moving shock is a shock wave that is travelling through a fluid (often gaseous ) medium with a velocity relative to the velocity of the fluid already making up the medium. 1 As such, the normal shock relations require modification to calculate the properties before and after the moving shock. A knowledge of moving shocks is important for studying the phenomena surrounding detonation , among other applications.  Theory  To derive the theoretical equations for a moving shock, one may start by denoting the region in front of the shock as subscript 1, with the subscript 2 defining the region behind the shock. This is shown in the figure, with the shock wave propagating to the right. The velocity of the gas is denoted by u , pressure by p , and the local speed of sound by a . The speed of the shock wave relative to the gas is W , making the total velocity equal to u 1 + W .  Next, suppose a reference frame is then fixed to the shock so it appears stationary as the gas in regions 1 and 2 move with a velocity relative to it. Redefining region 1 as x and region 2 as y leads to the following shock-relative velocities:         u   y   =    W  +   u  1    -   u  2     ,       subscript  u  y       W   subscript  u  1     subscript  u  2      \ u_{y}=W+u_{1}-u_{2},            u   x   =  W   .       subscript  u  x   W    \ u_{x}=W.     With these shock-relative velocities, the properties of the regions before and after the shock can be defined below introducing the temperature as T , the density as ρ , and the Mach number as M :        p   1   =   p  x   ;   p  2   =   p  y   ;   T  1   =   T  x   ;   T  2   =   T  y   ,     fragments   subscript  p  1     subscript  p  x    normal-;   subscript  p  2     subscript  p  y    normal-;   subscript  T  1     subscript  T  x    normal-;   subscript  T  2     subscript  T  y   normal-,    \ p_{1}=p_{x}\quad;\quad p_{2}=p_{y}\quad;\quad T_{1}=T_{x}\quad;\quad T_{2}=T%

 \quad a_{2}=a_{y},            M   x   =    u  x    a  x    =   W   a  1     ,         subscript  M  x      subscript  u  x    subscript  a  x           W   subscript  a  1       \ M_{x}=\frac{u_{x}}{a_{x}}=\frac{W}{a_{1}},            M   y   =    u  y    a  y    =     W  +   u  1    -   u  2     a  2     .         subscript  M  y      subscript  u  y    subscript  a  y               W   subscript  u  1     subscript  u  2     subscript  a  2       \ M_{y}=\frac{u_{y}}{a_{y}}=\frac{W+u_{1}-u_{2}}{a_{2}}.     Introducing the heat capacity ratio as γ , the speed of sound , density, and pressure ratios can be derived:          a  2    a  1     =    1  +     2   (   γ  -  1   )      (   γ  +  1   )   2     [    γ   M  x  2    -   1   M  x  2    -   (   γ  -  1   )    ]       ,         subscript  a  2    subscript  a  1        1        2    γ  1     superscript    γ  1   2     delimited-[]      γ   superscript   subscript  M  x   2      1   superscript   subscript  M  x   2      γ  1          \ \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}=\sqrt{1+\frac{2(\gamma-1)}{(\gamma+1)^{2}}\left[\gamma M%
 _{x}^{2}-\frac{1}{M_{x}^{2}}-(\gamma-1)\right]},             ρ  2    ρ  1     =   1   1  -    2   γ  +  1     [   1  -   1   M  x  2     ]       ,         subscript  ρ  2    subscript  ρ  1      1    1      2    γ  1     delimited-[]    1    1   superscript   subscript  M  x   2           \ \frac{\rho_{2}}{\rho_{1}}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\left[1-\frac{1}{M_{x%
 }^{2}}\right]},             p  2    p  1     =   1  +     2  γ    γ  +  1     [    M  x  2   -  1   ]      .         subscript  p  2    subscript  p  1      1        2  γ     γ  1     delimited-[]     superscript   subscript  M  x   2   1        \ \frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}=1+\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma+1}\left[M_{x}^{2}-1\right].     One must keep in mind that the above equations are for a shock wave moving towards the right. For a shock moving towards the left, the x and y subscripts must be switched and:         u   y   =    W  -   u  1    +   u  2     ,       subscript  u  y       W   subscript  u  1     subscript  u  2      \ u_{y}=W-u_{1}+u_{2},            M   y   =     W  -   u  1    +   u  2     a  2     .       subscript  M  y         W   subscript  u  1     subscript  u  2     subscript  a  2      \ M_{y}=\frac{W-u_{1}+u_{2}}{a_{2}}.
