   Goldschmidt tolerance factor      Goldschmidt tolerance factor  '''Goldschmidt's tolerance factor''' is an indicator for the stability and distortion of crystal structures. {{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N-rXAAAAMAA J&q;=Handbook+of+magnetism+and+advanced+magnetic+materials&dq;=Handbook+of+magnetism+and+advanced+magnetic+materials&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=KKfOUtHKCeeysQSa14HYDA&ved;=0CDoQ6AEwAA |last1=Parkin|first1=editors-in-chief, Helmut Kronmller, Stuart|title=Handbook of magnetism and advanced magnetic materials|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-02217-7|author2=Mats Johnsson|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|author3=Peter Lemmens|accessdate=17 May 2012}} It was originally only used to describe perovskite structure, but now tolerance factors are also used for ilmenite . 1  Alternatively the tolerance factor can be used to calculate the compatibility of an ion with a crystal structure. 2  The first description of the tolerance factor for perovskite was made by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt in 1926. 3  Mathematical expression  The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is a dimensionless number that is calculated from the ratio of the ionic radii: 4          t  =     r  A   +   r  0      2    (    r  B   +   r  0    )         t       subscript  r  A    subscript  r  0        2      subscript  r  B    subscript  r  0        t={r_{A}+r_{0}\over\sqrt{2}(r_{B}+r_{0})}        r A is the radius of the A-cation.     In an ideal cubic perovskite structure the axis of the unit cell (a) can be described with the following equation: 5          a  =    2    (    r  A   +   r  0    )    =   2   (    r  B   +   r  0    )          a      2      subscript  r  A    subscript  r  0            2     subscript  r  B    subscript  r  0        a=\sqrt{2}(r_{A}+r_{0})=2(r_{B}+r_{0})        r A is the radius of the A-cation.     Perovskite structure  The perovskite structure has the following tolerance factors (t):      Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t)   Structure   Explanation   Example   Example lattice       >1 6   Hexagonal   A ion too big or B ion too small.
