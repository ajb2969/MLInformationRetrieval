Goldschmidt tolerance factor
'''Goldschmidt's tolerance factor''' is an indicator for the stability and distortion of crystal structures.{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N-rXAAAAMAA

Alternatively the tolerance factor can be used to calculate the compatibility of an ion with a crystal structure.2
The first description of the tolerance factor for perovskite was made by Victor Moritz Goldschmidt in 1926.3
Mathematical expression
The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is a dimensionless number that is calculated from the ratio of the ionic radii:4










rA is the radius of the A-cation.



In an ideal cubic perovskite structure the axis of the unit cell (a) can be described with the following equation:5










rA is the radius of the A-cation.



Perovskite structure
The perovskite structure has the following tolerance factors (t):
