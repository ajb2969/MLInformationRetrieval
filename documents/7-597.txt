   Linear stability      Linear stability  In mathematics, in the theory of [[differential equations]] and [[dynamical systems]], a particular [[stationary state|stationary or quasistationary solution]] to a nonlinear system is called '''linearly unstable '''if the [[linearization]] of the equatio n at this solution has the form      d  r    d  t    =   A  r           d  r     d  t      A  r     \frac{dr}{dt}=Ar   , where A is a linear operator whose spectrum contains eigenvalues with positive real part. If all the eigenvalues have negative real part, then the solution is called linearly  stable . Other names for linear stability include exponential stability or stability in terms of first approximation . 1 2 If there exist an eigenvalue with zero real part then the question about stability cannot be solved on the basis of the first approximation and we approach the so-called "centre and focus problem". 3  Example 1: ODE  The differential equation        d  x    d  t    =   x  -   x  2            d  x     d  t      x   superscript  x  2      \frac{dx}{dt}=x-x^{2}   has two stationary (time-independent) solutions: x = 0 and x = 1. The linearization at x = 0 has the form      d  x    d  t    =  x          d  x     d  t    x    \frac{dx}{dt}=x   . The linearized operator is A 0 = 1. The only eigenvalue is    λ  =  1      λ  1    \lambda=1   . The solutions to this equation grow exponentially; the stationary point x = 0 is linearly unstable.  To derive the linearizaton at x = 1, one writes      d  r    d  t    =    (   1  +  r   )   -    (   1  +  r   )   2    =    -  r   -   r  2              d  r     d  t        1  r    superscript    1  r   2             r    superscript  r  2       \frac{dr}{dt}=(1+r)-(1+r)^{2}=-r-r^{2}   , where r = x − 1. The linearized equation is then      d  r    d  t    =   -  r           d  r     d  t      r     \frac{dr}{dt}=-r   ; the linearized operator is A 1 = −1, the only eigenvalue is    λ  =   -  1       λ    1     \lambda=-1   , hence this stationary point is linearly stable.  Example 2: NLS  The nonlinear Schrödinger equation       i    ∂  u    ∂  t     =    -     ∂  2   u    ∂   x  2      -     |  u  |    2  k    u          i      u     t             superscript   2   u      superscript  x  2         superscript    u     2  k    u      i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}-|u|^{2k}u   , where u ( x , t ) ∈ ℂ and k > 0, has solitary wave solutions of the form    ϕ   (  x  )    e   -   i  ω  t         ϕ  x   superscript  e      i  ω  t       \phi(x)e^{-i\omega t}   . 4 To derive the linearization at a solitary wave, one considers the solution in the form     u   (  x  ,  t  )    =    (    ϕ   (  x  )    +   r   (  x  ,  t  )     )    e   -   i  ω  t            u   x  t          ϕ  x     r   x  t      superscript  e      i  ω  t        u(x,t)=(\phi(x)+r(x,t))e^{-i\omega t}   . The linearized equation on    r   (  x  ,  t  )       r   x  t     r(x,t)   is given by         ∂   ∂  t     [       Re   r         Im   r      ]    =   A   [       Re   r         Im   r      ]     ,             t        Re  r       Im  r        A      Re  r       Im  r        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\begin{bmatrix}\text{Re}\,r\\
 \text{Im}\,r\end{bmatrix}=A\begin{bmatrix}\text{Re}\,r\\
 \text{Im}\,r\end{bmatrix},     where       A  =   [     0     L   ;  0         -   L  1      0     ]    ,      A    0   fragments  L   subscript  normal-;  0         subscript  L  1    0      A=\begin{bmatrix}0&L_{0}\\
 -L_{1}&0\end{bmatrix},     with       L  0   =    -   ∂   ∂   x  2      -   k   ϕ  2    -  ω        subscript  L  0             superscript  x  2        k   superscript  ϕ  2    ω     L_{0}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{2}}-k\phi^{2}-\omega     and       L  1   =    -   ∂   ∂   x  2      -    (    2  k   +  1   )    ϕ  2    -  ω        subscript  L  1             superscript  x  2            2  k   1    superscript  ϕ  2    ω     L_{1}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{2}}-(2k+1)\phi^{2}-\omega     the differential operators . According to Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion , 5 when k > 2, the spectrum of A has positive point eigenvalues, so that the linearized equation is linearly (exponentially) unstable; for 0  See also   Asymptotic stability  Linearization (stability analysis)  Lyapunov stability  Orbital stability  Stability theory  Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion   References    "  Category:Stability theory  Category:Solitons     V.I.
