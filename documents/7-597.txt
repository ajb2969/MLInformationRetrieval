Linear stability
In mathematics, in the theory of [[differential equations]] and [[dynamical systems]], a particular [[stationary state|stationary or quasistationary solution]] to a nonlinear system is called '''linearly unstable '''if the [[linearization]] of the equatio
 n at this solution has the form 
 
 
 
 , where A is a linear operator whose spectrum contains eigenvalues with positive real part. If all the eigenvalues have negative real part, then the solution is called linearly stable. Other names for linear stability include exponential stability or stability in terms of first approximation.12 If there exist an eigenvalue with zero real part then the question about stability cannot be solved on the basis of the first approximation and we approach the so-called "centre and focus problem".3
Example 1: ODE
The differential equation


 
  has two stationary (time-independent) solutions: x = 0 and x = 1. The linearization at x = 0 has the form 
 
 
 
 . The linearized operator is A0 = 1. The only eigenvalue is 
 
 
 
 . The solutions to this equation grow exponentially; the stationary point x = 0 is linearly unstable.
To derive the linearizaton at x = 1, one writes 
 
 
 
 , where r = x − 1. The linearized equation is then 
 
 
 
 ; the linearized operator is A1 = −1, the only eigenvalue is 
 
 
 
 , hence this stationary point is linearly stable.
Example 2: NLS
The nonlinear Schrödinger equation


 
 , where u(x,t) ∈ ℂ and k > 0, has solitary wave solutions of the form 
 
 
 
  .4 To derive the linearization at a solitary wave, one considers the solution in the form 
 
 
 
 . The linearized equation on 
 
 
 
  is given by

the differential operators. According to Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion ,5 when k > 2, the spectrum of A has positive point eigenvalues, so that the linearized equation is linearly (exponentially) unstable; for 0
