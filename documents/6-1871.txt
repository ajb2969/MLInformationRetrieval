Substring index

In computer science, a substring index is a data structure which gives substring search in a text or text collection in sublinear time. If you have a document 
 
 
 
  of length 
 
 
 
 , or a set of documents 
 
 
 
  of total length 
 
 
 
 , you can locate all occurrences of a pattern 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  time. (See Big O notation.)
The phrase full-text index is also often used for an index of all substrings of a text. But is ambiguous, as it is also used for regular word indexes such as inverted files and document retrieval. See full text search.
Substring indexes include:

Suffix tree
Suffix array
N-gram index, an inverted file for all N-grams of the text
Compressed suffix array1
FM-index
LZ-index
