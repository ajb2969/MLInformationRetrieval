   Substring index      Substring index   In computer science , a substring index is a data structure which gives substring search in a text or text collection in sublinear time. If you have a document   S   S   S   of length   n   n   n   , or a set of documents    D  =   {   S  1   ,   S  2   ,  …  ,   S  d   }       D    superscript  S  1    superscript  S  2   normal-…   superscript  S  d      D=\{S^{1},S^{2},\dots,S^{d}\}   of total length   n   n   n   , you can locate all occurrences of a pattern   P   P   P   in    o   (  n  )       o  n    o(n)   time. (See Big O notation .)  The phrase full-text index is also often used for an index of all substrings of a text. But is ambiguous, as it is also used for regular word indexes such as inverted files and document retrieval . See full text search .  Substring indexes include:   Suffix tree  Suffix array  N-gram index, an inverted file for all N-grams of the text  Compressed suffix array 1  FM-index  LZ-index   References  "  Category:Algorithms on strings  Category:String data structures  Category:Database index techniques       R.
