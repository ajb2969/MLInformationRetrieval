Small body orbiting a central body  The central body in an orbital system can be defined as the one whose mass ( M ) is much larger than the mass of the orbiting body ( m ), or . This approximation is standard for planets orbiting the Sun or most moons and greatly simplifies equations.  For a circular orbit around a central body:      μ  =   r   v  2    =    r  3    ω  2    =    4   π  2    r  3    /   T  2          μ    r   superscript  v  2            superscript  r  3    superscript  ω  2             4   superscript  π  2    superscript  r  3     superscript  T  2       \mu=rv^{2}=r^{3}\omega^{2}=4\pi^{2}r^{3}/T^{2}   where r is the orbit radius , v is the orbital speed , ω is the angular speed , and T is the orbital period .  This can be generalized for elliptic orbits :      μ  =    4   π  2    a  3    /   T  2        μ      4   superscript  π  2    superscript  a  3     superscript  T  2      \mu=4\pi^{2}a^{3}/T^{2}   where a is the semi-major axis , which is Kepler's third law .  For parabolic trajectories  rv 2 is constant and equal to 2 μ . For elliptic and hyperbolic orbits , where ε is the specific orbital energy .  Two bodies orbiting each other  In the more general case where the bodies need not be a large one and a small one (the two-body problem ), we define:   the vector r is the position of one body relative to the other  r , v , and in the case of an elliptic orbit , the semi-major axis  a , are defined accordingly (hence r is the distance)  μ = Gm 1 + Gm 2 = μ 1 + μ 2 , where m 1 and m 2 are the masses of the two bodies.   Then:   for circular orbits , rv 2 = r 3 ω 2 = 4π 2 r 3 / T 2 = μ  for elliptic orbits , (with a expressed in AU; T in seconds and M the total mass relative to that of the Sun, we get )  for parabolic trajectories , rv 2 is constant and equal to 2 μ  for elliptic and hyperbolic orbits, μ is twice the semi-major axis times the absolute value of the specific orbital energy , where the latter is defined as the total energy of the system divided by the reduced mass .   Terminology and accuracy  Note that the reduced mass is also denoted by μ .  The value for the Earth is called the geocentric gravitational constant and equals . Thus the uncertainty is 1 to , much smaller than the uncertainties in G and M separately (1 to  each).  The value for the Sun is called the heliocentric gravitational constant or geopotential of the Sun and equals .

Decoupling it into G and M must be done by measuring the force of gravity in sensitive laboratory conditions, as first done in the Cavendish experiment . ↩
