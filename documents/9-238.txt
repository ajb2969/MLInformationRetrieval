   Hexagonal pyramidal number      Hexagonal pyramidal number   A hexagonal pyramidal number is a pyramidal number formed by adding the first few hexagonal numbers . The first few of these numbers are:    , , , , , , , 372, 525, 715, 946, 1222, 1547, 1925 .    The n th number in this sequence is given by the formula        n   (   n  +  1   )    (    4  n   -  1   )    6   .        n    n  1       4  n   1    6    \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}.
