   Sheaf of spectra      Sheaf of spectra   In algebraic topology, a presheaf of spectra on a topological space  X is a contravariant functor from the category of open subsets of X , where morphisms are inclusions, to the good category of commutative ring spectra . A theorem of Jardine says that such presheaves form a simplicial model category , where F â†’ G is a weak equivalence if the induced map of homotopy sheaves  $\pi_* F \to \pi_* G$ is an isomorphism. A sheaf of spectra is then a fibrant/cofibrant object in that category.  The notion is used to define, for example, a derived scheme in algebraic geometry.
