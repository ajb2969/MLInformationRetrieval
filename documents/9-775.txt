   Wien bridge      Wien bridge   (Figure)  thumb| Wien bridge schematic, U wy - sinusoidal power supply voltage, U we - measured voltage   The Wien bridge is a type of bridge circuit that was developed by Max Wien in 1891. 1 The bridge comprises four resistors and two capacitors .  Bridge circuits were a common way of measuring component values by comparing them to known values. Often an unknown component would be put in one arm of a bridge, and then the bridge would be nulled by adjusting the other arms or changing the frequency of the voltage source. See, for example, the Wheatstone bridge .  The Wien bridge is one of many common bridges. 2 Wien's bridge is used for precison measurement of capacitance in terms of resistance and frequency. 3 It was also used to measure audio frequencies.  The Wien bridge does not require equal values of R or C . At some frequency, the reactance of the series R 2 –C 2 arm will be an exact multiple of the shunt R x –C x arm. If the two R 3 and R 4 arms are adjusted to the same ratio, then the bridge is balanced.  The bridge is balanced when: 4       ω  2   =   1    R  x    R  2    C  x    C  2          superscript  ω  2     1     subscript  R  x    subscript  R  2    subscript  C  x    subscript  C  2       \omega^{2}={1\over R_{x}R_{2}C_{x}C_{2}}   and       C  x    C  2    =     R  4    R  3    -     R  2    R  x       .         subscript  C  x    subscript  C  2         subscript  R  4    subscript  R  3       subscript  R  2    subscript  R  x       {C_{x}\over C_{2}}={R_{4}\over R_{3}}-{R_{2}\over R_{x}}\,.     The equations simplify if one chooses R 2 = R x and C 2 = C x ; the result is R 4 = 2 R 3 .  In practice, the values of R and C will never be exactly equal, but the equations above show that for fixed values in the 2 and x arms, the bridge will balance at some ω and some ratio of R 4 / R 3 .
