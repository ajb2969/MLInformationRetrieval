   TRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase      TRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA containing uridine at position 54   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing ribothymidine at position 54   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA containing uridine at position 54, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing ribothymidine at position 54.  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include ribothymidyl synthase , transfer RNA uracil 5-methyltransferase , transfer RNA uracil methylase , tRNA uracil 5-methyltransferase , m5U-methyltransferase , tRNA:m5U54-methyltransferase , and RUMT .
