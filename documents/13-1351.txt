   Differential group delay      Differential group delay   In optics , differential group delay is the difference in propagation time between the two eigenmodes  X and Y  polarizations . Consider two eigenmodes that are the 0° and 90° linear  polarization states. If the state of polarization of the input signal is the linear state at 45° between the two eigenmodes, the input signal is divided equally into the two eigenmodes. The power of the transmitted signal  E T ,total is the combination of the transmitted signals of both x and y modes.       E  T   =     (    E   i  ,  x    ⋅   t  x    )   2   +     (    E   i  ,  y    ⋅   t  y    )   2          subscript  E  T      superscript   normal-⋅   subscript  E   i  x     subscript  t  x    2    superscript   normal-⋅   subscript  E   i  y     subscript  t  y    2      E_{T}=(E_{i,x}\cdot t_{x})^{2}+(E_{i,y}\cdot t_{y})^{2}\,     The differential group delay D t is defined as the difference in propagation time between the eigenmodes: D t = | t t , x − t t , y |.
