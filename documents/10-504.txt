   Farnesol dehydrogenase      Farnesol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a farnesol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-trans,6-trans-farnesol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-trans,6-trans-farnesal + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-trans,6-trans-farnesol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 2-trans,6-trans-farnesal , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-trans,6-trans-farnesol:NADP + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADP + -farnesol dehydrogenase , and farnesol (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) dehydrogenase .
