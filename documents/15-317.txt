   Conway group Co3      Conway group Co3     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Conway group  Co 3 is a sporadic simple group of order   2 10 {{·}}3 7 {{·}}5 3 {{·}}7{{·}}11{{·}}23  = 495766656000  ≈ 5     ×    10  1   1       absent     superscript  10  1   1     \times 10^{1}1   .   History and properties  Co 3 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered by  as the group of automorphisms of the Leech lattice Λ fixing a lattice vector of type 3, thus length √ 6.  The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial .  Representations  Co 3 acts on the unique 23-dimensional even lattice of determinant 4 with no roots, given by the orthogonal complement of a norm 4 vector of the Leech lattice. This gives 23-dimensional representations over any field; over fields of characteristic 2 or 3 this can be reduced to a 22-dimensional faithful representation.  Co 3 has a doubly transitive permutation representation on 276 points.  showed that if a finite group has an absolutely irreducible faithful rational representation of dimension 23 and has no subgroups of index 23 or 24 then it is contained in either Z /2 Z × Co 2 or Z /2 Z × Co 3 .  Generalized Monstrous Moonshine  In analogy to monstrous moonshine for the monster M , for Co 3 , the relevant McKay-Thompson series is     T   4  A     (  τ  )        subscript  T    4  A    τ    T_{4A}(\tau)   where one can set the constant term a(0) = 24 (),       j   4  A     (  τ  )        subscript  j    4  A    τ    \displaystyle j_{4A}(\tau)     and η ( τ ) is the Dedekind eta function .  Maximal subgroups  found the 14 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Co 3 as follows:   McL:2 – can transpose type 2 points of conserved 2-2-3 triangle. Co 3 has a doubly transitive permutation representation on 276 type 2-2-3 triangles containing a fixed type 3 point.  HS – fixes 2-3-3 triangle.
