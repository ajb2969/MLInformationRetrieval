History and properties
Co3 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered by  as the group of automorphisms of the Leech lattice Λ fixing a lattice vector of type 3, thus length √ 6.
The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial.
Representations
Co3 acts on the unique 23-dimensional even lattice of determinant 4 with no roots, given by the orthogonal complement of a norm 4 vector of the Leech lattice. This gives 23-dimensional representations over any field; over fields of characteristic 2 or 3 this can be reduced to a 22-dimensional faithful representation.
Co3 has a doubly transitive permutation representation on 276 points.
showed that if a finite group has an absolutely irreducible faithful rational representation of dimension 23 and has no subgroups of index 23 or 24 then it is contained in either Z/2Z × Co2 or Z/2Z × Co3.
Generalized Monstrous Moonshine
In analogy to monstrous moonshine for the monster M, for Co3, the relevant McKay-Thompson series is 
 
 
 
  where one can set the constant term a(0) = 24 (),



and η(τ) is the Dedekind eta function.
Maximal subgroups
found the 14 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Co3 as follows:

McL:2 – can transpose type 2 points of conserved 2-2-3 triangle. Co3 has a doubly transitive permutation representation on 276 type 2-2-3 triangles containing a fixed type 3 point.
HS – fixes 2-3-3 triangle.
