Paraboloidal coordinates

Paraboloidal coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system

 
  that generalizes the two-dimensional parabolic coordinate system. Similar to the related ellipsoidal coordinates, the paraboloidal coordinate system has orthogonal quadratic coordinate surfaces that are not produced by rotating or projecting any two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system.

Basic formulae
The Cartesian coordinates 
 
 
 
  can be produced from the ellipsoidal coordinates 
 
 
 
  by the equations









where the following limits apply to the coordinates



Consequently, surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are elliptic paraboloids



and surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are likewise



whereas surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are hyperbolic paraboloids



Scale factors
The scale factors for the paraboloidal coordinates 
 
 
 
  are









Hence, the infinitesimal volume element equals



Differential operators such as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in the coordinates 
 
 
 
  by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates.
