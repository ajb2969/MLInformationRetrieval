   Hydrogenase (NAD+, ferredoxin)      Hydrogenase (NAD+, ferredoxin)   Hydrogenase (NAD+, ferredoxin) (, bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase ) is an enzyme with system name hydrogen:NAD + , ferredoxin oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 H 2 + NAD + + 2 oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5 H + + NADH + 2 reduced ferredoxin   The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima contains a [Fe-Fe] cluster (H-cluster) and iron-sulfur clusters.
