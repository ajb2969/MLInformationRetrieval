Hydrogenase (NAD+, ferredoxin)

Hydrogenase (NAD+, ferredoxin) (, bifurcating [FeFe] hydrogenase) is an enzyme with system name hydrogen:NAD+, ferredoxin oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 H2 + NAD+ + 2 oxidized ferredoxin 
 
 
 
  5 H+ + NADH + 2 reduced ferredoxin
 

The enzyme from Thermotoga maritima contains a [Fe-Fe] cluster (H-cluster) and iron-sulfur clusters. I
