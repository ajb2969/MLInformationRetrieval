Gregory–Laflamme instability

Black String solutions in theories of gravity in higher dimensions 
 
 
 
  are found to exhibit an instability to small perturbations. This was first discovered by Gregory and Laflamme in 1993.1 It is very interesting to know the end point of this instability, particularly whether it leads to a phase transition forming a black hole. This has been studied to higher dimensions and a critical dimension has been found to exist below which the end state of instability is a black hole phase, i.e., for 
 
 
 
 . Above the critical dimension the instability drives to a non-uniform black ring phase.2
