   Gregory–Laflamme instability      Gregory–Laflamme instability   Black String solutions in theories of gravity in higher dimensions    D  ≥  5      D  5    D\geq 5   are found to exhibit an instability to small perturbations. This was first discovered by Gregory and Laflamme in 1993. 1 It is very interesting to know the end point of this instability, particularly whether it leads to a phase transition forming a black hole . This has been studied to higher dimensions and a critical dimension has been found to exist below which the end state of instability is a black hole phase, i.e., for    5  ≤  D  ≤  13        5  D       13     5\leq D\leq 13   . Above the critical dimension the instability drives to a non-uniform black ring phase. 2  References  "  Category:Gravitation     http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9301052 ↩  http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0411240 ↩
