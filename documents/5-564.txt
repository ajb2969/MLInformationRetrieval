   Harnack's principle      Harnack's principle   In complex analysis , Harnack's principle or Harnack's theorem is one of several closely related theorems about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions , that follow from Harnack's inequality .  If the functions      u  1    (  z  )        subscript  u  1   z    u_{1}(z)   ,     u  2    (  z  )        subscript  u  2   z    u_{2}(z)   , ... are harmonic in an open connected subset    G   G   G   of the complex plane  C , and        u  1    (  z  )    ≤    u  2    (  z  )    ≤  …           subscript  u  1   z      subscript  u  2   z        normal-…     u_{1}(z)\leq u_{2}(z)\leq...   in every point of   G   G   G   , then the limit       lim   n  →  ∞      u  n    (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  u  n   z     \lim_{n\to\infty}u_{n}(z)   either is infinite in every point of the domain    G   G   G   or it is finite in every point of the domain, in both cases uniformly in each compact subset of   G   G   G   . In the latter case, the function       u   (  z  )    =    lim   n  →  ∞      u  n    (  z  )           u  z     subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  u  n   z      u(z)=\lim_{n\to\infty}u_{n}(z)   is harmonic in the set   G   G   G   .
