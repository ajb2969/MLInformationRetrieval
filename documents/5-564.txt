Harnack's principle

In complex analysis, Harnack's principle or Harnack's theorem is one of several closely related theorems about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions, that follow from Harnack's inequality.
If the functions

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... are harmonic in an open connected subset

 
  of the complex plane C, and


 
  in every point of 
 
 
 
 , then the limit


 
  either is infinite in every point of the domain

 
  or it is finite in every point of the domain, in both cases uniformly in each compact subset of 
 
 
 
 . In the latter case, the function


 
  is harmonic in the set 
 
 
 
 .
