   Glutamate 1-kinase      Glutamate 1-kinase   In enzymology , a glutamate 1-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + alpha-L-glutamyl phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-glutamate , whereas its two products are ADP and alpha-L-glutamyl phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-glutamate 1-phosphotransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
