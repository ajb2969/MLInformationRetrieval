Entropy of entanglement

The entropy of entanglement is an entanglement measure for many-body quantum state.
Bipartite entanglement entropy
Bipartite entanglement entropy is defined with respect to a bipartition of a state into two partitions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Von Neumann entanglement entropy
The bipartite Von Neumann entanglement entropy 
 
 
 
  is defined as the Von Neumann entropy of either of its reduced states; the result is independent of which one we pick. That is, for a pure state 
 
 
 
 , it is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the reduced density matrices for each partition.
Many entanglement measures reduce to the entropy of entanglement when evaluated on pure states. Among those are:

Distillable entanglement
Entanglement cost
Entanglement of formation
Relative entropy of entanglement
Squashed entanglement

Some entanglement measures that do not reduce to the entropy of entanglement are:

Negativity
Logarithmic negativity
Robustness of entanglement1

Renyi entanglement entropies
The Renyi entanglement entropies 
 
 
 
  are also defined in terms of the reduced density matrices, and a Renyi index 
 
 
 
 . It is defined as the RÃ©nyi entropy of the reduced density matrices:



Note that the limit 
 
 
 
 , The Renyi entanglement entropy approaches the Von Neumann entanglement entropy.
Area law of bipartite entanglement entropy
A quantum state satisfies an area law if the leading term of the entanglement entropy grows at most proportionally with the boundary between the two partitions. Area laws are remarkably common for ground states of quantum many-body systems. This has important applications, one such application being that it greatly reduces the complexity of quantum many-body systems. The density matrix renormalization group and matrix product states, for example, implicitly rely on such area laws. 2
