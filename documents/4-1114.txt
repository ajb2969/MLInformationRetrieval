   Normal extension      Normal extension   In abstract algebra , an algebraic field extension  L / K is said to be normal if L is the splitting field of a family of polynomials in K [ X ]. Bourbaki calls such an extension a quasi- Galois extension .  Equivalent properties and examples  The normality of L / K is equivalent to either of the following properties. Let K a be an algebraic closure of K containing L .   Every embedding œÉ of L in K a that restricts to the identity on K , satisfies œÉ( L )¬†= L . In other words, œÉ is an automorphism of L over K .  Every irreducible polynomial in K [ X ] that has one root in L , has all of its roots in L , that is, it decomposes into linear factors in L [ X ]. (One says that the polynomial splits in L .)   If L is a finite extension of K that is separable (for example, this is automatically satisfied if K is finite or has characteristic zero) then the following property is also equivalent:   There exists an irreducible polynomial whose roots, together with the elements of K , generate L . (One says that L is the splitting field for the polynomial.)   For example,    ‚Ñö   (   2   )       ‚Ñö    2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})   is a normal extension of   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   , since it is a splitting field of x 2 ‚àí¬†2. On the other hand,    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )       ‚Ñö     3   2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   is not a normal extension of   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   since the irreducible polynomial x 3 ‚àí¬†2 has one root in it (namely,    2  3       3   2    \sqrt[3]{2}   ), but not all of them (it does not have the non-real cubic roots of¬†2).  The fact that    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )       ‚Ñö     3   2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   is not a normal extension of   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   can also be seen using the first of the three properties above. The field   ùî∏   ùî∏   \mathbb{A}   of algebraic numbers is an algebraic closure of   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   containing    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )       ‚Ñö     3   2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   . On the other hand       ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )    =   {    a  +   b   2  3    +   c   4  3     ‚àà   ùî∏    |    a  ,  b  ,  c   ‚àà  ‚Ñö   }         ‚Ñö     3   2     conditional-set      a    b     3   2      c     3   4     ùî∏      a  b  c   ‚Ñö      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})=\{a+b\sqrt[3]{2}+c\sqrt[3]{4}\in\mathbb{A}\,|\,a,b,c%
 \in\mathbb{Q}\}   and, if œâ is one of the two non-real cubic roots of 2, then the map         œÉ  :       ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )      ‚ü∂    ùî∏        a  ;    +   b   2  3     +   c   4  3        ‚Ü¶     a  ;    +   b  œâ   2  3     +   c   œâ  2    4  3             normal-:  œÉ  absent     ‚Ñö     3   2    normal-‚ü∂  ùî∏     missing-subexpression    a        b     3   2       c     3   4      maps-to   a        b  œâ     3   2       c   superscript  œâ  2      3   4         \begin{array}[]{rccc}\sigma:&\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})&\longrightarrow&\mathbb{A%
 }\\
 &a+b\sqrt[3]{2}+c\sqrt[3]{4}&\mapsto&a+b\omega\sqrt[3]{2}+c\omega^{2}\sqrt[3%
 ]{4}\end{array}   is an embedding of    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )       ‚Ñö     3   2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   in   ùî∏   ùî∏   \mathbb{A}   whose restriction to   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   is the identity. However, œÉ is not an automorphism of    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )       ‚Ñö     3   2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   .  For any prime p , the extension    ‚Ñö   (   2  p   ,   Œ∂  p   )       ‚Ñö      p   2    subscript  Œ∂  p      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{2},\zeta_{p})   is normal of degree p ( p ‚àí¬†1). It is a splitting field of x p ‚àí¬†2. Here    Œ∂  p     subscript  Œ∂  p    \zeta_{p}   denotes any p th primitive root of unity . The field    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   ,   Œ∂  3   )       ‚Ñö      3   2    subscript  Œ∂  3      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\zeta_{3})   is the normal closure (see below) of    ‚Ñö   (   2  3   )       ‚Ñö     3   2     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})   .  Other properties  Let L be an extension of a field K . Then:   If L is a normal extension of K and if E is an intermediate extension (i.e., L ‚äÉ E ‚äÉ K ), then L is a normal extension of E .    If E and F are normal extensions of K contained in L , then the compositum  EF and E ‚à© F are also normal extensions of K .   Normal closure  If K is a field and L is an algebraic extension of K , then there is some algebraic extension M of L such that M is a normal extension of K . Furthermore, up to isomorphism there is only one such extension which is minimal, i.e. such that the only subfield of M which contains L and which is a normal extension of K is M itself. This extension is called the normal closure of the extension L of K .  If L is a finite extension of K , then its normal closure is also a finite extension.
