UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase




UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase

In enzymology, an UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphoenolpyruvate + UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 
 
 
 
  phosphate + UDP-N-acetyl-3-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-D-glucosamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate and UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, whereas its two products are phosphate and UDP-N-acetyl-3-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-D-glucosamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate:UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase.1 This enzyme participates in amino sugars metabolism and glycan biosynthesis.
