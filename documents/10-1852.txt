Malonate CoA-transferase




Malonate CoA-transferase

In enzymology, a malonate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + malonate 
 
 
 
  acetate + malonyl-CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and malonate, whereas its two products are acetate and malonyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:malonate CoA-transferase. This enzyme is also called malonate coenzyme A-transferase. This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism and propanoate metabolism.
