   Dihydrouracil oxidase      Dihydrouracil oxidase   In enzymology , a dihydrouracil oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,6-dihydrouracil + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6-dihydrouracil and O 2 , whereas its two products are uracil and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6-dihydrouracil:oxygen oxidoreductase . It employs one cofactor , FMN .
