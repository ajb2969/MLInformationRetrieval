   Free field      Free field   In physics a free field is a field  without interactions , which is described by the terms of motion and mass.  Description  In classical physics , a free field is a field whose equations of motion are given by linear  partial differential equations . Such linear PDE's have a unique solution for a given initial condition.  In quantum field theory , an operator valued distribution is a free field if it satisfies some linear partial differential equations such that the corresponding case of the same linear PDEs for a classical field (i.e. not an operator) would be the Euler–Lagrange equation for some quadratic  Lagrangian . We can differentiate distributions by defining their derivatives via differentiated test functions . See Schwartz distribution for more details. Since we are dealing not with ordinary distributions but operator valued distributions, it is understood these PDEs aren't constraints on states but instead a description of the relations among the smeared fields. Beside the PDEs, the operators also satisfy another relation, the commutation/anticommutation relations.  Canonical Commutation Relation  Basically, commutator (for bosons )/ anticommutator (for fermions ) of two smeared fields is i times the Peierls bracket of the field with itself (which is really a distribution, not a function) for the PDEs smeared over both test functions. This has the form of a CCR/CAR algebra .  CCR/CAR algebras with infinitely many degrees of freedom have many inequivalent irreducible unitary representations. If the theory is defined over Minkowski space , we may choose the unitary irrep containing a vacuum state although that isn't always necessary.  Example  Let φ be an operator valued distribution and the (Klein–Gordon) PDE be          ∂  μ    ∂  μ    ϕ   +    m  2   ϕ    =  0           superscript   μ    subscript   μ    ϕ      superscript  m  2   ϕ    0    \partial^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\phi+m^{2}\phi=0   .  This is a bosonic field. Let's call the distribution given by the Peierls bracket Δ.  Then,       {   ϕ   (  x  )    ,   ϕ   (  y  )    }   =   Δ   (  x  ;  y  )           ϕ  x     ϕ  y      normal-Δ   x  y      \{\phi(x),\phi(y)\}=\Delta(x;y)     where here, φ is a classical field and {,} is the Peierls bracket.  Then, the canonical commutation relation is       [   ϕ   [  f  ]    ,   ϕ   [  g  ]    ]   =   i  Δ   [  f  ,  g  ]           ϕ   delimited-[]  f      ϕ   delimited-[]  g       i  normal-Δ   f  g      [\phi[f],\phi[g]]=i\Delta[f,g]\,   .  Note that Δ is a distribution over two arguments, and so, can be smeared as well.  Equivalently, we could have insisted that       𝒯   {   [    (    (     ∂  μ    ∂  μ    +   m  2    )   ϕ   )    [  f  ]    ,   ϕ   [  g  ]    ]   }    =   -   i   ∫    d  d   x  f   (  x  )   g   (  x  )             𝒯            superscript   μ    subscript   μ     superscript  m  2    ϕ    delimited-[]  f      ϕ   delimited-[]  g           i       superscript  d  d   x  f  x  g  x        \mathcal{T}\{[((\partial^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}+m^{2})\phi)[f],\phi[g]]\}=-i\int d%
 ^{d}xf(x)g(x)     where   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   is the time ordering operator and that if the supports of f and g are spacelike separated,       [   ϕ   [  f  ]    ,   ϕ   [  g  ]    ]   =  0         ϕ   delimited-[]  f      ϕ   delimited-[]  g     0    [\phi[f],\phi[g]]=0   .
