   N-substituted formamide deformylase      N-substituted formamide deformylase   In enzymology , a N-substituted formamide deformylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-benzylformamide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + benzylamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-benzylformamide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are formate and benzylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-benzylformamide amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called NfdA .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
