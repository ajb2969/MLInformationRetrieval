   Lawrence C. Washington      Lawrence C. Washington   Lawrence Clinton Washington (born 1951, Vermont ) is an American mathematician, who specializes in number theory.  Biography  Washington studied at Johns Hopkins University , where in 1971 he received his B.A. and masters degree. In 1974 he earned his PhD at Princeton University under Kenkichi Iwasawa with thesis Class numbers and    Z  p     subscript  Z  p    Z_{p}   extensions . 1 He then became an assistant professor at Stanford University and from 1977 at the University of Maryland , where he became in 1981 an associate professor and in 1986 a professor. He held visiting positions at several institutions, including IHES (1980/81), Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik (1984), the Institute for Advanced Study (1996), and MSRI (1986/87), as well as at the University of Perugia , Nankai University and the State University of Campinas .  Washington wrote a standard work on cyclotomic fields . He also worked on p-adic  L-functions . He wrote a treatise with Allan Adler on their discovery of a connection between higher-dimensional analogues of magic squares and p-adic L-functions. 2 Washington has done important work on Iwasawa theory , Cohen - Lenstra heuristics, and elliptic curves and their applications to cryptography .  In Iwasawa theory he proved with Bruce Ferrero in 1979 a conjecture of Kenkichi Iwasawa , that the   μ   μ   \mu   -invariant vanishes for cyclotomic Z p -extensions of abelian number fields ( Theorem of Ferrero-Washington ). 3  In 1979–1981 he was a Sloan Fellow .
