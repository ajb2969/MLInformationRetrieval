Steinhaus–Moser notation

In mathematics, Steinhaus–Moser notation is a notation for expressing certain extremely large numbers. It is an extension of Steinhaus's polygon notation.
Definitions

20px|n in a triangle a number  in a triangle means .
 


20px|n in a square a number  in a square is equivalent to "the number  inside  triangles, which are all nested."
 


20px|n in a pentagon a number  in a pentagon is equivalent with "the number  inside  squares, which are all nested."
 

etc.:  written in an ()-sided polygon is equivalent with "the number  inside  nested -sided polygons". In a series of nested polygons, they are associated inward. The number  inside two triangles is equivalent to  inside one triangle, which is equivalent to  raised to the power of .
Steinhaus only defined the triangle, the square, and a circle 20px|n in a circle, equivalent to the pentagon defined above.
Special values
Steinhaus defined:

mega is the number equivalent to 2 in a circle: 
megiston is the number equivalent to 10 in a circle: ⑩

Moser's number is the number represented by "2 in a megagon", where a megagon is a polygon with "mega" sides.
Alternative notations:

use the functions square(x) and triangle(x)
let  be the number represented by the number  in  nested -sided polygons; then the rules are:
 










and
 
mega = 
 
 

megiston = 
 
 

moser = 
 
 



Mega
A mega, ②, is already a very large number, since ② = square(square(2)) = square(triangle(triangle(2))) = square(triangle(22)) = square(triangle(4)) = square(44) = square(256) = triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256)...))) [256 triangles] = triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256256)...))) [255 triangles] ~ triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(3.2 × 10616)...))) [254 triangles] = ...
Using the other notation:
mega = M(2,1,5) = M(256,256,3)
With the function 
 
 
 
  we have mega = 
 
 
 
  where the superscript denotes a functional power, not a numerical power.
We have (note the convention that powers are evaluated from right to left):

M(256,2,3) = 
 
 

M(256,3,3) = 
 
 
 
 ≈
 
 


Similarly:

M(256,4,3) ≈ 
 
 

M(256,5,3) ≈ 
 
 


etc.
Thus:

mega = 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes a functional power of the function 
 
 
 
 .

Rounding more crudely (replacing the 257 at the end by 256), we get mega ≈ 
 
 
 
 , using Knuth's up-arrow notation.
After the first few steps the value of 
 
 
 
  is each time approximately equal to 
 
 
 
 . In fact, it is even approximately equal to 
 
 
 
  (see also approximate arithmetic for very large numbers). Using base 10 powers we get:






 
  (
 
 
 
  is added to the 616)


 
  (
 
 
 
  is added to the 
 
 
 
 , which is negligible; therefore just a 10 is added at the bottom)






...

mega = 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes a functional power of the function 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 


Moser's number
It has been proven that in Conway chained arrow notation,



and, in Knuth's up-arrow notation,



Therefore Moser's number, although incomprehensibly large, is vanishingly small compared to Graham's number:
