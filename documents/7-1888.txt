Perron's formula

In mathematics, and more particularly in analytic number theory, Perron's formula is a formula due to Oskar Perron to calculate the sum of an arithmetical function, by means of an inverse Mellin transform.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be an arithmetic function, and let



be the corresponding Dirichlet series. Presume the Dirichlet series to be uniformly convergent for 
 
 
 
 . Then Perron's formula is



Here, the prime on the summation indicates that the last term of the sum must be multiplied by 1/2 when x is an integer. The integral is not a convergent Lebesgue integral, it is understood as the Cauchy principal value. The formula requires c > 0, c > Ïƒ, and x > 0 real, but otherwise arbitrary.
Proof
An easy sketch of the proof comes from taking Abel's sum formula



This is nothing but a Laplace transform under the variable change 
 
 
 
  Inverting it one gets Perron's formula.
Examples
Because of its general relationship to Dirichlet series, the formula is commonly applied to many number-theoretic sums. Thus, for example, one has the famous integral representation for the Riemann zeta function:



and a similar formula for Dirichlet L-functions:



where



and 
 
 
 
  is a Dirichlet character. Other examples appear in the articles on the Mertens function and the von Mangoldt function.
