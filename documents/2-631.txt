   Synchrotron radiation      Synchrotron radiation   The electromagnetic radiation emitted when charged particles are accelerated radially (    𝐚  ⟂  𝐯     perpendicular-to  𝐚  𝐯    \mathbf{a}\perp\mathbf{v}   ) is called synchrotron radiation. It is produced, for example, in synchrotrons using bending magnets, undulators and/or wigglers . It is similar to cyclotron radiation except that synchrotron radiation is generated by the acceleration of ultrarelativistic charged particles through magnetic fields. Synchrotron radiation may be achieved artificially in synchrotrons or storage rings , or naturally by fast electrons moving through magnetic fields. The radiation produced in this way has a characteristic polarization and the frequencies generated can range over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .    History  Synchrotron radiation was named after its discovery in a General Electric synchrotron accelerator built in 1946 and announced in May 1947 by Frank Elder, Anatole Gurewitsch, Robert Langmuir, and Herb Pollock in a letter entitled "Radiation from Electrons in a Synchrotron". 1 Pollock recounts:   "On April 24, Langmuir and I were running the machine and as usual were trying to push the electron gun and its associated pulse transformer to the limit. Some intermittent sparking had occurred and we asked the technician to observe with a mirror around the protective concrete wall. He immediately signaled to turn off the synchrotron as "he saw an arc in the tube." The vacuum was still excellent, so Langmuir and I came to the end of the wall and observed. At first we thought it might be due to Cherenkov radiation , but it soon became clearer that we were seeing Ivanenko and Pomeranchuk radiation." 2    Properties of synchrotron radiation   Broad Spectrum (which covers from microwaves to hard X-rays): the users can select the wavelength required for their experiment.  High Flux: high intensity photon beam allows rapid experiments or use of weakly scattering crystals.  High Brilliance: highly collimated photon beam generated by a small divergence and small size source (spatial coherence)  High Stability: submicron source stability  Polarization: both linear and circular  Pulsed Time Structure: pulsed length down to tens of picoseconds allows the resolution of process on the same time scale.   Emission mechanism  When high-energy particles are in rapid motion, including electrons forced to travel in a curved path by a magnetic field , synchrotron radiation is produced. This is similar to a radio antenna, but with the difference that, in theory, the relativistic speed will change the observed frequency due to the Doppler effect by the Lorentz factor ,   γ   γ   \gamma   . Relativistic length contraction then bumps the frequency observed in the lab by another factor of   γ   γ   \gamma   , thus multiplying the GHz frequency of the resonant cavity that accelerates the electrons into the X-ray range. The radiated power is given by the relativistic Larmor formula while the force on the emitting electron is given by the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force . The radiation pattern can be distorted from an isotropic dipole pattern into an extremely forward-pointing cone of radiation. Synchrotron radiation is the brightest artificial source of X-rays. The planar acceleration geometry appears to make the radiation linearly polarized when observed in the orbital plane, and circularly polarized when observed at a small angle to that plane. Amplitude and frequency are however focussed to the polar ecliptic.  Synchrotron radiation from accelerators  Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance, causing undesired energy loss in particle physics contexts, or as a deliberately produced radiation source for numerous laboratory applications. Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that is typically in the GeV range. In the LHC proton bunches also produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate with respect to the vacuum field, propagating photoelectrons, which in turn propagate secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x10 10 . Each proton may lose 6.7keV per turn due to this phenomenon. 3  Synchrotron radiation in astronomy  Synchrotron radiation is also generated by astronomical objects, typically where relativistic electrons spiral (and hence change velocity) through magnetic fields. Two of its characteristics include non-thermal power-law spectra, and polarization. 4  History of detection  It was first detected in a jet emitted by Messier 87 in 1956 by Geoffrey R. Burbidge , 5 who saw it as confirmation of a prediction by Iosif S. Shklovsky in 1953, but it had been predicted earlier by Hannes Alfvén and Nicolai Herlofson 6 in 1950.  T. K. Breus noted that questions of priority on the history of astrophysical synchrotron radiation is complicated, writing:   "In particular, the Russian physicist V.L. Ginzburg broke his relationships with I.S. Shklovsky and did not speak with him for 18 years. In the West, Thomas Gold and Sir Fred Hoyle were in dispute with H. Alfven and N. Herlofson, while K.O. Kiepenheuer and G. Hutchinson were ignored by them." 7     Supermassive black holes have been suggested for producing synchrotron radiation, by ejection of jets produced by gravitationally accelerating ions through the super contorted 'tubular' polar areas of magnetic fields. Such jets, the nearest being in Messier 87, have been confirmed by the Hubble telescope as apparently superluminal , travelling at 6×c (six times the speed of light) from our planetary frame. This phenomenon is caused because the jets are travelling very near the speed of light and at a very small angle towards the observer. Because at every point of their path the high-velocity jets are emitting light, the light they emit does not approach the observer much more quickly than the jet itself. Light emitted over hundreds of years of travel thus arrives at the observer over a much smaller time period (ten or twenty years) giving the illusion of faster than light travel. There is no violation of special relativity . 8  Pulsar wind nebulae  A class of astronomical sources where synchrotron emission is important is the pulsar wind nebulae , a.k.a. plerions , of which the Crab nebula and its associated pulsar are archetypal. Pulsed emission gamma-ray radiation from the Crab has recently been observed up to ≥25 GeV, 9 probably due to synchrotron emission by electrons trapped in the strong magnetic field around the pulsar. Polarization in the Crab 10 at energies from 0.1 to 1.0 MeV illustrates a typical synchrotron radiation.

The higher the critical energy, the more photons with high energies are generated. Note that, there is no dependence on the energy at longer wavelength.  Polarization of synchrotron radiation  In Eq.(10), the first term     K   2  /  3   2    (  ξ  )        superscript   subscript  K    2  3    2   ξ    K_{2/3}^{2}(\xi)   is the radiation power with polarization in the orbit plane, and the second term       γ  2    θ  2     1  +    γ  2    θ  2       K   1  /  3   2    (  ξ  )            superscript  γ  2    superscript  θ  2      1     superscript  γ  2    superscript  θ  2       superscript   subscript  K    1  3    2   ξ    \frac{\gamma^{2}\theta^{2}}{1+\gamma^{2}\theta^{2}}K_{1/3}^{2}(\xi)   is the polarization orthogonal to the orbit plane. In the orbit plane    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   , the polarization is purely horizontal. Integrating on all frequencies, we get the angular distribution of the energy radiated         \frac{d^2 W}{d\Omega }=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{d^3W}{d\omega d\Omega }d\omega =\frac{7e^2 \gamma^5}{64\pi\varepsilon_0\rho}\frac{1}{(1+\gamma^2\theta^2)^{5/2}}\left [1+\frac{5}{7}\frac{\gamma^2\theta^2}{1+\gamma^2\theta^2} \right ] \qquad (12)  Integrating on all the angles, we find that seven times as much energy is radiated with parallel polarization as with perpendicular polarization. The radiation from a relativistically moving charge is very strongly, but not completely, polarized in the plane of motion.
