Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase

Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase (, PHOSPHO1, 3X11A) is an enzyme highly expressed in mineralizing cells with system name phosphoethanolamine phosphohydrolase.123 This enzyme is implicated in bone and cartilage formation and catalyses the following chemical reactions:

(1) O-phosphoethanolamine + H2O 
 
 
ethanolamine + phosphate

(2) phosphocholine + H2O 
 
 
choline + phosphate
 

The enzyme is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Like other members of this superfamily it requires a metal ion for catalysis, which is usually Mg2+. PHOSPHO1 is also active in the presence of Co2+ or Mn2+ but exhibits a lower specific activity with these metal ions.
