   Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase      Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase   Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase (, PHOSPHO1 , 3X11A ) is an enzyme highly expressed in mineralizing cells with system name phosphoethanolamine phosphohydrolase . 1 2 3 This enzyme is implicated in bone and cartilage formation and catalyses the following chemical reactions :   (1) O-phosphoethanolamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    ethanolamine + phosphate   (2) phosphocholine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    choline + phosphate   The enzyme is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Like other members of this superfamily it requires a metal ion for catalysis, which is usually Mg 2+ . PHOSPHO1 is also active in the presence of Co 2+ or Mn 2+ but exhibits a lower specific activity with these metal ions.  References  External links     "  Category:EC 3.1.3     ↩  ↩  ↩
