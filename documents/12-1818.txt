   Pseudorandom generators for polynomials      Pseudorandom generators for polynomials   In theoretical computer science , a pseudorandom generator for low-degree polynomials is an efficient procedure that maps a short truly random seed to a longer pseudorandom string in such a way that low-degree polynomials cannot distinguish the output distribution of the generator from the truly random distribution. That is, evaluating any low-degree polynomial at a point determined by the pseudorandom string is statistically close to evaluating the same polynomial at a point that is chosen uniformly at random.  Pseudorandom generators for low-degree polynomials are a particular instance of pseudorandom generators for statistical tests, where the statistical tests considered are evaluations of low-degree polynomials.  Definition  A pseudorandom generator    G  :    𝔽  ℓ   →   𝔽  n       normal-:  G   normal-→   superscript  𝔽  normal-ℓ    superscript  𝔽  n      G:\mathbb{F}^{\ell}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}^{n}   for polynomials of degree   d   d   d   over a finite field    𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   is an efficient procedure that maps a sequence of   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   field elements to a sequence of   n   n   n   field elements such that any   n   n   n   -variate polynomial over   𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   of degree   d   d   d   is fooled by the output distribution of   G   G   G   . In other words, for every such polynomial    p   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       p    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      p(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   , the statistical distance between the distributions    p   (   U  n   )       p   subscript  U  n     p(U_{n})   and    p   (   G   (   U  ℓ   )    )       p    G   subscript  U  normal-ℓ      p(G(U_{\ell}))   is at most a small   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   , where    U  k     subscript  U  k    U_{k}   is the uniform distribution over    𝔽  k     superscript  𝔽  k    \mathbb{F}^{k}   .  Construction  The case    d  =  1      d  1    d=1   corresponds to pseudorandom generators for linear functions and is solved by small-bias generators . For example, the construction of  achieves a seed length of    ℓ  =    log  n   +   O   (   log   (   ϵ   -  1    )    )         normal-ℓ      n     O     superscript  ϵ    1         \ell=\log n+O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))   , which is optimal up to constant factors.  conjectured that the sum of small-bias generators fools low-degree polynomials and were able to prove this under the Gowers inverse conjecture .  proved unconditionally that the sum of    2  d     superscript  2  d    2^{d}   small-bias spaces fools polynomials of degree   d   d   d   .  proves that, in fact, taking the sum of only   d   d   d   small-bias generators is sufficient to fool polynomials of degree   d   d   d   . The analysis of  gives a seed length of    ℓ  =    d  ⋅   log  n    +   O   (    2  d   ⋅   log   (   ϵ   -  1    )     )         normal-ℓ     normal-⋅  d    n      O   normal-⋅   superscript  2  d      superscript  ϵ    1          \ell=d\cdot\log n+O(2^{d}\cdot\log(\epsilon^{-1}))   .
