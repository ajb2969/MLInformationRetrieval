Wigner–Seitz radius

The Wigner–Seitz radius

 
 , named after Eugene Wigner and Frederick Seitz, is the radius of a sphere whose volume is equal to the mean volume per atom in a solid.1 This parameter is used frequently in condensed matter physics to describe the density of a system.
Formula
In a 3-D system with 
 
 
 
  particles in a volume 
 
 
 
 , the Wigner–Seitz radius is defined by2



Solving for 
 
 
 
  we obtain


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the particle density of the valence electrons.
For a non-interacting system, the average separation between two particles will be 
 
 
 
 . The radius can also be calculated as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is molar mass, 
 
 
 
  is mass density, and 
 
 
 
  is the Avogadro number.
This parameter is normally reported in atomic units, i.e., in units of the Bohr radius.
Values of
