   Wigner–Seitz radius      Wigner–Seitz radius   The Wigner–Seitz radius     r  s     subscript  r  s    r_{s}   , named after Eugene Wigner and Frederick Seitz , is the radius of a sphere whose volume is equal to the mean volume per atom in a solid. 1 This parameter is used frequently in condensed matter physics to describe the density of a system.  Formula  In a 3-D system with   N   N   N   particles in a volume   V   V   V   , the Wigner–Seitz radius is defined by 2         4  3   π   r  s  3    =   V  N    .          4  3   π   superscript   subscript  r  s   3      V  N     \frac{4}{3}\pi r_{s}^{3}=\frac{V}{N}.     Solving for    r  s     subscript  r  s    r_{s}   we obtain        r  s   =     (   3   4  π  n    )    1  /  3      ,       subscript  r  s    superscript    3    4  π  n      1  3      r_{s}=\left(\frac{3}{4\pi n}\right)^{1/3}\,,   where   n   n   n   is the particle density of the valence electrons.  For a non-interacting system, the average separation between two particles will be    2   r  s       2   subscript  r  s     2r_{s}   . The radius can also be calculated as        r  s   =     (    3  M    4  π  ρ   N  A     )    1  3      ,       subscript  r  s    superscript      3  M     4  π  ρ   subscript  N  A       1  3      r_{s}=\left(\frac{3M}{4\pi\rho N_{A}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\,,   where   M   M   M   is molar mass ,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is mass density , and    N  A     subscript  N  A    N_{A}   is the Avogadro number .  This parameter is normally reported in atomic units , i.e., in units of the Bohr radius .
