<h1>Double subscript notation</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, <strong>double-subscript notation</strong> is notation used to indicate some variable <em>between</em> two points (each point being represented by one of the subscripts). In <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, the notation is usually used to indicate the direction of current or voltage, while in <a href="mechanical_engineering" title="wikilink">mechanical engineering</a> it is sometimes used to describe the <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a> or <a href="Stress_(physics)" title="wikilink">stress</a> between two points, and sometimes even a component that spans between two points (like a beam on a bridge or <a class="uri" href="truss" title="wikilink">truss</a>). Note that, although there are many cases where multiple subscripts are used, they are not necessarily called <em>double subscript notation</em> specifically.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>This is a <a href="Convention_(norm)" title="wikilink">convention</a> to standardize the directions of double-subscript labels. The following uses <a class="uri" href="transistors" title="wikilink">transistors</a> as an example, but shows how the direction is read generally. The convention works like this:</p>

<p>

<math display="inline" id="Double_subscript_notation:0">
 <semantics>
  <msub>
   <mi>V</mi>
   <mi>CB</mi>
  </msub>
  <annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content">
   <apply>
    <csymbol cd="ambiguous">subscript</csymbol>
    <ci>V</ci>
    <ci>CB</ci>
   </apply>
  </annotation-xml>
  <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
   V_{\mathrm{CB}}
  </annotation>
 </semantics>
</math>

 means the "V" from C to B. In this case, V would probably stand for voltage, C would probably denote the collector end of a transistor, and B would denote the base end of the same transistor. This is the same as saying "the voltage drop from C to B". Although this assumes what the letters are, presumably this notation can be used in other contexts.</p>

<math display="inline" id="Double_subscript_notation:1">
 <semantics>
  <msub>
   <mi>I</mi>
   <mi>CE</mi>
  </msub>
  <annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content">
   <apply>
    <csymbol cd="ambiguous">subscript</csymbol>
    <ci>I</ci>
    <ci>CE</ci>
   </apply>
  </annotation-xml>
  <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
   I_{\mathrm{CE}}
  </annotation>
 </semantics>
</math>

 means the "I" from C to E. In this case, I would probably stand for current, C would again probably denote the collector end of a transistor, and E would denote the emitter end of the transistor. This is the same as saying "the current in the direction going from C to E". Although this assumes what the letters mean, presumably this notation can be used in other contexts.</p>

<p>The names given to <a href="IC_power_supply_pin" title="wikilink">power supply pins on integrated circuits</a> are independent from the conventions used in double subscript notations. They are coincidentally named in a similar way, for example V<sub>CC</sub>.</p>
