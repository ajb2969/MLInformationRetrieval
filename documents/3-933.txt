Borel–Kolmogorov paradox

In probability theory, the Borel–Kolmogorov paradox (sometimes known as Borel's paradox) is a paradox relating to conditional probability with respect to an event of probability zero (also known as a null set). It is named after Émile Borel and Andrey Kolmogorov.
A great circle puzzle
Suppose that a random variable has a uniform distribution on a unit sphere. What is its conditional distribution on a great circle? Because of the symmetry of the sphere, one might expect that the distribution is uniform and independent of the choice of coordinates. However, two analyses give contradictory results. First, note that choosing a point uniformly on the sphere is equivalent to choosing the longitude λ uniformly from [-π,π] and choosing the latitude φ from [-π/2,π/2] with density 
 
 
 
 .1 Then we can look at two different great circles:

1. If the coordinates are chosen so that the great circle is an equator (latitude φ = 0), the conditional density for a longitude λ defined on the interval [–π,π] is
 
 



2. If the great circle is a line of longitude with λ = 0, the conditional density for φ on the interval [–π/2,π/2] is
 
 




One distribution is uniform on the circle, the other is not. Yet both seem to be referring to the same great circle in different coordinate systems.
Explanation and implications
In case (1) above, the conditional probability that the longitude λ lies in a set E given that φ = 0 can be written P(λ ∈ E | φ = 0). Elementary probability theory suggests this can be computed as P(λ ∈ E and φ=0)/P(φ=0), but that expression is not well-defined since P(φ=0) = 0. Measure theory provides a way to define a conditional probability, using the family of events Rab = {φ : a ab = {λ : a Originally Kolmogorov (1933), translated in Kolmogorov (1956). Sourced from Pollard (2002)}} 
Mathematical explication
To understand the problem we need to recognize that a distribution on a continuous random variable is described by a density f only with respect to some measure μ. Both are important for the full description of the probability distribution. Or, equivalently, we need to fully define the space on which we want to define f.
Let Φ and Λ denote two random variables taking values in Ω1'' = [-π/2,π/2]'' respectively Ω2'' = [-π,π]''. An event ''{Φ=φ,Λ=λ} '' gives a point on the sphere S(r) with radius r. We define the coordinate transform








 
  for which we obtain the volume element


 
  Furthermore, if either φ or λ is fixed, we get the volume elements






Let


 
  denote the joint measure on 
 
 
 
 , which has a density 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  and let






If we assume that the density 
 
 
 
  is uniform, then






Hence, 
 
 
 
  has a uniform density with respect to 
 
 
 
  but not with respect to the Lebesgue measure. On the other hand, 
 
 
 
  has a uniform density with respect to 
 
 
 
  and the Lebesgue measure.
