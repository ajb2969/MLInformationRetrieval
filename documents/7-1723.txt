   Symplectic cut      Symplectic cut   In mathematics , specifically in symplectic geometry , the symplectic cut is a geometric modification on symplectic manifolds . Its effect is to decompose a given manifold into two pieces. There is an inverse operation, the symplectic sum , that glues two manifolds together into one. The symplectic cut can also be viewed as a generalization of symplectic blow up . The cut was introduced in 1995 by Eugene Lerman, who used it to study the symplectic quotient and other operations on manifolds.  Topological description  Let    (  X  ,  ω  )     X  ω    (X,\omega)   be any symplectic manifold and      μ  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  μ   normal-→  X  ℝ     \mu:X\to\mathbb{R}     a Hamiltonian on   X   X   X   . Let   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   be any regular value of   μ   μ   \mu   , so that the level set     μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  μ    1    ϵ    \mu^{-1}(\epsilon)   is a smooth manifold. Assume furthermore that     μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  μ    1    ϵ    \mu^{-1}(\epsilon)   is fibered in circles, each of which is an integral curve of the induced Hamiltonian vector field .  Under these assumptions,     μ   -  1     (   [  ϵ  ,  ∞  )   )        superscript  μ    1     ϵ      \mu^{-1}([\epsilon,\infty))   is a manifold with boundary     μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  μ    1    ϵ    \mu^{-1}(\epsilon)   , and one can form a manifold       X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}     by collapsing each circle fiber to a point. In other words,     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}   is   X   X   X   with the subset     μ   -  1     (   (   -  ∞   ,  ϵ  )   )        superscript  μ    1         ϵ     \mu^{-1}((-\infty,\epsilon))   removed and the boundary collapsed along each circle fiber. The quotient of the boundary is a submanifold of     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}   of codimension two, denoted   V   V   V   .  Similarly, one may form from     μ   -  1     (   (   -  ∞   ,  ϵ  ]   )        superscript  μ    1         ϵ     \mu^{-1}((-\infty,\epsilon])   a manifold     X  ¯    μ  ≤  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\leq\epsilon}   , which also contains a copy of   V   V   V   . The symplectic cut is the pair of manifolds     X  ¯    μ  ≤  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\leq\epsilon}   and     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}   .  Sometimes it is useful to view the two halves of the symplectic cut as being joined along their shared submanifold   V   V   V   to produce a singular space         X  ¯    μ  ≤  ϵ     ∪  V     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ     .      subscript   V    subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ      \overline{X}_{\mu\leq\epsilon}\cup_{V}\overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}.     For example, this singular space is the central fiber in the symplectic sum regarded as a deformation.  Symplectic description  The preceding description is rather crude; more care is required to keep track of the symplectic structure on the symplectic cut. For this, let    (  X  ,  ω  )     X  ω    (X,\omega)   be any symplectic manifold. Assume that the circle group     U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)    acts on   X   X   X   in a Hamiltonian way with moment map       μ  :   X  →  ℝ    .     normal-:  μ   normal-→  X  ℝ     \mu:X\to\mathbb{R}.     This moment map can be viewed as a Hamiltonian function that generates the circle action. The product space    X  ×  ℂ      X  ℂ    X\times\mathbb{C}   , with coordinate   z   z   z   on   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   , comes with an induced symplectic form       ω  ⊕   (    -   i  d  z    ∧   d   z  ¯     )    .     direct-sum  ω        i  d  z      d   normal-¯  z       \omega\oplus(-idz\wedge d\bar{z}).     The group    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   acts on the product in a Hamiltonian way by        e   i  θ    ⋅   (  x  ,  z  )    =   (    e   i  θ    ⋅  x   ,    e   -   i  θ     z   )        normal-⋅   superscript  e    i  θ     x  z      normal-⋅   superscript  e    i  θ    x      superscript  e      i  θ     z      e^{i\theta}\cdot(x,z)=(e^{i\theta}\cdot x,e^{-i\theta}z)     with moment map        ν   (  x  ,  z  )    =    μ   (  x  )    -    |  z  |   2     .        ν   x  z        μ  x    superscript    z   2      \nu(x,z)=\mu(x)-|z|^{2}.     Let   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   be any real number such that the circle action is free on     μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  μ    1    ϵ    \mu^{-1}(\epsilon)   . Then   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is a regular value of   ν   ν   \nu   , and     ν   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  ν    1    ϵ    \nu^{-1}(\epsilon)   is a manifold.  This manifold     ν   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  ν    1    ϵ    \nu^{-1}(\epsilon)   contains as a submanifold the set of points    (  x  ,  z  )     x  z    (x,z)   with     μ   (  x  )    =  ϵ        μ  x   ϵ    \mu(x)=\epsilon   and      |  z  |   2   =  0       superscript    z   2   0    |z|^{2}=0   ; this submanifold is naturally identified with     μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  μ    1    ϵ    \mu^{-1}(\epsilon)   . The complement of the submanifold, which consists of points    (  x  ,  z  )     x  z    (x,z)   with     μ   (  x  )    >  ϵ        μ  x   ϵ    \mu(x)>\epsilon   , is naturally identified with the product of       X    >  ϵ    :=    μ   -  1     (   (  ϵ  ,  ∞  )   )       assign   subscript  X    absent  ϵ       superscript  μ    1     ϵ       X_{>\epsilon}:=\mu^{-1}((\epsilon,\infty))     and the circle.  The manifold     ν   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  ν    1    ϵ    \nu^{-1}(\epsilon)   inherits the Hamiltonian circle action, as do its two submanifolds just described. So one may form the symplectic quotient         X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ    :=      ν   -  1     (  ϵ  )    /  U    (  1  )     .     assign   subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ           superscript  ν    1    ϵ   U   1     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}:=\nu^{-1}(\epsilon)/U(1).     By construction, it contains    X   μ  >  ϵ      subscript  X    μ  ϵ     X_{\mu>\epsilon}   as a dense open submanifold; essentially, it compactifies this open manifold with the symplectic quotient       V  :=      μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )    /  U    (  1  )     ,     assign  V         superscript  μ    1    ϵ   U   1     V:=\mu^{-1}(\epsilon)/U(1),     which is a symplectic submanifold of     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}   of codimension two.  If   X   X   X   is Kähler , then so is the cut space     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}   ; however, the embedding of    X   μ  >  ϵ      subscript  X    μ  ϵ     X_{\mu>\epsilon}   is not an isometry.  One constructs     X  ¯    μ  ≤  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\leq\epsilon}   , the other half of the symplectic cut, in a symmetric manner. The normal bundles of   V   V   V   in the two halves of the cut are opposite each other (meaning symplectically anti-isomorphic). The symplectic sum of     X  ¯    μ  ≥  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\geq\epsilon}   and     X  ¯    μ  ≤  ϵ      subscript   normal-¯  X     μ  ϵ     \overline{X}_{\mu\leq\epsilon}   along   V   V   V   recovers   X   X   X   .  The existence of a global Hamiltonian circle action on   X   X   X   appears to be a restrictive assumption. However, it is not actually necessary; the cut can be performed under more general hypotheses, such as a local Hamiltonian circle action near     μ   -  1     (  ϵ  )        superscript  μ    1    ϵ    \mu^{-1}(\epsilon)   (since the cut is a local operation).  Blow up as cut  When a complex manifold    X   X   X   is blown up along a submanifold   Z   Z   Z   , the blow up locus    Z   Z   Z   is replaced by an exceptional divisor    E   E   E   and the rest of the manifold is left undisturbed. Topologically, this operation may also be viewed as the removal of an   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   -neighborhood of the blow up locus, followed by the collapse of the boundary by the Hopf map .  Blowing up a symplectic manifold is more subtle, since the symplectic form must be adjusted in a neighborhood of the blow up locus in order to continue smoothly across the exceptional divisor in the blow up. The symplectic cut is an elegant means of making the neighborhood-deletion/boundary-collapse process symplectically rigorous.  As before, let    (  X  ,  ω  )     X  ω    (X,\omega)   be a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   -action with moment map   μ   μ   \mu   . Assume that the moment map is proper and that it achieves its maximum   m   m   m   exactly along a symplectic submanifold   Z   Z   Z   of   X   X   X   . Assume furthermore that the weights of the isotropy representation of    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   on the normal bundle     N  X   Z       subscript  N  X   Z    N_{X}Z   are all   1   1   1   .  Then for small   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   the only critical points in    X   μ  >   m  -  ϵ       subscript  X    μ    m  ϵ      X_{\mu>m-\epsilon}   are those on   Z   Z   Z   . The symplectic cut     X  ¯    μ  ≤   m  -  ϵ       subscript   normal-¯  X     μ    m  ϵ      \overline{X}_{\mu\leq m-\epsilon}   , which is formed by deleting a symplectic   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   -neighborhood of   Z   Z   Z   and collapsing the boundary, is then the symplectic blow up of   X   X   X   along   Z   Z   Z   .
