   Manuscripts of the Austrian National Library      Manuscripts of the Austrian National Library   The Department of Manuscripts and Rare Books of the Austrian National Library in Vienna was formed in April 2008 by merging the departments of "Manuscripts, Autographs, and Closed Collections" and of "Incunabula, Old and Valuable Books".  Within the library, the manuscripts are given a signature of Cod. plus an abbreviation of the applicable grouping (mostly by language; in the case of the Japanese and Chinese collection, the more generic Cim. , for cimelia "heirlooms, treasures" is used). When the context does not make clear that the manuscript is from Vienna, the abbreviation Cod. Vindob. is used, short for Codex Vindobonensis (after Vindobona , the ancient Roman name of Vienna).  The manuscripts are grouped as follows:   European manuscripts:  Cod. 1-15000 (old holdings)  Cod. Ser. n.1-50178 = Codices Series nova - new acquisitions from about 1870   Armenian manuscripts: Cod.
