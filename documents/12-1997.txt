   Integrally closed domain      Integrally closed domain   In commutative algebra , an integrally closed domain  A is an integral domain whose integral closure in its field of fractions is A itself. Many well-studied domains are integrally closed: Fields , the ring of integers Z , unique factorization domains and regular local rings are all integrally closed.  To give a non-example, 1 let k be a field and    A  =   k   [   t  2   ,   t  3   ]    ⊂  B  =   k   [  t  ]          A    k    superscript  t  2    superscript  t  3          B         k   delimited-[]  t       A=k[t^{2},t^{3}]\subset B=k[t]   ( A is the subalgebra generated by t 2 and t 3 .) A and B have the same field of fractions, and B is the integral closure of A (since B is a UFD.) In other words, A is not integrally closed. This is related to the fact that the plane curve     Y  2   =   X  3        superscript  Y  2    superscript  X  3     Y^{2}=X^{3}   has a singularity at the origin.  Let A be an integrally closed domain with field of fractions K and let L be a finite extension of K . Then x in L is integral over A if and only if its minimal polynomial over K has coefficients in A . 2 This implies in particular that an integral element over an integrally closed domain A has a minimal polynomial over A . This is stronger than the statement that any integral element satisfies some monic polynomial. In fact, the statement is false without "integrally closed" (consider     A  =   ℤ   [   5   ]     .      A    ℤ   delimited-[]    5       A=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{5}].   )  Integrally closed domains also play a role in the hypothesis of the Going-down theorem . The theorem states that if A ⊆ B is an integral extension of domains and A is an integrally closed domain, then the going-down property holds for the extension A ⊆ B .  Note that integrally closed domain appear in the following chain of class inclusions :  Examples  The following are integrally closed domains.   Any principal ideal domain (in particular, any field).  Any unique factorization domain (in particular, any polynomial ring over a unique factorization domain.)  Any GCD domain (in particular, any Bézout domain or valuation domain ).  Any Dedekind domain .  Any symmetric algebra over a field (since every symmetric algebra is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in several variables over a field).   Noetherian integrally closed domain  For a noetherian local domain A of dimension one, the following are equivalent.   A is integrally closed.  The maximal ideal of A is principal.  A is a discrete valuation ring (equivalently A is Dedekind.)  A is a regular local ring.   Let A be a noetherian integral domain. Then A is integrally closed if and only if (i) A is the intersection of all localizations    A  𝔭     subscript  A  𝔭    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   over prime ideals   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of height 1 and (ii) the localization    A  𝔭     subscript  A  𝔭    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   at a prime ideal   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of height 1 is a discrete valuation ring.  A noetherian ring is a Krull domain if and only if it is an integrally closed domain.  In the non-noetherian setting, one has the following: an integral domain is integrally closed if and only if it is the intersection of all valuation rings containing it.  Normal rings  Authors including Serre , Grothendieck , and Matsumura define a normal ring to be a ring whose localizations at prime ideals are integrally closed domains. Such a ring is necessarily a reduced ring , 3 and this is sometimes included in the definition. In general, if A is a Noetherian ring whose localizations at maximal ideals are all domains, then A is a finite product of domains. 4 In particular if A is a Noetherian, normal ring, then the domains in the product are integrally closed domains. 5 Conversely, any finite product of integrally closed domains is normal. In particular, if    Spec   (  A  )      Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}(A)   is noetherian, normal and connected, then A is an integrally closed domain. (cf. smooth variety )  Let A be a noetherian ring. Then ( Serre's criterion ) A is normal if and only if it satisfies the following: for any prime ideal   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   ,   (i) If   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   has height     ≤  1      absent  1    \leq 1   , then    A  𝔭     subscript  A  𝔭    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   is regular (i.e.,    A  𝔭     subscript  A  𝔭    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   is a discrete valuation ring .)  (ii) If   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   has height     ≥  2      absent  2    \geq 2   , then    A  𝔭     subscript  A  𝔭    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   has depth     ≥  2      absent  2    \geq 2   . 6   Item (i) is often phrased as "regular in codimension 1". Note (i) implies that the set of associated primes     A  s  s   (  A  )       A  s  s  A    Ass(A)   has no embedded primes , and, when (i) is the case, (ii) means that    A  s  s   (    A  /  f   A   )       A  s  s      A  f   A     Ass(A/fA)   has no embedded prime for any non-zerodivisor f . In particular, a Cohen-Macaulay ring satisfies (ii). Geometrically, we have the following: if X is a local complete intersection in a nonsingular variety; 7 e.g., X itself is nonsingular, then X is Cohen-Macaulay; i.e., the stalks    𝒪  p     subscript  𝒪  p    \mathcal{O}_{p}   of the structure sheaf are Cohen-Macaulay for all prime ideals p. Then we can say: X is normal (i.e., the stalks of its structure sheaf are all normal) if and only if it is regular in codimension 1 .  Completely integrally closed domains  Let A be a domain and K its field of fractions. An element x in K is said to be '''almost integral over A ''' if the subring A [ x ] of K generated by A and x is a fractional ideal of A ; that is, if there is a    d  ≠  0      d  0    d\neq 0   such that     d   x  n    ∈  A        d   superscript  x  n    A    dx^{n}\in A   for all    n  ≥  0      n  0    n\geq 0   . Then A is said to be completely integrally closed if every almost integral element of K is contained in A . A completely integrally closed domain is integrally closed. Conversely, a noetherian integrally closed domain is completely integrally closed.  Assume A is completely integrally closed. Then the formal power series ring    A   [   [  X  ]   ]       A   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  X      A[[X]]   is completely integrally closed. 8 This is significant since the analog is false for an integrally closed domain: let R be a valuation domain of height at least 2 (which is integrally closed.) Then    R   [   [  X  ]   ]       R   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  X      R[[X]]   is not integrally closed. 9 Let L be a field extension of K . Then the integral closure of A in L is completely integrally closed. 10  An integral domain is completely integrally closed if and only if the monoid of divisors of A is a group. 11  See also: Krull domain .  "Integrally closed" under constructions  The following conditions are equivalent for an integral domain A :   A is integrally closed;  A p (the localization of A with respect to p ) is integrally closed for every prime ideal  p ;  A m is integrally closed for every maximal ideal  m .   1 → 2 results immediately from the preservation of integral closure under localization; 2 → 3 is trivial; 3 → 1 results from the preservation of integral closure under localization, the exactness of localization , and the property that an A -module M is zero if and only if its localization with respect to every maximal ideal is zero.  In contrast, the "integrally closed" does not pass over quotient, for Z [t]/(t 2 +4) is not integrally closed.  The localization of a completely integrally closed need not be completely integrally closed. 12  A direct limit of integrally closed domains is an integrally closed domain.  Modules over an integrally closed domain  Let A be a Noetherian integrally closed domain.  An ideal I of A is divisorial if and only if every associated prime of A / I has height one. 13  Let P denotes the set of all prime ideals in A of height one. If T is a finitely generated torsion module, one puts:       χ   (  T  )    =    ∑   p  ∈  P       length  p    (  T  )    p          χ  T     subscript     p  P       subscript  length  p   T   p      \chi(T)=\sum_{p\in P}\operatorname{length}_{p}(T)p   , which makes sense as a formal sum; i.e., a divisor. We write    c   (  d  )       c  d    c(d)   for the divisor class of d . If    F  ,   F  ′      F   superscript  F  normal-′     F,F^{\prime}   are maximal submodules of M , then     c   (   χ   (   M  /  F   )    )    =   c   (   χ   (   M  /   F  ′    )    )          c    χ    M  F       c    χ    M   superscript  F  normal-′        c(\chi(M/F))=c(\chi(M/F^{\prime}))    14 and    c   (   χ   (   M  /  F   )    )       c    χ    M  F      c(\chi(M/F))   is denoted (in Bourbaki) by    c   (  M  )       c  M    c(M)   .

Proof : Suppose x is nonzero in R and x 2 =0. The annihilator ann( x ) is contained in some maximal ideal   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   . Now, the image of x is nonzero in the localization of R at   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   since    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   at   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   means     x  s   =  0        x  s   0    xs=0   for some    s  ∉  𝔪      s  𝔪    s\not\in\mathfrak{m}   but then   s   s   s   is in the annihilator of x , contradiction.
