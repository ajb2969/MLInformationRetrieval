   Proof that π is irrational      Proof that π is irrational   In the 18th century, Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that the number    π   π   \pi    (pi) is irrational , that is, that it cannot be expressed as a fraction a / b , where a is an integer and b is a non-zero integer. In the 19th century, Charles Hermite found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic calculus . Three simplifications of Hermite's proof are due to Mary Cartwright , to Ivan Niven and to Bourbaki . Another proof, which is a simplification of Lambert's proof, is due to Miklós Laczkovich .  In 1882, Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that   π   π   \pi   is not just irrational, but transcendental as well . 1  Lambert's proof  In 1761, Lambert proved that   π   π   \pi   is irrational by first showing that this continued fraction expansion holds:        tan   (  x  )    =   x   1  -     x  2    3  -     x  2    5  -     x  2    7  -  ⋱              .        x    continued-fraction  x    1   continued-fraction   superscript  x  2     3   continued-fraction   superscript  x  2     5   continued-fraction   superscript  x  2     7  normal-⋱            \tan(x)=\cfrac{x}{1-\cfrac{x^{2}}{3-\cfrac{x^{2}}{5-\cfrac{x^{2}}{7-{}\ddots}}%
 }}.     Then Lambert proved that if x is non-zero and rational then this expression must be irrational. Since tan(   π   π   \pi   /4) = 1, it follows that   π   π   \pi   /4 is irrational and therefore that   π   π   \pi   is irrational. 2 A simplification of Lambert's proof is given below .  Hermite's proof  This proof uses the characterization of   π   π   \pi   as the smallest positive number whose half is a zero of the cosine function and it actually proves that   π   π   \pi    2 is irrational. 3 4 As in many proofs of irrationality, the argument proceeds by reductio ad absurdum .  Consider the sequences ( A n ) n ≥ 0 and ( U n ) n ≥ 0 of functions from R into R thus defined:          A  0    (  x  )    =   sin   (  x  )     ;         subscript  A  0   x     x     A_{0}(x)=\sin(x);\,          (  ∀  n  ∈   ℤ  +   )   :   A   n  +  1     (  x  )   =   ∫  0  x   y   A  n    (  y  )   d  y  ;     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  n    subscript  ℤ    normal-)   normal-:   subscript  A    n  1     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     superscript   subscript   0   x   y   subscript  A  n    fragments  normal-(  y  normal-)   d  y  normal-;    (\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}):A_{n+1}(x)=\int_{0}^{x}yA_{n}(y)\,dy;            U  0    (  x  )    =    sin   (  x  )    x    ;         subscript  U  0   x       x   x     U_{0}(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{x};          (  ∀  n  ∈   ℤ  +   )   :   U   n  +  1     (  x  )   =  -     U  n  ′    (  x  )    x   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  n    subscript  ℤ    normal-)   normal-:   subscript  U    n  1     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)          superscript   subscript  U  n   normal-′   x   x   normal-.    (\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}):U_{n+1}(x)=-\frac{U_{n}^{\prime}(x)}{x}.      It can be proved by induction that       (  ∀  n  ∈   ℤ  +   )   :   A  n    (  x  )   =    x    2  n   +  1       (    2  n   +  1   )   !   !    -    x    2  n   +  3     2  ×     (    2  n   +  3   )   !   !     +    x    2  n   +  5     2  ×  4  ×     (    2  n   +  5   )   !   !     ∓  ⋯     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  n    subscript  ℤ    normal-)   normal-:   subscript  A  n    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)       superscript  x      2  n   1            2  n   1          superscript  x      2  n   3      2          2  n   3           superscript  x      2  n   5      2  4          2  n   5       minus-or-plus  normal-⋯    (\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}):A_{n}(x)=\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!!}-\frac{x^{2n+3}%

So          A   n  +  1     (  x  )     x    2  n   +  3     =    U   n  +  1     (  x  )    =   -     U  n  ′    (  x  )    x    =   -    1  x    d   d  x     (     A  n    (  x  )     x    2  n   +  1     )      ,             subscript  A    n  1    x    superscript  x      2  n   3        subscript  U    n  1    x               superscript   subscript  U  n   normal-′   x   x               1  x     d    d  x         subscript  A  n   x    superscript  x      2  n   1          \frac{A_{n+1}(x)}{x^{2n+3}}=U_{n+1}(x)=-\frac{U_{n}^{\prime}(x)}{x}=-\frac{1}{%
 x}\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{A_{n}(x)}{x^{2n+1}}\right),   which is equivalent to         A   n  +  1     (  x  )    =     (    2  n   +  1   )    A  n    (  x  )    -   x   A  n  ′    (  x  )     =     (    2  n   +  1   )    A  n    (  x  )    -    x  2    A   n  -  1     (  x  )      .           subscript  A    n  1    x           2  n   1    subscript  A  n   x     x   superscript   subscript  A  n   normal-′   x                 2  n   1    subscript  A  n   x      superscript  x  2    subscript  A    n  1    x       A_{n+1}(x)=(2n+1)A_{n}(x)-xA_{n}^{\prime}(x)=(2n+1)A_{n}(x)-x^{2}A_{n-1}(x).\,   It follows by induction from this, together with the fact that A 0 ( x ) = sin( x ) and that A 1 ( x ) = − x cos( x ) + sin( x ), that A n ( x ) can be written as P n ( x 2 )sin( x ) + x Q n ( x 2 )cos( x ), where P n and Q n are polynomial functions with integer coefficients and where the degree of P n is smaller than or equal to ⌊ n ⁄ 2 ⌋. In particular, A n (   π   π   \pi   /2) = P n (   π   π   \pi    2 /4).  Hermite also gave a closed expression for the function A n , namely         A  n    (  x  )    =     x    2  n   +  1      2  n    n  !       ∫  0  1      (   1  -   z  2    )   n    cos   (   x  z   )    d  z      .         subscript  A  n   x        superscript  x      2  n   1       superscript  2  n     n       superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript    1   superscript  z  2    n       x  z    d  z       A_{n}(x)=\frac{x^{2n+1}}{2^{n}n!}\int_{0}^{1}(1-z^{2})^{n}\cos(xz)\,dz.   He did not justify this assertion, but it can be proved easily. First of all, this assertion is equivalent to         1    2  n    n  !       ∫  0  1      (   1  -   z  2    )   n    cos   (   x  z   )    d  z     =     A  n    (  x  )     x    2  n   +  1     =    U  n    (  x  )     .            1     superscript  2  n     n       superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript    1   superscript  z  2    n       x  z    d  z          subscript  A  n   x    superscript  x      2  n   1             subscript  U  n   x      \frac{1}{2^{n}n!}\int_{0}^{1}(1-z^{2})^{n}\cos(xz)\,dz=\frac{A_{n}(x)}{x^{2n+1%
 }}=U_{n}(x).   Proceeding by induction, take n = 0.        ∫  0  1     cos   (   x  z   )    d  z    =    sin   (  x  )    x   =    U  0    (  x  )            superscript   subscript   0   1         x  z    d  z        x   x           subscript  U  0   x      \int_{0}^{1}\cos(xz)\,dz=\frac{\sin(x)}{x}=U_{0}(x)   and, for the inductive step, consider any n ∈ Z + . If         1    2  n    n  !       ∫  0  1      (   1  -   z  2    )   n    cos   (   x  z   )    d  z     =    U  n    (  x  )     ,          1     superscript  2  n     n       superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript    1   superscript  z  2    n       x  z    d  z        subscript  U  n   x     \frac{1}{2^{n}n!}\int_{0}^{1}(1-z^{2})^{n}\cos(xz)\,dz=U_{n}(x),     then, using integration by parts and Leibniz's rule , one gets         1    2   n  +  1      (   n  +  1   )   !          ∫  0  1       (   1  -   z  2    )    n  +  1     cos   (   x  z   )    d  z          1     superscript  2    n  1        n  1        superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript    1   superscript  z  2      n  1        x  z    d  z      \displaystyle{}\quad\frac{1}{2^{n+1}(n+1)!}\int_{0}^{1}(1-z^{2})^{n+1}\cos(xz)%
 \,dz     If   π   π   \pi    2 /4 = p / q , with p and q in N , then, since the coefficients of P n are integers and its degree is smaller than or equal to ⌊ n ⁄ 2 ⌋, q ⌊ n /2⌋ P n (   π   π   \pi    2 /4) is some integer N . In other words,     N   N   \displaystyle N     But this number is clearly greater than 0; therefore, N ∈ N . On the other hand, the integral that appears here is not greater than 1 and        lim   n  ∈  ℕ      q   ⌊   n  2   ⌋       (   p  q   )    n  +   1  2       2  n    n  !       =  0.        subscript     n  ℕ       superscript  q      n  2        superscript    p  q     n    1  2        superscript  2  n     n       0.    \lim_{n\in\mathbb{N}}q^{\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor}\frac{\left(\frac%
 {p}{q}\right)^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}{2^{n}n!}=0.     So, if n is large enough, N $\pi$. He discussed the recurrence relations to motivate and to obtain a convenient integral representation. Once this integral representation is obtained, there are various ways to present a succinct and self-contained proof starting from the integral (as in Cartwright's, Bourbaki's or Niven's presentations), which Hermite could easily see (as he did in his proof of the transcendence of e 5 ).  Moreover, Hermite's proof is closer to Lambert's proof than it seems. In fact, A n ( x ) is the "residue" (or "remainder") of Lambert's continued fraction for tan( x ). 6  Cartwright's proof  Harold Jeffreys wrote that this proof was set as an example in an exam at Cambridge University in 1945 by Mary Cartwright , but that she had not traced its origin. 7  Consider the integrals         I  n    (  x  )    =    ∫   -  1   1      (   1  -   z  2    )   n    cos   (   x  z   )    d  z     ,         subscript  I  n   x     superscript   subscript     1    1      superscript    1   superscript  z  2    n       x  z    d  z      I_{n}(x)=\int_{-1}^{1}(1-z^{2})^{n}\cos(xz)\,dz,   where n is a non-negative integer.  Two integrations by parts give the recurrence relation       (  ∀  n  ∈  ℕ  ∖   {  1  }   )   :   x  2    I  n    (  x  )   =  2  n   (  2  n  -  1  )    I   n  -  1     (  x  )   -  4  n   (  n  -  1  )    I   n  -  2     (  x  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  n   N    fragments  normal-{  1  normal-}   normal-)   normal-:   superscript  x  2    subscript  I  n    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    2  n   fragments  normal-(  2  n   1  normal-)    subscript  I    n  1     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    4  n   fragments  normal-(  n   1  normal-)    subscript  I    n  2     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-.

 )I_{n-2}(x).     If         J  n    (  x  )    =    x    2  n   +  1     I  n    (  x  )     ,         subscript  J  n   x      superscript  x      2  n   1     subscript  I  n   x     J_{n}(x)=x^{2n+1}I_{n}(x),\,   then this becomes         J  n    (  x  )    =    2  n   (    2  n   -  1   )    J   n  -  1     (  x  )    -   4  n   (   n  -  1   )    x  2    J   n  -  2     (  x  )      .         subscript  J  n   x       2  n      2  n   1    subscript  J    n  1    x     4  n    n  1    superscript  x  2    subscript  J    n  2    x      J_{n}(x)=2n(2n-1)J_{n-1}(x)-4n(n-1)x^{2}J_{n-2}(x).     Furthermore, J 0 ( x ) = 2sin( x ) and J 1 ( x ) = −4 x cos( x ) + 4sin( x ). Hence for all n ∈ Z + ,         J  n    (  x  )    =    x    2  n   +  1     I  n    (  x  )    =    n  !    (     P  n    (  x  )    sin   (  x  )     +    Q  n    (  x  )    cos   (  x  )      )     ,           subscript  J  n   x      superscript  x      2  n   1     subscript  I  n   x            n        subscript  P  n   x    x       subscript  Q  n   x    x         J_{n}(x)=x^{2n+1}I_{n}(x)=n!\bigl(P_{n}(x)\sin(x)+Q_{n}(x)\cos(x)\bigr),\,     where P n ( x ) and Q n ( x ) are polynomials of degree ≤ 2 n , and with integer coefficients (depending on n ).  Take x =    π   π   \pi    ⁄ 2 , and suppose if possible that    π   π   \pi    ⁄ 2 = b ⁄ a , where a and b are natural numbers (i.e., assume that   π   π   \pi   is rational). Then          b    2  n   +  1     n  !     I  n    (   π  2   )    =    P  n    (   π  2   )    a    2  n   +  1      .           superscript  b      2  n   1      n     subscript  I  n     π  2       subscript  P  n     π  2    superscript  a      2  n   1       \frac{b^{2n+1}}{n!}I_{n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=P_{n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}%

Hence for sufficiently large n       0  <     b    2  n   +  1     I  n    (   π  2   )     n  !    <  1   ,        0       superscript  b      2  n   1     subscript  I  n     π  2      n         1     0<\frac{b^{2n+1}I_{n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{n!}<1,     that is, we could find an integer between 0 and 1. That is the contradiction that follows from the assumption that   π   π   \pi   is rational.  This proof is similar to Hermite's proof. Indeed,       J  n    (  x  )        subscript  J  n   x    \displaystyle J_{n}(x)   However, it is clearly simpler. This is achieved by passing the inductive definition of the functions A n and taking as a starting point their expression as an integral.  Niven's proof  This proof uses the characterization of   π   π   \pi   as the smallest positive zero of the sine function. 8  Suppose that   π   π   \pi   is rational, i.e.  for some integers a and , which may be taken without loss of generality to be positive. Given any positive integer n , we define the polynomial function f from R into R defined by       f   (  x  )    =     x  n     (   a  -   b  x    )   n     n  !          f  x        superscript  x  n    superscript    a    b  x    n      n      f(x)=\frac{x^{n}(a-bx)^{n}}{n!}     and, for each x ∈ R denote by       F   (  x  )    =     f   (  x  )    -    f  ′′    (  x  )     +    f   (  4  )     (  x  )    +  ⋯  +     (   -  1   )   j    f   (   2  j   )     (  x  )    +  ⋯  +     (   -  1   )   n    f   (   2  n   )     (  x  )           F  x         f  x      superscript  f  ′′   x       superscript  f  4   x   normal-⋯     superscript    1   j    superscript  f    2  j    x   normal-⋯     superscript    1   n    superscript  f    2  n    x      F(x)=f(x)-f^{\prime\prime}(x)+f^{(4)}(x)+\cdots+(-1)^{j}f^{(2j)}(x)+\cdots+(-1%

Proof: Expanding f as a sum of monomials, the coefficient of x k is a number of the form where c k is an integer, which is 0 if . Therefore, is 0 when  and it is equal to if ; in each case, is an integer and therefore F (0) is an integer.  On the other hand, = f ( x ) and so = for each non-negative integer k . In particular, = Therefore, is also an integer and so F (   π   π   \pi   ) is an integer (in fact, it is easy to see that F (   π   π   \pi   ) = F (0), but that is not relevant to the proof). Since F (0) and F (   π   π   \pi   ) are integers, so is their sum.  Claim 2:        ∫  0  π    f   (  x  )    sin   (  x  )    d  x    =    F   (  0  )    +   F   (  π  )           superscript   subscript   0   π     f  x    x   d  x        F  0     F  π      \int_{0}^{\pi}f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=F(0)+F(\pi)     Proof: Since is the zero polynomial, we have         F  ′′   +  F   =  f   .         superscript  F  ′′   F   f    F^{\prime\prime}+F=f.\,     The derivatives of the sine and cosine function are given by sin' = cos and cos' = −sin. Hence the product rule implies        (     F  ′   ⋅  sin   -   F  ⋅  cos    )   ′   =   f  ⋅   sin         superscript     normal-⋅   superscript  F  normal-′      normal-⋅  F     normal-′    normal-⋅  f      (F^{\prime}\cdot\sin-F\cdot\cos)^{\prime}=f\cdot\sin\!     By the fundamental theorem of calculus         ∫  0  π    f   (  x  )    sin   (  x  )    d  x    =     (     F  ′    (  x  )    sin  x    -   F   (  x  )    cos  x     )   |   0  π    .        superscript   subscript   0   π     f  x    x   d  x     evaluated-at       superscript  F  normal-′   x    x      F  x    x     0  π     \int_{0}^{\pi}f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=\bigl(F^{\prime}(x)\sin x-F(x)\cos x\bigr)\Big|_%
 {0}^{\pi}.\!     Since  and  (here we use the above-mentioned characterization of   π   π   \pi   as a zero of the sine function), Claim 2 follows.  Conclusion: Since  and  for  (because   π   π   \pi   is the smallest positive zero of the sine function), Claims 1 and 2 show that  is a positive integer. Since  and  for , we have, by the original definition of f ,        ∫  0  π    f   (  x  )    sin   (  x  )    d  x    ≤   π     (   π  a   )   n    n  !           superscript   subscript   0   π     f  x    x   d  x      π     superscript    π  a   n     n       \int_{0}^{\pi}f(x)\sin(x)\,dx\leq\pi\frac{(\pi a)^{n}}{n!}     which is smaller than 1 for large n , hence  for these n , by Claim 2. This is impossible for the positive integer .  The above proof is a polished version, which is kept as simple as possible concerning the prerequisites, of an analysis of the formula        ∫  0  π     f   (  x  )    sin   (  x  )    d  x       superscript   subscript   0   π     f  x    x   d  x     \displaystyle\int_{0}^{\pi}f(x)\sin(x)\,dx     which is obtained by integrations by parts . Claim 2 essentially establishes this formula, where the use of F hides the iterated integration by parts. The last integral vanishes because is the zero polynomial. Claim 1 shows that the remaining sum is an integer.  Niven's proof is closer to Cartwright's (and therefore Hermite's) proof than it appears at first sight. 9 In fact,       J  n    (  x  )        subscript  J  n   x    \displaystyle J_{n}(x)   Therefore, the substitution  xz = y turns this integral into        ∫   -  x   x      (    x  2   -   y  2    )   n    cos   (  y  )    d  y    .      superscript   subscript     x    x      superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    n     y   d  y     \int_{-x}^{x}(x^{2}-y^{2})^{n}\cos(y)\,dy.   In particular,       J  n    (    π  2    )        subscript  J  n     π  2     \displaystyle J_{n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)     Another connection between the proofs lies in the fact that Hermite already mentions 10 that if f is a polynomial function and       F  =     f  -   f   (  2  )     +   f   (  4  )     ∓  ⋯    ,      F   minus-or-plus      f   superscript  f  2     superscript  f  4    normal-⋯     F=f-f^{(2)}+f^{(4)}\mp\cdots,   then        ∫   f   (  x  )    sin   (  x  )    d  x    =     F  ′    (  x  )    sin   (  x  )     -   F   (  x  )    cos   (  x  )       ,          f  x    x   d  x         superscript  F  normal-′   x    x      F  x    x       \int f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=F^{\prime}(x)\sin(x)-F(x)\cos(x),   from which it follows that         ∫  0  π    f   (  x  )    sin   (  x  )    d  x    =    F   (  π  )    +   F   (  0  )      .        superscript   subscript   0   π     f  x    x   d  x        F  π     F  0      \int_{0}^{\pi}f(x)\sin(x)\,dx=F(\pi)+F(0).     Bourbaki's proof  Bourbaki 's proof is outlined as an exercise in his Calculus treatise. 11 For each natural number b and each non-negative integer n , define         A  n    (  b  )    =    b  n     ∫  0  π       x  n     (   π  -  x   )   n     n  !     sin   (  x  )    d  x      .         subscript  A  n   b      superscript  b  n     superscript   subscript   0   π          superscript  x  n    superscript    π  x   n      n      x   d  x       A_{n}(b)=b^{n}\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{x^{n}(\pi-x)^{n}}{n!}\sin(x)\,dx.   Since A n ( b ) is the integral of a function which defined on [0,   π   π   \pi   ] that takes the value 0 on 0 and on   π   π   \pi   and which is greater than 0 otherwise, A n ( b ) > 0. Besides, for each natural number b , A n ( b ) (\forall x\in[0,\pi]):x(\pi-x)\le\left(\frac\pi2\right)^2 and therefore         A  n    (  b  )    ≤   π   b  n    1   n  !      (   π  2   )    2  n     =   π     (    b   π  2    /  4   )   n    n  !      .           subscript  A  n   b     π   superscript  b  n     1    n     superscript    π  2     2  n            π     superscript      b   superscript  π  2    4   n     n        A_{n}(b)\leq\pi b^{n}\frac{1}{n!}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2n}=\pi\frac{(b%
 \pi^{2}/4)^{n}}{n!}.     On the other hand, recursive integration by parts allows us to deduce that, if a and b are natural number such that   π   π   \pi   = a / b and f is the polynomial function from [0,   π   π   \pi   ] into R defined by        f   (  x  )    =     x  n     (   a  -   b  x    )   n     n  !     ,        f  x        superscript  x  n    superscript    a    b  x    n      n      f(x)=\frac{x^{n}(a-bx)^{n}}{n!},   then:       A  n    (  b  )        subscript  A  n   b    \displaystyle A_{n}(b)   This last integral , since f (2 n + 1) is the null function (because f is a polynomial function whose degree is 2 n ). Since each function f ( k ) (with ) takes integer values on 0 and on   π   π   \pi   (see Claim 1 from Niven's proof) and since the same thing happens with the sine and the cosine functions, this proves that A n ( b ) is an integer. Since it is also greater than 0, it must be a natural number. But it was also proved that A n ( b ) n ( b'') are integers.  Laczkovich's proof  Miklós Laczkovich 's proof is a simplification of Lambert's original proof. 12 He considers the functions       f  k    (  x  )        subscript  f  k   x    \displaystyle f_{k}(x)     These functions are clearly defined for all x ∈ R . Besides         f   1  /  2     (  x  )    =    cos   (   2  x   )    and   f   3  /  2     (  x  )    =    sin   (   2  x   )     2  x     .           subscript  f    1  2    x         2  x    and   subscript  f    3  2    x              2  x      2  x       f_{1/2}(x)=\cos(2x)\text{ and }f_{3/2}(x)=\frac{\sin(2x)}{2x}.     Claim 1: The following recurrence relation holds:       (  ∀  x  ∈  ℝ  )   :    x  2    k   (   k  +  1   )      f   k  +  2     (  x  )   =   f   k  +  1     (  x  )   -   f  k    (  x  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  x   R  normal-)   normal-:     superscript  x  2     k    k  1      subscript  f    k  2     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  f    k  1     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  f  k    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-.    (\forall x\in\mathbb{R}):\frac{x^{2}}{k(k+1)}f_{k+2}(x)=f_{k+1}(x)-f_{k}(x).     Proof: This can be proved by comparing the coefficients of the powers of x .  Claim 2: For each x ∈ R ,      lim   k  →   +  ∞       f  k    (  x  )     =  1.        subscript    normal-→  k           subscript  f  k   x    1.    \lim_{k\to+\infty}f_{k}(x)=1.     Proof: In fact, the sequence x 2 n / n ! is bounded (since it converges to 0) and if C is an upper bound and if k > 1, then        |     f  k    (  x  )    -  1   |   ⩽    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    C   k  n     =   C    1  /  k    1  -   1  /  k      =   C   k  -  1     .               subscript  f  k   x   1      superscript   subscript     n  1        C   superscript  k  n            C      1  k     1    1  k             C    k  1       \bigl|f_{k}(x)-1\bigr|\leqslant\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{C}{k^{n}}=C\frac{1/k}{%
 1-1/k}=\frac{C}{k-1}.     Claim 3: If x ≠ 0 and if x 2 is rational, then       (  ∀  k  ∈  ℚ  ∖   {  0  ,  -  1  ,  -  2  ,  …  }   )   :   f  k    (  x  )   ≠  0  and     f   k  +  1     (  x  )      f  k    (  x  )     ∉  ℚ  .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  k   Q    fragments  normal-{  0  normal-,   1  normal-,   2  normal-,  normal-…  normal-}   normal-)   normal-:   subscript  f  k    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    0  and       subscript  f    k  1    x      subscript  f  k   x     Q  normal-.    (\forall k\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0,-1,-2,\ldots\}):f_{k}(x)\neq 0\text{ and }%
 \frac{f_{k+1}(x)}{f_{k}(x)}\notin\mathbb{Q}.     Proof: Otherwise, there would be a number y ≠ 0 and integers a and b such that f k ( x ) = ay and f k + 1 ( x ) = by . In order to see why, take y = f k + 1 ( x ), a = 0 and b = 1 if f k ( x ) = 0; otherwise, choose integers a and b such that f k + 1 ( x )/ f k ( x ) = b / a and define y = f k ( x )/ a = f k + 1 ( x )/ b . In each case, y cannot be 0, because otherwise it would follow from claim 1 that each f k + n ( x ) ( n ∈ N ) would be 0, which would contradict claim 2. Now, take a natural number c such that all three numbers bc / k , ck / x 2 and c / x 2 are integers and consider the sequence       g  n   =   {       f  k    (  x  )        if  n   =  0           c  n    k   (   k  +  1   )   ⋯   (    k  +  n   -  1   )       f   k  +  n     (  x  )      otherwise.           subscript  g  n    cases     subscript  f  k   x       if  n   0        superscript  c  n     k    k  1   normal-⋯      k  n   1      subscript  f    k  n    x   otherwise.     g_{n}=\begin{cases}f_{k}(x)&\text{ if }n=0\\
 \frac{c^{n}}{k(k+1)\cdots(k+n-1)}f_{k+n}(x)&\text{ otherwise.}\end{cases}     Then        g  0   =    f  k    (  x  )    =   a  y   ∈   ℤ  y  and   g  1    =    c  k    f   k  +  1     (  x  )    =     b  c   k   y   ∈   ℤ  y    .         subscript  g  0      subscript  f  k   x          a  y          ℤ  y  and   subscript  g  1             c  k    subscript  f    k  1    x              b  c   k   y          ℤ  y      g_{0}=f_{k}(x)=ay\in\mathbb{Z}y\text{ and }g_{1}=\frac{c}{k}f_{k+1}(x)=\frac{%
 bc}{k}y\in\mathbb{Z}y.     On the other hand, it follows from claim 1 that      g   n  +  2      subscript  g    n  2     \displaystyle g_{n+2}     which is a linear combination of g n + 1 and g n with integer coefficients. Therefore, each g n is an integer multiple of y . Besides, it follows from claim 2 that each g n is greater than 0 (and therefore that g n ≥ | y |) if n is large enough and that the sequence of all g n 's converges to 0. But a sequence of numbers greater than or equal to | y | cannot converge to 0.  Since f 1/2 (   π   π   \pi   /4) = cos(   π   π   \pi   /2) = 0, it follows from claim 3 that   π   π   \pi    2 /16 is irrational and therefore that   π   π   \pi   is irrational.  On the other hand, since        tan  x   =    sin  x    cos  x    =   x     f   3  /  2     (   x  /  2   )      f   1  /  2     (   x  /  2   )       ,          x       x     x           x       subscript  f    3  2      x  2       subscript  f    1  2      x  2         \tan x=\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}=x\frac{f_{3/2}(x/2)}{f_{1/2}(x/2)},     another consequence of claim 3 is that, if x ∈ Q \{0}, then tan x is irrational.  Laczkovich's proof is really about the hypergeometric function . In fact, f k ( x ) = 0 F 1 (k; − x 2 ) and Gauss found a continued fraction expansion of the hypergeometric function using its functional equation . 13 This allowed Laczkovich to find a new and simpler proof of the fact that the tangent function has the continued fraction expansion that Lambert had discovered.  Laczkovich's result can also be expressed in Bessel functions of the first kind J ν ( x ) . In fact, Γ ( k ) J k − 1 (2 x ) = x k − 1 f k ( x ). So Laczkovich's result is equivalent to: If x ≠ 0 and if x 2 is rational, then       (  ∀  k  ∈  ℚ  ∖   {  0  ,  -  1  ,  -  2  ,  …  }   )   :    x   J  k    (  x  )      J   k  -  1     (  x  )     ∉  ℚ  .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  k   Q    fragments  normal-{  0  normal-,   1  normal-,   2  normal-,  normal-…  normal-}   normal-)   normal-:      x   subscript  J  k   x      subscript  J    k  1    x     Q  normal-.    (\forall k\in\mathbb{Q}\setminus\{0,-1,-2,\ldots\}):\frac{xJ_{k}(x)}{J_{k-1}(x%
 )}\notin\mathbb{Q}.     See also   Proof that e is irrational  Proof that   π   π   \pi   is transcendental   References  "  Category:Pi  Category:Article proofs     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  ↩
