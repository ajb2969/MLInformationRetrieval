Wozencraft ensemble

In coding theory, the Wozencraft ensemble is a set of linear codes in which most of codes satisfy the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. It is named after John Wozencraft, who proved its existence. The ensemble is described by , who attributes it to Wozencraft.  used the Wozencraft ensemble as the inner codes in his construction of strongly explicit asymptotically good code.
Existence theorem
Theorem: Let 
 
 
 
  > 0. For a large enough 
 
 
 
 , there exists an ensemble of inner codes 
 
 
 
  of rate

 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , such that for at least 
 
 
 
  values of i, 
 
 
 
  has relative distance 
 
 
 
 .
Here relative distance is the ratio of minimum distance to block length. And 
 
 
 
  is the q-ary entropy function defined as follows: 
 
 
 
 .
In fact, to show the existence of this set of linear codes, we will specify this ensemble explicitly as follows: for 
 
 
 
 , the inner code 
 
 
 
 , is defined as 
 
 
 
 . Here we can notice that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We can do the multiplication 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
This ensemble is due to Wozencraft and is called the Wozencraft ensemble.
For any x and y in 
 
 
 
 , we have the following facts:




For any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 


So 
 
 
 
  is a linear code for every 
 
 
 
 .
Now we know that Wozencraft ensemble contains linear codes with rate 
 
 
 
 . In the following proof, we will show that there are at least 
 
 
 
  those linear codes having the relative distance 
 
 
 
 , i.e. they meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
Proof
To prove that there are at least 
 
 
 
  number of linear codes in the Wozencraft ensemble having relative distance 
 
 
 
 , we will prove that there are at most 
 
 
 
  number of linear codes having relative distance H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) (i.e., having the distance H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k).
Notice that in a linear code, the distance is equal to the minimum weight of all codewords of that code. This fact is the property of linear code. So if one non-zero codeword has the weight less than 
 
 
 
 , then that code has the distance less than 
 
 
 
 .
So 
 
 
 
  = the number of linear codes having the distance less than 
 
 
 
  = the number of linear codes having some codeword that has the weight less than 
 
 
 
 .
Now we have the following claim:
Claim: Two linear codes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (here 
 
 
 
 ) do not share any non-zero codeword.
Proof of Claim:
We prove the above claim by contradiction. Suppose there exist 
 
 
 
  such that two linear codes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  contain the same non-zero codeword y.
Now since 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  is non-zero, 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 .
So 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
This implies 
 
 
 
 , which is a contradiction, which completes the proof of the claim.
Now we come back to the proof of the theorem.
With any linear code having distance H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k, it has some codeword that has the weight less than 
 
 
 
 .
Also due to the Claim, notice that no two linear code share the same non-zero codewords. This implies that if we have 
 
 
 
  linear codes having distance H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k, then we have at least 
 
 
 
  different 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k (one such codeword 
 
 
 
  for each linear code). Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the weight of codeword 
 
 
 
 , which is the number of non-zero positions of 
 
 
 
 .
So 
 
 
 
  (the number of linear codes having distance H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k) is less than or equal the number of non-zero 
 
 
 
  such that wt(y) H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k.
Denote 
 
 
 
  H_q^{ - 1} (\frac{1}{2} - \varepsilon ) \cdot 2k\}
So 
 
 

Here 
 
 
 
  is the Volume of Hamming ball of radius r in 
 
 
 
 .
Recall the upper bound of the Volume of Hamming ball 
 
 
 
  (check Bounds on the Volume of a Hamming ball for proof's detail), we have:



When 
 
 
 
  is large enough, we have 
 
 
 
  \varepsilon(q^k-1) = \varepsilon N
So 
 
 
 
  \varepsilon N.
That means the number of linear codes having the relative distance H_q^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon) \cdot 2k is less than 
 
 
 
 . So the number of linear codes having the relative distance at least 
 
 
 
  is greater than 
 
 
 
 , which completes the proof.
