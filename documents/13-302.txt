Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence

In mathematics, the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence, also referred to as the RSK correspondence or RSK algorithm, is a combinatorial bijection between matrices 
 
 
 
  with non-negative integer entries and pairs 
 
 
 
  of semistandard Young tableaux of equal shape, whose size equals the sum of the entries of 
 
 
 
 . More precisely the weight of 
 
 
 
  is given by the column sums of 
 
 
 
 , and the weight of 
 
 
 
  by its row sums. It is a generalization of the Robinson–Schensted correspondence, in the sense that taking 
 
 
 
  to be a permutation matrix, the pair 
 
 
 
  will be the pair of standard tableaux associated to the permutation under the Robinson–Schensted correspondence.
The Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence extends many of the remarkable properties of the Robinson–Schensted correspondence, notably its symmetry: transposition of the matrix 
 
 
 
  results in interchange of the tableaux 
 
 
 
 .
The Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence
Introduction
The Robinson–Schensted correspondence is a bijective mapping between permutations and pairs of standard Young tableaux, both having the same shape. This bijection can be constructed using an algorithm called Schensted insertion, starting with an empty tableau and successively inserting the values σ1,…,σn of the permutation σ at the numbers 1,2,…n; these form the second line when σ is given in two-line notation:


 
 .
The first standard tableau 
 
 
 
  is the result of successive insertions; the other standard tableau 
 
 
 
  records the successive shapes of the intermediate tableaux during the construction of 
 
 
 
 .
The Schensted insertion easily generalizes to the case where σ has repeated entries; in that case the correspondence will produce a semistandard tableau 
 
 
 
  rather than a standard tableau, but 
 
 
 
  will still be a standard tableau. The definition of the RSK correspondence reestablishes symmetry between the P and Q tableaux by producing a semistandard tableau for 
 
 
 
  as well.
Two-line arrays
The two-line array (or generalized permutation)  corresponding to a matrix 
 
 
 
  is defined1 as



in which for any pair 
 
 
 
  that indexes an entry  of 
 
 
 
 , there are  columns equal to 
 
 
 
 , and all columns are in lexicographic order, which means that



 
 , and
if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 .

Example
The two-line array corresponding to



is



Definition of the correspondence
By applying the Schensted insertion algorithm to the bottom line of this two-line array, one obtains a pair consisting of a semistandard tableau 
 
 
 
  and a standard tableau , where the latter can be turned into a semistandard tableau 
 
 
 
  by replacing each entry 
 
 
 
 
  of  by the 
 
 
 
 -th entry of the top line of . One thus obtains a bijection from matrices 
 
 
 
  to ordered pairs,2

 
  of semistandard Young tableaux of the same shape, in which the set of entries of 
 
 
 
  is that of the second line of , and the set of entries of 
 
 
 
 
  is that of the first line of . The number of entries 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is therefore equal to the sum of the entries in column 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , and the number of entries 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is equal to the sum of the entries in row 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
Example
In the above example, the result of applying the Schensted insertion to successively insert 1,3,3,2,2,1,2 into an initially empty tableau results in a tableau 
 
 
 
 , and an additional standard tableau  recoding the successive shapes, given by



and after replacing the entries 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 in  successively by 1,1,1,2,2,3,3 one obtains the pair of semistandard tableaux



Direct definition of the RSK correspondence
The above definition uses the Schensted algorithm, which produces a standard recording tableau , and modifies it to take into account the first line of the two-line array and produce a semistandard recording tableau; this makes the relation to the Robinson–Schensted correspondence evident. It is natural however to simplify the construction by modifying the shape recording part of the algorithm to directly take into account the first line of the two-line array; it is in this form that the algorithm for the RSK correspondence is usually described. This simply means that after every Schensted insertion step, the tableau 
 
 
 
  is extended by adding, as entry of the new square, the 
 
 
 
 -th entry  of the first line of , where b is the current size of the tableaux. That this always produces a semistandard tableau follows from the property (first observed by Knuth3) that for successive insertions with an identical value in the first line of , each successive square added to the shape is in a column strictly to the right of the previous one.
Here is a detailed example of this construction of both semistandard tableaux. Corresponding to a matrix



one has the two-line array



The following table shows the construction of both tableaux for this example

Combinatorial properties of the RSK correspondence
The case of permutation matrices
If 
 
 
 
  is a permutation matrix then RSK outputs standard Young Tableaux (SYT), 
 
 
 
  of the same shape 
 
 
 
 . Conversely, if 
 
 
 
  are SYT having the same shape 
 
 
 
 , then the corresponding matrix 
 
 
 
  is a permutation matrix. As a result of this property by simply comparing the cardinalities of the two sets on the two sides of the bijective mapping we get the following corollary:
Corollary 1: For each 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  means 
 
 
 
  varies over all partitions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape 
 
 
 
 .
Symmetry
Let 
 
 
 
  be a matrix with non-negative entries. Suppose the RSK algorithm maps 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  then the RSK algorithm maps 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the transpose of 
 
 
 
 .4
In particular for the case of permutation matrices, one recovers the symmetry of the Robinson–Schensted correspondence:5
Theorem 2: If the permutation 
 
 
 
  corresponds to a triple 
 
 
 
 , then the inverse permutation, 
 
 
 
 , corresponds to 
 
 
 
 .
This leads to the following relation between the number of involutions on 
 
 
 
  with the number of tableaux that can be formed from 
 
 
 
  (An involution is a permutation that is its own inverse):6
Corollary 2: The number of tableaux that can be formed from 
 
 
 
  is equal to the number of involutions on 
 
 
 
 .
Proof: If 
 
 
 
  is an involution corresponding to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  corresponds to 
 
 
 
 ; hence 
 
 
 
 . Conversely, if 
 
 
 
  is any permutation corresponding to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  also corresponds to 
 
 
 
 ; hence 
 
 
 
 . So there is a one-one correspondence between involutions 
 
 
 
  and tableax 
 
 

The number of involutions on 
 
 
 
  is given by the recurrence:



Where 
 
 
 
 . By solving this recurrence we can get the number of involutions on 
 
 
 
 ,



Symmetric matrices
Let 
 
 
 
  and let the RSK algorithm map the matrix 
 
 
 
  to the pair 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an SSYT of shape 
 
 
 
 .7 Let 
 
 
 
  where the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then the map 
 
 
 
  establishes a bijection between symmetric matrices with row(
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
  and SSYT's of type 
 
 
 
 .
Applications of the RSK correspondence
Cauchy's identity
The Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence provides a direct bijective proof of the following celebrated identity for symmetric functions:



where 
 
 
 
  are Schur functions.
Kostka numbers
Fix partitions 
 
 
 
 , then



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote the Kostka numbers and 
 
 
 
  is the number of matrices 
 
 
 
 , with non-negative elements, with row row(
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
  and column(
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
 .
