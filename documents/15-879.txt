Geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductase

Geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductase (, geranylgeranyl reductase, CHL P) is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate:NADP+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction

phytyl diphosphate + 3 NADP+

 
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate + 3 NADPH + 3 H+


This enzyme also acts on geranylgeranyl-chlorophyll a.
