   Karen Vogtmann      Karen Vogtmann   Karen Vogtmann (born July 13, 1949 in Pittsburg, California 1 ) is a U.S. mathematician working primarily in the area of geometric group theory . She is known for having introduced, in a 1986 paper with Marc Culler , 2 an object now known as the Culler–Vogtmann Outer space . The Outer space is a free group analog of the Teichmüller space of a Riemann surface and is particularly useful in the study of the group of outer automorphisms of the free group on n generators, Out( F n ) . Vogtmann is a Professor of Mathematics at Cornell University and The University of Warwick .  Biographical data  Vogtmann was inspired to pursue mathematics by a National Science Foundation summer program for high school students at the University of California, Berkeley . 3  She received a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971. Vogtmann then obtained a PhD in Mathematics, also from the University of California, Berkeley in 1977. 4 Her PhD advisor was John Wagoner and her doctoral thesis was on algebraic K-theory . 5  She then held positions at University of Michigan , Brandeis University and Columbia University . 6 Vogtmann has been a faculty member at Cornell University since 1984, and she became a Full Professor at Cornell in 1994. 7 In September 2013, she also joined the University of Warwick. She currently maintains positions both at Cornell and Warwick. 8  Vogtmann gave an Invited Lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, Spain in August 2006. 9 10  She gave the 2007 annual AWM  Noether Lecture titled "Automorphisms of Free Groups, Outer Space and Beyond" at the annual meeting of American Mathematical Society in New Orleans in January 2007. 11 12 Vogtmann was selected to deliver the Noether Lecture for "her fundamental contributions to geometric group theory; in particular, to the study of the automorphism group of a free group". 13  Vogtmann has been the Vice-President of the American Mathematical Society (2003–2006). 14 15 She has been elected to serve as a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Mathematical Society for the period February 2008 – January 2013. 16  Vogtmann is an Editorial Board member of the journal Algebraic and Geometric Topology . 17 She is also a member of the ArXiv Advisory Board. 18  Since 1986 Vogtmann has been a co-organizer of the annual conference called the Cornell Topology Festival 19 that usually takes places at Cornell University each May.  On June 21–25, 2010 a 'VOGTMANNFEST' Geometric Group Theory conference in honor of Karen Vogtmann's birthday was held in Luminy , France. 20  In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 21  Mathematical contributions  Vogtmann's early work concerned homological properties of orthogonal groups associated to quadratic forms over various fields . 22 23  Vogtmann's most important contribution came in a 1986 paper with Marc Culler called "Moduli of graphs and automorphisms of free groups". 24 The paper introduced an object that came to be known as Culler–Vogtmann Outer space . The Outer space X n , associated to a free group  F n , is a free group analog 25 of the Teichmüller space of a Riemann surface . Instead of marked conformal structures (or, in an equivalent model, hyperbolic structures) on a surface, points of the Outer space are represented by volume-one marked metric graphs . A marked metric graph consists of a homotopy equivalence between a wedge of n circles and a finite connected graph Γ without degree-one and degree-two vertices, where Γ is equipped with a volume-one metric structure, that is, assignment of positive real lengths to edges of Γ so that the sum of the lengths of all edges is equal to one. Points of X n can also be thought of as free and discrete minimal isometric actions F n on real trees where the quotient graph has volume one.  By construction the Outer space X n is a finite-dimensional simplicial complex equipped with a natural action of Out( F n ) which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler–Vogtmann 1986 paper, 26 obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space X n is contractible. Thus the quotient space  X n /Out( F n ) is "almost" a classifying space for Out( F n ) and it can be thought of as a classifying space over Q . Moreover, Out( F n ) is known to be virtually torsion-free, so for any torsion-free subgroup  H of Out( F n ) the action of H on X n is discrete and free, so that X n / H is a classifying space for H . For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining homological and cohomological information about Out( F n ). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved 27 that Out( F n ) has virtual cohomological dimension 2 n − 3.  In their 1986 paper Culler and Vogtmann do not assign X n a specific name. According to Vogtmann, 28 the term Outer space for the complex X n was later coined by Peter Shalen . In subsequent years the Outer space became a central object in the study of Out( F n ) . In particular, the Outer space has a natural compactification, similar to Thurston 's compactification of the Teichmüller space , and studying the action of Out( F n ) on this compactification yields interesting information about dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups . 29 30 31 32  Much of Vogtmann's subsequent work concerned the study of the Outer space X n , particularly its homotopy, homological and cohomological properties, and related questions for Out( F n ). For example, Hatcher and Vogtmann 33 34 obtained a number of homological stability results for Out( F n ) and Aut( F n ).  In her papers with Conant, 35 36 37 Vogtmann explored the connection found by Maxim Kontsevich between the cohomology of certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and the homology of Out( F n ).  A 2001 paper of Vogtmann, joint with Billera and Holmes, used the ideas of geometric group theory and CAT(0) geometry to study the space of phylogenetic trees , that is trees showing possible evolutionary relationships between different species. 38 Identifying precise evolutionary trees is an important basic problem in mathematical biology and one also needs to have good quantitative tools for estimating how accurate a particular evolutionary tree is. The paper of Billera, Vogtmann and Holmes produced a method for quantifying the difference between two evolutionary trees, effectively determining the distance between them. 39 The fact that the space of phylogenetic trees has "non-positively curved geometry", particularly the uniqueness of shortest paths or geodesics in CAT(0) spaces , allows using these results for practical statistical computations of estimating the confidence level of how accurate particular evolutionary tree is. A free software package implementing these algorithms has been developed and is actively used by biologists. 40  Selected works         See also   Geometric group theory  Teichmüller space  Mapping class group  Train track map   References  External links   Karen Vogtmann's webpage at Cornell University   Cornell Topology Festival   "  Category:20th-century mathematicians  Category:21st-century mathematicians  Category:American mathematicians  Category:Women mathematicians  Category:Topologists  Category:Group theorists  Category:Cornell University faculty  Category:1949 births  Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni  Category:Living people  Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society  Category:University of Michigan faculty     Biographies of Candidates 2002.
