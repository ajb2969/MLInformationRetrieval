Eaton's inequality

In probability theory, Eaton's inequality is a bound on the largest values of a linear combination of bounded random variables. This inequality was described in 1974 by Morris L. Eaton.1
Statement of the inequality
Let Xi be a set of real independent random variables, each with a expected value of zero and bounded by 1 ( | Xi | ≤ 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The variates do not have to be identically or symmetrically distributed. Let ai be a set of n fixed real numbers with



Eaton showed that



where φ(x) is the probability density function of the standard normal distribution.
A related bound is Edelman's



where Φ(x) is cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
Pinelis has shown that Eaton's bound can be sharpened:2



A set of critical values for Eaton's bound have been determined.3

Let ai be a set of independent Rademacher random variables – P( ai = 1 ) = P( ai = −1 ) = 1/2. Let Z be a normally distributed variate with a mean 0 and variance of 1. Let bi be a set of n fixed real numbers such that



This last condition is required by the Riesz–Fischer theorem which states that that

for f(x) = | x |p. The case for p ≥ 3 was proved by Whittle4 and p ≥ 2 was proved by Haagerup.5
If f(x) = eλx with λ ≥ 0 then

The constant in the last inequality is approximately 4.4634.
An alternative bound is also known:8



This last bound is related to the Hoeffding's inequality.
In the uniform case where all the bi = n−1/2 the maximum value of Sn is n1/2. In this case van Zuijlen has shown that9
