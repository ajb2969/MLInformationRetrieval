   Stellar aberration (derivation from Lorentz transformation)      Stellar aberration (derivation from Lorentz transformation)   Stellar aberration is an astronomical phenomenon "which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects". It can be proven mathematically that stellar aberration is due to the change of the astronomer's inertial frame of reference . The formula is derived with the use of Lorentz transformation of the star's coordinates .  As the astronomer John Herschel has already explained in 1844, the stellar aberration does not depend on the relative velocity of the star towards Earth. 1 Otherwise eclipsing binary stars would appear to be separated, in stark contrast to observation: both stars are rotating with high speed —and ever changing and different velocity vectors— around each other, but they appear as one spot all the time.  Stellar aberration is only due to the change of the astronomer's inertial frame of reference  In the year 1926 the astrophysicist Robert Emden published the article Aberration und Relativitätstheorie in the journal Naturwissenschaften . 2 In this article he states that the direction of a light ray isn't influenced by the motion of the star or by the motion of Earth. 3 At that time, the opponents of the special theory of relativity reasoned that the theory must be flawed, because it would state that the stellar aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star — which would be in contradiction to observation — and R. Emden's article explains that the special theory of relativity does not predict this. Today, the special theory of relativity isn't contested anymore but there are still articles that suggest that the aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star. 4  Although a (relativistic) velocity-addition formula can be used to explain stellar aberration, (see Aberration of light ), another (relativistic) explanation using only the Lorentz transformation is also possible, as will be demonstrated. This derivation only uses the star's coordinates at the time of emission, and therefore has the formal advantage there is no place for the relative velocity of the star towards the astronomer and therefore it is evident that the observed position doesn't depend on the star's velocity — provided that the resultant change of position is much smaller than the distance between star and Earth. 5 The observed position of the star wouldn't depend on Earth's motion either, if the astronomer could use the same inertial frame of reference all the time. But of course that is technically impossible, 6 the astronomer uses his current rest frame and these current rest frames are different at different times as Earth orbits around the Sun. It is mathematically convenient to declare the position of star in a rest frame of the Sun (more exactly: the center of mass of the Solar System) as the "real" position and that the difference to this "real" position derives form the "aberration". 7  Sample calculation  S and S' are (quasi-)inertial frames of reference and the reference frame S' is in uniform motion with v x = 0,5c relative to S, such that in the future the star comes nearer to the origin of the coordinate system (and consequently further afar in the past). The x-,y- and z-axes of both systems ought to be parallel and at time t=t'=0 the origins of both systems ought to coincide. Therefore one gets according to Lorentz transformation    β  =   v  /  c       β    v  c     \scriptstyle\beta=v/c   ,    γ  =   1  /    1  -   β  2          γ    1      1   superscript  β  2        \scriptstyle\gamma=1/\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}   : y'=y ; z=z';     x  ′   =   γ  ⋅   (   x  -    β  ⋅  c   t    )         superscript  x  normal-′    normal-⋅  γ    x     normal-⋅  β  c   t       \scriptstyle x^{\prime}=\gamma\cdot(x-\beta\cdot ct)     Suppose now that the star emitted a light signal at time      c    t  1    =   -    5   L  y          c   subscript  t  1        5  L  y      \scriptstyle c\,t_{1}=-5\,Ly   at location      x  1   =    4   L   y     ,     y  1   =    3   L   y     ,    z  1   =  0       formulae-sequence     subscript  x  1     4  L  y     formulae-sequence     subscript  y  1     3  L  y       subscript  z  1   0      \scriptstyle x_{1}=4\,Ly\;,\;y_{1}=3\,Ly\;,\;z_{1}=0   (S coordinates) and that this light signal is received by an astronomer at time      c    t  2    =  0        c   subscript  t  2    0    \scriptstyle c\,t_{2}=0   at location      x  2   =   0    ,     y  2   =   0    ,    z  2   =  0       formulae-sequence     subscript  x  2   0    formulae-sequence     subscript  y  2   0      subscript  z  2   0      \scriptstyle x_{2}=0\;,\;y_{2}=0\;,\;z_{2}=0   .

Two-dimensional problem  Derivation of the formula for motion along the x-axis  For the derivation it is assumed, that the light signal only travels through space regions where the gravitation field is negligible. Hence is suffices to use special relativity and the path of the light signal is a straight line in any inertial frame of reference.  Observation in the rest frame S of the center of mass of our Solar System  The rest frame of the center of mass (barycenter) is a very good 9 quasi-inertial frame of reference for periods of time in the order of thousands of years, since our solar system needs about 230 million years ( galactic year ) to move completely around the center of the Milky Way . The space coordinates of this frame of reference form a Cartesian coordinate system .  In the reference frame S    (   x  1   |   y  1   |  0  |   c    t  1   )     fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-|   subscript  y  1   normal-|  0  normal-|  c   subscript  t  1   normal-)    (x_{1}|y_{1}|0|c\,t_{1})   with      c    t  1    <  0        c   subscript  t  1    0    c\,t_{1}<0   and     (   x  1   |   y  1   )   ≠   (  0  |  0  )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-|   subscript  y  1   normal-)     fragments  normal-(  0  normal-|  0  normal-)     (x_{1}|y_{1})\neq(0|0)   are the (space-time) coordinates at which the star emits a light signal and    (  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  )     fragments  normal-(  0  normal-|  0  normal-|  0  normal-|  0  normal-)    (0|0|0|0)   are the coordinates at which the astronomer receives the light signal.  In reference frame S the light signal starts at     t  1   <  0       subscript  t  1   0    t_{1}<0   and stops at time     t  2   =  0       subscript  t  2   0    t_{2}=0   and therefore the light signal did cover the distance    d  =   c  ⋅   (   0  -   t  1    )    =   -    c    t  1           d   normal-⋅  c    0   subscript  t  1              c   subscript  t  1        d=c\cdot(0-t_{1})=-c\,t_{1}   .  In S the path of the light signal is a straight line and it forms an angle   δ   δ   \delta   with the x-axis with     sin  δ   =    y  1   d   =    y  1    -    c    t  1              δ      subscript  y  1   d           subscript  y  1       c   subscript  t  1         \sin\delta=\frac{y_{1}}{d}=\frac{y_{1}}{-c\,t_{1}}   and     cos  δ   =    x  1    -    c    t  1            δ      subscript  x  1       c   subscript  t  1        \cos\delta=\frac{x_{1}}{-c\,t_{1}}     Observation in the inertial frame of reference S' which is in uniform motion (relative to S) along the x-axis  The origin of the reference frame S' is in uniform motion relative to S with    (   v   |  0  |   0   )      v    0   0    (v|0|0)   , i.e. moves along the x-axis, and the x-,y- und z-axes of S' and S are parallel to each other and at time    t  =   t  ′   =  0        t   superscript  t  normal-′        0     \scriptstyle t=t^{\prime}=0   the origins of S and S' coincide.

According to the Lorentz transformation one gets      x  1  ′   =   γ  ⋅   (    x  1   -    β  ⋅   c     t  1     )     ,     y  1  ′   =   y  1    ,     z  1  ′   =  0   ,     c    t  1  ′    =   γ  ⋅   (     c    t  1    -   β  ⋅   x  1     )          formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  x  1   normal-′    normal-⋅  γ     subscript  x  1      normal-⋅  β  c    subscript  t  1        formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  y  1   normal-′    subscript  y  1     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  z  1   normal-′   0       c   superscript   subscript  t  1   normal-′     normal-⋅  γ      c   subscript  t  1     normal-⋅  β   subscript  x  1           x_{1}^{\prime}=\gamma\cdot(x_{1}-\beta\cdot c\,t_{1}),y_{1}^{\prime}=y_{1},z_{%

In S' the path of the light signal is a straight line, too. It forms an angle    δ  ′     superscript  δ  normal-′    \delta^{\prime}   with the x'-axis and one gets:       sin   δ  ′    =    y  1  ′     d   ′    =    y  1    -    c    t  1  ′      =    y  1    -   γ  ⋅   (     c    t  1    -   β  ⋅   x  1     )      =    y  1    -     c    t  1    ⋅  γ  ⋅   (   1  -   β  ⋅    x  1     c    t  1       )      =     y  1    -    c    t  1       γ  ⋅   (   1  +   β  ⋅    x  1    -    c    t  1        )     =    sin  δ    γ  ⋅   (   1  +   β  ⋅   cos  δ     )              superscript  δ  normal-′       superscript   subscript  y  1   normal-′    superscript  d  normal-′            subscript  y  1       c   superscript   subscript  t  1   normal-′              subscript  y  1      normal-⋅  γ      c   subscript  t  1     normal-⋅  β   subscript  x  1                subscript  y  1      normal-⋅    c   subscript  t  1    γ    1   normal-⋅  β     subscript  x  1     c   subscript  t  1                    subscript  y  1       c   subscript  t  1       normal-⋅  γ    1   normal-⋅  β     subscript  x  1       c   subscript  t  1                   δ    normal-⋅  γ    1   normal-⋅  β    δ          \sin\delta^{\prime}=\frac{y_{1}^{\prime}}{d\,^{\prime}}=\frac{y_{1}}{-c\,t_{1}%

The astronomer orbits (with Earth) around the Sun in one year and furthermore rotates around the axis of Earth in one day. His current rest frame S' therefore has different velocities relative to the rest frame S of the barycenter of the Solar System at different times. Hence the astronomer observes, that the position of the star changes. The formula is derived under the condition that the change of the position of the star and of Earth is negligible in the period of observation 12 That is correct for almost all stars: The amplitude of the parallax of a star in a distance of ≥ n parsec is ≤ 1/n ".  Stellar aberration due to the orbit of Earth (around the Sun)  The mean orbital speed of Earth is      v  e   =     2  ⋅  π  ⋅   1    A  E    365  ,    25   d     =  29   ,     78   k  m   /  s      formulae-sequence       subscript  v  e        normal-⋅  2  π  1   A  E    365    25  d          29        78  k  m   s     v_{e}=\frac{2\cdot\pi\cdot 1\,AE}{365,25\,d}=29,78\,km/s   , and therefore      v  e   c   =   0  ,  00009935          subscript  v  e   c    0  00009935     \frac{v_{e}}{c}=0,00009935   .  ->      v  c   ⋅    180  ∘   π    =   20  ,   5  ′′         normal-⋅    v  c      superscript  180    π     20   superscript  5  ′′      \frac{v}{c}\cdot\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}=20,5^{\prime\prime}   .       k  A   =   20  ,   5  ′′         subscript  k  A    20   superscript  5  ′′      k_{A}=20,5^{\prime\prime}   is dubbed constant of aberration for the annual aberration. 13  Stellar aberration due to Earth's rotation  An astronomer at the latitude    φ   φ   \varphi   rotates in 24 hours around the axis of Earth. His speed of rotation is therefore     v  r   =    cos    φ  ⋅   40000    k  m      1   d    =   cos     φ  ⋅   463    m   /  s           subscript  v  r          normal-⋅  φ  40000   k  m      1  d                normal-⋅  φ  463   m   s       v_{r}=\frac{\cos\varphi\cdot 40000\,km}{1\,d}=\cos\varphi\cdot 463\,m/s   . Hence      v  r   c   =    cos   φ  ⋅  1    ,   54  ⋅   10   -  6             subscript  v  r   c       normal-⋅  φ  1     normal-⋅  54   superscript  10    6        \frac{v_{r}}{c}=\cos\varphi\cdot 1,54\cdot 10^{-6}   .

An estimation for the time of period of circulation is 230 million years (estimations vary between 225 and 250 million years). 14 15 As the estimation for the distance between our solar system and the center of the Milky Way is about 28000 Ly , the assumed orbital speed of our solar system is    v  =       2  π   ⋅  280000  ⋅  9   ,    461  ⋅    10  15     m      230  ⋅   10  6   ⋅  365   ,   25  ⋅  24  ⋅  3600      ≈     230   k  m   /  s         v      normal-⋅    2  π   280000  9      normal-⋅  461   superscript  10  15    m      normal-⋅  230   superscript  10  6   365    normal-⋅  25  24  3600              230  k  m   s      \scriptstyle v=\frac{2\pi\cdot 280000\cdot 9,461\cdot 10^{15}\,m}{230\cdot 10^%

Therefore, in one year the aberration angle could change (at max.)    2  ,    6  ′   ⋅       2  π   ⋅   1    a     230000000   a         2   normal-⋅   superscript  6  normal-′        normal-⋅    2  π   1   a     230000000  a       \scriptstyle 2,6^{\prime}\cdot\frac{2\pi\cdot 1\,a}{230000000\,a}   = 4,3 µas ( microarcseconds ). This very small value isn't detectable now, perhaps it's possible with the planned mission of the Gaia spacecraft . 16  See also   Aberration of light  Parallax in astronomy   Notes    References  "  Category:Special relativity  Category:Astrometry     ↩  (14.
