   Rhamnulokinase      Rhamnulokinase   In enzymology , a rhamnulokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-rhamnulose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + L-rhamnulose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-rhamnulose , whereas its two products are ADP and L-rhamnulose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-rhamnulose 1-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include RhuK , rhamnulokinase (phosphorylating) , L-rhamnulokinase , L-rhamnulose kinase , and rhamnulose kinase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and fructose and mannose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes by Grueninger and Schulz with PDB accession codes , , , and .
