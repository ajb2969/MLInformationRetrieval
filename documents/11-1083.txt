D-methionine—pyruvate transaminase




D-methionine—pyruvate transaminase

In enzymology, a D-methionine—pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-methionine + pyruvate 
 
 
 
  4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate + L-alanine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-methionine and pyruvate, whereas its two products are 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate and L-alanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-methionine:pyruvate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include D-methionine transaminase, and D-methionine aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in d-alanine metabolism.
