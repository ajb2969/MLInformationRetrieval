   Parkland formula      Parkland formula  The '''Parkland formula''' is a burn [[formula]] used to estimate the amount of [[Fluid replacement|replacement fluid]] required for the first 24 hours in a [[burn]] patient so as to ensure they remain [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamically]] stable. {{cite web|title=Surgical Treatment of Burns : Treatment and management|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/934173-treatment|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=29 August 2012}} The milliliter amoun t of fluid required for the first 24 hours -usually Ringer's lactate - is four times the product of the body weight and the burn percentage (i.e. body surface area affected by burns). 1 The first half of the fluid is given within 8 hours from the burn incident, and the remaining over next 16 hours. Only second- and third-degree burn area are taken into consideration, as first-degree burns do not cause hemodynamically significant fluid shift to warrant fluid replacement. 2  The Parkland formula is mathematically expressed as: 3      V  =   4  ⋅  m  ⋅   (   A  ⋅  100   )        V   normal-⋅  4  m   normal-⋅  A  100      V=4\cdot m\cdot(A\cdot 100)     where mass is in kilograms (kg), area as a percentage of total body surface area, and volume is in milliliters (mL). For example, a person weighing 75 kg with burns to 20% of his or her body surface area would require 4 x 75 x 20 = 6,000 mL of fluid replacement within 24 hours. The first half of this amount is delivered within 8 hours from the burn incident, and the remaining fluid is delivered in the next 16 hours. 4  The burn percentage in adults can be estimated by applying the Wallace rule of nines (see total body surface area ): 9% for each arm, 18% for each leg, 18% for the front of the torso , 18% for the back of the torso, and 9% for the head and 1% for the perineum . 5  See also   Charles R.
