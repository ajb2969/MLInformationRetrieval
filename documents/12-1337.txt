Fractional coordinates

In crystallography, a fractional coordinate system is a coordinate system in which the edges of the unit cell are used as the basic vectors to describe the positions of atomic nuclei. The unit cell is a parallelepiped defined by the lengths of its edges a, b, c and angles between them α, β, γ as shown in the figure below.

Conversion to cartesian coordinates
If the fractional coordinate system has the same origin as the cartesian coordinate system, the a-axis is collinear with the x-axis, and the b-axis lies in the xy-plane, fractional coordinates can be converted to cartesian coordinates through the following transformation matrix:234



where 
 
 
 
  is the volume of a unit parallelepiped defined as



For the special case of a monoclinic cell (a common case) where α=γ=90° and β>90°, this gives:









Conversion from cartesian coordinates
The above fractional-to-cartesian transformation can be inverted as follows5
