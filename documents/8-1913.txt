   Preclosure operator      Preclosure operator   In topology , a preclosure operator , or Čech closure operator is a map between subsets of a set, similar to a topological closure operator , except that it is not required to be idempotent . That is, a preclosure operator obeys only three of the four Kuratowski closure axioms .  Definition  A preclosure operator on a set   X   X   X   is a map     [  ]   p     subscript   fragments  normal-[   normal-]   p    [\quad]_{p}           [  ]   p   :  𝒫   (  X  )   →  𝒫   (  X  )      fragments   subscript   fragments  normal-[   normal-]   p   normal-:  P   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)   normal-→  P   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     [\quad]_{p}:\mathcal{P}(X)\to\mathcal{P}(X)     where    𝒫   (  X  )       𝒫  X    \mathcal{P}(X)   is the power set of   X   X   X   .  The preclosure operator has to satisfy the following properties:         [  ∅  ]   p   =   ∅        subscript   delimited-[]    p      [\varnothing]_{p}=\varnothing\!   (Preservation of nullary unions);      A  ⊆    [  A  ]   p       A   subscript   delimited-[]  A   p     A\subseteq[A]_{p}   (Extensivity);        [   A  ∪  B   ]   p   =     [  A  ]   p   ∪    [  B  ]   p         subscript   delimited-[]    A  B    p      subscript   delimited-[]  A   p    subscript   delimited-[]  B   p      [A\cup B]_{p}=[A]_{p}\cup[B]_{p}   (Preservation of binary unions).   The last axiom implies the following:   4.    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   implies      [  A  ]   p   ⊆    [  B  ]   p        subscript   delimited-[]  A   p    subscript   delimited-[]  B   p     [A]_{p}\subseteq[B]_{p}   .   Topology  A set   A   A   A   is closed (with respect to the preclosure) if      [  A  ]   p   =  A       subscript   delimited-[]  A   p   A    [A]_{p}=A   . A set    U  ⊂  X      U  X    U\subset X   is open (with respect to the preclosure) if    A  =   X  ∖  U       A    X  U     A=X\setminus U   is closed. The collection of all open sets generated by the preclosure operator is a topology .  The closure operator cl on this topological space satisfies      [  A  ]   p   ⊆   cl   (  A  )         subscript   delimited-[]  A   p    cl  A     [A]_{p}\subseteq\operatorname{cl}(A)   for all    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   .  Examples  Premetrics  Given   d   d   d   a premetric on   X   X   X   , then        [  A  ]   p   =   {   x  ∈  X   :    d   (  x  ,  A  )    =  0   }        subscript   delimited-[]  A   p    conditional-set    x  X       d   x  A    0      [A]_{p}=\{x\in X:d(x,A)=0\}     is a preclosure on   X   X   X   .  Sequential spaces  The sequential closure operator      [  ]   seq     subscript   fragments  normal-[   normal-]   seq    [\quad]_{\mbox{seq}}   is a preclosure operator. Given a topology   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   with respect to which the sequential closure operator is defined, the topological space    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    (X,\mathcal{T})   is a sequential space if and only if the topology    𝒯  seq     subscript  𝒯  seq    \mathcal{T}_{\mbox{seq}}   generated by     [  ]   seq     subscript   fragments  normal-[   normal-]   seq    [\quad]_{\mbox{seq}}   is equal to   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   , that is, if     𝒯  seq   =  𝒯       subscript  𝒯  seq   𝒯    \mathcal{T}_{\mbox{seq}}=\mathcal{T}   .
