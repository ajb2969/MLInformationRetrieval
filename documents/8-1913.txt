Preclosure operator

In topology, a preclosure operator, or Čech closure operator is a map between subsets of a set, similar to a topological closure operator, except that it is not required to be idempotent. That is, a preclosure operator obeys only three of the four Kuratowski closure axioms.
Definition
A preclosure operator on a set 
 
 
 
  is a map 
 
 




where 
 
 
 
  is the power set of 
 
 
 
 .
The preclosure operator has to satisfy the following properties:



 
  (Preservation of nullary unions);


 
  (Extensivity);


 
  (Preservation of binary unions).

The last axiom implies the following:

Topology
A set 
 
 
 
  is closed (with respect to the preclosure) if 
 
 
 
 . A set 
 
 
 
  is open (with respect to the preclosure) if 
 
 
 
  is closed. The collection of all open sets generated by the preclosure operator is a topology.
The closure operator cl on this topological space satisfies 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
Premetrics
Given 
 
 
 
  a premetric on 
 
 
 
 , then



is a preclosure on 
 
 
 
 .
Sequential spaces
The sequential closure operator

 
  is a preclosure operator. Given a topology 
 
 
 
  with respect to which the sequential closure operator is defined, the topological space 
 
 
 
  is a sequential space if and only if the topology 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 , that is, if 
 
 
 
 .
