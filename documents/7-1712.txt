   Poincaré inequality      Poincaré inequality   In mathematics , the Poincaré inequality is a result in the theory of Sobolev spaces , named after the French  mathematician  Henri Poincaré . The inequality allows one to obtain bounds on a function using bounds on its derivatives and the geometry of its domain of definition. Such bounds are of great importance in the modern, direct methods of the calculus of variations . A very closely related result is the Friedrichs' inequality .  Statement of the inequality  The classical Poincaré inequality  Let p , so that 1 ≤ p 0 1, p (Ω) Sobolev space ,         ∥  u  ∥     L  p    (  Ω  )     ≤   C    ∥   ∇  u   ∥     L  p    (  Ω  )       ,       subscript   norm  u      superscript  L  p   normal-Ω      C   subscript   norm   normal-∇  u       superscript  L  p   normal-Ω       \|u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}\leq C\|\nabla u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega)},     The Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality  Assume that 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and that Ω is a bounded  connected  open subset of the n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n with a Lipschitz boundary (i.e., Ω is a Lipschitz  domain ). Then there exists a constant C , depending only on Ω and p , such that for every function u in the Sobolev space W 1, p (Ω),         ∥   u  -   u  Ω    ∥     L  p    (  Ω  )     ≤   C    ∥   ∇  u   ∥     L  p    (  Ω  )       ,       subscript   norm    u   subscript  u  normal-Ω        superscript  L  p   normal-Ω      C   subscript   norm   normal-∇  u       superscript  L  p   normal-Ω       \|u-u_{\Omega}\|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}\leq C\|\nabla u\|_{L^{p}(\Omega)},     where       u  Ω   =    1   |  Ω  |      ∫  Ω    u   (  y  )   d  y          subscript  u  normal-Ω       1    normal-Ω      subscript   normal-Ω     u  y  normal-d  y       u_{\Omega}=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{\Omega}u(y)\,\mathrm{d}y     is the average value of u over Ω, with |Ω| standing for the Lebesgue measure of the domain Ω. When Ω is a ball, the above inequality is called a (p,p)-Poincare inequality; for more general domains Ω, the above is more familiarly known as a Sobolev inequality.  Generalizations  In the context of metric measure spaces (for example, sub-Riemannian manifolds), such spaces support a (q,p)-Poincare inequality for some     1  ≤  q   ,   p  <  ∞      formulae-sequence    1  q     p      1\leq q,p<\infty   if there are constants C and    λ  ≥  1      λ  1    \lambda\geq 1   so that for each ball B in the space,        μ    (  B  )    -   1  /  q       ∥   u  -   u  B    ∥     L  q    (  B  )      ≤   C  rad   (  B  )   μ    (  B  )    -   1  /  p       ∥   ∇  u   ∥     L  p    (   λ  B   )       .        μ   superscript  B      1  q      subscript   norm    u   subscript  u  B        superscript  L  q   B       C  rad  B  μ   superscript  B      1  p      subscript   norm   normal-∇  u       superscript  L  p     λ  B        \mu(B)^{-1/q}\|u-u_{B}\|_{L^{q}(B)}\leq C\text{rad}(B)\mu(B)^{-1/p}\|\nabla u%
 \|_{L^{p}(\lambda B)}.     In the context of metric measure spaces,    |   ∇  u   |       normal-∇  u     |\nabla u|   is the minimal p-weak upper gradient of u in the sense of Heinonen and Koskela [J. Heinonen and P. Koskela, Quasiconformal maps in metric spaces with controlled geometry, Acta Math. 181 (1998), 1–61]  There exist other generalizations of the Poincaré inequality to other Sobolev spaces. For example, the following (taken from ) is a Poincaré inequality for the Sobolev space H 1/2 ( T 2 ), i.e. the space of functions u in the L 2 space of the unit torus  T 2 with Fourier transform  û satisfying         [  u  ]     H   1  /  2     (   𝐓  2   )    2   =    ∑   k  ∈   𝐙  2       |  k  |     |    u  ^    (  k  )    |   2     <   +  ∞    :      normal-:       superscript   subscript   delimited-[]  u      superscript  H    1  2     superscript  𝐓  2     2     subscript     k   superscript  𝐙  2         k    superscript       normal-^  u   k    2                absent    [u]_{H^{1/2}(\mathbf{T}^{2})}^{2}=\sum_{k\in\mathbf{Z}^{2}}|k|\big|\hat{u}(k)%
 \big|^{2}<+\infty:     there exists a constant C such that, for every u ∈ H 1/2 ( T 2 ) with u identically zero on an open set E ⊆ T 2 ,         ∫   𝐓  2        |   u   (  x  )    |   2    d  x    ≤   C   (   1  +   1   cap   (   E  ×   {  0  }    )      )     [  u  ]     H   1  /  2     (   𝐓  2   )    2     ,        subscript    superscript  𝐓  2       superscript      u  x    2   normal-d  x      C    1    1    cap    E   0        superscript   subscript   delimited-[]  u      superscript  H    1  2     superscript  𝐓  2     2      \int_{\mathbf{T}^{2}}|u(x)|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}x\leq C\left(1+\frac{1}{\mathrm{cap%
 }(E\times\{0\})}\right)[u]_{H^{1/2}(\mathbf{T}^{2})}^{2},     where cap( E × {0}) denotes the harmonic capacity of E × {0} when thought of as a subset of R 3 .  The Poincaré constant  The optimal constant C in the Poincaré inequality is sometimes known as the Poincaré constant for the domain Ω. Determining the Poincaré constant is, in general, a very hard task that depends upon the value of p and the geometry of the domain Ω. Certain special cases are tractable, however. For example, if Ω is a bounded , convex , Lipschitz domain with diameter d , then the Poincaré constant is at most d /2 for p = 1,     d  2   /   π  2        superscript  d  2    superscript  π  2     \scriptstyle{d^{2}/\pi^{2}}   for p = 2 (; ), and this is the best possible estimate on the Poincaré constant in terms of the diameter alone. For smooth functions, this can be understood as an application of the isoperimetric inequality to the function's level sets . 1 In one dimension, this is Wirtinger's inequality for functions .  However, in some special cases the constant C can be determined concretely. For example, for p = 2, it is well known that over the domain of unit isosceles right triangle, C = 1/π ( \scriptstyle{d=\sqrt{2}} ). (See, for instance,.)  Furthermore, for a smooth, bounded domain   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , since the Rayleigh quotient for the Laplace operator in the space     W  0   1  ,  2     (  Ω  )        subscript   superscript  W   1  2    0   normal-Ω    W^{1,2}_{0}(\Omega)   is minimized by the eigenfunction corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue λ 1 of the (negative) Laplacian, it is a simple consequence that, for any    u  ∈    W  0   1  ,  2     (  Ω  )        u     subscript   superscript  W   1  2    0   normal-Ω     u\in W^{1,2}_{0}(\Omega)   ,        ||  u  ||    L  2   2   ≤    λ  1   -  1      ||   ∇  u   ||    L  2   2         superscript   subscript   norm  u    superscript  L  2    2      superscript   subscript  λ  1     1     superscript   subscript   norm   normal-∇  u     superscript  L  2    2      \displaystyle||u||_{L^{2}}^{2}\leq\lambda_{1}^{-1}||\nabla u||_{L^{2}}^{2}     and furthermore, that the constant λ 1 is optimal.
