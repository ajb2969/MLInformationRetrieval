   Fuhrmann circle      Fuhrmann circle   In geometry , the Fuhrmann circle of a triangle is the circle with a diameter of the line segment between the orthocenter  H and the Nagel point  N .  The radius of the Fuhrmann circle of a triangle with sides a , b , and c and circumradius  R is       R           a  3   -    a  2   b   -   a   b  2     +   b  3    -    a  2   c    +   3  a  b  c    -    b  2   c   -   a   c  2     +   c  3     a  b  c      ,      R                   superscript  a  3      superscript  a  2   b     a   superscript  b  2      superscript  b  3       superscript  a  2   c      3  a  b  c       superscript  b  2   c     a   superscript  c  2      superscript  c  3      a  b  c       R\sqrt{\frac{a^{3}-a^{2}b-ab^{2}+b^{3}-a^{2}c+3abc-b^{2}c-ac^{2}+c^{3}}{abc}},     which is also the distance between the circumcenter and incenter . 1  See also   Nagel point  Incircle and excircles of a triangle   Notes  "  Category:Triangles     â†©
