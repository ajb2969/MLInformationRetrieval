   Tyrosine-ester sulfotransferase      Tyrosine-ester sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a tyrosine-ester sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + L-tyrosine methyl ester   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + L-tyrosine methyl ester 4-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and L-tyrosine methyl ester , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and L-tyrosine methyl ester 4-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:L-tyrosine-methyl-ester sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include aryl sulfotransferase IV , and L-tyrosine methyl ester sulfotransferase .  References       "  Category:EC 2.8.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
