   Champernowne constant      Champernowne constant   In mathematics , the Champernowne constant  is a transcendental  real  constant whose decimal expansion has important properties. It is named after mathematician  D. G. Champernowne , who published it as an undergraduate in 1933.  For base 10 , the number is defined by concatenating representations of successive integers:   .   Champernowne constants can also be constructed in other bases, similarly, for example:     .   The Champernowne constant can be expressed exactly as an infinite series :       C  10   =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     ∑   k  =   10   n  -  1       10  n   -  1     k   10    n   (    k  -   10   n  -  1     +  1   )    +   9     ∑   l  =  1    n  -  1       10   l  -  1    l               subscript  C  10     superscript   subscript     n  1        superscript   subscript     k   superscript  10    n  1         superscript  10  n   1      k   superscript  10      n      k   superscript  10    n  1     1      9    superscript   subscript     l  1      n  1       superscript  10    l  1    l            C_{10}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=10^{n-1}}^{10^{n}-1}\frac{k}{10^{n(k-10^{n-1%
 }+1)+9\sum_{l=1}^{n-1}10^{l-1}l}}     and this series generalizes to arbitrary bases   b   b   b   by replacing 10 and 9 with   b   b   b   and    b  −  1      b  normal-−  1    b−1   respectively.  The Champernowne word or Barbier word is the sequence of digits of C k . 1 2  Normality  A real number  x is said to be normal if its digits in every base follow a uniform distribution: all digits being equally likely, all pairs of digits equally likely, all triplets of digits equally likely, etc. x is said to be normal in base  b if its digits in base b follow a uniform distribution.  If we denote a digit string as [ a 0 , a 1 ,...], then, in base ten, we would expect strings [0],[1],[2],...,[9] to occur 1/10 of the time, strings [0,0],[0,1],...,[9,8],[9,9] to occur 1/100 of the time, and so on, in a normal number.  Champernowne proved that    C  10     subscript  C  10    C_{10}   is normal in base ten, although it is possible that it is not normal in other bases. 3  Continued fraction expansion  The simple continued fraction expansion of Champernowne's constant has been studied as well. Kurt Mahler showed that the constant is transcendental ; 4 therefore its continued fraction does not terminate (because it is not rational ) and is aperiodic (because it is not an irreducible quadratic).  The terms in the continued fraction expansion exhibit very erratic behaviour, with huge terms appearing between many small ones. For example, in base 10,   C 10 = [0; 8, 9, 1, 149083, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 15,   4 57540 11139 10310 76483 64662 82429 56118 59960 39397 10457 55500 06620 04393 09026 26592 56314 93795 32077 47128 65631 38641 20937 55035 52094 60718 30899 84575 80146 98631 48833 59214 17830 10987,  6, 1, 1, 21, 1, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 7, 2, 1, 83, 1, 156, 4, 58, 8, 54, ...].       The large number at position 19 has 166 digits, and the next very large term at position 41 of the continued fraction has 2504 digits. The fact that there are such large numbers as terms of the continued fraction expansion is equivalent to saying that the convergents obtained by stopping before these large numbers provide an exceptionally good approximation of the Champernowne constant. For example, truncating before the 4th partial quotient, we obtain the partial sum     10  /  81   =   0.   123456790  ¯          10  81     0.   normal-¯  123456790      10/81=0.\overline{123456790}   , which approximates Champernowne's constant with an error of about , while truncating just before the 18th partial quotient, we get        60499999499  490050000000   =   0.123456789    101112  …  96979900010203040506070809   ¯     ,        60499999499  490050000000     0.123456789   normal-¯    101112  normal-…  96979900010203040506070809       \frac{60499999499}{490050000000}=0.123456789\overline{101112\ldots 96979900010%

Irrationality measure  The irrationality measure of    C  10     subscript  C  10    C_{10}   is     μ   (   C  10   )    =  10        μ   subscript  C  10    10    \mu(C_{10})=10   , and more generally     μ   (   C  b   )    =  b        μ   subscript  C  b    b    \mu(C_{b})=b   for any base    b  ≥  2      b  2    b\geq 2   . 5  See also   Copeland–Erdős constant , a similar normal number, defined using the prime numbers  Liouville's constant , another constant defined by its decimal representation   References     External links    The fantastic pencil and the Champernowne constant   "  Category:Transcendental numbers  Category:Mathematical constants  Category:Number theory  Category:Real transcendental numbers     Cassaigne & Nicolas (2010) p.165 ↩  * ↩  D.
