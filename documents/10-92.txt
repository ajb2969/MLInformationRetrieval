   Discontinuous Galerkin method      Discontinuous Galerkin method   In applied mathematics, discontinuous Galerkin methods (DG methods) form a class of numerical methods for solving differential equations . They combine features of the finite element and the finite volume framework and have been successfully applied to hyperbolic , elliptic , parabolic and mixed form problems arising from a wide range of applications. DG methods have in particular received considerable interest for problems with a dominant first-order part, e.g. in electrodynamics , fluid mechanics and plasma physics .  Discontinuous Galerkin methods were first proposed and analyzed in the early 1970s as a technique to numerically solve partial differential equations. In 1973 Reed and Hill introduced a DG method to solve the hyperbolic neutron transport equation.  The origin of the DG method for elliptic problems cannot be traced back to a single publication as features such as jump penalization in the modern sense were developed gradually. However, among the early influential contributors were Babuška , J.-L. Lions , Nitsche and Miloš Zlámal. DG methods for elliptic problems were already developed in a paper by Baker in the setting of 4th order equations in 1977. A more complete account of the historical development and an introduction to DG methods for elliptic problems is given in a publication by Arnold, Brezzi, Cockburn and Marini. A number of research directions and challenges on DG methods are collected in the proceedings volume edited by Cockburn, Karniadakis and Shu.  Overview  Much like the continuous Galerkin (CG) method , the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is a finite element method formulated relative to a weak formulation of a particular model system. Unlike traditional CG methods that are conforming , the DG method works over a trial space of functions that are only piecewise continuous , and thus often comprise more inclusive function spaces than the finite-dimensional inner product subspaces utilized in conforming methods.  As an example, consider the continuity equation for a scalar unknown   ρ   ρ   \rho   in a spatial domain   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   without "sources" or "sinks" :          ∂  ρ    ∂  t    +   ∇  ⋅  𝐉    =  0   ,            ρ     t     normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐉    0    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}=0,   where   𝐉   𝐉   \mathbf{J}   is the flux of   ρ   ρ   \rho   .  Now consider the finite-dimensional space of discontinuous piecewise polynomial functions over the spatial domain   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   restricted to a discrete triangulation     Ω  h     subscript  normal-Ω  h    \Omega_{h}   , written as       S  h  p    (   Ω  h   )   =   {   v   |   Ω   e  i      ∈   P  p    (   Ω   e  i    )   ,  ∀   Ω   e  i    ∈   Ω  h   }      fragments   superscript   subscript  S  h   p    fragments  normal-(   subscript  normal-Ω  h   normal-)     fragments  normal-{   subscript  v   fragments  normal-|   subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i        superscript  P  p    fragments  normal-(   subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i    normal-)   normal-,  for-all   subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i      subscript  normal-Ω  h   normal-}     S_{h}^{p}(\Omega_{h})=\{v_{|\Omega_{e_{i}}}\in P^{p}(\Omega_{e_{i}}),\ \ %
 \forall\Omega_{e_{i}}\in\Omega_{h}\}     for     P  p    (   Ω   e  i    )        superscript  P  p    subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i      P^{p}(\Omega_{e_{i}})   the space of polynomials with degrees less than or equal to   p   p   p   over element    Ω   e  i      subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i     \Omega_{e_{i}}   indexed by   i   i   i   . Then for finite element shape functions     N  j   ∈   P  p        subscript  N  j    superscript  P  p     N_{j}\in P^{p}   the solution is represented by         ρ  h   =    ∑   j  =  1    d  o  f  s      ρ  j  i    (  t  )    N  j  i    (  𝒙  )      ,    ∀  𝒙   ∈   Ω   e  i      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  ρ  h     superscript   subscript     j  1      d  o  f  s       superscript   subscript  ρ  j   i   t   superscript   subscript  N  j   i   𝒙        for-all  𝒙    subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i       \rho_{h}=\sum_{j=1}^{dofs}\rho_{j}^{i}(t)N_{j}^{i}(\boldsymbol{x}),\quad%
 \forall\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{e_{i}}.     Then similarly choosing a test function          ϕ  h    (  𝒙  )    =    ∑   j  =  1    d  o  f  s      ϕ  j  i    N  j  i    (  𝒙  )      ,    ∀  𝒙   ∈   Ω   e  i      ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  ϕ  h   𝒙     superscript   subscript     j  1      d  o  f  s       superscript   subscript  ϕ  j   i    superscript   subscript  N  j   i   𝒙        for-all  𝒙    subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i       \phi_{h}(\boldsymbol{x})=\sum_{j=1}^{dofs}\phi_{j}^{i}N_{j}^{i}(\boldsymbol{x}%
 ),\quad\forall\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_{e_{i}},     multiplying the continuity equation by    ϕ  h     subscript  ϕ  h    \phi_{h}   and integrating by parts in space , the semidiscrete DG formulation becomes:          d   d  t      ∫   Ω   e  i       ρ  h    ϕ  h   d  𝒙     +    ∫   ∂   Ω   e  i          ϕ  h    𝐉  h    ⋅  𝒏   d  𝒙     =    ∫   Ω   e  i       𝐉  h   ⋅   ∇    ϕ  h   d  𝒙       .            d    d  t      subscript    subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i        subscript  ρ  h    subscript  ϕ  h   d  𝒙       subscript      subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i         normal-⋅     subscript  ϕ  h    subscript  𝐉  h    𝒏   d  𝒙       subscript    subscript  normal-Ω   subscript  e  i      normal-⋅   subscript  𝐉  h    normal-∇     subscript  ϕ  h   d  𝒙        \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega_{e_{i}}}\rho_{h}\phi_{h}d\boldsymbol{x}+\int_{%
