  [31,1,3,3,3,3,31,1] |} The 8-demicubic honeycomb, or demiocteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 8-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb.
It is composed of two different types of facets. The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3}  and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets .
D8 lattice
The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D8 lattice.1 The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex vertex figure of the 8-demicubic honeycomb reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice.2 The best known is 240, from the E8 lattice and the 521 honeycomb.

The D
 
 
 
  lattice (also called D
 
 
 
 ) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2n-1 for n8).4 It is identical to the E8 lattice. At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 27=128 from lower dimension contact progression (2n-1), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1)).

The D
 
 
 
  lattice (also called D
 
 
 
  and C
 
 
 
 ) can be constructed by the union of all four D8 lattices:5 It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions.


∪  ∪  ∪  =  ∪ .


The kissing number of the D
 
 
 
  lattice is 16 (2n for n≥5).6 and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb, , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex Voronoi cell, .7
