It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb .  It is composed of two different types of facets . The 8-cubes become alternated into 8-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3,3}  and the alternated vertices create 8-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,3,4} facets .  D8 lattice  The vertex arrangement of the 8-demicubic honeycomb is the D 8 lattice . 1 The 112 vertices of the rectified 8-orthoplex  vertex figure of the 8-demicubic honeycomb reflect the kissing number 112 of this lattice. 2 The best known is 240, from the E 8 lattice and the 5 21 honeycomb .       E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   contains     D  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  D   8    {\tilde{D}}_{8}   as a subgroup of index 270. 3 Both     E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   and     D  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  D   8    {\tilde{D}}_{8}   can be seen as affine extensions of    D  8     subscript  D  8    D_{8}   from different nodes:  The D     8     +     subscript   superscript  absent    8    {}^{+}_{8}   lattice (also called D     8     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   8    {}^{2}_{8}   ) can be constructed by the union of two D8 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 240. (2 n-1 for n8). 4 It is identical to the E8 lattice . At 8-dimensions, the 240 contacts contain both the 2 7 =128 from lower dimension contact progression (2 n-1 ), and 16*7=112 from higher dimensions (2n(n-1)).    ∪  = .    The D     8     *     subscript   superscript  absent    8    {}^{*}_{8}   lattice (also called D     8     4     subscript   superscript  absent  4   8    {}^{4}_{8}   and C     8     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   8    {}^{2}_{8}   ) can be constructed by the union of all four D8 lattices : 5 It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic , the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions.    ∪  ∪  ∪  =  ∪ .    The kissing number of the D     8     *     subscript   superscript  absent    8    {}^{*}_{8}   lattice is 16 ( 2n for n≥5). 6 and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb , , containing all trirectified 8-orthoplex  Voronoi cell , . 7  See also   8-cubic honeycomb  Uniform polytope   Notes  References   Coxeter, H.S.M.
