   Plancherel measure      Plancherel measure   In mathematics , Plancherel measure is a measure defined on the set of irreducible unitary representations of a locally compact group    G   G   G   , that describes how the regular representation breaks up into irreducible unitary representations. In some cases the term Plancherel measure is applied specifically in the context of the group   G   G   G   being the finite symmetric group    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   ‚Äì see below. It is named after the Swiss mathematician Michel Plancherel for his work in representation theory .  Definition for finite groups  Let   G   G   G   be a finite group , we denote the set of its irreducible representations by    G  ‚àß     superscript  G     G^{\wedge}   . The corresponding Plancherel measure over the set    G  ‚àß     superscript  G     G^{\wedge}   is defined by        Œº   (  œÄ  )    =     (    dim   œÄ   )   2    |  G  |     ,        Œº  œÄ      superscript    dim  œÄ   2     G      \mu(\pi)=\frac{(\mathrm{dim}\,\pi)^{2}}{|G|},     where    œÄ  ‚àà   G  ‚àß       œÄ   superscript  G      \pi\in G^{\wedge}   , and    dim  œÄ      dim  œÄ    \mathrm{dim}\pi   denotes the dimension of the irreducible representation   œÄ   œÄ   \pi   . 1  Definition on the symmetric group    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}     An important special case is the case of the finite symmetric group     S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   , where   n   n   n   is a positive integer. For this group, the set    S  n  ‚àß     superscript   subscript  S  n      S_{n}^{\wedge}   of irreducible representations is in natural bijection with the set of integer partitions of   n   n   n   . For an irreducible representation associated with an integer partition   Œª   Œª   \lambda   , its dimension is known to be equal to    f  Œª     superscript  f  Œª    f^{\lambda}   , the number of standard Young tableaux of shape   Œª   Œª   \lambda   , so in this case Plancherel measure is often thought of as a measure on the set of integer partitions of given order n , given by        Œº   (  Œª  )    =     (   f  Œª   )   2    n  !     .        Œº  Œª      superscript   superscript  f  Œª   2     n      \mu(\lambda)=\frac{(f^{\lambda})^{2}}{n!}.    2  The fact that those probabilities sum up to 1 follows from the combinatorial identity         ‚àë   Œª  ‚ä¢  n      (   f  Œª   )   2    =   n  !    ,        subscript    proves  Œª  n     superscript   superscript  f  Œª   2      n     \sum_{\lambda\vdash n}(f^{\lambda})^{2}=n!,     which corresponds to the bijective nature of the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence .  Application  Plancherel measure appears naturally in combinatorial and probabilistic problems, especially in the study of longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation    œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   . As a result of its importance in that area, in many current research papers the term Plancherel measure almost exclusively refers to the case of the symmetric group    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   .  Connection to longest increasing subsequence  Let    L   (  œÉ  )       L  œÉ    L(\sigma)   denote the length of a longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation    œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   in    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   chosen according to the uniform distribution. Let   Œª   Œª   \lambda   denote the shape of the corresponding Young tableaux related to   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   by the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence . Then the following identity holds:        L   (  œÉ  )    =   Œª  1    ,        L  œÉ    subscript  Œª  1     L(\sigma)=\lambda_{1},\,     where    Œª  1     subscript  Œª  1    \lambda_{1}   denotes the length of the first row of   Œª   Œª   \lambda   . Furthermore, from the fact that the Robinson‚ÄìSchensted correspondence is bijective it follows that the distribution of   Œª   Œª   \lambda   is exactly the Plancherel measure on    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   . So, to understand the behavior of    L   (  œÉ  )       L  œÉ    L(\sigma)   , it is natural to look at    Œª  1     subscript  Œª  1    \lambda_{1}   with   Œª   Œª   \lambda   chosen according to the Plancherel measure in    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   , since these two random variables have the same probability distribution. 3  Poissonized Plancherel measure  Plancherel measure is defined on    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   for each integer   n   n   n   . In various studies of the asymptotic behavior of    L   (  œÉ  )       L  œÉ    L(\sigma)   as    n  ‚Üí  ‚àû     normal-‚Üí  n     n\rightarrow\infty   , it has proved useful 4 to extend the measure to a measure, called the Poissonized Plancherel measure , on the set    ùí´  *     superscript  ùí´     \mathcal{P}^{*}   of all integer partitions. For any    Œ∏  >  0      Œ∏  0    \theta>0   , the Poissonized Plancherel measure with parameter   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta    on the set    ùí´  *     superscript  ùí´     \mathcal{P}^{*}   is defined by         Œº  Œ∏    (  Œª  )    =    e   -  Œ∏       Œ∏   |  Œª  |      (   f  Œª   )   2      (    |  Œª  |   !   )   2      ,         subscript  Œº  Œ∏   Œª      superscript  e    Œ∏         superscript  Œ∏    Œª     superscript   superscript  f  Œª   2     superscript      Œª    2       \mu_{\theta}(\lambda)=e^{-\theta}\frac{\theta^{|\lambda|}(f^{\lambda})^{2}}{(|%
 \lambda|!)^{2}},     for all    Œª  ‚àà   ùí´  *       Œª   superscript  ùí´      \lambda\in\mathcal{P}^{*}   . 5  Plancherel growth process  The Plancherel growth process is a random sequence of Young diagrams       Œª   (  1  )    =    (  1  )   ,   Œª   (  2  )    ,   Œª   (  3  )    ,  ‚Ä¶    ,       superscript  Œª  1    1   superscript  Œª  2    superscript  Œª  3   normal-‚Ä¶     \lambda^{(1)}=(1),~{}\lambda^{(2)},~{}\lambda^{(3)},~{}\ldots,   such that each    Œª   (  n  )      superscript  Œª  n    \lambda^{(n)}   is a random Young diagram of order   n   n   n   whose probability distribution is the n th Plancherel measure, and each successive    Œª   (  n  )      superscript  Œª  n    \lambda^{(n)}   is obtained from its predecessor    Œª   (   n  -  1   )      superscript  Œª    n  1     \lambda^{(n-1)}   by the addition of a single box, according to the transition probability      p   (  ŒΩ  ,  Œª  )   =  ‚Ñô   (   Œª   (  n  )    =   Œª   |   Œª   (   n  -  1   )    =  ŒΩ  )   =    f  Œª    n   f  ŒΩ     ,     fragments  p   fragments  normal-(  ŒΩ  normal-,  Œª  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(   superscript  Œª  n    Œª  normal-|   superscript  Œª    n  1     ŒΩ  normal-)       superscript  f  Œª     n   superscript  f  ŒΩ     normal-,    p(\nu,\lambda)=\mathbb{P}(\lambda^{(n)}=\lambda~{}|~{}\lambda^{(n-1)}=\nu)=%
 \frac{f^{\lambda}}{nf^{\nu}},     for any given Young diagrams   ŒΩ   ŒΩ   \nu   and   Œª   Œª   \lambda   of sizes n ‚àí¬†1 and n , respectively. 6  So, the Plancherel growth process can be viewed as a natural coupling of the different Plancherel measures of all the symmetric groups, or alternatively as a random walk on Young's lattice . It is not difficult to show that the probability distribution of    Œª   (  n  )      superscript  Œª  n    \lambda^{(n)}   in this walk coincides with the Plancherel measure on    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   . 7  Compact groups  The Plancherel measure for compact groups is similar to that for finite groups, except that the measure need not be finite. The unitary dual is a discrete set of finite-dimensional representations, and the Plancherel measure of an irreducible finite-dimensional representation is proportional to its dimension.  Abelian groups  The unitary dual of a locally compact abelian group is another locally compact abelian group, and the Plancherel measure is proportional to the Haar measure of the dual group.  Semisimple Lie groups  The Plancherel measure for semisimple Lie groups was found by Harish-Chandra . The support is the set of tempered representations , and in particular not all unitary representations need occur in the support.
