   Generalized symmetric group      Generalized symmetric group   In mathematics , the generalized symmetric group is the wreath product      S   (  m  ,  n  )    :=    Z  m   ≀   S  n       assign    S   m  n     normal-≀   subscript  Z  m    subscript  S  n      S(m,n):=Z_{m}\wr S_{n}   of the cyclic group of order m and the symmetric group on n letters.  Examples   For     m  =  1   ,      m  1    m=1,   the generalized symmetric group is exactly the ordinary symmetric group      S   (  1  ,  n  )    =   S  n    .        S   1  n     subscript  S  n     S(1,n)=S_{n}.     For     m  =  2   ,      m  2    m=2,   one can consider the cyclic group of order 2 as positives and negatives (     Z  2   ≅   {   ±  1   }        subscript  Z  2     plus-or-minus  1      Z_{2}\cong\{\pm 1\}   ) and identify the generalized symmetric group    S   (  2  ,  n  )       S   2  n     S(2,n)   with the signed symmetric group .   Representation theory  There is a natural representation of    S   (  m  ,  n  )       S   m  n     S(m,n)   as generalized permutation matrices , where the nonzero entries are m th roots of unity       Z  m   ≅   μ  m    .       subscript  Z  m    subscript  μ  m     Z_{m}\cong\mu_{m}.     The representation theory has been studied since ; see references in . As with the symmetric group, the representations can be constructed in terms of Specht modules ; see .  Homology  The first group homology group (concretely, the abelianization ) is     Z  m   ×   Z  2        subscript  Z  m    subscript  Z  2     Z_{m}\times Z_{2}   (for m odd this is isomorphic to    Z   2  m      subscript  Z    2  m     Z_{2m}   ): the    Z  m     subscript  Z  m    Z_{m}   factors (which are all conjugate, hence must map identically in an abelian group, since conjugation is trivial in an abelian group) can be mapped to    Z  m     subscript  Z  m    Z_{m}   (concretely, by taking the product of all the    Z  m     subscript  Z  m    Z_{m}   values), while the sign map on the symmetric group yields the     Z  2   .     subscript  Z  2    Z_{2}.   These are independent, and generate the group, hence are the abelianization.  The second homology group (in classical terms, the Schur multiplier ) is given by :        H  2    (   S   (    2  k   +  1   ,  n  )    )    =   {     1     n  <  4        𝐙  /  2      n  ≥  4.              subscript  H  2     S       2  k   1   n      cases  1    n  4     𝐙  2     n  4.      H_{2}(S(2k+1,n))=\begin{cases}1&n<4\\
 \mathbf{Z}/2&n\geq 4.\end{cases}           H  2    (   S   (    2  k   +  2   ,  n  )    )    =   {     1     n  =   0  ,  1         𝐙  /  2      n  =  2         (   𝐙  /  2   )   2      n  =  3         (   𝐙  /  2   )   3      n  ≥  4.              subscript  H  2     S       2  k   2   n      cases  1    n   0  1      𝐙  2     n  2    superscript    𝐙  2   2     n  3    superscript    𝐙  2   3     n  4.      H_{2}(S(2k+2,n))=\begin{cases}1&n=0,1\\
 \mathbf{Z}/2&n=2\\
 (\mathbf{Z}/2)^{2}&n=3\\
 (\mathbf{Z}/2)^{3}&n\geq 4.\end{cases}   Note that it depends on n and the parity of m:       H  2    (   S   (    2  k   +  1   ,  n  )    )    ≈    H  2    (   S   (  1  ,  n  )    )           subscript  H  2     S       2  k   1   n        subscript  H  2     S   1  n       H_{2}(S(2k+1,n))\approx H_{2}(S(1,n))   and       H  2    (   S   (    2  k   +  2   ,  n  )    )    ≈    H  2    (   S   (  2  ,  n  )    )     ,         subscript  H  2     S       2  k   2   n        subscript  H  2     S   2  n       H_{2}(S(2k+2,n))\approx H_{2}(S(2,n)),   which are the Schur multipliers of the symmetric group and signed symmetric group.
