Generalized symmetric group

In mathematics, the generalized symmetric group is the wreath product

 
  of the cyclic group of order m and the symmetric group on n letters.
Examples

For 
 
 
 
  the generalized symmetric group is exactly the ordinary symmetric group
 
 

For 
 
 
 
 
  one can consider the cyclic group of order 2 as positives and negatives (
 
 
 
 ) and identify the generalized symmetric group 
 
 
 
  with the signed symmetric group.

Representation theory
There is a natural representation of 
 
 
 
  as generalized permutation matrices, where the nonzero entries are mth roots of unity


The representation theory has been studied since ; see references in . As with the symmetric group, the representations can be constructed in terms of Specht modules; see .
Homology
The first group homology group (concretely, the abelianization) is 
 
 
 
 
  (for m odd this is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 ): the 
 
 
 
  factors (which are all conjugate, hence must map identically in an abelian group, since conjugation is trivial in an abelian group) can be mapped to 
 
 
 
  (concretely, by taking the product of all the 
 
 
 
  values), while the sign map on the symmetric group yields the 
 
 
 
 
  These are independent, and generate the group, hence are the abelianization.
The second homology group (in classical terms, the Schur multiplier) is given by :





 
  Note that it depends on n and the parity of m:

 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  which are the Schur multipliers of the symmetric group and signed symmetric group.
