   Homoaconitate hydratase      Homoaconitate hydratase   In enzymology , a homoaconitate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (Z)-but-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate , and two products , (Z)-but-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase [(Z)-but-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate-forming] . Other names in common use include homoaconitase , cis-homoaconitase , HACN , Lys4 , LysF , and 2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase (incorrect) . This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
