   Kirillov model      Kirillov model   In mathematics , the Kirillov model , studied by , is a realization of a representation of GL 2 over a local field on a space of functions on the local field.  If G is the algebraic group  GL 2 and F is a non-Archimedean local field, and τ is a fixed nontrivial character of the additive group of F and π is an irreducible representation of G ( F ), then the Kirillov model for π is a representation π on a space of locally constant functions f on F * with compact support in F such that        π   (   (      a  b       01     )   )   f   (  x  )    =   τ   (   b  x   )   f   (   a  x   )     .        π   binomial    a  b   01   f  x     τ    b  x   f    a  x      \pi({ab\choose 01})f(x)=\tau(bx)f(ax).   showed that an irreducible representation of dimension greater than 1 has an essentially unique Kirillov model. Over a local field, the space of functions with compact support in F ' * has codimension 0, 1, or 2 in the Kirillov model, depending on whether the irreducible representation is cuspidal, special, or principal.  The Whittaker model can be constructed from the Kirillov model, by defining the image W ξ of a vector ξ of the Kirillov model by   W ξ ( g ) = π(g)ξ(1)   where π( g ) is the image of g in the Kirillov model.  defined the Kirillov model for the general linear group GL n using the mirabolic subgroup . More precisely, a Kirillov model for a representation of the general linear group is an embedding of it in the representation of the mirabolic group induced from a non-degenerate character of the group of upper triangular matrices.
