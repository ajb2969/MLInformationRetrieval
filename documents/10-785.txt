Isoliquiritigenin 2'-O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, an isoliquiritigenin 2'-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + isoliquiritigenin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylisoliquiritigenin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and isoliquiritigenin, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 2'-O-methylisoliquiritigenin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:isoliquiritigenin 2'-O-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include chalcone OMT, and CHMT.
