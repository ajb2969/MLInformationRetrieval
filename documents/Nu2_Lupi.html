<h1>Nu2 Lupi</h1>
<hr/>

<p><mtpl></mtpl> </p>

<p><strong>Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi</strong> (<strong>ν<sup>2</sup> Lup</strong>) is a 6th <a href="apparent_magnitude" title="wikilink">magnitude</a> <a href="G-type_main-sequence_star" title="wikilink">G-type main-sequence star</a> located approximately 48 <a href="light-year" title="wikilink">light-years</a> away in the <a class="uri" href="constellation" title="wikilink">constellation</a> of <a href="Lupus_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Lupus</a>. The physical properties of the star are similar to those of the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>, though Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi is significantly older.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi is a bright star, barely observable with the naked eye in good observing conditions, that lies towards the bottom Lupus near to the border with <a href="Norma_(constellation)" title="wikilink">Norma</a> and close to the galactic plane.</p>

<p>At over 1.6 arcseconds per year, Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi has a particularly large proper motion. This indicates that the star is nearby, which was confirmed by Earth-based parallax measurements during the last century such as that of the <a href="Gliese_Catalogue_of_Nearby_Stars" title="wikilink">Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars</a>, measuring 63.1 ± 7.8 milli-arcseconds. The much more accurate space-based Hipparcos parallax of 67.51 ± 0.39 milli-arcseconds gives a distance of 48.3 ± 0.3 <a href="light-year" title="wikilink">light-years</a>, making Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi one of the closest G-type main-sequence stars to the Sun.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi also has a large radial velocity of 68.7 km/s. When combined with its large proper motion, it becomes apparent that the star is moving much faster through the galaxy than the Sun. This indicates that it the star is a member of an older, higher-motion stellar population, which is confirmed by the star's position on the Toomre diagram with Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi showing kinematics of a <a href="thick_disk" title="wikilink">thick disk</a> star.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This means that Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi must be considerably older than the Sun, which is supported by its spectroscopic parameters: the depth of the star's iron spectral lines implies an iron abundance of -0.34 ± 0.01 dex, equalling 46 ± 1% of the solar iron abundance - a typical value for a thick disk star. Similarly, the star's surface gravity of log 4.39 ± 0.02 g is somewhat lower than is typical for a main-sequence G-type star and indicates modest evolution, which when combined with a spectroscopically derived mass of  implies an age of 10.36 ± 2.30 billion years, over twice the solar age. Nu<sup>2</sup> Lupi is therefore probably one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood.</p>
<h2 id="planetary-system">Planetary system</h2>

<p>On September 12, 2011 three low-mass planets were announced using data from the <a href="High_Accuracy_Radial_Velocity_Planet_Searcher" title="wikilink">HARPS</a> spectrograph.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> These three planets are among about seven dozen planets discovered in September 2011, the most of any month during the exoplanet era that begun in early 1990s.</p>

<p>With a minimum mass of about 5 Earth masses, the innermost planet falls into the regime of <a href="Super-Earth" title="wikilink">Super-Earths</a>. The two outer planets straddle the commonly accepted upper limit between Super-Earths and Neptunes at , so they could be either predominantly rocky or gaseous. All three planets orbit within 0.5 AU and are likely too hot to maintain liquid water.</p>

<p>The most recent published observation of this system for debris disks was in 2006 by the Spitzer telescope, searching for an excess of infra-red light that would indicate scattering of starlight by dust or planetesimals; no infra-red excess was detected.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
