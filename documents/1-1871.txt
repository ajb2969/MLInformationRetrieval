   Abscissa      Abscissa   In mathematics , an abscissa (; plural abscissae or abscissæ or abscissas ) is the perpendicular distance of a point from the vertical axis. Usually this is the horizontal coordinate of a point in a two-dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinate system . The term can also refer to the horizontal axis (typically x -axis) of a two-dimensional graph (because that axis is used to define and measure the horizontal coordinates of points in the space). An ordered pair consists of two terms—the abscissa (horizontal, usually x ) and the ordinate (vertical, usually y )—which define the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space.

Examples   For the point (2, 3), 2 is called the abscissa and 3 the ordinate .  For the point (-1.5, -2.5), −1.5 is called the abscissa and −2.5 the ordinate.
