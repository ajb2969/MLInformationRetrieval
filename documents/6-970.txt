   D-term      D-term   In theoretical physics , one often analyzes theories with supersymmetry in which D-terms play an important role. In four dimensions, the minimal N=1 supersymmetry may be written using a superspace . This superspace involves four extra fermionic coordinates     θ  1   ,   θ  2   ,    θ  ¯   1   ,    θ  ¯   2       superscript  θ  1    superscript  θ  2    superscript   normal-¯  θ   1    superscript   normal-¯  θ   2     \theta^{1},\theta^{2},\bar{\theta}^{1},\bar{\theta}^{2}   , transforming as a two-component spinor and its conjugate.  Every superfield, i.e. a field that depends on all coordinates of the superspace, may be expanded with respect to the new fermionic coordinates. The generic kind of superfields, typically a vector superfield , indeed depend on all these coordinates. The last term in the corresponding expansion, namely    D   θ  1    θ  2     θ  ¯   1     θ  ¯   2       D   superscript  θ  1    superscript  θ  2    superscript   normal-¯  θ   1    superscript   normal-¯  θ   2     D\theta^{1}\theta^{2}\bar{\theta}^{1}\bar{\theta}^{2}   , is called the D-term.  Manifestly supersymmetric Lagrangians may also be written as integrals over the whole superspace. Some special terms, such as the superpotential , may be written as integrals over   θ   θ   \theta   s only, which are known as F-terms , and should be contrasted with the present D-terms.
