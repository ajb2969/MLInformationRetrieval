   Velocity obstacle      Velocity obstacle   In robotics and motion planning , a velocity obstacle , commonly abbreviated VO , is the set of all velocities of a robot that will result in a collision with another robot at some moment in time, assuming that the other robot maintains its current velocity. 1 If the robot chooses a velocity inside the velocity obstacle then the two robots will eventually collide, if it chooses a velocity outside the velocity obstacle, such a collision is guaranteed not to occur. 2  This algorithm for robot collision avoidance has been repeatedly rediscovered and published under different names: in 1989 as a maneuvering-board approach, 3 in 1993 it was first introduced as the "velocity obstacle", 4 in 1998 as collision cones, 5 and in 2009 as forbidden velocity maps. 6 The same algorithm has been used in maritime port navigation since at least 1903. 7  The velocity obstacle for a robot   A   A   A   induced by a robot   B   B   B   may be formally written as       V   O   A  |  B     =   {    𝐯    |   ∃  t   >   0   :     (   𝐯  -   𝐯  B    )   t   ∈   D   (    𝐱  B   -   𝐱  A    ,    r  A   +   r  B    )     }         V   subscript  O   fragments  A  normal-|  B      conditional-set    𝐯   ket    t    0         𝐯   subscript  𝐯  B    t     D      subscript  𝐱  B    subscript  𝐱  A       subscript  r  A    subscript  r  B          VO_{A|B}=\{\mathbf{v}\,|\,\exists t>0:(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{B})t\in D(%
 \mathbf{x}_{B}-\mathbf{x}_{A},r_{A}+r_{B})\}     where   A   A   A   has position     𝐱  A     subscript  𝐱  A    \mathbf{x}_{A}   and radius     r  A     subscript  r  A    r_{A}   , and   B   B   B   has position    𝐱  B     subscript  𝐱  B    \mathbf{x}_{B}   , radius    r  B     subscript  r  B    r_{B}   , and velocity    𝐯  B     subscript  𝐯  B    \mathbf{v}_{B}   . The notation    D   (  𝐱  ,  r  )       D   𝐱  r     D(\mathbf{x},r)   represents a disc with center    𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   and radius   r   r   r   .  Variations include common velocity obstacles (CVO), 8 finite-time-interval velocity obstacles (FVO), 9  generalized velocity obstacles (GVO), 10  hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacles (HRVO), 11  nonlinear velocity obstacles (NLVO), 12 reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO), 13 and recursive  probabilistic velocity obstacles (PVO). 14  References  "  Category:Geometric algorithms  Category:Multi-robot systems  Category:Robot kinematics     ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
