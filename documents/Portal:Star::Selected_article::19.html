) is a standard <a href="units_of_mass" title="wikilink">unit of mass</a> in <a class="uri" href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, used to indicate the masses of other <a href="star" title="wikilink">stars</a>, as well as <a href="Star_cluster" title="wikilink">clusters</a>, <a href="nebula" title="wikilink">nebulae</a> and <a href="galaxy" title="wikilink">galaxies</a>. It is equal to the mass of the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a>, about two <a href="Names_of_large_numbers" title="wikilink">nonillion</a> <a href="kilogram" title="wikilink">kilograms</a>. This is about 332,950 times the mass of the <a class="uri" href="Earth" title="wikilink">Earth</a> or 1,048 times the mass of <a class="uri" href="Jupiter" title="wikilink">Jupiter</a>. Because the Earth follows an <a href="elliptical_orbit" title="wikilink">elliptical orbit</a> around the Sun, the solar mass can be computed from the equation for the <a href="orbital_period" title="wikilink">orbital period</a> of a small body orbiting a central mass. Based upon the length of the year, the distance from the Earth to the Sun (an <a href="astronomical_unit" title="wikilink">astronomical unit</a> or AU), and the <a href="gravitational_constant" title="wikilink">gravitational constant</a> (<em>G</em>).</p>

<p>The value of the gravitational constant was derived from 1798 measurements by <a href="Henry_Cavendish" title="wikilink">Henry Cavendish</a> using a <a href="torsion_balance" title="wikilink">torsion balance</a>. The value obtained differed only by about 1% from the modern value.The <a href="parallax#Diurnal_parallax" title="wikilink">diurnal parallax</a> of the <a class="uri" href="Sun" title="wikilink">Sun</a> was accurately measured during the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, yielding a value of 9″ (compared to the present 1976 value of 8.794148″), yielding a value of 9″ (compared to the present 1976 value of 8.794148″). When the value of the diurnal parallax is known, the distance to the Sun can be determined from the geometry of the Earth. The first person to estimate the mass of the Sun was <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a>. In his work <em><a class="uri" href="Principia" title="wikilink">Principia</a></em>, he estimated that the ratio of the mass of the Earth to the Sun was about 1/28,700. Later he determined that this value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax, which was used to estimate the distance to the Sun (1 AU). He revised his result to obtain a ratio of 1/169,282 in the third edition of the <em>Principia</em>. The current value for the solar parallax is smaller still, giving a mass ratio of 1/332,946.</p>

<p>As a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the gravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the determination of the relative mass of another planet in the <a href="Solar_System" title="wikilink">Solar System</a> or of a <a href="Binary_star#Use_in_astrophysics" title="wikilink">binary star</a> in units of solar masses does not depend on these poorly known constants. So it was useful to express these masses in units of solar masses (see <a href="Gaussian_gravitational_constant" title="wikilink">Gaussian gravitational constant</a>).</p>

<p>The mass of the Sun changes slowly, compared to the lifetime of the Sun. Mass is lost due to two main processes in nearly equal amounts. First, in the <a href="Solar_core" title="wikilink">Sun's core</a> hydrogen is converted into helium by <a href="nuclear_fusion" title="wikilink">nuclear fusion</a>, in particular the <a href="Proton–proton_chain_reaction" title="wikilink">pp chain</a>. Thereby mass is converted to energy in correspondence to the <a href="mass–energy_equivalence" title="wikilink">mass–energy equivalence</a>. This energy is eventually <a href="Solar_luminosity" title="wikilink">radiated away</a> by the Sun. The second process is the <a href="solar_wind" title="wikilink">solar wind</a>, which is the ejection of mainly protons and electrons to outer space. The actual net mass of the Sun since it reached the <a href="main_sequence" title="wikilink">main sequence</a> remains uncertain. The early Sun had much higher mass loss rates than at present, so, realistically, it may have lost anywhere from 1–7% of its total mass over the course of its main sequence lifetime.</p>
