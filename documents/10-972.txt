   Beta-cyclopiazonate dehydrogenase      Beta-cyclopiazonate dehydrogenase   Beta-cyclopiazonate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   beta-cyclopiazonate + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-cyclopiazonate + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are beta-cyclopiazonate and an acceptor , whereas its two products are alpha-cyclopiazonate and a reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is beta-cyclopiazonate:acceptor oxidoreductase (cyclizing) . Other names in common use include beta-cyclopiazonate oxidocyclase , beta-cyclopiazonic oxidocyclase , and beta-cyclopiazonate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase (cyclizing) . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
