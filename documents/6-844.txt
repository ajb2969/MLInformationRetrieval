Padovan polynomials

In mathematics, Padovan polynomials are a generalization of Padovan sequence numbers. These polynomials are defined by:



The first few Padovan polynomials are:

































The Padovan numbers are recovered by evaluating the polynomials Pn-3(x) at x = 1.
Evaluating Pn-3(x) at x = 2 gives the nth Fibonacci number plus (-1)n. 
The ordinary generating function for the sequence is
