   Bring's curve      Bring's curve   In mathematics, Bring's curve is the curve given by the equations       v  +  w  +  x  +  y  +  z   =    v  2   +   w  2   +   x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    =    v  3   +   w  3   +   x  3   +   y  3   +   z  3    =  0.          v  w  x  y  z      superscript  v  2    superscript  w  2    superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2            superscript  v  3    superscript  w  3    superscript  x  3    superscript  y  3    superscript  z  3         0.     v+w+x+y+z=v^{2}+w^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=v^{3}+w^{3}+x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}=0.   It was named by  after Erland Samuel Bring who studied a similar construction in 1786 in Promotionschrift submitted to the University of Lund.  References       "  Category:Algebraic curves
