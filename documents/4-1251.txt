   Whitehead theorem      Whitehead theorem   In homotopy theory (a branch of mathematics ), the Whitehead theorem states that if a continuous mapping  f between topological spaces  X and Y induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups , then f is a homotopy equivalence provided X and Y are connected and have the homotopy-type of CW complexes . This result was proved by J. H. C. Whitehead in two landmark papers from 1949, and provides a justification for working with the CW complex concept that he introduced there.  Statement  More accurately, we suppose given CW complexes X and Y , with respective base points x and y . Given a continuous mapping      f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y     such that f ( x ) = y , we consider for n ≥ 1 the induced homomorphisms        f  *   :     π  n    (  X  ,  x  )    →    π  n    (  Y  ,  y  )      ,     normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript  π  n    X  x       subscript  π  n    Y  y       f_{*}\colon\pi_{n}(X,x)\to\pi_{n}(Y,y),     where π n denotes for n ≥ 1 the n -th homotopy group. For n = 0 this means the mapping of the path-connected components; if we assume both X and Y are connected we can ignore this as containing no information. We say that f is a weak homotopy equivalence if the homomorphisms f * are all isomorphisms. The Whitehead theorem then states that a weak homotopy equivalence, for connected CW complexes, is a homotopy equivalence .  Spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups may not be homotopy equivalent  A word of caution: it is not enough to assume π n ( X ) is isomorphic to π n ( Y ) for each n ≥ 1 in order to conclude that X and Y are homotopy equivalent. One really needs a map f : X → Y inducing such isomorphisms in homotopy. For instance, take X = S 2 × RP 3 and Y = RP 2 × S 3 . Then X and Y have the same fundamental group, namely Z 2 , and the same universal cover, namely S 2 × S 3 ; thus, they have isomorphic homotopy groups. On the other hand their homology groups are different (as can be seen from the Künneth formula ); thus, X and Y are not homotopy equivalent.  The Whitehead theorem does not hold for general topological spaces or even for all subspaces of R n . For example, the Warsaw circle , a subset of the plane, has all homotopy groups zero, but the map from the Warsaw circle to a single point is not a homotopy equivalence. The study of possible generalizations of Whitehead's theorem to more general spaces is part of the subject of shape theory .  Generalization to model categories  In any model category , a weak equivalence between cofibrant-fibrant objects is a homotopy equivalence.  References   J. H. C. Whitehead, Combinatorial homotopy.
