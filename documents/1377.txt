   Arachidonate 8-lipoxygenase      Arachidonate 8-lipoxygenase   Arachidonate 8-lipoxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   arachidonate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (5Z,9E,11Z,14Z)-(8R)-8-hydroperoxyicosa-5,9,11,14-tetraenoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arachidonate and oxygen , whereas its product is (5Z,9E,11Z,14Z)-(8R)-8-hydroperoxyicosa-5,9,11,14-tetraenoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is arachidonate:oxygen 8-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 8-lipoxygenase , and 8(R)-lipoxygenase . This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
