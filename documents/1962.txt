   Luminosity distance      Luminosity distance   Luminosity distance  D L is defined in terms of the relationship between the absolute magnitude  M and apparent magnitude  m of an astronomical object.      M  =   m  -   5   (     log  10    D  L    -  1   )         M    m    5      subscript   10    subscript  D  L    1       M=m-5(\log_{10}{D_{L}}-1)\!\,     which gives:       D  L   =   10     (   m  -  M   )   5   +  1         subscript  D  L    superscript  10        m  M   5   1      D_{L}=10^{\frac{(m-M)}{5}+1}     where D L is measured in parsecs . For nearby objects (say, in the Milky Way ) the luminosity distance gives a good approximation to the natural notion of distance in Euclidean space .  The relation is less clear for distant objects like quasars far beyond the Milky Way since the apparent magnitude is affected by spacetime  curvature , redshift , and time dilation . Calculating the relation between the apparent and actual luminosity of an object requires taking all of these factors into account. The object's actual luminosity is determined using the inverse-square law and the proportions of the object's apparent distance and luminosity distance.  Another way to express the luminosity distance is through the flux-luminosity relationship. Since,      F  =   L   4  π   D  L  2         F    L    4  π   superscript   subscript  D  L   2       F=\frac{L}{4\pi D_{L}^{2}}     where F is flux (W·cm −2 ), and L is luminosity (W), or where F is flux (erg·s −1 ·cm −2 ), and L is luminosity (erg·s −1 ). From this the luminosity distance can be expressed as:       D  L   =    L   4  π  F          subscript  D  L       L    4  π  F       D_{L}=\sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}}     The luminosity distance is related to the "comoving transverse distance"    D  M     subscript  D  M    D_{M}   by the Etherington's reciprocity relation:       D  L   =    (   1  +  z   )    D  M         subscript  D  L       1  z    subscript  D  M      D_{L}=(1+z)D_{M}     where z is the redshift .    D  M     subscript  D  M    D_{M}   is a factor that allows you to calculate the comoving distance between two objects with the same redshift but at different positions of the sky; if the two objects are separated by an angle    δ  θ      δ  θ    \delta\theta   , the comoving distance between them would be     D  M   δ  θ       subscript  D  M   δ  θ    D_{M}\delta\theta   . In a spatially flat universe, the comoving transverse distance    D  M     subscript  D  M    D_{M}   is exactly equal to the radial comoving distance    D  C     subscript  D  C    D_{C}   , i.e. the comoving distance from ourselves to the object. 1  See also   Distance measures (cosmology)  distance modulus   Notes  External links   Ned Wright's Javascript Cosmology Calculator  iCosmos: Cosmology Calculator (With Graph Generation )   "  Category:Observational astronomy  Category:Physical quantities     ↩
