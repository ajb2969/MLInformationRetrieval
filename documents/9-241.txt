   Digital signature forgery      Digital signature forgery   In a cryptographic  digital signature or MAC system, digital signature forgery is the ability to create a pair consisting of a message   m   m   m   and a signature (or MAC)   σ   σ   \sigma   that is valid for   m   m   m   , where   m   m   m   has not been signed in the past by the legitimate signer. There are three types of forgery: existential, selective, and universal. 1  Types  Besides the following attacks, there is also a total break : when adversary can compute the signer's private key and therefore forge any possible signature on any message 2  Existential forgery  Existential forgery is the creation (by an adversary) of at least one message/signature pair    (  m  ,  σ  )     m  σ    (m,\sigma)   , where   σ   σ   \sigma   was not produced by the legitimate signer. The adversary need not have any control over   m   m   m   ;   m   m   m   need not have any particular meaning; and indeed it may even be gibberish — as long as the pair    (  m  ,  σ  )     m  σ    (m,\sigma)   is valid, the adversary has succeeded in constructing an existential forgery.  Existential forgery is essentially the weakest adversarial goal, therefore the strongest schemes are those that are "existentially unforgeable". Nevertheless, many state-of-art signature algorithms allow existential forgery. For example, an RSA forgery can be done as follows:   Let   e   e   e   be the RSA public key.  Choose a random signature    S  i  g      S  i  g    Sig   .  Send the message as    S  i   g  e    (  m  o  d  n  )   |  |  S  i  g   (  m  o  d  n  )      fragments  S  i   superscript  g  e    fragments  normal-(  m  o  d  n  normal-)   normal-|  normal-|  S  i  g   fragments  normal-(  m  o  d  n  normal-)     Sig^{e}(modn)||Sig(modn)   .  The recipient check the signature    S  i   g  e   =  =  S  i   g  e      fragments  S  i   superscript  g  e     S  i   superscript  g  e     Sig^{e}==Sig^{e}   so the check will pass.   Note: the sender cannot control the message content so it will be a random message, that may help in some cases.  Multiplication forgery  This forgery can be used with two messages with their signatures as follows:   Let     x  1   =    S  k    (   y  1   )         subscript  x  1      subscript  S  k    subscript  y  1      x_{1}=S_{k}(y_{1})   be RSA signature on the message    y  1     subscript  y  1    y_{1}   under the key   k   k   k   .  Analogously,     x  2   =    S  k    (   y  2   )         subscript  x  2      subscript  S  k    subscript  y  2      x_{2}=S_{k}(y_{2})   .  in that case      x  1   ⋅   x  2       (   mod  n   )      annotated   normal-⋅   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     pmod  n     x_{1}\cdot x_{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)   will be valid RSA signature on the message      y  1   ⋅   y  2       (   mod  n   )      annotated   normal-⋅   subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2     pmod  n     y_{1}\cdot y_{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)   under the key   k   k   k   . 3   Selective forgery  Selective forgery is the creation (by an adversary) of a message/signature pair    (  m  ,  σ  )     m  σ    (m,\sigma)   where   m   m   m   has been chosen by the adversary prior to the attack.   m   m   m   may be chosen to have interesting mathematical properties with respect to the signature algorithm; however, in selective forgery,   m   m   m   must be fixed before the start of the attack.  The ability to successfully conduct a selective forgery attack implies the ability to successfully conduct an existential forgery attack.  Universal forgery  Universal forgery is the creation (by an adversary) of a valid signature   σ   σ   \sigma   for any given message   m   m   m   . An adversary capable of universal forgery is able to sign messages he chose himself (as in selective forgery), messages chosen at random, or even specific messages provided by an opponent.
