In mathematical optimization, a problem is defined using an objective function to minimize or maximize, and a set of constraints



that define the feasible region, that is, the set of all x to search for the optimal solution. Given a point 
 
 
 
  in the feasible region, a constraint


 
  is called active at 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and inactive at 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  Equality constraints are always active. The active set at 
 
 
 
  is made up of those constraints 
 
 
 
  that are active at the current point .
The active set is particularly important in optimization theory as it determines which constraints will influence the final result of optimization. For example, in solving the linear programming problem, the active set gives the hyperplanes that intersect at the solution point. In quadratic programming, as the solution is not necessarily on one of the edges of the bounding polygon, an estimation of the active set gives us a subset of inequalities to watch while searching the solution, which reduces the complexity of the search.
Active set methods
In general an active set algorithm has the following structure:

Find a feasible starting point
 
repeat until "optimal enough"
 
solve the equality problem defined by the active set (approximately)
 
compute the Lagrange multipliers of the active set
 
remove a subset of the constraints with negative Lagrange multipliers
 
search for infeasible constraints
 


end repeat


Methods that can be described as active set methods include:

Successive linear programming (SLP)
Sequential quadratic programming (SQP)
Sequential linear-quadratic programming (SLQP)
Reduced gradient method (RG)
Generalized reduced gradient method (GRG)
