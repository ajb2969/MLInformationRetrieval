3-hydroxybenzoate—CoA ligase

3-hydroxybenzoate—CoA ligase (, 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA synthetase, 3-hydroxybenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (AMP-forming), 3-hydroxybenzoyl coenzyme A synthetase, 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA ligase) is an enzyme with system name 3-hydroxybenzoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + 3-hydroxybenzoate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
 

The enzyme works equally well with 4-hydroxybenzoate.
