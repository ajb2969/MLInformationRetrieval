   Calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase      Calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a calmodulin-lysine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + calmodulin L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + calmodulin N 6 -methyl-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and calmodulin L-lysine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and calmodulin N6-methyl-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:calmodulin-L-lysine N6-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include S-adenosylmethionine:calmodulin (lysine) N-methyltransferase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:calmodulin-L-lysine 6-N-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
