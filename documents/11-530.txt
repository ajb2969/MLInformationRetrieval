   Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase      Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylglycerophosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphatidylglycerophosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphatidylglycerol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphatidylglycerophosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are phosphatidylglycerol and phosphate . 1  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphatidylglycerophosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include phosphatidylglycerol phosphate phosphatase , phosphatidylglycerol phosphatase , and PGP phosphatase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .  This is a family of proteins that acts as a mitochondrial phosphatase in cardiolipin biosynthesis. Cardiolipin is a unique dimeric phosphoglycerolipid predominantly present in mitochondrial membranes. The inverted phosphatase motif includes the highly conserved DKD triad. 2  References  "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩  ↩
