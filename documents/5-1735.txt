Havriliak–Negami relaxation

Havriliak–Negami relaxation is an empirical modification of the Debye relaxation model, accounting for the asymmetry and broadness of the dielectric dispersion curve. The model was first used to describe the dielectric relaxation of some polymers,1 by adding two exponential parameters to the Debye equation:



where 
 
 
 
  is the permittivity at the high frequency limit, 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the static, low frequency permittivity, and 
 
 
 
  is the characteristic relaxation time of the medium. The exponents 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  describe the asymmetry and broadness of the corresponding spectra.
Depending on application, the Fourier transform of the stretched exponential function can be a viable alternative that has one parameter less.
For 
 
 
 
  the Havriliak–Negami equation reduces to the Cole–Cole equation, for 
 
 
 
  to the Cole–Davidson equation.
Mathematical properties
Real and imaginary parts
The storage part 
 
 
 
  and the loss part 
 
 
 
  of the permittivity (here
 
 
 
 ) can be calculated as

Loss peak
The maximum of the loss part lies at



Superposition of Lorentzians
The Havriliak–Negami relaxation can be expressed as a superposition of individual Debye relaxations



with the distribution function



where



if the argument of the arctangent is positive, else2



Logarithmic moments
The first logarithmic moment of this distribution, the average logarithmic relaxation time is



where 
 
 
 
  is the digamma function and 
 
 
 
  the Euler constant.3
Inverse Fourier transform
The inverse Fourier transform of the Havriliak-Negami function (the corresponding time-domain relaxation function) can be numerically calculated.4 It can be shown that the series expansions involved are special cases of the Fox-Wright function.5 In particular, in the time-domain the corresponding of 
 
 
 
  can be represented as



where 
 
 
 
  is the Dirac delta function and


 
  is a special instance of the Fox-Wright function and, precisely, it is the three parameters Mittag-Leffler function6 also known as the Prabhakar function. The function 
 
 
 
  can be numerically evaluated, for instance, by means of a Matlab code .7
