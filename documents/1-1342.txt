   Radiation mode      Radiation mode   For an optical fiber or waveguide , a radiation mode or unbound mode is a mode which is not confined by the fiber core. Such a mode has fields that are transversely oscillatory everywhere external to the waveguide, and exists even at the limit of zero wavelength .  Specifically, a radiation mode is one for which      β  =      n  2    (  a  )    k  2    -    (   l  /  a   )   2         β         superscript  n  2   a   superscript  k  2     superscript    l  a   2       \beta=\sqrt{n^{2}(a)k^{2}-(l/a)^{2}}   where β is the imaginary part of the axial propagation constant , integer l is the azimuthal index of the mode, n ( r ) is the refractive index at radius r , a is the core radius, and k is the free-space wave number, k = 2π/ λ , where λ is the wavelength. Radiation modes correspond to refracted rays in the terminology of geometric optics .  See also   Guided ray  Numerical aperture   References     "  Category:Fiber optics
