   Stone–Weierstrass theorem      Stone–Weierstrass theorem   In mathematical analysis , the Weierstrass approximation theorem states that every continuous function defined on a closed interval  $a a , b$ can be uniformly approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial function. Because polynomials are among the simplest functions, and because computers can directly evaluate polynomials, this theorem has both practical and theoretical relevance, especially in polynomial interpolation . The original version of this result was established by Karl Weierstrass in 1885 using the Weierstrass transform .  Marshall H. Stone considerably generalized the theorem  and simplified the proof . His result is known as the Stone–Weierstrass theorem . The Stone–Weierstrass theorem generalizes the Weierstrass approximation theorem in two directions: instead of the real interval $a a , b$ , an arbitrary compact  Hausdorff space  $X$ is considered, and instead of the algebra of polynomial functions, approximation with elements from more general subalgebras of $C( X )$ is investigated. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem is a vital result in the study of the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space .  Further, there is a generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem to noncompact Tychonoff spaces , namely, any continuous function on a Tychonoff space is approximated uniformly on compact sets by algebras of the type appearing in the Stone–Weierstrass theorem and described below.  A different generalization of Weierstrass' original theorem is Mergelyan's theorem , which generalizes it to functions defined on certain subsets of the complex plane .  Weierstrass approximation theorem  The statement of the approximation theorem as originally discovered by Weierstrass is as follows:   Weierstrass Approximation Theorem. Suppose $f$ is a continuous real-valued function defined on the real interval $a a , b$ . For every $ε > 0$ , there exists a polynomial $p ( x )$ such that for all $x$ in $a a , b$ , we have $| f ( x ) − p ( x ) | , or equivalently, the supremum norm  ${{!!}} f − p {{!!}} .   A constructive proof of this theorem using Bernstein polynomials is outlined on that page.  Applications  As a consequence of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, one can show that the space $C a a , b$ is separable : the polynomial functions are dense, and each polynomial function can be uniformly approximated by one with rational coefficients; there are only countably many polynomials with rational coefficients. Since $C a a , b$ is Hausdorff and separable it follows that $C a a , b$ has cardinality equal to — the same cardinality as the cardinality of the reals . (Remark: This cardinality result also follows from the fact that a continuous function on the reals is uniquely determined by its restriction to the rationals.)  Stone–Weierstrass theorem, real version  The set $C a a , b$ of continuous real-valued functions on $a a , b$ , together with the supremum norm  f {{!!}} {{=}} sup a ≤ x ≤ b {{!}} f ( x ){{!}}}} , is a Banach algebra , (i.e. an associative algebra and a Banach space such that ${{!!}} fg {{!!}} ≤ {{!!}} f {{!!}} · {{!!}} g {{!!}}$ for all $f , g$ ). The set of all polynomial functions forms a subalgebra of $C a a , b$ (i.e. a vector subspace of $C a a , b$ that is closed under multiplication of functions), and the content of the Weierstrass approximation theorem is that this subalgebra is dense in $C a a , b$ .  Stone starts with an arbitrary compact Hausdorff space $X$ and considers the algebra $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ of real-valued continuous functions on $X$ , with the topology of uniform convergence . He wants to find subalgebras of $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ which are dense. It turns out that the crucial property that a subalgebra must satisfy is that it separates points : a set $A$ of functions defined on $X$ is said to separate points if, for every two different points $x$ and $y$ in $X$ there exists a function $p$ in $A$ with $p ( x ) ≠ p ( y )$ . Now we may state:   Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (real numbers). Suppose $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $A$ is a subalgebra of $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ which contains a non-zero constant function. Then $A$ is dense in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$  if and only if it separates points.   This implies Weierstrass’ original statement since the polynomials on $a a , b$ form a subalgebra of $C a a , b$ which contains the constants and separates points.  Locally compact version  A version of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is also true when $X$ is only locally compact . Let be the space of real-valued continuous functions on $X$ which vanish at infinity ; that is, a continuous function $f$ is in if, for every $ε > 0$ , there exists a compact set $K ⊂ X$ such that $f  on $X \ K$ . Again, is a Banach algebra with the supremum norm . A subalgebra $A$ of is said to vanish nowhere if not all of the elements of $A$ simultaneously vanish at a point; that is, for every $x$ in $X$ , there is some $f$ in $A$ such that $f ( x ) ≠ 0$ . The theorem generalizes as follows:   Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (locally compact spaces). Suppose $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $A$ is a subalgebra of . Then $A$ is dense in (given the topology of uniform convergence ) if and only if it separates points and vanishes nowhere.   This version clearly implies the previous version in the case when $X$ is compact, since in that case C( X , R )}} . There are also more general versions of the Stone–Weierstrass that weaken the assumption of local compactness. 1  Applications  The Stone–Weierstrass theorem can be used to prove the following two statements which go beyond Weierstrass's result.   If $f$ is a continuous real-valued function defined on the set $a a , b × c c , d$ and $ε > 0$ , then there exists a polynomial function $p$ in two variables such that $| f ( x , y ) − p ( x , y ) |  for all $x$ in $a a , b$ and $y$ in $c c , d$ .  If $X$ and $Y$ are two compact Hausdorff spaces and $f : X × Y → \mathbf{ R } $ is a continuous function, then for every $ε > 0$ there exist $n > 0$ and continuous functions on $X$ and continuous functions on $Y$ such that  f − ∑ f i g i {{!!}} .   The theorem has many other applications to analysis, including:   Fourier series : The set of linear combinations of functions  e 2 πinx , n ∈ Z }} is dense in , where we identify the endpoints of the interval $0, 1 1$ to obtain a circle. An important consequence of this is that the are an orthonormal basis of the space of square-integrable functions on $0, 1 1$ .   Stone–Weierstrass theorem, complex version  Slightly more general is the following theorem, where we consider the algebra $C( X , \mathbf{ C } )$ of complex-valued continuous functions on the compact space $X$ , again with the topology of uniform convergence. This is a C*-algebra with the *-operation given by pointwise complex conjugation .   Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (complex numbers). Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and let $S$ be a subset of $C( X , \mathbf{ C } )$ which separates points . Then the complex unital  *-algebra generated by $S$ is dense in $C( X , \mathbf{ C } )$ .   The complex unital *-algebra generated by $S$ consists of all those functions that can be obtained from the elements of $S$ by throwing in the constant function $1$ and adding them, multiplying them, conjugating them, or multiplying them with complex scalars, and repeating finitely many times.  This theorem implies the real version, because if a sequence of complex-valued functions uniformly approximate a given function $f$ , then the real parts of those functions uniformly approximate the real part of $f$ . As in the real case, an analog of this theorem is true for locally compact Hausdorff spaces.  Stone–Weierstrass theorem, quaternion version  Following  : consider the algebra $C( X , \mathbf{ H } )$ of quaternion-valued continuous functions on the compact space $X$ , again with the topology of uniform convergence. If a quaternion q is written in the form q =a+ i b+ j c+ k d then the scalar part a is the real number ( q - iqi - jqj - kqk )/4. Likewise being the scalar part of -qi , -qj and -qk : b,c and d are respectively the real numbers ( -qi - iq + jqk - kqj )/4, ( -qj - iqk - jq + kqi )/4 and ( -qk + iqj - jqk - kq )/4. Then we may state :   Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (quaternion numbers). Suppose $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $A$ is a subalgebra of $C( X , \mathbf{ H } )$ which contains a non-zero constant function. Then $A$ is dense in $C( X , \mathbf{ H } )$  if and only if it separates points.   Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, C*-algebra version  The space of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X i.e. C( X , C ) is the canonical example of a unital commutative C*-algebra  $\mathfrak{A}$ . The space X may be viewed as the space of pure states on $\mathfrak{A}$ , with the weak-* topology. Following the above cue, a non-commutative extension of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, which has remain unsolved, is as follows:   Conjecture. If a unital C*-algebra  $\mathfrak{A}$ has a C*-subalgebra $\mathfrak{B}$ which separates the pure states of $\mathfrak{A}$ , then $\mathfrak{A} = \mathfrak{B}$ .   In 1959, Jim Glimm proved a weaker version of the above conjecture.   Stone-Weierstrass theorem (C*-algebras). 2 If a unital C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ has a C*-subalgebra $\mathfrak{B}$ which separates the pure state space (i.e. the weak-* closure of the pure states) of $\mathfrak{A}$ , then $\mathfrak{A}= \mathfrak{B}$ .   Lattice versions  Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Stone's original proof of the theorem used the idea of lattices in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ . A subset $L$ of $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ is called a lattice if for any two elements $f , g ∈ L$ , the functions also belong to $L$ . The lattice version of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem states:   Stone–Weierstrass Theorem (lattices). Suppose $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and $L$ is a lattice in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ with the property that for any two distinct elements $x$ and $y$ of $X$ and any two real numbers $a$ and $b$ there exists an element $f ∈ L$ with $f ( x ) = a$ and $f ( y ) = b$ . Then $L$ is dense in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ .   The above versions of Stone–Weierstrass can be proven from this version once one realizes that the lattice property can also be formulated using the absolute value  $| f |$ which in turn can be approximated by polynomials in $f$ . A variant of the theorem applies to linear subspaces of $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ closed under max :   Stone–Weierstrass Theorem. Suppose $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $B$ is a family of functions in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ such that  $B$ separates points.  $B$ contains the constant function 1.  If $f ∈ B$ then $af ∈ B$ for all constants $a ∈ \mathbf{ R } $ .  If $f , g ∈ B$ , then .    Then $B$ is dense in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ .   More precise information is available:   Suppose $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space with at least two points and $L$ is a lattice in $C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ . The function $φ ∈ C( X , \mathbf{ R } )$ belongs to the closure of $L$ if and only if for each pair of distinct points x and y in $X$ and for each $ε > 0$ there exists some $f ∈ L$ for which $| f ( x ) − φ ( x ) |  and $| f ( y ) − φ ( y ) | .   Bishop's theorem  Another generalization of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is due to Errett Bishop . Bishop's theorem is as follows :   Let $A$ be a closed subalgebra of the Banach space  $C( X , \mathbf{ C } )$ of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space $X$ . Suppose that $f ∈ C( X , \mathbf{ C } )$ has the following property:  S ∈ A S }} for every maximal set $S ⊂ X$ such that all real functions of are constant.    Then $f ∈ A$ .   gives a short proof of Bishop's theorem using the Krein–Milman theorem in an essential way, as well as the Hahn–Banach theorem : the process of . See also .  See also   Runge's phenomenon shows that finding a polynomial $P$ such that $f ( x ) = P ( x )$ for some finely spaced  x n }} is a bad way to attempt to find a polynomial approximating $f$ uniformly. However, as is shown in Walter Rudin 's Principles of Mathematical Analysis, one can easily find a polynomial $P$ uniformly approximating $f$ by convolving $f$ with a polynomial kernel.
