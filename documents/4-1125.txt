   Almost flat manifold      Almost flat manifold   In mathematics, a smooth compact  manifold  M is called almost flat if for any    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there is a Riemannian metric     g  ε     subscript  g  ε    g_{\varepsilon}   on M such that     diam   (  M  ,   g  ε   )    ≤  1        diam   M   subscript  g  ε     1    \mbox{diam}(M,g_{\varepsilon})\leq 1   and    g  ε     subscript  g  ε    g_{\varepsilon}   is   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -flat, i.e. for the sectional curvature of    K   g  ε      subscript  K   subscript  g  ε     K_{g_{\varepsilon}}   we have     |   K   g  ϵ    |   <  ε         subscript  K   subscript  g  ϵ     ε    |K_{g_{\epsilon}}|<\varepsilon   .  In fact, given n , there is a positive number     ε  n   >  0       subscript  ε  n   0    \varepsilon_{n}>0   such that if a n -dimensional manifold admits an    ε  n     subscript  ε  n    \varepsilon_{n}   -flat metric with diameter     ≤  1      absent  1    \leq 1   then it is almost flat. On the other hand one can fix the bound of sectional curvature and get the diameter going to zero, so the almost flat manifold is a special case of a collapsing manifold , which is collapsing along all directions.  According to the Gromov—Ruh theorem , M is almost flat if and only if it is infranil . In particular, it is a finite factor of a nilmanifold , which is the total space of a principal torus bundle over a principal torus bundle over a torus.  References    .   .
