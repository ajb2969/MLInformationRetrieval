Almost flat manifold

In mathematics, a smooth compact manifold M is called almost flat if for any 
 
 
 
  there is a Riemannian metric

 
  on M such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -flat, i.e. for the sectional curvature of 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .
In fact, given n, there is a positive number 
 
 
 
  such that if a n-dimensional manifold admits an 
 
 
 
 -flat metric with diameter 
 
 
 
  then it is almost flat. On the other hand one can fix the bound of sectional curvature and get the diameter going to zero, so the almost flat manifold is a special case of a collapsing manifold, which is collapsing along all directions.
According to the Gromovâ€”Ruh theorem, M is almost flat if and only if it is infranil. In particular, it is a finite factor of a nilmanifold, which is the total space of a principal torus bundle over a principal torus bundle over a torus.
