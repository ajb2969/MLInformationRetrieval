   Multiscroll attractor      Multiscroll attractor   (Figure)  Double-scroll attractor from a simulation   In the mathematics of dynamical systems , the double-scroll attractor (sometimes known as Chua's attractor ) is a strange attractor observed from a physical electronic chaotic circuit (generally, Chua's circuit ) with a single nonlinear resistor (see Chua's Diode ). The double-scroll system is often described by a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations and a 3-segment piecewise-linear equation (see Chua's equations ). This makes the system easily simulated numerically and easily manifested physically due to Chua's circuits' simple design.  Using a Chua's circuit, this shape is viewed on an oscilloscope using the X, Y, and Z output signals of the circuit. This chaotic attractor is known as the double scroll because of its shape in three-dimensional space, which is similar to two saturn-like rings connected by swirling lines.  The attractor was first observed in simulations, then realized physically after Leon Chua invented the autonomous chaotic circuit which became known as Chua's circuit. 1 The double-scroll attractor from the Chua circuit was rigorously proven to be chaotic 2 through a number of Poincaré return maps of the attractor explicitly derived by way of compositions of the eigenvectors of the 3-dimensional state space. 3  Numerical analysis of the double-scroll attractor has shown that its geometrical structure is made up of an infinite number of fractal-like layers. Each cross section appears to be a fractal at all scales. 4 Recently, there has also been reported the discovery of hidden attractors within the double scroll. 5  In 1999 Guanrong Chen (陈关荣) and Ueta proprosed another double scroll chaotic attractor. 6  Chen system:        d  x   (  t  )     d  t    =   a  *   (    y   (  t  )    -
