   Genus field      Genus field   In algebraic number theory , the genus field  G of an algebraic number field  K is the maximal  abelian extension of K which is obtained by composing an absolutely abelian field with K and which is unramified at all finite primes of K . The genus number of K is the degree [ G : K ] and the genus group is the Galois group of G over K .  If K is itself absolutely abelian, the genus field may be described as the maximal absolutely abelian extension of K unramified at all finite primes: this definition was used by Leopoldt and Hasse.  If K = Q (√ m ) ( m squarefree) is a quadratic field of discriminant D , the genus field of K is a composite of quadratic fields. Let p i run over the prime factors of D . For each such prime p , define p ∗ as follows:       p  *   =  ±  p  ≡  1   (   mod  4   )   if  p  is odd  ;     fragments   superscript  p     plus-or-minus  p   1   pmod  4   if  p  is odd  normal-;    p^{*}=\pm p\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}4)\text{ if }p\text{ is odd};            2  *   =    -  4   ,  8    ,    -   8  according as  m    ≡    3     (   mod  4   )    ,   2     (   mod  8   )    ,    -  2      (   mod  8   )       .     formulae-sequence     superscript  2       4   8          8  according as  m      annotated  3   pmod  4     annotated  2   pmod  8     annotated    2    pmod  8        2^{*}=-4,8,-8\text{ according as }m\equiv 3\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}4),2\;\;(%
 \mathop{{\rm mod}}8),-2\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}8).     Then the genus field is the composite K (√ p i ∗ ).  See also   Hilbert class field   References       "  Category:Class field theory
