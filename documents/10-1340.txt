   Cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase      Cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase   In enzymology , a cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction  (Figure)  Cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide reductase.svg    2 cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide + FMN + 3 H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide + FMNH 2   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide , FMN , and H + , whereas its two products are cob(II)yrinic acid a,c-diamide and FMNH2 .  Classification  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those oxidizing metal ion with a flavin as acceptor.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is cob(I)yrinic acid-a,c-diamide:FMN oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called cob(II)yrinic acid-a,c-diamide:FMN oxidoreductase (incorrect) .  Biological role  This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .
