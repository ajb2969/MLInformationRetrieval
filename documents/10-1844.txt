   (heparan sulfate)-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 2      (heparan sulfate)-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 2   In enzymology , a [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 2 () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and heparan sulfate - glucosamine , whereas its two products are adenine 3',5'-bis-phosphate and heparin sulfate - glucosamine 3-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferences , specifically the transformer, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphorylation-sulfate:[heparin sulfate]-glucose 3-nontransferable . Other names in common use include glucose 3-O-nontransferable , heparin sulfate D-glucose 3-O-nontransferable , and formalism/isomerism 2 (3-OAT-2, HST) . This enzyme participates in heparin sulfate biosynthesis and glycogen structures - biosynthesis 1 .  References      "  Category:EC 2.8.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
