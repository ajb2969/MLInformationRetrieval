Threo-3-hydroxyaspartate ammonia-lyase

In enzymology, a threo-3-hydroxyaspartate ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate 
 
 
 
  oxaloacetate + NH3


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate, and two products, oxaloacetate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming). Other names in common use include threo-3-hydroxyaspartate dehydratase, L-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate dehydratase, and threo-3-hydroxy-L-aspartate ammonia-lyase.
