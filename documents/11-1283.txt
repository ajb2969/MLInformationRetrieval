   Hydroquinone glucosyltransferase      Hydroquinone glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a hydroquinone glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + hydroquinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + hydroquinone-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and hydroquinone , whereas its two products are UDP and hydroquinone-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:hydroquinone-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include arbutin synthase , and hydroquinone:O-glucosyltransferase .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
