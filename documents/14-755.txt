   Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)      Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)   Orbital perturbation analysis is the activity of determining why a satellite's orbit differs from the mathematical ideal orbit. A satellite's orbit in an ideal two-body system describes a conic section, or ellipse. In reality, there are several factors that cause the conic section to continually change. These deviations from the ideal Kepler's orbit are called perturbations .  Perturbation of spacecraft orbits  It has long been recognized that the Moon does not follow a perfect orbit, and many theories and models have been examined over the millennia to explain it. Isaac Newton determined the primary contributing factor to orbital perturbation of the moon was that the shape of the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid due to its spin, and he used the perturbations of the lunar orbit to estimate the oblateness of the Earth.  In Newton's Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , he demonstrated that the gravitational force between two mass points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the points, and he fully solved the corresponding "two-body problem" demonstrating that the radius vector between the two points would describe an ellipse. But no exact closed analytical form could be found for the three body problem . Instead, mathematical models called "orbital perturbation analysis" have been developed. With these techniques a quite accurate mathematical description of the trajectories of all the planets could be obtained. Newton recognized that the Moon's perturbations could not entirely be accounted for using just the solution to the three body problem, as the deviations from a pure Kepler orbit around the Earth are much larger than deviations of the orbits of the planets from their own Sun-centred Kepler orbits, caused by the gravitational attraction between the planets. With the availability of digital computers and the ease with which we can now compute orbits, this problem has partly disappeared, as the motion of all celestial bodies including planets, satellites, asteroids and comets can be modelled and predicted with almost perfect accuracy using the method of the numerical propagation of the trajectories. Nevertheless several analytical closed form expressions for the effect of such additional "perturbing forces" are still very useful.  All celestial bodies of the Solar System follow in first approximation a Kepler orbit around a central body. For a satellite (artificial or natural) this central body is a planet. But both due to gravitational forces caused by the Sun and other celestial bodies and due to the flattening of its planet (caused by its rotation which makes the planet slightly oblate and therefore the result of the Shell theorem not fully applicable) the satellite will follow an orbit around the Earth that deviates more than the Kepler orbits observed for the planets.  The precise modelling of the motion of the Moon has been a difficult task. The best and most accurate modelling for the lunar orbit before the availability of digital computers was obtained with the complicated Delaunay and Brown 's lunar theories .  For man-made spacecraft orbiting the Earth at comparatively low altitudes the deviations from a Kepler orbit are much larger than for the Moon. The approximation of the gravitational force of the Earth to be that of a homogeneous sphere gets worse the closer one gets to the Earth surface and the majority of the artificial Earth satellites are in orbits that are only a few hundred kilometres over the Earth surface. Furthermore they are (as opposed to the Moon) significantly affected by the solar radiation pressure because of their large cross-section to mass ratio; this applies in particular to 3-axis stabilized spacecraft with large solar arrays . In addition they are significantly affected by rarefied air below 800–1000 km. The air drag at high altitudes is also dependent on solar activity .  Mathematical approach  Consider any function      g   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   ,   v  1   ,   v  2   ,   v  3   )       g    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3    subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3      g(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},v_{1},v_{2},v_{3})\,     of the position       x  1   ,   x  2   ,    x  3        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3     x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\,     and the velocity       v  1   ,   v  2   ,    v  3        subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3     v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\,     From the chain rule of differentiation one gets that the time derivative of   g   g   g   is        g  ˙    =       ∂  g    ∂   x  1        v  1     +      ∂  g    ∂   x  2        v  2     +      ∂  g    ∂   x  3        v  3     +      ∂  g    ∂   v  1        f  1     +      ∂  g    ∂   v  2        f  2     +      ∂  g    ∂   v  3       f  3          normal-˙  g           g      subscript  x  1      subscript  v  1          g      subscript  x  2      subscript  v  2          g      subscript  x  3      subscript  v  3          g      subscript  v  1      subscript  f  1          g      subscript  v  2      subscript  f  2          g      subscript  v  3      subscript  f  3       \dot{g}\ =\ \frac{\partial g}{\partial x_{1}}\ v_{1}\ +\ \frac{\partial g}{%

If now   g   g   g   is a "constant of motion" for a Kepler orbit like for example an orbital element and the force is corresponding "Kepler force"       (    f  1    ,    f  2    ,   f  3   )   =   -     μ   r  3      (    x  1    ,    x  2    ,   x  3   )           subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    subscript  f  3          μ   superscript  r  3      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3        (f_{1}\ ,\ f_{2}\ ,\ f_{3})\ =\ -\frac{\mu}{r^{3}}\ (x_{1}\ ,\ x_{2}\ ,\ x_{3})   one has that      g  ˙    =   0        normal-˙  g   0    \dot{g}\ =\ 0\,   .  If the force is the sum of the "Kepler force" and an additional force (force per unit mass)      (    h  1    ,    h  2    ,   h  3   )      subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2    subscript  h  3     (h_{1}\ ,\ h_{2}\ ,\ h_{3})     i.e.       (    f  1    ,    f  2    ,   f  3   )   =    -     μ   r  3      (    x  1    ,    x  2    ,   x  3   )     +   (    h  1    ,    h  2    ,   h  3   )          subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    subscript  f  3            μ   superscript  r  3      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3        subscript  h  1    subscript  h  2    subscript  h  3       (f_{1}\ ,\ f_{2}\ ,\ f_{3})\ =\ -\frac{\mu}{r^{3}}\ (x_{1}\ ,\ x_{2}\ ,\ x_{3}%

In general one wants to find an approximate expression for the change    Δ   g       normal-Δ  g    \Delta g\,   over one orbital revolution using the true anomaly    θ    θ   \theta\,   as integration variable, i.e. as    d\theta   | 1 }}  This integral is evaluated setting     r   (  θ  )    =    p   1  +   e   cos  θ             r  θ     p    1    e    θ        r(\theta)=\frac{p}{1+e\cos\theta}\,   , the elliptical Kepler orbit in polar angles. For the transformation of integration variable from time to true anomaly it was used that the angular momentum     H   =     r  2      θ  ˙     =     μ  p           H     superscript  r  2    normal-˙  θ             μ  p       H\ =\ r^{2}\ \dot{\theta}\ =\ \sqrt{\mu p}\,   by definition of the parameter    p    p   p\,   for a Kepler orbit (see equation (13) of the Kepler orbit article).  For the special case where the Kepler orbit is circular or almost circular       r   =  p      r  p    r\ =\ p   and () takes the simpler form     where     P   =   2   π    r      r  μ          P    2  π  r      r  μ       P\ =\ 2\pi\ r\ \sqrt{\frac{r}{\mu}}\,   is the orbital period  Perturbation of the semi-major axis/orbital period  For an elliptic Kepler orbit , the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy      g  =     V  2   2   -   μ  r        g       superscript  V  2   2     μ  r      g=\frac{V^{2}}{2}-\frac{\mu}{r}   ,  where    V    V   V\,   is the orbital velocity, is a constant and equal to       g   =   -   μ   2  ⋅  a         g      μ   normal-⋅  2  a       g\ =\ -\frac{\mu}{2\cdot a}   (Equation ( 44 ) of the Kepler orbit article)  If     h  ¯      normal-¯  h    \bar{h}\,   is the perturbing force and     V  ¯      normal-¯  V    \bar{V}\,   is the velocity vector of the Kepler orbit the equation () takes the form:    d\theta   | 3 }}  and for a circular or almost circular orbit     From the change    Δ   g       normal-Δ  g    \Delta g\,   of the parameter    g    g   g\,   the new semi-major axis    a    a   a\,   and the new period     P   =   2   π    a      a  μ          P    2  π  a      a  μ       P\ =\ 2\pi\ a\ \sqrt{\frac{a}{\mu}}\,   are computed (relations (43) and (44) of the Kepler orbit article).  Perturbation of the orbital plane  Let     g  ^      normal-^  g    \hat{g}\,   and     h  ^      normal-^  h    \hat{h}\,   make up a rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit.

Perturbation of the eccentricity vector  Rather than applying (1) and (2) on the partial derivatives of the orbital elements eccentricity and argument of perigee directly one should apply these relations for the eccentricity vector . First of all the typical application is a near-circular orbit. But there are also mathematical advantages working with the partial derivatives of the components of this vector also for orbits with a significant eccentricity.

Applying () one gets that     This means the eccentricity vector will gradually increase in the direction     l  ^      normal-^  l    \hat{l}\,   orthogonal to the Sun direction. This is true for any orbit with a small eccentricity, the direction of the small eccentricity vector does not matter.
