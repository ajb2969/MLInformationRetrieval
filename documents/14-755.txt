Orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)

Orbital perturbation analysis is the activity of determining why a satellite's orbit differs from the mathematical ideal orbit. A satellite's orbit in an ideal two-body system describes a conic section, or ellipse. In reality, there are several factors that cause the conic section to continually change. These deviations from the ideal Kepler's orbit are called perturbations.
Perturbation of spacecraft orbits
It has long been recognized that the Moon does not follow a perfect orbit, and many theories and models have been examined over the millennia to explain it. Isaac Newton determined the primary contributing factor to orbital perturbation of the moon was that the shape of the Earth is actually an oblate spheroid due to its spin, and he used the perturbations of the lunar orbit to estimate the oblateness of the Earth.
In Newton's Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, he demonstrated that the gravitational force between two mass points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the points, and he fully solved the corresponding "two-body problem" demonstrating that the radius vector between the two points would describe an ellipse. But no exact closed analytical form could be found for the three body problem. Instead, mathematical models called "orbital perturbation analysis" have been developed. With these techniques a quite accurate mathematical description of the trajectories of all the planets could be obtained. Newton recognized that the Moon's perturbations could not entirely be accounted for using just the solution to the three body problem, as the deviations from a pure Kepler orbit around the Earth are much larger than deviations of the orbits of the planets from their own Sun-centred Kepler orbits, caused by the gravitational attraction between the planets. With the availability of digital computers and the ease with which we can now compute orbits, this problem has partly disappeared, as the motion of all celestial bodies including planets, satellites, asteroids and comets can be modelled and predicted with almost perfect accuracy using the method of the numerical propagation of the trajectories. Nevertheless several analytical closed form expressions for the effect of such additional "perturbing forces" are still very useful.
All celestial bodies of the Solar System follow in first approximation a Kepler orbit around a central body. For a satellite (artificial or natural) this central body is a planet. But both due to gravitational forces caused by the Sun and other celestial bodies and due to the flattening of its planet (caused by its rotation which makes the planet slightly oblate and therefore the result of the Shell theorem not fully applicable) the satellite will follow an orbit around the Earth that deviates more than the Kepler orbits observed for the planets.
The precise modelling of the motion of the Moon has been a difficult task. The best and most accurate modelling for the lunar orbit before the availability of digital computers was obtained with the complicated Delaunay and Brown's lunar theories.
For man-made spacecraft orbiting the Earth at comparatively low altitudes the deviations from a Kepler orbit are much larger than for the Moon. The approximation of the gravitational force of the Earth to be that of a homogeneous sphere gets worse the closer one gets to the Earth surface and the majority of the artificial Earth satellites are in orbits that are only a few hundred kilometres over the Earth surface. Furthermore they are (as opposed to the Moon) significantly affected by the solar radiation pressure because of their large cross-section to mass ratio; this applies in particular to 3-axis stabilized spacecraft with large solar arrays. In addition they are significantly affected by rarefied air below 800–1000 km. The air drag at high altitudes is also dependent on solar activity.
Mathematical approach
Consider any function



of the position



and the velocity



From the chain rule of differentiation one gets that the time derivative of 
 
 
 
  is



where 
 
 
 
  are the components of the force per unit mass acting on the body.
If now 
 
 
 
  is a "constant of motion" for a Kepler orbit like for example an orbital element and the force is corresponding "Kepler force"


 
  one has that 
 
 
 
 .
If the force is the sum of the "Kepler force" and an additional force (force per unit mass)



i.e.



one therefore has



and that the change of 
 
 
 
  in the time from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is



If now the additional force 
 
 
 
  is sufficiently small that the motion will be close to that of a Kepler orbit one gets an approximate value for 
 
 
 
  by evaluating this integral assuming 
 
 
 
  to precisely follow this Kepler orbit.
In general one wants to find an approximate expression for the change 
 
 
 
  over one orbital revolution using the true anomaly 
 
 
 
  as integration variable, i.e. as


d\theta

|1}}
This integral is evaluated setting 
 
 
 
 , the elliptical Kepler orbit in polar angles. For the transformation of integration variable from time to true anomaly it was used that the angular momentum 
 
 
 
  by definition of the parameter 
 
 
 
  for a Kepler orbit (see equation (13) of the Kepler orbit article).
For the special case where the Kepler orbit is circular or almost circular


 
  and () takes the simpler form



where 
 
 
 
  is the orbital period
Perturbation of the semi-major axis/orbital period
For an elliptic Kepler orbit, the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the orbital velocity, is a constant and equal to


 
  (Equation (44) of the Kepler orbit article)
If 
 
 
 
  is the perturbing force and 
 
 
 
 is the velocity vector of the Kepler orbit the equation () takes the form:


d\theta

and for a circular or almost circular orbit



From the change 
 
 
 
  of the parameter 
 
 
 
  the new semi-major axis 
 
 
 
  and the new period 
 
 
 
  are computed (relations (43) and (44) of the Kepler orbit article).
Perturbation of the orbital plane
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  make up a rectangular coordinate system in the plane of the reference Kepler orbit. If 
 
 
 
  is the argument of perigee relative the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  coordinate system the true anomaly 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
  and the approximate change 
 
 
 
  of the orbital pole 
 
 
 
  (defined as the unit vector in the direction of the angular momentum) is


du \quad \times \ \hat{z}

=\ \frac{1}{\mu p}\left[\hat{g}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z r^3 \cos u \ du +\ \hat{h}\int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}f_z r^3 \sin u \ du \right]\quad \times \ \hat{z} |5}}
where 
 
 
 
  is the component of the perturbing force in the 
 
 
 
  direction, 
 
 
 
  is the velocity component of the Kepler orbit orthogonal to radius vector and 
 
 
 
  is the distance to the center of the Earth.
For a circular or almost circular orbit () simplifies to



Example
In a circular orbit a low-force propulsion system (Ion thruster) generates a thrust (force per unit mass) of 
 
 
 
  in the direction of the orbital pole in the half of the orbit for which 
 
 
 
  is positive and in the opposite direction in the other half. The resulting change of orbit pole after one orbital revolution of duration 
 
 
 
  is



The average change rate 
 
 
 
  is therefore


{P} =\ \frac{2}{\pi}\ \frac{F}{V}\ \hat{g}

  is the orbital velocity in the circular Kepler orbit.
Perturbation of the eccentricity vector
Rather than applying (1) and (2) on the partial derivatives of the orbital elements eccentricity and argument of perigee directly one should apply these relations for the eccentricity vector. First of all the typical application is a near-circular orbit. But there are also mathematical advantages working with the partial derivatives of the components of this vector also for orbits with a significant eccentricity.
Equations (60), (55) and (52) of the Kepler orbit article say that the eccentricity vector is


{V_0}|9}}

where


|10}}


from which follows that


{\partial V_r} = -\frac {1}{V_0} \hat{t}|12}}

{\partial V_t} = \frac {1}{V_0} \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)|13}}

where


\cdot e \cdot \sin \theta|14}}

\cdot (1 + e \cdot \cos \theta)|15}}

(Equations (18) and (19) of the Kepler orbit article)
The eccentricity vector is by definition always in the osculating orbital plane spanned by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and formally there is also a derivative



with



corresponding to the rotation of the orbital plane
But in practice the in-plane change of the eccentricity vector is computed as


du\ = \\

&\frac {1}{\mu}\ \int\limits_{0}^{2\pi}\left(-\hat{t}\ f_r\ + \ \left(2\ \hat{r}-\frac{V_r}{V_t}\ \hat{t}\right)\ f_t\right) r^2 du \end{align} |16}}
ignoring the out-of-plane force and the new eccentricity vector


 
  is subsequently projected to the new orbital plane orthogonal to the new orbit normal


 
  computed as described above.
Example
The Sun is in the orbital plane of a spacecraft in a circular orbit with radius 
 
 
 
  and consequently with a constant orbital velocity 
 
 
 
  . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  make up a rectangular coordinate system in the orbital plane such that 
 
 
 
  points to the Sun and assuming that the solar radiation pressure force per unit mass 
 
 
 
  is constant one gets that












where 
 
 
 
  is the polar angle of 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  system. Applying () one gets that



This means the eccentricity vector will gradually increase in the direction 
 
 
 
  orthogonal to the Sun direction. This is true for any orbit with a small eccentricity, the direction of the small eccentricity vector does not matter. As 
 
 
 
  is the orbital period this means that the average rate of this increase will be 
 
 

The effect of the Earth flattening
 In the article Geopotential model the modeling of the gravitational field as a sum of spherical harmonics is discussed. By far, the dominating term is the "J2-term". This is a "zonal term" and corresponding force is therefore completely in a longitudinal plane with one component 
 
 
 
  in the radial direction and one component 
 
 
 
  with the unit vector 
 
 
 
  orthogonal to the radial direction towards north. These directions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are illustrated in Figure 1.
(Figure)
Figure 2: The unit vector 
 
 
 
  orthogonal to 
 
 
 
  in the direction of motion and the orbital pole 
 
 
 
 . The force component 
 
 
 
  is marked as "F"

To be able to apply relations derived in the previous section the force component 
 
 
 
  must be split into two orthogonal components 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as illustrated in figure 2
Let 
 
 
 
  make up a rectangular coordinate system with origin in the center of the Earth (in the center of the Reference ellipsoid) such that 
 
 
 
  points in the direction north and such that 
 
 
 
  are in the equatorial plane of the Earth with 
 
 
 
  pointing towards the ascending node, i.e. towards the blue point of Figure 2.
The components of the unit vectors



making up the local coordinate system (of which 
 
 
 
  are illustrated in figure 2) relative the 
 
 
 
  are



























where 
 
 
 
  is the polar argument of 
 
 
 
  relative the orthogonal unit vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the orbital plane
Firstly



where 
 
 
 
  is the angle between the equator plane and 
 
 
 
  (between the green points of figure 2) and from equation (12) of the article Geopotential model one therefore gets that



Secondly the projection of direction north, 
 
 
 
 , on the plane spanned by 
 
 
 
  is



and this projection is



where 
 
 
 
  is the unit vector 
 
 
 
  orthogonal to the radial direction towards north illustrated in figure 1.
From equation (12) of the article Geopotential model one therefore gets that



and therefore:




Perturbation of the orbital plane
From () and () one gets that



The fraction 
 
 
 
  is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the eccentricity and 
 
 
 
  is the argument of perigee of the reference Kepler orbit
As all integrals of type


 
  are zero if not both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are even one gets from () that



As



this can be written



As 
 
 
 
  is an inertially fixed vector (the direction of the spin axis of the Earth) relation () is the equation of motion for a unit vector 
 
 
 
  describing a cone around 
 
 
 
  with a precession rate (radians per orbit) of 
 
 

In terms of orbital elements this is expressed as




where


 
  is the inclination of the orbit to the equatorial plane of the Earth


 
  is the right ascension of the ascending node
Perturbation of the eccentricity vector
From (), () and () follows that in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector is



the new eccentricity vector being the projection of



on the new orbital plane orthogonal to


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is given by ()
Relative the coordinate system






one has that






Using that


 
  and that



where






are the components of the eccentricity vector in the 
 
 
 
  coordinate system this integral () can be evaluated analytically, the result is



This the difference equation of motion for the eccentricity vector 
 
 
 
  to form a circle, the magnitude of the eccentricity 
 
 
 
  staying constant.
Translating this to orbital elements it must be remembered that the new eccentricity vector obtained by adding 
 
 
 
  to the old 
 
 
 
  must be projected to the new orbital plane obtained by applying () and ()
 This is illustrated in figure 3:
To the change in argument of the eccentricity vector



must be added an increment due to the precession of the orbital plane (caused by the out-of-plane force component) amounting to



One therefore gets that






In terms of the components of the eccentricity vector 
 
 
 
  relative the coordinate system 
 
 
 
  that precesses around the polar axis of the Earth the same is expressed as follows



where the first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector and the second is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new plane
From () follows that 
 
 
 
  is zero if 
 
 
 
 . This fact is used for Molniya orbits having an inclination of 63.4 deg. An orbit with an inclination of 180 - 63.4 deg = 116.6 deg would in the same way have a constant argument of perigee.
