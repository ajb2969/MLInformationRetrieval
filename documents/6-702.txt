   Giovanni Vacca      Giovanni Vacca   Giovanni Enrico Eugenio Vacca (18 November 1872 – 6 January 1953) was an Italian  mathematician , Sinologist and historian of science.  Vacca studied mathematics and graduated from the University of Genoa in 1897 under the guidance of G. B. Negri. He was a politically active student and was banished for that from Genoa in 1897. He moved to Turin and became an assistant to Giuseppe Peano . In 1899 he studied, at Hanover , unpublished manuscripts of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , which he published in 1903. Around 1898 Vacca became interested in Chinese language and culture after attending a Chinese exhibition in Turin . He took private lessons of Chinese and continued to study it at the University of Florence . Vacca then traveled to China in 1907–8 and defended a PhD in Chinese studies in 1910. In 1911, he became a lecturer in Chinese literature at the University of Rome . In 1922, he moved to Florence and taught Chinese literature and language at university until 1947. 1  The interests of Vacca were almost equally split between mathematics, Sinology and history of science, with a corresponding number of papers being 38, 47 and 45. In 1910, Vacca developed a complex number iteration for pi : 2         x  0   =  i   ,     x   n  +  1    =     x  n   +   |   x  n   |    2    ,     lim   n  →  ∞     x  n    =   2  π      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  x  0   i    formulae-sequence     subscript  x    n  1         subscript  x  n      subscript  x  n     2        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  x  n      2  π       x_{0}=i,\quad x_{n+1}=\frac{x_{n}+|x_{n}|}{2},\qquad\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}=%
 \frac{2}{\pi}.     The calculation efficiency of these formulas is significantly worse than of the modern Borwein's algorithm – they converge by only about half a decimal point with each iteration.  Vacca published his two major contributions to mathematics in 1910 and 1926, on series expansion (later named Vacca series) of the Euler constant . They are, respectively        γ    =       ∑   k  =  2   ∞      (   -  1   )   k     ⌊    log  2   k   ⌋   k     =      1  2    -    1  3     +   2   (       1  4    -    1  5     +    1  6     -    1  7     )    +   3   (     1  8    -  ⋯  -    1  15     )    +  ⋯          ζ   (  2  )    +  γ     =       ∑   k  =  2   ∞    (    1    ⌊   k   ⌋   2    -   1  k    )    =    ∑   k  =  2   ∞     k  -    ⌊   k   ⌋   2     k    ⌊   k   ⌋   2      =     1  2    +    2  3    +     1   2  2      (     1  5    +    2  6    +    3  7    +    4  8     )    +     1   3  2      (     1  10    +  ⋯  +    6  15     )    +  ⋯          γ       superscript   subscript     k  2         superscript    1   k         subscript   2   k    k           1  2     1  3      2          1  4     1  5      1  6      1  7       3      1  8   normal-⋯    1  15     normal-⋯          ζ  2   γ          superscript   subscript     k  2          1   superscript      k    2      1  k       superscript   subscript     k  2          k   superscript      k    2      k   superscript      k    2               1  2     2  3       1   superscript  2  2        1  5     2  6     3  7     4  8         1   superscript  3  2        1  10   normal-⋯    6  15     normal-⋯        \begin{array}[]{rcl}\gamma&=&\sum_{k=2}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\frac{\left\lfloor\log%
