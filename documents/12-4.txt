The shifted log-logistic distribution is a probability distribution also known as the generalized log-logistic or the three-parameter log-logistic distribution.12 It has also been called the generalized logistic distribution,3 but this conflicts with other uses of the term: see generalized logistic distribution.
Definition
The shifted log-logistic distribution can be obtained from the log-logistic distribution by addition of a shift parameter

 
 . Thus if 
 
 
 
  has a log-logistic distribution then 
 
 
 
  has a shifted log-logistic distribution. So 
 
 
 
  has a shifted log-logistic distribution if 
 
 
 
  has a logistic distribution. The shift parameter adds a location parameter to the scale and shape parameters of the (unshifted) log-logistic.
The properties of this distribution are straightforward to derive from those of the log-logistic distribution. However, an alternative parameterisation, similar to that used for the generalized Pareto distribution and the generalized extreme value distribution, gives more interpretable parameters and also aids their estimation.
In this parameterisation, the cumulative distribution function of the shifted log-logistic distribution is


 
  for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the location parameter, 
 
 
 
  the scale parameter and 
 
 
 
  the shape parameter. Note that some references use 
 
 
 
  to parameterise the shape.45
The probability density function is


 
  again, for 
 
 

The shape parameter 
 
 
 
  is often restricted to lie in [-1,1], when the probability density function is bounded. When 
 
 
 
 , it has an asymptote at 
 
 
 
 . Reversing the sign of 
 
 
 
  reflects the pdf and the cdf about 
 
 
 
 .

When 
 
 
 
  the shifted log-logistic reduces to the log-logistic distribution.
When 
 
 
 
  → 0, the shifted log-logistic reduces to the logistic distribution.
The shifted log-logistic with shape parameter 
 
 
 
  is the same as the generalized Pareto distribution with shape parameter 
 
 


Applications
The three-parameter log-logistic distribution is used in hydrology for modelling flood frequency.678
