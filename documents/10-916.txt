   Cortisone alpha-reductase      Cortisone alpha-reductase   In enzymology , a cortisone alpha-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4,5alpha-dihydrocortisone + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cortisone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4,5alpha-dihydrocortisone and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are cortisone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4,5alpha-dihydrocortisone:NADP+ Delta4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cortisone Delta4-5alpha-reductase , microsomal steroid reductase (5alpha) , Delta4-3-ketosteroid reductase (5alpha) , Delta4-3-oxosteroid-5alpha-reductase , NADPH:Delta4-3-oxosteroid-5alpha-oxidoreductase , and Delta4-5alpha-reductase .
