<h1>Higher-order abstract syntax</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="computer_science" title="wikilink">computer science</a>, <strong>higher-order abstract syntax</strong> (abbreviated <strong>HOAS</strong>) is a technique for the representation of <a href="abstract_syntax_tree" title="wikilink">abstract syntax trees</a> for languages with variable <a href="name_binding" title="wikilink">binders</a>.</p>
<h2 id="relation-to-first-order-abstract-syntax">Relation to first-order abstract syntax</h2>

<p>An abstract syntax tree is <em>abstract</em> because it is a <a href="mathematical_object" title="wikilink">mathematical object</a> that has certain structure by its very nature. For instance, in <em><a href="first-order_abstract_syntax" title="wikilink">first-order abstract syntax</a></em> (<em>FOAS</em>) trees, as commonly used in <a href="compiler" title="wikilink">compilers</a>, the tree structure implies the subexpression relation, meaning that no parentheses are required to disambiguate programs (as they are in the <a href="concrete_syntax" title="wikilink">concrete syntax</a>). HOAS exposes additional structure: the relationship between variables and their binding sites. In FOAS representations, a variable is typically represented with an identifier, with the relation between binding site and use being indicated by using the <em>same</em> identifier. With HOAS, there is no name for the variable; each use of the variable refers directly to the binding site.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why this technique is useful. First, it makes the binding structure of a program explicit: just as there is no need to explain operator precedence in a FOAS representation, there is no need to have the rules of binding and scope at hand to interpret a HOAS representation. Second, programs that are <a href="lambda_calculus" title="wikilink">alpha-equivalent</a> (differing only in the names of bound variables) have identical representations in HOAS, which can make equivalence checking more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>One mathematical object that could be used to implement HOAS is a <a href="graph_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">graph</a> where variables are associated with their binding sites via <a href="edge_(graph_theory)" title="wikilink">edges</a>. Another popular way to implement HOAS (in, for example, compilers) is with <a href="de_Bruijn_index" title="wikilink">de Bruijn indices</a>.</p>
<h2 id="use-in-logical-frameworks">Use in logical frameworks</h2>

<p>In the domain of <a href="logical_framework" title="wikilink">logical frameworks</a>, the term higher-order abstract syntax is usually used to refer to a specific representation that uses the binders of the <a href="metalanguage" title="wikilink">meta-language</a> to encode the binding structure of the <a href="object_language" title="wikilink">object language</a>.</p>

<p>For instance, the logical framework <a href="LF_(logical_framework)" title="wikilink">LF</a> has a λ-construct, which has arrow (→) type. A first-order encoding of an object language construct <code>let</code> would be (using <a class="uri" href="Twelf" title="wikilink">Twelf</a> syntax):</p>

<p><code>exp : type.</code><br/>
<code>var : type.</code><br/>
<code>v : var -&gt; exp.</code><br/>
<code>let : exp -&gt; var -&gt; exp -&gt; exp.</code></p>

<p>Here, <code>exp</code> is the family of object language expressions. The family <code>var</code> is the representation of variables (implemented perhaps as natural numbers, which is not shown); the constant <code>v</code> witnesses the fact that variables are expressions. The constant <code>let</code> is an expression that takes three arguments: an expression (that is being bound), a variable (that it is bound to) and another expression (that the variable is bound within).</p>

<p>The <a href="canonical_form" title="wikilink">canonical</a> HOAS representation of the same object language would be:</p>

<p><code>exp : type.</code><br/>
<code>let : exp -&gt; (exp -&gt; exp) -&gt; exp.</code></p>

<p>In this representation, object level variables do not appear explicitly. The constant <code>let</code> takes an expression (that is being bound) and a meta-level function <code>exp</code> → <code>exp</code> (the body of the let). This function is the <em>higher-order</em> part: an expression with a free variable is represented as an expression with <em>holes</em> that are filled in by the meta-level function when applied. As a concrete example, we would construct the object level expression</p>

<p><code>let x = 1 + 2</code><br/>
<code>in x + 3</code></p>

<p>(assuming the natural constructors for numbers and addition) using the HOAS signature above as</p>

<p><code>let (plus 1 2) ([y] plus y 3)</code></p>

<p>where <code>[y] e</code> is Twelf's syntax for the function

   </apply>
  </annotation-xml>
  <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
   \lambda y.e
  </annotation>
 </semantics>
</math>

.</p>

<p>This specific representation has advantages beyond the ones above: for one, by reusing the meta-level notion of binding, the encoding enjoys properties such as type-preserving <em>substitution</em> without the need to define/prove them. In this way using HOAS can drastically reduce the amount of <a href="boilerplate_code" title="wikilink">boilerplate code</a> having to do with binding in an encoding.</p>

<p>Higher-order abstract syntax is generally only applicable when object language variables can be understood as variables in the mathematical sense (that is, as stand-ins for arbitrary members of some domain). This is often, but not always, the case: for instance, there are no advantages to be gained from a HOAS encoding of <a href="scope_(programming)#Dynamic_scoping" title="wikilink">dynamic scope</a> as it appears in some dialects of <a href="Lisp_programming_language" title="wikilink">Lisp</a> because dynamically scoped variables do not act like mathematical variables.</p>
