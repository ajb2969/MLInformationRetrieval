   John ellipsoid      John ellipsoid   In mathematics , the John ellipsoid  E ( K ) associated to a convex body  K in n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n is the ellipsoid of maximal n -dimensional volume contained within K . The John ellipsoid is named after the German  mathematician  Fritz John . The following refinement of John's original theorem, due to Ball (1992), gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the John ellipsoid of K to be the closed unit ball  B of R n :  The John ellipsoid E ( K ) of a convex body K ⊂ R n is B  if and only if  B ⊆ K and there exists an integer  m ≥ n and, for i = 1, ..., m , real numbers  c i > 0 and unit vectors  u i ∈ S n −1 ∩ ∂ K such that        ∑   i  =  1   m     c  i    u  i     =  0        superscript   subscript     i  1    m      subscript  c  i    subscript  u  i     0    \sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i}u_{i}=0     and, for all x ∈ R n       x  =    ∑   i  =  1   m     c  i    (   x  ⋅   u  i    )    u  i      .      x    superscript   subscript     i  1    m      subscript  c  i    normal-⋅  x   subscript  u  i     subscript  u  i       x=\sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{i}(x\cdot u_{i})u_{i}.
