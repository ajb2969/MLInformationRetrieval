   Diguanidinobutanase      Diguanidinobutanase   In enzymology , a diguanidinobutanase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,4-diguanidinobutane + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   agmatine + urea   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,4-diguanidinobutane and H 2 O , whereas its two products are agmatine and urea .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,4-diguanidinobutane amidinohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
