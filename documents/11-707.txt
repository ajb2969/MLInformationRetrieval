Diguanidinobutanase

In enzymology, a diguanidinobutanase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1,4-diguanidinobutane + H2O 
 
 
 
  agmatine + urea
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,4-diguanidinobutane and H2O, whereas its two products are agmatine and urea.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,4-diguanidinobutane amidinohydrolase.
