   Hydrogensulfite reductase      Hydrogensulfite reductase   In enzymology , a hydrogensulfite reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trithionate + acceptor + 2 H 2 O + OH-   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3 bisulfite + reduced acceptor   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are trithionate , acceptor , H 2 O , and OH- , whereas its two products are bisulfite and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trithionate:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include bisulfite reductase , dissimilatory sulfite reductase , desulfoviridin , desulforubidin , desulfofuscidin , dissimilatory-type sulfite reductase , and trithionate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase . It has 4 cofactors : iron , sulfur , siroheme , and iron-sulfur .
