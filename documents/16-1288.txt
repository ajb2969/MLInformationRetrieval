   Kosnita's theorem      Kosnita's theorem   (Figure)  X(54) is Kosnita point of the triangle ABC   In Euclidean geometry , Kosnita's theorem is a property of certain circles associated with an arbitrary triangle .  Let    A  B  C      A  B  C    ABC   be an arbitrary triangle,   O   O   O   its circumcenter and     O  a   ,   O  b   ,   O  c       subscript  O  a    subscript  O  b    subscript  O  c     O_{a},O_{b},O_{c}   are the circumcenters of three triangles    O  B  C      O  B  C    OBC   ,    O  C  A      O  C  A    OCA   , and    O  A  B      O  A  B    OAB   respectively. The theorem claims that the three straight lines     A   O  a       A   subscript  O  a     AO_{a}   ,    B   O  b       B   subscript  O  b     BO_{b}   , and    C   O  c       C   subscript  O  c     CO_{c}   are concurrent. 1  Their point of concurrence is known as the triangle's Kosnita point (named by Rigby in 1997). It is the isogonal conjugate of the nine-point center . 2 3 It is triangle center     X   (  54  )       X  54    X(54)   in Clark Kimberling's list . 4 This theorem is special case of Dao's theorem on six circumcenters associated with a cyclic hexagon in. 5 6  References   7  8  9  10  11  12   "  Category:Euclidean geometry  Category:Theorems in geometry           John Rigby (1997), Brief notes on some forgotten geometrical theorems.
