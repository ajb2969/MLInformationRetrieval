In Euclidean geometry, Kosnita's theorem is a property of certain circles associated with an arbitrary triangle.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an arbitrary triangle, 
 
 
 
  its circumcenter and 
 
 
 
  are the circumcenters of three triangles 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  respectively. The theorem claims that the three straight lines

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  are concurrent.1
Their point of concurrence is known as the triangle's Kosnita point (named by Rigby in 1997). It is the isogonal conjugate of the nine-point center.23 It is triangle center

 
  in Clark Kimberling's list.4 This theorem is special case of Dao's theorem on six circumcenters associated with a cyclic hexagon in.56
