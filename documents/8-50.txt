   Vertical tangent      Vertical tangent   (Figure)  Vertical tangent on the function ƒ ( x ) at x = c .   In mathematics , particularly calculus , a vertical tangent is tangent line that is vertical . Because a vertical line has infinite  slope , a function whose graph has a vertical tangent is not differentiable at the point of tangency.  Limit definition  A function ƒ has a vertical tangent at x = a if the difference quotient used to define the derivative has infinite limit:          lim   h  →  0       f   (   a  +  h   )    -   f   (  a  )     h    =    +  ∞   or       lim   h  →  0       f   (   a  +  h   )    -   f   (  a  )     h    =   -  ∞     .     formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  h  0          f    a  h      f  a    h         or        subscript    normal-→  h  0          f    a  h      f  a    h           \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}={+\infty}\quad\text{or}\quad\lim_{h\to 0}%
 \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}={-\infty}.     The first case corresponds to an upward-sloping vertical tangent, and the second case to a downward-sloping vertical tangent. Informally speaking, the graph of ƒ has a vertical tangent at x = a if the derivative of ƒ at a is either positive or negative infinity.  For a continuous function , it is often possible to detect a vertical tangent by taking the limit of the derivative. If        lim   x  →  a      f  ′    (  x  )     =   +   ∞  ,          subscript    normal-→  x  a       superscript  f  normal-′   x         ,      \lim_{x\to a}f^{\prime}(x)={+\infty}\text{,}     then ƒ must have an upward-sloping vertical tangent at x = a . Similarly, if        lim   x  →  a      f  ′    (  x  )     =   -   ∞  ,          subscript    normal-→  x  a       superscript  f  normal-′   x         ,      \lim_{x\to a}f^{\prime}(x)={-\infty}\text{,}     then ƒ must have a downward-sloping vertical tangent at x = a . In these situations, the vertical tangent to ƒ appears as a vertical asymptote on the graph of the derivative.  Vertical cusps  Closely related to vertical tangents are vertical cusps . This occurs when the one-sided derivatives are both infinite, but one is positive and the other is negative. For example, if         lim   h  →   0  -        f   (   a  +  h   )    -   f   (  a  )     h    =    +  ∞   and       lim   h  →   0  +        f   (   a  +  h   )    -   f   (  a  )     h    =   -   ∞  ,        formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  h   superscript  0            f    a  h      f  a    h         and        subscript    normal-→  h   superscript  0            f    a  h      f  a    h         ,       \lim_{h\to 0^{-}}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}={+\infty}\quad\text{and}\quad\lim_{h\to

 ^{+}}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}={-\infty}\text{,}     then the graph of ƒ will have a vertical cusp that slopes up on the left side and down on the right side.  As with vertical tangents, vertical cusps can sometimes be detected for a continuous function by examining the limit of the derivative. For example, if         lim   x  →   a  -       f  ′    (  x  )     =    -  ∞   and       lim   x  →   a  +       f  ′    (  x  )     =   +   ∞  ,        formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  x   superscript  a         superscript  f  normal-′   x         and        subscript    normal-→  x   superscript  a         superscript  f  normal-′   x         ,       \lim_{x\to a^{-}}f^{\prime}(x)={-\infty}\quad\text{and}\quad\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f%
 ^{\prime}(x)={+\infty}\text{,}   then the graph of ƒ will have a vertical cusp that slopes down on the left side and up on the right side. This corresponds to a vertical asymptote on the graph of the derivative that goes to   ∞     \infty   on the left and    -  ∞         -\infty   on the right.
