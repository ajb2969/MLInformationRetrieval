   Dolichyl-phosphate D-xylosyltransferase      Dolichyl-phosphate D-xylosyltransferase   In enzymology , a dolichyl-phosphate D-xylosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-xylose + dolichyl phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + dolichyl D-xylosyl phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-xylose and dolichyl phosphate , whereas its two products are UDP and dolichyl D-xylosyl phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-xylose:dolichyl-phosphate D-xylosyltransferase .
