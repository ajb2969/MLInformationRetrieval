   Hilbert's syzygy theorem      Hilbert's syzygy theorem   In mathematics , Hilbert's syzygy theorem is a result of commutative algebra , first proved by David Hilbert (1890) in connection with the syzygy (relation) problem of invariant theory . Roughly speaking, starting with relations between polynomial invariants , then relations between the relations, and so on, it explains how far one has to go to reach a clarified situation. It is now considered to be an early result of homological algebra , and through the depth concept, to be a measure of the non-singularity of affine space .  Formal statement  In modern language, the theorem may be stated as follows. Let k be a field and M a finitely generated module over the polynomial ring       k   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]    .      k    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}].     Hilbert's syzygy theorem then states that there exists a free resolution of M of length at most n .
