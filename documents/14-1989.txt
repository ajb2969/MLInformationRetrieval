   Normal-inverse-Wishart distribution      Normal-inverse-Wishart distribution   In probability theory and statistics , the normal-inverse-Wishart distribution (or Gaussian-inverse-Wishart distribution ) is a multivariate four-parameter family of continuous probability distributions . It is the conjugate prior of a multivariate normal distribution with unknown mean and covariance matrix (the inverse of the precision matrix ). 1  Definition  Suppose  $$\boldsymbol\mu|\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\boldsymbol\Sigma \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\boldsymbol\mu\Big|\boldsymbol\mu_0,\frac{1}{\lambda}\boldsymbol\Sigma\right)$$ has a multivariate normal distribution with mean  $\boldsymbol\mu_0$ and covariance matrix  $\tfrac{1}{\lambda}\boldsymbol\Sigma$ , where  $$\boldsymbol\Sigma|\boldsymbol\Psi,\nu \sim \mathcal{W}^{-1}(\boldsymbol\Sigma|\boldsymbol\Psi,\nu)$$ has an inverse Wishart distribution . Then $(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma)$ has a normal-inverse-Wishart distribution, denoted as  $$(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma) \sim \mathrm{NIW}(\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\boldsymbol\Psi,\nu)  .$$  Characterization  Probability density function  $$f(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma|\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\boldsymbol\Psi,\nu) = \mathcal{N}\left(\boldsymbol\mu\Big|\boldsymbol\mu_0,\frac{1}{\lambda}\boldsymbol\Sigma\right) \mathcal{W}^{-1}(\boldsymbol\Sigma|\boldsymbol\Psi,\nu)$$  Properties  Scaling  Marginal distributions  By construction, the marginal distribution over $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ is an inverse Wishart distribution , and the conditional distribution over $\boldsymbol\mu$ given $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ is a multivariate normal distribution . The marginal distribution over $\boldsymbol\mu$ is a multivariate t-distribution .  Posterior distribution of the parameters  Generating normal-inverse-Wishart random variates  Generation of random variates is straightforward:   Sample $\boldsymbol\Sigma$ from an inverse Wishart distribution with parameters $\boldsymbol\Psi$ and $\nu$  Sample $\boldsymbol\mu$ from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol\mu_0$ and variance $\boldsymbol \tfrac{1}{\lambda} \boldsymbol\Sigma$   Related distributions   The normal-Wishart distribution is essentially the same distribution parameterized by precision rather than variance. If $(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma) \sim \mathrm{NIW}(\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\boldsymbol\Psi,\nu)$ then $(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}) \sim \mathrm{NW}(\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\boldsymbol\Psi^{-1},\nu)$ .  The normal-inverse-gamma distribution is the one-dimensional equivalent.  The multivariate normal distribution and inverse Wishart distribution are the component distributions out of which this distribution is made.   Notes  References   Bishop, Christopher M. (2006).
