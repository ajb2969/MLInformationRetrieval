   Elongated pentagonal rotunda      Elongated pentagonal rotunda   In geometry , the elongated pentagonal rotunda is one of the Johnson solids ( J 21 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal rotunda ( J 6 ) by attaching a decagonal prism to its base. It can also be seen as an elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda ( J 42 ) with one pentagonal rotunda removed.  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    1  12    (   45  +   17   5    +   30    5  +   2   5        )    a  3    ≈   14.612...   a  3          V      1  12     45    17    5      30      5    2    5         superscript  a  3           14.612...   superscript  a  3       V=\frac{1}{12}(45+17\sqrt{5}+30\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}})a^{3}\approx 14.612...a^{3}       A  =    1  2    (   20  +    5   (   145  +   58   5    +   2    30   (   65  +   29   5     )       )      )    a  2    ≈   32.3472...   a  2          A      1  2     20      5    145    58    5      2      30    65    29    5             superscript  a  2           32.3472...   superscript  a  2       A=\frac{1}{2}(20+\sqrt{5(145+58\sqrt{5}+2\sqrt{30(65+29\sqrt{5})})})a^{2}%
