Undecaprenyl-phosphate 4-deoxy-4-formamido-L-arabinose transferase

Undecaprenyl-phosphate 4-deoxy-4-formamido-L-arabinose transferase (, undecaprenyl-phosphate Ara4FN transferase, Ara4FN transferase, polymyxin resistance protein PmrF, UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-alpha-L-arabinose:ditrans,polycis-undecaprenyl phosphate 4-amino-4-deoxy-alpha-L-arabinosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-alpha-L-arabinose:ditrans,octacis-undecaprenyl phosphate 4-amino-4-deoxy-alpha-L-arabinosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-4-deoxy-4-formamido-beta-L-arabinopyranose + ditrans,octacis-undecaprenyl phosphate 
 
 
 
  UDP + 4-deoxy-4-formamido-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl ditrans,octacis-undecaprenyl phosphate
 

The enzyme shows no activity with UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-beta-L-arabinose.
