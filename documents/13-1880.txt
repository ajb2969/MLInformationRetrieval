   Dini continuity      Dini continuity   In mathematical analysis , Dini continuity is a refinement of continuity . Every Dini continuous function is continuous. Every Lipschitz continuous function is Dini continuous.  Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a compact subset of a metric space (such as    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   ), and let    f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\rightarrow X   be a function from   X   X   X   into itself. The modulus of continuity of   f   f   f   is         ω  f    (  t  )    =    sup    d   (  x  ,  y  )    ≤  t     d   (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )      .         subscript  ω  f   t     subscript  supremum      d   x  y    t      d     f  x     f  y        \omega_{f}(t)=\sup_{d(x,y)\leq t}d(f(x),f(y)).\,     The function   f   f   f   is called Dini-continuous if         ∫  0  1        ω  f    (  t  )    t    d  t    <  ∞   .        superscript   subscript   0   1          subscript  ω  f   t   t   d  t       \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\omega_{f}(t)}{t}\,dt<\infty.     An equivalent condition is that, for any    θ  ∈   (  0  ,  1  )       θ   0  1     \theta\in(0,1)   ,        ∑   i  =  1   ∞     ω  f    (    θ  i   a   )     <  ∞        superscript   subscript     i  1         subscript  ω  f      superscript  θ  i   a        \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\omega_{f}(\theta^{i}a)<\infty     where   a   a   a   is the diameter of   X   X   X   .
