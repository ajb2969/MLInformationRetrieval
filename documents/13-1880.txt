Dini continuity

In mathematical analysis, Dini continuity is a refinement of continuity. Every Dini continuous function is continuous. Every Lipschitz continuous function is Dini continuous.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact subset of a metric space (such as 
 
 
 
 ), and let 
 
 
 
  be a function from 
 
 
 
  into itself. The modulus of continuity of 
 
 
 
  is



The function 
 
 
 
  is called Dini-continuous if



An equivalent condition is that, for any 
 
 
 
 ,



where 
 
 
 
  is the diameter of 
 
 
 
 .
