4-Hydroxycoumarin synthase

4-hydroxycoumarin synthase (, BIS2, BIS3) is an enzyme with system name malonyl-CoA:2-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA malonyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

malonyl-CoA + 2-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA

 
  2 CoA + 4-hydroxycoumarin + CO2


This polyketide synthase can also accept benzoyl-CoA as substrate.
