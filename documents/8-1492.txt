Andreas Wirth

Andreas Wirth was born 19 November 1984 in Heidelberg Germany, and currently resides near the famed Hockenheimring. From an early age Andreas proved himself to be a capable German racer.
In 2004 Wirth won the Formula BMW USA championship after coming state-side, and then advanced to the Champ Car Atlantics in 2005 where he raced for two years, winning three races and finishing 6th and 3rd in the championship. Following up a full 2006 season with Forsythe Championship Racing in the Champ Car Atlantics, Wirth was named to compete in his first Champ Car race in Dale Coyne Racing's #19 Sonny's BBQ entry at Surfer's Paradise, where he finished in 9th place. He then went on to race with Dale Coyne in Mexico City, and tested the new DP01 Champ Car in 2007. In 2008 he was called to test in the Superleague Formula 1 and also ran in the American Le Mans Series with PTG Panoz.
Since 2009 Andreas has been racing in Germany in the ADAC GT Masters Series. During 2009 & 2010 Andreas had the privilege of working with a team rich in racing heritage — BMW ALPINA 
 
 
 
  as they celebrated their return to motorsport in the FIA GT3 European Championship, the ADAC GT Masters and VLN Series and the 24h race of the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife. In 2011 Wirth joined HEICO Motorsport to put the all-new Mercedes-AMG SLS GT3 through its paces in the ADAC GT Masters Series and started the year with style in the 24hours of Dubai.
In 2012 Andreas joined Callaway Competition Corvette, sharing the cockpit of the FIA class-champion Z06R GT3 with; former Formula 1 stand-out Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 2012, touring car veteran Christian Hohenadel in 2013, and 2013 ADAC GT Masters Champion Daniel Keilwitz in 2014 & 2015.
Wirth starts for his seventh season in the ADAC GT Masters for 2015 with a current total of 9 victories and the record for driver with the most wins at the Nürburgring.
Career Highlights
2012 to 2015
• Andreas joined Callaway Competition in 2012 sharing the cockpit of the FIA class-champion Z06R GT3 Corvette with former Formula 1 stand-out Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and in 2013 with former FIA GT3 Champion Christian Hohenadel.
• In 2014 Wirth continued with Callaway, this time paired with 2013 ADAC GT Masters Champion Daniel Keilwitz. As was expected, 2014 proved to be a very exciting and successful year for the duo. Despite only competing in 10 of the 16 races (due to business obligations in the USA) Wirth finished the season with 4 wins, placing 6th in the overall standings. Wirth now tallies a total of 9 victories thus far in the ADAC GT Masters series and continues to maintain the record of GT Masters driver with the most wins at the Nürburgring. Topping off a successful 2014 season Wirth was invited to participate in the Blancpain GT3 World Final in Baku / Azerbaijan.
• 2015 marks Wirths seventh season in the ADAC GT Masters. Continuing this year with Callaway Competition Corvette for his fourth season, he shares the cockpit with 2013 ADAC GT Masters champion Daniel Keilwitz.
2011
• 2011 marked the beginning of a new chapter for Wirth as he joined HEICO Motorsport to put the all-new Mercedes-AMG SLS GT3 through its paces, showcasing it to the world. Thrilled to be working with a team steeped in motorsport history and a world-class manufacturer like Mercedes, he enjoyed an amazing season where he re-visited many familiar tracks competing for his 2nd full season in the ADAC GT Masters, FIA GT3 European Championship and the 24 hours of the Nürburgring. He kicked off this new chapter of his career at the 24 hours of Dubai—the chosen testing grounds for his new Mercedes gull-wing supercar.
2010
• In 2010 Andreas continued his work with ALPINA (and their new managing team S-Berg Racing of Austria) on the development of the BMW ALPINA B6 race car in the ADAC GT Masters series and the FIA GT3 European Championship.
2009
• The 2009 race season marked the beginning of a new journey for this young racer as he joined a team rich in racing heritage — BMW ALPINA, as they celebrated their return to motorsport in the FIA GT3 European Championship, the GT Masters and VLN Series and the 24h race of the famous Nürburgring Nordschleife. Andreas was proud to join the ranks of such legendary ALPINA drivers as Niki Lauda, Jacky Ickx, Hans Stuck and Dieter Quester.
2008
• In 2008 Andreas was called to test for Team Astromega in the Superleague Formula, and closed out his main stream racing efforts for the year in the American Le Mans Series with PTG Panoz competing in the Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta.
2007
• In 2007 Wirth was honoured to accept the Champ Car World Series invitation and challenge to break the standing lap record at TT Circuit Assen in The Netherlands as part of a promotion for Champ Car’s European debut late in August of that year. Despite the fact that Wirth hadn’t raced with the series all year, and the fact that he’d never set wheels on the Assen track, he proudly bettered the track record set by Jos Verstappen in the smaller, lighter A1GP car by more than four seconds (1:28.276).
 • Early in 2007 Andreas tested the new DP01 Champ Car with Dale Coyne Racing and was invited to explore a number of options with teams throughout a variety of racing series. Despite being sidelined in 2007 due to unreasonable budget demands Wirth continued building behind the scenes for a strong racing future.
2006
• In 2006 Andreas was extended the privilege to debut in the Champ Car World Series at Surfer’s Paradise Australia with Dale Coyne Racing where he proudly finished in ninth place on one of the most difficult tracks on the schedule. He then went on to compete in the Champ Car season finale at Mexico City finishing 15th in an event that presented many challenges for the young up and comer.
 • Led the season opener from wire-to-wire in his sophomore season in the Champ Car Atlantic Series to capture his second career win. Wirth’s third career victory represented the first time in fourteen years that a driver captured back-to-back wins in the opening two rounds of Atlantic competition.
 • Enjoyed a total of six trips to the podium in 2006 (two first place finishes and four third place finishes), and a total of eight top ten finishes in the 12 events on the calendar with Forsythe Championship Racing.
2005
• During his rookie year in the Toyota Atlantic Series, Andreas drove together in Brooks Associates Racing with Fernando Rees. He was second in the point standings going into the penultimate race, and was a serious contender for the Championship. However, due to an unfortunate accident he was forced to miss the final two events of the 2005 season. Despite missing the last two events, Andreas finished the season in a respectable 6th place.
 • Earned five 3rd place finishes, one 2nd place and one victory in his 2005 rookie season with the Toyota Atlantic Series.
2004
• Won the inaugural Formula BMW North American Championship in 2004.
 • Recorded podium finishes in 11 of 14 Formula BMW North American events in 2004 (never finishing lower than 5th place), including wins at Road America, Laguna Seca, and both events at Lime Rock.
2003
• Produced six top-five finishes in the 2003 German Formula BMW series, including a 2nd place finish in Italy.
2002
• Finished in the top 10 in all eight races in 2002 Formula BMW series, including a 2nd place finish at the Austrian Grand Prix and a 3rd place finish at Zandvoort in the Netherlands.
2001
• Finished second in the 2001 German Formula Ford Championship in his rookie year.
 • Earned two 10th-place finishes in Formula Ford including the event at Spa and the World Final at Brands Hatch in 2001.
