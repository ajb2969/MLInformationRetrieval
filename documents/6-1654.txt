Corrected speed

Corrected Speed is the speed a component would rotate at if the inlet temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at Sea Level, on a Standard Day (i.e. 288.15K).
Corrected Speed, 

, can be calculated as follows:



Corrected Speed is often abbreviated to 

 or 

 (for Referred Speed).
So-called Non-Dimensional Speed 

 is proportional to Corrected Speed:



Nomenclature:



 Stagnation (or Total) Temperature (in Kelvin)




 Real Shaft Speed




 Referred Temperature

In relative form, Corrected Speed, Referred Speed and Non-Dimensional Speed are all measures of peripheral Mach number.
