   Corrected speed      Corrected speed   Corrected Speed is the speed a component would rotate at if the inlet temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at Sea Level, on a Standard Day (i.e. 288.15K).  Corrected Speed,     N  /   θ       N    θ     N/{\sqrt{\theta}}    , can be calculated as follows:       N  /   θ    =   N  /    T  /  288.15           N    θ      N      T  288.15       N/\sqrt{\theta}=N/\sqrt{T/288.15}     Corrected Speed is often abbreviated to     N  c      N  c    Nc    or     N  r      N  r    Nr    (for Referred Speed).  So-called Non-Dimensional Speed     (   N  /   T    )      N    T     (N/\sqrt{T})    is proportional to Corrected Speed:       N  /   T    =    (   N  /   θ    )   /   288.15          N    T        N    θ      288.15      N/\sqrt{T}=(N/\sqrt{\theta})/\sqrt{288.15}     Nomenclature:      T   T   T    Stagnation (or Total) Temperature (in Kelvin)       N   N   N    Real Shaft Speed       θ   θ   {\theta}    Referred Temperature   In relative form, Corrected Speed, Referred Speed and Non-Dimensional Speed are all measures of peripheral Mach number.
