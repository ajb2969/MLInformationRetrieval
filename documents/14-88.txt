   Circuit (computer science)      Circuit (computer science)   In theoretical computer science , a circuit is a model of computation in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a function . Circuits of this kind provide a generalization of Boolean circuits and a mathematical model for digital logic circuits. Circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce. For example, the values in a Boolean circuit are boolean values, and the circuit includes conjunction , disjunction , and negation gates. The values in an integer circuit are sets of integers and the gates compute set union , set intersection , and set complement , as well as the arithmetic operations  addition and multiplication .  Formal definition  A circuit is a triple    (  M  ,  L  ,  G  )     M  L  G    (M,L,G)   , where      M   M   M   is a set of values,     L   L   L   is a set of gate labels, each of which is a function from    M  i     superscript  M  i    M^{i}   to   M   M   M   for some non-negative integer   i   i   i   (where   i   i   i   represents the number of inputs to the gate), and     G   G   G   is a labelled  directed acyclic graph with labels from   L   L   L   .   The vertices of the graph are called gates . For each gate   g   g   g   of in-degree    i   i   i   , the gate   g   g   g   can be labeled by an element   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   of   L   L   L   if and only if   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   is defined on    M  i     superscript  M  i    M^{i}   .  Terminology  The gates of in-degree 0 are called inputs or leaves . The gates of out-degree 0 are called outputs . If there is an edge from gate   g   g   g   to gate   h   h   h   in the graph   G   G   G   then   h   h   h   is called a child of   g   g   g   . We suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph, so we can speak of the   k   k   k   th child of a gate when   k   k   k   is less than the out-degree of the gate.  The size of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit. The depth of a gate    g   g   g   is the length of the longest path in   G   G   G   beginning at   g   g   g   up to an output gate. In particular, the gates of out-degree 0 are the only gates of depth 1. The depth of a circuit is the maximum depth of any gate.  Level   i   i   i    is the set of all gates of depth   i   i   i   . A levelled circuit is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth   i   i   i   comes only from gates of depth    i  +  1      i  1    i+1   or from the inputs. In other words, edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit. The width of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level.  Evaluation  The exact value    V   (  g  )       V  g    V(g)   of a gate   g   g   g   with in-degree   i   i   i   and label   l   l   l   is defined recursively for all gates   g   g   g   .       V   (  g  )    =   {     l     if  g  is an input        l   (   V   (   g  1   )    ,  …  ,   V   (   g  i   )    )      otherwise,            V  g    cases  l    if  g  is an input     l     V   subscript  g  1    normal-…    V   subscript  g  i      otherwise,     V(g)=\begin{cases}l&\text{if }g\text{ is an input}\\
 l(V(g_{1}),\ldots,V(g_{i}))&\text{otherwise,}\end{cases}   where each    g  j     subscript  g  j    g_{j}   is a parent of   g   g   g   .  The value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates.  Circuits as functions  The labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in   M   M   M   . If there are   n   n   n   leaves, then the circuit can be seen as a function from    M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   to   M   M   M   . It is then usual to consider a family of circuits     (   C  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  C  n     n  ℕ     (C_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   , a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit    C  n     subscript  C  n    C_{n}   has   n   n   n   variables. Families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from    M  *     superscript  M     M^{*}   to   M   M   M   .  The notions of size, depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions, becoming functions from   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   to   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   ; for example,    s  i  z  e   (  n  )       s  i  z  e  n    size(n)   is the size of the   n   n   n   th circuit of the family.  Complexity and algorithmic problems  Computing the output of a given Boolean circuit on a specific input is P-complete problem. If the input is an integer circuit , however, it is unknown whether this problem is decidable .  Circuit complexity attempts to classify Boolean functions with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them.
