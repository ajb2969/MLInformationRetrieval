   Ping-pong lemma      Ping-pong lemma   In mathematics , the ping-pong lemma , or table-tennis lemma , is any of several mathematical statements that ensure that several elements in a group acting on a set freely generates a free  subgroup of that group.  History  The ping-pong argument goes back to late 19th century and is commonly attributed 1 to Felix Klein who used it to study subgroups of Kleinian groups , that is, of discrete groups of isometries of the hyperbolic 3-space or, equivalently Möbius transformations of the Riemann sphere . The ping-pong lemma was a key tool used by Jacques Tits in his 1972 paper 2 containing the proof of a famous result now known as the Tits alternative . The result states that a finitely generated  linear group is either virtually  solvable or contains a free  subgroup of rank two. The ping-pong lemma and its variations are widely used in geometric topology and geometric group theory .  Modern versions of the ping-pong lemma can be found in many books such as Lyndon&Schupp;, 3 de la Harpe, 4 Bridson&Haefliger; 5 and others.  Formal statements  Ping-pong lemma for several subgroups  This version of the ping-pong lemma ensures that several subgroups of a group acting on a set generate a free product . The following statement appears in, 6 and the proof is from. 7  Let G be a group acting on a set X and let H 1 , H 2 ,...., H k be nontrivial subgroups of G where k ≥2, such that at least one of these subgroups has order greater than 2. Suppose there exist disjoint nonempty subsets X 1 , X 2 ,...., X k of X such that the following holds:   For any i ≠ s and for any h ∈ H i , h ≠1 we have h ( X s )⊆ X i .   Then        ⟨   H  1   ,  …  ,   H  k   ⟩   =    H  1   ∗  …  ∗   H  k     .        subscript  H  1   normal-…   subscript  H  k     normal-∗   subscript  H  1   normal-…   subscript  H  k      \langle H_{1},\dots,H_{k}\rangle=H_{1}\ast\dots\ast H_{k}.     Proof  By the definition of free product, it suffices to check that a given reduced word is nontrivial. Let w be such a word, and let       w  =    ∏   i  =  1   m    w    α  i   ,   β  i       .      w    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m    subscript  w    subscript  α  i    subscript  β  i        w=\prod_{i=1}^{m}w_{\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}}.     Where w s , β k ∈ H s for all such β k , and since w is fully reduced α i ≠ α i +1 for any i . We then let w act on an element of one of the sets X i . As we assume for at least one subgroup H i has order at least 3, without loss we may assume that H 1 is at least 3. We first make the assumption that α 1 and α m are both 1. From here we consider w acting on X 2 . We get the following chain of containments and note that since the X i are disjoint that w acts nontrivially and is thus not the identity element.       w   (   X  2   )    ⊆    ∏   i  =  1    m  -  1      w    α  i   ,   β  i      (   X  1   )     ⊆    ∏   i  =  1    m  -  2      w    α  i   ,   β  i      (   X   α   m  -  1     )     ⊆  …  ⊆    w   1  ,   β  1      w    α  2   ,   β  2      (   X   α  3    )    ⊆           w   subscript  X  2      superscript   subscript  product    i  1      m  1       subscript  w    subscript  α  i    subscript  β  i      subscript  X  1            superscript   subscript  product    i  1      m  2       subscript  w    subscript  α  i    subscript  β  i      subscript  X   subscript  α    m  1            normal-…          subscript  w   1   subscript  β  1      subscript  w    subscript  α  2    subscript  β  2      subscript  X   subscript  α  3          absent     w(X_{2})\subseteq\prod_{i=1}^{m-1}w_{\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}}(X_{1})\subseteq%
 \prod_{i=1}^{m-2}w_{\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}}(X_{\alpha_{m-1}})\subseteq\dots%
 \subseteq w_{1,\beta_{1}}w_{\alpha_{2},\beta_{2}}(X_{\alpha_{3}})\subseteq        ⊆    w   1  ,   β  1      (   X   α  2    )    ⊆   X  1         absent     subscript  w   1   subscript  β  1      subscript  X   subscript  α  2           subscript  X  1      \subseteq w_{1,\beta_{1}}(X_{\alpha_{2}})\subseteq X_{1}     To finish the proof we must consider the three cases:   If      α  1   =  1   ;    α  m   ≠  1      formulae-sequence     subscript  α  1   1      subscript  α  m   1     \alpha_{1}=1;\alpha_{m}\neq 1   , then let    h  ∈    H  1   ∖   {   w   1  ,   β  1     -  1    ,  1  }        h     subscript  H  1     superscript   subscript  w   1   subscript  β  1       1    1      h\in H_{1}\setminus\{w_{1,\beta_{1}}^{-1},1\}     If      α  1   ≠  1   ;    α  m   =  1      formulae-sequence     subscript  α  1   1      subscript  α  m   1     \alpha_{1}\neq 1;\alpha_{m}=1   , then let    h  ∈    H  1   ∖   {   w   1  ,   β  m     ,  1  }        h     subscript  H  1     subscript  w   1   subscript  β  m     1      h\in H_{1}\setminus\{w_{1,\beta_{m}},1\}     And if      α  1   ≠  1   ;    α  m   ≠  1      formulae-sequence     subscript  α  1   1      subscript  α  m   1     \alpha_{1}\neq 1;\alpha_{m}\neq 1   , then let    h  ∈    H  1   ∖   {  1  }        h     subscript  H  1    1      h\in H_{1}\setminus\{1\}      In each case, hwh −1 is a reduced word with α 1 ' and α m ' ' both 1, and thus is nontrivial. Finally, hwh −1 is not 1, and so neither is w . This proves the claim.  The Ping-pong lemma for cyclic subgroups  Let G be a group acting on a set X . Let a 1 ,..., a k be elements of G , where k ≥ 2. Suppose there exist disjoint nonempty subsets   X 1 + ,..., X k + and X 1 – ,..., X k –    of X with the following properties:   a i ( X − X i – ) ⊆ X i + for i = 1, ..., k ;    a i −1 ( X − X i + ) ⊆ X i – for i = 1, ..., k .   Then the subgroup H = 1, ..., a k > ≤ G  generated by a 1 , ..., a k is free with free basis { a 1 , ..., a k }.  Proof  This statement follows as a corollary of the version for general subgroups if we let X i = X i + ∪ X i − and let H i = ⟨ a i ⟩.  Examples  Special linear group example  One can use the ping-pong lemma to prove 8 that the subgroup H = ≤SL(2, Z ), generated by the matrices      A  =   (     1    2      0    1     )       A    1  2    0  1      \scriptstyle A=\begin{pmatrix}1&2\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}   and    B  =   (     1    0      2    1     )       B    1  0    2  1      \scriptstyle B=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
 2&1\end{pmatrix}     is free of rank two.  Proof  Indeed, let H 1 =  and H 2 =  be cyclic  subgroups of SL(2, Z ) generated by A and B accordingly. It is not hard to check that A and B are elements of infinite order in SL(2, Z ) and that       H  1   =   {   A  n   |   n  ∈  ℤ   }   =   {   (     1     2  n       0    1     )   :   n  ∈  ℤ   }          subscript  H  1    conditional-set   superscript  A  n     n  ℤ          conditional-set    1    2  n     0  1      n  ℤ       H_{1}=\{A^{n}|n\in\mathbb{Z}\}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}1&2n\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}:n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}     and        H  2   =   {   B  n   |   n  ∈  ℤ   }   =   {   (     1    0       2  n     1     )   :   n  ∈  ℤ   }    .         subscript  H  2    conditional-set   superscript  B  n     n  ℤ          conditional-set    1  0      2  n   1      n  ℤ       H_{2}=\{B^{n}|n\in\mathbb{Z}\}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
 2n&1\end{pmatrix}:n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}.     Consider the standard action of SL(2, Z ) on R 2 by linear transformations . Put       X  1   =   {    (     x      y     )   ∈   ℝ  2    :    |  x  |   >   |  y  |    }        subscript  X  1    conditional-set      x    y     superscript  ℝ  2        x     y       X_{1}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}x\\
 y\end{pmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:|x|>|y|\right\}     and        X  2   =   {    (     x      y     )   ∈   ℝ  2    :    |  x  |   <   |  y  |    }    .       subscript  X  2    conditional-set      x    y     superscript  ℝ  2        x     y       X_{2}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}x\\
 y\end{pmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:|x|<|y|\right\}.     It is not hard to check, using the above explicitly descriptions of H 1 and H 2 that for every nontrivial g ∈ H 1 we have g ( X 2 ) ⊆ X 1 and that for every nontrivial g ∈ H 2 we have g ( X 1 ) ⊆ X 2 . Using the alternative form of the ping-pong lemma, for two subgroups, given above, we conclude that H = H 1 ∗ H 2 . Since the groups H 1 and H 2 are infinite cyclic , it follows that H is a free group of rank two.  Word-hyperbolic group example  Let G be a word-hyperbolic group which is torsion-free , that is, with no nontrivial elements of finite order . Let g , h ∈ G be two non-commuting elements, that is such that gh ≠ hg . Then there exists M ≥1 such that for any integers n ≥ M , m ≥ M the subgroup H = n , h m > ≤ G is free of rank two.  Sketch of the proof 9  The group G  acts on its hyperbolic boundary ∂ G by homeomorphisms . It is known that if a ∈ G is a nontrivial element then a has exactly two distinct fixed points, a ∞ and a −∞ in ∂ G and that a ∞ is an attracting fixed point while a −∞ is a repelling fixed point .  Since g and h do not commute, the basic facts about word-hyperbolic groups imply that g ∞ , g −∞ , h ∞ and h −∞ are four distinct points in ∂ G . Take disjoint neighborhoods  U + , U – , V + and V – of g ∞ , g −∞ , h ∞ and h −∞ in ∂ G respectively. Then the attracting/repelling properties of the fixed points of g and h imply that there exists M ≥ 1 such that for any integers n ≥ M , m ≥ M we have:   g n (∂ G – U – ) ⊆ U +  g − n (∂ G – U + ) ⊆ U –  h m (∂ G – V – ) ⊆ V +  h − m (∂ G – V + ) ⊆ V –   The ping-pong lemma now implies that H = n , h m > ≤ G is free of rank two.  Applications of the ping-pong lemma   The ping-pong lemma is used in Kleinian groups to study their so-called Schottky subgroups . In the Kleinian groups context the ping-pong lemma can be used to show that a particular group of isometries of the hyperbolic 3-space is not just free but also properly discontinuous and geometrically finite .  Similar Schottky-type arguments are widely used in geometric group theory , particularly for subgroups of word-hyperbolic groups 10 and for automorphism groups of trees. 11  Ping-pong lemma is also used for studying Schottky-type subgroups of mapping class groups of Riemann surfaces , where the set on which the mapping class group acts is the Thurston boundary of the Teichmüller space .

There are generalizations of the ping-pong lemma that produce not just free products but also amalgamated free products and HNN extensions . 15 These generalizations are used, in particular, in the proof of Maskit's Combination Theorem for Kleinian groups .

VII.C and Ch. VII.E pp.149–156 and pp. 160–167   There are also versions of the ping-pong lemma which guarantee that several elements in a group generate a free semigroup . Such versions are available both in the general context of a group action on a set, 16 and for specific types of actions, e.g. in the context of linear groups , 17 groups acting on trees 18 and others. 19   References  See also   Free group  Free product  Kleinian group  Tits alternative  Word-hyperbolic group  Schottky group   "  Category:Algebra  Category:Group theory  Category:Discrete groups  Category:Lie groups  Category:Combinatorics on words      J.
