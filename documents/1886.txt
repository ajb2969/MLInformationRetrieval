   AKNS system      AKNS system   In mathematics , the AKNS system is an integrable system of partial differential equations , introduced by and named after .  Definition  The AKNS system is a pair of two partial differential equations for two complex-valued functions  p and q of 2 variables t and x :       p  t   =    +   i   p  2   q    -    i  2    p   x  x           subscript  p  t         i   superscript  p  2   q        i  2    subscript  p    x  x        p_{t}=+ip^{2}q-\frac{i}{2}p_{xx}          q  t   =    -   i   q  2   p    +    i  2    q   x  x           subscript  q  t         i   superscript  q  2   p        i  2    subscript  q    x  x        q_{t}=-iq^{2}p+\frac{i}{2}q_{xx}     If p and q are complex conjugates this reduces to the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation .
