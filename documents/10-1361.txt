   2,5-dihydroxypyridine 5,6-dioxygenase      2,5-dihydroxypyridine 5,6-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 2,5-dihydroxypyridine 5,6-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,5-dihydroxypyridine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-formylmaleamic acid   The 2 substrates of this enzyme are 2,5-dihydroxypyridine and O 2 , whereas its product is N-formylmaleamic acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . It employs one cofactor , iron .  This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,5-dihydroxypyridine:oxygen 5,6-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 2,5-dihydroxypyridine oxygenase , and pyridine-2,5-diol dioxygenase .
