   HD 28185      HD 28185   =100^{(M_{V_\odot}-M_{V_\ast})/5} | temperature = 5705 | age_gyr = 7.5 }} HD 28185 is a yellow dwarf  star similar to our Sun located about 138 light-years away from Earth in the constellation  Eridanus . The designation HD 28185 refers to its entry in the Henry Draper catalogue . The star is known to possess one long- period  extrasolar planet .  Distance and visibility  According to measurements from the Hipparcos  astrometric  satellite , HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds , 1 which corresponds to a distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years ). Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars . With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is not visible with the naked eye , though it can be seen using binoculars .  Stellar characteristics  HD 28185 is similar to our Sun in terms of mass , radius , and luminosity . The star is on the main sequence and is generating energy by fusing  hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than the Sun. Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the Sun, containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron . The star rotates slower than the Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the Sun.  Based on the star's chromospheric activity , HD 28185 is estimated to have an age of around 2,900 million years. On the other hand, evolutionary models give an age of around 7,500 million years and a mass 0.99 times that of our Sun. 2 The higher luminosity and longer rotation period favour an older age for the star.  Planetary system  In 2001 an extrasolar planet similar in size to Jupiter designated HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. 3 4 Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity . 5 The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth , which has led to speculations about the possibilities for habitable  moons . 6 7 In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. 8 The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008. 9  The star also shows evidence of a long-term radial velocity trend, which may indicate the presence of an additional outer companion. 10  See also   51 Pegasi  Iota Horologii   Notes    References  External links  "  Category:Eridanus (constellation)  Category:G-type main-sequence stars  028185  020723  Category:Planetary systems      ↩     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
