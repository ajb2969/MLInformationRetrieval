Log-space computable function

A log-space computable function is a function 
 
 
 
  that requires only 
 
 
 
  memory to be computed (this restriction does not apply to the size of the output). The computation is generally done by means of a log-space transducer.
Log-space reductions
The main use for log-space computable functions is in log-space reductions. This is a means of transforming an instance of one problem into an instance of another problem, using only logarithmic space.
Examples of log-space computable functions

Function converting a problem of a non-deterministic Turing machine that decides a language A in log-space to ST-connectivity.1
