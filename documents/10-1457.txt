Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate reductase

In enzymology, a Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-pipecolate + NADP+

 
  Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-pipecolate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-pipecolate:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 1,2-didehydropipecolate reductase, P2C reductase, and 1,2-didehydropipecolic reductase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation.
