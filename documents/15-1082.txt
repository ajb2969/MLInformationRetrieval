   Taurochenodeoxycholate 6α-hydroxylase      Taurochenodeoxycholate 6α-hydroxylase   Taurochenodeoxycholate 6alpha-hydroxylase (, CYP3A4 , CYP4A21 , taurochenodeoxycholate 6alpha-monooxygenase ) is an enzyme with system name taurochenodeoxycholate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6alpha-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) taurochenodeoxycholate + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   taurohyocholate + NADP + + H 2 O  (2) lithocholate + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hyodeoxycholate + NADP + + H 2 O   Taurochenodeoxycholate 6α-hydroxylase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
