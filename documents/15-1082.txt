Taurochenodeoxycholate 6α-hydroxylase

Taurochenodeoxycholate 6alpha-hydroxylase (, CYP3A4, CYP4A21, taurochenodeoxycholate 6alpha-monooxygenase) is an enzyme with system name taurochenodeoxycholate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6alpha-hydroxylating).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) taurochenodeoxycholate + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  taurohyocholate + NADP+ + H2O
 
(2) lithocholate + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  hyodeoxycholate + NADP+ + H2O
 

Taurochenodeoxycholate 6α-hydroxylase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
