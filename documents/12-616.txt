Inertia tensor of triangle

The inertia tensor

 
  of a triangle (like the inertia tensor of any body) can be expressed in terms of covariance 
 
 
 
  of the body:



where covariance is defined as area integral over the triangle:



Covariance for a triangle in three-dimensional space, assuming that mass is equally distributed over the surface with unit density, is



where



 
  represents 3 Ã— 3 matrix containing triangle vertex coordinates 
 
 
 
  in the rows,


 
  is twice the area of the triangle,


\mathbf{S}= \frac{1}{24} \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\ \end{bmatrix} 
Substitution of triangle covariance in definition of inertia tensor gives eventually



A proof of the formula
The proof given here follows the steps from the article.1
Covariance of a canonical triangle
Let's compute covariance of the right triangle with the vertices (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0).
Following the definition of covariance we receive









The rest components of 
 
 
 
  are zero because the triangle is in 
 
 
 
 .
As a result



Covariance of the triangle with a vertex in the origin
Consider a linear operator


 
  that maps the canonical triangle in the triangle 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . The first two columns of 
 
 
 
  contain 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively, while the third column is arbitrary. The target triangle is equal to the triangle in question (in particular their areas are equal), but shifted with its zero vertex in the origin.






Covariance of the triangle in question
The last thing remaining to be done is to conceive how covariance is changed with the translation of all points on vector 
 
 
 
 .



where



is the centroid of dashed triangle.
It's easy to check now that all coefficients in 
 
 
 
  before 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and before 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . This can be expressed in matrix form with 
 
 
 
  as above.
