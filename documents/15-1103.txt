Isoleucine N-monooxygenase

Isoleucine N-monooxygenase (, CYP79D3, CYP79D4) is an enzyme with system name L-isoleucine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-isoleucine + 2 O2 + 2 NADPH + 2 H+

 
  (E)-2-methylbutanal oxime + 2 NADP+ + CO2 + 3 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) L-isoleucine + O2 + NADPH + H+

 
  N-hydroxy-L-isoleucine + NADP+ + H2O
 
(1b) N-hydroxy-L-isoleucine + O2 + NADPH + H+ 
 
 
 
  N,N-dihydroxy-L-isoleucine + NADP+ + H2O
 
(1c) N,N-dihydroxy-L-isoleucine 
 
 
 
  (E)-2-methylbutanal oxime + CO2 + H2O (spontaneous reaction)
 

Isoleucine N-monooxygenase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
