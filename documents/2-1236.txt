   Security protocol notation      Security protocol notation   In cryptography , security (engineering) protocol notation , also known as protocol narrations 1 and Alice & Bob notation , is a way of expressing a protocol of correspondence between entities of a dynamic system, such as a computer network . In the context of a formal model , it allows reasoning about the properties of such a system.  The standard notation consists of a set of principals (traditionally named Alice, Bob , Charlie, and so on) who wish to communicate. They may have access to a server S, shared keys K, timestamps T, and can generate nonces N for authentication purposes.  A simple example might be the following:       A  →  B   :    {  X  }    K   A  ,  B        normal-:   normal-→  A  B    subscript   X    subscript  K   A  B       A\rightarrow B:\{X\}_{K_{A,B}}     This states that A lice intends a message for B ob consisting of a plaintext  X encrypted under shared key K A,B .  Another example might be the following:       B  →  A   :    {   N  B   }    K  A       normal-:   normal-→  B  A    subscript    subscript  N  B     subscript  K  A      B\rightarrow A:\{N_{B}\}_{K_{A}}     This states that B ob intends a message for A lice consisting of a n once  N B encrypted using public key of Alice.  A key with two subscripts, K A,B , is a symmetric key shared by the two corresponding individuals. A key with one subscript, K A , is the public key of the corresponding individual. A private key is represented as the inverse of the public key.  The notation specifies only the operation and not its semantics — for instance, private key encryption and signature are represented identically.  We can express more complicated protocols in such a fashion. See Kerberos as an example. Some sources refer to this notation as Kerberos Notation . {{ cite journal  | last=Chappell  | first=David  | year=1999  | title=Exploring Kerberos, the Protocol for Distributed Security in Windows 2000  | journal=Microsoft Systems Journal  | url = http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0899/kerberos/kerberos.aspx  }} Some authors consider the notation used by Steiner, Neuman, & Schiller 2 as a notable reference. 3  Several models exist to reason about security protocols in this way, one of which is BAN logic .
