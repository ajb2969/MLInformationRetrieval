Security protocol notation

In cryptography, security (engineering) protocol notation, also known as protocol narrations1 and Alice & Bob notation, is a way of expressing a protocol of correspondence between entities of a dynamic system, such as a computer network. In the context of a formal model, it allows reasoning about the properties of such a system.
The standard notation consists of a set of principals (traditionally named Alice, Bob, Charlie, and so on) who wish to communicate. They may have access to a server S, shared keys K, timestamps T, and can generate nonces N for authentication purposes.
A simple example might be the following:



This states that Alice intends a message for Bob consisting of a plaintext X encrypted under shared key KA,B.
Another example might be the following:



This states that Bob intends a message for Alice consisting of a nonce NB encrypted using public key of Alice.
A key with two subscripts, KA,B, is a symmetric key shared by the two corresponding individuals. A key with one subscript, KA, is the public key of the corresponding individual. A private key is represented as the inverse of the public key.
The notation specifies only the operation and not its semantics — for instance, private key encryption and signature are represented identically.
We can express more complicated protocols in such a fashion. See Kerberos as an example. Some sources refer to this notation as Kerberos Notation. {{ cite journal

}} Some authors consider the notation used by Steiner, Neuman, & Schiller2 as a notable reference. 3
Several models exist to reason about security protocols in this way, one of which is BAN logic.
