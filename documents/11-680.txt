   Aryl-acylamidase      Aryl-acylamidase   In enzymology , an aryl-acylamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an anilide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a carboxylate + aniline   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are anilide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are carboxylate and aniline .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aryl-acylamide amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include AAA-1 , AAA-2 , brain acetylcholinesterase (is associated with AAA-2) , and pseudocholinesterase (associated with arylacylamidase) .
