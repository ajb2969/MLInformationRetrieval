   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase      2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 5-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (4S)-4,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dioxohexanoate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (4S)-4,6-dihydroxy-2,5-dioxohexanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate:NAD + 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate 5-dehydrogenase , 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate dehydrogenase , 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , (phosphate)) dehydrogenase , 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate (3-deoxy-D-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonic , and acid) dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
