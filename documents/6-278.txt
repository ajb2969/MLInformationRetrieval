   Reduced product      Reduced product   In model theory , a branch of mathematical logic , and in algebra , the reduced product is a construction that generalizes both direct product and ultraproduct .  Let { S i | i ∈ I } be a family of structures of the same signature σ indexed by a set I , and let U be a filter on I . The domain of the reduced product is the quotient of the Cartesian product       ∏   i  ∈  I     S  i       subscript  product    i  I     subscript  S  i     \prod_{i\in I}S_{i}     by a certain equivalence relation ~: two elements ( a i ) and ( b i ) of the Cartesian product are equivalent if       {   i  ∈  I   :    a  i   =   b  i    }   ∈   U        conditional-set    i  I      subscript  a  i    subscript  b  i     U    \left\{i\in I:a_{i}=b_{i}\right\}\in U\,     If U only contains I as an element, the equivalence relation is trivial, and the reduced product is just the original Cartesian product. If U is an ultrafilter , the reduced product is an ultraproduct.  Operations from σ are interpreted on the reduced product by applying the operation pointwise. Relations are interpreted by      R   (   (   a  i  1   )   /  ∼  ,  …  ,   (   a  i  n   )   /  ∼  )   ⇔   {  i  ∈  I  ∣   R   S  i     (   a  i  1   ,  …  ,   a  i  n   )   }   ∈  U  .     fragments  R   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript  a  1   i   normal-)    similar-to  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript  a  n   i   normal-)    similar-to  normal-)   iff   fragments  normal-{  i   I  normal-∣   superscript  R   subscript  S  i     fragments  normal-(   subscript   superscript  a  1   i   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript   superscript  a  n   i   normal-)   normal-}    U  normal-.    R((a^{1}_{i})/{\sim},\dots,(a^{n}_{i})/{\sim})\iff\{i\in I\mid R^{S_{i}}(a^{1}%
 _{i},\dots,a^{n}_{i})\}\in U.\,     For example, if each structure is a vector space , then the reduced product is a vector space with addition defined as ( a + b ) i = a i + b i and multiplication by a scalar c as ( ca ) i = c a i .  References    , Chapter 6.   "  Category:Model theory
