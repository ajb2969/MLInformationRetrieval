   Dirichlet's approximation theorem      Dirichlet's approximation theorem   In number theory , Dirichlet's theorem on Diophantine approximation , also called Dirichlet's approximation theorem , states that for any real number α and any positive integer  N , there exists integers p and q such that 1 ≤ q ≤ N and       |    q  α   -  p   |   ≤   1   N  +  1              q  α   p      1    N  1      \left|q\alpha-p\right|\leq\frac{1}{N+1}     This is a fundamental result in Diophantine approximation , showing that any real number has a sequence of good rational approximations: in fact an immediate consequence is that for a given irrational α, the inequality       |   α  -   p  q    |   <   1   q  2            α    p  q       1   superscript  q  2      \left|\alpha-\frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{q^{2}}     is satisfied by infinitely many integers p and q . This corollary also shows that the Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem , a result in the other direction, provides essentially the tightest possible bound, in the sense that the limits on rational approximation of algebraic numbers cannot be improved by lowering the exponent 2 + ε beyond 2.  Simultaneous Version  The simultaneous version of the Dirichlet's approximation theorem states that given real numbers     α  1   ,  …  ,   α  d       subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  d     \alpha_{1},...,\alpha_{d}   and a natural number   N   N   N   then there are integers       p  1   ,  …  ,   p  d   ,  q   ∈   \Z    ,   1  ≤  q  ≤  N      formulae-sequence      subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  d   q   \Z       1  q       N      p_{1},...,p_{d},q\in\Z,1\leq q\leq N   such that      |    α  i   -    p  i   q    |   ≤   1   q   N   1  /  d       .           subscript  α  i      subscript  p  i   q       1    q   superscript  N    1  d        \left|\alpha_{i}-\frac{p_{i}}{q}\right|\leq\frac{1}{qN^{1/d}}.     Method of proof  This theorem is a consequence of the pigeonhole principle . Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet who proved the result used the same principle in other contexts (for example, the Pell equation ) and by naming the principle (in German) popularized its use, though its status in textbook terms comes later. 1 The method extends to simultaneous approximation. 2  Another simple proof of the Dirichlet's approximation theorem is based on Minkowski's Theorem applied to the set    S  =   {   (  x  ,  y  )   ∈    \R   2   ;  -  N  -   1  2   ≤  x  ≤  N  +   1  2   ,  |  α  x  -  y  |  ≤   1  N   }      fragments  S    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  y  normal-)     superscript  \R  2   normal-;   N     1  2    x   N     1  2   normal-,  normal-|  α  x   y  normal-|     1  N   normal-}     S=\{(x,y)\in\R^{2};-N-\frac{1}{2}\leq x\leq N+\frac{1}{2},|\alpha x-y|\leq%
 \frac{1}{N}\}   . Since the volume of   S   S   S   is greater than   4   4   4   , Minkowski's Theorem establishes the existence of a non-trivial point with integral coordinates. This proof extends naturally to simultaneous approximations by considering the set    S  =   {   (  x  ,   y  1   ,  …  ,   y  d   )   ∈    \R    1  +  d    ;  -  N  -   1  2   ≤  x  ≤  N  +   1  2   ,  |   α  i   x  -   y  i   |  ≤   1   N   1  /  d     }      fragments  S    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,   subscript  y  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  y  d   normal-)     superscript  \R    1  d    normal-;   N     1  2    x   N     1  2   normal-,  normal-|   subscript  α  i   x    subscript  y  i   normal-|     1   superscript  N    1  d     normal-}     S=\{(x,y_{1},\dots,y_{d})\in\R^{1+d};-N-\frac{1}{2}\leq x\leq N+\frac{1}{2},|%
