   Glycine reductase      Glycine reductase   In enzymology , a glycine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl phosphate + NH 3 + thioredoxin disulfide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycine + phosphate + thioredoxin   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl phosphate , NH 3 , thioredoxin disulfide , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are glycine , phosphate , and thioredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific, those acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-phosphate ammonia:thioredoxin disulfide oxidoreductase (glycine-forming) .
