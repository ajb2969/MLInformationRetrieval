Goodpasture-antigen-binding protein kinase

In enzymology, a Goodpasture-antigen-binding protein kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + Goodpasture antigen-binding protein

 
  ADP + [Goodpasture antigen-binding phosphoprotein]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and Goodpasture antigen-binding protein, whereas its two products are ADP and Goodpasture antigen-binding phosphoprotein.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins (protein-serine/threonine kinases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[Goodpasture antigen-binding protein] phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include GPBPK, GPBP kinase, STK11, and Goodpasture antigen-binding protein kinase. This enzyme participates in mtor signaling pathway and adipocytokine signaling pathway.
