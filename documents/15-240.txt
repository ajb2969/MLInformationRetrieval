K-graph C*-algebra

In mathematics, a k-graph (or higher-rank graph, graph of rank k) is a countable category

 
  with domain and codomain maps 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , together with a functor

 
  which satisfies the following factorisation property: if 
 
 
 
  then there are unique 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Background
The finite graph theory in a directed graph form a mathematics category under concatenation called the free object category (which is generated by a graph). The length of a path in 
 
 
 
  gives a functor from this category into the natural numbers

 
 . A k-graph is a natural generalisation of this concept which was introduced in 2000 by Alex Kumjian and David Pask.1
Examples

It can be shown that a 1-graph is precisely the path category of a directed graph.
The category 
 
 
 
  consisting of a single object and k commuting morphisms 
 
 
 
 , together with the map 
 
 
 
  defined 
 
 
 
 , is a k-graph.
Let 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is a k-graph when gifted with the structure maps 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

Notation
The notation for k-graphs is borrowed extensively from the corresponding notation for categories:

For 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
 .
By the factorisation property it follows that 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is said to be row-finite with no sources.

Visualisation - Skeletons
A k-graph is best visualised by drawing its 1-skeleton as a k-coloured graph

 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  inherited from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the canonical generators for 
 
 
 
 . The factorisation property in 
 
 
 
  for elements of degree 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  gives rise to relations between the edges of 
 
 
 
 .
C*-algebra
As with graph-algebras one may associate a C*-algebra to a k=graph:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a row-finite k-graph with no sources then a Cuntz–Krieger 
 
 
 
  family in a C*-algebra B is a collection 
 
 
 
  of operators in B such that



 
  if 
 
 
 
 ;


 
  are mutually orthogonal projections;
if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 ;


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .



 
  is then the universal C*-algebra generated by a Cuntz–Krieger 
 
 
 
 -family.
