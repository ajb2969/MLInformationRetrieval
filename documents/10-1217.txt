   Hydroxyphytanate oxidase      Hydroxyphytanate oxidase   In enzymology , a hydroxyphytanate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-2-hydroxyphytanate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxophytanate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-2-hydroxyphytanate and O 2 , whereas its two products are 2-oxophytanate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2-hydroxyphytanate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called L-2-hydroxyphytanate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase .
