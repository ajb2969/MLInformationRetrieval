(Methyl-Co(III) methanol-specific corrinoid protein):coenzyme M methyltransferase

(Methyl-Co(III) methanol-specific corrinoid protein):coenzyme M methyltransferase (, methyltransferase 2, mtaA (gene)) is an enzyme with system name methylated methanol-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[methyl-Co(III) methanol-specific corrinoid protein] + coenzyme M

methyl-CoM + [Co(I) methanol-specific corrinoid protein]
 

Free methylcob(I)alamin can substitute for the corrinoid protein in vitro.
