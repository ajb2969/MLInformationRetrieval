Centre (category)

Let 
 
 
 
  be a (strict) monoidal category. The centre of 
 
 
, denoted 
 
 
 
 , is the category whose objects are pairs (A,u) consisting of an object A of 
 
 
 
  and a natural isomorphism

 
  satisfying



and


 
  (this is actually a consequence of the first axiom).
An arrow from (A,u) to (B,v) in 
 
 
 
  consists of an arrow 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that

The category 
 
 
 
  becomes a braided monoidal category with the tensor product on objects defined as



where
