Spherical cap

(Figure)
The spherical cap is the purple section.

In geometry, a spherical cap or spherical dome is a portion of a sphere cut off by a plane. If the plane passes through the center of the sphere, so that the height of the cap is equal to the radius of the sphere, the spherical cap is called a hemisphere.
Volume and surface area
If the radius of the base of the cap is 
 
 
 
 , and the height of the cap is 
 
 
 
 , then the volume of the spherical cap is1



and the curved surface area of the spherical cap is2



The relationship between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is irrelevant as long as 0 ≤ 
 
 
 
  ≤ 
 
 
 
 . The blue section of the illustration is also a spherical cap.
The parameters 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not independent:


 
 ,


 
 .
Substituting this into the area formula gives:


 
 .
Note also that in the upper hemisphere of the diagram, 
 
 
 
 , and in the lower hemisphere 
 
 
 
 ; hence in either hemisphere 
 
 
 
  and so an alternative expression for the volume is


 
 .
Application
The volume of all points which are in at least one of two intersecting spheres of radii  and  is 3


 
 ,
where



is the total of the two isolated spheres, and



the sum of the two spherical caps of the intersection. If  is the distance between the two sphere centers, elimination of the variables  and  leads to4 5

Generalizations
Sections of other solids
The spheroidal dome is obtained by sectioning off a portion of a spheroid so that the resulting dome is circularly symmetric (having an axis of rotation), and likewise the ellipsoidal dome is derived from the ellipsoid.
Hyperspherical cap
Generally, the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional volume of a hyperspherical cap of height 
 
 
 
  and radius 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space is given by 6


 
  where 
 
 
 
  (the gamma function) is given by 
 
 
 
 .
The formula for 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in terms of the volume of the unit n-ball

 
  and the hypergeometric function

 
  or the regularized incomplete beta function

 
  as


 
  ,
and the area formula 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in terms of the area of the unit n-ball

 
  as


 
  , where

Earlier in 7 (1986, USSR Academ. Press) the formulas were received:

For odd

It is shown in 8 that, if
