   Sunflower (mathematics)      Sunflower (mathematics)   In mathematics, a sunflower or Δ system is a collection of sets whose pairwise intersection is constant, and called the kernel .  The Δ lemma , sunflower lemma , and sunflower conjecture give various conditions that imply the existence of a large sunflower in a given collection of sets.  The original term for this concept was "Δ-system". More recently the term "sunflower", possibly introduced by , has been gradually replacing it.  Formal definition  Suppose U is a universe set and W is a collection of subsets of U . The collection W is a sunflower (or Δ-system ) if there is a subset S of U such that for each distinct  A and B in W , we have A ∩ B = S . In other words, W is a sunflower if the pairwise intersection of each set in W is constant.  Δ lemma  The Δ lemma states that every uncountable collection of finite sets contains an uncountable Δ-system.  The Δ lemma is a combinatorial set-theoretic tool used in proofs to impose an upper bound on the size of a collection of pairwise incompatible elements in a forcing  poset . It may for example be used as one of the ingredients in a proof showing that it is consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory that the continuum hypothesis does not hold. It was introduced by .  Δ lemma for    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}     If   W   W   W   is an    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   -sized collection of countable subsets of    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   , and if the continuum hypothesis holds, then there is an    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   -sized Δ-subsystem. Let    ⟨   A  α   :  α  <   ω  2   ⟩     fragments  normal-⟨   subscript  A  α   normal-:  α    subscript  ω  2   normal-⟩    \langle A_{\alpha}:\alpha<\omega_{2}\rangle   enumerate   W   W   W   . For     cf   (  α  )    =   ω  1         cf  α    subscript  ω  1     {\rm cf}(\alpha)=\omega_{1}   , let     f   (  α  )    =   sup   (    A  α   ∩  α   )          f  α     sup     subscript  A  α   α      f(\alpha)={\rm sup}(A_{\alpha}\cap\alpha)   . By Fodor's lemma, fix   S   S   S   stationary in    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   such that   f   f   f   is constantly equal to   β   β   \beta   on   S   S   S   . Build     S  ′   ⊆  S       superscript  S  normal-′   S    S^{\prime}\subseteq S   of cardinality    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   such that whenever     A  i   ⊆  j       subscript  A  i   j    A_{i}\subseteq j   then    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   . Using the continuum hypothesis, there are only   β   β   \beta   -many countable subsets of $\beta$ , so by further thinning we may stabilize the kernel.  Sunflower lemma and conjecture  proved the sunflower lemma , stating that if a and b are positive integers then a collection of b ! a b +1 sets of cardinality at most b contains a sunflower with more than a sets. The sunflower conjecture is one of several variations of the conjecture of  that the factor of b ! can be replaced by C b for some constant C .
