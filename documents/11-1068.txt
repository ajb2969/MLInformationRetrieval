   Aromatic-amino-acid transaminase      Aromatic-amino-acid transaminase   In enzymology , an aromatic-amino-acid transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aromatic amino acid + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   an aromatic oxo acid + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are aromatic amino acid and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are aromatic oxo acid and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aromatic-amino-acid:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include aromatic amino acid aminotransferase , aromatic aminotransferase , and ArAT . This enzyme participates in 6 metabolic pathways : methionine metabolism , tyrosine metabolism , phenylalanine metabolism , phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis , novobiocin biosynthesis , and alkaloid biosynthesis i . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 13 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
