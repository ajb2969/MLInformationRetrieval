Dershowitz–Manna ordering

In mathematics, the Dershowitz–Manna ordering is a well-founded ordering on multisets named after Nachum Dershowitz and Zohar Manna. It is often used in context of termination of programs or term rewriting systems.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a partial order, and let 
 
 
 
  be the set of all finite multisets on 
 
 
 
 . For multisets 
 
 
 
  we define the Dershowitz–Manna ordering 
 
 
 
  as follows:


 
  whenever there exist two multisets 
 
 
 
  with the following properties:



 
 ,


 
 ,


 
 , and


 
  dominates 
 
 
 
 , that is, for all 
 
 
 
 , there is some 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

An equivalent definition was given by Huet and Oppen as follows:


 
  if and only if



 
 , and
for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  then there is some 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
