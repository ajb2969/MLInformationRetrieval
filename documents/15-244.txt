Champernowne distribution

In statistics, the Champernowne distribution is a symmetric, continuous probability distribution, describing random variables that take both positive and negative values. It is a generalization of the logistic distribution that was introduced by D. G. Champernowne.123 Champernowne developed the distribution to describe the logarithm of income.4
Definition
The Champernowne distribution has a probability density function given by



where 
 
 
 
  are positive parameters, and n is the normalizing constant, which depends on the parameters. The density may be rewritten as



using the fact that 
 
 

Properties
The density f(y) defines a symmetric distribution with median y0, which has tails somewhat heavier than a normal distribution.
Special cases
In the special case 
 
 
 
  it is the Burr Type XII density.
When 
 
 
 
 ,



which is the density of the standard logistic distribution.
Distribution of income
If the distribution of Y, the logarithm of income, has a Champernowne distribution, then the density function of the income X = exp(Y) is5



where x0 = exp(y0) is the median income. If λ = 1, this distribution is often called the Fisk distribution,6 which has density
