   Beta Apodis      Beta Apodis   Beta Apodis (β Aps, β Apodis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Apus . It is located approximately  from Earth, 1 as determined by parallax measurements. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +4.24, 2 which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye  The spectrum of this star matches the characteristics of a K0 III, 3 which, according to models of stellar evolution , indicates that it is in the giant star stage, having exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. The measured angular diameter of this star is . 4 At the estimated distance of this star, this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the Sun . 5 The expanded outer atmosphere of Beta Apodis has an effective temperature of about 4,900 K. 6 This heat is causing it to glow with the characteristic orange hue of a K-type star . 7  Naming  In Chinese caused by adaptation of the European southern hemisphere constellations into the Chinese system,  (), meaning Exotic Bird , refers to an asterism consisting of β Apodis, ζ Apodis , ι Apodis , γ Apodis , δ Octantis , δ 1 Apodis , η Apodis , α Apodis and ε Apodis . Consequently, β Apodis itself is known as  (, .) 8  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 22\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align}  }}  External links   [ http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=16+43+04.6563-77+31+02.765&ident; ;=NLTT+43255&submit;=Aladin+previewer Image Beta Apodis]   "  149324  Apodis, Beta  Category:Apus (constellation)  Category:K-type giants             AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 29 日 ↩
