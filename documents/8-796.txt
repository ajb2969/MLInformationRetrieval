   Charge-carrier density      Charge-carrier density   Charge-carrier density denotes the number of charge carriers per volume . It is measured in m −3 . As any density it can depend on position. It should not be confused with the charge density , which is the number of charges per volume at a given energy.  The carrier density is obtained by integrating the charge density over the energy that the charges are allowed to have.  Charge-carrier density is a particle density , so integrating it over a volume   V   V   V   gives the number of charge carriers   N   N   N   in that volume      N  =    ∫  V    n   (  𝐫  )   d  V        N    subscript   V     n  𝐫  normal-d  V      N=\int_{V}n(\mathbf{r})\,\mathrm{d}V   .  where      n   (  𝐫  )       n  𝐫    n(\mathbf{r})   is the position-dependent charge-carrier density.  If the density does not depend on position and is instead equal to a constant    n  0     subscript  n  0    n_{0}   this equation simplifies to      N  =   V  ⋅   n  0        N   normal-⋅  V   subscript  n  0      N=V\cdot n_{0}   .  Charge-carrier densities involve equations concerning the electrical conductivity and related phenomena like the thermal conductivity .  Measurement  The density of charge carriers can be determined in many cases using the Hall effect , the voltage of which depends inversely on the density.  Such measurements show that the density for silver is around 1.070·10 28 m −3 or around 17,763 moles/m^3.  "  Category:Density  Category:Charge carriers
