Chamfer (geometry)

  In geometry, chamfering or edge-truncation is a Conway polyhedron notation operation that modifies one polyhedron into another. It is similar to expansion, moving faces apart and outward, but also maintain the original vertices. For polyhedra, this operation adds new hexagonal faces in place of each original edges.
A polyhedron with e edges will have it chamfered form containing 2e new vertices, 3e new edges, and e new hexagonal faces.

Relation to Goldberg polyhedra
The chamfer operation applied in series creates progressively larger polyhedra with new hexagonal faces replacing edges from the previous one. The chamfer operator transforms G(m,n) to G(2m,2n).
A regular polyhedron, G(1,0), create a Goldberg polyhedra sequence: G(1,0), G(2,0), G(4,0), G(8,0), G(16,0)...

Chamfered polytopes and honeycombs
Like the expansion operation, chamfer can be applied to any dimension. For polygons, it triples the number of vertices. For polychora, new cells are created around the original edges, The cells are prisms, containing two copies of the original face, with pyramids augmented onto the prism sides.

Properties



The chamfered tetrahedron (or alternate truncated cube) is a convex polyhedron constructed as an alternately truncated cube or chamfer operation on a tetrahedron, replacing its 6 edges with hexagons.
It is the Goldberg polyhedron GIII(2,0), containing triangular and hexagonal faces.
It can look a little like a truncated tetrahedron, , which has 4 hexagonal and 4 triangular faces, which is the related Goldberg polyhedron: GIII(1,1).

In geometry, the chamfered cube (also called truncated rhombic dodecahedron) is a convex polyhedron constructed from the rhombic dodecahedron by truncating the 6 (order 4) vertices.
The 6 vertices are truncated such that all edges are equal length. The original 12 rhombic faces become flattened hexagons, and the truncated vertices become squares.
The hexagonal faces are equilateral but not regular. They are formed by a truncated rhombus, have 2 internal angles of about 109.47 degrees (
 
 
 
 ) and 4 internal angles of about 125.26 degrees, while a regular hexagon would have all 120 degree angles.
Because all its faces have an even number of sides with 180 degree rotation symmetry, it is a zonohedron. It is also the Goldberg polyhedron GIV(2,0), containing square and hexagonal faces.
Coordinates
The chamfered cube is the Minkowski sum of a rhombic dodecahedron and a cube of side length 1 when eight vertices of the rhombic dodecahedron are at 
 
 
 
  and its six vertices are at the permutations of 
 
 
 
 .
This polyhedron looks similar to the uniform truncated octahedron:

The chamfered dodecahedron (also called truncated rhombic triacontahedron) is a convex polyhedron constructed as a truncation of the rhombic triacontahedron. It can more accurately be called a pentatruncated rhombic triacontahedron because only the order-5 vertices are truncated.
These 12 order-5 vertices can be truncated such that all edges are equal length. The original 30 rhombic faces become non-regular hexagons, and the truncated vertices become regular pentagons.
The hexagon faces can be equilateral but not regular with D2 symmetry. The angles at the two vertices with vertex configuration 6.6.6 are arccos(-1/sqrt(5)) = 116.565 degrees, and at the remaining four vertices with 5.6.6, they are 121.717 degrees each.
It is the Goldberg polyhedron GV(2,0), containing pentagonal and hexagonal faces.
This polyhedron looks very similar to the uniform truncated icosahedron which has 12 pentagons, but only 20 hexagons.

It also represents the exterior envelope of a cell-centered orthogonal projection of the 120-cell, one of six (convex regular 4-polytopes).
Chemistry
This is the shape of the fullerene C60; sometimes this shape is denoted C60(Ih) to describe its icosahedral symmetry and distinguish it from other less-symmetric 60-vertex fullerenes. It is one of only four fullerenes found by  to have a skeleton that can be isometrically embeddable into an L1 space.
