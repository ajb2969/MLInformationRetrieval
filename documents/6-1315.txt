   Temperley–Lieb algebra      Temperley–Lieb algebra   In statistical mechanics , the Temperley–Lieb algebra is an algebra from which are built certain transfer matrices , invented by Neville Temperley and Elliott Lieb . It is also related to integrable models , knot theory and the braid group , quantum groups and subfactors of von Neumann algebras .  Definition  Let   R   R   R   be a commutative ring and fix    δ  ∈  R      δ  R    \delta\in R   . The Temperley–Lieb algebra    T   L  n    (  δ  )       T   subscript  L  n   δ    TL_{n}(\delta)   is the    R   R   R   -algebra generated by the elements     U  1   ,   U  2   ,  …  ,   U   n  -  1        subscript  U  1    subscript  U  2   normal-…   subscript  U    n  1      U_{1},U_{2},\ldots,U_{n-1}   , subject to the Jones relations:        U  i  2   =   δ   U  i         superscript   subscript  U  i   2     δ   subscript  U  i      U_{i}^{2}=\delta U_{i}   for all    1  ≤  i  ≤   n  -  1         1  i         n  1      1\leq i\leq n-1           U  i    U   i  +  1     U  i    =   U  i          subscript  U  i    subscript  U    i  1     subscript  U  i     subscript  U  i     U_{i}U_{i+1}U_{i}=U_{i}   for all    1  ≤  i  ≤   n  -  2         1  i         n  2      1\leq i\leq n-2           U  i    U   i  -  1     U  i    =   U  i          subscript  U  i    subscript  U    i  1     subscript  U  i     subscript  U  i     U_{i}U_{i-1}U_{i}=U_{i}   for all    2  ≤  i  ≤   n  -  1         2  i         n  1      2\leq i\leq n-1           U  i    U  j    =    U  j    U  i           subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j       subscript  U  j    subscript  U  i      U_{i}U_{j}=U_{j}U_{i}   for all     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤   n  -  1       formulae-sequence    1  i     j    n  1      1\leq i,j\leq n-1   such that     |   i  -  j   |   ≠  1          i  j    1    |i-j|\neq 1          T   L  n    (  δ  )       T   subscript  L  n   δ    TL_{n}(\delta)   may be represented diagrammatically as the vector space over noncrossing pairings on a rectangle with n points on two opposite sides. The five basis elements of    T   L  3    (  δ  )       T   subscript  L  3   δ    TL_{3}(\delta)   are the following:  .  Multiplication on basis elements can be performed by placing two rectangles side by side, and replacing any closed loops by a factor of δ , for example:  ×  =  = δ .  The identity element is the diagram in which each point is connected to the one directly across the rectangle from it, and the generator    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is the diagram in which the i th point is connected to the i+1 th point, the 2n − i + 1 th point is connected to the 2n − i th point, and all other points are connected to the point directly across the rectangle. The generators of    T   L  5    (  δ  )       T   subscript  L  5   δ    TL_{5}(\delta)   are:  (Figure)  Generators of the Temperley–Lieb algebra    T   L  5    (  δ  )       T   subscript  L  5   δ    TL_{5}(\delta)      From left to right, the unit 1 and the generators U 1 , U 2 , U 3 , U 4 .  The Jones relations can be seen graphically:  = δ  =  =  The Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian  Consider an interaction-round-a-face model e.g. a square lattice model and let   L   L   L   be the number of sites on the lattice. Following Temperley and Lieb 1 we define the Temperley-Lieb hamiltonian (the TL hamiltonian) as      ℋ  =    ∑   j  =  1    L  -  1     (   1  -   e  j    )        ℋ    superscript   subscript     j  1      L  1      1   subscript  e  j       \mathcal{H}=\sum_{j=1}^{L-1}(1-e_{j})     where     e  j   =    U   (  λ  )    /   sin  λ         subscript  e  j       U  λ     λ      e_{j}=U(\lambda)/\sin\lambda   , for some spectral parameter    λ  ∈  R      λ  R    \lambda\in R   .  Applications  We will firstly consider the case    L  =  3      L  3    L=3   . The TL hamiltonian is    ℋ  =   2  -   e  1   -   e  2        ℋ    2   subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2      \mathcal{H}=2-e_{1}-e_{2}   , namely     ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   = 2  -  - .  We have two possible states,  and .  In acting by   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   on these states, we find     ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   = 2  -  -  =  - ,  and     ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   = 2  -  -  = -  + .  Writing   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   as a matrix in the basis of possible states we have,      ℋ  =   (     1     -  1        -  1     1     )       ℋ    1    1       1   1      \mathcal{H}=\left(\begin{array}[]{rr}1&-1\\
 -1&1\end{array}\right)     The eigenvector of   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   with the lowest  eigenvalue is known as the ground state . In this case, the lowest eigenvalue    λ  0     subscript  λ  0    \lambda_{0}   for   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   is     λ  0   =  0       subscript  λ  0   0    \lambda_{0}=0   . The corresponding eigenvector is     ψ  0   =   (  1  ,  1  )        subscript  ψ  0    1  1     \psi_{0}=(1,1)   . As we vary the number of sites   L   L   L   we find the following table 2         L   L   L          ψ  0     subscript  ψ  0    \psi_{0}         L   L   L          ψ  0     subscript  ψ  0    \psi_{0}          2   (1)   3   (1, 1)     4   (2, 1)   5       (   3  3   ,   1  2   )      subscript  3  3    subscript  1  2     (3_{3},1_{2})        6       (  11  ,   5  2   ,  4  ,  1  )     11   subscript  5  2   4  1    (11,5_{2},4,1)      7       (   26  4   ,   10  2   ,   9  2   ,   8  2   ,   5  2   ,   1  2   )      subscript  26  4    subscript  10  2    subscript  9  2    subscript  8  2    subscript  5  2    subscript  1  2     (26_{4},10_{2},9_{2},8_{2},5_{2},1_{2})        8       (  170  ,   75  2   ,  71  ,   56  2   ,  50  ,  30  ,   14  4   ,  6  ,  1  )     170   subscript  75  2   71   subscript  56  2   50  30   subscript  14  4   6  1    (170,75_{2},71,56_{2},50,30,14_{4},6,1)      9       (  646  ,  …  )     646  normal-…    (646,\ldots)           ⋮   normal-⋮   \vdots         ⋮   normal-⋮   \vdots         ⋮   normal-⋮   \vdots         ⋮   normal-⋮   \vdots          where we have use the notation     m  n   =   (  m  ,  …  ,  m  )        subscript  m  n    m  normal-…  m     m_{n}=(m,\ldots,m)      n   n   n   -times i.e.     5  2   =   (  5  ,  5  )        subscript  5  2    5  5     5_{2}=(5,5)   .  Combinatorial Properties  An interesting observation is that the largest components of the ground state of   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   have a combinatorial enumeration as we vary the number of sites, 3 as was first observed by Murray Batchelor , Jan de Gier and Bernard Nienhuis. 4 Using the resources of the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences , Batchelor et al. found, for an even numbers of sites       1  ,  2  ,  11  ,  170  ,  …   =    ∏   j  =  0    n  -  1      (    3  j   +  1   )       (   2  j   )   !     (   6  j   )   !       (   4  j   )   !     (    4  j   +  1   )   !            1  2  11  170  normal-…     superscript   subscript  product    j  0      n  1          3  j   1           2  j        6  j           4  j          4  j   1          1,2,11,170,\ldots=\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\left(3j+1\right)\frac{(2j)!(6j)!}{(4j)!(4j%
 +1)!}     and for an odd numbers of sites        1  ,  3  ,  26  ,  646  ,  …   =    ∏   j  =  0    n  -  1      (    3  j   +  2   )       (    2  j   +  2   )   !     (    6  j   +  3   )   !       (    4  j   +  2   )   !     (    4  j   +  3   )   !        .       1  3  26  646  normal-…     superscript   subscript  product    j  0      n  1          3  j   2             2  j   2          6  j   3             4  j   2          4  j   3          1,3,26,646,\ldots=\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}(3j+2)\frac{(2j+2)!(6j+3)!}{(4j+2)!(4j+3)!}.     Surprisingly, these sequences corresponded to well known combinatorial objects. For   L   L   L   even, this sequence corresponded to cyclically symmetric transpose complement plane partitions and for   L   L   L   odd these corresponded to     (    2  n   +  1   )   ×   (    2  n   +  1   )           2  n   1       2  n   1     (2n+1)\times(2n+1)    alternating sign matrices symmetric about the vertical axis.
