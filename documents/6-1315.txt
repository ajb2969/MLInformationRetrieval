Temperley–Lieb algebra

In statistical mechanics, the Temperley–Lieb algebra is an algebra from which are built certain transfer matrices, invented by Neville Temperley and Elliott Lieb. It is also related to integrable models, knot theory and the braid group, quantum groups and subfactors of von Neumann algebras.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a commutative ring and fix 
 
 
 
 . The Temperley–Lieb algebra 
 
 
 
  is the 

 
 -algebra generated by the elements 
 
 
 
 , subject to the Jones relations:

  for all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 




 
  may be represented diagrammatically as the vector space over noncrossing pairings on a rectangle with n points on two opposite sides. The five basis elements of 
 
 
 
  are the following:
.
Multiplication on basis elements can be performed by placing two rectangles side by side, and replacing any closed loops by a factor of δ, for example:
 ×  =  = δ .
The identity element is the diagram in which each point is connected to the one directly across the rectangle from it, and the generator 
 
 
 
  is the diagram in which the ith point is connected to the i+1th point, the 2n − i + 1th point is connected to the 2n − ith point, and all other points are connected to the point directly across the rectangle. The generators of 
 
 
 
  are:

The Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian
Consider an interaction-round-a-face model e.g. a square lattice model and let 
 
 
 
  be the number of sites on the lattice. Following Temperley and Lieb1 we define the Temperley-Lieb hamiltonian (the TL hamiltonian) as



where 
 
 
 
 , for some spectral parameter 
 
 
 
 .
Applications
We will firstly consider the case 
 
 
 
 . The TL hamiltonian is 
 
 
 
 , namely


 
  = 2  -  - .
We have two possible states,
 and .
In acting by 
 
 
 
  on these states, we find


 
   = 2  -  -  =  - ,
and


 
   = 2  -  -  = -  + .
Writing 
 
 
 
  as a matrix in the basis of possible states we have,



The eigenvector of 
 
 
 
  with the lowest eigenvalue is known as the ground state. In this case, the lowest eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding eigenvector is 
 
 
 
 . As we vary the number of sites 
 
 
 
  we find the following table2

where we have use the notation 
 
 

 
 -times i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
Combinatorial Properties
An interesting observation is that the largest components of the ground state of 
 
 
 
  have a combinatorial enumeration as we vary the number of sites,3 as was first observed by Murray Batchelor, Jan de Gier and Bernard Nienhuis.4 Using the resources of the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences, Batchelor et al. found, for an even numbers of sites



and for an odd numbers of sites



Surprisingly, these sequences corresponded to well known combinatorial objects. For 
 
 
 
  even, this sequence corresponded to cyclically symmetric transpose complement plane partitions and for 
 
 
 
  odd these corresponded to 
 
 
alternating sign matrices symmetric about the vertical axis.
