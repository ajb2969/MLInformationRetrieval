   Pseudo-arc      Pseudo-arc   In general topology , the pseudo-arc is the simplest nondegenerate hereditarily  indecomposable continuum . The pseudo-arc is an arc-like homogeneous continuum. R.H. Bing proved that, in a certain well-defined sense, most continua in R n , n ≥ 2, are homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.  History  In 1920, Bronisław Knaster and Kazimierz Kuratowski asked whether a nondegenerate homogeneous continuum in the Euclidean plane R 2 must be a Jordan curve . In 1921, Stefan Mazurkiewicz asked whether a nondegenerate continuum in R 2 that is homeomorphic to each of its nondegenerate subcontinua must be an arc. In 1922, Knaster discovered the first example of a homogeneous hereditarily indecomposable continuum K , later named the pseudo-arc, giving a negative answer to the Mazurkiewicz question. In 1948, R.H. Bing proved that Knaster's continuum is homogeneous, i.e., for any two of its points there is a homeomorphism taking one to the other. Yet also in 1948, Edwin Moise showed that Knaster's continuum is homeomorphic to each of its non-degenerate subcontinua. Due to its resemblance to the fundamental property of the arc, namely, being homeomorphic to all its nondegenerate subcontinua, Moise called his example M a pseudo-arc . 1 Bing's construction is a modification of Moise's construction of M , which he had first heard described in a lecture. In 1951, Bing proved that all hereditarily indecomposable arc-like continua are homeomorphic — this implies that Knaster's K , Moise's M , and Bing's B are all homeomorphic. Bing also proved that the pseudo-arc is typical among the continua in a Euclidean space of dimension at least 2 or an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space . 2  Construction  The following construction of the pseudo-arc follows .  Chains  At the heart of the definition of the pseudo-arc is the concept of a chain , which is defined as follows:   A chain is a finite collection of open sets     𝒞  =   {   C  1   ,   C  2   ,  …  ,   C  n   }       𝒞    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2   normal-…   subscript  C  n      \mathcal{C}=\{C_{1},C_{2},\ldots,C_{n}\}   in a metric space such that      C  i   ∩   C  j    ≠  ∅         subscript  C  i    subscript  C  j       C_{i}\cap C_{j}\neq\emptyset   if and only if     |   i  -  j   |   ≤  1.          i  j    1.    |i-j|\leq 1.   The elements of a chain are called its links , and a chain is called an ε-chain if each of its links has diameter less than ε.   While being the simplest of the type of spaces listed above, the pseudo-arc is actually very complex. The concept of a chain being crooked (defined below) is what endows the pseudo-arc with its complexity. Informally, it requires a chain to follow a certain recursive zig-zag pattern in another chain. To 'move' from the m th link of the larger chain to the n th, the smaller chain must first move in a crooked manner from the m th link to the ( n -1)th link, then in a crooked manner to the ( m +1)th link, and then finally to the n th link.  More formally:   Let   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   and   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   be chains such that   :# each link of   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   is a subset of a link of   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   , and  :# for any indices i , j , m , and n with      D  i   ∩   C  m    ≠  ∅         subscript  D  i    subscript  C  m       D_{i}\cap C_{m}\neq\emptyset   ,      D  j   ∩   C  n    ≠  ∅         subscript  D  j    subscript  C  n       D_{j}\cap C_{n}\neq\emptyset   , and   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   and     D  k   ⊆   C   n  -  1         subscript  D  k    subscript  C    n  1      D_{k}\subseteq C_{n-1}   with      D  ℓ   ⊆   C   m  +  1     .       subscript  D  normal-ℓ    subscript  C    m  1      D_{\ell}\subseteq C_{m+1}.   ) and   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   and    𝒞  .    𝒞   \mathcal{C}.      Then    C  *     superscript  C     C^{*}   is crooked in      C  *   =    ⋃   S  ∈  C    S    .       superscript  C      subscript     S  C    S     C^{*}=\bigcup_{S\in C}S.      Pseudo-arc  For any collection C of sets, let     {   𝒞  i   }    i  ∈  ℕ      subscript    superscript  𝒞  i      i  ℕ     \left\{\mathcal{C}^{i}\right\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}   denote the union of all of the elements of C . That is, let      𝒞  i     superscript  𝒞  i    \mathcal{C}^{i}     The pseudo-arc is defined as follows:   Let p and q be distinct points in the plane and    𝒞  i     superscript  𝒞  i    \mathcal{C}^{i}   be a sequence of chains in the plane such that for each i ,   :#the first link of    1  /   2  i       1   superscript  2  i     1/2^{i}   contains p and the last link contains q ,  :#the chain    𝒞   i  +  1      superscript  𝒞    i  1     \mathcal{C}^{i+1}   is a    𝒞  i     superscript  𝒞  i    \mathcal{C}^{i}   -chain,  :#the closure of each link of    𝒞   i  +  1      superscript  𝒞    i  1     \mathcal{C}^{i+1}   is a subset of some link of    𝒞  i     superscript  𝒞  i    \mathcal{C}^{i}   , and  :#the chain     P  =    ⋂   i  ∈  ℕ      (   𝒞  i   )   *     .      P    subscript     i  ℕ     superscript   superscript  𝒞  i        P=\bigcap_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\left(\mathcal{C}^{i}\right)^{*}.   is crooked in $\mathcal{C}^i$ .   Let $$P=\bigcap_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\left(\mathcal{C}^i\right)^{*}.$$   Then P is a pseudo-arc .   Notes    References   R.H. Bing , A homogeneous indecomposable plane continuum , Duke Math.
