   Tryptophan 2-monooxygenase      Tryptophan 2-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a tryptophan 2-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-tryptophan + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)acetamide + CO 2 + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophan and O 2 , and its 3 products are (indol-3-yl)acetamide , CO 2 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O with incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases o internal mixed-function oxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .
