It is analogous to the square tiling of the plane and to the cubic honeycomb of 3-space.  There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular , with Schläfli symbol {4,3 5 ,4}. Another form has two alternating 7-cube facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,3 4 ,3 1,1 }. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 128 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞} 7 .  Related honeycombs  The [4,3 5 ,4], , Coxeter group generates 255 permutations of uniform tessellations, 135 with unique symmetry and 134 with unique geometry. The expanded 7-cubic honeycomb is geometrically identical to the 7-cubic honeycomb.  The 7-cubic honeycomb can be alternated into the 7-demicubic honeycomb , replacing the 7-cubes with 7-demicubes , and the alternated gaps are filled by 7-orthoplex facets.  Quadritruncated 7-cubic honeycomb  A quadritruncated 7-cubic honeycomb , , containins all tritruncated 7-orthoplex facets and is the Voronoi tessellation of the D 7 * lattice . Facets can be identically colored from a doubled     C  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  C   7    {\tilde{C}}_{7}   ×2, [[4,3 5 ,4]] symmetry, alternately colored from     C  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  C   7    {\tilde{C}}_{7}   , [4,3 5 ,4] symmetry, three colors from     B  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  B   7    {\tilde{B}}_{7}   , [4,3 4 ,3 1,1 ] symmetry, and 4 colors from     D  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  D   7    {\tilde{D}}_{7}   , [3 1,1 ,3 3 ,3 1,1 ] symmetry.
