   Positive linear functional      Positive linear functional   In mathematics , more specifically in functional analysis , a positive linear functional on an ordered vector space ( V , ≤) is a linear functional  f on V so that for all positive elements  v of V , that is v ≥0, it holds that       f   (  v  )    ≥  0.        f  v   0.    f(v)\geq 0.     In other words, a positive linear functional is guaranteed to take nonnegative values for positive elements. The significance of positive linear functionals lies in results such as Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem .  When V is a complex vector space, it is assumed that for all v ≥0 , f ( v ) is real. As in the case when V is a C*-algebra with its partially ordered subspace of self-adjoint elements, sometimes a partial order is placed on only a subspace W of V , and the partial order does not extend to all of V , in which case the positive elements of V are the positive elements of W , by abuse of notation. This implies that for a C*-algebra, a positive linear functional sends any x in V equal to s*s for some s in V to a real number, which is equal to its complex conjugate, and therefore all positive linear functionals preserve the self-adjointness of such x . This property is exploited in the GNS construction to relate positive linear functionals on a C*-algebra to inner products .  Examples   Consider, as an example of V, the C*-algebra of complex  square matrices with the positive elements being the positive-definite matrices . The trace function defined on this C*-algebra is a positive functional, as the eigenvalues of any positive-definite matrix are positive, and so its trace is positive.    Consider the Riesz space C c ( X ) of all continuous complex-valued functions of compact  support on a locally compact  Hausdorff space  X . Consider a Borel regular measure μ on X , and a functional ψ defined by           ψ   (  f  )    =    ∫  X    f   (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )            ψ  f     subscript   X     f  x  d  μ  x      \psi(f)=\int_{X}f(x)d\mu(x)\quad       for all f in C c ( X ). Then, this functional is positive (the integral of any positive function is a positive number). Moreover, any positive functional on this space has this form, as follows from the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem .   Positive Linear Functionals (C*-algebras)  Let M be an operator system in a C*-algebra A with identity 1 . Let M + denote the set of positive elements in M .  A linear functional ρ on M is said to be positive if ρ( a ) ≥ 0, for all a in M + .   Theorem. A linear functional ρ on M is positive if and only if ρ is bounded and ||ρ||=ρ( 1 ).   Cauchy-Schwarz inequality  If ρ is a positive linear functional on a C*-algebra A , then one may define a semidefinite sesquilinear form on A by  := ρ( b * a ). Thus from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have         |   ρ   (    b  *   a   )    |   2   ≤   ρ   (    a  *   a   )   ρ   (    b  *   b   )     .       superscript      ρ     superscript  b    a     2     ρ     superscript  a    a   ρ     superscript  b    b      |\rho(b^{*}a)|^{2}\leq\rho(a^{*}a)\rho(b^{*}b).
