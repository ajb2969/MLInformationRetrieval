   Material properties (thermodynamics)      Material properties (thermodynamics)   The thermodynamic properties of materials are intensive thermodynamic parameters which are specific to a given material. Each is directly related to a second order differential of a thermodynamic potential . Examples for a simple 1-component system are:   Compressibility (or its inverse, the bulk modulus )   :* Isothermal compressibility    \beta_T=-\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T     \quad = -\frac{1}{V}\,\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial P^2}  :* Adiabatic compressibility    \beta_S=-\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_S     \quad = -\frac{1}{V}\,\frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial P^2}   Specific heat (Note - the extensive analog is the heat capacity )   :* Specific heat at constant pressure    c_P=\frac{T}{N}\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_P     \quad = -\frac{T}{N}\,\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial T^2}  :* Specific heat at constant volume    c_V=\frac{T}{N}\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V     \quad = -\frac{T}{N}\,\frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial T^2}   Coefficient of thermal expansion     \alpha=\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P     \quad = \frac{1}{V}\,\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial P\partial T}  where P is pressure , V is volume , T is temperature , S is entropy , and N is the number of particles .  For a single component system, only three second derivatives are needed in order to derive all others, and so only three material properties are needed to derive all others. For a single component system, the "standard" three parameters are the isothermal compressibility    β  T     subscript  β  T    \beta_{T}   , the specific heat at constant pressure    c  P     subscript  c  P    c_{P}   , and the coefficient of thermal expansion   α   α   \alpha   .  For example, the following equations are true:       c  P   =    c  V   +    T  V   α  2     N   β  T           subscript  c  P      subscript  c  V       T  V   superscript  α  2      N   subscript  β  T        c_{P}=c_{V}+\frac{TV\alpha^{2}}{N\beta_{T}}          β  T   =    β  S   +    T  V   α  2     N   c  P           subscript  β  T      subscript  β  S       T  V   superscript  α  2      N   subscript  c  P        \beta_{T}=\beta_{S}+\frac{TV\alpha^{2}}{Nc_{P}}     The three "standard" properties are in fact the three possible second derivatives of the Gibbs free energy with respect to temperature and pressure.
