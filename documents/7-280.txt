Material properties (thermodynamics)

The thermodynamic properties of materials are intensive thermodynamic parameters which are specific to a given material. Each is directly related to a second order differential of a thermodynamic potential. Examples for a simple 1-component system are:

Compressibility (or its inverse, the bulk modulus)

:* Isothermal compressibility






\quad = -\frac{1}{V}\,\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial P^2}
:* Adiabatic compressibility






\quad = -\frac{1}{V}\,\frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial P^2}

Specific heat (Note - the extensive analog is the heat capacity)

:* Specific heat at constant pressure






\quad = -\frac{T}{N}\,\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial T^2}
:* Specific heat at constant volume






\quad = -\frac{T}{N}\,\frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial T^2}

Coefficient of thermal expansion







\quad = \frac{1}{V}\,\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial P\partial T}
where P  is pressure, V  is volume, T  is temperature, S  is entropy, and N  is the number of particles.
For a single component system, only three second derivatives are needed in order to derive all others, and so only three material properties are needed to derive all others. For a single component system, the "standard" three parameters are the isothermal compressibility 
 
 
 
 , the specific heat at constant pressure 
 
 
 
 , and the coefficient of thermal expansion 
 
 
 
 .
For example, the following equations are true:






The three "standard" properties are in fact the three possible second derivatives of the Gibbs free energy with respect to temperature and pressure.
