Star product


The term "Star product" may also refer to the Moyal product.
 

In mathematics, the star product is a method of combining graded posets with unique minimal and maximal elements, preserving the property that the posets are Eulerian.
Definition
The star product of two graded posets

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  has a unique maximal element

 
  and 
 
 
 
  has a unique minimal element 
 
 
 
 , is a poset

 
  on the set 
 
 
 
 . We define the partial order

 
  by 
 
 
 
  if and only if:

1. 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ;
 
2. 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ; or
 
3. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 

In other words, we pluck out the top of 
 
 
 
  and the bottom of 
 
 
 
 , and require that everything in 
 
 
 
  be smaller than everything in 
 
 
 
 .
Example
For example, suppose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the Boolean algebra on two elements.

Then 
 
 
 
  is the poset with the Hasse diagram below.

Properties
The star product of Eulerian posets is Eulerian.
