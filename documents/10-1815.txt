Sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase

In enzymology, a sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cobalt-sirohydrochlorin + 2 H+

 
  sirohydrochlorin + Co2+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cobalt-sirohydrochlorin and H+, whereas its two products are sirohydrochlorin and Co2+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the "catch-all" class of lyases that do not fit into any other sub-class. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cobalt-sirohydrochlorin cobalt-lyase (sirohydrochlorin-forming). Other names in common use include CbiK, CbiX, CbiXS, anaerobic cobalt chelatase, cobaltochelatase [ambiguous], and sirohydrochlorin cobalt-lyase (incorrect). This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
