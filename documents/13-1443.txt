   Scale (descriptive set theory)      Scale (descriptive set theory)   In the mathematical discipline of descriptive set theory , a scale is a certain kind of object defined on a set of points in some Polish space (for example, a scale might be defined on a set of real numbers ). Scales were originally isolated as a concept in the theory of uniformization , 1 but have found wide applicability in descriptive set theory, with applications such as establishing bounds on the possible lengths of wellorderings of a given complexity, and showing (under certain assumptions) that there are largest countable sets of certain complexities.  Formal definition  Given a pointset A contained in some product space      A  ⊆  X  =     X  0   ×   X  1   ×  …    X   m  -  1           A  X            subscript  X  0    subscript  X  1   normal-…    subscript  X    m  1        A\subseteq X=X_{0}\times X_{1}\times\ldots X_{m-1}   where each X k is either the Baire space or a countably infinite discrete set, we say that a norm on A is a map from A into the ordinal numbers . Each norm has an associated prewellordering , where one element of A precedes another element if the norm of the first is less than the norm of the second.  A scale on A is a countably infinite collection of norms       (   ϕ  n   )    n  <  ω      subscript   subscript  ϕ  n     n  ω     (\phi_{n})_{n<\omega}   with the following properties:   If the sequence x i is such that  x i is an element of A for each natural number i , and  x i converges to an element x in the product space X , and  for each natural number n there is an ordinal λ n such that φ n ( x i )=λ n for all sufficiently large i , then    x is an element of A , and  for each n , φ n (x)≤λ n . 2    By itself, at least granted the axiom of choice , the existence of a scale on a pointset is trivial, as A can be wellordered and each φ n can simply enumerate A . To make the concept useful, a definability criterion must be imposed on the norms (individually and together). Here "definability" is understood in the usual sense of descriptive set theory; it need not be definability in an absolute sense, but rather indicates membership in some pointclass of sets of reals. The norms φ n themselves are not sets of reals, but the corresponding prewellorderings are (at least in essence).  The idea is that, for a given pointclass Γ, we want the prewellorderings below a given point in A to be uniformly represented both as a set in Γ and as one in the dual pointclass of Γ, relative to the "larger" point being an element of A . Formally, we say that the φ n form a Γ-scale on A if they form a scale on A and there are ternary relations S and T such that, if y is an element of A , then      ∀  n  ∀  x   (   φ  n    (  x  )   ≤   φ  n    (  y  )   ⇔  S   (  n  ,  x  ,  y  )   ⇔  T   (  n  ,  x  ,  y  )   )      fragments  for-all  n  for-all  x   fragments  normal-(   subscript  φ  n    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  φ  n    fragments  normal-(  y  normal-)   iff  S   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-,  x  normal-,  y  normal-)   iff  T   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-,  x  normal-,  y  normal-)   normal-)     \forall n\forall x(\varphi_{n}(x)\leq\varphi_{n}(y)\iff S(n,x,y)\iff T(n,x,y))   where S is in Γ and T is in the dual pointclass of Γ (that is, the complement of T is in Γ). 3 Note here that we think of φ n ( x ) as being ∞ whenever x ∉ A ; thus the condition φ n ( x )≤φ n ( y ), for y ∈ A , also implies x ∈ A .  Note also that the definition does not imply that the collection of norms is in the intersection of Γ with the dual pointclass of Γ. This is because the three-way equivalence is conditional on y being an element of A . For y not in A , it might be the case that one or both of S(n,x,y) or T(n,x,y) fail to hold, even if x is in A (and therefore automatically φ n ( x )≤φ n ( y )=∞).  Applications   This section is yet to be written    Scale property  The scale property is a strengthening of the prewellordering property . For pointclasses of a certain form, it implies that relations in the given pointclass have a uniformization that is also in the pointclass.
