Graphical lasso

The graphical lasso is an algorithm to estimate the precision matrix (inverse of covariance matrix) from the observations from multivariate Gaussian distribution.1
Setting
Consider observations 
 
 
 
  from multivariate Gaussian distribution 
 
 
 
 . We are interested in estimating the precision matrix 
 
 
 
 .
The graphical lasso estimator is the 
 
 
 
  such that:



Where 
 
 
 
  is the sample covariance, and 
 
 
 
  is the penalizing parameter.2
Application
To obtain the estimator in programs, users could use the R package glasso,3 or GraphLasso() function in Python Scikit-Learn package4
