   Ordinal analysis      Ordinal analysis   In proof theory , ordinal analysis assigns ordinals (often large countable ordinals ) to mathematical theories as a measure of their strength. The field was formed when Gerhard Gentzen in 1934 used cut elimination to prove, in modern terms, that the proof theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic is Œµ 0 .  Definition  Ordinal analysis concerns true, effective (recursive) theories that can interpret a sufficient portion of arithmetic to make statements about ordinal notations. The proof theoretic ordinal of such a theory   T   T   T   is the smallest recursive ordinal that the theory cannot prove is well founded ‚Äî the supremum of all ordinals   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   for which there exists a notation   o   o   o   in Kleene's sense such that   T   T   T   proves that   o   o   o   is an ordinal notation . Equivalently, it is the supremum of all ordinals   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   such that there exists a recursive relation    R   R   R   on   œâ   œâ   \omega   (the set of natural numbers) that well-orders it with ordinal   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   and such that   T   T   T   proves transfinite induction of arithmetical statements for   R   R   R   .  The existence of any recursive ordinal that the theory fails to prove is well ordered follows from the    Œ£  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Œ£  1   1    \Sigma^{1}_{1}   bounding theorem, as the set of natural numbers that an effective theory proves to be ordinal notations is a    Œ£  1  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Œ£  0   1    \Sigma^{0}_{1}   set (see Hyperarithmetical theory ). Thus the proof theoretic ordinal of a theory will always be a countable ordinal less than the Church-Kleene ordinal     œâ  1  CK     superscript   subscript  œâ  1   CK    \omega_{1}^{\mathrm{CK}}   .  In practice, the proof theoretic ordinal of a theory is a good measure of the strength of a theory. If theories have the same proof theoretic ordinal they are often equiconsistent , and if one theory has a larger proof theoretic ordinal than another it can often prove the consistency of the second theory.
