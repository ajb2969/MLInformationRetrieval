   Malate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)      Malate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)    Malate dehydrogenase (NAD(P) + ) (, MdH II, NAD(P) + -dependent malate dehyrogenase ) is an enzyme with system name (S)-malate:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (S)-malate + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + NAD(P)H + H +    This enzyme, which was characterized from the methanogenic archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum , catalyses only the reduction of oxaloacetate , and can use NAD + and NADP + with similar specific activity. It is different from EC 1.1.1.37 (malate dehydrogenase (NAD + )), EC 1.1.1.82 (malate dehydrogenase (NADP + )) and EC 1.1.5.4 (malate dehydrogenase ( quinone )).
