   (S)-canadine synthase      (S)-canadine synthase   In enzymology , a (S)-canadine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-canadine + NADP + + 2 H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are (S)-canadine , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming) . Other names in common use include (S)-tetrahydroberberine synthase , and (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine oxidase (methylenedioxy-bridge-forming) . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i . It employs one cofactor , heme-thiolate(P-450) .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.21  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Heme enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
