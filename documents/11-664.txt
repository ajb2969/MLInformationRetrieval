   Adenosine-phosphate deaminase      Adenosine-phosphate deaminase   In enzymology , an adenosine-phosphate deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5'-AMP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5'-IMP + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5'-AMP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 5'-IMP and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenosine-phosphate aminohydrolase . Other names in common use include adenylate deaminase , adenine nucleotide deaminase , and adenosine (phosphate) deaminase .
