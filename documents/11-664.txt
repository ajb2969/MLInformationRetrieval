Adenosine-phosphate deaminase




Adenosine-phosphate deaminase

In enzymology, an adenosine-phosphate deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5'-AMP + H2O 
 
 
 
  5'-IMP + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5'-AMP and H2O, whereas its two products are 5'-IMP and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenosine-phosphate aminohydrolase. Other names in common use include adenylate deaminase, adenine nucleotide deaminase, and adenosine (phosphate) deaminase.
