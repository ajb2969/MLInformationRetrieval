   Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem      Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem   In algebraic number theory , the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem states that a central simple algebra over an algebraic number field  K which splits over every completion  K v is a matrix algebra over K . The theorem is an example of a local-global principle in algebraic number theory and leads to a complete description of finite-dimensional division algebras over algebraic number fields in terms of their local invariants . It was proved independently by Helmut Hasse , Richard Brauer , and Emmy Noether and by Abraham Adrian Albert .  Statement of the theorem  Let A be a central simple algebra of rank d over an algebraic number field  K . Suppose that for any valuation  v , A splits over the corresponding local field K v :        A   ⊗  K    K  v    ≃    M  d    (   K  v   )     .     similar-to-or-equals    subscript  tensor-product  K   A   subscript  K  v       subscript  M  d    subscript  K  v      A\otimes_{K}K_{v}\simeq M_{d}(K_{v}).     Then A is isomorphic to the matrix algebra M d ( K ).  Applications  Using the theory of Brauer group , one shows that two central simple algebras A and B over an algebraic number field K are isomorphic over K if and only if their completions A v and B v are isomorphic over the completion K v for every v .  Together with the Grunwald–Wang theorem , the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem implies that every central simple algebra over an algebraic number field is cyclic , i.e. can be obtained by an explicit construction from a cyclic field extension  L / K .
