Desosaminyl transferase EryCIII

Desosaminyl transferase EryCIII (, EryCIII) is an enzyme with system name dTDP-3-dimethylamino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose:3-alpha-mycarosylerythronolide B 3-dimethylamino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

dTDP-3-dimethylamino-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose + 3-alpha-mycarosylerythronolide B 
 
 
 
  dTDP + erythromycin D
 

The enzyme is involved in erythromycin biosynthesis.
