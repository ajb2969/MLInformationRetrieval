Wiener–Ikehara theorem

The Wiener–Ikehara theorem is a Tauberian theorem introduced by . It follows from Wiener's Tauberian theorem, and can be used to prove the prime number theorem (PNT) (Chandrasekharan, 1969).
Statement
Let A(x) be a non-negative, monotonic nondecreasing function of x, defined for 0 ≤ x \int_0^\infty A(x) e^{-xs}\,dx
converges for ℜ(s) > 1 to the function ƒ(s) and that ƒ(s) is analytic for ℜ(s) ≥ 1, except for a simple pole at s = 1 with residue 1: that is,



is analytic in ℜ(s) ≥ 1. Then the limit as x goes to infinity of e−x A(x) is equal to 1.
Application
An important number-theoretic application of the theorem is to Dirichlet series of the form



where a(n) is non-negative. If the series converges to an analytic function in



with a simple pole of residue c at s = b, then



Applying this to the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function, where the coefficients in the Dirichlet series are values of the von Mangoldt function, it is possible to deduce the PNT from the fact that the zeta function has no zeroes on the line
