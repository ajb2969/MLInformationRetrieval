Josephson penetration depth




Josephson penetration depth

In superconductivity, Josephson penetration depth characterizes the typical length on which an externally applied magnetic field penetrates into the long Josephson junction. Josephson penetration depth is usually denoted as 
 
 
 
  and is given by the following expression (in SI):





where 
 
 
 
  is the magnetic flux quantum, 
 
 
 
  is the critical current density 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  characterizes the inductance of the superconducting electrodes





where 
 
 
 
  is the thickness of the Josephson barrier (usually insulator), 
 
 
 
  are the thicknesses of superconducting electrodes, and 
 
 
 
  are their London penetration depths.
