Bailey pair

In mathematics, a Bailey pair is a pair of sequences satisfying certain relations, and a Bailey chain is a sequence of Bailey pairs. Bailey pairs were introduced by  while studying the second proof  of the Rogers–Ramanujan identities, and Bailey chains were introduced by .
Definition
The q-Pochhammer symbols

 
  are defined as:


 
  or equivalently



Bailey's lemma
Bailey's lemma states that if (αn,βn) is a Bailey pair, then so is (α'n,β'n) where





 
  In other words, given one Bailey pair, one can construct a second using the formulas above. This process can be iterated to produce an infinite sequence of Bailey pairs, called a Bailey chain.
Examples
An example of a Bailey pair is given by 
$$\alpha_n = q^{n^2+n}\sum_{j=-n}^n(-1)^jq^{-j^2}, \quad \beta_n = \frac{(-q)^n}{(q^2;q^2)_n}.$$  gave a list of 130 examples related to Bailey pairs.
