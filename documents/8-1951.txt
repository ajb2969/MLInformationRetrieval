   Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test      Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test   In computational number theory , the Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test is an algorithm for determining whether a number is prime . Unlike other, more efficient algorithms for this purpose, it avoids the use of random numbers, so it is a deterministic  primality test . It is named after its discoverers, Leonard Adleman , Carl Pomerance , and Robert Rumely . The test involves arithmetic in cyclotomic fields .  It was later improved by Henri Cohen and Hendrik Willem Lenstra and called APRT-CL (or APRCL). It can test primality of an integer n in time:       O   (    (   ln  n   )     c     ln     ln    ln  n       )    .      O   superscript    n     c        n         O((\ln n)^{c\,\ln\,\ln\,\ln n}).     Software implementations   UBASIC provides an implementation under the name APRT-CLE (APRT-CL extended)  A factoring applet that uses APR-CL on certain conditions (source code included)  Pari/GP uses APR-CL conditionally in its implementation of isprime().
