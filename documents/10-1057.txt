   Desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase      Desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase   In enzymology , a desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   desacetoxyvindoline + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   deacetylvindoline + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are desacetoxyvindoline , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are deacetylvindoline , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is desacetoxyvindoline,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (4beta-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase , desacetyoxyvindoline-17-hydroxylase , D17H , desacetoxyvindoline,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase , and (4beta-hydroxylating) . This enzyme participates in terpene indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.  References       "  Category:EC 1.14.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
