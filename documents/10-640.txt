   21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP+)      21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a 21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pregnan-21-ol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pregnan-21-al + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pregnan-21-ol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are pregnan-21-al , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 21-hydroxysteroid:NADP + 21-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 21-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , 21-hydroxy steroid (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , dehydrogenase , 21-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , phosphate) , NADP + -21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , and 21-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP + ) .
