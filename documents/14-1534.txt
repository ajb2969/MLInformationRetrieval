Effective domain

In convex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the effective domain is an extension of the domain of a function.
Given a vector space X then a convex function mapping to the extended reals, 
 
 
 
 , has an effective domain defined by


12 If the function is concave, then the effective domain is

The effective domain is equivalent to the projection of the epigraph of a function 
 
 
 
  onto X. That is

Note that if a convex function is mapping to the normal real number line given by 
 
 
 
  then the effective domain is the same as the normal definition of the domain.
A function 
 
 
 
  is a proper convex function if and only if f is convex, the effective domain of f is nonempty and 
 
 
 
  for every
