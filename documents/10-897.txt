Alpha-santonin 1,2-reductase

In enzymology, an alpha-santonin 1,2-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1,2-dihydrosantonin + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  alpha-santonin + NAD(P)H + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-dihydrosantonin, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are alpha-santonin, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-dihydrosantonin:NAD(P)+ 1,2-oxidoreductase.
