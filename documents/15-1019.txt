Unspecific peroxygenase

Unspecific peroxygenase (, aromatic peroxygenase, mushroom peroxygenase, haloperoxidase-peroxygenase, Agrocybe aegerita peroxidase) is an enzyme with system name substrate:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase (RH-hydroxylating or -epoxidising).123456789 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

RH + H2O2

 
  ROH + H2O
 

Unspecific peroxygenase is a heme-thiolate protein comparable to Cytochrome_P450 in the ability to catalyze a variety of P450 reactions (hence "unspecific"), but forms a unique, solely fungal, protein family of extracellular enzymes.
