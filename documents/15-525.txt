   BELLA (laser)      BELLA (laser)   (Figure)  insert a caption here   The Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator or BELLA is a laser built by the Thales Group and owned and operated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . 1 2 On 20 July 2012 BELLA fired a 40 femtosecond laser pulse , establishing a world record for most powerful laser. 3 4  BELLA was designed and built by Thales as part of the Laser and Optical Accelerator Systems Integrated Studies (LOASIS) program at LBNL. The LOASIS group studies the application of high-powered lasers to build compact particle accelerators . The BELLA laser was developed for the purposes of studying this principle. 5 6 The idea is that a laser which delivers a large amount of power in a very short pulse can cause ionization in a gas followed by plasma oscillation . 7 As a result the gas will emit electron bundles which can be used for medical imaging or materials research . 8 9  On 20 July 2012, BELLA fired a laser pulse with a duration of 40 femtoseconds and a repetition frequency of 1 hertz . The pulses had a compressed output energy of 42.2 joule , making the power output of the laser 1 petawatt :        42.2  J    40  f  s    =    42.2  J     40  *   10   -  15     s    ≈     1  *   10  15    J   /  s   =   1  P  W             42.2  J     40  f  s        42.2  J       40   superscript  10    15     s               1   superscript  10  15    J   s          1  P  W      {42.2J\over 40fs}={42.2J\over 40*10^{-15}s}\approx 1*10^{15}J/s=1PW     This result established BELLA as the highest peak power laser in the world (at a 1 Hz repetition rate). 10 11 12  In December, 2014, a team of researchers accelerated electrons using BELLA up to an energy of 4.25 GeV—the absolute highest energies recorded to date using a compact accelerator. 13  References  "  Category:Research lasers     ↩  ↩   ↩          ↩
