Binary offset carrier modulation

Binary Offset Carrier modulation12 (BOC modulation) was developed by John Betz, PhD, in order to allow interoperability of satellite navigation systems. It is currently used in the US GPS system and in Galileo3 and is a square sub-carrier modulation, where a signal is multiplied by a rectangular sub-carrier of frequency 
 
 
 
  equal or higher to the chip rate. Following this sub-carrier multiplication, the spectrum of the signal is divided into two parts, therefore BOC modulation is also known as a split-spectrum modulation.
The main idea behind BOC modulation is to reduce the interference with BPSK-modulated signal, which has a sinc function shaped spectrum. Therefore, BPSK-modulated signals such as C/A GPS codes have most of their spectral energy concentrated around the carrier frequency, while BOC-modulated signals (used in Galileo system) have low energy around the carrier frequency and two main spectral lobes further away from the carrier (thus, the name of split-spectrum).
BOC modulation has several variants: sine BOC (SinBOC),45 cosine BOC (CosBOC)678 Alternative BOC (AltBOC),9101112 multiplexed BOC (MBOC),1314151617 Double BOC (DBOC)18 etc. and some of them have been currently selected for Galileo GNSS signals.
A BOC waveform is typically denoted via BOC(m,n) or BOC
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the sub-carrier frequency, 
 
 
 
  is the chip frequency, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  Mcps is the reference chip frequency of C/A GPS signal.
A sine BOC(1,1) modulation is similar to Manchester code, that is, in digital domain, a '+1' is encoded as a '+1 −1' sequence, and a '0' is encoded as a '−1 +1' sequence. For an arbitrary 
 
 
 
  modulation order, in sine BOC(m,n) case, a '+1' is encoded as an alternating sequence of '+1 −1 +1 −1 +1 ...', having 
 
 
 
  elements, and a '0' (or '−1') is encoded as an alternating '−1 +1 ...' sequence, also having 
 
 
 
  elements.
BOC modulation is typically applied on CDMA signals, where each chip of the pseudorandom code is split into BOC sub-intervals, as explained above (i.e., there are 
 
 
 
  BOC intervals per chip).
The power spectral density of a BOC-modulated signal depends on the BOC modulation order 
 
 
 
  and its derivation can be found, for example, in 1920
