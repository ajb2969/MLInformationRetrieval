   Dissipative operator      Dissipative operator   In mathematics , a dissipative operator is a linear operator  A defined on a linear subspace  D ( A ) of Banach space  X , taking values in X such that for all Œª > 0 and all x ‚àà D ( A )        ‚à•    (    Œª  I   -  A   )   x   ‚à•   ‚â•   Œª   ‚à•  x  ‚à•     .       norm        Œª  I   A   x      Œª   norm  x      \|(\lambda I-A)x\|\geq\lambda\|x\|.     A couple of equivalent definitions are given below. A dissipative operator is called maximally dissipative if it is dissipative and for all Œª > 0 the operator ŒªI ‚àí A is surjective, meaning that the range when applied to the domain D is the whole of the space X .  An operator that obeys a similar condition but with a plus sign instead of a minus sign (that is, the negation of a dissipative operator) is called an accretive operator . 1  The main importance of dissipative operators is their appearance in the Lumer‚ÄìPhillips theorem which characterizes maximally dissipative operators as the generators of contraction semigroups .  Properties  A dissipative operator has the following properties 2   From the inequality given above, we see that for any x in the domain of A , if ‚Äñ x ‚Äñ ‚â† 0 then      ‚à•    (    Œª  I   -  A   )   x   ‚à•   ‚â†  0   ,       norm        Œª  I   A   x    0    \|(\lambda I-A)x\|\neq 0,   so the kernel of ŒªI ‚àí A is just the zero vector and ŒªI ‚àí A is therefore injective and has an inverse for all Œª > 0. (If we have the strict inequality      ‚à•    (    Œª  I   -  A   )   x   ‚à•   >   Œª   ‚à•  x  ‚à•         norm        Œª  I   A   x      Œª   norm  x      \|(\lambda I-A)x\|>\lambda\|x\|   for all non-null x in the domain, then, by the triangle inequality ,       ‚à•   Œª  x   ‚à•   +   ‚à•   A  x   ‚à•    ‚â•   ‚à•    (    Œª  I   -  A   )   x   ‚à•   >   Œª   ‚à•  x  ‚à•     ,           norm    Œª  x     norm    A  x      norm        Œª  I   A   x           Œª   norm  x       \|\lambda x\|+\|Ax\|\geq\|(\lambda I-A)x\|>\lambda\|x\|,   which implies that A itself has an inverse.) We may then state that          ‚à•     (    Œª  I   -  A   )    -  1    z   ‚à•   ‚â§    1  Œª    ‚à•  z  ‚à•         norm     superscript      Œª  I   A     1    z        1  Œª    norm  z      \|(\lambda I-A)^{-1}z\|\leq\frac{1}{\lambda}\|z\|        for all z in the range of ŒªI ‚àí A . This is the same inequality as that given at the beginning of this article, with     z  =    (    Œª  I   -  A   )   x    .      z        Œª  I   A   x     z=(\lambda I-A)x.   (We could equally well write these as     ‚à•     (   I  -   Œ∫  A    )    -  1    z   ‚à•   ‚â§    ‚à•  z  ‚à•   or   ‚à•    (   I  -   Œ∫  A    )   x   ‚à•    ‚â•   ‚à•  x  ‚à•          norm     superscript    I    Œ∫  A      1    z       norm  z   or   norm      I    Œ∫  A    x           norm  x      \|(I-\kappa A)^{-1}z\|\leq\|z\|\text{ or }\|(I-\kappa A)x\|\geq\|x\|   which must hold for any positive Œ∫.)      ŒªI ‚àí A is surjective for some Œª > 0 if and only if it is surjective for all Œª > 0. (This is the aforementioned maximally dissipative case.) In that case one has (0, ‚àû) ‚äÇ œÅ ( A ) (the resolvent set of A ).  A is a closed operator if and only if the range of ŒªI - A is closed for some (equivalently: for all) Œª > 0.   Equivalent characterizations  Define the duality set of x ‚àà X , a subset of the dual space  X ' of X , by        J   (  x  )    :=   {    x  ‚Ä≤   ‚àà   X  ‚Ä≤    :     ‚à•   x  ‚Ä≤   ‚à•    X  ‚Ä≤   2   =    ‚à•  x  ‚à•   X  2   =   ‚ü®   x  ‚Ä≤   ,  x  ‚ü©    }    .     assign    J  x    conditional-set     superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤    superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤         superscript   subscript   norm   superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    2    superscript   subscript   norm  x   X   2          superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤   x        J(x):=\left\{x^{\prime}\in X^{\prime}:\|x^{\prime}\|_{X^{\prime}}^{2}=\|x\|_{X%
 }^{2}=\langle x^{\prime},x\rangle\right\}.     By the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem this set is nonempty. 3 If X is reflexive , then J ( x ) consists of a single element. In the Hilbert space case (using the canonical duality between a Hilbert space and its dual) it consists of the single element x . 4 Using this notation, A is dissipative if and only if 5 for all x ‚àà D ( A ) there exists a x ' ‚àà J ( x ) such that       Re   ‚ü®   A  x   ,   x  ‚Ä≤   ‚ü©    ‚â§  0.        Re     A  x    superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤     0.    {\rm Re}\langle Ax,x^{\prime}\rangle\leq 0.     In the case of Hilbert spaces, this becomes     Re   ‚ü®   A  x   ,  x  ‚ü©    ‚â§  0        Re     A  x   x    0    {\rm Re}\langle Ax,x\rangle\leq 0   for all x in D ( A ). Since this is non-positive, we have        ‚à•   x  -   A  x    ‚à•   2   =      ‚à•  x  ‚à•   2   +    ‚à•   A  x   ‚à•   2    -   2  R  e   ‚ü®   A  x   ,  x  ‚ü©     ‚â•     ‚à•  x  ‚à•   2   +    ‚à•   A  x   ‚à•   2   +   2  R  e   ‚ü®   A  x   ,  x  ‚ü©     =    ‚à•   x  +   A  x    ‚à•   2          superscript   norm    x    A  x     2        superscript   norm  x   2    superscript   norm    A  x    2      2  normal-R  normal-e     A  x   x             superscript   norm  x   2    superscript   norm    A  x    2     2  normal-R  normal-e     A  x   x           superscript   norm    x    A  x     2      \|x-Ax\|^{2}=\|x\|^{2}+\|Ax\|^{2}-2{\rm Re}\langle Ax,x\rangle\geq\|x\|^{2}+\|%
 Ax\|^{2}+2{\rm Re}\langle Ax,x\rangle=\|x+Ax\|^{2}          ‚à¥    ‚à•   x  -   A  x    ‚à•   ‚â•   ‚à•   x  +   A  x    ‚à•       therefore  absent     norm    x    A  x      norm    x    A  x        \therefore\|x-Ax\|\geq\|x+Ax\|     Since I‚àíA has an inverse, this implies that     (   I  +  A   )     (   I  -  A   )    -  1          I  A    superscript    I  A     1      (I+A)(I-A)^{-1}   is a contraction , and more generally,     (    Œª  I   +  A   )     (    Œª  I   -  A   )    -  1            Œª  I   A    superscript      Œª  I   A     1      (\lambda I+A)(\lambda I-A)^{-1}   is a contraction for any positive Œª. The utility of this formulation is that if this operator is a contraction for some positive Œª then A is dissipative. It is not necessary to show that it is a contraction for all positive Œª (though this is true), in contrast to (ŒªI‚àíA) ‚àí1 which must be proved to be a contraction for all positive values of Œª.  Examples   For a simple finite-dimensional example, consider n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n with its usual dot product . If A denotes the negative of the identity operator , defined on all of R n , then            x  ‚ãÖ  A   x   =   x  ‚ãÖ   (   -  x   )    =   -    ‚à•  x  ‚à•   2    ‚â§  0   ,           normal-‚ãÖ  x  A   x    normal-‚ãÖ  x    x            superscript   norm  x   2         0     x\cdot Ax=x\cdot(-x)=-\|x\|^{2}\leq 0,         so A is a dissipative operator.    So long as the domain of an operator A (a matrix) is the whole Euclidean space, then it is dissipative if and only if A + A * (the sum of A and its adjoint ) does not have any positive eigenvalue, and (consequently) all such operators are maximally dissipative. (This criterion follows from the fact that the real part of      x  *   A  x   ,       superscript  x    A  x    x^{*}Ax,   which must be nonpositive for any x , is      x  *     A  +   A  *    2   x   .       superscript  x        A   superscript  A     2   x    x^{*}\frac{A+A^{*}}{2}x.   The eigenvalues of this quadratic form must therefore be nonpositive.) An equivalent condition is that for some (and hence any) positive    Œª  ,   Œª  -  A      Œª    Œª  A     \lambda,\lambda-A   has an inverse and the operator     (   Œª  +  A   )     (   Œª  -  A   )    -  1          Œª  A    superscript    Œª  A     1      (\lambda+A)(\lambda-A)^{-1}   is a contraction (that is, it either diminishes or leaves unchanged the norm of its operand). If the time derivative of a point x in the space is given by Ax , then the time evolution is governed by a contraction semigroup that constantly decreases the norm (or at least doesn't allow it to increase). (Note however that if the domain of A is a proper subspace, then A cannot be maximally dissipative because the range will not have a high enough dimensionality.)    Consider H = L 2 ([0, 1]; R ) with its usual inner product, and let Au = u ‚Ä≤ with domain D ( A ) equal to those functions u in the Sobolev space  H 1 ([0, 1]; R ) with u (1) = 0. D ( A ) is dense in L 2 ([0, 1]; R ). Moreover, for every u in D ( A ), using integration by parts ,          ‚ü®  u  ,   A  u   ‚ü©   =    ‚à´  0  1    u   (  x  )    u  ‚Ä≤    (  x  )   d  x    =   -    1  2   u    (  0  )   2     ‚â§  0.         u    A  u      superscript   subscript   0   1     u  x   superscript  u  normal-‚Ä≤   x  normal-d  x               1  2   u   superscript  0  2          0.     \langle u,Au\rangle=\int_{0}^{1}u(x)u^{\prime}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=-\frac{1}{2}u(0%
 )^{2}\leq 0.         Hence, A is a dissipative operator. Furthermore, since there is a solution in D to     u  -   Œª   u  ‚Ä≤     =  f        u    Œª   superscript  u  normal-‚Ä≤     f    u-\lambda u^{\prime}=f   for any f in H , the operator A is maximally dissipative. Note that in a case of infinite dimensionality like this, the range can be the whole Banach space even though the domain is only a proper subspace thereof.    Consider H = H 0 2 (Œ©; R ) (see Sobolev space ) for an open and connected domain Œ© ‚äÜ R n and let A = Œî, the Laplace operator , defined on the dense subspace of compactly supported smooth functions on Œ©. Then, using integration by parts,           ‚ü®  u  ,   Œî  u   ‚ü©   =    ‚à´  Œ©    u   (  x  )   Œî  u   (  x  )   d  x    =   -    ‚à´  Œ©       |    ‚àá  u    (  x  )    |   2    d  x     =   -    ‚à•   ‚àá  u   ‚à•     L  2    (  Œ©  ;  ùêë  )      ‚â§  0   ,         u    normal-Œî  u      subscript   normal-Œ©     u  x  normal-Œî  u  x  normal-d  x             subscript   normal-Œ©      superscript       normal-‚àá  u   x    2   normal-d  x             subscript   norm   normal-‚àá  u       superscript  L  2    normal-Œ©  ùêë           0     \langle u,\Delta u\rangle=\int_{\Omega}u(x)\Delta u(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=-\int_{%
 \Omega}\big|\nabla u(x)\big|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}x=-\|\nabla u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega;%
 \mathbf{R})}\leq 0,         so the Laplacian is a dissipative operator.
