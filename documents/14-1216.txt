   Singular submodule      Singular submodule   In the branches of abstract algebra known as ring theory and module theory , each right (resp. left) R module M has a singular submodule consisting of elements whose annihilators are essential right (resp. left) ideals in R . In set notation it is usually denoted as     𝒵   (  M  )    =   {   m  ∈  M   ∣    ann   (  m  )     ⊆  e   R   }         𝒵  M    conditional-set    m  M     subscript   e     ann  m   R      \mathcal{Z}(M)=\{m\in M\mid\mathrm{ann}(m)\subseteq_{e}R\}\,   . For general rings,    𝒵   (  M  )       𝒵  M    \mathcal{Z}(M)   is a good generalization of the torsion submodule tors( M ) which is most often defined for domains . In the case that R is a commutative domain,     t  o  r  s   (  M  )    =   𝒵   (  M  )          t  o  r  s  M     𝒵  M     tors(M)=\mathcal{Z}(M)   .  If R is any ring,    𝒵   (   R  R   )       𝒵   subscript  R  R     \mathcal{Z}(R_{R})   is defined considering R as a right module, and in this case    𝒵   (   R  R   )       𝒵   subscript  R  R     \mathcal{Z}(R_{R})   is a twosided ideal of R called the right singular ideal of R . Similarly the left handed analogue    𝒵    (  R   R  )      fragments  Z   fragments   subscript  normal-(  R   R  normal-)     \mathcal{Z}(_{R}R)   is defined. It is possible for    𝒵   (   R  R   )   ≠  𝒵    (  R   R  )      fragments  Z   fragments  normal-(   subscript  R  R   normal-)    Z   fragments   subscript  normal-(  R   R  normal-)     \mathcal{Z}(R_{R})\neq\mathcal{Z}(_{R}R)   .  Definitions  Here are several definitions used when studying singular submodule and singular ideals. In the following, M is an R module:   M is called a singular module if     𝒵   (  M  )    =   M         𝒵  M   M    \mathcal{Z}(M)=M\,   .  M is called a nonsingular module if     𝒵   (  M  )    =   {  0  }         𝒵  M    0     \mathcal{Z}(M)=\{0\}\,   .  R is called right nonsingular if     𝒵   (   R  R   )    =   {  0  }         𝒵   subscript  R  R     0     \mathcal{Z}(R_{R})=\{0\}\,   . A left nonsingular ring is defined similarly, using the left singular ideal, and it is entirely possible for a ring to be right-but-not-left nonsingular.   In rings with unity it is always the case that     𝒵   (   R  R   )    ⊊   R         𝒵   subscript  R  R    R    \mathcal{Z}(R_{R})\subsetneq R\,   , and so "right singular ring" is not usually defined the same way as singular modules are. Some authors have used "singular ring" to mean "has a nonzero singular ideal", however this usage is not consistent with the usage of the adjectives for modules.  Properties  Some general properties of the singular submodule include:          𝒵   (  M  )    ⋅  soc    (  M  )    =   {  0  }          normal-⋅    𝒵  M   soc   M    0     \mathcal{Z}(M)\cdot\mathrm{soc}(M)=\{0\}\,   where    soc   (  M  )       soc  M    \mathrm{soc}(M)\,   denotes the socle of M .  If f is a homomorphism of R modules from M to N , then     f   (   𝒵   (  M  )    )    ⊆   𝒵   (  N  )          f    𝒵  M      𝒵  N     f(\mathcal{Z}(M))\subseteq\mathcal{Z}(N)\,   .  If N is a submodule of M , then     𝒵   (  N  )    =   N  ∩   𝒵   (  M  )           𝒵  N     N    𝒵  M      \mathcal{Z}(N)=N\cap\mathcal{Z}(M)\,   .  The properties "singular" and "nonsingular" are Morita invariant properties .  The singular ideals of a ring contain central nilpotent elements of the ring. Consequently the singular ideal of a commutative ring contains the nilradical of the ring.  A general property of the torsion submodule is that     t   (    M  /  t    (  M  )    )    =   {  0  }         t      M  t   M     0     t(M/t(M))=\{0\}\,   , but this does not necessarily hold for the singular submodule. However if R is a right nonsingular ring, then     𝒵   (    M  /  𝒵    (  M  )    )    =   {  0  }         𝒵      M  𝒵   M     0     \mathcal{Z}(M/\mathcal{Z}(M))=\{0\}\,   .  If N is an essential submodule of M (both right modules) then M / N is singular. If M is a free module , or if R is right nonsingular, then the converse is true.  A semisimple module is nonsingular if and only if it is a projective module .  If R is a right self-injective ring , then     𝒵   (   R  R   )    =   J   (  R  )          𝒵   subscript  R  R      J  R     \mathcal{Z}(R_{R})=J(R)\,   , where J( R ) is the Jacobson radical of R .   Examples  Right nonsingular rings are a very broad class, including reduced rings , right (semi)hereditary rings , von Neumann regular rings , domains , semisimple rings , Baer rings and right Rickart rings .  For commutative rings, being nonsingular is equivalent to being a reduced ring.  Important theorems  Johnson's Theorem (due to R. E. Johnson ) contains several important equivalences. For any ring R , the following are equivalent:   R is right nonsingular.  The injective hull E( R R ) is a nonsingular right R module.  The endomorphism ring    S  =   End   (   E   (   R  R   )    )        S    End    E   subscript  R  R       S=\mathrm{End}(E(R_{R}))\,   is a semiprimitive ring (that is,     J   (  S  )    =   {  0  }         J  S    0     J(S)=\{0\}\,   ).  The maximal right ring of quotients      Q   m  a  x   r    (  R  )        superscript   subscript  Q    m  a  x    r   R    Q_{max}^{r}(R)   is von Neumann regular.   Right nonsingularity has a strong interaction with right self injective rings as well.  Theorem: If R is a right self injective ring, then the following conditions on R are equivalent: right nonsingular, von Neumann regular, right semihereditary, right Rickart, Baer, semiprimitive.  The paper  used nonsingular modules to characterize the class of rings whose maximal right ring of quotients have a certain structure.  Theorem: If R is a ring, then     Q   m  a  x   r    (  R  )        superscript   subscript  Q    m  a  x    r   R    Q_{max}^{r}(R)   is a right full linear ring if and only if R has a nonsingular, faithful , uniform module . Moreover,     Q   m  a  x   r    (  R  )        superscript   subscript  Q    m  a  x    r   R    Q_{max}^{r}(R)   is a finite direct product of full linear rings if and only if R has a nonsingular, faithful module with finite uniform dimension .
