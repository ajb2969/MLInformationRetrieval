   Granville number      Granville number   In mathematics , specifically number theory , Granville numbers are an extension of the perfect numbers .  The Granville set  In 1996, Andrew Granville proposed the following construction of the set    𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   : 1   Let    1  ∈  𝒮      1  𝒮    1\in\mathcal{S}   and for all     n  ∈  ℕ   ,   n  >  1      formulae-sequence    n  ℕ     n  1     n\in{\mathbb{N}},\;n>1   let    n  ∈  𝒮      n  𝒮    n\in{\mathcal{S}}   if: : \sum_{d\mid{n},\; d    A Granville number is an element of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   for which equality holds i.e. it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors that are also in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . Granville numbers are also called   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect numbers. 2  General properties  The elements of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   can be -deficient, -perfect, or -abundant. In particular, 2-perfect numbers are a proper subset of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . 3  S-deficient numbers  Numbers that fulfill the strict form of the inequality in the above definition are known as   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -deficient numbers. That is, the   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -deficient numbers are the natural numbers that are strictly less than the sum of their divisors in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   .  S-perfect numbers  Numbers that fulfill equality in the above definition are known as   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect numbers. 4 That is, the   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect numbers are the natural numbers that are equal the sum of their divisors in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . The first few   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect numbers are:   6, 24, 28, 96, 126, 224, 384, 496, 1536, 1792, 6144, 8128, 14336, ...   Every perfect number is also   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect. 5 However, there are numbers such as 24 which are   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect but not perfect. The only known   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect number with three distinct prime factors is 126 = 2 · 3² · 7 . 6  S-abundant numbers  Numbers that violate the inequality in the above definition are known as   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -abundant numbers. That is, the   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -abundant numbers are the natural numbers that are strictly greater than the sum of their divisors in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   ; they belong to the complement of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . The first few   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -abundant numbers are:   12, 18, 20, 30, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 102, 104, ...   Examples  Every deficient number and every perfect number is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   because the restriction of the divisors sum to members of   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   either decreases the divisors sum or leaves it unchanged. The first natural number that is not in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is the smallest abundant number , which is 12. The next two abundant numbers, 18 and 20, are also not in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . However, the fourth abundant number, 24, is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   because the sum of its proper divisors in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is:   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 24   In other words, 24 is abundant but not   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -abundant because 12 is not in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   . In fact, 24 is   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect - it is the smallest number that is   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   -perfect but not perfect.  The smallest odd abundant number that is in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   is 2835, and the smallest pair of consecutive numbers that are not in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   are 5984 and 5985. 7  References  "  Category:Number theory     ↩  ↩
