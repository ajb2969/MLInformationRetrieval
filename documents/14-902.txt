Granville number

In mathematics, specifically number theory, Granville numbers are an extension of the perfect numbers.
The Granville set
In 1996, Andrew Granville proposed the following construction of the set

 
 :1

Let 
 
 
 
  and for all 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
  if:
 
 :


A Granville number is an element of 
 
 
 
  for which equality holds i.e. it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors that are also in 
 
 
 
 . Granville numbers are also called 
 
 
 
 -perfect numbers.2
General properties
The elements of 
 
 
 
  can be -deficient, -perfect, or -abundant. In particular, 2-perfect numbers are a proper subset of 
 
 
 
 .3
S-deficient numbers
Numbers that fulfill the strict form of the inequality in the above definition are known as 
 
 
 
 -deficient numbers. That is, the 
 
 
 
 -deficient numbers are the natural numbers that are strictly less than the sum of their divisors in 
 
 
 
 .
S-perfect numbers
Numbers that fulfill equality in the above definition are known as 
 
 
 
 -perfect numbers.4 That is, the 
 
 
 
 -perfect numbers are the natural numbers that are equal the sum of their divisors in 
 
 
 
 . The first few 
 
 
 
 -perfect numbers are:

6, 24, 28, 96, 126, 224, 384, 496, 1536, 1792, 6144, 8128, 14336, ... 
 

Every perfect number is also 
 
 
 
 -perfect.5 However, there are numbers such as 24 which are 
 
 
 
 -perfect but not perfect. The only known 
 
 
 
 -perfect number with three distinct prime factors is 126 = 2 · 3² · 7 .6
S-abundant numbers
Numbers that violate the inequality in the above definition are known as 
 
 
 
 -abundant numbers. That is, the 
 
 
 
 -abundant numbers are the natural numbers that are strictly greater than the sum of their divisors in 
 
 
 
 ; they belong to the complement of 
 
 
 
 . The first few 
 
 
 
 -abundant numbers are:

12, 18, 20, 30, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 102, 104, ... 
 

Examples
Every deficient number and every perfect number is in 
 
 
 
  because the restriction of the divisors sum to members of 
 
 
 
  either decreases the divisors sum or leaves it unchanged. The first natural number that is not in 
 
 
 
  is the smallest abundant number, which is 12. The next two abundant numbers, 18 and 20, are also not in 
 
 
 
 . However, the fourth abundant number, 24, is in 
 
 
 
  because the sum of its proper divisors in 
 
 
 
  is:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 24
 

In other words, 24 is abundant but not 
 
 
 
 -abundant because 12 is not in 
 
 
 
 . In fact, 24 is 
 
 
 
 -perfect - it is the smallest number that is 
 
 
 
 -perfect but not perfect.
The smallest odd abundant number that is in 
 
 
 
  is 2835, and the smallest pair of consecutive numbers that are not in 
 
 
 
  are 5984 and 5985.7
