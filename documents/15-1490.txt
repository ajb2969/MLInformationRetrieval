3-O-alpha-D-glucosyl-L-rhamnose phosphorylase

3-O-alpha-D-glucosyl-L-rhamnose phosphorylase (, cphy1019 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-rhamnopyranose:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-rhamnopyranose + phosphate

 
  L-rhamnopyranose + beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate
 

In the reverse phosphorolysis reaction the enzyme is specific for L-rhamnose as acceptor and beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate as donor.
