Ackermann set theory

Ackermann set theory is a version of axiomatic set theory proposed by Wilhelm Ackermann in 1956.
The language
Ackermann set theory is formulated in first-order logic. The language 
 
 
 
  consists of one binary relation 
 
 
 
  and one constant 
 
 
 
  (Ackermann used a predicate 
 
 
 
 
  instead). We will write 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . The intended interpretation of 
 
 
 
  is that the object 
 
 
 
  is in the class 
 
 
 
 
 . The intended interpretation of 
 
 
 
  is the class of all sets.
The axioms
The axioms of Ackermann set theory, collectively referred to as A, consists of the universal closure of the following formulas in the language 
 
 

1) Axiom of extensionality:



2) Class construction axiom schema: Let 
 
 
 
  be any formula which does not contain the variable 
 
 
 
  free.



3) Reflection axiom schema: Let 
 
 
 
  be any formula which does not contain the constant symbol 
 
 
 
  or the variable 
 
 
 
  free. If 
 
 
 
  then



4) Completeness axioms for 
 
 







5) Axiom of regularity for sets:



Relation to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory
Let 
 
 
 
  be a first-order formula in the language 
 
 
 
  (so 
 
 
 
  does not contain the constant 
 
 
 
 ). Define the "restriction of 
 
 
 
  to the universe of sets" (denoted 
 
 
 
 ) to be the formula which is obtained by recursively replacing all sub-formulas of 
 
 
 
  of the form 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and all sub-formulas of the form 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
In 1959 Azriel Levy proved that if 
 
 
 
  is a formula of 
 
 
 
  and A proves 
 
 
 
 , then ZF proves 
 
 

In 1970 William Reinhardt proved that if 
 
 
 
  is a formula of 
 
 
 
  and ZF proves 
 
 
 
 , then A proves 
 
 
 
 .
Ackermann set theory and Category theory
The most remarkable feature of Ackermann set theory is that, unlike Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, a proper class can be an element of another proper class (see Fraenkel, Bar-Hillel, Levy(1973), p. 153).
An extension (named ARC) of Ackermann set theory was developed by F.A. Muller(2001), who stated that ARC "founds Cantorian set-theory as well as category-theory and therefore can pass as a founding theory of the whole of mathematics".
