   (410777) 2009 FD      (410777) 2009 FD   (410777) 2009 FD ( also written as 2009 FD ) is an Apollo asteroid 1 (a class of near-Earth asteroid ) with an orbit that places it at risk of a possible future collision with Earth . It has the highest impact threat on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale now that it is estimated to be 470 meters in diameter. 2 2009 FD was initially announced as discovered on 16 March 2009 by La Sagra Sky Survey . 3 Because there were previous observations found in images taken by the Spacewatch survey some 3 weeks prior, on 24 February 2009, the Minor Planet Center assigned the discovery credit to Spacewatch under the new discovery assignment rules. 4 5 2009 FD made a close pass to Earth on 27 March 2009 at a distance of 6 7 and another on 24 October 2010 at 0.0702 AU. 8 2009 FD was recovered at apparent magnitude 23 9 on 30 November 2013 by Cerro Paranal Observatory , 10 several months before the close approach of April 2014 when it passed 0.1 AU from Earth. 11 It brightened to roughly apparent magnitude 19.3 around mid-March 2014. 12 One radar Doppler observation of 2009 FD was made in 2014. 13 The October–November 2015 Earth approach will be studied by the Goldstone Deep Space Network . 14  NASA's Near Earth Program originally estimated its size to be 130 metres in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.15. 15 This gave it an estimated mass of around 2,800,000 tonnes. 16 But work by Amy Mainzer using NEOWISE data shows that it could be as large as 472 metres with an albedo as low as 0.01. 17 18 Because 2009 FD (K09F00D) was only detected in two (W1+W2) of the four wavelengths the suspected NEOWISE diameter is more of an upper limit. 19  The JPL Small-Body Database shows that 2009 FD will make two very close approaches in the late 22nd century, with the approach of 29 March 2185 currently having a 1 in 385 chance of impacting Earth. 20 The nominal 2185 Earth approach distance is . 21  Orbit determination for 2190 is complicated by the 2185 close approach. 22 The precise distance that it will pass from Earth and the Moon on 29 March 2185 will determine the 30 March 2190 distance. 2009 FD should pass closer to the Moon than Earth on 29 March 2185. 23 An impact by 2009 FD would cause severe devastation to a large region or tsunamis of significant size. 24 Due to 2009 FD's size, and its interactions with Mars and Venus, which increase its orbital uncertainty over time, it is rated −0.40 on the Palermo Scale , placing it high on the Sentry Risk Table . 25  Past Earth-impact estimates  In January 2011, near-Earth asteroid 2009 FD (with observations through 7 December 2010) was listed on the JPL Sentry Risk Table with a 1 in 435 chance of impacting Earth on 29 March 2185. 26 In 2014 (with observations through 5 February 2014 creating an observation arc of 1807 days) the potential 2185 impact was ruled out. 27 Using the 2014 observations, the Yarkovsky effect has become more significant than the position uncertainties. 28 29 30 The Yarkovsky effect has resulted in the 2185 virtual impactor returning.
