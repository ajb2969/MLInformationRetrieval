Oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol diphosphatase

In enzymology, an oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol + H2O 
 
 
 
  oligosaccharide phosphate + dolichyl phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol and H2O, whereas its two products are oligosaccharide phosphate and dolichyl phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol phosphodolichohydrolase. This enzyme is also called oligosaccharide-diphosphodolichol pyrophosphatase.
