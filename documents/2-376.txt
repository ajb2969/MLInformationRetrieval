   Constant factor rule in differentiation      Constant factor rule in differentiation   In calculus, the constant factor rule in differentiation , also known as The Kutz Rule , allows one to take constants outside a derivative and concentrate on differentiating the function of x itself. This is a part of the linearity of differentiation .  Consider a differentiable function        g   (  x  )    =    k  ⋅  f    (  x  )     .        g  x      normal-⋅  k  f   x     g(x)=k\cdot f(x).   where k is a constant.  Use the formula for differentiation from first principles to obtain:        g  ′    (  x  )    =    lim   h  →  0       g   (   x  +  h   )    -   g   (  x  )     h           superscript  g  normal-′   x     subscript    normal-→  h  0          g    x  h      g  x    h      g^{\prime}(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}           g  ′    (  x  )    =    lim   h  →  0        k  ⋅  f    (   x  +  h   )    -    k  ⋅  f    (  x  )     h           superscript  g  normal-′   x     subscript    normal-→  h  0           normal-⋅  k  f     x  h       normal-⋅  k  f   x    h      g^{\prime}(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{k\cdot f(x+h)-k\cdot f(x)}{h}           g  ′    (  x  )    =    lim   h  →  0      k   (    f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )     )    h           superscript  g  normal-′   x     subscript    normal-→  h  0        k      f    x  h      f  x     h      g^{\prime}(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{k(f(x+h)-f(x))}{h}           g  ′    (  x  )    =   k    lim   h  →  0       f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )     h            superscript  g  normal-′   x     k    subscript    normal-→  h  0          f    x  h      f  x    h       g^{\prime}(x)=k\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}            g  ′    (  x  )    =    k  ⋅   f  ′     (  x  )     .         superscript  g  normal-′   x      normal-⋅  k   superscript  f  normal-′    x     g^{\prime}(x)=k\cdot f^{\prime}(x).     This is the statement of the constant factor rule in differentiation, in Lagrange's notation for differentiation .  In Leibniz's notation , this reads         d   (    k  ⋅  f    (  x  )    )     d  x    =   k  ⋅    d   (   f   (  x  )    )     d  x      .          d     normal-⋅  k  f   x      d  x     normal-⋅  k      d    f  x      d  x       \frac{d(k\cdot f(x))}{dx}=k\cdot\frac{d(f(x))}{dx}.     If we put k =-1 in the constant factor rule for differentiation, we have:         d   (   -  y   )     d  x    =   -    d  y    d  x      .          d    y      d  x          d  y     d  x       \frac{d(-y)}{dx}=-\frac{dy}{dx}.     Comment on proof  Note that for this statement to be true, k must be a constant , or else the k can't be taken outside the limit in the line marked (*).  If k depends on x , there is no reason to think k(x+h) = k(x) . In that case the more complicated proof of the product rule applies.  "  Category:Differentiation rules
