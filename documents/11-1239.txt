Dolichyl-phosphate beta-D-mannosyltransferase




Dolichyl-phosphate beta-D-mannosyltransferase

In enzymology, a dolichyl-phosphate beta-D-mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

GDP-mannose + dolichyl phosphate 
 
 
 
  GDP + dolichyl D-mannosyl phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and dolichyl phosphate, whereas its two products are GDP and dolichyl D-mannosyl phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose:dolichyl-phosphate beta-D-mannosyltransferase. Other names in common use include GDP-Man:DolP mannosyltransferase, dolichyl mannosyl phosphate synthase, dolichyl-phospho-mannose synthase, GDP-mannose:dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase, guanosine diphosphomannose-dolichol phosphate mannosyltransferase, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase, dolichyl phosphate mannosyltransferase, dolichyl-phosphate mannose synthase, GDP-mannose-dolichol phosphate mannosyltransferase, GDP-mannose-dolichylmonophosphate mannosyltransferase, mannosylphosphodolichol synthase, and mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthase. This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis.
