   Succinyldiaminopimelate transaminase      Succinyldiaminopimelate transaminase   In enzymology , a succinyldiaminopimelate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-succinyl-L-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-succinyl-L-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-succinyl-L-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase , and N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelic glutamic transaminase . This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
