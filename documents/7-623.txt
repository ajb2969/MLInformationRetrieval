   Carathéodory–Jacobi–Lie theorem      Carathéodory–Jacobi–Lie theorem   The Carathéodory – Jacobi – Lie theorem is a theorem in symplectic geometry which generalizes Darboux's theorem .  Statement  Let M be a 2 n -dimensional symplectic manifold with symplectic form ω. For p ∈ M and r ≤ n , let f 1 , f 2 , ..., f r be smooth functions defined on an open neighborhood  V of p whose differentials are linearly independent at each point, or equivalently         d   f  1    (  p  )    ∧  …  ∧   d   f  r    (  p  )     ≠  0   ,          d   subscript  f  1   p   normal-…    d   subscript  f  r   p    0    df_{1}(p)\wedge\ldots\wedge df_{r}(p)\neq 0,     where {f i , f j } = 0. (In other words they are pairwise in involution.) Here {–,–} is the Poisson bracket . Then there are functions f r+1 , ..., f n , g 1 , g 2 , ..., g n defined on an open neighborhood U ⊂ V of p such that (f i , g i ) is a symplectic chart of M , i.e., ω is expressed on U as       ω  =     ∑   i  =  1   n    d   f  i     ∧   d   g  i      .      ω      superscript   subscript     i  1    n     d   subscript  f  i       d   subscript  g  i       \omega=\sum_{i=1}^{n}df_{i}\wedge dg_{i}.     Applications  As a direct application we have the following. Given a Hamiltonian system as    (  M  ,  ω  ,  H  )     M  ω  H    (M,\omega,H)   where M is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form   ω   ω   \omega   and H is the Hamiltonian function , around every point where     d  H   ≠  0        d  H   0    dH\neq 0   there is a symplectic chart such that one of its coordinates is H .
