Mannosylglycerate synthase




Mannosylglycerate synthase

Mannosylglycerate synthase () is an enzyme with system name GDP-mannose:D-glycerate 2-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

GDP-mannose + D-glycerate

 
  GDP + 2-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-D-glycerate
 

Depending on conditions mannosylglycerate synthase is more or less specific for the GDP-mannose and D-glycerate.
