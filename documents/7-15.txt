   Runge's theorem      Runge's theorem   (Figure)  Given a holomorphic function f on the blue compact set and a point in each of the holes, one can approximate f as well as desired by rational functions having poles only at those three points.   In complex analysis , Runge's theorem (also known as Runge's approximation theorem ) is named after the German mathematician Carl Runge who first proved it in the year 1885. It states the following:  Denoting by C the set of complex numbers , let K be a compact subset of C and let f be a function which is holomorphic on an open set containing K . If A is a set containing at least one complex number from every bounded  connected component of C \ K then there exists a sequence      (   r  n   )    n  ∈  𝒩      subscript   subscript  r  n     n  𝒩     (r_{n})_{n\in\mathcal{N}}   of rational functions which converges uniformly to f on K and such that all the poles of the functions     (   r  n   )    n  ∈  𝒩      subscript   subscript  r  n     n  𝒩     (r_{n})_{n\in\mathcal{N}}   are in A.  Note that not every complex number in A needs to be a pole of every rational function of the sequence     (   r  n   )    n  ∈  𝒩      subscript   subscript  r  n     n  𝒩     (r_{n})_{n\in\mathcal{N}}   . We merely know that for all members of     (   r  n   )    n  ∈  𝒩      subscript   subscript  r  n     n  𝒩     (r_{n})_{n\in\mathcal{N}}   that do have poles, those poles lie in A .  One aspect that makes this theorem so powerful is that one can choose the set A arbitrarily. In other words, one can choose any complex numbers from the bounded connected components of C \ K and the theorem guarantees the existence of a sequence of rational functions with poles only amongst those chosen numbers.  For the special case in which C \ K is a connected set (in particular when K is simply-connected), the set A in the theorem will clearly be empty. Since rational functions with no poles are simply polynomials , we get the following corollary : If K is a compact subset of C such that C \ K is a connected set, and f is a holomorphic function on K , then there exists a sequence of polynomials    (   p  n   )     subscript  p  n    (p_{n})   that approaches f uniformly on K .  Runge's theorem generalises as follows: if one takes A to be a subset of the Riemann sphere  C ∪{∞} and requires that A intersect also the unbounded connected component of K (which now contains ∞). That is, in the formulation given above, the rational functions may turn out to have a pole at infinity, while in the more general formulation the pole can be chosen instead anywhere in the unbounded connected component of K .  Proof  An elementary proof, given in , proceeds as follows. There is a closed piecewise-linear contour Γ in the open set, containing K in its interior. By Cauchy's integral theorem       f   (  w  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∫   \Beta      f   (  z  )   d  z    z  -  w            f  w       1    2  π  i      subscript   \Beta       f  z  d  z     z  w        f(w)={1\over 2\pi i}\int_{\Beta}{f(z)\,dz\over z-w}     for w in K . Riemann approximating sums can be used to approximate the contour integral uniformly over K . Each term in the sum is a scalar multiple of ( z − w ) −1 for some point z on the contour. This gives a uniform approximation by a rational function with poles on Γ.  To modify this to an approximation with poles at specified points in each component of the complement of K , it is enough to check this for terms of the form ( z − w ) −1 . If z 0 is the point in the same component as z , take a piecewise-linear path from z to z 0 . If two points are sufficiently close on the path, any rational function with poles only at the first point can be expanded as a Laurent series about the second point. That Laurent series can be truncated to give a rational function with poles only at the second point uniformly close to the original function on K . Proceeding by steps along the path from z to z 0 the original function ( z − w ) −1 can be successively modified to give a rational function with poles only at z 0 .  If z 0 is the point at infinity, then by the above procedure the rational function ( z − w ) −1 can first be approximated by a rational function g with poles at R > 0 where R is so large that K lies in w
