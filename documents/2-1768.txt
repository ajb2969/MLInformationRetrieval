   Chern–Simons form      Chern–Simons form   In mathematics , the Chern–Simons forms are certain secondary characteristic classes . They have been found to be of interest in gauge theory , and they (especially the 3-form) define the action of Chern–Simons theory . The theory is named for Shiing-Shen Chern and James Harris Simons , co-authors of a 1974 paper entitled "Characteristic Forms and Geometric Invariants," from which the theory arose. See  Definition  Given a manifold and a Lie algebra valued 1-form ,   𝔸   𝔸   \mathbb{A}   over it, we can define a family of p-forms :  In one dimension, the Chern–Simons  1-form is given by       Tr   [  𝔸  ]    .      Tr   delimited-[]  𝔸     {\rm Tr}[\mathbb{A}].     In three dimensions, the Chern–Simons 3-form is given by       Tr   [     𝔽  ∧  𝔸   -    1  3   𝔸    ∧  𝔸  ∧  𝔸   ]    .      Tr   delimited-[]        𝔽  𝔸       1  3   𝔸    𝔸  𝔸      {\rm Tr}\left[\mathbb{F}\wedge\mathbb{A}-\frac{1}{3}\mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}%
 \wedge\mathbb{A}\right].     In five dimensions, the Chern–Simons 5-form is given by      Tr   [       𝔽  ∧  𝔽  ∧  𝔸   -    1  2   𝔽    ∧  𝔸  ∧  𝔸  ∧  𝔸   +    1  10   𝔸    ∧  𝔸  ∧  𝔸  ∧  𝔸  ∧  𝔸   ]       Tr   delimited-[]            𝔽  𝔽  𝔸       1  2   𝔽    𝔸  𝔸  𝔸       1  10   𝔸    𝔸  𝔸  𝔸  𝔸      {\rm Tr}\left[\mathbb{F}\wedge\mathbb{F}\wedge\mathbb{A}-\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{F}%
 \wedge\mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}+\frac{1}{10}\mathbb{A}\wedge%
 \mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}\right]     where the curvature F is defined as       𝔽  =     d  𝔸   +  𝔸   ∧  𝔸    .      𝔽        d  𝔸   𝔸   𝔸     \mathbb{F}=d\mathbb{A}+\mathbb{A}\wedge\mathbb{A}.     The general Chern–Simons form    ω    2  k   -  1      subscript  ω      2  k   1     \omega_{2k-1}   is defined in such a way that        d   ω    2  k   -  1     =   Tr   (   F  k   )     ,        d   subscript  ω      2  k   1       Tr   superscript  F  k      d\omega_{2k-1}={\rm Tr}\left(F^{k}\right),     where the wedge product is used to define F k . The right-hand side of this equation is proportional to the k -th Chern character of the connection   𝔸   𝔸   \mathbb{A}   .  In general, the Chern–Simons p-form is defined for any odd p . See also gauge theory for the definitions. Its integral over a p -dimensional manifold is a global geometric invariant, and is typically gauge invariant modulo addition of an integer.
