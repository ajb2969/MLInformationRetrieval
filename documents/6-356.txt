   Thouless energy      Thouless energy   The Thouless energy is a characteristic energy scale of diffusive disordered conductors . It is defined by     E  T   =    ℏ  D   /   L  2         subscript  E  T       Planck-constant-over-2-pi  D    superscript  L  2      E_{T}=\hbar D/L^{2}   , where D is the diffusion constant and L the size of the system, and thereby inversely proportional to the diffusion time     t  D   =    L  2   /  D        subscript  t  D      superscript  L  2   D     t_{D}=L^{2}/D   through the system.  It was first introduced by the Scottish-American physicist David J. Thouless when studying Anderson localization , 1 as a measure of the sensitivity of energy levels to a change in the boundary conditions of the system. Though being a classical quantity, it has been shown to play an important role in the quantum-mechanical treatment of disordered systems. 2  References  "  Category:Mesoscopic physics  Category:Condensed matter physics     J.
