It is composed of 5-simplex, truncated 5-simplex, and bitruncated 5-simplex facets in a ratio of 1:1:1.
Its vertex figure is an elongated 5-cell antiprism, two parallel 5-cells in dual configurations, connected by 10 tetrahedral pyramids (elongated 5-cells) from the cell of one side to a point on the other. The vertex figure has 8 vertices and 12 5-cells.
It can be constructed as six sets of parallel hyperplanes that divide space. The hyperplane intersections generate cyclotruncated 5-cell honeycomb divisions on each hyperplane.
