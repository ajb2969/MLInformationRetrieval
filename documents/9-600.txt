   Thermal effusivity      Thermal effusivity   In Thermodynamics , the thermal effusivity of a material is defined as the square root of the product of the material's thermal conductivity and its volumetric heat capacity . 1      e  =    (   k  ρ   c  p    )    1  /  2        e   superscript    k  ρ   subscript  c  p      1  2      e={(k\rho c_{p})}^{1/2}     Here, k is the thermal conductivity,    ρ   ρ   \rho    is the density and     c  p     subscript  c  p    c_{p}    is the specific heat capacity . The product of    ρ   ρ   \rho    and     c  p     subscript  c  p    c_{p}    is known as the volumetric heat capacity .  A material's thermal effusivity is a measure of its ability to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings.  If two semi-infinite bodies initially at temperatures T 1 and T 2 are brought in perfect thermal contact, the temperature at the contact surface T m will be given by their relative effusivities. 2       T  m   =    T  1   +    (    T  2   -   T  1    )     e  2    (    e  2   +   e  1    )           subscript  T  m      subscript  T  1        subscript  T  2    subscript  T  1       subscript  e  2      subscript  e  2    subscript  e  1         T_{m}=T_{1}+(T_{2}-T_{1}){e_{2}\over(e_{2}+e_{1})}     This expression is valid for all times for semi-infinite bodies in perfect thermal contact. It is also a good first guess for the initial contact temperature for finite bodies.
