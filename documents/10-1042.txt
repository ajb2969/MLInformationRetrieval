   Berbamunine synthase      Berbamunine synthase   In enzymology , a berbamunine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-N-methylcoclaurine + (R)-N-methylcoclaurine + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   berbamunine + NADP + + 2 H 2 O   The 5 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-N-methylcoclaurine , (R)-N-methylcoclaurine , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are berbamunine , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-N-methylcoclaurine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C-O phenol-coupling) . This enzyme is also called (S)-N-methylcoclaurine oxidase (C-O phenol-coupling) . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
