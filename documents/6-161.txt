Rijndael mix columns

The MixColumns operation performed by the Rijndael cipher, along with the shift-rows step, is the primary source of diffusion in Rijndael. Each column is treated as a polynomial over GF(28) and is then multiplied modulo 
 
 
 
  with a fixed polynomial 
 
 
 
 ; the inverse of this polynomial is 
 
 
 
 .
MixColumns
The MixColumns step can be performed by multiplying a coordinate vector of four numbers in Rijndael's Galois field by the following circulant MDS matrix:



This can also be seen as the following:












Since this math is done in Rijndael's Galois field, the addition above is actually an exclusive or operation, and multiplication is a complicated operation.
Implementation example
This can be simplified somewhat in actual implementation by replacing the multiply by 2 with a single shift and conditional exclusive or, and replacing a multiply by 3 with a multiply by 2 combined with an exclusive or. A C example of such an implementation follows:
void gmix_column(unsigned char *r) {
         unsigned char a[4];
         unsigned char b[4];
     unsigned char c;
     unsigned char h;
     /* The array 'a' is simply a copy of the input array 'r'
          * The array 'b' is each element of the array 'a' multiplied by 2
          * in Rijndael's Galois field
          * a[n] ^ b[n] is element n multiplied by 3 in Rijndael's Galois field */ 
     for(c=0;c<4;c++) {
         a[c] = r[c];
                 /* h is 0xff if the high bit of r[c] is set, 0 otherwise */
         h = (unsigned char)((signed char)r[c] >> 7); /* arithmetic right shift, thus shifting in either zeros or ones */
         b[c] = r[c] << 1; /* implicitly removes high bit because b[c] is an 8-bit char, so we xor by 0x1b and not 0x11b in the next line */
         b[c] ^= 0x1B & h; /* Rijndael's Galois field */
     }
     r[0] = b[0] ^ a[3] ^ a[2] ^ b[1] ^ a[1]; /* 2 * a0 + a3 + a2 + 3 * a1 */
     r[1] = b[1] ^ a[0] ^ a[3] ^ b[2] ^ a[2]; /* 2 * a1 + a0 + a3 + 3 * a2 */
     r[2] = b[2] ^ a[1] ^ a[0] ^ b[3] ^ a[3]; /* 2 * a2 + a1 + a0 + 3 * a3 */
     r[3] = b[3] ^ a[2] ^ a[1] ^ b[0] ^ a[0]; /* 2 * a3 + a2 + a1 + 3 * a0 */
 }
A C# example
private Byte GMul(Byte a, Byte b) { // Galois Field (256) Multiplication of two Bytes
    Byte p = 0;
    Byte counter;
    Byte hi_bit_set;
    for (counter = 0; counter < 8; counter++) {
       if ((b & 1) != 0) {
          p ^= a;
       }
       hi_bit_set = (Byte) (a & 0x80);
       a <<= 1;
       if (hi_bit_set != 0) {
          a ^= 0x1b; /* x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 */
       }
       b >>= 1;
    }
    return p;
 }
 
 private void MixColumns() { // 's' is the main State matrix, 'ss' is a temp matrix of the same dimensions as 's'.
    Array.Clear(ss, 0, ss.Length); 
 
    for (int c = 0; c < 4; c++) {
       ss[0, c] = (Byte) (GMul(0x02, s[0, c]) ^ GMul(0x03, s[1, c]) ^ s[2, c] ^ s[3, c]);
       ss[1, c] = (Byte) (s[0, c] ^ GMul(0x02, s[1, c]) ^ GMul(0x03, s[2, c]) ^ s[3,c]);
       ss[2, c] = (Byte) (s[0, c] ^ s[1, c] ^ GMul(0x02, s[2, c]) ^ GMul(0x03, s[3, c]));
       ss[3, c] = (Byte) (GMul(0x03, s[0,c]) ^ s[1, c] ^ s[2, c] ^ GMul(0x02, s[3, c]));
    }
 
    ss.CopyTo(s, 0);
 }

Galois Multiplication lookup tables
Commonly, rather than implementing galois multiplication, Rijndael implementations simply use pre-calculated lookup tables to perform the byte multiplication by 2, 3, 9, 11, 13, and 14.
For instance, in C# these tables can be stored in Byte[256] arrays. In order to compute
p * 3
The result is obtained this way:
result = table_3[(int)p]
These lookup tables are as follows:
