   Hydroxylamine oxidase      Hydroxylamine oxidase   In enzymology , a hydroxylamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   hydroxylamine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nitrite + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hydroxylamine and O 2 , whereas its two products are nitrite and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydroxylamine:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include HAO and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism . It employs one cofactor , heme .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
