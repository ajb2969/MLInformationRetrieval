3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase

3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase (, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthetase (AMP-forming), 3-hydroxypropionate-CoA ligase) is an enzyme with system name hydroxypropionate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3-hydroxypropionate + ATP + CoA 
 
 
 
  3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate


This enzyme catalyses a step in the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle.
