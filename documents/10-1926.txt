   4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase      4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate , and two products , 4,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate carboxy-lyase (4,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate-forming) . Other names in common use include gamma-4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase , and 4-carboxymuconolactone carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
