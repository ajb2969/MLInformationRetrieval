The Mumford–Shah functional is a functional that is used to establish an optimality criterion for segmenting an image into sub-regions. An image is modeled as a piecewise-smooth function. The functional penalizes the distance between the model and the input image, the lack of smoothness of the model within the sub-regions, and the length of the boundaries of the sub-regions. By minimizing the functional one may compute the best image segmentation. The functional was proposed by mathematicians David Mumford and Jayant Shah in 1989. 1  Definition of the Mumford–Shah functional  Consider an image I with a domain of definition D , call J the image's model, and call B the boundaries that are associated with the model: the Mumford–Shah functional E [ J , B ] is defined as       E   [  J  ,  B  ]    =    C   ∫     (    I   (   x  →   )    -   J   (   x  →   )     )   2   d   x  →      +   A    ∫   D  /  B        ∇  →   J   (   x  →   )    ⋅   ∇  →    J   (   x  →   )   d   x  →      +   B    ∫  B    d  s            E   J  B        C       superscript      I   normal-→  x      J   normal-→  x     2   d   normal-→  x        A    subscript     D  B       normal-⋅     normal-→  normal-∇   J   normal-→  x     normal-→  normal-∇    J   normal-→  x   d   normal-→  x        B    subscript   B     d  s        E[J,B]=C\int(I(\vec{x})-J(\vec{x}))^{2}d\vec{x}+A\int_{D/B}\vec{\nabla}J(\vec{%
 x})\cdot\vec{\nabla}J(\vec{x})d\vec{x}+B\int_{B}ds     Optimization of the functional may be achieved by approximating it with another functional, as proposed by Ambrosio and Tortorelli. 2  Minimization of the functional  Ambrosio–Tortorelli limit  Ambrosio and Tortorelli 3 showed that Mumford–Shah functional E [ J , B ] can be obtained as the limit of a family of energy functionals E [ J , z ,ε ] where the boundary B is replaced by continuous function z whose magnitude indicates the presence of a boundary. Their analysis show that the Mumford–Shah functional has a well-defined minimum. It also yields an algorithm for estimating the minimum.  The functionals they define have the following form:       E   [  J  ,  z  ;  ϵ  ]    =    C   ∫     (    I   (   x  →   )    -   J   (   x  →   )     )   2   d   x  →      +   A   ∫   z   (   x  →   )     |    ∇  →   J   (   x  →   )    |   2   d   x  →      +   B   ∫    {    ϵ    |    ∇  →   ϕ   (   x  →   )    |   2    +    ϵ   -  1     ϕ  2    (   z   (   x  →   )    )     }   d   x  →             E   J  z  ϵ        C       superscript      I   normal-→  x      J   normal-→  x     2   d   normal-→  x        A      z   normal-→  x    superscript       normal-→  normal-∇   J   normal-→  x     2   d   normal-→  x        B           ϵ   superscript       normal-→  normal-∇   ϕ   normal-→  x     2       superscript  ϵ    1     superscript  ϕ  2     z   normal-→  x       d   normal-→  x         E[J,z;\epsilon]=C\int(I(\vec{x})-J(\vec{x}))^{2}d\vec{x}+A\int z(\vec{x})|\vec%

 +\epsilon^{-1}\phi^{2}(z(\vec{x}))\}d\vec{x}     where ε > 0 is a (small) parameter and ( z ) is a potential function. Two typical choices for ( z ) are           ϕ  1    (  z  )    =    (   1  -  z   )   /  2     z  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  ϕ  1   z       1  z   2      z   0  1      \phi_{1}(z)=(1-z)/2\quad z\in[0,1].   This choice associates the edge set B with the set of points z such that 1 ( z ) ≈ 0            ϕ  2    (  z  )    =   3  z   (   1  -  z   )      z  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  ϕ  2   z     3  z    1  z       z   0  1      \phi_{2}(z)=3z(1-z)\quad z\in[0,1].   This choice associates the edge set B with the set of points z such that 1 ( z ) ≈ ½   The non-trivial step in their deduction is the proof that, as    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\to 0   , the last two terms of the energy function (i.e. the last integral term of the energy functional) converge to the edge set integral ∫ B d s .  The energy functional E [ J , z ,ε ] can be minimized by gradient descent methods , assuring the convergence to a local minimum.
