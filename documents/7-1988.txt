   First moment of area      First moment of area   The first moment of area , sometimes misnamed as the first moment of inertia , is based in the mathematical construct moments in metric spaces , stating that the moment of area equals the summation of area times distance to an axis [Σ( a × d )]. It is a measure of the distribution of the area of a shape in relation to an axis.  First moment of area is commonly used to determine the centroid of an area.  Definition  Given an area, A , of any shape, and division of that area into n number of very small, elemental areas ( dA i ). Let x i and y i be the distances (coordinates) to each elemental area measured from a given x-y axis. Now, the first moment of area in the x and y directions are respectively given by:       S  x   =   A   y  ¯    =    ∑   i  =  1   n      y  i    d   A  i     =    ∫  A    y  d  A           subscript  S  x     A   normal-¯  y           superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  y  i   d   subscript  A  i            subscript   A     y  d  A       S_{x}=A\bar{y}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_{i}\,dA_{i}}=\int_{A}ydA   and       S  y   =    ∑   i  =  1   n      x  i    d   A  i     =    ∫  A    x  d  A           subscript  S  y     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  x  i   d   subscript  A  i            subscript   A     x  d  A       S_{y}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}\,dA_{i}}=\int_{A}xdA   .  The SI unit for first moment of area is a cubic metre ( m 3 ). In the American Engineering and Gravitational systems the unit is a cubic foot ( ft 3 ) or more commonly inch 3 .  The static or statical moment of area , usually denoted by the symbol Q , is a property of a shape that is used to predict its resistance to shear stress . By definition:       Q   j  ,  x    =   ∫    y  i   d  A         subscript  Q   j  x         subscript  y  i   d  A      Q_{j,x}=\int y_{i}dA   , where   Q j,x - the first moment of area "j" about the neutral x axis of the entire body (not the neutral axis of the area "j");  dA - an elemental area of area "j";  y - the perpendicular distance to the element dA from the neutral axis x .   Shear Stress in a Semi-monocoque Structure  The equation for shear flow in a particular web section of the cross-section of a semi-monocoque structure is:      q  =     V  y    S  x     I  x        q       subscript  V  y    subscript  S  x     subscript  I  x      q=\frac{V_{y}S_{x}}{I_{x}}      q - the shear flow through a particular web section of the cross-section  V y - the shear force perpendicular to the neutral axis x through the entire cross-section  S x - the first moment of area about the neutral axis x for a particular web section of the cross-section  I x - the second moment of area about the neutral axis x for the entire cross-section   Shear stress may now be calculated using the following equation:      τ  =   q  t       τ    q  t     {\tau}=\frac{q}{t}         τ   τ   {\tau}   - the shear stress through a particular web section of the cross-section  q - the shear flow through a particular web section of the cross-section  t - the thickness of a particular web section of the cross-section at the point being measured 1   See also   Second moment of area  Polar moment of inertia  Section modulus   References  "  Category:Solid mechanics     Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design, 9th Ed.
