   Highly optimized tolerance      Highly optimized tolerance   In applied mathematics , highly optimized tolerance (HOT) is a method of generating power law behavior in systems by including a global optimization principle. For some systems that display a characteristic scale, a global optimization term could potentially be added that would then yield power law behavior. It has been used to generate and describe internet-like graphs, forest fire models and may also apply to biological systems.  Example  The following is taken from Sornette's book.  Consider a random variable ,   X   X   X   , that takes on values    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   with probability    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   . Furthmore, lets assume for another parameter    r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}          x  i   =   r  i   -  β         subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  r  i     β      x_{i}=r_{i}^{-\beta}   for some fixed   β   β   \beta   . We then want to minimize      L  =    ∑   i  =  0    N  -  1      p  i    x  i         L    superscript   subscript     i  0      N  1       subscript  p  i    subscript  x  i       L=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}p_{i}x_{i}   subject to the constraint        ∑   i  =  0    N  -  1     r  i    =  κ        superscript   subscript     i  0      N  1     subscript  r  i    κ    \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}r_{i}=\kappa   Using Lagrange multipliers , this gives       p  i   ∝   x  i   -   (   1  +   1  /  β    )        proportional-to   subscript  p  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       1    1  β        p_{i}\propto x_{i}^{-(1+1/\beta)}   giving us a power law. The global optimization of minimizing the energy along with the power law dependence between    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   and    r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}   gives us a power law distribution in probability.
