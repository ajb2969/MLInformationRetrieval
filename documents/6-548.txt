Highly optimized tolerance

In applied mathematics, highly optimized tolerance (HOT) is a method of generating power law behavior in systems by including a global optimization principle. For some systems that display a characteristic scale, a global optimization term could potentially be added that would then yield power law behavior. It has been used to generate and describe internet-like graphs, forest fire models and may also apply to biological systems.
Example
The following is taken from Sornette's book.
Consider a random variable, 
 
 
 
 , that takes on values 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 . Furthmore, lets assume for another parameter 
 
 



 
  for some fixed 
 
 
 
 . We then want to minimize


 
  subject to the constraint


 
  Using Lagrange multipliers, this gives


 
  giving us a power law. The global optimization of minimizing the energy along with the power law dependence between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  gives us a power law distribution in probability.
