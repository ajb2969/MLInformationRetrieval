Beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase

Beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase (, beta-carotene 3,3'-monooxygenase, CrtZ) is an enzyme with system name ''beta-carotene,NADH:oxygen 3-oxidoreductase ''.1234567 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

beta-carotene + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 O2

zeaxanthin + 2 NAD+ + 2 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) beta-carotene + NADH + H+ + O2

 
  beta-cryptoxanthin + NAD+ + H2O
 
(1b) beta-cryptoxanthin + NADH + H+ + O2

 
  zeaxanthin + NAD+ + H2O
 

Beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase requires ferredoxin and Fe(II).
