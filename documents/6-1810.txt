   Tate twist      Tate twist   In number theory and algebraic geometry , the Tate twist , 1 named after John Tate , is an operation on Galois modules .  For example, if K is a field , G K is its absolute Galois group , and ρ : G K → Aut Q p ( V ) is a representation of G K on a finite-dimensional vector space  V over the field Q p of p -adic numbers , then the Tate twist of V , denoted V (1), is the representation on the tensor product  V ⊗ Q p (1), where Q p (1) is the p -adic cyclotomic character (i.e. the Tate module of the group of roots of unity in the separable closure K s of K ). More generally, if m is a positive integer , the m th Tate twist of V , denoted V ( m ), is the tensor product of V with the m -fold tensor product of Q p (1). Denoting by Q p (−1) the dual representation of Q p (1), the -m th Tate twist of V can be defined as        V  ⊗   𝐐  p      (   -  1   )     ⊗  m     .       tensor-product  V   subscript  𝐐  p     superscript    1    tensor-product  absent  m      V\otimes\mathbf{Q}_{p}(-1)^{\otimes m}.
