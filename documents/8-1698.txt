   Horizontal eccentricity      Horizontal eccentricity   Horizontal Eccentricity refers to the horizontal axis, measured in degrees, along the visual field. The blind spot extends from an eccentricity d 1 to eccentricity d 2 in temporal direction from the fovea . The size of the blind spot can be calculated as        arctan   (     d  2   -   d  1     d  1    )    -   arctan   (     d  2   -   d  1     d  2    )     .             subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1     subscript  d  1            subscript  d  2    subscript  d  1     subscript  d  2       \arctan\left(\frac{d_{2}-d_{1}}{d_{1}}\right)-\arctan\left(\frac{d_{2}-d_{1}}{%
 d_{2}}\right).     External links   Blind Spot   "  Category:Eye  Category:Vision
