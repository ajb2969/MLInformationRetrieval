   Generalized taxicab number      Generalized taxicab number    In mathematics , the generalized taxicab number  Taxicab ( k , j , n ) is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of j  k th positive powers in n different ways. For k = 3 and j = 2, they coincide with taxicab numbers .       Taxicab   (  1  ,  2  ,  2  )    =  4  =   1  +  3   =   2  +  2.           Taxicab   1  2  2    4         1  3          2  2.      \mathrm{Taxicab}(1,2,2)=4=1+3=2+2.           Taxicab   (  2  ,  2  ,  2  )    =  50  =    1  2   +   7  2    =    5  2   +   5  2     .

Taxicab   (  3  ,  2  ,  2  )    =  1729  =    1  3   +   12  3    =    9  3   +   10  3            Taxicab   3  2  2    1729          superscript  1  3    superscript  12  3            superscript  9  3    superscript  10  3       \mathrm{Taxicab}(3,2,2)=1729=1^{3}+12^{3}=9^{3}+10^{3}   - famously stated by Ramanujan .  Euler showed that        Taxicab   (  4  ,  2  ,  2  )    =  635318657  =    59  4   +   158  4    =    133  4   +   134  4     .

However, Taxicab (5, 2, n ) is not known for any n ≥ 2; no positive integer is known which can be written as the sum of two fifth powers in more than one way. 1  See also   Cabtaxi number   References    External links   Generalised Taxicab Numbers and Cabtaxi Numbers  Taxicab Numbers - 4th powers  Taxicab numbers by Walter Schneider   de:Taxicab-Zahl#Verallgemeinerte Taxicab-Zahl "  Category:Number theory     ↩
