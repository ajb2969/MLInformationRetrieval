Generalized taxicab number


In mathematics, the generalized taxicab number Taxicab(k, j, n) is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of j kth positive powers in n different ways. For k = 3 and j = 2, they coincide with taxicab numbers.








 
  - famously stated by Ramanujan.
Euler showed that



However, Taxicab(5, 2, n) is not known for any n â‰¥ 2; no positive integer is known which can be written as the sum of two fifth powers in more than one way.1
