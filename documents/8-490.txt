   COST Hata model      COST Hata model   The COST Hata model is a radio propagation model that extends the urban Hata model (which in turn is based on the Okumura model ) to cover a more elaborated range of frequencies. It is the most often cited of the COST 231 models (EU funded research project ca. April 1986 – April 1996), 1 also called the Hata Model PCS Extension . 2  COST (COopération européenne dans le domaine de la recherche Scientifique et Technique) is a European Union Forum for cooperative scientific research which has developed this model accordingly to various experiments and researches.  Applicable to / under conditions  This model is applicable to urban areas. To further evaluate Path Loss in Suburban or Rural Quasi-open/Open Areas, this path loss has to be substituted into Urban to Rural/Urban to Suburban Conversions.

Unit: megahertz (MHz)  h B = Base station  antenna  effective height . Unit: meter (m)  d = Link distance. Unit: Kilometer (km)  h R = Mobile station  antenna  effective height . Unit: meter (m)  a(h R ) = Mobile station  antenna height correction factor as described in the Hata model for urban areas .  Points to note  The European Co-operative for Scientific and Technical research (EUROCOST) formed the COST-231 working committee to develop an extended version of the Hata model. COST-231 proposed the following formula to extend Hata's model to 2 GHz. The proposed model for path loss is  L50(urban) = 46.3 + 33.9 log fc – 13.82 log  – a (hre) + (44.9 – 6.55 log ) log d + Cm where a(hre) is the correction factor for effective mobile antenna height which is a function of the size of the coverage area.  0 dB for medium-sized city and suburban areas  Cm =  3 dB for metropolitan centers  The COST-231 extension of the Hata model is restricted to the following  range of parameters:  f : 1500–2000 MHz   :3Om to 200m  hre :lm to lOm  d :lkm to 20 km  Limitations  This model requires that the base station antenna is higher than all adjacent rooftops.
