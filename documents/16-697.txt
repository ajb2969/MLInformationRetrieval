Quantum refereed game

Quantum refereed game in quantum information processing is a class of games in the general theory of quantum games.1 It is played between two players, Alice and Bob, and arbitrated by a referee. The referee outputs the pay-off for the players after interacting with them for a fixed number of rounds, while exchanging quantum information.
Definition
An 

 
 -turn quantum referee performs 
 
 
 
  rounds of interaction with the player Alice and Bob. Each interaction involves receiving some quantum states from Alice and Bob, processing the quantum states together with the "left-over" state from the previous interaction, producing some output state, and sending part of the output state to the players. At the end of the 
 
 
 
  rounds, the referee processes the final state received from the players and decides the pay-off for Alice and Bob.

 , and 
 
 
 
  correspond to their responses. At the end of 
 
 
 
 
  turns, the referee produces an output 
 
 

An 

 
 -turn quantum refereed game consists of an n-turn referee along with functions 
 
 
 
  that maps each measurement output 
 
 
 
  to Alice's and Bob's pay-off.
Individual quantum refereed games may place specific restrictions on strategies Alice and Bob can choose from. For example, in nonlocal games 2 and pseudo-telepathy games,3 Alice and Bob are allowed to share entanglement but are forbidden from communicating. In general, such restrictions may not apply in quantum refereed games.
Zero sum quantum refereed game
Similar to classical zero sum game, a zero sum quantum refereed game4 refers a quantum refereed game with the additional constraint 
 
 
 
 
 .
It is natural to assume Alice and Bob play independent strategies in a zero-sum quantum refereed game, since it cannot simultaneously be to both player's advantage to communicate directly with one another or to initially share an entanglement state {reference}. In this case, Alice's and Bob's strategy can be represented by


 
  and 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  is the set of all n-turn strategies having input space 
 
 
 
  and output space 
 
 
 
 
 .
The combined strategy is then 
 
 
 
 .
Min-Max Theorem
Define 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , then Alice's expected pay-off is 
 
 

The optimal strategy for Alice then lies in the min-max problem


 
 .
The above equality holds because 
 
 
 
  are drawn from compact and convex sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is called the Min-Max Theorem for zero-sum quantum games.
Quantum Interactive Proof with Competing Provers
A quantum interactive proof with two competing provers is a generalization of the single prover quantum interactive proof system.56 It can be modelled by zero-sum refereed games where Alice and Bob are the competing provers, and the referee is the verifier. The referee is assumed to be computationally bounded (polynomial size quantum circuit), whereas Alice and Bob can be computationally unrestricted. Alice, Bob and the referee receive a common string, and after fixed rounds of interactions (exchanging quantum information between the provers and the referee), the referee decides whether Alice wins or Bob wins.
Classical RG
In the classical setting, RG can be viewed as the following problem. Alice, Bob, and the referee is given some statement. Alice is trying to convince the referee that the statement is true while Bob is trying to convince the referee that the statement is false. The referee, who has limited computing power, will look at the proofs provided by Alice and Bob, ask them questions, and at the end of the day decide which player is correct (wins). The goal is for the referee to find an algorithm such that if the statement is true, there is a way for Alice to win with probability greater than 3/4, and if the statement is false, there is a way for Bob to win with probability greater than 3/4.
In the language of complexity theory, a promise problem

 
  has a classical refereed game (classical RG) if there exists a referee described by polynomial time randomized computation, such that

1. for each 
 
 
 
 
 , there is a strategy for Alice to win with probability ≥ 3/4, and
 


2. for each 
 
 
 
 , there is a strategy for Bob to win with probability ≥ 3/4.
 

It is known that RG = EXP.78
QRG
Quantum interactive proof systems with competing provers is a generalization of the classical RG where the referee is now restricted to polynomial-time generated quantum circuits and may exchange quantum information with the players.9 Therefore, QRG can be seen as the following problem. Alice, Bob and the referee is given some statement (it may involve a quantum state). Alice is trying to convince the referee the statement is true while Bob is trying to convince the referee the statement is false. The referee can ask the provers questions via quantum states, receive answers in quantum states, and analyse the received quantum states using a quantum computer. After communicating with Alice and Bob for 
 
 
 
  rounds, the referee decides whether the statement is true or false. If there is a way for the referee to make a correct decision with probability ≥ 3/4, the game is in QRG.
More formally, QRG denotes the complexity class for all promise problems having quantum refereed games defined as follows. Given a string 
 
 
 
 , a promise problem 
 
 
 
  is in QRG if there is a referee represented by a polynomial time generated quantum circuit such that

1. if 
 
 
 
 
 , there exists a strategy for Alice to win with probability ≥ 3/4, and
 
2. if 
 
 
 
 , there exists a strategy for Bob to win with probability ≥ 3/4.
 

It turns out that QRG = EXP — allowing the referee to use quantum circuit and send or receive quantum information does not give the referee any extra power. EXP ⊆ QRG follows from the fact that EXP = RG ⊆ QRG. proved QRG ⊆ EXP by a formulation of QRG using semidefinite programs (SDP).
Semidefinite Program Formulation
For a quantum refereed game, at the end of all the interactions, the referee outputs one of the two possible outcomes 
 
 
 
  to indicate whether Alice wins 
 
 
 
  or Bob wins 
 
 
 
 .
Setting 
 
 
 
 
  results in a quantum refereed game whose value is the maximum winning probability for Alice.
Using the same notation as the zero sum quantum refereed game as above, the referee is represented by operators 
 
 
 
 , Alice may pick a strategy from 
 
 
 
 , and Bob from 
 
 
 
 . Define


 
  , and


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the partial trace operator.
The referee outputs 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  can be considered as a co-strategy that merges Alice's strategy with the referee's.
For any given strategy 
 
 
 
  Alice chooses, the maximum winning probability for Bob is


 
 ,
which, by the property of the strategy representation, is equal to


 
 .
Therefore, to maximize Alice's winning probability, 
 
 
 
 
 , the maximum winning probability for Bob, needs to be minimized over all possible strategies. The goal is then to compute


 
 .
This minimization problem can be expressed by the following SDP problem:10


 
 .
The dimension of the input and output space of this SPD is exponential (from the tensor product states) in 
 
 
 
 , and the SDP has a size polynomial in the dimension of its input and output space. Since there are efficient algorithms that can solve SDP in polynomial-time,111213 it follows that QRG ⊆ EXP.
