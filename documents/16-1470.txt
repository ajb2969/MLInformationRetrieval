   Super-proportional division      Super-proportional division   In the context of fair cake-cutting , a super-proportional division is a division in which each partner receives strictly more than 1/ n of the resource by their own subjective valuation (    V  >   1  /  n       V    1  n     V>1/n   ).  A super-proportional division is better than a proportional division , in which each partner is guaranteed to receive at least 1/ n (    V  ≥   1  /  n       V    1  n     V\geq 1/n   ). However, in contrast to proportional division, a super-proportional division does not always exist. When all partners have exactly the same value functions, the best we can do is give each partner exactly 1/ n .  A necessary condition for the existence of a super-proportional division is, therefore, that not all partners have the same value measure.  A surprising fact is that, when the valuations are additive and non-atomic, this condition is also sufficient. I.e., when there are at least two partners whose value function is even slightly different, then there is a super-proportional division in which all partners receive more than 1/ n .  Conjecture  The existence of a super-proportional division was first conjectured as early as 1948: 1    It may be stated incidentally that if there are two (or more) partners with different estimations, there exists a division giving to everybody more than his due part ( Knaster ); this fact disproves the common opinion that differences estimations make fair division difficult.     Existence proof  The first published proof to the existence of super-proportional division was in 1961. 2 This was a purely existential proof based on Lyapunov's vector measure theorem .  Protocol  A protocol for finding a super-proportional division was presented in 1986. 3  Single piece of disagreement  Let C be the entire cake. The protocol starts with a specific piece of cake, say X ⊆ C , which is valued differently by two partners. Call these partners Alice and Bob.  Let a=V Alice (X) and b=V Bob (X) and assume w.l.o.g. that b>a .  Two pieces of disagreement  Find a rational number between b and a , say p/q such that b > p/q > a . Ask Bob to divide X to p equal parts and divide C \ X to q-p equal parts.  By our assumptions, Bob values each piece of X as more than 1/ q and each piece of C \ X as less than 1/ q . But for Alice, at least one piece of X (say, Y ) must have a value of less than 1/ q and at least one piece of C\X (say, Z ) must have a value of more than 1/ q .  So now we have two pieces, Y and Z , such that:   V Bob (Y)>V Bob (Z)   ''V Alice (Y) Alice  (Z)''    Super-proportional division for two partners  Let Alice and Bob divide the remainder C \ Y \ Z between them in a proportional manner (e.g. using divide and choose ). Add Z to the piece of Alice and add Y to the piece of Bob.  Now each partner thinks that his/her allocation is strictly better than the other allocation, so its value is strictly more than 1/2.  Super-proportional division for n partners  The extension of this protocol to n partners is based on Fink's "Lone Chooser" protocol .  Suppose we already have a super-proportional division to i -1 partners (for i≥3 ). Now partner # i enters the party and we should give him a small piece from each of the first i -1 partners, such that the new division is still super-proportional.  Consider e.g. partner #1. Let d be the difference between partner #1's current value and (1/( i -1)). Because the current division is super-proportional, we know that d>0 .  Choose a positive integer q such that:    d  >   1    (   i  -  1   )   i   (    q   (   i  -  1   )    -  1   )         d    1      i  1   i      q    i  1    1       d>\frac{1}{(i-1)i(q(i-1)-1)}     Ask partner #1 to divide his share to     q  i   -  1        q  i   1    qi-1   pieces which he considers of equal value and let the new partner choose the   q   q   q   pieces which he considers to be the most valuable.  Partner #1 remains with a value of       (    q  i   -  1   )   -  q     q  i   -  1    =     q   (   i  -  1   )    -  1     q  i   -  1                q  i   1   q       q  i   1          q    i  1    1       q  i   1      \frac{(qi-1)-q}{qi-1}=\frac{q(i-1)-1}{qi-1}   of his previous value, which was     1   i  -  1    +  d        1    i  1    d    \frac{1}{i-1}+d   (by definition of d ). The first element becomes      q   (   i  -  1   )    -  1     (   i  -  1   )    (    q  i   -  1   )            q    i  1    1       i  1       q  i   1      \frac{q(i-1)-1}{(i-1)(qi-1)}   and the d becomes    1   i   (   i  -  1   )    (    q  i   -  1   )        1    i    i  1       q  i   1      \frac{1}{i(i-1)(qi-1)}   ; summing them up gives that the new value is more than       (    q  i   -  1   )    (   i  -  1   )      (   i  -  1   )   i   (    q  i   -  1   )     =   1  i               q  i   1     i  1        i  1   i      q  i   1       1  i     \frac{(qi-1)(i-1)}{(i-1)i(qi-1)}=\frac{1}{i}   of the entire cake.  As for the new partner, after having taken q pieces from each of the first i -1 partners, his total value is at least     q    q  i   -  1    >   1  i         q      q  i   1      1  i     \frac{q}{qi-1}>\frac{1}{i}   of the entire cake.  This proves that the new division is also super-proportional.  References  "  Category:Fair division  Category:Fair division protocols     ↩  , Corollary 1.2 ↩  ↩
