   Biotin—CoA ligase      Biotin—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a biotin-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + biotin + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + biotinyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , biotin , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and biotinyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is biotin:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include biotinyl-CoA synthetase , biotin CoA synthetase , and biotinyl coenzyme A synthetase . This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism .
