   (RS)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase      (RS)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a (RS)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (RS)-norcoclaurine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (RS)-coclaurine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and (R,S)-norcoclaurine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (R,S)-coclaurine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(RS)-norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
