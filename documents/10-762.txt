(cytochrome c)-arginine N-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a [cytochrome c]-arginine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [cytochrome c]-arginine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [cytochrome c]-Nomega-methyl-arginine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and cytochrome c-arginine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and cytochrome c-Nomega-methyl-arginine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[cytochrome c]-arginine Nomega-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[cytochrome c]-arginine, and omega-N-methyltransferase.
