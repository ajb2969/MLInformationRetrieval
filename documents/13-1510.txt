   Set function      Set function   In mathematics, a set function is a function whose input is a set. The output is usually a number. Often the input is a set of real numbers , a set of points in Euclidean space , or a set of points in some measure space .  Examples  Examples of set functions include:   The function that assigns to each set its cardinality , i.e. the number of members of the set, is a set function.  The function           d   (  A  )    =    lim   n  →  ∞      |   A  ∩   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }    |   n     ,        d  A     subscript    normal-→  n           A   1  normal-…  n     n      d(A)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{|A\cap\{1,\dots,n\}|}{n},       assigning densities to sufficiently well-behaved subsets A ⊆ {1, 2, 3, ...}, is a set function.    The Lebesgue measure is a set function that assigns a non-negative real number to each set of real numbers. (Kolmogorov and Fomin 1975)  A probability measure assigns a probability to each set in a σ-algebra . Specifically, the probability of the empty set is zero and the probability of the sample space is 1, with other sets given probabilities between 0 and 1.  A possibility measure assigns a number between zero and one to each set in the powerset of some given set. See Possibility theory .  A Random set is a set-valued random variable .
