(pyruvate kinase)-phosphatase

In enzymology, a [pyruvate kinase]-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

[pyruvate kinase] phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  [pyruvate kinase] + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyruvate kinase phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are pyruvate kinase and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase]-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called pyruvate kinase phosphatase.
