   Tate curve      Tate curve   In mathematics, the Tate curve is a curve defined over the ring of formal power series     ℤ   [   [  q  ]   ]       ℤ   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  q      \mathbb{Z}[[q]]   with integer coefficients. Over the open subscheme where q is invertible, the Tate curve is an elliptic curve . The Tate curve can also be defined for q as an element of a complete field of norm less than 1, in which case the formal power series converge.  The Tate curve was introduced by  in a 1959 manuscript originally titled "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves Over Complete Fields"; he did not publish his results until many years later, and his work first appeared in .  Definition  The Tate curve is the projective plane curve over the ring Z [ [ q ]] of formal power series with integer coefficients given (in an affine open subset of the projective plane) by the equation        y  2   +   x  y    =    x  3   +    a  4   x   +   a  6           superscript  y  2     x  y       superscript  x  3      subscript  a  4   x    subscript  a  6      y^{2}+xy=x^{3}+a_{4}x+a_{6}   where       -   a  4    =   5    ∑  n      n  3    q  n     1  -   q  n       =    5  q   +   45   q  2    +   140   q  3    +  ⋯            subscript  a  4      5    subscript   n        superscript  n  3    superscript  q  n      1   superscript  q  n                5  q     45   superscript  q  2      140   superscript  q  3    normal-⋯      -a_{4}=5\sum_{n}\frac{n^{3}q^{n}}{1-q^{n}}=5q+45q^{2}+140q^{3}+\cdots          -   a  6    =    ∑  n       7   n  5    +   5   n  3     12   ×    q  n    1  -   q  n       =   q  +   23   q  2    +   154   q  3    +  ⋯            subscript  a  6      subscript   n           7   superscript  n  5      5   superscript  n  3     12      superscript  q  n     1   superscript  q  n              q    23   superscript  q  2      154   superscript  q  3    normal-⋯      -a_{6}=\sum_{n}\frac{7n^{5}+5n^{3}}{12}\times\frac{q^{n}}{1-q^{n}}=q+23q^{2}+1%

 }w}{(1-t^{m}w)^{2}}   and taking powers of q to the point at infinity of the elliptic curve. The series x ( w ) and y ( w ) are not formal power series in w .  Properties  The j-invariant of the Tate curve is given by a power series in q with leading term q −1 . 2 Over a p -adic local field , therefore, j is non-integral and the Tate curve has semistable reduction of multiplicative type. Conversely, every semistable elliptic curve over a local field is isomorphic to a Tate curve (up to quadratic twist ). 3  References          "  Category:Elliptic curves     Manin & Panchishkin (2007) p.220 ↩  Silverman (1994) p.423 ↩  Manin & Panchiskin (2007) p.300 ↩
