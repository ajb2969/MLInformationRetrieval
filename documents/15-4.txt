Tate curve

In mathematics, the Tate curve is a curve defined over the ring of formal power series

 
  with integer coefficients. Over the open subscheme where q is invertible, the Tate curve is an elliptic curve. The Tate curve can also be defined for q as an element of a complete field of norm less than 1, in which case the formal power series converge.
The Tate curve was introduced by  in a 1959 manuscript originally titled "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves Over Complete Fields"; he did not publish his results until many years later, and his work first appeared in .
Definition
The Tate curve is the projective plane curve over the ring Z[[q]] of formal power series with integer coefficients given (in an affine open subset of the projective plane) by the equation


 
  where





 
  are power series with integer coefficients.1
The Tate curve over a complete field
Suppose that the field k is complete with respect to some absolute value ||, and q is a non-zero element of the field k with |q|*/qZ to this elliptic curve, taking w to (x(w),y(w)) for w not a power of q, where





 
  and taking powers of q to the point at infinity of the elliptic curve. The series x(w) and y(w) are not formal power series in w.
Properties
The j-invariant of the Tate curve is given by a power series in q with leading term qâˆ’1.2 Over a p-adic local field, therefore, j is non-integral and the Tate curve has semistable reduction of multiplicative type. Conversely, every semistable elliptic curve over a local field is isomorphic to a Tate curve (up to quadratic twist).3
