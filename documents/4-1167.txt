Multivariate gamma function

In mathematics, the multivariate gamma function, Γp(·), is a generalization of the gamma function. It is useful in multivariate statistics, appearing in the probability density function of the Wishart and inverse Wishart distributions.
It has two equivalent definitions. One is


 
  where S>0 means S is positive-definite. The other one, more useful in practice, is


 
  From this, we have the recursive relationships:



Thus











and so on.
Derivatives
We may define the multivariate digamma function as


 
  and the general polygamma function as



Calculation steps

Since








it follows that
 
 





By definition of the digamma function, ψ,










it follows that
