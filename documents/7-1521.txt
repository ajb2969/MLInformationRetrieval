Factorization lemma

In measure theory, the factorization lemma allows us to express a function f with another function T if f is measurable with respect to T. An application of this is regression analysis.
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a function of a set 
 
 
 
  in a measure space

 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a scalar function on 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
  is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra

 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  if and only if there exists a measurable function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Borel set of the real numbers. If 
 
 
 
  only takes finite values, then 
 
 
 
  also only takes finite values.
Proof
First, if 
 
 
 
 , then f is 
 
 
 
 
  measurable because it is the composition of a 
 
 
 
  and of a 
 
 
 
  measurable function. The proof of the converse falls into four parts: (1)f is a step function, (2)f is a positive function, (3) f is any scalar function, (4) f only takes finite values.
f is a step function
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a step function, i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . As T is a measurable function, for all i, there exists 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  fulfils the requirements.
f takes only positive values
If f takes only positive values, it is the limit of a sequence 
 
 
 
  of step functions. For each of these, by (1), there exists 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  fulfils the requirements.
General case
We can decompose f in a positive part 
 
 
 
  and a negative part 
 
 
 
 . We can then find 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The problem is that the difference 
 
 
 
  is not defined on the set 
 
 
 
 
 . Fortunately, 
 
 
 
  because 
 
 
 
  always implies 
 
 
 
  We define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  fulfils the requirements.
f takes finite values only
If f takes finite values only, we will show that g also only takes finite values. Let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  fulfils the requirements because 
 
 
 
 .
Importance of the measure space
If the function 
 
 
 
 
  is not scalar, but takes values in a different measurable space, such as 
 
 
 
  with its trivial σ-algebra (the empty set, and the whole real line) instead of 
 
 
 
 , then the lemma becomes false (as the restrictions on 
 
 
 
  are much weaker).
