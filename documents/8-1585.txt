   Hall algebra      Hall algebra   In mathematics , the Hall algebra is an associative algebra with a basis corresponding to isomorphism classes of finite abelian p -groups . It was first discussed by E.  but forgotten until it was rediscovered by , both of whom published no more than brief summaries of their work. The Hall polynomials are the structure constants of the Hall algebra . The Hall algebra plays an important role in the theory of Kashiwara ‚Äì Lusztig 's canonical bases in quantum groups .  generalized Hall algebras to more general categories , such as the category of representations of a quiver .  Construction  A finite  abelian  p -group  M is a direct sum of cyclic  p -power components     C   p   Œª  i     ,     subscript  C   superscript  p   subscript  Œª  i      C_{p^{\lambda_{i}}},   where    Œª  =   (   Œª  1   ,   Œª  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  )       Œª    subscript  Œª  1    subscript  Œª  2   normal-‚Ä¶     \lambda=(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots)   is a partition of   n   n   n   called the type of M . Let     g   Œº  ,  ŒΩ   Œª    (  p  )        subscript   superscript  g  Œª    Œº  ŒΩ    p    g^{\lambda}_{\mu,\nu}(p)   be the number of subgroups N of M such that N has type   ŒΩ   ŒΩ   \nu   and the quotient M/N has type   Œº   Œº   \mu   . Hall proved that the functions g are polynomial functions of p with integer coefficients. Thus we may replace p with an indeterminate q , which results in the Hall polynomials         g   Œº  ,  ŒΩ   Œª    (  q  )    ‚àà   ‚Ñ§   [  q  ]     .         subscript   superscript  g  Œª    Œº  ŒΩ    q     ‚Ñ§   delimited-[]  q      g^{\lambda}_{\mu,\nu}(q)\in\mathbb{Z}[q].\,     Hall next constructs an associative ring    H   H   H   over    ‚Ñ§   [  q  ]       ‚Ñ§   delimited-[]  q     \mathbb{Z}[q]   , now called the Hall algebra . This ring has a basis consisting of the symbols    u  Œª     subscript  u  Œª    u_{\lambda}   and the structure constants of the multiplication in this basis are given by the Hall polynomials:         u  Œº    u  ŒΩ    =    ‚àë  Œª     g   Œº  ,  ŒΩ   Œª    (  q  )    u  Œª      .         subscript  u  Œº    subscript  u  ŒΩ      subscript   Œª      subscript   superscript  g  Œª    Œº  ŒΩ    q   subscript  u  Œª       u_{\mu}u_{\nu}=\sum_{\lambda}g^{\lambda}_{\mu,\nu}(q)u_{\lambda}.\,     It turns out that H is a commutative ring, freely generated by the elements    u   ùüè  n      subscript  u   superscript  1  n     u_{\mathbf{1}^{n}}   corresponding to the elementary p -groups . The linear map from H to the algebra of symmetric functions defined on the generators by the formula       u   ùüè  n    ‚Ü¶    q   -    n   (   n  -  1   )    /  2       e  n        maps-to   subscript  u   superscript  1  n       superscript  q        n    n  1    2      subscript  e  n      u_{\mathbf{1}^{n}}\mapsto q^{-n(n-1)/2}e_{n}\,     (where e n is the n th elementary symmetric function ) uniquely extends to a ring homomorphism and the images of the basis elements    u  Œª     subscript  u  Œª    u_{\lambda}   may be interpreted via the Hall‚ÄìLittlewood symmetric functions . Specializing q to 1, these symmetric functions become Schur functions , which are thus closely connected with the theory of Hall polynomials.
