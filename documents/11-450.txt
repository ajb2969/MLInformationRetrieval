Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate esterase




Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate esterase

In enzymology, a bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2-ethylhexyl phthalate + 2-ethylhexan-1-ol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and H2O, whereas its two products are 2-ethylhexyl phthalate and 2-ethylhexan-1-ol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate acylhydrolase. This enzyme is also called DEHP esterase.
