   Resistance force      Resistance force   In physics , resistance force is the force which an effort force must overcome in order to do work on an object via a simple machine . Resistance force, like most other forces, is measured in newtons or in pounds-force .  For an ideal ( frictionless ) mechanism in which no energy is lost, resistance force obeys the relation:       R  ×   D  R    =   E  ×   D  E          R   subscript  D  R      E   subscript  D  E      R\times D_{R}=E\times D_{E}     where:   R equals resistance force  D R equals resistance distance   E equals effort force   D E equals effort distance    Resistance force is used to calculate the work output using the following equation:       W  o  r   k   o  u  t  p  u  t   =   R  ×   D  R          W  o  r  k  o  u  t  p  u  t     R   subscript  D  R      Work\,output=R\times D_{R}     "  Category:Force
