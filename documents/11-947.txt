Lysyltransferase




Lysyltransferase

In enzymology, a lysyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-lysyl-tRNA + phosphatidylglycerol 
 
 
 
  tRNA + 3-phosphatidyl-1'-(3'-O-L-lysyl)glycerol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-lysyl-tRNA and phosphatidylglycerol, whereas its two products are tRNA and 3-phosphatidyl-1'-(3'-O-L-lysyl)glycerol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the aminoacyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysyl-tRNA:phosphatidylglycerol 3-O-lysyltransferase.
