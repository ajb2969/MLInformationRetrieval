Leeson's equation

Leeson's equation is an empirical expression that describes an oscillator's phase noise spectrum.
Leeson's expression1 for single-sideband (SSB) phase noise in dBc/Hz (decibels relative to output level per Hertz) is2




where f0 is the output frequency, Ql is the loaded Q, fm is the offset from the output frequency (Hz), fc is the 1/f corner frequency, F is the noise factor of the amplifier, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature in Kelvins, and Ps is the oscillator output power.

Niknejad, Oscillator Phase Noise, University of California, Berkeley, 2009 http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/ee242/pdf/eecs242_lect22_phasenoise.pdf, stating "Leeson modified the above noise model to account for several experimentally observed phenomena". Also, "In Leeson’s model, the factor F is a fitting parameter rather than arising from any physical concepts. It’s tempting to call this the oscillator "noise figure", but this is misleading."
