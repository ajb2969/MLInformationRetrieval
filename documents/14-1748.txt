   Leeson's equation      Leeson's equation   Leeson's equation is an empirical expression that describes an oscillator 's phase noise spectrum.  Leeson's expression 1 for single-sideband (SSB) phase noise in dBc/Hz (decibels relative to output level per Hertz) is 2       L   (   f  m   )    =   10   log   [    1  2    (     (    f  0    2   Q  l    f  m     )   2   +  1   )    (     f  c    f  m    +  1   )    (    F  k  T    P  s    )    ]           L   subscript  f  m      10        1  2      superscript     subscript  f  0     2   subscript  Q  l    subscript  f  m     2   1        subscript  f  c    subscript  f  m    1       F  k  T    subscript  P  s         L(f_{m})=10\log\bigg[\frac{1}{2}\bigg(\bigg(\frac{f_{0}}{2Q_{l}f_{m}}\bigg)^{2%
 }+1\bigg)\bigg(\frac{f_{c}}{f_{m}}+1\bigg)\bigg(\frac{FkT}{P_{s}}\bigg)\bigg]      where f 0 is the output frequency, Q l is the loaded Q, f m is the offset from the output frequency (Hz), f c is the 1/ f corner frequency, F is the noise factor of the amplifier, k is Boltzmann's constant , T is absolute temperature in Kelvins, and P s is the oscillator output power.

Also, "In Leeson’s model, the factor F is a fitting parameter rather than arising from any physical concepts. It’s tempting to call this the oscillator "noise figure", but this is misleading."
