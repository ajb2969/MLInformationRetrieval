Gentamicin 3'-N-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a gentamicin 3'-N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + gentamicin C $\rightleftharpoons$ CoA + N3'-acetylgentamicin C
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and gentamicin C, whereas its two products are CoA and N3'-acetylgentamicin C.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:gentamicin-C N3'-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include gentamicin acetyltransferase I, aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(3)-1, gentamicin 3'-N-acetyltransferase, and acetyl-CoA:gentamicin-C N3'-acetyltransferase.
