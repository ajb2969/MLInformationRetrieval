Residue at infinity

In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the residue at infinity is a residue of a holomorphic function on an annulus having an infinite external radius. The infinity

 
  is a point added to the local space 
 
 
 
  in order to render it compact (in this case it is a one-point compactification). This space noted 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere.1 One can use the residue at infinity to calculate some integrals.
Definition
Given a holomorphic function f on an annulus

 
  (centered at 0, with inner radius 
 
 
 
  and infinite outer radius), the residue at infinity of the function f can be defined in terms of the usual residue as follows:



Thus, one can transfer the study of 
 
 
 
  at infinity to the study of 
 
 
 
  at the origin.
Note that 
 
 
 
 , we have
