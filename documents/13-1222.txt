   Simon–Glatzel equation      Simon–Glatzel equation   The Simon–Glatzel equation 1 is an empirical correlation describing the pressure dependence of the melting temperature . The pressure dependence of the melting temperature is small for small pressure changes because the volume change during fusion or melting is rather small. But very high pressures have a significant effect because the liquid has (normally) a larger volume than the solid and a higher pressure makes the melting thermodynamically unfavorable and leads therefore to a higher melting temperature. If the liquid has a smaller volume than the solid (as for ice and liquid water) a higher pressure leads to a lower melting point.  The equation       T  M   =    T   R  e  f      (      P  M   -   P   R  e  f     a   +  1   )    1  c          subscript  T  M      subscript  T    R  e  f     superscript         subscript  P  M    subscript  P    R  e  f     a   1     1  c       T_{M}=T_{Ref}\left(\frac{P_{M}-P_{Ref}}{a}+1\right)^{\frac{1}{c}}     T Ref and P Ref are normally the temperature and the pressure of the triple point , but the normal melting temperature at atmospheric pressure are also commonly used as reference point because the normal melting point is much easier accessible. Typically P Ref is then set to 0. a and c are adjustable and component specific parameters.  Example parameters  For Methanol the following parameters 2 can be obtained:      a   188158   kPa     a   188.158   MPa     c   5.15905     T min   174.61   K     T max   228.45   K     P max   575000   kPa     P max   575.000   MPa     The reference temperature has been T Ref = T M = 174.61 K and the reference pressure P Ref has been set to 0 kPa.  Methanol is a component where the Simon-Glatzel works well in the given validity range. The Simon–Glatzel equation cannot be used if the melting curve is falling or has maximums. 3  References  "  Category:Phase transitions  Category:Equations     Simon F. E., Glatzel G., Z. Anorg.
