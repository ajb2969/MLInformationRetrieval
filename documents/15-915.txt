All-trans-zeta-carotene desaturase

All-trans-zeta-carotene desaturase (, Crtlb, phytoene desaturase (ambiguous), 2-step phytoene desaturase (ambiguous), two-step phytoene desaturase (ambiguous), CrtI (ambiguous)) is an enzyme with system name all-trans-zeta-carotene:acceptor oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

all-trans-zeta-carotene + 2 acceptor 
 
 
all-trans-lycopene + 2 reduced acceptor (overall reaction)
 
(1a) all-trans-zeta-carotene + acceptor 
 
 
all-trans-neurosporene + reduced acceptor
 
(1b) all-trans-neurosporene + acceptor 
 
 
 
  all-trans-lycopene + reduced acceptor
 

This enzyme is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis.
