   Local homeomorphism      Local homeomorphism   In mathematics , more specifically topology , a local homeomorphism is intuitively a function , f , between topological spaces that preserves local structure.  Formal definition  Let X and Y be topological spaces . A function     f  :   X  →   Y       normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y\,   is a local homeomorphism 1 if for every point x in X there exists an open set  U containing x , such that the image     f   (  U  )       f  U    f(U)   is open in Y and the restriction       f  |   U   :   U  →   f   (  U  )        normal-:   evaluated-at  f  U    normal-→  U    f  U      f|_{U}:U\to f(U)\,   is a homeomorphism .  Examples  By definition, every homeomorphism is also a local homeomorphism .  If U is an open subset of Y equipped with the subspace topology , then the inclusion map i : U → Y is a local homeomorphism. Openness is essential here: the inclusion map of a non-open subset of Y never yields a local homeomorphism.  Every covering map is a local homeomorphism; in particular, the universal cover  p : C → Y of a space Y is a local homeomorphism. In certain situations the converse is true. For example : if X is Haudorff and Y is locally compact and Hausdorff and p : X → Y is a proper local homeomorphism, then p is a covering map.  Let f : S 1 → S 1 be the map that wraps the circle around itself n times (i.e. has winding number  n ). This is a local homeomorphism for all non-zero n , but a homeomorphism only in the cases where it is bijective , i.e. n = 1 or -1.  It is shown in complex analysis that a complex analytic function f gives a local homeomorphism precisely when the derivative  f ′( z ) is non-zero for all z in the domain of f . The function f ( z ) = z n on an open disk around 0 is not a local homeomorphism at 0 when n is at least 2. In that case 0 is a point of " ramification " (intuitively, n sheets come together there).  Properties  Every local homeomorphism is a continuous and open map . A bijective local homeomorphism is therefore a homeomorphism.  A local homeomorphism f : X → Y preserves "local" topological properties:   X is locally connected if and only if f ( X ) is  X is locally path-connected if and only if f ( X ) is  X is locally compact if and only if f ( X ) is  X is first-countable if and only if f ( X ) is   If f : X → Y is a local homeomorphism and U is an open subset of X , then the restriction f | U is also a local homeomorphism.  If f : X → Y and g : Y → Z are local homeomorphisms, then the composition gf : X → Z is also a local homeomorphism.  The local homeomorphisms with codomain  Y stand in a natural 1-1 correspondence with the sheaves of sets on Y . Furthermore, every continuous map with codomain Y gives rise to a uniquely defined local homeomorphism with codomain Y in a natural way. All of this is explained in detail in the article on sheaves .  See also   Local diffeomorphism   References  "  Category:Homeomorphisms  Category:General topology     ↩
