   Gaussian measure      Gaussian measure   In mathematics , Gaussian measure is a Borel measure on finite-dimensional Euclidean space  R n , closely related to the normal distribution in statistics . There is also a generalization to infinite-dimensional spaces. Gaussian measures are named after the German  mathematician  Carl Friedrich Gauss . One reason why Gaussian measures are so ubiquitous in probability theory is the Central Limit Theorem . Loosely speaking, it states that if a random variable X is obtained by summing a large number N of independent random variables of order 1, then X is of order    N      N    \sqrt{N}   and its law is approximately Gaussian.  Definitions  Let n ∈ N and let B 0 ( R n ) denote the completion of the Borel σ -algebra on R n . Let λ n : B 0 ( R n ) → [0, +∞] denote the usual n -dimensional Lebesgue measure . Then the standard Gaussian measure  γ n : B 0 ( R n ) → [0, 1] is defined by        γ  n    (  A  )    =    1     2  π    n      ∫  A     exp   (   -    1  2     ∥  x  ∥    ℝ  n   2     )    d   λ  n    (  x  )             superscript  γ  n   A       1   superscript      2  π    n      subscript   A             1  2    superscript   subscript   norm  x    superscript  ℝ  n    2      normal-d   superscript  λ  n   x       \gamma^{n}(A)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}^{n}}\int_{A}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\|x\|_{%
 \mathbb{R}^{n}}^{2}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\lambda^{n}(x)     for any measurable set A ∈ B 0 ( R n ). In terms of the Radon–Nikodym derivative ,          d   γ  n     d   λ  n      (  x  )    =    1     2  π    n     exp   (   -    1  2     ∥  x  ∥    ℝ  n   2     )      .            normal-d   superscript  γ  n      normal-d   superscript  λ  n     x       1   superscript      2  π    n            1  2    superscript   subscript   norm  x    superscript  ℝ  n    2         \frac{\mathrm{d}\gamma^{n}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda^{n}}(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}^{n}%

More generally, the Gaussian measure with mean  μ ∈ R n and variance  σ 2 > 0 is given by         γ   μ  ,   σ  2    n    (  A  )    :=    1     2  π   σ  2     n      ∫  A     exp   (   -    1   2   σ  2       ∥   x  -  μ   ∥    ℝ  n   2     )    d   λ  n    (  x  )       .     assign     superscript   subscript  γ   μ   superscript  σ  2     n   A       1   superscript      2  π   superscript  σ  2     n      subscript   A             1    2   superscript  σ  2      superscript   subscript   norm    x  μ     superscript  ℝ  n    2      normal-d   superscript  λ  n   x       \gamma_{\mu,\sigma^{2}}^{n}(A):=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}^{n}}\int_{A}%

The Dirac measure  δ μ is the weak limit of    γ   μ  ,   σ  2    n     superscript   subscript  γ   μ   superscript  σ  2     n    \gamma_{\mu,\sigma^{2}}^{n}   as σ → 0, and is considered to be a degenerate Gaussian measure ; in contrast, Gaussian measures with finite, non-zero variance are called non-degenerate Gaussian measures .  Properties of Gaussian measure  The standard Gaussian measure γ n on R n   is a Borel measure (in fact, as remarked above, it is defined on the completion of the Borel sigma algebra, which is a finer structure);  is equivalent to Lebesgue measure     λ  n   ≪   γ  n   ≪   λ  n        much-less-than   superscript  λ  n    superscript  γ  n     much-less-than     superscript  λ  n      \lambda^{n}\ll\gamma^{n}\ll\lambda^{n}   , where   ≪   much-less-than   \ll   stands for absolute continuity of measures;  is supported on all of Euclidean space: supp( γ n ) = R n ;  is a probability measure ( γ n ( R n ) = 1), and so it is locally finite ;  is strictly positive : every non-empty open set has positive measure;  is inner regular : for all Borel sets A ,            γ  n    (  A  )    =   sup   {    γ  n    (  K  )    |   K  ⊆   A  ,   K  is compact     }     ,         superscript  γ  n   A    supremum   conditional-set     superscript  γ  n   K     K   A    K  is compact         \gamma^{n}(A)=\sup\{\gamma^{n}(K)|K\subseteq A,K\mbox{ is compact}\},        so Gaussian measure is a Radon measure ;   is not translation - invariant , but does satisfy the relation             d    (   T  h   )   *    (   γ  n   )     d   γ  n      (  x  )    =   exp   (     ⟨  h  ,  x  ⟩    ℝ  n    -    1  2     ∥  h  ∥    ℝ  n   2     )     ,            normal-d   subscript   subscript  T  h      superscript  γ  n      normal-d   superscript  γ  n     x        subscript   h  x    superscript  ℝ  n        1  2    superscript   subscript   norm  h    superscript  ℝ  n    2        \frac{\mathrm{d}(T_{h})_{*}(\gamma^{n})}{\mathrm{d}\gamma^{n}}(x)=\exp\left(%

Even so, it is possible to define Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional spaces, the main example being the abstract Wiener space construction. A Borel measure γ on a separable  Banach space  E is said to be a non-degenerate (centered) Gaussian measure if, for every linear functional  L ∈ E ∗ except L = 0, the push-forward measure  L ∗ ( γ ) is a non-degenerate (centered) Gaussian measure on R in the sense defined above.  For example, classical Wiener measure on the space of continuous  paths is a Gaussian measure.
