   Induced homomorphism (algebraic topology)      Induced homomorphism (algebraic topology)   In mathematics , especially in the area of topology known as algebraic topology , an induced homomorphism is a way of relating the algebraic invariants of topological spaces which are already related by a continuous function . 1 Such homomorphisms exist whenever the algebraic invariants are functorial . For example, they exist for fundamental groups , higher homotopy groups , singular homology , and De Rham cohomology . For the more categorical approach, see induced homomorphism , and for the specific case of fundamental groups, see induced homomorphism (fundamental group) .  Definitions  A continuous function    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   between topological spaces (possibly with some additional structure) induces homomorphisms between various algebraic structures associated with   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   , respectively.  Examples  A useful example is the induced homomorphism of fundamental groups . Likewise there are induced homomorphisms of higher homotopy groups and homology groups .  Any homology theory comes with induced homomorphisms. For instance, simplicial homology , singular homology , and Borel-Moore homology all have induced homomorphisms. Similarly, any cohomology comes induced homomorphisms. For instance, Čech cohomology , de Rham cohomology , and singular cohomology all have induced homomorphisms. Generalizations such as cobordism also have induced homomorphisms.  References  "  Category:Algebraic topology     ↩
