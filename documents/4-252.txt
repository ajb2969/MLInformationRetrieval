Torus bundle

In mathematics, in the sub-field of geometric topology, a torus bundle is a kind of surface bundle over the circle, which in turn are a class of three-manifolds.
Construction
To obtain a torus bundle: let 
 
 
 
  be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the two-dimensional torus

 
  to itself. Then the three-manifold 
 
 
 
  is obtained by

taking the Cartesian product of 
 
 
 
  and the unit interval and
gluing one component of the boundary of the resulting manifold to the other boundary component via the map 
 
 
 
 .

Then 
 
 
 
  is the torus bundle with monodromy

 
 .
Examples
For example, if 
 
 
 
  is the identity map (i.e., the map which fixes every point of the torus) then the resulting torus bundle 
 
 
 
  is the three-torus: the Cartesian product of three circles.
Seeing the possible kinds of torus bundles in more detail requires an understanding of William Thurston's geometrization program. Briefly, if 
 
 
 
  is finite order, then the manifold 
 
 
 
  has Euclidean geometry. If 
 
 
 
  is a power of a Dehn twist then 
 
 
 
  has Nil geometry. Finally, if 
 
 
 
  is an Anosov map then the resulting three-manifold has Sol geometry.
These three cases exactly correspond to the three possibilities for the absolute value of the trace of the action of 
 
 
 
  on the homology of the torus: either less than two, equal to two, or greater than two.
