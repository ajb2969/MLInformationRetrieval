   Torus bundle      Torus bundle   In mathematics , in the sub-field of geometric topology , a torus bundle is a kind of surface bundle over the circle , which in turn are a class of three-manifolds .  Construction  To obtain a torus bundle : let   f   f   f   be an orientation -preserving homeomorphism of the two-dimensional torus    T   T   T   to itself. Then the three-manifold    M   (  f  )       M  f    M(f)   is obtained by   taking the Cartesian product of   T   T   T   and the unit interval and  gluing one component of the boundary of the resulting manifold to the other boundary component via the map   f   f   f   .   Then    M   (  f  )       M  f    M(f)   is the torus bundle with monodromy    f   f   f   .  Examples  For example, if   f   f   f   is the identity map (i.e., the map which fixes every point of the torus) then the resulting torus bundle    M   (  f  )       M  f    M(f)   is the three-torus : the Cartesian product of three circles .  Seeing the possible kinds of torus bundles in more detail requires an understanding of William Thurston 's geometrization program. Briefly, if   f   f   f   is finite order , then the manifold    M   (  f  )       M  f    M(f)   has Euclidean geometry . If   f   f   f   is a power of a Dehn twist then    M   (  f  )       M  f    M(f)   has Nil geometry . Finally, if   f   f   f   is an Anosov map then the resulting three-manifold has Sol geometry .  These three cases exactly correspond to the three possibilities for the absolute value of the trace of the action of   f   f   f   on the homology of the torus: either less than two, equal to two, or greater than two.
