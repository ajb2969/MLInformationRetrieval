   Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility      Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility   In algebra, Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility is a fundamental result in the theory of Lie algebra representations . Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. The theorem states that every finite-dimensional module over   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is semisimple as a module (i.e., a direct sum of simple modules.)  The theorem is a consequence of Whitehead's lemma (see Weibel's homological algebra book). Weyl's original proof was analytic in nature: it famously used the unitarian trick .  A Lie algebra is called reductive if its adjoint representation is semisimple. Thus, the theorem says that a semisimple Lie algebra is reductive. (But this can be seen more directly.)
