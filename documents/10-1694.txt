Precorrin-8X methylmutase

In enzymology, a precorrin-8X methylmutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

precorrin-8X 
 
 
 
  hydrogenobyrinate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, precorrin 8X, and one product, hydrogenobyrinate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is precorrin-8X 11,12-methylmutase. Other names in common use include precorrin isomerase, and hydrogenobyrinic acid-binding protein. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
