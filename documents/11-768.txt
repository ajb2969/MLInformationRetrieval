   N-succinylarginine dihydrolase      N-succinylarginine dihydrolase   In enzymology , a N-succinylarginine dihydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 2 -succinyl-L-arginine + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N 2 -succinyl-L-ornithine + 2 NH 3 + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N2-succinyl-L-arginine and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are N2-succinyl-L-ornithine , NH 3 , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-succinyl-L-arginine iminohydrolase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include N2-succinylarginine dihydrolase , arginine succinylhydrolase , SADH , AruB , AstB , and 2-N-succinyl-L-arginine iminohydrolase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 3.5.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
