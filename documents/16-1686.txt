Coshc function

In mathematics, the Coshc function appears frequently in papers about optical scattering,1 Heisenberg Spacetime2 and hyperbolic geometry.3 It is defined as45



It is a solution of the following differential equation:



 

Imaginary part in complex plane







Real part in complex plane







absolute magnitude







First-order derivative







Real part of derivative




   

Imaginary part of derivative






absolute value of derivative






In terms of other special functions












Series expansion
