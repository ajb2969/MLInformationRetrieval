M/M/c queue
In [[queueing theory]
 ], a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, the M/M/c queue (or Erlang–C model1) is a multi-server queueing model.2 In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals form a single queue and are governed by a Poisson process, there are c servers and job service times are exponentially distributed.3 It is a generalisation of the M/M/1 queue which considers only a single server. The model with infinitely many servers is the M/M/∞ queue.
Model definition
An M/M/c queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the system, including any currently in service.

Arrivals occur at rate λ according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i+1.
Service times have an exponential distribution with parameter μ in the M/M/c queue.
There are c servers, which serve from the front of the queue. If there are less than c jobs, some of the servers will be idle. If there are more than c jobs, the jobs queue in a buffer.
The buffer is of infinite size, so there is no limit on the number of customers it can contain.

The model can be described as a continuous time Markov chain with transition rate matrix



on the state space {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. The model is a type of birth–death process. We write ρ = λ/(c μ) for the server utilization and require ρ \left(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{c\mu}\right)  then the system has a stationary distribution with probability mass function45









 \pi_0\dfrac{(c\rho)^k}{k!},  & \mbox{if }0 
where πk is the probability that the system contains k customers.
The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by








which is referred to as Erlang's C formula and is often denoted C(c, λ/μ) or E2,c(λ/μ).6 The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by7








Busy period of server
The busy period of the M/M/c queue can either refer to

full busy period: the time period between an arrival which finds c−1 customers in the system until a departure which leaves the system with c−1 customers
partial busy period: the time period between an arrival which finds the system empty until a departure which leaves the system again empty.8

Write910 Tk = min( t: k jobs in the system at time 0+ and k − 1 jobs in the system at time t) and ηk(s) for the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of Tk. Then11

For k > c, Tk has the same distribution as Tc.
For k = c,










For k < c,









Response time
The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. The average response time is the same for all work conserving service disciplines and is12








Customers in first-come, first-served discipline
The customer either experiences an immediate exponential service, or must wait for k customers to be served before their own service, thus experiencing an Erlang distribution with shape parameter k + 1.13
Customers in processor sharing discipline
In a processor sharing queue the service capacity of the queue is split equally between the jobs in the queue. In the M/M/c queue this means that when there are c or fewer jobs in the system, each job is serviced at rate μ. However, when there are more than c jobs in the system the service rate of each job decreases and is 
 
 
 
  where n is the number of jobs in the system. This means that arrivals after a job of interest can impact the service time of the job of interest. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the response time distribution has been shown to be a solution to a Volterra integral equation from which moments can be computed.14 An approximation has been offered for the response time time distribution.1516
Finite capacity
In an M/M/c/K queue (sometimes known as the Erlang–A model17) only K customers can queue at any one time (including those in service18). Any further arrivals to the queue are considered "lost". We assume that K ≥ c. The model has transition rate matrix


 
  on the state space {0, 1, 2, ..., c, ..., K}. In the case where c = K, the M/M/c/c queue is also known as the Erlang–B model.19
Transient analysis
See Takács for a transient solution20 and Stadje for busy period results.21
Stationary analysis
Stationary probabilities are given by22














\frac{(\lambda/\mu)^k}{k!}\pi_0 & \text{for } k=1,2,\ldots,c \\
\frac{(\lambda/\mu)^k}{c^{k-c} c!}\pi_0 & \text{for } k=c+1,\ldots,K.
\end{cases}  The average number of customers in the system is23








and number of average response time for a customer24








Heavy traffic limits
Writing X(t) for the number of customers in the system at time t, it can be shown that under three different conditions the process








converges to a diffusion process.25

Fix μ and c, increase λ and scale by n = 1/(1 − ρ)2.
Fix μ and ρ, increase λ and c, and scale by n = c.
Fix as a constant β where









and increase λ and c using the scale n = c or n = 1/(1 − ρ)2. This case is called the Halfin–Whitt regime.26
