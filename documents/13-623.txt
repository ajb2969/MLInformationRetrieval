   M/M/c queue      M/M/c queue  In [[queueing theory] ], a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , the M/M/c queue (or Erlang–C model 1 ) is a multi-server queueing model . 2 In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals form a single queue and are governed by a Poisson process , there are c servers and job service times are exponentially distributed. 3 It is a generalisation of the M/M/1 queue which considers only a single server. The model with infinitely many servers is the M/M/∞ queue .  Model definition  An M/M/c queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the system, including any currently in service.   Arrivals occur at rate λ according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i +1.  Service times have an exponential distribution with parameter μ in the M/M/c queue.  There are c servers, which serve from the front of the queue. If there are less than c jobs, some of the servers will be idle. If there are more than c jobs, the jobs queue in a buffer.  The buffer is of infinite size, so there is no limit on the number of customers it can contain.   The model can be described as a continuous time Markov chain with transition rate matrix      Q  =   (      -  λ     λ      μ     -   (   μ  +  λ   )      λ          2  μ      -   (    2  μ   +  λ   )      λ             3  μ      -   (    3  μ   +  λ   )      λ                  ⋱                   c  ;  μ      -   (    c  μ   +  λ   )      λ                      c  ;  μ      -   (    c  μ   +  λ   )      λ                         c  ;  μ      -   (    c  μ   +  λ   )      λ                           ⋱     )       Q      λ   λ    μ      μ  λ    λ    absent    2  μ         2  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent    3  μ         3  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱    absent  absent  absent  absent   c  μ         c  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent   c  μ         c  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent   c  μ         c  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱      Q=\begin{pmatrix}-\lambda&\lambda\\

We write ρ = λ /( c μ ) for the server utilization and require ρ \left(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{c\mu}\right)  then the system has a stationary distribution with probability mass function 4 5         π  0   =    [     ∑   k  =  0    c  -  1       (   c  ρ   )   k    k  !     +      (   c  ρ   )   c    c  !     1   1  -  ρ      ]    -  1         subscript  π  0    superscript   delimited-[]      superscript   subscript     k  0      c  1       superscript    c  ρ   k     k          superscript    c  ρ   c     c      1    1  ρ         1      \pi_{0}=\left[\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\frac{(c\rho)^{k}}{k!}+\frac{(c\rho)^{c}}{c!}%

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by         C   (  c  ,   λ  /  μ   )    =     (     (   c  ρ   )   c    c  !    )    (   1   1  -  ρ    )        ∑   k  =  0    c  -  1        (   c  ρ   )   k    k  !     +    (     (   c  ρ   )   c    c  !    )    (   1   1  -  ρ    )            C   c    λ  μ            superscript    c  ρ   c     c      1    1  ρ         superscript   subscript     k  0      c  1       superscript    c  ρ   k     k          superscript    c  ρ   c     c      1    1  ρ         \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)=\frac{\left(\frac{(c\rho)^{c}}{c!}\right)\left(\frac{%
 1}{1-\rho}\right)}{\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\frac{(c\rho)^{k}}{k!}+\left(\frac{(c\rho)^%
 {c}}{c!}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-\rho}\right)}        which is referred to as Erlang's C formula and is often denoted C( c , λ / μ ) or E 2, c ( λ / μ ). 6 The average number of customers in the system (in service and in the queue) is given by 7           ρ   1  -  ρ    C   (  c  ,   λ  /  μ   )    +   c  ρ    .          ρ    1  ρ    C   c    λ  μ       c  ρ     \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}\text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)+c\rho.        Busy period of server  The busy period of the M/M/c queue can either refer to   full busy period: the time period between an arrival which finds c −1 customers in the system until a departure which leaves the system with c −1 customers  partial busy period: the time period between an arrival which finds the system empty until a departure which leaves the system again empty. 8   Write 9 10  T k = min( t: k jobs in the system at time 0 + and k − 1 jobs in the system at time t ) and η k ( s ) for the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of T k . Then 11   For k > c , T k has the same distribution as T c .  For k = c ,            η  c    (  s  )    =    c  μ      k  μ   +  s  +  λ   -   λ   η  c    (  s  )       .         subscript  η  c   s       c  μ         k  μ   s  λ     λ   subscript  η  c   s       \eta_{c}(s)=\frac{c\mu}{k\mu+s+\lambda-\lambda\eta_{c}(s)}.         For k < c ,            η  k    (  s  )    =    k  μ      k  μ   +  s  +  λ   -   λ   η   k  +  1     (  s  )       .         subscript  η  k   s       k  μ         k  μ   s  λ     λ   subscript  η    k  1    s       \eta_{k}(s)=\frac{k\mu}{k\mu+s+\lambda-\lambda\eta_{k+1}(s)}.        Response time  The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. The average response time is the same for all work conserving service disciplines and is 12           C   (  c  ,   λ  /  μ   )      c  μ   -  λ    +   1  μ    .          C   c    λ  μ         c  μ   λ      1  μ     \frac{\text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)}{c\mu-\lambda}+\frac{1}{\mu}.        Customers in first-come, first-served discipline  The customer either experiences an immediate exponential service, or must wait for k customers to be served before their own service, thus experiencing an Erlang distribution with shape parameter k + 1. 13  Customers in processor sharing discipline  In a processor sharing queue the service capacity of the queue is split equally between the jobs in the queue. In the M/M/c queue this means that when there are c or fewer jobs in the system, each job is serviced at rate μ . However, when there are more than c jobs in the system the service rate of each job decreases and is     c  μ   n        c  μ   n    \frac{c\mu}{n}   where n is the number of jobs in the system. This means that arrivals after a job of interest can impact the service time of the job of interest. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the response time distribution has been shown to be a solution to a Volterra integral equation from which moments can be computed. 14 An approximation has been offered for the response time time distribution. 15 16  Finite capacity  In an M/M/ c / K queue (sometimes known as the Erlang–A model 17 ) only K customers can queue at any one time (including those in service 18 ). Any further arrivals to the queue are considered "lost". We assume that K ≥ c . The model has transition rate matrix      Q  =   (      -  λ     λ      μ     -   (   μ  +  λ   )      λ          2  μ      -   (    2  μ   +  λ   )      λ             3  μ      -   (    3  μ   +  λ   )      λ                  ⋱                   c  ;  μ      -   (    c  μ   +  λ   )      λ                      c  ;  μ      -   (    c  μ   +  λ   )      λ                           ⋱                            c  ;  μ      -   (   c  μ   )       )       Q      λ   λ    μ      μ  λ    λ    absent    2  μ         2  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent    3  μ         3  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱    absent  absent  absent  absent   c  μ         c  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent   c  μ         c  μ   λ    λ    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent   c  μ       c  μ        Q=\begin{pmatrix}-\lambda&\lambda\\

In the case where c = K , the M/M/ c / c queue is also known as the Erlang–B model. 19  Transient analysis  See Takács for a transient solution 20 and Stadje for busy period results. 21  Stationary analysis  Stationary probabilities are given by 22         π  0   =    [     ∑   k  =  0   c     λ  k     μ  k    k  !      +     λ  c     μ  c    c  !       ∑   k  =   c  +  1    K     λ   k  -  c      μ   k  -  c     c   k  -  c         ]    -  1         subscript  π  0    superscript   delimited-[]      superscript   subscript     k  0    c      superscript  λ  k      superscript  μ  k     k           superscript  λ  c      superscript  μ  c     c       superscript   subscript     k    c  1     K      superscript  λ    k  c       superscript  μ    k  c     superscript  c    k  c            1      \pi_{0}=\left[\sum_{k=0}^{c}\frac{\lambda^{k}}{\mu^{k}k!}+\frac{\lambda^{c}}{%
