Nucleoplasmin ATPase




Nucleoplasmin ATPase

In enzymology, a nucleoplasmin ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and H2O, whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to facilitate cellular and subcellular movement. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (nucleosome-assembling).
