   Flat vector bundle      Flat vector bundle   In mathematics , a vector bundle is said to be flat if it is endowed with an linear connection with vanishing curvature , ie. a flat connection .  de Rham cohomology of a flat vector bundle  Let    œÄ  :   E  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  œÄ   normal-‚Üí  E  X     \pi:E\to X   denote a flat vector bundle, and    ‚àá  :    Œì   (  X  ,  E  )    ‚Üí   Œì   (  X  ,    Œ©  X  1   ‚äó  E   )        normal-:  normal-‚àá   normal-‚Üí    normal-Œì   X  E      normal-Œì   X   tensor-product   superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X   1   E        \nabla:\Gamma(X,E)\to\Gamma(X,\Omega_{X}^{1}\otimes E)   be the covariant derivative associated to the flat connection on E.  Let      Œ©  X  *    (  E  )    =    Œ©  X  *   ‚äó  E          superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X     E    tensor-product   subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©    X   E     \Omega_{X}^{*}(E)=\Omega^{*}_{X}\otimes E   denote the vector space (in fact a sheaf of modules over    ùí™  X     subscript  ùí™  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   ) of differential forms on X with values in E . The covariant derivative defines a degree 1 endomorphism  d , the differential of     Œ©  X  *    (  E  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X     E    \Omega_{X}^{*}(E)   , and the flatness condition is equivalent to the property     d  2   =  0       superscript  d  2   0    d^{2}=0   .  In other words, the graded vector space      Œ©  X  *    (  E  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X     E    \Omega_{X}^{*}(E)   is a cochain complex . Its cohomology is called the de Rham cohomology of E , or de Rham cohomology with coefficients twisted by the local coefficient system E .  Flat trivializations  A trivialization of a flat vector bundle is said to be flat if the connection form vanishes in this trivialization. An equivalent definition of a flat bundle is the choice of a trivializing atlas with locally constant transition maps.  Examples   Trivial line bundles can have several flat bundle structures. An example is the trivial bundle over     ‚ÑÇ  \   {  0  }    ,     normal-\  ‚ÑÇ   0     \mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\},   with the connection forms 0 and    -    d  z   z           d  z   z     -\frac{dz}{z}   . The parallel vector fields are constant in the first case, and proportional to local determinations of the complex logarithm in the second.    The real canonical line bundle      Œõ  top   M       superscript  normal-Œõ  top   M    \Lambda^{\mathrm{top}}M   of a differential manifold  M is a flat line bundle, called the orientation bundle . Its sections are volume forms .    A Riemannian manifold is flat if, and only if, its Levi-Civita connection gives its tangent vector bundle a flat structure.   See also   Vector-valued differential forms  Local system , the more general notion of a locally constant sheaf.  Orientation character , a characteristic form related to the orientation line bundle, useful to formulate Twisted Poincar√© duality  Picard group whose connected component, the Jacobian variety , is the moduli space of algebraic flat line bundles.  Monodromy , or representations of the fundamental group by parallel transport on flat bundles.  Holonomy , the obstruction to flatness.   "  Category:Vector bundles
