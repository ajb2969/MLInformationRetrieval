Flat vector bundle

In mathematics, a vector bundle is said to be flat if it is endowed with an linear connection with vanishing curvature, ie. a flat connection.
de Rham cohomology of a flat vector bundle
Let 
 
 
 
  denote a flat vector bundle, and 
 
 
 
  be the covariant derivative associated to the flat connection on E.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the vector space (in fact a sheaf of modules over 
 
 
 
 ) of differential forms on X with values in E. The covariant derivative defines a degree 1 endomorphism d, the differential of 
 
 
 
 , and the flatness condition is equivalent to the property 
 
 
 
 .
In other words, the graded vector space

 
  is a cochain complex. Its cohomology is called the de Rham cohomology of E, or de Rham cohomology with coefficients twisted by the local coefficient system E.
Flat trivializations
A trivialization of a flat vector bundle is said to be flat if the connection form vanishes in this trivialization. An equivalent definition of a flat bundle is the choice of a trivializing atlas with locally constant transition maps.
Examples

Trivial line bundles can have several flat bundle structures. An example is the trivial bundle over 
 
 
 
  with the connection forms 0 and 
 
 
 
 . The parallel vector fields are constant in the first case, and proportional to local determinations of the complex logarithm in the second.


The real canonical line bundle

 
  of a differential manifold M is a flat line bundle, called the orientation bundle. Its sections are volume forms.


A Riemannian manifold is flat if, and only if, its Levi-Civita connection gives its tangent vector bundle a flat structure.
