   Perpendicular axis theorem      Perpendicular axis theorem   In physics, the perpendicular axis theorem (or plane figure theorem ) can be used to determine the moment of inertia of a rigid object that lies entirely within a plane, about an axis perpendicular to the plane, given the moments of inertia of the object about two perpendicular  axes lying within the plane. The axes must all pass through a single point in the plane.  Define perpendicular axes    x    x   x\,   ,    y    y   y\,   , and    z    z   z\,   (which meet at origin    O    O   O\,   ) so that the body lies in the    x   y       x  y    xy\,   plane, and the    z    z   z\,   axis is perpendicular to the plane of the body. Let I x , I y and I z be moments of inertia about axis x, y, z respectively, the perpendicular axis theorem states that 1       I  z   =    I  x   +    I  y          subscript  I  z      subscript  I  x    subscript  I  y      I_{z}=I_{x}+I_{y}\,     This rule can be applied with the parallel axis theorem and the stretch rule to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes.  If a planar object (or prism, by the stretch rule ) has rotational symmetry such that     I  x      subscript  I  x    I_{x}\,   and     I  y      subscript  I  y    I_{y}\,   are equal, then the perpendicular axes theorem provides the useful relationship:       I  z   =   2   I  x    =   2    I  y            subscript  I  z     2   subscript  I  x           2   subscript  I  y       I_{z}=2I_{x}=2I_{y}\,     Derivation  Working in Cartesian co-ordinates, the moment of inertia of the planar body about the    z    z   z\,   axis is given by: 2       I  z   =   ∫    (    x  2   +   y  2    )   d  m    =    ∫     x  2    d  m    +   ∫     y  2    d  m     =    I  y   +   I  x           subscript  I  z          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    d  m                superscript  x  2   d  m         superscript  y  2   d  m             subscript  I  y    subscript  I  x       I_{z}=\int\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\,dm=\int x^{2}\,dm+\int y^{2}\,dm=I_{y}+I_{x}     On the plane,    z  =   0       z  0    z=0\,   , so these two terms are the moments of inertia about the    x    x   x\,   and    y    y   y\,   axes respectively, giving the perpendicular axis theorem. The converse of this theorem is also derived similarly.  Note that     ∫     x  2    d  m    =   I  y   ≠   I  x              superscript  x  2   d  m     subscript  I  y         subscript  I  x      \int x^{2}\,dm=I_{y}\neq I_{x}   because in    ∫     r  2    d  m          superscript  r  2   d  m     \int r^{2}\,dm   , r measures the distance from the axis of rotation , so for a y-axis rotation, deviation distance from the axis of rotation of a point is equal to its x co-ordinate.
