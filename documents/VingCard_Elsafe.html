<p><strong>VingCard Elsafe</strong>, whose origin was in <a href="Moss,_Norway" title="wikilink">Moss, Norway</a>, is an international producer of hotel locking systems, electronic in-room safes and energy management systems. After inventing the first mechanical holecard operated lock in 1976, VingCard was acquired in 1994 by <a href="ASSA_ABLOY" title="wikilink">ASSA ABLOY</a>, and merged with the electronic safe producer Elsafe<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to form VingCard Elsafe in 2006.</p>

<p>The original VingCard lock was invented by <a href="Tor_Sørnes" title="wikilink">Tor Sørnes</a>, a Norwegian <a class="uri" href="author" title="wikilink">author</a>, <a class="uri" href="politician" title="wikilink">politician</a>, <a class="uri" href="engineer" title="wikilink">engineer</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1950 Sørnes worked as a production planner at Christiania Staal &amp; Jernvarefabrikk in <a href="Moss,_Norway" title="wikilink">Moss, Norway</a>, a factory which made <a href="Lock_(security_device)" title="wikilink">locks</a> and <a href="ice_skate" title="wikilink">ice skates</a> under the brandname <strong>Ving</strong>. In 1955 he became the factory's machine constructor and when the factory in 1960—as one of the first in the country—established a department of research and development, he became its director.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In the late 1960s and through the 1970s, there were efforts in the security industry to create a room access system that would improve the security by replacing older keys.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1975 Tor Sørnes invented the VingCard lock, the first known mechanical holecard operated lock.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Operated by a plastic key card with a pattern of holes, there were 32 possible hole locations, giving up to

<p>In 1979 Sørnes was working for TrioVing as an engineer in the R&amp;D; Department when a sister company of TrioVing was established – VingCard.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> This became the start of the company VingCard. Export of the original invention was initiated in 1978 when it was installed in <a href="Peachtree_Plaza_Hotel" title="wikilink">Peachtree Plaza Hotel</a> in <a class="uri" href="Atlanta" title="wikilink">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>, USA at that time the world's tallest hotel. The hotel had been troubled by burglaries and was eager to test the new security innovations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> This original system was patented in 29 countries,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and was a mechanical key card predecessor to the contemporary electronic room access card.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> The invention is still in worldwide hotel security use under the brand VingCard.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="founding-of-elsafe">Founding of Elsafe</h3>

<p>1979 was also the year that Elsafe (then a separate company) invented the world’s first <a href="safe" title="wikilink">electronic in-room safe</a>, introducing it to the hotel market. The new product was named Elsafe, and the company’s first factory was placed in <a class="uri" href="Mosvik" title="wikilink">Mosvik</a>, <a class="uri" href="Norway" title="wikilink">Norway</a>. In 1980, Elsafe installed its first safe installation at a property in the <a href="Canary_Islands" title="wikilink">Canary Islands</a>, and it later began selling to hotels on all seven continents. Bjørn Lyng, Elsafe’s founder, wanted to create a security vault that opened and closed electronically, and new electronic safes soon led to an industry-wide shift, where safes requiring metal keys increasingly became obsolete.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="dual-acquisition-by-assa-abloy">Dual acquisition by ASSA ABLOY</h3>

<p>In 1992-93 VingCard launched the electronic <a href="magnetic_stripe" title="wikilink">magnetic stripe</a> card lock to a positive market reception. Tor Sørnes continued as a vice president and director of R&amp;D; at VingCard, retiring in 1992. Following the merger in November 1994 between VingCard's former owners, Abloy Security, and the Swedish <a href="Securitas_AB" title="wikilink">Securitas AB</a>, VingCard became part of <a href="ASSA_ABLOY" title="wikilink">ASSA ABLOY</a>, a Swedish lock manufacturer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>Elsafe also became part of the ASSA ABLOY Group in 1994, currently the world’s largest independent lock group company, which is composed of more than 100 subsidiary international companies.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Aside from VingCard Elsafe, ASSA ABLOY also owns <a href="Yale_lock" title="wikilink">Yale lock</a>, <a class="uri" href="Sargent" title="wikilink">Sargent</a> and the high-security lock firms of <a class="uri" href="Medeco" title="wikilink">Medeco</a> in the U.S., <a class="uri" href="Mul-T-Lock" title="wikilink">Mul-T-Lock</a> in <a class="uri" href="Israel" title="wikilink">Israel</a>, <a class="uri" href="Fichet-Bauche" title="wikilink">Fichet-Bauche</a> in <a class="uri" href="France" title="wikilink">France</a>.

<h3 id="merger">Merger</h3>

<p>In 1997, VingCard and Elsafe joined marketing and sales forces and then finally merged to form VingCard Elsafe in 2006. As a single entity, the company counts more than 166 sales offices worldwide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Among its current product focuses are <a class="uri" href="RFID" title="wikilink">RFID</a> technology<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and energy management systems.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
