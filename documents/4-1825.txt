Slurry

 A slurry is a thin sloppy mud or cement or, in extended use, any fluid mixture of a pulverized solid with a liquid (usually water), often used as a convenient way of handling solids in bulk.1 Slurries behave in some ways like thick fluids, flowing under gravity but are also capable of being pumped if not too thick.
Examples
Examples of slurries include:

Cement slurry, a mixture of cement, water, and assorted dry and liquid additives used in the petroleum and other industries23
Soil/cement slurry, also called Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM), flowable fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, plastic soil-cement, K-Krete, and other names4
A mixture of thickening agent, oxidizers, and water used to form a gel explosive
A mixture of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water produced in a volcanic eruption and known as a lahar
A mixture of bentonite and water used to make slurry walls
Coal slurry, a mixture of coal waste and water, or crushed coal and water5
Slurry oil, the highest boiling fraction distilled from the effluent of an FCC unit in a oil refinery. It contains large amount of catalyst, in form of sediments hence the denomination of slurry.
A mixture of wood pulp and water used to make paper
Manure slurry, a mixture of animal waste, organic matter, and sometimes water often known simply as "slurry" in agricultural use, used as fertilizer after ageing in a slurry pit
Meat slurry, a mixture of finely ground meat and water, centrifugally dewatered and used as food
An abrasive substance used in chemical-mechanical polishing
Slurry ice, a mixture of ice crystals, freezing point depressant, and water
A mixture of raw materials and water involved in the rawmill manufacture of Portland cement
A mixture of minerals, water, and additives used in the manufacture of ceramics
A bolus of chewed food mixed with saliva6
A composite slurry, formed from a combination of no less than three of the aforementioned slurries, as noted by Josh Latham.

Calculations
Determining solids fraction
To determine the percent solids (or solids fraction) of a slurry from the density of the slurry, solids and liquid7


 
  where


 
  is the solids fraction of the slurry (state by mass)


 
  is the solids density


 
  is the slurry density


 
  is the liquid density
In aqueous slurries, as is common in mineral processing, the specific gravity of the species is typically used, and since 
 
 
 
  is taken to be 1, this relation is typically written:


 
  even though specific gravity with units tonnes/m^3 (t/m^3) is used instead of the SI density unit, kg/m^3.
Liquid mass from mass fraction of solids
To determine the mass of liquid in a sample given the mass of solids and the mass fraction: By definition


 
 *100 therefore


 
  and


 
  then


 
  and therefore


 
  where


 
  is the solids fraction of the slurry


 
  is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream


 
  is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream


 
  is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream
Volumetric fraction from mass fraction


 
  Equivalently


 
  and in a minerals processing context where the specific gravity of the liquid (water) is taken to be one:


 
  So


 
  and


 
  Then combining with the first equation:


 
  So


 
  Then since


 
  we conclude that



where


 
  is the solids fraction of the slurry on a volumetric basis


 
  is the solids fraction of the slurry on a mass basis


 
  is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream


 
  is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream


 
  is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream


 
  is the bulk specific gravity of the solids
