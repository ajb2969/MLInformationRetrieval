   Slurry      Slurry   A slurry is a thin sloppy mud or cement or, in extended use, any fluid mixture of a pulverized solid with a liquid (usually water), often used as a convenient way of handling solids in bulk. 1 Slurries behave in some ways like thick fluids , flowing under gravity but are also capable of being pumped if not too thick.  Examples  Examples of slurries include:   Cement slurry, a mixture of cement , water, and assorted dry and liquid additives used in the petroleum and other industries 2 3  Soil/cement slurry, also called Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM), flowable fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, plastic soil-cement, K-Krete, and other names 4  A mixture of thickening agent , oxidizers, and water used to form a gel explosive  A mixture of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water produced in a volcanic eruption and known as a lahar  A mixture of bentonite and water used to make slurry walls  Coal slurry , a mixture of coal waste and water, or crushed coal and water 5  Slurry oil , the highest boiling fraction distilled from the effluent of an FCC unit in a oil refinery . It contains large amount of catalyst, in form of sediments hence the denomination of slurry.  A mixture of wood pulp and water used to make paper  Manure slurry, a mixture of animal waste, organic matter, and sometimes water often known simply as "slurry" in agricultural use, used as fertilizer after ageing in a slurry pit  Meat slurry , a mixture of finely ground meat and water, centrifugally dewatered and used as food  An abrasive substance used in chemical-mechanical polishing  Slurry ice , a mixture of ice crystals, freezing point depressant, and water  A mixture of raw materials and water involved in the rawmill manufacture of Portland cement  A mixture of minerals, water, and additives used in the manufacture of ceramics  A bolus of chewed food mixed with saliva 6  A composite slurry, formed from a combination of no less than three of the aforementioned slurries, as noted by Josh Latham .   Calculations  Determining solids fraction  To determine the percent solids (or solids fraction) of a slurry from the density of the slurry, solids and liquid 7       ϕ   s  l    =     ρ  s    (    ρ   s  l    -   ρ  l    )      ρ   s  l     (    ρ  s   -   ρ  l    )          subscript  ϕ    s  l         subscript  ρ  s      subscript  ρ    s  l     subscript  ρ  l        subscript  ρ    s  l       subscript  ρ  s    subscript  ρ  l        \phi_{sl}=\frac{\rho_{s}(\rho_{sl}-\rho_{l})}{\rho_{sl}(\rho_{s}-\rho_{l})}   where      ϕ   s  l      subscript  ϕ    s  l     \phi_{sl}   is the solids fraction of the slurry (state by mass)      ρ  s     subscript  ρ  s    \rho_{s}   is the solids density      ρ   s  l      subscript  ρ    s  l     \rho_{sl}   is the slurry density      ρ  l     subscript  ρ  l    \rho_{l}   is the liquid density  In aqueous slurries, as is common in mineral processing, the specific gravity of the species is typically used, and since    S   G   w  a  t  e  r        S   subscript  G    w  a  t  e  r      SG_{water}   is taken to be 1, this relation is typically written:       ϕ   s  l    =     ρ  s    (    ρ   s  l    -  1   )      ρ   s  l     (    ρ  s   -  1   )          subscript  ϕ    s  l         subscript  ρ  s      subscript  ρ    s  l    1       subscript  ρ    s  l       subscript  ρ  s   1       \phi_{sl}=\frac{\rho_{s}(\rho_{sl}-1)}{\rho_{sl}(\rho_{s}-1)}   even though specific gravity with units tonnes/m^3 (t/m^3) is used instead of the SI density unit, kg/m^3.  Liquid mass from mass fraction of solids  To determine the mass of liquid in a sample given the mass of solids and the mass fraction: By definition       ϕ   s  l    =    M  s    M   s  l          subscript  ϕ    s  l       subscript  M  s    subscript  M    s  l       \phi_{sl}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{sl}}   *100 therefore       M   s  l    =    M  s    ϕ   s  l          subscript  M    s  l       subscript  M  s    subscript  ϕ    s  l       M_{sl}=\frac{M_{s}}{\phi_{sl}}   and        M  s   +   M  l    =    M  s    ϕ   s  l            subscript  M  s    subscript  M  l       subscript  M  s    subscript  ϕ    s  l       M_{s}+M_{l}=\frac{M_{s}}{\phi_{sl}}   then       M  l   =     M  s    ϕ   s  l     -   M  s         subscript  M  l        subscript  M  s    subscript  ϕ    s  l      subscript  M  s      M_{l}=\frac{M_{s}}{\phi_{sl}}-M_{s}   and therefore       M  l   =     1  -   ϕ   s  l      ϕ   s  l      M  s         subscript  M  l         1   subscript  ϕ    s  l      subscript  ϕ    s  l      subscript  M  s      M_{l}=\frac{1-\phi_{sl}}{\phi_{sl}}M_{s}   where      ϕ   s  l      subscript  ϕ    s  l     \phi_{sl}   is the solids fraction of the slurry      M  s     subscript  M  s    M_{s}   is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream      M   s  l      subscript  M    s  l     M_{sl}   is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream      M  l     subscript  M  l    M_{l}   is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream  Volumetric fraction from mass fraction       ϕ    s  l   ,  m    =    M  s    M   s  l          subscript  ϕ     s  l   m       subscript  M  s    subscript  M    s  l       \phi_{sl,m}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{sl}}   Equivalently       ϕ    s  l   ,  v    =    V  s    V   s  l          subscript  ϕ     s  l   v       subscript  V  s    subscript  V    s  l       \phi_{sl,v}=\frac{V_{s}}{V_{sl}}   and in a minerals processing context where the specific gravity of the liquid (water) is taken to be one:       ϕ    s  l   ,  v    =     M  s    S   G  s        M  s    S   G  s     +    M  l   1          subscript  ϕ     s  l   v         subscript  M  s     S   subscript  G  s          subscript  M  s     S   subscript  G  s        subscript  M  l   1       \phi_{sl,v}=\frac{\frac{M_{s}}{SG_{s}}}{\frac{M_{s}}{SG_{s}}+\frac{M_{l}}{1}}   So       ϕ    s  l   ,  v    =    M  s     M  s   +    M  l   S   G  s           subscript  ϕ     s  l   v       subscript  M  s      subscript  M  s      subscript  M  l   S   subscript  G  s        \phi_{sl,v}=\frac{M_{s}}{M_{s}+M_{l}SG_{s}}   and       ϕ    s  l   ,  v    =   1   1  +     M  l   S   G  s     M  s           subscript  ϕ     s  l   v      1    1       subscript  M  l   S   subscript  G  s     subscript  M  s        \phi_{sl,v}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{M_{l}SG_{s}}{M_{s}}}   Then combining with the first equation:       ϕ    s  l   ,  v    =   1   1  +      M  l   S   G  s      ϕ    s  l   ,  m     M  s       M  s     M  s   +   M  l             subscript  ϕ     s  l   v      1    1         subscript  M  l   S   subscript  G  s       subscript  ϕ     s  l   m     subscript  M  s        subscript  M  s      subscript  M  s    subscript  M  l          \phi_{sl,v}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{M_{l}SG_{s}}{\phi_{sl,m}M_{s}}\frac{M_{s}}{M_{s}+%
