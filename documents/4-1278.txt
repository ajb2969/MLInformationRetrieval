Star refinement

In mathematics, specifically in the study of topology and open covers of a topological space X, a star refinement is a particular kind of refinement of an open cover of X.
The general definition makes sense for arbitrary coverings and does not require a topology. Let 
 
 
 
  be a set and let 
 
 
 
  be a covering of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., 
 
 
 
 . Given a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  then the star of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  is the union of all the sets 
 
 
 
  that intersect 
 
 
 
 , i.e.:



Given a point 
 
 
 
 , we write 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
 .
The covering 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is said to be a refinement of a covering 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  if every 
 
 
 
  is contained in some 
 
 
 
 . The covering 
 
 
 
  is said to be a barycentric refinement of 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
  the star 
 
 
 
  is contained in some 
 
 
 
 . Finally, the covering 
 
 
 
  is said to be a star refinement of 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
  the star 
 
 
 
  is contained in some 
 
 
 
 .
Star refinements are used in the definition of fully normal space and in one definition of uniform space. It is also useful for stating a characterization of paracompactness.
