   Star refinement      Star refinement   In mathematics , specifically in the study of topology and open covers of a topological space  X , a star refinement is a particular kind of refinement of an open cover of X .  The general definition makes sense for arbitrary coverings and does not require a topology. Let   X   X   X   be a set and let    𝒰  =    (   U  i   )    i  ∈  I        𝒰   subscript   subscript  U  i     i  I      \mathcal{U}=(U_{i})_{i\in I}   be a covering of   X   X   X   , i.e.,    X  =    ⋃   i  ∈  I     U  i        X    subscript     i  I     subscript  U  i      X=\bigcup_{i\in I}U_{i}   . Given a subset   S   S   S   of   X   X   X   then the star of   S   S   S   with respect to   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   is the union of all the sets    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   that intersect   S   S   S   , i.e.:        st   (  S  ,  𝒰  )    =   ⋃   {   U  i   :    i  ∈  I   ,    S  ∩   U  i    ≠  ∅    }     .        st   S  𝒰       conditional-set   subscript  U  i    formulae-sequence    i  I       S   subscript  U  i           \mathrm{st}(S,\mathcal{U})=\bigcup\big\{U_{i}:i\in I,\ S\cap U_{i}\neq%
 \emptyset\big\}.     Given a point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   , we write    st   (  x  ,  𝒰  )       st   x  𝒰     \mathrm{st}(x,\mathcal{U})   instead of    st   (   {  x  }   ,  𝒰  )       st    x   𝒰     \mathrm{st}(\{x\},\mathcal{U})   .  The covering    𝒰  =    (   U  i   )    i  ∈  I        𝒰   subscript   subscript  U  i     i  I      \mathcal{U}=(U_{i})_{i\in I}   of   X   X   X   is said to be a refinement of a covering    𝒱  =    (   V  j   )    j  ∈  J        𝒱   subscript   subscript  V  j     j  J      \mathcal{V}=(V_{j})_{j\in J}   of   X   X   X   if every    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is contained in some    V  j     subscript  V  j    V_{j}   . The covering   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   is said to be a barycentric refinement of   𝒱   𝒱   \mathcal{V}   if for every    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   the star    st   (  x  ,  𝒰  )       st   x  𝒰     \mathrm{st}(x,\mathcal{U})   is contained in some    V  j     subscript  V  j    V_{j}   . Finally, the covering   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   is said to be a star refinement of   𝒱   𝒱   \mathcal{V}   if for every    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   the star    st   (   U  i   ,  𝒰  )       st    subscript  U  i   𝒰     \mathrm{st}(U_{i},\mathcal{U})   is contained in some    V  j     subscript  V  j    V_{j}   .  Star refinements are used in the definition of fully normal space and in one definition of uniform space . It is also useful for stating a characterization of paracompactness.  References   J.
