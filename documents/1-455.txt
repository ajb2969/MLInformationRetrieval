   Galois group      Galois group   In mathematics , more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory , the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory , so named in honor of √âvariste Galois who first discovered them.  For a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of permutation groups , see the article on Galois theory .  Definition  Suppose that E is an extension of the field  F (written as E / F and read E over F ). An automorphism of E / F is defined to be an automorphism of E that fixes F pointwise. In other words, an automorphism of E / F is an isomorphism Œ± from E to E such that Œ±( x ) = x for each x in F . The set of all automorphisms of E / F forms a group with the operation of function composition . This group is sometimes denoted by Aut ( E / F ).  If E / F is a Galois extension , then Aut( E / F ) is called the Galois group of (the extension) E over F , and is usually denoted by Gal( E / F ). 1  If E / F is not a Galois extension , then the Galois group of (the extension) E over F is sometimes defined as Aut ( G / F ), where G is the Galois closure of E .  Examples  In the following examples F is a field, and C , R , Q are the fields of complex , real , and rational numbers, respectively. The notation F ( a ) indicates the field extension obtained by adjoining an element a to the field F .   Gal( F / F ) is the trivial group that has a single element, namely the identity automorphism.  Gal( C / R ) has two elements, the identity automorphism and the complex conjugation automorphism. 2  Aut( R / Q ) is trivial. Indeed it can be shown that any automorphism of R must preserve the ordering of the real numbers and hence must be the identity.  Aut( C / Q ) is an infinite group.  Gal( Q (‚àö2)/ Q ) has two elements, the identity automorphism and the automorphism which exchanges ‚àö2 and ‚àí‚àö2.  Consider the field K = Q (¬≥‚àö2). The group Aut(K/ Q ) contains only the identity automorphism. This is because K is not a normal extension , since the other two cube roots of 2 (both complex) are missing from the extension ‚Äî in other words K is not a splitting field .  Consider now L = Q (¬≥‚àö2, œâ), where œâ is a primitive third root of unity . The group Gal(L/ Q ) is isomorphic to S 3 , the dihedral group of order 6 , and L is in fact the splitting field of x 3 ‚àí 2 over Q .  If q is a prime power, and if F = GF ( q ) and E = GF ( q n ) denote the Galois fields of order q and q n respectively, then Gal( E / F ) is cyclic of order n and generated by the Frobenius Homomorphism.  If f is an irreducible polynomial of prime degree p with rational coefficients and exactly two non-real roots, then the Galois group of f is the full symmetric group  S p .   For a finite field    ùêÖ   q  n      subscript  ùêÖ   superscript  q  n     \mathbf{F}_{q^{n}}   , we always have    Gal   (    ùêÖ   q  n    /   ùêÖ  q    )      Gal     subscript  ùêÖ   superscript  q  n     subscript  ùêÖ  q      \operatorname{Gal}(\mathbf{F}_{q^{n}}/\mathbf{F}_{q})   cyclic of order n , generated by the q th power Frobenius automorphism .  Properties  The significance of an extension being Galois is that it obeys the fundamental theorem of Galois theory : the closed (with respect to the Krull topology ) subgroups of the Galois group correspond to the intermediate fields of the field extension.  If E / F is a Galois extension, then Gal( E / F ) can be given a topology , called the Krull topology, that makes it into a profinite group .
