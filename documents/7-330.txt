Armstrong's axioms

Armstrong's axioms are a set of axioms (or, more precisely, inference rules) used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database. They were developed by William W. Armstrong on his 1974 paper.1 The axioms are sound in generating only functional dependencies in the closure of a set of functional dependencies (denoted as 
 
 
 
 ) when applied to that set (denoted as 
 
 
 
 ). They are also complete in that repeated application of these rules will generate all functional dependencies in the closure 
 
 
 
 .
More formally, let 
 
 
 
  denote a relational scheme over the set of attributes 
 
 
 
  with a set of functional dependencies 
 
 
 
 . We say that a functional dependency 
 
 
 
  is logically implied by 
 
 
 
 ,and denote it with 
 
 
 
  if and only if for every instance 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  that satisfies the functional dependencies in 
 
 
 
 , r also satisfies 
 
 
 
 . We denote by 
 
 
 
  the set of all functional dependencies that are logically implied by 
 
 
 
 .
Furthermore, with respect to a set of inference rules 
 
 
 
 , we say that a functional dependency 
 
 
 
  is derivable from the functional dependencies in 
 
 
 
  by the set of inference rules 
 
 
 
 , and we denote it by 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is obtainable by means of repeatedly applying the inference rules in 
 
 
 
  to functional dependencies in 
 
 
 
 . We denote by 
 
 
 
  the set of all functional dependencies that are derivable from 
 
 
 
  by inference rules in 
 
 
 
 .
Then, a set of inference rules 
 
 
 
  is sound if and only if the following holds:



that is to say, we cannot derive by means of 
 
 
 
  functional dependencies that are not logically implied by 
 
 
 
 . The set of inference rules 
 
 
 
  is said to be complete if the following holds:



more simply put, we are able to derive by 
 
 
 
  all the functional dependencies that are logically implied by 
 
 
 
 .
Axioms
Let 
 
 
 
  be a relation scheme over the set of attributes 
 
 
 
 . Henceforth we will denote by letters 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  any subset of 
 
 
 
  and, for short, the union of two sets of attributes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  instead of the usual 
 
 
 
 ; this notation is rather standard in database theory when dealing with sets of attributes.
Axiom of reflexivity


 
  then 
 
 

Axiom of augmentation
If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 

Axiom of transitivity
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

Additional rules
These rules can be derived from above axioms.
Union
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 

Decomposition
If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Pseudo transitivity
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 

Armstrong relation
Given a set of functional dependencies 
 
 
 
 , the Armstrong relation is a relation which satisfies all the functional dependencies in the closure 
 
 
 
  and only those dependencies. Unfortunately, the minimum-size Armstrong relation for a given set of dependencies can have a size which is an exponential function of the number of attributes in the dependencies considered.2
