   Armstrong's axioms      Armstrong's axioms   Armstrong's axioms are a set of axioms (or, more precisely, inference rules ) used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database . They were developed by William W. Armstrong on his 1974 paper. 1 The axioms are sound in generating only functional dependencies in the closure of a set of functional dependencies (denoted as    F  +     superscript  F     F^{+}   ) when applied to that set (denoted as   F   F   F   ). They are also complete in that repeated application of these rules will generate all functional dependencies in the closure    F  +     superscript  F     F^{+}   .  More formally, let    ⟨   R   (  U  )    ,  F  ⟩       R  U   F    \langle R(U),F\rangle   denote a relational scheme over the set of attributes   U   U   U   with a set of functional dependencies   F   F   F   . We say that a functional dependency   f   f   f   is logically implied by   F   F   F   ,and denote it with    F  ⊧  f     models  F  f    F\models f   if and only if for every instance   r   r   r   of   R   R   R   that satisfies the functional dependencies in   F   F   F   , r also satisfies   f   f   f   . We denote by    F  +     superscript  F     F^{+}   the set of all functional dependencies that are logically implied by   F   F   F   .  Furthermore, with respect to a set of inference rules   A   A   A   , we say that a functional dependency   f   f   f   is derivable from the functional dependencies in   F   F   F   by the set of inference rules   A   A   A   , and we denote it by    F   ⊢  A   f     fragments  F   subscript  proves  A   f    F\vdash_{A}f   if and only if   f   f   f   is obtainable by means of repeatedly applying the inference rules in   A   A   A   to functional dependencies in   F   F   F   . We denote by    F  A  *     subscript   superscript  F    A    F^{*}_{A}   the set of all functional dependencies that are derivable from   F   F   F   by inference rules in   A   A   A   .  Then, a set of inference rules   A   A   A   is sound if and only if the following holds:       F  A  *   ⊆   F  +        subscript   superscript  F    A    superscript  F      F^{*}_{A}\subseteq F^{+}     that is to say, we cannot derive by means of   A   A   A   functional dependencies that are not logically implied by   F   F   F   . The set of inference rules   A   A   A   is said to be complete if the following holds:       F  +   ⊆   F  A  *        superscript  F     subscript   superscript  F    A     F^{+}\subseteq F^{*}_{A}     more simply put, we are able to derive by   A   A   A   all the functional dependencies that are logically implied by   F   F   F   .  Axioms  Let    R   (  U  )       R  U    R(U)   be a relation scheme over the set of attributes   U   U   U   . Henceforth we will denote by letters   X   X   X   ,   Y   Y   Y   ,   Z   Z   Z   any subset of   U   U   U   and, for short, the union of two sets of attributes   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   by    X  Y      X  Y    XY   instead of the usual    X  ∪  Y      X  Y    X\cup Y   ; this notation is rather standard in database theory when dealing with sets of attributes.  Axiom of reflexivity      Y  ⊆  X      Y  X    Y\subseteq X   then    X  →  Y     normal-→  X  Y    X\to Y     Axiom of augmentation  If    X  →  Y     normal-→  X  Y    X\to Y   , then     X  Z   →   Y  Z      normal-→    X  Z     Y  Z     XZ\to YZ   for any   Z   Z   Z     Axiom of transitivity  If    X  →  Y     normal-→  X  Y    X\to Y   and    Y  →  Z     normal-→  Y  Z    Y\to Z   , then    X  →  Z     normal-→  X  Z    X\to Z     Additional rules  These rules can be derived from above axioms.  Union  If    X  →  Y     normal-→  X  Y    X\to Y   and    X  →  Z     normal-→  X  Z    X\to Z   then    X  →   Y  Z      normal-→  X    Y  Z     X\to YZ     Decomposition  If    X  →   Y  Z      normal-→  X    Y  Z     X\to YZ   then    X  →  Y     normal-→  X  Y    X\to Y   and    X  →  Z     normal-→  X  Z    X\to Z     Pseudo transitivity  If    X  →  Y     normal-→  X  Y    X\to Y   and     Y  Z   →  W     normal-→    Y  Z   W    YZ\to W   then     X  Z   →  W     normal-→    X  Z   W    XZ\to W     Armstrong relation  Given a set of functional dependencies   F   F   F   , the Armstrong relation is a relation which satisfies all the functional dependencies in the closure    F  +     superscript  F     F^{+}   and only those dependencies. Unfortunately, the minimum-size Armstrong relation for a given set of dependencies can have a size which is an exponential function of the number of attributes in the dependencies considered. 2  External links   UMBC CMSC 461 Spring '99  CS345 Lecture Notes from Stanford University   References    "  Category:Data modeling     William Ward Armstrong: Dependency Structures of Data Base Relationships , page 580-583.
