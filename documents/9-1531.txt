   Secondary measure      Secondary measure   In mathematics, the secondary measure associated with a measure of positive density ρ when there is one, is a measure of positive density μ, turning the secondary polynomials associated with the orthogonal polynomials for ρ into an orthogonal system.  Introduction  Under certain assumptions that we will specify further, it is possible to obtain the existence of a secondary measure and even to express it.  For example if one works in the Hilbert space  L 2 ([0, 1], R , ρ)        ∀  x   ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,    μ   (  x  )    =    ρ   (  x  )        φ  2    (  x  )    4   +    π  2    ρ  2    (  x  )          formulae-sequence     for-all  x    0  1        μ  x       ρ  x          superscript  φ  2   x   4      superscript  π  2    superscript  ρ  2   x        \forall x\in[0,1],\qquad\mu(x)=\frac{\rho(x)}{\frac{\varphi^{2}(x)}{4}+\pi^{2}%
 \rho^{2}(x)}     with       φ   (  x  )    =    lim   ε  →   0  +      2    ∫  0  1        (   x  -  t   )   ρ   (  t  )       (   x  -  t   )   2   +   ε  2      d  t            φ  x     subscript    normal-→  ε   superscript  0        2    superscript   subscript   0   1           x  t   ρ  t      superscript    x  t   2    superscript  ε  2     d  t        \varphi(x)=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0^{+}}2\int_{0}^{1}\frac{(x-t)\rho(t)}{(x-t)^{%
 2}+\varepsilon^{2}}\,dt     in the general case, or:       φ   (  x  )    =    2  ρ   (  x  )   ln   (   x   1  -  x    )    -   2    ∫  0  1        ρ   (  t  )    -   ρ   (  x  )      t  -  x     d  t            φ  x       2  ρ  x  ln    x    1  x       2    superscript   subscript   0   1           ρ  t     ρ  x      t  x    d  t        \varphi(x)=2\rho(x)\text{ln}\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)-2\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\rho%
 (t)-\rho(x)}{t-x}\,dt     when ρ satisfies a Lipschitz condition .  This application φ is called the reducer of ρ.  More generally, μ et ρ are linked by their Stieltjes transformation with the following formula:        S  μ    (  z  )    =   z  -   c  1   -   1    S  ρ    (  z  )             subscript  S  μ   z     z   subscript  c  1     1     subscript  S  ρ   z       S_{\mu}(z)=z-c_{1}-\frac{1}{S_{\rho}(z)}     in which c 1 is the moment of order 1 of the measure ρ.  These secondary measures, and the theory around them, lead to some surprising results, and make it possible to find in an elegant way quite a few traditional formulas of analysis, mainly around the Euler Gamma function , Riemann Zeta function , and Euler's constant .  They also allowed the clarification of integrals and series with a tremendous effectiveness, though it is a priori difficult.  Finally they make it possible to solve integral equations of the form       f   (  x  )    =    ∫  0  1       g   (  t  )    -   g   (  x  )      t  -  x    ρ   (  t  )   d  t          f  x     superscript   subscript   0   1           g  t     g  x      t  x    ρ  t  d  t      f(x)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{g(t)-g(x)}{t-x}\rho(t)\,dt     where g is the unknown function, and lead to theorems of convergence towards the Chebyshev and Dirac measures .  The broad outlines of the theory  Let ρ be a measure of positive density on an interval I and admitting moments of any order. We can build a family { P n } of orthogonal polynomials for the inner product induced by ρ. Let us call { Q n } the sequence of the secondary polynomials associated with the family P . Under certain conditions there is a measure for which the family Q is orthogonal. This measure, which we can clarify from ρ is called a secondary measure associated initial measure ρ.  When ρ is a probability density function , a sufficient condition so that μ, while admitting moments of any order can be a secondary measure associated with ρ is that its Stieltjes Transformation is given by an equality of the type:         S  μ    (  z  )    =   a   (   z  -   c  1   -   1    S  ρ    (  z  )      )     ,         subscript  S  μ   z     a    z   subscript  c  1     1     subscript  S  ρ   z        S_{\mu}(z)=a\left(z-c_{1}-\frac{1}{S_{\rho}(z)}\right),     a is an arbitrary constant and c 1 indicating the moment of order 1 of ρ.  For a = 1 we obtain the measure known as secondary, remarkable since for n ≥ 1 the norm of the polynomial P n for ρ coincides exactly with the norm of the secondary polynomial associated Q n when using the measure μ.  In this paramount case, and if the space generated by the orthogonal polynomials is dense in L 2 ( I , R , ρ), the operator  T ρ defined by       f   (  x  )    ↦    ∫  I       f   (  t  )    -   f   (  x  )      t  -  x    ρ   (  t  )   d  t       maps-to    f  x     subscript   I           f  t     f  x      t  x    ρ  t  d  t      f(x)\mapsto\int_{I}\frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}\rho(t)dt     creating the secondary polynomials can be furthered to a linear map connecting space L 2 ( I , R , ρ) to L 2 ( I , R , μ) and becomes isometric if limited to the hyperplane  H ρ of the orthogonal functions with P 0 = 1.  For unspecified functions square integrable for ρ we obtain the more general formula of covariance :          ⟨   f  /  g   ⟩   ρ   -     ⟨   f  /  1   ⟩   ρ   ×    ⟨   g  /  1   ⟩   ρ     =    ⟨      T  ρ    (  f  )    /   T  ρ     (  g  )    ⟩   μ    .         subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    f  g    ρ      subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    f  1    ρ    subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    g  1    ρ      subscript   delimited-⟨⟩         subscript  T  ρ   f    subscript  T  ρ    g    μ     \langle f/g\rangle_{\rho}-\langle f/1\rangle_{\rho}\times\langle g/1\rangle_{%
 \rho}=\langle T_{\rho}(f)/T_{\rho}(g)\rangle_{\mu}.     The theory continues by introducing the concept of reducible measure, meaning that the quotient ρ/μ is element of L 2 ( I , R , μ). The following results are then established:  The reducer φ of ρ is an antecedent of ρ/μ for the operator T ρ . (In fact the only antecedent which belongs to H ρ ).  For any function square integrable for ρ, there is an equality known as the reducing formula:        ⟨   f  /  φ   ⟩   ρ   =    ⟨     T  ρ    (  f  )    /  1   ⟩   ρ        subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    f  φ    ρ    subscript   delimited-⟨⟩       subscript  T  ρ   f   1    ρ     \langle f/\varphi\rangle_{\rho}=\langle T_{\rho}(f)/1\rangle_{\rho}   .  The operator      f  ↦    φ  ×  f   -    T  ρ    (  f  )        maps-to  f      φ  f      subscript  T  ρ   f      f\mapsto\varphi\times f-T_{\rho}(f)     defined on the polynomials is prolonged in an isometry  S ρ linking the closure of the space of these polynomials in L 2 ( I , R , ρ 2 μ −1 ) to the hyperplane  H ρ provided with the norm induced by ρ.  Under certain restrictive conditions the operator S ρ acts like the adjoint of T ρ for the inner product induced by ρ.  Finally the two operators are also connected, provided the images in question are defined, by the fundamental formula of composition:          T  ρ   ∘   S  ρ     (  f  )    =    ρ  μ   ×   (  f  )     .           subscript  T  ρ    subscript  S  ρ    f       ρ  μ   f     T_{\rho}\circ S_{\rho}\left(f\right)=\frac{\rho}{\mu}\times(f).     Case of the Lebesgue measure and some other examples  The Lebesgue measure on the standard interval [0, 1] is obtained by taking the constant density ρ( x ) = 1.  The associated orthogonal polynomials are called Legendre polynomials and can be clarified by         P  n    (  x  )    =     d  n    d   x  n      (    x  n     (   1  -  x   )   n    )     .         subscript  P  n   x        superscript  d  n     d   superscript  x  n        superscript  x  n    superscript    1  x   n       P_{n}(x)=\frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}\left(x^{n}(1-x)^{n}\right).     The norm of P n is worth        n  !      2  n   +  1     .        n         2  n   1      \frac{n!}{\sqrt{2n+1}}.     The recurrence relation in three terms is written:        2   (    2  n   +  1   )   X   P  n    (  X  )    =     -    P   n  +  1     (  X  )     +    (    2  n   +  1   )    P  n    (  X  )     -    n  2    P   n  -  1     (  X  )      .        2      2  n   1   X   subscript  P  n   X            subscript  P    n  1    X          2  n   1    subscript  P  n   X       superscript  n  2    subscript  P    n  1    X      2(2n+1)XP_{n}(X)=-P_{n+1}(X)+(2n+1)P_{n}(X)-n^{2}P_{n-1}(X).     The reducer of this measure of Lebesgue is given by        φ   (  x  )    =   2   ln   (   x   1  -  x    )      .        φ  x     2      x    1  x        \varphi(x)=2\ln\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right).     The associated secondary measure is then clarified as       μ   (  x  )    =   1     ln  2    (   x   1  -  x    )    +   π  2           μ  x     1      superscript   2     x    1  x      superscript  π  2       \mu(x)=\frac{1}{\ln^{2}\left(\frac{x}{1-x}\right)+\pi^{2}}   .  If we normalize the polynomials of Legendre, the coefficients of Fourier of the reducer φ related to this orthonormal system are null for an even index and are given by        C  n    (  φ  )    =   -    4     2  n   +  1      n   (   n  +  1   )             subscript  C  n   φ         4        2  n   1       n    n  1        C_{n}(\varphi)=-\frac{4\sqrt{2n+1}}{n(n+1)}     for an odd index n .  The Laguerre polynomials are linked to the density ρ( x ) = e −x on the interval I = [0, ∞). They are clarified by        L  n    (  x  )    =     e  x    n  !      d  n    d   x  n      (    x  n    e   -  x     )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n     (     n      k     )     (   -  1   )   k     x  k    k  !               subscript  L  n   x        superscript  e  x     n       superscript  d  n     d   superscript  x  n        superscript  x  n    superscript  e    x             superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    superscript    1   k      superscript  x  k     k         L_{n}(x)=\frac{e^{x}}{n!}\frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}(x^{n}e^{-x})=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{%
 \left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}(-1)^{k}\frac{x^{k}}{k!}     and are normalized.  The reducer associated is defined by        φ   (  x  )    =   2   (    ln   (  x  )    -    ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t     ln    |   x  -  t   |   d  t       )     .        φ  x     2      x     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t            x  t    d  t          \varphi(x)=2\left(\ln(x)-\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}\ln|x-t|dt\right).     The coefficients of Fourier of the reducer φ related to the Laguerre polynomials are given by         C  n    (  φ  )    =   -    1  n     ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1     1   (       n  -  1       k      )        .         subscript  C  n   φ         1  n     superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1      1   binomial    n  1   k         C_{n}(\varphi)=-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{{\left({{n-1}\atop{k}}%
 \right)}}.     This coefficient C n (φ) is no other than the opposite of the sum of the elements of the line of index n in the table of the harmonic triangular numbers of Leibniz .  The Hermite polynomials are linked to the Gaussian density       ρ   (  x  )    =    e   -    x  2   2       2  π           ρ  x      superscript  e       superscript  x  2   2         2  π       \rho(x)=\frac{e^{-\frac{x^{2}}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}     on I = R .  They are clarified by        H  n    (  x  )    =    1    n  !      e    x  2   2      d  n    d   x  n      (   e   -    x  2   2     )           subscript  H  n   x       1      n      superscript  e     superscript  x  2   2       superscript  d  n     d   superscript  x  n      superscript  e       superscript  x  2   2        H_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}e^{\frac{x^{2}}{2}}\frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}\left(e^{-%
 \frac{x^{2}}{2}}\right)     and are normalized.  The reducer associated is defined by        φ   (  x  )    =   -    2    2  π       ∫   -  ∞   ∞    t   e   -    t  2   2      ln    |   x  -  t   |   d  t         .        φ  x         2      2  π       superscript   subscript            t   superscript  e       superscript  t  2   2             x  t    d  t          \varphi(x)=-\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}te^{-\frac{t^{2}}{2}}%
 \ln|x-t|\,dt.     The coefficients of Fourier of the reducer φ related to the system of Hermite polynomials are null for an even index and are given by        C  n    (  φ  )    =     (   -  1   )     n  +  1   2       (    n  -  1   2   )   !     n  !             subscript  C  n   φ      superscript    1       n  1   2            n  1   2        n        C_{n}(\varphi)=(-1)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}\frac{\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)!}{\sqrt{n!}}     for an odd index n .  The Chebyshev measure of the second form. This is defined by the density       ρ   (  x  )    =    8  π     x   (   1  -  x   )            ρ  x       8  π       x    1  x        \rho(x)=\frac{8}{\pi}\sqrt{x(1-x)}     on the interval [0, 1].  It is the only one which coincides with its secondary measure normalised on this standard interval. Under certain conditions it occurs as the limit of the sequence of normalized secondary measures of a given density.  Examples of non-reducible measures  Jacobi measure on (0, 1) of density        ρ   (  x  )    =    2  π      1  -  x   x      .        ρ  x       2  π         1  x   x       \rho(x)=\frac{2}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{1-x}{x}}.     Chebyshev measure on (−1, 1) of the first form of density        ρ   (  x  )    =   1   π    1  -   x  2        .        ρ  x     1    π      1   superscript  x  2         \rho(x)=\frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}.     Sequence of secondary measures  The secondary measure μ associated with a probability density function ρ has its moment of order 0 given by the formula        d  0   =    c  2   -   c  1  2     ,       subscript  d  0      subscript  c  2    superscript   subscript  c  1   2      d_{0}=c_{2}-c_{1}^{2},     where c 1 and c 2 indicating the respective moments of order 1 and 2 of ρ.  To be able to iterate the process then, one 'normalizes' μ while defining ρ 1 = μ/ d 0 which becomes in its turn a density of probability called naturally the normalised secondary measure associated with ρ.  We can then create from ρ 1 a secondary normalised measure ρ 2 , then defining ρ 3 from ρ 2 and so on. We can therefore see a sequence of successive secondary measures, created from ρ 0 = ρ, is such that ρ n +1 that is the secondary normalised measure deduced from ρ n  It is possible to clarify the density ρ n by using the orthogonal polynomials  P n for ρ, the secondary polynomials Q n and the reducer associated φ. That gives the formula         ρ  n    (  x  )    =    1   d  0   n  -  1       ρ   (  x  )       (     P   n  -  1     (  x  )     φ   (  x  )    2    -    Q   n  -  1     (  x  )     )   2   +    π  2    ρ  2    (  x  )    P   n  -  1   2    (  x  )        .         subscript  ρ  n   x       1   superscript   subscript  d  0     n  1         ρ  x      superscript       subscript  P    n  1    x      φ  x   2       subscript  Q    n  1    x    2      superscript  π  2    superscript  ρ  2   x   superscript   subscript  P    n  1    2   x        \rho_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{d_{0}^{n-1}}\frac{\rho(x)}{\left(P_{n-1}(x)\frac{\varphi(%
 x)}{2}-Q_{n-1}(x)\right)^{2}+\pi^{2}\rho^{2}(x)P_{n-1}^{2}(x)}.     The coefficient    d  0   n  -  1      superscript   subscript  d  0     n  1     d_{0}^{n-1}   is easily obtained starting from the leading coefficients of the polynomials P n −1 and P n . We can also clarify the reducer φ n associated with ρ n , as well as the orthogonal polynomials corresponding to ρ n .  A very beautiful result relates the evolution of these densities when the index tends towards the infinite and the support of the measure is the standard interval [0, 1].  Let       x   P  n    (  x  )    =     t  n    P   n  +  1     (  x  )    +    s  n    P  n    (  x  )    +    t   n  -  1     P   n  -  1     (  x  )           x   subscript  P  n   x        subscript  t  n    subscript  P    n  1    x      subscript  s  n    subscript  P  n   x      subscript  t    n  1     subscript  P    n  1    x      xP_{n}(x)=t_{n}P_{n+1}(x)+s_{n}P_{n}(x)+t_{n-1}P_{n-1}(x)   be the classic recurrence relation in three terms. If          lim   n  ↦  ∞     t  n    =    1  4     ,     lim   n  ↦  ∞     s  n    =    1  2      ,     formulae-sequence      subscript    maps-to  n      subscript  t  n      1  4        subscript    maps-to  n      subscript  s  n      1  2      \lim_{n\mapsto\infty}t_{n}=\tfrac{1}{4},\quad\lim_{n\mapsto\infty}s_{n}=\tfrac%
 {1}{2},     then the sequence {ρ n } converges completely towards the Chebyshev density of the second form        ρ   t  c  h     (  x  )    =    8  π     x   (   1  -  x   )             subscript  ρ    t  c  h    x       8  π       x    1  x        \rho_{tch}(x)=\frac{8}{\pi}\sqrt{x(1-x)}   .  These conditions about limits are checked by a very broad class of traditional densities. A derivation of the sequence of secondary measures and convergence can be found in 1  Equinormal measures  One calls two measures thus leading to the same normalised secondary density. It is remarkable that the elements of a given class and having the same moment of order 1 are connected by a homotopy. More precisely, if the density function ρ has its moment of order 1 equal to c 1 , then these densities equinormal with ρ are given by a formula of the type:         ρ  t    (  x  )    =    t  ρ   (  x  )       (     1  2    (   t  -  1   )    (   x  -   c  1    )   φ   (  x  )    -  t   )   2   +    π  2    ρ  2    (  x  )     (   t  -  1   )   2     (   x  -   c  1    )   2       ,         subscript  ρ  t   x       t  ρ  x      superscript        1  2     t  1     x   subscript  c  1    φ  x   t   2      superscript  π  2    superscript  ρ  2   x   superscript    t  1   2    superscript    x   subscript  c  1    2        \rho_{t}(x)=\frac{t\rho(x)}{\left(\tfrac{1}{2}(t-1)(x-c_{1})\varphi(x)-t\right%
 )^{2}+\pi^{2}\rho^{2}(x)(t-1)^{2}(x-c_{1})^{2}},     t describing an interval containing ]0, 1].  If μ is the secondary measure of ρ, that of ρ t will be t μ.  The reducer of ρ t is        φ  t    (  x  )    =     2   (   x  -   c  1    )    -   t  G   (  x  )        (    (   x  -   c  1    )   -   t   1  2   G   (  x  )     )   2   +    t  2    π  2    μ  2    (  x  )             subscript  φ  t   x         2    x   subscript  c  1       t  G  x       superscript      x   subscript  c  1      t    1  2   G  x    2      superscript  t  2    superscript  π  2    superscript  μ  2   x       \varphi_{t}(x)=\frac{2(x-c_{1})-tG(x)}{\left((x-c_{1})-t\tfrac{1}{2}G(x)\right%
 )^{2}+t^{2}\pi^{2}\mu^{2}(x)}     by noting G ( x ) the reducer of μ.  Orthogonal polynomials for the measure ρ t are clarified from n = 1 by the formula        P  n  t    (  x  )    =     t   P  n    (  x  )    +    (   1  -  t   )    (   x  -   c  1    )    Q  n    (  x  )      t           superscript   subscript  P  n   t   x         t   subscript  P  n   x       1  t     x   subscript  c  1     subscript  Q  n   x      t      P_{n}^{t}(x)=\frac{tP_{n}(x)+(1-t)(x-c_{1})Q_{n}(x)}{\sqrt{t}}     with Q n secondary polynomial associated with P n .  It is remarkable also that, within the meaning of distributions, the limit when t tends towards 0 per higher value of ρ t is the Dirac measure concentrated at c 1 .  For example, the equinormal densities with the Chebyshev measure of the second form are defined by:         ρ  t    (  x  )    =    2  t    1  -   x  2       π   [    t  2   +   4   (   1  -  t   )    x  2     ]      ,         subscript  ρ  t   x       2  t      1   superscript  x  2        π   delimited-[]     superscript  t  2     4    1  t    superscript  x  2          \rho_{t}(x)=\frac{2t\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}{\pi\left[t^{2}+4(1-t)x^{2}\right]},     with t describing ]0, 2]. The value t = 2 gives the Chebyshev measure of the first form.

In addition, the sequence of secondary measures has applications in Quantum Mechanics. The sequence gives rise to the so-called sequence of residual spectral densities for specialized Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonians. This also provides a physical interpretation for the sequence of secondary measures. 2  References  http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5262  See also   Orthogonal polynomials  Probability   External links   personal page of Roland Groux about the theory of secondary measures   "  Category:Measures (measure theory)
