Oxalomalate lyase




Oxalomalate lyase

In enzymology, an oxalomalate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-oxalomalate 
 
 
 
  oxaloacetate + glyoxylate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-oxalomalate, and two products, oxaloacetate and glyoxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxalomalate glyoxylate-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming). This enzyme is also called 3-oxalomalate glyoxylate-lyase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
