Pisarenko harmonic decomposition

Pisarenko harmonic decomposition, also referred to as Pisarenko's method, is a method of frequency estimation.1 This method assumes that a signal, 
 
 
 
 , consists of 
 
 
complex exponentials in the presence of white noise. Because the number of complex exponentials must be known a priori, it is somewhat limited in its usefulness.
Pisarenko's method also assumes that 
 
 
 
  values of the 
 
 
autocorrelation matrix are either known or estimated. Hence, given the 
 
 
 
 
  autocorrelation matrix, the dimension of the noise subspace is equal to one and is spanned by the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue. This eigenvector is orthogonal to each of the signal vectors.
The frequency estimates may be determined by setting the frequencies equal to the angles of the roots of the eigenfilter



or the location of the peaks in the frequency estimation function

where

History
Vladilen Fedorovich Pisarenko originated this method in 1973 while examining the problem of estimating the frequencies of complex signals in white noise. He found that the frequencies could be derived from the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix.2
