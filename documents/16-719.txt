   Differentiable stack      Differentiable stack   In differential geometry , a differentiable stack is a stack over the category of differentiable manifolds (with the usual open covering topology ) which admits an atlas. In other words, a differentiable stack is a stack that can be represented by a Lie groupoid .  Connection with Lie groupoids  Every Lie groupoid Œì gives rise to a differentiable stack that is the category of Œì- torsors . In fact, every differentiable stack is of this form. Hence, roughly, "a differentiable stack is a Lie groupoid up to Morita equivalence ." 1  Differential space  A differentiable space is a differentiable stack with trivial stabilizers. For example, if a Lie group  acts freely but not necessarily properly on a manifold, then the quotient by it is in general not a manifold but a differentiable space.  With Grothendieck topology  A differentiable stack X may be equipped with Grothendieck topology in a certain way (see the reference). This gives the notion of a sheaf over X . For example, the sheaf    Œ©  X  p     superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X   p    \Omega_{X}^{p}   of differential p -forms over X is given by, for any x in X over a manifold U , letting     Œ©  X  p    (  x  )        superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X   p   x    \Omega_{X}^{p}(x)   be the space of p -forms on U . The sheaf    Œ©  X  0     superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X   0    \Omega_{X}^{0}   is called the structure sheaf on X and is denoted by    ùí™  X     subscript  ùí™  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   .    Œ©  X  *     superscript   subscript  normal-Œ©  X      \Omega_{X}^{*}   comes with exterior derivative and thus is a complex of sheaves of vector spaces over X : one thus has the notion of de Rham cohomology of X .  Gerbes  An epimorphism between differentiable stacks    G  ‚Üí  X     normal-‚Üí  G  X    G\to X   is called a gerbe over X if    G  ‚Üí   G   √ó  X   G      normal-‚Üí  G    subscript   X   G  G     G\to G\times_{X}G   is also an epimorphism. For example, if X is a stack,      B   S  1    √ó  X   ‚Üí  X     normal-‚Üí      B   superscript  S  1    X   X    BS^{1}\times X\to X   is a gerbe. A theorem of Giraud says that     H  2    (  X  ,   S  1   )        superscript  H  2    X   superscript  S  1      H^{2}(X,S^{1})   corresponds one-to-one to the set of gerbes over X that are locally isomorphic to      B   S  1    √ó  X   ‚Üí  X     normal-‚Üí      B   superscript  S  1    X   X    BS^{1}\times X\to X   and that come with trivializations of their bands .
