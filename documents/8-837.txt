   Higher residuosity problem      Higher residuosity problem   In cryptography , most public key cryptosystems are founded on problems that are believed to be intractable. The higher residuosity problem (also called the n th-residuosity problem 1 ) is one such problem. This problem is easier to solve than integer factorization , so the assumption that this problem is hard to solve is stronger than the assumption that integer factorization is hard.  Mathematical Background  If n is an integer , then the integers modulo  n form a ring . If n = pq where p and q are primes , then the Chinese remainder theorem tells us that        ℤ  /  n   ℤ   ≃       ℤ  /  p   ℤ   ×  ℤ   /  q   ℤ      similar-to-or-equals      ℤ  n   ℤ             ℤ  p   ℤ   ℤ   q   ℤ     \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\simeq\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z}     The group of units of any ring form a group , and the group of units in     ℤ  /  n   ℤ        ℤ  n   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}   is traditionally denoted     (    ℤ  /  n   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  n   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{*}   .  From the isomorphism above, we have        (    ℤ  /  n   ℤ   )   *   ≃     (    ℤ  /  p   ℤ   )   *   ×    (    ℤ  /  q   ℤ   )   *       similar-to-or-equals   superscript      ℤ  n   ℤ        superscript      ℤ  p   ℤ      superscript      ℤ  q   ℤ        (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{*}\simeq(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{*}\times(\mathbb{Z%
 }/q\mathbb{Z})^{*}     as an isomorphism of groups . Since p and q were assumed to be prime, the groups     (    ℤ  /  p   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  p   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{*}   and     (    ℤ  /  q   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  q   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^{*}   are cyclic of orders p -1 and q -1 respectively. If d is a divisor of p -1, then the set of d th powers in     (    ℤ  /  p   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  p   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{*}   form a subgroup of index  d . If gcd( d , q -1) = 1, then every element in     (    ℤ  /  q   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  q   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^{*}   is a d th power, so the set of d th powers in     (    ℤ  /  n   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  n   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{*}   is also a subgroup of index d . In general, if gcd( d , q -1) = g , then there are ( q -1)/( g ) d th powers in     (    ℤ  /  q   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  q   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})^{*}   , so the set of d th powers in     (    ℤ  /  n   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  n   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{*}   has index dg . This is most commonly seen when d =2, and we are considering the subgroup of quadratic residues , it is well known that exactly one quarter of the elements in     (    ℤ  /  n   ℤ   )   *     superscript      ℤ  n   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{*}   are quadratic residues (when n is the product of exactly two primes, as it is here).  The important point is that for any divisor d of p -1 (or q -1) the set of d th powers forms a subgroup of      (    ℤ  /  n   ℤ   )   *   .     superscript      ℤ  n   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{*}.     Problem Statement  Given an integer n = pq where p and q are unknown, an integer d such that d divides p -1, and an integer x x^{(p-1)/d} \equiv 1 \pmod p  When d =2, this is called the quadratic residuosity problem .  Applications  The semantic security of the Benaloh cryptosystem and the Naccache-Stern cryptosystem rests on the intractability of this problem.
