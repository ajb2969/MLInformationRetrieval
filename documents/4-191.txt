   Universal C*-algebra      Universal C*-algebra   In mathematics , more specifically in the theory of C*-algebras , a universal C*-algebra is one characterized by a universal property.  A universal C*-algebra can be expressed as a presentation, in terms of generators and relations. One requires that the generators must be realizable as bounded operators on a Hilbert space, and that the relations must prescribe a uniform bound on the norm of each generator. For example, the universal C*-algebra generated by a unitary element u has presentation . By the functional calculus, this C*-algebra is the continuous functions on the unit circle in the complex plane. Any C*-algebra generated by a unitary element is the homomorphic image of this universal C*-algebra.  We next describe a general framework for defining a large class of these algebras. Let S be a countable  semigroup (in which we denote the operation by juxtaposition) with identity  e and with an involution * such that         e  *   =  e   ,       superscript  e    e    e^{*}=e,\quad              (   x  *   )   *   =  x   ,       superscript   superscript  x      x    (x^{*})^{*}=x,\quad             (  x  y  )   *   =   y  *    x  *   .     fragments   superscript   fragments  normal-(  x  y  normal-)       superscript  y     superscript  x    normal-.     (xy)^{*}=y^{*}x^{*}.\quad      Define         ℓ  1    (  S  )    =   {  φ  :    S  →  ℂ   :    ∥  φ  ∥   =    ∑   x  ∈  S     |   φ   (  x  )    |    <  ∞    }    .         superscript  normal-ℓ  1   S    conditional-set  φ   normal-:   normal-→  S  ℂ        norm  φ     subscript     x  S        φ  x                 \ell^{1}(S)=\{\varphi:S\rightarrow\mathbb{C}:\|\varphi\|=\sum_{x\in S}|\varphi%
 (x)|<\infty\}.     l 1 ( S ) is a Banach space , and becomes an algebra under convolution defined as follows:        [   φ  ⋆  ψ   ]    (  x  )    =    ∑   {   u  ,  v   :    u  v   =  x   }     φ   (  u  )   ψ   (  v  )            delimited-[]   normal-⋆  φ  ψ    x     subscript    conditional-set   u  v       u  v   x       φ  u  ψ  v      [\varphi\star\psi](x)=\sum_{\{u,v:uv=x\}}\varphi(u)\psi(v)     l 1 ( S ) has a multiplicative identity, viz, the function δ e which is zero except at e , where it takes the value 1. It has the involution        φ  *    (  x  )    =    φ   (   x  *   )    ¯          superscript  φ    x    normal-¯    φ   superscript  x        \varphi^{*}(x)=\overline{\varphi(x^{*})}     Theorem . l 1 ( S ) is a C*-algebra with identity.  The universal C*-algebra of contractions generated by S is the C*-enveloping algebra of l 1 ( S ). We can describe it as follows: For every state f of l 1 ( S ), consider the cyclic representation π f associated to f . Then       ∥  φ  ∥   =    sup  f    ∥    π  f    (  φ  )    ∥         norm  φ     subscript  supremum  f    norm     subscript  π  f   φ       \|\varphi\|=\sup_{f}\|\pi_{f}(\varphi)\|   is a C*-seminorm on l 1 ( S ), where the supremum ranges over states f of l 1 ( S ). Taking the quotient space of l 1 ( S ) by the two-sided ideal of elements of norm 0, produces a normed algebra which satisfies the C*-property. Completing with respect to this norm, yields a C*-algebra.  References     "  Category:C*-algebras
