   Bracket ring      Bracket ring   In mathematics, the bracket ring is the subring of the ring of polynomials  k [ x 11 ,..., x dn ] generated by the d by d  minors of a generic  d by n  matrix ( x ij ).  The bracket ring may be regarded as the ring of polynomials on the image of a Grassmannian under the Plücker embedding . 1  For given d ≤ n we define as formal variables the brackets [λ 1 λ 2 ... λ d ] with the λ taken from {1,..., n }, subject to [λ 1 λ 2 ... λ d ] = − [λ 2 λ 1 ... λ d ] and similarly for other transpositions. The set Λ( n , d ) of size    (      n      d      )     binomial  n  d    {\left({{n}\atop{d}}\right)}   generates a polynomial ring K [Λ( n , d )] over a field K . There is a homomorphism Φ( n , d ) from K [Λ( n , d )] to the polynomial ring K [ x i , j ] in nd indeterminates given by mapping [λ 1 λ 2 ... λ d ] to the determinant of the d by d matrix consisting of the columns of the x i , j indexed by the λ. The bracket ring  B ( n , d ) is the image of Φ. The kernel I ( n , d ) of Φ encodes the relations or syzygies that exist between the minors of a generic n by d matrix. The projective variety defined by the ideal I is the ( n − d ) d dimensional Grassmann variety whose points correspond to d -dimensional subspaces of an n -dimensional space. 2  To compute with brackets it is necessary to determine when an expression lies in the ideal I ( n , d ). This is achieved by a straightening law due to Young (1928). 3  See also   Bracket algebra   References        "  Category:Invariant theory  Category:Algebraic geometry     ↩  Sturmfels (2008) pp.78–79 ↩  Sturmfels (2008) p.80 ↩
