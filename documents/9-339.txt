   Lacunary function      Lacunary function   In analysis , a lacunary function , also known as a lacunary series , is an analytic function that cannot be analytically continued anywhere outside the radius of convergence within which it is defined by a power series . The word lacunary is derived from lacuna ( pl. lacunae), meaning gap, or vacancy.  The first known examples of lacunary functions involved Taylor series with large gaps, or lacunae, between the non-zero coefficients of their expansions. More recent investigations have also focused attention on Fourier series with similar gaps between non-zero coefficients. There is a slight ambiguity in the modern usage of the term lacunary series , which may be used to refer to either Taylor series or Fourier series.  A simple example  Consider the lacunary function defined by a simple power series:       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    z   2  n     =   z  +   z  2   +   z  4   +   z  8   +   ⋯            f  z     superscript   subscript     n  0       superscript  z   superscript  2  n            z   superscript  z  2    superscript  z  4    superscript  z  8   normal-⋯      f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{2^{n}}=z+z^{2}+z^{4}+z^{8}+\cdots\,     The power series converges uniformly on any open domain | z |  f(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + \cdots\,  is a divergent series. But since        f   (   z  2   )    =    f   (  z  )    -  z       f   (   z  4   )    =    f   (   z  2   )    -   z  2       f   (   z  8   )    =    f   (   z  4   )    -    z  4    ⋯          formulae-sequence      f   superscript  z  2        f  z   z     formulae-sequence      f   superscript  z  4        f   superscript  z  2     superscript  z  2         f   superscript  z  8        f   superscript  z  4       superscript  z  4   normal-⋯        f(z^{2})=f(z)-z\qquad f(z^{4})=f(z^{2})-z^{2}\qquad f(z^{8})=f(z^{4})-z^{4}\cdots\,     we can see that f has a singularity at a point z when z 2 = 1 (that is, when z = ± 1 ), and also when z 4 = 1 (that is, when z = ± 1 or when z = ± i ). By the induction suggested by the above equations, f must have a singularity at each of the 2 n th roots of unity for all natural numbers n . The set of all such points is dense on the unit circle, hence by continuous extension every point on the unit circle must be a singularity of f . 1  An elementary result  Evidently the argument advanced in the simple example can also be applied to show that series like        f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    z   3  n     =   z  +   z  3   +   z  9   +   z  27   +  ⋯      g   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    z   4  n     =   z  +   z  4   +   z  16   +   z  64   +   ⋯        formulae-sequence        f  z     superscript   subscript     n  0       superscript  z   superscript  3  n            z   superscript  z  3    superscript  z  9    superscript  z  27   normal-⋯           g  z     superscript   subscript     n  0       superscript  z   superscript  4  n            z   superscript  z  4    superscript  z  16    superscript  z  64   normal-⋯       f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^{3^{n}}=z+z^{3}+z^{9}+z^{27}+\cdots\qquad g(z)=\sum_%
 {n=0}^{\infty}z^{4^{n}}=z+z^{4}+z^{16}+z^{64}+\cdots\,     also define lacunary functions. What is not so evident is that the gaps between the powers of z can expand much more slowly, and the resulting series will still define a lacunary function. To make this notion more precise some additional notation is needed.  We write       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     a  k    z   λ  k      =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     b  n     z  n              f  z     superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  a  k    superscript  z   subscript  λ  k             superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  b  n    superscript  z  n        f(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{\lambda_{k}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_{n}z^{n}\,     where b n = a k when n = λ k , and b n = 0 otherwise. The stretches where the coefficients b n in the second series are all zero are the lacunae in the coefficients. The monotonically increasing sequence of positive natural numbers {λ k } specifies the powers of z which are in the power series for f ( z ).  Now a theorem of Hadamard can be stated. 2 If        lim   k  →  ∞      λ  k    λ   k  -  1      >   1  +   δ          subscript    normal-→  k        subscript  λ  k    subscript  λ    k  1        1  δ     \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{\lambda_{k}}{\lambda_{k-1}}>1+\delta\,     where δ > 0 is an arbitrary positive constant, then f ( z ) is a lacunary function that cannot be continued outside its circle of convergence. In other words, the sequence {λ k } doesn't have to grow as fast as 2 k for f ( z ) to be a lacunary function – it just has to grow as fast as some geometric progression (1 + δ) k . A series for which λ k grows this quickly is said to contain Hadamard gaps . See Ostrowski-Hadamard gap theorem .  Lacunary trigonometric series  Mathematicians have also investigated the properties of lacunary trigonometric series        S   (   λ  k   ,  θ  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     a  k    cos   (    λ  k   θ   )         S   (   λ  k   ,  θ  ,  ω  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     a  k    cos   (     λ  k   θ   +  ω   )          formulae-sequence      S    subscript  λ  k   θ      superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  a  k        subscript  λ  k   θ           S    subscript  λ  k   θ  ω      superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  a  k          subscript  λ  k   θ   ω         S(\lambda_{k},\theta)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}\cos(\lambda_{k}\theta)\qquad S(%
 \lambda_{k},\theta,\omega)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}\cos(\lambda_{k}\theta+%
 \omega)\,     for which the λ k are far apart. Here the coefficients a k are real numbers. In this context, attention has been focused on criteria sufficient to guarantee convergence of the trigonometric series almost everywhere (that is, for almost every value of the angle θ and of the distortion factor ω ).   Kolmogorov showed that if the sequence {λ k } contains Hadamard gaps, then the series S (λ k , θ , ω ) converges (diverges) almost everywhere when          \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k^2\,   converges (diverges).    Zygmund showed under the same condition that S (λ k , θ , ω ) is not a Fourier series representing an integrable function when this sum of squares of the a k is a divergent series. 3   A unified view  Greater insight into the underlying question that motivates the investigation of lacunary power series and lacunary trigonometric series can be gained by re-examining the simple example above. In that example we used the geometric series       g   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     z  n           g  z     superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript  z  n      g(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}z^{n}\,     and the Weierstrass M-test to demonstrate that the simple example defines an analytic function on the open unit disk.  The geometric series itself defines an analytic function that converges everywhere on the closed unit disk except when z = 1, where g ( z ) has a simple pole. 4 And, since z = e iθ for points on the unit circle, the geometric series becomes       g   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    e   i  n  θ     =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (    cos   n  θ    +   i   sin   n  θ      )            g  z     superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript  e    i  n  θ            superscript   subscript     n  1            n  θ      i      n  θ          g(z)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}e^{in\theta}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\cos n\theta+i%
 \sin n\theta\right)\,     at a particular z , | z | = 1. From this perspective, then, mathematicians who investigate lacunary series are asking the question: How much does the geometric series have to be distorted – by chopping big sections out, and by introducing coefficients a k ≠ 1 – before the resulting mathematical object is transformed from a nice smooth meromorphic function into something that exhibits a primitive form of chaotic behavior?
