Non-commutative conditional expectation

In mathematics, non-commutative conditional expectation is a generalization of the notion of conditional expectation in classical probability. The space of measurable functions on a 
 
 
 
 -finite measure space 
 
 
 
  is the canonical example of a commutative von Neumann algebra. For this reason, the theory of von Neumann algebras is sometimes referred to as noncommutative measure theory. The intimate connections of probability theory with measure theory suggest that one may be able to extend the classical ideas in probability to a noncommutative setting by studying those ideas on general von Neumann algebras.
For von Neumann algebras with a faithful normal tracial state, for example finite von Neumann algebras, the notion of conditional expectation is especially useful.
Formal definition
A positive, linear mapping 
 
 
 
  of a von Neumann algebra

 
 
  onto a von Neumann algebra 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may be general C*-algebras as well) is said to be a conditional expectation (of 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
 
 ) when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Applications
Sakai's theorem
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a C*-subalgebra of the C*-algebra 
 
 
 
  an idempotent linear mapping of 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  acting on 
 
 
 
 
  the universal representation of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  extends uniquely to an ultraweakly continuous idempotent linear mapping 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the weak-operator closure of 
 
 
 
 
 , onto 
 
 
 
 , the weak-operator closure of 
 
 
 
 .
In the above setting, a result1 first proved by Tomiyama may be formulated in the following manner.
Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be as described above. Then 
 
 
 
  is a conditional expectation from 
 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a conditional expectation from 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
 .
With the aid of Tomiyama's theorem an elegant proof of Sakai's result on the characterization of those C*-algebras that are *-isomorphic to von Neumann algebras may be given.
