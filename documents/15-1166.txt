   Delta8-fatty-acid desaturase      Delta8-fatty-acid desaturase   Delta8-fatty-acid desaturase (, Delta8-sphingolipid desaturase , EFD1 , BoDES8 , SLD , Delta8 fatty acid desaturase , Delta8-desaturase ) is an enzyme with system name phytosphinganine,hydrogen donor:oxygen Delta8-oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   phytosphinganine + reduced acceptor + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   Delta8-phytosphingenine + acceptor + 2 H 2 O   This enzyme, which has been found mainly in plants , introduces a double bond at Delta8 of C18 and C20 fatty acids .
