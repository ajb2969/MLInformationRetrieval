Delta8-fatty-acid desaturase

Delta8-fatty-acid desaturase (, Delta8-sphingolipid desaturase, EFD1, BoDES8, SLD, Delta8 fatty acid desaturase, Delta8-desaturase) is an enzyme with system name phytosphinganine,hydrogen donor:oxygen Delta8-oxidoreductase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

phytosphinganine + reduced acceptor + O2

 
  Delta8-phytosphingenine + acceptor + 2 H2O
 

This enzyme, which has been found mainly in plants, introduces a double bond at Delta8 of C18 and C20 fatty acids.
