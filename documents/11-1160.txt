Hasse–Davenport relation

The Hasse–Davenport relations, introduced by , are two related identities for Gauss sums, one called the Hasse–Davenport lifting relation, and the other called the Hasse–Davenport product relation. The Hasse–Davenport lifting relation is an equality in number theory relating Gauss sums over different fields.  used it to calculate the zeta function of a Fermat hypersurface over a finite field, which motivated the Weil conjectures.
Gauss sums are analogues of the gamma function over finite fields, and the Hasse–Davenport product relation is the analogue of Gauss's multiplication formula


 
  In fact the Hasse–Davenport product relation follows from the analogous multiplication formula for p-adic gamma functions together with the Gross–Koblitz formula of .
Hasse–Davenport lifting relation
Let F be a finite field with q elements, and Fs be the field such that [Fs:F] = s, that is, s is the dimension of the vector space Fs over F.
Let

Let ψ be some nontrivial additive character of F, and let

Let

Then the Hasse–Davenport lifting relation states that



Hasse–Davenport product relation
The Hasse–Davenport product relation states that


 
  where ρ is a multiplicative character of exact order m dividing q–1 and χ is any multiplicative character and ψ is a non-trivial additive character.
