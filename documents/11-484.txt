   Gluconolactonase      Gluconolactonase   In enzymology , a gluconolactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucono-1,5-lactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-gluconate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucono-1,5-lactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is D-gluconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucono-1,5-lactone lactonohydrolase . Other names in common use include lactonase , aldonolactonase , glucono-delta-lactonase , and gulonolactonase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : pentose phosphate pathway , ascorbate and aldarate metabolism , and caprolactam degradation .
