The shifted Gompertz distribution is the distribution of the largest of two independent random variables one of which has an exponential distribution with parameter b and the other has a Gumbel distribution with parameters 
 
 
 
  and b. In its original formulation the distribution was expressed referring to the Gompertz distribution instead of the Gumbel distribution but, since the Gompertz distribution is a reverted Gumbel distribution, the labelling can be considered as accurate. It has been used as a model of adoption of innovations. It was proposed by Bemmaor1 (1994). Some of its statistical properties have been studied further by Jiménez and Jodrá 2(2009).
It has been used to predict the growth and decline of social networks and on-line services and shown to be superior to the Bass model and Weibull distribution (see the work by Christian Bauckhage and co-authors).
Specification
Probability density function
The probability density function of the shifted Gompertz distribution is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the scale parameter and 
 
 
 
  is the shape parameter of the shifted Gompertz distribution.
Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function of the shifted Gompertz distribution is:



Properties
The shifted Gompertz distribution is right-skewed for all values of 
 
 
 
 . It is more flexible than the Gumbel distribution.
Shapes
The shifted Gompertz density function can take on different shapes depending on the values of the shape parameter 
 
 
 
 :



 
  the probability density function has its mode at 0.


 
  the probability density function has its mode at








where 
 
 
 
  is the smallest root of
 
 



which is
 
 




Related distributions
If 
 
 
 
  varies according to a gamma distribution with shape parameter 
 
 
 
  and scale parameter 
 
 
 
  (mean = 
 
 
 
 ), the distribution of 
 
 
 
  is Gamma/Shifted Gompertz (G/SG). When 
 
 
 
  is equal to one, the G/SG reduces to the Bass model (Bemmaor 1994). The G/SG has been applied by Dover, Goldenberg and Shapira 3(2009) and Van den Bulte and Stremersch 4(2004) among others in the context of the diffusion of innovations. The model is discussed in Chandrasekaran and Tellis 5(2007).
