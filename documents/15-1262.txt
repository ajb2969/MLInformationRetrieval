16S rRNA (uracil1498-N3)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (uracil1498-N3)-methyltransferase (, DUF558 protein, YggJ, RsmE, m3U1498 specific methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (uracil1498-N3)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uracil1498 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N3-methyluracil1498 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates uracil1498 at N3 in 16S rRNA.
