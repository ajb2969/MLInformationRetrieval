Andreotti–Frankel theorem

In mathematics, the Andreotti–Frankel theorem, introduced by , states that if 
 
 
 
  is a smooth affine variety of complex dimension

 
  or, more generally, if 
 
 
 
  is any Stein manifold of dimension 
 
 
 
 , then in fact 
 
 
 
  is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex of real dimension at most n. In other words 
 
 
 
  has only half as much topology.
Consequently, if 
 
 
 
  is a closed connected complex submanifold of complex dimension 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy type of a 
 
 
 
  complex of real dimension 
 
 
 
 . Therefore



and



This theorem applies in particular to any smooth affine variety of dimension 
 
 
 
 .
