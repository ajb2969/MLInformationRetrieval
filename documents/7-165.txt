   Andreotti–Frankel theorem      Andreotti–Frankel theorem   In mathematics , the Andreotti–Frankel theorem , introduced by , states that if   V   V   V   is a smooth  affine variety of complex dimension    n   n   n   or, more generally, if   V   V   V   is any Stein manifold of dimension   n   n   n   , then in fact   V   V   V   is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex of real dimension at most n . In other words   V   V   V   has only half as much topology.  Consequently, if    V  ⊆   ℂ  r       V   superscript  ℂ  r     V\subseteq\mathbb{C}^{r}   is a closed connected complex submanifold of complex dimension   n   n   n   , then   V   V   V   has the homotopy type of a    C  W      C  W    CW   complex of real dimension     ≤  n      absent  n    \leq n   . Therefore         H  i    (  V  ;  ℤ  )    =  0   ,    for  i   >   n       formulae-sequence       superscript  H  i    V  ℤ    0       for  i   n     H^{i}(V;\mathbb{Z})=0,\text{ for }i>n\,     and          H  i    (  V  ;  ℤ  )    =  0   ,    for  i   >  n    .     formulae-sequence       subscript  H  i    V  ℤ    0       for  i   n     H_{i}(V;\mathbb{Z})=0,\text{ for }i>n.\,     This theorem applies in particular to any smooth affine variety of dimension   n   n   n   .
