   Chain (algebraic topology)      Chain (algebraic topology)   In algebraic topology , a simplicial k - chain is a formal linear combination of k - simplices . 1  Integration on chains  Integration is defined on chains by taking the linear combination of integrals over the simplices in the chain with coefficients typically integers. The set of all k -chains forms a group and the sequence of these groups is called a chain complex .  Boundary operator on chains    The boundary of a chain is the linear combination of boundaries of the simplices in the chain. The boundary of a k -chain is a ( k −1)-chain. Note that the boundary of a simplex is not a simplex, but a chain with coefficients 1 or −1 – thus chains are the closure of simplices under the boundary operator.  Example 1: The boundary of a path is the formal difference of its endpoints: it is a telescoping sum . To illustrate, if the 1-chain    c  =    t  1   +   t  2   +    t  3         c     subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2    subscript  t  3      c=t_{1}+t_{2}+t_{3}\,   is a path from point     v  1      subscript  v  1    v_{1}\,   to point     v  4      subscript  v  4    v_{4}\,   , where     t  1   =   [   v  1   ,   v  2   ]        subscript  t  1     subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2      t_{1}=[v_{1},v_{2}]\,   ,     t  2   =   [   v  2   ,   v  3   ]        subscript  t  2     subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3      t_{2}=[v_{2},v_{3}]\,   and     t  3   =   [   v  3   ,   v  4   ]        subscript  t  3     subscript  v  3    subscript  v  4      t_{3}=[v_{3},v_{4}]\,   are its constituent 1-simplices, then          ∂  1   c       =    ∂  1    (    t  1   +   t  2   +   t  3    )            =     ∂  1    (   t  1   )    +    ∂  1    (   t  2   )    +    ∂  1    (   t  3   )             =     ∂  1    (   [   v  1   ,   v  2   ]   )    +    ∂  1    (   [   v  2   ,   v  3   ]   )    +    ∂  1    (   [   v  3   ,   v  4   ]   )             =    (    [   v  2   ]   -   [   v  1   ]    )   +   (    [   v  3   ]   -   [   v  2   ]    )   +   (    [   v  4   ]   -   [   v  3   ]    )             =    [   v  4   ]   -   [   v  1   ]     .           subscript   1   c     absent    subscript   1      subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2    subscript  t  3         missing-subexpression     absent      subscript   1    subscript  t  1      subscript   1    subscript  t  2      subscript   1    subscript  t  3         missing-subexpression     absent      subscript   1     subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2       subscript   1     subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3       subscript   1     subscript  v  3    subscript  v  4          missing-subexpression     absent       delimited-[]   subscript  v  2     delimited-[]   subscript  v  1        delimited-[]   subscript  v  3     delimited-[]   subscript  v  2        delimited-[]   subscript  v  4     delimited-[]   subscript  v  3          missing-subexpression     absent     delimited-[]   subscript  v  4     delimited-[]   subscript  v  1         \begin{aligned}\displaystyle\partial_{1}c&\displaystyle=\partial_{1}(t_{1}+t_{%

A chain is called a cycle when its boundary is zero. A chain that is the boundary of another chain is called a boundary . Boundaries are cycles, so chains form a chain complex , whose homology groups (cycles modulo boundaries) are called simplicial homology groups.  Example 3: A 0-cycle is a linear combination of points such that the sum of all the coefficients is 0. Thus, the 0-homology group measures the number of path connected components of the space.  Example 4: The plane punctured at the origin has nontrivial 1-homology group since the unit circle is a cycle, but not a boundary.  In differential geometry , the duality between the boundary operator on chains and the exterior derivative is expressed by the general Stokes' theorem .
