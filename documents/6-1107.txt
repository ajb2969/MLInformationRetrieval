   Goff–Gratch equation      Goff–Gratch equation   The Goff–Gratch equation is one (arguably the first reliable) amongst many equations that have been proposed to estimate the saturation water vapor pressure at a given temperature.  Another similar equation based on more recent data is the Arden Buck equation .  Historical note  This equation is named after the authors of the original scientific article who described how to calculate the saturation water vapor pressure above a flat free water surface as a function of temperature (Goff and Gratch, 1946). Goff (1957) later revised his formula, and the latter was recommended for use by the World Meteorological Organization in 1988, with further corrections in 2000.  Equations  The original Goff–Gratch (1946) equation reads as follows:              log     e  *     =          superscript  e     absent    \log\ e^{*}\ =           -   7.90298   (     T  st   /  T   -  1   )     +    5.02808    log   (    T  st   /  T   )             7.90298       subscript  T  st   T   1       5.02808       subscript  T  st   T       -7.90298(T_{\mathrm{st}}/T-1)\ +\ 5.02808\ \log(T_{\mathrm{st}}/T)             -    1.3816  ×   10   -  7      (    10   11.344   (   1  -   T  /   T  st     )     -  1   )            1.3816   superscript  10    7        superscript  10    11.344    1    T   subscript  T  st       1      -\ 1.3816\times 10^{-7}(10^{11.344(1-T/T_{\mathrm{st}})}-1)              +    8.1328  ×   10   -  3      (    10   -   3.49149   (     T  st   /  T   -  1   )      -  1   )     +    log    e  st  *              8.1328   superscript  10    3        superscript  10      3.49149       subscript  T  st   T   1      1        subscript   superscript  e    st      +\ 8.1328\times 10^{-3}(10^{-3.49149(T_{\mathrm{st}}/T-1)}-1)\ +\ \log\ e^{*}_%
