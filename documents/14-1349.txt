   Boas–Buck polynomials      Boas–Buck polynomials   In mathematics, Boas–Buck polynomials are sequences of polynomials Φ( x ) given by generating functions of the form       C   (   z   t  r   B   (  t  )    )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0      Φ  n   (  r  )     (  z  )    t  n           C    z   superscript  t  r   B  t      subscript     n  0       superscript   subscript  normal-Φ  n   r   z   superscript  t  n       \displaystyle C(zt^{r}B(t))=\sum_{n\geq 0}\Phi_{n}^{(r)}(z)t^{n}   .  The case r =1, sometimes called generalized Appell polynomials , was studied by .  References     "  Category:Polynomials
