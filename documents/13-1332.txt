   Hyperfinite set      Hyperfinite set  In [[non-standard analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''hyperf inite set''' or *-finite set is a type of internal set . An internal set H of internal cardinality g ∈ * N (the hypernaturals ) is hyperfinite if and only if there exists an internal bijection between G = {1,2,3,..., g } and H . 1 2 Hyperfinite sets share the properties of finite sets: A hyperfinite set has minimal and maximal elements, and a hyperfinite union of a hyperfinite collection of hyperfinite sets may be derived. The sum of the elements of any hyperfinite subset of * R always exists, leading to the possibility of well-defined integration . 3  Hyperfinite sets can be used to approximate other sets. If a hyperfinite set approximates an interval, it is called a near interval with respect to that interval. Consider a hyperfinite set    K  =    k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  n        K    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  n      K={k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{n}}   with a hypernatural n . K is a near interval for [ a , b ] if k 1 = a and k n = b , and if the difference between successive elements of K is infinitesimal . Phrased otherwise, the requirement is that for every r ∈ [ a , b ] there is a k i ∈ K such that k i ≈ r . This, for example, allows for an approximation to the unit circle , considered as the set    e   i  θ      superscript  e    i  θ     e^{i\theta}   for θ in the interval [0,2π]. 4  In general, subsets of hyperfinite sets are not hyperfinite, often because they do not contain the extreme elements of the parent set. 5  Ultrapower construction  In terms of the ultrapower construction, the hyperreal line * R is defined as the collection of equivalence classes of sequences    ⟨      u  n   ,  n   =  1   ,   2  ,  …    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   formulae-sequence      subscript  u  n   n   1    2  normal-…      \langle u_{n},n=1,2,\ldots\rangle   of real numbers u n . Namely, the equivalence class defines a hyperreal, denoted    [   u  n   ]     delimited-[]   subscript  u  n     [u_{n}]   in Goldblatt's notation. Similarly, an arbitrary hyperfinite set in * R is of the form    [   A  n   ]     delimited-[]   subscript  A  n     [A_{n}]   , and is defined by a sequence    ⟨   A  n   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  A  n     \langle A_{n}\rangle   of finite sets      A  n   ⊂  ℝ   ,   n  =   1  ,  2  ,  …       formulae-sequence     subscript  A  n   ℝ     n   1  2  normal-…      A_{n}\subset\mathbb{R},n=1,2,\ldots    6  Notes    External links     "  Category:Non-standard analysis     ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩
