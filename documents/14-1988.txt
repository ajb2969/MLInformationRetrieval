   Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula      Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula   In mathematics , the Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula describes the Euler characteristic of complete curve with coefficients in an abelian variety or constructible sheaf , in terms of local data involving the Swan conductor .  and  proved the formula for abelian varieties with tame ramification over curves, and  extended the formula to constructible sheaves over a curve .  Statement  Suppose that F is a constructible sheaf over a genus g smooth projective curve C , of rank n outside a finite set X of points where it has stalk 0. Then       χ   (  C  ,  F  )    =    n   (   2  -   2  g    )    -    ∑   x  ∈  X     (   n  +   S   w  x    (  F  )     )           χ   C  F        n    2    2  g       subscript     x  X      n    S   subscript  w  x   F        \chi(C,F)=n(2-2g)-\sum_{x\in X}(n+Sw_{x}(F))   where Sw is the Swan conductor at a point.
