   Transcendental equation      Transcendental equation   A transcendental equation is an equation containing a transcendental function of the variable(s) being solved for. Such equations often do not have closed-form solutions . Examples include:      x  =   e   -  x        x   superscript  e    x      x=e^{-x}         x  =   cos  x       x    x     x=\cos x     Solvable transcendental equations  Equations where the variable to be solved for appears only once, as an argument to the transcendental function, are easily solvable with inverse functions; similarly if the equation can be factored or transformed to such a case:      Equation   Solutions            ln  x   =  3        x   3    \ln x=3          x  =   e  3       x   superscript  e  3     x=e^{3}             sin  x   =  0        x   0    \sin x=0          x  =   π  n       x    π  n     x=\pi n   (for   n   n   n   an integer)          cos  x   =   sin   2  x          x       2  x      \cos x=\sin{2x}      using the double-angle formula , equivalent to     sin   2  x    =   2   sin  x    cos  x            2  x      2    x     x      \sin 2x=2\sin x\cos x   ; whose solutions are those of     cos  x   =  0        x   0    \cos x=0   and of     2   sin  x    =  1        2    x    1    2\sin x=1   , namely    x  =    2  π  n   +   π  /  2        x      2  π  n     π  2      x=2\pi n+\pi/2   and    x  =     2  π  m   /  3   +   π  /  6        x        2  π  m   3     π  6      x={2\pi m}/3+\pi/6   (for    m  ,  n     m  n    m,n   integers)     Some transcendental equations can be shown to have no real solution, or to have only trivial solutions.      Equation   Solutions            e  x   =  x       superscript  e  x   x    e^{x}=x      No real solutions, as     e  x   >  x       superscript  e  x   x    e^{x}>x   for all   x   x   x             sin  x   =  x        x   x    \sin x=x          x  =  0      x  0    x=0   is the only real solution     Some can be solved because they are compositions of algebraic functions with transcendental functions.      Equation   Solutions             3 2  x   -  2   =   4  x          superscript  3 2  x   2    superscript  4  x     3\;2^{x}-2=4^{x}      solve       3   q   -  2   =   q  2           3  q   2    superscript  q  2     3\;q-2=q^{2}   , giving    q  =  1      q  1    q=1   or    q  =  2      q  2    q=2   , then     2  x   =  q       superscript  2  x   q    2^{x}=q   , so    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   or    x  =  1      x  1    x=1        But most equations where the variable appears both as an argument to a transcendental function and elsewhere in the equation are not solvable in closed form.  Approximate solutions  Approximate numerical solutions to transcendental equations can be found using numerical , analytical approximations, or graphical methods.  Numerical methods for solving arbitrary equations are called root-finding algorithms .  In some cases, the equation can be well approximated using Taylor series near the zero. For example, for    k  ≈  1      k  1    k\approx 1   , the solutions of     sin  x   =   k  x         x     k  x     \sin x=kx   are approximately those of      (   1  -  k   )   x   -    x  3   /  3           1  k   x      superscript  x  3   3     (1-k)x-x^{3}/3   , namely    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   and    x  =    \plusmn    6     1  -  k         x    \plusmn    6       1  k       x=\plusmn\sqrt{6}\sqrt{1-k}   .  For a graphical solution, one method is to set each side of a single variable transcendental equation equal to a dependent variable and plot the two graphs , using their intersecting points to find solutions.  In some cases, special functions can be used to write the solutions to transcendental equations in closed form . In particular,    x  =   e   -  x        x   superscript  e    x      x=e^{-x}   has a solution in terms of the Lambert W Function .  References  "  Category:Equations
