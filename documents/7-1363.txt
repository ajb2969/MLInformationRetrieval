   Lovász conjecture      Lovász conjecture   In graph theory , the Lovász conjecture (1970) is a classical problem on Hamiltonian paths in graphs. It says:   Every finite connected vertex-transitive graph contains a Hamiltonian path.   The original article of Lovász stated the result in the opposite, but this version became standard. In 1996 Babai published a conjecture sharply contradicting this conjecture, 1 but both conjectures remain widely open. It is not even known if a single counterexample would necessarily lead to a series of counterexamples.  Historical remarks  The problem of finding Hamiltonian paths in highly symmetric graphs is quite old. As Knuth describes it in volume 4 of The Art of Computer Programming , 2 the problem originated in British  campanology (bell-ringing). Such Hamiltonian paths and cycles are also closely connected to Gray codes . In each case the constructions are explicit.  Variants of the Lovász conjecture  Hamiltonian cycle  Another version of Lovász conjecture states that   Every finite connected vertex-transitive graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle except the five known counterexamples.   There are 5 known examples of vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles (but with Hamiltonian paths): the complete graph  K 2 , the Petersen graph , the Coxeter graph and two graphs derived from the Petersen and Coxeter graphs by replacing each vertex with a triangle. 3  Cayley graphs  None of the 5 vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles is a Cayley graph, therefore that leads to a weaker version of the conjecture:   Every finite connected Cayley graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle .   The advantage of the Cayley graph formulation is that such graphs correspond to a finite group    G   G   G   and a generating set    S   S   S   . Thus one can ask for which   G   G   G   and   S   S   S   the conjecture holds rather than attack it in full generality.  Directed Cayley graph  For directed Cayley graphs (digraphs) the Lovász conjecture is false. Various counterexamples were obtained by R.A. Rankin . Still, many of the below results hold in this restrictive setting.  Special cases  Every directed Cayley graph of an abelian group has a Hamiltonian path; however, every cyclic group whose order is not a prime power has a directed Cayley graph that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. 4 In 1986, D. Witte proved that the Lovász conjecture holds for the Cayley graphs of p-groups . It is open even for dihedral groups , although for special sets of generators some progress has been made.  When group    G  =   S  n       G   subscript  S  n     G=S_{n}   is a symmetric group , there are many attractive generating sets. For example, the Lovász conjecture holds in the following cases of generating sets:        a  =   (  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  n  )    ,   b  =   (  1  ,  2  )       formulae-sequence    a   1  2  normal-…  n      b   1  2      a=(1,2,\dots,n),b=(1,2)   (long cycle and a transposition ).        s  1   =   (  1  ,  2  )    ,     s  2   =    (  2  ,  3  )   ,  …    ,    s   n  -  1    =   (   n  -  1   ,  n  )        formulae-sequence     subscript  s  1    1  2     formulae-sequence     subscript  s  2     2  3   normal-…       subscript  s    n  1       n  1   n       s_{1}=(1,2),s_{2}=(2,3),\dots,s_{n-1}=(n-1,n)   ( Coxeter generators ). In this case a Hamiltonian cycle is generated by the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm .  any set of transpositions corresponding to a labelled tree on    {  1  ,  2  ,  .  .  ,  n  }     fragments  normal-{  1  normal-,  2  normal-,  normal-.  normal-.  normal-,  n  normal-}    \{1,2,..,n\}   .       a  =   (  1  ,  2  )    ,    b  =    (  1  ,  2  )    (  3  ,  4  )   ⋯    ,   c  =    (  2  ,  3  )    (  4  ,  5  )   ⋯        formulae-sequence    a   1  2     formulae-sequence    b     1  2    3  4   normal-⋯      c     2  3    4  5   normal-⋯       a=(1,2),b=(1,2)(3,4)\cdots,c=(2,3)(4,5)\cdots      Stong has shown that the conjecture holds for the Cayley graph of the wreath product  Z m wr Z n with the natural minimal generating set when m is either even or three. In particular this holds for the cube-connected cycles , which can be generated as the Cayley graph of the wreath product Z 2 wr Z n . 5  General groups  For general finite groups, only a few results are known:        S  =   {  a  ,  b  }    ,     (   a  b   )   2   =  1      formulae-sequence    S   a  b       superscript    a  b   2   1     S=\{a,b\},(ab)^{2}=1   ( R.A. Rankin generators)       S  =   {  a  ,  b  ,  c  }    ,    a  2   =   b  2   =   c  2   =   [  a  ,  b  ]   =  1      formulae-sequence    S   a  b  c         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2         superscript  c  2         a  b        1      S=\{a,b,c\},a^{2}=b^{2}=c^{2}=[a,b]=1   ( Rapaport-Strasser generators)       S  =   {  a  ,  b  ,  c  }    ,     a  2   =  1   ,   c  =    a   -  1    b  a        formulae-sequence    S   a  b  c     formulae-sequence     superscript  a  2   1     c     superscript  a    1    b  a       S=\{a,b,c\},a^{2}=1,c=a^{-1}ba   ( Pak - Radoičić generators 6 )        S  =   {  a  ,  b  }    ,    a  2   =   b  s   =    (   a  b   )   3   =  1    ,     formulae-sequence    S   a  b         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  s         superscript    a  b   3        1      S=\{a,b\},a^{2}=b^{s}=(ab)^{3}=1,   where      |  G  |   ,  s   =    2   m  o   d   4          G   s     2  m  o  d  4     |G|,s=2~{}mod~{}4   (here we have (2,s,3)- presentation , Glover-Marušič theorem 7 ).   Finally, it is known that for every finite group   G   G   G   there exists a generating set of size at most     log  2    |  G  |       subscript   2     G     \log_{2}|G|   such that the corresponding Cayley graph is Hamiltonian (Pak-Radoičić). This result is based on classification of finite simple groups .  The Lovász conjecture was also established for random generating sets of size    Ω   (    log  5    |  G  |    )       normal-Ω    superscript   5     G      \Omega(\log^{5}|G|)   . 8  References  "  Category:Algebraic graph theory  Category:Conjectures  Category:Finite groups  Category:Graph theory  Category:Group theory  Category:Hamiltonian paths and cycles     L.
