Derivation of the Routh array

The Routh array is a tabular method permitting one to establish the stability of a system using only the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. Central to the field of control systems design, the Routh–Hurwitz theorem and Routh array emerge by using the Euclidean algorithm and Sturm's theorem in evaluating Cauchy indices.
The Cauchy index
Given the system:



Assuming no roots of 
 
 
 
  lie on the imaginary axis, and letting


 
  = The number of roots of 
 
 
 
  with negative real parts, and


 
  = The number of roots of 
 
 
 
  with positive real parts
then we have



Expressing 
 
 
 
  in polar form, we have



where



and



from (2) note that



where



Now if the ith root of 
 
 
 
  has a positive real part, then (using the notation y=(RE[y],IM[y]))



and



Similarly, if the ith root of 
 
 
 
  has a negative real part,



and



Therefore, 
 
 
 
  when the ith root of 
 
 
 
  has a positive real part, and 
 
 
 
  when the ith root of 
 
 
 
  has a negative real part. Alternatively,



and



So, if we define



then we have the relationship



and combining (3) and (16) gives us


 
  and 
 
 

Therefore, given an equation of 
 
 
 
  of degree 
 
 
 
  we need only evaluate this function 
 
 
 
  to determine 
 
 
 
 , the number of roots with negative real parts and 
 
 
 
 , the number of roots with positive real parts.

Equations (13) and (14) show that at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an integer multiple of 
 
 
 
 . Note now, in accordance with (6) and Figure 1, the graph of 
 
 
 
  vs 
 
 
 
 , that varying 
 
 
 
  over an interval (a,b) where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integer multiples of 
 
 
 
 , this variation causing the function 
 
 
 
  to have increased by 
 
 
 
 , indicates that in the course of travelling from point a to point b, 
 
 
 
  has "jumped" from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  one more time than it has jumped from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, if we vary 
 
 
 
  over an interval (a,b) this variation causing 
 
 
 
  to have decreased by 
 
 
 
 , where again 
 
 
 
  is a multiple of 
 
 
 
  at both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , implies that 
 
 
 
  has jumped from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  one more time than it has jumped from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  was varied over the said interval.
Thus, 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  times the difference between the number of points at which 
 
 
 
  jumps from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and the number of points at which 
 
 
 
  jumps from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  ranges over the interval 
 
 
 
  provided that at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is defined.

In the case where the starting point is on an incongruity (i.e. 
 
 
 
 , i = 0, 1, 2, ...) the ending point will be on an incongruity as well, by equation (16) (since 
 
 
 
  is an integer and 
 
 
 
  is an integer, 
 
 
 
  will be an integer). In this case, we can achieve this same index (difference in positive and negative jumps) by shifting the axes of the tangent function by 
 
 
 
 , through adding 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Thus, our index is now fully defined for any combination of coefficients in 
 
 
 
  by evaluating 
 
 
 
  over the interval (a,b) = 
 
 
 
  when our starting (and thus ending) point is not an incongruity, and by evaluating



over said interval when our starting point is at an incongruity.
This difference, 
 
 
 
 , of negative and positive jumping incongruities encountered while traversing 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is called the Cauchy Index of the tangent of the phase angle, the phase angle being 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , depending as 
 
 
 
  is an integer multiple of 
 
 
 
  or not.
The Routh criterion
To derive Routh's criterion, first we'll use a different notation to differentiate between the even and odd terms of 
 
 
 
 :



Now we have:



Therefore, if 
 
 
 
  is even,



and if 
 
 
 
  is odd:



Now observe that if 
 
 
 
  is an odd integer, then by (3) 
 
 
 
  is odd. If 
 
 
 
  is an odd integer, then 
 
 
 
  is odd as well. Similarly, this same argument shows that when 
 
 
 
  is even, 
 
 
 
  will be even. Equation (13) shows that if 
 
 
 
  is even, 
 
 
 
  is an integer multiple of 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, 
 
 
 
  is defined for 
 
 
 
  even, and is thus the proper index to use when n is even, and similarly 
 
 
 
  is defined for 
 
 
 
  odd, making it the proper index in this latter case.
Thus, from (6) and (22), for 
 
 
 
  even:



and from (18) and (23), for 
 
 
 
  odd:



Lo and behold we are evaluating the same Cauchy index for both:



Sturm's theorem
Sturm gives us a method for evaluating 
 
 
 
 . His theorem states as follows:
Given a sequence of polynomials 
 
 
 
  where:
1) If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 

2) 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 

and we define 
 
 
 
  as the number of changes of sign in the sequence 
 
 
 
  for a fixed value of 
 
 
 
 , then:



A sequence satisfying these requirements is obtained using the Euclidean algorithm, which is as follows:
Starting with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and denoting the remainder of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and similarly denoting the remainder of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , and so on, we obtain the relationships:



or in general



where the last non-zero remainder, 
 
 
 
  will therefore be the highest common factor of 
 
 
 
 . It can be observed that the sequence so constructed will satisfy the conditions of Sturm's theorem, and thus an algorithm for determining the stated index has been developed.
It is in applying Sturm's theorem (28) to (26), through the use of the Euclidean algorithm above that the Routh matrix is formed.
We get



and identifying the coefficients of this remainder by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and so forth, makes our formed remainder



where



Continuing with the Euclidean algorithm on these new coefficients gives us



where we again denote the coefficients of the remainder 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ,
making our formed remainder



and giving us



The rows of the Routh array are determined exactly by this algorithm when applied to the coefficients of (19). An observation worthy of note is that in the regular case the polynomials 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have as the highest common factor 
 
 
 
  and thus there will be 
 
 
 
  polynomials in the chain 
 
 
 
 .
Note now, that in determining the signs of the members of the sequence of polynomials 
 
 
 
  that at 
 
 
 
  the dominating power of 
 
 
 
  will be the first term of each of these polynomials, and thus only these coefficients corresponding to the highest powers of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , which are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... determine the signs of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 .
So we get 
 
 
 
  that is, 
 
 
 
  is the number of changes of sign in the sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... which is the number of sign changes in the sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... and 
 
 
 
 ; that is 
 
 
 
  is the number of changes of sign in the sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... which is the number of sign changes in the sequence 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ...
Since our chain 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... will have 
 
 
 
  members it is clear that 
 
 
 
  since within 
 
 
 
  if going from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  a sign change has not occurred, within 
 
 
 
  going from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  one has, and likewise for all 
 
 
 
  transitions (there will be no terms equal to zero) giving us 
 
 
 
  total sign changes.
As 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and from (17) 
 
 
 
 , we have that 
 
 
 
  and have derived Routh's theorem -
The number of roots of a real polynomial 
 
 
 
  which lie in the right half plane 
 
 
 
  is equal to the number of changes of sign in the first column of the Routh scheme.
And for the stable case where 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  by which we have Routh's famous criterion:
In order for all the roots of the polynomial 
 
 
 
  to have negative real parts, it is necessary and sufficient that all of the elements in the first column of the Routh scheme be different from zero and of the same sign.
