   Byers-Yang theorem      Byers-Yang theorem   In quantum mechanics , the Byers-Yang theorem states that all physical properties of a doubly-connected system (an annulus) enclosing a magnetic flux   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   through the opening are periodic in the flux with period     Φ  0   =   h  /  e        subscript  normal-Φ  0     h  e     \Phi_{0}=h/e   (the magnetic flux quantum ). The theorem was first stated and proven by Nina Byers and Chen-Ning Yang (1961), 1 and further developed by Felix Bloch (1970). 2  Proof  An enclosed flux   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   corresponds to a vector potential    A   (  r  )       A  r    A(r)   inside the annulus with a line integral      ∮  C     A  ⋅  d   l    =  Φ        subscript  contour-integral  C      normal-⋅  A  d   l    normal-Φ    \oint_{C}A\cdot dl=\Phi   along any path   C   C   C   that circulates around once. One can try to eliminate this vector potential by the gauge transformation        ψ  ′    (   {   r  n   }   )    =    exp   (     i  e   ℏ     ∑  j    χ   (   r  j   )      )    ψ   (   {   r  n   }   )           superscript  ψ  normal-′     subscript  r  n               i  e   Planck-constant-over-2-pi     subscript   j     χ   subscript  r  j       ψ    subscript  r  n       \psi^{\prime}(\{r_{n}\})=\exp\left(\frac{ie}{\hbar}\sum_{j}\chi(r_{j})\right)%
 \psi(\{r_{n}\})   of the wave function     ψ   (   {   r  n   }   )       ψ    subscript  r  n      \psi(\{r_{n}\})   of electrons at positions     r  1   ,   r  2   ,  …      subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2   normal-…    r_{1},r_{2},\ldots   . The gauge-transformed wave function satisfies the same Schrödinger equation as the original wave function, but with a different magnetic vector potential       A  ′    (  r  )    =    A   (  r  )    +    ∇  χ    (  r  )            superscript  A  normal-′   r       A  r      normal-∇  χ   r      A^{\prime}(r)=A(r)+\nabla\chi(r)   . It is assumed that the electrons experience zero magnetic field     B   (  r  )    =    ∇  ×  A    (  r  )    =  0          B  r       normal-∇  A   r        0     B(r)=\nabla\times A(r)=0   at all points   r   r   r   inside the annulus, the field being nonzero only within the opening (where there are no electrons). It is then always possible to find a function    χ   (  r  )       χ  r    \chi(r)   such that      A  ′    (  r  )    =  0         superscript  A  normal-′   r   0    A^{\prime}(r)=0   inside the annulus, so one would conclude that the system with enclosed flux   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is equivalent to a system with zero enclosed flux.  However, for any arbitrary   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   the gauge transformed wave function is no longer single-valued: The phase of    ψ  ′     superscript  ψ  normal-′    \psi^{\prime}   changes by       δ  ϕ   =    (   e  /  ℏ   )     ∮  C       ∇  χ    (  r  )    ⋅  d   l     =    2  π  Φ   /   Φ  0            δ  ϕ       e  Planck-constant-over-2-pi     subscript  contour-integral  C      normal-⋅     normal-∇  χ   r   d   l              2  π  normal-Φ    subscript  normal-Φ  0       \delta\phi=(e/\hbar)\oint_{C}\nabla\chi(r)\cdot dl=2\pi\Phi/\Phi_{0}   whenever one of the coordinates    r  n     subscript  r  n    r_{n}   is moved along the ring to its starting point. The requirement of a single-valued wave function therefore restricts the gauge transformation to fluxes   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   that are an integer multiple of    Φ  0     subscript  normal-Φ  0    \Phi_{0}   . Systems that enclose a flux differing by a multiple of    h  /  e      h  e    h/e   are equivalent.  Applications  An overview of physical effects governed by the Byers-Yang theorem is given by Yoseph Imry . 3 These include the Aharonov-Bohm effect , persistent current in normal metals, and flux quantization in superconductors.
