Controllability Gramian

In control theory, the controllability Gramian is a Gramian used to determine whether or not a linear system is controllable. For the time-invariant linear system



if all eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  have negative real part, then the unique solution 
 
 
 
  of the Lyapunov equation


 
  is positive definite if and only if the pair 
 
 
 
 
  is controllable. 
 
 
 
  is known as the controllability Gramian and can also be expressed as



A related matrix used for determining controllability is



The pair 
 
 
 
  is controllable if and only if the matrix 
 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular, for any 
 
 
 
 .12 A physical interpretation of the controllability Gramian is that if the input to the system is white gaussian noise, then 
 
 
 
  is the covariance of the state.3
Linear time-variant state space models of form


 
 ,



are controllable in an interval 
 
 
 
 
  if and only if the Gramian matrix 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular, where
