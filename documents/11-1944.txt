   Parker vector      Parker vector   In mathematics , especially the field of group theory , the Parker vector is an integer vector that describes a permutation group in terms of the cycle structure of its elements.  Definition  The Parker vector P of a permutation group G acting on a set of size n , is the vector whose k th component for k = 1, …, n is given by:       P  k   =    k   |  G  |      ∑   g  ∈  G      c  k    (  g  )           subscript  P  k       k    G      subscript     g  G       subscript  c  k   g       P_{k}=\frac{k}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}c_{k}(g)   where c k ( g ) is the number of k -cycles in the cycle decomposition of g .  Applications  The Parker vector can assist in the recognition of Galois groups .  References      "  Category:Permutation groups
