Parker vector

In mathematics, especially the field of group theory, the Parker vector is an integer vector that describes a permutation group in terms of the cycle structure of its elements.
Definition
The Parker vector P of a permutation group G acting on a set of size n, is the vector whose kth component for k = 1, â€¦, n is given by:


 
  where ck(g) is the number of k-cycles in the cycle decomposition of g.
Applications
The Parker vector can assist in the recognition of Galois groups.
