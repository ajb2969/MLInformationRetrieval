In physics a force field is a vector field that describes a non-contact force acting on a particle at various positions in space. Specifically, a force field is a vector field 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the force that a particle would feel if it were at the point

Examples of force fields

In Newtonian gravity, a particle of mass M creates a gravitational field

 
 , where the radial unit vector 
 
 
 
  points away from the particle. The gravitational force experienced by a particle of mass m is given by 
 
 
 
 . 23
An electric field

 
  is a vector field. It exerts a force on a point charge q given by 
 
 
 
 . 4
a gravitational force field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body.,5

Restriction to position-dependent forces
Some forces, including friction, air drag, and the magnetic force on a charged particle, depend on the particle's velocity as well as its position. Therefore these forces are not characterized by a force field.
Work done by a force field
As a particle moves through a force field along a path C, the work done by the force is a line integral


 
  This value is independent of the velocity/momentum that the particle travels along the path. For a conservative force field, it is also independent of the path itself, but depends only on the starting and ending points. Therefore, if the starting and ending points are the same, the work is zero for a conservative field:


 
  If the field is conservative, the work done can be more easily evaluated by realizing that a conservative vector field can be written as the gradient of some scalar potential function:



The work done is then simply the difference in the value of this potential in the starting and end points of the path. If these points are given by x = a and x = b, respectively:
