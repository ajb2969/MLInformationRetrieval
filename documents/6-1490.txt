The inflection points of the cross-section are at the surface of the body.   In physics a force field is a vector field that describes a non-contact force acting on a particle at various positions in space . Specifically, a force field is a vector field     F  →    (   x  →   )        normal-→  F    normal-→  x     \vec{F}(\vec{x})   , where    F  →     normal-→  F    \vec{F}   is the force that a particle would feel if it were at the point    x  →     normal-→  x    \vec{x}   . 1  Examples of force fields   In Newtonian gravity , a particle of mass M creates a gravitational field      g  →   =     -   G  M     r  2     r  ^         normal-→  g           G  M     superscript  r  2     normal-^  r      \vec{g}=\frac{-GM}{r^{2}}\hat{r}   , where the radial unit vector    r  ^     normal-^  r    \hat{r}   points away from the particle. The gravitational force experienced by a particle of mass m is given by     F  →   =   m   g  →         normal-→  F     m   normal-→  g      \vec{F}=m\vec{g}   . 2 3  An electric field     E  →     normal-→  E    \vec{E}   is a vector field. It exerts a force on a point charge  q given by     F  →   =   q   E  →         normal-→  F     q   normal-→  E      \vec{F}=q\vec{E}   . 4  a gravitational force field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body., 5   Restriction to position-dependent forces  Some forces, including friction , air drag , and the magnetic force on a charged particle, depend on the particle's velocity as well as its position. Therefore these forces are not characterized by a force field.  Work done by a force field  As a particle moves through a force field along a path C , the work done by the force is a line integral      W  =    ∫  C      F  →   ⋅  d    r  →         W    subscript   C      normal-⋅   normal-→  F   d    normal-→  r       W=\int_{C}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}   This value is independent of the velocity/momentum that the particle travels along the path. For a conservative force field , it is also independent of the path itself, but depends only on the starting and ending points. Therefore, if the starting and ending points are the same, the work is zero for a conservative field:        ∮  C      F  →   ⋅  d    r  →     =  0        subscript  contour-integral  C      normal-⋅   normal-→  F   d    normal-→  r     0    \oint_{C}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}=0   If the field is conservative, the work done can be more easily evaluated by realizing that a conservative vector field can be written as the gradient of some scalar potential function:       F  →   =   ∇  ϕ        normal-→  F    normal-∇  ϕ     \vec{F}=\nabla\phi     The work done is then simply the difference in the value of this potential in the starting and end points of the path. If these points are given by x = a and x = b, respectively:      W  =    ϕ   (  b  )    -   ϕ   (  a  )         W      ϕ  b     ϕ  a      W=\phi(b)-\phi(a)     See also   Field line  Force   References  "  Category:Force     [ http://books.google.com/books?id=akbi_iLSMa4C&pg; ;=PA211 Mathematical methods in chemical engineering, by V.
