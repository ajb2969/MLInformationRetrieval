   Tennis racket theorem      Tennis racket theorem   The tennis racket theorem is a result in classical mechanics describing movement of a rigid body with three distinct principal moments of inertia . It is also dubbed the Dzhanibekov effect , after Russian  astronaut  Vladimir Dzhanibekov who discovered the theorem's consequences while in space in 1985. 1 An article explaining the effect was published in 1991. 2  The theorem describes the following effect: rotation of an object about its first and third principal axes is stable, while rotation about its second principal axis is not. This can be demonstrated with the following experiment: hold a tennis racket at its handle, with face horizontal, and try to throw it in the air so that it will perform a full rotation about the horizontal axis perpendicular to the handle, and try to catch the handle. In almost all cases, during that rotation the face will also have completed a half rotation, so that the other face is now up. By contrast, it is easy to throw the racket so that it will rotate about the handle axis (the third principal axis) without accompanying half-rotation about another axis; it is also possible to make it rotate about the vertical axis perpendicular to the handle (the first principal axis) without any accompanying half-rotation.  The experiment can be performed with any object that has three different moments of inertia, for instance with a book. The effect occurs whenever the axis of rotation differs slightly from the object's second principal axis; air resistance or gravity are not necessary. 3  Qualitative discussion  The tennis racket theorem can be qualitatively analysed with the help of Euler's equations .  Under torque free conditions, they take the following form:       I  1     ω  ˙   1        subscript  I  1    subscript   normal-˙  ω   1     \displaystyle I_{1}\dot{\omega}_{1}     Here     I  1   ,   I  2   ,   I  3       subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2    subscript  I  3     I_{1},I_{2},I_{3}   denote the object's principal moments of inertia, and we assume     I  1   >   I  2   >   I  3          subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2         subscript  I  3      I_{1}>I_{2}>I_{3}   . The angular velocities about the object's three principal axes are     ω  1   ,   ω  2   ,   ω  3       subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2    subscript  ω  3     \omega_{1},\omega_{2},\omega_{3}   .  Consider the situation when the object is rotating about axis with moment of inertia    I  1     subscript  I  1    I_{1}   . To determine the nature of equilibrium, assume small initial angular velocities along the other two axes. As a result, according to equation (1),      ω  ˙    1     subscript   normal-˙  ω   1    ~{}\dot{\omega}_{1}   is very small. Therefore the time dependence of     ω   1     subscript  ω  1    ~{}\omega_{1}   may be neglected.  Now, differentiating equation (2) and substituting     ω  ˙   3     subscript   normal-˙  ω   3    \dot{\omega}_{3}   from equation (3),       I  2    I  3     ω  ¨   2        subscript  I  2    subscript  I  3    subscript   normal-¨  ω   2     \displaystyle I_{2}I_{3}\ddot{\omega}_{2}     Note that    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   is being opposed and so rotation around this axis is stable for the object.  Similar reasoning gives that rotation around axis with moment of inertia    I  3     subscript  I  3    I_{3}   is also stable.  Now apply the same analysis to axis with moment of inertia    I  2     subscript  I  2    I_{2}   . This time     ω  ˙   2     subscript   normal-˙  ω   2    \dot{\omega}_{2}   is very small. Therefore the time dependence of     ω   2     subscript  ω  2    ~{}\omega_{2}   may be neglected.  Now, differentiating equation (1) and substituting     ω  ˙   3     subscript   normal-˙  ω   3    \dot{\omega}_{3}   from equation (3),       I  1    I  3     ω  ¨   1        subscript  I  1    subscript  I  3    subscript   normal-¨  ω   1     \displaystyle I_{1}I_{3}\ddot{\omega}_{1}     Note that    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   is not opposed (and therefore will grow) and so rotation around the 2 axis is unstable . Therefore even a small disturbance along other axes causes the object to 'flip'.
