1,3-beta-oligoglucan phosphorylase

In enzymology, a 1,3-beta-oligoglucan phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(1,3-beta-D-glucosyl)n + phosphate 
 
 
 
  (1,3-beta-D-glucosyl)n-1 + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1,3-beta-D-glucosyl)n and phosphate, whereas its two products are (1,3-beta-D-glucosyl)n-1 and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,3-beta-D-oligoglucan:phosphate alpha-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include beta-1,3-oligoglucan:orthophosphate glucosyltransferase II, and beta-1,3-oligoglucan phosphorylase.
