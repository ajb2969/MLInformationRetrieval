   2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase      2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase   2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine dehydrogenase (, neoA (gene name) , kanK (gene name) ) is an enzyme with system name 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine:NAD(P) + 1-oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inosose + NAD(P)H + H +    This enzyme requires zinc .
