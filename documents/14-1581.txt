Fréchet-Kolmogorov theorem

In functional analysis, the Fréchet-Kolmogorov theorem (the names of Riesz or Weil are sometimes added as well) gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of functions to be relatively compact in an Lp space. It can be thought of as an Lp version of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, from which it can be deduced.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a bounded set in 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 .
The subset B is relatively compact if and only if the following properties hold:



 
  uniformly on B,


 
  uniformly on B,

where 
 
 
 
  denotes the translation of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 

The second property can be stated as 
 
 
 
  such that
