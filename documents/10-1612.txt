   Allantoin racemase      Allantoin racemase   In enzymology , an allantoin racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)(+)-allantoin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)(-)-allantoin   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (S)(+)-allantoin , and one product , (R)(-)-allantoin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on other compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is allantoin racemase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 5.1.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
