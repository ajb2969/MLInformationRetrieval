Momentum compaction

The momentum compaction or momentum compaction factor is a measure for the momentum dependence of the recirculation path length for an object that is bound in cyclic motion (closed orbit). It is used in the calculation of particle paths in circular particle accelerators (like synchrotrons), and for astronomical objects that are bound by gravitation.
For a perturbed orbit, the momentium compaction factor is defined as the derivative of normalized path length difference to normalized momentum1

 
 . 2 Furthermore the momentum compaction is closely connected to the so-called slip-factor3

 
  with the horizontal dispersion 
 
 
 
  and the gyroradius



wherein 
 
 
 
  is the Lorentz factor.
