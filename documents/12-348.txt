   Momentum compaction      Momentum compaction   The momentum compaction or momentum compaction factor is a measure for the momentum dependence of the recirculation path length for an object that is bound in cyclic motion (closed orbit). It is used in the calculation of particle paths in circular particle accelerators (like synchrotrons ), and for astronomical objects that are bound by gravitation .  For a perturbed  orbit , the momentium compaction factor is defined as the derivative of normalized path length difference to normalized momentum 1      α  p   =     d  L   /  L     d  p   /  p    =    p  L     d  L    d  p     =    1  L    ∮      D  x    (  s  )     ρ   (  s  )     d  s            subscript  α  p         normal-d  L   L       normal-d  p   p             p  L       normal-d  L     normal-d  p              1  L    contour-integral         subscript  D  x   s     ρ  s    normal-d  s        \alpha_{p}=\frac{\mathrm{d}L/L}{\mathrm{d}p/p}=\frac{p}{L}\frac{\mathrm{d}L}{%
 \mathrm{d}p}=\frac{1}{L}\oint\frac{D_{x}(s)}{\rho(s)}\mathrm{d}s   . 2 Furthermore the momentum compaction is closely connected to the so-called slip-factor 3    η   η   \eta   with the horizontal dispersion    D  x     subscript  D  x    D_{x}   and the gyroradius    ρ   ρ   \rho        α  p   =    1   γ  2    -  η        subscript  α  p       1   superscript  γ  2    η     \alpha_{p}=\frac{1}{\gamma^{2}}-\eta     wherein   γ   γ   \gamma   is the Lorentz factor .
