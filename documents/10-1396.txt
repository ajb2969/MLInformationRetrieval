   Lactate 2-monooxygenase      Lactate 2-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a lactate 2-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-lactate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + CO 2 + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-lactate and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are acetate , CO 2 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O with incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases o internal mixed-function oxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-lactate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include lactate oxidative decarboxylase , lactate oxidase , lactic oxygenase , lactate oxygenase , lactic oxidase , L-lactate monooxygenase , lactate monooxygenase , and L-lactate-2-monooxygenase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FMN .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
