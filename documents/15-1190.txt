Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase

Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase (, cholate 7alpha-dehydroxylase, 7alpha-dehydroxylase, bile acid 7-dehydroxylase) is an enzyme with system name deoxycholate:NAD+ oxidoreductase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) deoxycholate + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
cholate + NADH + H+

(2) lithocholate + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
chenodeoxycholate + NADH + H+


Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase is highly specific for bile acid substrates.
