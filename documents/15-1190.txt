   Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase      Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase   Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase (, cholate 7alpha-dehydroxylase , 7alpha-dehydroxylase , bile acid 7-dehydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name deoxycholate:NAD + oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) deoxycholate + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    cholate + NADH + H +   (2) lithocholate + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    chenodeoxycholate + NADH + H +    Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydroxylase is highly specific for bile acid substrates.
