   AW*-algebra      AW*-algebra   In mathematics , an AW*-algebra is an algebraic generalization of a W*-algebra . They were introduced by Irving Kaplansky in 1951. 1 As operator algebras , von Neumann algebras, among all C*-algebras , are typically handled using one of two means: they are the dual space of some Banach space , and they are determined to a large extent by their projections. The idea behind AW*-algebras is to forgo the former, topological, condition, and use only the latter, algebraic, condition.  Definition  Recall that a projection of a C*-algebra   A   A   A   is an element    p  ∈  A      p  A    p\in A   satisfying     p  *   =  p  =   p  2          superscript  p    p        superscript  p  2      p^{*}=p=p^{2}   .  A C*-algebra   A   A   A   is an AW*-algebra when for every subset    S  ⊆  A      S  A    S\subseteq A   , the right annihilator        Ann  R    (  S  )    =   {   a  ∈  A   ∣     ∀  s   ∈  S   ,    a  s   =  0    }          subscript  Ann  R   S    conditional-set    a  A    formulae-sequence     for-all  s   S       a  s   0       \mathrm{Ann}_{R}(S)=\{a\in A\mid\forall s\in S,as=0\}\,   is generated as a left ideal by some projection   p   p   p   of   A   A   A   , and similarly the left annihilator is generated as a right ideal by some projection   q   q   q   :         ∀  S   ⊆    A    ∃  p     ,   q  ∈   Proj   (  A  )      :      Ann  R    (  S  )    =   A  p    ,     Ann  L    (  S  )    =   q  A        normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  S     A    p       q    Proj  A      formulae-sequence       subscript  Ann  R   S     A  p         subscript  Ann  L   S     q  A       \forall S\subseteq A\,\exists p,q\in\mathrm{Proj}(A)\colon\mathrm{Ann}_{R}(S)=%
 Ap,\quad\mathrm{Ann}_{L}(S)=qA   .  Hence an AW*-algebra is a C*-algebras that is at the same time a Baer *-ring .  Structure theory  Many results concerning von Neumann algebras carry over to AW*-algebras. For example, AW*-algebras can be classified according to the behavior of their projections, and decompose into types . 2 For another example, normal matrices with entries in an AW*-algebra can always be diagonalized. 3 AW*-algebras also always have polar decomposition . 4  However, there are also ways in which AW*-algebras behave differently from von Neumann algebras. 5 For example, AW*-algebras of type I can exhibit pathological properties, 6 even though Kaplansky already showed that such algebras with trivial center are automatically von Neumann algebras.  The commutative case  By Gelfand duality , any commutative C*-algebra   A   A   A   is isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions    X  →  ℂ     normal-→  X  ℂ    X\to\mathbb{C}   for some compact  Hausdorff space    X   X   X   . If   A   A   A   is an AW*-algebra, then   X   X   X   is in fact a Stonean space . Via Stone duality , commutative AW*-algebras therefore correspond to complete  Boolean algebras . The projections of a commutative AW*-algebra form a complete Boolean algebra, and conversely, any complete Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the projections of some commutative AW*-algebra.
