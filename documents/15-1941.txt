AW*-algebra

In mathematics, an AW*-algebra is an algebraic generalization of a W*-algebra. They were introduced by Irving Kaplansky in 1951.1 As operator algebras, von Neumann algebras, among all C*-algebras, are typically handled using one of two means: they are the dual space of some Banach space, and they are determined to a large extent by their projections. The idea behind AW*-algebras is to forgo the former, topological, condition, and use only the latter, algebraic, condition.
Definition
Recall that a projection of a C*-algebra 
 
 
 
  is an element 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 .
A C*-algebra 
 
 
 
  is an AW*-algebra when for every subset 
 
 
 
 , the right annihilator


 
  is generated as a left ideal by some projection 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , and similarly the left annihilator is generated as a right ideal by some projection 
 
 
 
 :


 
 .
Hence an AW*-algebra is a C*-algebras that is at the same time a Baer *-ring.
Structure theory
Many results concerning von Neumann algebras carry over to AW*-algebras. For example, AW*-algebras can be classified according to the behavior of their projections, and decompose into types.2 For another example, normal matrices with entries in an AW*-algebra can always be diagonalized.3 AW*-algebras also always have polar decomposition.4
However, there are also ways in which AW*-algebras behave differently from von Neumann algebras.5 For example, AW*-algebras of type I can exhibit pathological properties,6 even though Kaplansky already showed that such algebras with trivial center are automatically von Neumann algebras.
The commutative case
By Gelfand duality, any commutative C*-algebra 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions 
 
 
 
  for some compact Hausdorff space

 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is an AW*-algebra, then 
 
 
 
  is in fact a Stonean space. Via Stone duality, commutative AW*-algebras therefore correspond to complete Boolean algebras. The projections of a commutative AW*-algebra form a complete Boolean algebra, and conversely, any complete Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the projections of some commutative AW*-algebra.
