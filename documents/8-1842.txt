   Displacement field (mechanics)      Displacement field (mechanics)   A displacement field is an assignment of displacement vectors for all points in a region or body that is displaced from one state to another. A displacement vector specifies the position of a point or a particle in reference to an origin or to a previous position. For example, a displacement field may be used to describe the effects of deformation on a solid body.  Before considering displacement, the state before deformation must be defined. It is a state in which the coordinates of all points are known and described by the function:        R  →   0   :   Ω  →  P      normal-:   subscript   normal-→  R   0    normal-→  normal-Ω  P     \vec{R}_{0}:\Omega\rightarrow P     where       R  →   0     subscript   normal-→  R   0    \vec{R}_{0}   is a placement vector     Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   are all the points of the body     P   P   P   are all the points in the space in which the body is present  Most often it is a state of the body in which no forces are applied.  Then given any other state of this body in which coordinates of all its points are described as     R  →   1     subscript   normal-→  R   1    \vec{R}_{1}   the displacement field is the difference between two body states:       u  →   =     R  →   1   -    R  →   0         normal-→  u      subscript   normal-→  R   1    subscript   normal-→  R   0      \vec{u}=\vec{R}_{1}-\vec{R}_{0}     where      u  →     normal-→  u    \vec{u}   is a displacement field, which for each point of the body specifies a displacement vector .
