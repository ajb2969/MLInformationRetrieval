   Quasi-finite field      Quasi-finite field   In mathematics , a quasi-finite field 1 is a generalisation of a finite field . Standard local class field theory usually deals with complete valued fields whose residue field is finite (i.e. non-archimedean local fields ), but the theory applies equally well when the residue field is only assumed quasi-finite. 2  Formal definition  A quasi-finite field is a perfect field  K together with an isomorphism of topological groups       œï  :    ùêô  ^   ‚Üí   Gal   (    K  s   /  K   )      ,     normal-:  œï   normal-‚Üí   normal-^  ùêô    Gal     subscript  K  s   K       \phi:\hat{\mathbf{Z}}\to\operatorname{Gal}(K_{s}/K),   where K s is an algebraic closure of K (necessarily separable because K is perfect). The field extension  K s / K is infinite, and the Galois group is accordingly given the Krull topology . The group    ùêô  ^     normal-^  ùêô    \widehat{\mathbf{Z}}   is the profinite completion of integers with respect to its subgroups of finite index.  This definition is equivalent to saying that K has a unique (necessarily cyclic ) extension K n of degree n for each integer n ‚â• 1, and that the union of these extensions is equal to K s . 3 Moreover, as part of the structure of the quasi-finite field, there is a generator F n for each Gal( K n / K ), and the generators must be coherent , in the sense that if n divides m , the restriction of F m to K n is equal to F n .  Examples  The most basic example, which motivates the definition, is the finite field K = GF ( q ). It has a unique cyclic extension of degree n , namely K n = GF ( q n ). The union of the K n is the algebraic closure K s . We take F n to be the Frobenius element ; that is, F n ( x ) = x q .  Another example is K = C (( T )), the ring of formal Laurent series in T over the field C of complex numbers . (These are simply formal power series in which we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree.) Then K has a unique cyclic extension       K  n   =   ùêÇ   (   (   T   1  /  n    )   )         subscript  K  n     ùêÇ   superscript  T    1  n       K_{n}=\mathbf{C}((T^{1/n}))   of degree n for each n ‚â• 1, whose union is an algebraic closure of K called the field of Puiseux series , and that a generator of Gal( K n / K ) is given by         F  n    (   T   1  /  n    )    =    e    2  œÄ  i   /  n     T   1  /  n      .         subscript  F  n    superscript  T    1  n        superscript  e      2  œÄ  i   n     superscript  T    1  n       F_{n}(T^{1/n})=e^{2\pi i/n}T^{1/n}.   This construction works if C is replaced by any algebraically closed field C of characteristic zero. 4  Notes  References      "  Category:Class field theory  Category:Field theory     say that the field satisfies "Moriya's axiom" ‚Ü©  As shown by Mikao Moriya ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©
