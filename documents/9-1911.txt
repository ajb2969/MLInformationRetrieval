   Von Neumann's theorem      Von Neumann's theorem   In mathematics , von Neumann's theorem is a result in the operator theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces .  Statement of the theorem  Let G and H be Hilbert spaces, and let T : dom( T ) ⊆ G → H be an unbounded operator from G into H . Suppose that T is a closed operator and that T is densely defined , i.e. dom( T ) is dense in G . Let T ∗ : dom( T ∗ ) ⊆ H → G denote the adjoint of T . Then T ∗ T is also densely defined, and it is self-adjoint . That is,        (    T  *   T   )   *   =    T  *   T        superscript     superscript  T    T        superscript  T    T     (T^{*}T)^{*}=T^{*}T     and the operators on the right- and left-hand sides have the same dense domain in G .
