   Barrier cone      Barrier cone   In mathematics , specifically functional analysis , the barrier cone is a cone associated to any non-empty subset of a Banach space . It is closely related to the notions of support functions and polar sets .  Definition  Let X be a Banach space and let K be a non-empty subset of X . The barrier cone of K is the subset b ( K ) of X ∗ , the continuous dual space of X , defined by        b   (  K  )    :=   {   ℓ  ∈    X  ∗     |     sup   x  ∈  K     ⟨  ℓ  ,  x  ⟩    <   +  ∞    }    .     assign    b  K    conditional-set    normal-ℓ   superscript  X  normal-∗        subscript  supremum    x  K     normal-ℓ  x            b(K):=\left\{\ell\in X^{\ast}\,\left|\,\sup_{x\in K}\langle\ell,x\rangle<+%
 \infty\right.\right\}.     Related notions  The function        σ  K   :   ℓ  ↦    sup   x  ∈  K     ⟨  ℓ  ,  x  ⟩      ,     normal-:   subscript  σ  K    maps-to  normal-ℓ    subscript  supremum    x  K     normal-ℓ  x       \sigma_{K}\colon\ell\mapsto\sup_{x\in K}\langle\ell,x\rangle,     defined for each continuous linear functional  ℓ on X , is known as the support function of the set K ; thus, the barrier cone of K is precisely the set of continuous linear functionals ℓ for which σ K ( ℓ ) is finite.  The set of continuous linear functionals ℓ for which σ K ( ℓ ) ≤ 1 is known as the polar set of K . The set of continuous linear functionals ℓ for which σ K ( ℓ ) ≤ 0 is known as the (negative) polar cone of K . Clearly, both the polar set and the negative polar cone are subsets of the barrier cone.  References     "  Category:Functional analysis
