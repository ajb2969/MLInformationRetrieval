   Peek's law      Peek's law   In physics , Peek's law defines the electric potential gap necessary for triggering a corona discharge between two wires:         e  v   =    m  v    g  v   r   ln   (   S  r   )          subscript  e  v      subscript  m  v    subscript  g  v   r      S  r       e_{v}=m_{v}g_{v}r\ln\left({S\over r}\right)        e v is the "visual critical corona voltage" or "corona inception voltage" (CIV), the voltage required to initiate a visible corona discharge between the wires.  m v is an irregularity factor to account for the condition of the wires. For smooth, polished wires, m v = 1. For roughened, dirty or weathered wires, 0.98 to 0.93, and for cables , 0.87 to 0.83, namely the surface irregularities result in diminishing the corona threshold voltage.  r is the radius of the wires in cm.  S is the distance between the wires  δ is the air density factor with respect to SATP (25°C and 76 cmHg ):        δ  =   ρ   ρ   S  A  T  P         δ    ρ   subscript  ρ    S  A  T  P       \delta={\rho\over\rho_{SATP}}        g v is the "visual critical" electric field , and is calculated by the equation:         g  v   =    g  0   δ   (   1  +   c    δ  r      )         subscript  g  v      subscript  g  0   δ    1    c      δ  r         g_{v}=g_{0}\delta\left(1+{c\over\sqrt{\delta r}}\right)         where g 0 is the "disruptive electric field", and c is an empirical dimensional constant. The values for those parameters are usually considered to be about 30-32 kV / cm (in air 1 ) and 0.301 cm ½ respectively. This latter law can be considered to hold also in different setups, where the corresponding voltage is different due to geometric reasons.
