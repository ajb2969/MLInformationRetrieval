Peek's law

In physics, Peek's law defines the electric potential gap necessary for triggering a corona discharge between two wires:








ev is the "visual critical corona voltage" or "corona inception voltage" (CIV), the voltage required to initiate a visible corona discharge between the wires.
mv is an irregularity factor to account for the condition of the wires. For smooth, polished wires, mv = 1. For roughened, dirty or weathered wires, 0.98 to 0.93, and for cables, 0.87 to 0.83, namely the surface irregularities result in diminishing the corona threshold voltage.
r is the radius of the wires in cm.
S is the distance between the wires
δ is the air density factor with respect to SATP (25°C and 76 cmHg):








gv is the "visual critical" electric field, and is calculated by the equation:









where g0 is the "disruptive electric field", and c is an empirical dimensional constant. The values for those parameters are usually considered to be about 30-32 kV/cm (in air 1) and 0.301 cm½ respectively. This latter law can be considered to hold also in different setups, where the corresponding voltage is different due to geometric reasons.
