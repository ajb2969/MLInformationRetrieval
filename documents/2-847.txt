   Trace class      Trace class   In mathematics , a trace class operator is a compact operator for which a trace may be defined, such that the trace is finite and independent of the choice of basis. Trace class operators are essentially the same as nuclear operators , though many authors reserve the term "trace class operator" for the special case of nuclear operators on Hilbert spaces , and reserve "nuclear operator" for usage in more general Banach spaces .  Definition  Mimicking the definition for matrices, a bounded linear operator  A over a separable  Hilbert space  H is said to be in the trace class if for some (and hence all) orthonormal bases { e k } k of H the sum of positive terms        ∥  A  ∥   1   =   Tr   |  A  |    :=    ∑  k    ⟨      (    A  *   A   )    1  /  2      e  k    ,   e  k   ⟩           subscript   norm  A   1     Tr    A      assign      subscript   k       superscript     superscript  A    A     1  2     subscript  e  k     subscript  e  k        \|A\|_{1}={\rm Tr}|A|:=\sum_{k}\langle(A^{*}A)^{1/2}\,e_{k},e_{k}\rangle   is finite. In this case, the sum       Tr  A   :=    ∑  k    ⟨   A   e  k    ,   e  k   ⟩       assign    Tr  A     subscript   k      A   subscript  e  k     subscript  e  k       {\rm Tr}A:=\sum_{k}\langle Ae_{k},e_{k}\rangle   is absolutely convergent and is independent of the choice of the orthonormal basis. This value is called the trace of A . When H is finite-dimensional, every operator is trace class and this definition of trace of A coincides with the definition of the trace of a matrix .  By extension, if A is a non-negative self-adjoint operator, we can also define the trace of A as an extended real number by the possibly divergent sum        ∑  k    ⟨   A   e  k    ,   e  k   ⟩    .      subscript   k      A   subscript  e  k     subscript  e  k      \sum_{k}\langle Ae_{k},e_{k}\rangle.     Properties      1.   If A is a non-negative self-adjoint, A is trace class if and only if Tr( A ) + and negative part A − are both trace class. (The positive and negative parts of a self adjoint operator are obtained via the continuous functional calculus .)     2.   The trace is a linear functional over the space of trace class operators, i.e.        Tr   (    a  A   +   b  B    )    =     a    Tr   (  A  )     +    b    Tr   (  B  )       .       Tr      a  A     b  B         a   Tr  A      b   Tr  B       \operatorname{Tr}(aA+bB)=a\,\operatorname{Tr}(A)+b\,\operatorname{Tr}(B).   The bilinear map       ⟨  A  ,  B  ⟩   =   Tr   (    A  *   B   )         A  B    Tr     superscript  A    B      \langle A,B\rangle=\operatorname{Tr}(A^{*}B)   is an inner product on the trace class; the corresponding norm is called the Hilbert–Schmidt norm. The completion of the trace class operators in the Hilbert–Schmidt norm are called the Hilbert–Schmidt operators.     3.   If   A   A   A   is bounded and   B   B   B   is trace class,    A  B      A  B    AB   and    B  A      B  A    BA   are also trace class and 1         ∥   A  B   ∥   1   =   Tr   (   |   A  B   |   )    ≤    ∥  A  ∥     ∥  B  ∥   1     ,     ∥   B  A   ∥   1   =   Tr   (   |   B  A   |   )    ≤    ∥  A  ∥     ∥  B  ∥   1        formulae-sequence       subscript   norm    A  B    1    Tr      A  B             norm  A    subscript   norm  B   1           subscript   norm    B  A    1    Tr      B  A             norm  A    subscript   norm  B   1        \|AB\|_{1}=\operatorname{Tr}(|AB|)\leq\|A\|\|B\|_{1},\qquad\|BA\|_{1}=%
 \operatorname{Tr}(|BA|)\leq\|A\|\|B\|_{1}   and furthermore, under the same hypothesis,       Tr   (   A  B   )    =   Tr   (   B  A   )         Tr    A  B     Tr    B  A      \operatorname{Tr}(AB)=\operatorname{Tr}(BA)   The last assertion also holds under the weaker hypothesis that   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are Hilbert Schmidt.     4.   If   A   A   A   is trace class, then one can define the Fredholm determinant of    1  +  A      1  A    1+A          det   (   I  +  A   )    :=    ∏   n  ≥  1     [   1  +    λ  n    (  A  )     ]       assign    det    I  A      subscript  product    n  1     delimited-[]    1     subscript  λ  n   A        {\rm det}(I+A):=\prod_{n\geq 1}[1+\lambda_{n}(A)]   where     {    λ  n    (  A  )    }   n     subscript      subscript  λ  n   A    n    \{\lambda_{n}(A)\}_{n}   is the spectrum of   A   A   A   . The trace class condition on   A   A   A   guarantees that the infinite product is finite: indeed       det   (   I  +  A   )    ≤   e    ∥  A  ∥   1          det    I  A     superscript  e   subscript   norm  A   1      {\rm det}(I+A)\leq e^{\|A\|_{1}}   . It also implies that     det   (   I  +  A   )    ≠  0        det    I  A    0    {\rm det}(I+A)\neq 0   if and only if    (   I  +  A   )      I  A    (I+A)   is invertible.     Lidskii's theorem  Let   A   A   A   be a trace class operator in a separable Hilbert space   H   H   H   , and let      {    λ  n    (  A  )    }    n  =  1   N   ,     superscript   subscript      subscript  λ  n   A      n  1    N    \{\lambda_{n}(A)\}_{n=1}^{N},       N  ≤  ∞      N     N\leq\infty   be the eigenvalues of   A   A   A   . Let us assume that     λ  n    (  A  )        subscript  λ  n   A    \lambda_{n}(A)   are enumerated with algebraic multiplicities taken into account (i.e. if the algebraic multiplicity of   λ   λ   \lambda   is   k   k   k   then   λ   λ   \lambda   is repeated   k   k   k   times in the list      λ  1    (  A  )    ,    λ  2    (  A  )    ,  …        subscript  λ  1   A      subscript  λ  2   A   normal-…    \lambda_{1}(A),\lambda_{2}(A),\dots   ). Lidskii's theorem (named after Victor Borisovich Lidskii ) states that         ∑   n  =  1   N     λ  n    (  A  )     =   Tr   (  A  )     .        superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  λ  n   A     Tr  A     \sum_{n=1}^{N}\lambda_{n}(A)=\operatorname{Tr}(A).   Note that the series in the left hand side converges absolutely due to Weyl's inequality        ∑   n  =  1   N    |    λ  n    (  A  )    |    ≤    ∑   m  =  1   M     s  m    (  A  )           superscript   subscript     n  1    N        subscript  λ  n   A       superscript   subscript     m  1    M      subscript  s  m   A      \sum_{n=1}^{N}|\lambda_{n}(A)|\leq\sum_{m=1}^{M}s_{m}(A)   between the eigenvalues     {    λ  n    (  A  )    }    n  =  1   N     superscript   subscript      subscript  λ  n   A      n  1    N    \{\lambda_{n}(A)\}_{n=1}^{N}   and the singular values      {    s  m    (  A  )    }    m  =  1   M     superscript   subscript      subscript  s  m   A      m  1    M    \{s_{m}(A)\}_{m=1}^{M}   of a compact operator   A   A   A   . See e.g. 2  Relationship between some classes of operators  One can view certain classes of bounded operators as noncommutative analogue of classical sequence spaces , with trace-class operators as the noncommutative analogue of the sequence space l 1 ( N ).  Indeed, it is possible to apply the spectral theorem to show that every normal trace-class operator on a separable Hilbert space can be realized in a certain way as an l 1 sequence, with respect to some choice of a pair of Hilbert bases. In the same vein, the bounded operators are noncommutative versions of l ∞ ( N ), the compact operators that of c 0 (the sequences convergent to 0), Hilbert–Schmidt operators correspond to l 2 ( N ), and finite-rank operators the sequences that have only finitely many non-zero terms. To some extent, the relationships between these classes of operators are similar to the relationships between their commutative counterparts.  Recall that every compact operator T on a Hilbert space takes the following canonical form        ∀  h   ∈  H   ,     T  h   =     ∑   i  =  1      α  i    ⟨  h  ,   v  i   ⟩    u  i     where       α  i   ≥   0  and      α  i   →  0        formulae-sequence     for-all  h   H    formulae-sequence      T  h      subscript     i  1       subscript  α  i    h   subscript  v  i     subscript  u  i     where     formulae-sequence     subscript  α  i    0  and     normal-→   subscript  α  i   0       \forall h\in H,\;Th=\sum_{i=1}\alpha_{i}\langle h,v_{i}\rangle u_{i}\quad\mbox%
 {where}\quad\alpha_{i}\geq 0\quad\mbox{and}\quad\alpha_{i}\rightarrow 0     for some orthonormal bases { u i } and { v i }. Making the above heuristic comments more precise, we have that T is trace class if the series ∑ i  α i is convergent, T is Hilbert–Schmidt if ∑ i  α i 2 is convergent, and T is finite rank if the sequence { α i } has only finitely many nonzero terms.  The above description allows one to obtain easily some facts that relate these classes of operators. For example, the following inclusions hold and they are all proper when H is infinite dimensional: {finite rank} ⊂ {trace class} ⊂ {Hilbert–Schmidt} ⊂ {compact}.  The trace-class operators are given the trace norm || T || 1 = Tr [ ( T*T ) ½ ] = ∑ i  α i . The norm corresponding to the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product is || T || 2 = (Tr T*T ) ½ = (∑ i α i 2 ) ½ . Also, the usual operator norm is || T || = sup i ( α i ). By classical inequalities regarding sequences,        ∥  T  ∥   ≤    ∥  T  ∥   2   ≤    ∥  T  ∥   1    ,         norm  T    subscript   norm  T   2         subscript   norm  T   1      \|T\|\leq\|T\|_{2}\leq\|T\|_{1},     for appropriate T .  It is also clear that finite-rank operators are dense in both trace-class and Hilbert–Schmidt in their respective norms.  Trace class as the dual of compact operators  The dual space of c 0 is l 1 ( N ). Similarly, we have that the dual of compact operators, denoted by K ( H )*, is the trace-class operators, denoted by C 1 . The argument, which we now sketch, is reminiscent of that for the corresponding sequence spaces. Let f ∈ K ( H )*, we identify f with the operator T f defined by        ⟨    T  f   x   ,  y  ⟩   =   f   (   S   x  ,  y    )     ,          subscript  T  f   x   y     f   subscript  S   x  y       \langle T_{f}x,y\rangle=f(S_{x,y}),     where S x,y is the rank-one operator given by         S   x  ,  y     (  h  )    =    ⟨  h  ,  y  ⟩   x    .         subscript  S   x  y    h      h  y   x     S_{x,y}(h)=\langle h,y\rangle x.     This identification works because the finite-rank operators are norm-dense in K ( H ). In the event that T f is a positive operator, for any orthonormal basis u i , one has         ∑  i    ⟨    T  f    u  i    ,   u  i   ⟩    =   f   (  I  )    ≤   ∥  f  ∥    ,          subscript   i       subscript  T  f    subscript  u  i     subscript  u  i       f  I         norm  f      \sum_{i}\langle T_{f}u_{i},u_{i}\rangle=f(I)\leq\|f\|,     where I is the identity operator       I  =    ∑  i     ⟨  ⋅  ,   u  i   ⟩    u  i      .      I    subscript   i      normal-⋅   subscript  u  i     subscript  u  i       I=\sum_{i}\langle\cdot,u_{i}\rangle u_{i}.     But this means T f is trace-class. An appeal to polar decomposition extend this to the general case where T f need not be positive.  A limiting argument via finite-rank operators shows that || T f || 1 = || f ||. Thus K ( H )* is isometrically isomorphic to C 1 .  As the predual of bounded operators  Recall that the dual of l 1 ( N ) is l ∞ ( N ). In the present context, the dual of trace-class operators C 1 is the bounded operators B( H ). More precisely, the set C 1 is a two-sided ideal in B( H ). So given any operator T in B( H ), we may define a continuous  linear functional φ T on    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   by φ T ( A )=Tr( AT ). This correspondence between bounded linear operators and elements φ T of the dual space of    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   is an isometric isomorphism . It follows that B( H ) is the dual space of    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   . This can be used to define the weak-* topology on B( H ).  Notes    References   Dixmier, J. (1969).
