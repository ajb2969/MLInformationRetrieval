   Lester's theorem      Lester's theorem   (Figure)  The Fermat points     X  13   ,   X  14       subscript  X  13    subscript  X  14     X_{13},X_{14}   , the center    X  5     subscript  X  5    X_{5}   of the nine-point circle (light blue), and the circumcenter    X  3     subscript  X  3    X_{3}   of the green triangle lie on the Lester circle (black).   In Euclidean plane  geometry , Lester's theorem , named after June Lester , states that in any scalene triangle , the two Fermat points , the nine-point center , and the circumcenter  lie on the same circle .  Proofs  Gibert's proof using the Kiepert hyperbola  Lester's circle theorem follows from a more general result by B. Gibert (2000); namely, that every circle whose diameter is a chord of the Kiepert hyperbola of the triangle and is perpendicular to its Euler line passes through the Fermat points . 1  2  Dao's lemma on the rectangular hyperbola  In 2014, Đào Thanh Oai showed that Gibert's result follows from a property of rectangular hyperbolas . Namely, let   H   H   H   and   G   G   G   lie on one branch of a rectangular hyperbola   S   S   S   , and    F  +     subscript  F     F_{+}   and    F  -     subscript  F     F_{-}   be the two points on   S   S   S   , symmetrical about its center ( antipodal points ), where the tangents at   S   S   S   are parallel to the line     H  G      H  G    HG   ,  Let    K  +     subscript  K     K_{+}   and    K  -     subscript  K     K_{-}   two points on the hyperbola the tangents at which intersect at a point   E   E   E   on the line    H  G      H  G    HG   . If the line     K  +    K  -        subscript  K     subscript  K      K_{+}K_{-}   intersects    H  G      H  G    HG   at   D   D   D   , and the perpendicular bisector of    D  E      D  E    DE   intersects the hyperbola at    G  +     subscript  G     G_{+}   and    G  -     subscript  G     G_{-}   , then the six points     F  +   ,   F  -   ,  E  ,  F  ,   G  +   ,   G  -       subscript  F     subscript  F    E  F   subscript  G     subscript  G      F_{+},F_{-},E,F,G_{+},G_{-}   lie on a circle.  To get Lester's theorem from this result, take   S   S   S   as the Kiepert hyperbola of the triangle, take     F  +   ,   F  -       subscript  F     subscript  F      F_{+},F_{-}   to be its Fermat points,     K  +   ,   K  -       subscript  K     subscript  K      K_{+},K_{-}   be the inner and outer Vecten points ,    H  ,  G     H  G    H,G   be the orthocenter and the centroid of the triangle. 3  Generalisation  (Figure)  A generalization Lester circle associated with Neuberg cubic    P  ,   Q   (  P  )    ,   X  13   ,   X  14      P    Q  P    subscript  X  13    subscript  X  14     P,Q(P),X_{13},X_{14}   lie on a circle   There is a conjecture generalization of the Lester theorem was published in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers as follows: Let P be a point on the Neuberg cubic . Let P A be the reflection of P in line BC, and define P B and P C cyclically. It is known that the lines AP A , BP B , CP C concur. Let Q(P) be the point of concurrence. Then the following 4 points lie on a circle: X(13), X(14), P, Q(P). 4 When P=X(3), it is well-know that Q(P)=Q(X(3))=X(5), the conjucture becomes Lester theorem.
