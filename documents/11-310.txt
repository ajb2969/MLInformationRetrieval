The Fermat points 
 
 
 
 , the center 
 
 
 
  of the nine-point circle (light blue), and the circumcenter 
 
 
 
  of the green triangle lie on the Lester circle (black).

In Euclidean plane geometry, Lester's theorem, named after June Lester, states that in any scalene triangle, the two Fermat points, the nine-point center, and the circumcenter lie on the same circle.
Proofs
Gibert's proof using the Kiepert hyperbola
Lester's circle theorem follows from a more general result by B. Gibert (2000); namely, that every circle whose diameter is a chord of the Kiepert hyperbola of the triangle and is perpendicular to its Euler line passes through the Fermat points.1 2
Dao's lemma on the rectangular hyperbola
 In 2014, Đào Thanh Oai showed that Gibert's result follows from a property of rectangular hyperbolas. Namely, let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  lie on one branch of a rectangular hyperbola 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the two points on 
 
 
 
 , symmetrical about its center (antipodal points), where the tangents at 
 
 
 
  are parallel to the line

 
 ,
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  two points on the hyperbola the tangents at which intersect at a point 
 
 
 
  on the line 
 
 
 
 . If the line 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , and the perpendicular bisector of 
 
 
 
  intersects the hyperbola at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the six points 
 
 
 
  lie on a circle.
To get Lester's theorem from this result, take 
 
 
 
  as the Kiepert hyperbola of the triangle, take 
 
 
 
  to be its Fermat points, 
 
 
 
  be the inner and outer Vecten points, 
 
 
 
  be the orthocenter and the centroid of the triangle.3
Generalisation

  lie on a circle

There is a conjecture generalization of the Lester theorem was published in Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers as follows: Let P be a point on the Neuberg cubic. Let PA be the reflection of P in line BC, and define PB and PC cyclically. It is known that the lines APA, BPB, CPC concur. Let Q(P) be the point of concurrence. Then the following 4 points lie on a circle: X(13), X(14), P, Q(P). 4 When P=X(3), it is well-know that Q(P)=Q(X(3))=X(5), the conjucture becomes Lester theorem.
