   Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem      Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem   In mathematics , the Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem classifies holomorphic  vector bundles over the complex projective line . In particular every holomorphic vector bundle over    ℂ   ℙ  1       ℂ   superscript  ℙ  1     \mathbb{CP}^{1}   is a direct sum of holomorphic line bundles . The theorem was proved by , and is more or less equivalent to Birkhoff factorization introduced by .  Statement  More precisely, the statement of the theorem is as the following.  Every holomorphic vector bundle    ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   on    ℂ   ℙ  1       ℂ   superscript  ℙ  1     \mathbb{CP}^{1}   is holomorphically isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles:       ℰ  ≅    𝒪   (   a  1   )    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   𝒪   (   a  n   )      .      ℰ   direct-sum    𝒪   subscript  a  1    normal-⋯    𝒪   subscript  a  n       \mathcal{E}\cong\mathcal{O}(a_{1})\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathcal{O}(a_{n}).     The notation implies each summand is a Serre twist some number of times of the trivial bundle . The representation is unique up to permuting factors.  Generalization  The same result holds in algebraic geometry for algebraic vector bundle over    ℙ  k  1     subscript   superscript  ℙ  1   k    \mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}   for any field   k   k   k   . 1  See also   Algebraic geometry of projective spaces  Euler sequence  Splitting principle  K-theory  Jumping line   References     .   .
