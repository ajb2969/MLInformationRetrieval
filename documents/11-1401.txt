Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem

In mathematics, the Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem classifies holomorphic vector bundles over the complex projective line. In particular every holomorphic vector bundle over 
 
 
 
  is a direct sum of holomorphic line bundles. The theorem was proved by , and is more or less equivalent to Birkhoff factorization introduced by .
Statement
More precisely, the statement of the theorem is as the following.
Every holomorphic vector bundle

 
  on 
 
 
 
  is holomorphically isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles:



The notation implies each summand is a Serre twist some number of times of the trivial bundle. The representation is unique up to permuting factors.
Generalization
The same result holds in algebraic geometry for algebraic vector bundle over 
 
 
 
  for any field
