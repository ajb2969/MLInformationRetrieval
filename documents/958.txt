   Moduli stack of formal group laws      Moduli stack of formal group laws   In algebraic geometry, the moduli stack of formal group laws is a stack classifying formal group laws and isomorphisms between them. It is denoted by    ℳ  FG     subscript  ℳ  FG    \mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}   . It is a "geometric “object" that underlies the chromatic approach to the stable homotopy theory , a branch of algebraic topology.  Currently, it is not known whether    ℳ  FG     subscript  ℳ  FG    \mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}   is a derived stack or not. Hence, it is typical to work with stratifications. Let    ℳ  FG  n     subscript   superscript  ℳ  n   FG    \mathcal{M}^{n}_{\text{FG}}   be given so that     ℳ  FG  n    (  R  )        subscript   superscript  ℳ  n   FG   R    \mathcal{M}^{n}_{\text{FG}}(R)   consists of formal group laws over R of height exactly n . They form a stratification of the moduli stack    ℳ  FG     subscript  ℳ  FG    \mathcal{M}_{\text{FG}}   .     Spec    𝔽  p   ¯    →   ℳ  FG  n      normal-→   Spec   normal-¯   subscript  𝔽  p      subscript   superscript  ℳ  n   FG     \operatorname{Spec}\overline{\mathbb{F}_{p}}\to\mathcal{M}^{n}_{\text{FG}}   is faithfully flat . In fact,    ℳ  FG  n     subscript   superscript  ℳ  n   FG    \mathcal{M}^{n}_{\text{FG}}   is of the form     Spec    𝔽  p   ¯    /   Aut   (    𝔽  p   ¯   ,  f  )         Spec   normal-¯   subscript  𝔽  p      Aut   normal-¯   subscript  𝔽  p    f     \operatorname{Spec}\overline{\mathbb{F}_{p}}/\operatorname{Aut}(\overline{%
 \mathbb{F}_{p}},f)   where    Aut   (    𝔽  p   ¯   ,  f  )      Aut   normal-¯   subscript  𝔽  p    f    \operatorname{Aut}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_{p}},f)   is a profinite group called the Morava stabilizer group . The Lubin–Tate theory describes how the strata    ℳ  FG  n     subscript   superscript  ℳ  n   FG    \mathcal{M}^{n}_{\text{FG}}   fit together.  References   J.
