Jacobsthal number

In mathematics, the Jacobsthal numbers are an integer sequence named after the German mathematician Ernst Jacobsthal. Like the related Fibonacci numbers, they are a specific type of Lucas sequence

 
  for which P = 1, and Q = −21—and are defined by a similar recurrence relation: in simple terms, the sequence starts with 0 and 1, then each following number is found by adding the number before it to twice the number before that. The first Jacobsthal numbers are:

0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, 2731, 5461, 10923, 21845, 43691, 87381, 174763, 349525, … 
 

Jacobsthal numbers
Jacobsthal numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:



The next Jacobsthal number is also given by the recursion formula:



or by:



The first recursion formula above is also satisfied by the powers of 2.
The Jacobsthal number at a specific point in the sequence may be calculated directly using the closed-form equation:2


 
  The generating function for the Jacobsthal numbers is



Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers
Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers represent the complementary Lucas sequence 
 
 
 
 . They satisfy the same recurrence relation as Jacobsthal numbers but have different initial values:



The following Jacobsthal-Lucas number also satisfies:3



The Jacobsthal-Lucas number at a specific point in the sequence may be calculated directly using the closed-form equation:4



The first Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers are:

2, 1, 5, 7, 17, 31, 65, 127, 257, 511, 1025, 2047, 4097, 8191, 16385, 32767, 65537, 131071, 262145, 524287, 1048577, … .
