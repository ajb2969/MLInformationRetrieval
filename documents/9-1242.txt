   Nitrate reductase (NADPH)      Nitrate reductase (NADPH)   Nitrate reductase (NADPH) (, assimilatory nitrate reductase , assimilatory reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-nitrate reductase , NADPH-nitrate reductase , assimilatory NADPH-nitrate reductase , triphosphopyridine nucleotide-nitrate reductase , NADPH:nitrate reductase , nitrate reductase (NADPH 2 ) , NADPH 2 :nitrate oxidoreductase ) is an enzyme with system name nitrite:NADP + oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction   nitrite + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    nitrate + NADPH + H +    Nitrate reductase is an iron-sulfur molybdenum flavoprotein.
