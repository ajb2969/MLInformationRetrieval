Nitrate reductase (NADPH)

Nitrate reductase (NADPH) (, assimilatory nitrate reductase, assimilatory reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-nitrate reductase, NADPH-nitrate reductase, assimilatory NADPH-nitrate reductase, triphosphopyridine nucleotide-nitrate reductase, NADPH:nitrate reductase, nitrate reductase (NADPH2), NADPH2:nitrate oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name nitrite:NADP+ oxidoreductase.12345 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction

nitrite + NADP+ + H2O 
 
 
nitrate + NADPH + H+


Nitrate reductase is an iron-sulfur molybdenum flavoprotein.
