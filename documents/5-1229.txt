   Turing jump      Turing jump   In computability theory , the Turing jump or Turing jump operator , named for Alan Turing , is an operation that assigns to each decision problem    X   X   X   a successively harder decision problem    X  ‚Ä≤      X  normal-‚Ä≤    X‚Ä≤   with the property that    X  ‚Ä≤      X  normal-‚Ä≤    X‚Ä≤   is not decidable by an oracle machine with an oracle for   X   X   X   .  The operator is called a jump operator because it increases the Turing degree of the problem   X   X   X   . That is, the problem    X  ‚Ä≤      X  normal-‚Ä≤    X‚Ä≤   is not Turing reducible to   X   X   X   . Post's theorem establishes a relationship between the Turing jump operator and the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers. Informally, given a problem, the Turing jump returns the set of Turing machines which halt when given access to an oracle that solves that problem.  Definition  Given a set   X   X   X   and a G√∂del numbering  of the    X   X   X   -computable functions, the Turing jump     X  ‚Ä≤      X  normal-‚Ä≤    X‚Ä≤   of   X   X   X   is defined as        X  ‚Ä≤   =   {  x  ‚à£    œÜ  x  X    (  x  )   is defined   }    .       superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    conditional-set  x     superscript   subscript  œÜ  x   X   x  is defined      X^{\prime}=\{x\mid\varphi_{x}^{X}(x)\ \mbox{is defined}\}.     The    n   n   n   th Turing jump  is defined inductively by        X   (  0  )    =  X   ,       superscript  X  0   X    X^{(0)}=X,\,           X   (   n  +  1   )    =    (   X   (  n  )    )   ‚Ä≤    .       superscript  X    n  1     superscript   superscript  X  n   normal-‚Ä≤     X^{(n+1)}=(X^{(n)})^{\prime}.\,     The    œâ   œâ   œâ   jump  of   X   X   X   is the effective join of the sequence of sets for    n  ‚àà  ùêç      n  normal-‚àà  ùêç    n‚àà\mathbf{N}   :        X   (  œâ  )    =   {   p  i  k   ‚à£   k  ‚àà   X   (  i  )     }    ,       superscript  X  œâ    conditional-set   superscript   subscript  p  i   k     k   superscript  X  i       X^{(\omega)}=\{p_{i}^{k}\mid k\in X^{(i)}\},\,     where denotes the   i   i   i   th prime.  The notation    0  ‚Ä≤      0  normal-‚Ä≤    0‚Ä≤   or    ‚àÖ  ‚Ä≤      normal-‚àÖ  normal-‚Ä≤    ‚àÖ‚Ä≤   is often used for the Turing jump of the empty set. It is read zero-jump or sometimes zero-prime .  Similarly, is the   n   n   n   th jump of the empty set. For finite   n   n   n   , these sets are closely related to the arithmetic hierarchy .  The jump can be iterated into transfinite ordinals: the sets for , where is the Church-Kleene ordinal , are closely related to the hyperarithmetic hierarchy . Beyond , the process can be continued through the countable ordinals of the constructible universe , using set-theoretic methods (Hodes 1980). The concept has also been generalized to extend to uncountable regular cardinals (Lubarsky 1987).  Examples   The Turing jump    0  ‚Ä≤      0  normal-‚Ä≤    0‚Ä≤   of the empty set is Turing equivalent to the halting problem .  For each   n   n   n   , the set is m-complete at level    Œ£  n  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Œ£  0   n    \Sigma^{0}_{n}   in the arithmetical hierarchy .  The set of G√∂del numbers of true formulas in the language of Peano arithmetic with a predicate for   X   X   X   is computable from .   Properties       X  ‚Ä≤      X  normal-‚Ä≤    X‚Ä≤   is   X   X   X   - computably enumerable but not   X   X   X   - computable .  If   A   A   A   is Turing equivalent to   B   B   B   then    A  ‚Ä≤      A  normal-‚Ä≤    A‚Ä≤   is Turing equivalent to    B  ‚Ä≤      B  normal-‚Ä≤    B‚Ä≤   . The converse of this implication is not true.  ( Shore and Slaman , 1999) The function mapping   X   X   X   to    X  ‚Ä≤      X  normal-‚Ä≤    X‚Ä≤   is definable in the partial order of the Turing degrees.
