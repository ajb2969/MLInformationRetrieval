   Demethylspheroidene O-methyltransferase      Demethylspheroidene O-methyltransferase   Demethylspheroidene O-methyltransferase (, 1-hydroxycarotenoid O-methylase , 1-hydroxycarotenoid methylase , 1-HO-carotenoid methylase , CrtF ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:demethylspheroidene O-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + demethylspheroidene    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + spheroidene    In Rhodopseudomonas capsulata and Rubrivivax gelatinosus the enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of spheroidene.
