Ecdysone oxidase

In enzymology, an ecdysone oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ecdysone + O2

 
  3-dehydroecdysone + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ecdysone and O2, whereas its two products are 3-dehydroecdysone and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ecdysone:oxygen 3-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called beta-ecdysone oxidase.
