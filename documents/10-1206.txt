   Ecdysone oxidase      Ecdysone oxidase   In enzymology , an ecdysone oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ecdysone + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-dehydroecdysone + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ecdysone and O 2 , whereas its two products are 3-dehydroecdysone and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ecdysone:oxygen 3-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called beta-ecdysone oxidase .
