   Cash flow return on investment      Cash flow return on investment   Cash flow return on investment is a valuation model that assumes the stock market sets prices based on cash flow , not on corporate performance and earnings.      CFROI  =   Cash Flow  Market Recapitalization       CFROI    Cash Flow  Market Recapitalization     \text{CFROI}=\frac{\text{Cash Flow}}{\text{Market Recapitalization}}     For the corporation, it is essentially internal rate of return (IRR). CFROI is compared to a hurdle rate to determine if investment/product is performing adequately. The hurdle rate is the total cost of capital for the corporation calculated by a mix of cost of debt financing plus investors `expected return on equity investments. The CFROI must exceed the hurdle rate to satisfy both the debt financing and the investors expected return .      CFROI  =   Gross Cash Flow  Gross Investment       CFROI    Gross Cash Flow  Gross Investment     \text{CFROI}=\frac{\text{Gross Cash Flow}}{\text{Gross Investment}}     Michael J. Maubossin, in his 2006 book 'MORE THAN YOU KNOW', quoted an analysis by CSFB, that, measured by CFROI, performance of companies tend to converge after five years in terms of their survival rates.  The CFROI for a firm or a division can then be written as follows:      CFROI  =    Gross Cash Flow  -  Economic Depreciation   Gross Investment       CFROI      Gross Cash Flow  Economic Depreciation   Gross Investment     \text{CFROI}=\frac{\text{Gross Cash Flow}-\text{Economic Depreciation}}{\text{%
 Gross Investment}}     This annuity is called the economic depreciation :      Economic Depreciation  =    K  c      (   1  +   K  c    )   n   -  1        Economic Depreciation     subscript  K  c      superscript    1   subscript  K  c    n   1      \text{Economic Depreciation}=\frac{K_{c}}{\left(1+K_{c}\right)^{n}-1}     where n is the expected life of the asset and K c is the Replacement Cost in current dollars.
