   Ferric-chelate reductase      Ferric-chelate reductase   In enzymology , a ferric-chelate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 Fe(II) + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 Fe(III) + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are Fe(II) and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are Fe(III) , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those oxidizing metal ion with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is Fe(II):NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include ferric chelate reductase , iron chelate reductase , NADH:Fe3+-EDTA reductase , and NADH2:Fe3+ oxidoreductase .
