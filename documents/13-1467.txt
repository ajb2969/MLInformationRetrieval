   Simplicial map      Simplicial map   In the mathematical discipline of simplicial homology theory, a simplicial map is a map between simplicial complexes with the property that the images of the vertices of a simplex always span a simplex. Note that this implies that vertices have vertices for images.  Simplicial maps are thus determined by their effects on vertices. In particular, there are a finite number of simplicial maps between two given finite simplicial complexes.  Simplicial maps induce continuous maps between the underlying polyhedra of the simplicial complexes: one simply extends linearly using barycentric coordinates .  Simplicial maps which are bijective are called simplicial isomorphisms .  Simplicial approximation  Let    f  :    |  K  |   →   |  L  |       normal-:  f   normal-→    K     L      f:|K|\rightarrow|L|   be a continuous map between the underlying polyhedra of simplicial complexes and let us write    st   (  v  )       st  v    \text{st}(v)   for the star of a vertex. A simplicial map     f  △   :   K  →  L      normal-:   subscript  f  normal-△    normal-→  K  L     f_{\triangle}:K\rightarrow L   such that     f   (   st   (  v  )    )    ⊆   st   (    f  △    (  v  )    )          f    st  v      st     subscript  f  normal-△   v      f(\text{st}(v))\subseteq\text{st}(f_{\triangle}(v))   , is called a simplicial approximation to   f   f   f   .  A simplicial approximation is homotopic to the map it approximates.  References   Munkres, James R.: Elements of Algebraic Topology , Westview Press, 1995. ISBN 978-0-201-62728-2.
