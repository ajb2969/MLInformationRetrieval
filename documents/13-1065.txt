   Phonon scattering      Phonon scattering   Phonons can scatter through several mechanisms as they travel through the material. These scattering mechanisms are: Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering , phonon-impurity scattering, phonon-electron scattering, and phonon-boundary scattering. Each scattering mechanism can be characterised by a relaxation rate 1/   τ   τ   \tau   which is the inverse of the corresponding relaxation time.  All scattering processes can be taken into account using Matthiessen's rule . Then the combined relaxation time    τ  C     subscript  τ  C    \tau_{C}   can be written as:       1   τ  C    =    1   τ  U    +   1   τ  M    +   1   τ  B    +   1   τ    p  h   -  e            1   subscript  τ  C        1   subscript  τ  U      1   subscript  τ  M      1   subscript  τ  B      1   subscript  τ      p  h   e        \frac{1}{\tau_{C}}=\frac{1}{\tau_{U}}+\frac{1}{\tau_{M}}+\frac{1}{\tau_{B}}+%
 \frac{1}{\tau_{ph-e}}     The parameters    τ  U     subscript  τ  U    \tau_{U}   ,    τ  M     subscript  τ  M    \tau_{M}   ,    τ  B     subscript  τ  B    \tau_{B}   ,    τ    p  h   -  e      subscript  τ      p  h   e     \tau_{ph-e}   are due to Umklapp scattering, mass-difference impurity scattering, boundary scattering and phonon-electron scattering, respectively.  Phonon-phonon scattering  For phonon-phonon scattering, effects by normal processes (processes which conserve the phonon wave vector - N processes) are ignored in favor of Umklapp processes (U processes). Since normal processes vary linearly with   ω   ω   \omega   and umklapp processes vary with    ω  2     superscript  ω  2    \omega^{2}   , Umklapp scattering dominates at high frequency. 1     τ  U     subscript  τ  U    \tau_{U}   is given by:       1   τ  U    =   2   γ  2      k  B   T    μ   V  0       ω  2    ω  D           1   subscript  τ  U      2   superscript  γ  2        subscript  k  B   T     μ   subscript  V  0        superscript  ω  2    subscript  ω  D       \frac{1}{\tau_{U}}=2\gamma^{2}\frac{k_{B}T}{\mu V_{0}}\frac{\omega^{2}}{\omega%
 _{D}}     where   γ   γ   \gamma   is Gruneisen anharmonicity parameter , μ is shear modulus , V 0 is volume per atom and    ω  D     subscript  ω  D    \omega_{D}   is Debye frequency . 2  Mass-difference impurity scattering  Mass-difference impurity scattering is given by:       1   τ  M    =     V  0   Γ   ω  4     4  π   v  g  3           1   subscript  τ  M         subscript  V  0   normal-Γ   superscript  ω  4      4  π   superscript   subscript  v  g   3       \frac{1}{\tau_{M}}=\frac{V_{0}\Gamma\omega^{4}}{4\pi v_{g}^{3}}     where   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is a measure of the impurity scattering strength. Note that    v  g     subscript  v  g    {v_{g}}   is dependent of the dispersion curves.  Boundary scattering  Boundary scattering is particularly important for low-dimensional nanostructures and its relaxation time is given by:       1   τ  B    =    V  D    (   1  -  p   )          1   subscript  τ  B        V  D     1  p      \frac{1}{\tau_{B}}=\frac{V}{D}(1-p)     where D is the dimension of the system and p represents the surface roughness parameter. The value p=1 means a smooth perfect surface that the scattering is purely specular and the relaxation time goes to ∞; hence, boundary scattering does not affect thermal transport. The value p=0 represents a very rough surface that the scattering is then purely diffusive which gives:       1   τ  B    =   V  D         1   subscript  τ  B      V  D     \frac{1}{\tau_{B}}=\frac{V}{D}     This equation is also known as Casimir limit. 3  Phonon-electron scattering  Phonon-electron scattering can also contribute when the material is lightly doped. The corresponding relaxation time is given as:       1   τ    p  h   -  e     =      n  e    ϵ  2   ω    ρ   V  2    k  B   T       π   m  *    V  2     2   k  B   T      exp   (   -     m  *    V  2     2   k  B   T     )           1   subscript  τ      p  h   e            subscript  n  e    superscript  ϵ  2   ω     ρ   superscript  V  2    subscript  k  B   T          π   superscript  m     superscript  V  2      2   subscript  k  B   T              superscript  m     superscript  V  2      2   subscript  k  B   T         \frac{1}{\tau_{ph-e}}=\frac{n_{e}\epsilon^{2}\omega}{\rho V^{2}k_{B}T}\sqrt{%
 \frac{\pi m^{*}V^{2}}{2k_{B}T}}\exp\left(-\frac{m^{*}V^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\right)     The parameter    n  e     subscript  n  e    n_{e}   is conduction electrons concentration, ε is deformation potential, ρ is mass density and m* is effective electron mass. 4 It is usually assumed that contribution to thermal conductivity by phonon-electron scattering is negligible.
