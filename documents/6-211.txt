   Product term      Product term   In Boolean logic , a product term is a conjunction of literals, where each literal is either a variable or its negation.  Examples  Examples of product terms include:      A  ∧  B      A  B    A\wedge B         A  ∧   (   ¬  B   )   ∧   (   ¬  C   )       A     B      C     A\wedge(\neg B)\wedge(\neg C)         ¬  A       A    \neg A     Origin  The terminology comes from the similarity of AND to multiplication as in the ring structure of Boolean rings .  Minterms  For a boolean function of   n   n   n   variables     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     {x_{1},\dots,x_{n}}   , a product term in which each of the   n   n   n   variables appears once (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a minterm . Thus, a minterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator and the conjunction operator.  References   Fredrick J. Hill, and Gerald R.
