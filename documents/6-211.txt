Product term

In Boolean logic, a product term is a conjunction of literals, where each literal is either a variable or its negation.
Examples
Examples of product terms include:









Origin
The terminology comes from the similarity of AND to multiplication as in the ring structure of Boolean rings.
Minterms
For a boolean function of 
 
 
 
  variables 
 
 
 
 , a product term in which each of the 
 
 
 
 
  variables appears once (in either its complemented or uncomplemented form) is called a minterm. Thus, a minterm is a logical expression of n variables that employs only the complement operator and the conjunction operator.
