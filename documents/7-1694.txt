Whitehead's lemma





Whitehead's lemma is a technical result in abstract algebra used in algebraic K-theory. It states that a matrix of the form



is equivalent to the identity matrix by elementary transformations (that is, transvections):



Here, 
 
 
 
  indicates a matrix whose diagonal block is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  entry is 
 
 
 
 .
The name "Whitehead's lemma" also refers to the closely related result that the derived group of the stable general linear group is the group generated by elementary matrices.12 In symbols,


 
 .
This holds for the stable group (the direct limit of matrices of finite size) over any ring, but not in general for the unstable groups, even over a field. For instance for



one has:


 
  where Alt(3) and Sym(3) denote the alternating resp. symmetric group on 3 letters.
