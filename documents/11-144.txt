   Global meteoric water line      Global meteoric water line   The Global Meteoric Water Line is an equation defined by the geochemist Harmon Craig  1  2 that states the average relationship between hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in natural terrestrial waters, expressed as a worldwide average.      δ  D  =  8.0  ⋅   δ  18   O  +  10    /  00      0        fragments  δ  D   8.0  normal-⋅   superscript  δ  18   O   10   superscript   subscript   00   0     \delta\mathrm{D}=8.0\cdot\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}+10{}^{0\!}\!/\!_{00}     A meteoric water line can also be calculated for a given area, and used as a baseline within that area. Kinetic fractionation will cause the isotope ratios to vary between localities within that area. 3 This relationship is used within the field of isotope hydrology . Craig's original assertion is that the isotopic enrichments, relative to ocean water, display a linear correlation over the entire range for waters which have not undergone excessive evaporation '. 4  References  "  Category:Precipitation  Category:Isotopes  Category:Hydrology     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
