Wagstaff prime

In number theory, a Wagstaff prime is a prime number p of the form



where q is an odd prime. Wagstaff primes are named after the mathematician Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr.; the prime pages credit François Morain for naming them in a lecture at the Eurocrypt 1990 conference. Wagstaff primes are related to the New Mersenne conjecture and have applications in cryptology.
Examples
The first three Wagstaff primes are 3, 11, and 43 because



Known Wagstaff primes
The first few Wagstaff primes are:

3, 11, 43, 683, 2731, 43691, 174763, 2796203, 715827883, 2932031007403, 768614336404564651, … 
 

, known exponents which produce Wagstaff primes or probable primes are:

3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 31, 43, 61, 79, 101, 127, 167, 191, 199, 313, 347, 701, 1709, 2617, 3539, 5807, 10501, 10691, 11279, 12391, 14479, 42737, 83339, 95369, 117239, 127031, 138937, 141079, 267017, 269987, 374321, 986191, 4031399, …, 13347311, 13372531 
 

In February 2010, Tony Reix discovered the Wagstaff probable prime:


 
  which has 1,213,572 digits and was the 3rd biggest probable prime ever found at this date.1
In September 2013, Ryan Propper announced the discovery of two additional Wagstaff probable primes:2


 
  and


 
  Each is a probable prime with slightly more than 4 million decimal digits. It is not currently known whether there are any exponents between 4031399 and 13347311 that produce Wagstaff probable primes.
Primality testing
These numbers are proven to be prime for the values of q up to 83339. Those with q > 83339 are probable primes . The primality proof for q = 42737 was performed by François Morain in 2007 with a distributed ECPP implementation running on several networks of workstations for 743 GHz-days on an Opteron processor.3 It was the third largest primality proof by ECPP from its discovery until March 2009.4
Currently, the fastest known algorithm for proving the primality of Wagstaff numbers is ECPP.
The LLR (Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel) tool by Jean Penné is used to find Wagstaff probable primes by means of the Vrba-Reix test. It is a PRP test based on the properties of a cycle of the digraph under x^2-2 modulo a Wagstaff number.
Generalizations
It is natural to consider5 more generally numbers of the form


 
  where the base 
 
 
 
 . Since for 
 
 
 
  odd we have


 
  these generalized Wagstaff numbers are sometimes considered6 a case of the repunit numbers with negative base 
 
 
 
 .
For some specific values of 
 
 
 
 , all 
 
 
 
  (with a possible exception for very small 
 
 
 
 ) are composite because of an "algebraic" factorization. Specifically, if 
 
 
 
  has the form of a perfect power with odd exponent (like 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, 128, 216, 243, etc. ), then the fact that 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  odd, is divisible by 
 
 
 
  shows that 
 
 
 
  is divisible by 
 
 
 
  in these special cases. Another case is 
 
 
 
 , with k positive integer (like 4, 64, 324, 1024, 2500, 5184, etc. ), where we have the aurifeuillean factorization.
However, when 
 
 
 
  does not admit an algebraic factorization, it is conjectured that an infinite number of 
 
 
 
  values make 
 
 
 
  prime, notice all ns are odd primes.

There are only probable prime for that b = 53, 124, 150, and 205.
No known primes or PRPs for that b = 97, 103, 113, 175, 186, 187, 188, 220, and 284.
Because of the algebra factorization, there are no primes for that b = 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, and 243. (The case of b = 1 are all 1, but 1 is not prime)
It is expected that all odd primes are in the list.
For 
 
 
 
 , the primes themselves have the following appearance: 9091, 909091, 909090909090909091, 909090909090909090909090909091, … , and these ns are: 5, 7, 19, 31, 53, 67, 293, 641, 2137, 3011, 268207, ... .
The least base b such that 
 
 
 
  is prime are

2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 16, 61, 2, 6, 10, 6, 2, 5, 46, 18, 2, 49, 16, 70, 2, 5, 6, 12, 92, 2, 48, 89, 30, 16, 147, 19, 19, 2, 16, 11, 289, 2, 12, 52, 2, 66, 9, 22, 5, 489, 69, 137, 16, 36, 96, 76, 117, 26, 3, ... (This sequence starts with n = 2)
