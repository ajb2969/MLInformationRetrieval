(S,S)-butanediol dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a (S,S)-butanediol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S,S)-butane-2,3-diol + NAD+

 
  acetoin + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S,S)-butane-2,3-diol and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are acetoin, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S,S)-butane-2,3-diol:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include L-butanediol dehydrogenase, L-BDH, and L(+)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (L-acetoin forming). This enzyme participates in butanoic acid metabolism.
