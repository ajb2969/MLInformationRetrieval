Phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase

Phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase (, ring 1,2-phenylacetyl-CoA epoxidase, phenylacetyl-CoA monooxygenase, PaaAC, PaaABC(D)E) is an enzyme with system name phenylacetyl-CoA:oxygen oxidoreductase (1,2-epoxidizing).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

phenylacetyl-CoA + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
 
  2-(1,2-epoxy-1,2-dihydrophenyl)acetyl-CoA + NADP+ + H2O
 

Phenylacetyl-CoA 1,2-epoxidase participates in catabolism of phenylacetate in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.
