Completely positive map

In mathematics a positive map is a map between C*-algebras that sends positive elements to positive elements. A completely positive map is one which satisfies a stronger, more robust condition.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be C*-algebras. A linear map 
 
 
 
  is called positive map if 
 
 
 
 
  maps positive elements to positive elements
 
 
 
 .
Any linear map 
 
 
 
  induces another map



in a natural way. If 
 
 
 
  is identified with the C*-algebra 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 -matrices with entries in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  acts as



We say that 
 
 
 
  is k-positive if 
 
 
 
  is a positive map, and 
 
 
 
  is called completely positive if 
 
 
 
  is k-positive for all k.
Properties

Positive maps are monotone, i.e. 
 
 
 
  for all self-adjoint elements 
 
 
 
 .
Since 
 
 
 
  every positive map is automatically continuous w.r.t. to the C*-norms and its operator norm equals 
 
 
 
 . A similary statement with approximate units holds for non-unital algebras.
The set of positive functionals 
 
 
 
  is the dual cone of the cone of positive elements of 
 
 
 
 .

Examples

Every *-homomorphism is completely positive.
For every operator 
 
 
 
  between Hilbert spaces, the map 
 
 
 
  is completely positive. Stinespring's theorem says that all completely positive maps are compositions of *-homomorphisms and these special maps.
Every positive functional 
 
 
 
  (in particular every state) is automatically completely positive.
Every positive map 
 
 
 
  is completely positive.
The transposition of matrices is a standard example of a positive map that fails to be 2-positive. Let T denote this map on 
 
 
 
 . The following is a positive matrix in 
 
 
 
 :







\begin{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix}& \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\0&0\end{pmatrix}\\ \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\1&0\end{pmatrix}& \begin{pmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}. 
The image of this matrix under 
 
 
 
  is




which is clearly not positive, having determinant -1. Moreover, the eigenvalues of this matrix are 1,1,1 and -1.
 


Incidentally, a map Φ is said to be co-positive if the composition Φ 
 
 
T is positive. The transposition map itself is a co-positive map.
