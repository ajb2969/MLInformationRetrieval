   Pfaffian constraint      Pfaffian constraint   In robot  motion planning , a Pfaffian constraint is a set of k  linearly independent  constraints linear in velocity, i.e., of the form       A   (  q  )    q  ˙    =  0        A  q   normal-˙  q    0    A(q)\dot{q}=0     One source of Pfaffian constraints is rolling without slipping in wheeled robots . 1  References  "  Category:Robot kinematics  Category:Control theory     ↩
