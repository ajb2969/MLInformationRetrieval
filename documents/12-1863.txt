   Mapping torus      Mapping torus   In mathematics , the mapping torus in topology of a homeomorphism  f of some topological space  X to itself is a particular geometric construction with f . Take the cartesian product of X with a closed interval  I , and glue the boundary components together by the static homeomorphism:       M  f   =    (   I  ×  X   )     (  1  ,  x  )   ∼   (  0  ,   f   (  x  )    )          subscript  M  f       I  X    similar-to   1  x    0    f  x        M_{f}=\frac{(I\times X)}{(1,x)\sim(0,f(x))}     The result is a fiber bundle whose base is a circle and whose fiber is the original space X .  If X is a manifold , M f will be a manifold of dimension one higher, and it is said to "fiber over the circle" .  Mapping tori of surface homeomorphisms play a key role in the theory of 3-manifolds and have been intensely studied. If S is a closed surface of genus  g ≥ 2 and if f is a self-homeomorphism of S , the mapping torus M f is a closed  3-manifold that fibers over the circle with fiber S . A deep result of Thurston states that in this case the 3-manifold  M f is hyperbolic if and only if f is a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of S . 1  References  "  Category:General topology  Category:Geometric topology  Category:Homeomorphisms     W.
