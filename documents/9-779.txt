   Point-finite collection      Point-finite collection   In mathematics , a collection   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   of subsets of a topological space    X   X   X   is said to be point finite or a point finite collection if every point of   X   X   X   lies in only finitely many members of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   . 1  A topological space in which every open cover admits a point-finite open refinement is called metacompact . Every locally finite collection of subsets of a topological space is also point finite. A topological space in which every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement is called paracompact . Every paracompact space is metacompact. 2  References  "  Category:General topology     . ↩
