Point-finite collection

In mathematics, a collection 
 
 
 
  of subsets of a topological space

 
  is said to be point finite or a point finite collection if every point of 
 
 
 
  lies in only finitely many members of 
 
 
 
 .1
A topological space in which every open cover admits a point-finite open refinement is called metacompact. Every locally finite collection of subsets of a topological space is also point finite. A topological space in which every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement is called paracompact. Every paracompact space is metacompact.2
