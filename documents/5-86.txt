   Chemical shift      Chemical shift   In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the chemical shift is the resonant frequency of a nucleus relative to a standard in a magnetic field. Often the position and number of chemical shifts are diagnostic of the structure of a molecule . 1 2 3 Chemical shifts are also used to describe signals in other forms of spectroscopy such as photoemission spectroscopy .  Some atomic nuclei possess a magnetic moment ( nuclear spin ), which gives rise to different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field . The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of the same type of nucleus (e.g. 1 H, 13 C, 15 N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, ...), and with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also chemical shift referencing ), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.  Operating frequency  The operating (or Larmor) frequency     ω  0     subscript  ω  0    \omega_{0}    of a magnet is calculated from the Larmor equation 4       ω  0   =   γ    B  0          subscript  ω  0     γ   subscript  B  0      \omega_{0}=\gamma B_{0}\,     where    B  0     subscript  B  0    B_{0}   is the actual strength of the magnet in units like teslas or gauss , and    γ   γ   \gamma    is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus being tested which is in turn calculated from its magnetic moment     μ   μ   \mu    and spin number    I   I   I   with the nuclear magneton     μ  N     subscript  μ  N    \mu_{N}   and the Planck constant h:      γ  =      μ    μ  N     h  I         γ      μ   subscript  μ  N      h  I      \gamma=\frac{\mu\,\mu_{N}}{hI}\,     Thus, the proton operating frequency for a 1 T magnet is calculated as:       ω  0   =   γ   B  0    =        2.79  ×  5.05  ×    10   -  27      J   /  T      6.62  ×    10   -  34      Js   ×   (   1  /  2   )     ×   1    T   =    42.5    MHz           subscript  ω  0     γ   subscript  B  0                     2.79  5.05   superscript  10    27     normal-J   normal-T         6.62   superscript  10    34     Js     1  2     1   normal-T          42.5  MHz      \omega_{0}=\gamma B_{0}=\frac{{2.79\times 5.05\times 10^{-27}\,{\rm{J/T}}}}{{6%
 .62\times 10^{-34}\,{\rm{Js}}\times\left({1/2}\right)}}\times 1\,{\rm{T}}=42.5%
 \,{\rm{MHz}}\,     Chemical shift referencing  Chemical shift δ is usually expressed in parts per million (ppm) by frequency , because it is calculated from      δ  =    (    ν   s  a  m  p  l  e    -   ν   r  e  f  e  r  e  n  c  e     )    ν   r  e  f  e  r  e  n  c  e         δ       subscript  ν    s  a  m  p  l  e     subscript  ν    r  e  f  e  r  e  n  c  e      subscript  ν    r  e  f  e  r  e  n  c  e       \delta={(\nu_{sample}-\nu_{reference})\over\nu_{reference}}    5  where    ν   s  a  m  p  l  e      subscript  ν    s  a  m  p  l  e     \nu_{sample}   is the absolute resonance frequency of the sample and    ν   r  e  f  e  r  e  n  c  e      subscript  ν    r  e  f  e  r  e  n  c  e     \nu_{reference}   is the absolute resonance frequency of a standard reference compound, measured in the same applied magnetic field . Since the numerator is usually expressed in hertz , and the denominator in megahertz , delta is expressed in ppm.  The detected frequencies (in Hz) for 1 H, 13 C, and 29 Si nuclei are usually referenced against TMS ( tetramethylsilane ) or DSS , which by the definition above have a chemical shift of zero if chosen as the reference. Other standard materials are used for setting the chemical shift for other nuclei.  Thus, an NMR signal observed at a frequency 300 Hz higher than the signal from TMS, where the TMS resonance frequency is 300 MHz, has a chemical shift of:         300   Hz     300  ×    10  6     Hz    =   1  ×   10   -  6     =    1    ppm              300  Hz       300   superscript  10  6    Hz      1   superscript  10    6            1  ppm      \frac{300\,\rm Hz}{300\times 10^{6}\,\rm Hz}=1\times 10^{-6}=1\,\rm ppm\,     Although the absolute resonance frequency depends on the applied magnetic field, the chemical shift is independent of external magnetic field strength. On the other hand the resolution of NMR will increase with applied magnetic field.  The induced magnetic field  The electrons around a nucleus will circulate in a magnetic field and create a secondary induced magnetic field . This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by Lenz's law and atoms with higher induced fields (i.e., higher electron density) are therefore called shielded , relative to those with lower electron density. The chemical milieu of an atom can influence its electron density through the polar effect . Electron-donating alkyl groups, for example, lead to increased shielding while electron-withdrawing substituents such as nitro groups lead to deshielding of the nucleus. Not only substituents cause local induced fields. Bonding electrons can also lead to shielding and deshielding effects. A striking example of this are the pi bonds in benzene . Circular current through the hyperconjugated system causes a shielding effect at the molecule's center and a deshielding effect at its edges. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.  Nuclei are found to resonate in a wide range to the left (or more rare to the right) of the internal standard. When a signal is found with a higher chemical shift:   the applied effective magnetic field is lower, if the resonance frequency is fixed, (as in old traditional CW spectrometers)  the frequency is higher, when the applied magnetic field is static, (normal case in FT spectrometers)  the nucleus is more deshielded  the signal or shift is downfield or at low field or paramagnetic   Conversely a lower chemical shift is called a diamagnetic shift , and is upfield and more shielded.  Diamagnetic shielding  In real molecules protons are surrounded by a cloud of charge due to adjacent bonds and atoms. In an applied magnetic field ( B 0 ) electrons circulate and produce an induced field ( B i ) which opposes the applied field. The effective field at the nucleus will be B = B 0 − B i . The nucleus is said to be experiencing a diamagnetic shielding.  Factors causing chemical shifts  Important factors influencing chemical shift are electron density, electronegativity of neighboring groups and anisotropic induced magnetic field effects.  Electron density shields a nucleus from the external field. For example in proton NMR the electron-poor tropylium ion has its protons downfield at 9.17 ppm, those of the electron-rich cyclooctatetraenyl anion move upfield to 6.75 ppm and its dianion even more upfield to 5.56 ppm.  A nucleus in the vicinity of an electronegative atom experiences reduced electron density and the nucleus is therefore deshielded. In proton NMR of methyl halides (CH 3 X) the chemical shift of the methyl protons increase in the order I 1H and 13 C aren't the only nuclei susceptible to NMR experiments. A number of different nuclei can also be detected, although the use of such techniques is generally rare due to small relative sensitivities in NMR experiments (compared to 1 H) of the nuclei in question, the other factor for rare use being their slender representation in nature/organic compounds.

The NMR chemical shift in its present day meaning first appeared in journals in 1950. Chemical shifts with a different meaning appear in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as the shift in atomic core-level energy due to a specific chemical environment. The term is also used in Mössbauer spectroscopy , where similarly to NMR it refers to a shift in peak position due to the local chemical bonding environment. As is the case for NMR the chemical shift reflects the electron density at the atomic nucleus. 8  See also   MRI  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of carbohydrates  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of nucleic acids  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins  Protein NMR  Relaxation (NMR)  Solid-state NMR  Zeeman effect  Random Coil Index   References  External links   www.chem.wisc.edu  BioMagResBank  wwwchem.csustan.edu  Proton chemical shifts  Carbon chemical shifts    Online tutorials (these generally involve combined use of IR , 1 H NMR , 13 C NMR and mass spectrometry )  Problem set 1, advanced (see also this link for more background information on spin-spin coupling)  Problem set 2, moderate      Problem set 4, moderate, German language (don't let that scare you away!)
