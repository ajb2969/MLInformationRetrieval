   Symbolic power of a prime ideal      Symbolic power of a prime ideal   In algebra, given a ring R and a prime ideal  P in it, the n -th symbolic power of P is the ideal        P   (  n  )    =     P  n    R  P    ∩  R   =   {   f  ∈  R   ∣    s  f   ∈    P  n   for some  s   ∈   R  -  P    }    .         superscript  P  n        superscript  P  n    subscript  R  P    R         conditional-set    f  R         s  f      superscript  P  n   for some  s          R  P         P^{(n)}=P^{n}R_{P}\cap R=\{f\in R\mid sf\in P^{n}\text{ for some }s\in R-P\}.    1  It is the smallest P - primary ideal containing the n -th power P n . Very roughly, it consists of functions with zeros of order n along the variety defined by P . If R is Noetherian , then it is the P -primary component in the primary decomposition of P n . We have     P   (  1  )    =  P       superscript  P  1   P    P^{(1)}=P   and if P is a maximal ideal , then     P   (  n  )    =   P  n        superscript  P  n    superscript  P  n     P^{(n)}=P^{n}   .
