   Bifundamental representation      Bifundamental representation   In mathematics and theoretical physics , a bifundamental representation is a representation obtained as a tensor product of two fundamental or antifundamental representations.  For example, the MN -dimensional representation ( M , N ) of the group        S  U   (  M  )    Ã—  S   U   (  N  )           S  U  M   S   U  N    SU(M)\times SU(N)     is a bifundamental representation.  These representations occur in quiver diagrams .  "  Category:Abstract algebra
