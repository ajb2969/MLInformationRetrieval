Bifundamental representation

In mathematics and theoretical physics, a bifundamental representation is a representation obtained as a tensor product of two  fundamental or  antifundamental representations.
For example, the MN-dimensional representation (M,N) of the group



is a bifundamental representation.
These representations occur in quiver diagrams.
