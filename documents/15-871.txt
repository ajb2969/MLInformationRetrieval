3-Succinoylsemialdehyde-pyridine dehydrogenase

3-Succinoylsemialdehyde-pyridine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme with system name 4-oxo-4-(pyridin-3-yl)butanal:NADP+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4-oxo-4-(pyridin-3-yl)butanal + NADP+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-oxo-4-(pyridin-3-yl)butanoate + NADPH + H+


The enzyme has been characterized from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas sp. HZN6.
