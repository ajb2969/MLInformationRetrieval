   Phosphoketolase      Phosphoketolase   In enzymology , a phosphoketolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-xylulose 5-phosphate + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl phosphate + D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-xylulose 5-phosphate and phosphate , whereas its 3 products are acetyl phosphate , D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-xylulose-5-phosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase (adding phosphate; acetyl-phosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include D-xylulose-5-phosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase , and (phosphate-acetylating) . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : pentose phosphate pathway , methane metabolism , and carbon fixation . It employs one cofactor , thiamin diphosphate .
