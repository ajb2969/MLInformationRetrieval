Graph C*-algebra

In mathematics, particularly the theory of C*-algebras, a graph C*-algebra is a universal C*-algebra associated to a directed graph. They form a rich class of C*-algebras encompassing Cuntz algebras, Cuntz-Krieger algebras, the Toeplitz algebra, etc. Also every AF-algebra is Morita equivalent1 to a graph C*-algebra. As the structure of graph C*-algebras is fairly tractable with computable invariants, they play an important part in the classification theory of C*-algebras.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a directed graph with a countable set of vertices 
 
 
 
 , a countable set of edges 
 
 
 
 , and maps 
 
 
 
  identifying the range and source of each edge, respectively. The graph C*-algebra corresponding to 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the universal C*-algebra generated by mutually orthogonal projections 
 
 
 
  and partial isometries 
 
 
 
  with mutually orthogonal ranges such that :
(i) 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 

(ii) 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 

(iii) 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
