Bar product

In information theory, the bar product of two linear codes C2 ⊆ C1 is defined as



where (a | b) denotes the concatenation of a and b. If the code words in C1 are of length n, then the code words in C1 | C2 are of length 2n.
The bar product is an especially convenient way of expressing the Reed–Muller RM (d, r) code in terms of the Reed–Muller codes RM (d − 1, r) and RM (d − 1, r − 1).
The bar product is also referred to as the | u | u+v | construction1 or (u | u + v) construction.2
Properties
Rank
The rank of the bar product is the sum of the two ranks:



Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be a basis for 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a basis for 
 
 
 
 . Then the set



is a basis for the bar product 
 
 
 
 .
Hamming weight
The Hamming weight w of the bar product is the lesser of (a) twice the weight of C1, and (b) the weight of C2:



Proof
For all 
 
 
 
 ,



which has weight 
 
 
 
 . Equally



for all 
 
 
 
  and has weight 
 
 
 
 . So minimising over 
 
 
 
  we have



Now let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , not both zero. If 
 
 
 
  then:



If 
 
 
 
  then



so
