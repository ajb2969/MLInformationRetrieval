   Janko group J2      Janko group J2     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Janko group  J 2 or the Hall-Janko group  HJ is a sporadic simple group of order   2 7 {{·}}3 3 {{·}}5 2 {{·}}7 = 604800  ≈ 6     ×   10  5       absent   superscript  10  5     \times 10^{5}   .   History and properties  J 2 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups and is also called Hall–Janko–Wales group . In 1969 Zvonimir Janko predicted J 2 as one of two new simple groups having 2 1+4 :A 5 as a centralizer of an involution (the other is the Janko group J3 ). It was constructed by  as a rank 3 permutation group on 100 points.  Both the Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group have order 2.  J 2 is the only one of the 4 Janko groups that is a subquotient of the monster group ; it is thus part of what Robert Griess calls the Happy Family. Since it is also found in the Conway group Co1 , it is therefore part of the second generation of the Happy Family.  Representations  It is a subgroup of index two of the group of automorphisms of the Hall–Janko graph , leading to a permutation representation of degree 100. It is also a subgroup of index two of the group of automorphisms of the Hall–Janko Near Octagon , 1 leading to a permutation representation of degree 315.  It has a modular representation of dimension six over the field of four elements; if in characteristic two we have w 2 + w + 1 = 0, then J 2 is generated by the two matrices      𝐀  =   (      w  2      w  2     0    0    0    0      1     w  2     0    0    0    0      1    1     w  2      w  2     0    0      w    1    1     w  2     0    0      0     w  2      w  2      w  2     0    w       w  2     1     w  2     0     w  2     0     )       𝐀     superscript  w  2    superscript  w  2   0  0  0  0    1   superscript  w  2   0  0  0  0    1  1   superscript  w  2    superscript  w  2   0  0    w  1  1   superscript  w  2   0  0    0   superscript  w  2    superscript  w  2    superscript  w  2   0  w     superscript  w  2   1   superscript  w  2   0   superscript  w  2   0      {\mathbf{A}}=\left(\begin{matrix}w^{2}&w^{2}&0&0&0&0\\

These matrices satisfy the equations       𝐀  2   =   𝐁  3   =    (  𝐀𝐁  )   7   =    (  𝐀𝐁𝐀𝐁𝐁  )   12   =  1.         superscript  𝐀  2    superscript  𝐁  3         superscript  𝐀𝐁  7         superscript  𝐀𝐁𝐀𝐁𝐁  12        1.     {\mathbf{A}}^{2}={\mathbf{B}}^{3}=({\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{B}})^{7}=({\mathbf{A}}%
 {\mathbf{B}}{\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{B}}{\mathbf{B}})^{12}=1.     J 2 is thus a Hurwitz group , a finite homomorphic image of the (2,3,7) triangle group .  The matrix representation given above constitutes an embedding into Dickson's group G 2 (4) . There are two conjugacy classes of HJ in G 2 (4), and they are equivalent under the automorphism on the field F 4 . Their intersection (the "real" subgroup) is simple of order 6048. G 2 (4) is in turn isomorphic to a subgroup of the Conway group Co 1 .  Maximal subgroups  There are 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J 2 . Some are here described in terms of action on the Hall–Janko graph.   U 3 (3) order 6048 – one-point stabilizer, with orbits of 36 and 63    Simple, containing 36 simple subgroups of order 168 and 63 involutions, all conjugate, each moving 80 points. A given involution is found in 12 168-subgroups, thus fixes them under conjugacy. Its centralizer has structure 4.S 4 , which contains 6 additional involutions.    3.PGL(2,9) order 2160 – has a subquotient A 6  2 1+4 :A 5 order 1920 – centralizer of involution moving 80 points  2 2+4 :(3 × S 3 ) order 1152  A 4 × A 5 order 720    Containing 2 2 × A 5 (order 240), centralizer of 3 involutions each moving 100 points    A 5 × D 10 order 600  PGL(2,7) order 336  5 2 :D 12 order 300  A 5 order 60   Conjugacy classes  The maximum order of any element is 15.
