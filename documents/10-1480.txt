Glutathione—homocystine transhydrogenase

In enzymology, a glutathione—homocystine transhydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 glutathione + homocystine 
 
 
 
  glutathione disulfide + 2 homocysteine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glutathione and homocystine, whereas its two products are glutathione disulfide and homocysteine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutathione:homocystine oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism and glutathione metabolism.
