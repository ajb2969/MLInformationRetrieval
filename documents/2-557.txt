   Ampere-turn      Ampere-turn   The ampere-turn (AT) was the MKS (Meters, Kilograms, Seconds) unit of magnetomotive force (MMF), represented by a direct current of one ampere flowing in a single-turn loop in a vacuum. 1 " Turns " refers to the winding number of an electrical conductor comprising an inductor.  For example, a current of 2A flowing through a coil of 10 turns produces an MMF of 20 AT.  By maintaining the same current and increasing the number of loops or turns of the coil, the strength of the magnetic field increases because each loop or turn of the coil sets up its own magnetic field. The magnetic field unites with the fields of the other loops to produce the field around the entire coil making the total magnetic field stronger.  The strength of the magnetic field is not linearly related to the ampere turns when a magnetic material is used as a part of the system. Also, the material within the magnet carrying the magnetic flux "saturates" at some point, when adding more ampere turns has little effect.  The ampere-turn is equal to     4  π   /  10        4  π   10    4\pi/10    gilberts , the equivalent CGS unit.  Alternatively, NI has been used in industry, specifically, US based coil making industries.
