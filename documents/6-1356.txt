   Holomorph (mathematics)      Holomorph (mathematics)   In mathematics , especially in the area of algebra known as group theory , the holomorph of a group is a group which simultaneously contains (copies of) the group and its automorphism group . The holomorph provides interesting examples of groups, and allows one to treat group elements and group automorphisms in a uniform context. In group theory, for a group   G   G   G   , the holomorph of   G   G   G   denoted    Hol   (  G  )      Hol  G    \operatorname{Hol}(G)   can be described as a semidirect product or as a permutation group .  Hol( G ) as a semi-direct product  If    Aut   (  G  )      Aut  G    \operatorname{Aut}(G)   is the automorphism group of   G   G   G   then       Hol   (  G  )    =   G  ⋊   Aut   (  G  )          Hol  G    right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  G   Aut  G      \operatorname{Hol}(G)=G\rtimes\operatorname{Aut}(G)   where the multiplication is given by         (  g  ,  α  )    (  h  ,  β  )    =   (   g  α   (  h  )    ,   α  β   )    .         g  α    h  β       g  α  h     α  β      (g,\alpha)(h,\beta)=(g\alpha(h),\alpha\beta).   [Eq. 1]  Typically, a semidirect product is given in the form    G   ⋊  ϕ   A      subscript  right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  ϕ   G  A    G\rtimes_{\phi}A   where   G   G   G   and   A   A   A   are groups and    ϕ  :   A  →   Aut   (  G  )        normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  A   Aut  G      \phi:A\rightarrow\operatorname{Aut}(G)   is a homomorphism and where the multiplication of elements in the semi-direct product is given as        (  g  ,  a  )    (  h  ,  b  )    =   (   g  ϕ   (  a  )    (  h  )    ,   a  b   )          g  a    h  b       g  ϕ  a  h     a  b      (g,a)(h,b)=(g\phi(a)(h),ab)   which is well defined , since     ϕ   (  a  )    ∈   Aut   (  G  )          ϕ  a    Aut  G     \phi(a)\in\operatorname{Aut}(G)   and therefore     ϕ   (  a  )    (  h  )    ∈  G        ϕ  a  h   G    \phi(a)(h)\in G   .  For the holomorph,    A  =   Aut   (  G  )        A   Aut  G     A=\operatorname{Aut}(G)   and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the identity map , as such we suppress writing   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   explicitly in the multiplication given in [Eq. 1] above.  For example,       G  =   C  3   =   ⟨  x  ⟩   =   {  1  ,  x  ,   x  2   }         G   subscript  C  3         delimited-⟨⟩  x         1  x   superscript  x  2       G=C_{3}=\langle x\rangle=\{1,x,x^{2}\}   the cyclic group of order 3       Aut   (  G  )    =   ⟨  σ  ⟩   =   {  1  ,  σ  }          Aut  G    delimited-⟨⟩  σ         1  σ      \operatorname{Aut}(G)=\langle\sigma\rangle=\{1,\sigma\}   where     σ   (  x  )    =   x  2         σ  x    superscript  x  2     \sigma(x)=x^{2}          Hol   (  G  )    =   {   (   x  i   ,   σ  j   )   }        Hol  G      superscript  x  i    superscript  σ  j       \operatorname{Hol}(G)=\{(x^{i},\sigma^{j})\}   with the multiplication given by:         (   x   i  1    ,   σ   j  1    )    (   x   i  2    ,   σ   j  2    )    =   (   x    i  1   +    i  2    2     j  1        ,   σ    j  1   +   j  2     )           superscript  x   subscript  i  1     superscript  σ   subscript  j  1       superscript  x   subscript  i  2     superscript  σ   subscript  j  2        superscript  x     subscript  i  1      subscript  i  2    superscript  2    subscript  j  1         superscript  σ     subscript  j  1    subscript  j  2        (x^{i_{1}},\sigma^{j_{1}})(x^{i_{2}},\sigma^{j_{2}})=(x^{i_{1}+i_{2}2^{{}^{j_{%
 1}}}},\sigma^{j_{1}+j_{2}})   where the exponents of   x   x   x   are taken mod 3 and those of   σ   σ   \sigma   mod 2.  Observe, for example        (  x  ,  σ  )    (   x  2   ,  σ  )    =   (   x   1  +   2  ⋅  2     ,   σ  2   )   =   (   x  2   ,  1  )            x  σ     superscript  x  2   σ      superscript  x    1   normal-⋅  2  2      superscript  σ  2           superscript  x  2   1      (x,\sigma)(x^{2},\sigma)=(x^{1+2\cdot 2},\sigma^{2})=(x^{2},1)   and note also that this group is not abelian , as      (   x  2   ,  σ  )    (  x  ,  σ  )    =   (  x  ,  1  )           superscript  x  2   σ    x  σ     x  1     (x^{2},\sigma)(x,\sigma)=(x,1)   , so that    Hol   (   C  3   )      Hol   subscript  C  3     \operatorname{Hol}(C_{3})   is a non-abelian group of order 6 which, by basic group theory, must be isomorphic to the symmetric group     S  3     subscript  S  3    S_{3}   .  Hol( G ) as a permutation group  A group G acts naturally on itself by left and right multiplication, each giving rise to a homomorphism from G into the symmetric group on the underlying set of G . One homomorphism is defined as λ : G → Sym( G ), λ ( g )( h ) = g · h . That is, g is mapped to the permutation obtained by left multiplying each element of G by g . Similarly, a second homomorphism ρ : G → Sym( G ) is defined by ρ ( g )( h ) = h · g −1 , where the inverse ensures that ρ ( g · h )( k ) = ρ ( g )( ρ ( h )( k )). These homomorphisms are called the left and right regular representations of G . Each homomorphism is injective , a fact referred to as Cayley's theorem .  For example, if G = C 3 = {1, x , x 2 } is a cyclic group of order three, then   λ ( x )(1) = x ·1 = x ,  λ ( x )( x ) = x · x = x 2 , and  λ ( x )( x 2 ) = x · x 2 = 1,   so λ ( x ) takes (1, x , x 2 ) to ( x , x 2 , 1).  The image of λ is a subgroup of Sym( G ) isomorphic to G , and its normalizer in Sym( G ) is defined to be the holomorph  H of G . For each f in H and g in G , there is an h in G such that f · λ ( g ) = λ ( h )· f . If an element f of the holomorph fixes the identity of G , then for 1 in G , ( f · λ ( g ))( 1 ) = ( λ ( h )· f )( 1 ), but the left hand side is f ( g ), and the right side is h . In other words, if f in H fixes the identity of G , then for every g in G , f · λ ( g ) = λ ( f ( g ))· f . If g , h are elements of G , and f is an element of H fixing the identity of G , then applying this equality twice to f · λ ( g )· λ ( h ) and once to the (equivalent) expression f · λ ( g · h ) gives that f ( g )· f ( h ) = f ( g · h ). That is, every element of H that fixes the identity of G is in fact an automorphism of G . Such an f normalizes λ ( G ), and the only λ ( g ) that fixes the identity is λ (1). Setting A to be the stabilizer (group theory) of the identity, the subgroup generated by A and λ ( G ) is semidirect product with normal subgroup  λ ( G ) and complement  A . Since λ ( G ) is transitive , the subgroup generated by λ ( G ) and the point stabilizer A is all of H , which shows the holomorph as a permutation group is isomorphic to the holomorph as semidirect product.  It is useful, but not directly relevant, that the centralizer of λ ( G ) in Sym( G ) is ρ ( G ), their intersection is ρ (Z( G )) = λ (Z( G )), where Z( G ) is the center of G , and that A is a common complement to both of these normal subgroups of H .  Properties   ρ ( G ) ∩ Aut( G ) = 1  Aut( G ) normalizes ρ ( G ) so that canonically  ρ ( G )Aut( G ) ≅ G ⋊ Aut( G )       Inn   (  G  )    ≅   Im   (   g  ↦   λ   (  g  )   ρ   (  g  )     )         Inn  G    Im   maps-to  g    λ  g  ρ  g       \operatorname{Inn}(G)\cong\operatorname{Im}(g\mapsto\lambda(g)\rho(g))   since λ ( g ) ρ ( g )( h ) = ghg −1  K ≤ G is a characteristic subgroup if and only if λ ( K ) ⊴ Hol( G )   References     "  Category:Group theory  Category:Group automorphisms
