Integral representation theorem for classical Wiener space

In mathematics, the integral representation theorem for classical Wiener space is a result in the fields of measure theory and stochastic analysis. Essentially, it shows how to decompose a function on classical Wiener space into the sum of its expected value and an Itō integral.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  (or simply 
 
 
 
  for short) be classical Wiener space with classical Wiener measure 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a unique Itō integrable process 
 
 
 
  (i.e. in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is canonical Brownian motion) such that



for 
 
 
 
 
 -almost all 
 
 
 
 .
In the above,



 
  is the expected value of 
 
 
 
 ; and
the integral 
 
 
 
  is an Itō integral.

The proof of the integral representation theorem requires the Clark-Ocone theorem from the Malliavin calculus.
Corollary: integral representation for an arbitrary probability space
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a probability space. Let 
 
 
 
  be a Brownian motion (i.e. a stochastic process whose law is Wiener measure). Let 
 
 
 
  be the natural filtration of 
 
 
 
  by the Brownian motion 
 
 
 
 :








Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -measurable. Then there is a unique Itō integrable process 
 
 
 
  such that





 
 
 -almost surely.
