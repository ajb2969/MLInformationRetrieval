   *-autonomous category      *-autonomous category   In mathematics , a *-autonomous (read "star-autonomous") category''' C is a symmetric  monoidal closed category equipped with a dualizing object   ⊥   bottom   \bot   .  Definition  Let C be a symmetric monoidal closed category. For any object A and   ⊥   bottom   \bot   , there exists a morphism       ∂   A  ,  ⊥    :  A  →   (  A  ⇒  ⊥  )   ⇒  ⊥     fragments   subscript    A  bottom    normal-:  A  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-⇒  bottom  normal-)   normal-⇒  bottom    \partial_{A,\bot}:A\to(A\Rightarrow\bot)\Rightarrow\bot   defined as the image by the bijection defining the monoidal closure, of the morphism       eval    A  ,  A   ⇒  ⊥    ∘   γ   A  ⇒   ⊥  ,  A     :   (  A  ⇒  ⊥  )   ⊗  A  →  ⊥     fragments   subscript  eval   normal-⇒   A  A   bottom      subscript  γ   normal-⇒  A   bottom  A     normal-:   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-⇒  bottom  normal-)   tensor-product  A  normal-→  bottom    \mathrm{eval}_{A,A\Rightarrow\bot}\circ\gamma_{A\Rightarrow\bot,A}:(A%
 \Rightarrow\bot)\otimes A\to\bot   An object   ⊥   bottom   \bot   of the category C is called dualizing when the associated morphism    ∂   A  ,  ⊥      subscript    A  bottom     \partial_{A,\bot}   is an isomorphism for every object A of the category C .  Equivalently, a *-autonomous category is a symmetric monoidal category C together with a functor      (  -  )   *   :    C  op   →  C      normal-:   superscript      normal-→   superscript  C  op   C     (-)^{*}:C^{\mathrm{op}}\to C   such that for every object A there is a natural isomorphism    A  ≅   A   *   *       A   superscript   superscript  A        A\cong{A^{*}}^{*}   , and for every three objects A , B and C there is a natural bijection       Hom   (   A  ⊗  B   ,   C  *   )    ≅   Hom   (  A  ,    (   B  ⊗  C   )   *   )          Hom    tensor-product  A  B    superscript  C        Hom   A   superscript   tensor-product  B  C         \mathrm{Hom}(A\otimes B,C^{*})\cong\mathrm{Hom}(A,(B\otimes C)^{*})   . The dualizing object of C is then defined by    ⊥  =   I  *      fragments  bottom    superscript  I      \bot=I^{*}   .  Properties  Compact closed categories are *-autonomous, with the monoidal unit as the dualizing object. Conversely, if the unit of a *-autonomous category is a dualizing object then there is a canonical family of maps        A  *   ⊗   B  *    →    (   B  ⊗  A   )   *      normal-→   tensor-product   superscript  A     superscript  B      superscript   tensor-product  B  A       A^{*}\otimes B^{*}\to(B\otimes A)^{*}   .  These are all isomorphisms if and only if the *-autonomous category is compact closed.  Examples  A familiar example is given by matrix theory as finite-dimensional linear algebra, namely the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over any field k made monoidal with the usual tensor product of vector spaces. The dualizing object is k , the one-dimensional vector space, and dualization corresponds to transposition. Although the category of all vector spaces over k is not *-autonomous, suitable extensions to categories of topological vector spaces can be made *-autonomous.  Various models of linear logic form *-autonomous categories, the earliest of which was Jean-Yves Girard 's category of coherence spaces.  The category of complete semilattices with morphisms preserving all joins but not necessarily meets is *-autonomous with dualizer the chain of two elements. A degenerate example (all homsets of cardinality at most one) is given by any Boolean algebra (as a partially ordered set ) made monoidal using conjunction for the tensor product and taking 0 as the dualizing object.  An example of a self-dual category that is not *-autonomous is finite linear orders and continuous functions, which has * but is not autonomous: its dualizing object is the two-element chain but there is no tensor product.  The category of sets and their partial injections is self-dual because the converse of the latter is again a partial injection.  The concept of *-autonomous category was introduced by Michael Barr in 1979 in a monograph with that title. Barr defined the notion for the more general situation of V -categories, categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal or autonomous category V . The definition above specializes Barr's definition to the case V = Set of ordinary categories, those whose homobjects form sets (of morphisms). Barr's monograph includes an appendix by his student Po-Hsiang Chu which develops the details of a construction due to Barr showing the existence of nontrivial *-autonomous V -categories for all symmetric monoidal categories V with pullbacks, whose objects became known a decade later as Chu spaces .  Non symmetric case  In a biclosed monoidal category  C , not necessarily symmetric, it is still possible to define a dualizing object and then define a *-autonomous category as a biclosed monoidal category with a dualizing object. They are equivalent definitions, as in the symmetric case.  References       "  Category:Monoidal categories  Category:Closed categories
