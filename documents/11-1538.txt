Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase

In enzymology, a mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

GTP + alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + GDP-mannose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and GDP-mannose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:alpha-D-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase. Other names in common use include GTP-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, PIM-GMP (phosphomannose isomerase-guanosine 5'-diphospho-D-mannose, pyrophosphorylase), GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, guanosine 5'-diphospho-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase, guanosine diphosphomannose pyrophosphorylase, guanosine triphosphate-mannose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, and mannose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (guanosine triphosphate). This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
Structural studies
