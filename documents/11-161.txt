   3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase      3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   crotonoyl-CoA + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA , and two products , crotonoyl-CoA and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA hydro-lyase (crotonoyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include D-3-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A dehydratase , D-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase , enoyl coenzyme A hydrase (D) , and (3R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
