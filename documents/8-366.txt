Glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D (, GPI-PLD, glycoprotein phospholipase D, phosphatidylinositol phospholipase D, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D) is an enzyme with system name glycoprotein-phosphatidylinositol phosphatidohydrolase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol + H2O 
 
 
 
  6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol + 3-sn-phosphatidate
 

This enzyme cleaves proteins from the lipid part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors.
