   Diacetyl reductase ((R)-acetoin forming)      Diacetyl reductase ((R)-acetoin forming)   Diacetyl reductase ((R)-acetoin forming) (, (R)-acetoin dehydrogenase ) is an enzyme with system name (R)-acetoin:NAD + oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (R)-acetoin + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diacetyl + NADH + H +    The reaction is catalysed in the reverse direction. This activity is usually associated with butanediol dehydrogenase activity (EC 1.1.1.4 or EC 1.1.1.76). While the butanediol dehydrogenase activity is reversible, diacetyl reductase activity is irreversible. This enzyme has been reported in the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae . This enzyme is different from EC 1.1.1.304, diacetyl reductase ((S)-acetoin forming) .  References  "  Category:EC 1.1.1     ↩  ↩
