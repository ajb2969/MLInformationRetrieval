Rational difference equation

A rational difference equation is a nonlinear difference equation of the form123


 
  where the initial conditions 
 
 
 
  are such that the denominator never vanishes for any 
 
 
 
 .
First-order rational difference equation
A first-order rational difference equation is a nonlinear difference equation of the form



When 
 
 
 
  and the initial condition 
 
 
 
  are real numbers, this difference equation is called a Riccati difference equation.4
Such an equation can be solved by writing 
 
 
 
  as a nonlinear transformation of another variable 
 
 
 
  which itself evolves linearly. Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in 
 
 
 
 .
Solving a first-order equation
First approach
One approach 5 to developing the transformed variable 
 
 
 
 , when 
 
 
 
 , is to write


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and where 
 
 
 
 .
Further writing 
 
 
 
  can be shown to yield



Second approach
This approach 6 gives a first-order difference equation for 
 
 
 
  instead of a second-order one, for the case in which 
 
 
 
  is non-negative. Write 
 
 
 
  implying 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
  and where 
 
 
 
 . Then it can be shown that 
 
 
 
  evolves according to



Third approach
The equation



can also be solved by treating it as a special case of the more general matrix equation



where all of A, B, C, E, and X are n×n matrices (in this case n=1); the solution of this is7



where



Application
It was shown in 8 that a dynamic matrix Riccati equation of the form



which can arise in some discrete-time optimal control problems, can be solved using the second approach above if the matrix C has only one more row than column.
