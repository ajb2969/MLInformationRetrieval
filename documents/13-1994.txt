   Rational difference equation      Rational difference equation   A rational difference equation is a nonlinear difference equation of the form 1 2 3        x   n  +  1    =     α  +    ∑   i  =  0   k     β  i    x   n  -  i        A  +    ∑   i  =  0   k     B  i    x   n  -  i          ,       subscript  x    n  1        α    superscript   subscript     i  0    k      subscript  β  i    subscript  x    n  i         A    superscript   subscript     i  0    k      subscript  B  i    subscript  x    n  i          x_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha+\sum_{i=0}^{k}\beta_{i}x_{n-i}}{A+\sum_{i=0}^{k}B_{i}x_{n%

First-order rational difference equation  A first-order rational difference equation is a nonlinear difference equation of the form        w   t  +  1    =     a   w  t    +  b     c   w  t    +  d     .       subscript  w    t  1          a   subscript  w  t    b       c   subscript  w  t    d      w_{t+1}=\frac{aw_{t}+b}{cw_{t}+d}.     When    a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d     a  b  c  d    a,b,c,d   and the initial condition    w  0     subscript  w  0    w_{0}   are real numbers, this difference equation is called a Riccati difference equation . 4  Such an equation can be solved by writing    w  t     subscript  w  t    w_{t}   as a nonlinear transformation of another variable    x  t     subscript  x  t    x_{t}   which itself evolves linearly. Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in    x  t     subscript  x  t    x_{t}   .  Solving a first-order equation  First approach  One approach 5 to developing the transformed variable    x  t     subscript  x  t    x_{t}   , when      a  d   -   b  c    ≠  0          a  d     b  c    0    ad-bc\neq 0   , is to write       y   t  +  1    =   α  -   β   y  t          subscript  y    t  1      α    β   subscript  y  t       y_{t+1}=\alpha-\frac{\beta}{y_{t}}   where    α  =    (   a  +  d   )   /  c       α      a  d   c     \alpha=(a+d)/c   and    β  =    (    a  d   -   b  c    )   /   c  2        β        a  d     b  c     superscript  c  2      \beta=(ad-bc)/c^{2}   and where     w  t   =    y  t   -   d  /  c         subscript  w  t      subscript  y  t     d  c      w_{t}=y_{t}-d/c   .  Further writing     y  t   =    x   t  +  1    /   x  t         subscript  y  t      subscript  x    t  1     subscript  x  t      y_{t}=x_{t+1}/x_{t}   can be shown to yield         x   t  +  2    -   α   x   t  +  1      +   β   x  t     =   0.            subscript  x    t  2      α   subscript  x    t  1        β   subscript  x  t     0.    x_{t+2}-\alpha x_{t+1}+\beta x_{t}=0.\,     Second approach  This approach 6 gives a first-order difference equation for    x  t     subscript  x  t    x_{t}   instead of a second-order one, for the case in which      (   d  -  a   )   2   +   4  b  c        superscript    d  a   2     4  b  c     (d-a)^{2}+4bc   is non-negative. Write     x  t   =   1  /   (   η  +   w  t    )         subscript  x  t     1    η   subscript  w  t       x_{t}=1/(\eta+w_{t})   implying     w  t   =    (   1  -   η   x  t     )   /   x  t         subscript  w  t       1    η   subscript  x  t      subscript  x  t      w_{t}=(1-\eta x_{t})/x_{t}   , where   η   η   \eta   is given by    η  =     (    d  -  a   +  r   )   /  2   c       η          d  a   r   2   c     \eta=(d-a+r)/2c   and where    r  =      (   d  -  a   )   2   +   4  b  c         r       superscript    d  a   2     4  b  c       r=\sqrt{(d-a)^{2}+4bc}   . Then it can be shown that    x  t     subscript  x  t    x_{t}   evolves according to        x   t  +  1    =     (    d  -   η  c      η  c   +  a    )    x  t    +   c    η  c   +  a      .       subscript  x    t  1            d    η  c        η  c   a     subscript  x  t      c      η  c   a       x_{t+1}=\left(\frac{d-\eta c}{\eta c+a}\right)x_{t}+\frac{c}{\eta c+a}.     Third approach  The equation       w   t  +  1    =     a   w  t    +  b     c   w  t    +  d         subscript  w    t  1          a   subscript  w  t    b       c   subscript  w  t    d      w_{t+1}=\frac{aw_{t}+b}{cw_{t}+d}     can also be solved by treating it as a special case of the more general matrix equation        X   t  +  1    =   -    (   E  +   B   X  t     )     (   C  +   A   X  t     )    -  1       ,       subscript  X    t  1          E    B   subscript  X  t      superscript    C    A   subscript  X  t       1        X_{t+1}=-(E+BX_{t})(C+AX_{t})^{-1},     where all of A, B, C, E, and X are n × n matrices (in this case n =1); the solution of this is 7       X  t   =    N  t    D  t   -  1          subscript  X  t      subscript  N  t    superscript   subscript  D  t     1       X_{t}=N_{t}D_{t}^{-1}     where        (      N  t        D  t      )   =     (      -  B      -  E       A    C     )   t    (      X  0       I     )     .         subscript  N  t      subscript  D  t        superscript      B     E     A  C    t      subscript  X  0     I       \begin{pmatrix}N_{t}\\
 D_{t}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-B&-E\\
 A&C\end{pmatrix}^{t}\begin{pmatrix}X_{0}\\
 I\end{pmatrix}.     Application  It was shown in 8 that a dynamic matrix Riccati equation of the form        H   t  -  1    =    K  +    A  ′    H  t   A    -    A  ′    H  t   C    (    C  ′    H  t   C   )    -  1     C  ′    H  t   A     ,       subscript  H    t  1        K     superscript  A  normal-′    subscript  H  t   A       superscript  A  normal-′    subscript  H  t   C   superscript     superscript  C  normal-′    subscript  H  t   C     1     superscript  C  normal-′    subscript  H  t   A      H_{t-1}=K+A^{\prime}H_{t}A-A^{\prime}H_{t}C(C^{\prime}H_{t}C)^{-1}C^{\prime}H_%
