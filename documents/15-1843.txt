   Jordan operator algebra      Jordan operator algebra  In [[mathematics]], '''Jordan operator algebras''' are real or complex [[Jordan algebra]]s with the compatible structure of a Banach space. When the coefficients are [[real numbers]], the algebras are called '''Jordan Banach algebras'''. The theory has been extensively developed only for the subclass of '''JB algebras'''. The axioms for these algebras were devised by {{harvtxt|Alfsen|Schultz|Størmer|1978}}. Those that can be realised concretely as subalgebras of self-adjoint operators on a real or complex Hilbert space with the operator Jordan product and the [[operator norm]] are called '''JC algebras'''. The axioms for complex Jordan operator algebras, first suggested by [[Irving Kaplansky]] in 1976, require an involution and are called '''JB* algebras''' or '''Jordan C* algebras'''. By analogy with the abstract characterisation of von  Neumann  algebras as C*  algebras for which the underlying Banach space is the dual of another, there is a corresponding definition of JBW  algebras . Those that can be realised using ultraweakly  closed Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators with the operator Jordan product are called JW  algebras . The JBW algebras with trivial center, so-called JBW  factors , are classified in terms of von Neumann factors: apart from the exceptional 27 dimensional Albert  algebra and the spin  factors , all other JBW factors are isomorphic either to the self-adjoint part of a von Neumann factor or to its fixed point algebra under a period two *-antiautomorphism. Jordan operator algebras have been applied in quantum  mechanics and in complex  geometry , where Koecher's description of bounded  symmetric  domains using Jordan  algebras has been extended to infinite dimensions.  Definitions  JC algebra  A JC algebra is a real subspace of the space of self-adjoint operators on a real or complex Hilbert space, closed under the operator Jordan product a ∘ b = ½( ab + ba ) and closed in the operator norm.  Jordan Banach algebra  A Jordan Banach algebra is a real Jordan algebra with a norm making it a Banach space and satisfying || a ∘ b || ≤ || a ||⋅|| b ||.  JB algebra  A JB algebra is a Jordan Banach algebra satisfying         ∥   a  2   ∥   =    ∥  a  ∥   2    ,    ∥   a  2   ∥   ≤   ∥    a  2   +   b  2    ∥     .     formulae-sequence     norm   superscript  a  2     superscript   norm  a   2       norm   superscript  a  2     norm     superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2        \displaystyle{\|a^{2}\|=\|a\|^{2},\,\,\,\|a^{2}\|\leq\|a^{2}+b^{2}\|.}     JB* algebras  A JB* algebra or Jordan C* algebra is a complex Jordan algebra with an involution a ↦ a * and a norm making it a Banach space and satisfying   || a ∘ b || ≤ || a ||⋅|| b ||  || a *|| = || a ||  ||{ a , a *, a }|| = || a || 3 where the Jordan triple product is defined by { a , b , c } = ( a ∘ b ) ∘ c + ( c ∘ b ) ∘ a − ( a ∘ c ) ∘ b .   JW algebras  A JW algebra is a Jordan subalgebra of the Jordan algebra of self-adjoint operators on a complex Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology .  JBW algebras  A JBW algebra is a JB algebra that, as a real Banach space, is the dual of a Banach space called its predual . 1 There is an equivalent more technical definition in terms of the continuity properties of the linear functionals in the predual, called normal functionals . This is usually taken as the definition and the abstract characterization as a dual Banach space derived as a consequence. 2   For the order structure on a JB algebra (defined below), any increasing net of operators bounded in norm should have a least upper bound.  Normal functionals are those that are continuous on increasing bounded nets of operators. Positive normal functional are those that are non-negative on positive operators.  For every non-zero operator, there is a positive normal functional that does not vanish on that operator.   Properties of JB algebras   If a unital JB algebra is associative , then its complexification with its natural involution is a commutative C* algebra. It is therefore isomorphic to C( X ) for a compact Hausdorff space X , the space of characters of the algebra.  Spectral theorem. If a is a single operator in a JB algebra, the closed subalgebra generated by 1 and a is associative. It can be identified with the continuous real-valued functions on the spectrum of a , the set of real λ for which a − λ1 is not invertible.  The positive elements in a unital JB algebra are those with spectrum contained in [0,∞). By the spectral theorem, they coincide with the space of squares and form a closed convex cone. If b ≥ 0, then { a , b , a } ≥ 0.  A JB algebra is a formally real Jordan algebra : if a sum of squares of terms is zero, then each term is zero. In finite dimensions, a JB algebra is isomorphic to a Euclidean Jordan algebra . 3  The spectral radius on a JB algebra defines an equivalent norm also satisfying the axioms for a JB algebra.  A state on a unital JB algebra is a bounded linear functional f such that f (1) = 1 and f is non-negative on the positive cone. The state space is a convex set closed in the weak* topology. The extreme points are called pure states. Given a there is a pure state f such that | f ( a )| = || a ||.  Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction : If a JB algebra is isomorphic to the self-adjoint n by n matrices with coefficients in some associative unital *-algebra, then it is isometrically isomorphic to a JC algebra. The JC algebra satisfies the additional condition that ( T + T *)/2 lies in the algebra whenever T is a product of operators from the algebra. 4  A JB algebra is purely exceptional if it has no non-zero Jordan homomorphism onto a JC algebra. The only simple algebra that can arise as the homomorphic image of a purely exceptional JB algebra is the Albert algebra , the 3 by 3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions .  Every JB algebra has a uniquely determined closed ideal that is purely exceptional, and such that the quotient by the ideal is a JC algebra.  Shirshov–Cohn theorem. A JB algebra generated by 2 elements is a JC algebra. 5   Properties of JB* algebras  The definition of JB* algebras was suggested in 1976 by Irving Kaplansky at a lecture in Edinburgh. The real part of a JB* algebra is always a JB algebra.  proved that conversely the complexification of every JB algebra is a JB* algebra. JB* algebras have been used extensively as a framework for studying bounded symmetric domains in infinite dimensions. This generalizes the theory in finite dimensions developed by Max Koecher using the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra . See:       Properties of JBW algebras  Elementary properties   The Kaplansky density theorem holds for real unital Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space with the operator Jordan product. In particular a Jordan algebra is closed in the weak operator topology if and only if it is closed in the ultraweak operator topology . The two topologies coincide on the Jordan algebra. See:       For a JBW algebra, the space of positive normal functionals is invariant under the quadratic representation Q ( a ) b = { a , b , a }. If f is positive so is f ∘ Q ( a ).  The weak topology on a JW algebra M is define by the seminorms | f ( a )| where f is a normal state; the strong topology is defined by the seminorms | f ( a 2 )| 1/2 . The quadratic representation and Jordan product operators L ( a ) b = a ∘ b are continuous operators on M for the both the weak and strong topology.  An idempotent p in a JBW algebra M is called a projection . If p is a projection, then Q ( p ) M is a JBW algebra with identity p .  If a is any element of a JBW algebra, the smallest weakly closed unital subalgebra it generates is associative and hence the self-adjoint part of an Abelian von Neumann algebra. In particular a can be approximated in norm by linear combinations of orthogonal projections.  The projections in a JBW algebra are closed under lattice operations. Thus for an family p α there is a smallest projection p such that p ≥ p α and a largest projection q such that q ≤ p α .  The center of a JBW algebra M consists of all z such L ( z ) commutes with L ( a ) for a in M . It is an associative algebra and the real part of an Abelian von Neumann algebra. A JBW algebra is called a factor if its center consists of scalar operators.  If A is a JB algebra, its second dual A ** is a JBW algebra. The normal states are states in A * and can be identified with states on A . Moreover A ** is the JBW algebra generated by A .  A JB algebra is a JBW algebra if and only if, as a real Banach space, it is the dual of a Banach space. This Banach space, its predual , is the space of normal functionals, defined as differences of positive normal functionals. These are the functionals continuous for the weak or strong topologies. As a consequence the weak and strong topologies coincide on a JBW algebra.  In a JBW algebra, the JBW algebra generated by a Jordan subalgebra coincides with its weak closure. Moreover an extension of the Kaplansky density theorem holds: the unit ball of the subalgebra is weakly dense in the unit ball of the JBW algebra it generates.  Tomita–Takesaki theory has been extended by  to normal states of a JBW algebra that are faithful, i.e. do not vanish on any non-zero positive operator. The theory can be deduced from the original theory for von Neumann algebras. 6   Comparison of projections  Let M be a JBW factor. The inner automorphisms of M are those generated by the period two automorphisms Q (1 – 2 p ) where p is a projection. Two projections are equivalent if there is an inner automorphism carrying one onto the other. Given two projections in a factor, one of them is always equivalent to a subprojection of the other. If each is equivalent to a subprojection of the other, they are equivalent.  A JBW factor can be classified into three mutually exclusive types as follows:   It is type I if there is a minimal projection. It is type I n if 1 can be written as a sum of n orthogonal minimal projections for 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞.  It is Type II if there are no minimal projections but the subprojections of some fixed projections e form a modular lattice , i.e. p ≤ q implies ( p ∨ r ) ∧ q = p ∨ ( r ∧ q ) for any projection r ≤ e . If e can be taken to be 1, it is Type II 1 . Otherwise it is type II ≈ .  It is Type III if the projections do not form a modular lattice. All non-zero projections are then equivalent. 7   Tomita–Takesaki theory permits a further classification of the type III case into types III λ (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1) with the additional invariant of an ergodic flow on a Lebesgue space (the "flow of weights") when λ = 0. 8  Classification of JBW factors of Type I   The JBW factor of Type I 1 is the real numbers .  The JBW factors of Type I 2 are the spin factors . Let H be a real Hilbert space of dimension greater than 1. Set M = H ⊕ R with inner product ( u ⊕λ, v ⊕μ) =( u , v ) + λμ and product (u⊕λ)∘(v⊕μ)=( μ u + λ v ) ⊕ [( u , v ) + λμ]. With the operator norm || L ( a )||, M is a JBW factor and also a JW factor.  The JBW factors of Type I 3 are the self-adjoint 3 by 3 matrices with entries in the real numbers, the complex numbers or the quaternions or the octonions .  The JBW factors of Type I n with 4 ≤ n < ∞ are the self-adjoint n by n matrices with entries in the real numbers, the complex numbers or the quaternions.  The JBW factors of Type I ∞ are the self-adjoint operators on the unique infinire-dimensional real, complex or quaternionic Hilbert space. The quaternionic space is defined as all sequences x = ( x i ) with x i in H and ∑ | x i | 2  i )* x i . There is an underlying real inner product given by ( x , y ) R = Re ( x , y ). The quaternionic JBW factor of Type I ∞ is thus the Jordan algebra of all self-adjoint operators on this real inner product space that commute with the action of right multiplication by H . 9   Classification of JBW factors of Types II and III  The JBW factors not of Type I 2 and I 3 are all JW factors, i.e. can be realized as Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space closed in the weak operator topology. Every JBW factor not of Type I 2 or Type I 3 is isomorphic to the self-adjoint part of the fixed point algebra of a period 2 *-antiautomorphism of a von Neumann algebra. In particular each JBW factor is either isomorphic to the self-adjoint part of a von Neumann factor of the same type or to the self-adjoint part of the fixed point algebra of a period 2 *-antiautomorphism of a von Neumann factor of the same type. See:       For hyperfinite factors , the class of von Neumann factors completely classified by Connes and Haagerup, the period 2 *-antiautomorphisms have been classified up to conjugacy in the automorphism group of the factor.
