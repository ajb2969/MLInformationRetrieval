   Indirect Fourier transform      Indirect Fourier transform   Indirect Fourier transform (IFT) is a solution of ill-posed given by Fourier transform of noisy data (as from biological small-angle scattering ) proposed by Glatter. 1 IFT is used instead of direct Fourier transform of noisy data, since a direct FT would give large systematic errors. 2  Transform is computed by linear fit to a subfamily of functions corresponding to constraints on a reasonable solution. If a result of the transform is distance distribution function , it is common to assume that the function is non-negative, and is zero at P (0) =  0  and P ( D max )≥;0, where D max is a maximum diameter of the particle. It is approximately true, although it disregards inter-particle effects.  IFT is also performed in order to regularize noisy data. 3  Fourier transformation in small angle scattering  see Lindner et al. for a thorough introduction 4  The intensity I per unit volume V is expressed as:        I   (  𝐪  )    =    1  V     ∫  V     ∫  V    ρ   (  𝐫  )   ρ   (   𝐫  ′   )    e   -   i  𝐪   (   𝐫  -   𝐫  ′    )      d  𝐫  d   𝐫  ′        ,        I  𝐪       1  V     subscript   V     subscript   V     ρ  𝐫  ρ   superscript  𝐫  normal-′    superscript  e      i  𝐪    𝐫   superscript  𝐫  normal-′       d  𝐫  d   superscript  𝐫  normal-′         I(\mathbf{q})=\frac{1}{V}\int_{V}\int_{V}\rho(\mathbf{r})\rho(\mathbf{r}^{%

 \text{d}\mathbf{r}^{\prime},     where    ρ   (  𝐫  )       ρ  𝐫    \rho(\mathbf{r})   is the scattering length density. We introduce the correlation function    γ   (  𝐫  )       γ  𝐫    \gamma(\mathbf{r})   by:       I   (  𝐪  )    =    ∫  V    γ   (  𝐫  )    e   -    i  𝐪   ⋅  𝐫     d  𝐫          I  𝐪     subscript   V     γ  𝐫   superscript  e     normal-⋅    i  𝐪   𝐫     d  𝐫      I(\mathbf{q})=\int_{V}\gamma(\mathbf{r})e^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\text{d%
 }\mathbf{r}     That is, taking the fourier transformation of the correlation function gives the intensity.  The probability of finding, within a particle, a point   i   i   i   at a distance   r   r   r   from a given point   j   j   j   is given by the distance probability function     γ  0    (  r  )        subscript  γ  0   r    \gamma_{0}(r)   . And the connection between the correlation function    γ   (  r  )       γ  r    \gamma(r)   and the distance probability function     γ  0    (  r  )        subscript  γ  0   r    \gamma_{0}(r)   is given by:       γ   (  r  )    =     b  i   ⋅  b   j   γ  0    (  r  )   V         γ  r      normal-⋅   subscript  b  i   b   j   subscript  γ  0   r  V     \gamma(r)=b_{i}\cdot bj\gamma_{0}(r)V   ,  where    b  k     subscript  b  k    b_{k}   is the scattering length of the point   k   k   k   . That is, the correlation function is weighted by the scattering length. For X-ray scattering, the scattering length   b   b   b   is directly proportional to the electron density    ρ  e     subscript  ρ  e    \rho_{e}   .  Distance distribution function p(r)  See main article on distribution functions .  We introduce the distance distribution function    p   (  r  )       p  r    p(r)   also called the pair distance distribution function (PDDF). It is defined as:        p   (  r  )    =    γ   (  r  )    ⋅   r  2     .        p  r    normal-⋅    γ  r    superscript  r  2      p(r)=\gamma(r)\cdot r^{2}.     The    p   (  r  )       p  r    p(r)   function can be considered as a probability of the occurrence of specific distances in a sample weighted by the scattering length density    ρ   (  𝐫  )       ρ  𝐫    \rho(\mathbf{r})   . For diluted samples, the    p   (  r  )       p  r    p(r)   function is not weightened by the scattering length density, but by the excess scattering length density    Δ  ρ   (  𝐫  )       normal-Δ  ρ  𝐫    \Delta\rho(\mathbf{r})   , i.e. the difference between the scattering length density of position   r   r   r   in the sample and the scattering length density of the solvent. The excess scattering length density is also called the contrast. Since the contrast can be negative, the    p   (  r  )       p  r    p(r)   function may contain negative values. That is e.g. the case for alkyl groups in fat when dissolved in H 2 O.  Introduction to indirect fourier transformation  This is an brief outline of the method introduced by Otto Glatter (Glatter, 1977). 5 Another approach is given by Moore (Moore, 1980). 6  In indirect fourier transformation, a D max is defined and an initial distance distribution function     p  i    (  r  )        subscript  p  i   r    p_{i}(r)   is expressed as a sum of N cubic spline functions      ϕ  i    (  r  )        subscript  ϕ  i   r    \phi_{i}(r)   evenly distributed on the interval (0, D max ):  where    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   are scalar coefficients. The relation between the scattering intensity I(q) and the PDDF p i (r) is:  Inserting the expression for p i (r) (1) into (2) and using that the transformation from p(r) to I(q) is linear gives:        I   (  q  )    =   4  π    ∑   i  =  1   N     c  i    ψ  i    (  r  )       ,        I  q     4  π    superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  c  i    subscript  ψ  i   r       I(q)=4\pi\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}\psi_{i}(r),     where     ψ  i    (  r  )        subscript  ψ  i   r    \psi_{i}(r)   is given as:        ψ  i    (  r  )    =    ∫  0  ∞     ϕ  i    (  r  )     sin   (   q  r   )     q  r             subscript  ψ  i   r     superscript   subscript   0        subscript  ϕ  i   r        q  r      q  r        \psi_{i}(r)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\phi_{i}(r)\frac{\sin(qr)}{qr}     The    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   's are unchanged under the linear Fourier transformation and can be fitted to data, thereby obtaining the coifficients    c  i   f  i  t      superscript   subscript  c  i     f  i  t     c_{i}^{fit}   . Inserting these new coefficients into the expression for     p  i    (  r  )        subscript  p  i   r    p_{i}(r)   gives a final PDDF     p  f    (  r  )        subscript  p  f   r    p_{f}(r)   . The coefficients    c  i   f  i  t      superscript   subscript  c  i     f  i  t     c_{i}^{fit}   are chosen to minimize the reduced    χ  2     superscript  χ  2    \chi^{2}   of the fit, given by:       χ  2   =    1   M  -  P      ∑   k  =  1   M      [     I   e  x  p  e  r  i  m  e  n  t     (   q  k   )    -    I   f  i  t     (   q  k   )     ]   2     σ  2    (   q  k   )            superscript  χ  2       1    M  P      superscript   subscript     k  1    M      superscript   delimited-[]       subscript  I    e  x  p  e  r  i  m  e  n  t     subscript  q  k       subscript  I    f  i  t     subscript  q  k      2      superscript  σ  2    subscript  q  k         \chi^{2}=\frac{1}{M-P}\sum_{k=1}^{M}\frac{[I_{experiment}(q_{k})-I_{fit}(q_{k}%
 )]^{2}}{\sigma^{2}(q_{k})}     where   M   M   M   is the number of datapoints,   P   P   P   is number of free parameters and    σ   (   q  k   )       σ   subscript  q  k     \sigma(q_{k})   is the standard deviation (the error) on data point   k   k   k   . However, the problem is ill posed and a very oscillating function would also give a low    χ  2     superscript  χ  2    \chi^{2}   . Therefore, the smoothness function   S   S   S   is introduced:      S  =    ∑   i  =  1    N  -  1      (    c   i  +  1    -   c  i    )   2        S    superscript   subscript     i  1      N  1     superscript     subscript  c    i  1     subscript  c  i    2      S=\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(c_{i+1}-c_{i})^{2}   .  The larger the oscillations, the higher   S   S   S   . Instead of minimizing    χ  2     superscript  χ  2    \chi^{2}   , the Lagrangian     L  =    χ  2   +   α  S        L     superscript  χ  2     α  S      L=\chi^{2}+\alpha S   is minimized, where the Lagrange multiplier   α   α   \alpha   is called the smoothness parameter. It seems reasonably to call the method indirect fourier transformation, since a direct formation is not performed, but is done in three steps      p  i    (  r  )    →  fitting  →    p  f    (  r  )         normal-→     subscript  p  i   r   fitting    normal-→       subscript  p  f   r      p_{i}(r)\rightarrow\text{fitting}\rightarrow p_{f}(r)   .  Applications  There are recent proposals at automatic determination of constraint parameters using Bayesian reasoning 7 or heuristics. 8  Alternative approaches  The distance distribution function    p   (  r  )       p  r    p(r)   can also be obtained by IFT with an approach using maximum entropy (e.g. Jaynes, 1983; 9 Skilling, 1989 10 )  References    "  Category:Fourier analysis     ↩  ↩  ↩  Neutrons, X-rays and Light: Scattering Methds Applied to Soft Condensed Matter by P.
