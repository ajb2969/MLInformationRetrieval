   DVB-T2      DVB-T2   DVB-T2 is an abbreviation for " Digital Video Broadcasting – Second Generation Terrestrial "; it is the extension of the television standard DVB-T , issued by the consortium DVB , devised for the broadcast transmission of digital terrestrial television . DVB has been standardized by ETSI .  This system transmits compressed digital audio, video, and other data in "physical layer pipes" (PLPs), using OFDM modulation with concatenated channel coding and interleaving. The higher offered bit rate, with respect to its predecessor DVB-T, makes it a system suited for carrying HDTV signals on the terrestrial TV channel (though many broadcasters still use plain DVB-T for this purpose).  , it was implemented in broadcasts in the United Kingdom ( Freeview HD , eight channels across two multiplexes, plus an extra multiplex in Northern Ireland carrying three SD channels), Italy ( Europa 7 HD , twelve channels), Finland (21 channels, five in HD), Sweden (five channels), 1 2  Thailand (41 SD, 9 HD channels) 3  Flanders (18 SD Channels), Serbia (ten SD and HD version of the public broadcaster’s channel RTS ), 4  Ukraine (32 SD and HD channels in four nationwide multiplexes), Croatia (two pay-TV multiplexes), Denmark , Romania ( along with the existing DVB-T mpeg4 only Bucharest and Sibiu) and some other countries.  History  Preliminary investigation  In March 2006 DVB decided to study options for an upgraded DVB-T standard. In June 2006, a formal study group named TM-T2 (Technical Module on Next Generation DVB-T) was established by the DVB Group to develop an advanced modulation scheme that could be adopted by a second generation digital terrestrial television standard, to be named DVB-T2 . 5  According to the commercial requirements and call for technologies 6 issued in April 2007, the first phase of DVB-T2 would be devoted to provide optimum reception for stationary (fixed) and portable receivers (i.e., units which can be nomadic, but not fully mobile) using existing aerials, whereas a second and third phase would study methods to deliver higher payloads (with new aerials) and the mobile reception issue. The novel system should provide a minimum 30% increase in payload, under similar channel conditions already used for DVB-T.  The BBC , ITV , Channel 4 and Channel 5 agreed with the regulator Ofcom to convert one UK multiplex (B, or PSB3) to DVB-T2 to increase capacity for HDTV via DTT. 7 They expected the first TV region to use the new standard would be Granada in November 2009 (with existing switched over regions being changed at the same time). It was expected that over time there would be enough DVB-T2 receivers sold to switch all DTT transmissions to DVB-T2, and H.264 .  Ofcom published its final decision on 3 April 2008, for HDTV using DVB-T2 and H.264 : 8  BBC HD would have one HD slot after digital switchover (DSO) at Granada. ITV and C4 had, as expected, applied to Ofcom for the 2 additional HD slots available from 2009 to 2012. 9  Ofcom indicated that it found an unused channel covering 3.7 million households in London, which could be used to broadcast the DVB-T2 HD multiplex from 2010, i.e., before DSO in London. Ofcom indicated that they would look for more unused UHF channels in other parts of the UK, that can be used for the DVB-T2 HD multiplex from 2010 until DSO. 10  The DVB-T2 specification    The DVB-T2 draft standard was ratified by the DVB Steering Board on 26 June 2008, 11 and published on the DVB homepage as DVB-T2 standard BlueBook ,. 12 It was handed over to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ( ETSI ) by DVB.ORG on 20 June 2008. 13 The ETSI process resulted in the DVB-T2 standard being adopted on 9 September 2009. 14 The ETSI process had several phases, but the only changes were text clarifications. 15 Since the DVB-T2 physical layer specification was complete, and there would be no further technical enhancements, receiver VLSI chip design started with confidence in stability of specification. A draft PSI/SI (program and system information) specification document was also agreed with the DVB-TM-GBS group.  Tests  Prototype receivers were shown in September IBC 2008 and more recent version at the IBC 2009 in Amsterdam. A number of other manufacturers demonstrated DVB-T2 at IBC 2009 including Albis Technologies, Arqiva, DekTec, Enensys Technologies , Harris, Pace, Rohde & Schwarz , Tandberg, Thomson Broadcast and TeamCast. As of 2012, Appear TV also produce DVB-T2 receivers, DVB-T2 modulators and DVB-T2 gateways. Other manufacturers planning DVB-T2 equipment launches include Alitronika, CellMetric, Cisco, Digital TV Labs, Humax, NXP Semiconductors, Panasonic, ProTelevision Technologies, Screen Service, SIDSA, Sony, ST Microelectronics and T-VIPS. 16 The first test from a real TV transmitter was performed by the BBC Research & Innovation in the last weeks of June 2008 17 using channel 53 from the Guildford transmitter, southwest of London: BBC had developed and built the modulator/demodulator prototype in parallel with the DVB-T2 standard being drafted. Other companies like ENKOM or IfN develop software (processor) based decoding.  NORDIG published a DVB-T2 receiver specification and performance requirement on 1 July 2009. 18 In March 2009 the Digital TV Group (DTG), the industry association for digital TV in the UK, published the technical specification for high definition services on digital terrestrial television (Freeview) using the new DVB-T2 standard. The DTG's test house: DTG Testing are testing Freeview HD products against this specification.  Many tests broadcast transmission using this standard are being in process in France, with local Gap filler near Rennes CCETT. DVB-T2 was tested in October 2010, in Geneva region, with Mont Salève's repeater, in UHF band on Channel 36. A mobile van was testing BER, strength, and quality reception, with special PCs used as spectrum analysers, constellation testers. The van was moving in Canton Geneva (Switzerland), and France (Annemasse, Pays de Gex). However, there was none demonstrated in TELECOM 2011 at Palexpo.  The standard  The following characteristics have been devised for the T2 standard:   COFDM modulation with QPSK , 16- QAM , 64-QAM, or 256-QAM constellations.  OFDM modes are 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, and 32k. The symbol length for 32k mode is about 4 ms.  Guard intervals are 1/128, 1/32, 1/16, 19/256, 1/8, 19/128, and 1/4. (For 32k mode, the maximum is 1/8.)  FEC is concatenated LDPC and BCH codes (as in DVB-S2 and DVB-C2 ), with rates 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, and 5/6.  There are fewer pilots, in 8 different pilot-patterns, and equalization can be based also on the RAI CD3 system. 19  In the 32k mode, a larger part of the standard 8 MHz channel can be used, adding about 2% extra capacity.  DVB-T2 is specified for 1.7, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 MHz channel bandwidth.  MISO (Multiple-Input Single-Output) may be used ( Alamouti scheme), but MIMO will not be used. Diversity receivers can be used (as they are with DVB-T).  Multiple PLP to enable service specific robustness.  Bundling of more channels into a SuperMUX (called TFS) is not in the standard, but may be added later.   System differences with DVB-T  The following table reports a comparison of available modes in DVB-T and DVB-T2. 20       DVB-T   DVB-T2       Input  Interface   Single Transport Stream (TS)   Multiple Transport Stream and Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE)     Modes   Constant Coding & Modulation   Variable Coding & Modulation 21     Forward Error Correction (FEC)   Convolutional Coding + Reed Solomon 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8   LDPC + BCH 1/2, 3/5 , 2/3, 3/4, 4/5 , 5/6     Modulation   OFDM   OFDM     Modulation Schemes   QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM   QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM     Guard Interval   1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32   1/4, 19/128 , 1/8, 19/256 , 1/16, 1/32, 1/128     Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size   2k, 8k   1k , 2k, 4k , 8k, 16k , 32k     Scattered Pilots   8% of total   1% , 2% , 4% , 8% of total     Continual Pilots   2.6% of total   0.35% of total     For instance, a UK MFN DVB-T profile (64-QAM, 8k mode, coding rate 2/3, guard interval 1/32) and a DVB-T2 equivalent (256-QAM, 32k, coding rate 3/5, guard interval 1/128) allows for an increase in bit rate from 24.13 Mbit/s to 35.4 Mbit/s (+46.5%). Another example, for an Italian SFN DVB-T profile (64-QAM, 8k, coding rate 2/3, guard interval 1/4) and a DVB-T2 equivalent (256-QAM, 32k, coding rate 3/5, guard interval 1/16), achieves an increase in bit rate from 19.91 Mbit/s to 33.3 Mbit/s (+67%). 22  Recommended maximum bit-rate configurations for 8 MHz bandwidth, 32K FFT, guard interval 1/128, pilot pattern 7: 23      Modulation   Code rate   Bitrate Mbit/s   Frame length LF   FEC blocks per frame       QPSK   1/2   7.4442731   60   50     3/5   8.9457325     2/3   9.9541201     3/4   11.197922     4/5   11.948651     5/6   12.456553     16-QAM   1/2   15.037432   60   101     3/5   18.07038     2/3   20.107323     3/4   22.619802     4/5   24.136276     5/6   25.162236     64-QAM   1/2   22.481705   60   151     3/5   27.016112     2/3   30.061443     3/4   33.817724     4/5   36.084927     5/6   37.618789     256-QAM   1/2   30.074863   60   202     3/5   36.140759     2/3   40.214645     3/4   45.239604     4/5   48.272552     5/6   50.324472     Technical details  The processing workflow is as follows:   Input pre-processing  Physical Layer Pipe (PLP) creation : adaptation of Transport Stream (TS), Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE), Generic Continuous Stream (GCS), or Generic Fixed-length Packetized Stream (GFPS)   Input processing  Mode adaptation  Single PLP (mode 'A') : data are assembled in groups called BaseBand Frames (BBFRAMEs), with lengths of    K   b  c  h      subscript  K    b  c  h     K_{bch}   bits, defined by modulation and coding (MODCOD) parameters, in a 'normal' length or 'short' length version  Input interface  CRC-8 encoding  BaseBand (BB) header insertion   Multiple PLPs (mode 'B')  Input interface  Input stream synchronization  Delay compensation  Null packets deletion  CRC-8 encoding  BB header insertion    Stream adaptation  Single PLP (mode 'A')  Padding insertion  BB scrambling : a Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) with generator    1  +   x  14   +   x  15       1   superscript  x  14    superscript  x  15     1+x^{14}+x^{15}   is used to scramble completely every BBFRAME   Multiple PLPs (mode 'B')  PLP scheduling  Frame delay  In-band signaling or padding insertion  BB scrambling     Bit Interleaved Coding and Modulation (BICM)  Forward Error Correction (FEC) encoding : each BBFRAME is converted into a FECFRAME of    N   l  d  p  c      subscript  N    l  d  p  c     N_{ldpc}   bits, by adding parity data. Normal FECFRAMEs are 64,800 bits long, whereas short FECFRAMEs are 16,200 bits long. The effective code rates are 32,208/64,800 (1/2), 38,688/64,800 (3/5), 43,040/64,800 (2/3), 48,408/64,800 (3/4), 51,648/64,800 (4/5), 53,840/64,800 (5/6)  Outer encoding : a BCH code , capable to correct 10 or 12 errors per FECFRAME, is used to compute parity data for the information data field. The BCH generator polynomial is of the 160th, 168th, or 192nd grade  Inner encoding : a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code is cascaded to the BCH   Bit interleaving  Parity bits block interleaving  Twist column interleaving   Bit demultiplexing to cell words  Gray mapping of cell words to constellations : either QPSK (4-QAM), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, or 256-QAM maps are used  Constellation rotation and cyclic quadrature (Q) delay : optionally, the constellations may be tilted counterclockwise by an amount of up to 30 degrees. Furthermore, the quadrature (imaginary) part of the cells is cyclically shifted by one cell  Cell interleaving  Time interleaving   Frame building : the transmitted stream is organized in super frames, which are composed by T2 frames and FEF (Future Extension Frame) parts  Cell mapping : cells are mapped to OFDM symbols. A T2 frame is composed by a P1 symbol, one or more P2 symbols, regular data symbols, and a Frame Closing symbol (for certain configuration parameters). The P1 symbol is used for synchronization purposes, the P2 symbols convey L1 parameter configuration signaling, whereas the data symbols carry PLP data (there are three types: common PLPs, type 1 PLPs, and type 2 PLPs), auxiliary streams, and dummy symbols used as space filler  Frequency interleaving : random interleaving is done on every OFDM symbol (except P1)   OFDM generation  Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) processing : Alamouti pre-processing is optionally applied to pairs of OFDM symbol cells. Given    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}   the input cells,    e  i   (  1  )      subscript   superscript  e  1   i    e^{(1)}_{i}   and    e  i   (  2  )      subscript   superscript  e  2   i    e^{(2)}_{i}   transmitter group 1 and 2 cells, the mapping is done as     e  i   (  1  )    =   a  i        subscript   superscript  e  1   i    subscript  a  i     e^{(1)}_{i}=a_{i}   and     e   i  +  1    (  1  )    =   a   i  +  1         subscript   superscript  e  1     i  1     subscript  a    i  1      e^{(1)}_{i+1}=a_{i+1}   for group 1, and as     e  i   (  2  )    =   -   a   i  +  1   *         subscript   superscript  e  2   i      subscript   superscript  a      i  1       e^{(2)}_{i}=-a^{*}_{i+1}   and     e   i  +  1    (  2  )    =   a  i  *        subscript   superscript  e  2     i  1     subscript   superscript  a    i     e^{(2)}_{i+1}=a^{*}_{i}   for group 2  Pilot insertion and dummy tone reservation : three classes of pilot tones are added. They are either continual (fixed position), scattered (cyclically moving position), or edge (boundary positions). There are 8 different configuration for scattered pilots (PP1 ... PP8). Moreover, a number of dummy carriers are not modulated and reserved to reduce the dynamic range of the DVB-T2 output signal (it helps to combat nonlinear phenomena in power amplifiers during broadcast).  Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) : classic IDFT is used to switch from the frequency domain into the time domain, after having adjusted carrier position relevant to the central transmit frequency. 1k (1024) to 32k (32768) carriers are available. There is also an extended mode, which allows to fill more data in the available bandwidth, using more active carriers and reducing the number of guard band (null) carriers.  Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) reduction  Guard interval insertion : a cyclic prefix is inserted before the IDFT symbol, to recover from transmit channel echoes (multipath). Lengths from 1/128 to 1/4 of the IDFT length are allowed.  P1 symbol insertion : the P1 symbol is a particularly crafted 1k OFDM symbol, always inserted at the head of a T2 frame. It conveys few bits of information (spread, scrambled and DBPSK modulated), as it is mainly dedicated to fast synchronization (both in time and in frequency) at the receiver side. It is prepended and postpended by frequency shifted repetitions of itself, to ease receiver lock even if the nominal center frequency of the T2 signal is up to 500 kHz off.  Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC) : the T2 samples are converted into an analog BB complex (I&Q;) signal at a sample rate that depends on the channelization bandwidth. For instance, in 8 MHz wide channels, the complex sample time is 7/64 μs.    Market adoption  When the digital terrestrial HDTV service Freeview HD was launched in December 2009, it was the first DVB-T2 service intended for the general public. As of November 2010, DVB-T2 broadcasts where available in a couple of European countries.  The earliest introductions of T2 have usually been tied with a launch of high-definition television. There are however some countries where HDTV is broadcast using the old DVB-T standard with no immediate plans to switch those broadcasts to DVB-T2. Among countries using DVB-T for nationwide broadcasts of HDTV are France, Ireland, Italy, Norway , Denmark and Spain , though usually with MPEG4. Only Australia is using the earlier DVB-T with MPEG2 for HD.  Countries where DVB-T2 is in use include:   Afghanistan : Four multiplexes, first Kabul test transmissions 1 June 2014.  Albania : One multiplex full launch in July 2011.  Argentina : Launch in February 2014 (Antina - UHF operating DVB-T in Buenos Aires area).  Austria : three multiplexes (D,E,F), full launch in April 2013, 22 transmissions sites  Belgium : Expected to begin in March 2013. 24  Croatia : Two multiplexes launched in late 2012. pay TV platform EVO TV.  Colombia : Adoption starts in 2012 25  Denmark : one multiplex, with TV2 Danmark in HD will launch April 2012. 26  Estonia : one multiplex, soft launch in December 2012 (not all transmitters)  Finland : five multiplexes, soft launch in January 2011, full launch in February 2011  Iceland : Adoption to begin in 2013 and finish by end of 2014 27  Indonesia : Adoption to begin in 2012 and finish by end of 2018 or more (depends on 2018 situation later) 28  Israel : Expected to begin in 2014. 29  Kenya : Multichoice Africa using the GOTV brand launched in September 2011  Middle East : Ten multiplex full launch in 2013.  New Zealand : One multiplex with a full launch in 2012 via the Igloo platfoorm - A joint venture between Sky Television and Television New Zealand 30  Romania : DVB-T2 is the official standard for over-the-air TV broadcasts. Older DVB-T was only used in experimental transmissions in two cities, and will be phased out. The analogue switchoff was made on 2015/06/17, although the complete digital switchover was still in progress at that time. Romania is allocated 5 nation-wide DVB-T2 multiplexes, as well as more than 50 regional/local ones. 31 32  Russia : three multiplexes, soft launch in March 2012.  Serbia : three multiplexes, soft launch in March 2012, full launch in April 2013 is postponed till May 2015. 33 34 35  Sweden : two multiplexes, full launch in November 2010.  Thailand : full launch 1 April 2014. 36  Turkey : Experimental three multiplex. Full launch in 2013. Analog broadcasting will be abolished in 2015.  Ukraine : four DVB-T2 multiplexes × 167 transmission sites, 150 of which have been officially launched on 10 October 2011 37  United Kingdom : Three multiplexes, soft launch in December 2009, full launch in April 2010. An additional DVB-T2 multiplex was launched in Northern Ireland in October 2012, and extra one launched across selected areas of the UK in December 2013.  Vietnam : three multiplexes, launched in 11 November 2011, by the Audio Visual Global JSC.   France announced 38 in May 2014 DVB-T2 tests in Paris for Ultra HD  HEVC broadcast with objectives to replace by 2020 the current DVB-T  MPEG4 national broadcast.  The Southern African Development Community announced in November 2010 that DVB-T2 would be the preferred standard for the region. 39  In Serbia, both SD and HD broadcasts will air in DVB-T2. 40  The Media Development Authority of Singapore announced in June 2012 that the country's free-to-air TV channels will go fully digital by the end of 2013 using DVB-T2. 41  It has been trialled in Spain 42 and Germany. 43 44 Sri Lanka 45 Austria is also expected to use it. 46  Currently Malaysia, which has yet to officially launch its DVB-T transmission, is running tests on DVB-T2. 47 The government has announced that it plans to roll out DVB-T2 in stages starting in Mid-2015, with analog shutoff planned for sometime in 2017.  Broadcasters in the United States are starting experimental trials of DVB-T2 in the Baltimore, MD area on WNUV-TV in the early morning hours as of 15 February 2013. The tests are to determine viability as a broadcast standard for mobile devices and UltraHD. 48  Albania  In July 2011, " DIGITALB " started DVB-T2 broadcasting in Tirana .  Belgium  In April 2013, Teletenne started with DVB-T2 broadcasting in Flanders 49  Colombia  In 2012, Colombia adopted DVB-T2 as the national standard for terrestrial television, replacing DVB-T, the previously selected standard for digital TV, which was selected after technical evaluation of several digital TV standards. The two standards will coexist until 2015. The digital TV has been deployed gradually across the country, starting at the four main cities, Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla followed by other smaller cities as Armenia, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Cúcuta, Manizales, Pereira and Santa Marta by the end of the year. By 2014 many main cities have digital TV, however the signal is not available in the entire country.  First two available signals were emitted by the two private open TV channels RCN TV and Caracol TV . RTVC the national government TV broadcaster started to use the standard by 2013.  The digital system is known in Colombia as TDT which means Televisión digital para todos (Digital Television for everybody). 50 51  Croatia  On 13 October 2011, the Croatian Post and Electronic Communications Agency granted license for MUX C and MUX E, both in DVB-T2 standard. Also in October 2011, OiV - Transmitters & Communications started testing on UHF channel 53 from Sljeme. 52  Two DVB-T2 multiplexes launched in late 2012. by pay TV platform EVO TV.  Indonesia  The project to adopt DVB-T technology in Indonesia was started about 2007 with 'full' government support as the project initiator. All television broadcasters were offered to transform their analog broadcasts into the new digital form, some were interested to follow suit and started testing their new digital broadcasts and some are still uninterested back then.  During the DVB-T testing period, Indonesian government (via its Ministry of Information & Communication Technology [ICT]) wanted to switch to DVB-T2 technology which provides better signal efficiency, capacity and corrections compared to DVB-T. The TV broadcasters still testing their DVB-T broadcasts agreed to join the DVB-T2 conversion program offered by the government since they saw the significant benefits by switching to DVB-T2 (such as higher data rate for HD content and better carrier-to-noise ratio management), even though it would introduce additional cost for those who have bought DVB-T equipment. The official switch to DVB-T2 from DVB-T was started February 2012, based on ICT Minister decree (about 5 years from DVB-T introduction and adopting/nurturing period in Indonesia). 53  The Indonesian Ministry of Information & Communication Technology expects the final DVB-T2 digital television regulation to be finished in 2017 and the analog switch off transition will begin in the same year. 54  Palestine  on 5 January 2015 StarCom company switched to DVB-T2 technology which provided a better signal, reaching most regions of Palestine instead of limited signal covering ( was function only in Gaza Strip while in testing period using DVB-T1 )  Star TV Transponder offers a range of entertainment and sports channels system dvb-t2. Package consists of 10 channels on the UHF ch35  Romania  Although Romania started DVB-T Broadcasting in 2005 with the MPEG-2 standard for SD broadcast and MPEG 4 for HD, it was only experimental. In June 2011 Romania shifted to MPEG4 both for SD and HD. In 2012, the Romanian authorities decided that DVB-T2 will be the standard used for terrestrial broadcasts, as it allows a larger number of programs to be broadcast on the same multiplex. Romania's switchover plans were initially delayed due to economical and feasibility-related reasons. One of the reasons was that most Romanian consumers already extensively used either cable or sattelite services, which developed very quickly and became very popular after 1990. In fact, a technological boom started around 2003, driven by a solid economical development in the field of telecommunications, made several private operators create large networks of fiber optics and cable covering all of Romania, which are now used for providing both TV, telephony, and high quality broadband internet. As the prices for complete packages (TV, internet, telephony) are low and the quality quite good (e.g. about 20 EUR for 500Mbps internet, ~120 SD and HD digital cable TV channels and telephony, with an added 2-4 EUR for mobile telephony), the interest for over-the-air TV quickly became very low. There are rumors that commercial broadcasters that traditionally transmitted over-the-air using analogue channels (like MediaPro , Antena GROUP , Prima TV ) will give up terrestrial broadcasting and will be available only on pay-TV services, like cable, satellite and IPTV . It is also rumored that the DVB-T standard (with MPEG-4 encoding ) will continue until 2018 .  In June 17, 2015 analogue terrestrial television was switched off, with the exception of the main public TV program (TVR1) which will continue to be broadcast strictly in the VHF band until the end of 2016.  Free-to-air DVB-T2 broadcasts on MUX1 (provided by the state-owned Radiocom) are available since June 2015 in Timisoara (UHF channel 21), Cluj-Napoca (UHF channel 26), Iasi (UHF channel 25), and Bucharest (UHF channel 30). 55 The coverage will be extendend so that at the end of 2016, over 90% of the territory will be covered. For now (2015/06/30), only five channels are broadcast on MUX1: TVR1, TVR2, TVR News, TVR 3, and TVR HD, with plans to be extended to 14-16 SD and HD programs. 56 Radiocom's MUX2 and MUX4 implementations will also start in 2016. 57 Legacy DVB-T broadcasts are still available in Bucharest: 6 channels can be received on channels 54 and 59, but will be shut down eventually, being replaced by DVB-T2. TVR announced that TVR News and TVR 3 will be closed , and the fate of TVR HD, is uncertain . This will lower the number of channels available on DVB-T. On 2 July 2015 , Kanal D Romania left the terrestrial platform. The only broadcast that remained on terrestrial except TVR is Antena 3, but it is unknown whether it will stay on DVB-T, will shift to DVB-T2 or completely leave terrestrial platform. This will lead to only 3 channels in DVB-T2, and with many TV sets that are only DVB-T compatible ( most of sold models being equipped with digital cable tuner) to an unattractive terrestrial platform, and mre and more people will subscribe to a cable provider , or a DTH operator in areas where there is no cable TV available.  Russia  In September 2011, Russian governmental authorities have approved the decision 58 that since this date all newly built terrestrial digital TV networks will use the DVB-T2 standard. In some regions of Russia DVB-T/MPEG-4 networks (mostly consisting of one multiplex) have already been deployed before this decision was made.

Turkey  Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) is testing TRT HD in Ankara -Dikmen UHF channel 31.  Ukraine  Ukraine's national terrestrial TV network (built and maintained by the Zeonbud company) uses the DVB-T2 standard for all four nationwide FTV (cardless CAS "Irdeto Cloaked CA") multiplexes, for both SD and HD broadcasts. Before settling for DVB-T2, Ukraine was testing both DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T/MPEG-4 options, and some experimental transmitters operating in those standards are still live. Ukraine has never had a full-fledged nationwide DVB-T network, thus not having to do a DVB-T-to-DVB-T2 migration.  Zeonbud's network consists of 167 transmitter sites, each carrying four DVB-T2 multiplexes, with transmitter power ranging from 2 kW to 50 W (all in MFN mode). As of 2011 October 10, 150 of the 167 transmitter sites have officially gone live. The biggest problem of Ukraine's DVB-T2 rollout for now is the acute shortage of inexpensive DVB-T2 set-top-boxes.  The four multiplexes carry in total 28 nationwide channels (same for all transmitter sites, distributed via satellite) and 4 local channels. Up to 8 of those 28 nationwide channels can broadcast in HD format.  , there were 12 channels available on the air in Kyiv; up from 4 channels in 2012 October.  United Kingdom  On the terrestrial television system in most of the UK, there is only one multiplex (the slot corresponding to one channel in analog broadcasting and to many channels in digital broadcasting) assigned to digital broadcasting in the DVB-T2 standard. This multiplex is controlled by the service company Freeview HD , which has offered to host up to five DVB-T2 HD channels on it. 78  Freeview HD started its "technical launch" on 2 December 2009, hosting BBC HD , and ITV HD . 79 On 30 March 2010, Freeview HD had its official launch, and added Channel 4 HD to its broadcasts. 80 81 The fourth channel hosted is BBC One HD , while the 5th slot is used for a high-definition simulcast of CBBC during the daytime and a high-definition simulcast of BBC Three during the evening.  The 5th HD stream on the DVB-T2 multiplex was going to be used by Channel 5 for their HD service, but they withdrew their application to Ofcom for the slot in December 2011. 82  In June 2012, the BBC launched a temporary stream in order to broadcast a high-definition red button service for the 2012 Olympics on Freeview, alongside BBC One HD and BBC HD. 83 At the time, it was still undecided as to the permanent use of the 5th stream after the Olympics.  In Northern Ireland however, a second DVB-T2 multiplex was launched on 24 October 2012. This multiplex carries RTÉ One , RTÉ Two and TG4 . All three channels on this multiplex are carried in SD rather than HD.  On 16 March 2013, the BBC announced that it will launch BBC News HD, BBC Three HD, BBC Four HD, CBeebies HD and CBBC HD on all digital television platforms which carry HD channels. On Freeview HD (and YouView), BBC Three HD and CBBC HD will use capacity on the BBC’s existing HD multiplex covering 98.5% of UK homes; BBC News HD, BBC Four HD and CBeebies HD will use new HD capacity which will cover part of the UK and grow in coverage over time. 84 These high-definition simulcasts are available on the second multiplex, but the second multiplex is only broadcast from selected transmitters, providing around 70% coverage across the whole of the UK.  On 26 March 2013, BBC HD was replaced by BBC Two HD. 85  Vietnam  As of 11 November 2011, two DVB-T2 SFN networks of the Audio Visual Global JSC have been officially launched in both Hanoi and HoChiMinh city.
