Bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase




Bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase

In enzymology, a bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate + H2O 
 
 
 
  3-phospho-D-glycerate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate and H2O, whereas its two products are 3-phospho-D-glycerate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate 2-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include 2,3-diphosphoglycerate phosphatase, diphosphoglycerate phosphatase, 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid phosphatase, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase, and glycerate-2,3-diphosphate phosphatase. This enzyme participates in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.
