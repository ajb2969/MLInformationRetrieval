   Effective radius      Effective radius   The effective radius (    R  e     subscript  R  e    R_{e}   ) of a galaxy is the radius at which half of the total light of the system is emitted. 1 2 This assumes the galaxy has either intrinsic spherical symmetry or is at least circularly symmetric as viewed in the plane of the sky. Alternatively, a half-light contour , or isophote , may be used for spherically and circularly asymmetric objects.      R  e     subscript  R  e    R_{e}   is an important length scale in de Vaucouleurs     R  4       4   R    \sqrt[4]{R}    law , which characterizes a specific rate at which surface brightness decreases as a function of radius:       I   (  R  )    =    I  e   ⋅   e   -   7.67   (     R   R  e    4   -  1   )             I  R    normal-⋅   subscript  I  e    superscript  e      7.67       4     R   subscript  R  e     1         I(R)=I_{e}\cdot e^{-7.67\left(\sqrt[4]{\frac{R}{R_{e}}}-1\right)}     where    I  e     subscript  I  e    I_{e}   is the surface brightness at    R  =   R  e       R   subscript  R  e     R=R_{e}   . Note that at    R  =  0      R  0    R=0   ,      I   (  R  =  0  )   =   I  e   ⋅   e  7.67   ≈  2000  ⋅   I  e      fragments  I   fragments  normal-(  R   0  normal-)     subscript  I  e   normal-⋅   superscript  e  7.67    2000  normal-⋅   subscript  I  e     I(R=0)=I_{e}\cdot e^{7.67}\approx 2000\cdot I_{e}     Thus, the central surface brightness is approximately    2000  ⋅   I  e      normal-⋅  2000   subscript  I  e     2000\cdot I_{e}   .
