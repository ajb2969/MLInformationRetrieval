Bott–Samelson resolution

In algebraic geometry, the Bott–Samelson resolution of a Schubert variety is a resolution of singularities. It was introduced by  in the context of compact Lie groups.1 The algebraic formulation is due to  and .
Definition
Let G be a connected reductive complex algebraic group, B a Borel subgroup and T a maximal torus contained in B.
Let 
 
 
 
  Any such w can be written as a product of reflections by simple roots. Fix minimal such an expression:


 
  so that 
 
 
 
 . (l is the length of w.) Let 
 
 
 
  be the subgroup generated by B and a representative of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the quotient:


 
  with respect to the action of 
 
 
 
  by


 
 . It is a smooth projective variety. Writing 
 
 
 
  for the Schubert variety for w, the multiplication map


 
  is a resolution of singularities called the Bott–Samelson resolution. 
 
 
 
  has the property
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  In other words, 
 
 
 
  has rational singularities.2
There are also some other constructions; see, for example, .
