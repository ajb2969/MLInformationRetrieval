Decaprenyl-phosphate phosphoribosyltransferase

Decaprenyl-phosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (, 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose-1-diphosphate:decaprenyl-phosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase, 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-pyrophosphate:decaprenyl phosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase, DPPR synthase, Rv3806) is an enzyme with system name trans,octacis-decaprenylphospho-beta-D-ribofuranose 5-phosphate:diphosphate phospho-alpha-D-ribosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

trans,octacis-decaprenyl phosphate + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate 
 
 
 
  trans,octacis-decaprenylphospho-beta-D-ribofuranose 5-phosphate + diphosphate


This enzyme requires Mg2+. It is isolated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
