  |- !Orthogonal projections in A4 Coxeter plane |} In four-dimensional geometry, a runcinated 5-cell is a convex uniform 4-polytope, being a runcination (a 3rd order truncation) of the regular 5-cell.
There are 3 unique degrees of runcinations of the 5-cell, including with permutations, truncations, and cantellations.

The runcinated 5-cell or small prismatodecachoron is constructed by expanding the cells of a 5-cell radially and filling in the gaps with triangular prisms (which are the face prisms and edge figures) and tetrahedra (cells of the dual 5-cell). It consists of 10 tetrahedra and 20 triangular prisms. The 10 tetrahedra correspond with the cells of a 5-cell and its dual.

Structure
Two of the ten tetrahedral cells meet at each vertex. The triangular prisms lie between them, joined to them by their triangular faces and to each other by their square faces. Each triangular prism is joined to its neighbouring triangular prisms in anti orientation (i.e., if edges A and B in the shared square face are joined to the triangular faces of one prism, then it is the other two edges that are joined to the triangular faces of the other prism); thus each pair of adjacent prisms, if rotated into the same hyperplane, would form a gyrobifastigium.
Dissection
The runcinated 5-cell can be dissected by a central cuboctahedron into two tetrahedral cupola. This dissection is analogous to the 3D cuboctahedron being dissected by a central hexagon into two triangular cupola.

Coordinates
The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of an origin-centered runcinated 5-cell with edge length 2 are:





























An alternate simpler set of coordinates can be made in 5-space, as 20 permutations of:

(0,1,1,1,2)
 

This construction exists as one of 32 orthant facets of the runcinated 5-orthoplex.
A second construction in 5-space, from the center of a rectified 5-orthoplex is given by coordinate permutations of:

(1,-1,0,0,0)
 

Root vectors
Its 20 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group A4. It is also the vertex figure for the 5-cell honeycomb in 4-space.
Cross-sections
The maximal cross-section of the runcinated 5-cell with a 3-dimensional hyperplane is a cuboctahedron. This cross-section divides the runcinated 5-cell into two tetrahedral hypercupolae consisting of 5 tetrahedra and 10 triangular prisms each.
Projections
The tetrahedron-first orthographic projection of the runcinated 5-cell into 3-dimensional space has a cuboctahedral envelope. The structure of this projection is as follows:

The cuboctahedral envelope is divided internally as follows:

:* Four flattened tetrahedra join 4 of the triangular faces of the cuboctahedron to a central tetrahedron. These are the images of 5 of the tetrahedral cells.
:* The 6 square faces of the cuboctahedron are joined to the edges of the central tetrahedron via distorted triangular prisms. These are the images of 6 of the triangular prism cells.
:* The other 4 triangular faces are joined to the central tetrahedron via 4 triangular prisms (distorted by projection). These are the images of another 4 of the triangular prism cells.
:* This accounts for half of the runcinated 5-cell (5 tetrahedra and 10 triangular prisms), which may be thought of as the 'northern hemisphere'.

The other half, the 'southern hemisphere', corresponds to an isomorphic division of the cuboctahedron in dual orientation, in which the central tetrahedron is dual to the one in the first half. The triangular faces of the cuboctahedron join the triangular prisms in one hemisphere to the flattened tetrahedra in the other hemisphere, and vice versa. Thus, the southern hemisphere contains another 5 tetrahedra and another 10 triangular prisms, making the total of 10 tetrahedra and 20 triangular prisms.

Related skew polyhedron
The regular skew polyhedron, {4,6|3}, exists in 4-space with 6 squares around each vertex, in a zig-zagging nonplanar vertex figure. These square faces can be seen on the runcinated 5-cell, using all 60 edges and 20 vertices. The 40 triangular faces of the runcinated 5-cell can be seen as removed. The dual regular skew polyhedron, {6,4|3}, is similarly related to the hexagonal faces of the bitruncated 5-cell.

 The runcitruncated 5-cell or prismatorhombated pentachoron is composed of 60 vertices, 150 edges, 120 faces, and 30 cells. The cells are: 5 truncated tetrahedra, 10 hexagonal prisms, 10 triangular prisms, and 5 cuboctahedra. Each vertex is surrounded by five cells: one truncated tetrahedron, two hexagonal prisms, one triangular prism, and one cuboctahedron; the vertex figure is a rectangular pyramid.

The omnitruncated 5-cell or great prismatodecachoron is composed of 120 vertices, 240 edges, 150 faces (90 squares and 60 hexagons), and 30 cells. The cells are: 10 truncated octahedra, and 20 hexagonal prisms. Each vertex is surrounded by four cells: two truncated octahedra, and two hexagonal prisms, arranged in two chiral irregular tetrahedral vertex figures.
Coxeter calls this Hinton's polytope after C. H. Hinton, who described it in his book The Fourth Dimension in 1906. It forms a uniform honeycomb which Coxeter calls Hinton's honeycomb.1

Permutohedron
Just as the truncated octahedron is the permutohedron of order 4, the omnitruncated 5-cell is the permutohedron of order 5.2 The omnitruncated 5-cell is a zonotope, the Minkowski sum of five line segments parallel to the five lines through the origin and the five vertices of the 5-cell. 
Tessellations
The omnitruncated 5-cell honeycomb can tessellate 4-dimensional space by translational copies of this cell, each with 3 hypercells around each face. This honeycomb's Coxeter diagram is .3 Unlike the analogous honeycomb in three dimensions, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb which has three different Coxeter group Wythoff constructions, this honeycomb has only one such construction.4
Symmetry
The omnitruncated 5-cell has extended pentachoric symmetry, [[3,3,3]], order 240. The vertex figure of the omnitruncated 5-cell represents the Goursat tetrahedron of the [3,3,3] Coxeter group. The extended symmetry comes from a 2-fold rotation across the middle order-3 branch, and is represented more explicitly as [2+[3,3,3]].

These vertices can be more simply obtained in 5-space as the 120 permutations of (0,1,2,3,4). This construction is from the positive orthant facet of the runcicantitruncated 5-orthoplex, t0,1,2,3{3,3,3,4}, .
Full snub 5-cell
 The full snub 5-cell or omnisnub 5-cell, defined as an alternation of the omnitruncated 5-cell, can not be made uniform, but it can be given Coxeter diagram , and symmetry [[3,3,3]]+, order 120, and constructed from 90 cells: 10 icosahedrons, 20 octahedrons, and 60 tetrahedrons filling the gaps at the deleted vertices. It has 300 faces (triangles), 270 edges, and 60 vertices.5
Related polytopes
These polytopes are a part of a family of 9 Uniform 4-polytope constructed from the [3,3,3] Coxeter group.
