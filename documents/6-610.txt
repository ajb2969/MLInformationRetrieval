It consists of 10 tetrahedra and 20 triangular prisms. The 10 tetrahedra correspond with the cells of a 5-cell and its dual.  Alternative names   Runcinated 5-cell ( Norman Johnson )  Runcinated pentachoron  Runcinated 4-simplex  Expanded 5-cell/4-simplex/pentachoron  Small prismatodecachoron (Acronym: Spid) (Jonathan Bowers)   Structure  Two of the ten tetrahedral cells meet at each vertex. The triangular prisms lie between them, joined to them by their triangular faces and to each other by their square faces. Each triangular prism is joined to its neighbouring triangular prisms in anti orientation (i.e., if edges A and B in the shared square face are joined to the triangular faces of one prism, then it is the other two edges that are joined to the triangular faces of the other prism); thus each pair of adjacent prisms, if rotated into the same hyperplane , would form a gyrobifastigium .  Dissection  The runcinated 5-cell can be dissected by a central cuboctahedron into two tetrahedral cupola . This dissection is analogous to the 3D cuboctahedron being dissected by a central hexagon into two triangular cupola .

A second construction in 5-space, from the center of a rectified 5-orthoplex is given by coordinate permutations of:   (1,-1,0,0,0)   Root vectors  Its 20 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group A 4 . It is also the vertex figure for the 5-cell honeycomb in 4-space.  Cross-sections  The maximal cross-section of the runcinated 5-cell with a 3-dimensional hyperplane is a cuboctahedron . This cross-section divides the runcinated 5-cell into two tetrahedral hypercupolae consisting of 5 tetrahedra and 10 triangular prisms each.  Projections  The tetrahedron-first orthographic projection of the runcinated 5-cell into 3-dimensional space has a cuboctahedral envelope. The structure of this projection is as follows:   The cuboctahedral envelope is divided internally as follows:   :* Four flattened tetrahedra join 4 of the triangular faces of the cuboctahedron to a central tetrahedron. These are the images of 5 of the tetrahedral cells.  :* The 6 square faces of the cuboctahedron are joined to the edges of the central tetrahedron via distorted triangular prisms. These are the images of 6 of the triangular prism cells.  :* The other 4 triangular faces are joined to the central tetrahedron via 4 triangular prisms (distorted by projection). These are the images of another 4 of the triangular prism cells.  :* This accounts for half of the runcinated 5-cell (5 tetrahedra and 10 triangular prisms), which may be thought of as the 'northern hemisphere'.   The other half, the 'southern hemisphere', corresponds to an isomorphic division of the cuboctahedron in dual orientation, in which the central tetrahedron is dual to the one in the first half. The triangular faces of the cuboctahedron join the triangular prisms in one hemisphere to the flattened tetrahedra in the other hemisphere, and vice versa. Thus, the southern hemisphere contains another 5 tetrahedra and another 10 triangular prisms, making the total of 10 tetrahedra and 20 triangular prisms.   Related skew polyhedron  The regular skew polyhedron , {4,6|3}, exists in 4-space with 6 squares around each vertex, in a zig-zagging nonplanar vertex figure. These square faces can be seen on the runcinated 5-cell, using all 60 edges and 20 vertices. The 40 triangular faces of the runcinated 5-cell can be seen as removed. The dual regular skew polyhedron, {6,4|3}, is similarly related to the hexagonal faces of the bitruncated 5-cell .

The vertex figure of the omnitruncated 5-cell represents the Goursat tetrahedron of the [3,3,3] Coxeter group . The extended symmetry comes from a 2-fold rotation across the middle order-3 branch, and is represented more explicitly as [2 + [3,3,3]].      Coordinates  The Cartesian coordinates of the vertices of an origin-centered omnitruncated 5-cell having edge length 2 are:          (   ±   10    ,   ±   6    ,   ±   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus    10     plus-or-minus    6     plus-or-minus    3     plus-or-minus  1     \left(\pm\sqrt{10},\ \pm\sqrt{6},\ \pm\sqrt{3},\ \pm 1\right)         (   ±   10    ,   ±   6    ,  0  ,   ±  2   )      plus-or-minus    10     plus-or-minus    6    0   plus-or-minus  2     \left(\pm\sqrt{10},\ \pm\sqrt{6},\ 0,\ \pm 2\right)         ±   (   ±   10    ,    2  3    ,   5   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus    plus-or-minus    10        2  3      5    3     plus-or-minus  1      \pm\left(\pm\sqrt{10},\ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 1\right)         ±   (   ±   10    ,    2  3    ,    -  1    3    ,   ±  3   )      plus-or-minus    plus-or-minus    10        2  3        1     3     plus-or-minus  3      \pm\left(\pm\sqrt{10},\ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 3\right)         ±   (   ±   10    ,    2  3    ,    -  4    3    ,   ±  2   )      plus-or-minus    plus-or-minus    10        2  3        4     3     plus-or-minus  2      \pm\left(\pm\sqrt{10},\ \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{-4}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 2\right)         (   ±    5  2     ,   3    3  2     ,   ±   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus      5  2       3      3  2      plus-or-minus    3     plus-or-minus  1     \left(\pm\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ 3\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},\ \pm\sqrt{3},\ \pm 1\right)         (   ±    5  2     ,   3    3  2     ,  0  ,   ±  2   )      plus-or-minus      5  2       3      3  2     0   plus-or-minus  2     \left(\pm\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ 3\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},\ 0,\ \pm 2\right)          ±   (    5  2    ,   1   6    ,   7   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus       5  2      1    6      7    3     plus-or-minus  1      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\ \frac{7}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 1\right)         ±   (    5  2    ,   1   6    ,    -  2    3    ,   ±  4   )      plus-or-minus       5  2      1    6        2     3     plus-or-minus  4      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\ \frac{-2}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 4\right)         ±   (    5  2    ,   1   6    ,    -  5    3    ,   ±  3   )      plus-or-minus       5  2      1    6        5     3     plus-or-minus  3      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}},\ \frac{-5}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 3\right)         ±   (    5  2    ,   -    3  2     ,   ±   2   3     ,   ±  2   )      plus-or-minus       5  2          3  2      plus-or-minus    2    3      plus-or-minus  2      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},\ \pm 2\sqrt{3},\ \pm 2\right)         ±   (    5  2    ,   -    3  2     ,  0  ,   ±  4   )      plus-or-minus       5  2          3  2     0   plus-or-minus  4      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},\ 0,\ \pm 4\right)         ±   (    5  2    ,    -  7    6    ,   5   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus       5  2        7     6      5    3     plus-or-minus  1      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ \frac{-7}{\sqrt{6}},\ \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 1\right)         ±   (    5  2    ,    -  7    6    ,    -  1    3    ,   ±  3   )      plus-or-minus       5  2        7     6        1     3     plus-or-minus  3      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ \frac{-7}{\sqrt{6}},\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 3\right)          ±   (    5  2    ,    -  7    6    ,    -  4    3    ,   ±  2   )      plus-or-minus       5  2        7     6        4     3     plus-or-minus  2      \pm\left(\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}},\ \frac{-7}{\sqrt{6}},\ \frac{-4}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 2\right)         ±   (  0  ,   4    2  3     ,   5   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus   0    4      2  3       5    3     plus-or-minus  1      \pm\left(0,\ 4\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 1\right)         ±   (  0  ,   4    2  3     ,    -  1    3    ,   ±  3   )      plus-or-minus   0    4      2  3         1     3     plus-or-minus  3      \pm\left(0,\ 4\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 3\right)         ±   (  0  ,   4    2  3     ,    -  4    3    ,   ±  2   )      plus-or-minus   0    4      2  3         4     3     plus-or-minus  2      \pm\left(0,\ 4\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{-4}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 2\right)         ±   (  0  ,   2    2  3     ,   7   3    ,   ±  1   )      plus-or-minus   0    2      2  3       7    3     plus-or-minus  1      \pm\left(0,\ 2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{7}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 1\right)         ±   (  0  ,   2    2  3     ,    -  2    3    ,   ±  4   )      plus-or-minus   0    2      2  3         2     3     plus-or-minus  4      \pm\left(0,\ 2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{-2}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 4\right)         ±   (  0  ,   2    2  3     ,    -  5    3    ,   ±  3   )      plus-or-minus   0    2      2  3         5     3     plus-or-minus  3      \pm\left(0,\ 2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}},\ \frac{-5}{\sqrt{3}},\ \pm 3\right)        These vertices can be more simply obtained in 5-space as the 120 permutations of (0,1,2,3,4).

Full snub 5-cell  The full snub 5-cell or omnisnub 5-cell , defined as an alternation of the omnitruncated 5-cell, can not be made uniform, but it can be given Coxeter diagram , and symmetry [ [3,3,3]] + , order 120, and constructed from 90 cells: 10 icosahedrons , 20 octahedrons , and 60 tetrahedrons filling the gaps at the deleted vertices. It has 300 faces (triangles), 270 edges, and 60 vertices. 5  Related polytopes  These polytopes are a part of a family of 9 Uniform 4-polytope constructed from the [3,3,3] Coxeter group .
