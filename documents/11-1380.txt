Trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase




Trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase

In enzymology, a trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate + phosphate 
 
 
 
  glucose 6-phosphate + beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha,alpha'-trehalose 6-phosphate and phosphate, whereas its two products are glucose 6-phosphate and beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase. This enzyme is also called trehalose 6-phosphate:phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase.
