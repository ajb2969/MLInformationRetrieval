Proof of Bertrand's postulate

In mathematics, Bertrand's postulate (actually a theorem) states that for each 
 
 
 
  there is a prime

 
  such that 
 
 
 
  that enters into the prime decomposition of the central binomial coefficient 
 
 
 
  is at most 
 
 
 
 . In particular, every prime larger than 
 
 
 
  can enter at most once into this decomposition; that is, its exponent 
 
 
 
  is at most one. The next step is to prove that 
 
 
 
  has no prime factors at all in the gap interval 
 
 
 
 . As a consequence of these two bounds, the contribution to the size of 
 
 
 
  coming from all the prime factors that are at most 
 
 
grows asymptotically as 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . Since the asymptotic growth of the central binomial coefficient is at least 
 
 
 
 , one concludes that for 
 
 
 
  large enough the binomial coefficient must have another prime factor, which can only lie between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, making these estimates quantitative, one obtains that this argument is valid for all 
 
 
 
 . The remaining smaller values of 
 
 
 
  are easily settled by direct inspection, completing the proof of Bertrand's postulate.
Lemmas and computation
Lemma 1: A lower bound on the central binomial coefficients
Lemma: For any integer 
 
 
 
 , we have



Proof: Applying the binomial theorem,


 
  since 
 
 
 
  is the largest term in the sum in the right-hand side, and the sum has 
 
 
 
  terms (including the initial two outside the summation).
Lemma 2: An upper bound on prime powers dividing central binomial coefficients
For a fixed prime 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
  to be the largest natural number 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
 .
Lemma: For any prime 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Proof: The exponent of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is (see Factorial#Number theory):


 
  so


 
  But each term of the last summation can either be zero (if 
 
 
 
 ) or 1 (if 
 
 
 
 ) and all terms with 
 
 
 
  are zero. Therefore


 
  and


 
  This completes the proof of the lemma.
Lemma 3: The exact power of a large prime in a central binomial coefficient
Lemma: If 
 
 
 
  is odd and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

Proof: There are exactly two factors of 
 
 
 
  in the numerator of the expression 
 
 
 
 , coming from the two terms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , and also two factors of 
 
 
 
  in the denominator from two copies of the term 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . These factors all cancel, leaving no factors of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . (The bound on 
 
 
 
  in the preconditions of the lemma ensures that 
 
 
 
  is too large to be a term of the numerator, and the assumption that 
 
 
 
  is odd is needed to ensure that 
 
 
 
  contributes only one factor of 
 
 
 
  to the numerator.)
Lemma 4: An upper bound on the primorial
We estimate the primorial function,


 
  where the product is taken over all prime numbers 
 
 
 
  less than or equal to the real number 
 
 
 
 .
Lemma: For all real numbers 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
1
Proof: Since 
 
 
 
 , it suffices to prove the result under the assumption that 
 
 
 
  is an integer. Since 
 
 
 
  is an integer and all the primes 
 
 
 
  appear in its numerator, 
 
 
 
  must hold. The proof proceeds by mathematical induction.









If 
 
 
 
  odd, 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  even, 
 
 





Thus the lemma is proven.
Proof of Bertrand's Postulate
Assume there is a counterexample: an integer n ≥ 2 such that there is no prime p with n \textstyle\binom{2n}{n} such that:

2n < p, because every factor must divide (2n)!;
p = 2n, because 2n is not prime;
n < p < 2n, because we assumed there is no such prime number;
2n / 3 < p ≤ n: by Lemma 3.

Therefore, every prime factor p satisfies p ≤ 2n/3.
When 
 
 
 
  the number 
 
 
 
  has at most one factor of p. By Lemma 2, for any prime p we have pR(p,n) ≤ 2n, so the product of the pR(p,n) over the primes less than or equal to 
 
 
 
  is at most 
 
 
 
 . Then, starting with Lemma 1 and decomposing the right-hand side into its prime factorization, and finally using Lemma 4, these bounds give:


 
  Taking logarithms yields to


 
  By concavity of the right-hand side as a function of n, the last inequality is necessarily verified on an interval. Since it holds true for n=467 and it does not for n=468, we obtain


 
  But these cases have already been settled, and we conclude that no counterexample to the postulate is possible.
Proof by Shigenori Tochiori
Using Lemma 4, Tochiori refined Erdos's method and proved if there exists a positive integer 
 
 
 
  such that there is no prime number 
 
 
 
 . 2
First, refine lemma 1 to:
Lemma 1': For any integer 
 
 
 
 , we have



Proof: By induction: 
 
 
 
  and assuming the truth of the lemma for 
 
 
 
 ,



Then, refine the estimate of the product of all small primes via a better estimate on 
 
 
 
  (the number of primes at most 
 
 
 
 ):
Lemma 5: For any natural number 
 
 
 
 , we have



Proof: Except for 
 
 
 
 
 , every prime number has 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is upper bounded by the number of numbers with 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
 , plus one (since this counts 
 
 
 
  and misses 
 
 
 
 ). Thus



Now, calculating the binomial coefficient as in the previous section, we can use the improved bounds to get (for 
 
 
 
 , which implies 
 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 ):


 
  Taking logarithms to get


 
  and dividing both sides by 
 
 
 
 
 :



Now the function 
 
 
 
  is decreasing for 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
  is decreasing when 
 
 
 
 
 . But
$$\frac{f(2^6)}{\log 2}=\sqrt{2}\cdot\frac{3}{8}+\frac94\cdot\frac{5}{32}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{16}=0.97\dots<1<\frac{f(n)}{\log 2},$$
so $n<2^6=64$. The remaining cases are proven by an explicit list of primes, as above.
