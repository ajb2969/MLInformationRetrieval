   Aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase      Aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-aminobutanal + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-aminobutanoate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-aminobutanal , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-aminobutanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-aminobutanal:NAD+ 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ambiguous) , ABAL dehydrogenase , 4-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase , 4-aminobutanal dehydrogenase , gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydroganase , 1-pyrroline dehydrogenase , ABALDH , and YdcW . This enzyme participates in the urea cycle and the metabolism of amino groups and beta-alanine .  References    Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
