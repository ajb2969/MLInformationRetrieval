Inositol 3-kinase

In enzymology, an inositol 3-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + myo-inositol 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and myo-inositol, whereas its two products are ADP and 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:myo-inositol 1-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include inositol-1-kinase (phosphorylating), myoinositol kinase, and myo-inositol 1-kinase. This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism.
