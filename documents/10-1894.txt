   N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase      N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase   In enzymology , a N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-sulfo-D-glucosamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucosamine + sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-sulfo-D-glucosamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glucosamine and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on sulfur-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-sulfo-D-glucosamine sulfohydrolase . Other names in common use include sulfoglucosamine sulfamidase , heparin sulfamidase , 2-desoxy-D-glucoside-2-sulphamate sulphohydrolase (sulphamate , and sulphohydrolase) . This enzyme participates in glycosaminoglycan degradation and glycan structures - degradation .
