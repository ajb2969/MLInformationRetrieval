   Omega-hydroxypalmitate O-feruloyl transferase      Omega-hydroxypalmitate O-feruloyl transferase   Omega-hydroxypalmitate O-feruloyl transferase (, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA omega-hydroxypalmitic acid O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase , HHT ) is an enzyme with system name feruloyl-CoA:16-hydroxypalmitate feruloyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   feruloyl-CoA + 16-hydroxypalmitate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 16-feruloyloxypalmitate   p-Coumaroyl-CoA and sinapoyl-CoA also act as substrates .
