Focaloid

 In geometry, a focaloid is a shell bounded by two concentric, confocal ellipses (in 2D) or ellipsoids (in 3D). When the thickness of the shell becomes negligible, it is called a thin focaloid.
Mathematical definition (3D)
If one boundary surface is given by



with semiaxes a, b, c the second surface is given by



The thin focaloid is then given by the limit 
 
 
 
 .
In general, a focaloid could be understood as a shell consisting out of two closed coordinate surfaces of a confocal ellipsoidal coordinate system.
Confocal
Confocal ellipsoids share the same foci, which are given for the example above by









Physical meaning
A focaloid can be used as a construction element of a matter or charge distribution. The particular importance of focaloids lies in the fact that two different but confocal focaloids of the same mass or charge produce the same action on a test mass or charge in the exterior region.
