   Hypoelliptic operator      Hypoelliptic operator   In mathematics , more specifically in the theory of partial differential equations , a partial differential operator    P   P   P   defined on an open subset      U  ⊂   ℝ  n       U   superscript  ℝ  n     U\subset{\mathbb{R}}^{n}     is called hypoelliptic if for every distribution    u   u   u   defined on an open subset    V  ⊂  U      V  U    V\subset U   such that    P  u      P  u    Pu   is    C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}   ( smooth ),   u   u   u   must also be    C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}   .  If this assertion holds with    C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}   replaced by real analytic , then   P   P   P   is said to be analytically hypoelliptic .  Every elliptic operator with    C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}   coefficients is hypoelliptic. In particular, the Laplacian is an example of a hypoelliptic operator (the Laplacian is also analytically hypoelliptic). The heat equation operator       P   (  u  )    =    u  t   -   k  Δ   u           P  u      subscript  u  t     k  normal-Δ  u      P(u)=u_{t}-k\Delta u\,     (where    k  >  0      k  0    k>0   ) is hypoelliptic but not elliptic. The wave equation operator       P   (  u  )    =    u   t  t    -    c  2   Δ   u           P  u      subscript  u    t  t       superscript  c  2   normal-Δ  u      P(u)=u_{tt}-c^{2}\Delta u\,     (where    c  ≠  0      c  0    c\neq 0   ) is not hypoelliptic.
