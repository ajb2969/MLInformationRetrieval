Hypoelliptic operator

In mathematics, more specifically in the theory of partial differential equations, a partial differential operator

 
  defined on an open subset



is called hypoelliptic if for every distribution

 
  defined on an open subset 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  (smooth), 
 
 
 
  must also be 
 
 
 
 .
If this assertion holds with 
 
 
 
  replaced by real analytic, then 
 
 
 
  is said to be analytically hypoelliptic.
Every elliptic operator with 
 
 
 
  coefficients is hypoelliptic. In particular, the Laplacian is an example of a hypoelliptic operator (the Laplacian is also analytically hypoelliptic). The heat equation operator



(where 
 
 
 
 ) is hypoelliptic but not elliptic. The wave equation operator



(where 
 
 
 
 ) is not hypoelliptic.
