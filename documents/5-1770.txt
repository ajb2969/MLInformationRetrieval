   Brinkmann coordinates      Brinkmann coordinates   Brinkmann coordinates (named for Hans Brinkmann) are a particular coordinate system for a spacetime belonging to the family of pp-wave metrics . In terms of these coordinates, the metric tensor can be written as       d    s  2     =    H   (  u  ,  x  ,  y  )   d   u  2    +   2  d  u  d  v   +   d   x  2    +   d   y  2           d   superscript  s  2        H   u  x  y   d   superscript  u  2      2  d  u  d  v     d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2       ds^{2}\,=H(u,x,y)du^{2}+2dudv+dx^{2}+dy^{2}     where    ∂  v     subscript   v    \partial_{v}   , the coordinate vector field dual to the covector field    d  v      d  v    dv   , is a null vector field. Indeed, geometrically speaking, it is a null geodesic congruence with vanishing optical scalars . Physically speaking, it serves as the wave vector defining the direction of propagation for the pp-wave.  The coordinate vector field    ∂  u     subscript   u    \partial_{u}   can be spacelike, null, or timelike at a given event in the spacetime , depending upon the sign of    H   (  u  ,  x  ,  y  )       H   u  x  y     H(u,x,y)   at that event. The coordinate vector fields     ∂  x   ,   ∂  y       subscript   x    subscript   y     \partial_{x},\partial_{y}   are both spacelike vector fields. Each surface     u  =   u  0    ,   v  =   v  0       formulae-sequence    u   subscript  u  0      v   subscript  v  0      u=u_{0},v=v_{0}   can be thought of as a wavefront .  In discussions of exact solutions to the Einstein field equation , many authors fail to specify the intended range of the coordinate  variables     u  ,  v  ,  x  ,  y     u  v  x  y    u,v,x,y   . Here we should take        -  ∞   <   v  ,  x    ,    y  <  ∞   ,    u  0   <  u  <   u  1        formulae-sequence         v  x     formulae-sequence    y         subscript  u  0   u        subscript  u  1        -\infty     to allow for the possibility that the pp-wave develops a null curvature singularity .
