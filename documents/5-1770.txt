Brinkmann coordinates

Brinkmann coordinates (named for Hans Brinkmann) are a particular coordinate system for a spacetime belonging to the family of pp-wave metrics. In terms of these coordinates, the metric tensor can be written as



where 
 
 
 
 , the coordinate vector field dual to the covector field 
 
 
 
 , is a null vector field. Indeed, geometrically speaking, it is a null geodesic congruence with vanishing optical scalars. Physically speaking, it serves as the wave vector defining the direction of propagation for the pp-wave.
The coordinate vector field 
 
 
 
  can be spacelike, null, or timelike at a given event in the spacetime, depending upon the sign of 
 
 
 
  at that event. The coordinate vector fields 
 
 
 
  are both spacelike vector fields. Each surface 
 
 
 
  can be thought of as a wavefront.
In discussions of exact solutions to the Einstein field equation, many authors fail to specify the intended range of the coordinate variables

 
 . Here we should take



to allow for the possibility that the pp-wave develops a null curvature singularity.
