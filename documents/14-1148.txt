   Integral of the secant function      Integral of the secant function   __NOTOC__ The integral of the secant function of trigonometry was the subject of one of the "outstanding open problems of the mid-seventeenth century", solved in 1668 by James Gregory . 1 In 1599, Edward Wright evaluated the integral by numerical methods – what today we would call Riemann sums . 2 He wanted the solution for the purposes of cartography – specifically for constructing an accurate Mercator projection . 3 In the 1640s, Henry Bond, a teacher of navigation, surveying, and other mathematical topics, compared Wright's numerically computed table of values of the integral of the secant with a table of logarithms of the tangent function, and consequently conjectured 4 that         ∫  0  θ    sec    ζ   d  ζ     =   ln   |   tan   (    θ  2   +   π  4    )    |     .        superscript   subscript   0   θ       ζ  d  ζ               θ  2     π  4         \int_{0}^{\theta}\sec\zeta\,d\zeta=\ln\left|\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}+\frac{%
 \pi}{4}\right)\right|.     That conjecture became widely known, and in 1665, Isaac Newton was aware of it. 5 6  The problem was solved by Isaac Barrow . His proof of the result was the earliest use of partial fractions in integration. 7 Adapted to modern notation, Barrow's proof began as follows:       ∫   sec    θ   d  θ     =   ∫    d  θ    cos  θ     =   ∫    cos    θ   d  θ      cos  2   θ     =   ∫    cos    θ   d  θ     1  -    sin  2   θ                  θ  d  θ           d  θ     θ                  θ  d  θ      superscript   2   θ                  θ  d  θ      1    superscript   2   θ         \int\sec\theta\,d\theta=\int\frac{d\theta}{\cos\theta}=\int\frac{\cos\theta\,d%
 \theta}{\cos^{2}\theta}=\int\frac{\cos\theta\,d\theta}{1-\sin^{2}\theta}   Substituting   u   u   u   for    sin  θ      θ    \sin\theta   reduces the integral to       ∫    d  u    1  -   u  2              d  u     1   superscript  u  2       \displaystyle\int\frac{du}{1-u^{2}}     Therefore       ∫   sec    θ   d  θ     =    {        1  2    ln   |    1  +   sin  θ     1  -   sin  θ     |     +  C         ln   |    sec  θ   +   tan  θ    |    +  C         ln   |   tan   (    θ  2   +   π  4    )    |    +  C      }   (equivalent forms)             θ  d  θ                1  2           1    θ      1    θ        C               θ     θ      C                 θ  2     π  4       C      (equivalent forms)     \int\sec\theta\,d\theta=\left\{\begin{array}[]{l}\dfrac{1}{2}\ln\left|\dfrac{1%
 +\sin\theta}{1-\sin\theta}\right|+C\\
 \ln\left|\sec\theta+\tan\theta\right|+C\\
 \ln\left|\tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\right|+C\end{array}%
 \right\}\text{ (equivalent forms)}   The second of these follows by first multiplying top and bottom of the interior fraction by    (   1  +   sin  θ    )      1    θ     (1+\sin\theta)   . This gives     cos  2   θ      superscript   2   θ    \cos^{2}\theta   in the denominator and the result follows by moving the factor of 1/2 into the logarithm as a square root.  The third form follows by replacing    sin  θ      θ    \sin\theta   by    -   cos   (   θ  +   π  /  2    )            θ    π  2       -\cos(\theta+\pi/2)   and expanding using the identities for    cos   2  x         2  x     \cos 2x   . It may also be obtained directly by means of the following substitutions:        sec  θ   =    1   sin   (   θ  +    π  2     )      =    1   2   sin   (     θ  2    +    π  4     )     cos   (     θ  2    +    π  4     )       =      sec  2    (     θ  2    +    π  4     )     2   tan   (     θ  2    +    π  4     )        .          θ     1      θ    π  2             1    2        θ  2     π  4           θ  2     π  4                superscript   2       θ  2     π  4       2        θ  2     π  4          \displaystyle\sec\theta=\frac{1}{\sin\left(\theta+\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}=\frac%
 {1}{2\sin\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\cos\left(\dfrac{\theta}%
 {2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}=\frac{\sec^{2}\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4%
 }\right)}{2\tan\left(\dfrac{\theta}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)}.     The conventional solution for the Mercator projection ordinate may be written without the modulus signs since the latitude (φ) lies between −π/2 and π/2:       y  =   ln    tan    (    ϕ  2   +   π  4    )      .      y          ϕ  2     π  4        y=\ln\tan\!\left(\dfrac{\phi}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right).     The integral can also be derived by using the tangent half-angle substitution .  Hyperbolic forms  Let     ψ   ψ   \displaystyle\psi   Therefore       ∫   sec    θ   d  θ             θ  d  θ      \displaystyle\int\sec\theta\,d\theta     Gudermannian and lambertian  The integral of the secant function defines the inverse of the Gudermannian function :       ∫   sec    θ   d  θ             θ  d  θ      \displaystyle\int\sec\theta\,d\theta   The lambertian function (lam) is a notation for the inverse of the gudermannian which is encountered in the theory of map projections. In particular the Mercator projection may be written 8 as       y  =   lam   (  ϕ  )     .      y    lam  ϕ     y=\mbox{lam}(\phi).
