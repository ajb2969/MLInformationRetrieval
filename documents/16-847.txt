   Cut-insertion theorem      Cut-insertion theorem   The Cut-insertion theorem , also known as Pellegrini's theorem , 1 is a linear network theorem that allows transformation of a generic network N into another network N' that makes analysis simpler and for which the main properties are more apparent.  Statement  Let e , h , u , w , q=q ', and '' t=t' '' be six arbitrary nodes of the network N and    S   S   S    be an independent voltage or current source connected between e and h , while    U   U   U    is the output quantity, either a voltage or current, relative to the branch with immittance     X  u     subscript  X  u    X_{u}   , connected between u and w . Let us now cut the '' qq' '' connection and insert a three-terminal circuit ("TTC") between the two nodes q and ''q' '' and the node '' t=t' '', as in figure b (    W  r     subscript  W  r    W_{r}   and    W  p     subscript  W  p    W_{p}   are homogeneous quantities, voltages or currents, relative to the ports qt and '' q'q't' '' of the TTC).  In order for the two networks N and N' to be equivalent for any   S   S   S   , the two constraints     W  r   =   W  p        subscript  W  r    subscript  W  p     W_{r}=W_{p}   and      W  r   ¯   =    W  p   ¯        normal-¯   subscript  W  r     normal-¯   subscript  W  p      \bar{W_{r}}=\bar{W_{p}}   , where the overline indicates the dual quantity, are to be satisfied.  The above mentioned three-terminal circuit can be implemented, for example, connecting an ideal independent voltage or current source    W  p     subscript  W  p    W_{p}   between ''q' '' and '' t' '', and an immittance    X  p     subscript  X  p    X_{p}   between q and t .  Network functions  With reference to the network N', the following network functions can be defined:      A  ≡     U   W  p    |    S  =  0        A   evaluated-at    U   subscript  W  p      S  0      A\equiv\frac{U}{W_{p}}|_{S=0}\!\,   ;    β  ≡      W  r   U   |    S  =  0        β   evaluated-at     subscript  W  r   U     S  0      \beta\equiv\frac{W_{r}}{U}|_{S=0}\!\,   ;     X  i   ≡      W  p     W  p   ¯    |    S  =  0         subscript  X  i    evaluated-at     subscript  W  p    normal-¯   subscript  W  p       S  0      X_{i}\equiv\frac{W_{p}}{\bar{W_{p}}}|_{S=0}\!\,       γ  ≡     U  S   |     W  p   =  0        γ   evaluated-at    U  S      subscript  W  p   0      \gamma\equiv\frac{U}{S}|_{W_{p}=0}\!\,   ;    α  ≡      W  r   S   |     W  p   =  0        α   evaluated-at     subscript  W  r   S      subscript  W  p   0      \alpha\equiv\frac{W_{r}}{S}|_{W_{p}=0}\!\,   ;    ρ  ≡       W  p   ¯   S   |     W  p   =  0        ρ   evaluated-at     normal-¯   subscript  W  p    S      subscript  W  p   0      \rho\equiv\frac{\bar{W_{p}}}{S}|_{W_{p}=0}\!\,     from which, exploiting the Superposition theorem , we obtain:       W  r   =    α  S   +   β  A   W  p          subscript  W  r       α  S     β  A   subscript  W  p       W_{r}=\alpha S+\beta AW_{p}         W  p   ¯   =    ρ  S   +    W  p    X  i          normal-¯   subscript  W  p        ρ  S      subscript  W  p    subscript  X  i       \bar{W_{p}}=\rho S+\frac{W_{p}}{X_{i}}   .  Therefore the first constraint for the equivalence of the networks is satisfied if     W  p   =    α   1  -   β  A     S        subscript  W  p       α    1    β  A     S     W_{p}=\frac{\alpha}{1-\beta A}S   .  Furthermore,        W  r   ¯   =    W  r    X  p         normal-¯   subscript  W  r       subscript  W  r    subscript  X  p      \bar{W_{r}}=\frac{W_{r}}{X_{p}}         W  p   ¯   =    (    1   X  i    +    ρ  α    (   1  -   β  A    )     )    W  r         normal-¯   subscript  W  p          1   subscript  X  i        ρ  α     1    β  A       subscript  W  r      \bar{W_{p}}=\left(\frac{1}{X_{i}}+\frac{\rho}{\alpha}(1-\beta A)\right)W_{r}     therefore the second constraint for the equivalence of the networks holds if     1   X  p    =    1   X  i    +    ρ  α    (   1  -   β  A    )           1   subscript  X  p        1   subscript  X  i        ρ  α     1    β  A        \frac{1}{X_{p}}=\frac{1}{X_{i}}+\frac{\rho}{\alpha}(1-\beta A)    2  Transfer function  If we consider the expressions for the network functions   γ   γ   \gamma   and   A   A   A   , the first constraint for the equivalence of the networks, and we also consider that, as a result of the superposition principle,    U  =    γ  S   +   A   W  p         U      γ  S     A   subscript  W  p       U=\gamma S+AW_{p}   , the transfer function     A  f   ≡   U  S        subscript  A  f     U  S     A_{f}\equiv\frac{U}{S}   is given by       A  f   =     α  A    1  -   β  A     +  γ        subscript  A  f         α  A     1    β  A     γ     A_{f}=\frac{\alpha A}{1-\beta A}+\gamma   .  For the particular case of a feedback amplifier , the network functions    α   α   \alpha    ,    γ   γ   \gamma    and    ρ   ρ   \rho    take into account the nonidealities of such amplifier. In particular:      α   α   \alpha    takes into account the nonideality of the comparison network at the input     γ   γ   \gamma    takes into account the non unidirectionality of the feedback chain     ρ   ρ   \rho    takes into account the non unidirectionality of the amplification chain.   If the amplifier can be considered ideal, i.e. if    α  =  1      α  1    \alpha=1   ,    ρ  =  0      ρ  0    \rho=0   and    γ  =  0      γ  0    \gamma=0   , the transfer function reduces to the known expression deriving from classical feedback theory:       A  f   =   A   1  -   β  A          subscript  A  f     A    1    β  A       A_{f}=\frac{A}{1-\beta A}   .  Evaluation of the impedance and of the admittance between two nodes  The evaluation of the impedance (or of the admittance ) between two nodes is made somewhat simpler by the cut-insertion theorem.  Impedance  Let us insert a generic source   S   S   S   between the nodes j=e=q and k=h between which we want to evaluate the impedance   Z   Z   Z   . By performing a cut as shown in the figure, we notice that the immittance    X  p     subscript  X  p    X_{p}   is in series with   S   S   S   and the current through it is thus the same as that provided by   S   S   S   . If we choose an input voltage source     V  s   =  S       subscript  V  s   S    V_{s}=S   and, as a consequence, a current     I  s   =   S  ¯        subscript  I  s    normal-¯  S     I_{s}=\bar{S}   , and an impedance     Z  p   =   X  p        subscript  Z  p    subscript  X  p     Z_{p}=X_{p}   , we can write the following relationships:      Z  =    V  s    I  s    =    V  s    I  r    =    Z  p     V  s    V  r     =    Z  p     V  s    V  p     =    Z  p     1  -   β  A    α          Z     subscript  V  s    subscript  I  s            subscript  V  s    subscript  I  r            subscript  Z  p      subscript  V  s    subscript  V  r             subscript  Z  p      subscript  V  s    subscript  V  p             subscript  Z  p       1    β  A    α       Z=\frac{V_{s}}{I_{s}}=\frac{V_{s}}{I_{r}}=Z_{p}\frac{V_{s}}{V_{r}}=Z_{p}\frac{%
 V_{s}}{V_{p}}=Z_{p}\frac{1-\beta A}{\alpha}   .  Considering that    α  =      V  r    V  s    |     V  p   =  0    =    Z  p     Z  p   +   Z  b           α   evaluated-at     subscript  V  r    subscript  V  s       subscript  V  p   0            subscript  Z  p      subscript  Z  p    subscript  Z  b        \alpha=\frac{V_{r}}{V_{s}}|_{V_{p}=0}=\frac{Z_{p}}{Z_{p}+Z_{b}}   , where    Z  b     subscript  Z  b    Z_{b}   is the impedance seen between the nodes k=h and t if remove    Z  p     subscript  Z  p    Z_{p}   and short-circuit the voltage sources, we obtain the impedance   Z   Z   Z   between the nodes j and k in the form:      Z  =    (    Z  p   +   Z  b    )    (   1  -   β  A    )        Z       subscript  Z  p    subscript  Z  b      1    β  A       Z=\left(Z_{p}+Z_{b}\right)\left(1-\beta A\right)     Admittance  We proceed in a way analogous to the impedance case, but this time the cut will be as shown in the figure to the right, noticing that   S   S   S   is now in parallel to    X  p     subscript  X  p    X_{p}   . If we consider an input current source     I  s   =  S       subscript  I  s   S    I_{s}=S   (as a result we have a voltage     V  s   =   S  ¯        subscript  V  s    normal-¯  S     V_{s}=\bar{S}   ) and an admittance     Y  p   =   X  p        subscript  Y  p    subscript  X  p     Y_{p}=X_{p}   , the admittance   Y   Y   Y   between the nodes j and k can be computed as follows:      Y  =    I  s    V  s    =    I  s    V  r    =    Y  p     I  s    I  r     =    Y  p     I  s    I  p     =    Y  p     1  -   β  A    α          Y     subscript  I  s    subscript  V  s            subscript  I  s    subscript  V  r            subscript  Y  p      subscript  I  s    subscript  I  r             subscript  Y  p      subscript  I  s    subscript  I  p             subscript  Y  p       1    β  A    α       Y=\frac{I_{s}}{V_{s}}=\frac{I_{s}}{V_{r}}=Y_{p}\frac{I_{s}}{I_{r}}=Y_{p}\frac{%
 I_{s}}{I_{p}}=Y_{p}\frac{1-\beta A}{\alpha}   .  Considering that    α  =      I  r    I  s    |     I  p   =  0    =    Y  p     Y  p   +   Y  b           α   evaluated-at     subscript  I  r    subscript  I  s       subscript  I  p   0            subscript  Y  p      subscript  Y  p    subscript  Y  b        \alpha=\frac{I_{r}}{I_{s}}|_{I_{p}=0}=\frac{Y_{p}}{Y_{p}+Y_{b}}   , where    Y  b     subscript  Y  b    Y_{b}   is the admittance seen between the nodes k=h and t if we remove    Y  p     subscript  Y  p    Y_{p}   and open the current sources, we obtain the admittance   Y   Y   Y   in the form:      Y  =    (    Y  p   +   Y  b    )    (   1  -   β  A    )        Y       subscript  Y  p    subscript  Y  b      1    β  A       Y=\left(Y_{p}+Y_{b}\right)\left(1-\beta A\right)     Comments  The implementation of the TTC with an independent source    W  p     subscript  W  p    W_{p}   and an immittance    X  p     subscript  X  p    X_{p}   is useful and intuitive for the calculation of the impedance between two nodes, but involves, as in the case of the other network functions, the difficulty of the calculation of    X  p     subscript  X  p    X_{p}   from the equivalence equation. Such difficulty can be avoided using a dependent source     W  p   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  W  p     \bar{W_{p}}   in place of    X  p     subscript  X  p    X_{p}   and using the Blackman formula 3 for the evaluation of   X   X   X   . Such an implementation of the TTC allows finding a feedback topology even in a network consisting of a voltage source and two impedances in series.  Notes    References   B.
