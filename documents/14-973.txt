Fubini's theorem on differentiation

In mathematics, Fubini's theorem on differentiation, named after Guido Fubini, is a result in real analysis concerning the differentiation of series of monotonic functions. It can be proven by using Fatou's lemma and the properties of null sets.1
Statement
Assume 
 
 
 
  is an interval and that for every natural number k, 
 
 
 
  is an increasing function. If,



exists for all 
 
 
 
  then,



almost everywhere in I.2
In general, if we don't suppose fk is increasing for every k, in order to get the same conclusion, we need a stricter condition like uniform convergence of 
 
 
 
  on I for every n.3
