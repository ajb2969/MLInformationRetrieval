   Fubini's theorem on differentiation      Fubini's theorem on differentiation   In mathematics, Fubini's theorem on differentiation , named after Guido Fubini , is a result in real analysis concerning the differentiation of series of monotonic functions . It can be proven by using Fatou's lemma and the properties of null sets . 1  Statement  Assume    I  ⊆  ℝ      I  ℝ    I\subseteq\mathbb{R}   is an interval and that for every natural number k,     f  k   :   I  →  ℝ      normal-:   subscript  f  k    normal-→  I  ℝ     f_{k}:I\to\mathbb{R}   is an increasing function . If,       s   (  x  )    :=    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     f  k    (  x  )        assign    s  x     superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  f  k   x      s(x):=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_{k}(x)     exists for all     x  ∈  I   ,      x  I    x\in I,   then,        s  ′    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     f  k  ′    (  x  )            superscript  s  normal-′   x     superscript   subscript     k  1         superscript   subscript  f  k   normal-′   x      s^{\prime}(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f_{k}^{\prime}(x)     almost everywhere in I . 2  In general, if we don't suppose f k is increasing for every k, in order to get the same conclusion, we need a stricter condition like uniform convergence of     ∑   k  =  1   n     f  k  ′    (  x  )        superscript   subscript     k  1    n      superscript   subscript  f  k   normal-′   x     \sum_{k=1}^{n}f_{k}^{\prime}(x)   on I for every n. 3  References    "  Category:Theorems in real analysis  Category:Theorems in measure theory     Jones, Frank (2001), Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space , Jones and Bartlett publishers, pp. 527–529. ↩   Rudin, Walter (1976), Principles of Mathematical Analysis , McGraw-Hill, p. 152. ↩
