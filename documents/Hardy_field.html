<h1>Hardy field</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>Hardy field</strong> is a <a href="Field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> consisting of <a href="Germ_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">germs</a> of real-valued functions at infinity that is closed under <a href="differentiation_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">differentiation</a>. They are named after the English mathematician <a href="G._H._Hardy" title="wikilink">G. H. Hardy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>Initially at least, Hardy fields were defined in terms of germs of real functions at infinity. Specifically we consider a collection <em>H</em> of functions that are defined for all large real numbers, that is functions <em>f</em> that map (<em>u</em>,∞) to the real numbers <strong>R</strong>, where <em>u</em> is some real number depending on <em>f</em>. Here and in the rest of the article we say a function has a property "eventually" if it has the property for all sufficiently large <em>x</em>, so for example we say a function <em>f</em> in <em>H</em> is <em>eventually zero</em> if there is some real number <em>U</em> such that <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 0 for all <em>x</em> ≥ <em>U</em>. We can form an <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a> on <em>H</em> by saying <em>f</em> is equivalent to <em>g</em> if and only if <em>f</em> − <em>g</em> is eventually zero. The equivalence classes of this relation are called germs at infinity.</p>

<p>If <em>H</em> forms a field under the usual addition and multiplication of functions then so will <em>H</em> modulo this equivalence relation under the induced addition and multiplication operations. Moreover, if every function in <em>H</em> is eventually differentiable and the derivative of any function in <em>H</em> is also in <em>H</em> then <em>H</em> modulo the above equivalence relation is called a Hardy field.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Elements of a Hardy field are thus equivalence classes and should be denoted, say, [<em>f</em>]<sub>∞</sub> to denote the class of functions that are eventually equal to the representative function <em>f</em>. However, in practice the elements are normally just denoted by the representatives themselves, so instead of [<em>f</em>]<sub>∞</sub> one would just write <em>f</em>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>If <em>F</em> is a <a href="Field_extension" title="wikilink">subfield</a> of <strong>R</strong> then we can consider it as a Hardy field by considering the elements of <em>F</em> as constant functions, that is by considering the number α in <em>F</em> as the constant function <em>f</em><sub>α</sub> that maps every <em>x</em> in <strong>R</strong> to α. This is a field since <em>F</em> is, and since the derivative of every function in this field is 0 which must be in <em>F</em> it is a Hardy field.</p>

<p>A less trivial example of a Hardy field is the field of <a href="rational_function" title="wikilink">rational functions</a> on <strong>R</strong>, denoted <strong>R</strong>(<em>x</em>). This is the set of functions of the form <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>)/<em>Q</em>(<em>x</em>) where <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are polynomials with real coefficients. Since the polynomial <em>Q</em> can have only finitely many zeros by the <a href="fundamental_theorem_of_algebra" title="wikilink">fundamental theorem of algebra</a>, such a rational function will be defined for all sufficiently large <em>x</em>, specifically for all <em>x</em> larger than the largest real root of <em>Q</em>. Adding and multiplying rational functions gives more rational functions, and the <a href="quotient_rule" title="wikilink">quotient rule</a> shows that the derivative of rational function is again a rational function, so <strong>R</strong>(<em>x</em>) forms a Hardy field.</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<p>Any element of a Hardy field is eventually either strictly positive, strictly negative, or zero. This follows fairly immediately from the facts that the elements in a Hardy field are eventually differentiable and hence <a href="Continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuous</a> and eventually either have a multiplicative inverse or are zero. This means periodic functions such as the sine and cosine functions cannot exist in Hardy fields.</p>

<p>This avoidance of periodic functions also means that every element in a Hardy field has a (possibly infinite) limit at infinity, so if <em>f</em> is an element of <em>H</em>, then</p>

<p>It also means we can place an <a href="Total_order" title="wikilink">ordering</a> on <em>H</em> by saying <em>f</em> <em>x</em> then since <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) − <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) &gt; 0 for all <em>x</em> we have that <em>g</em> &gt; <em>f</em>. But they both tend to infinity. In this sense the ordering tells us how quickly all the unbounded functions diverge to infinity.</p>

<p>The modern theory of Hardy fields doesn't restrict to real functions but to those defined in certain structures expanding <a href="real_closed_field" title="wikilink">real closed fields</a>. Indeed, if <em>R</em> is an <a href="o-minimal_theory" title="wikilink">o-minimal</a> expansion of a field, then the set of unary definable functions in <em>R</em> that are defined for all sufficiently large elements forms a Hardy field denoted <em>H</em>(<em>R</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The properties of Hardy fields in the real setting still hold in this more general setting.</p>
