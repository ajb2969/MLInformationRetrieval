Category:Integers

The integers consist of 0, the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …), and their negatives (-1, -2, -3, …). The set of all integers is usually denoted by Z (or Z in blackboard bold, 
 
 
 
 ), which stands for Zahlen (German for "numbers").
Sorting the articles in this category
The number articles in this Wikipedia:Categorization are sorted as follows:

negative numbers first
then single digit numbers
then by the first digit (so 10000 comes before 230 comes before 40)
then numerically (so 19 comes before 144 comes before 1024).
Articles whose title is a name rather than a number are listed alphabetically after those with numeric titles.

The numeric sorting is not the default used in Wikipedia; it is done using a system of Wikipedia:Categorization explained on this page's category talk page. When adding articles about specific integers into this category please conform to this ordering.
