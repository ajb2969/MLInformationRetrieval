   Kramers' law      Kramers' law   Kramers' law is a formula for the spectral distribution of X-rays produced by an electron hitting a solid target. The formula concerns only bremsstrahlung radiation, not the element specific characteristic radiation . It is named after its discoverer, the Dutch physicist Hendrik Anthony Kramers . 1  The formula for Kramers' law is usually given as the distribution of intensity (photon count)   I   I   I   against the wavelength    λ   λ   \lambda   of the emitted radiation: 2       I   (  λ  )   d  λ   =   K   (    λ   λ   m  i  n     -  1   )    1   λ  2    d  λ         I  λ  d  λ     K      λ   subscript  λ    m  i  n     1     1   superscript  λ  2    d  λ     I(\lambda)d\lambda=K\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{min}}-1\right)\frac{1}{%
 \lambda^{2}}d\lambda     The constant K is proportional to the atomic number of the target element, and    λ   m  i  n      subscript  λ    m  i  n     \lambda_{min}   is the minimum wavelength given by the Duane–Hunt law .  The intensity described above is a particle flux and not an energy flux as can be seen by the fact that the integral over values from    λ   m  i  n      subscript  λ    m  i  n     \lambda_{min}   to   ∞     \infty   is infinite. However, the integral of the energy flux is finite.  To obtain a simple expression for the energy flux, first change variables from   λ   λ   \lambda   (the wavelength) to   ω   ω   \omega   (the angular frequency) using    λ  =    2  π  c   /  ω       λ      2  π  c   ω     \lambda=2\pi c/\omega   and also using      I  ~    (  ω  )    =   I   (  λ  )     -   d  λ     d  ω            normal-~  I   ω     I  λ        d  λ      d  ω       \tilde{I}(\omega)=I(\lambda)\frac{-d\lambda}{d\omega}   . Now     I  ~    (  ω  )        normal-~  I   ω    \tilde{I}(\omega)   is that quantity which is integrated over   ω   ω   \omega   from 0 to    ω   m  a  x      subscript  ω    m  a  x     \omega_{max}   to get the total number (still infinite) of photons, where     ω   m  a  x    =    2  π  c   /   λ   m  i  n          subscript  ω    m  a  x        2  π  c    subscript  λ    m  i  n       \omega_{max}=2\pi c/\lambda_{min}   :        I  ~    (  ω  )    =    K   2  π  c     (     ω   m  a  x    ω   -  1   )           normal-~  I   ω       K    2  π  c         subscript  ω    m  a  x    ω   1      \tilde{I}(\omega)=\frac{K}{2\pi c}\left(\frac{\omega_{max}}{\omega}-1\right)     The energy flux, which we will call    ψ   (  ω  )       ψ  ω    \psi(\omega)   (but which may also be referred to as the "intensity" in conflict with the above name of    I   (  λ  )       I  λ    I(\lambda)   ) is obtained by multiplying the above    I  ~     normal-~  I    \tilde{I}   by the energy    ℏ  ω      Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω    \hbar\omega   :       ψ   (  ω  )    =    K   2  π  c     (    ℏ   ω   m  a  x     -   ℏ  ω    )          ψ  ω       K    2  π  c        Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  ω    m  a  x       Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω       \psi(\omega)=\frac{K}{2\pi c}(\hbar\omega_{max}-\hbar\omega)   for    ω  ≤   ω   m  a  x        ω   subscript  ω    m  a  x      \omega\leq\omega_{max}          ψ   (  ω  )    =  0        ψ  ω   0    \psi(\omega)=0   for    ω  ≥   ω   m  a  x        ω   subscript  ω    m  a  x      \omega\geq\omega_{max}   .  It is a linear function that is zero at the maximum energy    ℏ   ω   m  a  x        Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  ω    m  a  x      \hbar\omega_{max}   .
