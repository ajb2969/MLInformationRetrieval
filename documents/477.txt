   Curie      Curie   The curie (symbol Ci ) is a non- SI unit of radioactivity , named after Pierre Curie , 1 but probably also after Marie Curie . It was originally defined as 'the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium (element)' 2 but is currently defined as: 1 Ci = 3.7 × 10 10  decays per second after more accurate measurements of the activity of 226 Ra (which has a specific activity of 3.66 x 10 10 Bq/g. 3 )  In 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures gave the becquerel (Bq), equal to one reciprocal second, official status as the SI unit of activity. 4 Therefore:   1 Ci = 3.7 × 10 10 Bq = 37 GBq   and   1 Bq ≅ 2.703 × 10 −11 Ci ≅ 27 pCi   While its continued use is discouraged by NIST 5 and other bodies, the curie is still widely used throughout the government, industry and medicine in the United States and in other countries.  The curie is a large amount of activity, and was intentionally so. According to Bertram Boltwood, Marie Curie thought that 'the use of the name "curie" for so infinitesimally small (a) quantity of anything was altogether inappropriate.' 6  The typical human body contains roughly 0.1 μCi (14 mg) of naturally occurring potassium-40 . A human body containing 16 kg of carbon (see Composition of the human body ) would also have about 24 nanograms or 0.1 μCi of carbon-14 . Together, these would have an activity of approximately 0.2 μCi or 7400 Bq inside the person's body.  Curie as a measure of quantity  Units of activity (the curie and the becquerel) also refer to a quantity of radioactive atoms. Due to the fact that the probability of decay is a fixed physical quantity, for a known number of atoms of a particular radionuclide , a predicable number will decay in a given time. The number of decays that will occur in one second in one gram of atoms of a particular radionuclide is known as the specific activity of that radionuclide.  The activity of a sample decreases with time because of decay.  The rules of radioactive decay may be used to convert activity to an actual number of atoms. They state that 1 Ci of radioactive atoms would follow the expression:   N (atoms) × λ (s −1 ) = 1 Ci = 3.7 × 10 10 (Bq)   and so,   N = 3.7 × 10 10 / λ,   where λ is the decay constant in (s −1 ).  We can also express activity in moles:       =        3.7  ×   10  10      (   ln  2   )    N  A      moles   ×   t   1  /  2     in seconds       absent            3.7   superscript  10  10        2    subscript  N  normal-A     moles    subscript  t    1  2     in seconds     \displaystyle=\frac{3.7\times 10^{10}}{(\ln 2)N_{\rm A}}\text{ moles}\times t_%
 {1/2}\text{ in seconds}   where N A is Avogadro's number and t 1/2 is the half life. The number of moles may be converted to grams by multiplying by the atomic mass .
