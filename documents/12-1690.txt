Petersson trace formula

In analytic number theory, the Petersson trace formula is a kind of orthogonality relation between coefficients of a holomorphic modular form. It is a specialization of the more general Kuznetsov trace formula.
In its simplest form the Petersson trace formula is as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be an orthonormal basis of 
 
 
 
 , the space of cusp forms of weight 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Then for any positive integers 
 
 
 
  we have


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta function, 
 
 
 
  is the Kloosterman sum and 
 
 
 
  is the Bessel function of the first kind.
