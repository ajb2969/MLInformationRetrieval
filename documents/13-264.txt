   Mollweide's formula      Mollweide's formula   In trigonometry , Mollweide's formula , sometimes referred to in older texts as Mollweide's equations , 1 named after Karl Mollweide , is a set of two relationships between sides and angles in a triangle. 2 It can be used to check solutions of triangles . 3  Let a , b , and c be the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Let α , β , and γ be the measures of the angles opposite those three sides respectively. Mollweide's formula states that        a  +  b   c   =    cos   (    α  -  β   2   )     sin   (   γ  2   )             a  b   c           α  β   2        γ  2       \frac{a+b}{c}=\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{%
 \gamma}{2}\right)}     and         a  -  b   c   =    sin   (    α  -  β   2   )     cos   (   γ  2   )      .          a  b   c           α  β   2        γ  2       \frac{a-b}{c}=\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{%
 \gamma}{2}\right)}.     Each of these identities uses all six parts of the triangle—the three angles and the lengths of the three sides.
