Draft:Bockstein spectral sequence

== Definition and convergence == Let C be a chain complex of torsion-free abelian groups and p a prime number. Then we have the exact sequence:


 
 . Taking integral homology H, we get the exact couple of "doubly graded" abelian groups:


 
 . where the grading goes
 
 
 
  and the same for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
This gives the first page of the spectral sequence: we take 
 
 
 
  with the differential 
 
 
 
 . The derived couple of the above exact couple then gives the second page and and so forth; we thus have (with some identification):
