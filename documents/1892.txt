   Anderson orthogonality theorem      Anderson orthogonality theorem   The Anderson orthogonality theorem is a theorem in physics by the physicist P. W. Anderson .  It relates to the introduction of a magnetic impurity in a metal. When a magnetic impurity is introduced into a metal, the conduction electrons will tend to screen the potential    V   (  r  )       V  r    V(r)   that the impurity creates. The N-electron ground state for the system when     V   (  r  )    =  0        V  r   0    V(r)=0   , which corresponds to the absence of the impurity and     V   (  r  )    â‰   0        V  r   0    V(r)\neq 0   , which corresponds to the introduction of the impurity are orthogonal .
