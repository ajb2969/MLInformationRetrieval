   Loewner's torus inequality      Loewner's torus inequality   In differential geometry , Loewner's torus inequality is an inequality due to Charles Loewner . It relates the systole and the area of an arbitrary Riemannian metric on the 2-torus .  Statement  In 1949 Charles Loewner proved that every metric on the 2- torus     ùïã  2     superscript  ùïã  2    \mathbb{T}^{2}   satisfies the optimal inequality        sys  2   ‚â§     2   3      area   (   ùïã  2   )      ,       superscript  sys  2       2    3     area   superscript  ùïã  2       \operatorname{sys}^{2}\leq\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\;\operatorname{area}(\mathbb{T}^{%
 2}),     where "sys" is its systole , i.e. least length of a noncontractible loop. The constant appearing on the right hand side is the Hermite constant     Œ≥  2     subscript  Œ≥  2    \gamma_{2}   in dimension 2, so that Loewner's torus inequality can be rewritten as        sys  2   ‚â§     Œ≥  2     area   (   ùïã  2   )      .       superscript  sys  2      subscript  Œ≥  2    area   superscript  ùïã  2       \operatorname{sys}^{2}\leq\gamma_{2}\;\operatorname{area}(\mathbb{T}^{2}).     The inequality was first mentioned in the literature in .  Case of equality  The boundary case of equality is attained if and only if the metric is flat and homothetic to the so-called equilateral torus , i.e. torus whose group of deck transformations is precisely the hexagonal lattice spanned by the cube roots of unity in   ‚ÑÇ   ‚ÑÇ   \mathbb{C}   .  Alternative formulation  Given a doubly periodic metric on    ‚Ñù  2     superscript  ‚Ñù  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   (e.g. an imbedding in    ‚Ñù  3     superscript  ‚Ñù  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   which is invariant by a    ‚Ñ§  2     superscript  ‚Ñ§  2    \mathbb{Z}^{2}   isometric action), there is a nonzero element    g  ‚àà   ‚Ñ§  2       g   superscript  ‚Ñ§  2     g\in\mathbb{Z}^{2}   and a point    p  ‚àà   ‚Ñù  2       p   superscript  ‚Ñù  2     p\in\mathbb{R}^{2}   such that    dist    (  p  ,  g  .  p  )   2   ‚â§   2   3    area   (  F  )      fragments  dist   superscript   fragments  normal-(  p  normal-,  g  normal-.  p  normal-)   2      2    3    area   fragments  normal-(  F  normal-)     \operatorname{dist}(p,g.p)^{2}\leq\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\operatorname{area}(F)   , where   F   F   F   is a fundamental domain for the action, while   dist   dist   \operatorname{dist}   is the Riemannian distance, namely least length of a path joining   p   p   p   and    g  .  p     formulae-sequence  g  p    g.p   .  Proof of Loewner's torus inequality  Loewner's torus inequality can be proved most easily by using the computational formula for the variance ,         E   (   X  2   )    -    (   E   (  X  )    )   2    =   var   (  X  )     .          E   superscript  X  2     superscript    E  X   2      var  X     E(X^{2})-(E(X))^{2}=\mathrm{var}(X).\,     Namely, the formula is applied to the probability measure defined by the measure of the unit area flat torus in the conformal class of the given torus. For the random variable X , one takes the conformal factor of the given metric with respect to the flat one. Then the expected value E( X 2 ) of X 2 expresses the total area of the given metric. Meanwhile, the expected value E( X ) of X can be related to the systole by using Fubini's theorem . The variance of X can then be thought of as the isosystolic defect, analogous to the isoperimetric defect of Bonnesen's inequality . This approach therefore produces the following version of Loewner's torus inequality with isosystolic defect:        area  -     3   2     (  sys  )   2     ‚â•   var   (  f  )     ,        area        3   2    superscript  sys  2       var  f     \mathrm{area}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(\mathrm{sys})^{2}\geq\mathrm{var}(f),     where ∆í is the conformal factor of the metric with respect to a unit area flat metric in its conformal class.  Higher genus  Whether or not the inequality        (  sys  )   2   ‚â§     Œ≥  2    area        superscript  sys  2      subscript  Œ≥  2   area     (\mathrm{sys})^{2}\leq\gamma_{2}\,\mathrm{area}     is satisfied by all surfaces of nonpositive Euler characteristic is unknown. For orientable surfaces of genus 2 and genus 20 and above, the answer is affirmative, see work by Katz and Sabourau below.
