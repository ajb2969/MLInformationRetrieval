Norm (abelian group)




Norm (abelian group)

In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, if (G, +) is an abelian group then 
 
 
 
  is said to be a norm on the abelian group (G, +) if:



 
 ,


 
 ,


 
 .

The norm ν is discrete if there is some real number ρ > 0 such that ν(g) > ρ whenever g ≠ 0.
Free abelian groups
An abelian group is a free abelian group if and only if it has a discrete norm.1
