   Weak trace-class operator      Weak trace-class operator   In mathematics, a weak trace class operator is a compact operator on a separable  Hilbert space  H with singular values the same order as the harmonic sequence . When the dimension of H is infinite the ideal of weak trace-class operators has fundamentally different properties than the ideal of trace class operators . The usual operator trace on the trace-class operators does not extend to the weak trace class. Instead the ideal of weak trace-class operators admits an infinite number of linearly independent quasi-continuous traces, and it is the smallest two-sided ideal for which all traces on it are singular traces .  Weak trace-class operators feature in the noncommutative geometry of French mathematician Alain Connes .  Definition  A compact operator  A on an infinite dimensional separable  Hilbert space  H is weak trace class if μ( n , A )   =     =   O( n −1 ), where μ( A ) is the sequence of singular values . In mathematical notation the two-sided ideal of all weak trace-class operators is denoted,          L   1  ,  ∞    =   {   A  ∈   K   (  H  )     :    μ   (  n  ,  A  )    =   O   (   n   -  1    )     }    .       subscript  L   1      conditional-set    A    K  H        μ   n  A      O   superscript  n    1         L_{1,\infty}=\{A\in K(H):\mu(n,A)=O(n^{-1})\}.        The term weak trace-class, or weak- L 1 , is used because the operator ideal corresponds, in J. W. Calkin's correspondence between two-sided ideals of bounded linear operators and rearrangement invariant sequence spaces, to the weak- l 1 sequence space .  Properties   the weak trace-class operators admit a quasi-norm defined by            ∥  A  ∥   w   =    sup   n  ≥  0      (   1  +  n   )   μ   (  n  ,  A  )      ,       subscript   norm  A   w     subscript  supremum    n  0        1  n   μ   n  A       \|A\|_{w}=\sup_{n\geq 0}(1+n)\mu(n,A),       making L 1,∞ a quasi-Banach operator ideal, that is an ideal that is also a quasi-Banach space .
