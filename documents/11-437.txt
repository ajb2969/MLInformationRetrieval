ADP-dependent medium-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, an ADP-dependent medium-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + a carboxylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-dependent-medium-chain-acyl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include medium-chain acyl coenzyme A hydrolase, medium-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase, medium-chain acyl-thioester hydrolase, medium-chain hydrolase, and myristoyl-CoA thioesterase. It employs one cofactor, ADP. At least one compound, NADH is known to inhibit this enzyme.
