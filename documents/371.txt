   Exponential polynomial      Exponential polynomial   In mathematics , exponential polynomials are functions on fields , rings , or abelian groups that take the form of polynomials in a variable and an exponential function .  Definition  In fields  An exponential polynomial generally has both a variable x and some kind of exponential function E ( x ). In the complex numbers there is already a canonical exponential function, the function that maps x to e x . In this setting the term exponential polynomial is often used to mean polynomials of the form P ( x , e x ) where P ∈ C [ x , y ] is a polynomial in two variables. 1 2  There is nothing particularly special about C here, exponential polynomials may also refer to such a polynomial on any exponential field or exponential ring with its exponential function taking the place of e x above. 3 Similarly, there is no reason to have one variable, and an exponential polynomial in n variables would be of the form P ( x 1 ,..., x n , e x 1 ,..., e x n ), where P is a polynomial in 2 n variables.  For formal exponential polynomials over a field K we proceed as follows. 4 Let W be a finitely generated Z -submodule of K and consider finite sums of the form        ∑   i  =  1   m     f  i    (  X  )    exp   (    w  i   X   )      ,      superscript   subscript     i  1    m      subscript  f  i   X       subscript  w  i   X       \sum_{i=1}^{m}f_{i}(X)\exp(w_{i}X)\ ,     where the f i are polynomials in K [ X ] and the exp( w i X ) are formal symbols indexed by w i in W subject to exp( u + v ) = exp( u )exp( v ).  In abelian groups  A more general framework where the term exponential polynomial may be found is that of exponential functions on abelian groups. Similarly to how exponential functions on exponential fields are defined, given a topological abelian group  G a homomorphism from G to the additive group of the complex numbers is called an additive function, and a homomorphism to the multiplicative group of nonzero complex numbers is called an exponential function, or simply an exponential. A product of additive functions and exponentials is called an exponential monomial, and a linear combination of these is then an exponential polynomial on G . 5 6  Properties  Ritt's theorem states that the analogues of unique factorization and the factor theorem hold for the ring of exponential polynomials. 7  Applications  Exponential polynomials on R and C often appear in transcendence theory , where they appear as auxiliary functions in proofs involving the exponential function. They also act as a link between model theory and analytic geometry . If one defines an exponential variety to be the set of points in R n where some finite collection of exponential polynomials vanish, then results like Khovanskiǐ's theorem in differential geometry and Wilkie's theorem in model theory show that these varieties are well-behaved in the sense that the collection of such varieties is stable under the various set-theoretic operations as long as one allows the inclusion of the image under projections of higher-dimensional exponential varieties. Indeed, the two aforementioned theorems imply that the set of all exponential varieties forms an o-minimal structure over R .  Notes  "  Category:Polynomials     C. J.
