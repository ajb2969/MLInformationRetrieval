F. J. Duarte

Francisco Javier "Frank" Duarte (born c. 1954) is a Chilean-born laser physicist and author/editor of several well-known books on tunable lasers12345678 and quantum optics.9 He introduced the generalized multiple-prism dispersion theory101112 and has discovered various multiple-prism grating oscillator laser configurations. These contributions have found applications in a variety of fields including:

atomic vapor laser isotope separation,131415
laser medicine,161718
laser microscopy,1920
laser pulse compression,21K. Osvay, A. P. Kovács, G. Kurdi, Z. Heiner, M. Divall, J. Klebniczki, and I. E. Ferincz, Measurement of non-compensated angular dispersion

and the subsequent temporal lengthening of femtosecond pulses in a CPA laser, Opt. Commun. 248, 201-209 (2005).22

Duarte's research has mainly focused on physical and laser optics and has taken place at a number institutions in academia, industry, and the defense establishment.
Research
Laser oscillators
Duarte and Piper introduced the multiple-prism near-grazing-incidence grating cavities originally disclosed as copper-laser-pumped narrow-linewidth tunable laser oscillators.2728 He then introduced multiple-prism grating configurations to high-power CO2 laser oscillators.29 Duarte also developed the theories for narrow-linewidth dispersive laser oscillators, and multiple-prism laser pulse compression, which are summarized in several of his books.30313233
Tunable lasers for isotope separation
The tunable narrow-linewidth laser oscillator configurations, introduced by Duarte and Piper,3435 were adopted by various research groups working on uranium atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS).363738 This work was supported by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission.39 During the course of this research, Duarte writes that he did approach the then federal minister for energy, Sir John Carrick, to advocate for the introduction of an AVLIS facility in Australia.40 In 2002, he participated in research that led to the isotope separation of lithium using narrow-linewidth tunable diode lasers.41
Solid state organic dye lasers
From the mid-1980s to early 1990s Duarte and scientists from the US Army Missile Command developed ruggedized narrow-linewidth laser oscillators tunable directly in the visible spectrum.4243 This constituted the first disclosure, in the open literature, of a tunable narrow-linewidth laser tested on a rugged terrain. This research led to experimentation with polymer gain media and in 1994 Duarte reported on the first narrow-linewidth tunable solid state dye laser oscillators.44 These dispersive oscillator architectures were then refined to yield single-longitudinal-mode emission limited only by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.45
Organic gain media
Joint research, with R. O. James, on solid-state organic-inorganic materials, led to the discovery of polymer-nanoparticle gain media and to the emission of tunable low-divergence homogeneous laser beams from this class of media.46 In 2005, Duarte and colleagues were the first to demonstrate directional coherent emission from an electrically excited organic semiconductor.4748 These experiments utilized a tandem OLED within an interferometric configuration.4950
Duarte's work in this area began with the demonstration of narrow-linewidth laser emission using coumarin-tetramethyl dyes, as molecular gain media,5152 which offer high conversion efficiency and wide tunability in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum.53
Interferometry and quantum optics

155 px|thumb|right|Duarte and colleagues demonstrated the superposition of diffraction patterns over N-slit interferograms. This interferogram corresponds to the interferometric character b (N = 3 slits) and exhibits a diffraction pattern superimposed on the right outer wing (see text).

In the late 1980s, Duarte invented the N-slit laser interferometer and applied Dirac’s notation to describe quantum mechanically its interferometric and propagation characteristics.54555657 This research also led to the generalized N-slit interferometric equation that was then applied to describe classical optics phenomena such as interference, diffraction, refraction, and reflection, in a rational and unified quantum approach.5859 Duarte also derived the cavity linewidth equation, for dispersive laser oscillators, using quantum mechanical principles.60
More recently, Duarte and colleagues have developed very large N-slit laser interferometers to generate and propagate interferometric characters for secure free-space optical communications.6162 Interferometric characters is a term coined in 2002 to link interefometric signals to alphanumerical characters (see figure's legend).63 These experiments have also provided the first observation of diffraction patterns superimposed over propagating interference signals, thus demonstrating non-destructive (or soft) interception of propagating interferograms.64
A spin-off of this research, with applications to the aviation industry, resulted from the discovery that N-slit laser interferometers are very efficient and effective detectors of clear air turbulence.6566
Duarte provides a description of quantum optics, almost entirely via Dirac's notation, in his book Quantum Optics for Engineers.67 In this book he derives the probability amplitude for quantum entanglement,



which he calls the Pryce-Ward probability amplitude, from an N-slit interferometric perspective. Duarte also emphasizes a pragmatic non-interpretational approach to quantum mechanics.68
Career
Macquarie University
At Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia), Duarte studied quantum physics under John Clive Ward and semiconductor physics under Ronald Ernest Aitchison. His PhD research was on laser physics and his supervisor was James A. Piper.69
He also established and led the successful Macquarie science reform movement,7071 that transformed the degree structure of the university. Macquarie's science reform, was widely supported by local scientists including physicists R. E. Aitchison, R. E. B. Makinson, A. W. Pryor, and J. C. Ward.72 In 1980, Duarte was elected as one of the Macquarie representatives to the Australian Union of Students from where he was expelled, and then reinstated, for "running over the tables."73
Following completion of his PhD work, Duarte did post doctoral research, with B. J. Orr at the University of New South Wales, and then back at Macquarie University.
American phase
In 1983, Duarte traveled to the United States to assume a physics professorship at the University of Alabama. In 1985 he joined the Imaging Research Laboratories, at the Eastman Kodak Company, where he remained until 2006. While at Kodak he was chairman of Lasers '87 and subsequent conferences in this series.74 Duarte has had a long association with the US Army Missile Command and the US Army Aviation and Missile Command, where he has participated (with R. W. Conrad75 and T. S. Taylor76) in directed energy research. In 2006, he founded Interferometric Optics.77
He was elected Fellow of the Australian Institute of Physics (1987) and Fellow of the Optical Society of America (1993) for his contributions to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. He is the first South American to have received such distinctions. Subsequently, he received the Engineering Excellence Award from the Optical Society of America for the invention of the N-slit laser interferometer. Duarte's contributions are cited in more than one hundred and fifty scholarly books, including several classics.
Personal
Duarte was born in Santiago, Chile, and traveled to Sydney, Australia, as a teenager. There, he lived first in Strathfield and then in the northern small town of Cowan. In the United States he resided for a brief period in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and then moved to Western New York.78
