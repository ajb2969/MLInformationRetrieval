   Reeve tetrahedron      Reeve tetrahedron   In geometry , the Reeve tetrahedron is a polyhedron , named after John Reeve , in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   with vertices at    (  0  ,  0  ,  0  )     0  0  0    (0,0,0)   ,    (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )     1  0  0    (1,0,0)   ,    (  0  ,  1  ,  0  )     0  1  0    (0,1,0)   , and    (  1  ,  1  ,  r  )     1  1  r    (1,1,r)   where   r   r   r   is a positive integer. Each vertex lies on a fundamental lattice point (a point in    ℤ  3     superscript  ℤ  3    \mathbb{Z}^{3}   ). No other fundamental lattice points lie on the surface or in the interior of the tetrahedron . In 1957 Reeve used this tetrahedron as a counterexample to show that there is no simple equivalent of Pick's theorem in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   or higher-dimensional spaces. 1 This is seen by noticing that Reeve tetrahedra have the same number of interior and boundary points for any value of   r   r   r   , but different volumes.  The Ehrhart polynomial of the Reeve tetrahedron    𝒯  r     subscript  𝒯  r    \mathcal{T}_{r}   of height   r   r   r   is       L   (   𝒯  r   ,  t  )    =     r  6    t  3    +   t  2   +    (   2  -   r  6    )   t   +  1.         L    subscript  𝒯  r   t          r  6    superscript  t  3     superscript  t  2       2    r  6    t   1.     L(\mathcal{T}_{r},t)=\frac{r}{6}t^{3}+t^{2}+\left(2-\frac{r}{6}\right)t+1.    2 Thus, for    r  ≥  13      r  13    r\geq 13   , the Ehrhart polynomial of    𝒯  r     subscript  𝒯  r    \mathcal{T}_{r}   has a negative coefficient.
