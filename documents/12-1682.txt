Reeve tetrahedron

In geometry, the Reeve tetrahedron is a polyhedron, named after John Reeve, in 
 
 
 
  with vertices at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer. Each vertex lies on a fundamental lattice point (a point in 
 
 
 
 ). No other fundamental lattice points lie on the surface or in the interior of the tetrahedron. In 1957 Reeve used this tetrahedron as a counterexample to show that there is no simple equivalent of Pick's theorem in 
 
 
 
  or higher-dimensional spaces.1 This is seen by noticing that Reeve tetrahedra have the same number of interior and boundary points for any value of 
 
 
 
 
 , but different volumes.
The Ehrhart polynomial of the Reeve tetrahedron 
 
 
 
  of height 
 
 
 
  is


2 Thus, for 
 
 
 
 , the Ehrhart polynomial of 
 
 
 
 
  has a negative coefficient.
