   Papyrus 45      Papyrus 45   Papyrus 45 (    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 or P. Chester Beatty I ) is an early New Testament manuscript which is a part of the Chester Beatty Papyri . It was probably created around 250 in Egypt . 1 It contains the texts of Matthew 20-21 and 25-26; Mark 4-9 and 11-12; Luke 6-7 and 9-14; John 4-5 and 10-11; and Acts 4-17. The manuscript is currently housed at the Chester Beatty Library , Dublin , Ireland , except for one leaf containing Matt. 25:41-26:39 which is at the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek , Vienna ( Pap. Vindob. G. 31974). 2 3  Condition of the manuscript  The manuscript is heavily damaged and fragmented. The papyrus was bound in a codex , which may have consisted of 220 pages, however only 30 survive (two of Matthew, six of Mark, seven of Luke, two of John, and 13 of Acts). All of the pages have lacunae , with very few lines complete. The leaves of Matthew and John are the smallest. The original pages were roughly 10 inches by 8 inches. Unlike many of the other surviving manuscripts from the 3rd century which usually contained just the Gospels, or just the Catholic letters, or just the Pauline epistles, this manuscript possibly contained more than one grouping of New Testament texts. This hypothesis is attributed to the use of gatherings of two leaves, a single- quire that most other codices had. 4  Textual character  Because of the extent of the damage, determining the text's type has been difficult for scholars. The manuscript was obtained by Alfred Chester Beatty in the first half of the 20th century, and published in The Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri, Descriptions and Texts of Twelve Manuscripts on Papyrus of the Greek Bible by Frederic G. Kenyon in 1933. In this work, Kenyon identified the text of the Gospel of Mark in P45 as Caesarean , following the definition of Burnett Hillman Streeter . 5 Hollis Huston criticized Kenyon's transcription of various partially surviving words, and concluded that chapters 6 and 11 of Mark in   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 could not neatly fit into one text-type, especially not Caesarean, because the manuscript predates the distinctive texts for each type from the 4th and 5th centuries. 6  It has a great number of singular readings. 7  Text-type     𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 has a relatively close statistical relationship with Codex Washingtonianus in Mark, however, and to a lesser extent Family 13 . Citing Larry Hurtado's study, Text-Critical Methodology and the Pre-Caesarean Text: Codex W in the Gospel of Mark, 8 Eldon Jay Epp has agreed that there is no connection to a Caesarean or pre-Caesarean text in Mark. There is also not a strong connection to the Neutral text of Codex Vaticanus , the Western text of Codex Bezae , and the Byzantine text of the textus receptus . 9 Another hypothesis is that "   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 comes from the Alexandrian tradition, but has many readings intended to "improve" the text stylistically, and a number of harmonizations. While still difficult to place historically in a category of texts, most scholars today agree that the text is not Caesarean, contrary to Kenyon.  The textual character of the manuscript varies from book to book. In Mark, multivariate analysis of apparatus data from the UBS Greek New Testament (4th ed.) 10 places   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 in a group which includes W (for chapters 5-16), Θ, Family 1, 28, 205, 565; the Sinaitic Syriac, Armenian, and Georgian versions; and Origen's quotations. 11 This group corresponds to what Streeter called an "Eastern type" of the text. 12 In Luke, an eleven-way PAM partition based on Greek manuscript data associated with the INTF's Parallel Pericopes volume 13 places the manuscript in a group with C (04), L (019) , Ξ (040) , 33, 892, and 1241. 14 In Acts it is closest to the Alexandrian text.  It is calculated that the codex omitted the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11). 15  Notable readings  Mark 6:40 omits text κατὰ ἑκατὸν καὶ κατὰ πεντήκοντα ( by fifties and by hundreds )  Mark 6:44 omits text τοὺς ἄρτους ( those loaves ) with א  D  W  Θ  f 1  f 13  28  565  700 2542 lat cop sa  Mark 6:45 omits text εἰς τὸ πέραν ( to the other side ) with W f 1  118 it q syr s  Mark 8:12 omits text λέγω ὑμῖν ( I will tell you ) with W  Mark 8:15 reads των Ηρωδιανων ( the Herodians ) with W Θ f 1,13  28 565 1365 2542 it i . k cop sa mss arm geo  Mark 8:35 reads ἕνεκεν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ( for the sake of the Gospel ) omitting ἐμοῦ καὶ ( of me and ) as in D 28 700 it a.b.d.i.k.n.r 1 syr s arm Origen  Mark 9:27 omits text καὶ ἀνέστη ( and he arose ) with W it k.l syr p  Luke 6:48   διὰ τὸ καλῶς οἰκοδομῆσθαι αὐτήν ( because it had been well built ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 vid א B L W Ξ 33 157 579 892 1241 1342 2542 syr h mg cop sa cop bo pt   τεθεμελίωτο γὰρ ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν ( for it had been founded upon that rock ) — A C D Θ Ψ  f 1,13 700 c Byz latt syr p.h cop bo pt arm, geo, goth  omitted —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 vid 700* syr s    Luke 11:33 omits text οὐδὲ ὑπὸ τὸν μόδιον ( nor under a basket ) with   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75  L  Γ Ξ 070  f 1  22  69 700* 788 1241 2542 syr s cop sa arm, geo  Luke 11:44 omits text γραμματεις και Φαρισαιοι υποκριται ( scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ) with   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 א B C L f 1 33 1241 2542 it a.aur.c.e.ff 2 .l  vg syr s,c cop sa cop bo pt arm geo  Luke 11:54 omits text ινα κατηγορησωσιν αυτου ( in order that they might accuse him ) with   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    75 א B L 579 892* 1241 2542 syr s,c co  Luke 12:9 omitted, as in it e syr s cop bo ms  Luke 12:47 omits text μὴ ἑτοιμάσας ἢ ( not preparing or )  John 11:7 omits text τοῖς μαθηταῖς ( the disciples ) with   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    66* it e.l  John 11:25 omits text καὶ ἡ ζωή ( and the life ) with it l syr s  Diatessaron syr  Cyprian  John 11:51 omits text τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐκείνου ( of that year ) with it e.l syr s  Acts 5:37 omits text πάντες ( all ) with D it  Acts 8:18 adds text το αγιον ( the holy ) with   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 A* C D E Ψ 33 1739  Byz latt syr cop bo  Acts 9:17   Ἰησοῦς ( Jesus ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 א A B C E Ψ 33 81  323  614 945 1175 1739  omitted — Byz   Acts 9:21 omits text οἱ ἀκούοντες ( those hearing ) with   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 Ψ*  Acts 9:38   δύο ἄνδρας ( two men ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 א A B C E Ψ 36 81 323 614 945 1175 1739 latt syr co  omitted — Byz   Acts 10:10   ἐγένετο ( became ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 vid א A B C 36 81 323 453 945 1175 1739 Origen  επεπεσεν ( fell into ) — E Ψ 33 Byz latt syr  ηλθεν ( entered ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45    Acts 10:13 omits text Πέτρε ( Peter ) with gig  Clement  Ambrose  Acts 10:16 omits text εὐθὺς ( immediately ) with 36 453 1175 it d syr p cop sa mss  Acts 10:33   κυρίου ( the Lord ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 vid א A B C E Ψ 81* 323 614 945 1175 1739 lat syr h cop bo   θεου ( God ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 D Byz syr p cop sa mae   Acts 11:12 omits text μηδὲν διακρίναντα ( without deliberating ) with D it l.p* syr h  Acts 13:48   κυρίου ( the Lord ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 א A C Ψ 33 1739 Byz gig vg cop sa mss mae  θεου ( God ) — B D E 049 323 453 cop bo   θεον ( God ) — 614 syr   Acts 13:49 omits text τοῦ κυρίου ( the Lord )  Acts 15:20 omits text καὶ τῆς πορνείας ( and sexual immorality )  Acts 15:40   τοῦ κυρίου ( the Lord ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 א A B D 33 81 it d vgst cop sa   τοῦ θεου ( God ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45 C E Ψ 1739 Byz gig it w vg cl syr cop bo    Acts 16:32   τοῦ κυρίου ( the Lord ) —   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    45    𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    74 א 2 A C (D) E Ψ 33 1739 Byz lat syr cop  τοῦ θεου ( God ) — א* B   Acts 17:13 omits text καὶ ταράσσοντες ( and agitated ) with E Byz  See also   List of New Testament papyri  Chester Beatty Papyri   Notes and references  Further reading   Frederic G.
