   Arginine kinase      Arginine kinase   In enzymology , an arginine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + N ω -phospho-L-arginine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-arginine , whereas its two products are ADP and N ω -phospho-L-arginine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-arginine N ω -phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include arginine phosphokinase , adenosine 5'-triphosphate: L-arginine phosphotransferase , adenosine 5'-triphosphate-arginine phosphotransferase , ATP:L-arginine N-phosphotransferasel ATP:L-arginine , and ω-N-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
