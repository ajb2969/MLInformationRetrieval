   Polynomial identity ring      Polynomial identity ring   In mathematics , in the subfield of ring theory , a ring R is a polynomial identity ring if there is, for some N > 0, an element P other than 0 of the free algebra , Z1, X 2 , ..., X N >, over the ring of integers in N variables X 1 , X 2 , ..., X N such that for all N - tuples  r 1 , r 2 , ..., r N taken from R it happens that       P   (   r  1   ,   r  2   ,  …  ,   r  N   )    =  0.        P    subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2   normal-…   subscript  r  N     0.    P(r_{1},r_{2},\ldots,r_{N})=0.     Strictly the X i here are "non-commuting indeterminates", and so "polynomial identity" is a slight abuse of language , since "polynomial" here stands for what is usually called a "non-commutative polynomial". The abbreviation PI-ring is common. More generally, the free algebra over any ring S may be used, and gives the concept of PI-algebra .  If the degree of the polynomial P is defined in the usual way, the polynomial P is called monic if at least one of its terms of highest degree has coefficient equal to 1.  Every commutative ring is a PI-ring, satisfying the polynomial identity XY - YX = 0. Therefore PI-rings are usually taken as close generalizations of commutative rings . If the ring has characteristic  p different from zero then it satisfies the polynomial identity pX = 0. To exclude such examples, sometimes it is defined that PI-rings must satisfy a monic polynomial identity. 1  Examples   For example if R is a commutative ring it is a PI-ring: this is true with          P   (   X  1   ,   X  2   )    =     X  1    X  2    -    X  2    X  1     =   0           P    subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2          subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2       subscript  X  2    subscript  X  1          0     P(X_{1},X_{2})=X_{1}X_{2}-X_{2}X_{1}=0~{}         The ring of 2 by 2 matrices over a commutative ring satisfies the Hall identity            (    x  y   -   y  x    )   2   z   =   z    (    x  y   -   y  x    )   2           superscript      x  y     y  x    2   z     z   superscript      x  y     y  x    2      (xy-yx)^{2}z=z(xy-yx)^{2}       This identity was used by , but was found earlier by .    A major role is played in the theory by the standard identity  s N , of length N , which generalises the example given for commutative rings ( N = 2). It derives from the Leibniz formula for determinants          det   (  A  )    =    ∑   σ  ∈   S  N       sgn   (  σ  )      ∏   i  =  1   N    a   i  ,   σ   (  i  )               A     subscript     σ   subscript  S  N        sgn  σ     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    N    subscript  a   i    σ  i          \det(A)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_{N}}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\prod_{i=1}^{N}a_{i,%
 \sigma(i)}         by replacing each product in the summand by the product of the X i in the order given by the permutation σ. In other words each of the N ! orders is summed, and the coefficient is 1 or −1 according to the signature .           s  N    (   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  N   )    =    ∑   σ  ∈   S  N       sgn   (  σ  )     X   σ   (  1  )     ⋯   X   σ   (  N  )       =   0            subscript  s  N     subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  N       subscript     σ   subscript  S  N        sgn  σ    subscript  X    σ  1    normal-⋯   subscript  X    σ  N           0     s_{N}(X_{1},\ldots,X_{N})=\sum_{\sigma\in S_{N}}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)X_{%
 \sigma(1)}\cdots X_{\sigma(N)}=0~{}         The m × m  matrix ring over any commutative ring satisfies a standard identity: the Amitsur–Levitzki theorem states that it satisfies s 2 m . The degree of this identity is optimal since the matrix ring can not satisfy any monic polynomial of degree less than 2 m .    Given a field k of characteristic zero, take R to be the exterior algebra over a countably infinite -dimensional vector space with basis e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , ... Then R is generated by the elements of this basis and     e i e j = − e j e i .      This ring does not satisfy s N for any N and therefore can not be embedded in any matrix ring. In fact s N ( e 1 , e 2 ,..., e N ) = N ! e 1 e 2 ... e N ≠ 0. On the other hand it is a PI-ring since it satisfies [[ x , y ], z ] := xyz − yxz − zxy + zyx = 0. It is enough to check this for monomials in the e 's. Now, a monomial of even degree commutes with every element. Therefore if either x or y is a monomial of even degree [ x , y ] := xy − yx = 0. If both are of odd degree then [ x , y ] = xy − yx = 2 xy has even degree and therefore commutes with z , i.e. [[ x , y ], z ] = 0.   Properties   Any subring or homomorphic image of a PI-ring is a PI-ring.  A finite direct product of PI-rings is a PI-ring.  A direct product of PI-rings, satisfying the same identity, is a PI-ring.  It can always be assumed that the identity that the PI-ring satisfies is multilinear .  If a ring is finitely generated by n elements as a module over its center then it satisfies every alternating multilinear polynomial of degree larger than n . In particular it satisfies s N for N > n and therefore it is a PI-ring.  If R and S are PI-rings then their tensor product over the integers,    R   ⊗  ℤ   S      subscript  tensor-product  ℤ   R  S    R\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}S   , is also a PI-ring.  If R is a PI-ring, then so is the ring of n × n -matrices with coefficients in R .   PI-rings as generalizations of commutative rings  Among noncommutative rings, PI-rings satisfy the Köthe conjecture . Affine PI-algebras over a field satisfy the Kurosh conjecture , the Nullstellensatz and the catenary property for prime ideals .  If R is a PI-ring and K is a subring of its center such that R is integal over  K then the going up and going down properties for prime ideals of R and K are satisfied. Also the lying over property (If p is a prime ideal of K then there is a prime ideal P of R such that   p   p   p   is minimal over    P  ∩  K      P  K    P\cap K   ) and the incomparability property (If P and Q are prime ideals of R and    P  ⊂  Q      P  Q    P\subset Q   then     P  ∩  K   ⊂   Q  ∩  K         P  K     Q  K     P\cap K\subset Q\cap K   ) are satisfied.  The set of identities a PI-ring satisfies  If F := Z1, X 2 , ..., X N > is the free algebra in N variables and R is a PI-ring satisfying the polynomial P in N variables, then P is in the kernel of any homomorphism     τ   τ   \tau   :F   →   normal-→   \rightarrow    R .  An ideal I of F is called T-ideal if     f   (  I  )    ⊂  I        f  I   I    f(I)\subset I   for every endomorphism  f of F .  Given a PI-ring, R , the set of all polynomial identities it satisfies is an ideal but even more it is a T-ideal. Conversely, if I is a T-ideal of F then F / I is a PI-ring satisfying all identities in I . It is assumed that I contains monic polynomials when PI-rings are required to satisfy monic polynomial identities.
