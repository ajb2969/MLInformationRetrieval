All-trans-octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase

All-trans-octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (, octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, octaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase, polyprenylpyrophosphate synthetase, terpenoidallyltransferase, terpenyl pyrophosphate synthetase, trans-heptaprenyltranstransferase, trans-prenyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate farnesyltranstransferase (adding 5 isopentenyl units).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + 5 isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  5 diphosphate + all-trans-octaprenyl diphosphate
 

This enzyme catalyses the condensation reactions resulting in the formation of all-trans-octaprenyl diphosphate.
