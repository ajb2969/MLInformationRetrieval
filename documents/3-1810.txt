   Hurewicz theorem      Hurewicz theorem   In mathematics , the Hurewicz theorem is a basic result of algebraic topology , connecting homotopy theory with homology theory via a map known as the Hurewicz homomorphism . The theorem is named after Witold Hurewicz , and generalizes earlier results of Henri Poincaré .  Statement of the theorems  The Hurewicz theorems are a key link between homotopy groups and homology groups .  Absolute version  For any space X and positive integer k there exists a group homomorphism       h  ∗   :     π  k    (  X  )    →    H  k    (  X  )        normal-:   subscript  h  normal-∗    normal-→     subscript  π  k   X      subscript  H  k   X      h_{\ast}\colon\,\pi_{k}(X)\to H_{k}(X)\,\!     called the Hurewicz homomorphism from the k -th homotopy group to the k -th homology group (with integer coefficients), which for k = 1 and X  path-connected is equivalent to the canonical abelianization map        h  ∗   :     π  1    (  X  )    →     π  1    (  X  )    /   [    π  1    (  X  )    ,    π  1    (  X  )    ]      .     normal-:   subscript  h  normal-∗    normal-→     subscript  π  1   X        subscript  π  1   X       subscript  π  1   X      subscript  π  1   X        h_{\ast}\colon\,\pi_{1}(X)\to\pi_{1}(X)/[\pi_{1}(X),\pi_{1}(X)].\,\!     The Hurewicz theorem states that if X is ( n − 1)-connected , the Hurewicz map is an isomorphism for all k ≤ n when n ≥ 2 and abelianization for n = 1 . In particular, this theorem says that the abelianization of the first homotopy group (the fundamental group ) is isomorphic to the first homology group:         H  1    (  X  )    ≅     π  1    (  X  )    /   [    π  1    (  X  )    ,    π  1    (  X  )    ]     .         subscript  H  1   X        subscript  π  1   X       subscript  π  1   X      subscript  π  1   X       H_{1}(X)\cong\pi_{1}(X)/[\pi_{1}(X),\pi_{1}(X)].\,\!     The first homology group therefore vanishes if X is path-connected and π 1 ( X ) is a perfect group .  In addition, the Hurewicz homomorphism is an epimorphism from      π   n  +  1     (  X  )    →    H   n  +  1     (  X  )       normal-→     subscript  π    n  1    X      subscript  H    n  1    X     \pi_{n+1}(X)\to H_{n+1}(X)   whenever X is ( n − 1)-connected, for    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   .  The group homomorphism is given in the following way. Choose canonical generators     u  n   ∈    H  n    (   S  n   )         subscript  u  n      subscript  H  n    superscript  S  n      u_{n}\in H_{n}(S^{n})   . Then a homotopy class of maps    f  ∈    π  n    (  X  )        f     subscript  π  n   X     f\in\pi_{n}(X)   is taken to      f  *    (   u  n   )    ∈    H  n    (  X  )           subscript  f     subscript  u  n       subscript  H  n   X     f_{*}(u_{n})\in H_{n}(X)   .  Relative version  For any pair of spaces ( X , A ) and integer k > 1 there exists a homomorphism       h  ∗   :     π  k    (  X  ,  A  )    →    H  k    (  X  ,  A  )        normal-:   subscript  h  normal-∗    normal-→     subscript  π  k    X  A       subscript  H  k    X  A       h_{\ast}\colon\pi_{k}(X,A)\to H_{k}(X,A)\,\!     from relative homotopy groups to relative homology groups. The Relative Hurewicz Theorem states that if each of X , A are connected and the pair ( X , A ) is ( n −1)-connected then H k ( X , A ) = 0 for k  n ( X , A ) is obtained from π n ( X , A ) by factoring out the action of π 1 ( A ). This is proved in, for example,  by induction, proving in turn the absolute version and the Homotopy Addition Lemma.  This relative Hurewicz theorem is reformulated by  as a statement about the morphism         π  n    (  X  ,  A  )    →    π  n    (   X  ∪   C  A    )     .     normal-→     subscript  π  n    X  A       subscript  π  n     X    C  A       \pi_{n}(X,A)\to\pi_{n}(X\cup CA)\,\!.     This statement is a special case of a homotopical excision theorem , involving induced modules for n>2 (crossed modules if n=2), which itself is deduced from a higher homotopy van Kampen theorem for relative homotopy groups, whose proof requires development of techniques of a cubical higher homotopy groupoid of a filtered space.  Triadic version  For any triad of spaces ( X ; A , B ) (i.e. space X and subspaces A , B ) and integer k > 2 there exists a homomorphism       h  ∗   :     π  k    (  X  ;  A  ,  B  )    →    H  k    (  X  ;  A  ,  B  )        normal-:   subscript  h  normal-∗    normal-→     subscript  π  k    X  A  B       subscript  H  k    X  A  B       h_{\ast}\colon\pi_{k}(X;A,B)\to H_{k}(X;A,B)\,\!     from triad homotopy groups to triad homology groups. Note that H k ( X ; A , B ) ≅ H k ( X ∪( C ( A ∪ B )). The Triadic Hurewicz Theorem states that if X , A , B , and C = A ∩ B are connected, the pairs ( A , C ), ( B , C ) are respectively ( p −1)-, ( q −1)-connected, and the triad ( X ; A , B ) is p + q −2 connected, then H k ( X ; A , B ) = 0 for k  p + q −1( X ; A ) is obtained from π p + q −1 ( X ; A , B ) by factoring out the action of π 1 ( A ∩ B ) and the generalised Whitehead products. The proof of this theorem uses a higher homotopy van Kampen type theorem for triadic homotopy groups, which requires a notion of the fundamental cat n -group of an n -cube of spaces.  Simplicial set version  The Hurewicz theorem for topological spaces can also be stated for n -connected simplicial sets satisfying the Kan condition. 1  Rational Hurewicz theorem  Rational Hurewicz theorem: 2 3 Let X be a simply connected topological space with       π  i    (  X  )    ⊗  ℚ   =  0       tensor-product     subscript  π  i   X   ℚ   0    \pi_{i}(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}=0   for    i  ≤  r      i  r    i\leq r   .
