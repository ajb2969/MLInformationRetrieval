== Summary == Energy band diagram of a simple NPN bipolar junction transistor in forward-active mode showing electron energy versus position. The depletion regions of the emitter-base and base-collector junctions are marked. 
 
 
 
  is the conduction band, 
 
 
 
  indicates the quasi-fermi energy levels, 
 
 
 
  is the intrinsic Fermi level of the undoped semiconductor, and 
 
 
 
  is the valence band. This band alignment is due to the biasing conditions that correspond with forward-active mode; forward bias on the emitter-base junction and reverse bias on the base-collector junction.
