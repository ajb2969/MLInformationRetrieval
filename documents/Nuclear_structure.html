<h1>Nuclear structure</h1>

<p>Understanding the structure of the <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">atomic nucleus</a> is one of the central challenges in <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-liquid-drop-model">The liquid drop model</h2>

<p>The liquid drop model is one of the first models of <strong>nuclear structure</strong>, proposed by <a href="Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizsäcker" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker</a> in 1935.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It describes the nucleus as a <a href="fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">semiclassical fluid</a> made up of <a href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutrons</a> and <a href="proton" title="wikilink">protons</a>, with an internal repulsive <a href="electric_force" title="wikilink">electrostatic force</a> proportional to the number of protons. The <a href="Quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanical</a> nature of these particles appears via the <a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, which states that no two nucleons of the same kind can be at the same <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">state</a>. Thus the fluid is actually what is known as a <a href="Fermi_liquid" title="wikilink">Fermi liquid</a>. In this model, the binding energy of a nucleus with

 and the strength of the pairing term may be estimated theoretically, or fit to data. This simple model reproduces the main features of the <a href="binding_energy" title="wikilink">binding energy</a> of nuclei.</p>

<p>The assumption of nucleus as a drop of <a href="Fermi_liquid" title="wikilink">Fermi liquid</a> is still widely used in the form of Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM), due to the possible good reproduction of nuclear binding energy on the whole chart, with the necessary accuracy for predictions of unknown nuclei.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="the-shell-model">The shell model</h2>

<p>The expression "shell model" is ambiguous in that it refers to two different eras in the state of the art. It was previously used to describe the existence of nucleon shells in the nucleus according to an approach closer to what is now called <a href="nuclear_structure#Mean_field_theories" title="wikilink">mean field theory</a>. Nowadays, it refers to a formalism analogous to the <a href="configuration_interaction" title="wikilink">configuration interaction</a> formalism used in <a href="quantum_chemistry" title="wikilink">quantum chemistry</a>. We shall introduce the latter here.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-the-shell-concept">Introduction to the shell concept</h3>

<p> Systematic measurements of the <a href="binding_energy" title="wikilink">binding energy</a> of atomic nuclei show systematic deviations with respect to those estimated from the liquid drop model. In particular, some nuclei having certain values for the number of protons and/or neutrons are bound more tightly together than predicted by the liquid drop model. These nuclei are called singly/doubly <a href="magic_number_(physics)" title="wikilink">magic</a>. This observation led scientists to assume the existence of a shell structure of <a href="nucleon" title="wikilink">nucleons</a> (protons and neutrons) within the nucleus, like that of <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> within atoms.</p>

<p>Indeed nucleons are <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum objects</a>. Strictly speaking, one should not speak of energies of individual nucleons, because they are all correlated with each other. However as an approximation one may envision an average nucleus, within which nucleons propagate individually. Owing to their quantum character, they may only occupy <em>discrete</em> <a href="energy_level" title="wikilink">energy levels</a>. These levels are by no means uniformly distributed; some intervals of energy are crowded, and some are empty, generating a gap in possible energies. A shell is such a set of levels separated from the other ones by a wide empty gap.</p>

<p>The energy levels are found by solving the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a> for a single nucleon moving in the average potential generated by all other nucleons. Each level may be occupied by a nucleon, or empty. Some levels accommodate several different quantum states with the same energy; they are said to be <em>degenerate</em>. This occurs in particular if the average nucleus has some <a class="uri" href="symmetry" title="wikilink">symmetry</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of shells allows one to understand why some nuclei are bound more tightly than others. This is because two nucleons of the same kind cannot be in the same state (<a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a>). So the lowest-energy state of the nucleus is one where nucleons fill all energy levels from the bottom up to some level. A nucleus with full shells is exceptionally stable, as will be explained.</p>

<p>As with electrons in the <a href="electron_shell" title="wikilink">electron shell</a> model, protons in the outermost shell are relatively loosely bound to the nucleus if there are only few protons in that shell, because they are farthest from the center of the nucleus. Therefore nuclei which have a full outer proton shell will be more tightly bound and have a higher binding energy than other nuclei with a similar total number of protons. All this is also true for neutrons.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the energy needed to excite the nucleus (i.e. moving a nucleon to a higher, previously unoccupied level) is exceptionally high in such nuclei. Whenever this unoccupied level is the next after a full shell, the only way to excite the nucleus is to raise one nucleon <em>across the gap</em>, thus spending a large amount of energy. Otherwise, if the highest occupied energy level lies in a partly filled shell, much less energy is required to raise a nucleon to a higher state in the same shell.</p>

<p>Some evolution of the shell structure observed in stable nuclei is expected away from the <a href="valley_of_stability" title="wikilink">valley of stability</a>. For example, observations of unstable <a class="uri" href="isotopes" title="wikilink">isotopes</a> have shown shifting and even a reordering of the single particle levels of which the shell structure is composed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This is sometimes observed as the creation of an <a href="island_of_inversion" title="wikilink">island of inversion</a> or in the reduction of excitation energy gaps above the traditional magic numbers.</p>
<h3 id="basic-hypotheses">Basic hypotheses</h3>

<p>Some basic hypotheses are made in order to give a precise conceptual framework to the shell model :</p>
<ul>
<li>The atomic nucleus is a <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum</a> <em>n</em>-body system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The internal motion of nucleons within the nucleus is non-relativistic, and their behavior is governed by the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nucleons are considered to be pointlike, without any internal structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="brief-description-of-the-formalism">Brief description of the formalism</h3>

<p>The general process used in the shell model calculations is the following. First a <a href="Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> for the nucleus is defined. Usually, for computational practicality, only one- and two-body terms are taken into account in this definition. The interaction is an <a href="effective_field_theory" title="wikilink">effective theory</a> : it contains free parameters which have to be fitted with experimental data.</p>

<p>The next step consists in defining a <a href="basis_(linear_algebra)" title="wikilink">basis</a> of single-particle states, i.e. a set of <a href="wavefunction" title="wikilink">wavefunctions</a> describing all possible nucleon states. Most of the time, this basis is obtained via a <a class="uri" href="Hartree–Fock" title="wikilink">Hartree–Fock</a> computation. With this set of one-particle states, <a href="Slater_determinant" title="wikilink">Slater determinants</a> are built, that is, wavefunctions for <em>Z</em> proton variables or <em>N</em> neutron variables, which are antisymmetrized products of single-particle wavefunctions (antisymmetrized meaning that under exchange of variables for any pair of nucleons, the wavefunction only changes sign).</p>

<p>In principle, the number of <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">quantum states</a> available for a single nucleon at a finite energy is finite, say <em>n</em>. The number of nucleons in the nucleus must be smaller than the number of available states, otherwise the nucleus cannot hold all of its nucleons. There are thus several ways to choose <em>Z</em> (or <em>N</em>) states among the <em>n</em> possible. In <a href="combinatorial_mathematics" title="wikilink">combinatorial mathematics</a>, the number of choices of <em>Z</em> objects among <em>n</em> is the <a href="binomial_coefficient" title="wikilink">binomial coefficient</a> C. If <em>n</em> is much larger than <em>Z</em> (or <em>N</em>), this increases roughly like <em>n</em><sup><em>Z</em></sup>. Practically, this number becomes so large that every computation is impossible for <em>A</em>=<em>N</em>+<em>Z</em> larger than 8.</p>

<p>To obviate this difficulty, the space of possible single-particle states is divided into a core and a valence shell, by analogy with <a href="electron_shell#Valence_shells" title="wikilink">chemistry</a>. The core is a set of single-particles which are assumed to be inactive, in the sense that they are the well bound lowest-energy states, and that there is no need to reexamine their situation. They do not appear in the Slater determinants, contrary to the states in the valence space, which is the space of all single-particle states <em>not in the core</em>, but possibly to be considered in the choice of the build of the (<em>Z</em>-) <em>N</em>-body wavefunction. The set of all possible Slater determinants in the valence space defines a <a href="basis_(linear_algebra)" title="wikilink">basis</a> for (<em>Z</em>-) <em>N</em>-body states.</p>

<p>The last step consists in computing the matrix of the Hamiltonian within this basis, and to diagonalize it. In spite of the reduction of the dimension of the basis owing to the fixation of the core, the matrices to be diagonalized reach easily dimensions of the order of 10<sup>9</sup>, and demand specific diagonalization techniques.</p>

<p>The shell model calculations give in general an excellent fit with experimental data. They depend however strongly on two main factors :</p>
<ul>
<li>The way to divide the single-particle space into core and valence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The effective nucleon–nucleon interaction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mean-field-theories">Mean field theories</h2>
<h3 id="the-independent-particle-model">The independent-particle model</h3>

<p>The <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">interaction between nucleons</a>, which is a consequence of <a href="strong_interaction" title="wikilink">strong interactions</a> and binds the nucleons within the nucleus, exhibits the peculiar behaviour of having a finite range: it vanishes when the distance between two nucleons becomes too large; it is attractive at medium range, and repulsive at very small range. This last property correlates with the <a href="Pauli_exclusion_principle" title="wikilink">Pauli exclusion principle</a> according to which two <a href="fermion" title="wikilink">fermions</a> (nucleons are fermions) cannot be in the same quantum state. This results in a very large <a href="mean_free_path" title="wikilink">mean free path</a> predicted for a nucleon within the nucleus.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The main idea of the Independent Particle approach is that a nucleon moves inside a certain potential well (which keeps it bound to the nucleus) independently from the other nucleons. This amounts to replacing a <em>N</em>-body problem (<em>N</em> particles interacting) by <em>N</em> single-body problems. This essential simplification of the problem is the cornerstone of mean field theories. These are also widely used in <a href="atomic_physics" title="wikilink">atomic physics</a>, where electrons move in a mean field due to the central nucleus and the electron cloud itself.</p>

<p>The independent particle model and mean field theories (we shall see that there exist several variants) have a great success in describing the properties o the nucleus starting from an effective interaction or an effective potential, thus are a basic part of atomic nucleus theory. One should also notice that they are modular enough, in that it is quite easy to <a href="Nuclear_structure#Extensions_of_the_mean_field_theories" title="wikilink">extend the model</a> to introduce effects such as nuclear pairing, or collective motions of the nucleon like <a class="uri" href="rotation" title="wikilink">rotation</a>, or <a class="uri" href="vibration" title="wikilink">vibration</a>, adding the corresponding energy terms in the formalism. This implies that in many representation the mean field is only a starting point for a more complete description which introduces correlations reproducing properties like collective excitations and nucleon transfer.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nuclear-potential-and-effective-interaction">Nuclear potential and effective interaction</h3>

<p>A large part of the practical difficulties met in mean field theories is the definition (or calculation) of the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">potential</a> of the mean field itself. One can very roughly distinguish between two approaches :</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>phenomenological</strong> approach is a parameterization of the nuclear potential by an appropriate mathematical function. Historically, <a href="Nuclear_shell_model#Deformed_harmonic_oscillator_approximated_model" title="wikilink">this procedure</a> was applied with the greatest success by Sven Gösta Nilsson, who used as a potential a (deformed) <a href="quantum_harmonic_oscillator" title="wikilink">harmonic oscillator</a> potential. The most recent parameterizations are based on more realistic functions, which account more accurately for scattering experiments, for example. In particular the form known as the <a href="Woods_Saxon_potential" title="wikilink">Woods Saxon potential</a> can be mentioned.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>self-consistent</strong> or <a class="uri" href="Hartree–Fock" title="wikilink">Hartree–Fock</a> approach aims to deduce mathematically the nuclear potential from an effective nucleon–nucleon interaction. This technique implies a resolution of the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a> in an iterative fashion, starting from an ansatz wavefunction and improving it variationally, since the potential depends there upon the wavefunctions to be determined. The latter are written as <a href="Slater_determinant" title="wikilink">Slater determinants</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of the Hartree–Fock approaches, the trouble is not to find the mathematical function which describes best the nuclear potential, but that which describes best the nucleon–nucleon interaction. Indeed, in contrast with <a href="atomic_physics" title="wikilink">atomic physics</a> where the interaction is known (it is the <a class="uri" href="Coulomb" title="wikilink">Coulomb</a> interaction), the nucleon–nucleon interaction within the nucleus is not known analytically.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons for this fact. First, the strong interaction acts essentially among the <a href="quark" title="wikilink">quarks</a> forming the nucleons. The <a href="nuclear_force" title="wikilink">nucleon–nucleon interaction</a> in vacuum is a mere <em>consequence</em> of the quark–quark interaction. While the latter is well understood in the framework of the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> at high energies, it is much more complicated in low energies due to <a href="color_confinement" title="wikilink">color confinement</a> and <a href="asymptotic_freedom" title="wikilink">asymptotic freedom</a>. Thus there is yet no fundamental theory allowing one to deduce the nucleon–nucleon interaction from the quark–quark interaction. Furthermore, even if this problem were solved, there would remain a large difference between the ideal (and conceptually simpler) case of two nucleons interacting in vacuum, and that of these nucleons interacting in the nuclear matter. To go further, it was necessary to invent the concept of <a href="effective_interaction" title="wikilink">effective interaction</a>. The latter is basically a mathematical function with several arbitrary parameters, which are adjusted to agree with experimental data.</p>

<p>Most modern interaction are zero-range so they act only when the two nucleons are in contact, as introduced by <a href="Tony_Skyrme" title="wikilink">Tony Skyrme</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-self-consistent-approaches-of-the-hartreefock-type">The self-consistent approaches of the Hartree–Fock type</h3>

<p>In the <a class="uri" href="Hartree–Fock" title="wikilink">Hartree–Fock</a> approach of the <a href="many-body_problem" title="wikilink"><em>n</em>-body problem</a>, the starting point is a <a href="Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> containing <em>n</em> <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> terms, and potential terms. As mentioned before, one of the mean field theory hypotheses is that only the two-body interaction is to be taken into account. The potential term of the Hamiltonian represents all possible two-body interactions in the set of <em>n</em> <a href="fermion" title="wikilink">fermions</a>. It is the first hypothesis.</p>

<p>The second step consists in assuming that the <a class="uri" href="wavefunction" title="wikilink">wavefunction</a> of the system can be written as a <a href="Slater_determinant" title="wikilink">Slater determinant</a> of one-particle <a href="spin-orbital" title="wikilink">spin-orbitals</a>. This statement is the mathematical translation of the independent-particle model. This is the second hypothesis.</p>

<p>There remains now to determine the components of this Slater determinant, that is, the individual <a href="wavefunction" title="wikilink">wavefunctions</a> of the nucleons. To this end, it is assumed that the total wavefunction (the Slater determinant) is such that the energy is minimum. This is the third hypothesis.</p>

<p>Technically, it means that one must compute the <a href="mean_value" title="wikilink">mean value</a> of the (known) two-body <a href="Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian</a> on the (unknown) Slater determinant, and impose that its mathematical <a href="calculus_of_variations" title="wikilink">variation</a> vanishes. This leads to a set of equations where the unknowns are the individual wavefunctions: the Hartree–Fock equations. Solving these equations gives the wavefunctions and individual energy levels of nucleons, and so the total energy of the nucleus and its wavefunction.</p>

<p>This short account of the <a class="uri" href="Hartree–Fock" title="wikilink">Hartree–Fock</a> method explains why it is called also the <a href="calculus_of_variations" title="wikilink">variational</a> approach. At the beginning of the calculation, the total energy is a "function of the individual wavefunctions" (a so-called functional), and everything is then made in order to optimize the choice of these wavefunctions so that the functional has a minimum – hopefully absolute, and not only local. To be more precise, there should be mentioned that the energy is a functional of the <a href="density_matrix" title="wikilink">density</a>, defined as the sum of the individual squared wavefunctions. Let us note also that the Hartree–Fock method is also used in <a href="atomic_physics" title="wikilink">atomic physics</a> and <a href="condensed_matter_physics" title="wikilink">condensed matter physics</a> as Density Functional Theory, DFT.</p>

<p>The process of solving the Hartree–Fock equations can only be iterative, since these are in fact a <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a> in which the potential depends on the <a href="density_matrix" title="wikilink">density</a>, that is, precisely on the <a href="wavefunction" title="wikilink">wavefunctions</a> to be determined. Practically, the algorithm is started with a set of individual grossly reasonable wavefunctions (in general the eigenfunctions of a <a href="quantum_harmonic_oscillator" title="wikilink">harmonic oscillator</a>). These allow to compute the density, and therefrom the Hartree–Fock potential. Once this done, the Schrödinger equation is solved anew, and so on. The calculation stops – convergence is reached – when the difference among wavefunctions, or energy levels, for two successive iterations is less than a fixed value. Then the mean field potential is completely determined, and the Hartree–Fock equations become standard Schrödinger equations. The corresponding Hamiltonian is then called the Hartree–Fock Hamiltonian.</p>
<h3 id="the-relativistic-mean-field-approaches">The relativistic mean field approaches</h3>

<p>Born first in the 1970s with the works of <a href="D._Walecka" title="wikilink">D. Walecka</a> on <a href="strong_interaction" title="wikilink">quantum hadrodynamics</a>, the <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">relativistic</a> models of the nucleus were sharpened up towards the end of the 1980s by P. Ring and coworkers. The starting point of these approaches is the relativistic <a href="quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">quantum field theory</a>. In this context, the nucleon interactions occur via the exchange of <a href="virtual_particle" title="wikilink">virtual particles</a> called <a href="meson" title="wikilink">mesons</a>. The idea is, in a first step, to build a <a class="uri" href="Lagrangian" title="wikilink">Lagrangian</a> containing these interaction terms. Second, by an application of the <a href="least_action_principle" title="wikilink">least action principle</a>, one gets a set of equations of motion. The real particles (here the nucleons) obey the <a href="Dirac_equation" title="wikilink">Dirac equation</a>, whilst the virtual ones (here the mesons) obey the <a href="Klein–Gordon_equation" title="wikilink">Klein–Gordon equations</a>.</p>

<p>In view of the non-<a href="perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">perturbative</a> nature of strong interaction, and also in view of the fact that the exact potential form of this interaction between groups of nucleons is relatively badly known, the use of such an approach in the case of atomic nuclei requires drastic approximations. The main simplification consists in replacing in the equations all field terms (which are <a href="operator_(physics)" title="wikilink">operators</a> in the mathematical sense) by their <a href="mean_value" title="wikilink">mean value</a> (which are <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">functions</a>). In this way, one gets a system of coupled <a href="integro-differential_equation" title="wikilink">integro-differential equations</a>, which can be solved numerically, if not analytically.</p>
<h3 id="the-interacting-boson-model">The interacting boson model</h3>

<p>The interacting boson model (IBM) is a model in nuclear physics in which nucleons are represented as pairs, each of them acting as a boson particle, with integral spin of 0, 2 or 4. There are several branches of this model - in one of them (IBM-1) one can group all types of nucleons in pairs, in others (for instance - IBM-2) one considers protons and neutrons in pairs separately. See also: <a href="Interacting_boson_model" title="wikilink">Interacting boson model</a>.</p>
<h3 id="spontaneous-breaking-of-symmetry-in-nuclear-physics">Spontaneous breaking of symmetry in nuclear physics</h3>

<p>One of the focal points of all physics is <a href="symmetry_(physics)" title="wikilink">symmetry</a>. The nucleon–nucleon interaction and all <a href="effective_interaction" title="wikilink">effective interactions</a> used in practice have certain symmetries. They are invariant by <a href="translation_(geometry)" title="wikilink">translation</a> (changing the frame of reference so that directions are not altered), by <a class="uri" href="rotation" title="wikilink">rotation</a> (turning the frame of reference around some axis), or <a href="parity_(physics)" title="wikilink">parity</a> (changing the sense of axes) in the sense that the interaction does not change under any of these operations. Nevertheless, in the Hartree–Fock approach, solutions which are not invariant under such a symmetry can appear. One speaks then of <a href="spontaneous_symmetry_breaking" title="wikilink">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a>.</p>

<p>Qualitatively, these spontaneous symmetry breakings can be explained in the following way : in the mean field theory, the nucleus is described as a set of independent particles. Most additional correlations among nucleons which do not enter the mean field are neglected. They can appear however by a breaking of the symmetry of the mean field Hamiltonian, which is only approximate. If the density used to start the iterations of the Hartree–Fock process breaks certain symmetries, the final Hartree–Fock Hamiltonian may break these symmetries, if it is advantageous to keep these broken from the point of view of the total energy.</p>

<p>It may also converge towards a symmetric solution. In any case, if the final solution breaks the symmetry, for example, the rotational symmetry, so that the nucleus appears not to be spherical, but elliptic, all configurations deduced from this deformed nucleus by a rotation are just as good solutions for the Hartree–Fock problem. The ground state of the nucleus is then <em>degenerate</em>.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon happens with the nuclear pairing, which violates the conservation of the number of baryons (see below).</p>
<h2 id="extensions-of-the-mean-field-theories">Extensions of the mean field theories</h2>
<h3 id="nuclear-pairing-phenomenon">Nuclear pairing phenomenon</h3>

<p>The most common extension to mean field theory is the nuclear pairing. Nuclei with an even number of nucleons are systematically more bound than those with an odd one. This implies that each nucleon binds with another one to form a pair, consequently the system cannot be described as independent particles subjected to a common a mean field. When the nucleus has an even number of protons and neutrons, each one of them finds a partner. To excite such a system, one must at least use such an energy as to break a pair. Conversely, in the case of odd number of protons or neutrons, there exists an unpaired nucleon, which needs less energy to be excited.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is closely analogous to that of Type 1 <a class="uri" href="superconductivity" title="wikilink">superconductivity</a> in solid state physics. The first theoretical description of nuclear pairing was proposed at the end of the 1950s by <a href="Aage_Bohr" title="wikilink">Aage Bohr</a>, <a href="Ben_Mottelson" title="wikilink">Ben Mottelson</a>, and <a href="David_Pines" title="wikilink">David Pines</a> (which contributed to the reception of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 by Bohr and Mottelson).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> It was close to the <a href="BCS_theory" title="wikilink">BCS theory</a> of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer, which accounts for metal superconductivity. Theoretically, the pairing phenomenon as described by the BCS theory combines with the mean field theory: nucleons are both subject to the mean field potential and to the pairing interaction.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov" title="wikilink">Hartree–Fock–Bogolyubov</a> (HFB) approach is a more sophisticated approach,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> that enable to consider the pairing and mean field interactions consistently on equal footing, and is now the de-facto standard in the mean field treatment of nuclear systems.</p>
<h3 id="symmetry-restoration">Symmetry Restoration</h3>

<p>Peculiarity of mean field methods is the calculation of nuclear property by explicit <a href="symmetry_breaking" title="wikilink">symmetry breaking</a>. The calculation of the mean field with self-consistent methods (e.g. Hartree-Fock), breaks rotational symmetry, and the calculation of pairing property breaks particle-number.</p>

<p>Several techniques for symmetry restoration by projecting on good quantum numbers have been developed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="particle-vibrations-coupling">Particle Vibrations Coupling</h3>

<p>Mean field methods (eventually considering symmetry restoration) are a good approximation for the ground state of the system, even postulating a system of independent particles. Higher-order corrections consider the fact that the particles interact together by the means of correlation. These correlations can be introduced taking into account the coupling of independent particle degrees of freedom, low-energy collective excitation of systems with even number of protons and neutrons.</p>

<p>In these way excited states can be reproduced by the means of <a href="Random_Phase_Approximation" title="wikilink">Random Phase Approximation</a> (RPA), and eventually consistently calculating also corrections to the ground state (e.g. by the means of <a href="Nuclear_Field_Theory" title="wikilink">Nuclear Field Theory</a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>).</p>
