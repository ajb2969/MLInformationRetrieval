Observability Gramian

The Observability Gramian is a Gramian used in optimal control theory to determine whether or not a linear system is observable.
For a linear system described by




The observability Gramian for a linear time variant system is given by


 
  ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the state transition matrix.
The system is observable on the interval 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular. In the case of a linear time invariant system, this can be simplified to finding the rank of the "observability matrix". If 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional real-valued vector, then the system is observable if and only if
