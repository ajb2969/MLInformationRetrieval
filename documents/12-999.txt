   Conductor of an abelian variety      Conductor of an abelian variety   In mathematics , in Diophantine geometry , the conductor of an abelian variety defined over a local or global field  F is a measure of how "bad" the bad reduction at some prime is. It is connected to the ramification in the field generated by the torsion points .  Definition  For an abelian variety  A defined over a field F as above, with ring of integers R , consider the Néron model of A , which is a 'best possible' model of A defined over R . This model may be represented as a scheme over   Spec( R )   (cf. spectrum of a ring ) for which the generic fibre constructed by means of the morphism   Spec( F ) → Spec( R )   gives back A . Let A 0 denote the open subgroup scheme of the Néron model whose fibres are the connected components. For a maximal ideal P of A with residue field  k , A 0 k is a group variety over k , hence an extension of an abelian variety by a linear group. This linear group is an extension of a torus by a unipotent group . Let u P be the dimension of the unipotent group and t P the dimension of the torus. The order of the conductor at P is        f  P   =    2   u  P    +   t  P   +   δ  P     ,       subscript  f  P       2   subscript  u  P     subscript  t  P    subscript  δ  P      f_{P}=2u_{P}+t_{P}+\delta_{P},\,     where     δ  P   ∈  ℕ       subscript  δ  P   ℕ    \delta_{P}\in\mathbb{N}   is a measure of wild ramification. When F is a number field, the conductor ideal of A is given by       f  =    ∏  P    P   f  P      .      f    subscript  product  P    superscript  P   subscript  f  P       f=\prod_{P}P^{f_{P}}.     Properties   A has good reduction at P if and only if     u  P   =   t  P   =  0         subscript  u  P    subscript  t  P        0     u_{P}=t_{P}=0   (which implies     f  P   =   δ  P   =  0         subscript  f  P    subscript  δ  P        0     f_{P}=\delta_{P}=0   ).  A has semistable reduction if and only if     u  P   =  0       subscript  u  P   0    u_{P}=0   (then again     δ  P   =  0       subscript  δ  P   0    \delta_{P}=0   ).  If A acquires semistable reduction over a Galois extension of F of degree prime to p , the residue characteristic at P , then δ P = 0.  If p > 2 d + 1, where d is the dimension of A , then δ P = 0.
