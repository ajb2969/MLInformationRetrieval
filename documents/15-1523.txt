Homospermidine synthase

Homospermidine synthase () is an enzyme with system name putrescine:putrescine 4-aminobutyltransferase (ammonia-forming).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) 2 putrescine

 
  sym-homospermidine + NH3 + H+

(2) putrescine + spermidine

 
  sym-homospermidine + propane-1,3-diamine
 

The reaction of this enzyme occurs in three steps.
