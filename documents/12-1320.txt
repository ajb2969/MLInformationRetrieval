Palierne equation

Palierne equation connects the dynamic modulus of emulsions with the dynamic modulus of the two phases, size of the droplets and the interphase surface tension. The equation can also be used for suspensions of viscoelastic solid particles in viscoelastic fluids.1 The equation is named after French rheologist Jean-Fran√ßois Palierne who has proposed the equation in 1991.2
For the dilute emulsions Palierne equation looks like:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the dynamic modulus of the emulsion, 
 
 
 
  is the dynamic modulus of the continuous phase (matrix), 
 
 
 
  is the volume fraction of the disperse phase and the 
 
 
 
  is given as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the dynamic modulus of the disperse phase, 
 
 
 
  is the surface tension between the phases and 
 
 
 
  is the radius of the droplets.3
For the suspension of solid particles the value of 
 
 
 
  is given as4



The Palierne equation is usually extended for the finite volume concentrations of the disperse phase 
 
 
 
  as:5
