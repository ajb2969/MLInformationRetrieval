   List of Banach spaces      List of Banach spaces   In the mathematical field of functional analysis , Banach spaces are among the most important objects of study. In other areas of mathematical analysis , most spaces which arise in practice turn out to be Banach spaces as well.  Classical Banach spaces  According to , the classical Banach spaces are those defined by , which is the source for the following table.  Here K denotes the field of real numbers or complex numbers and I is a closed and bounded interval [ a , b ]. The number p is a real number with , and q is its Hölder conjugate (also with ), so that the next equation holds:         1  q   +   1  p    =  1   ,          1  q     1  p    1    \frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{p}=1,     and thus       q  =   p   p  -  1     .      q    p    p  1      q=\frac{p}{p-1}.     The symbol Σ denotes a σ-algebra of sets, and Ξ denotes just an algebra of sets (for spaces only requiring finite additivity, such as the ba space ). The symbol μ denotes a positive measure: that is, a real-valued positive set function defined on a σ-algebra which is countably additive.      style="border-bottom: 2px solid #303060" Classical Banach spaces        K n     ℓ n p     ℓ n ∞     ℓ p     ℓ 1     ℓ ∞     c     c 0     bv     bv 0     bs     cs     B ( X , Ξ)     C ( X )     ba(Ξ)     ca(Σ)     rca(Σ)     L p (μ)     L 1 (μ)     L ∞ (μ)     BV(I)     NBV(I)     AC(I)     C n [ a , b ]     Banach spaces in other areas of analysis   The Asplund spaces  The Hardy spaces  The space BMO of functions of bounded mean oscillation  The space of functions of bounded variation  Sobolev spaces  The Birnbaum–Orlicz spaces  L A (μ).
