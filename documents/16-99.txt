   Alpha-humulene synthase      Alpha-humulene synthase   Alpha-humulene synthase (, ZSS1 ) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (alpha-humulene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-humulene + diphosphate    The enzyme from Zingiber zerumbet , shampoo ginger , also gives traces of beta-caryophyllene.
