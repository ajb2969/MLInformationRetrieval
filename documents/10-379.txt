   Darcy friction factor formulae      Darcy friction factor formulae   In fluid dynamics , the Darcy friction factor formulae are equations – based on experimental data and theory – for the Darcy friction factor. The Darcy friction factor is a dimensionless quantity used in the Darcy–Weisbach equation , for the description of friction losses in pipe flow as well as open channel flow. It is also known as the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor or Moody friction factor and is four times larger than the Fanning friction factor . 1  Flow regime  Which friction factor formula may be applicable depends upon the type of flow that exists:   Laminar flow  Transition between laminar and turbulent flow  Fully turbulent flow in smooth conduits  Fully turbulent flow in rough conduits  Free surface flow.   Laminar flow  The Darcy friction factor for laminar flow in a circular pipe (Reynolds number less than 2320) is given by the following formula:      f  =   64  Re       f    64  Re     f=\frac{64}{\mathrm{Re}}     where:      f   f   f   is the Darcy friction factor     Re   Re   \mathrm{Re}   is the Reynolds number .   Transition flow  Transition (neither fully laminar nor fully turbulent) flow occurs in the range of Reynolds numbers between 2300 and 4000. The value of the Darcy friction factor is subject to large uncertainties in this flow regime.  Turbulent flow in smooth conduits  The Blasius correlation is the simplest equation for computing the Darcy friction factor. Because the Blasius correlation has no term for pipe roughness, it is valid only to smooth pipes. However, the Blasius correlation is sometimes used in rough pipes because of its simplicity. The Blasius correlation is valid up to the Reynolds number 100000.  Turbulent flow in rough conduits  The Darcy friction factor for fully turbulent flow (Reynolds number greater than 4000) in rough conduits is given by the Colebrook equation.  Free surface flow  The last formula in the Colebrook equation section of this article is for free surface flow. The approximations elsewhere in this article are not applicable for this type of flow.  Choosing a formula  Before choosing a formula it is worth knowing that in the paper on the Moody chart , Moody stated the accuracy is about ±5% for smooth pipes and ±10% for rough pipes. If more than one formula is applicable in the flow regime under consideration, the choice of formula may be influenced by one or more of the following:   Required precision  Speed of computation required  Available computational technology:  calculator (minimize keystrokes)  spreadsheet (single-cell formula)  programming/scripting language (subroutine).    Compact forms  The Colebrook equation is an implicit equation that combines experimental results of studies of turbulent flow in smooth and rough pipes . It was developed in 1939 by C. F. Colebrook. 2 The 1937 paper by C. F. Colebrook and C. M. White 3 is often erroneously cited as the source of the equation. This is partly because Colebrook in a footnote (from his 1939 paper) acknowledges his debt to White for suggesting the mathematical method by which the smooth and rough pipe correlations could be combined. The equation is used to iteratively solve for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f . This equation is also known as the Colebrook–White equation .  For conduits that are flowing completely full of fluid at Reynolds numbers greater than 4000, it is defined as:       1   f    =   -   2    log  10    (    ε   3.7   D  h     +   2.51   Re   f      )            1    f        2    subscript   10       ε    3.7   subscript  D  normal-h       2.51    Re    f           \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-2\log_{10}\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{3.7D_{\mathrm{h}}}+%
 \frac{2.51}{\mathrm{Re}\sqrt{f}}\right)      or        1   f    =   -   2    log  10    (    ε   14.8   R  h     +   2.51   Re   f      )            1    f        2    subscript   10       ε    14.8   subscript  R  normal-h       2.51    Re    f           \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-2\log_{10}\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{14.8R_{\mathrm{h}}}+%
 \frac{2.51}{\mathrm{Re}\sqrt{f}}\right)     where:      f   f   f   is the Darcy friction factor  Roughness height,   ε   ε   \varepsilon   (m, ft)  Hydraulic diameter ,    D  h     subscript  D  normal-h    D_{\mathrm{h}}   (m, ft) – For fluid-filled, circular conduits,    D  h     subscript  D  normal-h    D_{\mathrm{h}}   = D = inside diameter  Hydraulic radius ,    R  h     subscript  R  normal-h    R_{\mathrm{h}}   (m, ft) – For fluid-filled, circular conduits,    R  h     subscript  R  normal-h    R_{\mathrm{h}}   = D/4 = (inside diameter)/4     Re   Re   \mathrm{Re}   is the Reynolds number  How to check the   f   f   f   ? Compute both sides of the Colebrook-White equation with the   f   f   f   and if both sides are the same then the   f   f   f   was good.   Note: Some sources use a constant of 3.71 in the denominator for the roughness term in the first equation above. 4  Solving  The Colebrook equation is usually solved numerically due to its implicit nature. Recently, the Lambert W function has been employed to obtain explicit reformulation of the Colebrook equation. 5  You can solve the Colebrook equation by iteration using the Newton–Raphson method . An example is provided in C# here. 6  Expanded forms  Additional, mathematically equivalent forms of the Colebrook equation are:       1   f    =    1.7384  …   -   2    log  10    (     2  ε    D  h    +   18.574   Re   f      )            1    f        1.7384  normal-…     2    subscript   10         2  ε    subscript  D  normal-h      18.574    Re    f           \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=1.7384\ldots-2\log_{10}\left(\frac{2\varepsilon}{D_{\mathrm%
 {h}}}+\frac{18.574}{\mathrm{Re}\sqrt{f}}\right)       where:  1.7384... = 2 log (2 × 3.7) = 2 log (7.4)  18.574 = 2.51 × 3.7 × 2       and       1   f    =     1.1364  …   +   2    log  10    (    D  h   /  ε   )      -   2    log  10    (   1  +   9.287   Re   (   ε  /   D  h    )    f      )            1    f          1.1364  normal-…     2    subscript   10      subscript  D  normal-h   ε        2    subscript   10     1    9.287    Re    ε   subscript  D  normal-h      f           \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=1.1364\ldots+2\log_{10}(D_{\mathrm{h}}/\varepsilon)-2\log_{%
 10}\left(1+\frac{9.287}{\mathrm{Re}(\varepsilon/D_{\mathrm{h}})\sqrt{f}}\right)      or  \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}= 1.1364\ldots -2 \log_{10} \left( \frac {\varepsilon}   {D_\mathrm{h}} + \frac {9.287} {\mathrm{Re} \sqrt{f}} \right)    where:  1.1364... = 1.7384... − 2 log (2) = 2 log (7.4) − 2 log (2) = 2 log (3.7)  9.287 = 18.574 / 2 = 2.51 × 3.7.       The additional equivalent forms above assume that the constants 3.7 and 2.51 in the formula at the top of this section are exact. The constants are probably values which were rounded by Colebrook during his curve fitting ; but they are effectively treated as exact when comparing (to several decimal places) results from explicit formulae (such as those found elsewhere in this article) to the friction factor computed via Colebrook's implicit equation.  Equations similar to the additional forms above (with the constants rounded to fewer decimal places, or perhaps shifted slightly to minimize overall rounding errors) may be found in various references. It may be helpful to note that they are essentially the same equation.  Free surface flow  Another form of the Colebrook-White equation exists for free surfaces. Such a condition may exist in a pipe that is flowing partially full of fluid. For free surface flow:        1   f    =   -   2    log  10    (    ε   12   R  h     +   2.51   Re   f      )       .        1    f        2    subscript   10       ε    12   subscript  R  normal-h       2.51    Re    f           \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-2\log_{10}\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{12R_{\mathrm{h}}}+\frac%
 {2.51}{\mathrm{Re}\sqrt{f}}\right).     Approximations of the Colebrook equation  Haaland equation  The Haaland equation was proposed by Norwegian Institute of Technology professor Haaland in 1984. It is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f for a full-flowing circular pipe. It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation, but the discrepancy from experimental data is well within the accuracy of the data. It was developed by S. E. Haaland in 1983.  The Haaland equation is defined as:       1   f    =   -   1.8    log  10    [     (    ε  /  D   3.7   )   1.11   +   6.9  Re    ]            1    f        1.8    subscript   10      superscript      ε  D   3.7   1.11     6.9  Re         \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=-1.8\log_{10}\left[\left(\frac{\varepsilon/D}{3.7}\right)^{%

Swamee–Jain equation  The Swamee–Jain equation is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f for a full-flowing circular pipe. It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation.      f  =   0.25    [    log  10    (    ε   3.7  D    +   5.74   Re  0.9     )    ]    -  2         f    0.25   superscript   delimited-[]    subscript   10       ε    3.7  D      5.74   superscript  Re  0.9         2       f=0.25\left[\log_{10}\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{3.7D}+\frac{5.74}{\mathrm{Re}^{0%
 .9}}\right)\right]^{-2}    8  where f is a function of:   Roughness height, ε (m, ft)  Pipe diameter, D (m, ft)  Reynolds number , Re (unitless).   Serghides's solution  Serghides's solution is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f for a full-flowing circular pipe. It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation. It was derived using Steffensen's method . 9  The solution involves calculating three intermediate values and then substituting those values into a final equation.      A  =   -   2    log  10    (    ε   3.7  D    +   12  Re    )          A      2    subscript   10       ε    3.7  D      12  Re         A=-2\log_{10}\left({\varepsilon\over 3.7D}+{12\over\mbox{Re}}\right)         B  =   -   2    log  10    (    ε   3.7  D    +    2.51  A   Re    )          B      2    subscript   10       ε    3.7  D        2.51  A   Re         B=-2\log_{10}\left({\varepsilon\over 3.7D}+{2.51A\over\mbox{Re}}\right)         C  =   -   2    log  10    (    ε   3.7  D    +    2.51  B   Re    )          C      2    subscript   10       ε    3.7  D        2.51  B   Re         C=-2\log_{10}\left({\varepsilon\over 3.7D}+{2.51B\over\mbox{Re}}\right)          1   f    =   (   A  -     (   B  -  A   )   2     C  -   2  B    +  A     )         1    f      A     superscript    B  A   2       C    2  B    A       \frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}=\left(A-\frac{(B-A)^{2}}{C-2B+A}\right)     where f is a function of:   Roughness height, ε (m, ft)  Pipe diameter, D (m, ft)  Reynolds number , Re ( unitless ).   The equation was found to match the Colebrook–White equation within 0.0023% for a test set with a 70-point matrix consisting of ten relative roughness values (in the range 0.00004 to 0.05) by seven Reynolds numbers (2500 to 10 8 ).  Goudar–Sonnad equation  Goudar equation is the most accurate approximation to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f for a full-flowing circular pipe. It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation.

The equation was found to match the Colebrook–White equation within 3.15%.  Blasius correlations  Early approximations by Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius in terms of the Moody friction factor are given in one article of 1913: 12     f  =   .316   Re   -   1  4          f    .316   superscript  Re      1  4        f=.316\mathrm{Re}^{-{1\over 4}}   .  Johann Nikuradse in 1932 proposed that this corresponds to a power law correlation for the fluid velocity profile.  Mishra and Gupta in 1979 proposed a correction for curved or helically coiled tubes, taking into account the equivalent curve radius, R c : 13     f  =    0.316   Re   -   1  4      +   0.0075    D   2   R  c            f      0.316   superscript  Re      1  4        0.0075      D    2   subscript  R  c          f=0.316\mathrm{Re}^{-{1\over 4}}+0.0075\sqrt{\frac{D}{2R_{c}}}   ,  with,       R  c   =   R   [   1  +    (   H   2  π  R    )   2    ]         subscript  R  c     R   delimited-[]    1   superscript    H    2  π  R    2        R_{c}=R\left[1+\left(\frac{H}{2\pi R}\right)^{2}\right]     where f is a function of:   Pipe diameter, D (m, ft)  Curve radius, R (m, ft)  Helicoidal pitch, H (m, ft)  Reynolds number , Re (unitless)   valid for:   Re tr 5  6.7 c/D'' < 346.0  0 < H/D < 25.4   Table of Approximations  The following table lists historical approximations where: 14   Re, Reynolds number ( unitless );  λ, Darcy friction factor (dimensionless);  ε, roughness of the inner surface of the pipe (dimension of length);  D , inner pipe diameter;      log   (  x  )       x    \log(x)   is the base-10 logarithm .
