Darcy friction factor formulae

In fluid dynamics, the Darcy friction factor formulae are equations – based on experimental data and theory – for the Darcy friction factor. The Darcy friction factor is a dimensionless quantity used in the Darcy–Weisbach equation, for the description of friction losses in pipe flow as well as open channel flow. It is also known as the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor or Moody friction factor and is four times larger than the Fanning friction factor.1
Flow regime
Which friction factor formula may be applicable depends upon the type of flow that exists:

Laminar flow
Transition between laminar and turbulent flow
Fully turbulent flow in smooth conduits
Fully turbulent flow in rough conduits
Free surface flow.

Laminar flow
The Darcy friction factor for laminar flow in a circular pipe (Reynolds number less than 2320) is given by the following formula:



where:



 
  is the Darcy friction factor


 
  is the Reynolds number.

Transition flow
Transition (neither fully laminar nor fully turbulent) flow occurs in the range of Reynolds numbers between 2300 and 4000. The value of the Darcy friction factor is subject to large uncertainties in this flow regime.
Turbulent flow in smooth conduits
The Blasius correlation is the simplest equation for computing the Darcy friction factor. Because the Blasius correlation has no term for pipe roughness, it is valid only to smooth pipes. However, the Blasius correlation is sometimes used in rough pipes because of its simplicity. The Blasius correlation is valid up to the Reynolds number 100000.
Turbulent flow in rough conduits
The Darcy friction factor for fully turbulent flow (Reynolds number greater than 4000) in rough conduits is given by the Colebrook equation.
Free surface flow
The last formula in the Colebrook equation section of this article is for free surface flow. The approximations elsewhere in this article are not applicable for this type of flow.
Choosing a formula
Before choosing a formula it is worth knowing that in the paper on the Moody chart, Moody stated the accuracy is about ±5% for smooth pipes and ±10% for rough pipes. If more than one formula is applicable in the flow regime under consideration, the choice of formula may be influenced by one or more of the following:

Required precision
Speed of computation required
Available computational technology:
 
calculator (minimize keystrokes)
spreadsheet (single-cell formula)
programming/scripting language (subroutine).


Compact forms
The Colebrook equation is an implicit equation that combines experimental results of studies of turbulent flow in smooth and rough pipes. It was developed in 1939 by C. F. Colebrook.2 The 1937 paper by C. F. Colebrook and C. M. White3 is often erroneously cited as the source of the equation. This is partly because Colebrook in a footnote (from his 1939 paper) acknowledges his debt to White for suggesting the mathematical method by which the smooth and rough pipe correlations could be combined. The equation is used to iteratively solve for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f. This equation is also known as the Colebrook–White equation.
For conduits that are flowing completely full of fluid at Reynolds numbers greater than 4000, it is defined as:

Note: Some sources use a constant of 3.71 in the denominator for the roughness term in the first equation above.4
Solving
The Colebrook equation is usually solved numerically due to its implicit nature. Recently, the Lambert W function has been employed to obtain explicit reformulation of the Colebrook equation.5
You can solve the Colebrook equation by iteration using the Newton–Raphson method. An example is provided in C# here.6
Expanded forms
Additional, mathematically equivalent forms of the Colebrook equation are:





where:
 
1.7384... = 2 log (2 × 3.7) = 2 log (7.4)
 
18.574 = 2.51 × 3.7 × 2
 





and




or
 


{D_\mathrm{h}} + \frac {9.287} {\mathrm{Re} \sqrt{f}} \right) 


where:
 
1.1364... = 1.7384... − 2 log (2) = 2 log (7.4) − 2 log (2) = 2 log (3.7)
 
9.287 = 18.574 / 2 = 2.51 × 3.7.
 





The additional equivalent forms above assume that the constants 3.7 and 2.51 in the formula at the top of this section are exact. The constants are probably values which were rounded by Colebrook during his curve fitting; but they are effectively treated as exact when comparing (to several decimal places) results from explicit formulae (such as those found elsewhere in this article) to the friction factor computed via Colebrook's implicit equation.
Equations similar to the additional forms above (with the constants rounded to fewer decimal places, or perhaps shifted slightly to minimize overall rounding errors) may be found in various references. It may be helpful to note that they are essentially the same equation.
Free surface flow
Another form of the Colebrook-White equation exists for free surfaces. Such a condition may exist in a pipe that is flowing partially full of fluid. For free surface flow:



Approximations of the Colebrook equation
Haaland equation
The Haaland equation was proposed by Norwegian Institute of Technology professor Haaland in 1984. It is used to solve directly for the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor f for a full-flowing circular pipe. It is an approximation of the implicit Colebrook–White equation, but the discrepancy from experimental data is well within the accuracy of the data. It was developed by S. E. Haaland in 1983.
The Haaland equation is defined as:

The equation was found to match the Colebrook–White equation within 3.15%.
