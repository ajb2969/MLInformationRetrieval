   Undefined (mathematics)      Undefined (mathematics)   In mathematics, the word undefined has several different meanings, depending on the context.   In geometry , simple words such as "point" and "line" are taken as undefined terms.  In arithmetic , some arithmetic operations are called "undefined". Two of the more famous examples are division by zero and zero to the power of zero .  In algebra , a function is said to be "undefined" at points not in its domain. For example, in the real number system,     f   (  x  )    =   x         f  x     x     f(x)=\sqrt{x}   is undefined for negative   x   x   x   , i.e., no such values exist for function   f   f   f   .   Undefined terms in geometry  In ancient times, geometers attempted to define every term. For example, Euclid defined a point as "that which has no part". In modern times, mathematicians recognized that attempting to define every word inevitably led to circular definitions , and therefore left some terms, "point" for example, as undefined (see primitive notion ).  Indeterminate operations in arithmetic  The expression 0/0 is indeterminate in arithmetic, as explained in division by zero (the expression is used in calculus to represent an indeterminate form ).  0 0 is often left indeterminate, see zero to the power of zero for details.  Values for which functions are undefined  The set of numbers for which a function is defined is called the domain of the function. If a number is not in the domain of a function, the function is said to be "undefined" for that number. Two common examples are     f   (  x  )    =   1  x         f  x     1  x     f(x)=\frac{1}{x}   , which is undefined for    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   , and     f   (  x  )    =   x         f  x     x     f(x)=\sqrt{x}   , which is undefined (in the real number system) for negative   x   x   x   .  Notation using ↓ and ↑  In computability theory , if f is a partial function on S and a is an element of S , then this is written as f ( a )↓ and is read as " f ( a ) is defined ." 1  If a is not in the domain of f , then this is written as f ( a )↑ and is read as " f ( a ) is undefined ".  The symbols of infinity  In analysis , measure theory , and other mathematical disciplines, the symbol   ∞     \infty   is frequently used to denote an infinite pseudo-number in real analysis, along with its negative,    -  ∞         -\infty   . The symbol has no well-defined meaning by itself, but an expression like     {   a  n   }   →  ∞     normal-→    subscript  a  n       \left\{a_{n}\right\}\rightarrow\infty   is shorthand for a divergent sequence , which at some point is eventually larger than any given real number.  Performing standard arithmetic operations with the symbols    ±  ∞     plus-or-minus     \pm\infty   is undefined. Some extensions, though, define the following conventions of addition and multiplication:        x  +  ∞   =  ∞        x       x+\infty=\infty        ∀  x   ∈   ℝ  ∪   {  ∞  }         for-all  x     ℝ        \forall x\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}   .        -  ∞   +  x   =   -  ∞             x         -\infty+x=-\infty        ∀  x   ∈   ℝ  ∪   {   -  ∞   }         for-all  x     ℝ           \forall x\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}   .       x  ⋅  ∞   =  ∞       normal-⋅  x       x\cdot\infty=\infty        ∀  x   ∈   ℝ  +        for-all  x    superscript  ℝ      \forall x\in\mathbb{R}^{+}   .   No sensible extension of addition and multiplication with   ∞     \infty   exist in the following cases:       ∞  -  ∞          \infty-\infty         0  ⋅  ∞     normal-⋅  0     0\cdot\infty   (although in measure theory , this is often defined as   0   0    )      ∞  ∞          \frac{\infty}{\infty}      See extended real number line for more information.  Singularities in complex analysis  In complex analysis , a point    z  ∈  ℂ      z  ℂ    z\in\mathbb{C}   where a holomorphic function is undefined is called a singularity . One distinguishes between removable singularities (the function can be extended holomorphically to   z   z   z   , poles (the function can be extended meromorphically to   z   z   z   ), and essential singularities , where no meromorphic extension to   z   z   z   exists.
