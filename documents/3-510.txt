Proof that 22/7 exceeds π

Proofs of the famous mathematical result that the rational number 22/7 is greater than π (pi) date back to antiquity. One of these proofs, more recently developed but requiring only elementary techniques from calculus, has attracted attention in modern mathematics due to its mathematical elegance and its connections to the theory of diophantine approximations. Stephen Lucas calls this proof, “One of the more beautiful results related to approximating π”.1 Julian Havil ends a discussion of continued fraction approximations of π with the result, describing it as “impossible to resist mentioning” in that context.2
The purpose of the proof is not primarily to convince its readers that 22/7  is indeed bigger than 
 
 
 
 ; systematic methods of computing the value of 
 
 
 
  exist. If one knows that 
 
 
 
  is approximately 3.14159, then it trivially follows that 
 
 
 
  $\pi$ $\pi$ is approximately 3.14159.
Background
22/7 is a widely used Diophantine approximation of 
 
 
 
 . It is a convergent in the simple continued fraction expansion of 
 
 
 
 . It is greater than 
 
 
 
 , as can be readily seen in the decimal expansions of these values:



The approximation has been known since antiquity. Archimedes wrote the first known proof that 22/7 is an overestimate in the 3rd century BCE, although he may not have been the first to use that approximation. His proof proceeds by showing that 22/7 is greater than the ratio of the perimeter of a circumscribed regular polygon with 96 sides to the diameter of the circle. Another rational approximation of 
 
 
 
  that is far more accurate is 355/113.
The proof
The proof can be expressed very succinctly:



Therefore 22/7 > 
 
 
 
 .
The evaluation of this integral was the first problem in the 1968 Putnam Competition.3 It is easier than most Putnam Competition problems, but the competition often features seemingly obscure problems that turn out to refer to something very familiar. This integral also has been used in the entrance examinations for the Indian Institutes of Technology.4
Details of evaluation of the integral
That the integral is positive follows from the fact that the integrand is a quotient whose numerator and denominator are both non-negative, being sums or products of powers of non-negative real numbers. Since the integrand is positive, the integral from 0 to 1 is positive because the lower limit of integration is less than the upper limit of integration.
It remains to show that the integral in fact evaluates to the desired quantity:



(See polynomial long division.)
Quick upper and lower bounds
In , it is pointed out that if 1 is substituted for 
 
 
 
  in the denominator, one gets a lower bound on the integral, and if 0 is substituted for 
 
 
 
  in the denominator, one gets an upper bound:5



Thus we have



hence 3.1412 $\pi$ $\pi$. See also .6
Proof that 355/113 exceeds 
 
 

As discussed in , the well-known Diophantine approximation and far better upper estimate 355/113 for 
 
 
 
  follows from the relation



Note that



where the first six digits after the period agree with those of 
 
 
 
 . Substituting 1 for 
 
 
 
  in the denominator, we get the lower bound



substituting 0 for 
 
 
 
  in the denominator, we get twice this value as an upper bound, hence



In decimal expansion, this means 3.141 592 57 $\pi$ $\pi$.
Extensions
The above ideas can be generalized to get better approximations of 
 
 
 
 ; see also 7 and  (in both references, however, no calculations are given). For explicit calculations, consider, for every integer 
 
 
 
 ,



where the middle integral evaluates to



involving 
 
 
 
 . The last sum also appears in Leibniz' formula for 
 
 
. The correction term and error bound is given by



where the approximation (the tilde means that the quotient of both sides tends to one for large 
 
 
 
 ) of the central binomial coefficient follows from Stirling's formula and shows the fast convergence of the integrals to 
 
 
 
 .


Calculation of these integrals


For all integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we have



Applying this formula recursively 
 
 
 
  times yields



Furthermore,



where the first equality holds, because the terms for 
 
 
 
  cancel, and the second equality arises from the index shift 
 
 
 
 
  in the first sum.
Application of these two results gives



For integers 
 
 
 
 , using integration by parts

 
  times, we obtain



Setting 
 
 
 
 , we obtain



Integrating (*) from 0 to 1 using (**) and 
 
 
 
 , we get the claimed equation involving 
 
 
 
 
 .


The results for 
 
 
 
  are given above. For 
 
 
 
  we get



and



hence 3.141 592 31 $\pi$ $\pi$. Similarly for 
 
 
 
 
 ,



with correction term and error bound



hence 3.141 592 653 40 $\pi$ $n = 4$ is



with



which gives 3.141 592 653 589 55 $\pi$ $\pi$]]
