   Proof that 22/7 exceeds π      Proof that 22/7 exceeds π   Proofs of the famous mathematical result that the rational number 22/7 is greater than π (pi) date back to antiquity. One of these proofs, more recently developed but requiring only elementary techniques from calculus, has attracted attention in modern mathematics due to its mathematical elegance and its connections to the theory of diophantine approximations . Stephen Lucas calls this proof, “One of the more beautiful results related to approximating π ”. 1 Julian Havil ends a discussion of continued fraction approximations of π with the result, describing it as “impossible to resist mentioning” in that context. 2  The purpose of the proof is not primarily to convince its readers that 22/7 is indeed bigger than   π   π   \pi   ; systematic methods of computing the value of   π   π   \pi   exist. If one knows that   π   π   \pi   is approximately 3.14159, then it trivially follows that   π   π   \pi   $\pi$ $\pi$ is approximately 3.14159.  Background  22/7 is a widely used Diophantine approximation of   π   π   \pi   . It is a convergent in the simple continued fraction expansion of   π   π   \pi   . It is greater than   π   π   \pi   , as can be readily seen in the decimal expansions of these values:       22  7       22  7    \displaystyle\frac{22}{7}     The approximation has been known since antiquity. Archimedes wrote the first known proof that 22/7 is an overestimate in the 3rd century BCE, although he may not have been the first to use that approximation. His proof proceeds by showing that 22/7 is greater than the ratio of the perimeter of a circumscribed  regular polygon with 96 sides to the diameter of the circle. Another rational approximation of   π   π   \pi   that is far more accurate is 355/113 .  The proof  The proof can be expressed very succinctly:       0  <    ∫  0  1        x  4     (   1  -  x   )   4     1  +   x  2      d  x    =    22  7   -  π    .        0    superscript   subscript   0   1          superscript  x  4    superscript    1  x   4      1   superscript  x  2     d  x             22  7   π      0<\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4}(1-x)^{4}}{1+x^{2}}\,dx=\frac{22}{7}-\pi.     Therefore 22/7 >   π   π   \pi   .  The evaluation of this integral was the first problem in the 1968 Putnam Competition . 3 It is easier than most Putnam Competition problems, but the competition often features seemingly obscure problems that turn out to refer to something very familiar. This integral also has been used in the entrance examinations for the Indian Institutes of Technology . 4  Details of evaluation of the integral  That the integral is positive follows from the fact that the integrand is a quotient whose numerator and denominator are both non-negative , being sums or products of powers of non-negative real numbers . Since the integrand is positive, the integral from 0 to 1 is positive because the lower limit of integration is less than the upper limit of integration.  It remains to show that the integral in fact evaluates to the desired quantity:     0   0   \displaystyle 0     (See polynomial long division .)  Quick upper and lower bounds  In , it is pointed out that if 1 is substituted for   x   x   x   in the denominator, one gets a lower bound on the integral, and if 0 is substituted for   x   x   x   in the denominator, one gets an upper bound: 5        1  1260   =    ∫  0  1        x  4     (   1  -  x   )   4    2    d  x    <    ∫  0  1        x  4     (   1  -  x   )   4     1  +   x  2      d  x    <    ∫  0  1        x  4     (   1  -  x   )   4    1    d  x    =   1  630    .          1  1260     superscript   subscript   0   1          superscript  x  4    superscript    1  x   4    2   d  x           superscript   subscript   0   1          superscript  x  4    superscript    1  x   4      1   superscript  x  2     d  x           superscript   subscript   0   1          superscript  x  4    superscript    1  x   4    1   d  x           1  630      \frac{1}{1260}=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4}(1-x)^{4}}{2}\,dx<\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4%
 }(1-x)^{4}}{1+x^{2}}\,dx<\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{4}(1-x)^{4}}{1}\,dx={1\over 630}.     Thus we have         22  7   -   1  630    <  π  <    22  7   -   1  1260     ,            22  7     1  630    π           22  7     1  1260       {22\over 7}-{1\over 630}<\pi<{22\over 7}-{1\over 1260},     hence 3.1412 $\pi$ $\pi$.

Substituting 1 for   x   x   x   in the denominator, we get the lower bound         ∫  0  1        x  8     (   1  -  x   )   8    (   25  +   816   x  2     )    6328    d  x    =   911  5 261 111 856   =   0.000 000 173  …    ,          superscript   subscript   0   1          superscript  x  8    superscript    1  x   8     25    816   superscript  x  2      6328   d  x      911  5 261 111 856          0.000 000 173  normal-…      \int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^{8}(1-x)^{8}(25+816x^{2})}{6328}\,dx=\frac{911}{5\,261\,11%
