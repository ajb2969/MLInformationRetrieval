Prephenate dehydrogenase (NADP+)




Prephenate dehydrogenase (NADP+)

In enzymology, a prephenate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

prephenate + NADP+

 
  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate + CO2 + NADPH
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are prephenate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, CO2, and NADPH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is prephenate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include prephenate dehydrogenase, prephenate (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), dehydrogenase, and prephenate dehydrogenase (NADP). This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis.
