   Nicotinate N-methyltransferase      Nicotinate N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a nicotinate N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + nicotinate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylnicotinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and nicotinate , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methylnicotinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:nicotinate N-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include furanocoumarin 8-methyltransferase , and furanocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
