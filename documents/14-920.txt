   Mean absolute scaled error      Mean absolute scaled error   In statistics , the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) is a measure of the accuracy of forecasts . It was proposed in 2006 by Australian statistician Rob J. Hyndman , who described it as a "generally applicable measurement of forecast accuracy without the problems seen in the other measurements." 1  The mean absolute scaled error is given by      MASE  =    1  n     ∑   t  =  1   n    (    |   e  t   |     1   n  -  1      ∑   i  =  2   n    |    Y  i   -   Y   i  -  1     |      )     =     ∑   t  =  1   n    |   e  t   |      n   n  -  1      ∑   i  =  2   n    |    Y  i   -   Y   i  -  1     |            MASE      1  n     superscript   subscript     t  1    n        subscript  e  t        1    n  1      superscript   subscript     i  2    n        subscript  Y  i    subscript  Y    i  1                    superscript   subscript     t  1    n      subscript  e  t         n    n  1      superscript   subscript     i  2    n        subscript  Y  i    subscript  Y    i  1            \mathrm{MASE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\left|e_{t}\right|}{\frac{1%
 }{n-1}\sum_{i=2}^{n}\left|Y_{i}-Y_{i-1}\right|}\right)=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}%
 \left|e_{t}\right|}{\frac{n}{n-1}\sum_{i=2}^{n}\left|Y_{i}-Y_{i-1}\right|}    2 where the numerator e t is the forecast error for a given period, defined as the actual value ( Y t ) minus the forecast value ( F t ) for that period: e t = Y t − F t , and the denominator is the average forecast error of the one-step "naive forecast method", which uses the actual value from the prior period as the forecast: F t = Y t −1 3  This scale-free  error metric "can be used to compare forecast methods on a single series and also to compare forecast accuracy between series. This metric is well suited to intermittent-demand series because it never gives infinite or undefined values 4 except in the irrelevant case where all historical data are equal. 5  See also   Mean squared error  Mean absolute error  Mean absolute percentage error   References  "  Category:Point estimation performance  Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion  Category:Statistical terminology  Category:Time series analysis
