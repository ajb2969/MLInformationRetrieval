   Portal:Electronics/Selected article/2      Portal:Electronics/Selected article/2   Joule's laws are a set of two laws concerning the heat produced by a current and the energy dependence of an ideal gas to that of pressure, volume, and temperature, respecetively. Joule's first law , also known as the Joule effect , is a physical law expressing the relationship between the heat generated by the current flowing through a conductor . The heating effect of conductors carrying currents is known as Joule heating , named for James Prescott Joule . It is expressed as:      Q  =    I  2   ⋅  R  ⋅  t       Q   normal-⋅   superscript  I  2   R  t     Q=I^{2}\cdot R\cdot t     Where Q is the heat generated by a constant current I flowing through a conductor of electrical resistance  R , for a time  t .  Joule's second law states that the internal energy of an ideal gas is independent of its volume and pressure, depending only its temperature."
