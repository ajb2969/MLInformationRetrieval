Univalent function




Univalent function

In mathematics, in the branch of complex analysis, a holomorphic function on an open subset of the complex plane is called univalent if it is injective.
Examples
Any mapping 
 
 
 
  of the open unit disc to itself. The function


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is univalent.
Basic properties
One can prove that if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two open connected sets in the complex plane, and



is a univalent function such that 
 
 
 
  (that is, 
 
 
 
  is surjective), then the derivative of 
 
 
 
  is never zero, 
 
 
 
  is invertible, and its inverse 
 
 
 
  is also holomorphic. More, one has by the chain rule



for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

Comparison with real functions
For real analytic functions, unlike for complex analytic (that is, holomorphic) functions, these statements fail to hold. For example, consider the function



given by ƒ(x) = x3. This function is clearly injective, but its derivative is 0 at x = 0, and its inverse is not analytic, or even differentiable, on the whole interval (−1, 1). Consequently, if we enlarge the domain to an open subset G of the complex plane, it must fail to be injective; and this is the case, since (for example) f(εω) = f(ε) (where ω is a primitive cube root of unity and ε is a positive real number smaller than the radius of G as a neighbourhood of 0).
