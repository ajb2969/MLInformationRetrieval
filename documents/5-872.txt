   Univalent function      Univalent function   In mathematics , in the branch of complex analysis , a holomorphic function on an open subset of the complex plane is called univalent if it is injective .  Examples  Any mapping    ϕ  a     subscript  ϕ  a    \phi_{a}   of the open unit disc to itself. The function         ϕ  a    (  z  )    =    z  -  a    1  -    a  ¯   z      ,         subscript  ϕ  a   z       z  a     1     normal-¯  a   z       \phi_{a}(z)=\frac{z-a}{1-\bar{a}z},   where      |  a  |   <  1   ,        a   1    |a|<1,   is univalent.  Basic properties  One can prove that if   G   G   G   and   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   are two open connected sets in the complex plane, and      f  :   G  →  Ω      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  normal-Ω     f:G\to\Omega     is a univalent function such that     f   (  G  )    =  Ω        f  G   normal-Ω    f(G)=\Omega   (that is,   f   f   f   is surjective ), then the derivative of   f   f   f   is never zero,   f   f   f   is invertible , and its inverse    f   -  1      superscript  f    1     f^{-1}   is also holomorphic. More, one has by the chain rule         (   f   -  1    )   ′    (   f   (  z  )    )    =   1    f  ′    (  z  )            superscript   superscript  f    1    normal-′     f  z      1     superscript  f  normal-′   z      (f^{-1})^{\prime}(f(z))=\frac{1}{f^{\prime}(z)}     for all   z   z   z   in    G  .    G   G.     Comparison with real functions  For real  analytic functions , unlike for complex analytic (that is, holomorphic) functions, these statements fail to hold. For example, consider the function      f  :    (   -  1   ,  1  )   →   (   -  1   ,  1  )       normal-:  f   normal-→     1   1      1   1      f:(-1,1)\to(-1,1)\,     given by ƒ ( x ) = x 3 . This function is clearly injective, but its derivative is 0 at x = 0, and its inverse is not analytic, or even differentiable, on the whole interval (−1, 1). Consequently, if we enlarge the domain to an open subset G of the complex plane, it must fail to be injective; and this is the case, since (for example) f (εω) = f (ε) (where ω is a primitive cube root of unity and ε is a positive real number smaller than the radius of G as a neighbourhood of 0).
