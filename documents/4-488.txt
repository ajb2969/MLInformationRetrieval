   Half-period ratio      Half-period ratio   In mathematics , the half-period ratio τ of an elliptic function  j is the ratio      τ  =    ω  2    ω  1        τ     subscript  ω  2    subscript  ω  1      \tau=\frac{\omega_{2}}{\omega_{1}}     of the two half-periods ω 1 and ω 2 of j , where j is defined in such a way that       ℑ   (  τ  )    >  0        τ   0    \Im(\tau)>0   is in the upper half-plane .  Quite often in the literature, ω 1 and ω 2 are defined to be the periods of an elliptic function rather than its half-periods. Regardless of the choice of notation, the ratio ω 2 /ω 1 of periods is identical to the ratio (ω 2 /2)/(ω 1 /2) of half-periods. Hence the period ratio is the same as the "half-period ratio".  Note that the half-period ratio can be thought of as a simple number, namely, one of the parameters to elliptic functions, or it can be thought of as a function itself, because the half periods can be given in terms of the elliptic modulus or in terms of the nome .  See the pages on quarter period and elliptic integrals for additional definitions and relations on the arguments and parameters to elliptic functions.
