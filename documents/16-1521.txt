   Draft:Tautological bundle      Draft:Tautological bundle   Divisors and twisting sheaves  The Proj functor in fact gives more than a mere scheme: a sheaf in graded modules over the structure sheaf is defined in the process. The homogeneous components of this graded sheaf are denoted    𝒪   (  i  )       𝒪  i    \mathcal{O}(i)   , the Serre twisting sheaves . All of these sheaves are in fact line bundles . By the correspondence between Cartier divisors and line bundles, the first twisting sheaf    𝒪   (  1  )       𝒪  1    \mathcal{O}(1)   is equivalent to hyperplane divisors.  Since the ring of polynomials is a unique factorization domain , any prime ideal of height 1 is principal , which shows that any Weil divisor is linearly equivalent to some power of a hyperplane divisor. This consideration proves that the Picard group of a projective space is free of rank 1. That is      Pic    𝐏  𝐤  n    =  ℤ        Pic   subscript   superscript  𝐏  n   𝐤    ℤ    \mathrm{Pic}\ \mathbf{P}^{n}_{\mathbf{k}}=\mathbb{Z}   , and the isomorphism is given by the degree of divisors."
