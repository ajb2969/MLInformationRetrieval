Redheffer matrix

In mathematics, a Redheffer matrix, studied by , is a (0,1) matrix whose entries aij are 1 if i divides j or if j = 1; otherwise, aij = 0.
The determinant of the nxn square Redheffer matrix is given by the Mertens function M(n).
Example
The matrix below is the 12 × 12 Redheffer matrix.
