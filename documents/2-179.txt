   Alpha Herculis      Alpha Herculis   Alpha Herculis (α Her, α Herculis) is a multiple star system in the constellation  Hercules . It has the traditional name Rasalgethi or Ras Algethi ( Head of the Kneeler ), and the Flamsteed designation  64 Herculis . 1 The traditional name "Head" comes from the fact that in antiquity Hercules was depicted upside down on the constellation maps.  The term ra's al-jaθiyy or Ras al Djathi was appeared in the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket , which was translated into Latin as Caput Ingeniculi . 2  In Chinese astronomy , Rasalgethi is called 帝座, Pinyin : Dìzuò, meaning '' Emperor's Seat'', this star is marking itself and stands alone in the center of Emperor's Seat asterism, Heavenly Market enclosure (see : Chinese constellation ). 3 帝座 (Dìzuò) was westernized into Ti Tso by R.H. Allen, with the same meaning 4  Properties  The angular diameter of the red giant, α 1 Her, has been measured with an interferometer as 34 ± 0.8 mas , or 0.034 arcseconds. 5 At an estimated distance of 110 parsecs from Hipparcos , 6 7 8 this corresponds to a radius of about 280 million kilometers (or 170 million miles), which is roughly  or 1.87 AU . To determine the Rasalgheti's radius in terms of solar units, the calculations begin with the formula for angular diameter as follows:         δ  =    d  R    D  R             δ     subscript  d  R    subscript  D  R        \begin{smallmatrix}{\delta}=\frac{d_{R}}{D_{R}}\end{smallmatrix}     where δ equals Rasalgheti's angular diameter in arcseconds , d R the star's d iameter in AU , and D R the D istance from Earth in parsecs. If we know the angular diameter and the Distance, then we can solve for d R as follows:          d  R   =   δ  ⋅   D  R    =   0.034  ⋅  110.0   =   3.740  A  U               subscript  d  R    normal-⋅  δ   subscript  D  R          normal-⋅  0.034  110.0          3.740  A  U        \begin{smallmatrix}d_{R}=\delta\cdot D_{R}={0.034}\cdot 110.0=3.740AU\end{smallmatrix}   .  To obtain Rasalgheti's radius:          R  R   =   (    d  R   2   )   =   (   3.740  2   )   =   1.870  A  U               subscript  R  R      subscript  d  R   2          3.740  2          1.870  A  U        \begin{smallmatrix}R_{R}={\left({\frac{d_{R}}{2}}\right)}={\left({\frac{3.740}%
 {2}}\right)}=1.870AU\end{smallmatrix}   . Converting into Solar units, 1 AU = 149,597,871 km and the mean radius of the Sun = 696,000 km, hence the calculation:           d  B   =    (   1.87  A  U   )    (    149  ,  597  ,   871  k  m     696  ,   000  k  m     )    =  280   ,    000  ,   000  k  m    =   402   R  ⊙             formulae-sequence       subscript  d  B       1.87  A  U      149  597    871  k  m     696    000  k  m           280       000    000  k  m      402   subscript  R  direct-product         \begin{smallmatrix}d_{B}={\left(1.87AU\right)}{\left({\frac{149,597,871km}{696%
 ,000km}}\right)}=280,000,000km=402R_{\odot}\end{smallmatrix}   (rounded). If Rasalgheti were at the center of our Solar System its radius would extend past the orbit of Mars at 1.5 AU but not quite as far as the asteroid belt . The red giant is estimated to have started its life with about 7-8 solar masses . 9 Like most type M stars near the end of their lives, Rasalgethi is experiencing a high degree of stellar mass loss creating a sparse, gaseous envelope that extends at least 90 astronomical units . 10  Star system  When viewed through a telescope, this system is resolved into two components designated α 1 and α 2 . These two components are more than 500 astronomical units apart, with an estimated orbital period of approximately 3600 years. α 1 is a relatively massive red bright giant . α 2 is actually a double star system with a primary yellow giant star and a secondary, yellow-white dwarf star. (These components are sometimes designated α Herculis A, Ba and Bb, respectively.)
