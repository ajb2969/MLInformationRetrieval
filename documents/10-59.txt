   Singular integral      Singular integral   In mathematics , singular integrals are central to harmonic analysis and are intimately connected with the study of partial differential equations. Broadly speaking a singular integral is an integral operator        T   (  f  )    (  x  )    =   ∫   K   (  x  ,  y  )   f   (  y  )   d  y     ,        T  f  x       K   x  y   f  y  d  y      T(f)(x)=\int K(x,y)f(y)\,dy,     whose kernel function K : R n × R n → R is singular along the diagonal x = y . Specifically, the singularity is such that | K ( x , y )| is of size | x − y | − n asymptotically as | x − y | → 0. Since such integrals may not in general be absolutely integrable, a rigorous definition must define them as the limit of the integral over | y − x | > ε as ε → 0, but in practice this is a technicality. Usually further assumptions are required to obtain results such as their boundedness on L p ( R n ).  The Hilbert transform  The archetypal singular integral operator is the Hilbert transform  H . It is given by convolution against the kernel K ( x ) = 1/(π x ) for x in R . More precisely,        H   (  f  )    (  x  )    =    1  π     lim   ε  →  0      ∫    |   x  -  y   |   >  ε      1   x  -  y    f   (  y  )   d  y       .

 -y}f(y)\,dy.     The most straightforward higher dimension analogues of these are the Riesz transforms , which replace K ( x ) = 1/ x with        K  i    (  x  )    =    x  i     |  x  |    n  +  1            subscript  K  i   x      subscript  x  i    superscript    x     n  1       K_{i}(x)=\frac{x_{i}}{|x|^{n+1}}     where i = 1, …, n and    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is the i -th component of x in R n . All of these operators are bounded on L p and satisfy weak-type (1, 1) estimates. 1  Singular integrals of convolution type  A singular integral of convolution type is an operator T defined by convolution with a kernel K that is locally integrable on R n \{0}, in the sense that  Suppose that the kernel satisfies:  1. The size condition on the Fourier transform of K       K  ^   ∈    L  ∞    (   𝐑  n   )         normal-^  K      superscript  L     superscript  𝐑  n      \hat{K}\in L^{\infty}(\mathbf{R}^{n})     2. The smoothness condition: for some C > 0,         sup   y  ≠  0      ∫    |  x  |   >   2   |  y  |        |    K   (   x  -  y   )    -   K   (  x  )     |   d  x     ≤  C   .        subscript  supremum    y  0      subscript       x     2    y              K    x  y      K  x     d  x     C    \sup_{y\neq 0}\int_{|x|>2|y|}|K(x-y)-K(x)|\,dx\leq C.     Then it can be shown that T is bounded on L p ( R n ) and satisfies a weak-type (1, 1) estimate.  Property 1. is needed to ensure that convolution () with the tempered distribution p.v.

 (x)K(x)\,dx   is a well-defined Fourier multiplier on L 2 . Neither of the properties 1. or 2. is necessarily easy to verify, and a variety of sufficient conditions exist. Typically in applications, one also has a cancellation condition         sup   R  >  0      ∫   R  <   |  x  |   <   2  R       |   K   (  x  )    |   d  x     ≤  C   ,        subscript  supremum    R  0      subscript       R    x          2  R            K  x    d  x     C    \sup_{R>0}\int_{R<|x|<2R}|K(x)|\,dx\leq C,     which is quite easy to check. It is automatic, for instance, if K is an odd function . If, in addition, one assumes 2. and the following size condition      K  ∈    C  1    (    𝐑  n   ∖   {  0  }    )        K     superscript  C  1      superscript  𝐑  n    0       K\in C^{1}(\mathbf{R}^{n}\setminus\{0\})     then it can be shown that 1. follows.  The smoothness condition 2. is also often difficult to check in principle, the following sufficient condition of a kernel K can be used:        |    ∇  K    (  x  )    |   ≤   C    |  x  |    n  +  1              normal-∇  K   x      C   superscript    x     n  1       |\nabla K(x)|\leq\frac{C}{|x|^{n+1}}           (  a  )    |   K   (  x  ,  y  )    |    ≤   C    |   x  -  y   |   n         a      K   x  y        C   superscript      x  y    n      (a)\qquad|K(x,y)|\leq\frac{C}{|x-y|^{n}}      Observe that these conditions are satisfied for the Hilbert and Riesz transforms, so this result is an extension of those result. 2  Singular integrals of non-convolution type  These are even more general operators. However, since our assumptions are so weak, it is not necessarily the case that these operators are bounded on ''L' p .  Calderón–Zygmund kernels  A function K : R n × R n → R is said to be a Calderón – Zygmund kernel if it satisfies the following conditions for some constants C > 0 and δ > 0. 3        (  b  )    |    K   (  x  ,  y  )    -   K   (   x  ′   ,  y  )     |    ≤     C    |   x  -   x  ′    |   δ      (    |   x  -  y   |   +   |    x  ′   -  y   |    )    n  +  δ     whenever   |   x  -   x  ′    |    ≤    1  2    max   (   |   x  -  y   |   ,   |    x  ′   -  y   |   )            b        K   x  y      K    superscript  x  normal-′   y             C   superscript      x   superscript  x  normal-′     δ     superscript        x  y         superscript  x  normal-′   y       n  δ     whenever      x   superscript  x  normal-′               1  2         x  y         superscript  x  normal-′   y         (b)\qquad|K(x,y)-K(x^{\prime},y)|\leq\frac{C|x-x^{\prime}|^{\delta}}{\bigl(|x-%

 \right|\leq Cr^{-n}     for all smooth compactly supported ƒ.  It can be proved that such operators are, in fact, also bounded on all L p with 1 2. In order to state the result we must first define some terms.  A normalised bump is a smooth function φ on R n supported in a ball of radius 10 and centred at the origin such that |∂ α φ( x )| ≤ 1, for all multi-indices |α| ≤ n + 2. Denote by τ x (φ)( y ) = φ( y − x ) and φ r ( x ) = r −n φ( x / r ) for all x in R n and r > 0. An operator is said to be weakly bounded if there is a constant C such that       M   b  2    T   M   b  1         subscript  M   subscript  b  2    T   subscript  M   subscript  b  1      M_{b_{2}}TM_{b_{1}}     for all normalised bumps φ and ψ. A function is said to be accretive if there is a constant c > 0 such that Re( b )( x ) ≥ c for all x in R . Denote by M b the operator given by multiplication by a function b .  The T ( b ) theorem states that a singular integral operator T associated to a Calderón–Zygmund kernel is bounded on L 2 if it satisfies all of the following three conditions for some bounded accretive functions b 1 and b 2 : 5  (a)    T   (   b  1   )       T   subscript  b  1     T(b_{1})   is weakly bounded;  (b)      T  t    (   b  2   )    ,       superscript  T  t    subscript  b  2     T^{t}(b_{2}),   is in BMO ;  (c) $T^t(b_2),$ is in BMO , where T t is the transpose operator of T .
