Q-Racah polynomials

In mathematics, the q-Racah polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme, introduced by .  give a detailed list of their properties.
Definition
The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by


 
  They are sometimes given with changes of variables as
