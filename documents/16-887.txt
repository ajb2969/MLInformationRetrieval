   Lang's theorem      Lang's theorem   In algebraic geometry , Lang's theorem , introduced by Serge Lang , states: if G is a connected smooth algebraic group over a finite field     𝐅  q     subscript  𝐅  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   , then, writing    σ  :    G  →  G   ,   x  ↦   x  q        normal-:  σ   formulae-sequence   normal-→  G  G    maps-to  x   superscript  x  q       \sigma:G\to G,\,x\mapsto x^{q}   for the Frobenius, the morphism of varieties       G  →  G   ,   x  ↦    x   -  1    σ   (  x  )        formulae-sequence   normal-→  G  G    maps-to  x     superscript  x    1    σ  x      G\to G,\,x\mapsto x^{-1}\sigma(x)   is surjective. Note that the kernel of this map (i.e.,    G  =   G   (    𝐅  q   ¯   )    →   G   (    𝐅  q   ¯   )          G    G   normal-¯   subscript  𝐅  q       normal-→      G   normal-¯   subscript  𝐅  q        G=G(\overline{\mathbf{F}_{q}})\to G(\overline{\mathbf{F}_{q}})   ) is precisely    G   (   𝐅  q   )       G   subscript  𝐅  q     G(\mathbf{F}_{q})   .  The theorem implies that      H  1    (   𝐅  q   ,  G  )    =    H    e  ´   t   1    (   Spec   𝐅  q    ,  G  )           superscript  H  1     subscript  𝐅  q   G       superscript   subscript  H     normal-´  normal-e   normal-t    1     Spec   subscript  𝐅  q    G      H^{1}(\mathbf{F}_{q},G)=H_{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}^{1}(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf%
 {F}_{q},G)   vanishes, 1 and, consequently, any G -bundle on    Spec   𝐅  q      Spec   subscript  𝐅  q     \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}   is isomorphic to the trivial one. Also, the theorem plays a basic role in the theory of finite groups of Lie type .  It is not necessary that G is affine. Thus, the theorem also applies to abelian varieties (e.g., elliptic curves .) In fact, this application was Lang's initial motivation. If G is affine, the Frobenius   σ   σ   \sigma   may be replaced by any surjective map with finitely many fixed points (see below for the precise statement.)  The proof (given below) actually goes through for any   σ   σ   \sigma   that induces a nilpotent operator on the Lie algebra of G . 2  The Lang–Steinberg theorem  gave a useful improvement to the theorem.  Suppose that F is an endomorphism of an algebraic group G . The Lang map is the map from G to G taking g to g −1 F ( g ).  The Lang–Steinberg theorem states 3 that if F is surjective and has a finite number of fixed points, and G is a connected affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field, then the Lang map is surjective.  Proof of Lang's theorem  Define:        f  a   :    G  →  G   ,     f  a    (  x  )    =    x   -  1    a  σ   (  x  )       .     normal-:   subscript  f  a    formulae-sequence   normal-→  G  G        subscript  f  a   x      superscript  x    1    a  σ  x       f_{a}:G\to G,\quad f_{a}(x)=x^{-1}a\sigma(x).   Then (identifying the tangent space at a with the tangent space at the identity element) we have:        (  d   f  a   )   e   =  d    (  h  ∘   (  x  ↦   (   x   -  1    ,  a  ,  σ   (  x  )   )   )   )   e   =  d   h   (  e  ,  a  ,  e  )    ∘   (  -  1  ,  0  ,  d   σ  e   )   =  -  1  +  d   σ  e      fragments   subscript   fragments  normal-(  d   subscript  f  a   normal-)   e    d   subscript   fragments  normal-(  h    fragments  normal-(  x  maps-to   fragments  normal-(   superscript  x    1    normal-,  a  normal-,  σ   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-)   normal-)   normal-)   e    d   subscript  h   e  a  e      fragments  normal-(   1  normal-,  0  normal-,  d   subscript  σ  e   normal-)     1   d   subscript  σ  e     (df_{a})_{e}=d(h\circ(x\mapsto(x^{-1},a,\sigma(x))))_{e}=dh_{(e,a,e)}\circ(-1,%
 0,d\sigma_{e})=-1+d\sigma_{e}   where     h   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =   x  y  z         h   x  y  z      x  y  z     h(x,y,z)=xyz   . It follows     (   d   f  a    )   e     subscript    d   subscript  f  a    e    (df_{a})_{e}   is bijective since the differential of the Frobenius   σ   σ   \sigma   vanishes. Since      f  a    (   b  x   )    =    f    f  a    (  b  )      (  x  )           subscript  f  a     b  x       subscript  f     subscript  f  a   b    x     f_{a}(bx)=f_{f_{a}(b)}(x)   , we also see that     (   d   f  a    )   b     subscript    d   subscript  f  a    b    (df_{a})_{b}   is bijective for any b . 4 Let X be the closure of the image of    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   . The smooth points of X form an open dense subset; thus, there is some b in G such that     f  1    (  b  )        subscript  f  1   b    f_{1}(b)   is a smooth point of X . Since the tangent space to X at     f  1    (  b  )        subscript  f  1   b    f_{1}(b)   and the tangent space to G at b have the same dimension, it follows that X and G have the same dimension, since G is smooth. Since G is connected, the image of    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   then contains an open dense subset U of G . Now, given an arbitrary element a in G , by the same reasoning, the image of    f  a     subscript  f  a    f_{a}   contains an open dense subset V of G . The intersection    U  ∩  V      U  V    U\cap V   is then nonempty but then this implies a is in the image of    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   .  Notes  References   T.A.
