   Ergun equation      Ergun equation   The Ergun equation , derived by the Turkish  chemical engineer  Sabri Ergun in 1952, expresses the friction factor in a packed column as a function of the modified Reynolds number .  Equation       f  p   =    150   G   r  p     +  1.75        subscript  f  p       150    G   subscript  r  p     1.75     f_{p}=\frac{150}{Gr_{p}}+1.75     where    f  p     subscript  f  p    f_{p}   and    G   r  p       G   subscript  r  p     Gr_{p}   are defined as       f  p   =     Δ  p   L     D  p    ρ   v  s  2      (    ϵ  3    1  -  ϵ    )         subscript  f  p         normal-Δ  p   L      subscript  D  p     ρ   superscript   subscript  v  s   2        superscript  ϵ  3     1  ϵ       f_{p}=\frac{\Delta p}{L}\frac{D_{p}}{\rho v_{s}^{2}}\left(\frac{\epsilon^{3}}{%
 1-\epsilon}\right)   and     G   r  p    =    ρ   v  s    D  p      (   1  -  ϵ   )   μ          G   subscript  r  p        ρ   subscript  v  s    subscript  D  p        1  ϵ   μ      Gr_{p}=\frac{\rho v_{s}D_{p}}{(1-\epsilon)\mu}     where:    G   r  p       G   subscript  r  p     Gr_{p}   is the modified Reynolds number,     Δ  p      normal-Δ  p    \Delta p   is the pressure drop across the bed,    L   L   L   is the length of the bed (not the column),     D  p     subscript  D  p    D_{p}   is the equivalent spherical diameter of the packing,    ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of fluid,    μ   μ   \mu   is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,     v  s     subscript  v  s    v_{s}   is the superficial velocity (i.e. the velocity that the fluid would have through the empty tube at the same volumetric flow rate), and    ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the void fraction of the bed (bed porosity at any time).  Extension  The extension of the Ergun equation to fluidized beds is discussed by Akgiray and Saatçı (2001). To calculate the pressure drop in a given reactor, the following equation may be deduced       Δ  p   =       150   μ   L    D  p  2        (   1  -  ϵ   )   2    ϵ  3     v  s    +       1.75    L   ρ    D  p       (   1  -  ϵ   )    ϵ  3     v  s  2           normal-Δ  p           150  μ  L    superscript   subscript  D  p   2       superscript    1  ϵ   2    superscript  ϵ  3     subscript  v  s          1.75  L  ρ    subscript  D  p        1  ϵ    superscript  ϵ  3     superscript   subscript  v  s   2       \Delta p=\frac{150\mu~{}L}{D_{p}^{2}}~{}\frac{(1-\epsilon)^{2}}{\epsilon^{3}}v%
 _{s}+\frac{1.75~{}L~{}\rho}{D_{p}}~{}\frac{(1-\epsilon)}{\epsilon^{3}}v_{s}^{2}     This arrangement of the Ergun equation makes clear its close relationship to the simpler Kozeny-Carman equation which describes laminar flow of fluids across packed beds.
