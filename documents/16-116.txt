   (+)-alpha-pinene synthase      (+)-alpha-pinene synthase   (+)-alpha-pinene synthase (, (+)-alpha-pinene cyclase , cyclase I ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (+)-alpha-pinene-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)- alpha-pinene + diphosphate    Cyclase I of Salvia officinalis (sage) gives about equal parts (+)-alpha-pinene and (+)- camphene .
