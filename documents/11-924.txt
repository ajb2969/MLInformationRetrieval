   Glycine N-acyltransferase      Glycine N-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycine N-acyltransferase ( GLYAT ), also known as acyl-CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase ( ACGNAT ), () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction       ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons       Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and glycine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acylglycine . This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase. Other names in common use include glycine acyltransferase, and glycine-N-acylase.  This enzyme plays a prominent role in converting benzoic acid (benzoate) into hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine). Benzoic acid is metabolized by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA , 1 which is then metabolized by glycine N-acyltransferase into hippuric acid. 2  References       "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩  ↩
