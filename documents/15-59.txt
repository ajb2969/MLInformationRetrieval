Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation

In condensed matter physics, the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation (or LST-relation) determines the ratio of the natural frequency of longitudinal optic lattice vibrations (phonons) (
 
 
 
 ) of an ion crystal to the natural frequency of the transverse optical lattice vibration (
 
 
 
 ) for k=0.1 The ratio is equal to the ratio of the static permittivity 
 
 
 
  (Often also 
 
 
 
 ) for the permittivity for frequencies in the visible range 
 
 
 
  (often also 
 
 
 
 ).2



The Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation is named after the physicists R. H. Lydanne, Edward Teller, and R. G. Sachs.
