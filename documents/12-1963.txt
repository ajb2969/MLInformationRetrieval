Electron capture ionization




Electron capture ionization

Electron capture ionization is the ionization of a gas phase atom or molecule by attachment of an electron to create an ion of the form A–•. The reaction is



where the M over the arrow denotes that to conserve energy and momentum a third body is required (the molecularity of the reaction is three).
Electron capture can be used in conjunction with chemical ionization.1
An electron capture detector is used in some gas chromatography systems.2
