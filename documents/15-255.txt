Tate algebra

In rigid analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Tate algebra over a complete ultrametric field k, named for John Tate, is the subring R of the formal power series ring

 
  consisting of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . The maximal spectrum of R is then a rigid-analytic space.
Define the Gauss norm of 
 
 
 
  in R by


 
  This makes R a Banach k-algebra.
