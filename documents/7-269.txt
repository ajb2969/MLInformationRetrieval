   Margolus–Levitin theorem      Margolus–Levitin theorem   The Margolus–Levitin theorem , named for Norman Margolus and Lev B. Levitin , gives a fundamental limit on quantum computation (strictly speaking on all forms on computation). The processing rate cannot be higher than 6 × 10 33 operations per second per joule of energy. Or stating the bound for one micro system:   A quantum system of energy E needs at least a time of    h   4  E       h    4  E     \frac{h}{4E}   to go from one state to an orthogonal state, where h = 6.626 × 10 −34  J · s is Planck's constant .   The theorem is also of interest outside of quantum computation, e.g. it relates to the holographic principle , digital physics , simulated reality , the mathematical universe hypothesis and pancomputationalism .
