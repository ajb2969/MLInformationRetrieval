Kirwan map

In differential geometry, the Kirwan map, introduced by British mathematician Frances Kirwan, is the homomorphism


 
  where

M is a Hamiltonian G-space; i.e., a symplectic manifold acted by a Lie group G with a moment map

 
 .


 
  is the equivariant cohomology ring of M; i.e.. the cohomology ring of the homotopy quotient

 
  of M by G.


 
  is the symplectic quotient of M by G at a regular central value 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .

It is defined as the map of equivariant cohomology induced by the inclusion 
 
 
 
  followed by the canonical isomorphism 
 
 
 
 .
A theorem of Kirwan says that if M is compact, then the map is surjective in rational coefficients. The analogous result holds between the K-theory of the symplectic quotient and the equivariant topological K-theory of M.1
