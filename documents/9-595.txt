}} The Nakagami distribution or the Nakagami-m distribution is a probability distribution related to the gamma distribution. It has two parameters: a shape parameter

 
  and a second parameter controlling spread, 
 
 
 
 .
Characterization
Its probability density function (pdf) is1



Its cumulative distribution function is2



where P is the incomplete gamma function (regularized).
Differential equation



Parameter estimation
The parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are3


 
  and


 
  An alternative way of fitting the distribution is to re-parametrize 
 
 
 
  and m as σ = Ω/m and m.4 Then, by taking the derivative of log likelihood with respect to each of the new parameters, the following equations are obtained and these can be solved using the Newton-Raphson method:


 
  and


 
  It is reported by authors that modelling data with Nakagami distribution and estimating parameters by above mention method results in better performance for low data regime compared to moments based methods.
Generation
The Nakagami distribution is related to the gamma distribution. In particular, given a random variable 
 
 
 
 , it is possible to obtain a random variable 
 
 
 
 , by setting 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and taking the square root of 
 
 
 
 :


 
 .
The Nakagami distribution 
 
 
 
  can be generated from the chi distribution with parameter 
 
 
 
  set to 
 
 
 
  and then following it by a scaling transformation of random variables. That is, a Nakagami random variable 
 
 
 
  is generated by a simple scaling transformation on a Chi-distributed random variable 
 
 
 
  as below:



History and applications
The Nakagami distribution is relatively new, being first proposed in 1960.5 It has been used to model attenuation of wireless signals traversing multiple paths.6
