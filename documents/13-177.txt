Template:MEst/doc

Usage
This template calculates mass M of a spherical body of the density ρ and diameter d:



The template should be used in the following way:
{{MEst|d|ρ}},
where ρ is body's density in g/cm3, and d is diameter in km. The result is expressed in 1021 kg.
Example: ρ=2.0 g/cm3, d=100 km:
M=·1021 kg.
