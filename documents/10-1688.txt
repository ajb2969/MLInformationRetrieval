   Phosphoglucomutase (glucose-cofactor)      Phosphoglucomutase (glucose-cofactor)   In enzymology , a phosphoglucomutase (glucose-cofactor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose 6-phosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate , and one product , D-glucose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the phosphotransferases (phosphomutases), which transfer phosphate groups within a molecule. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucose 1,6-phosphomutase (glucose-cofactor) . Other names in common use include glucose phosphomutase , and glucose-1-phosphate phosphotransferase . This enzyme has at least one effector , D-Glucose .  References    Boyer, P.D.
