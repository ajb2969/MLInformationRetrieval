   Hadamard three-lines theorem      Hadamard three-lines theorem   In complex analysis , a branch of mathematics , the Hadamard three-lines theorem , named after the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard , is a result about the behaviour of holomorphic functions defined in regions bounded by parallel lines in the complex plane.  Statement  Let f ( z ) be a bounded function of z = x + iy defined on the strip       {   x  +   i  y    :   a  ≤  x  ≤  b   }   ,     conditional-set    x    i  y        a  x       b      \{x+iy:a\leq x\leq b\},     holomorphic in the interior of the strip and continuous on the whole strip. If        M   (  x  )    =    sup  y    |   f   (   x  +   i  y    )    |     ,        M  x     subscript  supremum  y       f    x    i  y         M(x)=\sup_{y}|f(x+iy)|,\,     then log M ( x ) is a convex function on [ a , b ].  In other words, if    x  =    t  a   +    (   1  -  t   )   b        x      t  a       1  t   b      x=ta+(1-t)b   with    0  ≤  t  ≤  1        0  t       1     0\leq t\leq 1   , then        M   (  x  )    ≤   M    (  a  )   t   M    (  b  )    1  -  t      .        M  x     M   superscript  a  t   M   superscript  b    1  t       M(x)\leq M(a)^{t}M(b)^{1-t}.\,     Proof  Define    F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   by        F   (  z  )    =   f   (  z  )   M    (  a  )     z  -  b    b  -  a     M    (  b  )     z  -  a    a  -  b       .        F  z     f  z  M   superscript  a      z  b     b  a     M   superscript  b      z  a     a  b        F(z)=f(z)M(a)^{{z-b\over b-a}}M(b)^{{z-a\over a-b}}.     Thus | F ( z )| ≤ 1 on the edges of the strip. The result follows once it is shown that the inequality also holds in the interior of the strip.  After an affine transformation in the coordinate z , it can be assumed that a = 0 and b = 1. The function        F  n    (  z  )    =   F   (  z  )    e    z  2   /  n     e   -   1  /  n             subscript  F  n   z     F  z   superscript  e     superscript  z  2   n     superscript  e      1  n        F_{n}(z)=F(z)e^{z^{2}/n}e^{-1/n}     tends to 0 as | z | tends to infinity and satisfies | F n | ≤ 1 on the boundary of the strip. The maximum modulus principle can therefore be applied to F n in the strip. So | F n ( z )| ≤ 1. Since F n ( z ) tends to F ( z ) as n tends to infinity. it follows that | F ( z )| ≤ 1.  Applications  The three-line theorem can be used to prove the Hadamard three-circle theorem for a bounded continuous function    g   (  z  )       g  z    g(z)   on an annulus     {  z  :   r  ≤   |  z  |   ≤  R   }     conditional-set  z      r    z        R      \{z:r\leq|z|\leq R\}   , holomorphic in the interior. Indeed applying the theorem to        f   (  z  )    =   g   (   e  z   )     ,        f  z     g   superscript  e  z      f(z)=g(e^{z}),\,     shows that, if        m   (  s  )    =    sup    |  z  |   =   e  s      |   g   (  z  )    |     ,        m  s     subscript  supremum      z    superscript  e  s         g  z       m(s)=\sup_{|z|=e^{s}}|g(z)|,\,     then      log   m    (  s  )         m   s    \log\,m(s)   is a convex function of s .  The three-line theorem also holds for functions with values in a Banach space and plays an important role in complex interpolation theory . It can be used to prove Hölder's inequality for measurable functions        ∫   |   g  h   |    ≤     (   ∫    |  g  |   p    )    1  p    ⋅    (   ∫    |  h  |   q    )    1  q      ,            g  h      normal-⋅   superscript     superscript    g   p      1  p     superscript     superscript    h   q      1  q       \int|gh|\leq\left(\int|g|^{p}\right)^{1\over p}\cdot\left(\int|h|^{q}\right)^{%
 1\over q},     where      1  p   +   1  q    =  1          1  p     1  q    1    {1\over p}+{1\over q}=1   , by considering the function        f   (  z  )    =   ∫     |  g  |    p  z      |  h  |    q   (   1  -  z   )        .        f  z        superscript    g     p  z     superscript    h     q    1  z         f(z)=\int|g|^{pz}|h|^{q(1-z)}.
