KCDSA

KCDSA (Korean Certificate-based Digital Signature Algorithm) is a digital signature algorithm created by a team led by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA). It is an ElGamal variant, similar to the Digital Signature Algorithm and GOST R 34.10-94. The standard algorithm is implemented over 
 
 
 
 , but an elliptic curve variant (EC-KCDSA) is also specified.
KCDSA requires a collision-resistant cryptographic hash function that can produce a variable-sized output (from 128 to 256 bits, in 32-bit increments). HAS-160, another Korean standard, is the suggested choice.

Signing

Signer randomly picks an integer 
 
 
 
  and computes 
 
 

Then computes the firs part
 
 

Then computes the second part
 
 

The signature is 
 
 


Verifying

Verifier computes 
 
 

Then he checks if
