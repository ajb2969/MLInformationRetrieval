   Flexible algebra      Flexible algebra   In mathematics, a flexible binary operation    ∘     \circ   is a binary operation that satisfies the equation        a  ∘   (   b  ∘  a   )    =    (   a  ∘  b   )   ∘  a    .        a    b  a        a  b   a     a\circ\left(b\circ a\right)=\left(a\circ b\right)\circ a.   for any two elements   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   of an algebraic structure .  Every commutative or associative operation is flexible, so the flexible identity becomes important for binary operations that are neither commutative nor associative, e.g. for the multiplication of sedenions , which are not even alternative .  Examples  The following classes of algebra are flexible:   Alternative algebra  Lie algebras  Jordan algebras  Okubo algebras   See also   Zorn ring  Maltsev algebra   References     "  Category:Non-associative algebras
