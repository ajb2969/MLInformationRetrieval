Flexible algebra

In mathematics, a flexible binary operation

 
  is a binary operation that satisfies the equation


 
  for any two elements 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of an algebraic structure.
Every commutative or associative operation is flexible, so the flexible identity becomes important for binary operations that are neither commutative nor associative, e.g. for the multiplication of sedenions, which are not even alternative.
Examples
The following classes of algebra are flexible:

Alternative algebra
Lie algebras
Jordan algebras
Okubo algebras
