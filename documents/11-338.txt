   Glycerol-3-phosphate-transporting ATPase      Glycerol-3-phosphate-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + glycerol-3-phosphateout   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + glycerol-3-phosphatein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and glycerol-3-phosphate , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and glycerol-3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (glycerol-3-phosphate-importing) . This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general .
