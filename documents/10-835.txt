   Sterol 24-C-methyltransferase      Sterol 24-C-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a sterol 24-C-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 24-methylene-5alpha-cholest-8-en-3beta-ol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 5alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 24-methylene-5alpha-cholest-8-en-3beta-ol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:zymosterol 24-C-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include Delta24-methyltransferase , Delta24-sterol methyltransferase , zymosterol-24-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-4-methionine:sterol Delta24-methyltransferase , SMT1 , 24-sterol C-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:Delta24(23)-sterol methyltransferase , and phytosterol methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids . It employs one cofactor , glutathione .
