   Ostrowski–Hadamard gap theorem      Ostrowski–Hadamard gap theorem   In mathematics , the Ostrowski–Hadamard gap theorem is a result about the analytic continuation of complex  power series whose non-zero terms are of orders that have a suitable "gap" between them. Such a power series is "badly behaved" in the sense that it cannot be extended to be an analytic function anywhere on the boundary of its disc of convergence . The result is named after the mathematicians  Alexander Ostrowski and Jacques Hadamard .  Statement of the theorem  Let 0 1 2  1 and all j ∈ N ,         p   j  +  1     p  j    >  λ   .         subscript  p    j  1     subscript  p  j    λ    \frac{p_{j+1}}{p_{j}}>\lambda.     Let ( α j ) j ∈ N be a sequence of complex numbers such that the power series       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   j  ∈  𝐍      α  j    z   p  j            f  z     subscript     j  𝐍       subscript  α  j    superscript  z   subscript  p  j        f(z)=\sum_{j\in\mathbf{N}}\alpha_{j}z^{p_{j}}     has radius of convergence 1. Then no point z with | z | = 1 is a regular point for f , i.e. f cannot be analytically extended from the open unit disc  D to any larger open set including even a single point of the boundary of D .
