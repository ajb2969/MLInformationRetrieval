   Lag operator      Lag operator   In time series analysis, the lag operator or back shift operator operates on an element of a time series to produce the previous element. For example, given some time series      X  =   {   X  1   ,   X  2   ,  …  }       X    subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…     X=\{X_{1},X_{2},\dots\}\,     then        L    X  t    =   X   t  -  1          L   subscript  X  t     subscript  X    t  1      \,LX_{t}=X_{t-1}   for all     t   >   1       t  1    \;t>1\,     or equivalently        X   t   =   L   X   t  +  1          subscript  X  t     L   subscript  X    t  1       \,X_{t}=LX_{t+1}   for all     t   ≥   1       t  1    \;t\geq 1\,     where L is the lag operator. Sometimes the symbol B for backshift is used instead. Note that the lag operator can be raised to arbitrary integer powers so that         L    -  1     X  t    =    X   t  +  1            superscript  L    1     subscript  X  t     subscript  X    t  1      \,L^{-1}X_{t}=X_{t+1}\,     and          L   k    X  t    =   X   t  -  k     .         superscript  L  k    subscript  X  t     subscript  X    t  k      \,L^{k}X_{t}=X_{t-k}.\,     Lag polynomials  Also polynomials of the lag operator can be used, and this is a common notation for ARMA (autoregressive moving average) models. For example,       ε  t   =    X  t   -    ∑   i  =  1   p     φ  i    X   t  -  i       =    (   1  -    ∑   i  =  1   p     φ  i    L  i      )     X  t            subscript  ε  t      subscript  X  t     superscript   subscript     i  1    p      subscript  φ  i    subscript  X    t  i                1    superscript   subscript     i  1    p      subscript  φ  i    superscript  L  i       subscript  X  t       \varepsilon_{t}=X_{t}-\sum_{i=1}^{p}\varphi_{i}X_{t-i}=\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^{p}%
 \varphi_{i}L^{i}\right)X_{t}\,     specifies an AR( p ) model.  A polynomial of lag operators is called a lag polynomial so that, for example, the ARMA model can be concisely specified as       φ   (  L  )    X  t    =   θ   (  L  )     ε  t           φ  L   subscript  X  t      θ  L   subscript  ε  t      \varphi(L)X_{t}=\theta(L)\varepsilon_{t}\,     where    φ   (  L  )       φ  L    \varphi(L)   and    θ   (  L  )       θ  L    \theta(L)   respectively represent the lag polynomials       φ   (  L  )    =   1  -    ∑   i  =  1   p     φ  i     L  i             φ  L     1    superscript   subscript     i  1    p      subscript  φ  i    superscript  L  i        \varphi(L)=1-\sum_{i=1}^{p}\varphi_{i}L^{i}\,     and        θ   (  L  )    =   1  +    ∑   i  =  1   q     θ  i    L  i       .        θ  L     1    superscript   subscript     i  1    q      subscript  θ  i    superscript  L  i        \theta(L)=1+\sum_{i=1}^{q}\theta_{i}L^{i}.\,     Polynomials of lag operators follow similar rules of multiplication and division as do numbers and polynomials of variables. For example,        X  t   =     θ   (  L  )     φ   (  L  )      ε  t     ,       subscript  X  t         θ  L     φ  L     subscript  ε  t      X_{t}=\frac{\theta(L)}{\varphi(L)}\varepsilon_{t},     means the same thing as        φ   (  L  )    X  t    =   θ   (  L  )     ε  t      .        φ  L   subscript  X  t      θ  L   subscript  ε  t      \varphi(L)X_{t}=\theta(L)\varepsilon_{t}\,.     As with polynomials of variables, a polynomial in the lag operator can be divided by another one using polynomial long division . In general dividing one such polynomial by another, when each has a finite order (highest exponent), results in an infinite-order polynomial.  An annihilator operator , denoted     [  ]   +     subscript      [\ ]_{+}   , removes the entries of the polynomial with negative power (future values).  Difference operator  In time series analysis, the first difference operator Δ is a special case of lag polynomial.         Δ   X  t        =    X  t   -   X   t  -  1            Δ   X  t         =    (   1  -  L   )     X  t      .            normal-Δ   subscript  X  t      absent     subscript  X  t    subscript  X    t  1       missing-subexpression       normal-Δ   subscript  X  t      absent      1  L    subscript  X  t      missing-subexpression      \begin{array}[]{lcr}\Delta X_{t}&=X_{t}-X_{t-1}\\
 \Delta X_{t}&=(1-L)X_{t}~{}.\end{array}     Similarly, the second difference operator works as follows:      Δ   (   Δ   X  t    )       normal-Δ    normal-Δ   subscript  X  t      \displaystyle\Delta(\Delta X_{t})     The above approach generalises to the i -th difference operator       Δ  i    X  t    =     (   1  -  L   )   i     X  t      .         superscript  normal-Δ  i    subscript  X  t       superscript    1  L   i    subscript  X  t      \Delta^{i}X_{t}=(1-L)^{i}X_{t}\ .     Conditional expectation  It is common in stochastic processes to care about the expected value of a variable given a previous information set. Let    Ω  t     subscript  normal-Ω  t    \Omega_{t}   be all information that is common knowledge at time t (this is often subscripted below the expectation operator); then the expected value of the realisation of X , j time-steps in the future, can be written equivalently as:      E   [   X   t  +  j    |   Ω  t   ]   =   E  t    [   X   t  +  j    ]   .     fragments  E   fragments  normal-[   subscript  X    t  j    normal-|   subscript  normal-Ω  t   normal-]     subscript  E  t    fragments  normal-[   subscript  X    t  j    normal-]   normal-.    E[X_{t+j}|\Omega_{t}]=E_{t}[X_{t+j}]\,.     With these time-dependent conditional expectations, there is the need to distinguish between the backshift operator ( B ) that only adjusts the date of the forecasted variable and the Lag operator ( L ) that adjusts equally the date of the forecasted variable and the information set:         L  n    E  t    [   X   t  +  j    ]    =    E   t  -  n     [   X    t  +  j   -  n    ]     ,         superscript  L  n    subscript  E  t    delimited-[]   subscript  X    t  j         subscript  E    t  n     delimited-[]   subscript  X      t  j   n        L^{n}E_{t}[X_{t+j}]=E_{t-n}[X_{t+j-n}]\,,            B  n    E  t    [   X   t  +  j    ]    =    E  t    [   X    t  +  j   -  n    ]     .         superscript  B  n    subscript  E  t    delimited-[]   subscript  X    t  j         subscript  E  t    delimited-[]   subscript  X      t  j   n        B^{n}E_{t}[X_{t+j}]=E_{t}[X_{t+j-n}]\,.
