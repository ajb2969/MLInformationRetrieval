4-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxybenzaldehyde + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-hydroxybenzoate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are 4-hydroxybenzoate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in toluene and xylene degradation in bacteria.12 It is also found in carrots (Daucus carota).3
