   Leibniz algebra      Leibniz algebra   In mathematics , a (right) Leibniz algebra , named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , sometimes called a Loday algebra , after , is a module L over a commutative ring R with a bilinear product [ _ , _ ] satisfying the Leibniz identity  $$[[a,b],c] = [a,[b,c]]+  [[a,c],b]. \,$$  In other words, right multiplication by any element c is a derivation . If in addition the bracket is alternating ([ a , a ] = 0) then the Leibniz algebra is a Lie algebra . Indeed, in this case [ a , b ] = −[ b , a ] and the Leibniz's identity is equivalent to Jacobi's identity ([ a , [ b , c ]] + [ c , [ a , b ]] + [ b , [ c , a ]] = 0). Conversely any Lie algebra is obviously a Leibniz algebra.  The tensor module, T ( V ) , of any vector space V can be turned into a Loday algebra such that  $$[a_1\otimes \cdots \otimes a_n,x]=a_1\otimes \cdots a_n\otimes x\quad \text{for }a_1,\ldots, a_n,x\in V.$$  This is the free Loday algebra over V .  Leibniz algebras were discovered by A. Bloh in 1965 who called them D-algebras. They attracted interest after Jean-Louis Loday noticed that the classical Chevalley–Eilenberg boundary map in the exterior module of a Lie algebra can be lifted to the tensor module which yields a new chain complex. In fact this complex is well-defined for any Leibniz algebra. The homology HL ( L ) of this chain complex is known as Leibniz homology . If L is the Lie algebra of (infinite) matrices over an associative R -algebra A then Leibniz homology of L is the tensor algebra over the Hochschild homology of A .  A Zinbiel algebra is the Koszul dual concept to a Leibniz algebra. It has defining identity:  $$( a \circ b ) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c) + a \circ (c \circ b) .$$  Notes  References           "  Category:Lie algebras  Category:Non-associative algebras
