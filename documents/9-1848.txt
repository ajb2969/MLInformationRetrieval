   Isomorphism extension theorem      Isomorphism extension theorem   In field theory , a branch of mathematics , the isomorphism extension theorem is an important theorem regarding the extension of a field isomorphism to a larger field.  Isomorphism extension theorem  The theorem states that given any field   F   F   F   , an algebraic extension field   E   E   E   of   F   F   F   and an isomorphism   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   mapping   F   F   F    onto a field    F  ′     superscript  F  normal-′    F^{\prime}   then   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   can be extended to an isomorphism   τ   τ   \tau   mapping   E   E   E   onto an algebraic extension    E  ′     superscript  E  normal-′    E^{\prime}   of    F  ′     superscript  F  normal-′    F^{\prime}   (a subfield of the algebraic closure of    F  ′     superscript  F  normal-′    F^{\prime}   ).  The proof of the isomorphism extension theorem depends on Zorn's lemma .  References   D.J. Lewis , Introduction to algebra , Harper & Row , 1965, Chap.IV.12, p.193.
