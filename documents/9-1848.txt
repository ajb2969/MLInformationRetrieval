Isomorphism extension theorem

In field theory, a branch of mathematics, the isomorphism extension theorem is an important theorem regarding the extension of a field isomorphism to a larger field.
Isomorphism extension theorem
The theorem states that given any field 
 
 
 
 , an algebraic extension field 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and an isomorphism 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
onto a field 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  can be extended to an isomorphism 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
 
  onto an algebraic extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  (a subfield of the algebraic closure of 
 
 
 
 ).
The proof of the isomorphism extension theorem depends on Zorn's lemma.
