Very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase

Very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase (, very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, very-long-chain beta-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, KCR (gene), IFA38 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA:NADP+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NADP+

 
  a very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


This microsomal complex extendins palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA (and their modified forms) to very-long-chain acyl CoAs.
