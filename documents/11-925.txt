   Glycine N-benzoyltransferase      Glycine N-benzoyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycine N-benzoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzoyl-CoA + glycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-benzoylglycine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are benzoyl-CoA and glycine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-benzoylglycine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzoyl-CoA:glycine N-benzoyltransferase . Other names in common use include benzoyl CoA-amino acid N-acyltransferase , and benzoyl-CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism .
