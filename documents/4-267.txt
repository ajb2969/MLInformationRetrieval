   Conformal equivalence      Conformal equivalence   In mathematics and theoretical physics , two geometries are conformally equivalent if there exists a conformal transformation (an angle-preserving transformation) that maps one geometry to the other one. 1 More generally, two Riemannian metrics on a manifold  M are conformally equivalent if one is obtained from the other by multiplication by a positive function on M . 2 Conformal equivalence is an equivalence relation on geometries or on Riemannian metrics.
