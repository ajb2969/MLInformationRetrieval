   Alternating sign matrix      Alternating sign matrix   In mathematics , an alternating sign matrix is a square matrix of 0s, 1s, and −1s such that the sum of each row and column is 1 and the nonzero entries in each row and column alternate in sign. These matrices generalize permutation matrices and arise naturally when using Dodgson condensation to compute a determinant. They are also closely related to the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions from statistical mechanics . They were first defined by William Mills, David Robbins , and Howard Rumsey in the former context.  Example  An example of an alternating sign matrix (that is not also a permutation matrix) is  (Figure)  Puzzle picture        [     0    0    1    0      1    0    0    0      0    1     -  1     1      0    0    1    0     ]   .      0  0  1  0    1  0  0  0    0  1    1   1    0  0  1  0     \begin{bmatrix}0&0&1&0\\

Alternating sign matrix conjecture  The alternating sign matrix conjecture states that the number of    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   alternating sign matrices is         ∏   k  =  0    n  -  1       (    3  k   +  1   )   !     (   n  +  k   )   !     =     1  !    4  !    7  !   ⋯    (    3  n   -  2   )   !      n  !     (   n  +  1   )   !   ⋯    (    2  n   -  1   )   !      .        superscript   subscript  product    k  0      n  1            3  k   1        n  k            1     4     7   normal-⋯        3  n   2         n       n  1    normal-⋯        2  n   1        \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(3k+1)!}{(n+k)!}=\frac{1!4!7!\cdots(3n-2)!}{n!(n+1)!%
 \cdots(2n-1)!}.   The first few terms in this sequence for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are   1 , 1, 2 , 7 , 42 , 429, 7436, 218348, … .   This conjecture was first proved by Doron Zeilberger in 1992. 1 In 1995, Greg Kuperberg gave a short proof 2 based on the Yang-Baxter equation for the six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions, that uses a determinant calculation, 3 which solves recurrence relations due to Vladimir Korepin . 4  Razumov–Stroganov conjecture  In 2001, A. Razumov and Y. Stroganov conjectured a connection between O(1) loop model, fully packed loop model (FPL) and ASMs. 5 This conjecture was proved in 2010 by Cantini and Sportiello. 6  References  Further reading   Bressoud, David M. , Proofs and Confirmations , MAA Spectrum, Mathematical Associations of America, Washington, D.C., 1999.
