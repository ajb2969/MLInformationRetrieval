   Binary matroid      Binary matroid   In matroid theory , a binary matroid is a matroid that can be represented over the finite field  GF(2) . 1 That is, up to isomorphism, they are the matroids whose elements are the columns of a (0,1)-matrix and whose sets of elements are independent if and only if the corresponding columns are linearly independent in GF(2).  Alternative characterizations  A matroid   M   M   M   is binary if and only if   It is the matroid defined from a symmetric (0,1)-matrix. 2  For every set   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   of circuits of the matroid, the symmetric difference of the circuits in   𝒮   𝒮   \mathcal{S}   can be represented as a disjoint union of circuits. 3 4  For every pair of circuits of the matroid, their symmetric difference contains another circuit. 5  For every pair    C  ,  D     C  D    C,D   where   C   C   C   is a circuit of   M   M   M   and   D   D   D   is a circuit of the dual matroid of   M   M   M   ,    |   C  ∩  D   |        C  D     |C\cap D|   is an even number. 6 7  For every pair    B  ,  C     B  C    B,C   where   B   B   B   is a basis of   M   M   M   and   C   C   C   is a circuit of   M   M   M   ,   C   C   C   is the symmetric difference of the fundamental circuits induced in   B   B   B   by the elements of    C  ∖  B      C  B    C\setminus B   . 8 9  No matroid minor of   M   M   M   is the uniform matroid     U    4  2      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  4   2     U{}^{2}_{4}   , the four-point line. 10 11 12  In the geometric lattice associated to the matroid, every interval of height two has at most five elements. 13   Related matroids  Every regular matroid , and every graphic matroid , is binary. 14 A binary matroid is regular if and only if it does not contain the Fano plane (a seven-element non-regular binary matroid) or its dual as a minor . 15 A binary matroid is graphic if and only if its minors do not include the dual of the graphic matroid of    K  5     subscript  K  5    K_{5}   nor of    K   3  ,  3      subscript  K   3  3     K_{3,3}   . 16 If every circuit of a binary matroid has odd cardinality, then its circuits must all be disjoint from each other; in this case, it may be represented as the graphic matroid of a cactus graph . 17  Additional properties  If   M   M   M   is a binary matroid, then so is its dual, and so is every minor of   M   M   M   . 18 Additionally, the direct sum of binary matroids is binary.  define a bipartite matroid to be a matroid in which every circuit has even cardinality, and an Eulerian matroid to be a matroid in which the elements can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. Within the class of graphic matroids, these two properties describe the matroids of bipartite graphs and Eulerian graphs (not-necessarily-connected graphs in which all vertices have even degree), respectively. For planar graphs (and therefore also for the graphic matroids of planar graphs) these two properties are dual: a planar graph or its matroid is bipartite if and only if its dual is Eulerian. The same is true for binary matroids. However, there exist non-binary matroids for which this duality breaks down. 19 20  Any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is binary, given access to the matroid via an independence oracle , must perform an exponential number of oracle queries, and therefore cannot take polynomial time. 21  References  "  Category:Matroid theory     . ↩  . ↩  .
