   Frölicher space      Frölicher space   In mathematics , Frölicher spaces extend the notions of calculus and smooth manifolds . They were introduced in 1982 by the mathematician  Alfred Frölicher .  Definition  A Frölicher space consists of a non-empty set X together with a subset C of Hom( R , X ) called the set of smooth curves , and a subset F of Hom( X , R ) called the set of smooth real functions , such that for each real function   f : X → R    in F and each curve   c : R → X    in C , the following axioms are satisfied:   f in F if and only if for each γ in C , f . γ in C ∞ ( R , R )  c in C if and only if for each φ in F , φ . c in C ∞ ( R , R )   Let A and B be two Frölicher spaces. A map   m : A → B    is called smooth if for each smooth curve c in C A , m . c is in C B . Furthermore the space of all such smooth maps has itself the structure of a Frölicher space. The smooth functions on ''   C ∞ ( A'', B )   are the images of      S  :      F  B   ×   C  A   ×   C  ∞      (  𝐑  ,  𝐑  )   ′    →   Mor   (    C  ∞    (  A  ,  B  )    ,  𝐑  )     :     (  f  ,  c  ,  λ  )   ↦   S   (  f  ,  c  ,  λ  )     ,    S   (  f  ,  c  ,  λ  )    (  m  )    :=   λ   (   f  ∘  m  ∘  c   )           normal-:  S   normal-→       subscript  F  B    subscript  C  A    superscript  normal-C      superscript   𝐑  𝐑   normal-′      Mor      superscript  normal-C     A  B    𝐑       normal-:     formulae-sequence   maps-to   f  c  λ     S   f  c  λ      assign    S   f  c  λ   m     λ    f  m  c         S:F_{B}\times C_{A}\times\mathrm{C}^{\infty}(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{R})^{\prime}%
