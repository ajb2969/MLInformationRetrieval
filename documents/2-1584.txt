   Prony equation      Prony equation   The Prony equation (named after Gaspard de Prony ) is a historically important equation in hydraulics , used to calculate the head loss due to friction within a given run of pipe. It is an empirical equation developed by Frenchman  Gaspard de Prony in the 19th century:       h  f   =    L  D    (    a  V   +   b   V  2     )         subscript  h  f       L  D       a  V     b   superscript  V  2        h_{f}=\frac{L}{D}(aV+bV^{2})     where h f is the head loss due to friction, calculated from: the ratio of the length to diameter of the pipe L/D , the velocity of the flow V , and two empirical factors a and b to account for friction.  This equation has been supplanted in modern hydraulics by the Darcy–Weisbach equation , which used it as a starting point.  References    .
