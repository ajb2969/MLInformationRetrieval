   GTP cyclohydrolase IIa      GTP cyclohydrolase IIa   In enzymology , a GTP cyclohydrolase IIa () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + 3 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-amino-5-formylamino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one + 2 phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP 8,9-hydrolase (phosphate-forming) .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
