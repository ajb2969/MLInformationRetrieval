   Banach–Mazur game      Banach–Mazur game   In general topology , set theory and game theory , a Banach – Mazur game is a topological game played by two players, trying to pin down elements in a set (space). The concept of a Banach–Mazur game is closely related to the concept of Baire spaces . This game was the first infinite positional game of perfect information to be studied. It was introduced by Mazur as problem 43 in the Scottish book , and Mazur's questions about it were answered by Banach.  Definition and properties  In what follows we will make use of the formalism defined in Topological game . A general Banach–Mazur game is defined as follows: we have a topological space    Y   Y   Y   , a fixed subset    X  ⊂  Y      X  Y    X\subset Y   , and a family   W   W   W   of subsets of   Y   Y   Y   that satisfy the following properties.   Each member of   W   W   W   has non-empty interior.  Each non-empty open subset of   Y   Y   Y   contains a member of   W   W   W   .   We will call this game    M  B   (  X  ,  Y  ,  W  )       M  B   X  Y  W     MB(X,Y,W)   . Two players,    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   and    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   , choose alternatively elements    W  0     subscript  W  0    W_{0}   ,    W  1     subscript  W  1    W_{1}   ,   ⋯   normal-⋯   \cdots   of   W   W   W   such that     W  0   ⊃   W  1   ⊃  ⋯       superset-of   subscript  W  0    subscript  W  1     superset-of    normal-⋯     W_{0}\supset W_{1}\supset\cdots   . The player    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   wins if and only if     X  ∩   (    ∩   n  <  ω     W  n    )    ≠  ∅        X    subscript     n  ω     subscript  W  n        X\cap(\cap_{n<\omega}W_{n})\neq\emptyset   .  The following properties hold.        P  2   ↑   M  B   (  X  ,  Y  ,  W  )       normal-↑   subscript  P  2     M  B   X  Y  W      P_{2}\uparrow MB(X,Y,W)   if and only if   X   X   X   is of the first category in   Y   Y   Y   (a set is of the first category or meagre if it is the countable union of nowhere-dense sets).  Assuming that   Y   Y   Y   is a complete metric space,     P  1   ↑   M  S   (  X  ,  Y  ,  W  )       normal-↑   subscript  P  1     M  S   X  Y  W      P_{1}\uparrow MS(X,Y,W)   if and only if   X   X   X   is comeager in some nonempty open subset of   Y   Y   Y   .  If   X   X   X   has the Baire property in   Y   Y   Y   , then    M  B   (  X  ,  Y  ,  W  )       M  B   X  Y  W     MB(X,Y,W)   is determined.  Any winning strategy of    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   can be reduced to a stationary winning strategy .  The siftable and strongly-siftable spaces introduced by Choquet can be defined in terms of stationary strategies in suitable modifications of the game. Let    B  M   (  X  )       B  M  X    BM(X)   denote a modification of    M  B   (  X  ,  Y  ,  W  )       M  B   X  Y  W     MB(X,Y,W)   where    X  =  Y      X  Y    X=Y   ,   W   W   W   is the family of all nonempty open sets in   X   X   X   , and    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   wins a play    (   W  0   ,   W  1   ,  ⋯  )      subscript  W  0    subscript  W  1   normal-⋯    (W_{0},W_{1},\cdots)   if and only if      ∩   n  <  ω     W  n    ≠  ∅        subscript     n  ω     subscript  W  n       \cap_{n<\omega}W_{n}\neq\emptyset   . Then   X   X   X   is siftable if and only if    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a stationary winning strategy in    B  M   (  X  )       B  M  X    BM(X)   .  A Markov winning strategy for    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   in    B  M   (  X  )       B  M  X    BM(X)   can be reduced to a stationary winning strategy. Furthermore, if    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a winning strategy in    B  M   (  X  )       B  M  X    BM(X)   , then she has a winning strategy depending only on two preceding moves. It is still an unsettled question whether a winning strategy for    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   can be reduced to a winning strategy that depends only on the last two moves of    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   .     X   X   X   is called weakly   α   α   \alpha   -favorable if    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a winning strategy in    B  M   (  X  )       B  M  X    BM(X)   . Then,   X   X   X   is a Baire space if and only if    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   has no winning strategy in    B  M   (  X  )       B  M  X    BM(X)   . It follows that each weakly   α   α   \alpha   -favorable space is a Baire space.   Many other modifications and specializations of the basic game have been proposed: for a thorough account of these, refer to [1987]. The most common special case, called    M  B   (  X  ,  J  )       M  B   X  J     MB(X,J)   , consists in letting    Y  =  J      Y  J    Y=J   , i.e. the unit interval    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   , and in letting   W   W   W   consist of all closed intervals    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   contained in    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   . The players choose alternatively subintervals      J  0   ,   J  1   ,  ⋯      subscript  J  0    subscript  J  1   normal-⋯    J_{0},J_{1},\cdots   of   J   J   J   such that     J  0   ⊃   J  1   ⊃  ⋯       superset-of   subscript  J  0    subscript  J  1     superset-of    normal-⋯     J_{0}\supset J_{1}\supset\cdots   , and    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   wins if and only if     X  ∩   (    ∩   n  <  ω     J  n    )    ≠  ∅        X    subscript     n  ω     subscript  J  n        X\cap(\cap_{n<\omega}J_{n})\neq\emptyset   .    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   wins if and only if     X  ∩   (    ∩   n  <  ω     J  n    )    =  ∅        X    subscript     n  ω     subscript  J  n        X\cap(\cap_{n<\omega}J_{n})=\emptyset   .  A simple proof: winning strategies  It is natural to ask for what sets   X   X   X   does    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   have a winning strategy . Clearly, if   X   X   X   is empty,    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a winning strategy, therefore the question can be informally rephrased as how "small" (respectively, "big") does   X   X   X   (respectively, the complement of   X   X   X   in   Y   Y   Y   ) have to be to ensure that    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a winning strategy. To give a flavor of how the proofs used to derive the properties in the previous section work, let us show the following fact.  Fact :     P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a winning strategy if   X   X   X   is countable,   Y   Y   Y   is T 1 , and   Y   Y   Y   has no isolated points.  Proof : Let the elements of   X   X   X   be     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  ⋯      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯    x_{1},x_{2},\cdots   . Suppose that    W  1     subscript  W  1    W_{1}   has been chosen by    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   , and let    U  1     subscript  U  1    U_{1}   be the (non-empty) interior of    W  1     subscript  W  1    W_{1}   . Then     U  1   ∖   {   x  1   }        subscript  U  1     subscript  x  1      U_{1}\setminus\{x_{1}\}   is a non-empty open set in   Y   Y   Y   , so    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   can choose a member    W  2     subscript  W  2    W_{2}   of   W   W   W   contained in this set. Then    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   chooses a subset    W  3     subscript  W  3    W_{3}   of    W  2     subscript  W  2    W_{2}   and, in a similar fashion,    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   can choose a member     W  4   ⊂   W  3        subscript  W  4    subscript  W  3     W_{4}\subset W_{3}   that excludes    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   . Continuing in this way, each point    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   will be excluded by the set    W   2  n      subscript  W    2  n     W_{2n}   , so that the intersection of all the    W  n     subscript  W  n    W_{n}   will have empty intersection with   X   X   X   . Q.E.D  The assumptions on   Y   Y   Y   are key to the proof: for instance, if    Y  =   {  a  ,  b  ,  c  }       Y   a  b  c     Y=\{a,b,c\}   is equipped with the discrete topology and   W   W   W   consists of all non-empty subsets of   Y   Y   Y   , then    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has no winning strategy if    X  =   {  a  }       X   a     X=\{a\}   (as a matter of fact, her opponent has a winning strategy). Similar effects happen if   Y   Y   Y   is equipped with indiscrete topology and    W  =   {  Y  }       W   Y     W=\{Y\}   .  A stronger result relates   X   X   X   to first-order sets.  Fact : Let   Y   Y   Y   be a topological space, let   W   W   W   be a family of subsets of   Y   Y   Y   satisfying the two properties above, and let   X   X   X   be any subset of   Y   Y   Y   .    P  2     subscript  P  2    P_{2}   has a winning strategy if and only if   X   X   X   is meagre .  This does not imply that    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   has a winning strategy if   X   X   X   is not meagre. In fact,    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   has a winning strategy if and only if there is some     W  i   ∈  W       subscript  W  i   W    W_{i}\in W   such that    X  ∩   W  i       X   subscript  W  i     X\cap W_{i}   is a comeagre subset of    W  i     subscript  W  i    W_{i}   . It may be the case that neither player has a winning strategy: when   Y   Y   Y   is    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   and   W   W   W   consists of the closed intervals    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   , the game is determined if the target set has the property of Baire , i.e. if it differs from an open set by a meagre set (but the converse is not true). Assuming the axiom of choice , there are subsets of    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   for which the Banach–Mazur game is not determined.  References   [1957] Oxtoby, J.C.
