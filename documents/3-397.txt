Banach–Mazur game

In general topology, set theory and game theory, a Banach–Mazur game is a topological game played by two players, trying to pin down elements in a set (space). The concept of a Banach–Mazur game is closely related to the concept of Baire spaces. This game was the first infinite positional game of perfect information to be studied. It was introduced by Mazur as problem 43 in the Scottish book, and Mazur's questions about it were answered by Banach.
Definition and properties
In what follows we will make use of the formalism defined in Topological game. A general Banach–Mazur game is defined as follows: we have a topological space

 
 , a fixed subset 
 
 
 
 , and a family 
 
 
 
  of subsets of 
 
 
 
  that satisfy the following properties.

Each member of 
 
 
 
  has non-empty interior.
Each non-empty open subset of 
 
 
 
  contains a member of 
 
 
 
 .

We will call this game 
 
 
 
 . Two players, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , choose alternatively elements 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . The player 
 
 
 
  wins if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
The following properties hold.



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is of the first category in 
 
 
 
  (a set is of the first category or meagre if it is the countable union of nowhere-dense sets).
Assuming that 
 
 
 
  is a complete metric space, 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is comeager in some nonempty open subset of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  has the Baire property in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is determined.
Any winning strategy of 
 
 
 
  can be reduced to a stationary winning strategy.
The siftable and strongly-siftable spaces introduced by Choquet can be defined in terms of stationary strategies in suitable modifications of the game. Let 
 
 
 
  denote a modification of 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the family of all nonempty open sets in 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  wins a play 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is siftable if and only if 
 
 
 
  has a stationary winning strategy in 
 
 
 
 .
A Markov winning strategy for 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  can be reduced to a stationary winning strategy. Furthermore, if 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy in 
 
 
 
 , then she has a winning strategy depending only on two preceding moves. It is still an unsettled question whether a winning strategy for 
 
 
 
  can be reduced to a winning strategy that depends only on the last two moves of 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is called weakly 
 
 
 
 -favorable if 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy in 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 
 
  is a Baire space if and only if 
 
 
 
  has no winning strategy in 
 
 
 
 . It follows that each weakly 
 
 
 
 -favorable space is a Baire space.

Many other modifications and specializations of the basic game have been proposed: for a thorough account of these, refer to [1987]. The most common special case, called 
 
 
 
 , consists in letting 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the unit interval 
 
 
 
 , and in letting 
 
 
 
  consist of all closed intervals 
 
 
 
  contained in 
 
 
 
 . The players choose alternatively subintervals

 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  wins if and only if 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  wins if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
A simple proof: winning strategies
It is natural to ask for what sets 
 
 
 
  does 
 
 
 
  have a winning strategy. Clearly, if 
 
 
 
  is empty, 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy, therefore the question can be informally rephrased as how "small" (respectively, "big") does 
 
 
 
  (respectively, the complement of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ) have to be to ensure that 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy. To give a flavor of how the proofs used to derive the properties in the previous section work, let us show the following fact.
Fact: 

 
  has a winning strategy if 
 
 
 
  is countable, 
 
 
 
  is T1, and 
 
 
 
  has no isolated points.
Proof: Let the elements of 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that 
 
 
 
  has been chosen by 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the (non-empty) interior of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a non-empty open set in 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
  can choose a member 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  contained in this set. Then 
 
 
 
  chooses a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and, in a similar fashion, 
 
 
 
  can choose a member 
 
 
 
  that excludes 
 
 
 
 . Continuing in this way, each point 
 
 
 
  will be excluded by the set 
 
 
 
 , so that the intersection of all the 
 
 
 
  will have empty intersection with 
 
 
 
 . Q.E.D
The assumptions on 
 
 
 
  are key to the proof: for instance, if 
 
 
 
  is equipped with the discrete topology and 
 
 
 
  consists of all non-empty subsets of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  has no winning strategy if 
 
 
 
  (as a matter of fact, her opponent has a winning strategy). Similar effects happen if 
 
 
 
  is equipped with indiscrete topology and 
 
 
 
 .
A stronger result relates 
 
 
 
  to first-order sets.
Fact: Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space, let 
 
 
 
  be a family of subsets of 
 
 
 
  satisfying the two properties above, and let 
 
 
 
  be any subset of 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy if and only if 
 
 
 
  is meagre.
This does not imply that 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy if 
 
 
 
  is not meagre. In fact, 
 
 
 
  has a winning strategy if and only if there is some 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a comeagre subset of 
 
 
 
 . It may be the case that neither player has a winning strategy: when 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  consists of the closed intervals 
 
 
 
 , the game is determined if the target set has the property of Baire, i.e. if it differs from an open set by a meagre set (but the converse is not true). Assuming the axiom of choice, there are subsets of 
 
 
 
  for which the Banach–Mazur game is not determined.
