   Negation introduction      Negation introduction   Negation introduction is a Rule of inference , or Transformation rule , in the field of Propositional calculus .  Negation introduction states that if a given antecedent implies both the consequent and its complement, then the antecedent is a contradiction. 1  2  Formal notation  This can be written as     (  P  →  Q  )   and   (  P  →  ¬  Q  )   ↔  ¬  P     fragments   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→  Q  normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(  P  normal-→   Q  normal-)   normal-↔   P    (P\rightarrow Q)\and(P\rightarrow\neg Q)\leftrightarrow\neg P     An example of its use would be an attempt to prove two contradictory statements from a single fact. For example, if a person were to state "When the phone rings I get happy" and then later state "When the phone rings I get annoyed", the logical inference which is made from this contradictory information is that the person is making a false statement about the phone ringing.
