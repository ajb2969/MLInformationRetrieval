   Harmonic superspace      Harmonic superspace   In supersymmetry , harmonic superspace  1 is one way of dealing with supersymmetric theories with 8 real SUSY generators in a manifestly covariant manner. It turns out that the 8 real SUSY generators are pseudoreal , and after complexification , correspond to the tensor product of a four-dimensional Dirac spinor with the fundamental representation of SU(2) R . The quotient space        S  U    (  2  )   R    /  U     (  1  )   R    ‚âà   S  2   ‚âÉ   ‚ÑÇ   ‚Ñô  1                S  U   subscript  2  R    U    subscript  1  R     superscript  S  2     similar-to-or-equals      ‚ÑÇ   superscript  ‚Ñô  1       SU(2)_{R}/U(1)_{R}\approx S^{2}\simeq\mathbb{CP}^{1}   , which is a 2-sphere / Riemann sphere .  Harmonic superspace describes N=2 D=4, N=1 D=5, and N=(1,0) D=6 SUSY in a manifestly covariant manner.  There are many possible coordinate systems over S 2 , 2 but the one chosen not only involves redundant coordinates , but also happen to be a coordinatization of     S  U    (  2  )   R    ‚âà   S  3         S  U   subscript  2  R     superscript  S  3     SU(2)_{R}\approx S^{3}   . We only get S 2  after a projection over     U    (  1  )   R    ‚âà   S  1         U   subscript  1  R     superscript  S  1     U(1)_{R}\approx S^{1}   . This is of course the Hopf fibration . Consider the left action of SU(2) R upon itself. We can then extend this to the space of complex valued smooth functions over SU(2) R . In particular, we have the subspace of functions which transform as the fundamental representation under SU(2) R . The fundamental representation (up to isomorphism, of course) is a two-dimensional complex vector space. Let us denote the indices of this representation by i,j,k,...=1,2. The subspace of interest consists of two copies of the fundamental representation. Under the right action by U(1) R -- which commutes with any left action‚Äîone copy has a "charge" of +1, and the other of -1. Let us label the basis functions    u   ¬±  i      superscript  u   plus-or-minus  i     u^{\pm i}   .        (   u   +  i    )   *   =   u  i  -        superscript   superscript  u    i       subscript   superscript  u    i     \left(u^{+i}\right)^{*}=u^{-}_{i}   . The redundancy in the coordinates is given by        u   +  i     u  i  -    =  1         superscript  u    i     subscript   superscript  u    i    1    u^{+i}u^{-}_{i}=1   . Everything can be interpreted in terms of algebraic geometry . The projection is given by the "gauge transformation"     u   ¬±  i    ‚Üí    e   ¬±   i  œï      u   ¬±  i        normal-‚Üí   superscript  u   plus-or-minus  i       superscript  e   plus-or-minus    i  œï      superscript  u   plus-or-minus  i       u^{\pm i}\to e^{\pm i\phi}u^{\pm i}   where œÜ is any real number. Think of S 3 as a U(1) R - principal bundle over S 2 with a nonzero first Chern class . Then, "fields" over S 2 are characterized by an integral U(1) R charge given by the right action of U(1) R . For instance, u + has a charge of +1, and u ‚àí of -1. By convention, fields with a charge of +r are denoted by a superscript with r +'s, and ditto for fields with a charge of -r. R-charges are additive under the multiplication of fields.  The SUSY charges are    Q   i  Œ±      superscript  Q    i  Œ±     Q^{i\alpha}   , and the corresponding fermionic coordinates are    Œ∏   i  Œ±      superscript  Œ∏    i  Œ±     \theta^{i\alpha}   . Harmonic superspace is given by the product of ordinary extended superspace (with 8 real fermionic coordinatates) with S 2 with the nontrivial U(1) R bundle over it. The product is somewhat twisted in that the fermionic coordinates are also charged under U(1) R . This charge is given by       Œ∏   ¬±  Œ±    =    u  i  ¬±    Œ∏   i  Œ±          superscript  Œ∏   plus-or-minus  Œ±       subscript   superscript  u  plus-or-minus   i    superscript  Œ∏    i  Œ±       \theta^{\pm\alpha}=u^{\pm}_{i}\theta^{i\alpha}   .  We can define the covariant derivatives     D  Œ±  ¬±     subscript   superscript  D  plus-or-minus   Œ±    D^{\pm}_{\alpha}   with the property that they supercommute with the SUSY transformations, and      D  Œ±  ¬±   f   (  u  )    =  0         subscript   superscript  D  plus-or-minus   Œ±   f  u   0    D^{\pm}_{\alpha}f(u)=0   where f is any function of the harmonic variables. Similarly, define       D    +  +    ‚â°    u   +  i     ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   u   -  i            superscript  D    absent        superscript  u    i          superscript  u    i         D^{++}\equiv u^{+i}\frac{\partial}{\partial u^{-i}}   and       D    -  -    ‚â°    u   -  i     ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   u   +  i            superscript  D    absent        superscript  u    i          superscript  u    i         D^{--}\equiv u^{-i}\frac{\partial}{\partial u^{+i}}   . A chiral superfield q with an R-charge of r satisfies      D  Œ±  +   q   =  0         subscript   superscript  D    Œ±   q   0    D^{+}_{\alpha}q=0   . A scalar hypermultiplet is given by a chiral superfield    q  +     superscript  q     q^{+}   . We have the additional constraint        D    +  +     q  +    =    J   +    +  +      (   q  +   ,  u  )           superscript  D    absent      superscript  q        superscript  J      absent        superscript  q    u      D^{++}q^{+}=J^{+++}(q^{+},\,u)   . According to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem , the solution space to the previous constraint is a two-dimensional complex manifold.  Relation to quaternions  The group    S  U    (  2  )   R       S  U   subscript  2  R     SU(2)_{R}   can be identified with the Lie group of quaternions with unit norm under multiplication.    S  U    (  2  )   R       S  U   subscript  2  R     SU(2)_{R}   , and hence the quaternions act upon the tangent space of extended superspace. The bosonic spacetime dimensions transform trivially under    S  U    (  2  )   R       S  U   subscript  2  R     SU(2)_{R}   while the fermionic dimensions transform according to the fundamental representation . 3 The left multiplication by quaternions is linear. Now consider the subspace of unit quaternions with no real component, which is isomorphic to S 2 . Each element of this subspace can act as the imaginary number i in a complex subalgebra of the quaternions. So, for each element of S 2 , we can use the corresponding imaginary unit to define a complex-real structure over the extended superspace with 8 real SUSY generators. The totality of all CR structures for each point in S 2 is harmonic superspace.
