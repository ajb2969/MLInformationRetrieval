L-ornithine 
 
 
 
  L-proline + NH4

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-ornithine, and two products, L-proline and NH4.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-ornithine ammonia-lyase (cyclizing; L-proline-forming). Other names in common use include ornithine cyclase, ornithine cyclase (deaminating), and L-ornithine ammonia-lyase (cyclizing). This enzyme participates in arginine and proline biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, NAD+.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
