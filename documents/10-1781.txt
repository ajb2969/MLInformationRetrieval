   Ornithine cyclodeaminase      Ornithine cyclodeaminase   In enzymology , an ornithine cyclodeaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction  (Figure)  Ornithine cyclodeaminase.svg    L-ornithine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-proline + NH 4   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-ornithine , and two products , L-proline and NH 4 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-ornithine ammonia-lyase (cyclizing; L-proline-forming) . Other names in common use include ornithine cyclase , ornithine cyclase (deaminating) , and L-ornithine ammonia-lyase (cyclizing) . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor , NAD+ .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
