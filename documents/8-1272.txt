   Omnibus test      Omnibus test   Omnibus tests are a kind of statistical test . They test whether the explained variance in a set of data is significantly greater than the unexplained variance , overall. One example is the F-test in the analysis of variance . There can be legitimate significant effects within a model even if the omnibus test is not significant. For instance, in a model with two independent variables, if only one variable exerts a significant effect on the dependent variable and the other does not, then the omnibus test may be non-significant. This fact does not affect the conclusions that may be drawn from the one significant variable. In order to test effects within an omnibus test, researchers often use contrasts .  In addition, Omnibus test is a general name refers to an overall or a global test and in most cases omnibus test is called in other expressions such as: F-test or Chi-squared test .  Omnibus test as a statistical test is implemented on an overall hypothesis that tends to find general significance between parameters' variance, while examining parameters of the same type, such as: Hypotheses regarding equality vs. inequality between k expectancies µ 1 =µ 2 =…=µ k vs. at least one pair µ j ≠µ j' , where j,j'=1,...,k and j≠j', in Analysis Of Variance(ANOVA); or regarding equality between k standard deviations σ 1 = σ 2 =….= σ k vs. at least one pair  σ j ≠ σ j' in testing equality of variances in ANOVA; or regarding coefficients β 1 = β 2 =….= β k vs. at least one pair β j ≠β j' in Multiple linear regression or in Logistic regression .  Usually, it tests more than two parameters of the same type and its role is to find general significance of at least one of the parameters involved.  Omnibus tests commonly refers to either one of those statistical tests:   ANOVA F test to test significance between all factor means and/or between their variances equality in Analysis of Variance procedure ;    The omnibus multivariate F Test in ANOVA with repeated measures ;    F test for equality/inequality of the regression coefficients in Multiple Regression;    Chi-Square test for exploring significance differences between blocks of independent explanatory variables or their coefficients in a logistic regression.   Those omnibus tests are usually conducted whenever one tends to test an overall hypothesis on a quadratic statistic (like sum of squares or variance or covariance) or rational quadratic statistic (like the ANOVA overall F test in Analysis of Variance or F Test in Analysis of covariance or the F Test in Linear Regression, or Chi-Square in Logistic Regression).  While significance is founded on the omnibus test, it doesn't specify exactly where the difference is occurred, meaning, it doesn't bring specification on which parameter is significally different from the other, but it statistically determine that there is a difference, so at least two of the tested parameters are statistically different. If significance was met, none of those tests will tell specifically which mean differs from the others (in ANOVA), which coefficient differs from the others (in Regression) etc.  Omnibus Tests in One Way Analysis of Variance  The F-test in ANOVA is an example of an omnibus test, which tests the overall significance of the model. Significant F test means that among the tested means, at least two of the means are significantly different, but this result doesn't specify exactly what means are different one from the other. Actually, testing means' differences is made by the quadratic rational F statistic ( F=MSB/MSW). In order to determine which mean differ from another mean or which contrast of means are significantly different, Post Hoc tests (Multiple Comparison tests) or planned tests should be conducted after obtaining a significant omnibus F test. It may be consider using the simple Bonferroni correction or other suitable correction. Another omnibus test we can find in ANOVA is the F test for testing one of the ANOVA assumptions: the equality of variance between groups. In One-Way ANOVA, for example, the hypotheses tested omnibus F test are:  H0: µ 1 =µ 2 =….= µ k  H1: at least one pair µ j ≠µ j'  These hypotheses examine model fit of the most common model: y ij = µ j + ε ij , where y ij is the dependant variable, µ j is the j-th independent variable's expectancy, which usually is referred as "group expectancy" or "factor expectancy"; and ε ij are the errors results on using the model.  The F statistics of the omnibus test is:    F  =      ∑   j  =  1   k       n  j     (     y  ¯   j   -   y  ¯    )   2    /   (   k  -  1   )        ∑   j  =  1   k       ∑   i  =  1    n  j        (    y   i  j    -    y  ¯   j    )   2   /   (   n  -  k   )           F      superscript   subscript     j  1    k        subscript  n  j    superscript     subscript   normal-¯  y   j    normal-¯  y    2      k  1       superscript   subscript     j  1    k     superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  n  j       superscript     subscript  y    i  j     subscript   normal-¯  y   j    2     n  k         F=\tfrac{{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{k}n_{j}\left(\bar{y}_{j}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}%
 }/{(k-1)}}{{\displaystyle{\sum_{j=1}^{k}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n_{j}}}\left(y_{ij}-\bar%
 {y}_{j}\right)^{2}}/{(n-k)}}   Where,    y  ¯     normal-¯  y    \bar{y}   is the overall sample mean,     y  ¯   j     subscript   normal-¯  y   j    \bar{y}_{j}   is the group j sample mean, k is the number of groups and n j is sample size of group j.  The F statistic is distributed F (k-1,n-k),(α) under assuming of null hypothesis and normality assumption. F test is considered robust in some situations, even when the normality assumption isn't met.  Model Assumptions in One-Way ANOVA   Random sampling.  Normal or approximately normal distribution of in each group.  Equal variances between groups. Which it's omnibus F test (like Levene's test , Bartlett's test or Fligner-Killeen's test for homogeneity of variance) test the following hypotheses :   H 0 : σ 1 = σ 2 = …. = σ k  H 1 : at least one pair σ j ≠ σ j'  If the assumption of equality of variances is not met, the Tamhane’s test is preferred. When this assumption is satisfied we can choose amongst several tests. Although the LSD (Fisher’s Least Significance Difference) is a very strong test in detecting pairs of means differences, it is applied only when the F test is significant, and it is mostly less preferable since its method fails in protecting low error rate. Bonferroni test is a good choice due to its correction suggested by his method. This correction states that if n independent tests are to be applied then the α in each test should be equal to α /n. Tukey’s method is also preferable by many statisticians because it control the overall error rate. (More information on this issue can be found in any ANOVA book, such as Douglas C. Montgomery’s Design and Analysis of Experiments). On small sample sizes, when the assumption of normality isn't met, a Nonparametric Analysis of Variance can be made by Kruskal-Wallis test, that is another omnibus test example ( see following example ). Alternative option is to use bootstrap methods to assess whether the group means are different. Bootstrap methods do not have any specific distributional assumptions and may be an appropriate tool to use like using re-sampling, which is one of the simplest bootstrap methods. You can extend the idea to the case of multiple groups and estimate p-values .  Example  A cellular survey on customers' time-wait was reviewed on 1,963 different customers during 7 days on each one of 20 in-sequential weeks. Assuming none of the customers called twice and none of them have customer relations among each other, One Way ANOVA was run on SPSS to find significant differences between the days time-wait:  ANOVA  Dependent Variable: time Minutes to Respond      Source   Sum of Squares   df   Mean Square   F   Sig.

The F statistics of the omnibus test is:    F  =      ∑   i  =  1   n       (     y  i   ^   -   y  ¯    )   2   /  k       ∑   j  =  1   k       ∑   i  =  1    n  j        (    y   i  j    -    y  i   ^    )   2   /   (   n  -  k  -  1   )           F      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript     normal-^   subscript  y  i     normal-¯  y    2   k      superscript   subscript     j  1    k     superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  n  j       superscript     subscript  y    i  j     normal-^   subscript  y  i     2     n  k  1         F=\frac{{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\widehat{y_{i}}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}/%

The F statistic is distributed F (k,n-k-1),(α) under assuming of null hypothesis and normality assumption.  Model Assumptions in Multiple Linear Regression   Random sampling.  Normal or approximately normal distribution of the errors e ij .  The errors e ij explanatory equals zero>, E(e ij )=0.  Equal variances of the errors e ij . Which it's omnibus F test ( like Levene F test).  No Multi-collinearity between explanatory/predictor variables' meaning: cov(x i ,x j )=0 where is i≠j, for any i or j.   The omnibus F test regarding the hypotheses over the coefficients  H 0 : β 1 = β 2 =….= β k = 0  H 1 : at least one pair β j ≠ β j'  The omnibus test examines whether there are any regression coefficients that are significantly non-zero, except for the coefficient β0. The β0 coefficient goes with the constant predictor and is usually not of interest. The null hypothesis is generally thought to be false and is easily rejected with a reasonable amount of data, but in contrary to ANOVA it is important to do the test anyway. When the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, this means the data are completely worthless. The model that has the constant regression function fits as well as the regression model, which means that no further analysis need be done. In many statistical researches the omnibus is usually significant, although part or most of the independent variables has no significance influence on the dependant variable. So the omnibus is useful only to imply whether the model fits or not, but it doesn't offers the corrected recommended model which can be fitted to the data. The omnibus test comes to be significant mostly if at least one of the independent variables is significant. Which means that any other variable may enter the model, under the model assumption of non-colinearity between independent variables, while the omnibus test still show significance, that is: the suggested model is fitted to the data. So significance of the omnibus F test (shown on ANOVA table) followed by model selection, which part of it is related to selection of significant independent variable which contribute to the dependant variable variation.  Example 1- The Omnibus F Test on SPSS  An insurance company intends to predict "Average cost of claims" (variable name "claimamt") by three independent variables (Predictors): "Number of claims" (variable name "nclaims"), "Policyholder age" (variable name holderage), "Vehicle age" (variable name vehicleage). Linear Regression procedure has been run on the data, as follows: The omnibus F test in the ANOVA table implies that the model involved these three predictors can fit for predicting "Average cost of claims", since the null hypothesis is rejected (P-Value=0.000 b====      Source   Sum of Squares   df   Mean Square   F   Sig.

The probabilities describing the possible outcome of a single trial are modeled, as a function of explanatory ( independent ) variables, using a logistic function or multinomial distribution. Logistic regression measures the relationship between a categorical or dichotomic dependent variable and usually a continuous independent variable (or several), by converting the dependent variable to probability scores. The probabilities can be retrieved using the logistic function or the multinomial distribution, while those probabilities, like in probability theory, takes on values between zero and one:       P   (   y  i   )    =    e     β  0   +     β  1    x   i  1     +      ⋅   +    β  k    x   i  k          1  +   e     β  0   +     β  1    x   i  1     +      ⋅   +    β  k    x   i  k           =   1   1  +   e   -   (   β  0   +   β  1    x   i  1    +  ⋅  +   β  k    x   i  k    )               P   subscript  y  i       superscript  e      subscript  β  0    limit-from     subscript  β  1    subscript  x    i  1         normal-⋅  absent       subscript  β  k    subscript  x    i  k           1   superscript  e      subscript  β  0    limit-from     subscript  β  1    subscript  x    i  1         normal-⋅  absent       subscript  β  k    subscript  x    i  k                  1    1   superscript  e   fragments    fragments  normal-(   subscript  β  0     subscript  β  1    subscript  x    i  1     normal-⋅    subscript  β  k    subscript  x    i  k    normal-)          P(y_{i})=\frac{e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i1}+\cdot+\beta_{k}x_{ik}}}{1+e^{\beta%
 _{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i1}+\cdot+\beta_{k}x_{ik}}}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_{0}+\beta_{%
 1}x_{i1}+\cdot+\beta_{k}x_{ik})}}     So the model tested can be defined by:      f   (   y  i   )   =  l  n    P   (   y  i   )     1  -   P   (   y  i   )      =   β  0   +   β  1    x   i  1    +  ⋅  +   β  k    x   i  k       fragments  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  y  i   normal-)    l  n      P   subscript  y  i      1    P   subscript  y  i        subscript  β  0     subscript  β  1    subscript  x    i  1     normal-⋅    subscript  β  k    subscript  x    i  k      f(y_{i})=ln\frac{P(y_{i})}{1-P(y_{i})}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i1}+\cdot+\beta_{%
 k}x_{ik}     ,whereas y i is the category of the dependant variable for the i-th observation and x ij is the j independent variable (j=1,2,...k) for that observation, β j is the j-th coefficient of x ij and indicates its influence on and expected from the fitted model .  Note: independent variables in logistic regression can also be continuous.  The omnibus test relates to the hypotheses  H 0 : β 1 = β 2 =….= β k  H 1 : at least one pair β j ≠ β j'  Model fitting: Maximum likelihood method  The omnibus test, among the other parts of the logistic regression procedure, is a likelihood-ratio test based on the maximum likelihood method. Unlike the Linear Regression procedure in which estimation of the regression coefficients can be derived from least square procedure or by minimizing the sum of squared residuals as in maximum likelihood method, in logistic regression there is no such an analytical solution or a set of equations from which one can derive a solution to estimate the regression coefficients. So logistic regression uses the maximum likelihood procedure to estimate the coefficients that maximize the likelihood of the regression coefficients given the predictors and criterion.[6] The maximum likelihood solution is an iterative process that begins with a tentative solution, revises it slightly to see if it can be improved, and repeats this process until improvement is minute, at which point the model is said to have converged.[6]. Applying the procedure in conditioned on convergence ( see also in the following "remarks and other considerations ").  In general, regarding simple hypotheses on parameter θ ( for example):H 0 : θ=θ 0 vs.H 1 : θ=θ 1 ,the likelihood ratio test statistic can be referred as:     λ   (   y  i   )    =    L   (   y  i   |   θ  0   )     L   (   y  i   |   θ  1   )           λ   subscript  y  i       fragments  L   fragments  normal-(   subscript  y  i   normal-|   subscript  θ  0   normal-)     fragments  L   fragments  normal-(   subscript  y  i   normal-|   subscript  θ  1   normal-)       \lambda(y_{i})=\frac{L(y_{i}|\theta_{0})}{L(y_{i}|\theta_{1})}     ,where L(y i |θ) is the likelihood function, which refers to the specific θ.  The numerator corresponds to the maximum likelihood of an observed outcome under the null hypothesis. The denominator corresponds to the maximum likelihood of an observed outcome varying parameters over the whole parameter space. The numerator of this ratio is less than the denominator. The likelihood ratio hence is between 0 and 1.  Lower values of the likelihood ratio mean that the observed result was much less likely to occur under the null hypothesis as compared to the alternative. Higher values of the statistic mean that the observed outcome was more than or equally likely or nearly as likely to occur under the null hypothesis as compared to the alternative, and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.  The likelihood ratio test provides the following decision rule:  If      λ   (   y  i   )    >  C        λ   subscript  y  i    C    \lambda(y_{i})>C    do not reject H 0 ,  otherwise  If      λ   (   y  i   )    =  C        λ   subscript  y  i    C    \lambda(y_{i})=C    reject H 0  and also reject H 0 with probability  q  if    D  =   -   2  l  n  λ   (   y  i   )         D      2  l  n  λ   subscript  y  i       D=-2ln\lambda(y_{i})   ,  whereas the critical values  c, q  are usually chosen to obtain a specified significance level α, through the relation:     D  =   -   2  l  n  λ   (   y  i   )     =   -   2  l  n    l  i  k  e  l  i  h  o  o   d   u  n  d  e   r   f  i  t  t  e   d   m  o  d  e   l   i   f   n  u  l   l   h  y  p  o  t  h  e  s  i   s   i   s   t  r  u  e    l  i  k  e  l  i  h  o  o   d   u  n  d  e   r   s  a  t  u  r  a  t  e   d   m  o  d  e   l             D      2  l  n  λ   subscript  y  i              2  l  n      l  i  k  e  l  i  h  o  o  d  u  n  d  e  r  f  i  t  t  e  d  m  o  d  e  l  i  f  n  u  l  l  h  y  p  o  t  h  e  s  i  s  i  s  t  r  u  e     l  i  k  e  l  i  h  o  o  d  u  n  d  e  r  s  a  t  u  r  a  t  e  d  m  o  d  e  l         D=-2ln\lambda(y_{i})=-2ln\frac{likelihood\ under\ fitted\ model\ if\ null\ %
 hypothesis\ is\ true}{likelihood\ under\ saturated\ model\ }    .  Thus, the likelihood-ratio test rejects the null hypothesis if the value of this statistic is too small. How small is too small depends on the significance level of the test, i.e., on what probability of Type I error is considered tolerable The Neyman-Pearson lemma [8] states that this likelihood ratio test is the most powerful among all level-α tests for this problem.  Test's Statistic and Distribution: Wilks' theorem  First we define the test statistic as the deviate $D=-2ln\lambda(y_i)$ which indicates testing the ratio:  $D=-2ln\lambda(y_i)=-2ln\frac{likelihood\ under\ fitted\ model\ if\ null\ hypothesis\ is\ true}{likelihood\ under\ saturated\ model\ }$  While the saturated model is a model with a theoretically perfect fit. Given that deviance is a measure of the difference between a given model and the saturated model, smaller values indicate better fit as the fitted model deviates less from the saturated model. When assessed upon a chi-square distribution, non-significant chi-square values indicate very little unexplained variance and thus, good model fit. Conversely, a significant chi-square value indicates that a significant amount of the variance is unexplained. Two measures of deviance D are particularly important in logistic regression: null deviance and model deviance. The null deviance represents the difference between a model with only the intercept and no predictors and the saturated model. And, the model deviance represents the difference between a model with at least one predictor and the saturated model.[3] In this respect, the null model provides a baseline upon which to compare predictor models. Therefore, to assess the contribution of a predictor or set of predictors, one can subtract the model deviance from the null deviance and assess the difference on a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom. If the model deviance is significantly smaller than the null deviance then one can conclude that the predictor or set of predictors significantly improved model fit. This is analogous to the F-test used in linear regression analysis to assess the significance of prediction. In most cases, the exact distribution of the likelihood ratio corresponding to specific hypotheses is very difficult to determine. A convenient result, attributed to Samuel S. Wilks, says that as the sample size n approaches the test statistic has asymptotically distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of and parameters the β coefficients as mentioned before on the omnibus test. e.g., if n is large enough and if the fitted model assuming the null hypothesis consist of 3 predictors and the saturated ( full ) model consist of 5 predictors, the Wilks' statistic is approximately distributed ( with 2 degrees of freedom). This means that we can retrieve the critical value C from the chi squared with 2 degrees of freedom under a specific significance level.  Remarks and other considerations   In some instances the model may not reach convergence. When a model does not converge this indicates that the coefficients are not reliable as the model never reached a final solution. Lack of convergence may result from a number of problems: having a large ratio of predictors to cases, multi-collinearity, sparseness, or complete separation. Although not a precise number, as a rule of thumb, logistic regression models require a minimum of 10 cases per variable. Having a large proportion of variables to cases results in an overly conservative Wald statistic (discussed below) and can lead to non convergence.  Multi-collinearity refers to unacceptably high correlations between predictors. As multi-collinearity increases, coefficients remain unbiased but standard errors increase and the likelihood of model convergence decreases. To detect multi-collinearity amongst the predictors, one can conduct a linear regression analysis with the predictors of interest for the sole purpose of examining the tolerance statistic used to assess whether multi-collinearity is unacceptably high.  Sparseness in the data refers to having a large proportion of empty cells (cells with zero counts). Zero cell counts are particularly problematic with categorical predictors. With continuous predictors, the model can infer values for the zero cell counts, but this is not the case with categorical predictors. The reason the model will not converge with zero cell counts for categorical predictors is because the natural logarithm of zero is an undefined value, so final solutions to the model cannot be reached. To remedy this problem, researchers may collapse categories in a theoretically meaningful way or may consider adding a constant to all cells.[6] Another numerical problem that may lead to a lack of convergence is complete separation, which refers to the instance in which the predictors perfectly predict the criterion - all cases are accurately classified. In such instances, one should reexamine the data, as there is likely some kind of error.  Wald statistic is defined by, where is the sample estimation of and is the standard error of . Alternatively, when assessing the contribution of individual predictors in a given model, one may examine the significance of the Wald statistic. The Wald statistic, analogous to the t-test in linear regression, is used to assess the significance of coefficients. The Wald statistic is the ratio of the square of the regression coefficient to the square of the standard error of the coefficient and is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square distribution. Although several statistical packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS) report the Wald statistic to assess the contribution of individual predictors, the Wald statistic has some limitations. First, When the regression coefficient is large, the standard error of the regression coefficient also tends to be large increasing the probability of Type-II error. Secondly, the Wald statistic also tends to be biased when data are sparse.  Model Fit involving categorical predictors may be achieved by using log-linear modeling.   Example 1 of Logistic Regression [3]  Spector and Mazzeo examined the effect of a teaching method known as PSI on the performance of students in a course, intermediate macro economics. The question was whether students exposed to the method scored higher on exams in the class. They collected data from students in two classes, one in which PSI was used and another in which a traditional teaching method was employed. For each of 32 students, they gathered data on  Independent Variables  • GPA-Grade point average before taking the class. • TUCE-the score on an exam given at the beginning of the term to test entering knowledge of the material. • PSI- a dummy variable indicating the teaching method used (1 = used Psi, 0 = other method).  Dependent Variable  • GRADE — coded 1 if the final grade was an A, 0 if the final grade was a B or C.  The particular interest in the research was whether PSI had a significant effect on GRADE. TUCE and GPA are included as control variables.  Statistical analysis using logistic regression of Grade on GPA, Tuce and Psi was conducted in SPSS using Stepwise Logistic Regression.  In the output, the "block" line relates to Chi-Square test on the set of independent variables that are tested and included in the model fitting. The "step" line relates to Chi-Square test on the step level while variables included in the model step by step. Note that in the output a step chi-square, is the same as the block chi-square since they both are testing the same hypothesis that the tested variables enter on this step are non-zero. If you were doing stepwise regression , however, the results would be different. Using forward stepwise selection, researchers divided the variables into two blocks (see METHOD on the syntax following below).  LOGISTIC REGRESSION VAR=grade  /METHOD=fstep psi / fstep gpa tuce  /CRITERIA PIN(.50) POUT(.10) ITERATE(20) CUT(.5).  The default PIN value is .05, was changed by the researchers to .5 so the insignificant TUCE would make it in. In the first block, psi alone gets entered, so the block and step Chi Test relates to the hypothesis H0: βPSI = 0. Results of the omnibus Chi-Square tests implies that PSI is significant for predicting that GRADE is more likely to be a final grade of A.  =====Block 1: Method = Forward Stepwise (Conditional) [6] =====  Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients       Chi-Square   df   Sig.       step1  Step   5.842   1   .016     Block   5.842   1   .016     Model   5.842   1   .016     Then, in the next block, the forward selection procedure causes GPA to get entered first, then TUCE (see METHOD command on the syntax before).  =====Block 2: Method = Forward Stepwise (Conditional)=====  Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients       Chi-Square   df   Sig.

The model chi-square, 15.404, tells you whether any of the three Independent Variabls has significant effects. It is the equivalent of a global F test, i.e. it tests H 0 : β GPA = β TUCE = β PSI = 0.   Tests of Individual Parameters shown on the "variables in the equation table", which Wald test (W=(b/sb)2, where b is β estimation and sb is its standard error estimation ) that is testing whether any individual parameter equals zero . You can, if you want, do an incremental LR chi-square test. That, in fact, is the best way to do it, since the Wald test referred to next is biased under certain situations. When parameters are tested separately, by controlling the other parameters, we see that the effects of GPA and PSI are statistically significant, but the effect of TUCE is not. Both have Exp(β) greater than 1, implying that the probability to get "A" grade is greater than getting other grade depends upon the teaching method PSI and a former grade average GPA.

Variable(s) entered on step 1: PSI  Example 2 of Logistic Regression [7]  Research subject: “The Effects of Employment, Education, Rehabilitation and Seriousness of Offense on Re-Arrest” [8]. A social worker in a criminal justice probation agency, tends to examine whether some of the factors are leading to re-arrest of those managed by your agency over the past five years who were convicted and then released. The data consist of 1,000 clients with the following variables:  Dependent Variable (coded as a dummy variable)  • Re-arrested vs. not re-arrested (0 = not re-arrested; 1 = re-arrested) – categorical, nominal  Independent Variables (coded as a dummy variables)   Whether or not the client was adjudicated for a second criminal offense (1= adjudicated,0=not).  Seriousness of first offense (1=felony vs. 0=misdemeanor) -categorical, nominal  High school graduate vs. not (0 = not graduated; 1 = graduated) - categorical, nominal  Whether or not client completed a rehabilitation program after the first offense,0 = no rehab completed; 1 = rehab completed)-categorical, nominal  Employment status after first offense (0 = not employed; 1 = employed)   Note: Continuous independent variables were not measured on this scenario.  The null hypothesis for the overall model fit: The overall model does not predict re-arrest. OR, the independent variables as a group are not related to being re-arrested. (And For the Independent variables: any of the separate independent variables is not related to the likelihood of re-arrest).  The alternative hypothesis for the overall model fit: The overall model predicts the likelihood of re-arrest. (The meaning respectively independent variables: having committed a felony (vs. a misdemeanor), not completing high school, not completing a rehab program, and being unemployed are related to the likelihood of being re-arrested).  Logistic regression was applied to the data on SPSS, since the Dependent variable is Categorical (dichotomous) and the researcher examine the odd ratio of potentially being re-arrested vs. not expected to be re-arrested.
