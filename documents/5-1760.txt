   Von Mangoldt function      Von Mangoldt function   In mathematics , the von Mangoldt function is an arithmetic function named after German mathematician Hans von Mangoldt . It is an example of an important arithmetic function that is neither multiplicative nor additive .  Definition  The von Mangoldt function, denoted by    Λ   (  n  )       normal-Λ  n    Λ(n)   , is defined as       Λ   (  n  )    =   {      log  p        if  n   =    p  k   for some prime  p  and integer  k   ≥  1   ,       0    otherwise.            normal-Λ  n    cases    p         if  n      superscript  p  k   for some prime  p  and integer  k        1    0  otherwise.     \Lambda(n)=\begin{cases}\log p&\text{if }n=p^{k}\text{ for some prime }p\text{%
  and integer }k\geq 1,\\
 0&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}     The values of    Λ   (  n  )       normal-Λ  n    Λ(n)   for the first nine positive numbers are       0  ,   log  2   ,   log  3   ,   log  2   ,   log  5   ,  0  ,   log  7   ,   log  2   ,   log  3    ,     0    2     3     2     5   0    7     2     3     0,\log 2,\log 3,\log 2,\log 5,0,\log 7,\log 2,\log 3,     which is related to .  The summatory von Mangoldt function ,    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    ψ(x)   , also known as the Chebyshev function , is defined as        ψ   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  ≤  x     Λ   (  n  )      .        ψ  x     subscript     n  x      normal-Λ  n      \psi(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}\Lambda(n).     von Mangoldt provided a rigorous proof of an explicit formula for    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    ψ(x)   involving a sum over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function . This was an important part of the first proof of the prime number theorem .  Properties  The von Mangoldt function satisfies the identity 1 2        log   (  n  )    =    ∑   d  ∣  n     Λ   (  d  )      .        n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n      normal-Λ  d      \log(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}\Lambda(d).     The sum is taken over all integers    d   d   d   that divide    n   n   n   . This is proved by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic , since the terms that are not powers of primes are equal to   0   0    . For example, consider the case 12 {{=}} 2 2 × 3}} . Then        ∑   d  ∣  12      Λ   (  d  )        subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  12      normal-Λ  d     \displaystyle\sum_{d\mid 12}\Lambda(d)     By Möbius inversion , we have 3 4 5        Λ   (  n  )    =   -    ∑   d  ∣  n     μ   (  d  )    log   (  d  )        .        normal-Λ  n       subscript    fragments  d  normal-∣  n      μ  d    d        \Lambda(n)=-\sum_{d\mid n}\mu(d)\log(d)\ .     Dirichlet series  The von Mangoldt function plays an important role in the theory of Dirichlet series , and in particular, the Riemann zeta function . In particular, one has         log  ζ    (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  2   ∞       Λ   (  n  )     log   (  n  )       1   n  s       ,    Re   (  s  )    >  1.      formulae-sequence        ζ   s     superscript   subscript     n  2            normal-Λ  n     n      1   superscript  n  s           Re  s   1.     \log\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{\log(n)}\,\frac{1}{n^{s}},%
 \qquad\text{Re}(s)>1.     The logarithmic derivative is then          ζ  ′    (  s  )     ζ   (  s  )     =   -    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     Λ   (  n  )     n  s       .           superscript  ζ  normal-′   s     ζ  s        superscript   subscript     n  1          normal-Λ  n    superscript  n  s        \frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}}.     These are special cases of a more general relation on Dirichlet series. If one has       F   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     f   (  n  )     n  s           F  s     superscript   subscript     n  1          f  n    superscript  n  s       F(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{f(n)}{n^{s}}     for a completely multiplicative function     f   (  n  )       f  n    f(n)   , and the series converges for , then         F  ′    (  s  )     F   (  s  )     =   -    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     f   (  n  )   Λ   (  n  )     n  s               superscript  F  normal-′   s     F  s        superscript   subscript     n  1          f  n  normal-Λ  n    superscript  n  s        \frac{F^{\prime}(s)}{F(s)}=-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{f(n)\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}}     converges for .  Chebyshev function  The second Chebyshev function  ψ ( x ) is the summatory function of the von Mangoldt function: 6        ψ   (  x  )    =    ∑    p  k   ≤  x     log  p    =    ∑   n  ≤  x     Λ   (  n  )      .          ψ  x     subscript      superscript  p  k   x      p           subscript     n  x      normal-Λ  n       \psi(x)=\sum_{p^{k}\leq x}\log p=\sum_{n\leq x}\Lambda(n)\ .     The Mellin transform of the Chebyshev function can be found by applying Perron's formula :         ζ  ′    (  s  )     ζ   (  s  )     =   -   s    ∫  1  ∞       ψ   (  x  )     x   s  +  1      d  x               superscript  ζ  normal-′   s     ζ  s        s    superscript   subscript   1           ψ  x    superscript  x    s  1     d  x        \frac{\zeta^{\prime}(s)}{\zeta(s)}=-s\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{\psi(x)}{x^{s+1}}%
 \,dx     which holds for     R  e   (  s  )    >  1        R  e  s   1    Re(s)>1   .  Exponential series  (Figure)  Mangoldt-series.svg   Hardy and Littlewood examined the series 7       F   (  y  )    =    ∑   n  =  2   ∞     (    Λ   (  n  )    -  1   )    e   -   n  y             F  y     superscript   subscript     n  2            normal-Λ  n   1    superscript  e      n  y         F(y)=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\left(\Lambda(n)-1\right)e^{-ny}     in the limit . Assuming the Riemann hypothesis , they demonstrate that        F   (  y  )    =   O   (   1   y    )     .        F  y     O    1    y       F(y)=O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}\right).     Curiously, they also show that this function is oscillatory as well, with diverging oscillations. In particular, there exists a value    K  >  0      K  0    K>0   such that        F   (  y  )    <    -   K   y     ,  and      F   (  y  )    >   K   y        formulae-sequence      F  y        K    y     and        F  y     K    y       F(y)<-\frac{K}{\sqrt{y}},\quad\text{ and }\quad F(y)>\frac{K}{\sqrt{y}}     infinitely often. The graphic to the right indicates that this behaviour is not at first numerically obvious: the oscillations are not clearly seen until the series is summed in excess of 100 million terms, and are only readily visible when .  Riesz mean  The Riesz mean of the von Mangoldt function is given by        ∑   n  ≤  λ        (   1  -    n  λ     )   δ   Λ   (  n  )        subscript     n  λ       superscript    1    n  λ    δ   normal-Λ  n     \displaystyle\sum_{n\leq\lambda}\left(1-\frac{n}{\lambda}\right)^{\delta}%
 \Lambda(n)     Here,   λ   λ   λ   and   δ   δ   δ   are numbers characterizing the Riesz mean. One must take    c  >  1      c  1    c>1   . The sum over   ρ   ρ   ρ   is the sum over the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function, and       ∑  n     c  n     λ   -  n          subscript   n      subscript  c  n    superscript  λ    n       \sum_{n}c_{n}\lambda^{-n}\,     can be shown to be a convergent series for    λ  >  1      λ  1    λ>1   .  Approximation by Riemann zeta zeros  (Figure)  The first Riemann zeta zero wave in the sum that approximates the von Mangoldt function   The real part of the sum over the zeta zeros:      -    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    n   ρ   (  i  )            superscript   subscript     i  1       superscript  n    ρ  i       -\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}n^{\rho(i)}   , where    ρ   (  i  )       ρ  i    ρ(i)   is the   i   i   i   -th zeta zero, peaks at primes, as can be seen in the adjoining graph, and can also be verified through numerical computation. It does not sum up to the Von Mangoldt function. 8  (Figure)  The Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function gives a spectrum with imaginary parts of Riemann zeta zeros as spikes at the   x   x   x   -axis ordinates (right), while the von Mangoldt function can be approximated by zeta zero waves (left)   The Fourier transform of the von Mangoldt function gives a spectrum with spikes at ordinates equal to imaginary part of the Riemann zeta function zeros. This is sometimes called a duality.
