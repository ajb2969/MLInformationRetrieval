Methionine racemase




Methionine racemase

In enzymology, a methionine racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-methionine 
 
 
 
  D-methionine
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-methionine, and one product, D-methionine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methionine racemase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
