   N-acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan 4-beta-glucuronosyltransferase      N-acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan 4-beta-glucuronosyltransferase   In enzymology , a N-acetylglucosaminyl-proteoglycan 4-beta-glucuronosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl- proteoglycan   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)- beta-D-glucuronosyl-proteoglycan   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate , N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl- , and proteoglycan , whereas its 3 products are UDP , beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)- , and beta-D-glucuronosyl-proteoglycan .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate:N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D- glucuronosyl-proteoglycan 4-beta-glucuronosyltransferase . Other names in common use include N-acetylglucosaminylproteoglycan beta-1,4-glucuronyltransferase , and heparan glucuronyltransferase II . This enzyme participates in heparan sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
