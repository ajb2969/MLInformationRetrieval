   Minimal-entropy martingale measure      Minimal-entropy martingale measure   In probability theory , the minimal-entropy martingale measure (MEMM) is the risk-neutral probability measure that minimises the entropy difference between the objective probability measure,   P   P   P   , and the risk-neutral measure,   Q   Q   Q   . In incomplete markets , this is one way of choosing a risk-neutral measure (from the infinite number available) so as to still maintain the no-arbitrage conditions.  The MEMM has the advantage that the measure   Q   Q   Q   will always be equivalent to the measure   P   P   P   by construction. Another common choice of equivalent martingale measure is the minimal martingale measure, which minimises the variance of the equivalent martingale . For certain situations, the resultant measure   Q   Q   Q   will not be equivalent to   P   P   P   .  In a finite probability model, for objective probabilities    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   and risk-neutral probabilities    q  i     subscript  q  i    q_{i}   then one must minimise the Kullback–Leibler divergence      D   K  L     (  Q  ∥  P  )   =   ∑   i  =  1   N    q  i   ln   (    q  i    p  i    )      fragments   subscript  D    K  L     fragments  normal-(  Q  parallel-to  P  normal-)     superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  q  i     fragments  normal-(     subscript  q  i    subscript  p  i    normal-)     D_{KL}(Q\|P)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}q_{i}\ln\left(\frac{q_{i}}{p_{i}}\right)   subject to the requirement that the expected return is   r   r   r   , where   r   r   r   is the risk-free rate.
