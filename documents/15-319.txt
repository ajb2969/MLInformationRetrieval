Minimal-entropy martingale measure

In probability theory, the minimal-entropy martingale measure (MEMM) is the risk-neutral probability measure that minimises the entropy difference between the objective probability measure, 
 
 
 
 , and the risk-neutral measure, 
 
 
 
 . In incomplete markets, this is one way of choosing a risk-neutral measure (from the infinite number available) so as to still maintain the no-arbitrage conditions.
The MEMM has the advantage that the measure 
 
 
 
  will always be equivalent to the measure 
 
 
 
  by construction. Another common choice of equivalent martingale measure is the minimal martingale measure, which minimises the variance of the equivalent martingale. For certain situations, the resultant measure 
 
 
 
  will not be equivalent to 
 
 
 
 .
In a finite probability model, for objective probabilities 
 
 
 
  and risk-neutral probabilities 
 
 
 
  then one must minimise the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence

 
  subject to the requirement that the expected return is 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the risk-free rate.
