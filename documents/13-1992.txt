Caffeine synthase




Caffeine synthase

Caffeine synthase is a methyltransferase enzyme involved in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway. It is expressed in tea species, coffee species, and cocoa species. The enzyme catalyses the following reactions:1

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + theobromine

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + caffeine + H+
S-adenosyl-L-methionine + paraxanthine

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + caffeine + H+
7-methylxanthine + S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + H+ + theobromine

Caffeine synthase is expressed in the Camellia species irrawadiensis, ptilophylla, and sinensis;2 the Coffea species arabica,34 and canephora;5 and in Theobroma cacao.6
