Inner regular measure

In mathematics, an inner regular measure is one for which the measure of a set can be approximated from within by compact subsets.
Definition
Let (X, T) be a Hausdorff topological space and let Σ be a σ-algebra on X that contains the topology T (so that every open set is a measurable set, and Σ is at least as fine as the Borel σ-algebra on X). Then a measure μ on the measurable space (X, Σ) is called inner regular if, for every set A in Σ,



This property is sometimes referred to in words as "approximation from within by compact sets."
Some authors12 use the term tight as a synonym for inner regular. This use of the term is closely related to tightness of a family of measures, since a measure μ is inner regular if and only if, for all ε > 0, there is some compact subset K of X such that μ(X \ K)
