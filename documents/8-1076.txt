   Inner regular measure      Inner regular measure   In mathematics , an inner regular measure is one for which the measure of a set can be approximated from within by compact  subsets .  Definition  Let ( X , T ) be a Hausdorff  topological space and let Σ be a σ-algebra on X that contains the topology T (so that every open set is a measurable set , and Σ is at least as fine as the Borel σ-algebra on X ). Then a measure μ on the measurable space ( X , Σ) is called inner regular if, for every set A in Σ,        μ   (  A  )    =   sup   {   μ   (  K  )    ∣    compact  K   ⊆  A   }     .        μ  A    supremum   conditional-set    μ  K       compact  K   A       \mu(A)=\sup\{\mu(K)\mid\text{compact }K\subseteq A\}.     This property is sometimes referred to in words as "approximation from within by compact sets."  Some authors 1 2 use the term tight as a synonym for inner regular. This use of the term is closely related to tightness of a family of measures , since a measure μ is inner regular if and only if , for all ε > 0, there is some compact subset  K of X such that μ ( X \ K )  See also   Radon measure  Regular measure   "  Category:Measures (measure theory)     ↩   ↩
