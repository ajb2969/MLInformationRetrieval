   Dimension function      Dimension function   In mathematics , the notion of an ( exact ) dimension function (also known as a gauge function ) is a tool in the study of fractals and other subsets of metric spaces . Dimension functions are a generalisation of the simple " diameter to the dimension " power law used in the construction of s -dimensional Hausdorff measure .  Motivation: s -dimensional Hausdorff measure  Consider a metric space ( X , d ) and a subset  E of X . Given a number s ≥ 0, the s -dimensional Hausdorff measure of E , denoted μ s ( E ), is defined by         μ  s    (  E  )    =    lim   δ  →  0      μ  δ  s    (  E  )      ,         superscript  μ  s   E     subscript    normal-→  δ  0       superscript   subscript  μ  δ   s   E      \mu^{s}(E)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}\mu_{\delta}^{s}(E),     where         μ  δ  s    (  E  )    =   inf   {    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    diam    (   C  i   )   s     |     diam   (   C  i   )    ≤  δ   ,     ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    C  i    ⊇  E    }     .         superscript   subscript  μ  δ   s   E    infimum   conditional-set    superscript   subscript     i  1        diam   superscript   subscript  C  i   s      formulae-sequence      diam   subscript  C  i    δ     E    superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  C  i          \mu_{\delta}^{s}(E)=\inf\left\{\left.\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathrm{diam}(C_{i})^{%
 s}\right|\mathrm{diam}(C_{i})\leq\delta,\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}C_{i}\supseteq E%
 \right\}.     μ δ s ( E ) can be thought of as an approximation to the "true" s -dimensional area/volume of E given by calculating the minimal s -dimensional area/volume of a covering of E by sets of diameter at most δ .  As a function of increasing s , μ s ( E ) is non-increasing. In fact, for all values of s , except possibly one, H s ( E ) is either 0 or +∞; this exceptional value is called the Hausdorff dimension of E , here denoted dim H ( E ). Intuitively speaking, μ s ( E ) = +∞ for s H( E ) for the same reason as the 1-dimensional linear length of a 2-dimensional disc in the Euclidean plane is +∞; likewise, μ s ( E ) = 0 for s > dim H ( E ) for the same reason as the 3-dimensional volume of a disc in the Euclidean plane is zero.  The idea of a dimension function is to use different functions of diameter than just diam( C ) s for some s , and to look for the same property of the Hausdorff measure being finite and non-zero.  Definition  Let ( X , d ) be a metric space and E ⊆ X . Let h : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞] be a function. Define μ h ( E ) by         μ  h    (  E  )    =    lim   δ  →  0      μ  δ  h    (  E  )      ,         superscript  μ  h   E     subscript    normal-→  δ  0       superscript   subscript  μ  δ   h   E      \mu^{h}(E)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}\mu_{\delta}^{h}(E),     where         μ  δ  h    (  E  )    =   inf   {    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    h   (   diam   (   C  i   )    )     |     diam   (   C  i   )    ≤  δ   ,     ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    C  i    ⊇  E    }     .         superscript   subscript  μ  δ   h   E    infimum   conditional-set    superscript   subscript     i  1        h    diam   subscript  C  i       formulae-sequence      diam   subscript  C  i    δ     E    superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  C  i          \mu_{\delta}^{h}(E)=\inf\left\{\left.\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}h\left(\mathrm{diam}(C%
 _{i})\right)\right|\mathrm{diam}(C_{i})\leq\delta,\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}C_{i}%
 \supseteq E\right\}.     Then h is called an ( exact ) dimension function (or gauge function ) for E if μ h ( E ) is finite and strictly positive. There are many conventions as to the properties that h should have: Rogers (1998), for example, requires that h should be monotonically increasing for t ≥ 0, strictly positive for t > 0, and continuous on the right for all t ≥ 0.  Packing dimension  Packing dimension is constructed in a very similar way to Hausdorff dimension, except that one "packs" E from inside with pairwise disjoint balls of diameter at most δ . Just as before, one can consider functions h : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞] more general than h ( δ ) = δ s and call h an exact dimension function for E if the h -packing measure of E is finite and strictly positive.  Example  Almost surely , a sample path X of Brownian motion in the Euclidean plane has Hausdorff dimension equal to 2, but the 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure μ 2 ( X ) is zero. The exact dimension function h is given by the logarithmic correction        h   (  r  )    =    r  2   ⋅   log    1  r   ⋅   log   log   log   1  r          .        h  r    normal-⋅   superscript  r  2      normal-⋅    1  r           1  r           h(r)=r^{2}\cdot\log\frac{1}{r}\cdot\log\log\log\frac{1}{r}.     I.e., with probability one, 0 h ( X ) 2. For Brownian motion in Euclidean n -space R n with n ≥ 3, the exact dimension function is        h   (  r  )    =    r  2   ⋅   log   log   1  r       .        h  r    normal-⋅   superscript  r  2         1  r        h(r)=r^{2}\cdot\log\log\frac{1}{r}.
