The Knaster-Kuratowski fan, or "Cantor's teepee"

In topology, a branch of mathematics, the Knaster窶適uratowski fan (also known as Cantor's leaky tent or Cantor's teepee depending on the presence or absence of the apex) is a connected topological space with the property that the removal of a single point makes it totally disconnected.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Cantor set, let 
 
 
 
  be the point 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 , denote the line segment connecting 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is an endpoint of an interval deleted in the Cantor set, let 
 
 
 
 
 ; for all other points in 
 
 
 
  let 
 
 
 
 ; the Knaster窶適uratowski fan is defined as 
 
 
 
  equipped with the subspace topology inherited from the standard topology on 
 
 
 
 .
The fan itself is connected, but becomes totally disconnected upon the removal of 
 
 
 
 
 .
