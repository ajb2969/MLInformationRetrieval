   Knaster–Kuratowski fan      Knaster–Kuratowski fan   (Figure)  The Knaster-Kuratowski fan, or " Cantor's  teepee "   In topology , a branch of mathematics, the Knaster – Kuratowski fan (also known as Cantor's leaky tent or Cantor's teepee depending on the presence or absence of the apex ) is a connected  topological space with the property that the removal of a single point makes it totally disconnected .  Let   C   C   C   be the Cantor set , let   p   p   p   be the point     (   1  2   ,   1  2   )   ∈   ℝ  2          1  2     1  2     superscript  ℝ  2     (\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{2}   , and let    L   (  c  )       L  c    L(c)   , for    c  ∈  C      c  C    c\in C   , denote the line segment connecting    (  c  ,  0  )     c  0    (c,0)   to   p   p   p   . If    c  ∈  C      c  C    c\in C   is an endpoint of an interval deleted in the Cantor set, let     X  c   =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   L   (  c  )     :   y  ∈  ℚ   }        subscript  X  c    conditional-set     x  y     L  c      y  ℚ      X_{c}=\{(x,y)\in L(c):y\in\mathbb{Q}\}   ; for all other points in   C   C   C   let     X  c   =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   L   (  c  )     :   y  ∉  ℚ   }        subscript  X  c    conditional-set     x  y     L  c      y  ℚ      X_{c}=\{(x,y)\in L(c):y\notin\mathbb{Q}\}   ; the Knaster–Kuratowski fan is defined as     ⋃   c  ∈  C     X  c       subscript     c  C     subscript  X  c     \bigcup_{c\in C}X_{c}   equipped with the subspace topology inherited from the standard topology on    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   .  The fan itself is connected, but becomes totally disconnected upon the removal of   p   p   p   .  References      External links  "  Category:Topological spaces
