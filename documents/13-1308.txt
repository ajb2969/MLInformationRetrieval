   Slow-growing hierarchy      Slow-growing hierarchy   In computability theory , computational complexity theory and proof theory , the slow-growing hierarchy is an ordinal-indexed family of slowly increasing functions g α : N → N (where N is the set of natural numbers , {0, 1, ...}). It contrasts with the fast-growing hierarchy .  Definition  Let μ be a large countable ordinal such that a fundamental sequence is assigned to every limit ordinal less than μ. The slow-growing hierarchy of functions g α : N → N , for α  g_0(n) = 0         g   k  +  1     (  n  )    =     g  k    (  n  )    +  1          subscript  g    k  1    n        subscript  g  k   n   1     g_{k+1}(n)=g_{k}(n)+1           g  α    (  n  )    =    g   α   [  n  ]      (  n  )           subscript  g  α   n      subscript  g    α   delimited-[]  n     n     g_{\alpha}(n)=g_{\alpha[n]}(n)   for limit ordinal α.   Here α[ n ] denotes the n th element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal α.  The article on the Fast-growing hierarchy describes a standardized choice for fundamental sequence for all α 0.  Relation to fast-growing hierarchy  The slow-growing hierarchy grows much more slowly than the fast-growing hierarchy. Even g ε 0 is only equivalent to f 3 and g α only attains the growth of f ε 0 (the first function that Peano arithmetic cannot prove total in the hierarchy) when α is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal . 1 2 3  However, Girard proved that the slow-growing hierarchy eventually catches up with the fast-growing one. 4 Specifically, that there exists an ordinal α such that for all integers n   g α ( n ) α( n ) α( n + 1)   where f α are the functions in the fast-growing hierarchy. He further showed that the first α this holds for is the ordinal of the theory ID <ω of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. 5 However for the assignment of fundamental sequences found in 6 the first match up occurs at the level ε 0 . 7 For Buchholz style tree ordinals it could be shown that the first match up even occurs at    ω  2     superscript  ω  2    \omega^{2}   .  Extensions of the result proved 8 to considerably larger ordinals show that there are very few ordinals below the ordinal of transfinitely iterated    Π  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   1    \Pi^{1}_{1}   -comprehension where the slow- and fast-growing hierarchy match up. 9  The slow-growing hierarchy depends extremely sensitively on the choice of the underlying fundamental sequences. 10 11 12 13  Relation to term rewriting  Cichon provided an interesting connection between the slow-growing hierarchy and derivation length for term rewriting. 14  References   PDF's: part 1  2  3 .
