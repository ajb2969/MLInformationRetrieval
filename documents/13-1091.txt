   Somos sequence      Somos sequence   In mathematics , a Somos sequence is a sequence of numbers defined by a certain recurrence relation , described below. They were discovered by mathematician Michael Somos . It is not obvious from the form of their defining recurrence that every number in a Somos sequence is an integer , but nevertheless many Somos sequences have the property that all of their members are integers.  Recurrence equations  For an integer number k larger than 1, the Somos- k sequence    (   a  0   ,   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  )      subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…    (a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots)   is defined by the equation        a  n    a   n  -  k     =     a   n  -  1     a    n  -  k   +  1     +    a   n  -  2     a    n  -  k   +  2     +  ⋯  +    a   n  -    (   k  -  1   )   /  2      a   n  -    (   k  +  1   )   /  2              subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  k          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a      n  k   1        subscript  a    n  2     subscript  a      n  k   2     normal-⋯     subscript  a    n      k  1   2      subscript  a    n      k  1   2         a_{n}a_{n-k}=a_{n-1}a_{n-k+1}+a_{n-2}a_{n-k+2}+\cdots+a_{n-(k-1)/2}a_{n-(k+1)/2}   when k is odd, or by the analogous equation        a  n    a   n  -  k     =     a   n  -  1     a    n  -  k   +  1     +    a   n  -  2     a    n  -  k   +  2     +  ⋯  +    (   a   n  -   k  /  2     )   2           subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  k          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a      n  k   1        subscript  a    n  2     subscript  a      n  k   2     normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  a    n    k  2     2      a_{n}a_{n-k}=a_{n-1}a_{n-k+1}+a_{n-2}a_{n-k+2}+\cdots+(a_{n-k/2})^{2}   when k is even, together with the initial values   a i = 1 for i < k .   For k = 2 or 3, these recursions are very simple (there is no addition on the right-hand side) and they define the all-ones sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...). In the first nontrivial case, k = 4, the defining equation is        a  n    a   n  -  4     =     a   n  -  1     a   n  -  3     +   a   n  -  2   2           subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  4          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a    n  3      superscript   subscript  a    n  2    2      a_{n}a_{n-4}=a_{n-1}a_{n-3}+a_{n-2}^{2}   while for k = 5 the equation is         a  n    a   n  -  5     =     a   n  -  1     a   n  -  4     +    a   n  -  2      a   n  -  3        .         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  5          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a    n  4        subscript  a    n  2     subscript  a    n  3        a_{n}a_{n-5}=a_{n-1}a_{n-4}+a_{n-2}a_{n-3}\,.     These equations can be rearranged into the form of a recurrence relation , in which the value a n on the left hand side of the recurrence is defined by a formula on the right hand side, by dividing the formula by a n − k . For k = 4, this yields the recurrence       a  n   =      a   n  -  1     a   n  -  3     +   a   n  -  2   2     a   n  -  4          subscript  a  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a    n  3      superscript   subscript  a    n  2    2     subscript  a    n  4       a_{n}=\frac{a_{n-1}a_{n-3}+a_{n-2}^{2}}{a_{n-4}}   while for k = 5 it gives the recurrence        a  n   =      a   n  -  1     a   n  -  4     +    a   n  -  2     a   n  -  3       a   n  -  5      .       subscript  a  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a    n  4        subscript  a    n  2     subscript  a    n  3       subscript  a    n  5       a_{n}=\frac{a_{n-1}a_{n-4}+a_{n-2}a_{n-3}}{a_{n-5}}.

For k ≥ 8 the analogously defined sequences eventually contain fractional values.  For k      . ↩  . ↩
