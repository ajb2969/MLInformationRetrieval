Somos sequence

In mathematics, a Somos sequence is a sequence of numbers defined by a certain recurrence relation, described below. They were discovered by mathematician Michael Somos. It is not obvious from the form of their defining recurrence that every number in a Somos sequence is an integer, but nevertheless many Somos sequences have the property that all of their members are integers.
Recurrence equations
For an integer number k larger than 1, the Somos-k sequence 
 
 
 
  is defined by the equation


 
  when k is odd, or by the analogous equation


 
  when k is even, together with the initial values

ai = 1 for i < k.
 

For k = 2 or 3, these recursions are very simple (there is no addition on the right-hand side) and they define the all-ones sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...). In the first nontrivial case, k = 4, the defining equation is


 
  while for k = 5 the equation is



These equations can be rearranged into the form of a recurrence relation, in which the value an on the left hand side of the recurrence is defined by a formula on the right hand side, by dividing the formula by an − k. For k = 4, this yields the recurrence


 
  while for k = 5 it gives the recurrence



While in the usual definition of the Somos sequences, the values of ai for i .12 An elementary proof for integrality of the Somos-5 sequence by Michael J Crabb of Glasgow University may be found in Michael Wemyss's website 1.
For k ≥ 8 the analogously defined sequences eventually contain fractional values.
