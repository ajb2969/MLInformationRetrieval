   Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality      Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality   In probability theory , the ''' Vysochanskij– Petunin inequality ''' gives a lower bound for the probability that a random variable with finite variance lies within a certain number of standard deviations of the variable's mean , or equivalently an upper bound for the probability that it lies further away. The sole restriction on the distribution is that it be unimodal and have finite variance . (This implies that it is a continuous probability distribution except at the mode , which may have a non-zero probability.) The theorem applies even to heavily skewed distributions and puts bounds on how much of the data is, or is not, "in the middle."  Theorem  Let X be a random variable with unimodal distribution, mean μ and finite, non-zero variance σ 2 . Then, for any λ > √(8/3) = 1.63299…,      P   (  |  X  -  μ  |  ≥  λ  σ  )   ≤   4   9   λ  2     .     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  X   μ  normal-|   λ  σ  normal-)      4    9   superscript  λ  2     normal-.    P(\left|X-\mu\right|\geq\lambda\sigma)\leq\frac{4}{9\lambda^{2}}.     Furthermore, the equality is attained for a random variable having a probability 1 − 4/(3 λ 2 ) of being exactly equal to the mean, and which, when it is not equal to the mean, is distributed uniformly in an interval centred on the mean. When λ is less than √(8/3), there exist non-symmetric distributions for which the 4/(9 λ 2 ) bound is exceeded.  Properties  The theorem refines Chebyshev's inequality by including the factor of 4/9, made possible by the condition that the distribution be unimodal.  It is common, in the construction of control charts and other statistical heuristics, to set λ = 3, corresponding to an upper probability bound of 4/81= 0.04938…, and to construct 3-sigma limits to bound nearly all (i.e. 99.73%) of the values of a process output. Without unimodality Chebyshev's inequality would give a looser bound of 1/9 = 0.11111….
