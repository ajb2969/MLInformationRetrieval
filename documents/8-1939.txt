   High frequency content measure      High frequency content measure   In signal processing , the high frequency content measure is a simple measure, taken across a signal spectrum (usually a STFT spectrum), that can be used to characterize the amount of high-frequency content in the signal. The magnitudes of the spectral bins are added together, but multiplying each magnitude by the bin "position" (proportional to the frequency). Thus if X ( k ) is a discrete spectrum with N unique points, its high frequency content measure is:      HFC  =    ∑   i  =  0    N  -  1     i   |   X   (  i  )    |         HFC    superscript   subscript     i  0      N  1      i      X  i        \mathrm{HFC}=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}i|X(i)|     In contrast to perceptual measures, this is not based on any evidence about its relevance to human hearing . Despite that, it can be useful for some applications, such as onset detection .  The measure has close similarities to the spectral centroid measure, being essentially the same calculation but without normalization according to overall magnitude.  References   P. Brossier, J. P.
