   Argument of a function      Argument of a function   In mathematics , an argument of a function is a specific input in the function, also known as an independent variable . When it is clear from the context which argument is meant, the argument is often denoted by the abbreviation arg . 1  A mathematical function has one or more arguments in the form of independent variables designated in the function's definition, which can also contain parameters . The independent variables are mentioned in the list of arguments that the function takes, whereas the parameters are not. For example, in the logarithmic function      f   (  x  )    =    log  b    (  x  )          f  x     subscript   b   x     f(x)=\log_{b}(x)   , the base    b   b   b   is considered a parameter.  A function that takes a single argument as input (such as     f   (  x  )    =   x  2         f  x    superscript  x  2     f(x)=x^{2}   ) is called a unary function . A function of two or more variables is considered to have a domain consisting of ordered pairs or tuples of argument values. For example, the binary function      f   (  x  ,  y  )    =    x  2   +   y  2          f   x  y       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}   has two arguments,   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   , in an ordered pair    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   . The hypergeometric function is an example of a four-argument function. The number of arguments that a function takes is called the arity of the function.  The argument of a circular function is an angle . The argument of a hyperbolic function is a hyperbolic angle .
