Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering

Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of classical financial models. These classical models of financial time series typically assume homoskedasticity and normality cannot explain stylized phenomena such as skewness, heavy tails, and volatility clustering of the empirical asset returns in finance. In 1963, Benoit Mandelbrot first used the stable (or 
 
 
 
 -stable) distribution to model the empirical distributions which have the skewness and heavy-tail property. Since 
 
 
 
 -stable distributions have infinite 
 
 
 
 -th moments for all 
 
 
 
 , the tempered stable processes have been proposed for overcoming this limitation of the stable distribution.
On the other hand, GARCH models have been developed to explain the volatility clustering. In the GARCH model, the innovation (or residual) distributions are assumed to be a standard normal distribution, despite the fact that this assumption is often rejected empirically. For this reason, GARCH models with non-normal innovation distribution have been developed.
Many financial models with stable and tempered stable distributions together with volatility clustering have been developed and applied to risk management, option pricing, and portfolio selection.
Infinitely divisible distributions
A random variable 
 
 
 
  is called infinitely divisible if, for each 
 
 
 
 , there are independent and identically-distributed random variables



such that



where 
 
 
 
  denotes equality in distribution.
A Borel measure

 
  on 
 
 
 
  is called a Lévy measure if 
 
 
 
  and



If 
 
 
 
  is infinitely divisible, then the characteristic function

 
  is given by



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a Lévy measure. Here the triple 
 
 
 
  is called a Lévy triplet of

 
 . This triplet is unique. Conversely, for any choice 
 
 
 
  satisfying the conditions above, there exists an infinitely divisible random variable 
 
 
 
  whose characteristic function is given as 
 
 
 
 .
α-Stable distributions
An real-valued random variable 
 
 
 
  is said to have an 

 
 -stable distribution if for any 
 
 
 
 , there are a positive number 
 
 
 
  and a real number 
 
 
 
  such that



where 
 
 
 
  are independent and have the same distribution as that of 
 
 
 
 . All stable random variables are infinitely divisible. It is known that 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . A stable random variable 
 
 
 
  with index 
 
 
 
  is called an 

 
 -stable random variable.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
 -stable random variable. Then the characteristic function 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is given by



for some 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Tempered stable distributions
An infinitely divisible distribution is called a classical tempered stable (CTS) distribution with parameter 
 
 
 
 , if its Lévy triplet 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
This distribution was first introduced by under the name of Truncated Lévy Flights1 and has been called the tempered stable or the KoBoL distribution.2 In particular, if 
 
 
 
 , then this distribution is called the CGMY distribution which has been used for financial modeling.3
The characteristic function 
 
 
 
  for a tempered stable distribution is given by



for some 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, 
 
 
 
  can be extended to the region 
 
 
 
 .
Rosiński [6] generalized the CTS distribution under the name of the tempered stable distribution. The KR distribution, which is a subclass of the Rosiński's generalized tempered stable distributions, is used in finance.4
An infinitely divisible distribution is called a modified tempered stable (MTS) distribution with parameter 
 
 
 
 , if its Lévy triplet 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and


 
  Here 
 
 
 
  is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. The MTS distribution is not included in the class of Rosiński's generalized tempered stable distributions.5
Volatility clustering with stable and tempered stable innovation
In order to describe the volatility clustering effect of the return process of an asset, the GARCH model can be used. In the GARCH model, innovation (
 
 
 
 ) is assumed that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and where the series 
 
 
 
  are modeled by



and where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
However, the assumption of 
 
 
 
  is often rejected empirically. For that reason, new GARCH models with stable or tempered stable distributed innovation have been developed. GARCH models with 
 
 
 
 -stable innovations have been introduced.678 Subsequently, GARCH Models with tempered stable innovations have been developed.910
