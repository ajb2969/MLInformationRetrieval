   Ridit scoring      Ridit scoring   In econometrics , ridit scoring is a statistical method used to analyze ordered qualitative measurements. The tools of ridit analysis were developed and first applied by Bross, 1 who coined the term "ridit" by analogy with other statistical transformations such as probit and logit .  Calculation of ridit scores  Choosing a reference data set  Since ridit scoring is used to compare two or more sets of ordered qualitative data, one set is designated as a reference against which other sets can be compared. In econometric studies, for example, the ridit scores measuring taste survey answers of a competing or historically important product are often used as the reference data set against which taste surveys of new products are compared. Absent a convenient reference data set, an accumulation of pooled data from several sets or even an artificial or hypothetical set can be used.  Determining the probability function  After a reference data set has been chosen, the reference data set must be converted to a probability function. To do this, let x 1 , x 2 ,..., x n denote the ordered categories of the preference scale. For each j , x j represents a choice or judgment. Then, let the probability function p be defined with respect to the reference data set as        p  j   =   P  r  o  b   (   x  j   )     .       subscript  p  j     P  r  o  b   subscript  x  j      p_{j}=Prob({x_{j}}).     Determining ridits  The ridit scores, or simply ridits, of the reference data set are then easily calculated as  $$w_j=0.5p_j+\sum_{k Each of the categories of the reference data set are then associated with a ridit score.
 More formally, for each 1\le j\le n$$ , the value w j is the ridit score of the choice x j .  Interpretation and examples  Intuitively, ridit scoring can be understood as a modified notion of percentile. For any j, if x j has a low (close to 0) ridit score, one can conclude that  $$\sum_{k is very small, which is to say that very few respondents have chosen a category "lower" than ''x j ''.
 
 ==Applications==
 Ridit scoring has found use primarily in the [[health science]]s (including nursing and [[epidemiology]]) and econometric preference studies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
 
 ==A mathematical approach==
 Besides having intuitive appeal, the derivation for ridit scoring can be arrived at with mathematically rigorous methods as well. Brockett and Levine Brockett, Patrick L. and Levine, Arnold (1977) "On a Characterization of Ridits," ''The Annals of Statistics'', 5 (6):1245-1248 {{jstor|2958658}} presented a derivation of the above ridit score equations based on several intuitively uncontroversial mathematical postulates.
