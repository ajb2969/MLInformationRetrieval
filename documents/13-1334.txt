Higher-dimensional gamma matrices

In mathematical physics, higher-dimensional gamma matrices generalize to arbitrary dimension the four-dimensional Gamma matrices of Dirac, which are a mainstay of relativistic quantum mechanics. They are utilized in relativistically invariant wave equations for fermions (such as spinors) in arbitrary space-time dimensions, notably in string theory and supergravity.
Consider a space-time of dimension 
 
 
 
  with the flat Minkowski metric,


 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Set  2⌊d/2⌋}}. The standard Dirac matrices correspond to taking 
 
 
 
 .
The higher gamma matrices are a 
 
 
 
 -long sequence of complex 
 
 
 
  matrices 
 
 
 
  which satisfy the anticommutator relation from the Clifford algebra  (generating a representation for it),


 
  where  is the identity matrix in 
 
 
 
  dimensions. (The spinors acted on by these matrices have 
 
 
 
  components in 
 
 
 
  dimensions.) Such a sequence exists for all values of 
 
 
 
  and can be constructed explicitly, as provided below.
The gamma matrices have the following property under hermitian conjugation,



Charge conjugation
Since the groups generated by  are the same, we can look for a similarity transformation which connects them all. This transformation is generated by a respective charge conjugation matrix.
Explicitly, we can introduce the following matrices






They can be constructed as real matrices in various dimensions, as the following table shows. In even dimension both 
 
 
 
  exist, in odd dimension just one.

Symmetry properties
We denote a product of gamma matrices by



and note that the anti-commutation property allows us to simplify any such sequence to one in which the indices are distinct and increasing. Since distinct 
 
 
 
  anti-commute this motivates the introduction of an anti-symmetric "average". We introduce the anti-symmetrised products of distinct 
 
 
 
 -tuples from 0,...,
 
 
 
 −1:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  runs over all the permutations of 
 
 
 
  symbols, and 
 
 
 
  is the alternating character. There are 2d such products, but only 
 
 
2 are independent, spanning the space of 
 
 
 
 ×
 
 
 
  matrices.
Typically,  provide the (bi)spinor representation of the 
 
 
 
  generators of the higher-dimensional Lorentz group, , generalizing the 6 matrices σμν of the spin representation of the Lorentz group in four dimensions.
For even 
 
 
 
 , one may further define the hermitian chiral matrix


 
  such that = 0 and =1. (In odd dimensions, such a matrix would commute with all 
 
 
as and would thus be proportional to the identity, so it is not considered.)
A 
 
 
 
  matrix is called symmetric if


 
  otherwise, for a − sign, it is called antisymmetric. In the previous expression, 
 
 
 
  can be either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . In odd dimension, there is no ambiguity, but in even dimension it is better to choose whichever one of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  allows for Majorana spinors. In 
 
 
 
 =6, there is no such criterion and therefore we consider both.

Example of an explicit construction in the chiral basis
The 
 
 
 
  matrices can be constructed recursively, first in all even dimensions, 
 
 
 
 = 2
 
 
 
 , and thence in odd ones, 2
 
 
 
 +1.
=== d = 2 === Using the Pauli matrices, take


 
  and one may easily check that the charge conjugation matrices are






One may finally define the hermitian chiral 
 
 
chir to be



=== Generic even d = 2k === One may now construct the 0, ... , d+1)}}, matrices and the charge conjugations 
 
 
(±) in 
 
 
 
 +2 dimensions, starting from the  , (
 
 
 
 ), and 
 
 
(±) matrices in 
 
 
 
  dimensions.
Explicitly,



One may then construct the charge conjugation matrices,


 
  with the following properties,






Starting from the sign values for 
 
 
 
 =2, 
 
 
(2,+)=+1 and 
 
 
(2,−)=−1, one may fix all subsequent signs 
 
 
(d,±) which have periodicity 8; explicitly, one finds

Again, one may define the hermitian chiral matrix in 
 
 
 
 +2 dimensions as



which is diagonal by construction and transforms under charge conjugation as


 
  It is thus evident that  = 0.
=== Generic odd d = 2k + 1 === Consider the previous construction for 
 
 
 
 −1 (which is even) and simply take all 0, ..., d−2)}} matrices, to which append its . (The 
 
 
 
  is required in order to yield an antihermitian matrix, and extend into the spacelike metric).
Finally, compute the charge conjugation matrix: choose between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , in such a way that  transforms as all the other 
 
 
 
  matrices. Explicitly, require



As the dimension 
 
 
 
  ranges, patterns typically repeat themselves with period 8. (cf. the Clifford algebra clock.)
