   Survival function      Survival function   The survival function , also known as a survivor function or reliability function , is a property of any random variable that maps a set of events, usually associated with mortality or failure of some system, onto time . It captures the probability that the system will survive beyond a specified time.  The term reliability function is common in engineering while the term survival function is used in a broader range of applications, including human mortality. Another name for the survival function is the complementary cumulative distribution function .  Definition  Let T be a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function  F ( t ) on the interval [0,∞). Its survival function or reliability function is:      S   (  t  )   =  P   (   {  T  >  t  }   )   =   ∫  t  ∞   f   (  u  )   d  u  =  1  -  F   (  t  )   .     fragments  S   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  T   t  normal-}   normal-)     superscript   subscript   t     f   fragments  normal-(  u  normal-)   d  u   1   F   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-.    S(t)=P(\{T>t\})=\int_{t}^{\infty}f(u)\,du=1-F(t).     Properties  Every survival function S ( t ) is monotonically decreasing , i.e.     S   (  u  )    ≤   S   (  t  )          S  u     S  t     S(u)\leq S(t)   for all    u  >  t      u  t    u>t   .  The time , t = 0, represents some origin, typically the beginning of a study or the start of operation of some system. S (0) is commonly unity but can be less to represent the probability that the system fails immediately upon operation.  Since the CDF is a right-continuous function, it can be said that the survival function     S   (  t  )    =   1  -   F   (  t  )           S  t     1    F  t      S(t)=1-F(t)   is also right-continuous.
