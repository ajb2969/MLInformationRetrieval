   Nahm equations      Nahm equations   The Nahm equations are a system of ordinary differential equations introduced by Werner Nahm in the context of the Nahm transform – an alternative to Ward 's twistor construction of monopoles . The Nahm equations are formally analogous to the algebraic equations in the ADHM construction of instantons , where finite order matrices are replaced by differential operators.  Deep study of the Nahm equations was carried out by Nigel Hitchin and Simon Donaldson . Conceptually, the equations arise in the process of infinite-dimensional hyperkähler reduction . Among their many applications we can mention: Hitchin's construction of monopoles, where this approach is critical for establishing nonsingularity of monopole solutions; Donaldson's description of the moduli space of monopoles; and the existence of hyperkähler structure on coadjoint orbits of complex semisimple Lie groups , proved by Peter Kronheimer , Olivier Biquard, and A.G. Kovalev.  Equations  Let T 1 ( z ), T 2 ( z ), T 3 ( z ) be three matrix-valued meromorphic functions of a complex variable z . The Nahm equations are a system of matrix differential equations        d   T  1     d  z          d   subscript  T  1      d  z     \displaystyle\frac{dT_{1}}{dz}     together with certain analyticity properties, reality conditions, and boundary conditions. The three equations can be written concisely using the Levi-Civita symbol , in the form         d   T  i     d  z    =    1  2     ∑   j  ,  k      ϵ   i  j  k     [   T  j   ,   T  k   ]      =    ∑   j  ,  k      ϵ   i  j  k     T  j    T  k      .            d   subscript  T  i      d  z        1  2     subscript    j  k       subscript  ϵ    i  j  k      subscript  T  j    subscript  T  k              subscript    j  k       subscript  ϵ    i  j  k     subscript  T  j    subscript  T  k        \frac{dT_{i}}{dz}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j,k}\epsilon_{ijk}[T_{j},T_{k}]=\sum_{j,k}%
 \epsilon_{ijk}T_{j}T_{k}.     More generally, instead of considering N by N matrices, one can consider Nahm's equations with values in a Lie algebra g .  Additional conditions  The variable z is restricted to the open interval (0,2), and the following conditions are imposed:         T  i  *   =   -   T  i     ;       subscript   superscript  T    i      subscript  T  i      T^{*}_{i}=-T_{i};            T  i    (   2  -  z   )    =    T  i     (  z  )   T     ;         subscript  T  i     2  z       subscript  T  i    superscript  z  T      T_{i}(2-z)=T_{i}(z)^{T};\,     T i can be continued to a meromorphic function of z in a neighborhood of the closed interval [0,2], analytic outside of 0 and 2, and with simple poles at z = 0 and z = 2; and  At the poles, the residues of ( T 1 , T 2 , T 3 ) form an irreducible representation of the group SU(2) .   Nahm–Hitchin description of monopoles  There is a natural equivalence between   the monopoles of charge k for the group SU(2), modulo gauge transformations, and  the solutions of Nahm equations satisfying the additional conditions above, modulo the simultaneous conjugation of T 1 , T 2 , T 3 by the group O(k, R ).   Lax representation  The Nahm equations can be written in the Lax form as follows. Set        A  0   =    T  1   +   i   T  2      ,     A  1   =   -   2  i   T  3      ,    A  2   =    T  1   -   i   T  2          formulae-sequence     subscript  A  0      subscript  T  1     i   subscript  T  2       formulae-sequence     subscript  A  1       2  i   subscript  T  3         subscript  A  2      subscript  T  1     i   subscript  T  2         \displaystyle A_{0}=T_{1}+iT_{2},\quad A_{1}=-2iT_{3},\quad A_{2}=T_{1}-iT_{2}     then the system of Nahm equations is equivalent to the Lax equation         d  A    d  z    =   [  A  ,  B  ]    .          d  A     d  z     A  B     \frac{dA}{dz}=[A,B].     As an immediate corollary, we obtain that the spectrum of the matrix A does not depend on z . Therefore, the characteristic equation        det   (    λ  I   +   A   (  ζ  ,  z  )     )    =  0   ,            λ  I     A   ζ  z      0    \det(\lambda I+A(\zeta,z))=0,     which determines the so-called spectral curve in the twistor space  TP 1 , is invariant under the flow in z .
