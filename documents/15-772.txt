EdgeRank




EdgeRank

EdgeRank is the name commonly given to the algorithm that Facebook uses to determine what articles should be displayed in a user's News Feed. As of 2011, Facebook has stopped using the "EdgeRank" term internally to refer to its News Feed ranking algorithm, and in 2013, uses an algorithm that takes more than 100,000 factors into account in addition to EdgeRank's three.1 In 2010, the EdgeRank algorithm was described as:


 
  where:


 
  is user affinity


 
  is how the content is weighted


 
  is a time-based decay parameter.
Some of the methods that Facebook uses to adjust the parameters are proprietary and not available to the public.2
