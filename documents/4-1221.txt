   Eccentric anomaly      Eccentric anomaly   (Figure)  The eccentric anomaly of point P is the angle E . The center of the ellipse is point C , and the focus is point F .   In orbital mechanics , eccentric anomaly is an angular parameter that defines the position of a body that is moving along an elliptic  Kepler orbit .  For a point P orbiting in an ellipse , the eccentric anomaly is the angle E in the figure to the right. It is determined by drawing a line perpendicular to the major axis of the ellipse through the point P and locating its intercept P′ with the auxiliary circle , a circle of radius   a   a   a\,\!   (the semi-major axis of the ellipse) that enscribes the entire ellipse. This intersection P′ is called the corresponding point to P . The radius of the auxiliary circle passing through the corresponding point makes an angle E with the major axis. 1  The eccentric anomaly is one of three angular parameters ("anomalies") that define a position along an orbit, the other two being the true anomaly and the mean anomaly .  Coordinates  If the center of coordinates is taken as the center of the ellipse, the coordinates of a point P( x, y ) on the ellipse satisfy the equation          x  2    a  2    +    y  2    b  2     =   1    ,           superscript  x  2    superscript  a  2       superscript  y  2    superscript  b  2     1    \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\ ,     where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes determining the length (2 a ) and width (2 b ) of the ellipse.  The eccentric anomaly E in terms of these coordinates is given by:         cos  E   =    x  a   and      sin  E   =    y  b      .     formulae-sequence      E      x  a   and        E     y  b      \cos E=\frac{x}{a}\quad\mathrm{and}\quad\sin E=\frac{y}{b}\ .     The above equations can be established by drawing the auxiliary circle of radius a enclosing the elliptical path and the minor auxiliary circle of radius b inscribed within the path. 2 The first equation is established by the definition of E . By extending a vertical line through point P to the auxiliary circle, a right triangle is formed with base that is the x -coordinate of P , and hypotenuse a , establishing the first equation. The second equation is established using the minor auxiliary circle. A horizontal line through P intersects this minor auxiliary circle of radius b , establishing another right triangle with altitude y and hypotenuse b . Labeling the adjacent angle E′ :        sin   E  ′    =    y  b     .         superscript  E  normal-′      y  b     \sin E^{\prime}=\frac{y}{b}\ .     It is next established that E′ = E . From the equation for the ellipse and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity :        y  b   =    1  -    (   x  a   )   2     =    1  -    cos  2   E     =   sin   E     ,          y  b       1   superscript    x  a   2              1    superscript   2   E            E      \frac{y}{b}=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{2}}=\sqrt{1-\cos^{2}E}=\sin E\ ,   establishing E′ = E .  Formulas  Radius and eccentric anomaly  The eccentricity  e is defined as:       e  =     1  -    (   b  a   )   2       .      e      1   superscript    b  a   2       e=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^{2}}\ .     From Pythagoras' theorem applied to the triangle with r as hypotenuse:      r  2     superscript  r  2    \displaystyle r^{2}   Thus, the radius (distance from the focus to point P ) is related to the eccentric anomaly by the formula       r  =   a   (   1  -   e  ⋅   cos  E     )     .      r    a    1   normal-⋅  e    E        r=a\left(1-e\cdot\cos{E}\right)\ .   With this result the eccentric anomaly can be determined from the true anomaly as shown next.  From the true anomaly  The true anomaly is the angle labeled f in the figure, located at the focus of the ellipse; it is often referred to as θ as in the calculations below. The true anomaly and the eccentric anomaly are related as follows. 3  Using the formula for r above, the sine and cosine of E are found in terms of θ:       cos  E   =   x  a   =     a  e   +   r   cos  θ     a   =   e  +    (   1  -   e   cos  E     )    cos   θ      →   cos  E   =    e  +   cos  θ     1  +   e   cos  θ              E     x  a              a  e     r    θ     a          e      1    e    E       θ       normal-→      E            e    θ      1    e    θ         \cos E=\frac{x}{a}=\frac{ae+r\cos\theta}{a}=e+(1-e\cos E)\cos\theta\ \to\cos E%
 =\frac{e+\cos\theta}{1+e\cos\theta}           sin  E   =    1  -    cos  2   E     =        1  -   e  2       sin  θ     1  +   e   cos  θ        .          E       1    superscript   2   E                  1   superscript  e  2       θ      1    e    θ         \sin E=\sqrt{1-\cos^{2}E}=\frac{\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\,\sin\theta}{1+e\cos\theta}\ .     Hence,        tan  E   =    sin  E    cos  E    =       1  -   e  2      sin  θ     e  +   cos  θ       .          E       E     E                 1   superscript  e  2       θ      e    θ        \tan E=\frac{\sin E}{\cos E}=\frac{\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\sin\theta}{e+\cos\theta}\ .     Angle E is therefore the adjacent angle of a right triangle with hypotenuse 1 + e cosθ, adjacent side e + cosθ, and opposite side √(1-e 2 ) sinθ.  Also,       tan   θ  2    =      1  +  e    1  -  e     ⋅   tan   E  2             θ  2     normal-⋅        1  e     1  e         E  2       \tan\frac{\theta}{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\cdot\tan\frac{E}{2}     Substituting cos E as found above into the expression for r , the radial distance from the focal point to the point P , can be found in terms of the true anomaly as well: 4       r  =     a   (   1  -   e  2    )     1  +   e   cos  θ        .      r      a    1   superscript  e  2       1    e    θ        r=\frac{a\left(1-e^{2}\right)}{1+e\cos\theta}\ .     From the mean anomaly  The eccentric anomaly   E   E   E   is related to the mean anomaly    M   M   M   by Kepler's equation : 5      M  =   E  -   e  ⋅   sin  E         M    E   normal-⋅  e    E       M=E-e\cdot\sin E     This equation does not have a closed-form solution for   E   E   E   given   M   M   M   . It is usually solved by numerical methods, e.g. Newton-Raphson method .  In-line references and notes    Background references   Murray, Carl D.; & Dermott, Stanley F.
