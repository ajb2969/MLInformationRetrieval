   Braided vector space      Braided vector space   In mathematics, a braided vectorspace    V    V   \;V   is a vector space together with an additional structure map    τ    τ   \tau\;   symbolizing interchanging of two vector tensor copies :        τ  :    V  ⊗  V   ⟶   V  ⊗   V        normal-:  τ   normal-⟶   tensor-product  V  V    tensor-product  V  V      \tau:\;V\otimes V\longrightarrow V\otimes V\,        such that the Yang–Baxter equation is fulfilled. Hence drawing tensor diagrams with    τ    τ   \tau\;   an overcrossing the corresponding composed morphism is unchanged when a Reidemeister move is applied to the tensor diagram and thus they present a representation of the braid group .  As first example, every vector space is braided via the trivial braiding (simply flipping). A superspace has a braiding with negative sign in braiding two odd vectors. More generally, a diagonal braiding means that for a    V    V   \;V   -base     x  i      subscript  x  i    x_{i}\;   we have         τ   (    x  i   ⊗   x  j    )    =    q   i  j     (    x  j   ⊗   x  i    )          τ   tensor-product   subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j        subscript  q    i  j     tensor-product   subscript  x  j    subscript  x  i       \tau(x_{i}\otimes x_{j})=q_{ij}(x_{j}\otimes x_{i})\,        A good source for braided vector spaces entire braided monoidal categories with braidings between any objects     τ   V  ,  W       subscript  τ   V  W     \tau_{V,W}\;   , most importantly the modules over quasitriangular Hopf algebras and Yetter–Drinfeld modules over finite groups (such as    ℤ  2     subscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}   above)  If    V    V   V\;   additionally possesses an algebra structure inside the braided category ("braided algebra") one has a braided commutator (e.g. for a superspace the anticommutator ):           [  x  ,  y  ]   τ   :=   μ   (    (   x  ⊗  y   )   -   τ   (   x  ⊗  y   )     )       μ   (   x  ⊗  y   )    :=   x  y       formulae-sequence   assign   subscript   x  y   τ     μ     tensor-product  x  y     τ   tensor-product  x  y        assign    μ   tensor-product  x  y      x  y      \;[x,y]_{\tau}:=\mu((x\otimes y)-\tau(x\otimes y))\qquad\mu(x\otimes y):=xy        Examples of such braided algebras (and even Hopf algebras ) are the Nichols algebras , that are by definition generated by a given braided vectorspace. They appear as quantum Borel part of quantum groups and often (e.g. when finite or over an abelian group) possess an arithmetic root system , multiple Dynkin diagrams and a PBW-basis made up of braided commutators just like the ones in semisimple Lie algebras .  1    "  Category:Hopf algebras  Category:Quantum groups     Andruskiewitsch, Schneider: Pointed Hopf algebras , New directions in Hopf algebras, 1–68, Math.
