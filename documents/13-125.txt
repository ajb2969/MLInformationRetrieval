   Adjoint equation      Adjoint equation   An adjoint equation is a linear differential equation , usually derived from its primal equation using integration by parts . Gradient values with respect to a particular quantity of interest can be efficiently calculated by solving the adjoint equation. Methods based on solution of adjoint equations are used in wing shape optimization , fluid flow control and uncertainty quantification . For example     d   X  t    =    a   (   X  t   )   d  t   +   b   (   X  t   )   d  W          d   subscript  X  t        a   subscript  X  t   d  t     b   subscript  X  t   d  W      dX_{t}=a(X_{t})dt+b(X_{t})dW   this is an Itō stochastic differential equation. Now by using Euler scheme, we integrate the parts of this equation and get another equation,     X   n  +  1    =    X  n   +   a  Δ  t   +   ζ  b    Δ  t           subscript  X    n  1       subscript  X  n     a  normal-Δ  t     ζ  b      normal-Δ  t        X_{n+1}=X_{n}+a\Delta t+\zeta b\sqrt{\Delta t}   , here   ζ   ζ   \zeta   is a random variable, later one is an adjoint equation.
