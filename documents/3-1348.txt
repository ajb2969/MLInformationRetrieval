   Acoustic impedance      Acoustic impedance   Acoustic impedance and specific acoustic impedance are measures of the opposition that a system presents to the acoustic flow resulting of an acoustic pressure applied to the system. The SI unit of acoustic impedance is the pascal second per cubic metre ( ) or the rayl per square metre ( ), while that of specific acoustic impedance is the pascal second per metre () or the rayl. 1 In this article the symbol rayl denotes the MKS rayl. There is a close analogy with electrical impedance , which measures the opposition that a system presents to the electrical flow resulting of an electrical voltage applied to the system.  Mathematical definitions  Acoustic impedance  For a linear time-invariant system, the relationship between the acoustic pressure applied to the system and the resulting acoustic volume flow rate through a surface perpendicular to the direction of that pressure at its point of application is given by        p   (  t  )    =    [   R  *  Q   ]    (  t  )     ,        p  t      delimited-[]    R  Q    t     p(t)=[R*Q](t),   or equivalently by        Q   (  t  )    =    [   G  *  p   ]    (  t  )     ,        Q  t      delimited-[]    G  p    t     Q(t)=[G*p](t),   where   p is the acoustic pressure;  Q is the acoustic volume flow rate;     *     *   is the convolution operator;  R is the acoustic resistance in the time domain ;  G = R −1 is the acoustic conductance in the time domain ( R −1 is the convolution inverse of R ).

Acoustic resistance represents the energy transfer of an acoustic wave. The pressure and motion are in phase, so work is done on the medium ahead of the wave.  Acoustic reactance represents, as well, the pressure that is out of phase with the motion and causes no average energy transfer. For example, a closed bulb connected to an organ pipe will have air moving into it and pressure, but they are out of phase so no net energy is transmitted into it. While the pressure rises, air moves in, and while it falls, it moves out, but the average pressure when the air moves in is the same as that when it moves out, so the power flows back and forth but with no time averaged energy transfer. The electrical analogy for this is a capacitor connected across a power line. Current flows through the capacitor but it is out of phase with the voltage, so no net power is transmitted into it.  Specific acoustic impedance  For a linear time-invariant system, the relationship between the acoustic pressure applied to the system and the resulting particle velocity in the direction of that pressure at its point of application is given by        p   (  t  )    =    [   r  *  v   ]    (  t  )     ,        p  t      delimited-[]    r  v    t     p(t)=[r*v](t),   or equivalently by:        v   (  t  )    =    [   g  *  p   ]    (  t  )     ,        v  t      delimited-[]    g  p    t     v(t)=[g*p](t),   where   p is the acoustic pressure;  v is the particle velocity;  r is the specific acoustic resistance in the time domain ;  g = r −1 is the specific acoustic conductance in the time domain ( r −1 is the convolution inverse of r ).

Characteristic acoustic impedance  Characteristic specific acoustic impedance  The constitutive law of nondispersive linear acoustics in one dimension gives a relation between stress and strain: 6       p  =   -   ρ   c  2     ∂  ξ    ∂  x       ,      p      ρ   superscript  c  2       ξ     x        p=-\rho c^{2}\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial x},   where   x is the space variable along the direction of propagation of the sound waves;  p is the acoustic pressure in the medium;  ρ the volumetric mass density of the medium;  c the speed of the sound waves traveling in the medium;  ξ the particle displacement .   This equation is valid both for fluids and solids. In   fluids , ρc 2 = K ( K stands for the bulk modulus );  solids , ρc 2 = K + 4/3 G ( G stands for the shear modulus ) for longitudinal waves and ρc 2 = G for transverse waves .   Newton's second law applied locally in the medium gives        ρ     ∂  2   ξ    ∂   t  2      =   -    ∂  p    ∂  x      .        ρ      superscript   2   ξ      superscript  t  2            p     x       \rho\frac{\partial^{2}\xi}{\partial t^{2}}=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}.   Combining this equation with the previous one yields the one-dimensional wave equation :          ∂  2   ξ    ∂   t  2     =    c  2     ∂   ξ  2     ∂   x  2       .          superscript   2   ξ      superscript  t  2        superscript  c  2        superscript  ξ  2       superscript  x  2        \frac{\partial^{2}\xi}{\partial t^{2}}=c^{2}\frac{\partial\xi^{2}}{\partial x^%

The absolute value of this specific acoustic impedance is often called characteristic specific acoustic impedance and denoted z 0 : 7        z  0   =   ρ  c    .       subscript  z  0     ρ  c     z_{0}=\rho c.   The equations also show that         p   (  𝐫  ,  t  )     v   (  𝐫  ,  t  )     =   ±   ρ  c    =   ±   z  0     .            p   𝐫  t      v   𝐫  t      plus-or-minus    ρ  c          plus-or-minus   subscript  z  0       \frac{p(\mathbf{r},\,t)}{v(\mathbf{r},\,t)}=\pm\rho c=\pm z_{0}.     z 0 varies greatly among media, especially between gas and condensed phases. Water is 800 times denser than air and its speed of sound is 4.3 times greater than that of air. So the specific acoustic impedance of water is 3,500 times higher than that of air. This means that a sound in water with a given pressure amplitude is 3,500 times less intense than one in air with the same pressure. This is because the air, with its lower z 0 , moves with a much greater velocity and displacement amplitude than does water. Reciprocally, if a sound in water and another in air have the same intensity, then the pressure is much smaller in air. These variations lead to important differences between room acoustics or atmospheric acoustics on the one hand, and underwater acoustics on the other.  Besides, temperature acts on speed of sound and mass density and thus on specific acoustic impedance.  Characteristic acoustic impedance  For a one dimensional wave passing through an aperture with area A , Z = z / A , so if the wave is a progressive plane wave, then        Z   (  𝐫  ,  s  )    =   ±    ρ  c   A     ,        Z   𝐫  s     plus-or-minus      ρ  c   A      Z(\mathbf{r},\,s)=\pm\frac{\rho c}{A},           Z   (  𝐫  ,  ω  )    =   ±    ρ  c   A     ,        Z   𝐫  ω     plus-or-minus      ρ  c   A      Z(\mathbf{r},\,\omega)=\pm\frac{\rho c}{A},           Z   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =   ±    ρ  c   A     .        Z   𝐫  t     plus-or-minus      ρ  c   A      Z(\mathbf{r},\,t)=\pm\frac{\rho c}{A}.   The absolute value of this acoustic impedance is often called characteristic acoustic impedance and denoted Z 0 : 8        Z  0   =    ρ  c   A    .       subscript  Z  0       ρ  c   A     Z_{0}=\frac{\rho c}{A}.   Similarly to the characteristic specific acoustic impedance,         p   (  𝐫  ,  t  )     Q   (  𝐫  ,  t  )     =   ±    ρ  c   A    =   ±   Z  0     .            p   𝐫  t      Q   𝐫  t      plus-or-minus      ρ  c   A          plus-or-minus   subscript  Z  0       \frac{p(\mathbf{r},\,t)}{Q(\mathbf{r},\,t)}=\pm\frac{\rho c}{A}=\pm Z_{0}.     If the aperture with area A is the start of a pipe and a plane wave is sent into the pipe, the wave passing through the aperture is a progressive plane wave in the absence of reflections. There are usually reflections from the other end of the pipe, whether open or closed, so there is a sum of waves travelling from one end to the other. The reflections and resultant standing waves are very important in musical wind instruments. It is possible to have no reflections when the pipe is very long, because it then takes a long time for the reflected waves to return and, when it does, they are much attenuated by losses at the wall.
