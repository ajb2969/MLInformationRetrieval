Deformed power

Deformed power is a concept in electrical engineering which characterize the distortion to the sinusoidal states in electric network. It has been introduced by Constantin Budeanu.
It is defined by the following formula:
$$S = \sqrt {P^2 + Q^2 + D^2}$$
where S, P, Q, D are the apparent, active, reactive and deformed powers.
In linear electrical components like electrical resistance occurs no deformed (distortion) power. It is caused by nonlinear loads represented for instance by semiconducting devices (rectifiers, thyristors) especially when used for rectification of alternating current to direct one. The rectification is needed especially for providing current for electric traction and electrochemical industry.
