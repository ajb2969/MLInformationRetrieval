   Complex conjugate representation      Complex conjugate representation   In mathematics , if   G   G   G   is a group and   Π   normal-Π   Π   is a representation of it over the complex  vector space    V   V   V   , then the complex conjugate representation     Π  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Π    \overline{Π}   is defined over the complex conjugate vector space     V  ¯     normal-¯  V    \overline{V}   as follows:        Π  ¯    (  g  )        normal-¯  normal-Π   g    \overline{Π}(g)   is the conjugate of    Π   (  g  )       normal-Π  g    Π(g)   for all   g   g   g   in   G   G   G   .       Π  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Π    \overline{Π}   is also a representation, as you may check explicitly.  If   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is a real  Lie algebra and   π   π   π   is a representation of it over the vector space   V   V   V   , then the conjugate representation    π  ¯     normal-¯  π    \overline{π}   is defined over the conjugate vector space    V  ¯     normal-¯  V    \overline{V}   as follows:        π  ¯    (  X  )        normal-¯  π   X    \overline{π}(X)   is the conjugate of    π   (  X  )       π  X    π(X)   for all   X   X   X   in   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . 1        π  ¯     normal-¯  π    \overline{π}   is also a representation, as you may check explicitly.  If two real Lie algebras have the same complexification , and we have a complex representation of the complexified Lie algebra, their conjugate representations are still going to be different. See spinor for some examples associated with spinor representations of the spin groups     S  p  i  n   (   p  +  q   )       S  p  i  n    p  q     Spin(p+q)   and    S  p  i  n   (  p  ,  q  )       S  p  i  n   p  q     Spin(p,q)   .  If   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a *-Lie algebra (a complex Lie algebra with a * operation which is compatible with the Lie bracket),        π  ¯    (  X  )        normal-¯  π   X    \overline{π}(X)   is the conjugate of    −  π   (   X  ¯   )       normal-−  π   normal-¯  X     −π(\overline{X})   for all   X   X   X   in   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}      For a unitary representation , the dual representation and the conjugate representation coincide.

Physicists use a different convention where the Lie bracket of two real vectors is an imaginary vector. In the physicist's convention, insert a minus in the definition. ↩
