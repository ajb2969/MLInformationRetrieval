Complex conjugate representation

In mathematics, if 
 
 
 
  is a group and 
 
 
 
  is a representation of it over the complex vector space

 
 , then the complex conjugate representation

 
  is defined over the complex conjugate vector space

 
  as follows:



 
  is the conjugate of 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
 



 
  is also a representation, as you may check explicitly.
If 
 
 
 
  is a real Lie algebra and 
 
 
 
  is a representation of it over the vector space 
 
 
 
 , then the conjugate representation 
 
 
 
  is defined over the conjugate vector space 
 
 
 
  as follows:



 
  is the conjugate of 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .1




 
  is also a representation, as you may check explicitly.
If two real Lie algebras have the same complexification, and we have a complex representation of the complexified Lie algebra, their conjugate representations are still going to be different. See spinor for some examples associated with spinor representations of the spin groups

 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a *-Lie algebra (a complex Lie algebra with a * operation which is compatible with the Lie bracket),



 
  is the conjugate of 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 


For a unitary representation, the dual representation and the conjugate representation coincide.

This is the mathematicians' convention. Physicists use a different convention where the Lie bracket of two real vectors is an imaginary vector. In the physicist's convention, insert a minus in the definition.
