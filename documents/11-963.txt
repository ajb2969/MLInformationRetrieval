   Phosphate butyryltransferase      Phosphate butyryltransferase   In enzymology , a phosphate butyryltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   butanoyl-CoA + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + butanoyl phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are butanoyl-CoA and phosphate , whereas its two products are CoA and butanoyl phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanoyl-CoA:phosphate butanoyltransferase . This enzyme is also called phosphotransbutyrylase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .
