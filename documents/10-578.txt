   Malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+)      Malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+)    Malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP + ) () or NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction in the presence of a bivalent metal ion: 1   (S)-malate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + CO 2 + NADPH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are pyruvate , CO 2 , and NADPH . Malate is oxidized to pyruvate and CO 2 , and NADP + is reduced to NADPH.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:NADP + oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation . NADP-malic enzyme is one of three decarboxylation enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NAD-malic enzyme and PEP carboxykinase . 2 3 Although often one of the three photosynthetic decarboxylases predominate, the simultaneous operation of all three is also shown to exist. 4 5  (Figure)  ChemDraw generated NADP-ME chemical reaction detailing the chemical structures involved.   Enzyme Structure  Based on crystallography data of homologous NADP-dependent malic enzymes of mammalian origin, a 3D model for C 4 pathway NADP-ME in plants has been developed, identifying the key residues involved in substrate-binding or catalysis. Dinucleotide binding involves two glycine rich GXGXXG motifs, a hydrophobic groove involving at least six amino acid residues, and a negatively charged residue at the end of the βB-strand. 6 7 The primary sequence of the first motif, 240 GLGDLG 245 , is a consensus marker for phosphate binding, evidencing involvement with NADP binding, while the other glycine rich motif adopts a classical Rossman fold —also a typical marker for NADP  cofactor binding. 8  Mutagenesis experiments in maize NADP-ME have supported the current model. 9  Valine substitution for glycine in either motif region rendered the enzyme completely inactive while spectral analysis indicated no major changes from wild-type form. The data is suggestive of direct impairment at a key residue involved in binding or catalysis rather than an inter-domain residue influencing conformational stability. Additionally, a key arginine residue at site 237 has been shown to interact both with malate and NADP + substrates, forming key favorable electrostatic interactions to the negatively charged carboxylic-acid and phosphate group respectively. Elucidation of whether the residue plays a role in substrate binding or substrate positioning for catalysis has yet to be determined. 10  Lysine residue 255 has been implicated as a catalytic base for the enzymes reactivity; however, further studies are still required to conclusively establish its biochemical role. 11  Structural studies  , 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .  Biological Function  In a broader context, malic enzymes are found within a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, from fungi to mammals, and beyond that, are shown to localize in range of subcellular locations, including the cytosol , mitochondria , and chloroplast . C 4 NADP-ME, specifically, is in plants localized in bundle sheath chloroplasts. 12  During C 4  photosynthesis , an evolved pathway to increase localized CO 2 concentrations under the threat of enhanced photorespiration , CO 2 is captured within mesophyll cells, fixed as oxaloacetate , converted into malate and released internally within bundle sheath cells to directly feed RuBisCO activity. 13 This release of fixed CO 2 , triggered by the favorable decarboxylation of malate into pyruvate , is mediated by NADP-dependent malic enzyme. In fact, the significance of NADP-ME activity in CO 2 conservation is evidenced by a study performed with transgenic plants exhibiting a NADP-ME loss of function mutation. Plants with the mutation experienced 40% the activity of wild-type NADP-ME and achieved significantly reduced CO 2 uptake even at high intercellular levels of CO 2 , evidencing the biological importance of NADP-ME at regulating carbon flux towards the Calvin cycle . 14 15  Enzyme Regulation  NADP-ME expression has been shown to be regulated by abiotic stress factors. For CAM plants , drought conditions cause stoma to largely remain shut to avoid water loss by evapotranspiration , which unfortunately leads to CO 2 starvation. In compensation, closed stoma activates the translation of NADP-ME to reinforce high efficiency of CO 2 assimilation during the brief intervals of CO 2 intake, allowing for carbon fixation to continue. 16 In addition to regulation at the longer time scale by means of expression control, regulation at the short-time scale can occur through allosteric mechanisms. C 4 NADP-ME has been shown to be partially inhibited by its substrate , malate, suggesting two independent binding sites: one at the active site and one at an allosteric site. However, the inhibitory effect exhibits pH -dependence – existent at a pH of 7 but not a pH of 8. The control of enzyme activity due to pH changes align with the hypothesis that NADP-ME is most active while photosynthesis is in progress: Active light reactions leads to a rise in basicity within the chloroplast  stroma , the location of NADP-ME, leading to a diminished inhibitory effect of malate on NADP-ME and thereby promoting a more active state. Conversely, slowed light reactions leads to a rise in acidity within the stroma, promoting the inhibition of NADP-ME by malate. Because the high energy products of the light reactions , NADPH and ATP , are required for the Calvin Cycle to proceed, a buildup of CO 2 without them is not useful, explaining the need for the regulatory mechanism. 17  This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation . 18  Evolution  NADP-malic enzyme, as all other C 4 decarboxylases, did not evolve de novo for CO 2 pooling to aid RuBisCO . 19 Rather, NADP-ME was directly transformed from a C 3 species in photosynthesis , and even earlier origins from an ancient cystolic ancestor . In the cytosol , the enzyme existed as a series of housekeeping isoforms purposed towards a variety of functions including malate level maintenance during hypoxia , microspore separation, and pathogen defense. In regards to the mechanism of evolution, the C 4 functionality is thought to have stemmed from gene duplication error both within promoter regions, triggering overexpression in bundle-sheath cells, and within the coding region, generating neofunctionalization . 20 Selection for CO 2 preservation function as well as enhanced water and nitrogen utilization under stressed conditions was then shaped by natural pressures. 21  See also   ME1 (gene) (human gene)   References  Further reading          "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure      ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
