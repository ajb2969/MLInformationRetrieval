Tensor-hom adjunction

In mathematics, the tensor-hom adjunction is that the tensor product and Hom functors

 
  and 
 
 
 
  form an adjoint pair:


 
  This is made more precise below. The order "tensor-hom adjunction" is because tensor is the left adjoint, while hom is the right adjoint.
General Statement
Say R and S are (possibly noncommutative) rings, and consider the right module categories (an analogous statement holds for left modules):



Fix an (R,S) bimodule X and define functors F: C → D and G: D → C as follows:






Then F is left adjoint to G. This means there is a natural isomorphism



This is actually an isomorphism of abelian groups. More precisely, if Y is an (A, R) bimodule and Z is a (B, S) bimodule, then this is an isomorphism of (B, A) bimodules. This is one of the motivating examples of the structure in a closed bicategory.1
Counit and Unit
Like all adjunctions, the tensor-hom adjunction can be described by its counit and unit natural transformations. Using the notation from the previous section, the counit



has components



given by evaluation: For






The components of the unit






are defined as follows: For y in Y,



is a right S-module homomorphism given by



The counit and unit equations can now be explicitly verified. For Y in C,



is given on simple tensors of Y⊗X by



Likewise,



For φ in HomS(X, Z),



is a right S-module homomorphism defined by



and therefore
