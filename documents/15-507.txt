Near-horizon metric
The '''near-horizon metric''' (NHM) refers to the near-horizon limit of the global metric of a [[black hole]]. NHMs pla
 y an important role in studying the geometry and topology of black holes, but are only well defined for extremal black holes.123 NHMs are expressed in Gaussian null coordinates, and one important property is that the dependence on the coordinate 
 
 
 
  is fixed in the near-horizon limit.
NHM of extremal Reissner–Nordström black holes
The metric of extremal Reissner–Nordström black hole is



Taking the near-horizon limit



and then omitting the tildes, one obtains the near-horizon metric



NHM of extremal Kerr black holes
The metric of extremal Kerr black hole (
 
 
 
 ) in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates can be written in the following two enlightening forms,45






where



Taking the near-horizon limit67



and omitting the tildes, one obtains the near-horizon metric (this is also called extremal Kerr throat8 )



NHM of extremal Kerr–Newman black holes
Extremal Kerr–Newman black holes (
 
 
 
 ) are described by the metric910



where



Taking the near-horizon transformation



and omitting the tildes, one obtains the NHM11



NHMs of generic black holes
In addition to the NHMs of extremal Kerr–Newman family metrics discussed above, all stationary NHMs could be written in the form12131415




where the metric functions 
 
 
 
  are independent of the coordinate r, 
 
 
 
  denotes the intrinsic metric of the horizon, and 
 
 
 
  are isothermal coordinates on the horizon.
Remark: In Gaussian null coordinates, the black hole horizon corresponds to 
 
 
 
 .
