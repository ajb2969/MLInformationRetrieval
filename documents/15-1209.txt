Cauchy process

In probability theory, a Cauchy process is a type of stochastic process. There are symmetric and asymmetric forms of the Cauchy process.1 The unspecified term "Cauchy process" is often used to refer to the symmetric Cauchy process.2
The Cauchy process has a number of properties:

It is a Lévy process345
It is a stable process67
It is a pure jump process8
Its moments are infinite.

Symmetric Cauchy process
The symmetric Cauchy process can be described by a Brownian motion or Wiener process subject to a Lévy subordinator.9 The Lévy subordinator is a process associated with a Lévy distribution having location parameter of 
 
 
 
  and a scale parameter of 
 
 
 
 
 .10 The Lévy distribution is a special case of the inverse-gamma distribution. So, using 
 
 
 
  to represent the Cauchy process and 
 
 
 
  to represent the Lévy subordinator, the symmetric Cauchy process can be described as:



The Lévy distribution is the probability of the first hitting time for a Brownian motion, and thus the Cauchy process is essentially the result of two independent Brownian motion processes.11
The Lévy–Khintchine representation for the symmetric Cauchy process is a triplet with zero drift and zero diffusion, giving a Lévy–Khintchine triplet of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
 .12
The marginal characteristic function of the symmetric Cauchy process has the form:1314



The marginal probability distribution of the symmetric Cauchy process is the Cauchy distribution whose density is1516



Asymmetric Cauchy process
The asymmetric Cauchy process is defined in terms of a parameter 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  is the skewness parameter, and its absolute value must be less than or equal to 1.17 In the case where 
 
 
 
 
  the process is considered a completely asymmetric Cauchy process.18
The Lévy–Khintchine triplet has the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .19
Given this, 
 
 
 
  is a function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The characteristic function of the asymmetric Cauchy distribution has the form:20



The marginal probability distribution of the asymmetric Cauchy process is a stable distribution with index of stability equal to 1.
