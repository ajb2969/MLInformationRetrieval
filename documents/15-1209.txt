   Cauchy process      Cauchy process   In probability theory, a Cauchy process is a type of stochastic process . There are symmetric and asymmetric forms of the Cauchy process. 1 The unspecified term "Cauchy process" is often used to refer to the symmetric Cauchy process. 2  The Cauchy process has a number of properties:   It is a Lévy process 3 4 5  It is a stable process 6 7  It is a pure jump process 8  Its moments are infinite .   Symmetric Cauchy process  The symmetric Cauchy process can be described by a Brownian motion or Wiener process subject to a Lévy  subordinator . 9 The Lévy subordinator is a process associated with a Lévy distribution having location parameter of   0   0    and a scale parameter of     t  2   /  2       superscript  t  2   2    t^{2}/2   . 10 The Lévy distribution is a special case of the inverse-gamma distribution . So, using   C   C   C   to represent the Cauchy process and   L   L   L   to represent the Lévy subordinator, the symmetric Cauchy process can be described as:        C   (  t  ;  0  ,  1  )    :=   W   (   L   (  t  ;  0  ,    t  2   /  2   )    )     .     assign    C   t  0  1      W    L   t  0     superscript  t  2   2        C(t;0,1)\;:=\;W(L(t;0,t^{2}/2)).     The Lévy distribution is the probability of the first hitting time for a Brownian motion, and thus the Cauchy process is essentially the result of two independent Brownian motion processes. 11  The Lévy–Khintchine representation for the symmetric Cauchy process is a triplet with zero drift and zero diffusion, giving a Lévy–Khintchine triplet of    (  0  ,  0  ,  W  )     0  0  W    (0,0,W)   , where     W   (   d  x   )    =    d  x   /   (   π   x  2    )          W    d  x        d  x     π   superscript  x  2       W(dx)=dx/(\pi x^{2})   . 12  The marginal characteristic function of the symmetric Cauchy process has the form: 13 14        E   [   e   i  θ   X  t     ]    =   e   -   t   |  θ  |       .       normal-E   superscript  e    i  θ   subscript  X  t       superscript  e      t    θ        \operatorname{E}\Big[e^{i\theta X_{t}}\Big]=e^{-t|\theta|}.     The marginal probability distribution of the symmetric Cauchy process is the Cauchy distribution whose density is 15 16        f   (  x  ;  t  )    =    1  π    [   t    x  2   +   t  2     ]     .        f   x  t        1  π    delimited-[]    t     superscript  x  2    superscript  t  2         f(x;t)={1\over\pi}\left[{t\over x^{2}+t^{2}}\right].     Asymmetric Cauchy process  The asymmetric Cauchy process is defined in terms of a parameter   β   β   \beta   . Here   β   β   \beta   is the skewness parameter, and its absolute value must be less than or equal to 1. 17 In the case where     |  β  |   =  1        β   1    |\beta|=1   the process is considered a completely asymmetric Cauchy process. 18  The Lévy–Khintchine triplet has the form    (  0  ,  0  ,  W  )     0  0  W    (0,0,W)   , where     W   (   d  x   )    =   {      A    x   -  2     d  x       if  x   >  0        B    x   -  2     d  x       if  x   <  0             W    d  x     cases    A   superscript  x    2    d  x       if  x   0     B   superscript  x    2    d  x       if  x   0      W(dx)=\begin{cases}Ax^{-2}\,dx&\text{if }x>0\\
 Bx^{-2}\,dx&\text{if }x<0\end{cases}   , where    A  ≠  B      A  B    A\neq B   ,    A  >  0      A  0    A>0   and    B  >  0      B  0    B>0   . 19  Given this,   β   β   \beta   is a function of   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   .  The characteristic function of the asymmetric Cauchy distribution has the form: 20        E   [   e   i  θ   X  t     ]    =   e   -   t   (    |  θ  |   +    i  β  θ   ln   |  θ  |     /   (   2  π   )     )       .       normal-E   superscript  e    i  θ   subscript  X  t       superscript  e      t      θ       i  β  θ      θ       2  π          \operatorname{E}\Big[e^{i\theta X_{t}}\Big]=e^{-t(|\theta|+i\beta\theta\ln|%
 \theta|/(2\pi))}.     The marginal probability distribution of the asymmetric Cauchy process is a stable distribution with index of stability equal to 1.  References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩       ↩  ↩
