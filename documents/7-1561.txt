Transfer matrix

In applied mathematics, the transfer matrix is a formulation in terms of a block-Toeplitz matrix of the two-scale equation, which characterizes refinable functions. Refinable functions play an important role in wavelet theory and finite element theory.
For the mask 
 
 
 
 , which is a vector with component indexes from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , the transfer matrix of 
 
 
 
 , we call it 
 
 
 
  here, is defined as


 
  More verbosely


 
  The effect of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in terms of the downsampling operator "

Properties



 
 .
If you drop the first and the last column and move the odd-indexed columns to the left and the even-indexed columns to the right, then you obtain a transposed Sylvester matrix.
The determinant of a transfer matrix is essentially a resultant.


More precisely:
 
Let 
 
 
 
  be the even-indexed coefficients of 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 ) and let 
 
 
 
  be the odd-indexed coefficients of 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 ).
 
Then 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the resultant.
 
This connection allows for fast computation using the Euclidean algorithm.
 


For the trace of the transfer matrix of convolved masks holds





For the determinant of the transfer matrix of convolved mask holds





where 
 
 
 
  denotes the mask with alternating signs, i.e.

This is a concretion of the determinant property above. From the determinant property one knows that 
 
 
 
  is singular whenever 
 
 
 
  is singular. This property also tells, how vectors from the null space of 
 
 
 
  can be converted to null space vectors of 
 
 
 
 .
 


If 
 
 
 
  is an eigenvector of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



 
 ,

then 
 
 
 
  is an eigenvector of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the same eigenvalue, i.e.
 


 
 .
 


Let 
 
 
 
  be the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 , which implies 
 
 
 
  and more generally 
 
 
 
 . This sum is useful for estimating the spectral radius of 
 
 
 
 . There is an alternative possibility for computing the sum of eigenvalue powers, which is faster for small 
 
 
 
 .


Let 
 
 
 
  be the periodization of 
 
 
 
  with respect to period 
 
 
 
 . That is 
 
 
 
  is a circular filter, which means that the component indexes are residue classes with respect to the modulus 
 
 
 
 . Then with the upsampling operator 
 
 
 
  it holds
 



Actually not 
 
 
 
  convolutions are necessary, but only 
 
 
 
  ones, when applying the strategy of efficient computation of powers. Even more the approach can be further sped up using the Fast Fourier transform.
 


From the previous statement we can derive an estimate of the spectral radius of 
 
 
 
 . It holds





where 
 
 
 
  is the size of the filter and if all eigenvalues are real, it is also true that
