Generalized inverse

In mathematics, a generalized inverse of a matrix A is a matrix that has some properties of the inverse matrix of A but not necessarily all of them. Formally, given a matrix 
 
 
 
  and a matrix 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a generalized inverse of 
 
 
 
 
  if it satisfies the condition 
 
 
 
 .
The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse is to obtain a matrix that can serve as the inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible ones. A generalized inverse exists for an arbitrary matrix, and when a matrix has an inverse, then this inverse is its unique generalized inverse. Some generalized inverses can be defined in any mathematical structure that involves associative multiplication, that is, in a semigroup.
Types of generalized inverses
The Penrose conditions are used to define different generalized inverses: for 
 
 
 
  and

If 
 
 
 
  satisfies condition (1.), it is a generalized inverse of 
 
 
 
 , if it satisfies conditions (1.) and (2.) then it is a generalized reflexive inverse of 
 
 
 
 
 , and if it satisfies all 4 conditions, then it is a Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of 
 
 
 
 .
Other various kinds of generalized inverses include

One-sided inverse (left inverse or right inverse) If the matrix A has dimensions 
 
 
 
  and is full rank then use the left inverse if 
 
 
 
  and the right inverse if 
 
 

Left inverse is given by 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
identity matrix.
Right inverse is given by 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
  identity matrix.

Uses
Any generalized inverse can be used to determine if a system of linear equations has any solutions, and if so to give all of them.1 If any solutions exist for the n × m linear system



with vector 
 
 
 
  of unknowns and vector b of constants, all solutions are given by



parametric on the arbitrary vector w, where 
 
 
 
  is any generalized inverse of 
 
 
 
  Solutions exist if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a solution – that is, if and only if
