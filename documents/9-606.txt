   List of quantum-mechanical systems with analytical solutions      List of quantum-mechanical systems with analytical solutions   Much insight in quantum mechanics can be gained from understanding the solutions to the time-dependent non-relativistic Schrödinger equation in an appropriate configuration space . In vector Cartesian coordinates   𝐫   𝐫   \mathbf{r}   , the equation takes the form       H  ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =    (   T  +  V   )   ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =    [    -     ℏ  2    2  m     ∇  2     +   V   (  𝐫  )     ]   ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =   i  ℏ     ∂  ψ    (  𝐫  ,  t  )     ∂  t             H  ψ   𝐫  t        T  V   ψ   𝐫  t            delimited-[]           superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m     superscript  normal-∇  2       V  𝐫     ψ   𝐫  t           i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi        ψ    𝐫  t      t        H\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)=\left(T+V\right)\,\psi\left(\mathbf{r},t\right)%

 \partial t}     in which   ψ   ψ   \psi   is the wavefunction of the system, H is the Hamiltonian operator , and T and V are the operators for the kinetic energy and potential energy , respectively. (Common forms of these operators appear in the square brackets.) The quantity t is the time. Stationary states of this equation are found by solving the eigenvalue - eigenfunction (time-independent) form of the Schrödinger equation,        [    -     ℏ  2    2  m     ∇  2     +   V   (  𝐫  )     ]   ψ   (  𝐫  )    =   E  ψ   (  𝐫  )           delimited-[]           superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m     superscript  normal-∇  2       V  𝐫     ψ  𝐫     E  ψ  𝐫     \left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V\left(\mathbf{r}\right)\right]\psi\left%
 (\mathbf{r}\right)=E\psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right)     or any equivalent formulation of this equation in a different coordinate system other than Cartesian coordinates. For example, systems with spherical symmetry are simplified when expressed with spherical coordinates . Very often, only numerical solutions to the Schrödinger equation can be found for a given physical system and its associated potential energy. Fortunately, there exists a subset of physical systems for which the form of the eigenfunctions and their associated energies can be found.
