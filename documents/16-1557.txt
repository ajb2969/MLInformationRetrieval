   Draft:Bertrand curve      Draft:Bertrand curve    A Bertrand curve is a Frenet curve in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   with the additional property that there is a second curve in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   such that the principle normal vectors to these two curves are identical at each corresponding point. In other words, if      r  →   1    (  t  )        subscript   normal-→  r   1   t    \vec{r}_{1}(t)   and      r  →   2    (  t  )        subscript   normal-→  r   2   t    \vec{r}_{2}(t)   are two curves in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   such that for any   t   t   t   ,      N  →   1   =    N  →   2        subscript   normal-→  N   1    subscript   normal-→  N   2     \vec{N}_{1}=\vec{N}_{2}   , then     r  →   1     subscript   normal-→  r   1    \vec{r}_{1}   and     r  →   2     subscript   normal-→  r   2    \vec{r}_{2}   are Bertrand curves. For this reason it is common to speak of a Bertrand pair of curves (like     r  →   1     subscript   normal-→  r   1    \vec{r}_{1}   and     r  →   2     subscript   normal-→  r   2    \vec{r}_{2}   in the previous example). According to problem 25 in Kühnel's "Differential Geometry Curves - Surfaces - Manifolds", it is also true that two Bertrand curves that do not lie in the same 2-dimensional plane are characterized by the existence of a linear relation      a  κ   +   b  τ    =  1          a  κ     b  τ    1    a\kappa+b\tau=1   where    a  ,  b     a  b    a,b   are real constants and    a  ≠  0      a  0    a\neq 0   . 1 Furthermore, the product of torsions of Bertrand pairs of curves are constant. 2  Bertrand Curves  "     Page 53 of "Differential Geometry Curves - Surfaces - Manifolds" by Wolfgang Kühnel ISBN-13: 978-0821839881 ↩  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BertrandCurves.html ↩
