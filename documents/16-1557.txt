Draft:Bertrand curve


A Bertrand curve is a Frenet curve in 
 
 
 
  with the additional property that there is a second curve in 
 
 
 
  such that the principle normal vectors to these two curves are identical at each corresponding point. In other words, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two curves in 
 
 
 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are Bertrand curves. For this reason it is common to speak of a Bertrand pair of curves (like 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the previous example). According to problem 25 in Kühnel's "Differential Geometry Curves - Surfaces - Manifolds", it is also true that two Bertrand curves that do not lie in the same 2-dimensional plane are characterized by the existence of a linear relation 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are real constants and 
 
 
 
 .1 Furthermore, the product of torsions of Bertrand pairs of curves are constant.2
