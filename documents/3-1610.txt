   Causal system      Causal system   In control theory , a causal system (also known as a physical or nonanticipative system ) is a system where the output depends on past and current inputs but not future inputs i.e. the output    y   (   t  0   )       y   subscript  t  0     y(t_{0})   only depends on the input    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   for values of    t  ≤   t  0       t   subscript  t  0     t\leq t_{0}   .  The idea that the output of a function at any time depends only on past and present values of input is defined by the property commonly referred to as causality . A system that has some dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible dependence on past or current input values) is termed a non-causal or acausal system , and a system that depends solely on future input values is an anticausal system . Note that some authors have defined an anticausal system as one that depends solely on future and present input values or, more simply, as a system that does not depend on past input values.  Classically, nature or physical reality has been considered to be a causal system. Physics involving special relativity or general relativity require more careful definitions of causality, as described elaborately in causality (physics) .  The causality of systems also plays an important role in digital signal processing , where filters are constructed so that they are causal, sometimes by altering a non-causal formulation to remove the lack of causality so that it is realizable. For more information, see causal filter . For a causal system, the impulse response of the system must be 0 for all    t  <  0      t  0    t<0   . That is the sole necessary as well as sufficient condition for causality of a system, linear or non-linear. Note that similar rules apply to either discrete or continuous cases.  Mathematical definitions  Definition 1: A system mapping   x   x   x   to   y   y   y   is causal if and only if, for any pair of input signals     x  1    (  t  )        subscript  x  1   t    x_{1}(t)   and     x  2    (  t  )        subscript  x  2   t    x_{2}(t)   such that          x  1    (  t  )    =    x  2    (  t  )     ,    ∀  t   ≤   t  0     ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  x  1   t      subscript  x  2   t       for-all  t    subscript  t  0      x_{1}(t)=x_{2}(t),\quad\forall\ t\leq t_{0},   the corresponding outputs satisfy          y  1    (  t  )    =    y  2    (  t  )     ,    ∀  t   ≤   t  0     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  y  1   t      subscript  y  2   t       for-all  t    subscript  t  0      y_{1}(t)=y_{2}(t),\quad\forall\ t\leq t_{0}.     Definition 2: Suppose    h   (  t  )       h  t    h(t)   is the impulse response of the system   H   H   H   . (only fully accurate for a system described by linear constant coefficient differential equation). The system   H   H   H   is causal if and only if        h   (  t  )    =  0   ,    ∀  t   <  0      formulae-sequence      h  t   0      for-all  t   0     h(t)=0,\quad\forall\ t<0   otherwise it is non-causal.
