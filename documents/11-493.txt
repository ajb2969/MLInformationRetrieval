Glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase

In enzymology, a glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + H2O 
 
 
 
  choline + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and H2O, whereas its two products are choline and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine glycerophosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include glycerophosphinicocholine diesterase, glycerylphosphorylcholinediesterase, sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine diesterase, glycerolphosphorylcholine phosphodiesterase, and glycerophosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
