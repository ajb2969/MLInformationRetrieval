   FAD reductase (NADH)      FAD reductase (NADH)   FAD reductase (NADH) (, NADH-FAD reductase , NADH-dependent FAD reductase ) is an enzyme with system name FADH 2 :NAD + oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   FADH 2 + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   FAD + NADH + H +    The enzyme from Burkholderia phenoliruptrix has a preference for FAD.
