23S rRNA (cytidine2498-2'-O)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (cytidine2498-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, YgdE, rRNA large subunit methyltransferase M, RlmM) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (cytidine2498-2'-O-)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine2498 in 23S rRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine2498 in 23S rRNA
