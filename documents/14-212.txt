   Morris–Lecar model      Morris–Lecar model   The Morris–Lecar model is a biological neuron model developed by Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar to reproduce the variety of oscillatory behavior in relation to Ca ++ and K + conductance in the giant barnacle muscle fiber. 1 Morris–Lecar neurons exhibit both class I and class II neuron excitability.  Experimental method  The Morris–Lecar experiments relied on the current clamp method established by Keynes  et al. (1973). 2   The principal assumptions underlying the Morris–Lecar model include   Equations apply to a spatially iso-potential patch of membrane. There are two persistent (non-inactivating) voltage-gated currents with oppositively biased reversal potentials. The depolarizing current is carried by Na+ or Ca2+ ions (or both), depending on the system to be modeled, and the hyperpolarizing current is carried by K+.  Activation gates follow changes in membrane potential sufficiently rapidly that the activating conductance can instantaneously relax to its steady-state value at any voltage.  The dynamics of the recovery variable can be approximated by a first-order linear differential equation for the probability of channel opening.   3  Physiological description  The Morris–Lecar model is a two-dimensional system of nonlinear  differential equations . It is considered a simplified model compared to the four-dimensional Hodgkin–Huxley model .  Qualitatively, this system of equations describes the complex relationship between membrane potential and the activation of ion channels within the membrane: the potential depends on the activity of the ion channels, and the activity of the ion channels depends on the voltage. As bifurcation parameters are altered, different classes of neuron behavior are exhibited. is associated with the relative time scales of the firing dynamics, which varies broadly from cell to cell and exhibits significant temperature dependency. 4  Quantitatively:      C     d  V    d  t         C      d  V     d  t      \displaystyle C\frac{dV}{dt}     where      M  ss     subscript  M  ss    \displaystyle M_{\mathrm{ss}}     Note that the and equations may also be expressed as (1 + Exp[-2( V - V 1 ) / V 2 ]) −1 }} and (1 + Exp[-2( V - V 3 ) / V 4 ]) −1 }} , however most authors prefer the form using the hyperbolic functions.

Despite missing delays in the onset of recovery, the model appears to be adequate for phase-plane considerations for many excitable systems. ↩   ↩
