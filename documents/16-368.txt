   Order of a polynomial      Order of a polynomial   In mathematics , the order of a polynomial may have several meanings, depending on the context.   Order has been used to denoted the degree of a polynomial . Nowadays, this terminology is rarely used.  Order may refer to the order of the polynomial, viewed as a power series, that is the degree of its nonzero monomial of lowest degree.  The meaning in this article.   In this article, the order of a polynomial , relative to a particular set of polynomial  basis functions spanning the polynomial vector space in which a given polynomial is included, is the highest degree among those basis functions used to express the polynomial. 1  Example  Consider the following polynomial:       P   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     p  i    x  i           P  x     subscript   superscript   n     i  0       subscript  p  i    superscript  x  i       P(x)=\sum^{n}_{i=0}p_{i}x^{i}   where    (   p  0   ,  …  ,   p  n   )      subscript  p  0   normal-…   subscript  p  n     \left(p_{0},\ldots,p_{n}\right)   are the polynomial coefficients and    {  1  ,  x  ,  …  ,   x  n   }     1  x  normal-…   superscript  x  n     \left\{1,x,\ldots,x^{n}\right\}   the set of basis functions which span the polynomial vector space.  If the polynomial coefficients are:      (  1  ,  2  ,  0  ,  …  ,  0  )     1  2  0  normal-…  0    \left(1,2,0,\ldots,0\right)     under this polynomial vector space,    P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)   is expressed as follows:       P   (  x  )    =   1  +   2  x          P  x     1    2  x      P(x)=1+2x     The degree of this polynomial would be 1. Yet, due to the set of basis functions which is used to define this polynomial, its order would be   n   n   n   .  Now, consider the same polynomial expressed in Lagrange form . If this polynomial is defined as a linear combination of the following set of basis functions:      {     x  -  0.5    0.5  -  0    ⋅    x  -  1    0  -  1     ;     x  -  0    0.5  -  0    ⋅    x  -  1    0.5  -  1     ;     x  -  0    1  -  0    ⋅    x  -  0.5    1  -  0.5     }      normal-⋅      x  0.5     0.5  0        x  1     0  1      normal-⋅      x  0     0.5  0        x  1     0.5  1      normal-⋅      x  0     1  0        x  0.5     1  0.5       \left\{\frac{x-0.5}{0.5-0}\cdot\frac{x-1}{0-1};\frac{x-0}{0.5-0}\cdot\frac{x-1%
 }{0.5-1};\frac{x-0}{1-0}\cdot\frac{x-0.5}{1-0.5}\right\}   then, the polynomial coefficients would be:      p  =   {  1  ,  1.5  ,  2  }       p   1  1.5  2     p=\left\{1,1.5,2\right\}   .  The degree of this polynomial would still be 1, but as the highest degree of the Lagrangian basis functions is   2   2   2   , then the order of this polynomial is 2.
