Order of a polynomial

In mathematics, the order of a polynomial may have several meanings, depending on the context.

Order has been used to denoted the degree of a polynomial. Nowadays, this terminology is rarely used.
Order may refer to the order of the polynomial, viewed as a power series, that is the degree of its nonzero monomial of lowest degree.
The meaning in this article.

In this article, the order of a polynomial, relative to a particular set of polynomial basis functions spanning the polynomial vector space in which a given polynomial is included, is the highest degree among those basis functions used to express the polynomial.1
Example
Consider the following polynomial:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the polynomial coefficients and 
 
 
 
  the set of basis functions which span the polynomial vector space.
If the polynomial coefficients are:



under this polynomial vector space, 
 
 
 
  is expressed as follows:



The degree of this polynomial would be 1. Yet, due to the set of basis functions which is used to define this polynomial, its order would be 
 
 
 
 .
Now, consider the same polynomial expressed in Lagrange form. If this polynomial is defined as a linear combination of the following set of basis functions:


 
  then, the polynomial coefficients would be:


 
 .
The degree of this polynomial would still be 1, but as the highest degree of the Lagrangian basis functions is 
 
 
 
 , then the order of this polynomial is 2.
