   Phosphoribulokinase      Phosphoribulokinase   In enzymology , a phosphoribulokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-ribulose 5-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-ribulose 5-phosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-ribulose-5-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include phosphopentokinase , ribulose-5-phosphate kinase , phosphopentokinase , phosphoribulokinase (phosphorylating) , 5-phosphoribulose kinase , ribulose phosphate kinase , PKK , PRuK , and PRK . This enzyme participates in carbon fixation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
