   (+)-trans-carveol dehydrogenase      (+)-trans-carveol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (+)-trans-carveol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+)-trans-carveol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)-(S)-carvone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (+)-trans-carveol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (+)-(S)-carvone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-trans-carveol:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called carveol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and the degradation of the terpenes  limonene and pinene .
