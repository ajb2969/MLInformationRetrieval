   Renal clearance ratio      Renal clearance ratio   The renal clearance ratio or fractional excretion is a measure of the speed at which a constituent of urine passes through the kidneys . It is defined by following equation:       c  l  e  a  r  a  n  c   e   r  a  t  i   o   o   f   X   =    C  x    C   i  n           c  l  e  a  r  a  n  c  e  r  a  t  i  o  o  f  X      subscript  C  x    subscript  C    i  n       clearance\ ratio\ of\ X=\frac{C_{x}}{C_{in}}      X is the analyte substance  C x is the renal plasma clearance of X  C in is the renal plasma clearance of inulin .   Creatinine is sometimes used instead of inulin as the reference substance.  See also   Kt/V   "  Category:Nephrology
