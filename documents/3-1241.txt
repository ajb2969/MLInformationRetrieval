Renal clearance ratio

 The renal clearance ratio or fractional excretion is a measure of the speed at which a constituent of urine passes through the kidneys. It is defined by following equation:




X is the analyte substance
Cx is the renal plasma clearance of X
Cin is the renal plasma clearance of inulin.

Creatinine is sometimes used instead of inulin as the reference substance.
