   Algebraically closed group      Algebraically closed group   In mathematics , in the realm of group theory , a group    A   A   A   is algebraically closed if any finite set of equations and inequations that "make sense" in   A   A   A   already have a solution in   A   A   A   . This idea will be made precise later in the article.  Informal discussion  Suppose we wished to find an element   x   x   x   of a group   G   G   G   satisfying the conditions (equations and inequations):         x  2   =  1       superscript  x  2   1    x^{2}=1          x  3   =  1       superscript  x  3   1    x^{3}=1         x  ≠  1      x  1    x\neq 1        Then it is easy to see that this is impossible because the first two equations imply    x  =  1      x  1    x=1   . In this case we say the set of conditions are inconsistent with   G   G   G   . (In fact this set of conditions are inconsistent with any group whatsoever.)         G   G   G                  .    absent   .          1  ¯     normal-¯  1    \underline{1}          a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \underline{a}            1  ¯     normal-¯  1    \underline{1}         1   1   1         a   a   a            a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \underline{a}         a   a   a         1   1   1           Now suppose   G   G   G   is the group with the multiplication table:  Then the conditions:         x  2   =  1       superscript  x  2   1    x^{2}=1         x  ≠  1      x  1    x\neq 1        have a solution in   G   G   G   , namely    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   .  However the conditions:         x  4   =  1       superscript  x  4   1    x^{4}=1           x  2    a   -  1     =  1         superscript  x  2    superscript  a    1     1    x^{2}a^{-1}=1        Do not have a solution in   G   G   G   , as can easily be checked.         H   H   H                  .    absent   .          1  ¯     normal-¯  1    \underline{1}          a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \underline{a}          b  ¯     normal-¯  b    \underline{b}          c  ¯     normal-¯  c    \underline{c}            1  ¯     normal-¯  1    \underline{1}         1   1   1         a   a   a         b   b   b         c   c   c            a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \underline{a}         a   a   a         1   1   1         c   c   c         b   b   b            b  ¯     normal-¯  b    \underline{b}         b   b   b         c   c   c         a   a   a         1   1   1            c  ¯     normal-¯  c    \underline{c}         c   c   c         b   b   b         1   1   1         a   a   a           However if we extend the group   G   G   G   to the group   H   H   H   with multiplication table:  Then the conditions have two solutions, namely    x  =  b      x  b    x=b   and    x  =  c      x  c    x=c   .  Thus there are three possibilities regarding such conditions:   They may be inconsistent with   G   G   G   and have no solution in any extension of   G   G   G   .  They may have a solution in   G   G   G   .  They may have no solution in   G   G   G   but nevertheless have a solution in some extension   H   H   H   of   G   G   G   .   It is reasonable to ask whether there are any groups   A   A   A   such that whenever a set of conditions like these have a solution at all, they have a solution in   A   A   A   itself? The answer turns out to be "yes", and we call such groups algebraically closed groups.  Formal definition of an algebraically closed group  We first need some preliminary ideas.  If   G   G   G   is a group and   F   F   F   is the free group on countably many generators, then by a finite set of equations and inequations with coefficients in    G   G   G   we mean a pair of subsets   E   E   E   and   I   I   I   of    F  ⋆  G     normal-⋆  F  G    F\star G   the free product of   F   F   F   and   G   G   G   .  This formalizes the notion of a set of equations and inequations consisting of variables    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   and elements    g  j     subscript  g  j    g_{j}   of   G   G   G   . The set   E   E   E   represents equations like:          x  1  2    g  1  4    x  3    =  1         superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  g  1   4    subscript  x  3    1    x_{1}^{2}g_{1}^{4}x_{3}=1           x  3  2    g  2    x  4    g  1    =  1         superscript   subscript  x  3   2    subscript  g  2    subscript  x  4    subscript  g  1    1    x_{3}^{2}g_{2}x_{4}g_{1}=1        …   normal-…   \dots        The set   I   I   I   represents inequations like          g  5   -  1     x  3    ≠  1         superscript   subscript  g  5     1     subscript  x  3    1    g_{5}^{-1}x_{3}\neq 1        …   normal-…   \dots        By a solution in   G   G   G   to this finite set of equations and inequations, we mean a homomorphism    f  :   F  →  G      normal-:  f   normal-→  F  G     f:F\rightarrow G   , such that      f  ~    (  e  )    =  1         normal-~  f   e   1    \tilde{f}(e)=1   for all    e  ∈  E      e  E    e\in E   and      f  ~    (  i  )    ≠  1         normal-~  f   i   1    \tilde{f}(i)\neq 1   for all    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   . Where    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   is the unique homomorphism     f  ~   :    F  ⋆  G   →  G      normal-:   normal-~  f    normal-→   normal-⋆  F  G   G     \tilde{f}:F\star G\rightarrow G   that equals   f   f   f   on   F   F   F   and is the identity on   G   G   G   .  This formalizes the idea of substituting elements of   G   G   G   for the variables to get true identities and inidentities. In the example the substitutions      x  1   ↦   g  6    ,    x  3   ↦   g  7       formulae-sequence   maps-to   subscript  x  1    subscript  g  6     maps-to   subscript  x  3    subscript  g  7      x_{1}\mapsto g_{6},x_{3}\mapsto g_{7}   and     x  4   ↦   g  8      maps-to   subscript  x  4    subscript  g  8     x_{4}\mapsto g_{8}   yield:          g  6  2    g  1  4    g  7    =  1         superscript   subscript  g  6   2    superscript   subscript  g  1   4    subscript  g  7    1    g_{6}^{2}g_{1}^{4}g_{7}=1           g  7  2    g  2    g  8    g  1    =  1         superscript   subscript  g  7   2    subscript  g  2    subscript  g  8    subscript  g  1    1    g_{7}^{2}g_{2}g_{8}g_{1}=1        …   normal-…   \dots           g  5   -  1     g  7    ≠  1         superscript   subscript  g  5     1     subscript  g  7    1    g_{5}^{-1}g_{7}\neq 1        …   normal-…   \dots        We say the finite set of equations and inequations is consistent with    G   G   G   if we can solve them in a "bigger" group   H   H   H   . More formally:  The equations and inequations are consistent with   G   G   G   if there is a group   H   H   H   and an embedding    h  :   G  →  H      normal-:  h   normal-→  G  H     h:G\rightarrow H   such that the finite set of equations and inequations     h  ~    (  E  )        normal-~  h   E    \tilde{h}(E)   and     h  ~    (  I  )        normal-~  h   I    \tilde{h}(I)   has a solution in   H   H   H   . Where    h  ~     normal-~  h    \tilde{h}   is the unique homomorphism     h  ~   :    F  ⋆  G   →   F  ⋆  H       normal-:   normal-~  h    normal-→   normal-⋆  F  G    normal-⋆  F  H      \tilde{h}:F\star G\rightarrow F\star H   that equals   h   h   h   on   G   G   G   and is the identity on   F   F   F   .  Now we formally define the group   A   A   A   to be algebraically closed if every finite set of equations and inequations that has coefficients in   A   A   A   and is consistent with   A   A   A   has a solution in   A   A   A   .  Known Results  It is difficult to give concrete examples of algebraically closed groups as the following results indicate:   Every countable group can be embedded in a countable algebraically closed group.  Every algebraically closed group is simple .  No algebraically closed group is finitely generated .  An algebraically closed group cannot be recursively presented .  A finitely generated group has solvable word problem if and only if it can embedded in every algebraically closed group.   The proofs of these results are, in general very complex. However a sketch of the proof that a countable group   C   C   C   can be embedded in an algebraically closed group follows.  First we embed   C   C   C   in a countable group    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   with the property that every finite set of equations with coefficients in   C   C   C   that is consistent in    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   has a solution in    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   as follows:  There are only countably many finite sets of equations and inequations with coefficients in   C   C   C   . Fix an enumeration     S  0   ,   S  1   ,   S  2   ,  …      subscript  S  0    subscript  S  1    subscript  S  2   normal-…    S_{0},S_{1},S_{2},\dots   of them. Define groups     D  0   ,   D  1   ,   D  2   ,  …      subscript  D  0    subscript  D  1    subscript  D  2   normal-…    D_{0},D_{1},D_{2},\dots   inductively by:         D  0   =  C       subscript  D  0   C    D_{0}=C          D_{i+1} =     \left\{\begin{matrix} D_i\ &\mbox{if}\ S_i\ \mbox{is not consistent with}\ D_i \\ \langle D_i,h_1,h_2,\dots,h_n \rangle &\mbox{if}\ S_i\ \mbox{has a solution in}\ H\supseteq D_i\ \mbox{with}\ x_j\mapsto h_j\ 1\le j\le n \end{matrix}\right.  Now let:         C  1   =    ∪   i  =  0   ∞    D  i         subscript  C  1     superscript   subscript     i  0       subscript  D  i      C_{1}=\cup_{i=0}^{\infty}D_{i}        Now iterate this construction to get a sequence of groups    C  =    C  0   ,   C  1   ,   C  2   ,  …       C    subscript  C  0    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2   normal-…     C=C_{0},C_{1},C_{2},\dots   and let:        A  =    ∪   i  =  0   ∞    C  i        A    superscript   subscript     i  0       subscript  C  i      A=\cup_{i=0}^{\infty}C_{i}        Then   A   A   A   is a countable group containing   C   C   C   . It is algebraically closed because any finite set of equations and inequations that is consistent with   A   A   A   must have coefficients in some    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   and so must have a solution in    C   i  +  1      subscript  C    i  1     C_{i+1}   .
