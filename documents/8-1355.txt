Algebraically closed group

In mathematics, in the realm of group theory, a group

 
 
  is algebraically closed if any finite set of equations and inequations that "make sense" in 
 
 
 
  already have a solution in 
 
 
 
 . This idea will be made precise later in the article.
Informal discussion
Suppose we wished to find an element 
 
 
 
  of a group 
 
 
 
  satisfying the conditions (equations and inequations):














Then it is easy to see that this is impossible because the first two equations imply 
 
 
 
 . In this case we say the set of conditions are inconsistent with 
 
 
 
 . (In fact this set of conditions are inconsistent with any group whatsoever.)




























































Now suppose 
 
 
 
 
  is the group with the multiplication table:
Then the conditions:











have a solution in 
 
 
 
 , namely 
 
 
 
 .
However the conditions:











Do not have a solution in 
 
 
 
 , as can easily be checked.
































































































































However if we extend the group 
 
 
 
  to the group 
 
 
 
 
  with multiplication table:
Then the conditions have two solutions, namely 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Thus there are three possibilities regarding such conditions:

They may be inconsistent with 
 
 
 
  and have no solution in any extension of 
 
 
 
 .
They may have a solution in 
 
 
 
 
 .
They may have no solution in 
 
 
 
  but nevertheless have a solution in some extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .

It is reasonable to ask whether there are any groups 
 
 
 
  such that whenever a set of conditions like these have a solution at all, they have a solution in 
 
 
 
 
  itself? The answer turns out to be "yes", and we call such groups algebraically closed groups.
Formal definition of an algebraically closed group
We first need some preliminary ideas.
If 
 
 
 
  is a group and 
 
 
 
  is the free group on countably many generators, then by a finite set of equations and inequations with coefficients in

 
  we mean a pair of subsets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  the free product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
This formalizes the notion of a set of equations and inequations consisting of variables 
 
 
 
  and elements 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
  represents equations like:














The set 
 
 
 
  represents inequations like











By a solution in 
 
 
 
  to this finite set of equations and inequations, we mean a homomorphism 
 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Where 
 
 
 
 
  is the unique homomorphism 
 
 
 
  that equals 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and is the identity on 
 
 
 
 .
This formalizes the idea of substituting elements of 
 
 
 
 
  for the variables to get true identities and inidentities. In the example the substitutions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  yield:




















We say the finite set of equations and inequations is consistent with

 
  if we can solve them in a "bigger" group 
 
 
 
 . More formally:
The equations and inequations are consistent with 
 
 
 
 
  if there is a group
 
 
 
  and an embedding 
 
 
 
  such that the finite set of equations and inequations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has a solution in 
 
 
 
 
 . Where 
 
 
 
  is the unique homomorphism 
 
 
 
  that equals 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and is the identity on 
 
 
 
 
 .
Now we formally define the group 
 
 
 
  to be algebraically closed if every finite set of equations and inequations that has coefficients in 
 
 
 
  and is consistent with 
 
 
 
  has a solution in 
 
 
 
 .
Known Results
It is difficult to give concrete examples of algebraically closed groups as the following results indicate:

Every countable group can be embedded in a countable algebraically closed group.
Every algebraically closed group is simple.
No algebraically closed group is finitely generated.
An algebraically closed group cannot be recursively presented.
A finitely generated group has solvable word problem if and only if it can embedded in every algebraically closed group.

The proofs of these results are, in general very complex. However a sketch of the proof that a countable group 
 
 
 
 
  can be embedded in an algebraically closed group follows.
First we embed 
 
 
 
  in a countable group 
 
 
 
  with the property that every finite set of equations with coefficients in 
 
 
 
  that is consistent in 
 
 
 
  has a solution in 
 
 
 
 
  as follows:
There are only countably many finite sets of equations and inequations with coefficients in 
 
 
 
 . Fix an enumeration 
 
 
 
  of them. Define groups 
 
 
 
  inductively by:














\left\{\begin{matrix} D_i\ &\mbox{if}\ S_i\ \mbox{is not consistent with}\ D_i \\ \langle D_i,h_1,h_2,\dots,h_n \rangle &\mbox{if}\ S_i\ \mbox{has a solution in}\ H\supseteq D_i\ \mbox{with}\ x_j\mapsto h_j\ 1\le j\le n \end{matrix}\right. 
Now let:








Now iterate this construction to get a sequence of groups 
 
 
 
  and let:








Then 
 
 
 
  is a countable group containing 
 
 
 
 . It is algebraically closed because any finite set of equations and inequations that is consistent with 
 
 
 
 
  must have coefficients in some 
 
 
 
  and so must have a solution in 
 
 
 
 .
