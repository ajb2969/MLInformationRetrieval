   Symmetric product of an algebraic curve      Symmetric product of an algebraic curve   In mathematics , the n -fold symmetric product of an algebraic curve  C is the quotient space of the n -fold cartesian product   C × C × ... × C    or C n by the group action of the symmetric group on n letters permuting the factors. It exists as a smooth  algebraic variety Σ n C ; if C is a compact Riemann surface it is therefore a complex manifold . Its interest in relation to the classical geometry of curves is that its points correspond to effective divisors on C of degree n , that is, formal sums of points with non-negative integer coefficients.  For C the projective line (say the Riemann sphere ) Σ n C can be identified with projective space of dimension n .  If G has genus  g ≥ 1 then the Σ n C are closely related to the Jacobian variety  J of C . More accurately for n taking values up to g they form a sequence of approximations to J from below: their images in J under addition on J (see theta-divisor ) have dimension n and fill up J , with some identifications caused by special divisors .  For g = n we have Σ g C actually birationally equivalent to J ; the Jacobian is a blowing down of the symmetric product. That means that at the level of function fields it is possible to construct J by taking linearly disjoint copies of the function field of C , and within their compositum taking the fixed subfield of the symmetric group. This is the source of André Weil 's technique of constructing J as an abstract variety from 'birational data'. Other ways of constructing J , for example as a Picard variety , are preferred now ( Greg W. Anderson ( Advances in Math. 172 (2002) 169–205) provided an elementary construction as lines of matrices). But this does mean that for any rational function F on C   F ( x 1 ) + ... + F ( x g )   makes sense as a rational function on J , for the x i staying away from the poles of F .  For N > g the mapping from Σ n C to J by addition fibers it over J ; when n is large enough (around twice g ) this becomes a projective space bundle (the Picard bundle ). It has been studied in detail, for example by Kempf and Mukai.  Betti numbers and the euler characteristic of the symmetric product  Let C be smooth and projective of genus g over the complex numbers C . The Betti numbers b i (Σ n C) of the symmetric product are given by        ∑   n  =  0   ∞     ∑   i  =  0    2  n      b  i    (    Σ  n   C   )    y  n    u   i  -  n       =     (   1  +  y   )    2  g      (   1  -   u  y    )    (   1  -    u   -  1    y    )           superscript   subscript     n  0        superscript   subscript     i  0      2  n       subscript  b  i      superscript  normal-Σ  n   C    superscript  y  n    superscript  u    i  n          superscript    1  y     2  g        1    u  y      1     superscript  u    1    y        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{2n}b_{i}(\Sigma^{n}C)y^{n}u^{i-n}=\frac{(1+y)^{%
 2g}}{(1-uy)(1-u^{-1}y)}   and the topological Euler characteristic e (Σ n C) is given by         ∑   n  =  0   ∞    e   (    Σ  n   C   )    p  n     =    (   1  -  p   )     2  g   -  2     .        superscript   subscript     n  0        e     superscript  normal-Σ  n   C    superscript  p  n      superscript    1  p       2  g   2      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}e(\Sigma^{n}C)p^{n}=(1-p)^{2g-2}.   Here we have set u =-1 and y = - p in the formula before.  References     "  Category:Algebraic curves  Category:Symmetric functions
