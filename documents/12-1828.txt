Complexity index

Besides complexity intended as a difficulty to compute a function (see computational complexity), in modern computer science and in statistics another complexity index of a function stands for denoting its information content, in turn affecting the difficulty of learning the function from examples. Complexity indices in this sense characterize the entire class of functions to which the one we are interested in belongs. Focusing on Boolean functions, the detail of a class 
 
 
 
  of Boolean functions c essentially denotes how deeply the class is articulated.
To identify this index we must first define a sentry function of 
 
 
 
 . Let us focus for a moment on a single function c, call it a concept defined on a set 
 
 
 
  of elements that we may figure as points in a Euclidean space. In this framework, the above function associates to c a set of points that, since are defined to be external to the concept, prevent it from expanding into another function of 
 
 
 
 . We may dually define these points in terms of sentinelling a given concept c from being fully enclosed (invaded) by another concept within the class. Therefore we call these points either sentinels or sentry points; they are assigned by the sentry function 
 
 
 
  to each concept of 
 
 
 
  in such a way that:

the sentry points are external to the concept c to be sentineled and internal to at least one other including it,
each concept 
 
 
 
  including c has at least one of the sentry points of c either in the gap between c and 
 
 
 
 , or outside 
 
 
 
  and distinct from the sentry points of 
 
 
 
 , and
they constitute a minimal set with these properties.

The technical definition coming from  is rooted in the inclusion of an augmented concept 
 
 
 
  made up of c plus its sentry points by another 
 
 
 
  in the same class.
Definition of sentry function
For a concept class 
 
 
 
  on a space 
 
 
 
 , a sentry function is a total function

 
  satisfying the following conditions:

Sentinels are outside the sentineled concept (

 
  for all 
 
 
).
Sentinels are inside the invading concept (Having introduced the sets 
 
 
 
 , an invading concept 
 
 
 
  is such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Denoting 
 
 
 
  the set of concepts invading c, we must have that if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
).


 
  is a minimal set with the above properties (No 
 
 
 
  exists satisfying (1) and (2) and having the property that 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
).
Sentinels are honest guardians. It may be that 
 
 
 
  but 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 . This however must be a consequence of the fact that all points of 
 
 
 
  are involved in really sentineling c against other concepts in 
 
 
 
  and not just in avoiding inclusion of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Thus if we remove 
 
 
 
  remains unchanged (Whenever 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is a sentry function on this set).



 
  is the frontier of c upon 
 
 
 
 .
(Figure)
A schematic outlook of outer sentineling functionality

With reference to the picture on the right, 
 
 
 
  is a candidate frontier of 
 
 
 
  against 
 
 
 
 . All points are in the gap between a 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . They avoid inclusion of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , provided that these points are not used by the latter for sentineling itself against other concepts. Vice versa we expect that 
 
 
 
  uses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as its own sentinels, 
 
 
 
  uses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  uses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  analogously. Point 
 
 
 
  is not allowed as a 
 
 
 
  sentry point since, like any diplomatic seat, it should be located outside all other concepts just to ensure that it is not occupied in case of invasion by 
 
 
 
 .
Definition of detail
The frontier size of the most expensive concept to be sentineled with the least efficient sentineling function, i.e. the quantity


 
 ,
is called detail of 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  spans also over sentry functions on subsets of 
 
 
 
  sentineling in this case the intersections of the concepts with these subsets. Actually, proper subsets of 
 
 
 
  may host sentineling tasks that prove harder than those emerging with 
 
 
 
  itself.
The detail 
 
 
 
  is a complexity measure of concept classes dual to the VC dimension

 
 . The former uses points to separate sets of concepts, the latter concepts for partitioning sets of points. In particular the following inequality holds 



See also Rademacher complexity for a recently introduced class complexity index.
Example: continuous spaces
Class C of circles in 
 
 
 
  has detail 
 
 
 
 , as shown in the picture on left below. Similarly, for the class of segments on 
 
 
 
 , as shown in the picture on right.



(Figure)
Two points 
 
 
 
  outside c (thick circle) are sufficient to prevent a larger circle not containing them from including it

  whose concepts are illustrated in the following scheme, where “
 
 
 
 ” denotes an element 
 
 
 
  belonging to
