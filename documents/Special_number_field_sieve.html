<h1>Special number field sieve</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, a branch of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>special number field sieve</strong> (SNFS) is a special-purpose <a href="integer_factorization" title="wikilink">integer factorization</a> algorithm. The <a href="general_number_field_sieve" title="wikilink">general number field sieve</a> (GNFS) was derived from it.</p>
<p>The special number field sieve is efficient for integers of the form <em>r</em><sup><em>e</em></sup> ± <em>s</em>, where <em>r</em> and <em>s</em> are small (for instance <a href="Mersenne_number" title="wikilink">Mersenne numbers</a>).</p>
<p><a href="Heuristic" title="wikilink">Heuristically</a>, its <a href="Computational_complexity_theory" title="wikilink">complexity</a> for factoring an integer <span class="LaTeX">$n$</span> is of the form:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\exp\left(\left(1+o(1)\right)\left(\tfrac{32}{9}\log n\right)^{1/3}\left(\log\log n\right)^{2/3}\right)=L_n\left[1/3,(32/9)^{1/3}\right]$$</span></p>
<p>in <a href="Big_O_notation" title="wikilink">O</a> and <a href="L-notation" title="wikilink">L-notations</a>.</p>
<p>The SNFS has been used extensively by NFSNet (a volunteer <a href="distributed_computing" title="wikilink">distributed computing</a> effort), <a href="http://escatter11.fullerton.edu/nfs/">NFS@Home</a> and others to factorise numbers of the <a href="Cunningham_project" title="wikilink">Cunningham project</a>; for some time the <a href="Integer_factorization_records" title="wikilink">records for integer factorisation</a> have been numbers factored by SNFS.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-method">Overview of method</h2>
<p>The SNFS is based on an idea similar to the much simpler <a href="rational_sieve" title="wikilink">rational sieve</a>; in particular, readers may find it helpful to read about the <a href="rational_sieve" title="wikilink">rational sieve</a> first, before tackling the SNFS.</p>
<p>The SNFS works as follows. Let <em>n</em> be the integer we want to factor. As in the <a href="rational_sieve" title="wikilink">rational sieve</a>, the SNFS can be broken into two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, find a large number of multiplicative relations among a <em>factor base</em> of elements of <a href="Modular_arithmetic#Ring_of_congruence_classes" title="wikilink"><strong>Z</strong>/<em>n</em><strong>Z</strong></a>, such that the number of multiplicative relations is larger than the number of elements in the factor base.</li>
<li>Second, multiply together subsets of these relations in such a way that all the exponents are even, resulting in congruences of the form <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>≡<em>b</em><sup>2</sup> (<a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">mod</a> <em>n</em>). These in turn immediately lead to factorizations of <em>n</em>: <em>n</em>=<a href="greatest_common_divisor" title="wikilink">gcd</a>(<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>,<em>n</em>)×gcd(<em>a</em>-<em>b</em>,<em>n</em>). If done right, it is almost certain that at least one such factorization will be nontrivial.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second step is identical to the case of the <a href="rational_sieve" title="wikilink">rational sieve</a>, and is a straightforward <a href="linear_algebra" title="wikilink">linear algebra</a> problem. The first step, however, is done in a different, more <a href="algorithmic_efficiency" title="wikilink">efficient</a> way than the rational sieve, by utilizing <a href="algebraic_number_field" title="wikilink">number fields</a>.</p>
<h2 id="details-of-method">Details of method</h2>
<p>Let <em>n</em> be the integer we want to factor. We pick an <a href="irreducible_polynomial" title="wikilink">irreducible polynomial</a> <em>f</em> with integer coefficients, and an integer <em>m</em> such that <em>f</em>(<em>m</em>)≡0 (<a href="modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">mod</a> <em>n</em>) (we will explain how they are chosen in the next section). Let <em>α</em> be a <a href="Root_of_a_function" title="wikilink">root</a> of <em>f</em>; we can then form the <a href="ring_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">ring</a> <strong><a href="integer" title="wikilink">Z</a></strong>[α]. There is a unique <a href="ring_homomorphism" title="wikilink">ring homomorphism</a> φ from <strong>Z</strong>[<em>α</em>] to <a href="Modular_arithmetic#Ring_of_congruence_classes" title="wikilink"><strong>Z</strong>/n<strong>Z</strong></a> that maps <em>α</em> to <em>m</em>. For simplicity, we'll assume that <strong>Z</strong>[<em>α</em>] is a <a href="unique_factorization_domain" title="wikilink">unique factorization domain</a>; the algorithm can be modified to work when it isn't, but then there are some additional complications.</p>
<p>Next, we set up two parallel <em>factor bases</em>, one in <strong>Z</strong>[<em>α</em>] and one in <strong>Z</strong>. The one in <strong>Z</strong>[<em>α</em>] consists of all the prime ideals in <strong>Z</strong>[<em>α</em>] whose norm is bounded by a chosen value <span class="LaTeX">$N_{\max}$</span>. The factor base in <strong>Z</strong>, as in the rational sieve case, consists of all prime integers up to some other bound.</p>
<p>We then search for <a href="relatively_prime" title="wikilink">relatively prime</a> pairs of integers (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a</em>+<em>bm</em> is <a href="smooth_number" title="wikilink">smooth</a> with respect to the factor base in <strong>Z</strong> (i.e., it is a product of elements in the factor base).</li>
<li><em>a</em>+<em>bα</em> is smooth with respect to the factor base in <strong>Z</strong>[<em>α</em>]; given how we chose the factor base, this is equivalent to the norm of <em>a</em>+<em>bα</em> being divisible only by primes less than <span class="LaTeX">$N_{\max}$</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pairs are found through a sieving process, analogous to the <a href="Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" title="wikilink">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>; this motivates the name "Number Field Sieve".</p>
<p>For each such pair, we can apply the ring homomorphism φ to the factorization of <em>a</em>+<em>bα</em>, and we can apply the canonical ring homomorphism from <strong>Z</strong> to <strong>Z</strong>/n<strong>Z</strong> to the factorization of <em>a</em>+<em>bm</em>. Setting these equal gives a multiplicative relation among elements of a bigger factor base in <strong>Z</strong>/n<strong>Z</strong>, and if we find enough pairs we can proceed to combine the relations and factor <em>n</em>, as described above.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-parameters">Choice of parameters</h2>
<p>Not every number is an appropriate choice for the SNFS: you need to know in advance a polynomial <em>f</em> of appropriate degree (the optimal degree is conjectured to be <span class="LaTeX">$\left(3 \frac{\log N}{\log \log N}\right) ^{1/3}$</span>, which is 4, 5, or 6 for the sizes of N currently feasible to factorise) with small coefficients, and a value <em>x</em> such that <span class="LaTeX">$f(x) \equiv 0 \pmod N$</span> where N is the number to factorise. There is an extra condition: <em>x</em> must satisfy <span class="LaTeX">$ax+b \equiv 0 \pmod N$</span> for a and b no bigger than <span class="LaTeX">$N^{1/d}$</span>.</p>
<p>One set of numbers for which such polynomials exist are the <span class="LaTeX">$a^b \pm 1$</span> numbers from the <a href="Cunningham_project" title="wikilink">Cunningham tables</a>; for example, when NFSNET factored 3^479+1, they used the polynomial x^6+3 with x=3^80, since (3^80)^6+3 = 3^480+3, and <span class="LaTeX">$3^{480}+3 \equiv 0 \pmod {3^{479}+1}$</span>.</p>
<p>Numbers defined by linear recurrences, such as the <a href="Fibonacci_number" title="wikilink">Fibonacci</a> and <a href="Lucas_number" title="wikilink">Lucas</a> numbers, also have SNFS polynomials, but these are a little more difficult to construct. For example, <span class="LaTeX">$F_{709}$</span> has polynomial <span class="LaTeX">$n^5 + 10n^3 + 10n^2 + 10n + 3$</span>, and the value of <em>x</em> satisfies <span class="LaTeX">$F_{142} x - F_{141} = 0$</span>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>If you already know some factors of a large SNFS-number, you can do the SNFS calculation modulo the remaining part; for the NFSNET example above, 3^479+1 = (4*158071*7167757*7759574882776161031) times a 197-digit composite number (the small factors were removed by <a href="elliptic_curve_method" title="wikilink">ECM</a>), and the SNFS was performed modulo the 197-digit number. The number of relations required by SNFS still depends on the size of the large number, but the individual calculations are quicker modulo the smaller number.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-of-algorithm">Limitations of algorithm</h2>
<p>This algorithm, as mentioned above, is very efficient for numbers of the form <em>r</em><sup><em>e</em></sup>±<em>s</em>, for <em>r</em> and <em>s</em> relatively small. It is also efficient for any integers which can be represented as a polynomial with small coefficients. This includes integers of the more general form <em>a<strong>'r<em><sup><em>e</em></sup>±</em>b</strong>'s</em><sup><em>f</em></sup>, and also for many integers whose binary representation has low Hamming weight. The reason for this is as follows: The Number Field Sieve performs sieving in two different fields. The first field is usually the rationals. The second is a higher degree field. The efficiency of the algorithm strongly depends on the norms of certain elements in these fields. When an integer can be represented as a polynomial with small coefficients, the norms that arise are much smaller than those that arise when an integer is represented by a general polynomial. The reason is that a general polynomial will have much larger coefficients, and the norms will be correspondingly larger. The algorithm attempts to factor these norms over a fixed set of prime numbers. When the norms are smaller, these numbers are more likely to factor.</p>
