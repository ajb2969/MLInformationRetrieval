   Alkylglycerone kinase      Alkylglycerone kinase   In enzymology , an alkylglycerone kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + O-alkylglycerone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + O-alkylglycerone phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and O-alkylglycerone , whereas its two products are ADP and O-alkylglycerone phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:O-alkylglycerone phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include alkyldihydroxyacetone kinase (phosphorylating) , and alkyldihydroxyacetone kinase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
