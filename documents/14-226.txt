Borwein integral

In mathematics, a Borwein integral is an integral involving products of sinc(ax), where the sinc function is given by sinc(x) = sin(x)/x for x not equal to 0, and sinc(0) = 1.12 These integrals are notorious for exhibiting apparent patterns that eventually break down. An example is as follows:



This pattern continues up to



However at the next step the obvious pattern fails:



In general similar integrals have value π/2 whenever the numbers 3, 5, ... are replaced by positive real numbers such that the sum of their reciprocals is less than 1. In the example above, 1/3 + 1/5 + ... + 1/13  1.
An example for a longer series,


 
  but


 
  is shown in 3 together with an intuitive mathematical explanation of the reason why the original and the extended series break down.
