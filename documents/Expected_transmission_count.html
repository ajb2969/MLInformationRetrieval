<h1>Expected transmission count</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The ETX metric, or <strong>expected transmission count</strong>, is a measure of the quality of a path between two nodes in a wireless packet data network. It is used extensively in <a href="mesh_networking" title="wikilink">mesh networking</a> <a href="algorithm" title="wikilink">algorithms</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Douglas S.J. De Couto was the first to describe ETX in his 2004 doctoral dissertation at MIT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Subsequently, it has been implemented in <a class="uri" href="RoofNet" title="wikilink">RoofNet</a>/<a class="uri" href="Meraki" title="wikilink">Meraki</a> and <a href="Optimized_Link_State_Routing_Protocol" title="wikilink">OLSR</a> mesh networking protocols, among others.</p>

<p>ETX is the number of expected transmissions of a packet necessary for it to be received without error at its destination. This number varies from one to infinity. An ETX of one indicates a perfect transmission medium, where an ETX of infinity represents a completely non-functional link. Note that ETX is an <em>expected</em> transmission count for a future event, as opposed to an actual count of a past event. It is hence a real number, and not an integer. For example, if it took 1898 transmissions to transfer 1024 packets without error, the ETX on the link is 1898/1024, or approximately 1.85. Due to varying characteristics of the transmission medium, the number may vary widely.</p>
<p>It is often useful to convert between ETX and the packet error probability <span class="LaTeX">$e_{pt}$</span>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$\mathrm{ETX} = \frac{1}{1 - e_{pt}}$</span></p>
