   Self-adjoint      Self-adjoint   In mathematics , an element x of a star-algebra is self-adjoint if     x  *   =  x       superscript  x    x    x^{*}=x   .  A collection C of elements of a star-algebra is self-adjoint if it is closed under the involution operation. For example, if     x  *   =  y       superscript  x    y    x^{*}=y   then since     y  *   =   x    *  *    =  x         superscript  y     superscript  x    absent          x     y^{*}=x^{**}=x   in a star-algebra, the set { x , y } is a self-adjoint set even though x and y need not be self-adjoint elements.  In functional analysis , a linear operator  A on a Hilbert space is called self-adjoint if it is equal to its own adjoint  A * and that the domain of A is the same as that of A *. See self-adjoint operator for a detailed discussion. If the Hilbert space is finite-dimensional and an orthonormal basis has been chosen, then the operator A is self-adjoint if and only if the matrix describing A with respect to this basis is Hermitian , i.e. if it is equal to its own conjugate transpose . Hermitian matrices are also called self-adjoint .  In a dagger category , a morphism    f   f   f   is called self-adjoint if    f  =   f  †       f   superscript  f  normal-†     f=f^{\dagger}   ; this is possible only for an endomorphism     f  :   A  →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  A     f\colon A\to A   .
