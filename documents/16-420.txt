Foias constant

In mathematical analysis, the Foias constant, is a number named after Ciprian Foias.
If x1 > 0 and



then the Foias constant is the unique real number α such that if x1 = α then the sequence diverges to ∞.1 Numerically, it is


 
  .
No closed form is known.
When x1 = α then we have the limit:



where "log" denotes the usual natural logarithm.
A fortuitous observation between the prime number theorem and this constant goes as follows,



where 
 
 
 
  is the prime-counting function.2
