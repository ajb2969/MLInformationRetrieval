Mittag-Leffler's theorem

In complex analysis, Mittag-Leffler's theorem concerns the existence of meromorphic functions with prescribed poles. It is sister to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, which asserts existence of holomorphic functions with prescribed zeros. It is named after GÃ¶sta Mittag-Leffler.
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be an open set in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a closed discrete subset. For each 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a polynomial in 
 
 
 
 . There is a meromorphic function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that for each 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is holomorphic at 
 
 
 
 . In particular, the principal part of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
One possible proof outline is as follows. Notice that if 
 
 
 
  is finite, it suffices to take 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is not finite, consider the finite sum 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a finite subset of 
 
 
 
 . While the 
 
 
 
  may not converge as F approaches E, one may subtract well-chosen rational functions with poles outside of D (provided by Runge's theorem) without changing the principal parts of the 
 
 
 
  and in such a way that convergence is guaranteed.
Example
Suppose that we desire a meromorphic function with simple poles of residue 1 at all positive integers. With notation as above, letting



and 
 
 
 
 , Mittag-Leffler's theorem asserts (non-constructively) the existence of a meromorphic function 
 
 
 
  with principal part 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  for each positive integer 
 
 
 
 . This 
 
 
 
  has the desired properties. More constructively we can let


 
 .
This series converges normally on 
 
 
 
  (as can be shown using the M-test) to a meromorphic function with the desired properties.
