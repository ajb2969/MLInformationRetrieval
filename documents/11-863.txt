   Aspartyltransferase      Aspartyltransferase   In enzymology , an aspartyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-asparagine + hydroxylamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NH 3 + L-aspartylhydroxamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-asparagine and hydroxylamine , whereas its two products are NH 3 and L-aspartylhydroxamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-asparagine:hydroxylamine gamma-aspartyltransferase . Other names in common use include beta-aspartyl transferase , and aspartotransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
