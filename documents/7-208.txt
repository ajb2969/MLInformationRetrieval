Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient

The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is used to assess the predictive power of hydrological models. It is defined as:



where Qo is the mean of observed discharges, and Qm is modeled discharge. Qot is observed discharge at time t.1
Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies can range from −∞ to 1. An efficiency of 1 (E = 1) corresponds to a perfect match of modeled discharge to the observed data. An efficiency of 0 (E = 0) indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data, whereas an efficiency less than zero (E Moriasi, D. N.; Arnold, J. G.; Van Liew, M.
