   Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient      Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient   The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is used to assess the predictive power of hydrological models. It is defined as:      E  =   1  -     ∑   t  =  1   T     (    Q  o  t   -   Q  m  t    )   2      ∑   t  =  1   T     (    Q  o  t   -    Q  o   ¯    )   2          E    1      superscript   subscript     t  1    T    superscript     superscript   subscript  Q  o   t    superscript   subscript  Q  m   t    2      superscript   subscript     t  1    T    superscript     superscript   subscript  Q  o   t    normal-¯   subscript  Q  o     2        E=1-\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}\left(Q_{o}^{t}-Q_{m}^{t}\right)^{2}}{\sum_{t=1}^{T}%
 \left(Q_{o}^{t}-\overline{Q_{o}}\right)^{2}}     where Q o is the mean of observed discharges, and Q m is modeled discharge. Q o t is observed discharge at time t . 1  Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies can range from −∞ to 1. An efficiency of 1 ( E = 1) corresponds to a perfect match of modeled discharge to the observed data. An efficiency of 0 ( E = 0) indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data, whereas an efficiency less than zero ( E Moriasi, D. N.; Arnold, J. G.; Van Liew, M.
