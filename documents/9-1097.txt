==Summary== Using 
 
 
 
  from Table 1 data, the chart shows 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  (Age) ranging from 20 to 90 years and 
 
 
 
  ranging from 5 to 25 future years.
These curves show the probability that someone at (who has reached) the age of 
 
 
 
  will live at least 
 
 
 
  years and can be used to discuss annuity issues from the boomer viewpoint where an increase in group size will have major effects.
For those in the age range covered by the chart, the "5 yr" curve indicates the group that will reach beyond the life expectancy. This curve represents the need for support that covers longevity requirements.
The "20 yr" and "25 yr" curves indicate the continuing diminishing of the life expectancy value as "age" increases. The differences between the curves are very pronounced starting around the age of 50 to 55 and ought to be used for planning based upon expectation models.
The "10 yr" and "15 yr" curves can be thought of as the trajectory that is followed by the life expectancy curve related to those along the median which indicates that the age of 90 is not out of the question.
