These curves show the probability that someone at (who has reached) the age of   x   x   x   will live at least   t   t   t   years and can be used to discuss annuity issues from the boomer viewpoint where an increase in group size will have major effects.  For those in the age range covered by the chart, the "5 yr" curve indicates the group that will reach beyond the life expectancy . This curve represents the need for support that covers longevity requirements.  The "20 yr" and "25 yr" curves indicate the continuing diminishing of the life expectancy value as "age" increases. The differences between the curves are very pronounced starting around the age of 50 to 55 and ought to be used for planning based upon expectation models.  The "10 yr" and "15 yr" curves can be thought of as the trajectory that is followed by the life expectancy curve related to those along the median which indicates that the age of 90 is not out of the question.
