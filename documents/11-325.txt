Quadratic residue code

A quadratic residue code ia
There is a quadratic residue code of length 
 
 
 
  over the finite field 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are primes, 
 
 
 
  is odd, and 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 
 . Its generator polynomial as a cyclic code is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the set of quadratic residues of 
 
 
 
  in the set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a primitive 
 
 
 
 th root of unity in some finite extension field of 
 
 
 
 . The condition that 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue of 
 
 
 
  ensures that the coefficients of 
 
 
 
  lie in 
 
 
 
 . The dimension of the code is 
 
 
 
 . Replacing 
 
 
 
  by another primitive 
 
 
 
 -th root of unity 
 
 
 
  either results in the same code or an equivalent code, according to whether or not 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue of 
 
 
 
 .
An alternative construction avoids roots of unity. Define


 
  for a suitable 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  choose 
 
 
 
  to ensure that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is odd, choose 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  according to whether 
 
 
 
  is congruent to 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  modulo 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  also generates a quadratic residue code; more precisely the ideal of 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the quadratic residue code.
The minimum weight of a quadratic residue code of length 
 
 
 
  is greater than 
 
 
 
 ; this is the square root bound.
Adding an overall parity-check digit to a quadratic residue code gives an extended quadratic residue code. When 
 
 
 
  (mod 
 
 
 
 ) an extended quadratic residue code is self-dual; otherwise it is equivalent but not equal to its dual. By the Gleasonâ€“Prange theorem (named for Andrew Gleason and Eugene Prange), the automorphism group of an extended quadratic residue code has a subgroup which is isomorphic to either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
Examples of quadratic residue codes include the 
 
 
Hamming code over 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
binary Golay code over 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
ternary Golay code over 
 
 
 
 .
