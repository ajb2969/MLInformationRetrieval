Purnell equation

The Purnell equation is an equation used in analytical chemistry to calculate the resolution Rs between two peaks in a chromatogram:123


where


Rs is the resolution between the two peaks
 





N2 is the plate number of the second peak
 





α is the separation factor between the two peaks
 





k '2 is the retention factor of the second peak.
 



The higher the resolution, the better the separation.
