   Purnell equation      Purnell equation   The Purnell equation is an equation used in analytical chemistry to calculate the resolution R s between two peaks in a chromatogram : 1 2 3      R  s   =      N  2    4    (    α  -  1   α   )    (    k  2  ′    1  +   k  2  ′     )         subscript  R  s          subscript  N  2    4       α  1   α      subscript   superscript  k  normal-′   2     1   subscript   superscript  k  normal-′   2        R_{s}=\frac{\sqrt{N_{2}}}{4}\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}\right)\left(\frac{k^%
 {\prime}_{2}}{1+k^{\prime}_{2}}\right)     where    R s is the resolution between the two peaks       N 2 is the plate number of the second peak       α is the separation factor between the two peaks       k ' 2 is the retention factor of the second peak.     The higher the resolution, the better the separation.  References  "  Category:Chromatography  Category:Equations     Miller, J.
