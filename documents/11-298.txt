   Effective molarity      Effective molarity  In [[chemistry]], the '''Effective Molarity''' (denoted ''EM'') {{cite book|last=Kirby, AJ in|title=Advances in Physical Organic Chemistry| year=1980|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=9780120335176|pages=183–278}} is defined as the ratio between the first-order rate constant of an intramolecular reaction and the second-order rate constant of the corresponding intermolecular reaction ( Kinetic Effective Molarity ) 1 2 or the ratio between the equilibrium constant of an intramolecular reaction and the equilibrium constant of the corresponding intermolecular reaction ( Thermodynamic Effective Molarity ). 3 4      E   M   k  i  n  e  t  i  c     =    k   i  n  t  r  a  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r     k   i  n  t  e  r  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r           E   subscript  M    k  i  n  e  t  i  c        subscript  k    i  n  t  r  a  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r     subscript  k    i  n  t  e  r  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r       EM_{kinetic}={k_{intramolecular}\over k_{intermolecular}}        E   M   t  h  e  r  m  o     =    K   i  n  t  r  a  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r     K   i  n  t  e  r  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r           E   subscript  M    t  h  e  r  m  o        subscript  K    i  n  t  r  a  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r     subscript  K    i  n  t  e  r  m  o  l  e  c  u  l  a  r       EM_{thermo}={K_{intramolecular}\over K_{intermolecular}}     EM has the dimension of concentration. High EM values always indicate greater ease of intramolecular processes over the corresponding intermolecular ones. Effective molarities can be used to get a deeper understanding of the effects of intramolecularity on reaction courses. 5 In last decades, the frequency of use of effective molarity in scientific literature has shown a marked decrease, because this formalism is being progressively replaced by more important physical quantities .
