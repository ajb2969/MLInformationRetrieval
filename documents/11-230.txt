   Oleate hydratase      Oleate hydratase   In enzymology , an oleate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-10-hydroxystearate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oleate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (R)-10-hydroxystearate , and two products , oleate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-10-hydroxystearate 10-hydro-lyase (oleate-forming) . This enzyme is also called (R)-10-hydroxystearate 10-hydro-lyase .
