Oleate hydratase

In enzymology, an oleate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-10-hydroxystearate 
 
 
 
  oleate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (R)-10-hydroxystearate, and two products, oleate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-10-hydroxystearate 10-hydro-lyase (oleate-forming). This enzyme is also called (R)-10-hydroxystearate 10-hydro-lyase.
