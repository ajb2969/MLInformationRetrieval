(+)-Camphor 6-endo-hydroxylase

(+)-Camphor 6-endo-hydroxylase (, P450camr) is an enzyme with system name (+)-camphor,reduced putidaredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-endo-hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(+)-camphor + reduced putidaredoxin + O2

 
  (+)-6-endo-hydroxycamphor + oxidized putidaredoxin + H2O
 

Camphor 6-endo-hydroxylase is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from the bacterium Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784.
