Arthur Amos Noyes

Arthur Amos Noyes (1866–1936) was a U.S. chemist and educator. He served as the acting president of MIT between 1907 and 1909. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald. Roscoe Gilkey Dickinson was one of his famous students. Noyes served as Professor of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology from 1919 to 1936. He was a major influence on the educational philosophy and the core curriculum of Caltech. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, between 1921 and 1927.
Noyes–Whitney equation
Along with Willis Rodney Whitney, he formulated the Noyes–Whitney equation in 1897, which relates the rate of dissolution of solids to the properties of the solid and the dissolution medium. It is an important equation in pharmaceutical science. The relation is given by:



Where:



 
  is the rate of dissolution.
A is the surface area of the solid.
C is the concentration of the solid in the bulk dissolution medium.


 
  is the concentration of the solid in the diffusion layer surrounding the solid.
D is the diffusion coefficient.
L is the diffusion layer thickness.
