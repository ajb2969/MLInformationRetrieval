Tyrosine phenol-lyase

In enzymology, a tyrosine phenol-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-tyrosine + H2O 
 
 
 
  phenol + pyruvate + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tyrosine and H2O, whereas its 3 products are phenol, pyruvate, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically in the "catch-all" class of carbon-carbon lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tyrosine phenol-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include beta-tyrosinase, and L-tyrosine phenol-lyase (deaminating). This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and nitrogen metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
Structural studies
