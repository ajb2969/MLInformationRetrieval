   Hyperoperation      Hyperoperation   In mathematics , the hyperoperation sequence is an infinite sequence of arithmetic operations (called hyperoperations ) 1 2 3 that starts with the unary operation of successor ( n = 0), then continues with the binary operations of addition ( n = 1), multiplication ( n = 2), and exponentiation ( n = 3), after which the sequence proceeds with further binary operations extending beyond exponentiation, using right-associativity . For the operations beyond exponentiation, the n th member of this sequence is named by Reuben Goodstein after the Greek prefix of n suffixed with -ation (such as tetration ( n = 4), pentation ( n = 5), hexation ( n = 6), etc.) 4 and can be written as using n − 2 arrows in Knuth's up-arrow notation (when n ≥ 3). Each hyperoperation may be understood recursively in terms of the previous one by:         a   ↑  m   b     =      a   ↑   m  -  1     (  a   ↑   m  -  1     (  a   ↑   m  -  1     (  …   (  a   ↑   m  -  1     (  a   ↑   m  -  1    a  )   )   …  )   )   )    ⏟              b  copies of  a           superscript  normal-↑  m   a  b     normal-⏟   fragments  a   superscript  normal-↑    m  1     fragments  normal-(  a   superscript  normal-↑    m  1     fragments  normal-(  a   superscript  normal-↑    m  1     fragments  normal-(  normal-…   fragments  normal-(  a   superscript  normal-↑    m  1     fragments  normal-(  a   superscript  normal-↑    m  1    a  normal-)   normal-)   normal-…  normal-)   normal-)   normal-)       absent  absent    b  copies of  a      \begin{matrix}a\uparrow^{m}b&=&\underbrace{a\uparrow^{m-1}(a\uparrow^{m-1}(a%
 \uparrow^{m-1}(...(a\uparrow^{m-1}(a\uparrow^{m-1}a))...)))}\\
 &&b\mbox{ copies of }a\end{matrix}   ( m ≥ 0)  It may also be defined according to the recursion rule part of the definition, as in Knuth's up-arrow version of the Ackermann function :      a   ↑  m   b  =  a   ↑   m  -  1     (  a   ↑  m    (  b  -  1  )   )      fragments  a   superscript  normal-↑  m   b   a   superscript  normal-↑    m  1     fragments  normal-(  a   superscript  normal-↑  m    fragments  normal-(  b   1  normal-)   normal-)     a\uparrow^{m}b=a\uparrow^{m-1}(a\uparrow^{m}(b-1))   ( m ≥ -1)  This can be used to easily show numbers much larger than those which scientific notation can, such as Skewes' number and googolplexplex , but there are some numbers which even they cannot easily show, such as Graham's number and TREE(3) .  This recursion rule is common to many variants of hyperoperations (see below ).  Definition  The hyperoperation sequence is the sequence of binary operations       H  n    (  a  ,  b  )     (   ℕ  0   )   3    →   ℕ  0      normal-→     subscript  H  n    a  b    superscript   subscript  ℕ  0   3     subscript  ℕ  0     H_{n}(a,b)(\mathbb{N}_{0})^{3}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}_{0}\,\!   , defined recursively as follows:        H  n    (  a  ,  b  )    =   {      b  +  1       if  n   =  0       a       if  n   =  1   ,   b  =  0        0       if  n   =  2   ,   b  =  0        1       if  n   ≥  3   ,   b  =  0          H   n  -  1     (  a  ,    H  n    (  a  ,   b  -  1   )    )      otherwise             subscript  H  n    a  b     cases    b  1       if  n   0   a   formulae-sequence      if  n   1     b  0    0   formulae-sequence      if  n   2     b  0    1   formulae-sequence      if  n   3     b  0       subscript  H    n  1     a     subscript  H  n    a    b  1       otherwise     H_{n}(a,b)=\begin{cases}b+1&\text{if }n=0\\
 a&\text{if }n=1,b=0\\
 0&\text{if }n=2,b=0\\
 1&\text{if }n\geq 3,b=0\\
 H_{n-1}(a,H_{n}(a,b-1))&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\,\!     (Note that for n = 0, the binary operation essentially reduces to a unary operation ( successor function ) by ignoring the first argument.)  For n = 0, 1, 2, 3, this definition reproduces the basic arithmetic operations of successor (which is a unary operation), addition , multiplication , and exponentiation , respectively, as         H  0    (  a  ,  b  )    =   b  +  1    ,         subscript  H  0    a  b      b  1     H_{0}(a,b)=b+1\,\!,            H  1    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  +  b    ,         subscript  H  1    a  b      a  b     H_{1}(a,b)=a+b\,\!,            H  2    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  ⋅  b    ,         subscript  H  2    a  b     normal-⋅  a  b     H_{2}(a,b)=a\cdot b\,\!,            H  3    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  b    ,         subscript  H  3    a  b     superscript  a  b     H_{3}(a,b)=a^{b}\,\!,   and for n ≥ 4 it extends these basic operations beyond exponentiation to what can be written in Knuth's up-arrow notation as       H  4    (  a  ,  b  )   =  a  ↑  ↑  b  ,     fragments   subscript  H  4    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)    a  normal-↑  normal-↑  b  normal-,    H_{4}(a,b)=a\uparrow\uparrow{b}\,\!,          H  5    (  a  ,  b  )   =  a  ↑  ↑  ↑  b  ,     fragments   subscript  H  5    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)    a  normal-↑  normal-↑  normal-↑  b  normal-,    H_{5}(a,b)=a\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow{b}\,\!,      ...         H  n    (  a  ,  b  )    =  a   ↑   n  -  2     b  for  n   ≥  3   ,           subscript  H  n    a  b    a     superscript  normal-↑    n  2        b  for  n        3     H_{n}(a,b)=a\uparrow^{n-2}b\text{ for }n\geq 3\,\!,     ...   Knuth's notation could be extended to negative indices ≥ -2 in such a way as to agree with the entire hyperoperation sequence, except for the lag in the indexing:        H  n    (  a  ,  b  )    =  a   ↑   n  -  2     b  for  n   ≥  0.           subscript  H  n    a  b    a     superscript  normal-↑    n  2        b  for  n        0.     H_{n}(a,b)=a\uparrow^{n-2}b\text{ for }n\geq 0.\,\!     The hyperoperations can thus be seen as an answer to the question "what's next" in the sequence : successor , addition , multiplication , exponentiation , and so on. Noting that        a  +  b   =    (   a  +   (   b  -  1   )    )   +  1         a  b       a    b  1    1     a+b=(a+(b-1))+1          a  ⋅  b   =   a  +   (   a  ⋅   (   b  -  1   )    )         normal-⋅  a  b     a   normal-⋅  a    b  1       a\cdot b=a+(a\cdot(b-1))          a  b   =   a  ⋅   (   a   (   b  -  1   )    )         superscript  a  b    normal-⋅  a   superscript  a    b  1       a^{b}=a\cdot(a^{(b-1)})         a  ↑  ↑  b  =   a   a  ↑    ↑   (   b  -  1   )         fragments  a  normal-↑  normal-↑  b    superscript  a   a  normal-↑   normal-↑  absent    b  1        a\uparrow\uparrow b=a^{a\uparrow\uparrow{(b-1)}}      the relationship between basic arithmetic operations is illustrated, allowing the higher operations to be defined naturally as above. The parameters of the hyperoperation hierarchy are sometimes referred to by their analogous exponentiation term; 5 so a is the base , b is the exponent (or hyperexponent ), 6 and n is the rank (or grade ). 7  In common terms, the hyperoperations are ways of compounding numbers that increase in growth based on the iteration of the previous hyperoperation. The concepts of successor, addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all hyperoperations; the successor operation (producing x +1 from x ) is the most primitive, the addition operator specifies the number of times 1 is to be added to itself to produce a final value, multiplication specifies the number of times a number is to be added to itself, and exponentiation refers to the number of times a number is to be multiplied by itself.

About 12 years later, Wilhelm Ackermann defined the function    ϕ   (  a  ,  b  ,  n  )       ϕ   a  b  n     \phi(a,b,n)\,\!    13 which somewhat resembles the hyperoperation sequence.  In his 1947 paper, 14  R. L. Goodstein introduced the specific sequence of operations that are now called hyperoperations , and also suggested the Greek names tetration , pentation, etc., for the extended operations beyond exponentiation (because they correspond to the indices 4, 5, etc.). As a three-argument function, e.g.,     G   (  n  ,  a  ,  b  )    =    H  n    (  a  ,  b  )          G   n  a  b       subscript  H  n    a  b      G(n,a,b)=H_{n}(a,b)   , the hyperoperation sequence as a whole is seen to be a version of the original Ackermann function     ϕ   (  a  ,  b  ,  n  )       ϕ   a  b  n     \phi(a,b,n)\,\!   — recursive but not primitive recursive — as modified by Goodstein to incorporate the primitive successor function together with the other three basic operations of arithmetic ( addition , multiplication , exponentiation ), and to make a more seamless extension of these beyond exponentiation.  The original three-argument Ackermann function    ϕ   ϕ   \phi\,\!   uses the same recursion rule as does Goodstein's version of it (i.e., the hyperoperation sequence), but differs from it in two ways. First,    ϕ   (  a  ,  b  ,  n  )       ϕ   a  b  n     \phi(a,b,n)\,\!   defines a sequence of operations starting from addition ( n = 0) rather than the successor function , then multiplication ( n = 1), exponentiation ( n = 2), etc. Secondly, the initial conditions for   ϕ   ϕ   \phi\,\!   result in    ϕ   (  a  ,  b  ,  3  )   =  a  ↑  ↑   (  b  +  1  )      fragments  ϕ   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-,  3  normal-)    a  normal-↑  normal-↑   fragments  normal-(  b   1  normal-)     \phi(a,b,3)=a\uparrow\uparrow(b+1)\,\!   , thus differing from the hyperoperations beyond exponentiation. 15 16 17 The significance of the b + 1 in the previous expression is that    ϕ   (  a  ,  b  ,  3  )       ϕ   a  b  3     \phi(a,b,3)\,\!   =    a   a   ⋅   ⋅   ⋅  a         superscript  a   superscript  a   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  a        a^{a^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{a}}}}}\,\!   , where b counts the number of operators (exponentiations), rather than counting the number of operands ("a"s) as does the b in    a  ↑  ↑  b     fragments  a  normal-↑  normal-↑  b    a\uparrow\uparrow b\,\!   , and so on for the higher-level operations.

Also he assigned addition to n = 0, multiplication to n = 1 and exponentiation to n = 2, so the initial conditions produce very different operations for tetration and beyond.      n   Operation   Comment       0         F  0    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  +  b          subscript  F  0    a  b      a  b     F_{0}(a,b)=a+b         1         F  1    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  ⋅  b          subscript  F  1    a  b     normal-⋅  a  b     F_{1}(a,b)=a\cdot b         2         F  2    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  b          subscript  F  2    a  b     superscript  a  b     F_{2}(a,b)=a^{b}         3        F  3    (  a  ,  b  )   =  a  ↑  ↑   (  b  +  1  )      fragments   subscript  F  3    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)    a  normal-↑  normal-↑   fragments  normal-(  b   1  normal-)     F_{3}(a,b)=a\uparrow\uparrow(b+1)      An offset form of tetration . The iteration of this operation is different than the iteration of tetration.     4        F  4    (  a  ,  b  )   =    (  x  ↦  a  ↑  ↑   (  x  +  1  )   )   b    (  a  )      fragments   subscript  F  4    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)     superscript   fragments  normal-(  x  maps-to  a  normal-↑  normal-↑   fragments  normal-(  x   1  normal-)   normal-)   b    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-)     F_{4}(a,b)=(x\mapsto a\uparrow\uparrow(x+1))^{b}(a)      Not to be confused with pentation .     Another initial condition that has been used is     A   (  0  ,  b  )    =    2  b   +  1         A   0  b        2  b   1     A(0,b)=2b+1   (where the base is constant    a  =  2      a  2    a=2   ), due to Rózsa Péter, which does not form a hyperoperation hierarchy.  Variant starting from 0  In 1984, C. W. Clenshaw and F. W. J. Olver began the discussion of using hyperoperations to prevent computer floating-point overflows. 25 Since then, many other authors 26 27 28 have renewed interest in the application of hyperoperations to floating-point representation. (Since H n ( a , b ) are all defined for b = -1) While discussing tetration , Clenshaw et al. assumed the initial condition      F  n    (  a  ,  0  )    =  0         subscript  F  n    a  0    0    F_{n}(a,0)=0   , which makes yet another hyperoperation hierarchy. Just like in the previous variant, the fourth operation is very similar to tetration , but offset by one.      n   Operation   Comment       0         F  0    (  a  ,  b  )    =   b  +  1          subscript  F  0    a  b      b  1     F_{0}(a,b)=b+1         1         F  1    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  +  b          subscript  F  1    a  b      a  b     F_{1}(a,b)=a+b         2         F  2    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  ⋅  b   =   e    ln   (  a  )    +   ln   (  b  )               subscript  F  2    a  b     normal-⋅  a  b         superscript  e      a     b        F_{2}(a,b)=a\cdot b=e^{\ln(a)+\ln(b)}         3         F  3    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  b          subscript  F  3    a  b     superscript  a  b     F_{3}(a,b)=a^{b}         4        F  4    (  a  ,  b  )   =  a  ↑  ↑   (  b  -  1  )      fragments   subscript  F  4    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)    a  normal-↑  normal-↑   fragments  normal-(  b   1  normal-)     F_{4}(a,b)=a\uparrow\uparrow(b-1)      An offset form of tetration . The iteration of this operation is much different than the iteration of tetration .     5        F  5    (  a  ,  b  )   =    (  x  ↦  a  ↑  ↑   (  x  -  1  )   )   b    (  0  )   =  0  if  a  >  0     fragments   subscript  F  5    fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  b  normal-)     superscript   fragments  normal-(  x  maps-to  a  normal-↑  normal-↑   fragments  normal-(  x   1  normal-)   normal-)   b    fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)    0  if  a   0    F_{5}(a,b)=(x\mapsto a\uparrow\uparrow(x-1))^{b}(0)=0\text{ if }a>0      Not to be confused with pentation .     Lower hyperoperations  An alternative for these hyperoperations is obtained by evaluation from left to right. Since        a  +  b   =    (   a  +   (   b  -  1   )    )   +  1         a  b       a    b  1    1     a+b=(a+(b-1))+1          a  ⋅  b   =    (   a  ⋅   (   b  -  1   )    )   +  a        normal-⋅  a  b      normal-⋅  a    b  1    a     a\cdot b=(a\cdot(b-1))+a          a  b   =    (   a   (   b  -  1   )    )   ⋅  a        superscript  a  b    normal-⋅   superscript  a    b  1    a     a^{b}=(a^{(b-1)})\cdot a      define (with ° or subscript)        a   (   n  +  1   )    b   =     (    a   (   n  +  1   )     (   b  -  1   )    )    (  n  )    a          subscript  a    n  1    b      subscript     subscript  a    n  1      b  1    n   a     a_{(n+1)}b=(a_{(n+1)}(b-1))_{(n)}a   with          a   (  1  )    b     =     a  +  b          a   (  2  )    0     =    0         a   (  n  )    1     =    a      for  n   >  2            subscript  a  1   b      a  b    missing-subexpression        subscript  a  2   0    0   missing-subexpression        subscript  a  n   1    a      for  n   2      \begin{array}[]{lcll}a_{(1)}b&=&a+b\\

Similar to tetration .     Commutative hyperoperations  Commutative hyperoperations were considered by Albert Bennett as early as 1914, 34 which is possibly the earliest remark about any hyperoperation sequence. Commutative hyperoperations are defined by the recursion rule        F   n  +  1     (  a  ,  b  )    =   exp   (    F  n    (   ln   (  a  )    ,   ln   (  b  )    )    )           subscript  F    n  1     a  b         subscript  F  n      a     b        F_{n+1}(a,b)=\exp(F_{n}(\ln(a),\ln(b)))   which is symmetric in a and b , meaning all hyperoperations are commutative. This sequence does not contain exponentiation , and so does not form a hyperoperation hierarchy.      n   Operation   Comment       0         F  0    (  a  ,  b  )    =   ln   (    e  a   +   e  b    )           subscript  F  0    a  b         superscript  e  a    superscript  e  b       F_{0}(a,b)=\ln(e^{a}+e^{b})         1         F  1    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  +  b          subscript  F  1    a  b      a  b     F_{1}(a,b)=a+b         2         F  2    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a  ⋅  b   =   e    ln   (  a  )    +   ln   (  b  )               subscript  F  2    a  b     normal-⋅  a  b         superscript  e      a     b        F_{2}(a,b)=a\cdot b=e^{\ln(a)+\ln(b)}      This is due to the properties of the logarithm .     3         F  3    (  a  ,  b  )    =   a   ln   (  b  )     =   e    ln   (  a  )     ln   (  b  )               subscript  F  3    a  b     superscript  a    b          superscript  e      a     b        F_{3}(a,b)=a^{\ln(b)}=e^{\ln(a)\ln(b)}      A commutative form of exponentiation .     4         F  4    (  a  ,  b  )    =   e   e    ln   (   ln   (  a  )    )     ln   (   ln   (  b  )    )              subscript  F  4    a  b     superscript  e   superscript  e        a        b         F_{4}(a,b)=e^{e^{\ln(\ln(a))\ln(\ln(b))}}      Not to be confused with tetration .
