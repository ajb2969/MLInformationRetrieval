3,5,7-Trioxododecanoyl-CoA synthase

3,5,7-Trioxododecanoyl-CoA synthase (, TKS) is an enzyme with system name malonyl-CoA:hexanoyl-CoA malonyltransferase (3,5,7-trioxododecanoyl-CoA-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3 malonyl-CoA + hexanoyl-CoA

 
  3 CoA + 3,5,7-trioxododecanoyl-CoA + 3 CO2


This polyketide synthase catalyse the first step in the cannabinoids biosynthetic pathway of the plant Cannabis sativa.
