   Sulfinoalanine decarboxylase      Sulfinoalanine decarboxylase   In enzymology , a sulfinoalanine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-sulfino-L-alanine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hypotaurine + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-sulfino-L-alanine , and two products , hypotaurine and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-sulfino-L-alanine carboxy-lyase (hypotaurine-forming) . Other names in common use include cysteine-sulfinate decarboxylase , L-cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase , cysteine-sulfinate decarboxylase , CADCase/CSADCase , CSAD , cysteic decarboxylase , cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase , cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase , sulfoalanine decarboxylase , and 3-sulfino-L-alanine carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
