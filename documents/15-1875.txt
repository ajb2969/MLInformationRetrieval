Chitin disaccharide deacetylase

Chitin disaccharide deacetylase (, chitobiose amidohydolase, COD, chitin oligosaccharide deacetylase, chitin oligosaccharide amidohydolase) is an enzyme with system name 2-(acetylamino)-4-O-(2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose acetylhydrolase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-(acetylamino)-4-O-[2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose + H2O 
 
 
 
  2-(acetylamino)-4-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose + acetate


Chitin oligosaccharide deacetylase is present in Vibrio strains.
