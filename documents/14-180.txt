   Static forces and virtual-particle exchange      Static forces and virtual-particle exchange   Static force fields are fields, such as a simple electric, magnetic or gravitational fields, that exist without excitations. The most common approximation method that physicists use for scattering calculations can be interpreted as static forces arising from the interactions between two bodies mediated by virtual particles , particles that exist for only a short time determined by the uncertainty principle . The virtual particles, also known as force carriers , are bosons , with different bosons associated with each force. 1  The virtual-particle description of static forces is capable of identifying the spatial form of the forces, such as the inverse-square behavior in Newton's law of universal gravitation and in Coulomb's law . It is also able to predict whether the forces are attractive or repulsive for like bodies.  The path integral formulation is the natural language for describing force carriers. This article uses the path integral formulation to describe the force carriers for spin 0, 1, and 2 fields. Pions , photons , and gravitons fall into these respective categories.  There are limits to the validity of the virtual particle picture. The virtual-particle formulation is derived from a method known as perturbation theory which is an approximation assuming interactions are not too strong, and was intended for scattering problems, not bound states such as atoms. For the strong force binding quarks into nucleons at low energies, perturbation theory has never been shown to yield results in accord with experiments, 2 thus, the validity of the "force-mediating particle" picture is questionable. Similarly, for bound states the method fails. 3 In these cases the physical interpretation must be re-examined. As an example, the calculations of atomic structure in atomic physics or of molecular structure in quantum chemistry could not easily be repeated, if at all, using the "force-mediating particle" picture.  The "force-mediating particle" picture (FMPP) is used because the classical two-body interaction (Coulomb's law for example), depending on six spatial dimensions, is incompatible with the Lorentz invariance of Dirac's equation. The use of the FMPP is unnecessary in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, and Coulomb's law is used as given in atomic physics and quantum chemistry to calculate both bound and scattering states. A nonperturbative relativistic quantum theory, in which Lorentz invariance is preserved, is achievable by evaluating Coulomb's law as a 4-space interaction using the 3-space position vector of a reference electron obeying Dirac's equation and the quantum trajectory of a second electron which depends only on the scaled time ct. The quantum trajectory of each electron in an ensemble is inferred from the Dirac current for each electron by setting it equal to a velocity field times a quantum density, calculating a position field from the time integral of the velocity field, and finally calculating a quantum trajectory from the expectation value of the position field. The quantum trajectories are of course spin dependent, and the theory can be validated by checking that Pauli's Exclusion Principle is obeyed for a collection of fermions.  Classical forces  The force exerted by one mass on another and the force exerted by one charge on another are strikingly similar. Both fall off as the square of the distance between the bodies. Both are proportional to the product of properties of the bodies, mass in the case of gravitation and charge in the case of electrostatics.  They also have a striking difference. Two masses attract each other, while two like charges repel each other.  In both cases, the bodies appear to act on each other over a distance. The concept of field was invented to mediate the interaction among bodies thus eliminating the need for action at a distance . The gravitational force is mediated by the gravitational field and the Coulomb force is mediated by the electromagnetic field .  Gravitational force  The gravitational force on a mass   m   m   m   exerted by another mass   M   M   M   is       𝐅  =   -   G     m  M    r  2      𝐫  ^     =   m  𝐠   (  𝐫  )     ,        𝐅      G      m  M    superscript  r  2     normal-^  𝐫            m  𝐠  𝐫      \mathbf{F}=-G{mM\over{r}^{2}}\,\mathbf{\hat{r}}=m\mathbf{g}\left(\mathbf{r}%
 \right),   where G is the gravitational constant , r is the distance between the masses, and    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \mathbf{\hat{r}}   is the unit vector from mass   M   M   M   to mass   m   m   m   .  The force can also be written       𝐅  =   m  𝐠   (  𝐫  )     ,      𝐅    m  𝐠  𝐫     \mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{g}\left(\mathbf{r}\right),     where    𝐠   (  𝐫  )       𝐠  𝐫    \mathbf{g}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)   is the gravitational field described by the field equation        ∇  ⋅  𝐠   =   -   4  π  G   ρ  m      ,       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐠       4  π  G   subscript  ρ  m       \nabla\cdot\mathbf{g}=-4\pi G\rho_{m},   where    ρ  m     subscript  ρ  m    \rho_{m}   is the mass density at each point in space.  Coulomb force  The electrostatic Coulomb force on a charge   q   q   q   exerted by a charge   Q   Q   Q   is ( SI units )       𝐅  =    1   4  π   ε  0       q  Q    r  2     𝐫  ^     ,      𝐅      1    4  π   subscript  ε  0         q  Q    superscript  r  2     normal-^  𝐫      \mathbf{F}={1\over 4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}{qQ\over r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}},     where    ε  0     subscript  ε  0    \varepsilon_{0}   is the vacuum permittivity ,   r   r   r   is the separation of the two charges, and    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \mathbf{\hat{r}}   is a unit vector in the direction from charge   Q   Q   Q   to charge   q   q   q   .  The Coulomb force can also be written in terms of an electrostatic field :       𝐅  =   q  𝐄   (  𝐫  )     ,      𝐅    q  𝐄  𝐫     \mathbf{F}=q\mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{r}\right),     where        ∇  ⋅  𝐄   =    ρ  q    ε  0     ;       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐄      subscript  ρ  q    subscript  ε  0      \nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}=\frac{\rho_{q}}{\varepsilon_{0}};       ρ  q     subscript  ρ  q    \rho_{q}   being the charge density at each point in space.  Virtual-particle exchange  In perturbation theory, forces are generated by the exchange of virtual particles . The mechanics of virtual-particle exchange is best described with the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. There are insights that can be obtained, however, without going into the machinery of path integrals, such as why classical gravitational and electrostatic forces fall off as the inverse square of the distance between bodies.  Path-integral formulation of virtual-particle exchange  A virtual particle is created by a disturbance to the vacuum state , and the virtual particle is destroyed when it is absorbed back into the vacuum state by another disturbance. The disturbances are imagined to be due to bodies that interact with the virtual particle field.  The probability amplitude  The probability amplitude for the creation, propagation, and destruction of a virtual particle is given, in the path integral formulation by      Z  ≡   ⟨  0  |   exp   (   -   i   H  ^   T    )    |  0  ⟩   =   exp   (   -   i  E  T    )    =   ∫   D   φ    exp   (   i  𝒮   [  φ  ]    )      =   exp   (   i  W   )          Z   quantum-operator-product  0        i   normal-^  H   T     0              i  E  T              D  φ      i  𝒮   delimited-[]  φ                i  W       Z\equiv\langle 0|\exp\left(-i\hat{H}T\right)|0\rangle=\exp\left(-iET\right)=%
 \int D\varphi\;\exp\left(i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]\right)\;=\exp\left(iW\right)     where    H  ^     normal-^  H    \hat{H}   is the Hamiltonian operator ,   T   T   T   is elapsed time,   E   E   E   is the energy change due to the disturbance,    W  =   -   E  T        W      E  T      W=-ET   is the change in action due to the disturbance,   φ   φ   \varphi   is the field of the virtual particle, the integral is over all paths, and the classical action is given by       𝒮   [  φ  ]    =   ∫    d  4    x   ℒ   [   φ   (  x  )    ]           𝒮   delimited-[]  φ         superscript  normal-d  4   x  ℒ   delimited-[]    φ  x        \mathcal{S}[\varphi]=\int\mathrm{d}^{4}x\;{\mathcal{L}[\varphi(x)]\,}     where    ℒ   [   φ   (  x  )    ]       ℒ   delimited-[]    φ  x      \mathcal{L}[\varphi(x)]   is the Lagrangian density. We are using natural units ,    ℏ  =  c  =  1        Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c       1     \hbar=c=1   .  Here, the spacetime metric is given by        η   μ  ν    =   (     1    0    0    0      0     -  1     0    0      0    0     -  1     0      0    0    0     -  1      )    .       subscript  η    μ  ν      1  0  0  0    0    1   0  0    0  0    1   0    0  0  0    1       \eta_{\mu\nu}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\
 0&-1&0&0\\
 0&0&-1&0\\
 0&0&0&-1\end{pmatrix}.     The path integral often can be converted to the form      Z  =   ∫    exp   [   i   ∫    d  4   x   (     1  2   φ   O  ^   φ   +   J  φ    )      ]    D  φ        Z          i       superscript  d  4   x        1  2   φ   normal-^  O   φ     J  φ        D  φ      Z=\int\exp\left[i\int d^{4}x\left(\frac{1}{2}\varphi\hat{O}\varphi+J\varphi%
 \right)\right]D\varphi     where    O  ^     normal-^  O    \hat{O}   is a differential operator with   φ   φ   \varphi   and   J   J   J   functions of spacetime . The first term in the argument represents the free particle and the second term represents the disturbance to the field from an external source such as a charge or a mass.  The integral can be written (see Common integrals in quantum field theory )      Z  ∝   exp   (   i  W   (  J  )    )       proportional-to  Z      i  W  J      Z\propto\exp\left(iW\left(J\right)\right)     where       W   (  J  )    =   -    1  2    ∬    d  4    x    d  4    y   J   (  x  )   D   (   x  -  y   )   J   (  y  )             W  J         1  2    double-integral     superscript  d  4   x   superscript  d  4   y  J  x  D    x  y   J  y        W\left(J\right)=-{1\over 2}\iint d^{4}x\;d^{4}y\;J\left(x\right)D\left(x-y%
 \right)J\left(y\right)     is the change in the action due to the disturbances and the propagator     D   (   x  -  y   )       D    x  y     D\left(x-y\right)   is the solution of        O  ^   D   (   x  -  y   )    =    δ  4    (   x  -  y   )           normal-^  O   D    x  y       superscript  δ  4     x  y      \hat{O}D\left(x-y\right)=\delta^{4}\left(x-y\right)   .  Energy of interaction  We assume that there are two point disturbances representing two bodies and that the disturbances are motionless and constant in time. The disturbances can be written       J   (  x  )    =   (    J  1   +   J  2    ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )         J  x       subscript  J  1    subscript  J  2    0  0  0     J\left(x\right)=\left(J_{1}+J_{2},0,0,0\right)          J  1   =    a  1    δ  3    (    x  →   -    x  →   1    )         subscript  J  1      subscript  a  1    superscript  δ  3      normal-→  x    subscript   normal-→  x   1       J_{1}=a_{1}\delta^{3}\left(\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{1}\right)          J  2   =    a  2    δ  3    (    x  →   -    x  →   2    )         subscript  J  2      subscript  a  2    superscript  δ  3      normal-→  x    subscript   normal-→  x   2       J_{2}=a_{2}\delta^{3}\left(\vec{x}-\vec{x}_{2}\right)     where the delta functions are in space, the disturbances are located at     x  →   1     subscript   normal-→  x   1    \vec{x}_{1}   and     x  →   2     subscript   normal-→  x   2    \vec{x}_{2}   , and the coefficients    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   and    a  2     subscript  a  2    a_{2}   are the strengths of the disturbances.  If we neglect self-interactions of the disturbances then W becomes       W   (  J  )    =   -   ∬    d  4    x    d  4    y    J  1    (  x  )    1  2    [    D   (   x  -  y   )    +   D   (   y  -  x   )     ]    J  2    (  y  )            W  J      double-integral     superscript  d  4   x   superscript  d  4   y   subscript  J  1   x    1  2    delimited-[]      D    x  y      D    y  x       subscript  J  2   y       W\left(J\right)=-\iint d^{4}x\;d^{4}y\;J_{1}\left(x\right){1\over 2}\left[D%
 \left(x-y\right)+D\left(y-x\right)\right]J_{2}\left(y\right)   ,  which can be written       W   (  J  )    =   -      T   a  1    a  2    ∫       d  3   k     (   2  π   )   3     D   (  k  )      |     k  0   =  0     exp   (    i   k  →    ⋅   (     x  →   1   -    x  →   2    )    )            W  J        evaluated-at    T   subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2            superscript  d  3   k    superscript    2  π   3    D  k        subscript  k  0   0       normal-⋅    i   normal-→  k       subscript   normal-→  x   1    subscript   normal-→  x   2          W\left(J\right)=-Ta_{1}a_{2}\int{d^{3}k\over(2\pi)^{3}}\;\;D\left(k\right)\mid%
 _{k_{0}=0}\;\exp\left(i\vec{k}\cdot\left(\vec{x}_{1}-\vec{x}_{2}\right)\right)   .  Here    D   (  k  )       D  k    D\left(k\right)   is the Fourier transform of       1  2    [    D   (   x  -  y   )    +   D   (   y  -  x   )     ]         1  2    delimited-[]      D    x  y      D    y  x        {1\over 2}\left[D\left(x-y\right)+D\left(y-x\right)\right]   .  Finally, the change in energy due to the static disturbances of the vacuum is  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |    E  =   -   W  T    =       a  1    a  2    ∫       d  3   k     (   2  π   )   3     D   (  k  )      |     k  0   =  0     exp   (    i   k  →    ⋅   (     x  →   1   -    x  →   2    )    )           E      W  T            evaluated-at     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2            superscript  d  3   k    superscript    2  π   3    D  k        subscript  k  0   0       normal-⋅    i   normal-→  k       subscript   normal-→  x   1    subscript   normal-→  x   2          E=-{W\over T}=a_{1}a_{2}\int{d^{3}k\over(2\pi)^{3}}\;\;D\left(k\right)\mid_{k_%
 {0}=0}\;\exp\left(i\vec{k}\cdot\left(\vec{x}_{1}-\vec{x}_{2}\right)\right)   . |}  If this quantity is negative, the force is attractive. If it is positive, the force is repulsive.  Examples of static, motionless, interacting currents are Yukawa Potential , The Coulomb potential in a vacuum , and Coulomb potential in a simple plasma or electron gas .  The expression for the interaction energy can be generalized to the situation in which the point particles are moving, but the motion is slow compared with the speed of light. Examples are Darwin interaction in a vacuum and Darwin interaction in a plasma .  Finally, the expression for the interaction energy can be generalized to situations in which the disturbances are not point particles, but are possibly line charges, tubes of charges, or current vortices. Examples are Two line charges embedded in a plasma or electron gas , Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field , and Magnetic interaction between current loops in a simple plasma or electron gas . As seen from the Coulomb interaction between tubes of charge example, these more complicated geometries can lead to such exotic phenomena as fractional quantum numbers .  Selected examples  The Yukawa potential: The force between two nucleons in an atomic nucleus  Consider the spin -0 Lagrangian density 4       ℒ   [   φ   (  x  )    ]    =    1  2    [     (   ∂  φ   )   2   -    m  2    φ  2     ]          ℒ   delimited-[]    φ  x         1  2    delimited-[]     superscript    φ   2      superscript  m  2    superscript  φ  2         \mathcal{L}[\varphi(x)]={1\over 2}\left[\left(\partial\varphi\right)^{2}-m^{2}%

If we add a disturbance the probability amplitude becomes      Z  =   ∫   D   φ    exp   {   i   ∫    d  4    x    [     1  2    (     (   ∂  φ   )   2   -    m  2    φ  2     )    +   J  φ    ]      }          Z      D  φ      i       superscript  d  4   x   delimited-[]        1  2      superscript    φ   2      superscript  m  2    superscript  φ  2        J  φ             Z=\int D\varphi\;\exp\left\{i\int d^{4}x\;\left[{1\over 2}\left(\left(\partial%

If we integrate by parts and neglect boundary terms at infinity the probability amplitude becomes      Z  =   ∫   D   φ    exp   {   i   ∫    d  4    x    [    -    1  2   φ   (    ∂  2   +   m  2    )   φ    +   J  φ    ]      }          Z      D  φ      i       superscript  d  4   x   delimited-[]          1  2   φ     superscript   2    superscript  m  2    φ      J  φ             Z=\int D\varphi\;\exp\left\{i\int d^{4}x\;\left[-{1\over 2}\varphi\left(%

With the amplitude in this form it can be seen that the propagator is the solution of       -    (    ∂  2   +   m  2    )   D   (   x  -  y   )     =    δ  4    (   x  -  y   )               superscript   2    superscript  m  2    D    x  y        superscript  δ  4     x  y      -\left(\partial^{2}+m^{2}\right)D\left(x-y\right)=\delta^{4}\left(x-y\right)   .  From this it can be seen that         D   (  k  )    |     k  0   =  0    =   -   1     k  →   2   +   m  2           evaluated-at    D  k      subscript  k  0   0        1     superscript   normal-→  k   2    superscript  m  2        D\left(k\right)\mid_{k_{0}=0}\;=\;-{1\over\vec{k}^{2}+m^{2}}   .

Yukawa proposed that this field describes the force between two nucleons in an atomic nucleus. It allowed him to predict both the range and the mass of the particle, now known as the pion , associated with this field.  Electrostatics  The Coulomb potential in a vacuum  Consider the spin -1 Proca Lagrangian with a disturbance 5       ℒ   [   φ   (  x  )    ]    =    -    1  4    F   μ  ν     F   μ  ν      +    1  2    m  2    A  μ    A  μ    +    A  μ    J  μ           ℒ   delimited-[]    φ  x             1  4    subscript  F    μ  ν     superscript  F    μ  ν          1  2    superscript  m  2    subscript  A  μ    superscript  A  μ       subscript  A  μ    superscript  J  μ       \mathcal{L}[\varphi(x)]=-{1\over 4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+{1\over 2}m^{2}A_{\mu}%

Moreover, we assume that there is only a time-like component    J  0     superscript  J  0    J^{0}   to the disturbance. In ordinary language, this means that there is a charge at the points of disturbance, but there are no electric currents.  If we follow the same procedure as we did with the Yukawa potential we find that       -    1  4    ∫    d  4   x   F   μ  ν     F   μ  ν        =   -    1  4    ∫    d  4   x   (     ∂  μ    A  ν    -    ∂  ν    A  μ     )    (     ∂  μ    A  ν    -    ∂  ν    A  μ     )                 1  4        superscript  d  4   x   subscript  F    μ  ν     superscript  F    μ  ν              1  4        superscript  d  4   x      subscript   μ    subscript  A  ν      subscript   ν    subscript  A  μ         superscript   μ    superscript  A  ν      superscript   ν    superscript  A  μ           -{1\over 4}\int d^{4}xF_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}=-{1\over 4}\int d^{4}x\left(%

In the limit of zero photon mass, the Lagrangian reduces to the Lagrangian for electromagnetism  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |     E  =     a  1    a  2     4  π  r     .      E       subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      4  π  r      E={a_{1}a_{2}\over 4\pi r}.   |}  Therefore the energy reduces to the potential energy for the Coulomb force and the coefficients    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   and    a  2     subscript  a  2    a_{2}   are proportional to the electric charge. Unlike the Yukawa case, like bodies, in this electrostatic case, repel each other.  Coulomb potential in a simple plasma or electron gas  Plasma waves  The dispersion relation for plasma waves is 6        ω  2   =    ω  p  2   +   γ   (  ω  )     T  e   m     k  →   2      .       superscript  ω  2      superscript   subscript  ω  p   2     γ  ω     subscript  T  e   m    superscript   normal-→  k   2       \omega^{2}=\omega_{p}^{2}+\gamma\left(\omega\right){T_{e}\over m}\vec{k}^{2}.     where   ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency of the wave,       ω  p  2   =    4  π  n   e  2    m        superscript   subscript  ω  p   2       4  π  n   superscript  e  2    m     \omega_{p}^{2}={4\pi ne^{2}\over m}     is the plasma frequency ,   e   e   e   is the magnitude of the electron charge ,   m   m   m   is the electron mass ,    T  e     subscript  T  e    T_{e}   is the electron temperature ( Boltzmann's constant equal to one), and    γ   (  ω  )       γ  ω    \gamma\left(\omega\right)   is a factor that varies with frequency from one to three. At high frequencies, on the order of the plasma frequency, the compression of the electron fluid is an adiabatic process and    γ   (  ω  )       γ  ω    \gamma\left(\omega\right)   is equal to three. At low frequencies, the compression is an isothermal process and    γ   (  ω  )       γ  ω    \gamma\left(\omega\right)   is equal to one. Retardation effects have been neglected in obtaining the plasma-wave dispersion relation.  For low frequencies, the dispersion relation becomes         k  →   2   +    k  →   D  2    =  0         superscript   normal-→  k   2    superscript   subscript   normal-→  k   D   2    0    \vec{k}^{2}+\vec{k}_{D}^{2}=0     where       k  D  2   =    4  π  n   e  2     T  e         superscript   subscript  k  D   2       4  π  n   superscript  e  2     subscript  T  e      k_{D}^{2}={4\pi ne^{2}\over T_{e}}     is the Debye number, which is the inverse of the Debye length . This suggests that the propagator is         D   (  k  )    |     k  0   =  0    =   1     k  →   2   +   k  D  2          evaluated-at    D  k      subscript  k  0   0      1     superscript   normal-→  k   2    superscript   subscript  k  D   2       D\left(k\right)\mid_{k_{0}=0}\;=\;{1\over\vec{k}^{2}+k_{D}^{2}}   .  In fact, if the retardation effects are not neglected, then the dispersion relation is          -   k  0  2    +    k  →   2   +   k  D  2    -    m   T  e     k  0  2     =  0   ,             superscript   subscript  k  0   2     superscript   normal-→  k   2    superscript   subscript  k  D   2        m   subscript  T  e     superscript   subscript  k  0   2     0    -k_{0}^{2}+\vec{k}^{2}+k_{D}^{2}-{m\over T_{e}}k_{0}^{2}=0,     which does indeed yield the guessed propagator. This propagator is the same as the massive Coulomb propagator with the mass equal to the inverse Debye length. The interaction energy is therefore  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |     E  =      a  1    a  2     4  π  r     exp   (   -    k  D   r    )      .      E         subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      4  π  r           subscript  k  D   r        E={a_{1}a_{2}\over 4\pi r}\exp\left(-k_{D}r\right).   |} The Coulomb potential is screened on length scales of a Debye length.  Plasmons  In a quantum electron gas , plasma waves are known as plasmons . Debye screening is replaced with Thomas–Fermi screening to yield 7  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |    E  =      a  1    a  2     4  π  r     exp   (   -    k  s   r    )         E         subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      4  π  r           subscript  k  s   r        E={a_{1}a_{2}\over 4\pi r}\exp\left(-k_{s}r\right)   |}  where the inverse of the Thomas–Fermi screening length is       k  s  2   =    6  π  n   e  2     ϵ  F         superscript   subscript  k  s   2       6  π  n   superscript  e  2     subscript  ϵ  F      k_{s}^{2}={6\pi ne^{2}\over\epsilon_{F}}     and    ϵ  F     subscript  ϵ  F    \epsilon_{F}   is the Fermi energy        ϵ  F   =     ℏ  2    2  m       (   3   π  2   n   )    2  /  3       .       subscript  ϵ  F        superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m     superscript    3   superscript  π  2   n     2  3       \epsilon_{F}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\left({3\pi^{2}n}\right)^{2/3}\,.     This expression can be derived from the chemical potential for an electron gas and from Poisson's equation . The chemical potential for an electron gas near equilibrium is constant and given by      μ  =    -   e  φ    +   ϵ  F        μ        e  φ     subscript  ϵ  F      \mu=-e\varphi+\epsilon_{F}     where   φ   φ   \varphi   is the electric potential . Linearizing the Fermi energy to first order in the density fluctuation and combining with Poisson's equation yields the screening length. The force carrier is the quantum version of the plasma wave .  Two line charges embedded in a plasma or electron gas  We consider a line of charge with axis in the z direction embedded in an electron gas        J  1    (  x  )    =     a  1    L  B     1   2  π  r     δ  2    (  r  )           subscript  J  1   x        subscript  a  1    subscript  L  B      1    2  π  r     superscript  δ  2   r     J_{1}\left(x\right)={a_{1}\over L_{B}}{1\over 2\pi r}\delta^{2}\left(r\right)     where   r   r   r   is the distance in the xy plane from the line of charge,    L  B     subscript  L  B    L_{B}   is the width of the material in the z direction. The superscript 2 indicates that the Dirac delta function is in two dimensions. The propagator is         D   (  k  )    |     k  0   =  0    =   1     k  →   2   +   k   D  s   2          evaluated-at    D  k      subscript  k  0   0      1     superscript   normal-→  k   2    superscript   subscript  k    D  s    2       D\left(k\right)\mid_{k_{0}=0}\;=\;{1\over\vec{k}^{2}+k_{Ds}^{2}}     where    k   D  s      subscript  k    D  s     k_{Ds}   is either the inverse Debye-Hückel screening length or the inverse Thomas–Fermi screening length.  The interaction energy is  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |      E  =    (      a  1     a  2     2  π   L  B     )     ∫  0  ∞       k   d   k      k  2   +   k   D  s   2      𝒥  0    (   k   r  12    )      =    (      a  1     a  2     2  π   L  B     )    K  0    (    k   D  s     r  12    )          E         subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      2  π   subscript  L  B       superscript   subscript   0           k  d  k      superscript  k  2    superscript   subscript  k    D  s    2      subscript  𝒥  0     k   subscript  r  12                   subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      2  π   subscript  L  B      subscript  K  0      subscript  k    D  s     subscript  r  12        E=\left({a_{1}\,a_{2}\over 2\pi L_{B}}\right)\int_{0}^{\infty}{{k\;dk\;}\over k%

As with delta function charges, the value of    r  12     subscript  r  12    r_{12}   in which the energy is a local minimum only depends on the total angular momentum, not on the angular momenta of the individual currents. Also, as with the delta function charges, the energy at the minimum increases as the ratio of angular momenta varies from one. Therefore, the series       l   l  *    =    1  3   ,   2  5   ,   3  7   ,  etc.,         l   superscript  l        1  3     2  5     3  7   etc.,     {\mathit{l}\over\mathit{l}^{*}}={1\over 3},{2\over 5},{3\over 7},\mbox{etc.,}     and       l   l  *    =    2  3   ,   3  5   ,   4  7   ,  etc.,         l   superscript  l        2  3     3  5     4  7   etc.,     {\mathit{l}\over\mathit{l}^{*}}={2\over 3},{3\over 5},{4\over 7},\mbox{etc.,}     appear as well in the case of charges spread by the wave function.  The Laughlin wavefunction is an ansatz for the quasiparticle wavefunction. If the expectation value of the interaction energy is taken over a Laughlin wavefunction , these series are also preserved.  Magnetostatics  Darwin interaction in a vacuum  A charged moving particle can generate a magnetic field that affects the motion of another charged particle. The static version of this effect is called the Darwin interaction . To calculate this, consider the electrical currents in space generated by a moving charge         J  →   1    (   x  →   )    =    a  1     v  →   1    δ  3    (    x  →   -    x  →   1    )           subscript   normal-→  J   1    normal-→  x       subscript  a  1    subscript   normal-→  v   1    superscript  δ  3      normal-→  x    subscript   normal-→  x   1       \vec{J}_{1}\left(\vec{x}\right)=a_{1}\vec{v}_{1}\delta^{3}\left(\vec{x}-\vec{x%
 }_{1}\right)     with a comparable expression for     J  →   2     subscript   normal-→  J   2    \vec{J}_{2}   .  The Fourier transform of this current is          J  →   1    (   k  →   )    =    a  1     v  →   1    exp   (    i   k  →    ⋅    x  →   1    )      .         subscript   normal-→  J   1    normal-→  k       subscript  a  1    subscript   normal-→  v   1      normal-⋅    i   normal-→  k     subscript   normal-→  x   1        \vec{J}_{1}\left(\vec{k}\right)=a_{1}\vec{v}_{1}\exp\left(i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}%

J  →   1    (   k  →   )    =       a  1    [   1  -    k  ^    k  ^     ]    ⋅    v  →   1     exp   (    i   k  →    ⋅    x  →   1    )     +      a  1    [    k  ^    k  ^    ]    ⋅    v  →   1     exp   (    i   k  →    ⋅    x  →   1    )       .         subscript   normal-→  J   1    normal-→  k         normal-⋅     subscript  a  1    delimited-[]    1     normal-^  k    normal-^  k        subscript   normal-→  v   1       normal-⋅    i   normal-→  k     subscript   normal-→  x   1         normal-⋅     subscript  a  1    delimited-[]     normal-^  k    normal-^  k       subscript   normal-→  v   1       normal-⋅    i   normal-→  k     subscript   normal-→  x   1         \vec{J}_{1}\left(\vec{k}\right)=a_{1}\left[1-\hat{k}\hat{k}\right]\cdot\vec{v}%

 \cdot\vec{v}_{1}\exp\left(i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}_{1}\right).     The hat indicates a unit vector . The last term disappears because         k  →   ⋅   J  →    =   -    k  0    J  0     →  0   ,         normal-⋅   normal-→  k    normal-→  J         subscript  k  0    superscript  J  0       normal-→    0     \vec{k}\cdot\vec{J}=-k_{0}J^{0}\rightarrow 0,     which results from charge conservation. Here    k  0     subscript  k  0    k_{0}   vanishes because we are considering static forces.

Here, the upper hybrid frequency is given by        ω  H  2   =    ω  p  2   +   ω  c  2     ,       superscript   subscript  ω  H   2      superscript   subscript  ω  p   2    superscript   subscript  ω  c   2      \omega_{H}^{2}=\omega_{p}^{2}+\omega_{c}^{2},     the cyclotron frequency is given by ( Gaussian units )        ω  c   =    e  B    m  c     ,       subscript  ω  c       e  B     m  c      \omega_{c}={eB\over mc},     and the plasma frequency ( Gaussian units )        ω  p  2   =    4  π  n   e  2    m    .       superscript   subscript  ω  p   2       4  π  n   superscript  e  2    m     \omega_{p}^{2}={4\pi ne^{2}\over m}.     Here n is the electron density, e is the magnitude of the electron charge, and m is the electron mass.

Relation to the quantum Hall effect  The screening wavenumber can be written ( Gaussian units )      μ  =     ω  p  2    r  B      ω  H   c    =    (    2   e  2    r  B      L  B   ℏ  c    )    ν    1  +    ω  p  2    ω  c  2        =   2  α   (    r  B    L  B    )    (   1    1  +    ω  p  2    ω  c  2       )   ν         μ       superscript   subscript  ω  p   2    subscript  r  B       subscript  ω  H   c               2   superscript  e  2    subscript  r  B       subscript  L  B   Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c      ν      1     superscript   subscript  ω  p   2    superscript   subscript  ω  c   2               2  α     subscript  r  B    subscript  L  B      1      1     superscript   subscript  ω  p   2    superscript   subscript  ω  c   2       ν      \mu={\omega_{p}^{2}r_{B}\over\omega_{H}c}=\left({2e^{2}r_{B}\over L_{B}\hbar c%

 }}}\right)\nu     where   α   α   \alpha   is the fine-structure constant and the filling factor is      ν  =    2  π  N  ℏ  c    e  B  A        ν      2  π  N  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c     e  B  A      \nu={2\pi N\hbar c\over eBA}     and N is the number of electrons in the material and A is the area of the material perpendicular to the magnetic field. This parameter is important in the quantum Hall effect and the fractional quantum Hall effect . The filling factor is the fraction of occupied Landau states at the ground state energy.  For cases of interest in the quantum Hall effect,   μ   μ   \mu   is small. In that case the interaction energy is  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |    E  =   -     E  0   2    [   1  -    1  8    μ  2     ]         E         subscript  E  0   2    delimited-[]    1      1  8    superscript  μ  2          E=-{E_{0}\over 2}\left[1-{1\over 8}\mu^{2}\right]   |}  where ( Gaussian units )       E  0   =   4  π    e  2    L  B      v  2    c  2     =   8  π    e  2    L  B     (    ℏ   ω  c     m   c  2     )           subscript  E  0     4  π     superscript  e  2    subscript  L  B       superscript  v  2    superscript  c  2            8  π     superscript  e  2    subscript  L  B        Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  ω  c      m   superscript  c  2         E_{0}={4\pi}{e^{2}\over L_{B}}{v^{2}\over c^{2}}={8\pi}{e^{2}\over L_{B}}\left%
 ({\hbar\omega_{c}\over mc^{2}}\right)     is the interaction energy for zero filling factor. We have set the classical kinetic energy to the quantum energy         1  2   m   v  2    =   ℏ   ω  c     .          1  2   m   superscript  v  2      Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  ω  c      {1\over 2}mv^{2}=\hbar\omega_{c}.     Gravitation  The Lagrangian for the gravitational field is spin -2. The disturbance is generated by the stress–energy tensor     T   μ  ν      superscript  T    μ  ν     T^{\mu\nu}   . If the disturbances are at rest, then the only component of the stress–energy tensor that survives is the   00   00   00   component. If we use the same trick of giving the graviton some mass and then taking the mass to zero at the end of the calculation the propagator becomes         D   (  k  )    |     k  0   =  0    =   -    4  3    1     k  →   2   +   m  2            evaluated-at    D  k      subscript  k  0   0          4  3     1     superscript   normal-→  k   2    superscript  m  2         D\left(k\right)\mid_{k_{0}=0}\;=\;-{4\over 3}{1\over\vec{k}^{2}+m^{2}}     and  ::{|cellpadding="2" style="border:2px solid #ccccff" |    E  =   -    4  3      a  1    a  2     4  π  r     exp   (   -   m  r    )          E        4  3        subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      4  π  r          m  r         E=-{4\over 3}{a_{1}a_{2}\over 4\pi r}\exp\left(-mr\right)   , |}  which is once again attractive rather than repulsive. The coefficients are proportional to the masses of the disturbances. In the limit of small graviton mass, we recover the inverse-square behavior of Newton's Law. 13  Unlike the electrostatic case, however, taking the small-mass limit of the boson does not yield the correct result. A more rigorous treatment yields a factor of one in the energy rather than 4/3. 14  References  "  Category:Quantum field theory     pp. 16-37 ↩  1 ↩  ↩  Zee, pp. 21-29 ↩  Zee, pp. 30-31 ↩  pp. 75-82 ↩  pp. 296-299. ↩  pp. 187-190 ↩  Ezewa, p. 189 ↩  Chen, pp. 100-103 ↩  Chen, pp. 110-112 ↩  Chen, p. 112 ↩  Zee, pp. 32-37 ↩  Zee, p. 35 ↩
