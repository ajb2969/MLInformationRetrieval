Tychonoff plank

In topology, the Tychonoff plank is a topological space defined using ordinal spaces that is a counterexample to several plausible-sounding conjectures.
Definition
It is defined as the topological product of the two ordinal spaces

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the first infinite ordinal and 
 
 
 
  the first uncountable ordinal.
Deleted form
The deleted Tychonoff plank is obtained by deleting the point 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
The Tychonoff plank is a compact Hausdorff space and is therefore a normal space. However, the deleted Tychonoff plank is non-normal. Therefore the Tychonoff plank is not completely normal. This shows that a subspace of a normal space need not be normal. The Tychonoff plank is not perfectly normal because it is not a Gδ space: the singleton 
 
 
 
  is closed but not a Gδ set.
