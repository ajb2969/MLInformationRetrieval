   Tychonoff plank      Tychonoff plank   In topology , the Tychonoff plank is a topological space defined using ordinal spaces that is a counterexample to several plausible-sounding conjectures .  Definition  It is defined as the topological product of the two ordinal spaces     [  0  ,   ω  1   ]     0   subscript  ω  1     [0,\omega_{1}]   and    [  0  ,  ω  ]     0  ω    [0,\omega]   , where   ω   ω   \omega   is the first infinite ordinal and    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   the first uncountable ordinal .  Deleted form  The deleted Tychonoff plank is obtained by deleting the point    ∞  =   (   ω  1   ,  ω  )          subscript  ω  1   ω     \infty=(\omega_{1},\omega)   .  Properties  The Tychonoff plank is a compact Hausdorff space and is therefore a normal space . However, the deleted Tychonoff plank is non-normal. Therefore the Tychonoff plank is not completely normal . This shows that a subspace of a normal space need not be normal. The Tychonoff plank is not perfectly normal because it is not a Gδ space : the singleton    {  ∞  }        \{\infty\}   is closed but not a Gδ set .
