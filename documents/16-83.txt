(+)-beta-caryophyllene synthase

(+)-beta-caryophyllene synthase (, GcoA) is an enzyme with system name (2Z,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (+)-beta-caryophyllene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-beta-caryophyllene + diphosphate


This enzyme also converts the (+)-beta-caryophyllene to (+)-caryolan-1-ol.
