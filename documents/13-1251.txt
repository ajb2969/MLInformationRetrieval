   X (charge)      X (charge)   In particle physics , the X-charge (or simply X ) is a conserved  quantum number associated with the SO(10)  grand unification theory .  X is related to the difference between the baryon number  B and the lepton number  L (that is B âˆ’ L ), and the weak hypercharge  Y W via the relation:      X  =    5   (   B  -  L   )    -   2    Y  W          X      5    B  L      2   subscript  Y  W       X=5(B-L)-2Y_{W}\,   .
