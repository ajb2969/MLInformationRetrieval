Arsenate reductase (glutaredoxin)

Arsenate reductase (glutaredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

arsenate + glutaredoxin 
 
 
 
  arsenite + glutaredoxin disulfide + H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arsenate and glutaredoxin, whereas its 3 products are arsenite, glutaredoxin disulfide, and water.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donor with disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutaredoxin:arsenate oxidoreductase.
