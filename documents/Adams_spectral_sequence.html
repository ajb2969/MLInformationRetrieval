<h1>Adams spectral sequence</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>Adams spectral sequence</strong> is a <a href="spectral_sequence" title="wikilink">spectral sequence</a> introduced by . Like all spectral sequences, it is a computational tool; it relates <a href="homology_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">homology</a> theory to what is now called <a href="stable_homotopy_theory" title="wikilink">stable homotopy theory</a>. It is a reformulation using <a href="homological_algebra" title="wikilink">homological algebra</a>, and an extension, of a technique called 'killing homotopy groups' applied by the French school of <a href="Henri_Cartan" title="wikilink">Henri Cartan</a> and <a href="Jean-Pierre_Serre" title="wikilink">Jean-Pierre Serre</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>For everything below, once and for all, we fix a prime <em>p</em>. All spaces are assumed to be <a href="CW_complex" title="wikilink">CW complexes</a>. The <a href="singular_cohomology" title="wikilink">ordinary</a> <a href="cohomology_group" title="wikilink">cohomology groups</a> <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>) are understood to mean <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>; <strong>Z</strong>/<em>p</em><strong>Z</strong>).</p>

<p>The primary goal of algebraic topology is to try to understand the collection of all maps, up to homotopy, between arbitrary spaces <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. This is extraordinarily ambitious: in particular, when <em>X</em> is <em>S<sup>n</sup></em>, these maps form the <em>n</em>th <a href="homotopy_group" title="wikilink">homotopy group</a> of <em>Y</em>. A more reasonable (but still very difficult!) goal is to understand [<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>], the maps (up to homotopy) that remain after we apply the <a href="Suspension_(topology)" title="wikilink">suspension functor</a> a large number of times. We call this the collection of stable maps from <em>X</em> to <em>Y</em>. (This is the starting point of <a href="stable_homotopy_theory" title="wikilink">stable homotopy theory</a>; more modern treatments of this topic begin with the concept of a <a href="Spectrum_(homotopy_theory)" title="wikilink">spectrum</a>. Adams' original work did not use spectra, and we avoid further mention of them in this section to keep the content here as elementary as possible.)</p>

<p>[<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>] turns out to be an abelian group, and if <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are reasonable spaces this group is finitely generated. To figure out what this group is, we first isolate a prime <em>p</em>. In an attempt to compute the <em>p</em>-torsion of [<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>], we look at cohomology: send [<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>] to Hom(<em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>Y</em>), <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>)). This is a good idea because cohomology groups are usually tractable to compute.</p>

<p>The key idea is that <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>) is more than just a graded <a href="abelian_group" title="wikilink">abelian group</a>, and more still than a graded <a href="ring_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">ring</a> (via the <a href="cup_product" title="wikilink">cup product</a>). The representability of the cohomology functor makes <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>) a <a href="module_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">module</a> over the algebra of its stable <a href="cohomology_operation" title="wikilink">cohomology operations</a>, the <a href="Steenrod_algebra" title="wikilink">Steenrod algebra</a> <em>A</em>. Thinking about <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>) as an <em>A</em>-module forgets some cup product structure, but the gain is enormous: Hom(<em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>Y</em>), <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>)) can now be taken to be <em>A</em>-linear! A priori, the <em>A</em>-module sees no more of [<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>] than it did when we considered it to be a map of vector spaces over F<sub><em>p</em></sub>. But we can now consider the derived functors of Hom in the category of <em>A</em>-modules, <a href="Ext_functor" title="wikilink">Ext</a><sub><em>A</em></sub><sup><em>r</em></sup>(<em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>Y</em>), <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>)). These acquire a second grading from the grading on <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>Y</em>), and so we obtain a two-dimensional "page" of algebraic data. The Ext groups are designed to measure the failure of Hom's preservation of algebraic structure, so this is a reasonable step.</p>

<p>The point of all this is that <em>A</em> is so large that the above sheet of cohomological data contains all the information we need to recover the <em>p</em>-primary part of [<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>], which is homotopy data. This is a major accomplishment because cohomology was designed to be computable, while homotopy was designed to be powerful. This is the content of the Adams spectral sequence.</p>
<h2 id="classical-formulation">Classical formulation</h2>

<p>For <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> spaces of finite type, with <em>X</em> a finite dimensional CW-complex, there is a spectral sequence, called the <strong>classical Adams spectral sequence</strong>, converging to the <em>p</em>-torsion in [<em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>], with <em>E</em><sub>2</sub>-term given by</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>E</em><sub>2</sub><sup><em>t</em>,<em>s</em></sup> = Ext<sub><em>A</em></sub><sup><em>t</em>,<em>s</em></sup>(<em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>Y</em>), <em>H</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>X</em>)),
</dd>
</dl>

<p>and differentials of bidegree (<em>r</em>, <em>r</em> − 1).</p>
<h2 id="calculations">Calculations</h2>

<p>The sequence itself is not an algorithmic device, but lends itself to problem solving in particular cases.</p>

<p>Adams' original use for his spectral sequence was the first proof of the <a href="Hopf_invariant" title="wikilink">Hopf invariant</a> 1 problem

 admits a division algebra structure only for <em>n</em> = 1, 2, 4, or 8. He subsequently found a much shorter proof using cohomology operations in <a class="uri" href="K-theory" title="wikilink">K-theory</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Thom_space" title="wikilink">Thom isomorphism theorem</a> relates differential topology to stable homotopy theory, and this is where the Adams spectral sequence found its first major use: in 1960, Milnor and Novikov used the Adams spectral sequence to compute the coefficient ring of <a href="complex_cobordism" title="wikilink">complex cobordism</a>. Further, Milnor and Wall used the spectral sequence to prove Thom's conjecture on the structure of the oriented <a class="uri" href="cobordism" title="wikilink">cobordism</a> ring: two oriented manifolds are cobordant if and only if their Pontryagin and Stiefel–Whitney numbers agree.</p>
<h2 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h2>

<p>The Adams–Novikov spectral sequence is a generalization of the Adams spectral sequence introduced by  where ordinary cohomology is replaced by a <a href="generalized_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">generalized cohomology theory</a>, often <a href="complex_bordism" title="wikilink">complex bordism</a> or <a href="Brown–Peterson_cohomology" title="wikilink">Brown–Peterson cohomology</a>. This requires knowledge of the algebra of stable cohomology operations for the cohomology theory in question, but enables calculations which are completely intractable with the classical Adams spectral sequence.</p>
