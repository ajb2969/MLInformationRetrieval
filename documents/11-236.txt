   Prephenate dehydratase      Prephenate dehydratase   In enzymology , a prephenate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   prephenate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylpyruvate + H 2 O + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , prephenate , but 3 products : phenylpyruvate , H 2 O , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is prephenate hydro-lyase (decarboxylating; phenylpyruvate-forming) . This enzyme is also called prephenate hydro-lyase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
