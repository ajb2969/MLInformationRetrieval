   Isomorphism-closed subcategory      Isomorphism-closed subcategory   In category theory , a branch of mathematics, a subcategory    𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   of a category    ℬ   ℬ   \mathcal{B}   is said to be isomorphism-closed or replete if every   ℬ   ℬ   \mathcal{B}   - isomorphism     h  :   A  →  B      normal-:  h   normal-→  A  B     h:A\to B   with    A  ∈  𝒜      A  𝒜    A\in\mathcal{A}   belongs to    𝒜  .    𝒜   \mathcal{A}.   This implies that both   B   B   B   and     h   -  1    :   B  →  A      normal-:   superscript  h    1     normal-→  B  A     h^{-1}:B\to A   belong to   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   as well.  A subcategory which is isomorphism-closed and full is called strictly full . In the case of full subcategories it is sufficient to check that every   ℬ   ℬ   \mathcal{B}   -object which is isomorphic to an   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -object is also an   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -object.  This condition is very natural. E.g. in the category of topological spaces one usually studies properties which are invariant under homeomorphisms – so called topological properties . Every topological property corresponds to a strictly full subcategory of    𝐓𝐨𝐩  .    𝐓𝐨𝐩   \mathbf{Top}.     "  Category:Category theory
