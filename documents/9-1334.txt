Isomorphism-closed subcategory

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a subcategory

 
  of a category

 
  is said to be isomorphism-closed or replete if every 
 
 
 
 -isomorphism

 
  with 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
  This implies that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  belong to 
 
 
 
  as well.
A subcategory which is isomorphism-closed and full is called strictly full. In the case of full subcategories it is sufficient to check that every 
 
 
 
 -object which is isomorphic to an 
 
 
 
 -object is also an 
 
 
 
 -object.
This condition is very natural. E.g. in the category of topological spaces one usually studies properties which are invariant under homeomorphisms â€“ so called topological properties. Every topological property corresponds to a strictly full subcategory of
