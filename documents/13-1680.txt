Three subgroups lemma

In mathematics, more specifically group theory, the three subgroups lemma is a result concerning commutators. It is a consequence of the Hall–Witt identity.
Notation
In that which follows, the following notation will be employed:

If H and K are subgroups of a group G, the commutator of H and K will be denoted by [H,K]; if L is a third subgroup, the convention that [H,K,L] = [[H,K],L] will be followed.
If x and y are elements of a group G, the conjugate of x by y will be denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
If H is a subgroup of a group G, then the centralizer of H in G will be denoted by CG(H).

Statement
Let X, Y and Z be subgroups of a group G, and assume
