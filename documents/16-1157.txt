   Planck–Einstein relation      Planck–Einstein relation  The '''Planck–Einstein relation''' French & Taylor (197 8), pp. 24, 55. 1 is also referred to as the Einstein relation , 2 3 4  Planck's energy–frequency relation , 5 the Planck relation , 6 and the Planck equation . 7 Also the eponym 'Planck formula' 8 belongs on this list, but also often refers instead to Planck's law 9 10 These various eponyms are far from standard; they are used only sporadically, neither regularly nor very widely. They refer to a formula integral to quantum mechanics , which states that the energy of a photon ( E ) is proportional to its frequency ( ν ).      E  =   h  ν       E    h  ν     E=h\nu   The constant of proportionality , h , is known as the Planck constant . Several equivalent forms of the relation exist.  The relation accounts for quantized nature of light , and plays a key role in understanding phenomena such as the photoelectric effect , and Planck's law of black body radiation . See also the Planck postulate .  Spectral forms  Light can be characterized using several spectral quantities, such as frequency (   ν   ν   \nu   ), wavelength (   λ   λ   \lambda   ), wavenumber (    ν  ~     normal-~  ν    \tilde{\nu}   ) and their angular equivalents ( angular frequency    ω   ω   \omega   , angular wavelength    y   y   y   , and angular wavenumber    k   k   k   ). These quantities are related through       ν  =   c  λ   =   c   ν  ~    =    c  ω    2  π    =    2  π  c   y   =    c  k    2  π     ,        ν    c  λ          c   normal-~  ν             c  ω     2  π             2  π  c   y            c  k     2  π       \nu=\frac{c}{\lambda}=c\tilde{\nu}=\frac{c\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{2\pi c}{y}=\frac%
 {ck}{2\pi},   so the Planck relation can take the following 'standard' forms       E  =   h  ν   =    h  c   λ   =   h  c   ν  ~     ,        E    h  ν            h  c   λ          h  c   normal-~  ν       E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}=hc\tilde{\nu},   as well as the following 'angular' forms,       E  =   ℏ  ω   =    ℏ  c   y   =   ℏ  c  k    .        E    Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω            Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c   y          Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c  k      E=\hbar\omega=\frac{\hbar c}{y}=\hbar ck.   The angular forms make use of the reduced Planck constant     ℏ  =   h   2  π        Planck-constant-over-2-pi    h    2  π      \hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}   . Here   c   c   c   is the speed of light .  de Broglie relation  The de Broglie relation, 11 12 13 also known as the de Broglie's momentum–wavelength relation, 14 generalizes the Planck relation to matter waves . Louis de Broglie argued that if particles had a wave nature , the relation    E  =   h  ν       E    h  ν     E=h\nu   would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to    λ  =   h  p       λ    h  p     \lambda=\frac{h}{p}   . Combining de Broglie's postulate with the Planck–Einstein relation leads to      p  =   h   ν  ~        p    h   normal-~  ν      p=h\tilde{\nu}   or       p  =   ℏ  k    .      p    Planck-constant-over-2-pi  k     p=\hbar k.     The de Broglie's relation is also often encountered in vector form       𝐩  =   ℏ  𝐤    ,      𝐩    Planck-constant-over-2-pi  𝐤     \mathbf{p}=\hbar\mathbf{k},   where   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   is the momentum vector, and   𝐤   𝐤   \mathbf{k}   is the angular wave vector .  Bohr's frequency condition  Bohr's frequency condition states that the frequency of a photon absorbed or emitted during an electronic transition is related to the energy difference (    Δ  E      normal-Δ  E    \Delta E   ) between the two energy levels involved in the transition: 15        Δ  E   =   h  ν    .        normal-Δ  E     h  ν     \Delta E=h\nu.     This is a direct consequence of the Planck–Einstein relation.  References  Cited bibliography   Cohen-Tannoudji, C. , Diu, B., Laloë, F. (1973/1977).
