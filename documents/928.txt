   Riesz transform      Riesz transform   In the mathematical theory of harmonic analysis , the Riesz transforms are a family of generalizations of the Hilbert transform to Euclidean spaces of dimension d > 1. They are a type of singular integral operator , meaning that they are given by a convolution of one function with another function having a singularity at the origin. Specifically, the Riesz transforms of a complex-valued function ƒ on R d are defined by \,dt| 1 }} for j = 1,2,..., d . The constant c d is a dimensional normalization given by        c  d   =   1   π   ω   d  -  1      =    Γ   [    (   d  +  1   )   /  2   ]     π    (   d  +  1   )   /  2      .         subscript  c  d     1    π   subscript  ω    d  1               normal-Γ   delimited-[]      d  1   2      superscript  π      d  1   2        c_{d}=\frac{1}{\pi\omega_{d-1}}=\frac{\Gamma[(d+1)/2]}{\pi^{(d+1)/2}}.     where ω d −1 is the volume of the ( d − 1)-ball. The limit is written in various ways, often as a principal value , or as a convolution with the tempered distribution         K   (  x  )    =     1   π   ω   d  -  1       p    .  v  .    x  j     |  x  |    d  +  1      .     formulae-sequence      K  x       1    π   subscript  ω    d  1      p    v     subscript  x  j    superscript    x     d  1       K(x)=\frac{1}{\pi\omega_{d-1}}\,p.v.\frac{x_{j}}{|x|^{d+1}}.     The Riesz transforms arises in the study of differentiability properties of harmonic potentials in potential theory and harmonic analysis . In particular, they arise in the proof of the Calderón-Zygmund inequality .  Multiplier properties  The Riesz transforms are given by a Fourier multiplier . Indeed, the Fourier transform of R j ƒ is given by       ℱ   (    R  j   f   )    (  x  )    =   i    x  j    |  x  |     (   ℱ  f   )    (  x  )          ℱ     subscript  R  j   f   x     i     subscript  x  j     x      ℱ  f   x     \mathcal{F}(R_{j}f)(x)=i\frac{x_{j}}{|x|}(\mathcal{F}f)(x)     (up to an overall positive constant depending on the normalization of the Fourier transform). In this form, the Riesz transforms are seen to be generalizations of the Hilbert transform. The kernel is a distribution which is homogeneous of degree zero. A particular consequence of this last observation is that the Riesz transform defines a bounded linear operator from L 2 ( R d ) to itself. 1  This homogeneity property can also be stated more directly without the aid of the Fourier transform. If σ s is the dilation on R d by the scalar s , that is σ s x = sx , then σ s defines an action on functions via pullback :         σ  s  *   f   =   f  ∘   σ  s     .         superscript   subscript  σ  s     f     f   subscript  σ  s      \sigma_{s}^{*}f=f\circ\sigma_{s}.     The Riesz transforms commute with σ s :         σ  s  *    (    R  j   f   )    =    R  j    (    σ  x  *   f   )     .         superscript   subscript  σ  s        subscript  R  j   f       subscript  R  j      superscript   subscript  σ  x     f      \sigma_{s}^{*}(R_{j}f)=R_{j}(\sigma_{x}^{*}f).     Similarly, the Riesz transforms commute with translations. Let τ a be the translation on R d along the vector a ; that is, τ a ( x ) = x + a . Then         τ  a  *    (    R  j   f   )    =    R  j    (    τ  a  *   f   )     .         superscript   subscript  τ  a        subscript  R  j   f       subscript  R  j      superscript   subscript  τ  a     f      \tau_{a}^{*}(R_{j}f)=R_{j}(\tau_{a}^{*}f).     For the final property, it is convenient to regard the Riesz transforms as a single vectorial entity R ƒ = ( R 1 ƒ,…, R d ƒ). Consider a rotation ρ in R d . The rotation acts on spatial variables, and thus on functions via pullback. But it also can act on the spatial vector R ƒ. The final transformation property asserts that the Riesz transform is equivariant with respect to these two actions; that is,         ρ  *    R  j    [     (   ρ   -  1    )   *   f   ]    =    ∑   k  =  1   d     ρ   j  k     R  k   f     .         superscript  ρ     subscript  R  j    delimited-[]     superscript   superscript  ρ    1      f       superscript   subscript     k  1    d      subscript  ρ    j  k     subscript  R  k   f      \rho^{*}R_{j}[(\rho^{-1})^{*}f]=\sum_{k=1}^{d}\rho_{jk}R_{k}f.     These three properties in fact characterize the Riesz transform in the following sense. Let T =( T 1 ,…, T d ) be a d -tuple of bounded linear operators from L 2 ( R d ) to L 2 ( R d ) such that   T commutes with all dilations and translations.  T is equivariant with respect to rotations.   Then, for some constant c , T = cR .  Relationship with the Laplacian  Somewhat imprecisely, the Riesz transforms of ƒ give the first partial derivatives of a solution of the equation          (   -  Δ   )    1  2    u   =  f   ,         superscript    normal-Δ     1  2    u   f    {(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}u=f},     where Δ is the Laplacian. Thus the Riesz transform of ƒ can be written as:      R  f  =  ∇    (  -  Δ  )    -   1  2     f     fragments  R  f   normal-∇   superscript   fragments  normal-(   Δ  normal-)       1  2     f    {Rf=\nabla(-\Delta)^{-\frac{1}{2}}f}     In particular, one should also have         R  i    R  j   Δ  u   =   -     ∂  2   u     ∂   x  i     ∂   x  j        ,         subscript  R  i    subscript  R  j   normal-Δ  u         superscript   2   u        subscript  x  i       subscript  x  j         R_{i}R_{j}\Delta u=-\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}},   so that the Riesz transforms give a way of recovering information about the entire hessian of a function from knowledge of only its Laplacian.  This is now made more precise. Suppose that u is a Schwartz function . Then indeed by the explicit form of the Fourier multiplier, one has         R  i    R  j    (   Δ  u   )    =   -     ∂  2   u     ∂   x  i     ∂   x  j        .         subscript  R  i    subscript  R  j     normal-Δ  u          superscript   2   u        subscript  x  i       subscript  x  j         R_{i}R_{j}(\Delta u)=-\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}.   The identity is not generally true in the sense of distributions . For instance, if u is a tempered distribution such that Δ u ∈ L 2 ( R d ), then one can only conclude that         ∂  2   u     ∂   x  i     ∂   x  j      =    -    R  i    R  j   Δ  u    +    P   i  j     (  x  )             superscript   2   u        subscript  x  i       subscript  x  j             subscript  R  i    subscript  R  j   normal-Δ  u       subscript  P    i  j    x      \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}=-R_{i}R_{j}\Delta u+P_{ij}(x)   for some polynomial P ij .

Boundedness on a dense subspace of L 2 implies that each Riesz transform admits a continuous linear extension to all of L 2 . ↩
