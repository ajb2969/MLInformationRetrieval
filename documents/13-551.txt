Supersingular prime (for an elliptic curve)

In algebraic number theory, a supersingular prime is a prime number with a certain relationship to a given elliptic curve. If the curve E defined over the rational numbers, then a prime p is '''supersingular for E'' if the reduction of E modulo p is a supersingular elliptic curve over the residue field F'p.
showed that any elliptic curve over the rational numbers has infinitely many supersingular primes. However, the set of supersingular primes has asymptotic density zero.  conjectured that the number of supersingular primes less than a bound X is within a constant multiple of 
 
 
 
 , using heuristics involving the distribution of Frobenius eigenvalues. , this conjecture is open.
More generally, if K is any global field—i.e., a finite extension either of Q or of Fp(t)—and A is an abelian variety defined over K, then a supersingular prime 
 
 
 
  for A is a finite place of K such that the reduction of A modulo 
 
 
 
  is a supersingular abelian variety.
