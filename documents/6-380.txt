Somos' quadratic recurrence constant

In mathematics, Somos' quadratic recurrence constant, named after Michael Somos, is the number



This can be easily re-written into the far more quickly converging product representation



The constant σ arises when studying the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence



with first few terms 1, 1, 2, 12, 576, 1658880 ... . This sequence can be shown to have asymptotic behaviour as follows:1



Guillera and Sondow give a representation in terms of the derivative of the Lerch transcendent:



where ln is the natural logarithm and 
 
 
 
 (z, s, q) is the Lerch transcendent.
Using series acceleration it is the sum of the n-th differences of ln(k) at k=1 as given by:



Finally,
