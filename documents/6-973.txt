   Flavor-changing neutral current      Flavor-changing neutral current   (Figure)   Above : Highly suppressed tau  decay via flavor-changing neutral current at one-loop order in the Standard Model .  Below : Beyond the Standard Model tau decay via flavor-changing neutral current mediated by a new S boson.   In theoretical physics , flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) are hypothetical expressions that change the flavor of a fermion current without altering its electric charge . If they occur in nature (as reflected by Lagrangian interaction terms), these processes may induce phenomena that have not yet been observed in experiment. Flavor-changing neutral currents may occur in the Standard Model beyond the tree level , but they are highly suppressed by the GIM mechanism . Several collaborations are looking for FCNC, without evidences. 1  FCNCs are generically predicted by theories that attempt to go beyond the Standard Model, such as the models of supersymmetry or technicolor . Their suppression is necessary for an agreement with observations, making FCNCs important in model-building.  Example  Consider a toy model in which an undiscovered boson  S may couple both to the electron as well as the tau via the term      S    ψ  ¯   e    ψ  τ       S   subscript   normal-¯  ψ   e    subscript  ψ  τ     S\bar{\psi}_{e}\psi_{\tau}   Since the electron and the tau have equal charges, the electric charge of S clearly must vanish to respect the conservation of electric charge. A Feynman diagram with S as the intermediate particle is able to convert a tau into an electron (plus some neutral decay products of the S ). The MEG experiment 2 at the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich will search for a similar process, in which an antimuon decays to a photon and an antielectron . In the Standard Model, such a process proceeds only by emission and re-absorption of a charged W boson , which changes the tau into a neutrino and then an electron, emitting a photon to conserve energy and momentum .  In most cases of interest, the boson involved is not a new boson S but the Z boson itself. 3 This can occur if the coupling to weak neutral currents is (slightly) non-universal. The dominant universal coupling to the Z boson does not change flavor, but sub-dominant non-universal contributions can.  FCNCs involving the Z boson for the down-type quarks at zero momentum transfer are usually parameterized by the effective action term       g   2   cos   θ  W        d  ¯    L  α     U   α  β     γ  μ    d   L  β     Z  μ         g    2     subscript  θ  W       subscript   normal-¯  d     L  α     subscript  U    α  β     superscript  γ  μ    subscript  d    L  β     subscript  Z  μ     \frac{g}{2\cos\theta_{W}}\overline{d}_{L\alpha}U_{\alpha\beta}\gamma^{\mu}d_{L%
 \beta}Z_{\mu}     This particular example of FCNC is often studied the most because we have some fairly strong constraints coming from the decay of B 0 mesons in Belle and BaBar . The off-diagonal entries of U parameterizes the FCNCs and current constraints restrict them to be less than one part in a thousand for | U bs |. The contribution coming from the one-loop SM corrections are actually dominant, but the experiments are precise enough to measure slight deviations from the SM prediction.  Experiments tend to focus on flavor-changing neutral currents as opposed to flavor-changing charged currents , because the weak neutral current (Z boson) does not change flavor in the Standard Model proper at the tree level whereas the weak charged currents ( W bosons ) do. New physics in charged current events would be swamped by more numerous W boson interactions; new physics in the neutral current would not be masked by a large effect due to ordinary Standard Model physics.
