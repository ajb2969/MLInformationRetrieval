N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase




N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase

In enzymology, a N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + L-arginine 
 
 
 
  N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and L-arginine, whereas its two products are N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:L-arginine N2-(2-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl) transferase (2-carboxyethyl-forming). Other names in common use include CEAS, N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthetase, CEA synthetase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:L-arginine 2-N-(2-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl), and transferase (2-carboxyethyl-forming). This enzyme participates in clavulanic acid biosynthesis.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
