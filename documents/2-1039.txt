   Õ      Õ    Not to be confused with Ő , O with double acute.        Õ   õ     "Õ" , or "õ" is a composition of the Latin letter O with the diacritic mark tilde .  The HTML entity is Õ for Õ and õ for õ.  Estonian  In Estonian , Õ is the 27th letter of the alphabet (between W and Ä ), representing the close-mid back unrounded vowel sound . The vowel had previously been marked with Ö , but in the early 19th century, Otto Wilhelm Masing adopted the letter Õ , ending the confusion between several homographs and clearly showing how to pronounce a word.  In informal writing, e.g., emails, instant messaging and when using foreign keyboard layouts where the letter Õ is not available, some Estonians use the characters O or 6 to approximate this letter.  In most dialects of the islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa , Õ is pronounced the same as Ö .  Portuguese  In the Portuguese language , the symbol Õ stands for a nasal  close-mid back rounded vowel , also written  in IPA. It is not considered an independent letter of the alphabet .  Vietnamese  In the Vietnamese language , the symbol Õ stands for the sound  with creaky voice (rising tone with a glottal break followed by a continuation of the rising tone). Vietnamese also has derived letters Ỗ / ỗ and Ỡ / ỡ .  Võro  In the Võro language , this letter is the 25th letter of the alphabet, pronounced as in Estonian. 1  Skolt Sami  In the Skolt Sami language , this letter is the 25th letter of the alphabet, pronounced quite like in Estonian and Võro.  Mathematical use  The symbol, pronounced soft-O , is used as a variant of big O notation that ignores logarithmic factors. Thus,     f   (  n  )    =    O  ~    (   g   (  n  )    )          f  n      normal-~  O     g  n      f(n)=\tilde{O}(g(n))   is shorthand for     f   (  n  )    =   O   (   g   (  n  )     log  k   g    (  n  )    )          f  n     O    g  n    superscript   k   g   n      f(n)=O(g(n)\log^{k}g(n))   for some k .  Computer encoding  Due to character encoding confusion, the letters can be seen on many incorrectly coded Hungarian web pages, representing Ő / ő (letter O with double acute accent ). This can happen due to said characters sharing a code point in the ISO 8859-1 and 8859-2 character sets, as well as the Windows-1252 and Windows-1250 character sets, and the web site designer forgetting to set the correct code page . Õ is not part of the Hungarian alphabet. The usage of Unicode avoids this type of problems.
