Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  is a normed vector space and 
 
 
 
 
  is a nonempty convex subset of 
 
 
 
  which is compact under the weak topology, then every group (or equivalently: every semigroup) of affine isometries of 
 
 
 
  has at least one fixed point. (Here, a fixed point of a set of maps is a point that is fixed by each map in the set.)
This theorem was announced by Czesław Ryll-Nardzewski.1 Later Namioka and Asplund 2 gave a proof based on a different approach. Ryll-Nardzewski himself gave a complete proof in the original spirit.3
Applications
The Ryll-Nardzewski theorem yields the existence of a Haar measure on compact groups.4
