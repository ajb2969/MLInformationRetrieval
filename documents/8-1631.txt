   Coordinate-induced basis      Coordinate-induced basis   In mathematics , a coordinate-induced basis is a basis for the tangent space or cotangent space of a manifold that is induced by a certain coordinate system. Given the coordinate system    x  a     superscript  x  a    x^{a}   , the coordinate-induced basis    e  a     subscript  e  a    e_{a}   of the tangent space is given by       e  a   =   ∂   ∂   x  a          subscript  e  a         superscript  x  a       e_{a}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{a}}   and the dual basis    ω  a     superscript  ω  a    \omega^{a}   of the cotangent space is        ω  a   =   d   x  a     .       superscript  ω  a     d   superscript  x  a      \omega^{a}=dx^{a}.\,     References   D.J.
