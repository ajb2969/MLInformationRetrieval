Coordinate-induced basis

In mathematics, a coordinate-induced basis is a basis for the tangent space or cotangent space of a manifold that is induced by a certain coordinate system. Given the coordinate system 
 
 
 
 , the coordinate-induced basis 
 
 
 
  of the tangent space is given by


 
  and the dual basis 
 
 
 
  of the cotangent space is
