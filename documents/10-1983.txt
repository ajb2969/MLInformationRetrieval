L-fuculose-phosphate aldolase




L-fuculose-phosphate aldolase

In enzymology, a L-fuculose-phosphate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-fuculose-1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  glycerone phosphate + (S)-lactaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-fuculose-1-phosphate, and two products, glycerone phosphate and (S)-lactaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-fuculose-1-phosphate (S)-lactaldehyde-lyase (glycerone-phosphate-forming). Other names in common use include L-fuculose 1-phosphate aldolase, fuculose aldolase, and L-fuculose-1-phosphate lactaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
