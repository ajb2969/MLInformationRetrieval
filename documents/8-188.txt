Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem

In mathematics, the Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem is a result from intersection theory in algebraic geometry, for the case of subvarieties of projective space with codimension large enough to make the intersection have components of dimension at least 1.
The formal statement is that if V and W are irreducible algebraic subvarieties of a projective space P, all over an algebraically closed field, and if

dim(V) + dim (W) > dim (P)
 

in terms of the dimension of an algebraic variety, then the intersection U of V and W is connected.
More generally, the theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  is a projective variety and 
 
 
 
  is any morphism such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is connected, where 
 
 
 
  is the diagonal in 
 
 
 
 . The special case of intersections is recovered by taking 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  the natural inclusion.
