   Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem      Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem   In mathematics , the Fulton–Hansen connectedness theorem is a result from intersection theory in algebraic geometry , for the case of subvarieties of projective space with codimension large enough to make the intersection have components of dimension at least 1.  The formal statement is that if V and W are irreducible algebraic subvarieties of a projective space  P , all over an algebraically closed field , and if   dim( V ) + dim ( W ) > dim ( P )   in terms of the dimension of an algebraic variety , then the intersection U of V and W is connected .  More generally, the theorem states that if   Z   Z   Z   is a projective variety and    f  :   Z  →    P  n   ×   P  n        normal-:  f   normal-→  Z     superscript  P  n    superscript  P  n       f:Z\to P^{n}\times P^{n}   is any morphism such that     dim   f   (  Z  )     >  n       dimension    f  Z    n    \dim f(Z)>n   , then     f   -  1    Δ       superscript  f    1    normal-Δ    f^{-1}\Delta   is connected, where   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is the diagonal in     P  n   ×   P  n        superscript  P  n    superscript  P  n     P^{n}\times P^{n}   . The special case of intersections is recovered by taking    Z  =   V  ×  W       Z    V  W     Z=V\times W   , with   f   f   f   the natural inclusion.
