   Chen Jingrun      Chen Jingrun   Chen Jingrun (, May 22, 1933 – March 19, 1996) was a Chinese  mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory .  Personal life  Chen was the third son in a large family from Fuzhou , Fujian , China . His father was a postal worker. Chen Jingrun graduated from the Mathematics Department of Xiamen University in 1953. His advisor at Chinese Academy of Sciences was Hua Luogeng .  Research  His work on the twin prime conjecture , Waring's problem , Goldbach's conjecture and Legendre's conjecture led to progress in analytic number theory . In a 1966 paper he proved what is now called Chen's theorem : every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes) — e.g., 100 = 23 + 7·11.  Commemorations  The Asteroid  7681 Chenjingrun was named after him.  In 1999, China issued an 80-cent postage stamp, titled The Best Result of Goldbach Conjecture, with a silhouette of Chen and the inequality:         P  x    (  1  ,  2  )    ≥    0.67  x   C  x      (   log  x   )   2     .         subscript  P  x    1  2        0.67  x   subscript  C  x     superscript    x   2      P_{x}(1,2)\geq\frac{0.67xC_{x}}{(\log x)^{2}}.     Several statues in China have been built in memory of Chen. At Xiamen University, the names of Chen and four other mathematicians — Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet , Matti Jutila , Yuri Linnik , and Pan Chengdong — are inscribed in the marble slab behind Chen's statue (see image).
