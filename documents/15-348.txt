   Tsen rank      Tsen rank   In mathematics , the Tsen rank of a field describes conditions under which a system of polynomial equations must have a solution in the field . The concept is named for C. C. Tsen , who introduced their study in 1936.  We consider a system of m polynomial equations in n variables over a field F . Assume that the equations all have constant term zero, so that (0, 0, ... ,0) is a common solution. We say that F is a T ''i '' - field if every such system, of degrees d 1 , ..., d m has a common non-zero solution whenever       n  >    d  1  i   +  ⋯  +   d  m  i     .      n     superscript   subscript  d  1   i   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  d  m   i      n>d_{1}^{i}+\cdots+d_{m}^{i}.\,     The Tsen rank of F is the smallest i such that F is a T i -field. We say that the Tsen rank of F is infinite if it is not a T i -field for any i (for example, if it is formally real ).  Properties   A field has Tsen rank zero if and only if it is algebraically closed .  A finite field has Tsen rank 1: this is the Chevalley–Warning theorem .  If F is algebraically closed then rational function field F ( X ) has Tsen rank 1.  If F has Tsen rank i , then the rational function field F ( X ) has Tsen rank at most i + 1.  If F has Tsen rank i , then an algebraic extension of F has Tsen rank at most i .  If F has Tsen rank i , then an extension of F of transcendence degree  k has Tsen rank at most i + k .  There exist fields of Tsen rank i for every integer i ≥ 0.   Norm form  We define a norm form of level i on a field F to be a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n = d i variables with only the trivial zero over F (we exclude the case n = d =1). The existence of a norm form on level i on F implies that F is of Tsen rank at least i − 1. If E is an extension of F of finite degree n > 1, then the field norm form for E / F is a norm form of level 1. If F admits a norm form of level i then the rational function field F ( X ) admits a norm form of level i + 1. This allows us to demonstrate the existence of fields of any given Tsen rank.  Diophantine dimension  The Diophantine dimension of a field is the smallest natural number k , if it exists, such that the field of is class C k : that is, such that any homogeneous polynomial of degree d in N variables has a non-trivial zero whenever N > d k . Algebraically closed fields are of Diophantine dimension 0; quasi-algebraically closed fields of dimension 1. 1  Clearly if a field is T i then it is C i , and T 0 and C 0 are equivalent, each being equivalent to being algebraically closed. It is not known whether Tsen rank and Diophantine dimension are equal in general.  See also   Tsen's theorem   References      "  Category:Field theory  Category:Diophantine geometry     ↩
