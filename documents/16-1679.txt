   Duct modes      Duct modes   The acoustic pressure in a cylindrical duct can be expressed as the superposition of duct modes:      p  =   ∑    α  i    ϕ  i         p       subscript  α  i    subscript  ϕ  i       p=\sum\alpha_{i}\phi_{i}     where    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   is the participation factor or modal amplitude and    ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   is the mode shape. The duct mode shape are analytically determined from the solution of the Helmholtz equation . 1  References  '       John M. Tyler, Thomas G. Sofrin. Axial flow compressor noise studies. No. 620532.
