Duct modes

The acoustic pressure in a cylindrical duct can be expressed as the superposition of duct modes:



where 
 
 
 
  is the participation factor or modal amplitude and 
 
 
 
  is the mode shape. The duct mode shape are analytically determined from the solution of the Helmholtz equation.1
