Pyridoxamine—pyruvate transaminase

In enzymology, a pyridoxamine-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

pyridoxamine + pyruvate 
 
 
 
  pyridoxal + L-alanine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxamine and pyruvate, whereas its two products are pyridoxal and L-alanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxamine:pyruvate aminotransferase. This enzyme is also called pyridoxamine-pyruvic transaminase. This enzyme participates in vitamin B6 metabolism.
