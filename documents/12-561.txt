   Continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space      Continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space   In mathematical analysis , and especially functional analysis , a fundamental role is played by the space of continuous functions on a compact  Hausdorff space with values in the real or complex numbers . This space, denoted by C ( X ), is a vector space with respect to the pointwise addition of functions and scalar multiplication by constants. It is, moreover, a normed space with norm defined by        ∥  f  ∥   =    sup   x  ∈  X     |   f   (  x  )    |     ,       norm  f     subscript  supremum    x  X        f  x       \|f\|=\sup_{x\in X}|f(x)|,     the uniform norm . The uniform norm defines the topology of uniform convergence of functions on X . The space C ( X ) is a Banach algebra with respect to this norm.  Properties   By Urysohn's lemma , C ( X ) separates points of X : If x , y ∈ X and x ≠ y , then there is an f ∈ C ( X ) such that f ( x ) ≠ f ( y ).    The space C ( X ) is infinite-dimensional whenever X is an infinite space (since it separates points). Hence, in particular, it is generally not locally compact .    The Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem gives a characterization of the continuous dual space of C ( X ). Specifically, this dual space is the space of Radon measures on X (regular Borel measures ), denoted by rca ( X ). This space, with the norm given by the total variation of a measure, is also a Banach space belonging to the class of ba spaces .    Positive linear functionals on C ( X ) correspond to (positive) regular  Borel measures on X , by a different form of the Riesz representation theorem.    If X is infinite, then C ( X ) is not reflexive , nor is it weakly  complete .    The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem holds: A subset K of C ( X ) is relatively compact if and only if it is bounded in the norm of C ( X ), and equicontinuous .    The Stone-Weierstrass theorem holds for C ( X ). In the case of real functions, if A is a subring of C ( X ) that contains all constants and separates points, then the closure of A is C ( X ). In the case of complex functions, the statement holds with the additional hypothesis that A is closed under complex conjugation .    If X and Y are two compact Hausdorff spaces, and F : C ( X ) → C ( Y ) is a homomorphism of algebras which commutes with complex conjugation, then F is continuous. Furthermore, F has the form F ( h )( y ) = h ( f ( y )) for some continuous function ƒ : Y → X . In particular, if C ( X ) and C ( Y ) are isomorphic as algebras, then X and Y are homeomorphic topological spaces.    Let Δ be the space of maximal ideals in C ( X ). Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between Δ and the points of X . Furthermore Δ can be identified with the collection of all complex homomorphisms C ( X ) → C . Equip Δ with the initial topology with respect to this pairing with C ( X ) (i.e., the Gelfand transform ). Then X is homeomorphic to Δ equipped with this topology.    A sequence in C ( X ) is weakly  Cauchy if and only if it is (uniformly) bounded in C ( X ) and pointwise convergent. In particular, C ( X ) is only weakly complete for X a finite set.    The vague topology is the weak* topology on the dual of C ( X ).    The Banach–Alaoglu theorem implies that any normed space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of C ( X ) for some X .   Generalizations  The space C ( X ) of real or complex-valued continuous functions can be defined on any topological space X . In the non-compact case, however, C ( X ) is not in general a Banach space with respect to the uniform norm since it may contain unbounded functions. Hence it is more typical to consider the space, denoted here C B ( X ) of bounded continuous functions on X . This is a Banach space (in fact a commutative Banach algebra with identity) with respect to the uniform norm.  It is sometimes desirable, particularly in measure theory , to further refine this general definition by considering the special case when X is a locally compact Hausdorff space. In this case, it is possible to identify a pair of distinguished subsets of C B ( X ):   C 00 ( X ), the subset of C ( X ) consisting of functions with compact support . This is called the space of functions vanishing in a neighborhood of infinity .    C 0 ( X ), the subset of C ( X ) consisting of functions such that for every ε > 0, there is a compact set K ⊂ X such that | f ( x )| < ε for all x ∈ X \ K . This is called the space of functions vanishing at infinity .   The closure of C 00 ( X ) is precisely C 0 ( X ). In particular, the latter is a Banach space.  References    .   .   .   .
