   Cystathionine beta-lyase      Cystathionine beta-lyase   In enzymology , a cystathionine beta-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-cystathionine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-homocysteine + NH 3 + pyruvate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-cystathionine and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are L-homocysteine , NH 3 , and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cystathionine L-homocysteine-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include beta-cystathionase , cystine lyase , cystathionine L-homocysteine-lyase (deaminating) , and L-cystathionine L-homocysteine-lyase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways : methionine metabolism , cysteine metabolism , selenoamino acid metabolism , nitrogen metabolism , and sulfur metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
