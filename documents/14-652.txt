Liouville gravity

Liouville gravity12 is a model of gravity in one spatial and one time dimension with a dilaton. It has the specific coupling of the form



where Φ is the dilaton field. It should not be confused34 with the CGHS model or Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity. After taking quantum conformal anomalies into account, it turns out to be a conformal field theory. This model is used in the study of non-critical string theory.
