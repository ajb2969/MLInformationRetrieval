   Hochster–Roberts theorem      Hochster–Roberts theorem   In algebra , the Hochster–Roberts theorem , introduced by , states that rings of invariants of reductive groups acting on regular rings are Cohen–Macaulay .  In other words, 1   If V is a rational representation of a reductive group G over a field  k , then there exist algebraically independent invariant homogeneous polynomials     f  1   ,  ⋯  ,   f  d       subscript  f  1   normal-⋯   subscript  f  d     f_{1},\cdots,f_{d}   such that    k    [  V  ]   G       k   superscript   delimited-[]  V   G     k[V]^{G}   is a free finite graded module over    k   [   f  1   ,  ⋯  ,   f  d   ]       k    subscript  f  1   normal-⋯   subscript  f  d      k[f_{1},\cdots,f_{d}]   .   proved that if a variety has rational singularities then so does its quotient by the action of a reductive group; this implies the Hochster–Roberts theorem as rational singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.
