   Geodesic manifold      Geodesic manifold   In mathematics , a complete manifold (or geodesically complete manifold ) is a ( pseudo -) Riemannian manifold for which every maximal (inextendible) geodesic is defined on   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   .  Examples  All compact manifolds and all homogeneous manifolds are geodesically complete.  Euclidean space     ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , the spheres     𝕊  n     superscript  𝕊  n    \mathbb{S}^{n}   and the tori     𝕋  n     superscript  𝕋  n    \mathbb{T}^{n}   (with their natural Riemannian metrics ) are all complete manifolds.  A simple example of a non-complete manifold is given by the punctured plane    M  :=    ℝ  2   ∖   {  0  }       assign  M     superscript  ℝ  2    0      M:=\mathbb{R}^{2}\setminus\{0\}   (with its induced metric). Geodesics going to the origin cannot be defined on the entire real line.  Path-connectedness, completeness and geodesic completeness  It can be shown that a finite-dimensional path-connected Riemannian manifold is a complete metric space (with respect to the Riemannian distance ) if and only if it is geodesically complete. This is the Hopf–Rinow theorem . This theorem does not hold for infinite-dimensional manifolds. The example of a non-complete manifold (the punctured plane) given above fails to be geodesically complete because, although it is path-connected, it is not a complete metric space: any sequence in the plane converging to the origin is a non-converging Cauchy sequence in the punctured plane.
