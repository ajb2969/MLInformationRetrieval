   Pi Hydrae      Pi Hydrae   Pi Hydrae (π Hya, π Hydrae) is a star in the constellation  Hydra with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.3, 1 making it visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements put this star at a distance of about  from the Earth.  The spectrum of this star shows it to have a stellar classification of K1 III-IV, 2 with the luminosity class of 'III-IV' suggesting it is in an evolutionary transition stage somewhere between a subgiant and a giant star . It has a low projected rotational velocity of 2.25 km s −1 . 3 Pi Hydrae is radiating energy from its outer envelope with an effective temperature of 4,670 K, 4 giving it the orange hue of a K-type star. 5  Pi Hydrae is a type of giant known as a cyanogen -weak star, which means that its spectrum displays weak absorption lines of CN − relative to the metallicity . (The last is a term astronomers use when describing the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium.) Otherwise, it appears to be a normal star of its evolutionary class, having undergone first dredge-up of nuclear fusion by-products onto its surface layers. 6 The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening , is . 7 At its estimated distance, this yields a physical size of about 12–13 times the radius of the Sun . 8 It has an estimated mass of 2.45 times the mass of the Sun . 9  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 25.1\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 10  11  12  13  }}  External links     "  Hydrae, Pi  Category:Hydra (constellation)              ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
