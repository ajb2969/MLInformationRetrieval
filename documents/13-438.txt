Calabi–Eckmann manifold

In complex geometry, a part of mathematics, a Calabi–Eckmann manifold (or, often, Calabi–Eckmann space), named after Eugenio Calabi and Beno Eckmann, is a complex, homogeneous, non-Kähler manifold, homeomorphic to a product of two odd-dimensional spheres of dimension ≥ 3.
The Calabi–Eckmann manifold is constructed as follows. Consider the space 
 
 
 
 , m,n > 1, equipped with an action of a group 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
 
  is a fixed complex number. It is easy to check that this action is free and proper, and the corresponding orbit space M is homeomorphic to S2n−1 × S2m−1. Since M is a quotient space of a holomorphic action, it is also a complex manifold. It is obviously homogeneous, with a transitive holomorphic action of 
 
 

A Calabi–Eckmann manifold M is non-Kähler, because 
 
 
 
 . It is the simplest example of a non-Kähler manifold which is simply connected (in dimension 2, all simply connected compact complex manifolds are Kähler).
The natural projection



induces a holomorphic map from the corresponding Calabi–Eckmann manifold M to 
 
 
 
 . The fiber of this map is an elliptic curve T, obtained as a quotient of 
 
 
 
 
  by the lattice 
 
 
 
 . This makes M into a principal T-bundle.
Calabi and Eckmann discovered these manifolds in 1953.1
