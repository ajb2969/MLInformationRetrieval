Lindeberg's condition




Lindeberg's condition

In probability theory, Lindeberg's condition is a sufficient condition (and under certain conditions also a necessary condition) for the central limit theorem (CLT) to hold for a sequence of independent random variables. Unlike the classical CLT, which requires that the random variables in question have finite mean and variance and be both independent and identically distributed, Lindeberg's CLT only requires that they have finite mean and variance, satisfy Lindeberg's condition, and be independent. It is named after the Finnish mathematician Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a probability space, and 
 
 
 
 , be independent random variables defined on that space. Assume the expected values 
 
 
 
  and variances 
 
 
 
  exist and are finite. Also let 
 
 

If this sequence of independent random variables 
 
 
 
  satisfies Lindeberg's condition:


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 1{â€¦} is the indicator function, then the central limit theorem holds, i.e. the random variables



converge in distribution to a standard normal random variable as 
 
 

Lindeberg's condition is sufficient, but not in general necessary (i.e. the inverse implication does not hold in general). However, if the sequence of independent random variables in question satisfies



then Lindeberg's condition is both sufficient and necessary, i.e. it holds if and only if the result of central limit theorem holds.
Interpretation
Because the Lindeberg condition implies 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , it guarantees that the contribution of any individual random variable 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 ) to the variance 
 
 
 
  is arbitrarily small, for sufficiently large values of 
 
 
 
 .
