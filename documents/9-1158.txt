Dependency relation

In mathematics and computer science, a dependency relation is a binary relation that is finite, symmetric, and reflexive; i.e. a finite tolerance relation. That is, it is a finite set of ordered pairs

 
 , such that

If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  (symmetric)
If 
 
 
 
 
  is an element of the set on which the relation is defined, then 
 
 
 
  (reflexive)

In general, dependency relations are not transitive; thus, they generalize the notion of an equivalence relation by discarding transitivity.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the alphabet of all the letters of 
 
 
 
 . Then the independency induced by 
 
 
 
  is the binary relation 
 
 




That is, the independency is the set of all ordered pairs that are not in 
 
 
 
 . The independency is symmetric and irreflexive.
The pairs 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , or the triple 
 
 
 
 
  (with 
 
 
 
  induced by 
 
 
 
 ) are sometimes called the concurrent alphabet or the reliance alphabet.
The pairs of letters in an independency relation induce an equivalence relation on the free monoid of all possible strings of finite length. The elements of the equivalence classes induced by the independency are called traces, and are studied in trace theory.
Examples
200px|right Consider the alphabet 
 
 
 
 . A possible dependency relation is



The corresponding independency is



Therefore, the letters 
 
 
 
  commute, or are independent of one another.
