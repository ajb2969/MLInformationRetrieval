   Peroxydisulfate      Peroxydisulfate   The peroxydisulfate ion, S 2 O 8 2− , is a oxyanion . It is commonly referred to as the persulfate ion, but this term also refers to the peroxomonosulfate ion, SO 5 2− . Approximately 500,000 tons of salts containing this anion are produced annually. Important salts include sodium persulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 8 ), potassium persulfate (K 2 S 2 O 8 ), and ammonium persulfate ((NH 4 ) 2 S 2 O 8 ). These salts are colourless, water-soluble solids that are strong oxidants. 1  Applications  Salts of peroxydisulfate are mainly used to initiate the polymerization of various alkenes, including styrene, acryonitrile, and fluoroalkenes. Polymerization is initiated by the homolysis of the peroxydisulfate:    [O 3 SO-OSO 3 ] 2−     ←  →     normal-→  normal-←    \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}   2 [SO 4 ]• −      In addition to its major commercial applications, peroxydisulfate participates in reactions of interest in the laboratory:   Elbs persulfate oxidation  Oxidation of Ag + to Ag 2+   References    "  *  Category:Sulfur oxoanions     ↩
