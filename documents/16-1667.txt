Saddlepoint approximation method

The saddlepoint approximation method, initially proposed by  Daniels (1954) is a specific example of the mathematical  saddlepoint  technique applied to statistics. It provides a highly accurate approximation formula for any  PDF or probability mass function of a distribution, based on the  moment generating function. There is also a formula for the  CDF  of the distribution, proposed by Lugannani and Rice (1980).
Definition
If the moment generating function of a distribution is written as 
 
 
 
  and the cumulant generating function as 
 
 
 
  then the saddlepoint approximation to the PDF of a distribution is defined as:


 
  and the saddlepoint approximation to the CDF is defined as:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the solution to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and
