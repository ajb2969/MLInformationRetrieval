3-hydroxyindolin-2-one monooxygenase

3-hydroxyindolin-2-one monooxygenase (, BX4 (gene), CYP71C1 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 3-hydroxyindolin-2-one,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3-hydroxyindolin-2-one + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  2-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one + NAD(P)+ + H2O
 

3-hydroxyindolin-2-one monooxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of protective and allelophatic benzoxazinoids in some plants.
