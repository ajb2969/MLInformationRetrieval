   Mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase      Mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannitol 1-phosphate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose 6-phosphate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannitol 1-phosphate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are fructose 6-phosphate , NADH and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannitol-1-phosphate:NAD + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include hexose reductase , mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase , D-mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase , and fructose 6-phosphate reductase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.  See also   D-Mannitol   References       "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure
