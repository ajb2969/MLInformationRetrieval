   Coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase      Coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   coproporphyrinogen III + 2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protoporphyrinogen IX + 2 CO 2 + 2 L-methionine + 2 5'-deoxyadenosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are coproporphyrinogen III and S-adenosyl-L-methionine , whereas its 4 products are protoporphyrinogen IX , CO 2 , L- methionine , and 5'-deoxy adenosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is coproporphyrinogen-III:S-adenosyl-L-methionine oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase , HemN , radical SAM enzyme , and coproporphyrinogen III oxidase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.  References      "  Category:EC 1.3.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
