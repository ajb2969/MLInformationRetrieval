   Approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra      Approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra   In mathematics , an approximately finite-dimensional (AF) C*-algebra is a C*-algebra that is the inductive limit of a sequence of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Approximate finite-dimensionality was first defined and described combinatorially by Bratteli . Elliott gave a complete classification of AF algebras using the K 0 functor whose range consists of ordered abelian groups with sufficiently nice order structure.  The classification theorem for AF algebras serves as a prototype for classification results for larger classes of separable simple nuclear stably finite C*-algebras. Its proof divides into two parts. The invariant here is K 0 with its natural order structure; this is a functor . First, one proves existence : a homomorphism between invariants must lift to a *-homomorphism of algebras. Second, one shows uniqueness : the lift must be unique up to approximate unitary equivalence. Classification then follows from what is known as the intertwining argument . For unital AF algebras, both existence and uniqueness follow from the fact the Murray-von Neumann semigroup of projections in an AF algebra is cancellative.  The counterpart of simple AF C*-algebras in the von Neumann algebra world are the hyperfinite factors, which were classified by Connes and Haagerup .  In the context of noncommutative geometry and topology , AF C*-algebras are non-commutative generalizations of C 0 ( X ), where X is a totally disconnected metrizable space.  Definition and basic properties  Finite-dimensional C*-algebras  An arbitrary finite-dimensional C*-algebra A takes the following form, up to isomorphism:        ⊕  k    M   n  k     ,      subscript  direct-sum  k    subscript  M   subscript  n  k      \oplus_{k}M_{n_{k}},     where M i denotes the full matrix algebra of i × i matrices.  Up to unitary equivalence, a unital *-homomorphism Φ : M i → M j is necessarily of the form        Φ   (  a  )    =   a  ⊗   I  r     ,        normal-Φ  a    tensor-product  a   subscript  I  r      \Phi(a)=a\otimes I_{r},     where r · i = j . The number r is said to be the multiplicity of Φ. In general, a unital homomorphism between finite-dimensional C*-algebras      Φ  :     ⊕  1  s    M   n  k     →    ⊕  1  t    M   m  l         normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-→    superscript   subscript  direct-sum  1   s    subscript  M   subscript  n  k       superscript   subscript  direct-sum  1   t    subscript  M   subscript  m  l        \Phi:\oplus_{1}^{s}M_{n_{k}}\rightarrow\oplus_{1}^{t}M_{m_{l}}     is specified, up to unitary equivalence, by a t × s matrix of partial multiplicities ( r l k ) satisfying, for all l         ∑  k     r   l  k     n  k     =   m  l    .        subscript   k      subscript  r    l  k     subscript  n  k      subscript  m  l     \sum_{k}r_{lk}n_{k}=m_{l}.\;     In the non-unital case, the equality is replaced by ≤. Graphically, Φ, equivalently ( r l k ), can be represented by its Bratteli diagram . The Bratteli diagram is a directed graph with nodes corresponding to each n k and m l and the number of arrows from n k to m l is the partial multiplicity r lk .  Consider the category whose objects are isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional C*-algebras and whose morphisms are *-homomorphisms modulo unitary equivalence. By the above discussion, the objects can be viewed as vectors with entries in N and morphisms are the partial multiplicity matrices.  AF algebras  A C*-algebra is AF if it is the direct limit of a sequence of finite-dimensional C*-algebras:       A  =    lim  →   ⋯   →    A  i     →   α  i     A   i  +  1    →  ⋯   ,        A   injective-limit  normal-⋯     normal-→     subscript  A  i      superscript  normal-→   subscript  α  i       subscript  A    i  1      normal-→    normal-⋯     A=\underrightarrow{\lim}\cdots\rightarrow A_{i}\,\stackrel{\alpha_{i}}{%
 \rightarrow}A_{i+1}\rightarrow\cdots,     where each A i is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra and the connecting maps α i are *-homomorphisms. We will assume that each α i is unital. The inductive system specifying an AF algebra is not unique. One can always drop to a subsequence. Suppressing the connecting maps, A can also be written as       A  =     ∪  n    A  n    ¯    .      A   normal-¯    subscript   n    subscript  A  n       A=\overline{\cup_{n}A_{n}}.     The Bratteli diagram of A is formed by the Bratteli diagrams of { α i } in the obvious way. For instance, the Pascal triangle , with the nodes connected by appropriate downward arrows, is the Bratteli diagram of an AF algebra. A Bratteli diagram of the CAR algebra is give on the right. The two arrows between nodes means each connecting map is an embedding of multiplicity 2.      1  ⇉  2  ⇉  4  ⇉  8  ⇉  …       normal-⇉  1  2    normal-⇉    4    normal-⇉    8    normal-⇉    normal-…     1\rightrightarrows 2\rightrightarrows 4\rightrightarrows 8\rightrightarrows\dots      (A Bratteli diagram of the CAR algebra)   If an AF algebra A = (∪ n A n ) − , then an ideal J in A takes the form ∪ n ( J ∩ A n ) − . In particular, J is itself an AF algebra. Given a Bratteli diagram of A and some subset S of nodes, the subdiagram generated by S gives inductive system that specifies an ideal of A . In fact, every ideal arises in this way.  Due to the presence of matrix units in the inductive sequence, AF algebras have the following local characterization: a C*-algebra A is AF if and only if A is separable and any finite subset of A is "almost contained" in some finite-dimensional C*-subalgebra.  The projections in ∪ n A n in fact form an approximate unit of A .  It is clear that the extension of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra by another finite-dimensional C*-algebra is again finite-dimensional. More generally, the extension of an AF algebra by another AF algebra is again AF. This is known as Brown's theorem .  Classification  K 0  The K-theoretic group K 0 is an invariant of C*-algebras. It has its origins in topological K-theory and serves as the range of a kind of "dimension function." For an AF algebra A , K 0 ( A ) can be defined as follows. Let M n ( A ) be the C*-algebra of n × n matrices whose entries are elements A . M n ( A ) can be embedded into M n + 1 ( A ) canonically, into the "upper left corner". Consider the algebraic direct limit         M  ∞    (  A  )    =    lim  →   ⋯   →    M  n    (  A  )    →    M   n  +  1     (  A  )    →  ⋯   .           subscript  M    A    injective-limit  normal-⋯     normal-→       subscript  M  n   A     normal-→       subscript  M    n  1    A     normal-→    normal-⋯     M_{\infty}(A)=\underrightarrow{\lim}\cdots\rightarrow M_{n}(A)\rightarrow M_{n%
 +1}(A)\rightarrow\cdots.     Denote the projections (self-adjoint idempotents) in this algebra by P ( A ). Two elements p and q are said to be Murray-von Neumann equivalent , denoted by p ~ q , if p = vv* and q = v*v for some partial isometry  v in M ∞ ( A ). It is clear that ~ is an equivalence relation. Define a binary operation + on the set of equivalences P ( A )/~ by        [  p  ]   +   [  q  ]    =   [   p  ⊕  q   ]          delimited-[]  p    delimited-[]  q     delimited-[]   direct-sum  p  q      [p]+[q]=[p\oplus q]     where ⊕ is the orthogonal direct sum . This makes P ( A )/~ a semigroup that has the cancellation property . We denote this semigroup by K 0 ( A ) + . Performing the Grothendieck group construction gives an abelian group, which is K 0 ( A ).  K 0 ( A ) carries a natural order structure: we say [ p ] ≤ [ q ] if p is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to a subprojection of q . This makes K 0 ( A ) an ordered group whose positive cone is K 0 ( A ) + .  For example, for a finite-dimensional C*-algebra       A  =    ⊕   k  =  1   m    M   n  k      ,      A    superscript   subscript  direct-sum    k  1    m    subscript  M   subscript  n  k       A=\oplus_{k=1}^{m}M_{n_{k}},     one has        (    K  0    (  A  )    ,    K  0     (  A  )   +    )   =   (   ℤ  m   ,   ℤ  +  m   )    .          subscript  K  0   A      subscript  K  0    superscript  A        superscript  ℤ  m    superscript   subscript  ℤ    m      (K_{0}(A),K_{0}(A)^{+})=(\mathbb{Z}^{m},\mathbb{Z}_{+}^{m}).     Two essential features of the mapping A    ↦   maps-to   \mapsto    K 0 ( A ) are:   K 0 is a (covariant) functor . A *-homomorphism α : A → B between AF algebras induces a group homomorphism α * : K 0 ( A ) → K 0 ( B ). In particular, when A and B are both finite-dimensional, α * can be identified with the partial multiplicities matrix of α .  K 0 respects direct limits. If A = ∪ n α n ( A n ) − , then K 0 ( A ) is the direct limit ∪ n α n * ( K 0 ( A n )).   The dimension group  Since M ∞ ( M ∞ ( A )) is isomorphic to M ∞ ( A ), K 0 can only distinguish AF algebras up to stable isomorphism . For example, M 2 and M 4 are not isomorphic but stably isomorphic; K 0 ( M 2 ) = K 0 ( M 4 ) = Z .  A finer invariant is needed to detect isomorphism classes. For an AF algebra A , we define the scale of K 0 ( A ), denoted by Γ( A ), to be the subset whose elements are represented by projections in A :        Γ   (  A  )    =   {   [  p  ]   |    p  *   =   p  2   =  p  ∈  A   }    .        normal-Γ  A    conditional-set   delimited-[]  p        superscript  p     superscript  p  2        p       A       \Gamma(A)=\{[p]\,|\,p^{*}=p^{2}=p\in A\}.     When A is unital with unit 1 A , the K 0 element [1 A ] is the maximal element of Γ( A ) and in fact,        Γ   (  A  )    =   {   x  ∈    K  0    (  A  )     |   0  ≤  x  ≤   [   1  A   ]    }    .        normal-Γ  A    conditional-set    x     subscript  K  0   A        0  x        delimited-[]   subscript  1  A         \Gamma(A)=\{x\in K_{0}(A)\,|\,0\leq x\leq[1_{A}]\}.     The triple ( K 0 , K 0 + , Γ( A )) is called the dimension group of A . If A = M s , its dimension group is ( Z , Z + , {1, 2,..., s }).  A group homomorphism between dimension group is said to be contractive if it is scale-preserving. Two dimension group are said to be isomorphic if there exists a contractive group isomorphism between them.  The dimension group retains the essential properties of K 0 :   A *-homomorphism α : A → B between AF algebras in fact induces a contractive group homomorphism α * on the dimension groups. When A and B are both finite-dimensional, corresponding to each partial multiplicities matrix ψ , there is a unique, up to unitary equivalence, *-homomorphism α : A → B such that α * = ψ .  If A = ∪ n α n ( A n ) − , then the dimension group of A is the direct limit of those of A n .   Elliott's theorem  (Figure)  Commutative diagrams for Elliott's theorem.   Elliott's theorem says that the dimension group is a complete invariant of AF algebras: two AF algebras A and B are isomorphic if and only if their dimension groups are isomorphic.  Two preliminary facts are needed before one can sketch a proof of Elliott's theorem. The first one summarizes the above discussion on finite-dimensional C*-algebras.  Lemma For two finite-dimensional C*-algebras A and B , and a contractive homomorphism ψ : K 0 ( A ) → K 0 ( B ), there exists a *-homomorphism φ : A → B such that φ * = ψ , and φ is unique up to unitary equivalence.  The lemma can be extended to the case where B is AF. A map ψ on the level of K 0 can be "moved back", on the level of algebras, to some finite stage in the inductive system.  Lemma Let A be finite-dimensional and B AF, B = (∪ n B n ) − . Let β m be the canonical homomorphism of B m into B . Then for any a contractive homomorphism ψ : K 0 ( A ) → K 0 ( B ), there exists a *-homomorphism φ : A → B m such that β m* φ * = ψ , and φ is unique up to unitary equivalence in B .  The proof of the lemma is based on the simple observation that K 0 ( A ) is finitely generated and, since K 0 respects direct limits, K 0 ( B ) = ∪ n  β n*  K 0 ( B n ).  Theorem (Elliott) Two AF algebras A and B are isomorphic if and only if their dimension groups ( K 0 ( A ), K 0 + ( A ), Γ( A )) and ( K 0 ( B ), K 0 + ( B ), Γ( B )) are isomorphic.  The crux of the proof has become known as Elliott's intertwining argument . Given an isomorphism between dimension groups, one constructs a diagram of commuting triangles between the direct systems of A and B by applying the second lemma.  We sketch the proof for the non-trivial part of the theorem, corresponding to the sequence of commutative diagrams on the right.  Let Φ: ( K 0 ( A ), K 0 + ( A ), Γ( A )) → ( K 0 ( B ), K 0 + ( B ), Γ( B )) be a dimension group isomorphism.   Consider the composition of maps Φ α 1* : K 0 ( A 1 ) → K 0 ( B ). By the previous lemma, there exists B 1 and a *-homomorphism φ 1 : A 1 → B 1 such that the first diagram on the right commutes.  Same argument applied to β 1* Φ −1 shows that the second diagram commutes for some A 2 .  Comparing diagrams 1 and 2 gives diagram 3.  Using the property of the direct limit and moving A 2 further down if necessary, we obtain diagram 4, a commutative triangle on the level of K 0 .  For finite-dimensional algebras, two *-homomorphisms induces the same map on K 0 if and only if they are unitary equivalent. So, by composing ψ 1 with a unitary conjugation if needed, we have a commutative triangle on the level of algebras.  By induction, we have a diagram of commuting triangles as indicated in the last diagram. The map φ : A → B is the direct limit of the sequence { φ n }. Let ψ : B → A is the direct limit of the sequence { ψ n }. It is clear that φ and ψ are mutual inverses. Therefore A and B are isomorphic.   (Figure)  Elliott's theorem 2.png   Furthermore, on the level of K 0 , the diagram on the left commutates for each k . By uniqueness of direct limit of maps, φ * = Φ.  The Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem  The dimension group of an AF algebra is a Riesz group . The Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem says the converse is true. Every Riesz group, with a given scale, arises as the dimension group of some AF algebra. This specifies the range of the classifying functor K 0 for AF algebras and completes the classification.  Riesz groups  A group G with a partial order is called an ordered group . The set G + of elements ≥ 0 is called the positive cone of G . One says that G is unperforated if k · g ∈ G + implies g ∈ G + .  The following property is called the Riesz decomposition property : if x , y i ≥ 0 and x ≤ ∑ y i , then there exists x i ≥ 0 such that x = ∑ x i , and x i ≤ y i for each i .  A Riesz group ( G , G + ) is an ordered group that is unperforated and has the Riesz decomposition property.  It is clear that if A is finite-dimensional, ( K 0 , K 0 + ) is a Riesz group, where Z k is given entrywise order. The two properties of Riesz groups are preserved by direct limits, assuming the order structure on the direct limit comes from those in the inductive system. So ( K 0 , K 0 + ) is a Riesz group for an AF algebra A .  A key step towards the Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem is the fact that every Riesz group is the direct limit of Z k 's, each with the canonical order structure. This hinges on the following technical lemma, sometimes referred to as the Shen criterion in the literature.  (Figure)  The Shen criterion.   Lemma Let ( G , G + ) be a Riesz group, φ : ( Z k , Z k + ) → ( G , G + ) be a positive homomorphism. Then there exists maps σ and ψ , as indicated in the diagram to the right, such that ker( σ ) = ker( φ ).  Corollary Every Riesz group ( G , G + ) can be expressed as a direct limit        (  G  ,   G  +   )   =    lim  →    (   ℤ   n  k    ,   ℤ  +   n  k    )     ,       G   superscript  G      injective-limit    superscript  ℤ   subscript  n  k     subscript   superscript  ℤ   subscript  n  k          (G,G^{+})=\underrightarrow{\lim}(\mathbb{Z}^{n_{k}},\mathbb{Z}^{n_{k}}_{+}),     where all the connecting homomorphisms in the directed system on the right hand side are positive.  The theorem  Theorem If ( G , G + ) is a countable Riesz group with scale Γ( G ), then there exists an AF algebra A such that ( K 0 , K 0 + , Γ( A )) = ( G , G + , Γ( G )). In particular, if Γ( G ) = [0, u G ] with maximal element u G , then A is unital with [1 A ] = [ u G ].  Consider first the special case where Γ( G ) = [0, u G ] with maximal element u G . Suppose         (  G  ,   G  +   )   =     lim  →    (   H  k   ,   H  k  +   )    ,  where      (  H  ,   H  k  +   )   =   (   ℤ   n  k    ,   ℤ  +   n  k    )     .     formulae-sequence     G   superscript  G       injective-limit    subscript  H  k    superscript   subscript  H  k       where       H   superscript   subscript  H  k        superscript  ℤ   subscript  n  k     subscript   superscript  ℤ   subscript  n  k          (G,G^{+})=\underrightarrow{\lim}(H_{k},H_{k}^{+}),\quad\mbox{where}\quad(H,H_{%
 k}^{+})=(\mathbb{Z}^{n_{k}},\mathbb{Z}^{n_{k}}_{+}).     Dropping to a subsequence if necessary, let        Γ   (   H  1   )    =   {   v  ∈   H  1  +    |     ϕ  1    (  v  )    ∈   Γ   (  G  )     }    ,        normal-Γ   subscript  H  1     conditional-set    v   superscript   subscript  H  1           subscript  ϕ  1   v     normal-Γ  G       \Gamma(H_{1})=\{v\in H_{1}^{+}|\phi_{1}(v)\in\Gamma(G)\},     where φ 1 ( u 1 ) = u G for some element u 1 . Now consider the order ideal G 1 generated by u 1 . Because each H 1 has the canonical order structure, G 1 is a direct sum of Z 's (with the number of copies possible less than that in H 1 ). So this gives a finite-dimensional algebra A 1 whose dimension group is ( G 1  G 1 + , [0, u 1 ]). Next move u 1 forward by defining u 2 = φ 12 ( u 1 ). Again u 2 determines a finite-dimensional algebra A 2 . There is a corresponding homomorphism α 12 such that α 12* = φ 12 . Induction gives a directed system       A  =    lim  →    A  k     ,      A   injective-limit   subscript  A  k      A=\underrightarrow{\lim}A_{k},     whose K 0 is        lim  →    (   G  k   ,   G  k  +   )    ,     injective-limit    subscript  G  k    superscript   subscript  G  k        \underrightarrow{\lim}(G_{k},G_{k}^{+}),     with scale         ∪  k     ϕ  k    [  0  ,   u  k   ]     =   [  0  ,   u  G   ]    .        subscript   k      subscript  ϕ  k    0   subscript  u  k       0   subscript  u  G      \cup_{k}\phi_{k}[0,u_{k}]=[0,u_{G}].     This proves the special case.  A similar argument applies in general. Observe that the scale is by definition a directed set . If Γ( G ) = { v k }, one can choose u k ∈ Γ( G ) such that u k ≥ v 1 ... v k . The same argument as above proves the theorem.  Examples  By definition, uniformly hyperfinite algebras are AF and unital. Their dimension groups are the countable subgroups of R . For example, for the 2 × 2 matrices M 2 , K 0 ( M 2 ) is Z [½], the rational numbers of the form a /2. The scale is Γ( M 2 ) = Z [½] ∩ [0, 1] = [0, ½, 1]. For the CAR algebra  A , K 0 ( A ) is the dyadic rationals with scale K 0 ( A ) ∩ [0, 1], with 1 = [1 A ]. All such groups are simple , in a sense appropriate for ordered groups. Thus UHF algebras are simple C*-algebras. In general, the groups which are not dense are the dimension groups of M k for some k .  Commutative C*-algebras, which were characterized by Gelfand , are AF precisely when the spectrum is totally disconnected . 1 The continuous functions C ( X ) on the Cantor set  X is one such example.  Elliott's classification program  It was proposed by Elliott that other classes of C*-algebras may be classifiable by K-theoretic invariants. For a C*-algebra A , the Elliott invariant is defined to be        Ell   (  A  )      =  def     (   (    K  0    (  A  )    ,    K  0     (  A  )   +    ,   Γ   (  A  )    )   ,    K  1    (  A  )    ,    T  +    (  A  )    ,    ρ  A    )    ,      superscript   def     Ell  A        subscript  K  0   A      subscript  K  0    superscript  A       normal-Γ  A       subscript  K  1   A      superscript  T    A    subscript  ρ  A      \mbox{Ell}(A)\;\stackrel{\mbox{def}}{=}\;(\;(K_{0}(A),K_{0}(A)^{+},\Gamma(A)),%
 K_{1}(A),T^{+}(A),\rho_{A}\;),     where T + ( A ) is the tracial positivel linear functionals in the weak-* topology, and ρ A is the natural pairing between T + ( A ) and K 0 ( A ).  The original conjecture by Elliott stated that the Elliott invariant classifies simple unital separable nuclear C*-algebras.  In the literature one can find several conjectures of Elliott type, with corresponding modified/refined Elliott invariants.  Von Neumann algebras  In a related context, an approximately finite-dimensional , or hyperfinite , von Neumann algebra is one with a separable predual and contains a weakly dense AF C*-algebra. Murray and von Neumann showed that, up to isomorphism, there exists a unique hyperfinite type II 1 factor. Connes obtained the analogous result for the II ∞ factor. Powers exhibited a family of non-isomorphic type III hyperfinite factors with cardinality of the continuum. Today we have a complete classification of hyperfinite factors.
