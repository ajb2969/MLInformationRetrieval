Galactogen 6beta-galactosyltransferase

In enzymology, a galactogen 6beta-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-galactose + galactogen 
 
 
 
  UDP + 1,6-beta-D-galactosylgalactogen
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and galactogen, whereas its two products are UDP and 1,6-beta-D-galactosylgalactogen.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:galactogen beta-1,6-D-galactosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphogalactose-galactogen galactosyltransferase, 1,6-D-galactosyltransferase, and beta-(1-6)-D-galactosyltransferase.
