   Superconducting coherence length      Superconducting coherence length   In superconductivity , the superconducting coherence length , usually denoted as   ξ   ξ   \xi   (Greek lowercase xi ), is the characteristic exponent of the variations of the density of superconducting component.  In some special limiting cases , for example in the weak-coupling BCS theory it is related to characteristic Cooper pair size.  The superconducting coherence length is one of two parameters in the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. It is given by: 1      ξ  =     ℏ  2    2  m   |  α  |          ξ       superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m    α        \xi=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m|\alpha|}}   while in BCS theory: 2      ξ  =    ℏ   v  f     π  Δ        ξ      Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  v  f      π  normal-Δ      \xi=\frac{\hbar v_{f}}{\pi\Delta}   where   ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is the reduced Planck constant ,   m   m   m   is the mass of a Cooper pair (twice the electron mass ),    v  f     subscript  v  f    v_{f}   is the Fermi velocity, and   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is the superconducting energy gap.  The ratio κ = λ/ξ , where λ is the London penetration depth , is known as the Ginzburg–Landau parameter. Type-I superconductors are those with 0  1/√2.  For temperatures T near the superconducting critical temperature T c , ξ(T) ∝ (1-T/T c ) −1 .
