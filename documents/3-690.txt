Polygamma function

 In mathematics, the polygamma function of order m is a meromorphic function on 
 
 
 
  and defined as the (m+1)-th derivative of the logarithm of the gamma function:



Thus



holds where ψ(z) is the digamma function and Γ(z) is the gamma function. They are holomorphic on 
 
 
 
 . At all the nonpositive integers these polygamma functions have a pole of order m + 1. The function ψ(1)(z) is sometimes called the trigamma function.

Integral representation
The polygamma function may be represented as



which holds for Re z >0 and m > 0. For m = 0 see the digamma function definition.
Recurrence relation
It satisfies the recurrence relation



which – considered for positive integer argument – leads to a presentation of the sum of reciprocals of the powers of the natural numbers:



and



for all 
 
 
 
 . Like the 
 
 
 
 -function, the polygamma functions can be generalized from the domain 
 
 
uniquely to positive real numbers only due to their recurrence relation and one given function-value, say 
 
 
 
 , except in the case m=0 where the additional condition of strictly monotony on 
 
 
 
  is still needed. This is a trivial consequence of the Bohr–Mollerup theorem for the gamma function where strictly logarithmic convexity on 
 
 
 
  is demanded additionally. The case m=0 must be treated differently because 
 
 
 
  is not normalizable at infinity (the sum of the reciprocals doesn't converge).
Reflection relation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is alternatingly an odd resp. even polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 
  with integer coefficients and leading coefficient 
 
 
 
 . They obey the recursion equation 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
Multiplication theorem
The multiplication theorem gives



and



for the digamma function.
Series representation
The polygamma function has the series representation



which holds for m > 0 and any complex z not equal to a negative integer. This representation can be written more compactly in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function as



Alternately, the Hurwitz zeta can be understood to generalize the polygamma to arbitrary, non-integer order.
One more series may be permitted for the polygamma functions. As given by Schlömilch,


 
 . This is a result of the Weierstrass factorization theorem.
Thus, the gamma function may now be defined as:



Now, the natural logarithm of the gamma function is easily representable:



Finally, we arrive at a summation representation for the polygamma function:



Where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta.
Also the alternating series



can be denoted in term of polygamma function



Taylor series
The Taylor series at z = 1 is


 
  and



which converges for |z|  \psi^{(m)}(z) \sim (-1)^{m+1}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(k+m-1)!}{k!}\frac{B_k}{z^{k+m}} \qquad m \ge 1 and



where we have chosen 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the Bernoulli numbers of the second kind.
