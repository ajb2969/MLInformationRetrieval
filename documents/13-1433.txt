Modified models of gravity

The existence of anomalous astrophysical and cosmological phenomena like the cosmic acceleration and the dynamics of clusters of galaxies and gas in galaxies themselves recently boosted the growth of several long-range modifications of the usual laws of gravitation. Indeed, the aforementioned phenomena did not find satisfactory explanations in terms of the standard Newtonâ€“Einstein gravitational physics, unless exotic and still undetected forms of matter-energy are postulated. Examples of such entities are, e.g., dark matter and dark energy, identified with the Cosmological Constant. At galactic scales, the most famous modified model of gravity is, perhaps, the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) proposed in 1983 by Mordehai Milgrom.1 More recently, also the MOdified Gravity (MOG) by John Moffat 2 and Dynamic Newtonian Advanced gravity (DNAg)3 took place.
MOND and MOG
While MOND modifies Newton's inverse square law at a characteristic acceleration scale 
 
 
 
 , MOG's modifications occur at large distances, i.e. MOG is a length scale-dependent model.
DGP model
Another proposal to accommodate the cosmic acceleration without invoking the concept of dark energy is the multidimensional braneworld model by Gia Dvali, Gregory Gabadadze and Massimo Porrati (DGP model). In it our ordinary space-time is a 3+1 dimensional brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk space.
