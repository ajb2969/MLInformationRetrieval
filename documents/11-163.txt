3-hydroxypalmitoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) dehydratase

In enzymology, a 3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(3R)-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] 
 
 
 
  hexadec-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (3R)-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein], and two products, hexadec-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3R)-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydro-lyase (hexadec-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein]-forming). Other names in common use include D-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase, beta-hydroxypalmitoyl-acyl carrier protein dehydrase, beta-hydroxypalmitoyl thioester dehydratase, beta-hydroxypalmityl-ACP dehydrase, and (3R)-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis.
