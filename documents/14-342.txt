   String group      String group   In topology , a branch of mathematics , a string group is an infinite-dimensional group String( n ) introduced by  as a 3-connected cover of a spin group . A string manifold is a manifold with a lifting of its frame bundle to a string group bundle. This means that in addition to being able to define holonomy along paths, one can also define holonomies for surfaces going between strings.  There is a short exact sequence of topological groups      0  →   K   (  Z  ,  2  )    →   String   (  n  )    →   Spin   (  n  )    →  0       normal-→  0    K   Z  2      normal-→      String  n     normal-→      Spin  n     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow K(Z,2)\rightarrow\text{String}(n)\rightarrow\text{Spin}(n)\rightarrow
 0     where K ( Z , 2) is an Eilenberg–MacLane space and Spin( n ) is a spin group.  References        External links      "  Category:Group theory
