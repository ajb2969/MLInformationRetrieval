String group

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a string group is an infinite-dimensional group String(n) introduced by  as a 3-connected cover of a spin group. A string manifold is a manifold with a lifting of its frame bundle to a string group bundle. This means that in addition to being able to define holonomy along paths, one can also define holonomies for surfaces going between strings.
There is a short exact sequence of topological groups



where K(Z, 2) is an Eilenberg–MacLane space and Spin(n) is a spin group.
