   Covector mapping principle      Covector mapping principle   The covector mapping principle is a special case of Riesz' representation theorem , which is a fundamental theorem in functional analysis. The name was coined by Ross and co-workers, 1 2  3 4 5 6 It provides conditions under which dualization can be commuted with discretization in the case of computational optimal control .  Description  An application of Pontryagin's minimum principle to Problem   B   B   B   , a given optimal control problem generates a boundary value problem . According to Ross, this boundary value problem is a Pontryagin lift and is represented as Problem    B  λ     superscript  B  λ    B^{\lambda}   .  Now suppose one discretizes Problem    B  λ     superscript  B  λ    B^{\lambda}   . This generates Problem    B   λ  N      superscript  B    λ  N     B^{\lambda N}   where   N   N   N   represents the number of discrete pooints. For convergence, it is necessary to prove that as       N  →  ∞   ,    Problem   B   λ  N     →   Problem   B  λ        formulae-sequence   normal-→  N     normal-→    Problem   superscript  B    λ  N       Problem   superscript  B  λ       N\to\infty,\quad\text{Problem }B^{\lambda N}\to\text{Problem }B^{\lambda}     In the 1960s Kalman and others 7 showed that solving Problem    B   λ  N      superscript  B    λ  N     B^{\lambda N}   is extremely difficult. This difficulty, known as the curse of complexity, 8 is complementary to the curse of dimensionality.  In a series of papers starting in the late 1990s, Ross and Fahroo showed that one could arrive at a solution to Problem    B  λ     superscript  B  λ    B^{\lambda}   (and hence Problem   B   B   B   ) more easily by discretizing first (Problem    B  N     superscript  B  N    B^{N}   ) and dualizing afterwards (Problem    B   N  λ      superscript  B    N  λ     B^{N\lambda}   ). The sequence of operations must be done carefully to ensure consistency and convergence. The covector mapping principle asserts that a covector mapping theorem can be discovered to map the solutions of Problem    B   N  λ      superscript  B    N  λ     B^{N\lambda}   to Problem    B   λ  N      superscript  B    λ  N     B^{\lambda N}   thus completing the circuit.
