List of shapes with known packing constant
The [[packing constant]] of a geometric body is the largest average density achieved by packing arrangements of [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] copies of the body. For most bodies the value of the packing constant is unknown.{{cite arXiv |first=András | last=Bezdek | first2=Włodzimierz | last2=Kuperberg |eprint=1008.2398v1 |title=Dense packing of space with various convex solids |class=math.MG |year=2010}} The following is a list of bodies in Euclidean spaces whose packing constant is known.="KB10" /> Fejes Tóth proved that in the plane, a point symmetric body has a packing constant that is equal to its translative packing constant and its lattice packing constant.1 Therefore, any such body for which the lattice packing constant was previously known, such as any ellipse, consequently has a known packing constant. In addition to these bodies, the packing constants of hyperspheres in 8 and 24 dimensions are almost exactly known.2
