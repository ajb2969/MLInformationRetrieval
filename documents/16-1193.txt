   List of shapes with known packing constant      List of shapes with known packing constant  The [[packing constant]] of a geometric body is the largest average density achieved by packing arrangements of [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] copies of the body. For most bodies the value of the packing constant is unknown. {{cite arXiv |first=András | last=Bezdek | first2=Włodzimierz | last2=Kuperberg |eprint=1008.2398v1 |title=Dense packing of space with various convex solids |class=math.MG |year=2010}} The following is a list of bodies in Euclidean spaces whose packing constant is known. ="KB10" /> Fejes Tóth proved that in the plane, a point symmetric body has a packing constant that is equal to its translative packing constant and its lattice packing constant. 1 Therefore, any such body for which the lattice packing constant was previously known, such as any ellipse , consequently has a known packing constant. In addition to these bodies, the packing constants of hyperspheres in 8 and 24 dimensions are almost exactly known. 2      Image   Description   Dimension   Packing constant   Comments       200px | center   All shapes that tile space   all   1   By definition     200px | center   Circle , Ellipse   2        π  /   12    ≈  0.906900        π    12    normal-≈  0.906900    π/\sqrt{12}≈0.906900      Proof attributed to Thue 3     200px | center   Smoothed octagon   2        η   s  o    =    8  -   4   2    -   ln  2      2   2    -  1    ≈  0.902414 .         subscript  η    s  o        8    4    2      2        2    2    1         0.902414 .     \eta_{so}=\frac{8-4\sqrt{2}-\ln{2}}{2\sqrt{2}-1}\approx 0.902414\,.
