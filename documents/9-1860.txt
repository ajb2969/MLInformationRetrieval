== Summary == Structure of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs). 1) a uniform FBG, where the refractive index change has a fixed period, 
 
 
 
 . 2) a chirped FBG, where the refractive index change is graded to give a larger bandwidth, 
 
 
 
 . 3) a tilted FBG, where the change in refractive index occurs are an angle to the optical axis of the fiber. 4) a superstructure FBG.
