   Code (set theory)      Code (set theory)   In set theory , a code for a hereditarily countable set      x  ∈    H   ℵ  1         x   subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1      x\in H_{\aleph_{1}}\,     is a set      E  ⊂   ω  ×  ω       E    ω  ω     E\subset\omega\times\omega     such that there is an isomorphism between (ω, E ) and ( X ,   ∈     \in   ) where X is the transitive closure of { x }. If X is finite (with cardinality n ), then use n × n instead of ω×ω and ( n , E ) instead of (ω, E ).  According to the axiom of extensionality , the identity of a set is determined by its elements. And since those elements are also sets, their identities are determined by their elements, etc.. So if one knows the element relation restricted to X , then one knows what x is. (We use the transitive closure of { x } rather than of x itself to avoid confusing the elements of x with elements of its elements or whatever.) A code includes that information identifying x and also information about the particular injection from X into ω which was used to create E . The extra information about the injection is non-essential, so there are many codes for the same set which are equally useful.  So codes are a way of mapping    H   ℵ  1      subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     H_{\aleph_{1}}   into the powerset of ω×ω. Using a pairing function on ω (such as ( n , k ) goes to ( n 2 +2· n · k + k 2 + n +3· k )/2), we can map the powerset of ω×ω into the powerset of ω. And we can map the powerset of ω into the Cantor set , a subset of the real numbers . So statements about    H   ℵ  1      subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1     H_{\aleph_{1}}   can be converted into statements about the reals. Consequently,      H   ℵ  1    ⊂   L   (  R  )     .       subscript  H   subscript  normal-ℵ  1      L  R     H_{\aleph_{1}}\subset L(R)\,.     Codes are useful in constructing mice .
