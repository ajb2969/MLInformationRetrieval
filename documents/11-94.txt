   Imidazoleacetate—phosphoribosyldiphosphate ligase      Imidazoleacetate—phosphoribosyldiphosphate ligase   In enzymology , an imidazoleacetate-phosphoribosyldiphosphate ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + imidazole-4-acetate + 5-phosphoribosyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)imidazole-4-acetate + diphosphate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , imidazole-4-acetate , and 5-phosphoribosyl diphosphate , whereas its 4 products are ADP , phosphate , 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)imidazole-4-acetate , and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is imidazoleacetate:5-phosphoribosyl-diphosphate ligase (ADP- and diphosphate-forming) . This enzyme is also called 5-phosphoribosylimidazoleacetate synthetase . This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism .
