Poisson wavelet
In mathematics, in functional analysis, several different [[wavelet]]s are known by the name '''Poisson wavelet'''.  In one context, the term "Poisson wavelet" is used to denote a family  of wavelets labeled by the set of [[positive integer]]s,  the members of which are associated with the  [[Poisson probability distribution]]. These wavelets were first defined  and studied by Karlene A. Kosanovich, Allan R. Moser and Michael J. Piovoso in 1995–96.{{cite journal|last1=Karlene A. Kosanovich, Allan R. Moser and Michael J.

To see the relation between the Poisson wavelet and the Poisson distribution let X be a discrete random variable having the Poisson distribution with parameter (mean) t and, for each non-negative integer n, let Prob(X = n) = pn(t). Then we have

Poisson wavelet is not an orthogonal family of wavelets.

Poisson wavelet transform
The Poisson wavelet family can be used to construct the family of Poisson wavelet transforms of functions defined the time domain. Since the Poisson wavelets satisfy the admissibility condition also, functions in the time domain can be reconstructed from their Poisson wavelet transforms using the formula for inverse continuous-time wavelet transforms.
If f(t) is a function in the time domain its n-th Poisson wavelet transform is given by








In the reverse direction, given the n-th Poisson wavelet transform 
 
 
 
 
  of a function f(t) in the time domain, the function f(t) can be reconstructed as follows:








Applications
Poisson wavelet transforms have been applied in multi-resolution analysis, system identification, and parameter estimation. They are particularly useful in studying problems in which the functions in the time domain consist of linear combinations of decaying exponentials with time delay.

Relation with Poisson kernel
The function 
 
 
 
 
  appears as an integral kernel in the solution of a certain initial value problem of the Laplace operator.
This is the initial value problem: Given any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , find a harmonic function 
 
 
 
  defined in the upper half-plane satisfying the following conditions:
:#
 
 
 
 , and
:#
 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
The problem has the following solution: There is exactly one function 
 
 
 
  satisfying the two conditions and it is given by








where 
 
 
 
 
  and where "
 
 
 
 " denotes the convolution operation. The function 
 
 
 
  is the integral kernel for the function 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  is the harmonic continuation of
