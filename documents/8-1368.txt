Unity amplitude




Unity amplitude

A sinusoidal waveform is said to have a unity amplitude when the amplitude of the wave is equal to 1.


 
  where A = 1.
This terminology is most commonly used in Digital Signal Processing and is usually associated with the Fourier series and Fourier Transform sinusoids that involve a duty cycle, Î±, and a defined fundamental period, To.
