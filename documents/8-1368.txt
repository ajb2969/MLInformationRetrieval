   Unity amplitude      Unity amplitude   A sinusoidal waveform is said to have a unity amplitude when the amplitude of the wave is equal to 1.       x   (  t  )    =   A  s  i  n   (   w  t   )          x  t     A  s  i  n    w  t      x(t)=Asin(wt)   where A = 1.  This terminology is most commonly used in Digital Signal Processing and is usually associated with the Fourier series and Fourier Transform sinusoids that involve a duty cycle , Î±, and a defined fundamental period , T o .
