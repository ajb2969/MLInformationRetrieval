== Divisor summatory function== This image illustrates the divisor summatory function with the leading asymptotic terms subtracted. That is, it is a graph of



where 
 
 
 
  is the divisor summatory function



and 
 
 
 
 
  is the divisor function and 
 
 
 
  is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
Properly speaking, the image is of the distribution of the values of the divisor summatory function, with each vertical slice being a histogram. Along the x-axis, x runs from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , and so the first 
 
 
 
  values of 
 
 
 
 
  are graphed. The y-axis is scaled, so that, from bottom to top, the height of the image is 
 
 
 
 . The line 
 
 
 
  runs horizontally down the center of the image. The histogramming is such that the areas which have a high density of points are colored red, progressively fading out to yellow, green, blue and finally black. Note that the bound 
 
 
 
  is quite tight, and there are many points that actually lie outside this image. However, the image does indicate their relative rarity. In short, this image indicates that although the divisor summatory function is quite random, it does seem to have rather well-behaved statistical properties, and seems to have a narrowing standard deviation as moving from 
 
 
 
  on the left to 
 
 
 
 
  on the right.
