   3-alpha,7-alpha-dihydroxy-5-beta-cholestanate—CoA ligase      3-alpha,7-alpha-dihydroxy-5-beta-cholestanate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestanate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (25R)-3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl coenzyme A synthetase , DHCA-CoA ligase , and 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestanate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 6.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
