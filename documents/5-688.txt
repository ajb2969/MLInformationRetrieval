   Braided monoidal category      Braided monoidal category   In mathematics , a commutativity constraint    Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   on a monoidal category     ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}    is a choice of isomorphism     Œ≥   A  ,  B    :    A  ‚äó  B   ‚Üí   B  ‚äó  A       normal-:   subscript  Œ≥   A  B     normal-‚Üí   tensor-product  A  B    tensor-product  B  A      \gamma_{A,B}:A\otimes B\rightarrow B\otimes A   for each pair of objects A and B which form a "natural family." In particular, to have a commutativity constraint, one must have     A  ‚äó  B   ‚âÖ   B  ‚äó  A        tensor-product  A  B    tensor-product  B  A     A\otimes B\cong B\otimes A   for all pairs of objects     A  ,  B   ‚àà  ùíû       A  B   ùíû    A,B\in\mathcal{C}   .  A braided monoidal category is a monoidal category   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   equipped with a braiding - that is, a commutativity constraint   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   that satisfies the hexagon identities (see below). The term braided comes from the fact that the braid group plays an important role in the theory of braided monoidal categories. Partly for this reason, braided monoidal categories and various related notions are important in the theory of knot invariants .  Alternatively, a braided monoidal category can be seen as a tricategory with one 0-cell and one 1-cell.  The hexagon identities  For   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   along with the commutativity constraint   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   to be called a braided monoidal category, the following hexagonal diagrams must commute for all objects     A  ,  B  ,  C   ‚àà  ùíû       A  B  C   ùíû    A,B,C\in\mathcal{C}   . Here   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   is the associativity isomorphism coming from the monoidal structure on   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   :      ,        (Figure)  braid category inverse hexagon.svg      Properties  Coherence  It can be shown that the natural isomorphism   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   along with the maps    Œ±  ,  Œª  ,  œÅ     Œ±  Œª  œÅ    \alpha,\lambda,\rho   coming from the monoidal structure on the category   ùíû   ùíû   \mathcal{C}   , satisfy various coherence conditions which state that various compositions of structure maps are equal. In particular:   The braiding commutes with the units. That is, the following diagram commutes:   (Figure)  braid category triangle.svg    The action of   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   on an   N   N   N   -fold tensor product factors through the braid group . In particular,         (    Œ≥   B  ,  C    ‚äó  Id   )   ‚àò   (   Id  ‚äó   Œ≥   A  ,  C     )   ‚àò   (    Œ≥   A  ,  B    ‚äó  Id   )    =    (   Id  ‚äó   Œ≥   A  ,  B     )   ‚àò   (    Œ≥   A  ,  C    ‚äó  Id   )   ‚àò   (   Id  ‚äó   Œ≥   B  ,  C     )           tensor-product   subscript  Œ≥   B  C    Id    tensor-product  Id   subscript  Œ≥   A  C      tensor-product   subscript  Œ≥   A  B    Id       tensor-product  Id   subscript  Œ≥   A  B      tensor-product   subscript  Œ≥   A  C    Id    tensor-product  Id   subscript  Œ≥   B  C        (\gamma_{B,C}\otimes\text{Id})\circ(\text{Id}\otimes\gamma_{A,C})\circ(\gamma_%
 {A,B}\otimes\text{Id})=(\text{Id}\otimes\gamma_{A,B})\circ(\gamma_{A,C}\otimes%
 \text{Id})\circ(\text{Id}\otimes\gamma_{B,C})     as maps     A  ‚äó  B  ‚äó  C   ‚Üí   C  ‚äó  B  ‚äó  A      normal-‚Üí   tensor-product  A  B  C    tensor-product  C  B  A     A\otimes B\otimes C\rightarrow C\otimes B\otimes A   . Here we have left out the associator maps.  Variations  There are several variants of braided monoidal categories that are used in various contexts. See, for example, the expository paper of Savage (2009) for an explanation of symmetric and coboundary monoidal categories, and the book by Chari and Pressley (1995) for ribbon categories.  Symmetric monoidal categories  A braided monoidal category is called symmetric if   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   also satisfies      Œ≥   B  ,  A    ‚àò   Œ≥   A  ,  B     =   I  d          subscript  Œ≥   B  A     subscript  Œ≥   A  B       I  d     \gamma_{B,A}\circ\gamma_{A,B}=Id   for all pairs of objects   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   . In this case the action of   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   on an   N   N   N   -fold tensor product factors through the symmetric group  Ribbon categories  A braided monoidal category is a ribbon category if it is rigid , and it has a good notion of quantum trace and co-quantum trace. Ribbon categories are particularly useful in constructing knot invariants .  Coboundary monoidal categories  Sometimes categories are assumed to have n-ary monoidal products for all finite n (in particular n>2), diminishing the role of associator morphisms. In such categories, the following variant is used, where the hexagon axiom is replaced by the two conditions:         Œ≥   B  ,  A    ‚àò   Œ≥   A  ,  B     =  Id         subscript  Œ≥   B  A     subscript  Œ≥   A  B     Id    \gamma_{B,A}\circ\gamma_{A,B}=\text{Id}   for all pairs of objects   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   .          Œ≥    B  ‚äó  A   ,  C    ‚àò   (    Œ≥   A  ,  B    ‚äó  Id   )    =    Œ≥   A  ,   C  ‚äó  B     ‚àò   (   Id  ‚äó   Œ≥   B  ,  C     )           subscript  Œ≥    tensor-product  B  A   C     tensor-product   subscript  Œ≥   A  B    Id       subscript  Œ≥   A   tensor-product  C  B      tensor-product  Id   subscript  Œ≥   B  C        \gamma_{B\otimes A,C}\circ(\gamma_{A,B}\otimes\text{Id})=\gamma_{A,C\otimes B}%
 \circ(\text{Id}\otimes\gamma_{B,C})      Examples   The category of representations of a group (or a lie algebra) is a symmetric monoidal category where     Œ≥   (   v  ‚äó  w   )    =   w  ‚äó  v         Œ≥   tensor-product  v  w     tensor-product  w  v     \gamma(v\otimes w)=w\otimes v   .    The category of representations of a quantized universal enveloping algebra      U  q    (  ùî§  )        subscript  U  q   ùî§    U_{q}(\mathfrak{g})   is a braided monoidal category, where   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   is constructed using the Universal R-matrix . In fact, this example is a ribbon category as well.   Applications   knot invariants .  Symmetric closed monoidal categories are used in denotational models of linear logic and linear types .
