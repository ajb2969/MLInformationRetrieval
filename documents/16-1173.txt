It has 50 faces, 18 octagons, 8 hexagons, and 24 squares.  Other names   Truncated small rhombicuboctahedron  Beveled cuboctahedron   Zonohedron  As a zonohedron , it can be constructed with all but 12 octagons as regular polygons . It is 2-uniform, with 2 sets of 48 vertices existing on two distances from its center.  It represents the Minkowski sum of a cube , a truncated octahedron , and a rhombic dodecahedron .  {{-}}  Excavated truncated rhombicuboctahedron      Excavated truncated rhombicuboctahedron       Faces     Edges     Vertices     Euler characteristic     genus     Symmetry group     The truncated rhombicuboctahedron can have its 12 irregular octagonal faces removed, and a toroidal polyhedron seen as a network of 6 square cupola , 8 triangular cupola , and 12 triangular prisms . 1 It has 148 faces (8 triangles, 126 squares, 8 hexagons, and 6 octagons), 312 edges, and 144 vertices. With Euler characteristic χ = f + v - e = -20, its genus , g = (2-χ)/2 is 11.  Without the triangular prisms, the toroidal polyhedron becomes a truncated cuboctahedron.

The triangle and squares of the rhombicuboctahedron can be independently rectified or truncated, creating four permutations of polyhedra. The partially truncated forms can be seen as edge contractions of the truncated form.      rectified/truncated rhombicuboctahedron     Rectified    (Figure)  Expanded_dual_cuboctahedron.png      4.4.4.4 and 3.4.4.4     The truncated rhombicuboctahedron can be seen in sequence of rectification and truncation operations from the cuboctahedron . A further alternation step leads to the snub rhombicuboctahedron .
