Cebeci–Smith model

The Cebeci–Smith model is a 0-equation eddy viscosity model used in computational fluid dynamics analysis of turbulent boundary layer flows. The model gives eddy viscosity, 
 
 
 
 , as a function of the local boundary layer velocity profile. The model is suitable for high-speed flows with thin attached boundary-layers, typically present in aerospace applications. Like the Baldwin-Lomax model, this model is not suitable for cases with large separated regions and significant curvature/rotation effects. Unlike the Baldwin-Lomax model, this model requires the determination of a boundary layer edge.
The model was developed by Tuncer Cebeci and Apollo M. O. Smith, in 1967.
Equations
In a two-layer model, the boundary layer is considered to comprise two layers: inner (close to the surface) and outer. The eddy viscosity is calculated separately for each layer and combined using:



where 
 
 
 
  is the smallest distance from the surface where 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 .
The inner-region eddy viscosity is given by:



where



with the von Karman constant 
 
 
 
  usually being taken as 0.4, and with



The eddy viscosity in the outer region is given by:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the displacement thickness, given by



and FK is the Klebanoff intermittency function given by
