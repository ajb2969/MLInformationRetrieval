   Glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase      Glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + glycoprotein N-acetyl-D-galactosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + glycoprotein D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and glycoprotein N-acetyl-D-galactosamine , whereas its two products are UDP and glycoprotein D-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:glycoprotein-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 3-beta-D-galactosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called uridine diphosphogalactose-mucin beta-(1->3)-galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in o-glycan biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .
