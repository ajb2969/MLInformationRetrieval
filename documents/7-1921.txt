Absolutely simple group

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a group is said to be absolutely simple if it has no proper nontrivial serial subgroups.1 That is, 
 
 
 
  is an absolutely simple group if the only serial subgroups of 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  (the trivial subgroup), and 
 
 
 
  itself (the whole group).
In the finite case, a group is absolutely simple if and only if it is simple. However, in the infinite case, absolutely simple is a stronger property than simple. The property of being strictly simple is somewhere in between.
