Bagnold number

The Bagnold number (Ba) is the ratio of grain collision stresses to viscous fluid stresses in a granular flow with interstitial Newtonian fluid, first identified by Ralph Alger Bagnold.1
The Bagnold number is defined by


 
 ,2
where 
 
 
 
  is the particle density, 
 
 
 
  is the grain diameter, 
 
 
 
  is the shear rate and 
 
 
 
  is the dynamic viscosity of the interstitial fluid. The parameter 
 
 
 
 
  is known as the linear concentration, and is given by


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the solids fraction and 
 
 
 
  is the maximum possible concentration (see random close packing).
In flows with small Bagnold numbers (Ba  450), which is known as the 'grain-inertia' regime. A transitional regime falls between these two values.
