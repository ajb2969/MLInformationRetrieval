   Bagnold number      Bagnold number   The Bagnold number ( Ba ) is the ratio of grain collision stresses to viscous fluid stresses in a granular flow with interstitial Newtonian fluid , first identified by Ralph Alger Bagnold . 1  The Bagnold number is defined by      Ba  =    ρ   d  2    λ   1  /  2    γ   μ       Ba      ρ   superscript  d  2    superscript  λ    1  2    γ   μ     \mathrm{Ba}=\frac{\rho d^{2}\lambda^{1/2}\gamma}{\mu}   , 2  where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the particle density ,   d   d   d   is the grain diameter,    γ  ˙     normal-˙  γ    \dot{\gamma}   is the shear rate and   μ   μ   \mu   is the dynamic viscosity of the interstitial fluid. The parameter   λ   λ   \lambda   is known as the linear concentration, and is given by      λ  =   1     (    ϕ  0   /  ϕ   )    1  3    -  1        λ    1     superscript     subscript  ϕ  0   ϕ     1  3    1      \lambda=\frac{1}{\left(\phi_{0}/\phi\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}-1}   ,  where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the solids fraction and    ϕ  0     subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}   is the maximum possible concentration (see random close packing ).  In flows with small Bagnold numbers (Ba  450), which is known as the 'grain-inertia' regime. A transitional regime falls between these two values.
