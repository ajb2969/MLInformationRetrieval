   Omega equation      Omega equation   The omega equation is of great importance in meteorology and atmospheric physics . It is a partial differential equation for the vertical velocity,   ω   ω   \omega   , which is defined as a Lagrangian rate of change of pressure with time, that is,    ω  =    d  p    d  t        ω      d  p     d  t      \omega=\frac{dp}{dt}   . The equation reads:      where   f   f   f   is the Coriolis parameter ,   σ   σ   \sigma   is the static stability,    𝐕  g     subscript  𝐕  g    \mathbf{V}_{g}   is the geostrophic velocity vector,    ζ  g     subscript  ζ  g    \zeta_{g}   is the geostrophic relative vorticity,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the geopotential ,    ∇  H  2     subscript   superscript  normal-∇  2   H    \nabla^{2}_{H}   is the horizontal Laplacian operator and    ∇  H     subscript  normal-∇  H    \nabla_{H}   is the horizontal del operator. 1  Derivation  The derivation of the   ω   ω   \omega   equation is based on the vorticity equation and the thermodynamic equation. The vorticity equation for a frictionless atmosphere may be written as:      Here   ξ   ξ   \xi   is the relative vorticity,   V   V   V   the horizontal wind velocity vector, whose components in the   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   directions are   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   respectively,   η   η   \eta   the absolute vorticity,   f   f   f   the Coriolis parameter ,    ω  =    d  p    d  t        ω      d  p     d  t      \omega=\frac{dp}{dt}   the individual rate of change of pressure   p   p   p   .   k   k   k   is the unit vertical vector,   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is the isobaric Del (grad) operator,    (    ξ    ∂  ω    ∂  p     -   ω    ∂  ξ    ∂  p      )        ξ      ω     p       ω      ξ     p       \left(\xi\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial p}-\omega\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial p%
 }\right)   is the vertical advection of vorticity and    k  ⋅   ∇   ω  ×    ∂  V    ∂  p         normal-⋅  k   normal-∇    ω      V     p        k\cdot\nabla\omega\times\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}   represents the transformation of horizontal vorticity into vertical vorticity. 2  The thermodynamic equation may be written as:      where    k  ≡    (    ∂  Z    ∂  p    )    ∂   ∂  p     ln  θ        k        Z     p         p      θ      k\equiv\left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial p}\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\ln\theta   , in which   q   q   q   is the supply of heat per unit-time and mass,    C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   the specific heat of dry air,   R   R   R   the gas constant for dry air,   θ   θ   \theta   is the potential temperature and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is geopotential    (   g  Z   )      g  Z    (gZ)   .  The   ω   ω   \omega   equation () is then obtained from equation () and () by substituting values:      ξ  =    g  f     ∇  2   Z        ξ      g  f     superscript  normal-∇  2   Z      \xi=\frac{g}{f}\nabla^{2}Z   and        k  ^   ⋅   ∇   ω  ×    ∂  V    ∂  p       =      ∂  ω    ∂  y      ∂  u    ∂  p     -     ∂  ω    ∂  x      ∂  v    ∂  p           normal-⋅   normal-^  k    normal-∇    ω      V     p               ω     y        u     p           ω     x        v     p        \hat{k}\cdot\nabla\omega\times\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}=\frac{\partial%
 \omega}{\partial y}\frac{\partial u}{\partial p}-\frac{\partial\omega}{%
 \partial x}\frac{\partial v}{\partial p}     into (), which gives:      Differentiating () with respect to   p   p   p   gives:      Taking the Laplacian (    ∇  2     superscript  normal-∇  2    \nabla^{2}   ) of () gives:      Adding () and (), simplifying and substituting     g  k   =  σ        g  k   σ    gk=\sigma   , gives:      Equation () is now a linear differential equation in   ω   ω   \omega   , such that it can be split into two part, namely    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   and    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   , such that:      and      where    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   is the vertical velocity due to the mean baroclinicity in the atmosphere and    ω  2     subscript  ω  2    \omega_{2}   is the vertical velocity due to the non-adiabatic heating, which includes the latent heat of condensation, sensible heat radiation, etc. (Singh & Rathor, 1974).  Interpretation  Physically, the omega equation combines the effects of vertical differential of geostrophic absolute vorticity advection (first term on the right-hand side) and three-dimensional Laplacian of thickness thermal advection (second term on the right-hand side) and determines the resulting vertical motion (as expressed by the dependent variable   ω   ω   \omega   .)  The above equation is used by meteorologists and operational weather forecasters to assess development from synoptic charts. In rather simple terms, positive vorticity advection (or PVA for short) and no thermal advection results in a negative   ω   ω   \omega   , that is, ascending motion. Similarly, warm advection (or WA for short) also results in a negative   ω   ω   \omega   corresponding to ascending motion. Negative vorticity advection (NVA) or cold advection (CA) both result in a positive   ω   ω   \omega   corresponding to descending motion.
