Uncertainty theory

Uncertainty theory is a branch of mathematics based on normality, monotonicity, self-duality, countable subadditivity, and product measure axioms. It was founded by Baoding Liu 1 in 2007 and refined in 2009.2
Mathematical measures of the likelihood of an event being true include probability theory, capacity, fuzzy logic, possibility, and credibility, as well as uncertainty.
Five axioms
Axiom 1. (Normality Axiom) 
 
 
 
 .
Axiom 2. (Monotonicity Axiom) 
 
 
 
 .
Axiom 3. (Self-Duality Axiom) 
 
 
 
 .
Axiom 4. (Countable Subadditivity Axiom) For every countable sequence of events Λ1, Λ2, ..., we have




 
 .
 



Axiom 5. (Product Measure Axiom) Let 
 
 
 
  be uncertainty spaces for 
 
 
 
 . Then the product uncertain measure 
 
 
 
  is an uncertain measure on the product σ-algebra satisfying




 
 .
 



Principle. (Maximum Uncertainty Principle) For any event, if there are multiple reasonable values that an uncertain measure may take, then the value as close to 0.5 as possible is assigned to the event.
Uncertain variables
An uncertain variable is a measurable function ξ from an uncertainty space 
 
 
 
  to the set of real numbers, i.e., for any Borel set B of real numbers, the set 
 
 
 
  is an event.
Uncertainty distribution
Uncertainty distribution is inducted to describe uncertain variables.
Definition:The uncertainty distribution

 
  of an uncertain variable ξ is defined by 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem(Peng and Iwamura, Sufficient and Necessary Condition for Uncertainty Distribution) A function 
 
 
 
  is an uncertain distribution if and only if it is an increasing function except 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Independence

  are said to be independent if

  of real numbers.

  for any Borel sets 
 
 
 
  of real numbers.
Theorem 2: Let 
 
 
 
  be independent uncertain variables, and 
 
 
 
  measurable functions. Then 
 
 
 
  are independent uncertain variables.
Theorem 3: Let 
 
 
 
  be uncertainty distributions of independent uncertain variables 
 
 
 
  respectively, and 
 
 
 
  the joint uncertainty distribution of uncertain vector 
 
 
 
 . If
