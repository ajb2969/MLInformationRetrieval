   Protein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase      Protein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase   In enzymology , a protein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 4-N-(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-protein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and protein , whereas its two products are UDP and 4-N-(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-protein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:protein beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-transferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-protein , acetylglucosaminyltransferase , uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide , beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , and O-GlcNAc transferase .
