N-acetylgalactosaminoglycan deacetylase

In enzymology, a N-acetylgalactosaminoglycan deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetyl-D-galactosaminoglycan + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-galactosaminoglycan + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-D-galactosaminoglycan and H2O, whereas its two products are D-galactosaminoglycan and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetyl-D-galactosaminoglycan acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include polysaccharide deacetylase, Vi-polysaccharide deacetylase, and N-acetyl galactosaminoglycan deacetylase.
