X + Y sorting

 In computer science, X + Y sorting is the problem of sorting pairs of numbers by their sum. Given two finite sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the problem is to order all pairs 
 
 
 
  by the key 
 
 
 
 
 . The problem is attributed to Elwyn Berlekamp.12
This problem can be solved using comparison sorting in time

 
  for sets of sizes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
  when it is assumed that 
 
 
 
 
 . This is also the best known bound on the problem, but whether X + Y sorting can be done strictly faster than sorting 
 
 
 
  arbitrary numbers is an open problem.34 The number of required comparisons is certainly lower than for ordinary comparison sorting: Fredman showed, in 1976, that X + Y sorting can be done using 
 
 
 
  comparisons, though he did not show an algorithm.5 The first actual algorithm that achieves this number of comparisons and 
 
 
 
  total complexity was only published sixteen years later.6
On a RAM machine with word size

 
  and integer inputs , the problem can be solved in 
 
 
 
 
  operations by means of the fast Fourier transform.7
Skiena recounts a practical application in transit fare minimisation, an instance of the shortest path problem: given fares 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for trips from departure A to some intermediate destination B and from B to final destination C, determine the least expensive combined trip from A to C.8
