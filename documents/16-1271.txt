   X + Y sorting      X + Y sorting   In computer science , X + Y sorting is the problem of sorting  pairs of numbers by their sum. Given two finite sets   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   , the problem is to order all pairs     (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   X  ×  Y        x  y     X  Y     (x,y)\in X\times Y   by the key    x  +  y      x  y    x+y   . The problem is attributed to Elwyn Berlekamp . 1 2  This problem can be solved using comparison sorting in time     O   (   n  m  l  o  g   (   n  m   )    )       O    n  m  l  o  g    n  m      O(nmlog(nm))   for sets of sizes   n   n   n   and   m   m   m   , or     O   (   n  ²  l  o  g  n  ²   )    =   O   (   n  ²  l  o  g  n   )          O    n  normal-²  l  o  g  n  normal-²      O    n  normal-²  l  o  g  n      O(n²logn²)=O(n²logn)   when it is assumed that    m  =  n      m  n    m=n   . This is also the best known bound on the problem, but whether X + Y sorting can be done strictly faster than sorting    n  ×  m      n  normal-×  m    n×m   arbitrary numbers is an open problem . 3 4 The number of required comparisons is certainly lower than for ordinary comparison sorting: Fredman showed, in 1976, that X + Y sorting can be done using    O   (   n  ²   )       O    n  normal-²     O(n²)   comparisons, though he did not show an algorithm . 5 The first actual algorithm that achieves this number of comparisons and    O   (   n  ²  l  o  g  n   )       O    n  normal-²  l  o  g  n     O(n²logn)   total complexity was only published sixteen years later. 6  On a RAM machine with word size    w   w   w   and integer inputs , the problem can be solved in    O   (   n  l  o  g  n   )       O    n  l  o  g  n     O(nlogn)   operations by means of the fast Fourier transform . 7  Skiena recounts a practical application in transit fare minimisation, an instance of the shortest path problem : given fares   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   for trips from departure A to some intermediate destination B and from B to final destination C, determine the least expensive combined trip from A to C. 8  See also   3SUM  Integer sorting   References  "  Category:Sorting algorithms  Category:Unsolved problems in computer science        ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
