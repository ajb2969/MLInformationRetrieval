Essentially finite vector bundle




Essentially finite vector bundle

In mathematics, an essentially finite vector bundle is a particular type of vector bundle defined by Madhav Nori,12 as the main tool in the construction of the fundamental group scheme. Even if the definition is not intuitive there is a nice characterization that makes essentially finite vector bundles quite natural objects to study in algebraic geometry. So before recalling the definition we give this characterization:
Characterization
Let 
 
 
 
  be a reduced and connected scheme over a perfect field

 
  endowed with a section 
 
 
 
 . Then a vector bundle 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is essentially finite if and only if there exists a finite

 
 -group scheme

 
  and a 
 
 
 
 -torsor

 
  such that 
 
 
 
  becomes trivial over 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 ).
