   Essentially finite vector bundle      Essentially finite vector bundle   In mathematics, an essentially finite vector bundle is a particular type of vector bundle defined by Madhav Nori, 1 2 as the main tool in the construction of the fundamental group scheme . Even if the definition is not intuitive there is a nice characterization that makes essentially finite vector bundles quite natural objects to study in algebraic geometry . So before recalling the definition we give this characterization:  Characterization  Let   X   X   X   be a reduced and connected scheme over a perfect field    k   k   k   endowed with a section    x  ∈   X   (  k  )        x    X  k     x\in X(k)   . Then a vector bundle   V   V   V   over   X   X   X   is essentially finite if and only if there exists a finite    k   k   k   - group scheme    G   G   G   and a   G   G   G   - torsor     p  :   P  →  X      normal-:  p   normal-→  P  X     p:P\to X   such that   V   V   V   becomes trivial over   P   P   P   (i.e.      p  *    (  V  )    ≅   O  P   ⊕  r           superscript  p    V    superscript   subscript  O  P    direct-sum  r      p^{*}(V)\cong O_{P}^{\oplus r}   , where    r  =   r  k   (  V  )        r    r  k  V     r=rk(V)   ).
