Pluripolar set

In mathematics, in the area of potential theory, a pluripolar set is the analog of a polar set for plurisubharmonic functions.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a plurisubharmonic function which is not identically 
 
 
 
 . The set



is called a complete pluripolar set. A pluripolar set is any subset of a complete pluripolar set. Pluripolar sets are of Hausdorff dimension at most 
 
 
 
  and have zero Lebesgue measure.1
If 
 
 
 
  is a holomorphic function then 
 
 
 
  is a plurisubharmonic function. The zero set of 
 
 
 
  is then a pluripolar set.
