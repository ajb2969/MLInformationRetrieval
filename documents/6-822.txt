   Pluripolar set      Pluripolar set   In mathematics , in the area of potential theory , a pluripolar set is the analog of a polar set for plurisubharmonic functions .  Definition  Let    G  ⊂   ℂ  n       G   superscript  ℂ  n     G\subset{\mathbb{C}}^{n}   and let    f  :   G  →   ℝ  ∪   {   -  ∞   }        normal-:  f   normal-→  G    ℝ            f\colon G\to{\mathbb{R}}\cup\{-\infty\}   be a plurisubharmonic function which is not identically    -  ∞         -\infty   . The set      𝒫  :=   {   z  ∈  G   ∣    f   (  z  )    =   -  ∞    }      assign  𝒫   conditional-set    z  G       f  z           {\mathcal{P}}:=\{z\in G\mid f(z)=-\infty\}     is called a complete pluripolar set . A pluripolar set is any subset of a complete pluripolar set. Pluripolar sets are of Hausdorff dimension at most     2  n   -  2        2  n   2    2n-2   and have zero Lebesgue measure . 1  If   f   f   f   is a holomorphic function then    log   |  f  |         f     \log|f|   is a plurisubharmonic function. The zero set of   f   f   f   is then a pluripolar set.  See also   Skoda-El Mir theorem   References   Steven G. Krantz.
