   Antisymmetric exchange      Antisymmetric exchange   The antisymmetric exchange is a contribution to the total magnetic exchange interaction between two neighboring magnetic spins,    𝐒  i     subscript  𝐒  i    \mathbf{S}_{i}   and    𝐒  j     subscript  𝐒  j    \mathbf{S}_{j}   . It was first postulated by Igor Dzyaloshinskii on the grounds of phenomenological considerations based on Landau theory . 1 Toru Moriya identified the spin-orbit coupling as microscopic mechanism of the antisymmetric exchange interaction. 2 It can be written as     H   D  M    =    𝐃   i  j    ⋅   (    𝐒  i   ×   𝐒  j    )         subscript  H    D  M     normal-⋅   subscript  𝐃    i  j       subscript  𝐒  i    subscript  𝐒  j       H_{DM}=\mathbf{D}_{ij}\cdot(\mathbf{S}_{i}\times\mathbf{S}_{j})   . This term is also called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In magnetically ordered systems, it favors a spin canting of otherwise (anti)parallel aligned magnetic moments and thus, e.g., is a source of weak ferromagnetic behavior in an antiferromagnet .  The orientation of the vector    𝐃   i  j      subscript  𝐃    i  j     \mathbf{D}_{ij}   is constrained by symmetry, as discussed already in Moriya’s original publication. Considering the case that the magnetic interaction between two neighboring ions is transferred via a single third ion ( ligand ) by the superexchange mechanism (see Figure), the orientation of    𝐃   i  j      subscript  𝐃    i  j     \mathbf{D}_{ij}   is obtained by the simple relation     𝐃   i  j    ∝    𝐫  i   ×   𝐫  j    =    𝐫   i  j    ×  𝐱        proportional-to   subscript  𝐃    i  j       subscript  𝐫  i    subscript  𝐫  j            subscript  𝐫    i  j    𝐱      \mathbf{D}_{ij}\propto\mathbf{r}_{i}\times\mathbf{r}_{j}=\mathbf{r}_{ij}\times%
 \mathbf{x}   . 3 4 This implies that    𝐃   i  j      subscript  𝐃    i  j     \mathbf{D}_{ij}   is oriented perpendicular to the triangle spanned by the involved three ions.     𝐃   i  j    =  0       subscript  𝐃    i  j    0    \mathbf{D}_{ij}=0   if the three ions are in line.  The antisymmetric exchange is of importance for the understanding of magnetism induced electric polarization in a recently discovered class of multiferroics : Here, small shifts of the ligand ions can be induced by magnetic ordering , because the systems tends to enhance the magnetic interaction energy on the cost of lattice energy. This mechanism is called “inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya effect”. In certain magnetic structures, all ligand ions are shifted into the same direction, leading to a net electric polarization [4].
