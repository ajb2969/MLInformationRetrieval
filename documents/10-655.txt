   3alpha(17beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NAD+)      3alpha(17beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NAD+)   In enzymology , a 3alpha(17beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NAD + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   testosterone + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   androst-4-ene-3,17-dione + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are testosterone and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are androst-4-ene-3,17-dione , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3alpha(or 17beta)-hydroxysteroid:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 3alpha,17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase , 3alpha(17beta)-HSD , and 3alpha(17beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NAD + ) . This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
