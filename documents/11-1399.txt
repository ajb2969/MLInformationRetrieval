   Topological indistinguishability      Topological indistinguishability   In topology , two points of a topological space  X are topologically indistinguishable if they have exactly the same neighborhoods . That is, if x and y are points in X , and A is the set of all neighborhoods that contain x , and B is the set of all neighborhoods that contain y , then x and y are "topologically indistinguishable" if and only if  A = B .  Intuitively, two points are topologically indistinguishable if the topology of X is unable to discern between the points.  Two points of X are topologically distinguishable if they are not topologically indistinguishable. This means there is an open set containing precisely one of the two points (equivalently, there is a closed set containing precisely one of the two points). This open set can then be used to distinguish between the two points. A T 0 space is a topological space in which every pair of distinct points is topologically distinguishable. This is the weakest of the separation axioms .  Topological indistinguishability defines an equivalence relation on any topological space X . If x and y are points of X we write x ‚â° y for " x and y are topologically indistinguishable". The equivalence class of x will be denoted by [ x ].  Examples  For T 0 spaces (in particular, for Hausdorff spaces ) the notion of topological indistinguishability is trivial, so one must look to non-T 0 spaces to find interesting examples. On the other hand, regularity and normality do not imply T 0 , so we can find examples with these properties. In fact, almost all of the examples given below are completely regular .   In an indiscrete space , any two points are topologically indistinguishable.  In a pseudometric space , two points are topologically indistinguishable if and only if the distance between them is zero.  In a seminormed vector space , x ‚â° y if and only if ‚Äñ x ‚àí y ‚Äñ = 0.  For example, let L 2 ( R ) be the space of all measurable functions from R to R which are square integrable (see L p space ). Then two functions f and g in L 2 ( R ) are topologically indistinguishable if and only if they are equal almost everywhere .   In a topological group , x ‚â° y if and only if x ‚àí1 y ‚àà cl{ e } where cl{ e } is the closure of the trivial subgroup . The equivalence classes are just the cosets of cl{ e } (which is always a normal subgroup ).  Uniform spaces generalize both pseudometric spaces and topological groups. In a uniform space, x ‚â° y if and only if the pair ( x , y ) belongs to every entourage . The intersection of all the entourages is an equivalence relation on X which is just that of topological indistinguishability.  Let X have the initial topology with respect to a family of functions    {   f  Œ±   :   X  ‚Üí   Y  Œ±    }     conditional-set   subscript  f  Œ±    normal-‚Üí  X   subscript  Y  Œ±      \{f_{\alpha}:X\to Y_{\alpha}\}   . Then two points x and y in X will be topologically indistinguishable if the family    f  Œ±     subscript  f  Œ±    f_{\alpha}   does not separate them (i.e.      f  Œ±    (  x  )    =    f  Œ±    (  y  )           subscript  f  Œ±   x      subscript  f  Œ±   y     f_{\alpha}(x)=f_{\alpha}(y)   for all   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   ).  Given any equivalence relation on a set X there is a topology on X for which the notion of topological indistinguishability agrees with the given equivalence relation. One can simply take the equivalence classes as a base for the topology. This is called the partition topology on X .   Specialization preorder  The topological indistinguishability relation on a space X can be recovered from a natural preorder on X called the specialization preorder . For points x and y in X this preorder is defined by   x ‚â§ y  if and only if  x ‚àà cl{ y }   where cl{ y } denotes the closure of { y }. Equivalently, x ‚â§ y if the neighborhood system of x , denoted N x , is contained in the neighborhood system of y :   x ‚â§ y if and only if N x ‚äÇ N y .   It is easy to see that this relation on X is reflexive and transitive and so defines a preorder. In general, however, this preorder will not be antisymmetric . Indeed, the equivalence relation determined by ‚â§ is precisely that of topological indistinguishability:   x ‚â° y if and only if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x .   A topological space is said to be symmetric (or R 0 ) if the specialization preorder is symmetric (i.e. x ‚â§ y implies y ‚â§ x ). In this case, the relations ‚â§ and ‚â° are identical. Topological indistinguishability is better behaved in these spaces and easier to understand. Note that this class of spaces includes all regular and completely regular spaces .  Properties  Equivalent conditions  There are several equivalent ways of determining when two points are topologically indistinguishable. Let X be a topological space and let x and y be points of X . Denote the respective closures of x and y by cl{ x } and cl{ y }, and the respective neighborhood systems by N x and N y . Then the following statements are equivalent:   x ‚â° y  for each open set U in X , either U contains both x and y or neither of them  N x = N y  x ‚àà cl{ y } and y ‚àà cl{ x }  cl{ x } = cl{ y }  x ‚àà ‚à© N y and y ‚àà ‚à© N x  ‚à© N x = ‚à© N y  x ‚àà cl{ y } and x ‚àà ‚à© N y  x belongs to every open set and every closed set containing y  a net or filter converges to x if and only if it converges to y   These conditions can be simplified in the case where X is symmetric space . For these spaces (in particular, for regular spaces ), the following statements are equivalent:   x ‚â° y  for each open set U , if x ‚àà U then y ‚àà U  N x ‚äÇ N y  x ‚àà cl{ y }  x ‚àà ‚à© N y  x belongs to every closed set containing y  x belongs to every open set containing y  every net or filter that converges to x converges to y   Equivalence classes  To discuss the equivalence class of x , it is convenient to first define the upper and lower sets of x . These are both defined with respect to the specialization preorder discussed above.  The lower set of x is just the closure of { x }:        \darr   x   =   {   y  ‚àà  X   :   y  ‚â§  x   }   =   cl   {  x  }            \darr  x    conditional-set    y  X     y  x           cl   x       \mathop{\darr}x=\{y\in X:y\leq x\}=\textrm{cl}\{x\}   while the upper set of x is the intersection of the neighborhood system at x :         \uarr   x   =   {   y  ‚àà  X   :   x  ‚â§  y   }   =   ‚ãÇ   ùí©  x     .          \uarr  x    conditional-set    y  X     x  y            subscript  ùí©  x       \mathop{\uarr}x=\{y\in X:x\leq y\}=\bigcap\mathcal{N}_{x}.     The equivalence class of x is then given by the intersection        [  x  ]   =     \darr   x   ‚à©    \uarr   x     .       delimited-[]  x       \darr  x     \uarr  x      [x]={\mathop{\darr}x}\cap{\mathop{\uarr}x}.     Since ‚Üì x is the intersection of all the closed sets containing x and ‚Üë x is the intersection of all the open sets containing x , the equivalence class [ x ] is the intersection of all the open and closed sets containing x .  Both cl{ x } and ‚à© N x will contain the equivalence class [ x ]. In general, both sets will contain additional points as well. In symmetric spaces (in particular, in regular spaces ) however, the three sets coincide:        [  x  ]   =   cl   {  x  }    =   ‚ãÇ   ùí©  x     .         delimited-[]  x     cl   x            subscript  ùí©  x       [x]=\textrm{cl}\{x\}=\bigcap\mathcal{N}_{x}.   In general, the equivalence classes [ x ] will be closed if and only if the space is symmetric.  Continuous functions  Let f : X ‚Üí Y be a continuous function . Then for any x and y in X   x ‚â° y implies f ( x ) ‚â° f ( y ).   The converse is generally false (There are quotients of T 0 spaces which are trivial ). The converse will hold if X has the initial topology induced by f . More generally, if X has the initial topology induced by a family of maps     f  Œ±   :   X  ‚Üí   Y  Œ±       normal-:   subscript  f  Œ±    normal-‚Üí  X   subscript  Y  Œ±      f_{\alpha}:X\to Y_{\alpha}   then   x ‚â° y if and only if f Œ± ( x ) ‚â° f Œ± ( y ) for all Œ±.   It follows that two elements in a product space are topologically indistinguishable if and only if each of their components are topologically indistinguishable.  Kolmogorov quotient  Since topological indistinguishability is an equivalence relation on any topological space X , we can form the quotient space  KX = X /‚â°. The space KX is called the Kolmogorov quotient or T 0 identification of X . The space KX is, in fact, T 0 (i.e. all points are topologically distinguishable). Moreover, by the characteristic property of the quotient map any continuous map f : X ‚Üí Y from X to a T 0 space factors through the quotient map q : X ‚Üí KX .  Although the quotient map q is generally not a homeomorphism (since it is not generally injective ), it does induce a bijection between the topologies of X and the topologies of KX . Intuitively, the Kolmogorov quotient does not alter the topology of a space. It just reduces the point set until points become topologically distinguishable.
