   Magnetic capacitance      Magnetic capacitance   Magnetic capacitance (capacitive magnetic reactance) ( SI Unit : - Ω −1 ) is a magnetic "reactance" which prevents magnetic "current" in oscillating magnetic circuits from rising. This is associated with high reluctance.  For harmonic regimes it is equal to:       x  C   =   1   ω   C  M          subscript  x  C     1    ω   subscript  C  M       x_{C}=\frac{1}{\omega C_{M}}     Where:      C  M     subscript  C  M    C_{M}   is the magnetic capacitivity ( SI Unit : -s· Ω −1 )     ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency of the magnetic circuit  In complex form it is written as an imaginary number:       -   j   x  C     =   -   j   1   ω   C  M       =   1   j  ω   C  M               j   subscript  x  C         j    1    ω   subscript  C  M              1    j  ω   subscript  C  M        -jx_{C}=-j\frac{1}{\omega C_{M}}=\frac{1}{j\omega C_{M}}     The electrical potential energy sustained by magnetic capacitivity varies with the frequency of oscillations in magnetic fields. The average power in a given period is equal to zero. The magnetic capacitance is a reactive part of the magnetic circuit . 1 2  References    "  Category:Magnetic circuits  Category:Electrical analogies     Pohl R. W.
