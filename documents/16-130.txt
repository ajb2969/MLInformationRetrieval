Delta6-protoilludene synthase

Delta6-protoilludene synthase (, 6-protoilludene synthase) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, Delta6-protoilludene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  Delta6-protoilludene + diphosphate


This enzyme is isolated from the fungus Armillaria gallica.
