<h1>Ramsey sentence</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Ramsey sentences</strong> are formal logical reconstructions of theoretical <a href="proposition" title="wikilink">propositions</a> attempting to draw a line between science and metaphysics. A Ramsey sentence aims at rendering propositions containing non-observable <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/theoretical-terms-science/">theoretical terms</a> clear by substituting observable terms. They were introduced by the <a href="logical_empiricist" title="wikilink">logical empiricist</a> philosopher <a href="Rudolf_Carnap" title="wikilink">Rudolf Carnap</a>.</p>
<h2 id="distinction-between-scientific-real-questions-and-metaphysical-pseudo-questions">Distinction between scientific (real) questions and metaphysical (pseudo) questions</h2>

<p>For Carnap, questions such as: “Are <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> real?” and: “Can you prove electrons are real?” were not legitimate questions implying great philosophical/<a href="metaphysics" title="wikilink">metaphysical</a> import. They were meaningless "pseudo-questions without cognitive content,” asked from outside a language framework of science. Inside this framework, entities such as electrons or <a href="sound_wave" title="wikilink">sound waves</a>, and relations such as <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a> and <a class="uri" href="force" title="wikilink">force</a> not only exist and have meaning, but are "useful" to the scientists who work with them. To accommodate such internal questions in a way that would justify their theoretical content empirically – and to do so while maintaining a distinction between <a href="analytic_proposition" title="wikilink">analytic</a> and <a href="synthetic_proposition" title="wikilink">synthetic</a> propositions – Carnap set out to develop a systematized way to consolidate theory and empirical observation in a meaningful language formula.</p>
<h2 id="distinction-between-observable-and-non-observable">Distinction between observable and non-observable</h2>

<p>Carnap began by differentiating observable things from non-observable things. Immediately, a problem arises: neither the <a href="German_language" title="wikilink">German</a> nor the <a href="English_language" title="wikilink">English language</a> naturally distinguish predicate terms on the basis of an observational categorization. As Carnap admitted, "The line separating observable from non-observable is highly arbitrary." For example, the predicate "hot" can be perceived by touching a hand to a lighted coal. But "hot" might take place at such a microlevel (e.g., the theoretical "heat" generated by the production of proteins in a <a class="uri" href="eukaryotic" title="wikilink">eukaryotic</a> cell) that it is virtually non-observable (at present). Physicist-philosopher <a href="Moritz_Schlick" title="wikilink">Moritz Schlick</a> characterized the difference linguistically, as the difference between the German verbs "kennen" (knowing as being acquainted with a thing – perception) and "erkennen" (knowing as understanding a thing – even if non-observable). This linguistic distinction may explain Carnap’s decision to divide the vocabulary into two artificial categories: a vocabulary of non-observable ("theoretical") terms (hereafter "V<sub>T</sub>"): i.e., terms we know of but are not acquainted with (erkennen), and a vocabulary of observable terms ("V<sub>O</sub>"), those terms we are acquainted with (kennen) and will accept arbitrarily. Accordingly, the terms thus distinguished were incorporated into comparable sentence structures: T-terms into Theoretical sentences (<strong>T-sentences</strong>); O-terms into Observational sentences (O-sentences).</p>

<p>The next step for Carnap was to connect these separate concepts by what he calls "Correspondence Rules" (C-rules), which are "mixed" sentences containing both T- and O-terms. Such a theory can be formulated as: T + C = df: the conjunction of T-postulates + the conjunction of C-rules – i.e.,

. This can be further expanded to include class terms such as for the class of all molecules, relations such as "betweenness," and predicates: e.g., TC ( t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, . . ., t<sub>n</sub>, o<sub>1</sub>, o<sub>2</sub>, . . ., o<sub>m</sub>). Though this enabled Carnap to establish what it means for a theory to be "empirical," this sentence neither defines the T-terms explicitly nor draws any distinction between its analytic and its synthetic content, therefore it was not yet sufficient for Carnap’s purposes.</p>

<p>In the theories of <a href="Frank_P._Ramsey" title="wikilink">Frank P. Ramsey</a>, Carnap found the method he needed to take the next step, which was to substitute variables for each T-term, then to quantify existentially all T-terms in both T-sentences and C-rules. The resulting "Ramsey sentence" effectively eliminated the T-terms as such, while still providing an account of the theory’s empirical content. The evolution of the formula proceeds thus:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Step 1 (empirical theory, assumed true): TC ( t<sub>1</sub> . . . t<sub>n</sub>, o<sub>1</sub> . . . o<sub>m</sub>)
</dd>
<dd>Step 2 (substitution of variables for T-terms): TC (x<sub>1</sub> . . . x<sub>n</sub>, o<sub>1</sub> . . . o<sub>m</sub>)
</dd>
<dd>Step 3 (

<p>Step 3 is the complete Ramsey sentence, expressed "<sup>R</sup>TC," and to be read: "There are some (unspecified) relations such that TC (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> . . . <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, <em>o</em><sub>1</sub> . . . <em>o</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>) is satisfied when the variables are assigned these relations. (This is equivalent to an interpretation as an appropriate model: there are relations <em>r</em><sub>1</sub> . . . <em>r</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> such that TC (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> . . . <em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, <em>o</em><sub>1</sub> . . . <em>o</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>) is satisfied when x<sub>i</sub> is assigned the value r<sub>i</sub>, and

<p>In this form, the Ramsey sentence captures the factual content of the theory. Though Ramsey believed this formulation was adequate to the needs of science, Carnap disagreed, with regard to a comprehensive reconstruction. In order to delineate a distinction between analytic and synthetic content, Carnap thought the reconstructed sentence would have to satisfy three desired requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The factual (F<sub>T</sub>) component must be observationally equivalent to the original theory (TC).</li>
<li>The analytic (A<sub>T</sub>) component must be observationally uninformative.</li>
<li>The combination of F<sub>T</sub> and A<sub>T</sub> must be <a href="logical_equivalence" title="wikilink">logically equivalent</a> to the original theory – that is,

<p>Requirement 1 is satisfied by <sup>R</sup>TC in that the existential quantification of the T-terms does not change the <a href="logical_truth" title="wikilink">logical truth</a> (L-truth) of either statement, and the reconstruction FT has the same O-sentences as the theory itself, hence <sup>R</sup>TC is observationally equivalent to TC : (i.e., for every O-sentence: O,

 ). As stated, however, requirements 2 and 3 remain unsatisfied. That is, taken individually, A<sub>T</sub> does contain observational information (such-and-such a theoretical term is observed to do such-and-such, or hold such-and-such a relation); and A<sub>T</sub> does not necessarily follow from F<sub>T</sub>. Carnap’s solution is to make the two statements conditional. If there are some relations such that [TC (x1 . . . xn, o1 . . . om)] is satisfied when the variables are assigned some relations, then the relations assigned to those variables by the original theory will satisfy [TC (t1 . . . tn, o1 . . . om)] – or: <sup>R</sup>TC → TC. This important move satisfies both remaining requirements and effectively creates a distinction between the total formula’s analytic and synthetic components. Specifically, for requirement 2: The conditional sentence does not make any information claim about the O-sentences in TC, it states only that "if" the variables in are satisfied by the relations, "then" the O-sentences will be true. This means that every O-sentence in TC that is logically implied by the sentence <sup>R</sup>TC → TC is L-true (i.e., every O-sentence in AT is true or not-true: the metal expands or it does not; the chemical turns blue or it does not, etc.). Thus TC can be taken as the non-informative (i.e., non-factual) component of the statement, or A<sub>T</sub>. Requirement 3 is satisfied by inference: given A<sub>T</sub>, infer F<sub>T</sub> → A<sub>T</sub>. This makes A<sub>T</sub> + F<sub>T</sub> nothing more than a reformulation of the original theory, hence A<sub>T</sub> Ù F<sub>T</sub> ó TC.</p>

<p>Carnap took as a fundamental requirement a respect for the <a href="analytic–synthetic_distinction" title="wikilink">analytic–synthetic distinction</a>. This is met by using two distinct processes in the formulation: drawing an empirical connection between the statement’s factual content and the original theory (observational equivalence), and by requiring the analytic content to be observationally non-informative.</p>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>

<p>Carnap’s reconstruction as it is given here is not intended to be a literal method for formulating scientific propositions. To capture what <a href="Pierre_Duhem" title="wikilink">Pierre Duhem</a> would call the entire "holistic" universe relating to any specified theory would require long and complicated renderings of <sup>R</sup>TC → TC. Instead, it is to be taken as demonstrating logically that there is a way that science could formulate empirical, observational explications of theoretical concepts – and in that context the Ramsey and Carnap construct can be said to provide a formal justificatory distinction between scientific observation and metaphysical inquiry.</p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>Among critics of the Carnap Ramsey formulation are <a href="John_Winnie" title="wikilink">John Winnie</a>, who extended the requirements to include an "observationally non-creative" restriction on Carnap’s A<sub>T</sub> – and both <a href="W.V.O._Quine" title="wikilink">Quine</a> and <a href="Carl_Hempel" title="wikilink">Hempel</a> attacked Carnap’s initial assumptions by emphasizing the ambiguity that persists between observable and non-observable terms.</p>
