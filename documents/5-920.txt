   Strong antichain      Strong antichain   In order theory , a subset  A of a partially ordered set  X is a strong downwards antichain if it is an antichain in which no two distinct elements have a common lower bound, that is,      ∀  x  ,  y  ∈   A    [  x  ≠  y  →  ¬  ∃  z  ∈   X    [  z  ≤  x  ∧  z  ≤  y  ]   ]   .     fragments  for-all  x  normal-,  y   A   fragments  normal-[  x   y  normal-→    z   X   fragments  normal-[  z   x   z   y  normal-]   normal-]   normal-.    \forall x,y\in A\;[x\neq y\rightarrow\neg\exists z\in X\;[z\leq x\land z\leq y%
 ]].     A strong upwards antichain  B is a subset of X in which no two distinct elements have a common upper bound. Authors will often omit the "upwards" and "downwards" term and merely refer to strong antichains. Unfortunately, there is no common convention as to which version is called a strong antichain. In the context of forcing , authors will sometimes also omit the "strong" term and merely refer to antichains. To resolve ambiguities in this case, the weaker type of antichain is called a weak antichain .  If (X,≤) is a partial order and there exist distinct x,y ∈ X such that { x,y } is a strong antichain, then (X,≤) cannot be a lattice (or even a meet semilattice ), since by definition, every two elements in a lattice (or meet semilattice) must have a common lower bound. Thus lattices have only trivial strong antichains (i.e., strong antichains of cardinality 1 or less).  References     "  Category:Order theory
