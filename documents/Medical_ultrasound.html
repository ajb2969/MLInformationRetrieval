<h1>Medical ultrasound</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Medical ultrasound</strong> (also known as <strong>diagnostic sonography</strong> or <strong>ultrasonography</strong>) is an <a href="medical_imaging" title="wikilink">diagnostic imaging</a> technique based on the application of <a class="uri" href="ultrasound" title="wikilink">ultrasound</a>. It is used to see internal body structures such as <a class="uri" href="tendons" title="wikilink">tendons</a>, <a class="uri" href="muscles" title="wikilink">muscles</a>, joints, vessels and internal organs. The aim of often to find a source of a disease or to exclude any <a class="uri" href="pathology" title="wikilink">pathology</a>. The practice of examining <a class="uri" href="pregnant" title="wikilink">pregnant</a> women using ultrasound is called <a href="Obstetric_ultrasonography" title="wikilink">obstetric ultrasound</a>, and is widely used.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Ultrasound" title="wikilink">Ultrasound</a> is <a href="sound_wave" title="wikilink">sound waves</a> with <a href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequencies</a> which are higher than those audible to humans. Ultrasound images also known as sonograms are made by sending pulses of ultrasound into <a href="Tissue_(biology)" title="wikilink">tissue</a> using a <a href="ultrasound_transducer" title="wikilink">probe</a>. The sound <a href="echo" title="wikilink">echoes</a> off the tissue; with different tissues reflecting varying degrees of sound. These echoes are recorded and displayed as an image to the operator.</p>

<p>Many different types of images can be formed using ultrasound. The most well-known type is a B-mode image, which displays the acoustic impedance of a two-dimensional cross-section of tissue. Other types of image can display <a href="Doppler_ultrasound" title="wikilink">blood flow</a>, motion of tissue over time, the location of blood, the <a href="elastography" title="wikilink">stiffness of tissue</a>, or the <a href="3D_ultrasound" title="wikilink">anatomy of a three-dimensional region</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to other prominent methods of medical imaging, ultrasound has several advantages. It provides images in real-time, it is portable and can be brought to the bedside, it is substantially lower in cost, and it does not use harmful <a href="ionizing_radiation" title="wikilink">ionizing radiation</a>. Drawbacks of ultrasonography include various limits on its field of view including patient cooperation and body habitus, difficulty imaging structures behind <a class="uri" href="bone" title="wikilink">bone</a> and air, and its relative dependence on a skilled operator.</p>
<h2 id="diagnostic-applications">Diagnostic applications</h2>

<p> Typical diagnostic sonographic scanners operate in the frequency range of 1 to 18 megahertz, though frequencies up to 50–100 megahertz have been used experimentally in a technique known as biomicroscopy in special regions, such as the anterior chamber of the eye.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The choice of frequency is a trade-off between spatial resolution of the image and imaging depth: lower frequencies produce less resolution but image deeper into the body. Higher frequency sound waves have a smaller wavelength and thus are capable of reflecting or scattering from smaller structures. Higher frequency sound waves also have a larger attenuation coefficient and thus are more readily absorbed in tissue, limiting the depth of penetration of the sound wave into the body (for details, see <a href="Acoustic_attenuation" title="wikilink">Acoustic attenuation</a>.)</p>

<p>Sonography (ultrasonography) is widely used in <a class="uri" href="medicine" title="wikilink">medicine</a>. It is possible to perform both <a href="medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnosis</a> and therapeutic procedures, using ultrasound to guide interventional procedures (for instance <a href="biopsy" title="wikilink">biopsies</a> or drainage of fluid collections). <a href="Sonographer" title="wikilink">Sonographers</a> are medical professionals who perform scans which are then typically interpreted by themselves or the radiologists, physicians who specialize in the application and interpretation of a wide variety of medical imaging modalities, or by cardiologists in the case of cardiac ultrasonography (echocardiography). Sonographers typically use a hand-held probe (called a transducer) that is placed directly on and moved over the patient. Increasingly, clinicians (physicians and other healthcare professionals who provide direct patient care) are using ultrasound in their office and hospital practices.</p>

<p>Sonography is effective for imaging soft tissues of the body. Superficial structures such as <a href="muscle" title="wikilink">muscles</a>, <a href="tendon" title="wikilink">tendons</a>, <a class="uri" href="testes" title="wikilink">testes</a>, <a class="uri" href="breast" title="wikilink">breast</a>, thyroid and parathyroid glands, and the <a class="uri" href="neonatal" title="wikilink">neonatal</a> brain are imaged at a higher <a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a> (7–18 MHz), which provides better axial and lateral <a href="Angular_resolution" title="wikilink">resolution</a>. Deeper structures such as liver and kidney are imaged at a lower frequency 1–6 MHz with lower axial and lateral resolution but greater penetration.</p>

<p>Medical sonography is used in the study of many different systems: </p>

<p>A general-purpose ultrasound scanner may be used for most imaging purposes. Usually specialty applications may be served only by use of a specialty transducer. Most ultrasound procedures are done using a transducer on the surface of the body, but improved diagnostic confidence is often possible if a transducer can be placed inside the body. For this purpose, specialty transducers, including endovaginal, endorectal, and transesophageal transducers are commonly employed. At the extreme of this, very small transducers can be mounted on small diameter catheters and placed into blood vessels to image the walls and disease of those vessels.</p>
<h2 id="from-sound-to-image">From sound to image</h2>

<p>The creation of an image from sound is done in three steps – producing a <a href="sound_wave" title="wikilink">sound wave</a>, receiving <a href="Echo_(phenomenon)" title="wikilink">echoes</a>, and interpreting those echoes.</p>
<h3 id="producing-a-sound-wave">Producing a sound wave</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Medical ultrasound scanner</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A sound wave is typically produced by a <a class="uri" href="piezoelectric" title="wikilink">piezoelectric</a> <a href="Ultrasonic_sensor" title="wikilink">transducer</a> encased in a plastic housing. Strong, short electrical pulses from the ultrasound machine drive the transducer at the desired frequency. The <a class="uri" href="frequencies" title="wikilink">frequencies</a> can be anywhere between 1 and 18 <a href="Megahertz" title="wikilink">MHz</a>. Older technology transducers focused their beam with physical lenses. Newer technology transducers use <a href="phased_array" title="wikilink">phased array</a> techniques to enable the ultrasound machine to change the direction and depth of focus.</p>

<p>The sound is focused either by the shape of the transducer, a lens in front of the transducer, or a complex set of control pulses from the ultrasound scanner (<a class="uri" href="Beamforming" title="wikilink">Beamforming</a>). This focusing produces an arc-shaped sound wave from the face of the transducer. The wave travels into the body and comes into focus at a desired depth.</p>

<p>Materials on the face of the transducer enable the sound to be transmitted efficiently into the body (often a rubbery coating, a form of <a href="impedance_matching" title="wikilink">impedance matching</a>). In addition, a water-based gel is placed between the patient's skin and the probe.</p>

<p>The sound wave is partially reflected from the layers between different tissues or scattered from smaller structures. Specifically, sound is reflected anywhere there are acoustic impedance changes in the body: e.g. <a href="blood_cell" title="wikilink">blood cells</a> in <a href="blood_plasma" title="wikilink">blood plasma</a>, small structures in organs, etc. Some of the reflections return to the transducer.</p>
<h3 id="receiving-the-echoes">Receiving the echoes</h3>

<p>The return of the sound wave to the transducer results in the same process that it took to send the sound wave, except in reverse. The return sound wave vibrates the transducer, the transducer turns the vibrations into electrical pulses that travel to the ultrasonic scanner where they are processed and transformed into a digital image.</p>
<h3 id="forming-the-image">Forming the image</h3>

<p>To make an image, the ultrasound scanner must determine two things from each received echo:</p>
<ol>
<li>How long it took the echo to be received from when the sound was transmitted.</li>
<li>How strong the echo was.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the ultrasonic scanner determines these two things, it can locate which pixel in the image to light up and to what intensity.</p>

<p>Transforming the received signal into a digital image may be explained by using a blank spreadsheet as an analogy. First picture a long, flat transducer at the top of the sheet. Send pulses down the 'columns' of the spreadsheet (A, B, C, etc.). Listen at each column for any return echoes. When an echo is heard, note how long it took for the echo to return. The longer the wait, the deeper the row (1,2,3, etc.). The strength of the echo determines the brightness setting for that cell (white for a strong echo, black for a weak echo, and varying shades of grey for everything in between.) When all the echoes are recorded on the sheet, we have a greyscale image.</p>
<h3 id="displaying-the-image">Displaying the image</h3>

<p>Images from the ultrasound scanner are transferred and displayed using the <a class="uri" href="DICOM" title="wikilink">DICOM</a> standard. Normally, very little post processing is applied to ultrasound images.</p>
<h2 id="sound-in-the-body">Sound in the body</h2>

<p> Ultrasonography (<a class="uri" href="sonography" title="wikilink">sonography</a>) uses a probe containing multiple acoustic <a href="transducer" title="wikilink">transducers</a> to send pulses of sound into a material. Whenever a sound wave encounters a material with a different density (acoustical impedance), part of the sound wave is reflected back to the probe and is detected as an echo. The time it takes for the <a href="Echo_(phenomenon)" title="wikilink">echo</a> to travel back to the probe is measured and used to calculate the depth of the tissue interface causing the echo. The greater the difference between acoustic impedances, the larger the echo is. If the pulse hits gases or solids, the density difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected and it becomes impossible to see deeper.</p>

<p>The frequencies used for medical imaging are generally in the range of 1 to 18 MHz. Higher frequencies have a correspondingly smaller wavelength, and can be used to make sonograms with smaller details. However, the attenuation of the sound wave is increased at higher frequencies, so in order to have better penetration of deeper tissues, a lower frequency (3–5 MHz) is used.</p>

<p>Seeing deep into the body with sonography is very difficult. Some acoustic energy is lost every time an echo is formed, but most of it (approximately

) is lost from acoustic absorption. (See also <a href="Acoustic_attenuation" title="wikilink">Acoustic attenuation</a> for further details on modeling of acoustic attenuation and absorption.)</p>

<p>The speed of sound varies as it travels through different materials, and is dependent on the <a href="Acoustic_impedance" title="wikilink">acoustical impedance</a> of the material. However, the sonographic instrument assumes that the acoustic velocity is constant at 1540 m/s. An effect of this assumption is that in a real body with non-uniform tissues, the beam becomes somewhat de-focused and image resolution is reduced.</p>

<p>To generate a <a href="2D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">2D</a>-image, the ultrasonic beam is swept. A transducer may be swept mechanically by rotating or swinging. Or a 1D <a href="phased_array" title="wikilink">phased array</a> transducer may be used to sweep the beam electronically. The received data is processed and used to construct the image. The image is then a 2D representation of the slice into the body.</p>

<p><a href="3D_computer_graphics" title="wikilink">3D</a> images can be generated by acquiring a series of adjacent 2D images. Commonly a specialised probe that mechanically scans a conventional 2D-image transducer is used. However, since the mechanical scanning is slow, it is difficult to make 3D images of moving tissues. Recently, 2D phased array transducers that can sweep the beam in 3D have been developed. These can image faster and can even be used to make live 3D images of a beating heart.</p>

<p><a href="Doppler_effect" title="wikilink">Doppler</a> ultrasonography is used to study blood flow and muscle motion. The different detected speeds are represented in color for ease of interpretation, for example leaky heart valves: the leak shows up as a flash of unique color. Colors may alternatively be used to represent the amplitudes of the received echoes.</p>
<h2 id="modes-of-sonography">Modes of sonography</h2>

<p>Several modes of ultrasound are used in medical imaging.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A-mode</strong>: A-mode (amplitude mode) is the simplest type of ultrasound. A single transducer scans a line through the body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function of depth. Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the destructive wave energy.</li>
<li><strong>B-mode or 2D mode</strong>: In B-mode (brightness mode) ultrasound, a linear array of transducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on screen. More commonly known as 2D mode now.</li>
<li><strong>C-mode</strong>: A C-mode image is formed in a plane normal to a B-mode image. A gate that selects data from a specific depth from an A-mode line is used; then the transducer is moved in the 2D plane to sample the entire region at this fixed depth. When the transducer traverses the area in a spiral, an area of 100 cm<sup>2</sup> can be scanned in around 10 seconds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>M-mode</strong>: In M-mode (motion mode) ultrasound, pulses are emitted in quick succession – each time, either an A-mode or B-mode image is taken. Over time, this is analogous to recording a <a class="uri" href="video" title="wikilink">video</a> in ultrasound. As the organ boundaries that produce reflections move relative to the probe, this can be used to determine the velocity of specific organ structures.</li>
<li><strong>Doppler mode</strong>: This mode makes use of the Doppler effect in measuring and visualizing blood flow
<ul>
<li><strong>Color Doppler</strong>: Velocity information is presented as a color-coded overlay on top of a B-mode image</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Doppler</strong>: Doppler information is sampled along a line through the body, and all velocities detected at each time point are presented (on a time line)</li>
<li><strong>Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler</strong>: Doppler information is sampled from only a small sample volume (defined in 2D image), and presented on a timeline</li>
<li><strong><a href="Duplex_ultrasonography" title="wikilink">Duplex</a></strong>: a common name for the simultaneous presentation of 2D and (usually) PW Doppler information. (Using modern ultrasound machines, color Doppler is almost always also used; hence the alternative name <strong>Triplex</strong>.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pulse inversion mode</strong>: In this mode, two successive pulses with opposite sign are emitted and then subtracted from each other. This implies that any linearly responding constituent will disappear while gases with non-linear compressibility stand out. Pulse inversion may also be used in a similar manner as in <strong>Harmonic mode</strong>; see below:</li>
<li><strong>Harmonic mode</strong>: In this mode a deep penetrating fundamental frequency is emitted into the body and a <a href="Second-harmonic_imaging_microscopy" title="wikilink">harmonic overtone</a> is detected. This way noise and artifacts due to reverberation and aberration are greatly reduced. Some also believe that penetration depth can be gained with improved lateral resolution; however, this is not well documented.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expansions">Expansions</h2>

<p>An additional expansion or additional technique of ultrasound is <strong>biplanar ultrasound</strong>, in which the probe has two 2D planes that are perpendicular to each other, providing more efficient localization and detection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Furthermore, an <strong>omniplane</strong> probe is one that can rotate 180° to obtain multiple images.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In <a href="3D_ultrasound" title="wikilink">3D ultrasound</a>, many 2D planes are digitally added together to create a 3-dimensional image of the object.</p>
<h3 id="doppler-ultrasonography">Doppler ultrasonography</h3>

<p>  Sonography can be enhanced with Doppler measurements, which employ the <a href="Doppler_effect" title="wikilink">Doppler effect</a> to assess whether structures (usually blood)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> are moving towards or away from the probe, and its relative velocity. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualised. This is particularly useful in cardiovascular studies (sonography of the vascular system and heart) and essential in many areas such as determining reverse blood flow in the liver vasculature in <a href="portal_hypertension" title="wikilink">portal hypertension</a>. The Doppler information is displayed graphically using spectral Doppler, or as an image using color Doppler (directional Doppler) or power Doppler (non directional Doppler). This Doppler shift falls in the audible range and is often presented audibly using stereo speakers: this produces a very distinctive, although synthetic, pulsating sound.</p>

<p>All modern ultrasound scanners use pulsed Doppler to measure velocity. Pulsed wave machines transmit and receive series of pulses. The frequency shift of each pulse is ignored, however the relative phase changes of the pulses are used to obtain the frequency shift (since frequency is the rate of change of phase). The major advantages of pulsed Doppler over continuous wave is that distance information is obtained (the time between the transmitted and received pulses can be converted into a distance with knowledge of the speed of sound) and gain correction is applied. The disadvantage of pulsed Doppler is that the measurements can suffer from <a class="uri" href="aliasing" title="wikilink">aliasing</a>. The terminology "Doppler ultrasound" or "Doppler sonography", has been accepted to apply to both pulsed and continuous Doppler systems despite the different mechanisms by which the velocity is measured.</p>

<p>It should be noted here that there are no standards for the display of color Doppler. Some laboratories show arteries as red and veins as blue, as medical illustrators usually show them, even though some vessels may have portions flowing towards and portions flowing away from the transducer. This results in the illogical appearance of a vessel being partly a vein and partly an artery. Other laboratories use red to indicate flow toward the transducer and blue away from the transducer. Still other laboratories prefer to display the sonographic Doppler color map more in accord with the prior published physics with the <a href="red_shift" title="wikilink">red shift</a> representing longer waves of echoes (scattered) from blood flowing away from the transducer; and with blue representing the shorter waves of echoes reflecting from blood flowing toward the transducer. Because of this confusion and lack of standards in the various laboratories, the sonographer must understand the underlying acoustic physics of color Doppler and the physiology of normal and abnormal blood flow in the human body (see <a href="Red_shift" title="wikilink">Red shift</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>).</p>

<p>Although <a class="uri" href="Angiography" title="wikilink">Angiography</a> and <a class="uri" href="Venography" title="wikilink">Venography</a> which both use X-ray and contrast injection material are more accurate than Doppler Sonography, Doppler Sonography may be chosen because it is faster, less expensive, and non-invasive.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>A <a href="contrast_media" title="wikilink">contrast medium</a> for medical ultrasonography is a formulation of encapsulated gaseous microbubbles<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> to increase <a class="uri" href="echogenicity" title="wikilink">echogenicity</a> of blood, discovered by Dr Raymond Gramiak in 1968<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> and named <a href="contrast-enhanced_ultrasound" title="wikilink">contrast-enhanced ultrasound</a>.

<p>Microbubbles-based contrast media is administrated <a class="uri" href="intravenously" title="wikilink">intravenously</a> in <a class="uri" href="patient" title="wikilink">patient</a> <a href="blood_stream" title="wikilink">blood stream</a> during the medical ultrasonography examination. The microbubbles being too large in diameter, they stay confined in <a href="blood_vessels" title="wikilink">blood vessels</a> and cannot extravasate towards the <a href="interstitial_fluid" title="wikilink">interstitial fluid</a>. An <a class="uri" href="ultrasound" title="wikilink">ultrasound</a> contrast media is therefore purely intravascular, making it an ideal agent to image <a href="Biological_system" title="wikilink">organ</a> microvascularization for <a href="Medical_diagnosis" title="wikilink">diagnostic</a> purposes.

<p>In oncological practice of medical contrast ultrasonography, clinicians use the method of parametric imaging of vascular signatures<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> invented by Dr Nicolas Rognin in 2010.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> This method is conceived as a <a class="uri" href="cancer" title="wikilink">cancer</a> aided diagnostic tool, facilitating characterization of a suspicious <a class="uri" href="tumor" title="wikilink">tumor</a> (<a href="Malignant_tumor" title="wikilink">malignant</a> versus <a href="Benign_tumor" title="wikilink">benign</a>) in an organ. This method is based on medical <a href="computational_science" title="wikilink">computational science</a> <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> to analyze a time sequence of ultrasound contrast images, a digital video recorded in real-time during patient examination. Two consecutive <a href="signal_processing" title="wikilink">signal processing</a> steps are applied to each <a class="uri" href="pixel" title="wikilink">pixel</a> of the tumor:</p>
<ol>
<li>calculation of a vascular signature (contrast uptake difference with respect to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor);</li>
<li>automatic <a href="Pattern_recognition" title="wikilink">classification</a> of the vascular signature into a unique <a class="uri" href="parameter" title="wikilink">parameter</a>, this last coded in one of the four following <a href="color" title="wikilink">colors</a>:
<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="green" title="wikilink">green</a> for continuous hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake higher than healthy tissue one),</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="blue" title="wikilink">blue</a> for continuous hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake lower than healthy tissue one),</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="red" title="wikilink">red</a> for fast hyper-enhancement (contrast uptake before healthy tissue one) or</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="yellow" title="wikilink">yellow</a> for fast hypo-enhancement (contrast uptake after healthy tissue one).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Once <a href="signal_processing" title="wikilink">signal processing</a> in each pixel completed, a color spatial map of the parameter is displayed on a <a href="computer_monitor" title="wikilink">computer monitor</a>, summarizing all <a class="uri" href="vascular" title="wikilink">vascular</a> information of the tumor in a single image called parametric image (see last figure of press article <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> as clinical examples). This parametric image is interpreted by clinicians based on predominant colorization of the tumor: red indicates a suspicion of <a class="uri" href="malignancy" title="wikilink">malignancy</a> (risk of cancer), green or yellow – a high probability of <a class="uri" href="benignity" title="wikilink">benignity</a>. In the first case (suspicion of <a href="malignant_tumor" title="wikilink">malignant tumor</a>), the clinician typically prescribes a biopsy to confirm the diagnostic or a <a href="CT_scan" title="wikilink">CT scan</a> examination as a second opinion. In the second case (quasi-certain of <a href="benign_tumor" title="wikilink">benign tumor</a>), only a follow-up is needed with a contrast ultrasonography examination a few months later. The main clinical benefits are to avoid a systematic biopsy (risky invasive procedure) of benign tumors or a <a href="CT_scan" title="wikilink">CT scan</a> examination exposing the patient to <a class="uri" href="X-ray" title="wikilink">X-ray</a> radiation. The parametric imaging of vascular signatures method proved to be effective in humans for characterization of tumors in the liver.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> In a <a href="cancer_screening" title="wikilink">cancer screening</a> context, this method might be potentially applicable to other organs such as <a href="Breast_cancer" title="wikilink">breast</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> or <a href="Prostate_cancer" title="wikilink">prostate</a>.</p>
<h3 id="molecular-ultrasonography-ultrasound-molecular-imaging">Molecular ultrasonography (ultrasound molecular imaging)</h3>

<p>The future of contrast ultrasonography is in <a href="molecular_imaging" title="wikilink">molecular imaging</a> with potential clinical applications expected in <a href="cancer_screening" title="wikilink">cancer screening</a> to detect <a href="malignant_tumor" title="wikilink">malignant tumors</a> at their earliest stage of appearance. Molecular ultrasonography (or ultrasound molecular imaging) uses targeted microbubbles originally designed by Dr <a href="Alexander_Klibanov_(biologist)" title="wikilink">Alexander Klibanov</a> in 1997;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> such targeted microbubbles specifically bind or adhere to tumoral microvessels by targeting <a class="uri" href="biomolecular" title="wikilink">biomolecular</a> cancer expression (overexpression of certain biomolecules occurs during <a href="Angiogenesis" title="wikilink">neo-angiogenesis</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> or <a class="uri" href="inflammation" title="wikilink">inflammation</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> processes in malignant tumors). As a result, a few minutes after their injection in blood circulation, the targeted microbubbles accumulate in the malignant tumor; facilitating its localization in a unique ultrasound contrast image. In 2013, the very first exploratory <a href="clinical_trial" title="wikilink">clinical trial</a> in humans for <a href="prostate_cancer" title="wikilink">prostate cancer</a> was completed at <a class="uri" href="Amsterdam" title="wikilink">Amsterdam</a> in the <a class="uri" href="Netherlands" title="wikilink">Netherlands</a> by Dr Hessel Wijkstra.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>In molecular ultrasonography, the technique of <a href="acoustic_radiation_force" title="wikilink">acoustic radiation force</a> (also used for shear wave <a class="uri" href="elastography" title="wikilink">elastography</a>) is applied in order to literally push the targeted microbubbles towards microvessels wall; firstly demonstrated by Dr Paul Dayton in 1999.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> This allows to maximize binding to the malignant tumor; the targeted microbubbles being in more direct contact with cancerous biomolecules expressed at the inner surface of tumoral microvessels. At the stage of scientific <a class="uri" href="preclinical" title="wikilink">preclinical</a> research, the technique of acoustic radiation force was implemented as a prototype in clinical ultrasound systems and validated <em><a href="in_vivo" title="wikilink">in vivo</a></em> in 2D<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> and 3D<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> imaging modes.</p>
<h3 id="elastography-ultrasound-elasticity-imaging">Elastography (ultrasound elasticity imaging)</h3>

<p>Ultrasound is also used for <a class="uri" href="elastography" title="wikilink">elastography</a>. This can be useful in medical diagnoses, as elasticity can discern healthy from unhealthy tissue for specific organs/growths. In some cases unhealthy tissue may have a lower system <a href="Q_factor" title="wikilink">Q</a>, meaning that the system acts more like a large heavy spring as compared to higher values of system Q (healthy tissue) that respond to higher forcing frequencies. Ultrasonic elastography is different from conventional ultrasound, as a transceiver (pair) and a transmitter are used instead of only a transceiver. One <a class="uri" href="transducer" title="wikilink">transducer</a> acts as both the transmitter and receiver to image the region of interest over time. The extra transmitter is a very low frequency transmitter, and perturbs the system so the unhealthy tissue oscillates at a low frequency and the healthy tissue does not. The transceiver, which operates at a high frequency (typically MHz) then measures the displacement of the unhealthy tissue (oscillating at a much lower frequency). The movement of the slowly oscillating tissue is used to determine the elasticity of the material, which can then be used to distinguish healthy tissue from the unhealthy tissue.</p>
<h3 id="compression-ultrasonography">Compression ultrasonography</h3>

<p>Compression ultrasonography is a simplified technique used for quick <a href="deep_vein_thrombosis" title="wikilink">deep vein thrombosis</a> diagnosis. The examination is limited to <a href="common_femoral_vein" title="wikilink">common femoral vein</a> and <a href="popliteal_vein" title="wikilink">popliteal vein</a> only, instead to spend time performing the full examination, <a href="lower_limbs_venous_ultrasonography" title="wikilink">lower limbs venous ultrasonography</a>. It is performed using only one test: vein compression.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>Compression ultrasonography has both high <a href="sensitivity_and_specificity" title="wikilink">sensitivity and specificity</a> for detecting proximal deep vein thrombosis only in symptomatic patients. Results are not reliable when the patient is symptomless and must be checked, for example in high risk postoperative patients mainly in orthopedic patients.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>

<p>As with all imaging modalities, ultrasonography has its list of positive and negative attributes.</p>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>It images <a class="uri" href="muscle" title="wikilink">muscle</a>, <a href="soft_tissue" title="wikilink">soft tissue</a>, and bone surfaces very well and is particularly useful for delineating the interfaces between solid and fluid-filled spaces.</li>
<li>It renders "live" images, where the operator can dynamically select the most useful section for diagnosing and documenting changes, often enabling rapid diagnoses. Live images also allow for ultrasound-guided biopsies or injections, which can be cumbersome with other imaging modalities.</li>
<li>It shows the structure of organs.</li>
<li>It has no known long-term side effects and rarely causes any discomfort to the patient.</li>
<li>Equipment is widely available and comparatively flexible.</li>
<li>Small, easily carried scanners are available; examinations can be performed at the bedside.</li>
<li>Relatively inexpensive compared to other modes of investigation, such as <a href="X-ray_computed_tomography" title="wikilink">computed X-ray tomography</a>, <a href="Dual_energy_X-ray_absorptiometry" title="wikilink">DEXA</a> or <a href="magnetic_resonance_imaging" title="wikilink">magnetic resonance imaging</a>.</li>
<li><a href="Image_resolution#Spatial_resolution" title="wikilink">Spatial resolution</a> is better in high frequency ultrasound transducers than it is in most other imaging modalities.</li>
<li>Through the use of an <a href="Ultrasound_research_interface" title="wikilink">Ultrasound research interface</a>, an ultrasound device can offer a relatively inexpensive, real-time, and flexible method for capturing data required for special research purposes for tissue characterization and development of new image processing techniques</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Double aort artifact in sonography due to difference in velocity of sound waves in muscle and fat.</figcaption>

<ul>
<li>Sonographic devices have trouble penetrating <a class="uri" href="bone" title="wikilink">bone</a>. For example, sonography of the adult brain is very limited though improvements are being made in transcranial ultrasonography.</li>
<li>Sonography performs very poorly when there is a gas between the transducer and the organ of interest, due to the extreme differences in <a href="acoustic_impedance" title="wikilink">acoustic impedance</a>. For example, overlying gas in the gastrointestinal tract often makes ultrasound scanning of the <a class="uri" href="pancreas" title="wikilink">pancreas</a> difficult, and lung imaging is not possible (apart from demarcating pleural effusions).</li>
<li>Even in the absence of bone or air, the depth penetration of ultrasound may be limited depending on the frequency of imaging. Consequently, there might be difficulties imaging structures deep in the body, especially in obese patients.</li>
<li>Body habitus has a large influence on image quality. Image quality and accuracy of diagnosis is limited with obese patients, overlying subcutaneous fat attenuates the sound beam and a lower frequency transducer is required (with lower resolution)</li>
<li>The method is operator-dependent. A high level of skill and experience is needed to acquire good-quality images and make accurate diagnoses.</li>
<li>There is no scout image as there is with CT and MRI. Once an image has been acquired there is no exact way to tell which part of the body was imaged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="risks-and-side-effects">Risks and side-effects</h2>

<p>Ultrasonography is generally considered a safe imaging modality.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>Diagnostic ultrasound studies of the fetus are generally considered to be safe during pregnancy. This diagnostic procedure should be performed only when there is a valid medical indication, and the lowest possible ultrasonic exposure setting should be used to gain the necessary diagnostic information under the "as low as reasonably practicable" or <a class="uri" href="ALARP" title="wikilink">ALARP</a> principle.</p>

<p>World Health Organizations technical report series 875 (1998).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> supports that ultrasound is harmless: "Diagnostic ultrasound is recognized as a safe, effective, and highly flexible imaging modality capable of providing clinically relevant information about most parts of the body in a rapid and cost-effective fashion". Although there is no evidence ultrasound could be harmful for the fetus, US Food and Drug Administration views promotion, selling, or leasing of ultrasound equipment for making "keepsake fetal videos" to be an unapproved use of a medical device.</p>

<p>Medical ultrasonography should not be performed without a medical indication to perform it. To do otherwise would be to perform <a href="unnecessary_health_care" title="wikilink">unnecessary health care</a> to patients, which bring unwarranted costs and may lead to other testing. Overuse of ultrasonography is reported in the United States, especially as routine screening for deep vein thrombosis after orthopedic surgeries in patients who are not at heightened risk for having that condition.<ref name="AAOSfive">, which cites</ref></p>

<h2 id="obstetric-ultrasound">Obstetric ultrasound</h2>

<p>Obstetric ultrasound can be used to identify many conditions that would be harmful to the mother and the baby. Many health care professionals consider the risk of leaving these conditions undiagnosed to be much greater than the very small risk, if any, associated with undergoing an ultrasound scan.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Sonography" title="wikilink">Sonography</a> is used routinely in obstetric appointments during pregnancy, but the FDA discourages its use for non-medical purposes such as fetal keepsake videos and photos, even though it is the same technology used in hospitals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p>Obstetric ultrasound is primarily used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date the pregnancy (<a href="gestational_age" title="wikilink">gestational age</a>)</li>
<li>Confirm fetal viability</li>
<li>Determine location of <a class="uri" href="fetus" title="wikilink">fetus</a>, intrauterine vs <a href="Ectopic_pregnancy" title="wikilink">ectopic</a></li>
<li>Check the location of the placenta in relation to the cervix</li>
<li>Check for the number of fetuses (<a href="multiple_pregnancy" title="wikilink">multiple pregnancy</a>)</li>
<li>Check for major physical abnormalities.</li>
<li>Assess fetal growth (for evidence of <a href="intrauterine_growth_restriction" title="wikilink">intrauterine growth restriction</a> (<a class="uri" href="IUGR" title="wikilink">IUGR</a>))</li>
<li>Check for fetal movement and heartbeat.</li>
<li>Determine the sex of the baby</li>
</ul>

<p>Its results are occasionally incorrect, producing a false positive (the <a href="Cochrane_Collaboration" title="wikilink">Cochrane Collaboration</a> is a relevant effort to improve the reliability of health care trials). False detection may result in patients being warned of birth defects when no such defect exists. Sex determination is only accurate after 12 weeks gestation. When balancing risk and reward, there are recommendations to avoid the use of routine ultrasound for low risk pregnancies. In many countries ultrasound is used routinely in the management of all pregnancies.</p>

<p>According to the European Committee of Medical Ultrasound Safety (ECMUS)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Ultrasonic examinations should only be performed by competent personnel who are trained and updated in safety matters. Ultrasound produces heating, pressure changes and mechanical disturbances in tissue. Diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce temperature rises that are hazardous to sensitive organs and the embryo/fetus. Biological effects of non-thermal origin have been reported in animals but, to date, no such effects have been demonstrated in humans, except when a microbubble <a href="contrast_agent" title="wikilink">contrast agent</a> is present.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, care should be taken to use low power settings and avoid pulsed wave scanning of the fetal brain unless specifically indicated in high risk pregnancies.</p>

<p>Ultrasound scanners have different <a href="Doppler_sonography" title="wikilink">Doppler</a>-techniques to visualize arteries and veins. The most common is colour doppler or power doppler, but also other techniques like b-flow are used to show bloodflow in an organ. By using pulsed wave doppler or continuous wave doppler bloodflow velocities can be calculated.</p>

<p>Figures released for the period 2005–2006 by the UK Government (Department of Health) show that non-obstetric ultrasound examinations constituted more than 65% of the total number of ultrasound scans conducted.</p>
<h3 id="society-and-culture">Society and Culture</h3>

<p>Recent studies have stressed the importance of framing “reproductive health matters cross-culturally”, particularly when understanding the “new phenomenon” of “the proliferation of ultrasound imaging” in developing countries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In 2004, Tine Gammeltoft interviewed 400 women in Hanoi’s Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital; each “had an average of 6.6 scans during her pregnancy”, much higher than five years ago when “a pregnant woman might or might not have had a single scan during her pregnancy” in Vietnam.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Gammeltoft explains that “many Asian countries” see “the foetus as an ambiguous being” unlike in Western medicine where it is common to think of the foetus as “materially stable”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> Therefore, although women, particularly in Asian countries, “express intense uncertainties regarding the safety and credibility of this technology”, it is overused for its “immediate reassurance”.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="regulation">Regulation</h2>

<p>Diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound equipment is regulated in the USA by the <a href="Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="wikilink">Food and Drug Administration</a>, and worldwide by other national regulatory agencies. The FDA limits acoustic output using several metrics; generally, other agencies accept the FDA-established guidelines.</p>

<p>Currently, New Mexico is the only US state which regulates diagnostic medical sonographers. Certification examinations for sonographers are available in the US from three organizations: the <a href="American_Registry_for_Diagnostic_Medical_Sonography" title="wikilink">American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography</a>, <a href="http://www.cci-online.org">Cardiovascular Credentialing International</a> and the <a href="American_Registry_of_Radiologic_Technologists" title="wikilink">American Registry of Radiologic Technologists</a>.</p>

<p>The primary regulated metrics are <a href="Mechanical_Index" title="wikilink">Mechanical Index</a> (MI), a metric associated with the cavitation bio-effect, and Thermal Index (TI) a metric associated with the tissue heating bio-effect. The FDA requires that the machine not exceed established limits, which are reasonably conservative so as to maintain diagnostic ultrasound as a safe imaging modality. This requires <a href="self-policing" title="wikilink">self-regulation</a> on the part of the manufacturer in terms of the machine's calibration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>

<p>Ultrasound-based pre-natal care and sex screening technologies were launched in India in the 1980s. With concerns about its misuse for <a href="sex-selective_abortion" title="wikilink">sex-selective abortion</a>, the Government of India passed the <a href="Pre-Conception_and_Pre-Natal_Diagnostic_Techniques_Act,_1994" title="wikilink">Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PNDT)</a> in 1994 to regulate legal and illegal uses of ultrasound equipment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> The law was further amended into the Pre-Conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) (PCPNDT) Act in 2004 to deter and punish prenatal sex screening and sex selective abortion.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> It is currently illegal and a punishable crime in India to determine or disclose the sex of a fetus using ultrasound equipment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Ultrasonic energy was first applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr <a href="George_Ludwig" title="wikilink">George Ludwig</a> at the Naval Medical Research Institute, <a href="Bethesda,_Maryland" title="wikilink">Bethesda, Maryland</a> in the late 1940s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> English-born physicist <a href="John_J._Wild" title="wikilink">John Wild</a> (1914–2009) first used ultrasound to assess the thickness of bowel tissue as early as 1949; he has been described as the "father of medical ultrasound".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Subsequent advances in the field took place concurrently in several countries.</p>
<h3 id="france">France</h3>

<p>In his book "L'investigation vasculaire par ultrasonographie Doppler" (Ed Masson, 1977) <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Dr <a href="Claude_Franceschi" title="wikilink">Claude Franceschi</a> laid down the Doppler Ultrasound fundamentals of the hemodynamics semiotics, which are still in use in current Doppler arterial and venous Duplex Ultrasound investigations.</p>
<h3 id="scotland">Scotland</h3>

<p>Parallel developments in <a class="uri" href="Glasgow" title="wikilink">Glasgow</a>, <a class="uri" href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scotland</a> by Professor <a href="Ian_Donald" title="wikilink">Ian Donald</a> and colleagues at the <a href="Glasgow_Royal_Maternity_Hospital" title="wikilink">Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital</a> (GRMH) led to the first diagnostic applications of the technique. Donald was an <a href="obstetrics" title="wikilink">obstetrician</a> with a self-confessed "childish interest in machines, electronic and otherwise", who, having treated the wife of one of the company's directors, was invited to visit the Research Department of boilermakers <a href="Doosan_Babcock" title="wikilink">Babcock &amp; Wilcox</a> at <a class="uri" href="Renfrew" title="wikilink">Renfrew</a>, where he used their industrial ultrasound equipment to conduct experiments on various morbid anatomical specimens and assess their ultrasonic characteristics. Together with the medical physicist Tom Brown and fellow obstetrician Dr John MacVicar, Donald refined the equipment to enable differentiation of pathology in live volunteer patients. These findings were reported in <em><a href="The_Lancet" title="wikilink">The Lancet</a></em> on 7 June 1958<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> as "Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound" – possibly one of the most important papers ever published in the field of diagnostic <a href="medical_imaging" title="wikilink">medical imaging</a>.</p>

<p>At GRMH, Professor Donald and Dr James Willocks then refined their techniques to obstetric applications including fetal head measurement to assess the size and growth of the fetus. With the opening of the new Queen Mother's Hospital in <a class="uri" href="Yorkhill" title="wikilink">Yorkhill</a> in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Dr <a href="Stuart_Campbell_(Obstetrician_and_Gynaecologist)" title="wikilink">Stuart Campbell</a>'s pioneering work on <a class="uri" href="fetal" title="wikilink">fetal</a> <a class="uri" href="cephalometry" title="wikilink">cephalometry</a> led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth. As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, fetal abnormality and <em><a href="placenta_praevia" title="wikilink">placenta praevia</a></em>. Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine.</p>

<p>Medical ultrasonography was used in 1953 at <a href="Lund_University" title="wikilink">Lund University</a> by <a href="cardiology" title="wikilink">cardiologist</a> Inge Edler and <a href="Carl_Hellmuth_Hertz" title="wikilink">Carl Hellmuth Hertz</a>, the son of <a href="Gustav_Ludwig_Hertz" title="wikilink">Gustav Ludwig Hertz</a>, who was a graduate student at the department of <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a>.</p>

<p>Edler had asked Hertz if it was possible to use <a class="uri" href="radar" title="wikilink">radar</a> to look into the body, but Hertz said this was impossible. However, he said, it might be possible to use ultrasonography. Hertz was familiar with using ultrasonic reflectoscopes for <a href="nondestructive_testing" title="wikilink">nondestructive materials testing</a>, and together they developed the idea of using this method in medicine.</p>

<p>The first successful measurement of heart activity was made on October 29, 1953 using a device borrowed from the ship construction company <a class="uri" href="Kockums" title="wikilink">Kockums</a> in <a class="uri" href="Malmö" title="wikilink">Malmö</a>. On December 16 the same year, the method was used to generate an echo-encephalogram (ultrasonic probe of the <a class="uri" href="brain" title="wikilink">brain</a>). Edler and Hertz published their findings in 1954.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner. Their work had been supported by <a href="United_States_Public_Health_Service" title="wikilink">U.S. Public Health Services</a> and the <a href="University_of_Colorado_Denver" title="wikilink">University of Colorado</a>. Wright and Meyerdirk left the University to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>In the late 1960s <a href="Gene_Strandness" title="wikilink">Dr Gene Strandness</a> and the bio-engineering group at the <a href="University_of_Washington" title="wikilink">University of Washington</a> conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for vascular disease. Eventually, they developed technologies to use duplex imaging, or Doppler in conjunction with B-mode scanning, to view vascular structures in real-time, while also providing hemodynamic information.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>The first demonstration of color Doppler was by Geoff Stevenson, who was involved in the early developments and medical use of Doppler shifted ultrasonic energy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
