   Radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy      Radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy   The law of radioactive displacements , also known as Fajans and Soddy law , in radiochemistry and nuclear physics , is a rule governing the transmutation of elements during radioactive decay . It is named after Frederick Soddy and Kazimierz Fajans , who independently arrived at it at about the same time in 1913. 1 2  The law describes which chemical element and isotope is created during the particular type of radioactive decay:   In alpha decay , an element is created with an atomic number less by 2 and a mass number less by four of that of the parent radioisotope, e.g.:        U   92  238   →   Th   90  234      normal-→   superscript   subscript  U  92   238    superscript   subscript  Th  90   234     {}^{238}_{92}\text{U}\to{}^{234}_{90}\text{Th}      In beta decay , the mass number remains unchanged while the atomic number becomes greater by 1 than that of the parent radioisotope, e.g.:        Pb   82  212   →   Bi   83  212      normal-→   superscript   subscript  Pb  82   212    superscript   subscript  Bi  83   212     {}^{212}_{82}\text{Pb}\to{}^{212}_{83}\text{Bi}      This corresponds to β − decay or electron emission, the only form of beta decay which had been observed when Fajans and Soddy proposed their law in 1913. Later, in the 1930s, other forms of beta decay known as β + decay ( positron emission ) and electron capture were discovered, in which the atomic number becomes less by 1 than that of the parent radioisotope, e.g.,:        N   7  13   →   C   6  13      normal-→   superscript   subscript  N  7   13    superscript   subscript  C  6   13     {}^{13}_{7}\text{N}\to{}^{13}_{6}\text{C}     See also   Decay modes in tabular form  Decay chain   References  "  Category:Radiochemistry  Category:Nuclear physics     Kasimir Fajans, "Radioactive transformations and the periodic system of the elements".
