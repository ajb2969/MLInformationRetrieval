   Greibach normal form      Greibach normal form   In formal language theory, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form (GNF) if the right-hand sides of all production rules start with a terminal symbol , optionally followed by some variables. A non-strict form allows one exception to this format restriction for allowing the empty word (epsilon, ε) to be a member of the described language. The normal form was established by Sheila Greibach and it bears her name.  More precisely, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form, if all production rules are of the form:  $$A \to a A_1 A_2 \cdots A_n$$ or  $$S \to \varepsilon$$ where $A$ is a nonterminal symbol , $a$ is a terminal symbol, $A_1 A_2 \ldots A_n$ is a (possibly empty) sequence of nonterminal symbols not including the start symbol, $S$ is the start symbol, and ε is the empty word . 1  Observe that the grammar does not have left recursions .  Every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar in Greibach normal form. 2 Various constructions exist. Some do not permit the second form of rule and cannot transform context-free grammars that can generate the empty word. For one such construction the size of the constructed grammar is O(n 4 ) in the general case and O(n 3 ) if no derivation of the original grammar consists of a single nonterminal symbol, where n is the size of the original grammar. 3 This conversion can be used to prove that every context-free language can be accepted by a real-time pushdown automaton , i.e., the automaton reads a letter from its input every step.  Given a grammar in GNF and a derivable string in the grammar with length n , any top-down parser will halt at depth n .
