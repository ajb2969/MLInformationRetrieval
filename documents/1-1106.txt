   Weak topology      Weak topology   In mathematics , weak topology is an alternative term for initial topology . The term is most commonly used for the initial topology of a topological vector space (such as a normed vector space ) with respect to its continuous dual . The remainder of this article will deal with this case, which is one of the concepts of functional analysis .  One may call subsets of a topological vector space weakly closed (respectively, weakly compact , etc.) if they are closed (respectively, compact , etc.) with respect to the weak topology. Likewise, functions are sometimes called weakly continuous (respectively, weakly differentiable , weakly analytic , etc.) if they are continuous (respectively, differentiable , analytic , etc.) with respect to the weak topology.  The weak and strong topologies  Let K be a topological field , namely a field with a topology such that addition, multiplication, and division are continuous . In most applications K will be either the field of complex numbers or the field of real numbers with the familiar topologies. Let X be a topological vector space over K . Namely, X is a K  vector space equipped with a topology so that vector addition and scalar multiplication are continuous.  We may define a possibly different topology on X using the continuous (or topological ) dual space  X * . The topological dual space consists of all linear functions from X into the base field K that are continuous with respect to the given topology. The weak topology on X is the initial topology with respect to X * . In other words, it is the coarsest topology (the topology with the fewest open sets) such that each element of X * remains a continuous function . In order to distinguish the weak topology from the original topology on X , the original topology is often called the strong topology .  A subbase for the weak topology is the collection of sets of the form œÜ ‚àí1 ( U ) where œÜ ‚àà X * and U is an open subset of the base field K . In other words, a subset of X is open in the weak topology if and only if it can be written as a union of (possibly infinitely many) sets, each of which is an intersection of finitely many sets of the form œÜ ‚àí1 ( U ).  More generally, if F is a subset of the algebraic dual space , then the initial topology of X with respect to F , denoted by œÉ( X , F ), is the '''weak topology with respect to F '''. If one takes F to be the whole continuous dual space of X , then the weak topology with respect to F coincides with the weak topology defined above.  If the field K has an absolute value     |  ‚ãÖ  |     fragments  normal-|  normal-‚ãÖ  normal-|    |\cdot|   , then the weak topology œÉ( X , F ) is induced by the family of seminorms ,        ‚à•  x  ‚à•   f    =  def    |   f   (  x  )    |        subscript   norm  x   f    def        f  x      \|x\|_{f}\overset{\text{def}}{=}|f(x)|     for all f ‚àà F and x ‚àà X . In particular, weak topologies are locally convex . From this point of view, the weak topology is the coarsest polar topology ; see weak topology (polar topology) for details. Specifically, if F is a vector space of linear functionals on X which separates points of X , then the continuous dual of X with respect to the topology œÉ( X , F ) is precisely equal to F .  Weak convergence  The weak topology is characterized by the following condition: a net ( x Œª ) in X converges in the weak topology to the element x of X if and only if œÜ( x Œª ) converges to œÜ( x ) in R or C for all œÜ in X* .  In particular, if x n is a sequence in X , then x n  converges weakly to  x if       œï   (   x  n   )    ‚Üí   œï   (  x  )       normal-‚Üí    œï   subscript  x  n      œï  x     \phi(x_{n})\to\phi(x)     as n ‚Üí ‚àû for all œÜ ‚àà X * . In this case, it is customary to write       x  n    ‚ü∂  w   x       subscript  x  n    normal-w  normal-‚ü∂   x    x_{n}\overset{\mathrm{w}}{\longrightarrow}x     or, sometimes,        x  n   ‚áÄ  x   .     normal-‚áÄ   subscript  x  n   x    x_{n}\rightharpoonup x.     Other properties  If X is equipped with the weak topology, then addition and scalar multiplication remain continuous operations, and X is a locally convex topological vector space .  If X is a normed space, then the dual space X* is itself a normed vector space by using the norm «ÅœÜ«Å = sup «Åx«Å‚â§1 |œÜ( x )|. This norm gives rise to a topology, called the strong topology , on X* . This is the topology of uniform convergence . The uniform and strong topologies are generally different for other spaces of linear maps; see below.  The weak-* topology  A space X can be embedded into the double dual  X** by      x  ‚Ü¶   T  x      maps-to  x   subscript  T  x     x\mapsto T_{x}     where         T  x    (  œï  )    =   œï   (  x  )     .         subscript  T  x   œï     œï  x     T_{x}(\phi)=\phi(x).     Thus T : X ‚Üí X** is an injective linear mapping, though not necessarily surjective (spaces for which this canonical embedding is surjective are called reflexive ). The weak-* topology on X* is the weak topology induced by the image of T : T(X) ‚äÇ X** . In other words, it is the coarsest topology such that the maps T x , defined by T x (œÜ) = œÜ(x) from X* to the base field R or C remain continuous.  Weak-* convergence  A net  œÜ Œª in X* is convergent to œÜ in the weak-* topology if it converges pointwise:        œï  Œª    (  x  )    ‚Üí   œï   (  x  )       normal-‚Üí     subscript  œï  Œª   x     œï  x     \phi_{\lambda}(x)\rightarrow\phi(x)     for all x in X . In particular, a sequence of œÜ n ‚àà X * converges to œÜ provided that        œï  n    (  x  )    ‚Üí   œï   (  x  )       normal-‚Üí     subscript  œï  n   x     œï  x     \phi_{n}(x)\to\phi(x)     for all x in X . In this case, one writes       œï  n    ‚Üí   w  *    œï       subscript  œï  n     superscript  w    normal-‚Üí   œï    \phi_{n}\overset{w^{*}}{\rightarrow}\phi     as n ‚Üí ‚àû.  Weak-* convergence is sometimes called the topology of simple convergence or the topology of pointwise convergence . Indeed, it coincides with the topology of pointwise convergence of linear functionals.  Other properties  By definition, the weak* topology is weaker than the weak topology on X* . An important fact about the weak* topology is the Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem : if X is normed, then the closed unit ball in X* is weak*- compact (more generally, the polar in X* of a neighborhood of 0 in X is weak*-compact). Moreover, the closed unit ball in a normed space X is compact in the weak topology if and only if X is reflexive .  In more generality, let F be locally compact valued field (e.g., the reals, the complex numbers, or any of the p-adic number systems). Let X be a normed topological vector space over F , compatible with the absolute value in F . Then in X *, the topological dual space X of continuous F -valued linear functionals on X , all norm-closed balls are compact in the weak-* topology.  If a normed space X is separable, then the weak-* topology is metrizable on the norm-bounded subsets of X* . If X is a Banach space, the weak-* topology is not metrizable on all of X * unless X is finite-dimensional. 1  Examples  Hilbert spaces  Consider, for example, the difference between strong and weak convergence of functions in the Hilbert space  L 2 ( R n ) . Strong convergence of a sequence œà k ‚àà L 2 ( R n ) to an element œà means that        ‚à´   ùêë  n        |    œà  k   -  œà   |   2    d   Œº     ‚Üí   0      normal-‚Üí    subscript    superscript  ùêë  n       superscript       subscript  œà  k   œà    2   normal-d  Œº    0    \int_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}|\psi_{k}-\psi|^{2}\,{\rm d}\mu\,\to 0\,     as k ‚Üí‚àû. Here the notion of convergence corresponds to the norm on L 2 .  In contrast weak convergence only demands that        ‚à´   ùêë  n       œà  ¬Ø   k    f   d  Œº    ‚Üí    ‚à´   ùêë  n      œà  ¬Ø    f   d  Œº       normal-‚Üí    subscript    superscript  ùêë  n       subscript   normal-¬Ø  œà   k   f  normal-d  Œº      subscript    superscript  ùêë  n       normal-¬Ø  œà   f  normal-d  Œº      \int_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}\bar{\psi}_{k}f\,\mathrm{d}\mu\to\int_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}%
 \bar{\psi}f\,\mathrm{d}\mu     for all functions f ‚àà L 2 (or, more typically, all f in a dense subset of L 2 such as a space of test functions , if the sequence { œà k } is bounded). For given test functions, the relevant notion of convergence only corresponds to the topology used in C .  For example, in the Hilbert space L 2 (0,œÄ), the sequence of functions        œà  k    (  x  )    =     2  /  œÄ     sin   (   k  x   )            subscript  œà  k   x         2  œÄ        k  x       \psi_{k}(x)=\sqrt{2/\pi}\sin(kx)     form an orthonormal basis . In particular, the (strong) limit of œà k as k ‚Üí‚àû does not exist. On the other hand, by the Riemann‚ÄìLebesgue lemma , the weak limit exists and is zero.  Distributions  One normally obtains spaces of distributions by forming the strong dual of a space of test functions (such as the compactly supported smooth functions on R n ). In an alternative construction of such spaces, one can take the weak dual of a space of test functions inside a Hilbert space such as L 2 . Thus one is led to consider the idea of a rigged Hilbert space .  Operator topologies  If X and Y are topological vector spaces, the space L ( X , Y ) of continuous linear operators  f : X ‚Üí Y may carry a variety of different possible topologies. The naming of such topologies depends on the kind of topology one is using on the target space Y to define operator convergence . There are, in general, a vast array of possible operator topologies on L ( X , Y ), whose naming is not entirely intuitive.  For example, the strong operator topology on L ( X , Y ) is the topology of pointwise convergence . For instance, if Y is a normed space, then this topology is defined by the seminorms indexed by x ‚àà X :       f  ‚Ü¶    ‚à•   f   (  x  )    ‚à•   Y    .     maps-to  f   subscript   norm    f  x    Y     f\mapsto\|f(x)\|_{Y}.     More generally, if a family of seminorms Q defines the topology on Y , then the seminorms p q,x on L ( X , Y ) defining the strong topology are given by        p   q  ,  x    :   f  ‚Ü¶   q   (   f   (  x  )    )      ,     normal-:   subscript  p   q  x     maps-to  f    q    f  x       p_{q,x}:f\mapsto q(f(x)),     indexed by q ‚àà Q and x ‚àà X .
