Glycine transaminase

In enzymology, a glycine transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glycine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  glyoxylate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycine and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are glyoxylate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include glutamic-glyoxylic transaminase, glycine aminotransferase, glyoxylate-glutamic transaminase, L-glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase, and glyoxylate-glutamate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
