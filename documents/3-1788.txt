   Pursuit curve      Pursuit curve   A curve of pursuit is a curve constructed by analogy to having a point or points representing pursuers and pursuees; the curve of pursuit is the curve traced by the pursuers.  With the paths of the pursuer and pursuee parameterized in time, the pursuee is always on the pursuer's tangent . That is, given F ( t ) the pursuer (follower) and L ( t ) the pursuee (leader), there is for every t with F ′( t ) ≠ 0 an x such that        L   (  t  )    =    F   (  t  )    +   x   F  ′    (  t  )      .        L  t       F  t     x   superscript  F  normal-′   t      L(t)=F(t)+xF^{\prime}(t).\,     Multiple pursuers  Typical drawings of curves of pursuit have each point acting as both pursuer and pursuee, inside a polygon , and having each pursuer pursue the adjacent point on the polygon. An example of this is the mice problem . {{-}}  See also   Radiodrome  Logarithmic spiral  Tractrix   External links   Mathworld , with a slightly narrower definition that | L ′( t )| and | F ′( t )| are constant  MacTutor Pursuit curve   "  Category:Curves
