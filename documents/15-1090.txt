   Stadium (geometry)      Stadium (geometry)   A stadium is a two-dimensional geometric shape constructed of a rectangle with semicircles at a pair of opposite sides. 1 An alternate name for this shape is a discorectangle . 2  A capsule is produced by revolving a stadium around the line of symmetry that bisects the semicircles.  The shape is used for athletics and horse racing tracks.  Formulas  The perimeter of a stadium is calculated by the formula    P  =   2   (    π  r   +  a   )        P    2      π  r   a      P=2(\pi r+a)   and the area by     A  =    π   r  2    +   2  r  a    =   r   (    π  r   +   2  a    )     ,        A      π   superscript  r  2      2  r  a           r      π  r     2  a        A=\pi r^{2}+2ra=r(\pi r+2a),   where a is the length of the straight sides and r is the radius of the semicircles. 3  See also   Oval  Capsule (geometry)  Ellipse   References  "  Category:Elementary shapes     ↩  ↩  ↩
