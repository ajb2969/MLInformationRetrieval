Stadium (geometry)

  A stadium is a two-dimensional geometric shape constructed of a rectangle with semicircles at a pair of opposite sides.1 An alternate name for this shape is a discorectangle.2
A capsule is produced by revolving a stadium around the line of symmetry that bisects the semicircles.
The shape is used for athletics and horse racing tracks.
Formulas
The perimeter of a stadium is calculated by the formula 
 
 
 
  and the area by
