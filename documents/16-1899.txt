   Implication(FCA)      Implication(FCA)   In formal concept analysis (FCA) and closure system attributes are analyzed via their (simultaneous) occurrences (= objects). The implicational analysis deals with algorithms to find a minimal set of rules, by which attributes can be inferred from others (implications).  Definition  A pair of sets    (  U  ,  V  )     U  V    (U,V)   is an implication .    U  ⊆  A      U  A    U\subseteq A   and    V  ⊆  A      V  A    V\subseteq A   . U is the premise and V is the conclusion .   A   A   A   stands for attributes.  A set W respects     U  →  V     normal-→  U  V    U\rightarrow V   , if    U  ⊈   W  or  V   ⊆  W       not-subset-of-nor-equals  U    W  or  V        W     U\nsubseteq W\text{ or }V\subseteq W   .  1  Implications in a Concept Lattice      U  →  V     normal-→  U  V    U\rightarrow V    holds in a concept lattice, if every intent respects it. This is true if   iff     U  ′   ⊆   V  ′        superscript  U  normal-′    superscript  V  normal-′     U^{\prime}\subseteq V^{\prime}   .    iff    V  ⊆   U  ′′       V   superscript  U  ′′     V\subseteq U^{\prime\prime}   .   An implication    U  →  V     normal-→  U  V    U\rightarrow V   follows semantically from a set L of implications, if each subset of   A   A   A   respecting L also respects    U  →  V     normal-→  U  V    U\rightarrow V   . L is closed , if it contains all implications that follow from L.  A set L of implications that hold in a context is called sound . It is called complete if every implications that holds in the context follows from L. L is non-redundant if implications that follow from L are not in L.  If L is a set of implications, then    {   X  ⊆  A   |    X    respects   L   }     conditional-set    X  A     X  respects  L     \{X\subseteq A|X\;\text{respects}\;L\}   is a closure system .  2  Implication Basis  Let     X   ↦   X  ′′      maps-to  X   superscript  X  ′′     X\;\mapsto\;X^{\prime\prime}   be a closure operator then P is pseudo-closed if        P   ≠   P  ′′       P   superscript  P  ′′     P\;\neq\;P^{\prime\prime}         Q  ⊂  P  ⟹   Q  ′′   ⊆  P        Q  P        superscript  Q  ′′        P     Q\subset P\implies Q^{\prime\prime}\subseteq P      The set    {   P  ↦   P  ′′    |    P   pseudo-closed   }     conditional-set   maps-to  P   superscript  P  ′′      P  pseudo-closed     \{P\mapsto P^{\prime\prime}|P\;\text{pseudo-closed}\}   is sound , complete and non-redundant . It is called Duquenne-Guiges-Basis (D-G-basis) or Stem basis .  3  There cannot be a implication basis with less implications than the Duquenne-Guiges-Basis, but one can choose implications that are simpler regarding    ∑    |  U  |    |  V  |            U     V      \sum|U||V|   . Such implications are    U  →  V     normal-→  U  V    U\rightarrow V   with    V  ≠  ∅      V     V\neq\emptyset   and     U  ∩  V   =  ∅        U  V      U\cap V=\emptyset   . 4  References  "  Category:Mathematics     Implications by Ganter and Stumme ↩    Endliche Hüllensysteme und ihre Implikationenbasen (Finite hull systems and their implications) 1 ↩
