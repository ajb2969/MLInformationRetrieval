Implication(FCA)

In formal concept analysis (FCA) and closure system attributes are analyzed via their (simultaneous) occurrences (= objects). The implicational analysis deals with algorithms to find a minimal set of rules, by which attributes can be inferred from others (implications).
Definition
A pair of sets 
 
 
 
  is an implication. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . U is the premise and V is the conclusion. 
 
 
 
  stands for attributes.
A set W respects

 
 , if

Implications in a Concept Lattice


holds in a concept lattice, if every intent respects it. This is true if

An implication 
 
 
 
  follows semantically from a set L of implications, if each subset of 
 
 
 
  respecting L also respects 
 
 
 
 . L is closed, if it contains all implications that follow from L.
A set L of implications that hold in a context is called sound. It is called complete if every implications that holds in the context follows from L. L is non-redundant if implications that follow from L are not in L.
If L is a set of implications, then 
 
 
 
  is a closure system.

Implication Basis
Let 
 
 
 
  be a closure operator then P is pseudo-closed if








The set 
 
 
 
  is sound, complete and non-redundant. It is called Duquenne-Guiges-Basis (D-G-basis) or Stem basis.

There cannot be a implication basis with less implications than the Duquenne-Guiges-Basis, but one can choose implications that are simpler regarding 
 
 
 
 . Such implications are 
 
 
 
  with
