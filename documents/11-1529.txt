   Isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) kinase      Isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) kinase   In enzymology , a [isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+)] kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :   ATP + [isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP + )]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + [isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP + )] phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) , whereas its two products are ADP and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) phosphate.  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins ( protein-serine/threonine kinases ).  Other names  The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+)] phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include [isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+)] kinase , ICDH kinase/phosphatase , IDH kinase , IDH kinase/phosphatase , IDH-K/P , IDHK/P , isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase (phosphorylating) , isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase , and STK3 .
