   Zero (complex analysis)      Zero (complex analysis)   In complex analysis , a zero (sometimes called a root ) of a holomorphic function  f is a complex number  a such that f ( a ) = 0.  Multiplicity of a zero  A complex number a is a simple zero of f , or a zero of multiplicity 1 of f , if f can be written as       f   (  z  )    =    (   z  -  a   )   g   (  z  )          f  z       z  a   g  z     f(z)=(z-a)g(z)\,     where g is a holomorphic function  g such that g ( a ) is not zero.  Generally, the multiplicity of the zero of f at a is the positive integer n for which there is a holomorphic function g such that       f   (  z  )    =     (   z  -  a   )   n   g   (  z  )    and   g   (  a  )    ≠   0.           f  z      superscript    z  a   n   g  z  and  g  a        0.     f(z)=(z-a)^{n}g(z)\ \mbox{and}\ g(a)\neq 0.\,     The multiplicity of a zero a is also known as the order of vanishing of the function at a .  Existence of zeros  The fundamental theorem of algebra says that every nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one zero in the complex plane . This is in contrast to the situation with real zeros: some polynomial functions with real coefficients have no real zeros. An example is f ( x ) = x 2 + 1.  Properties  An important property of the set of zeros of a holomorphic function of one variable (that is not identically zero) is that the zeros are isolated. In other words, for any zero of a holomorphic function there is a small disc around the zero which contains no other zeros. There are also some theorems in complex analysis which show the connections between the zeros of a holomorphic (or meromorphic) function and other properties of the function. In particular Jensen's formula and Weierstrass factorization theorem are results for complex functions which have no counterpart for functions of a real variable.
