   List of things named after Leonhard Euler      List of things named after Leonhard Euler   In mathematics and physics , there are a large number of topics named in honor of Leonhard Euler , many of which include their own unique function, equation, formula, identity, number (single or sequence), or other mathematical entity. Many of these entities have been given simple and ambiguous names such as Euler's function , Euler's equation , and Euler's formula .  Euler's work touched upon so many fields that he is often the earliest written reference on a given matter. It has been said that, in an effort to avoid naming everything after Euler, discoveries and theorems are named after the first person after Euler to have discovered them. 1 2  Euler's conjectures   Euler's conjecture (Waring's problem)  Euler's sum of powers conjecture   (Also see Euler's conjecture .)
