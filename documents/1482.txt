   Harish-Chandra transform      Harish-Chandra transform   In mathematical representation theory , the Harish-Chandra transform is a linear map from functions on a reductive Lie group to functions on a parabolic subgroup . It was introduced by .  The Harish-Chandra transform f P of a function f on the group G is given by        f  P    (  m  )    =    a   -  ρ      ∫  N    f   (   n  m   )   d  n            superscript  f  P   m      superscript  a    ρ      subscript   N     f    n  m   d  n       f^{P}(m)=a^{-\rho}\int_{N}f(nm)\;dn     where P = MAN is the Langlands decomposition of a parabolic subgroup.
