   Luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase      Luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase   In enzymology , a luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucuronate + luteolin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucuronate and luteolin , whereas its two products are UDP and luteolin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucuronate:luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucuronate-luteolin 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase , and LGT .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
