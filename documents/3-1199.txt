   Geodesic curvature      Geodesic curvature  In [[Riemannian geometry]], the '''geodesic curvature''' k_g of a curve \gamma measures how far the curve is from being a [[geodesic]]. In a given manifold \bar{M} , the '''geodesic curvature''' is just the usual '''curvature''' of \gamma (see below), but when \gamma is restricte d to lie on a submanifold   M   M   M   of    M  ¯     normal-¯  M    \bar{M}   (e.g. for curves on surfaces ), geodesic curvature refers to the curvature of   γ   γ   \gamma   in   M   M   M   and it is different in general from the curvature of   γ   γ   \gamma   in the ambient manifold    M  ¯     normal-¯  M    \bar{M}   . The (ambient) curvature   k   k   k   of   γ   γ   \gamma   depends on two factors: the curvature of the submanifold   M   M   M   in the direction of   γ   γ   \gamma   (the normal curvature     k  n     subscript  k  n    k_{n}   ), which depends only from the direction of the curve, and the curvature of   γ   γ   \gamma   seen in   M   M   M   (the geodesic curvature    k  g     subscript  k  g    k_{g}   ), which is a second order quantity. The relation between these is    k  =     k  g  2   +   k  n  2         k       superscript   subscript  k  g   2    superscript   subscript  k  n   2       k=\sqrt{k_{g}^{2}+k_{n}^{2}}   . In particular geodesics on   M   M   M   have zero geodesic curvature (they are "straight"), so that    k  =   k  n       k   subscript  k  n     k=k_{n}   , which explains why they appear to be curved in ambient space whenever the submanifold is.  Definition  Consider a curve   γ   γ   \gamma   in a manifold    M  ¯     normal-¯  M    \bar{M}   , parametrized by arclength , with unit tangent vector    T  =     d  γ   /  d   s       T        d  γ   d   s     T=d\gamma/ds   . Its curvature is the norm of the covariant derivative of   T   T   T       k  =   ∥     D  T   /  d   s   ∥       k   norm        D  T   d   s      k=\|DT/ds\|   . If   γ   γ   \gamma   lies on   M   M   M   , the geodesic curvature is the norm of the projection of the covariant derivative      D  T   /  d   s          D  T   d   s    DT/ds   on the tangent space to the submanifold. Conversely the normal curvature is the norm of the projection of      D  T   /  d   s          D  T   d   s    DT/ds   on the normal bundle to the submanifold at the point considered.  If the ambient manifold is the euclidean space    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , then the covariant derivative      D  T   /  d   s          D  T   d   s    DT/ds   is just the usual derivative      d  T   /  d   s          d  T   d   s    dT/ds   .  Example  Let   M   M   M   be the unit sphere    S  2     superscript  S  2    S^{2}   in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The normal curvature of    S  2     superscript  S  2    S^{2}   is identically 1, independently of the direction considered. Great circles have curvature    k  =  1      k  1    k=1   , so they have zero geodesic curvature, and are therefore geodesics. Smaller circles of radius   r   r   r   will have curvature    1  /  r      1  r    1/r   and geodesic curvature     k  g   =     1  -   r  2     /  r        subscript  k  g         1   superscript  r  2     r     k_{g}=\sqrt{1-r^{2}}/r   .  Some results involving geodesic curvature   The geodesic curvature is none other than the usual curvature of the curve when computed intrinsically in the submanifold   M   M   M   . It does not depend on the way the submanifold   M   M   M   sits in    M  ¯     normal-¯  M    \bar{M}   .    Geodesics of   M   M   M   have zero geodesic curvature, which is equivalent to saying that      D  T   /  d   s          D  T   d   s    DT/ds   is orthogonal to the tangent space to   M   M   M   .    On the other hand the normal curvature depends strongly on how the submanifold lies in the ambient space, but marginally on the curve    k  n     subscript  k  n    k_{n}   only depends on the point on the submanifold and the direction   T   T   T   , but not on      D  T   /  d   s          D  T   d   s    DT/ds   .    In general Riemannian geometry, the derivative is computed using the Levi-Civita connection     ∇  ¯     normal-¯  normal-∇    \bar{\nabla}   of the ambient manifold       D  T   /  d   s   =     ∇  ¯   T   T             D  T   d   s      subscript   normal-¯  normal-∇   T   T     DT/ds=\bar{\nabla}_{T}T   . It splits into a tangent part and a normal part to the submanifold       ∇  ¯   T   T   =     ∇  T   T   +    (     ∇  ¯   T   T   )   ⟂           subscript   normal-¯  normal-∇   T   T       subscript  normal-∇  T   T    superscript     subscript   normal-¯  normal-∇   T   T   perpendicular-to      \bar{\nabla}_{T}T=\nabla_{T}T+(\bar{\nabla}_{T}T)^{\perp}   . The tangent part is the usual derivative     ∇  T   T      subscript  normal-∇  T   T    \nabla_{T}T   in   M   M   M   (it is a particular case of Gauss equation in the Gauss-Codazzi equations ), while the normal part is     I   I   (  T  ,  T  )       normal-I  normal-I   T  T     \mathrm{I\!I}(T,T)   , where     I   I      normal-I  normal-I    \mathrm{I\!I}   denotes the second fundamental form .
