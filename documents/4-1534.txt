   Imperiali quota      Imperiali quota   The Imperiali quota is a formula used to calculate the minimum number, or quota , of votes required to capture a seat in some forms of single transferable vote or largest remainder method  party-list proportional representation  voting systems . It is distinct from the Imperiali method , a type of highest average method . It is named after Belgian senator Pierre Imperiali .  Ecuador is among the few countries that uses this allocation system, while Italy used it for its Chamber of Deputies from 1946 to 1993. Belgium uses this system for the municipal elections. 1  If a large number of party lists poll just over the Imperiali quota, it is possible for this method to distribute more seats than there are vacancies to fill (this is not possible with the Hare or Droop quotas). If this occurs, the result needs to be recalculated with a higher quota (usually the Droop quota). If it does not happen, Imperiali usually distributes seats in a similar fashion to the d'Hondt method —i.e., favouring larger parties.  Formula  The Imperiali quota may be given as:        total   votes      total   seats   +  2         total  votes       total  seats   2     \frac{\mbox{total}\;\mbox{votes}}{\mbox{total}\;\mbox{seats}+2}      Total votes = the total valid poll; that is, the number of valid (unspoilt) votes cast in an election.  Total seats = the total number of seats to be filled in the election.   An example of use in STV  To see how the Imperiali quota works in an STV election imagine an election in which there are 2 seats to be filled and 3 candidates: Andrea, Carter and Brad. There are 100 voters as follows:      65 voters   Andrea  Carter    15 voters   Carter    20 voters   Brad      There are 100 voters and 2 seats. The Imperiali quota is therefore:       100   2  +  2    =  25        100    2  2    25    \frac{100}{2+2}=25     To begin the count the first preferences cast for each candidate are tallied and are as follows:   Andrea: 65  Carter: 15  Brad: 20   Andrea has more than 25 votes. She therefore has reached the quota and is declared elected. She has 40 votes more than the quota so these votes are transferred to Carter, as specified on the ballots. The tallies therefore become:   Carter: 55  Brad: 20   Carter has now reached the quota so he is declared elected. The winners are therefore Andrea and Carter.
