It is named by its construction as an alteration of a hexagonal tiling honeycomb.
Symmetry constructions
 It has five alternated constructions from reflectional Coxeter groups all with four mirrors and only the first being regular:  [6,3,3],  [3,6,3],  [6,3,6],  [6,3[3]] and [3[3,3]] , having 1, 4, 6, 12 and 24 times larger fundamental domains respectively. In Coxeter notation subgroup markups, they are related as: [6,(3,3)*] (remove 3 mirrors, index 24 subgroup); [3,6,3*] or [3*,6,3] (remove 2 mirrors, index 6 subgroup); [1+,6,3,6,1+] (remove two orthogonal mirrors, index 4 subgroup); all of these are isomorphic to [3[3,3]]. The ringed Coxeter diagrams are , , ,  and , representing different types (colors) of hexagonal tilings in the Wythoff construction. {{-}}
