   Span (category theory)      Span (category theory)   In category theory , a span , roof or correspondence is a generalization of the notion of relation between two objects of a category. When the category has all pullbacks (and satisfies a small number of other conditions), spans can be considered as morphisms in a category of fractions .  Formal definition  A span is a diagram of type    Λ  =   (  -  1  ←  0  →  +  1  )   ,     fragments  Λ    fragments  normal-(   1  normal-←  0  normal-→   1  normal-)   normal-,    \Lambda=(-1\leftarrow 0\rightarrow+1),   i.e., a diagram of the form    Y  ←  X  →  Z       normal-←  Y  X    normal-→    Z     Y\leftarrow X\rightarrow Z   .  That is, let Λ be the category (-1 ← 0 → +1). Then a span in a category C is a functor S:Λ → C. This means that a span consists of three objects X, Y and Z of C and morphisms f:X → Y and g:X → Z: it is two maps with common domain .  The colimit of a span is a pushout .  Examples   If R is a relation between sets X and Y (i.e. a subset of X × Y ), then X ← R → Y is a span, where the maps are the projection maps     X  ×  Y    →   π  X    X        X  Y     subscript  π  X   normal-→   X    X\times Y\overset{\pi_{X}}{\to}X   and     X  ×  Y    →   π  Y    Y        X  Y     subscript  π  Y   normal-→   Y    X\times Y\overset{\pi_{Y}}{\to}Y   .  Any object yields the trivial span     A  =  A  =  A   ;        A  A       A     A=A=A;   formally, the diagram A ← A → A, where the maps are the identity.  More generally, let    ϕ  :   A  →  B      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  A  B     \phi\colon A\to B   be a morphism in some category. There is a trivial span A = A → B; formally, the diagram A ← A → B , where the left map is the identity on A, and the right map is the given map φ.  If M is a model category , with W the set of weak equivalences , then the spans of the form     X  ←  Y  →  Z   ,       normal-←  X  Y    normal-→    Z     X\leftarrow Y\rightarrow Z,   where the left morphism is in W, can be considered a generalised morphism (i.e., where one "inverts the weak equivalences"). Note that this is not the usual point of view taken when dealing with model categories.   Cospans  A cospan K in a category C is a functor K:Λ op → C; equivalently, a contravariant functor from Λ to C. That is, a diagram of type     Λ  op   =   (  -  1  →  0  ←  +  1  )   ,     fragments   superscript  normal-Λ  op     fragments  normal-(   1  normal-→  0  normal-←   1  normal-)   normal-,    \Lambda^{\text{op}}=(-1\rightarrow 0\leftarrow+1),   i.e., a diagram of the form    Y  →  X  ←  Z       normal-→  Y  X    normal-←    Z     Y\rightarrow X\leftarrow Z   .  Thus it consists of three objects X, Y and Z of C and morphisms f:Y → X and g:Z → X: it is two maps with common codomain.  The limit of a cospan is a pullback .  An example of a cospan is a cobordism  W between two manifolds M and N , where the two maps are the inclusions into W . Note that while cobordisms are cospans, the category of cobordisms is not a "cospan category": it is not the category of all cospans in "the category of manifolds with inclusions on the boundary", but rather a subcategory thereof, as the requirement that M and N form a partition of the boundary of W is a global constraint.  The category nCob of finite-dimensional cobordisms is a dagger compact category . More generally, the category Span ( C ) of spans on any category C with finite limits is also dagger compact.
