   Free carrier absorption      Free carrier absorption   Free carrier absorption occurs when a material absorbs a photon, and a carrier (electron or hole) is excited from an already-excited state to another, unoccupied state in the same band (but possibly a different subband). This is different from interband absorption because the excited carrier is already in an exited band, such as electrons in the conduction band or holes in the valence band, where it is free to move. In interband absorption, the carrier would start in a fixed, nonconducting band and be excited to a conducting one.  It is well known that the optical transition of electrons and holes in the solid state is a useful clue to understand the physical properties of the material. However, the dynamics of the carrier are affected by other carriers and not only by the periodic lattice potential. Moreover, the thermal fluctuation of each electron should be taken into account. Therefore a statistical approach is needed. To predict the optical transition in an appropriate precision, one should choose an approximation, called assumption of quasi-thermal distributions, of the electrons in the conduction band and of the holes in the valence band. In this case, the diagonal components of the density matrix become negligible after introducing the thermal distribution function,       ρ   λ  λ   0   =   1    e    (    ε   λ  ,  k    -  μ   )   β    +  1    =   f   λ  ,  k           superscript   subscript  ρ    λ  λ    0     1     superscript  e       subscript  ε   λ  k    μ   β    1          subscript  f   λ  k       \rho_{\lambda\lambda}^{0}=\frac{1}{{e^{(\varepsilon_{\lambda,k}-\mu)\beta}+1}}%

Thus, summing over all possible states (l and k) yields the total number of carriers N .

Therefore, in order to obtain the absorption coefficient that is crucial quantity for investigation of electronic structure, we can use the optical susceptibility.       α   (  ω  )    =     4  π  ω     n  b   c     χ  ′′    (  ω  )          α  ω         4  π  ω      subscript  n  b   c     superscript  χ  ′′   ω     \alpha(\omega)=\frac{{4\pi\omega}}{{n_{b}c}}\chi^{\prime\prime}(\omega)        =     4  π  ω     n  b   c      ∑  k      |   d   c  v    |   2    (    f   v  ,  k    -   f   c  ,  k     )   δ   (   ℏ   (     ε   v  ,  k    -   ε   c  ,  k     +  ω   )    )          absent        4  π  ω      subscript  n  b   c      subscript   k      superscript     subscript  d    c  v     2      subscript  f   v  k     subscript  f   c  k     δ    Planck-constant-over-2-pi       subscript  ε   v  k     subscript  ε   c  k     ω         {\rm{}}=\frac{{4\pi\omega}}{{n_{b}c}}\sum\limits_{k}{\left|{d_{cv}}\right|^{2}%
 (f_{v,k}-f_{c,k})\delta(\hbar(\varepsilon_{v,k}-\varepsilon_{c,k}+\omega))}     The energy of free carriers is proportional to the square of momentum (E~k2). Using the band gap energy E g and the electron-hole distribution function, we can obtain the absorption coefficient with some mathematical calculation.

It is worth noting that the absorption coefficient is negative when the material supports stimulated emission, which is the basis for the operation of lasers, particularly semiconductor laser .
