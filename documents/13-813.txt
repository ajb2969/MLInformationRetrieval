   Balaban 10-cage      Balaban 10-cage   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the Balaban 10-cage or Balaban (3,10)-cage is a 3- regular graph with 70 vertices and 105 edges named after A. T. Balaban . 1 Published in 1972, 2 It was the first (3,10)- cage discovered but is not unique. 3  The complete list of (3-10)-cage and the proof of minimality was given by O'Keefe and Wong. 4 There exists 3 distinct (3-10)-cages, the other two being the Harries graph and the Harries-Wong graph . 5 Moreover, the Harries-Wong graph and Harries graph are cospectral graphs .  The Balaban 10-cage has chromatic number 2, chromatic index 3, diameter 6, girth 10 and is hamiltonian. It is also a 3- vertex-connected graph and a 3- edge-connected graph .  The characteristic polynomial of the Balaban 10-cage is     (   x  -  3   )    (   x  -  2   )     (   x  -  1   )   8    x  2     (   x  +  1   )   8    (   x  +  2   )    (   x  +  3   )     (    x  2   -  6   )   2     (    x  2   -  5   )   4     (    x  2   -  2   )   2     (     x  4   -   6   x  2     +  3   )   8         x  3     x  2    superscript    x  1   8    superscript  x  2    superscript    x  1   8     x  2     x  3    superscript     superscript  x  2   6   2    superscript     superscript  x  2   5   4    superscript     superscript  x  2   2   2    superscript       superscript  x  4     6   superscript  x  2     3   8     (x-3)(x-2)(x-1)^{8}x^{2}(x+1)^{8}(x+2)(x+3)(x^{2}-6)^{2}(x^{2}-5)^{4}(x^{2}-2)%
