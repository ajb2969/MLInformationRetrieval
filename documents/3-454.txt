   Grassmannian      Grassmannian   In mathematics , the Grassmannian     𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   r  V     \mathbf{Gr}(r,V)   is a space which parameterizes all linear subspaces of a vector space    V   V   V   of given dimension    r   r   r   . For example, the Grassmannian    𝐆𝐫   (  1  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   1  V     \mathbf{Gr}(1,V)   is the space of lines through the origin in   V   V   V   , so it is the same as the projective space of one dimension lower than   V   V   V   .  When   V   V   V   is a real or complex vector space, Grassmannians are compact  smooth manifolds . 1 In general they have the structure of a smooth algebraic variety .  The earliest work on a non-trivial Grassmannian is due to Julius Plücker , who studied the set of lines in projective 3-space and parameterized them by what are now called Plücker coordinates . Grassmannians are named after Hermann Grassmann , who introduced the concept in general.  Notations vary between authors, with    𝐆𝐫   (  V  ,  r  )       𝐆𝐫   V  r     \mathbf{Gr}(V,r)   being equivalent to    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   r  V     \mathbf{Gr}(r,V)   , and with some authors using    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   or    𝐆𝐫   (  n  ,  r  )       𝐆𝐫   n  r     \mathbf{Gr}(n,r)   to denote the Grassmannian of   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of an unspecified   n   n   n   -dimensional vector space.  Motivation  By giving a collection of subspaces of some vector space a topological structure, it is possible to talk about a continuous choice of subspace or open and closed collections of subspaces; by giving them the structure of a differential manifold one can talk about smooth choices of subspace.  A natural example comes from tangent bundles of smooth manifolds embedded in Euclidean space . Suppose we have a manifold   M   M   M   of dimension   r   r   r   embedded in . At each point   x   x   x   in   M   M   M   , the tangent space to   M   M   M   can be considered as a subspace of the tangent space of , which is just . The map assigning to   x   x   x   its tangent space defines a map from   M   M   M   to    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   . (In order to do this, we have to translate the geometrical tangent space to   M   M   M   so that it passes through the origin rather than   x   x   x   , and hence defines a   r   r   r   -dimensional vector subspace. This idea is very similar to the Gauss map for surfaces in a 3-dimensional space.)  This idea can with some effort be extended to all vector bundles over a manifold   M   M   M   , so that every vector bundle generates a continuous map from   M   M   M   to a suitably generalised Grassmannian—although various embedding theorems must be proved to show this. We then find that the properties of our vector bundles are related to the properties of the corresponding maps viewed as continuous maps. In particular we find that vector bundles inducing homotopic maps to the Grassmannian are isomorphic. But the definition of homotopic relies on a notion of continuity, and hence a topology.  Low dimensions  For    r  =  1      r  1    r=1   , The Grassmannian    𝐆𝐫   (  1  ,  3  )       𝐆𝐫   1  3     \mathbf{Gr}(1,3)   is the space of lines through the origin in 3-space, so it is the same as the projective plane .  For    r  =  2      r  2    r=2   , the Grassmannian is the space of all planes through the origin. In Euclidean 3-space, a plane containing the origin is completely characterized by the one and only line through the origin perpendicular to that plane (and vice versa); hence , the projective plane .  The simplest Grassmannian that is not a projective space is    𝐆𝐫   (  2  ,  4  )       𝐆𝐫   2  4     \mathbf{Gr}(2,4)   , which may be parameterized via Plücker coordinates .  The Grassmannian as a set  Let   V   V   V   be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field    k   k   k   . The Grassmannian    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   r  V     \mathbf{Gr}(r,V)   is the set of all   r   r   r   -dimensional linear subspaces of   V   V   V   . If   V   V   V   has dimension   n   n   n   , then the Grassmannian is also denoted    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   .  Vector subspaces of   V   V   V   are equivalent to linear subspaces of the projective space    𝐏   (  V  )       𝐏  V    \mathbf{P}(V)   , so it is equivalent to think of the Grassmannian as the set of all linear subspaces of    𝐏   (  V  )       𝐏  V    \mathbf{P}(V)   . When the Grassmannian is thought of this way, it is often written as    𝐆𝐫   (   r  −  1   ,   𝐏   (  V  )    )       𝐆𝐫     r  normal-−  1     𝐏  V      \mathbf{Gr}(r−1,\mathbf{P}(V))   or    𝐆𝐫   (   r  −  1   ,   n  −  1   )       𝐆𝐫     r  normal-−  1     n  normal-−  1      \mathbf{Gr}(r−1,n−1)   .  The Grassmannian as a homogeneous space  The quickest way of giving the Grassmannian a geometric structure is to express it as a homogeneous space . First, recall that the general linear group     G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)    acts  transitively on the   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of   V   V   V   . Therefore, if   H   H   H   is the set of stabilizers of this action, we have        𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )    =    G  L   (  V  )    /  H         𝐆𝐫   r  V        G  L  V   H     \mathbf{Gr}(r,V)=GL(V)/H   .   If the underlying field is   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   or   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   and    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   is considered as a Lie group , then this construction makes the Grassmannian into a smooth manifold . It also becomes possible to use other groups to make this construction. To do this, fix an inner product on   V   V   V   . Over   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   , one replaces    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   by the orthogonal group     O   (  V  )       O  V    O(V)   , and by restricting to orthonormal frames, one gets the identity        𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )    =    O   (  n  )    /   (   O   (  r  )   ×  O   (   n  –  r   )    )          𝐆𝐫   r  n        O  n     O  r  normal-×  O    n  normal-–  r       \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)=O(n)/(O(r)×O(n–r))   .   In particular, the dimension of the Grassmannian is    r   (   n  –  r   )       r    n  normal-–  r     r(n–r)   .  Over   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   , one replaces    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   by the unitary group     U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   . This shows that the Grassmannian is compact . These constructions also make the Grassmannian into a metric space : For a subspace   W   W   W   of   V   V   V   , let be the projection of   V   V   V   onto   W   W   W   . Then        d   (  W  ,   W  ′   )    =   ∥    P  W   -   P   W  ′     ∥    ,        d   W   superscript  W  normal-′      norm     subscript  P  W    subscript  P   superscript  W  normal-′        d(W,W^{\prime})=\lVert P_{W}-P_{W^{\prime}}\rVert,     where    !  !  ⋅  !  !     fragments    ⋅      {{!!}}⋅{{!!}}   denotes the operator norm , is a metric on    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   r  V     \mathbf{Gr}(r,V)   . The exact inner product used does not matter, because a different inner product will give an equivalent norm on   V   V   V   , and so give an equivalent metric.  If the ground field    k   k   k   is arbitrary and    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   is considered as an algebraic group, then this construction shows that the Grassmannian is a non-singular  algebraic variety . It follows from the existence of the Plücker embedding that the Grassmannian is complete as an algebraic variety. In particular,   H   H   H   is a parabolic subgroup of    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   .  The Grassmannian as a scheme  In the realm of algebraic geometry , the Grassmannian can be constructed as a scheme by expressing it as a representable functor . 2  Representable functor  Let   ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   be a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme   S   S   S   . Fix a positive integer   r   r   r   . Then to each   S   S   S   -scheme   T   T   T   , the Grassmannian functor associates the set of quotient modules of       ℰ  T   :=   ℰ   ⊗   O  S     O  T       assign   subscript  ℰ  T     subscript  tensor-product   subscript  O  S    ℰ   subscript  O  T      \mathcal{E}_{T}:=\mathcal{E}\otimes_{O_{S}}O_{T}     locally free of rank   r   r   r   on   T   T   T   . We denote this set by    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,   ℰ  T   )       𝐆𝐫   r   subscript  ℰ  T      \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E}_{T})   .  This functor is representable by a separated   S   S   S   -scheme    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )       𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ     \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})   . The latter is projective if   ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   is finitely generated. When   S   S   S   is the spectrum of a field   k   k   k   , then the sheaf   ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   is given by a vector space   V   V   V   and we recover the usual Grassmannian variety of the dual space of   V   V   V   , namely: .  By construction, the Grassmannian scheme is compatible with base changes: for any   S   S   S   -scheme    S  ′      S  normal-′    S′   , we have a canonical isomorphism        𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )     ×  S    S  ′    ≃   𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,   ℰ   S  ′    )       similar-to-or-equals    subscript   S     𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ     superscript  S  normal-′      𝐆𝐫   r   subscript  ℰ   superscript  S  normal-′        \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})\times_{S}S^{\prime}\simeq\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E}_%
 {S^{\prime}})     In particular, for any point   s   s   s   of   S   S   S   , the canonical morphism , induces an isomorphism from the fiber    𝐆𝐫    (  r  ,  ℰ  )   s       𝐆𝐫   subscript   r  ℰ   s     \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})_{s}   to the usual Grassmannian    G  r   (  r  ,    ℰ   ⊗   O  S    k    (  s  )    )       G  r   r      subscript  tensor-product   subscript  O  S    ℰ  k   s      {Gr}(r,\mathcal{E}\otimes_{O_{S}}k(s))   over the residue field    k   (  s  )       k  s    k(s)   .  Universal family  Since the Grassmannian scheme represents a functor, it comes with a universal object,   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}   , which is an object of       𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,   ℰ   𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )     )    ,      𝐆𝐫   r   subscript  ℰ    𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ        \mathbf{Gr}\left(r,\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})}\right),     and therefore a quotient module   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}   of    ℰ   𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )       subscript  ℰ    𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ      \mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})}   , locally free of rank   r   r   r   over    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )       𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ     \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})   . The quotient homomorphism induces a closed immersion from the projective bundle    𝐏   (  𝒢  )       𝐏  𝒢    \mathbf{P}(\mathcal{G})   :        𝐏   (  𝒢  )    →   𝐏   (   ℰ   𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )     )    =     𝐏   (  ℰ  )     ×  S   𝐆𝐫    (  r  ,  ℰ  )     .       normal-→    𝐏  𝒢     𝐏   subscript  ℰ    𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ               subscript   S     𝐏  ℰ   𝐆𝐫    r  ℰ       \mathbf{P}(\mathcal{G})\to\mathbf{P}\left(\mathcal{E}_{\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{%
 E})}\right)=\mathbf{P}({\mathcal{E}})\times_{S}\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E}).     For any morphism of   S   S   S   -schemes:       T  →   𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )     ,     normal-→  T    𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ      T\to\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E}),     this closed immersion induces a closed immersion        𝐏   (   𝒢  T   )    →    𝐏   (  ℰ  )     ×  S   T    .     normal-→    𝐏   subscript  𝒢  T      subscript   S     𝐏  ℰ   T     \mathbf{P}(\mathcal{G}_{T})\to\mathbf{P}(\mathcal{E})\times_{S}T.     Conversely, any such closed immersion comes from a surjective homomorphism of -modules from    ℰ  T     subscript  ℰ  T    \mathcal{E}_{T}   to a locally free module of rank   r   r   r   . 3 Therefore, the elements of    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )    (  T  )       𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ   T    \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})(T)   are exactly the projective subbundles of rank   r   r   r   in        𝐏   (  ℰ  )     ×  S   T   .      subscript   S     𝐏  ℰ   T    \mathbf{P}(\mathcal{E})\times_{S}T.     Under this identification, when    T  =  S      T  S    T=S   is the spectrum of a field   k   k   k   and   ℰ   ℰ   \mathcal{E}   is given by a vector space   V   V   V   , the set of rational points    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  ℰ  )    (  k  )       𝐆𝐫   r  ℰ   k    \mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})(k)   correspond to the projective linear subspaces of dimension    r  −  1      r  normal-−  1    r−1   in    𝐏   (  V  )       𝐏  V    \mathbf{P}(V)   , and the image of    𝐏   (  𝒢  )    (  k  )       𝐏  𝒢  k    \mathbf{P}(\mathcal{G})(k)   in        𝐏   (  V  )     ×  k   𝐆𝐫    (  r  ,  ℰ  )         subscript   k     𝐏  V   𝐆𝐫    r  ℰ     \mathbf{P}(V)\times_{k}\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})     is the set       {    (  x  ,  v  )   ∈     𝐏   (  V  )    (  k  )    ×  𝐆𝐫    (  r  ,  ℰ  )    (  k  )     ∣   x  ∈  v   }   .     conditional-set     x  v         𝐏  V  k   𝐆𝐫    r  ℰ   k      x  v     \{(x,v)\in\mathbf{P}(V)(k)\times\mathbf{Gr}(r,\mathcal{E})(k)\mid x\in v\}.     The Plücker embedding  The Plücker embedding is a natural embedding of a Grassmannian into a projective space:       ψ  :    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )    →   𝐏   (    ∧  r   V   )      .     normal-:  ψ   normal-→    𝐆𝐫   r  V      𝐏    superscript   r   V       \psi:\mathbf{Gr}(r,V)\to\mathbf{P}\left(\wedge^{r}V\right).     Suppose that   W   W   W   is an   r   r   r   -dimensional subspace of   V   V   V   . To define    ψ   (  W  )       ψ  W    ψ(W)   , choose a basis  of   W   W   W   , and let    ψ   (  W  )       ψ  W    ψ(W)   be the wedge product of these basis elements:        ψ   (  W  )    =    w  1   ∧  ⋯  ∧   w  r     .        ψ  W      subscript  w  1   normal-⋯   subscript  w  r      \psi(W)=w_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge w_{r}.     A different basis for   W   W   W   will give a different wedge product, but the two products will differ only by a non-zero scalar (the determinant of the change of basis matrix). Since the right-hand side takes values in a projective space,   ψ   ψ   ψ   is well-defined. To see that   ψ   ψ   ψ   is an embedding, notice that it is possible to recover   W   W   W   from    ψ   (  W  )       ψ  W    ψ(W)   as the set of all vectors   w   w   w   such that     w  ∧  ψ   (  W  )    =  0        w  normal-∧  ψ  W   0    w∧ψ(W)=0   .  The embedding of the Grassmannian satisfies some very simple quadratic polynomials called the Plücker relations . These show that the Grassmannian embeds as an algebraic subvariety of and give another method of constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Plücker relations, choose two   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces   W   W   W   and   Z   Z   Z   of   V   V   V   with bases  and  respectively. Then, for any integer    k  ≥  0      k  normal-≥  0    k≥0   , the following equation is true in the homogeneous coordinate ring of :          ψ   (  W  )    ⋅  ψ    (  Z  )    -    ∑    i  1   <  ⋯  <   i  k       (    v  1   ∧  ⋯  ∧   v    i  1   -  1    ∧   w  1   ∧   v    i  1   +  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   v    i  k   -  1    ∧   w  k   ∧   v    i  k   +  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   v  r    )   ⋅   (    v   i  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   v   i  k    ∧    w   k  +  1    ⋯   ∧   w  r    )      =  0.           normal-⋅    ψ  W   ψ   Z     subscript        subscript  i  1   normal-⋯        subscript  i  k       normal-⋅     subscript  v  1   normal-⋯   subscript  v     subscript  i  1   1     subscript  w  1    subscript  v     subscript  i  1   1    normal-⋯   subscript  v     subscript  i  k   1     subscript  w  k    subscript  v     subscript  i  k   1    normal-⋯   subscript  v  r       subscript  v   subscript  i  1    normal-⋯   subscript  v   subscript  i  k       subscript  w    k  1    normal-⋯    subscript  w  r       0.    \psi(W)\cdot\psi(Z)-\sum_{i_{1}<\cdots     When     d  i  m   (  V  )    =  4        d  i  m  V   4    dim(V)=4   , and    r  =  2      r  2    r=2   , the simplest Grassmannian which is not a projective space, the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the coordinates of by , we have that    𝐆𝐫   (  2  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   2  V     \mathbf{Gr}(2,V)   is defined by the equation   0.}}    In general, however, many more equations are needed to define the Plücker embedding of a Grassmannian in projective space.  The Grassmannian as a real affine algebraic variety  Let denote the Grassmannian of   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of . Let    M   (  n  ,  𝐑  )       M   n  𝐑     M(n,\mathbf{R})   denote the space of real    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   matrices. Consider the set of matrices    A   (  r  ,  n  )   ⊂  M   (  n  ,  𝐑  )       A   r  n   normal-⊂  M   n  𝐑     A(r,n)⊂M(n,\mathbf{R})   defined by    X  ∈  A   (  r  ,  n  )       X  normal-∈  A   r  n     X∈A(r,n)   if and only if the three conditions are satisfied:      X   X   X   is a projection operator:  X }} .     X   X   X   is symmetric:  X }} .     X   X   X   has trace   r   r   r   :     t  r   (  X  )    =  r        t  r  X   r    tr(X)=r   .       A   (  r  ,  n  )       A   r  n     A(r,n)   and are homeomorphic, with a correspondence established by sending    X  ∈  A   (  r  ,  n  )       X  normal-∈  A   r  n     X∈A(r,n)   to the column space of   X   X   X   .  Duality  Every   r   r   r   -dimensional subspace   W   W   W   of   V   V   V   determines an    (   n  –  r   )      n  normal-–  r    (n–r)   -dimensional quotient space    V  /  W      V  W    V/W   of   V   V   V   . This gives the natural short exact sequence :         0  →  W  →  V  →  V   /  W   →  0          0  normal-→  W  normal-→  V  normal-→  V   W   normal-→  0    0→W→V→V/W→0   .   Taking the dual to each of these three spaces and linear transformations yields an inclusion of in with quotient :   .   Using the natural isomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space with its double dual shows that taking the dual again recovers the original short exact sequence. Consequently there is a one-to-one correspondence between   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of   V   V   V   and    (   n  –  r   )      n  normal-–  r    (n–r)   -dimensional subspaces of . In terms of the Grassmannian, this is a canonical isomorphism   .   Choosing an isomorphism of   V   V   V   with therefore determines a (non-canonical) isomorphism of    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫   r  V     \mathbf{Gr}(r,V)   and    𝐆𝐫   (   n  −  r   ,  V  )       𝐆𝐫     n  normal-−  r   V     \mathbf{Gr}(n−r,V)   . An isomorphism of   V   V   V   with is equivalent to a choice of an inner product , and with respect to the chosen inner product, this isomorphism of Grassmannians sends an   r   r   r   -dimensional subspace into its    (   n  –  r   )      n  normal-–  r    (n–r)   -dimensional orthogonal complement .  Schubert cells  The detailed study of the Grassmannians uses a decomposition into subsets called Schubert cells , which were first applied in enumerative geometry . The Schubert cells for    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   are defined in terms of an auxiliary flag : take subspaces , with . Then we consider the corresponding subset of    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   , consisting of the   W   W   W   having intersection with of dimension at least   i   i   i   , for    i  =   1  ,  …  ,  r       i   1  normal-…  r     i=1,...,r   . The manipulation of Schubert cells is Schubert calculus .  Here is an example of the technique. Consider the problem of determining the Euler characteristic of the Grassmannian of   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of . Fix a   1   1   1   -dimensional subspace and consider the partition of    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   into those   r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of that contain   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   and those that do not. The former is    𝐆𝐫   (   r  −  1   ,   n  −  1   )       𝐆𝐫     r  normal-−  1     n  normal-−  1      \mathbf{Gr}(r−1,n−1)   and the latter is a   r   r   r   -dimensional vector bundle over    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,   n  −  1   )       𝐆𝐫   r    n  normal-−  1      \mathbf{Gr}(r,n−1)   . This gives recursive formulas:        χ   r  ,  n    =    χ    r  -  1   ,   n  -  1     +     (   -  1   )   r    χ   r  ,   n  -  1        ,    χ   0  ,  n    =   χ   n  ,  n    =  1.      formulae-sequence     subscript  χ   r  n       subscript  χ     r  1     n  1        superscript    1   r    subscript  χ   r    n  1             subscript  χ   0  n     subscript  χ   n  n         1.      \chi_{r,n}=\chi_{r-1,n-1}+(-1)^{r}\chi_{r,n-1},\qquad\chi_{0,n}=\chi_{n,n}=1.     If one solves this recurrence relation, one gets the formula: 0}} if and only if   n   n   n   is even and   r   r   r   is odd. Otherwise:        χ   r  ,  n    =   (      ⌊    n  2    ⌋        ⌊    r  2    ⌋      )    .       subscript  χ   r  n     binomial      n  2        r  2       \chi_{r,n}={\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor\choose\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor}.     Cohomology ring of the complex Grassmannian  Every point in the complex Grassmannian manifold    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   defines an   r   r   r   -plane in   n   n   n   -space. Fibering these planes over the Grassmannian one arrives at the vector bundle    E   E   E   which generalizes the tautological bundle of a projective space . Similarly the    (   n  −  r   )      n  normal-−  r    (n−r)   -dimensional orthogonal complements of these planes yield an orthogonal vector bundle   F   F   F   . The integral cohomology of the Grassmannians is generated, as a ring , by the Chern classes of   E   E   E   . In particular, all of the integral cohomology is at even degree as in the case of a projective space.  These generators are subject to a set of relations, which defines the ring. The defining relations are easy to express for a larger set of generators, which consists of the Chern classes of   E   E   E   and   F   F   F   . Then the relations merely state that the direct sum of the bundles   E   E   E   and   F   F   F   is trivial. Functoriality of the total Chern classes allows one to write this relation as       c   (  E  )   c   (  F  )    =  1.        c  E  c  F   1.    c(E)c(F)=1.     The quantum cohomology ring was calculated by Edward Witten in The Verlinde Algebra And The Cohomology Of The Grassmannian . The generators are identical to those of the classical cohomology ring, but the top relation is changed to        c  k    (  E  )    c   n  -  k     (  F  )    =    (   -  1   )    n  -  r           subscript  c  k   E   subscript  c    n  k    F    superscript    1     n  r      c_{k}(E)c_{n-k}(F)=(-1)^{n-r}     reflecting the existence in the corresponding quantum field theory of an instanton with    2  n      2  n    2n   fermionic zero-modes which violates the degree of the cohomology corresponding to a state by    2  n      2  n    2n   units.  Associated measure  When   V   V   V   is   n   n   n   -dimensional Euclidean space, one may define a uniform measure on    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   in the following way. Let be the unit Haar measure on the orthogonal group     O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   and fix   V   V   V   in    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   . Then for a set    A  ⊆  𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       A  normal-⊆  𝐆𝐫   r  n     A⊆\mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   , define         γ   r  ,  n     (  A  )    =    θ  n    {   g  ∈   O   (  n  )     :    g  V   ∈  A   }     .         subscript  γ   r  n    A      subscript  θ  n    conditional-set    g    O  n        g  V   A       \gamma_{r,n}(A)=\theta_{n}\{g\in O(n):gV\in A\}.     This measure is invariant under actions from the group    O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   , that is,  γ r, n ( A )}} for all   g   g   g   in    O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   . Since 1}} , we have 1}} . Moreover, is a Radon measure with respect to the metric space topology and is uniform in the sense that every ball of the same radius (with respect to this metric) is of the same measure.  Oriented Grassmannian  This is the manifold consisting of all oriented    r   r   r   -dimensional subspaces of . It is a double cover of    𝐆𝐫   (  r  ,  n  )       𝐆𝐫   r  n     \mathbf{Gr}(r,n)   and is denoted by:        𝐆𝐫  ~    (  r  ,  n  )    .       normal-~  𝐆𝐫    r  n     \tilde{\mathbf{Gr}}(r,n).     As a homogeneous space can be expressed as:        S  O   (  n  )    /   (     S  O   (  r  )    ×  S   O   (   n  -  r   )    )    .        S  O  n         S  O  r   S   O    n  r      SO(n)/(SO(r)\times SO(n-r)).     Applications  Grassmann manifolds have found application in computer vision tasks of video-based face recognition and shape recognition. 4  Grassmannians allow the scattering amplitudes of subatomic particles to be calculated via a positive Grassmannian construct called the amplituhedron . 5  See also   For an example of use of Grassmannians in differential geometry , see Gauss map and in projective geometry , see Plücker co-ordinates .  Flag manifolds are generalizations of Grassmannians and Stiefel manifolds are closely related.  Given a distinguished class of subspaces, one can define Grassmannians of these subspaces, such as the Lagrangian Grassmannian .  Grassmannians provide classifying spaces in K-theory , notably the classifying space for U(n) . In the homotopy theory of schemes , the Grassmannian plays a similar rôle for algebraic K-theory . 6  Affine Grassmannian .
