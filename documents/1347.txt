   Fluid flow through porous media      Fluid flow through porous media   Introduction  Many day to day processes involve the movement of fluids across porous medium . For example sponge, drying of wood, filtration of water by using sand and/or other porous materials. As commonly observed, some fluid flows through the media while some mass of the fluid is stored in the pores present in the media. The knowledge of how the fluid diffuses through these materials and what are the factors upon which the diffusion depends is really useful for Engineering practices.  Governing Law  The basic law governing the flow of fluids through porous media is Darcy's Law , which was formulated by the French civil engineer Henry Darcy in 1856 on the basis of his experiments on vertical water filtration through sand beds. 1 According to which,      Q  =     -   κ  A    μ     (    p  b   -   p  a    )   L        Q          κ  A    μ        subscript  p  b    subscript  p  a    L      Q=\frac{-\kappa A}{\mu}\frac{(p_{b}-p_{a})}{L}   . Where,    Q   Q   Q   = Volumetric flow rate [m 3 /s]    κ   κ   \kappa   = Permeability of porous medium[m 2 ]. The permeability is a function of material type, and also varies with stress , temperature, etc.    μ   μ   \mu   = Fluid viscosity [Pa.s]    A   A   A   = Cross-sectional area of Porous medium[m 2 ]     (    p  b   -   p  a    )       subscript  p  b    subscript  p  a     (p_{b}-p_{a})   = Pressure drop across medium [Pa]    L   L   L   = Length of sample[m]  For transient processes in which the flux varies from point to-point, the following differential form of Darcy’s law is used.      Q  =     -   κ  A    μ    (    d  p    d  x    )        Q          κ  A    μ       d  p     d  x       Q=\frac{-\kappa A}{\mu}\left(\frac{dp}{dx}\right)    ,  Mass Conservation  Mass conservation of fluid across the porous medium involves the basic principle that,  Mass flux In - Mass flux Out = Increase in amount stored by medium . 2 Which means that total mass of the fluid is always conserved.  In mathematical form, considering a time period from   t   t   t   to    Δ  t      normal-Δ  t    \Delta t   ,length of porous medium from   x   x   x   to    Δ  x      normal-Δ  x    \Delta x   and   m   m   m   being the mass stored by the medium.

 \Delta t)-m(t).         m  =   ρ   V  p        m    ρ   subscript  V  p      m=\rho V_{p}   , where    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   is the pore volume of the medium between   x   x   x   and    x  +   Δ  x       x    normal-Δ  x     x+\Delta x   and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density. So,     m  =   ρ   V  p    =   ρ  ϕ  V   =   ρ  ϕ  A  Δ  x    .        m    ρ   subscript  V  p           ρ  ϕ  V          ρ  ϕ  A  normal-Δ  x      m=\rho V_{p}=\rho\phi V=\rho\phi A\Delta x.   Where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the number of pores in the medium.
