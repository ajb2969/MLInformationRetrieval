   Undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase      Undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase   Undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase (, PglB ) is an enzyme with system name tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide:protein-L-asparagine N-beta-D-oligosaccharidotransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl diphosphooligosaccharide + [protein]-L-asparagine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl diphosphate + a glycoprotein with the oligosaccharide chain attached by N-beta-D-glycosyl linkage to protein L- asparagine    This is a bacterial enzyme that is isolated from Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter lari .
