Undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase

Undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase (, PglB) is an enzyme with system name tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl-diphosphooligosaccharide:protein-L-asparagine N-beta-D-oligosaccharidotransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl diphosphooligosaccharide + [protein]-L-asparagine 
 
 
 
  tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl diphosphate + a glycoprotein with the oligosaccharide chain attached by N-beta-D-glycosyl linkage to protein L-asparagine


This is a bacterial enzyme that is isolated from Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter lari.
