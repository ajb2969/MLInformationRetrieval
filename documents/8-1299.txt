Hankinson's equation

Hankinson's equation (also called Hankinson's formula or Hankinson's criterion)1 is a mathematical relationship for predicting the off-axis uniaxial compressive strength of wood. The formula can also be used to compute the fiber stress or the stress wave velocity at the elastic limit as a function of grain angle in wood. For a wood that has uniaxial compressive strengths of 
 
 
 
  parallel to the grain and 
 
 
 
  perpendicular to the grain, Hankinson's equation predicts that the uniaxial compressive strength of the wood in a direction at an angle 
 
 
 
  to the grain is given by



Even though the original relation was based on studies of spruce, Hankinson's equation has been found to be remarkably accurate for many other types of wood. A generalized form of the Hankinson formula has also been used for predicting the uniaxial tensile strength of wood at an angle to the grain. This formula has the form2


 
  where the exponent 
 
 
 
  can take values between 1.5 and 2.
The stress wave velocity at angle 
 
 
 
  to the grain at the elastic limit can similarly be obtained from the Hankinson formula


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the velocity parallel to the grain, 
 
 
 
  is the velocity perpendicular to the grain and 
 
 
 
  is the grain angle.
