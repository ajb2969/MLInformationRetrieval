   Hankinson's equation      Hankinson's equation   Hankinson's equation (also called Hankinson's formula or Hankinson's criterion ) 1 is a mathematical relationship for predicting the off-axis uniaxial compressive strength of wood. The formula can also be used to compute the fiber stress or the stress wave velocity at the elastic limit as a function of grain angle in wood . For a wood that has uniaxial compressive strengths of    σ  0     subscript  σ  0    \sigma_{0}   parallel to the grain and    σ  90     subscript  σ  90    \sigma_{90}   perpendicular to the grain, Hankinson's equation predicts that the uniaxial compressive strength of the wood in a direction at an angle   α   α   \alpha   to the grain is given by       σ  α   =      σ  0     σ  90        σ  0      sin  2   α    +     σ  90      cos  2   α           subscript  σ  α    continued-fraction     subscript  σ  0    subscript  σ  90         subscript  σ  0     superscript   2   α       subscript  σ  90     superscript   2   α        \sigma_{\alpha}=\cfrac{\sigma_{0}~{}\sigma_{90}}{\sigma_{0}~{}\sin^{2}\alpha+%
 \sigma_{90}~{}\cos^{2}\alpha}     Even though the original relation was based on studies of spruce , Hankinson's equation has been found to be remarkably accurate for many other types of wood. A generalized form of the Hankinson formula has also been used for predicting the uniaxial tensile strength of wood at an angle to the grain. This formula has the form 2       σ  α   =      σ  0     σ  90        σ  0      sin  n   α    +     σ  90      cos  n   α           subscript  σ  α    continued-fraction     subscript  σ  0    subscript  σ  90         subscript  σ  0     superscript   n   α       subscript  σ  90     superscript   n   α        \sigma_{\alpha}=\cfrac{\sigma_{0}~{}\sigma_{90}}{\sigma_{0}~{}\sin^{n}\alpha+%
 \sigma_{90}~{}\cos^{n}\alpha}   where the exponent   n   n   n   can take values between 1.5 and 2.  The stress wave velocity at angle   α   α   \alpha   to the grain at the elastic limit can similarly be obtained from the Hankinson formula       V   (  α  )    =     V  0    V  90       V  0     sin  2   α    +    V  90     cos  2   α            V  α        subscript  V  0    subscript  V  90         subscript  V  0     superscript   2   α       subscript  V  90     superscript   2   α        V(\alpha)=\frac{V_{0}V_{90}}{V_{0}\sin^{2}\alpha+V_{90}\cos^{2}\alpha}   where    V  0     subscript  V  0    V_{0}   is the velocity parallel to the grain,    V  90     subscript  V  90    V_{90}   is the velocity perpendicular to the grain and   α   α   \alpha   is the grain angle.
