Schur's property

In mathematics, Schur's property, named after Issai Schur, is the property of normed spaces that is satisfied precisely if weak convergence of sequences entails convergence in norm.
Motivation
When we are working in a normed space X and we have a sequence 
 
 
 
  that converges weakly to 
 
 
 
  (see weak convergence), then a natural question arises. Does the sequence converge in perhaps a more desirable manner? That is, does the sequence converge to 
 
 
 
  in norm? A canonical example of this property, and commonly used to illustrate the Shur property, is the 
 
 
sequence space.
Definition
Suppose that we have a normed space (X, ||·||), 
 
 
 
  an arbitrary member of X, and 
 
 
 
  an arbitrary sequence in the space. We say that X has Schur's property if 
 
 
 
  converging weakly to 
 
 
 
  implies that 
 
 
 
 . In other words, the weak and strong topologies share the same convergent sequences. Note however that weak and strong topologies are always distinct in infinite-dimensional space.
Name
This property was named after the early 20th century mathematician Issai Schur who showed that ℓ1 had the above property in his 1921 paper.1
