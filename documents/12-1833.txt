   Schur's property      Schur's property   In mathematics , Schur's property , named after Issai Schur , is the property of normed spaces that is satisfied precisely if weak convergence of sequences entails convergence in norm.  Motivation  When we are working in a normed space X and we have a sequence    (   x  n   )     subscript  x  n    (x_{n})   that converges weakly to   x   x   x   (see weak convergence ), then a natural question arises. Does the sequence converge in perhaps a more desirable manner? That is, does the sequence converge to   x   x   x   in norm? A canonical example of this property, and commonly used to illustrate the Shur property, is the    ℓ  1     subscript  normal-ℓ  1    \ell_{1}    sequence space .  Definition  Suppose that we have a normed space ( X , ||·||),   x   x   x   an arbitrary member of X , and    (   x  n   )     subscript  x  n    (x_{n})   an arbitrary sequence in the space. We say that X has Schur's property if    (   x  n   )     subscript  x  n    (x_{n})   converging weakly to   x   x   x   implies that      lim   n  →  ∞     ∥    x  n   -  x   ∥    =  0        subscript    normal-→  n      norm     subscript  x  n   x     0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\|x_{n}-x\|=0   . In other words, the weak and strong topologies share the same convergent sequences. Note however that weak and strong topologies are always distinct in infinite-dimensional space.  Name  This property was named after the early 20th century mathematician Issai Schur who showed that ℓ 1 had the above property in his 1921 paper. 1  See also   Radon-Riesz property for a similar property of normed spaces  Schur's theorem   Notes    References     "  Category:Functional analysis     J.
