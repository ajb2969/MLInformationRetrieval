   Orientation of a vector bundle      Orientation of a vector bundle   In mathematics, an orientation of a real vector bundle is a generalization of an orientation of a vector space ; thus, given a real vector bundle π: E → B , an orientation of E means: for each fiber E x , there is an orientation of the vector space E x and one demands that each trivialization map (which is a bundle map)       ϕ  U   :     π   -  1     (  U  )    →   U  ×   𝐑  n        normal-:   subscript  ϕ  U    normal-→     superscript  π    1    U     U   superscript  𝐑  n       \phi_{U}:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\mathbf{R}^{n}   is fiberwise orientation-preserving, where R n is given the standard orientation. In more concise terms, this says that the structure group of the frame bundle of E , which is the real general linear group  GL n ( R ), can be reduced to the subgroup consisting of those with positive determinant.  A vector bundle together with an orientation is called an oriented bundle . Just as a real vector bundle is classified by the real infinite Grassmannian , oriented bundles are classified by the infinite Grassmannian of oriented real vector spaces.  The basic invariant of an oriented bundle is the Euler class . The multiplication (that is, cup product) by the Euler class of an oriented bundle gives rise to a Gysin sequence .  Thom space  From the cohomological point of view, for any ring Λ, a Λ-orientation of a real vector bundle E of rank n means a choice (and existence) of a class      u  ∈    H  n    (   T   (  E  )    ;  Λ  )        u     superscript  H  n      T  E   normal-Λ      u\in H^{n}(T(E);\Lambda)   in the cohomology ring of the Thom space  T ( E ) such that u generates      H  ~   *    (   T   (  E  )    ;  Λ  )        superscript   normal-~  H        T  E   normal-Λ     \tilde{H}^{*}(T(E);\Lambda)   as a free     H  *    (  E  ;  Λ  )        superscript  H     E  normal-Λ     H^{*}(E;\Lambda)   -module globally and locally: i.e.,         H  *    (  E  ;  Λ  )    →     H  ~   *    (   T   (  E  )    ;  Λ  )     ,   x  ↦   x  ∪  u       formulae-sequence   normal-→     superscript  H     E  normal-Λ       superscript   normal-~  H        T  E   normal-Λ      maps-to  x    x  u      H^{*}(E;\Lambda)\to\tilde{H}^{*}(T(E);\Lambda),x\mapsto x\cup u   is an isomorphism (called the Thom isomorphism ), where "tilde" means reduced cohomology , that restricts to each isomorphism        H  *    (    π   -  1     (  U  )    ;  Λ  )    →     H  ~   *    (   T   (    E  |   U   )    ;  Λ  )       normal-→     superscript  H        superscript  π    1    U   normal-Λ       superscript   normal-~  H        T   evaluated-at  E  U    normal-Λ      H^{*}(\pi^{-1}(U);\Lambda)\to\tilde{H}^{*}(T(E|_{U});\Lambda)   induced by the trivialization      π   -  1     (  U  )    ≃   U  ×   𝐑  n       similar-to-or-equals     superscript  π    1    U     U   superscript  𝐑  n      \pi^{-1}(U)\simeq U\times\mathbf{R}^{n}   . One can show, with some work, that the usual notion of an orientation coincides with a Z -orientation.  References   J.P. May, A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology.
