Orientation of a vector bundle




Orientation of a vector bundle

In mathematics, an orientation of a real vector bundle is a generalization of an orientation of a vector space; thus, given a real vector bundle π: E →B, an orientation of E means: for each fiber Ex, there is an orientation of the vector space Ex and one demands that each trivialization map (which is a bundle map)


 
  is fiberwise orientation-preserving, where Rn is given the standard orientation. In more concise terms, this says that the structure group of the frame bundle of E, which is the real general linear group GLn(R), can be reduced to the subgroup consisting of those with positive determinant.
A vector bundle together with an orientation is called an oriented bundle. Just as a real vector bundle is classified by the real infinite Grassmannian, oriented bundles are classified by the infinite Grassmannian of oriented real vector spaces.
The basic invariant of an oriented bundle is the Euler class. The multiplication (that is, cup product) by the Euler class of an oriented bundle gives rise to a Gysin sequence.
Thom space
From the cohomological point of view, for any ring Λ, a Λ-orientation of a real vector bundle E of rank n means a choice (and existence) of a class


 
  in the cohomology ring of the Thom space T(E) such that u generates 
 
 
 
  as a free 
 
 
 
 -module globally and locally: i.e.,


 
  is an isomorphism (called the Thom isomorphism), where "tilde" means reduced cohomology, that restricts to each isomorphism


 
  induced by the trivialization 
 
 
 
 . One can show, with some work, that the usual notion of an orientation coincides with a Z-orientation.
