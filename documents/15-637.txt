HBJ model

In Computer Science Helman-Bader-JaJa model 1 is a concise message passing model of parallel computation defined with the following parameters:



 
  is number of processors.


 
  is the problem size.


 
  is number of machine words in a packet sent over the network.


 
  is the latency, or time at which a processor takes to initiate a communication on a network.


 
  is the bandwidth, or time per machine word at which a processor can inject or receive 
 
 
 
  machine words from the network.


 
  is the largest computation time expended on a processor.


 
  is the time spent in communication on the network.

This model assumes that for any subset of 
 
 
 
  processors, a block permutation among the 
 
 
 
  processors takes 
 
 
 
  time, where 
 
 
 
  is the size of the largest block.
