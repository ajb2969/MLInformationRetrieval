   HBJ model      HBJ model   In Computer Science  Helman-Bader-JaJa model  1 is a concise message passing model of parallel computation defined with the following parameters:      p   p   p   is number of processors.     n   n   n   is the problem size.     m   m   m   is number of machine words in a packet sent over the network.     τ   τ   \tau   is the latency , or time at which a processor takes to initiate a communication on a network.     σ   σ   \sigma   is the bandwidth , or time per machine word at which a processor can inject or receive   m   m   m   machine words from the network.      T   c  o  m  p      subscript  T    c  o  m  p     T_{comp}   is the largest computation time expended on a processor.      T   c  o  m  m      subscript  T    c  o  m  m     T_{comm}   is the time spent in communication on the network.   This model assumes that for any subset of   q   q   q   processors, a block permutation among the   q   q   q   processors takes    (   τ  +   σ  m    )      τ    σ  m     (\tau+\sigma m)   time, where   m   m   m   is the size of the largest block.
