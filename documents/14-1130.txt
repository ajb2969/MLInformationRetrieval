Extranatural transformation

In mathematics, specifically in category theory, an extranatural transformation is a generalization of the notion of natural transformation.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  two functors of categories. A family 
 
 
 
  is said to be natural in a and extranatural in b and c if the following holds:



 
 
  is a natural transformation (in the usual sense).
(extranaturality in b) 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  the following diagram commutes







F(a,b',b) & \xrightarrow{F(1,1,g)} & F(a,b',b') \\ _{F(1,g,1)}|\qquad & & _{\eta(a,b',c)}|\qquad \\ F(a,b,b) & \xrightarrow{\eta(a,b,c)} & G(a,c,c) \end{matrix}

  the following diagram commutes







F(a,b,b) & \xrightarrow{\eta(a,b,c')} & G(a,c',c') \\ _{\eta(a,b,c)}|\qquad & & _{G(1,h,1)}|\qquad \\ G(a,c,c) & \xrightarrow{G(1,1,h)} & G(a,c,c') \end{matrix}
