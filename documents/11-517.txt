   Monomethyl-sulfatase      Monomethyl-sulfatase   In enzymology , a monomethyl-sulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   monomethyl sulfate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methanol + sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are monomethyl sulfate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are methanol and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is monomethyl-sulfate sulfohydrolase .
