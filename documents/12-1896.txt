   Event segment      Event segment   A segment of a system variable shows a homogenous status of system dynamics over a time period. Here, a homogenous status of a variable is a state which can be described by a set of coefficients of a formula. For example of homogenous statuses, we can bring status of constant ('ON' of a switch) and linear (60 miles or 96km per hour for speed). Mathematically, a segment is a function mapping from a set of times which can be defined by an real interval, to the set   Z   Z   Z    [Zeigler76 ], [ZPK00 ], [Hwang13 ]. A trajectory of a system variable is a sequence of segments concatenated. We call a trajectory constant (respectively linear) if its concatenating segments are constant (respectively linear).  An event segment is a special class of the constant segment with a constraint in which the constant segment is either one of a timed event or a null-segment. The event segments are used to define Timed Event Systems such as DEVS , timed automata , and timed petri nets .  Event segments  Time base  The time base of the concerning systems is denoted by   𝕋   𝕋   \mathbb{T}   , and defined       𝕋  =   [  0  ,  ∞  )       𝕋   0      \mathbb{T}=[0,\infty)      as the set of non-negative real numbers.  Event and null event  An event is a label that abstracts a change. Given an event set   Z   Z   Z   , the null event denoted by    ϵ  ∉  Z      ϵ  Z    \epsilon\not\in Z   stands for nothing change.  Timed event  A timed event a pair    (  t  ,  z  )     t  z    (t,z)   where    t  ∈  𝕋      t  𝕋    t\in\mathbb{T}   and    z  ∈  Z      z  Z    z\in Z   denotes that an event    z  ∈  Z      z  Z    z\in Z   occurs at time    t  ∈  𝕋      t  𝕋    t\in\mathbb{T}   .  Null segment  The null segment over time interval     [   t  l   ,   t  u   ]   ⊂  𝕋        subscript  t  l    subscript  t  u    𝕋    [t_{l},t_{u}]\subset\mathbb{T}   is denoted by    ϵ   [   t  l   ,   t  u   ]      subscript  ϵ    subscript  t  l    subscript  t  u      \epsilon_{[t_{l},t_{u}]}   which means nothing in   Z   Z   Z   occurs over    [   t  l   ,   t  u   ]      subscript  t  l    subscript  t  u     [t_{l},t_{u}]   .  Unit event segment  A unit event segment is either a null event segment or a timed event .  Concatenation  Given an event set   Z   Z   Z   , concatenation of two unit event segments    ω   ω   \omega   over    [   t  1   ,   t  2   ]      subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2     [t_{1},t_{2}]   and    ω  ′     superscript  ω  normal-′    \omega^{\prime}   over    [   t  3   ,   t  4   ]      subscript  t  3    subscript  t  4     [t_{3},t_{4}]   is denoted by    ω   ω  ′       ω   superscript  ω  normal-′     \omega\omega^{\prime}   whose time interval is    [   t  1   ,   t  4   ]      subscript  t  1    subscript  t  4     [t_{1},t_{4}]   , and implies     t  2   =   t  3        subscript  t  2    subscript  t  3     t_{2}=t_{3}   .
