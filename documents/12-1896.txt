Event segment

A segment of a system variable shows a homogenous status of system dynamics over a time period. Here, a homogenous status of a variable is a state which can be described by a set of coefficients of a formula. For example of homogenous statuses, we can bring status of constant ('ON' of a switch) and linear (60 miles or 96km per hour for speed). Mathematically, a segment is a function mapping from a set of times which can be defined by an real interval, to the set 
 
 
[Zeigler76],[ZPK00], [Hwang13]. A trajectory of a system variable is a sequence of segments concatenated. We call a trajectory constant (respectively linear) if its concatenating segments are constant (respectively linear).
An event segment is a special class of the constant segment with a constraint in which the constant segment is either one of a timed event or a null-segment. The event segments are used to define Timed Event Systems such as DEVS, timed automata, and timed petri nets.
Event segments
Time base
The time base of the concerning systems is denoted by 
 
 
 
 , and defined





as the set of non-negative real numbers.
Event and null event
An event is a label that abstracts a change. Given an event set 
 
 
 
 , the null event denoted by 
 
 
 
  stands for nothing change.
Timed event
A timed event a pair 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes that an event 
 
 
 
  occurs at time 
 
 
 
 .
Null segment
The null segment over time interval 
 
 
 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
  which means nothing in 
 
 
 
  occurs over 
 
 
 
 .
Unit event segment
A unit event segment is either a null event segment or a timed event.
Concatenation
Given an event set 
 
 
 
 , concatenation of two unit event segments

 
  over 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is denoted by 
 
 
 
  whose time interval is 
 
 
 
 
 , and implies 
 
 
 
 .
Event trajectory
An event trajectory

 
  over an event set 
 
 
 
  and a time interval 
 
 
 
  is concatenation of unit event segments

 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 .
Mathematically, an event trajectory is a mapping 
 
 
 
  a time period 
 
 
 
  to an event set 
 
 
 
 
 . So we can write it in a function form :





Timed language
The universal timed language

 
  over an event set 
 
 
 
  and a time interval 
 
 
 
 , is the set of all event trajectories over 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
A timed language

 
  over an event set 
 
 
 
  and a timed interval 
 
 
 
  is a set of event trajectories over 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 .
