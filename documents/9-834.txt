Scoring algorithm

In statistics, Fisher's scoring algorithm is a form of Newton's method used to solve maximum likelihood equations numerically.
Sketch of Derivation
Let 
 
 
 
  be random variables, independent and identically distributed with twice differentiable p.d.f.

 
 , and we wish to calculate the maximum likelihood estimator (M.L.E.) 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . First, suppose we have a starting point for our algorithm 
 
 
 
 , and consider a Taylor expansion of the score function, 
 
 
 
 , about 
 
 
 
 :



where



is the observed information matrix at 
 
 
 
 . Now, setting 
 
 
 
 , using that 
 
 
 
  and rearranging gives us:



We therefore use the algorithm



and under certain regularity conditions, it can be shown that 
 
 
 
 .
Fisher scoring
In practice, 
 
 
 
  is usually replaced by 
 
 
 
 , the Fisher information, thus giving us the Fisher Scoring Algorithm:
