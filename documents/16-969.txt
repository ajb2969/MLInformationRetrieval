   Clifford module bundle      Clifford module bundle   In differential geometry , a Clifford module bundle , a bundle of Clifford modules or just Clifford module is a vector bundle whose fibers are Clifford modules , the representations of Clifford algebras . The canonical example is a spinor bundle . 1 2 In fact, on a Spin manifold , every Clifford module is obtained by twisting the spinor bundle. 3  The notion "Clifford module bundle" should not be confused with a Clifford bundle , which is a bundle of Clifford algebras.  Spinor bundles  Given an oriented Riemannian manifold M one can ask whether it is possible to construct a bundle of irreducible  Clifford modules over Cℓ ( T * M ). In fact, such a bundle can be constructed if and only if M is a spin manifold .  Let M be an n -dimensional spin manifold with spin structure  F Spin ( M ) → F SO ( M ) on M . Given any Cℓ n R -module V one can construct the associated spinor bundle  $$S(M) = F_{\mathrm{Spin}}(M) \times_\sigma V\,$$ where σ : Spin( n ) → GL( V ) is the representation of Spin( n ) given by left multiplication on S . Such a spinor bundle is said to be real , complex , graded or ungraded according to whether on not V has the corresponding property. Sections of S ( M ) are called spinors on M .  Given a spinor bundle S ( M ) there is a natural bundle map  $$C\ell(T^*M) \otimes S(M) \to S(M)$$ which is given by left multiplication on each fiber. The spinor bundle S ( M ) is therefore a bundle of Clifford modules over Cℓ ( T * M ).
