   High-dimensional model representation      High-dimensional model representation   High-dimensional model representation is a finite  expansion for a given multivariable  function . The expansion is first described by Sobol as  $$f(\mathbf{x}) = f_0+
 \sum_{i=1}^nf_i(x_i)+
 \sum_{i,j=1 \atop i The method, used to determine the right hand side functions, is given in Sobol's paper. A review can be found here: [http://www.ima.umn.edu/reactive/abstract/li1.html High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR): Concepts and Applications].
