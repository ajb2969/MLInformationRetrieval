   Sulfite reductase (ferredoxin)      Sulfite reductase (ferredoxin)   Sulfite reductase (ferredoxin) (, ferredoxin-sulfite reductase ) is an enzyme with system name hydrogen-sulfide:ferredoxin oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction   hydrogen sulfide + 6 oxidized ferredoxin + 3 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    sulfite + 6 reduced ferredoxin + 6 H +    This sulfite reductase is an iron protein.
