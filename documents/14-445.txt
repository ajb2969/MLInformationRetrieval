   Van Laar equation      Van Laar equation   The Van Laar equation is an activity model, which was developed by Johannes van Laar in 1910-1913, to describe phase equilibria of liquid mixtures. The equation was derived from the Van der Waals equation . The original van der Waals parameters didn't give good description of vapor-liquid phase equilibria, which forced the user to fit the parameters to experimental results. Because of this, the model lost the connection to molecular properties, and therefore it has to be regarded as an empirical model to correlate experimental results.  Equations  Van Laar derived the excess enthalpy from the van der Waals equation: 1       H   e  x    =      b  1    X  1    b  2    X  2       b  1    X  1    +    b  2    X  2        (      a  1     b  1    -     a  2     b  2     )   2         superscript  H    e  x           subscript  b  1    subscript  X  1    subscript  b  2    subscript  X  2         subscript  b  1    subscript  X  1       subscript  b  2    subscript  X  2       superscript         subscript  a  1     subscript  b  1         subscript  a  2     subscript  b  2     2      H^{ex}=\frac{b_{1}X_{1}b_{2}X_{2}}{b_{1}X_{1}+b_{2}X_{2}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{a_{%
 1}}}{b_{1}}-\frac{\sqrt{a_{2}}}{b_{2}}\right)^{2}   In here a i and b i are the van der Waals parameters for attraction and excluded volume of component i. Since these parameters didn't lead to good phase equilibrium description the model was reduced to the form:        G   e  x     R  T    =     A  12    X  1    A  21    X  2       A  12    X  1    +    A  21    X  2             superscript  G    e  x      R  T         subscript  A  12    subscript  X  1    subscript  A  21    subscript  X  2         subscript  A  12    subscript  X  1       subscript  A  21    subscript  X  2        \frac{G^{ex}}{RT}=\frac{A_{12}X_{1}A_{21}X_{2}}{A_{12}X_{1}+A_{21}X_{2}}   In here A 12 and A 21 are constants, which are obtained by regression of experimental vapor–liquid equilibrium data.  The activity coefficient of component i is derived by differentiation to x i . This yields:      {        ln    γ  1    =    A  12     (      A  21    X  2       A  12    X  1    +    A  21    X  2       )   2            ln    γ  2    =    A  21     (      A  12    X  1       A  12    X  1    +    A  21    X  2       )   2           fragments  normal-{         subscript  γ  1       subscript  A  12    superscript       subscript  A  21    subscript  X  2         subscript  A  12    subscript  X  1       subscript  A  21    subscript  X  2      2            subscript  γ  2       subscript  A  21    superscript       subscript  A  12    subscript  X  1         subscript  A  12    subscript  X  1       subscript  A  21    subscript  X  2      2         \left\{\begin{matrix}\ln\ \gamma_{1}=A_{12}\left(\frac{A_{21}X_{2}}{A_{12}X_{1%
 }+A_{21}X_{2}}\right)^{2}\\
 \ln\ \gamma_{2}=A_{21}\left(\frac{A_{12}X_{1}}{A_{12}X_{1}+A_{21}X_{2}}\right)%
 ^{2}\end{matrix}\right.     This shows that the constants A 12 and A 21 are equal to logarithmic limiting activity coefficients    ln   (   γ  1  ∞   )        superscript   subscript  γ  1       \ln\left(\gamma_{1}^{\infty}\right)   and    ln   (   γ  2  ∞   )        superscript   subscript  γ  2       \ln\left(\gamma_{2}^{\infty}\right)   respectively. The model gives increasing (A 12 and A 21 >0) or only decreasing (A 12 and A 21 A_{12}=A_{21}=A, which implies that the molecules are of equal size but different in polarity, then the equations become:      {        ln    γ  1    =   A   x  2  2            ln    γ  2    =   A   x  1  2           fragments  normal-{         subscript  γ  1      A   subscript   superscript  x  2   2            subscript  γ  2      A   subscript   superscript  x  2   1         \left\{\begin{matrix}\ln\ \gamma_{1}=Ax^{2}_{2}\\
 \ln\ \gamma_{2}=Ax^{2}_{1}\end{matrix}\right.     In this case the activity coefficients mirror at x 1 =0.5. When A=0 the model the activity coefficients are unity, thus describing an ideal mixture.  References  "  Category:Thermodynamic equations     The Open Thermodynamics Journal, 2010, 4, 129-140 ↩
