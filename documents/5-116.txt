   Weyl transformation      Weyl transformation    See also Wigner–Weyl transform , for another definition of the Weyl transform.    In theoretical physics , the Weyl transformation , named after Hermann Weyl , is a local rescaling of the metric tensor :       g   a  b    →    e   -   2  ω   (  x  )       g   a  b        normal-→   subscript  g    a  b       superscript  e      2  ω  x      subscript  g    a  b       g_{ab}\rightarrow e^{-2\omega(x)}g_{ab}     which produces another metric in the same conformal class . A theory or an expression invariant under this transformation is called conformally invariant , or is said to possess Weyl symmetry . The Weyl symmetry is an important symmetry in conformal field theory . It is, for example, a symmetry of the Polyakov action .  The ordinary Levi-Civita connection and associated spin connections are not invariant under Weyl transformations. An appropriately invariant notion is the Weyl connection , which is one way of specifying the structure of a conformal connection .  A quantity φ has conformal weight  k if, under the Weyl transformation, it transforms via       φ  →   φ   e   k  ω      .     normal-→  φ    φ   superscript  e    k  ω       \varphi\to\varphi e^{k\omega}.     Thus conformally weighted quantities belong to certain density bundles ; see also conformal dimension . Let A μ be the connection one-form associated to the Levi-Civita connection of g . Introduce a connection that depends also on an initial one-form     ∂  μ   ω      subscript   μ   ω    \partial_{\mu}\omega   via        B  μ   =    A  μ   +    ∂  μ   ω     .       subscript  B  μ      subscript  A  μ     subscript   μ   ω      B_{\mu}=A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}\omega.     Then      D  μ   φ   ≡     ∂  μ   φ   +   k   B  μ   φ           subscript  D  μ   φ       subscript   μ   φ     k   subscript  B  μ   φ      D_{\mu}\varphi\equiv\partial_{\mu}\varphi+kB_{\mu}\varphi   is covariant and has conformal weight    k  -  1      k  1    k-1   .
