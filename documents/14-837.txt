   Aggregate modulus      Aggregate modulus   In relation to biomechanics , the aggregate modulus (Ha) is a measurement of the stiffness of a material at equilibrium when fluid has ceased flowing through it. The aggregate modulus can be calculated from Young's modulus (E) and the Poisson ratio (v).       H  a   =    E   (   1  -  v   )    /   [    (   1  +  v   )    (   1  -   2  v    )    ]          H  a       E    1  v     delimited-[]      1  v     1    2  v         Ha=E(1-v)/[(1+v)(1-2v)]     The aggregate modulus of a similar specimen is determined from a unidirectional deformational testing configuration, i.e., the only non-zero strain component is E 11 , as opposed to the Young's modulus, which is determined from a unidirectional loading testing configuration, i.e., the only non-zero stress component is, say, in the e 1 direction. In this test, the only non-zero component of the stress tensor is T 11 .
