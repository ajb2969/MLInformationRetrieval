   Ethanolamine oxidase      Ethanolamine oxidase   In enzymology , an ethanolamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ethanolamine + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycolaldehyde + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ethanolamine , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are glycolaldehyde , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ethanolamine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) . It has 2 cofactors : cobalt , and Cobamide .
