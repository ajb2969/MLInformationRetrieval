Ethanolamine oxidase

In enzymology, an ethanolamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ethanolamine + H2O + O2

 
  glycolaldehyde + NH3 + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ethanolamine, H2O, and O2, whereas its 3 products are glycolaldehyde, NH3, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ethanolamine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating). It has 2 cofactors: cobalt, and Cobamide.
