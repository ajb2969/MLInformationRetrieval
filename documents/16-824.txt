In mathematics, the Manin conjecture describes the conjectural distribution of rational points on an algebraic variety relative to a suitable height function. It was proposed by Yuri I. Manin and his collaborators1 in 1989 when they initiated a program with the aim of describing the distribution of rational points on suitable algebraic varieties.
Their main conjecture is as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be a Fano variety defined over a number field

 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a height function which is relative to the anticanonical divisor and assume that 
 
 
 
  is Zariski dense in 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists a non-empty Zariski open subset

 
  such that the counting function of 
 
 
 
 -rational points of bounded height, defined by


 
  for 
 
 
 
 , satisfies


 
  as 
 
 
 
  Here 
 
 
 
  is the rank of the Picard group of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a positive constant which later received a conjectural interpretation by Peyre.2
Manin's conjecture has been decided for special families of varieties,3 but is still open in general.
