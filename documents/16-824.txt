It was proposed by Yuri I. Manin and his collaborators 1 in 1989 when they initiated a program with the aim of describing the distribution of rational points on suitable algebraic varieties.  Their main conjecture is as follows. Let   V   V   V   be a Fano variety defined over a number field    K   K   K   , let   H   H   H   be a height function which is relative to the anticanonical divisor and assume that    V   (  K  )       V  K    V(K)   is Zariski dense in   V   V   V   . Then there exists a non-empty Zariski open subset     U  ⊂  V      U  V    U\subset V   such that the counting function of   K   K   K   -rational points of bounded height, defined by        N   U  ,  H     (  B  )    =   #   {   x  ∈   U   (  K  )     :    H   (  x  )    ≤  B   }           subscript  N   U  H    B     normal-#   conditional-set    x    U  K        H  x   B       N_{U,H}(B)=\#\{x\in U(K):H(x)\leq B\}   for    B  ≥  1      B  1    B\geq 1   , satisfies         N   U  ,  H     (  B  )    ∼   c  B    (   log  B   )    ρ  -  1      ,     similar-to     subscript  N   U  H    B     c  B   superscript    B     ρ  1       N_{U,H}(B)\sim cB(\log B)^{\rho-1},   as     B  →  ∞   .     normal-→  B     B\to\infty.   Here   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the rank of the Picard group of   V   V   V   and   c   c   c   is a positive constant which later received a conjectural interpretation by Peyre. 2  Manin's conjecture has been decided for special families of varieties, 3 but is still open in general.
