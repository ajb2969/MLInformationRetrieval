   Poincaré–Miranda theorem      Poincaré–Miranda theorem   In mathematics, the Poincaré–Miranda theorem is a generalization of the intermediate value theorem , from a single function in a single dimension, to n functions in n dimensions. It says as follows:    Consider n continuous functions of n variables. Assume that for every variable    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   , the function    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   is constantly negative when     x  i   =  0       subscript  x  i   0    x_{i}=0   and constantly positive when     x  i   =  1       subscript  x  i   1    x_{i}=1   . Then there is a point in the n -dimensional unit cube in which all functions are simultaneously equal to 0.     The theorem is named after Henri Poincaré , who conjectured it in 1883, and Carlo Miranda , who in 1940 showed that it is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem . 1  Intuition  The figure on the right shows an illustration of the Poincaré–Miranda theorem for    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   functions. The function f is negative on the left boundary and positive on the right boundary. When we go from left to right along any path, we must go through a point in which f is 0. Therefore, there must be a "wall" separating the left from the right, along which f is 0 (green). Similarly, there must be a "wall" separating the top from the bottom, along which g is 0 (red). These walls must intersect in a point in which both functions are 0 (blue).  Generalizations  For every variable    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   , let    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}   be any value in the range:    [    sup    x  i   =  0     f  i    ,    inf    x  i   =  1     f  i    ]       subscript  supremum     subscript  x  i   0     subscript  f  i      subscript  infimum     subscript  x  i   1     subscript  f  i      [\sup_{x_{i}=0}{f_{i}},\inf_{x_{i}=1}{f_{i}}]   . Then there is a point in the unit cube in which for all i      f  i   =   a  i        subscript  f  i    subscript  a  i     f_{i}=a_{i}   . This can be reduced to the original statement by a simple translation of coordinates.  References     "  Category:Topology  Category:Real analysis     ↩
