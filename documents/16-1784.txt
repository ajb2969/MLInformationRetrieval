Poincaré–Miranda theorem

In mathematics, the Poincaré–Miranda theorem is a generalization of the intermediate value theorem, from a single function in a single dimension, to n functions in n dimensions. It says as follows:


Consider n continuous functions of n variables. Assume that for every variable 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is constantly negative when 
 
 
 
  and constantly positive when 
 
 
 
 . Then there is a point in the n-dimensional unit cube in which all functions are simultaneously equal to 0.
 



The theorem is named after Henri Poincaré, who conjectured it in 1883, and Carlo Miranda, who in 1940 showed that it is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.1
Intuition
 The figure on the right shows an illustration of the Poincaré–Miranda theorem for 
 
 
 
  functions. The function f is negative on the left boundary and positive on the right boundary. When we go from left to right along any path, we must go through a point in which f is 0. Therefore, there must be a "wall" separating the left from the right, along which f is 0 (green). Similarly, there must be a "wall" separating the top from the bottom, along which g is 0 (red). These walls must intersect in a point in which both functions are 0 (blue).
Generalizations
For every variable 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be any value in the range: 
 
 
 
 . Then there is a point in the unit cube in which for all i

 
 . This can be reduced to the original statement by a simple translation of coordinates.
