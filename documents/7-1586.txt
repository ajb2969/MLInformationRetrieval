Monoidal natural transformation

Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two monoidal categories and


 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are two lax monoidal functors between those categories.
A monoidal natural transformation


 
  between those functors is a natural transformation

 
  between the underlying functors such that the diagrams

  and  
 

commute for every objects 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  (see Definition 11 in 1).
A symmetric monoidal natural transformation is a monoidal natural transformation between symmetric monoidal functors.
