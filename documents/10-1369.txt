   3-hydroxyanthranilate oxidase      3-hydroxyanthranilate oxidase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxyanthranilate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-imino-5-oxocyclohexa-1,3-dienecarboxylate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxyanthranilate and O 2 , whereas its two products are 6-imino-5-oxocyclohexa-1,3-dienecarboxylate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on diphenols and related substances as donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxyanthranilate:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase .
