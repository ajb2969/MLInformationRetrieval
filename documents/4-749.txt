Molar refractivity

Molar refractivity, 
 
 
 
 , is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance and is dependent on the temperature, the index of refraction, and the pressure.
The molar refractivity is defined as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Avogadro constant and 
 
 
 
  is the mean polarizability of a molecule.
Substituting the molar refractivity into the Lorentz-Lorenz formula gives



For a gas, 
 
 
 
 , so the molar refractivity can be approximated by



In SI units, 
 
 
 
  has units of J mol−1 K−1, 
 
 
 
  has units K, 
 
 
 
  has no units, and 
 
 
 
  has units of Pa, so the units of 
 
 
 
  are m3 mol−1.
In terms of density, ρ molecular weight, M it can be shown that:
