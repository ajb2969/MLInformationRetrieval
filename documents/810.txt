   Perfect ruler      Perfect ruler   A perfect ruler of length   n   n   n   is a ruler with a subset of the integer markings     {  0  ,   a  2   ,  ⋯  ,   a  n   }   ⊂   {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  n  }        0   subscript  a  2   normal-⋯   subscript  a  n     0  1  2  normal-…  n     \{0,a_{2},\cdots,a_{n}\}\subset\{0,1,2,\ldots,n\}   that appear on a regular ruler. The defining criterion of this subset is that there exists an   m   m   m   such that any positive integer     k  ≤  m      k  m    k\leq m   can be expressed uniquely as a difference     k  =    a  i   -   a  j        k     subscript  a  i    subscript  a  j      k=a_{i}-a_{j}   for some    i  ,  j     i  j    i,j   . This is referred to as an   m   m   m   -perfect ruler.  A 4-perfect ruler of length   7   7   7   is given by    {  0  ,  1  ,  3  ,  7  }     0  1  3  7    \{0,1,3,7\}   . To verify this, we need to show that every number    1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4     1  2  3  4    1,2,3,4   can be expressed as a difference of two numbers in the above set:      1  =   1  -  0       1    1  0     1=1-0         2  =   3  -  1       2    3  1     2=3-1         3  =   3  -  0       3    3  0     3=3-0         4  =   7  -  3       4    7  3     4=7-3     An optimal perfect ruler is one where for a fixed value of   n   n   n   the value of    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   is minimized.
