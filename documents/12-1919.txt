   Blade (geometry)      Blade (geometry)   In geometric algebra , a blade is a generalization of the concept of scalars and vectors to include simple  bivectors , trivectors , etc. Specifically, a   k   k   k   -blade is any object that can be expressed as the exterior product (informally wedge product ) of   k   k   k   vectors, and is of grade    k   k   k   .  In detail: 1   A 0-blade is a scalar .  A 1-blade is a vector . Every vector is simple.  A 2-blade is a simple  bivector . Linear combinations of 2-blades also are bivectors, but need not be simple, and are hence not necessarily 2-blades. A 2-blade may be expressed as the wedge product of two vectors   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   and   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   :      𝐚  ∧  𝐛   .      𝐚  𝐛    \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}.     A 3-blade is a simple trivector, that is, it may expressed as the wedge product of three vectors   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   ,   𝐛   𝐛   \mathbf{b}   , and   𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}   :      𝐚  ∧  𝐛  ∧  𝐜   .      𝐚  𝐛  𝐜    \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}.     In a space of dimension   n   n   n   , a blade of grade    n  −  1      n  normal-−  1    n−1   is called a pseudovector . 2  The highest grade element in a space is called a pseudoscalar , and in a space of dimension   n   n   n   is an   n   n   n   -blade. 3  In a space of dimension   n   n   n   , there are     k   (   n  −  k   )    +  1        k    n  normal-−  k    1    k(n−k)+1   dimensions of freedom in choosing a   k   k   k   -blade, of which one dimension is an overall scaling multiplier. 4   For an   n   n   n   -dimensional space, there are blades of all grades from 0 to   n   n   n   inclusive. A vector subspace of finite dimension   k   k   k   may be represented by the   k   k   k   -blade formed as a wedge product of all the elements of a basis for that subspace. 5  Examples  For example, in 2-dimensional space scalars are described as 0-blades, vectors are 1-blades, and area elements are 2-blades known as pseudoscalars , in that they are one-dimensional objects distinct from regular scalars.  In three-dimensional space, 0-blades are again scalars and 1-blades are three-dimensional vectors, but in three-dimensions, areas have an orientation, so while 2-blades are area elements, they are oriented. 3-blades (trivectors) represent volume elements and in three-dimensional space, these are scalar-like—i.e., 3-blades in three-dimensions form a one-dimensional vector space.

The proof of the dimensionality is actually straightforward. Take   k   k   k   vectors and wedge them together     v  1   ∧  ⋯  ∧   v  k        subscript  v  1   normal-⋯   subscript  v  k     v_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge v_{k}   and perform elementary column operations on these (factoring the pivots out) until the top    k  ×  k      k  normal-×  k    k×k   block are elementary basis vectors of    𝔽  k     superscript  𝔽  k    \mathbb{F}^{k}   . The wedge product is then parametrized by the product of the pivots and the lower    k  ×    (   n  −  k   )       k  normal-×  normal-    n  normal-−  k     k× (n−k)   block. ↩  ↩
