Myo-inosose-2 dehydratase

In enzymology, a myo-inosose-2 dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone 
 
 
 
  3,5/4-trihydroxycyclohexa-1,2-dione + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone, and two products, 3,5/4-trihydroxycyclohexa-1,2-dione and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone hydro-lyase (3,5/4-trihydroxycyclohexa-1,2-dione-forming). Other names in common use include inosose 2,3-dehydratase, ketoinositol dehydratase, and 2,4,6/3,5-pentahydroxycyclohexanone hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism. It has 2 cofactors: manganese, and Cobalt.
