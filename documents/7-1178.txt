   Markov additive process      Markov additive process   In applied probability , a Markov additive process ( MAP ) is a bivariate Markov process where the future states depends only on one of the variables. 1  Definition  Finite or countable state space for J ( t )  The process {( X ( t ), J ( t ))¬†: t ‚â•¬†0} is a Markov additive process with continuous time parameter t if 2   {( X ( t ), J ( t ))¬†: t ‚â•¬†0} is a Markov process  the conditional distribution of ( X ( t + s )¬†‚àí X ( t ), J ( s + t )) given ( X ( s ), J ( s )) depends only on J ( s ).   The state space of the process is R √ó S where X ( t ) takes real values and J ( t ) takes values in some countable set S .  General state space for J ( t )  For the case where J ( t ) takes a more general state space the evolution of X ( t ) is governed by J ( t ) in the sense that for any f and g we require 3        ùîº   [  f   (   X   t  +  s    -   X  t   )   g   (   J   t  +  s    )   |   ‚Ñ±  t   ]   =   ùîº    J  t   ,  0     [  f   (   X  s   )   g   (   J  s   )   ]      fragments  E   fragments  normal-[  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  X    t  s      subscript  X  t   normal-)   g   fragments  normal-(   subscript  J    t  s    normal-)   normal-|   subscript  ‚Ñ±  t   normal-]     subscript  ùîº    subscript  J  t   0     fragments  normal-[  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  X  s   normal-)   g   fragments  normal-(   subscript  J  s   normal-)   normal-]     \mathbb{E}[f(X_{t+s}-X_{t})g(J_{t+s})|\mathcal{F}_{t}]=\mathbb{E}_{J_{t},0}[f(%
 X_{s})g(J_{s})]   .     Example  A fluid queue is a Markov additive process where J ( t ) is a continuous-time Markov chain .  Applications  √áinlar uses the unique structure of the MAP to prove that, given a gamma process with a shape parameter that is a function of Brownian motion , the resulting lifetime is distributed according to the Weibull distribution .  Kharoufeh presents a compact transform expression for the failure distribution for wear processes of a component degrading according to a Markovian environment inducing state-dependent continuous linear wear by using the properties of a MAP and assuming the wear process to be temporally homogeneous and that the environmental process has a finite state space .
