   Pappus chain      Pappus chain   (Figure)  A Pappus chain   In geometry , the Pappus chain was created by Pappus of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD .  Construction  The arbelos is defined by two circles, C U and C V , which are tangent at the point A and where C U is enclosed by C V . Let the radii of these two circles be denoted as r U and r V , respectively, and let their respective centers be the points U and V . The Pappus chain consists of the circles in the shaded grey region, which are externally tangent to C U (the inner circle) and internally tangent to C V (the outer circle). Let the radius, diameter and center point of the n th circle of the Pappus chain be denoted as r n , d n and P n , respectively.  Properties  Centers of the circles  Ellipse  All the centers of the circles in the Pappus chain are located on a common ellipse , for the following reason. The sum of the distances from the n th circle of the Pappus chain to the two centers U and V of the arbelos circles equals a constant          𝐏  n   𝐔   ¯   +     𝐏  n   𝐕   ¯    =    (    r  U   +   r  n    )   +   (    r  V   -   r  n    )    =    r  U   +   r  V             normal-¯     subscript  𝐏  n   𝐔     normal-¯     subscript  𝐏  n   𝐕          subscript  r  U    subscript  r  n       subscript  r  V    subscript  r  n             subscript  r  U    subscript  r  V       \overline{\mathbf{P}_{n}\mathbf{U}}+\overline{\mathbf{P}_{n}\mathbf{V}}=\left(%
 r_{U}+r_{n}\right)+\left(r_{V}-r_{n}\right)=r_{U}+r_{V}     Thus, the foci of this ellipse are U and V , the centers of the two circles that define the arbelos; these points correspond to the midpoints of the line segments AB and AC , respectively.  Coordinates  If r = AC / AB , then the center of the n th circle in the chain is:       (   x  n   ,   y  n   )   =   (     r   (   1  +  r   )     2   [     n  2     (   1  -  r   )   2    +  r   ]      ,    n  r   (   1  -  r   )       n  2     (   1  -  r   )   2    +  r    )         subscript  x  n    subscript  y  n         r    1  r      2   delimited-[]       superscript  n  2    superscript    1  r   2    r          n  r    1  r         superscript  n  2    superscript    1  r   2    r       \left(x_{n},y_{n}\right)=\left(\frac{r(1+r)}{2[n^{2}(1-r)^{2}+r]}~{},~{}\frac{%
 nr(1-r)}{n^{2}(1-r)^{2}+r}\right)     Radii of the circles  If r = AC / AB , then the radius of the n th circle in the chain is:       r  n   =     (   1  -  r   )   r    2   [     n  2     (   1  -  r   )   2    +  r   ]          subscript  r  n         1  r   r     2   delimited-[]       superscript  n  2    superscript    1  r   2    r        r_{n}=\frac{(1-r)r}{2[n^{2}(1-r)^{2}+r]}     Circle inversion  The height h n of the center of the n th circle above the base diameter ACB equals n times d n . 1 This may be shown by inverting in a circle centered on the tangent point A . The circle of inversion is chosen to intersect the n th circle perpendicularly, so that the n th circle is transformed into itself. The two arbelos circles, C U and C V , are transformed into parallel lines tangent to and sandwiching the n th circle; hence, the other circles of the Pappus chain are transformed into similarly sandwiched circles of the same diameter. The initial circle C 0 and the final circle C n each contribute ½ d n to the height h n , whereas the circles C 1 – C n −1 each contribute d n . Adding these contributions together yields the equation h n = n  d n .  The same inversion can be used to show that the points where the circles of the Pappus chain are tangent to one another lie on a common circle. As noted above, the inversion centered at point A transforms the arbelos circles C U and C V into two parallel lines, and the circles of the Pappus chain into a stack of equally sized circles sandwiched between the two parallel lines. Hence, the points of tangency between the transformed circles lie on a line midway between the two parallel lines. Undoing the inversion in the circle, this line of tangent points is transformed back into a circle.  Steiner chain  In these properties of having centers on an ellipse and tangencies on a circle, the Pappus chain is analogous to the Steiner chain , in which finitely many circles are tangent to two circles.
