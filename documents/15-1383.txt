Nearest neighbour classifiers

Nearest neighbour classifiers are a class of non-parametric methods used in statistical classification (or pattern recognition). The method classifies objects based on closest training examples in the feature space.
Statistical setting
Suppose we have pairs 
 
 
 
  taking values in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the class label of 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  (and probability distributions 
 
 
 
 ). Given some norm 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and a point 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a reordering of the training data such that 
 
 
 
 .
The 
 
 
 
 -nearest neighbour classifier
The most intuitive nearest neighbour type classifier is the one nearest neighbour classifier that assigns a point 
 
 
 
  to the class of its closest neighbour in the feature space, that is 
 
 
 
 .
As the size of training data set approaches infinity, the one nearest neighbour classifier guarantees an error rate of no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum achievable error rate given the distribution of the data).
The 
 
 
 
 -nearest neighbour classifier
The 
 
 
 
 -nearest neighbour classifier assigns a point 
 
 
 
  to a particular class based on a majority vote among the classes of the 
 
 
 
  nearest training points to 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
There are many results on the error rate of the 
 
 
 
  nearest neighbour classifiers.1 The 
 
 
 
 -nearest neighbour classifier is strongly (that is for any joint distribution on 
 
 
 
 ) consistent provided 
 
 
 
  diverges and 
 
 
 
  converges to zero as 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the 
 
 
 
  nearest neighbour classifier based on a training set of size 
 
 
 
 . Under certain regularity conditions, the excess risk yields the following asymptotic expansion2








for some constants 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The choice 
 
 
 
  offers a trade off between the two terms in the above display, for which the 
 
 
 
 -nearest neighbour error converges to the Bayes error at the optimal (minimax) rate 
 
 
 
 .
The weighted nearest neighbour classifier
The 
 
 
 
 -nearest neighbour classifier can be viewed as assigning the 
 
 
 
  nearest neighbours a weight 
 
 
 
  and all others 
 
 
 
  weight. This can be generalised to weighted nearest neighbour classifiers. That is, where the 
 
 
 
 th nearest neighbour is assigned a weight 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 . An analogous result on the strong consistency of weighted nearest neighbour classifiers also holds.3
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the weighted nearest classifier with weights 
 
 
 
 . Subject to regularity conditions on to class distributions the excess risk has the following asymptotic expansion4


 
  for constants 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The optimal weighting scheme 
 
 
 
 , that balances the two terms in the display above, is given as follows: set 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  for 
 
 
 
  and


 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
With optimal weights the dominant term in the asymptotic expansion of the excess risk is 
 
 
 
 . Similar results are true when using a bagged nearest neighbour classifier.
