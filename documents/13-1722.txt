   Eells–Kuiper manifold      Eells–Kuiper manifold   In mathematics, an Eells–Kuiper manifold is a compactification of    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   by an    n  2      n  2    \frac{n}{2}   - sphere , where n = 2, 4, 8, or 16. It is named after James Eells and Nicolaas Kuiper .  If n = 2, the Eells–Kuiper manifold is diffeomorphic to the real projective plane     R  P   (  2  )       R  P  2    RP(2)   . For    n  ≥  4      n  4    n\geq 4   it is simply-connected and has the integral cohomology structure of the complex projective plane     C   P  2       C   superscript  P  2     CP^{2}   (    n  =  4      n  4    n=4   ), of the quaternionic projective plane     H   P  2       H   superscript  P  2     HP^{2}   (    n  =  8      n  8    n=8   ) or of the Cayley projective plane ( n = 16).  Properties  These manifolds are important in both Morse theory and foliation theory :  Theorem: 1  Let   M   M   M   be a connected  closed  manifold (not necessarily orientable ) of dimension   n   n   n   . Suppose   M   M   M   admits a Morse function     f  :   M  →  R      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  R     f:M\to R   of class    C  3     superscript  C  3    C^{3}   with exactly three singular points . Then   M   M   M   is a Eells–Kuiper manifold.  Theorem: 2  Let    M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   be a compact connected manifold and   F   F   F   a Morse foliation on   M   M   M   . Suppose the number of centers    c   c   c   of the foliation   F   F   F   is more than the number of saddles    s   s   s   . Then there are two possibilities:       c  =   s  +  2       c    s  2     c=s+2   , and    M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   is homeomorphic to the sphere    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}    ,        c  =   s  +  1       c    s  1     c=s+1   , and    M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   is an Eells—Kuiper manifold,    n  =   2  ,  4  ,  8       n   2  4  8     n=2,4,8   or   16   16   16   .
