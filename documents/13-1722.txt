Eells–Kuiper manifold

In mathematics, an Eells–Kuiper manifold is a compactification of 
 
 
 
  by an 
 
 
 
  - sphere, where n = 2, 4, 8, or 16. It is named after James Eells and Nicolaas Kuiper.
If n = 2, the Eells–Kuiper manifold is diffeomorphic to the real projective plane

 
 . For 
 
 
 
  it is simply-connected and has the integral cohomology structure of the complex projective plane

 
  (
 
 
 
 ), of the quaternionic projective plane

 
  (
 
 
 
 ) or of the Cayley projective plane (n = 16).
Properties
These manifolds are important in both Morse theory and foliation theory:
Theorem:1 Let 
 
 
 
  be a connected closed manifold (not necessarily orientable) of dimension 
 
 
 
 . Suppose 
 
 
 
  admits a Morse function

 
  of class 
 
 
 
  with exactly three singular points. Then 
 
 
 
  is a Eells–Kuiper manifold.
Theorem:2 Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact connected manifold and 
 
 
 
  a Morse foliation on 
 
 
 
 . Suppose the number of centers

 
  of the foliation 
 
 
 
  is more than the number of saddles

 
 . Then there are two possibilities:



 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is homeomorphic to the sphere 
 
 
,




 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is an Eells—Kuiper manifold, 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
