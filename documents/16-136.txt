   Sample entropy      Sample entropy   Sample entropy (SampEn) is a modification of approximate entropy (ApEn), used extensively for assessing the complexity of a physiological time-series signal, thereby diagnosing diseased state. 1 Unlike ApEn, SampEn shows good traits such as data length independence and trouble-free implementation. Also, there is a small computational difference: In ApEn, the comparison between the template vector (see below) and the rest of the vectors also includes comparison with itself. This guarantees that probabilities     C  i   ′  m     (  r  )        superscript   subscript  C  i    normal-′  m    r    C_{i}^{\prime m}(r)   are never zero. Consequently, it is always possible to take a logarithm of probabilities. Because template comparisons with itself lower ApEn values, the signals are interpreted to be more regular than they actually are. These self-matches are not included in SampEn.  There is a multiscale version of SampEn as well, suggested by Costa and others. 2  Definition  Like approximate entropy (ApEn), Sample entropy ( SampEn ) is a measure of complexity  1 . But it does not include self-similar patterns as ApEn does. For a given embedding  dimension    m   m   m   , tolerance    r   r   r   and number of data points    N   N   N   , SampEn is the negative logarithm of the probability that if two sets of simultaneous data points of length   m   m   m   have distance     <  r      absent  r       then two sets of simultaneous data points of length    m  +  1      m  1    m+1   also have distance     <  r      absent  r       . And we represent it by    S  a  m  p  E  n   (  m  ,  r  ,  N  )       S  a  m  p  E  n   m  r  N     SampEn(m,r,N)   (or by    S  a  m  p  E  n   (  m  ,  r  ,  τ  ,  N  )       S  a  m  p  E  n   m  r  τ  N     SampEn(m,r,\tau,N)   including sampling time   τ   τ   \tau   ).  Now assume we have a time-series data set of length    N  =   {   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   ,  …  ,   x  N   }       N    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3   normal-…   subscript  x  N      N={\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},...,x_{N}\}}   with a constant time interval   τ   τ   \tau   . We define a template vector of length   m   m   m   , such that      X  m    (  i  )    =   {   x  i   ,   x   i  +  1    ,   x   i  +  2    ,  …  ,   x    i  +  m   -  1    }          subscript  X  m   i     subscript  x  i    subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x    i  2    normal-…   subscript  x      i  m   1       X_{m}(i)={\{x_{i},x_{i+1},x_{i+2},...,x_{i+m-1}\}}   and the distance function    d   [    X  m    (  i  )    ,    X  m    (  j  )    ]       d      subscript  X  m   i      subscript  X  m   j      d[X_{m}(i),X_{m}(j)]   (i≠j) is to be the Chebyshev distance (but it could be any distance function, including Euclidean distance). We count the number of vector pairs in template vectors of length   m   m   m   and    m  +  1      m  1    m+1   having     d   [    X  m    (  i  )    ,    X  m    (  j  )    ]    <  r        d      subscript  X  m   i      subscript  X  m   j     r    d[X_{m}(i),X_{m}(j)]   and denote it by   B   B   B   and   A   A   A   respectively. We define the sample entropy to be       S  a  m  p  E  n   =   -   log   A  B           S  a  m  p  E  n         A  B       SampEn=-\log{A\over B}     Where,     A   A   A   = no of template vector pairs having     d   [    X   m  +  1     (  i  )    ,    X   m  +  1     (  j  )    ]    <  r        d      subscript  X    m  1    i      subscript  X    m  1    j     r    d[X_{m+1}(i),X_{m+1}(j)]   of length    m  +  1      m  1    m+1      B   B   B   = no of template vector pairs having     d   [    X  m    (  i  )    ,    X  m    (  j  )    ]    <  r        d      subscript  X  m   i      subscript  X  m   j     r    d[X_{m}(i),X_{m}(j)]   of length   m   m   m     It is clear from the definition that   A   A   A   will always have a value smaller or equal to   B   B   B   . Therefore,    S  a  m  p  E  n   (  m  ,  r  ,  τ  )       S  a  m  p  E  n   m  r  τ     SampEn(m,r,\tau)   will be always either be zero or positive value. A smaller value of    S  a  m  p  E  n      S  a  m  p  E  n    SampEn   also indicates more self-similarity in data set or less noise.  Generally we take the value of   m   m   m   to be   2   2   2   and the value of   r   r   r   to be     0.2  ×  s   t  d        0.2  s   t  d    0.2\times std   . Where std stands for standard deviation which should be taken over a very large dataset. For instance, the r value of 6 ms is appropriate for sample entropy calculations of heart rate intervals, since this corresponds to     0.2  ×  s   t  d        0.2  s   t  d    0.2\times std   for a very large population.  Multiscale SampEn  The definition mentioned above is a special case of multi scale sampEn with    δ  =  1      δ  1    \delta=1   ,where   δ   δ   \delta   is called skipping parameter. In multiscale SampEn template vectors are defined with a certain interval between its each element specified by the value of   δ   δ   \delta   . And modified template vector is defined as      X   m  ,  δ     (  i  )    =    x  i   ,   x   i  +  δ    ,   x   i  +   2  ×  δ     ,  …  ,   x   i  +    (   m  -  1   )   ×  δ             subscript  X   m  δ    i     subscript  x  i    subscript  x    i  δ     subscript  x    i    2  δ     normal-…   subscript  x    i      m  1   δ        X_{m,\delta}(i)={x_{i},x_{i+\delta},x_{i+2\times\delta},...,x_{i+(m-1)\times%
 \delta}}   and sampEn can be written as     S  a  m  p  E  n   (  m  ,  r  ,  δ  )    =   -   log    A  δ    B  δ            S  a  m  p  E  n   m  r  δ           subscript  A  δ    subscript  B  δ        SampEn\left(m,r,\delta\right)=-\log{A_{\delta}\over B_{\delta}}   And we calculate    A  δ     subscript  A  δ    A_{\delta}   and    B  δ     subscript  B  δ    B_{\delta}   like before.  Implementation  Sample entropy can be implemented easily in many different programming languages. An example written in MatLab can be found here .
