Mott Criterion

The Mott criterion describes the critical point of the metal-insulator transition. The criterion is



where 
 
 
 
  is the electron density of the material and 
 
 
 
  the effective bohr radius. The constant 
 
 
 
 , according to various estimates, is 2.0, 2.78,4.0, or 4.2.
If the criterion is satisfied (i.e. if the density of electrons is sufficiently high) the material becomes conductive (metal) and otherwise it will be an insulator.
