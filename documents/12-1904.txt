   Mott Criterion      Mott Criterion   The Mott criterion describes the critical point of the metal-insulator transition. The criterion is        n   -   1  /  3     <   C   a  0  *     ,       superscript  n      1  3       C   superscript   subscript  a  0        n^{-1/3}     where    n    n   ~{}n   is the electron density of the material and    a  0  *     superscript   subscript  a  0      a_{0}^{*}   the effective bohr radius. The constant   C   C   C   , according to various estimates, is 2.0, 2.78,4.0, or 4.2.  If the criterion is satisfied (i.e. if the density of electrons is sufficiently high) the material becomes conductive (metal) and otherwise it will be an insulator.  1  See also   Hubbard model  Mottness  Bohr Radius  Mott Insulator   References  "  Category:Quantum phases     â†©
