Module homomorphism

In algebra, a module homomorphism is a function between modules that preserves module structures. Explicitly, if M and N are left modules over a ring R, then a function 
 
 
 
  is called a module homomorphism or a R-linear map if for any x, y in M and r in R,





 
  If M, N are right module, then the second condition is replaced with








The pre-image of the zero element under f is called the kernel of f. The set of all module homomorphisms from M to N is denoted by HomR(M, N). It is an abelian group but is not necessarily a module unless R is commutative.
The isomorphism theorems hold for module homomorphisms.
Examples



 
 .
For any ring R,
 


 
  as rings when R is viewed as a right module over itself.


 
  through 
 
 
 
  for any left module M.1


 
  is called the dual module of M; it is a left (resp. right) module if M is a right (resp. left) module over R with the module structure coming from the R-action on R. It is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .


Operations
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are module homomorphisms, then their direct sum is


 
  and their tensor product is



Let 
 
 
 
  be a module homomorphism between left modules. The transpose of f is


 
  If f is an isomorphism, then the transpose of the inverse of f is called the contragredient of f.
Exact sequences
A short sequence of modules over a commutative ring


 
  consists of modules A, B, C and homomorphisms f, g. It is exact if f is injective, the kernel of g is the image of f and g is surjective. A longer exact sequence is defined in the similar way. A sequence of modules is exact if and only if it is exact as a sequence of abelian groups. Also the sequence is exact if and only if it is exact at all the maximal ideals:


 
  where the subscript 
 
 
 
  means the localization of a module at 
 
 
 
 .
Any module homomorphism f fits into


 
  where K is the kernel of f and C is the cokernel, the quotien of N by the image of f.
If 
 
 
 
  are module homomorphisms, then they are said to form a fiber square (or pullback square), denoted by M ×B N, if it fits into


 
  where 
 
 
 
 .
Example: Let 
 
 
 
  be commutative rings, and let I be the annihilator of the quotient B-module A/B (which is an ideal of A). Then canonical maps 
 
 
 
  form a fiber square with 
 
 

Endomorphisms of finitely generated modules
Let 
 
 
 
  be an endomorphism between finitely generated R-modules for a commutative ring R. Then



 
  is killed by its characteristic polynomial relative to the generators of M; see Nakayama's lemma#Proof.
If 
 
 
 
  is surjective, then it is injective.2

Additive relations
An additive relation

 
  from a module M to a module N is a submodule of 
 
 
3 In other words, it is a "many-valued" homomorphism defined on some submodule of M. The inverse 
 
 
 
  of f is the submodule 
 
 
 
 . Any additive relation f determines a homomorphism from a submodule of M to a quotient of N


 
  where 
 
 
 
  consists of all elements x in M such that (x, y) belongs to f for some y in N.
A transgression that arises from a spectral sequence is an example of an additive relation.
