   P-stable group      P-stable group   In finite group theory, a p-stable group for an odd prime p is a finite group satisfying a technical condition introduced by  in order to extend Thompson's uniqueness results in the odd order theorem to groups with dihedral Sylow 2-subgroups.  Definitions  There are several equivalent definitions of a p -stable group.   First definition.   We give definition of a p -stable group in two parts. The definition used here comes from .  1 . Let p be an odd prime and G be a finite group with a nontrivial p -core     O  p    (  G  )        subscript  O  p   G    O_{p}(G)   . Then G is p -stable if it satisfies the following condition: Let P be an arbitrary p -subgroup of G such that     O   p  ′     (  G  )        subscript  O   superscript  p  normal-′    G    O_{p^{\prime}}(G)   is a normal subgroup of G . Suppose that    x  ∈    N  G    (  P  )        x     subscript  N  G   P     x\in N_{G}(P)   and    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   is the coset of     C  G    (  P  )        subscript  C  G   P    C_{G}(P)   containing x . If     [  P  ,  x  ,  x  ]   =  1       P  x  x   1    [P,x,x]=1   , then     x  ¯   ∈    O  n    (      N  G    (  P  )    /   C  G     (  P  )    )         normal-¯  x      subscript  O  n          subscript  N  G   P    subscript  C  G    P      \overline{x}\in O_{n}(N_{G}(P)/C_{G}(P))   .  Now, define     ℳ  p    (  G  )        subscript  ℳ  p   G    \mathcal{M}_{p}(G)   as the set of all p -subgroups of G maximal with respect to the property that      O  p    (  M  )    ≠  1         subscript  O  p   M   1    O_{p}(M)\not=1   .  2 . Let G be a finite group and p an odd prime. Then G is called p -stable if every element of     ℳ  p    (  G  )        subscript  ℳ  p   G    \mathcal{M}_{p}(G)   is p -stable by definition 1 .   Second definition.   Let p be an odd prime and H a finite group. Then H is p -stable if      F  *    (  H  )    =    O  p    (  H  )           superscript  F    H      subscript  O  p   H     F^{*}(H)=O_{p}(H)   and, whenever P is a normal p -subgroup of H and    g  ∈  H      g  H    g\in H   with     [  P  ,  g  ,  g  ]   =  1       P  g  g   1    [P,g,g]=1   , then     g   C  H    (  P  )    ∈    O  p    (    H  /   C  H     (  P  )    )          g   subscript  C  H   P      subscript  O  p       H   subscript  C  H    P      gC_{H}(P)\in O_{p}(H/C_{H}(P))   .  Properties  If p is an odd prime and G is a finite group such that SL 2 ( p ) is not involved in G , then G is p -stable. If furthermore G contains a normal p -subgroup P such that      C  G    (  P  )    ⩽  P         subscript  C  G   P   P    C_{G}(P)\leqslant P   , then    Z   (    J  0    (  S  )    )       Z     subscript  J  0   S     Z(J_{0}(S))   is a characteristic subgroup of G , where     J  0    (  S  )        subscript  J  0   S    J_{0}(S)   is the subgroup introduced by John Thompson in .
