P-stable group

In finite group theory, a p-stable group for an odd prime p is a finite group satisfying a technical condition introduced by  in order to extend Thompson's uniqueness results in the odd order theorem to groups with dihedral Sylow 2-subgroups.
Definitions
There are several equivalent definitions of a p-stable group.

First definition.

We give definition of a p-stable group in two parts. The definition used here comes from .
1. Let p be an odd prime and G be a finite group with a nontrivial p-core 
 
 
 
 . Then G is p-stable if it satisfies the following condition: Let P be an arbitrary p-subgroup of G such that 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of G. Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the coset of 
 
 
 
  containing x. If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
Now, define 
 
 
 
  as the set of all p-subgroups of G maximal with respect to the property that 
 
 
 
 .
2. Let G be a finite group and p an odd prime. Then G is called p-stable if every element of 
 
 
 
  is p-stable by definition 1.

Second definition.

Let p be an odd prime and H a finite group. Then H is p-stable if 
 
 
 
  and, whenever P is a normal p-subgroup of H and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
If p is an odd prime and G is a finite group such that SL2(p) is not involved in G, then G is p-stable. If furthermore G contains a normal p-subgroup P such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a characteristic subgroup of G, where 
 
 
 
  is the subgroup introduced by John Thompson in .

p-stability is used as one of the conditions in Glauberman's ZJ theorem.
