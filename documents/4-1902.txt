   Elongated triangular bipyramid      Elongated triangular bipyramid   In geometry , the elongated triangular bipyramid (or dipyramid ) is one of the Johnson solids ( J 14 ), convex polyhedra whose faces are regular polygons . As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a triangular bipyramid ( J 12 ) by inserting a triangular prism between its congruent halves.  The nirrosula , an African musical instrument woven out of strips of plant leaves, is made in the form of a series of elongated bipyramids with non-equilateral triangles as the faces of their end caps. 1  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 2     V  =    (    1  12    (    2   2    +   3   3     )    )    a  3    ≈   0.668715...   a  3          V        1  12       2    2      3    3       superscript  a  3           0.668715...   superscript  a  3       V=(\frac{1}{12}(2\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}))a^{3}\approx 0.668715...a^{3}       A  =    (    3  2    (   2  +   3    )    )    a  2    ≈   5.59808...   a  2          A        3  2     2    3      superscript  a  2           5.59808...   superscript  a  2       A=(\frac{3}{2}(2+\sqrt{3}))a^{2}\approx 5.59808...a^{2}     Dual polyhedron  The dual of the elongated triangular bipyramid is called a triangular bifrustum and has 8 faces: 6 trapezoidal and 2 triangular.
