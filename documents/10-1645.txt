Galactose-6-phosphate isomerase




Galactose-6-phosphate isomerase

In enzymology, a galactose-6-phosphate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-galactose 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-tagatose 6-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-galactose 6-phosphate, and one product, D-tagatose 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-galactose-6-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism.
