The figure shows a perfect fluid interior region (gold) matched (with continuous metric and extrinsic curvature tensor) across a spherical surface (represented here as a circle) to a vacuum exterior region (khaki), which is a portion of the Schwarzschild vacuum solution.  In this example, the interior region is Schwarzschild's fluid, in which the hyperslices have the geometry of a three-spherical cap . In this example, the embedding is        z   (  r  )    =   10  -    125  -   r  2       ,   0  <  r  <  5      formulae-sequence      z  r     10      125   superscript  r  2           0  r       5      z(r)=10-\sqrt{125-r^{2}},\;0           z   (  r  )    =    -  4   +   2    r  -  1       ,   5  <  r  <  âˆž      formulae-sequence      z  r       4     2      r  1           5  r            z(r)=-4+2\sqrt{r-1},\;5     All static spherically symmetric stellar models resemble the Schwarzschild solution near the center, and are matched to a Schwarzschild vacuum exterior, but other choices of fluid solution for the interior region may differ from the geometry shown here in ways difficult to depict without restoring the suppressed dimension.
