Summary
This is an illustration of a three-dimensional hyperslice of a simple example of static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution, with one dimension suppressed, embedded in a flat euclidean spacetime for ease of visualizing the geometry.
The figure shows a perfect fluid interior region (gold) matched (with continuous metric and extrinsic curvature tensor) across a spherical surface (represented here as a circle) to a vacuum exterior region (khaki), which is a portion of the Schwarzschild vacuum solution.
In this example, the interior region is Schwarzschild's fluid, in which the hyperslices have the geometry of a three-spherical cap. In this example, the embedding is






All static spherically symmetric stellar models resemble the Schwarzschild solution near the center, and are matched to a Schwarzschild vacuum exterior, but other choices of fluid solution for the interior region may differ from the geometry shown here in ways difficult to depict without restoring the suppressed dimension.
