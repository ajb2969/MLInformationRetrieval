   Birch's theorem      Birch's theorem   In mathematics , Birch's theorem , 1 named for Bryan John Birch , is a statement about the representability of zero by odd degree forms.  Statement of Birch's theorem  Let K be an algebraic number field , k , l and n be natural numbers, r 1 , . . . , r k be odd natural numbers, and f 1 , . . . , f k be homogeneous polynomials with coefficients in K of degrees r 1 , . . . , r k respectively in n variables, then there exists a number ψ( r 1 , . . . , r k , l , K ) such that      n  ≥   ψ   (   r  1   ,  …  ,   r  k   ,  l  ,  K  )        n    ψ    subscript  r  1   normal-…   subscript  r  k   l  K      n\geq\psi(r_{1},\ldots,r_{k},l,K)   implies that there exists an l -dimensional vector subspace V of K n such that          f  1    (  x  )    =  ⋯  =    f  k    (  x  )    =  0   ,    ∀  x   ∈  V    .     formulae-sequence         subscript  f  1   x   normal-⋯          subscript  f  k   x        0       for-all  x   V     f_{1}(x)=\cdots=f_{k}(x)=0,\quad\forall x\in V.     Remarks  The proof of the theorem is by induction over the maximal degree of the forms f 1 , . . . , f k . Essential to the proof is a special case, which can be proved by an application of the Hardy–Littlewood circle method , of the theorem which states that if n is sufficiently large and r is odd, then the equation          c  1    x  1  r    +  ⋯  +    c  n    x  n  r     =  0   ,     c  i   ∈  ℤ   ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n        formulae-sequence         subscript  c  1    superscript   subscript  x  1   r    normal-⋯     subscript  c  n    superscript   subscript  x  n   r     0    formulae-sequence     subscript  c  i   ℤ     i   1  normal-…  n       c_{1}x_{1}^{r}+\cdots+c_{n}x_{n}^{r}=0,\quad c_{i}\in\mathbb{Z},i=1,\ldots,n     has a solution in integers x 1 , . . . , x n , not all of which are 0.  The restriction to odd r is necessary, since even-degree forms, such as positive definite quadratic forms , may take the value 0 only at the origin.
