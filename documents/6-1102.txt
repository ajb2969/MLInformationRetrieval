   Magnetic capacitivity      Magnetic capacitivity   Magnetic capacitivity ( SI Unit : H ) is a component used in the gyrator-capacitor model of magnetic systems.  This element, denoted as    C  M     subscript  C  M    C_{M}   , is an extensive property and is defined as:       C  M   =    μ  r    μ  0    S  l         subscript  C  M      subscript  μ  r    subscript  μ  0     S  l      C_{M}=\mu_{r}\mu_{0}\frac{S}{l}     Where:      μ  r    μ  0    =  μ         subscript  μ  r    subscript  μ  0    μ    \mu_{r}\mu_{0}=\mu   is the magnetic permeability ,   S   S   S   is the element cross-section, and   l   l   l   is the element length.  For phasor analysis , the magnetic permeability 1 and the magnetic capacitivity are complex values. 2 3  Magnetic capacitivity is also equal to magnetic flux divided by the difference of magnetic potential across the element.       C  M   =   Φ    ϕ   M  1    -   ϕ   M  2           subscript  C  M     normal-Φ     subscript  ϕ    M  1     subscript  ϕ    M  2        C_{M}=\frac{\Phi}{\phi_{M1}-\phi_{M2}}     Where:       ϕ   M  1    -   ϕ   M  2         subscript  ϕ    M  1     subscript  ϕ    M  2      \phi_{M1}-\phi_{M2}   is the difference of the magnetic potentials .  The notion of magnetic capacitivity is employed in the gyrator-capacitor model in a way analogous to capacitance in electrical circuits.
