   Fåhræus effect      Fåhræus effect   The Fåhræus effect is the decrease in average concentration of red blood cells in human blood as the diameter of the glass tube in which it is flowing decreases. In other words, in blood vessels with diameters less than 500 micrometers , both the hematocrit decreases with decreasing capillary diameter. The Fåhræus effect definitely influences the Fåhræus–Lindqvist effect , which describes the dependence of apparent viscosity of blood on the capillary size, but the former is not the only cause of the latter. 1  Mathematical model  Considering steady  laminar fully developed blood flow in a small tube with radius of    r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   , whole blood separates into a cell-free plasma layer along the tube wall and enriched central core. As a result, the tube hematocrit     H  t     subscript  H  t    H_{t}   is smaller than the out flow hematocrit    H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   . A simple mathematical treatment of the Fåhræus effect was shown in Sutera et al. (1970). 2 This seems to be the earliest analysis:        H  t    H  0    =   1   2  -    (   1  -   (   δ   r  0    )    )   2            subscript  H  t    subscript  H  0      1    2   superscript    1    δ   subscript  r  0     2       \frac{H_{t}}{H_{0}}=\frac{1}{2-(1-(\frac{\delta}{r_{0}}))^{2}}     where:      H  t     subscript  H  t    H_{t}   is the tube hematocrit      H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   is the outlet hematocrit     δ   δ   \delta   is the cell-free plasma layer thickness      r  0     subscript  r  0    r_{0}   is the radius of the tube  Also, the following expression was developed by Pries et al. (1990) 3 to represent tube hematocrit,    H  t     subscript  H  t    H_{t}   , as a function of discharge hematocrit ,    H  d     subscript  H  d    H_{d}   , and tube diameter.        H  t    H  d    =    H  d   +    (   1  -   H  d    )    (    1  +   1.7  e  x  p   (   -   0.415  D    )     -   0.6  e  x  p   (   -   0.011  D    )     )            subscript  H  t    subscript  H  d       subscript  H  d       1   subscript  H  d        1    1.7  e  x  p      0.415  D        0.6  e  x  p      0.011  D          \frac{H_{t}}{H_{d}}=H_{d}+(1-H_{d})(1+1.7exp(-0.415D)-0.6exp(-0.011D))     where:      H  t     subscript  H  t    H_{t}   is the tube hematocrit      H  d     subscript  H  d    H_{d}   is the discharge hematocrit     D   D   D   is the diameter of the tube in µm  Further reading   C.
