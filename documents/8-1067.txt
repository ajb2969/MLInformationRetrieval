Cubic form

In mathematics, a cubic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, and a cubic hypersurface is the zero set of a cubic form.
In , Boris Delone and Dmitriĭ Faddeev showed that binary cubic forms with integer coefficients can be used to parametrize orders in cubic fields. Their work was generalized in  to include all cubic rings,12 giving a discriminant-preserving bijection between orbits of a GL(2, Z)-action on the space of integral binary cubic forms and cubic rings up to isomorphism.
The classification of real cubic forms 
 
 
 
  is linked to the classification of umbilical points of surfaces. The equivalence classes of such cubics form a three-dimensional real projective space and the subset of parabolic forms define a surface – the umbilic torus or umbilic bracelet.3
Examples

A cubic ring is a ring that is isomorphic to Z3 as a Z-module.↩
In fact, Pierre Deligne pointed out that the correspondence works over an arbitrary scheme.↩
