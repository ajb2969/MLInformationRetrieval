   Cubic form      Cubic form   In mathematics , a cubic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 3, and a cubic hypersurface is the zero set of a cubic form.  In , Boris Delone and Dmitriĭ Faddeev showed that binary cubic forms with integer coefficients can be used to parametrize orders in cubic fields . Their work was generalized in  to include all cubic rings, 1 2 giving a discriminant -preserving bijection between orbits of a GL(2, Z )- action on the space of integral binary cubic forms and cubic rings up to isomorphism .

The equivalence classes of such cubics form a three-dimensional real projective space and the subset of parabolic forms define a surface – the umbilic torus or umbilic bracelet . 3  Examples   Elliptic curve  Fermat cubic  Cubic 3-fold  Koras–Russell cubic threefold  Klein cubic threefold  Segre cubic   Notes  References         "    Category:Multilinear algebra  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Algebraic varieties     A cubic ring is a ring that is isomorphic to Z 3 as a Z -module . ↩  In fact, Pierre Deligne pointed out that the correspondence works over an arbitrary scheme . ↩  ↩
