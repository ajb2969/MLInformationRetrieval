   Divided domain      Divided domain   In algebra , a divided domain is an integral domain  R in which every prime ideal    𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   satisfies    𝔭  =   𝔭   R  𝔭        𝔭    𝔭   subscript  R  𝔭      \mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{p}R_{\mathfrak{p}}   . A locally divided domain is an integral domain that is a divided domain at every maximal ideal . A Prüfer domain is a basic example of a locally divided domain. 1 Divided domains were introduced by  who called them AV-domains.
