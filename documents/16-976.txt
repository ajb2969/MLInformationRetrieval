   Discrete-stable distribution      Discrete-stable distribution   The discrete-stable distributions 1 are a class of probability distribution and are the discrete analogue of the continuous-stable distributions .  The discrete-stable distributions have been used in numerous fields, in particular in scale-free networks such as the internet , social networks 2 or even semantic networks 3  Both classes of distribution have properties such as infinitely divisibility , power law tails and unimodality .  The most well-known discrete stable distribution is the Poisson distribution which is a special case as the only discrete-stable distribution for which the mean and all higher-order moments are finite.  The distribution  The discrete-stable distributions are defined 4 through their moment-generating function :        Q   (  s  ,  ν  ,  a  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    P   (  N  ,  ν  ,  a  )     (   1  -  s   )   N     =   exp   (   -   a   s  ν     )     .          Q   s  ν  a      superscript   subscript     n  0        P   N  ν  a    superscript    1  s   N                a   superscript  s  ν         Q(s,\nu,a)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}P(N,\nu,a)(1-s)^{N}=\exp(-as^{\nu}).     In the above,    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   is a scale parameter and    0  <  ν  ≤  1        0  ν       1     0<\nu\leq 1   describes the power-law behaviour such that when    0  <  ν  <  1        0  ν       1     0<\nu<1   ,         lim   N  →  ∞     P   (  N  ,  ν  ,  a  )     ∼   1   N   ν  +  1      .     similar-to    subscript    normal-→  N       P   N  ν  a       1   superscript  N    ν  1       \lim_{N\to\infty}P(N,\nu,a)\sim\frac{1}{N^{\nu+1}}.     When    ν  =  1      ν  1    \nu=1   the distribution becomes the familiar Poisson distribution with mean   a   a   a   .  The original distribution is recovered through repeated differentiation of the generating function:        P   (  N  ,  ν  ,  a  )    =        (   -  1   )   N    N  !       d  N   Q   (  s  ,  ν  ,  a  )     d   s  N      |    s  =  1     .        P   N  ν  a     evaluated-at       superscript    1   N     N         superscript  d  N   Q   s  ν  a      d   superscript  s  N        s  1      P(N,\nu,a)=\left.\frac{(-1)^{N}}{N!}\frac{d^{N}Q(s,\nu,a)}{ds^{N}}\right|_{s=1}.     A closed-form expression using elementary functions for the probability distribution of the discrete-stable distributions is not known except for in the Poisson case, in which       P    (  N  ;  ν  =  1  ,  a  )   =     a  N    e   -  a      N  !    .     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N  normal-;  ν   1  normal-,  a  normal-)         superscript  a  N    superscript  e    a       N    normal-.    \!P(N;\nu=1,a)=\frac{a^{N}e^{-a}}{N!}.     Expressions do exist, however, using special functions for the case    ν  =   1  /  2       ν    1  2     \nu=1/2    5 (in terms of Bessel functions ) and    ν  =   1  /  3       ν    1  3     \nu=1/3    6 (in terms of hypergeometric functions ).  As compound probability distributions  The entire class of discrete-stable distributions can be formed as compound probability distributions where the mean,   a   a   a   , of a Poisson distribution is defined as a probability density function (PDF). When the PDF of the mean is a one-sided continuous- stable distribution with stability parameter    0  <  α  <  1        0  α       1     0<\alpha<1   and scale parameter   c   c   c   the resultant distribution is 7 discrete-stable with index    ν  =  α      ν  α    \nu=\alpha   and scale parameter    a  =   c   sec   (    π  α   /  2   )         a    c        π  α   2       a=c\sec(\pi\alpha/2)   .  Formally, this is written:       P   (  N  ,  α  ,   c   sec   (    π  α   /  2   )     )    =    ∫  0  ∞    P   (  N  ,  1  ,  a  )   p   (  a  ,  α  ,  1  ,  c  ,  0  )   d  a          P   N  α    c        π  α   2         superscript   subscript   0       P   N  1  a   p   a  α  1  c  0   d  a      P(N,\alpha,c\sec(\pi\alpha/2))=\int_{0}^{\infty}P(N,1,a)p(a,\alpha,1,c,0)\,da     where    p   (  a  ,  α  ,  1  ,  c  ,  0  )       p   a  α  1  c  0     p(a,\alpha,1,c,0)   is the pdf of a one-sided continuous-stable distribution with symmetry parameter    β  =  1      β  1    \beta=1   and location parameter    μ  =  0      μ  0    \mu=0   .  A more general result 8 states that forming a compound distribution from any discrete-stable distribution with index   ν   ν   \nu   with a one-sided continuous-stable distribution with index   α   α   \alpha   results in a discrete-stable distribution with index    ν  ⋅  α     normal-⋅  ν  α    \nu\cdot\alpha   , reducing the power-law index of the original distribution by a factor of   α   α   \alpha   .  In other words,      P   (  N  ,  ν  ⋅  α  ,  c  sec   (  π  α  /  2  )   =   ∫  0  ∞   P   (  N  ,  α  ,  a  )   p   (  a  ,  ν  ,  1  ,  c  ,  0  )   d  a  .      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N  normal-,  ν  normal-⋅  α  normal-,  c    fragments  normal-(  π  α   2  normal-)     superscript   subscript   0     P   fragments  normal-(  N  normal-,  α  normal-,  a  normal-)   p   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-,  ν  normal-,  1  normal-,  c  normal-,  0  normal-)   d  a  normal-.     P(N,\nu\cdot\alpha,c\sec(\pi\alpha/2)=\int_{0}^{\infty}P(N,\alpha,a)p(a,\nu,1,%

In the Poisson limit  In the limit    ν  →  1     normal-→  ν  1    \nu\rightarrow 1   , the discrete-stable distributions behave 9 like a Poisson distribution with mean    a   sec   (    π  ν   /  2   )        a        π  ν   2      a\sec(\pi\nu/2)   for small   N   N   N   , however for    N  ≫  1     much-greater-than  N  1    N\gg 1   , the power-law tail dominates.  The convergence of i.i.d. random variates with power-law tails     P   (  N  )    ∼   1  /   N   1  +  ν        similar-to    P  N     1   superscript  N    1  ν       P(N)\sim 1/N^{1+\nu}   to a discrete-stable distribution is extraordinarily slow 10 when    ν  ≈  1      ν  1    \nu\approx 1   - the limit being the Poisson distribution when    ν  >  1      ν  1    \nu>1   and    P   (  N  ,  ν  ,  a  )       P   N  ν  a     P(N,\nu,a)   when    ν  ≤  1      ν  1    \nu\leq 1   .
