   Wirtinger's representation and projection theorem      Wirtinger's representation and projection theorem   In mathematics, Wirtinger's representation and projection theorem is a theorem proved by Wilhelm Wirtinger in 1932 in connection with some problems of approximation theory . This theorem gives the representation formula for the holomorphic  subspace     H  2     subscript  H  2    \left.\right.H_{2}   of the simple, unweighted holomorphic Hilbert space     L  2     superscript  L  2    \left.\right.L^{2}   of functions square-integrable over the surface of the unit disc    {  z  :    |  z  |   <  1   }     conditional-set  z      z   1     \left.\right.\{z:|z|<1\}   of the complex plane , along with a form of the orthogonal projection from    L  2     superscript  L  2    \left.\right.L^{2}   to    H  2     subscript  H  2    \left.\right.H_{2}   .  Wirtinger's paper 1 contains the following theorem presented also in Joseph L. Walsh 's well-known monograph 2 (p. 150) with a different proof. If     F   (  z  )       F  z    \left.\right.\left.F(z)\right.    is of the class     L  2     superscript  L  2    \left.\right.L^{2}   on     |  z  |   <  1        z   1    \left.\right.|z|<1   , ''i.e.         ∬    |  z  |   <  1        |   F   (  z  )    |   2    d  S    <   +  ∞    ,        subscript  double-integral      z   1       superscript      F  z    2   d  S          \iint_{|z|<1}|F(z)|^{2}\,dS<+\infty,     where    d  S      d  S    \left.\right.dS   is the area element , then the unique function    f   (  z  )       f  z    \left.\right.f(z)   of the holomorphic subclass     H  2   ⊂   L  2        subscript  H  2    superscript  L  2     H_{2}\subset L^{2}   , such that       ∬    |  z  |   <  1        |    F   (  z  )    -   f   (  z  )     |   2    d  S       subscript  double-integral      z   1       superscript        F  z     f  z     2   d  S     \iint_{|z|<1}|F(z)-f(z)|^{2}\,dS     ''is least, is given by        f   (  z  )    =    1  π     ∬    |  ζ  |   <  1     F   (  ζ  )     d  S     (   1  -    ζ  ¯   z    )   2        ,    |  z  |   <  1.      formulae-sequence      f  z       1  π     subscript  double-integral      ζ   1      F  ζ      d  S    superscript    1     normal-¯  ζ   z    2            z   1.     f(z)=\frac{1}{\pi}\iint_{|\zeta|<1}F(\zeta)\frac{dS}{(1-\overline{\zeta}z)^{2}%
 },\quad|z|<1.     The last formula gives a form for the orthogonal projection from    L  2     superscript  L  2    \left.\right.L^{2}   to    H  2     subscript  H  2    \left.\right.H_{2}   . Besides, replacement of    F   (  ζ  )       F  ζ    \left.\right.F(\zeta)   by    f   (  ζ  )       f  ζ    \left.\right.f(\zeta)   makes it Wirtinger's representation for all     f   (  z  )    ∈   H  2         f  z    subscript  H  2     f(z)\in H_{2}   . This is an analog of the well-known Cauchy integral formula with the square of the Cauchy kernel. Later, after the 1950s, a degree of the Cauchy kernel was called reproducing kernel , and the notation    A  0  2     subscript   superscript  A  2   0    \left.\right.A^{2}_{0}   became common for the class    H  2     subscript  H  2    \left.\right.H_{2}   .  In 1948 Mkhitar Djrbashian 3 extended Wirtinger's representation and projection to the wider, weighted Hilbert spaces    A  α  2     subscript   superscript  A  2   α    \left.\right.A^{2}_{\alpha}   of functions    f   (  z  )       f  z    \left.\right.f(z)   holomorphic in     |  z  |   <  1        z   1    \left.\right.|z|<1   , which satisfy the condition         ∥  f  ∥    A  α  2    =    {    1  π     ∬    |  z  |   <  1       |   f   (  z  )    |   2      (   1  -    |  z  |   2    )    α  -  1     d  S     }    1  /  2    <   +   ∞  for some  α    ∈   (  0  ,   +  ∞   )    ,         subscript   norm  f    subscript   superscript  A  2   α     superscript       1  π     subscript  double-integral      z   1       superscript      f  z    2    superscript    1   superscript    z   2      α  1    d  S        1  2              for some  α          0          \|f\|_{A^{2}_{\alpha}}=\left\{\frac{1}{\pi}\iint_{|z|<1}|f(z)|^{2}(1-|z|^{2})^%
 {\alpha-1}\,dS\right\}^{1/2}<+\infty\text{ for some }\alpha\in(0,+\infty),     and also to some Hilbert spaces of entire functions. The extensions of these results to some weighted    A  ω  2     subscript   superscript  A  2   ω    \left.\right.A^{2}_{\omega}   spaces of functions holomorphic in     |  z  |   <  1        z   1    \left.\right.|z|<1   and similar spaces of entire functions, the unions of which respectively coincide with all functions holomorphic in     |  z  |   <  1        z   1    \left.\right.|z|<1   and the whole set of entire functions can be seen in. 4  See also     References  "  Category:Theorems in complex analysis  Category:Theorems in functional analysis  Category:Theorems in approximation theory     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
