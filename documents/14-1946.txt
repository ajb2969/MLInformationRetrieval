Recession cone

In mathematics, especially convex analysis, the recession cone of a set 
 
 
 
  is a cone containing all vectors such that 
 
 
recedes in that direction. That is, the set extends outward in all the directions given by the recession cone.1
Mathematical definition
Given a nonempty set 
 
 
 
  for some vector space X, then the recession cone 
 
 
 
  is given by

If 
 
 
 
  is additionally a convex set then the recession cone can equivalently be defined by

If 
 
 
 
  is a nonempty closed convex set then the recession cone can equivalently be defined as


 
  for any choice of

Properties

For any nonempty set 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 .
For any nonempty convex set 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is a convex cone.5
For any nonempty closed convex set 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a finite-dimensional Hausdorff space (e.g. 
 
 
 
 ), then 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is bounded.67
For any nonempty set 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  where the sum is given by Minkowski addition.

Relation to asymptotic cone
The asymptotic cone for 
 
 
 
  is defined by


89
By the definition it can easily be shown that 
 
 
10
In a finite-dimensional space, then it can be shown that 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is nonempty, closed and convex.11 In infinite-dimensional spaces, then the relation between asymptotic cones and recession cones is more complicated, with properties for their equivalence summarized in.12
Sum of closed sets

Dieudonné's theorem: Let nonempty closed convex sets 
 
 
 
  a locally convex space, if either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is locally compact and 
 
 
 
  is a linear subspace, then 
 
 
 
  is closed.1314
Let nonempty closed convex sets 
 
 
 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is closed.1516
