Grothendieck local duality

In commutative algebra, Grothendieck local duality is a duality theorem for cohomology of modules over local rings, analogous to Serre duality of coherent sheaves.
Statement
Suppose that R is a Cohen–Macaulay local ring of dimension d with maximal ideal m and residue field k = R/m. Let E(k) be a Matlis module, an injective hull of k, and let 
 
 
 
  be the completion of its dualizing module. Then for any R-module M there is an isomorphism of modules over the completion of R:



where Hm is a local cohomology group.
There is a generalization to Noetherian local rings that are not Cohen–Macaulay, that replaces the dualizing module with a dualizing complex.
