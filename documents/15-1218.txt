   Grothendieck local duality      Grothendieck local duality   In commutative algebra , Grothendieck local duality is a duality theorem for cohomology of modules over local rings , analogous to Serre duality of coherent sheaves .  Statement  Suppose that R is a Cohen–Macaulay local ring of dimension d with maximal ideal m and residue field k = R / m . Let E ( k ) be a Matlis module , an injective hull of k , and let    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   be the completion of its dualizing module . Then for any R -module M there is an isomorphism of modules over the completion of R :        Ext  R  i    (  M  ,   Ω  ¯   )    ≅    Hom  R    (    H  m   d  -  i     (  M  )    ,   E   (  k  )    )          superscript   subscript  Ext  R   i   M   normal-¯  normal-Ω      subscript  Hom  R      superscript   subscript  H  m     d  i    M     E  k      \operatorname{Ext}_{R}^{i}(M,\overline{\Omega})\cong\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(H_{%
 m}^{d-i}(M),E(k))     where H m is a local cohomology group.  There is a generalization to Noetherian local rings that are not Cohen–Macaulay, that replaces the dualizing module with a dualizing complex .
