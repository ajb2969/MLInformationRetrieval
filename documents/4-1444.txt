   Smooth number      Smooth number   In number theory , a smooth (or friable) number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers . The term seems to have been coined by Leonard Adleman . 1 Smooth numbers are especially important in cryptography relying on factorization. The 2-smooth numbers are just the powers of 2 .  Definition  A positive  integer is called B - smooth if none of its prime factors is greater than B . For example, 1,620 has prime factorization 2 2 × 3 4 × 5; therefore 1,620 is 5-smooth because none of its prime factors are greater than 5. This definition includes numbers that lack some of the smaller prime factors; for example, both 10 and 12 are 5-smooth, despite the fact that they miss out prime factors 3 and 5 respectively. 5-smooth numbers are also called regular numbers or Hamming numbers ; 7-smooth numbers are also called humble , and sometimes called highly composite [ http://oeis.org/search?q=humble+number&sort; ;=&language;=&go;=Search], although this conflicts with another meaning of that term .  Note that B does not have to be a prime factor. If the largest prime factor of a number is p then the number is B -smooth for any B ≥ p . Usually B is given as a prime, but composite numbers work as well. A number is B -smooth if and only if it is p -smooth, where p is the largest prime less than or equal to B .  Applications  An important practical application of smooth numbers is for fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms such as the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm that operate by recursively breaking down a problem of a given size n into problems the size of its factors. By using B -smooth numbers, one ensures that the base cases of this recursion are small primes, for which efficient algorithms exist. (Large prime sizes require less-efficient algorithms such as Bluestein's FFT algorithm .)  5-smooth or regular numbers play a special role in Babylonian mathematics . 2 They are also important in music theory , 3 (see Limit (music) ) and the problem of generating these numbers efficiently has been used as a test problem for functional programming . 4  Smooth numbers have a number of applications to cryptography. 5 Although most applications involve cryptanalysis (e.g. the fastest known integer factorization algorithms), the VSH hash function is one example of a constructive use of smoothness to obtain a provably secure design .  Distribution  Let    Ψ   (  x  ,  y  )       normal-Ψ   x  y     \scriptstyle\Psi(x,y)   denote the number of y -smooth integers less than or equal to x (the de Bruijn function).  If the smoothness bound B is fixed and small, there is a good estimate for    Ψ   (  x  ,  B  )       normal-Ψ   x  B     \scriptstyle\Psi(x,B)   :        Ψ   (  x  ,  B  )    ∼    1   π    (  B  )   !       ∏   p  ≤  B      log  x    log  p       .     similar-to    normal-Ψ   x  B        1    π    B       subscript  product    p  B        x     p        \Psi(x,B)\sim\frac{1}{\pi(B)!}\prod_{p\leq B}\frac{\log x}{\log p}.     where    π   (  B  )       π  B    \scriptstyle{\pi(B)}   denotes the number of primes less than or equal to   B   B   \scriptstyle B   .  Otherwise, define the parameter u as u = log x / log y : that is, x = y u . Then,       Ψ   (  x  ,  y  )    =     x  ⋅  ρ    (  u  )    +   O   (   x   log  y    )           normal-Ψ   x  y         normal-⋅  x  ρ   u     O    x    y        \Psi(x,y)=x\cdot\rho(u)+O\left(\frac{x}{\log y}\right)     where    ρ   (  u  )       ρ  u    \scriptstyle\rho(u)   is the Dickman function .  Powersmooth numbers  Further, m is called B - powersmooth (or B - ultrafriable ) if all prime powers     p  ν     superscript  p  ν    \scriptstyle p^{\nu}   dividing m satisfy:        p  ν   ≤  B   .       superscript  p  ν   B    p^{\nu}\leq B.\,     For example, 2 4 3 2 5 1 is 5-smooth but is not 5-powersmooth (because there are several prime powers greater than 5, e.g. ,     3  2   =  9  ≰  5         superscript  3  2   9    not-less-than-nor-greater-than    5     3^{2}=9\nleq 5   or     2  3   >  5       superscript  2  3   5    2^{3}>5   ). It is 16-powersmooth since its greatest prime factor power is 2 4 = 16. The number is also 17-powersmooth, 18-powersmooth, etc.  B -smooth and B -powersmooth numbers have applications in number theory, such as in Pollard's p − 1 algorithm . Such applications are often said to work with "smooth numbers," with no B specified; this means the numbers involved must be B -powersmooth for some unspecified small number B ; as B increases, the performance of the algorithm or method in question degrades rapidly. For example, the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm for computing discrete logarithms has a running time of O ( B 1/2 ) for groups of B -smooth order.
