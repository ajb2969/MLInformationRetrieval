   Rate of infusion      Rate of infusion   In pharmacokinetics , the rate of infusion (or dosing rate ) refers not just to the rate at which a drug is administered, but the desired rate at which a drug should be administered to achieve a steady state of a fixed dose which has been demonstrated to be therapeutically effective.  Abbreviations include K in , 1 K 0 , 2 or R 0 .  It can be calculated as the steady-state concentration in the plasma multiplied by the clearance :       K   i  n    =     C   s  s    ⋅  C   L        subscript  K    i  n       normal-⋅   subscript  C    s  s    C   L     \textstyle K_{in}=C_{ss}\cdot CL     References  "  Category:Pharmacology  Infusion     ↩  ↩
