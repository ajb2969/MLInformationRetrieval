   Endopolyphosphatase      Endopolyphosphatase   In enzymology , an endopolyphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   polyphosphate + n H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (n + 1) oligophosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are polyphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is oligophosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is polyphosphate polyphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include polyphosphate depolymerase , metaphosphatase , polyphosphatase , and polymetaphosphatase .
