(R)-dehydropantoate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a (R)-dehydropantoate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-4-dehydropantoate + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-4-dehydropantoate, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-4-dehydropantoate:NAD+ 4-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include D-aldopantoate dehydrogenase, D-2-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-3-formylpropionate:diphosphopyridine, and nucleotide (DPN+) oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.
