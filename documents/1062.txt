   Powerful number      Powerful number   A powerful number is a positive integer  m such that for every prime number  p dividing m , p 2 also divides m . Equivalently, a powerful number is the product of a square and a cube , that is, a number m of the form m = a 2 b 3 , where a and b are positive integers. Powerful numbers are also known as squareful , square-full , or 2-full . Paul Erdős and George Szekeres studied such numbers and Solomon W. Golomb named such numbers powerful .  The following is a list of all powerful numbers between 1 and 1000:   1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100, 108, 121, 125, 128, 144, 169, 196, 200, 216, 225, 243, 256, 288, 289, 324, 343, 361, 392, 400, 432, 441, 484, 500, 512, 529, 576, 625, 648, 675, 676, 729, 784, 800, 841, 864, 900, 961, 968, 972, 1000, ... .   Equivalence of the two definitions  If m = a 2 b 3 , then every prime in the prime factorization of a appears in the prime factorization of m with an exponent of at least two, and every prime in the prime factorization of b appears in the prime factorization of m with an exponent of at least three; therefore, m is powerful.  In the other direction, suppose that m is powerful, with prime factorization       m  =   ∏   p  i   α  i      ,      m   product   superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  α  i       m=\prod p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}},   where each α i ≥ 2. Define γ i to be three if α i is odd, and zero otherwise, and define β i = α i - γ i . Then, all values β i are nonnegative even integers, and all values γ i are either zero or three, so      m  =    (   ∏   p  i   β  i     )    (   ∏   p  i   γ  i     )    =     (   ∏   p  i    β  i   /  2     )   2     (   ∏   p  i    γ  i   /  3     )   3          m     product   superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  β  i      product   superscript   subscript  p  i    subscript  γ  i              superscript   product   superscript   subscript  p  i      subscript  β  i   2     2    superscript   product   superscript   subscript  p  i      subscript  γ  i   3     3       m=(\prod p_{i}^{\beta_{i}})(\prod p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}})=(\prod p_{i}^{\beta_{i}/%
 2})^{2}(\prod p_{i}^{\gamma_{i}/3})^{3}   supplies the desired representation of m as a product of a square and a cube.  Informally, given the prime factorization of m , take b to be the product of the prime factors of m that have an odd exponent (if there are none, then take b to be 1). Because m is powerful, each prime factor with an odd exponent has an exponent that is at least 3, so m / b 3 is an integer. In addition, each prime factor of m / b 3 has an even exponent, so m / b 3 is a perfect square, so call this a 2 ; then m = a 2 b 3 . For example:      m  =  21600  =    2  5   ×   3  3   ×    5  2      ,        m  21600          superscript  2  5    superscript  3  3    superscript  5  2       m=21600=2^{5}\times 3^{3}\times 5^{2}\,,          b  =   2  ×  3   =   6    ,        b    2  3        6     b=2\times 3=6\,,          a  =    m   b  3     =     2  2   ×   5  2     =   10    ,        a      m   superscript  b  3               superscript  2  2    superscript  5  2          10     a=\sqrt{\frac{m}{b^{3}}}=\sqrt{2^{2}\times 5^{2}}=10\,,          m  =    a  2    b  3    =    10  2   ×    6  3      .        m     superscript  a  2    superscript  b  3            superscript  10  2    superscript  6  3       m=a^{2}b^{3}=10^{2}\times 6^{3}\,.     The representation m = a 2 b 3 calculated in this way has the property that b is squarefree , and is uniquely defined by this property.  Mathematical properties  The Dirichlet series generating function for powerful numbers is       ζ   (   2  s   )   ζ   (   3  s   )     ζ   (   6  s   )          ζ    2  s   ζ    3  s      ζ    6  s      \frac{\zeta(2s)\zeta(3s)}{\zeta(6s)}     and so the sum of reciprocals of powerful numbers converges to         ∏  p    (   1  +   1   p   (   p  -  1   )      )    =    ζ   (  2  )   ζ   (  3  )     ζ   (  6  )     =    315   2   π  4     ζ   (  3  )     ,          subscript  product  p     1    1    p    p  1           ζ  2  ζ  3     ζ  6             315    2   superscript  π  4     ζ  3      \prod_{p}\left(1+\frac{1}{p(p-1)}\right)=\frac{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}{\zeta(6)}=%
 \frac{315}{2\pi^{4}}\zeta(3),     where p runs over all primes, ζ( s ) denotes the Riemann zeta function , and ζ(3) is Apéry's constant (Golomb, 1970).  Let k ( x ) denote the number of powerful numbers in the interval [1, x ]. Then k ( x ) is proportional to the square root of x . More precisely,         c   x   1  /  2     -   3   x   1  /  3      ≤   k   (  x  )    ≤   c   x   1  /  2      ,   c  =     ζ   (   3  /  2   )    /  ζ    (  3  )    =   2.173  ⋯       formulae-sequence          c   superscript  x    1  2       3   superscript  x    1  3        k  x          c   superscript  x    1  2           c        ζ    3  2    ζ   3          2.173  normal-⋯       cx^{1/2}-3x^{1/3}\leq k(x)\leq cx^{1/2},c=\zeta(3/2)/\zeta(3)=2.173\cdots     (Golomb, 1970).  The two smallest consecutive powerful numbers are 8 and 9. Since Pell's equation  x 2 − 8 y 2 = 1 has infinitely many integral solutions, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers (Golomb, 1970); more generally, one can find consecutive powerful numbers by solving a similar Pell equation x 2 − ny 2 = ±1 for any perfect cube  n . However, one of the two powerful numbers in a pair formed in this way must be a square. According to Guy, Erdős has asked whether there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers such as (23 3 , 2 3 3 2 13 2 ) in which neither number in the pair is a square. Jaroslaw Wroblewski showed that there are indeed infinitely many such pairs by showing that 3 3 c 2 +1=7 3 d 2 has infinitely many solutions. It is a conjecture of Erdős, Mollin, and Walsh that there are no three consecutive powerful numbers.  Sums and differences of powerful numbers  Any odd number is a difference of two consecutive squares: ( k + 1) 2 = k 2 + 2k +1 2 , so ( k + 1) 2 - k 2 = 2 k + 1. Similarly, any multiple of four is a difference of the squares of two numbers that differ by two: ( k + 2) 2 - k 2 = 4 k + 4. However, a singly even number , that is, a number divisible by two but not by four, cannot be expressed as a difference of squares. This motivates the question of determining which singly even numbers can be expressed as differences of powerful numbers. Golomb exhibited some representations of this type:   2 = 3 3 − 5 2   10 = 13 3 − 3 7   18 = 19 2 − 7 3 = 3 2 (3 3 − 5 2 ).   It had been conjectured that 6 cannot be so represented, and Golomb conjectured that there are infinitely many integers which cannot be represented as a difference between two powerful numbers. However, Narkiewicz showed that 6 can be so represented in infinitely many ways such as   6 = 5 4 7 3 − 463 2 ,   and McDaniel showed that every integer has infinitely many such representations (McDaniel, 1982).  Erdős conjectured that every sufficiently large integer is a sum of at most three powerful numbers; this was proved by Roger Heath-Brown (1987).  Generalization  More generally, we can consider the integers all of whose prime factors have exponents at least k . Such an integer is called a k -powerful number, k -ful number, or k -full number.   (2 k +1 − 1) k ,  2 k (2 k +1 − 1) k ,   (2 k +1 − 1) k +1    are k -powerful numbers in an arithmetic progression . Moreover, if a 1 , a 2 , ..., a s are k -powerful in an arithmetic progression with common difference d , then   a 1 ( a s + d ) k ,   a 2 ( a s + d ) k , ..., a s ( a s + d ) k , ( a s + d) k +1  are s + 1 k -powerful numbers in an arithmetic progression.  We have an identity involving k -powerful numbers:   a k ( a l + ... + 1) k + a k + 1 ( a l + ... + 1) k + ... + a k + l ( a l + ... + 1) k = a k ( a l + ... +1) k +1 .   This gives infinitely many l +1-tuples of k -powerful numbers whose sum is also k -powerful. Nitaj shows there are infinitely many solutions of x + y = z in relatively prime 3-powerful numbers(Nitaj, 1995). Cohn constructs an infinite family of solutions of x + y = z in relatively prime non-cube 3-powerful numbers as follows: the triplet   X = 9712247684771506604963490444281, Y = 32295800804958334401937923416351, Z = 27474621855216870941749052236511   is a solution of the equation 32 X 3 + 49 Y 3 = 81 Z 3 . We can construct another solution by setting X ′ = X (49 Y 3 + 81 Z 3 ), Y ′ = − Y (32 X 3 + 81 Z 3 ), Z ′ = Z (32 X 3 − 49 Y 3 ) and omitting the common divisor.
