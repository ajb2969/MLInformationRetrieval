Secondary polynomials

In mathematics, the secondary polynomials

 
  associated with a sequence

 
  of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a density 
 
 
 
  are defined by



To see that the functions 
 
 
 
  are indeed polynomials, consider the simple example of 
 
 
 
  Then,



which is a polynomial 
 
 
 
  provided that the three integrals in 
 
 
 
  (the moments of the density 
 
 
 
 ) are convergent.
