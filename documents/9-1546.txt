   Secondary polynomials      Secondary polynomials   In mathematics, the secondary polynomials     {    q  n    (  x  )    }        subscript  q  n   x     \{q_{n}(x)\}   associated with a sequence     {    p  n    (  x  )    }        subscript  p  n   x     \{p_{n}(x)\}   of polynomials  orthogonal with respect to a density    ρ   (  x  )       ρ  x    \rho(x)   are defined by         q  n    (  x  )    =     ∫  ℝ         p  n    (  t  )    -    p  n    (  x  )      t  -  x    ρ   (  t  )   d  t     .         subscript  q  n   x     subscript   ℝ            subscript  p  n   t      subscript  p  n   x      t  x    ρ  t  d  t      q_{n}(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\!\frac{p_{n}(t)-p_{n}(x)}{t-x}\rho(t)\,dt.     To see that the functions     q  n    (  x  )        subscript  q  n   x    q_{n}(x)   are indeed polynomials, consider the simple example of       p  0    (  x  )    =   x  3    .         subscript  p  0   x    superscript  x  3     p_{0}(x)=x^{3}.   Then,       q  0    (  x  )        subscript  q  0   x    \displaystyle q_{0}(x)     which is a polynomial   x   x   x   provided that the three integrals in   t   t   t   (the moments of the density   ρ   ρ   \rho   ) are convergent.
