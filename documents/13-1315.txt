   Malcev Lie algebra      Malcev Lie algebra   In mathematics, a Malcev Lie algebra , or Mal'tsev Lie algebra , is a generalization of a rational nilpotent Lie algebra , and Malcev groups are similar. Both were introduced by , based on the work of .  According to  a Malcev Lie algebra is a rational Lie algebra   L   L   L   together with a complete, descending   ℚ   ℚ   {\mathbb{Q}}   -vector space filtration     {    F  r   L   }    r  ≥  1      subscript      subscript  F  r   L      r  1     \{F_{r}L\}_{r\geq 1}   , such that:         F  1   L   =  L         subscript  F  1   L   L    F_{1}L=L          [    F  r   L   ,    F  s   L   ]   ⊂    F   r  +  s    L           subscript  F  r   L      subscript  F  s   L       subscript  F    r  s    L     [F_{r}L,F_{s}L]\subset F_{r+s}L     the associated graded Lie algebra     ⊕   r  ≥  1        F  r   L   /   F   r  +  1     L       subscript  direct-sum    r  1           subscript  F  r   L    subscript  F    r  1     L     \oplus_{r\geq 1}F_{r}L/F_{r+1}L   is generated by elements of degree one.   Malcev Lie algebras come up, e.g., in the theory of mixed Hodge structures .  References       "  Category:Hodge theory  Category:Lie algebras
