Malcev Lie algebra

In mathematics, a Malcev Lie algebra, or Mal'tsev Lie algebra, is a generalization of a rational nilpotent Lie algebra, and Malcev groups are similar. Both were introduced by , based on the work of .
According to  a Malcev Lie algebra is a rational Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  together with a complete, descending 
 
 
 
 -vector space filtration 
 
 
 
 , such that:







the associated graded Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  is generated by elements of degree one.

Malcev Lie algebras come up, e.g., in the theory of mixed Hodge structures.
