   Saturation current      Saturation current   The saturation current or, more accurately, the reverse saturation current is that part of the reverse current in a semiconductor  diode caused by diffusion of minority carriers from the neutral regions to the depletion region . This current is almost independent of the reverse voltage. (Steadman 1993, 459)  I S , the reverse bias saturation current for an ideal p–n diode is given by (Schubert 2006, 61):        I  S   =   e  A   (       D  p    τ  p       n  i  2    N  D     +      D  n    τ  n       n  i  2    N  A      )     ,       subscript  I  normal-S     e  A           subscript  D  normal-p    subscript  τ  normal-p        superscript   subscript  n  normal-i   2    subscript  N  normal-D            subscript  D  normal-n    subscript  τ  normal-n        superscript   subscript  n  normal-i   2    subscript  N  normal-A         I_{\mathrm{S}}=eA\left(\sqrt{\frac{D_{\mathrm{p}}}{\tau_{\mathrm{p}}}}\frac{n_%
 {\mathrm{i}}^{2}}{N_{\mathrm{D}}}+\sqrt{\frac{D_{\mathrm{n}}}{\tau_{\mathrm{n}%
 }}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{i}}^{2}}{N_{\mathrm{A}}}\right),\,     where   I S is the reverse bias saturation current,  e is elementary charge   A is the cross-sectional area  D p,n are the diffusion coefficients of holes and electrons, respectively,  N D,A are the donor and acceptor concentrations at the n side and p side, respectively,  n i is the intrinsic carrier concentration in the semiconductor material,      τ   p  ,  n      subscript  τ   normal-p  normal-n     \tau_{\mathrm{p,n}}   are the carrier lifetimes of holes and electrons, respectively.   Note that the saturation current is not a constant for a given device; it varies with temperature; this variance is the dominant term in the temperature coefficient for a diode. A common rule of thumb is that it doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature. (Bogart 1986, 40)  References   Steadman, J. W. (1993). "Electronics" in R. C. Dorf, The Electrical Engineering Handbook.
