Schwarz integral formula

In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Schwarz integral formula, named after Hermann Schwarz, allows one to recover a holomorphic function, up to an imaginary constant, from the boundary values of its real part.
Unit disc
Let ƒ = u + iv be a function which is holomorphic on the closed unit disc {z ∈ C | |z| ≤ 1}. Then



for all |z|  0, |zα ƒ(z)| is bounded on the closed upper half-plane. Then



for all Im(z) > 0.
Note that, as compared to the version on the unit disc, this formula does not have an arbitrary constant added to the integral; this is because the additional decay condition makes the conditions for this formula more stringent.
Corollary of Poisson integral formula
The formula follows from Poisson integral formula applied to u:12



By means of conformal maps, the formula can be generalized to any simply connected open set.
