Complete topological space

In mathematics, if a topological space $X$ is said to be complete, it may mean:

that $X$ has been equipped with an additional Cauchy space structure which is complete,
 
e. g., that it is a complete uniform space with respect to an aforementioned uniformity,
 
e. g., that it is a complete metric space with respect to an aforementioned metric;


or that $X$ has some topological property related to the above:
 
that it is completely metrizable (often called (metrically) topologically complete),
or that it is Čech-complete (a property coinciding with completely metrizability on the class of metrizable spaces, but including some non-metrizable spaces as well),
or that it is completely uniformizable (also called topologically complete or Dieudonné-complete by some authors).
