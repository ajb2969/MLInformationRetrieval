   Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase      Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase   In enzymology , a methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin and H 2 O , whereas its product is 5-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin 10-hydrolase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase , N5,N10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase , and methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
