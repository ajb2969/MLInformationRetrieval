   Ribet's theorem      Ribet's theorem   In mathematics , Ribet's theorem (earlier called the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture ) is a statement in number theory concerning properties of Galois representations associated with modular forms . It was proposed by Jean-Pierre Serre and proved by Ken Ribet . The proof of epsilon conjecture was a significant step towards the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem . As shown by Serre and Ribet, the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (whose status was unresolved at the time) and the epsilon conjecture together imply that Fermat's Last Theorem is true.  Statement  Let f be a weight 2 newform on Γ 0 ( qN )–i.e. of level qN where q does not divide N –with absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation ρ f,p unramified at q if q ≠ p and finite flat at q = p . Then there exists a weight 2 newform g of level N such that        ρ   f  ,  p    ≃   ρ   g  ,  p     .     similar-to-or-equals   subscript  ρ   f  p     subscript  ρ   g  p      \rho_{f,p}\simeq\rho_{g,p}.     In particular, if E is an elliptic curve over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   with conductor qN , then the Modularity theorem guarantees that there exists a weight 2 newform f of level qN such that the 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation ρ f, p of f is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional mod p Galois representation ρ E, p of E . To apply Ribet's Theorem to ρ E, p , it suffices to check the irreducibility and ramification of ρ E, p . Using the theory of the Tate curve , one can prove that ρ E, p is unramified at q ≠ p and finite flat at q = p if p divides the power to which q appears in the minimal discriminant Δ E . Then Ribet's theorem implies that there exists a weight 2 newform g of level N such that ρ g, p ≈ ρ E, p .  The result of level lowering  Note that Ribet's theorem does not guarantee that if you begin with an elliptic curve E of conductor qN , there exists an elliptic curve ''E' '' of level N such that ρ E, p ≈ ρ E', p . The newform g of level N may not have rational Fourier coefficients, and hence may be associated to a higher-dimensional Abelian variety , not an elliptic curve. For example, elliptic curve 4171a1 in the Cremona database given by the equation      E  :     y  2   +   x  y   +  y   =     x  3   -   663204  x    +  206441595       normal-:  E       superscript  y  2     x  y   y        superscript  x  3     663204  x    206441595      E:y^{2}+xy+y=x^{3}-663204x+206441595   with conductor 43*97 and discriminant 43 7 * 97 3 does not level-lower mod 7 to an elliptic curve of conductor 97. Rather, the mod p Galois representation is isomorphic to the mod p Galois representation of an irrational newform g of level 97.  However, for p large enough compared to the level N of the level-lowered newform, a rational newform (e.g. an elliptic curve) must level-lower to another rational newform (e.g. elliptic curve). In particular for p >> N N 1+ε , the mod p Galois representation of a rational newform cannot be isomorphic to that of an irrational newform of level N . 1  Similarly, the Frey-Mazur conjecture predicts that for p large enough (independent of the conductor N ), elliptic curves with isomorphic mod p Galois representations are in fact isogenous , and hence have the same conductor. Thus non-trivial level-lowering between rational newforms is not predicted to occur for large p (in particular p > 17).  History  In his thesis,  came up with the idea of associating solutions ( a , b , c ) of Fermat's equation with a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve. 2 If p is an odd prime and a , b , and c are positive integers such that         a  p   +   b  p    =   c  p    ,         superscript  a  p    superscript  b  p     superscript  c  p     a^{p}+b^{p}=c^{p},     then a corresponding Frey curve is an algebraic curve given by the equation        y  2   =   x   (   x  -   a  p    )    (   x  +   b  p    )     .       superscript  y  2     x    x   superscript  a  p      x   superscript  b  p       y^{2}=x(x-a^{p})(x+b^{p}).     This is a nonsingular algebraic curve of genus one defined over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , and its projective completion is an elliptic curve over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   .  In 1982 Gerhard Frey called attention to the unusual properties of the same curve as Hellegouarch, now called a Frey curve . 3 This provided a bridge between Fermat and Taniyama by showing that a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would create such a curve that would not be modular. The conjecture attracted considerable interest when Frey (1986) suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem. However, his argument was not complete. 4 In 1985 Jean-Pierre Serre proposed that a Frey curve could not be modular and provided a partial proof of this. 5 6 This showed that a proof of the semistable case of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture would imply Fermat's Last Theorem. Serre did not provide a complete proof and what was missing became known as the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture. In the summer of 1986, Kenneth Alan Ribet proved the epsilon conjecture, thereby proving that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implied Fermat's Last Theorem. 7  Implication of Fermat's Last Theorem  Suppose that the Fermat equation with exponent p ≥ 3 had a solution in non-zero integers a , b , c . Let us form the corresponding Frey curve E a p ,b p ,c p . It is an elliptic curve and one can show that its minimal discriminant Δ is equal to 2 −8 ( abc ) 2p and its conductor N is the radical of abc , i.e. the product of all distinct primes dividing abc . By an elementary consideration of the equation a p + b p = c p , it is clear that one of a, b, c is even and hence so is N . By the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, E is a modular elliptic curve. Since all odd primes dividing a,b,c in N appear to a p th power in the minimal discriminant Δ, by Ribet's theorem one can perform level descent modulo p repetitively to strip off all odd primes from the conductor. However, there are no newforms of level 2 as the genus of the modular curve X 0 (2) is zero (and newforms of level N are differentials on X 0 ( N )).
