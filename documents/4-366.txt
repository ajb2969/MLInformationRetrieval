   Deficit round robin      Deficit round robin   Deficit Round Robin ( DRR ), also Deficit Weighted Round Robin ( DWRR ), is a scheduling algorithm for the network scheduler . DRR is, like weighted fair queuing (WFQ), a packet-based implementation of the ideal Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) policy. It was proposed by M. Shreedhar and G. Varghese in 1995 as an efficient (with O(1) complexity) and fair algorithm. 1  Details  In DRR, a scheduler handling N flows is configured with one quantum    Q  i     subscript  Q  i    Q_{i}   for each flow. This global idea is that, at each round, the flow   i   i   i   can send at most    Q  i     subscript  Q  i    Q_{i}   bytes, and the remaining, if any, is reported to the next round. In this way, the flow of number   i   i   i   will achieve a minimal long term data rate of      Q  i    (    Q  1   +   Q  2   +  …  +   Q  N    )    R         subscript  Q  i      subscript  Q  1    subscript  Q  2   normal-…   subscript  Q  N     R    \frac{Q_{i}}{(Q_{1}+Q_{2}+...+Q_{N})}R   , where   R   R   R   is the link rate.  Algorithm  The DRR scans all non empty queues in sequence. When a non empty queue   i   i   i   is selected, its deficit counter is incremented by its quantum value. Then, the value of the deficit counter is a maximal amount of bytes that can be send at this turn: if the deficit counter is greater than the packet's size at the head of the queue (HoQ), this packet can be sent and the value of the counter is decremented by the packet size. Then, the size of the next packet is compared to the counter value, etc. Once the queue is empty or the value of the counter is insufficient, the scheduler will skip to the next queue. If the queue is empty, the value of the deficit counter is reset to 0.

Like WFQ, DRR offers a minimal rate to each flow whatever the size of the packets is. In weighted round robin scheduling, the fraction of bandwidth used depend on the packets sizes.  Compared with WFQ scheduler that has complexity of O(log(n)) ( n is the number of active flows/queues ), the complexity of DRR is O(1) , if the quantum    Q  i     subscript  Q  i    Q_{i}   is larger than the maximum packet size of this flow. Nevertheless, this efficiency has a cost: the latency, i.e. the distance to the ideal GPS, is larger in DRR than in WFQ. 2  Implementations  An implementation of the deficit round robin algorithm was written by Patrick McHardy for the Linux kernel 3 and published under the GNU General Public License .  In Cisco and Juniper routers, modified versions of DRR are implemented: since the latency of DRR can be larger for some class of traffic, these modified versions give higher priority to some queues, whereas the others are served with the standard DRR algorithm. 4 5  See also   Scheduling algorithm  Fair Queuing  Generalized processor sharing  Weighted Fair Queuing  Weighted round robin  Fairness measure   Notes  References  External links   UC Berkeley EE122 lecture: Efficient fair queueing using deficit round robin   "  Category:Network scheduling algorithms     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
