   Putrescine carbamoyltransferase      Putrescine carbamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a putrescine carbamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   carbamoyl phosphate + putrescine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + N-carbamoylputrescine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are carbamoyl phosphate and putrescine , whereas its two products are phosphate and N-carbamoylputrescine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the carboxy- and carbamoyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carbamoyl-phosphate:putrescine carbamoyltransferase . Other names in common use include PTCase , putrescine synthase , and putrescine transcarbamylase .
