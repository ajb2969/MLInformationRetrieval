In statistics, the Davis distributions are a family of continuous probability distributions. It is named after Harold T. Davis (1892–1974), who in 1941 proposed this distribution to model income sizes. (The Theory of Econometrics and Analysis of Economic Time Series). It is a generalization of the Planck's law of radiation from statistical physics.
Definition
The probability density function of the Davis distribution is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function and 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta function. Here μ, b, and n are parameters of the distribution, and n need not be an integer.
Background
In an attempt to derive an expression that would represent not merely the upper tail of the distribution of income, Davis required an appropriate model with the following properties1



 
  for some 
 
 

A modal income exists
For large x, the density behaves like a Pareto distribution:
