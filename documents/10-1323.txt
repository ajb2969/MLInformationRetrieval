   Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)      Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)   In enzymology , a succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinate semialdehyde + NAD(P)+ + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + NAD(P)H + 2 H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are succinate semialdehyde , NAD + , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are succinate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinate-semialdehyde:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine , dinucleotide (phosphate)) , and succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : glutamate metabolism , tyrosine metabolism , and butanoate metabolism .  References   Boyer, P.D., Lardy, H. and Myrback, K.
