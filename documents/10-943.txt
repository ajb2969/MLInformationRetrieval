Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase

In enzymology, a phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA, ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(3Z)-phycocyanobilin + oxidized ferredoxin 
 
 
 
  biliverdin IXalpha + reduced ferredoxin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (3Z)-phycocyanobilin and oxidized ferredoxin, whereas its two products are biliverdin IXalpha and reduced ferredoxin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3Z)-phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
