   Lie algebra cohomology      Lie algebra cohomology   In mathematics , Lie algebra cohomology is a cohomology theory for Lie algebras . It was defined by  in order to give an algebraic construction of the cohomology of the underlying topological spaces of compact Lie groups . In the paper above, a specific chain complex , called the Koszul complex , is defined for a module over a Lie algebra, and its cohomology is taken in the normal sense.  Motivation  If G is a compact simply connected Lie group, then it is determined by its Lie algebra, so it should be possible to calculate its cohomology from the Lie algebra. This can be done as follows. Its cohomology is the de Rham cohomology of the complex of differential forms on G . This can be replaced by the complex of equivariant differential forms , which can in turn be identified with the exterior algebra of the Lie algebra, with a suitable differential. The construction of this differential on an exterior algebra makes sense for any Lie algebra, so is used to define Lie algebra cohomology for all Lie algebras. More generally one uses a similar construction to define Lie algebra cohomology with coefficients in a module.  Definition  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a Lie algebra over a commutative ring R with universal enveloping algebra     U  𝔤      U  𝔤    U\mathfrak{g}   , and let M be a representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   (equivalently, a    U  𝔤      U  𝔤    U\mathfrak{g}   -module). Considering R as a trivial representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , one defines the cohomology groups          H  n    (  𝔤  ;  M  )    :=    Ext   U  𝔤   n    (  R  ,  M  )       assign     superscript  normal-H  n    𝔤  M       subscript   superscript  Ext  n     U  𝔤     R  M      \mathrm{H}^{n}(\mathfrak{g};M):=\mathrm{Ext}^{n}_{U\mathfrak{g}}(R,M)        (see Ext functor for the definition of Ext). Equivalently, these are the right derived functors of the left exact invariant submodule functor         M  ↦   M  𝔤   :=   {   m  ∈  M   ∣    x  m   =    0   for all  x   ∈  𝔤   }    .       maps-to  M   superscript  M  𝔤     assign     conditional-set    m  M         x  m     0  for all  x        𝔤        M\mapsto M^{\mathfrak{g}}:=\{m\in M\mid xm=0\ \text{ for all }x\in\mathfrak{g}\}.        Analogously, one can define Lie algebra homology as          H  n    (  𝔤  ;  M  )    :=    Tor  n   U  𝔤     (  R  ,  M  )       assign     subscript  normal-H  n    𝔤  M       superscript   subscript  Tor  n     U  𝔤     R  M      \mathrm{H}_{n}(\mathfrak{g};M):=\mathrm{Tor}_{n}^{U\mathfrak{g}}(R,M)        (see Tor functor for the definition of Tor), which is equivalent to the left derived functors of the right exact coinvariants functor         M  ↦   M  𝔤   :=    M  /  𝔤   M    .       maps-to  M   subscript  M  𝔤     assign        M  𝔤   M      M\mapsto M_{\mathfrak{g}}:=M/\mathfrak{g}M.        Some important basic results about the cohomology of Lie algebras include Whitehead's lemmas , Weyl's theorem , and the Levi decomposition theorem.  Chevalley-Eilenberg complex  The Lie algebra cohomology of the Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   over the field   k   k   k   , with values in the left   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module   M   M   M   can be computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex      Hom  k    (    Λ  ∗   𝔤   ,  M  )        subscript  Hom  k       superscript  normal-Λ  normal-∗   𝔤   M     \mathrm{Hom}_{k}(\Lambda^{\ast}\mathfrak{g},M)   . The   n   n   n   -cochains in this complex are the alternating   k   k   k   -multilinear functions    f  :     Λ  n   𝔤   →  M      normal-:  f   normal-→     superscript  normal-Λ  n   𝔤   M     f:\Lambda^{n}\mathfrak{g}\to M   of   n   n   n   variables with values in   M   M   M   . The coboundary of an   n   n   n   -cochain is the    (   n  +  1   )      n  1    (n+1)   -cochain    δ  f      δ  f    \delta f   given by 1    (\delta f)(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1})=\sum_i (-1)^{i+1}x_i\, f(x_1,\ldots,\hat x_i,\ldots,x_{n+1})+\sum_{i<j} (-1)^{i+j}f([x_i,x_j],x_1,\ldots,\hat="" ,="" <="" math="">     where the caret signifies omitting that argument.  Cohomology in small dimensions  The zeroth cohomology group is (by definition) the invariants of the Lie algebra acting on the module:         H  0    (  𝔤  ;  M  )    =   M  𝔤   =   {   m  ∈  M   ∣    x  m   =    0   for all  x   ∈  𝔤   }    .           superscript  H  0    𝔤  M     superscript  M  𝔤         conditional-set    m  M         x  m     0  for all  x        𝔤        H^{0}(\mathfrak{g};M)=M^{\mathfrak{g}}=\{m\in M\mid xm=0\ \text{ for all }x\in%
 \mathfrak{g}\}.     The first cohomology group is the space    D  e  r      D  e  r    Der   of derivations modulo the space    I  d  e  r      I  d  e  r    Ider   of inner derivations        H  1    (  𝔤  ;  M  )    =     Der   (  𝔤  ,  M  )    /  Ider    (  𝔤  ,  M  )           superscript  H  1    𝔤  M          Der   𝔤  M    Ider    𝔤  M      H^{1}(\mathfrak{g};M)=\mathrm{Der}(\mathfrak{g},M)/\mathrm{Ider}(\mathfrak{g},M)   where a derivation is a map   d   d   d   from the Lie algebra to   M   M   M   such that       d   [  x  ,  y  ]    =    x  d  y   -   y  d   x           d   x  y        x  d  y     y  d  x      d[x,y]=xdy-ydx~{}   and is called inner if it is given by       d  x   =   x   a          d  x     x  a     dx=xa~{}   for some   a   a   a   in   M   M   M   .  The second cohomology group       H  2    (  𝔤  ;  M  )        superscript  H  2    𝔤  M     H^{2}(\mathfrak{g};M)   is the space of equivalence classes of Lie algebra extensions      0  →  M  →  𝔥  →  𝔤  →  0       normal-→  0  M    normal-→    𝔥    normal-→    𝔤    normal-→    0     0\rightarrow M\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow 0   of the Lie algebra by the module   M   M   M   .  There do not seem to be any similar easy interpretations for the higher cohomology groups.  See also   BRST formalism in theoretical physics.
