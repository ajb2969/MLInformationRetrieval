   Ascopyrone tautomerase      Ascopyrone tautomerase   In enzymology , an ascopyrone tautomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-1-en-3-ulose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose , and one product , 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-1-en-3-ulose .  The enzyme is involved with the anhydrofructose pathway . 1  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting keto- and enol-groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose Delta3-Delta1-isomerase . Other names in common use include ascopyrone isomerase , ascopyrone intramolecular oxidoreductase , 1,5-anhydro-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose tautomerase , APM tautomerase , ascopyrone P tautomerase , and APTM .
