Cells are face-transitive with 4 identical isosceles triangle faces.  John Horton Conway calls this honeycomb a oblate tetrahedrille .  The tetrahedral disphenoid honeycomb is the dual of the uniform bitruncated cubic honeycomb .  Its vertices form the A     3     *     subscript   superscript  absent    3    {}^{*}_{3}   / D     3     *     subscript   superscript  absent    3    {}^{*}_{3}   lattice, which is also known as the Body-Centered Cubic lattice.  Geometry  This honeycomb's vertex figure is a tetrakis cube : 24 disphenoids meet at each vertex. The union of these 24 disphenoids forms a rhombic dodecahedron . Each edge of the tessellation is surrounded by either four or six disphenoids, according to whether it forms the base or one of the sides of its adjacent isosceles triangle faces respectively. When an edge forms the base of its adjacent isosceles triangles, and is surrounded by four disphenoids, they form an irregular octahedron . When an edge forms one of the two equal sides of its adjacent isosceles triangle faces, the six disphenoids surrounding the edge form a special type of parallelepiped called a trigonal trapezohedron .      An orientation of the tetragonal disphenoid honeycomb can be obtained by starting with a cubic honeycomb , subdividing it at the planes    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   ,    x  =  z      x  z    x=z   , and    y  =  z      y  z    y=z   (i.e. subdividing each cube into path-tetrahedra ), then squashing it along the main diagonal until the distance between the points (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1) becomes the same as the distance between the points (0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 1).  {{-}}  Hexakis cubic honeycomb      Hexakis cubic honeycomb      (Figure)  Hexakis cubic honeycomb.png      Type     Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams     Cell     Faces     Space group  Fibrifold notation     Coxeter group     vertex figures     Dual     Properties     The hexakis cubic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb ) in Euclidean 3-space.

The original cubic honeycomb walls are removed, joining pairs of square pyramids into elongated square bipyramids (octahedron). Its vertex and edge framework is identical to the hexakis cubic honeycomb .  There is one type of plane with faces: a flattended triangular tiling with half of the triangles as holes . These cut face-diagonally through the original cubes. There are also square tiling plane that exist as nonface holes passing through the centers of the octahedral cells.
