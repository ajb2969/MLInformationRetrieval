   Carbonyl reductase (NADPH)      Carbonyl reductase (NADPH)   In enzymology , a carbonyl reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   R-CHOH-R' + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   R-CO-R' + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are R-CHOH-R' and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are R-CO-R' , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is secondary-alcohol:NADP + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aldehyde reductase 1 , prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase , xenobiotic ketone reductase , NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase , ALR3 , carbonyl reductase , nonspecific NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase , aldehyde reductase 1 , and carbonyl reductase (NADPH) . This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism , and has recently been shown to catabolize S-Nitrosoglutathione, as a means to degrade NO in an NADPH-dependent manner.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
