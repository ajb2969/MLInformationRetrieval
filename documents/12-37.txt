   Equisatisfiability      Equisatisfiability   In logic , two formulae are equisatisfiable if the first formula is satisfiable whenever the second is and vice versa; in other words, either both formulae are satisfiable or both are not. Two equisatisfiable formulae may have different models , provided they both have some or both have none. As a result, equisatisfiability is different from logical equivalence , as two equivalent formulae always have the same models.  Equisatisfiability is generally used in the context of translating formulae, so that one can define a translation to be correct if the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Examples of translations involving this concept are Skolemization and some translations into conjunctive normal form .  Examples  A translation from propositional logic into propositional logic in which every binary disjunction    a  ∨  b      a  b    a\vee b   is replaced by    (    (   a  ∨  n   )   ∧   (    ¬  n   ∨  b   )    )        a  n        n   b     ((a\vee n)\wedge(\neg n\vee b))   , where   n   n   n   is a new variable (one for each replaced disjunction) is a transformation in which satisfiability is preserved: the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Note that these two formulae are not equivalent: the first formula has the model in which   b   b   b   is true while   a   a   a   and   n   n   n   are false, and this is not a model of the second formula, in which   n   n   n   has to be true in this case.
