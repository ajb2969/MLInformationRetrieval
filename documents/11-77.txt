   Gamma-glutamylhistamine synthase      Gamma-glutamylhistamine synthase   In enzymology , a gamma-glutamylhistamine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-glutamate + histamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   products of ATP breakdown + Nalpha-gamma-L-glutamylhistamine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-glutamate , and histamine , whereas its two products are products of ATP breakdown and Nalpha-gamma-L-glutamylhistamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:histamine ligase . Other names in common use include gamma-glutaminylhistamine synthetase , and gamma-GHA synthetase .
