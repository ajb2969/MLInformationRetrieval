The Entropy Influence Conjecture

This article describes the The Entropy Influence Conjecture.
The Conjecture
For a function $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\} \!$ the Entropy-Influence relates the following two quantities, both of which may be expressed in terms of the Fourier Expansion of the functions $f = \sum_{S \subset [n]} \hat{f}(S) x_S \!$, where $x_S = \prod_{i \in S} x_i \!$. The first expression is the total influence of the function defined by $I(f) = \sum_S |S| \hat{f}^2(S) \!$. The second terms is the Entropy (of the spectrum) of the function defined by $H(f) = - \sum_S \hat{f}^2(S) \log \hat{f}^2(S) \!$ (where $x \log x = 0 \!$ when $x=0 \!$).
The conjecture states that there exists an absolute constant C such that for all Boolean functions $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\} \!$ it holds that $H(f) \leq C I(f) \!$.
