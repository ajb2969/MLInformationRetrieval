   S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase      S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase   In enzymology , a S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-inosyl-L-homocysteine + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are S-inosyl-L-homocysteine and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine aminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called adenosylhomocysteine deaminase .
