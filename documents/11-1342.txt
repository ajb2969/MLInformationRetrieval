   Nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase      Nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase   In enzymology , a nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-deoxy-D-ribosyl-base 1 + base 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-deoxy-D-ribosyl-base 2 + base 1    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-deoxy-D-ribosyl-base 1 and base 2 , whereas its two products are 2-deoxy-D-ribosyl-base 2 and base 1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nucleoside:purine(pyrimidine) deoxy-D-ribosyltransferase . Other names in common use include purine(pyrimidine) nucleoside:purine(pyrimidine) deoxyribosyl , transferase , deoxyribose transferase , nucleoside trans-N-deoxyribosylase , trans-deoxyribosylase , trans-N-deoxyribosylase , trans-N-glycosidase , nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase I (purine nucleoside:purine , deoxyribosyltransferase: strictly specific for transfer between , purine bases) , nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferase II [purine(pyrimidine) , and nucleoside:purine(pyrimidine) deoxyribosyltransferase] . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .
