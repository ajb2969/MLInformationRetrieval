   Dehydrogluconate dehydrogenase      Dehydrogluconate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a dehydrogluconate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-D-gluconate + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,5-didehydro-D-gluconate + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-dehydro-D-gluconate and acceptor , whereas its two products are 2,5-didehydro-D-gluconate and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-D-gluconate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include ketogluconate dehydrogenase , alpha-ketogluconate dehydrogenase , 2-keto-D-gluconate dehydrogenase , and 2-oxogluconate dehydrogenase . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Flavoprotein .  References      "  Category:EC 1.1.99  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Flavoprotein enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
