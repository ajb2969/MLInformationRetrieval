The 
 
 
 
 th centered hexagonal number is given by the formula



 Expressing the formula as



shows that the centered hexagonal number for 
 
 
 
  is 1 more than 6 times the 
 
 
 
 th triangular number.
The first few centered hexagonal numbers are :

1, 7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271, 331, 397, 469, 547, 631, 721, 817, 919.
 

In base 10 one can notice that the hexagonal numbers' rightmost (least significant) digits follow the pattern 1–7–9–7–1.
Centered hexagonal numbers have practical applications in materials logistics management, for example, in packing round items into larger round containers, such as Vienna sausages into round cans, or combining individual wire strands into a cable.
The sum of the first 
 
 
 
  centered hexagonal numbers happens to be . That is, centered hexagonal pyramidal numbers and cubes are the same numbers, but they represent different shapes. Viewed from the opposite perspective, centered hexagonal numbers are differences of two consecutive cubes, so that the centered hexagonal numbers are the gnomon of the cubes. In particular, prime centered hexagonal numbers are cuban primes.
The difference between  and the 
 
 
 
 th centered hexagonal number is a number of the form , while the difference between  and the 
 
 
 
 th centered hexagonal number is a pronic number.
