   2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase      2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase   2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase also known as CNPase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CNP  gene . 1 2  Reaction  CNPase catalyzes the following reaction:   nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nucleoside 2'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is nucleoside 2'-phosphate .  Function  CNPase is a myelin -associated enzyme that makes up 4% of total CNS myelin protein, and is thought to undergo significant age-associated changes. 3 It is named for its ability to catalyze the phosphodiester  hydrolysis of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to 2'-nucleotides, though a cohesive understanding of its specific physiologic functions are still ambiguous. 4  Structural studies have revealed that four classes of CNPases belong to one protein superfamily. CNPase's catalytic core consists of three alpha-helices and nine beta-strands . The proposed mechanism of CNPases phosphodiesterase catalytic activity is similar to the second step of the reaction mechanism for RNase A . 5  CNPase is expressed exclusively by oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and the appearance of CNPase seems to be one of the earliest events of oligodendrocyte differentiation. 6 CNPase is thought to play a critical role in the events leading up to myelination. 7  CNPase also associates with microtubules in brain tissue and FRTL-5 thyroid cells, and is reported to have microtubule-associated protein -like activity (MAP; see MAP2 ), being able to catalyze microtubule formation at low molar ratios. Deletion of the C-terminus of CNPase or phosphorylation abolish the catalytic activity of microtubule formation. CNPase can link tubulin to cellular membranes, and might be involved in the regulation cytoplasmic microtubule distribution. 8  Interestingly, CNPase has also been demonstrated to inhibit the replication of HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses by binding the retroviral Gag protein and inhibiting the genesis of nascent viral particles. Whether this is a biological function of CNPase or a coincidental activity remains unclear 9 {{-}}  References  Further reading                          "  Category:Human proteins     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
