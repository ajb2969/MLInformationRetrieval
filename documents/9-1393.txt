   Partial linear space      Partial linear space   A partial linear space (also semilinear or near-linear space) is a basic incidence structure in the field of incidence geometry, that carries slightly less structure than a linear space . The notion is equivalent to that of a linear hypergraph .  Definition  Let    S  =   (  𝒫  ,  ℬ  ,  𝐈  )       S   𝒫  ℬ  I     S=({\mathcal{P}},{\mathcal{B}},\textbf{I})   an incidence structure, for which the elements of   𝒫   𝒫   {\mathcal{P}}   are called points and the elements of   ℬ   ℬ   {\mathcal{B}}   are called lines . S is a partial linear space, if the following axioms hold:   any line is at least incident with two points  any pair of distinct points is incident with at most one line   Examples   Projective space  Affine space  Polar space  Generalized quadrangle  Generalized polygon  Near polygon   References    .
