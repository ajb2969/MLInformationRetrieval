Tryptophanamidase

In enzymology, a tryptophanamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-tryptophanamide + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-tryptophan + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophanamide and H2O, whereas its two products are L-tryptophan and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophanamide amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include tryptophan aminopeptidase, and L-tryptophan aminopeptidase. It employs one cofactor, manganese.
