   Jurkat–Richert theorem      Jurkat–Richert theorem   The Jurkat–Richert theorem is a mathematical theorem in sieve theory . It is a key ingredient in proofs of Chen's theorem on Goldbach's conjecture . 1 It was proved in 1965 by Wolfgang B. Jurkat and Hans-Egon Richert . 2  Statement of the theorem  This formulation is from Diamond & Halberstam . 3 Other formulations are in Jurkat & Richert, 4 Halberstam & Richert, 5 and Nathanson. 6  Suppose A is a finite sequence of integers and P is a set of primes. Write A d for the number of items in A that are divisible by d , and write P ( z ) for the product of the elements in P that are less than z . Write ω( d ) for a multiplicative function such that ω( p )/ p is approximately the proportion of elements of A divisible by p , write X for any convenient approximation to | A |, and write the remainder as         r  A    (  d  )    =    |   A  d   |   -     ω   (  d  )    d   X     .         subscript  r  A   d        subscript  A  d          ω  d   d   X      r_{A}(d)=\left|A_{d}\right|-\frac{\omega(d)}{d}X.     Write S ( A , P , z ) for the number of items in A that are relatively prime to P ( z ). Write        V   (  z  )    =    ∏    p  ∈  P   ,   p  <  z      (   1  -    ω   (  p  )    p    )     .

Write F 1 and f 1 for functions satisfying certain difference differential equations (see Diamond & Halberstam 7 for the definition and properties).  We assume the dimension (sifting density) is 1: that is, there is a constant C such that for 2 ≤ z \prod_{z \le p  (The book of Diamond & Halberstam 8 extends the theorem to dimensions higher than 1.) Then the Jurkat–Richert theorem states that for any numbers y and z with 2 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ X we have       S   (  A  ,  P  ,  z  )    ≤    X  V   (  z  )    (     F  1    (    log  y    log  z    )    +   O   (     (   log   log  y    )    3  /  4      (   log  y   )    1  /  4     )     )    +    ∑   m  |  P   (  z  )   ,  m  <  y      4   ν   (  m  )      |    r  A    (  m  )    |            S   A  P  z        X  V  z       subscript  F  1       y     z       O     superscript      y      3  4     superscript    y     1  4          subscript    fragments  m  normal-|  P   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)   normal-,  m   y       superscript  4    ν  m         subscript  r  A   m         S(A,P,z)\leq XV(z)\left(F_{1}\left(\frac{\log y}{\log z}\right)+O\left(\frac{(%
