Cyclotomic polynomial

In mathematics, more specifically in algebra, the''' nth cyclotomic polynomial, for any positive integer n, is the unique irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients, which is a divisor of 
 
 
 
  and is not a divisor of 
 
 
 
  for any  Its roots are the nth primitive roots of unity

 
 , where k runs over the integers lower than n and coprime to n. In other words, the nth cyclotomic polynomial''' is equal to



It may also be defined as the monic polynomial with integer coefficients, which is the minimal polynomial over the field of the rational numbers of any primitive nth-root of unity (
 
 
 
  is an example of such a root).
Another important equation, linking the cyclotomic polynomials and primitive roots of unity, is the following one.



Examples
If n is a prime number then


 
  If n=2p where p is an odd prime number then



For n up to 30, the cyclotomic polynomials are:1


























































































The case of the 105th cyclotomic polynomial is interesting because 105 is the lowest integer that is the product of three distinct odd prime numbers and this polynomial is the first one that has a coefficient greater than 1:



Properties
Fundamental tools
The cyclotomic polynomials are monic polynomials with integer coefficients that are irreducible over the field of the rational numbers. Except for n equal to 1 or 2, they are palindromics of even degree.
The degree of 
 
 
 
 , or in other words the number of nth primitive roots of unity, is 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is Euler's totient function.
The fact that 
 
 
 
  is an irreducible polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
  in the ring

 
  is a nontrivial result due to Gauss.2 Depending on the chosen definition, it is either the value of the degree or the irreducibility which is a nontrivial result. The case of prime n is easier to prove than the general case, thanks to Eisenstein's criterion.
A fundamental relation involving cyclotomic polynomials is


 
  which means that each n-th root of unity is a primitive d-th root of unity for a unique d dividing n.
The Möbius inversion formula allows the expression of 
 
 
 
  as an explicit rational fraction:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Möbius function.
The cyclotomic polynomial 
 
 
 
  may be computed by (exactly) dividing 
 
 
 
  by the cyclotomic polynomials of the proper divisors of n previously computed recursively by the same method:


 
 .)
This formula allows to compute 
 
 
 
  on a computer for any n, as soon as integer factorization and division of polynomials are available. Many computer algebra systems have a built in function to compute the cyclotomic polynomials. For example this function is called by typing cyclotomic_polynomial(n,'x') in Sage, numtheory[cyclotomic](n,x); in Maple, and Cyclotomic[n,x] in Mathematica.
Easy cases for the computation
As noted above, if n is a prime number, then



If n is an odd integer greater than one, then



In particular, if n=2p is twice an odd prime, then (as noted above)



If n=pm is a prime power (where p is prime), then



More generally, if n=pmr with r relatively prime to p, then



These formulas may be applied repeatedly to get a simple expression for any cyclotomic polynomial 
 
 
 
  in term of a cyclotomic polynomial of square free index: If q is the product of the prime divisors of n (its radical), then3



This allows to give formulas for the nth cyclotomic polynomial when n has at most one odd prime factor: If p is an odd prime number, and h and k are positive integers, then:









For the other values of n, the computation of the nth cyclotomic polynomial is similarly reduced to that of 
 
 
 
  where q is the product of the distinct odd prime divisors of n. To deal with this case, one has that, for p prime and not dividing n,4



Integers appearing as coefficients
The problem of bounding the magnitude of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials has been the object of a number of research papers.
If n has at most two distinct odd prime factors, then Migotti showed that the coefficients of 
 
 
 
  are all in the set {1, −1, 0}.5
The first cyclotomic polynomial for a product of 3 different odd prime factors is 
 
 
 
  it has a coefficient −2 (see its expression above). The converse isn't true
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
  only has coefficients in {1, −1, 0}.
If n is a product of more odd different prime factors, the coefficients may increase to very high values. E.g., 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
  has coefficients running from −22 to 22, 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
 , the smallest n with 6 different odd primes, has coefficients up to ±532.
Let A(n) denote the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of Φn. It is known that for any positive k, the number of n up to x with A(n) > nk is at least c(k)⋅x for a positive c(k) depending on k and x sufficiently large. In the opposite direction, for any function ψ(n) tending to infinity with n we have A(n) bounded above by nψ(n) for almost all n.6
Gauss's formula
Let n be odd, square-free, and greater than 3. Then78



where both An(z) and Bn(z) have integer coefficients, An(z) has degree φ(n)/2, and Bn(z) has degree φ(n)/2 − 2. Furthermore, An(z) is palindromic when its degree is even; if its degree is odd it is antipalindromic. Similarly, Bn(z) is palindromic unless n is composite and ≡ 3 (mod 4), in which case it is antipalindromic.
The first few cases are









Lucas's formula
Let n be odd, square-free and greater than 3. Then9



where both Un(z) and Vn(z) have integer coefficients, Un(z) has degree φ(n)/2, and Vn(z) has degree φ(n)/2 − 1. This can also be written



If n is even, square-free and greater than 2 (this forces n to be ≡ 2 (mod 4)),



where both Cn(z) and Dn(z) have integer coefficients, Cn(z) has degree φ(n), and Dn(z) has degree φ(n) − 1. Cn(z) and Dn(z) are both palindromic.
The first few cases are:









Cyclotomic polynomials over Zp
For any prime number p which does not divide n, cyclotomic polynomial 
 
 
 
  is irreducible over Zp if and only if p is a primitive root to mod n. That is, the multiplicative order of p to mod n is 
 
 
 
 , which is also the degree of 
 
 
 
 .
Prime Cyclotomic numbers
The prime numbers of the form 
 
 
 
  (with n, b integers, n > 2, b > 1) are listed in , or all primes in .
The list is about the smallest integer b > 1 which 
 
 
 
  is a prime (see ), it is conjectured that such b exists for all positive integer n (See Bunyakovsky conjecture). (For that to allow b = 1, see . In fact, b = 1 if and only if n is a prime or a prime power, so you can see this sequence for all positive integer n which is neither a prime nor a prime power. For n is a prime, see ).
The list is about all n ≤ 300 (The b-file of  lists all n ≤ 1000, but it lists 1 if and only if n is a prime or prime power)

For all positive integers n ≤ 1000, the largest three bs are 2706, 2061, and 2042, when n is 545, 601, and 943, and there are 17 values of n ≤ 1000 such that b > 1000.
In fact, if p is a prime, then

  and a repunit number in base b, (111111...111111)b, so the following is a list of the smallest b > 1 which

Using $\Phi_n$, one can give an elementary proof for the infinitude of primes congruent to 1 modulo n,10 which is a special case of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.
