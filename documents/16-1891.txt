   Rybicki Press algorithm      Rybicki Press algorithm   The Rybicki–Press algorithm is a fast direct algorithm for inverting a matrix, whose entries are given by     A   (  i  ,  j  )    =   exp   (   -   a   |    t  i   -   t  j    |     )          A   i  j          a       subscript  t  i    subscript  t  j          A(i,j)=\exp(-a|t_{i}-t_{j}|)   , where    a  ∈  ℝ      a  ℝ    a\in\mathbb{R}   . 1 It is a computational optimization of a general set of statistical methods developed to determine whether two noisy, irregularly sampled data sets are, in fact, dimensionally shifted representations of the same underlying function. 2 3 The most common use of the algorithm as of 2015 is in the detection of periodicity in astronomical observations.
