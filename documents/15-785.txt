Chlorophyll(ide) b reductase

Chlorophyll(ide) b reductase (, chlorophyll b reductase, Chl b reductase) is an enzyme with system name 71-hydroxychlorophyllide-a:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

71-hydroxychlorophyllide a + NAD(P)+

 
  chlorophyllide b + NAD(P)H + H+


This enzyme carries out the first step in the conversion of chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. It is involved in chlorophyll degradation, which occurs during leaf senescence, and it also forms part of the chlorophyll cycle, which interconverts chlorophyll a and b in response to changing light conditions.
