Glucosamine N-acetyltransferase




Glucosamine N-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a glucosamine N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + D-glucosamine 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and D-glucosamine, whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:D-glucosamine N-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include glucosamine acetylase, and glucosamine acetyltransferase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
