   Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1      Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1   Infinitely generated abelian groups have very complex structure and are far less well understood than finitely generated abelian groups . Even torsion-free abelian groups are vastly more varied in their characteristics than vector spaces . Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are far more amenable than those of higher rank, and a satisfactory classification exists, even though there are an uncountable number of isomorphism classes.  Definition  A torsion-free abelian group of rank 1 is an abelian group such that every element except the identity has infinite order, and for any two non-identity elements a and b there is a non-trivial relation between them over the integers:        n  a   +   m  b    =   0           n  a     m  b    0    na+mb=0\;     Classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1  For any non-identity element a in such a group and any prime number p there may or may not be another element a p n such that:        p  n    a   p  n     =   a          superscript  p  n    subscript  a   superscript  p  n     a    p^{n}a_{p^{n}}=a\;     If such an element exists for every n , we say the ''' p -root type of a is infinity''', otherwise, if n is the largest non-negative integer that there is such an element, we say the ''' p -root type of a is n '''.  We call the sequence of p -root types of an element a for all primes the root-type of a :       T   (  a  )    =   {   t  2   ,   t  3   ,   t  5   ,  …  }         T  a     subscript  t  2    subscript  t  3    subscript  t  5   normal-…     T(a)=\{t_{2},t_{3},t_{5},\ldots\}\;   .  If b is another non-identity element of the group, then there is a non-trivial relation between a and b :        n  a   +   m  b    =   0           n  a     m  b    0    na+mb=0\;     where we may take n and m to be coprime .  As a consequence of this the root-type of b differs from the root-type of a only by a finite difference at a finite number of indices (corresponding to those primes which divide either n or m ).  We call the co-finite equivalence class of a root-type to be the set of root-types that differ from it by a finite difference at a finite number of indices.  The co-finite equivalence class of the type of a non-identity element is a well-defined invariant of a torsion-free abelian group of rank 1. We call this invariant the type of a torsion-free abelian group of rank 1.  If two torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have the same type they may be shown to be isomorphic. Hence there is a bijection between types of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 and their isomorphism classes, providing a complete classification.  References     Chapter VIII.
