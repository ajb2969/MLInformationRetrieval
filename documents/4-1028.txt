   Pure submodule      Pure submodule   In mathematics , especially in the field of module theory , the concept of pure submodule provides a generalization of direct summand , a type of particularly well-behaved piece of a module . Pure modules are complementary to flat modules and generalize Prüfer's notion of pure subgroups . While flat modules are those modules which leave short exact sequences exact after tensoring , a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence that remains exact after tensoring with any module. Similarly a flat module is a direct limit of projective modules , and a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence which is a direct limit of split exact sequences , each defined by a direct summand.  Definition  Let R be a ring , and let M , P be modules over R . If i : P → M is injective then P is a pure submodule of M if, for any R -module X , the natural induced map on tensor products  i ⊗id X : P ⊗ X → M ⊗ X is injective .  Analogously, a short exact sequence      of R -modules is pure exact if the sequence stays exact when tensored with any R -module X . This is equivalent to saying that f ( A ) is a pure submodule of B .  Purity can also be expressed element-wise; it is really a statement about the solvability of certain systems of linear equations. Specifically, P is pure in M if and only if the following condition holds: for any m -by- n  matrix ( a ij ) with entries in R , and any set y 1 ,..., y m of elements of P , if there exist elements x 1 ,..., x n  in M such that         ∑   j  =  1   n     a   i  j     x  j     =   y  i      for  i   =   1  ,  …  ,  m       formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  a    i  j     subscript  x  j      subscript  y  i        for  i    1  normal-…  m      \sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}x_{j}=y_{i}\qquad\mbox{ for }i=1,\ldots,m   then there also exist elements x 1 ',..., x n ' in P such that         ∑   j  =  1   n     a   i  j     x  j  ′     =   y  i      for  i   =   1  ,  …  ,  m       formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  a    i  j     subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   j      subscript  y  i        for  i    1  normal-…  m      \sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}x^{\prime}_{j}=y_{i}\qquad\mbox{ for }i=1,\ldots,m     Examples   Every direct summand of M is pure in M . Consequently, every subspace of a vector space over a field is pure.     Suppose       is a short exact sequence of R modules, then:   C is a flat module if and only if the exact sequence is pure exact for every A and B . From this we can deduce that over a von Neumann regular ring , every submodule of every  R -module is pure. This is because every module over a von Neumann regular ring is flat. The converse is also true.  Suppose B is flat. Then the sequence is pure exact if and only if C is flat. From this one can deduce that pure submodules of flat modules are flat.  Suppose C is flat. Then B is flat if and only if A is flat.   References     "  Category:Module theory
