   Alternating series      Alternating series   In mathematics , an alternating series is an infinite series of the form       ∑   n  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   n     a  n        superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript    1   n    subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\,a_{n}   or     ∑   n  =  1   ∞       (   -  1   )    n  -  1      a  n        superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\,a_{n}     with a n > 0 for all n . The signs of the general terms alternate between positive and negative. Like any series, an alternating series converges if and only if the associated sequence of partial sums converges .  Examples  The geometric series 1/2 %E2%88%92 1/4 %2B 1/8 %E2%88%92 1/16 %2B %E2%8B%AF sums to 1/3.  The alternating harmonic series has a finite sum but the harmonic series does not.  The Mercator series provides an analytic expression of the natural logarithm :         ∑   n  =  1   ∞       (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n     x  n      =   ln   (   1  +  x   )     .        superscript   subscript     n  1           superscript    1     n  1    n    superscript  x  n         1  x      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}x^{n}\;=\;\ln(1+x).     The functions sine and cosine used in trigonometry can be defined as alternating series in calculus even though they are introduced in elementary algebra as the ratio of sides of a right triangle. In fact,       sin  x   =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   n     x    2  n   +  1      (    2  n   +  1   )   !            x     superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript    1   n      superscript  x      2  n   1          2  n   1         \sin x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}   , and        cos  x   =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   n     x   2  n      (   2  n   )   !       .        x     superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript    1   n      superscript  x    2  n        2  n         \cos x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}.   When the alternating factor (–1) n is removed from these series one obtains the hyperbolic functions sinh and cosh used in calculus.  For integer or positive index α the Bessel function of the first kind may be defined with the alternating series        J  α    (  x  )    =    ∑   m  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   m     m  !   Γ   (   m  +  α  +  1   )       (   x  2   )     2  m   +  α             subscript  J  α   x     superscript   subscript     m  0           superscript    1   m       m   normal-Γ    m  α  1      superscript    x  2       2  m   α        J_{\alpha}(x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{m}}{m!\,\Gamma(m+\alpha+1)}{\left%
 (\frac{x}{2}\right)}^{2m+\alpha}   where Γ( z ) is the gamma function .  If s is a complex number , the Dirichlet eta function is formed as an alternating series       η   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  -  1     n  s     =       1   1  s    -   1   2  s     +   1   3  s     -   1   4  s     +  ⋯           η  s     superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1     superscript  n  s                    1   superscript  1  s      1   superscript  2  s       1   superscript  3  s       1   superscript  4  s     normal-⋯      \eta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{(-1)^{n-1}\over n^{s}}=\frac{1}{1^{s}}-\frac{1}{2^%
 {s}}+\frac{1}{3^{s}}-\frac{1}{4^{s}}+\cdots   that is used in analytic number theory .  Alternating series test  The theorem known as "Leibniz Test" or the alternating series test tells us that an alternating series will converge if the terms a n converge to 0 monotonically .  Proof: Suppose the sequence    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   converges to zero and is monotone decreasing. If   m   m   m   is odd and     S  m   -   S  n        subscript  S  m    subscript  S  n     \displaystyle S_{m}-S_{n}   via the following calculation:      a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}     Since    -   (    a  m   -   a   m  +  1     )          subscript  a  m    subscript  a    m  1       -(a_{m}-a_{m+1})   is monotonically decreasing, the terms      S  m   -   S  n    ≤   a  m          subscript  S  m    subscript  S  n     subscript  a  m     S_{m}-S_{n}\leq a_{m}   are negative. Thus, we have the final inequality     -   a  m    ≤    S  m   -   S  n           subscript  a  m       subscript  S  m    subscript  S  n      -a_{m}\leq S_{m}-S_{n}   .Similarly it can be shown that    a  m     subscript  a  m    a_{m}   . Since   0   0    converges to    S  m     subscript  S  m    S_{m}   , our partial sums   m   m   m   form a Cauchy sequence (i.e. the series satisfies the Cauchy criterion ) and therefore converge. The argument for   n   n   n   even is similar.  Approximating sums  The estimate above does not depend on    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   . So, if      |     ∑   k  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   k      a  k      -     ∑   k  =  0   m        (   -  1   )   k     a  k      |   ≤   |   a   m  +  1    |    .            superscript   subscript     k  0         superscript    1   k    subscript  a  k       superscript   subscript     k  0    m      superscript    1   k    subscript  a  k          subscript  a    m  1       \left|\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\,a_{k}\,-\,\sum_{k=0}^{m}\,(-1)^{k}\,a_{k}%
 \right|\leq|a_{m+1}|.   is approaching 0 monotonically, the estimate provides an error bound for approximating infinite sums by partial sums:      ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}     Absolute convergence  A series    ∑   |   a  n   |          subscript  a  n      \sum|a_{n}|    converges absolutely if the series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   converges.  Theorem: Absolutely convergent series are convergent.  Proof: Suppose    ∑   |   a  n   |          subscript  a  n      \sum|a_{n}|   is absolutely convergent. Then,    ∑   2   |   a  n   |          2     subscript  a  n       \sum 2|a_{n}|   is convergent and it follows that    0  ≤    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    ≤   2   |   a  n   |          0     subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n            2     subscript  a  n        0\leq a_{n}+|a_{n}|\leq 2|a_{n}|   converges as well. Since    ∑   (    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    )          subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n       \sum(a_{n}+|a_{n}|)   , the series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   converges by the comparison test . Therefore, the series     ∑   a  n    =    ∑   (    a  n   +   |   a  n   |    )    -   ∑   |   a  n   |            subscript  a  n           subscript  a  n      subscript  a  n           subscript  a  n        \sum a_{n}=\sum(a_{n}+|a_{n}|)-\sum|a_{n}|   converges as the difference of two convergent series      ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1  n    ,      superscript   subscript     n  1        1  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n},\!   .  Conditional convergence  A series is conditionally convergent if it converges but does not converge absolutely.  For example, the harmonic series        ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n    ,      superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1    n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n},\!     diverges, while the alternating version        ln   (  2  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n    =      1  -   1  2    +   1  3    -   1  4    +  ⋯    .          2     superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1    n                 1    1  2      1  3      1  4    normal-⋯      \ln(2)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac%
 {1}{4}+\cdots.     converges by the alternating series test .  Rearrangements  For any series, we can create a new series by rearranging the order of summation. A series is unconditionally convergent if any rearrangement creates a series with the same convergence as the original series. Absolutely convergent series are unconditionally convergent . But the Riemann series theorem states that conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to create arbitrary convergence. 1 The general principle is that addition of infinite sums is only commutative for absolutely convergent series.  For example, this false proof that 1=0 exploits the failure of associativity for infinite sums.  As another example, we know that       1  2    ln   (  2  )          1  2     2     \frac{1}{2}\ln(2)     But, since the series does not converge absolutely, we can rearrange the terms to obtain a series for          (   1  -    1  2     )   -    1  4     +   (     1  3    -    1  6     )    -    1  8     +   (     1  5    -    1  10     )    -    1  12     +  ⋯                  1    1  2      1  4        1  3     1  6       1  8        1  5     1  10       1  12    normal-⋯    \displaystyle{}\quad\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)-\frac{1}{4}+\left(\frac{1}{3}-%

 & {} \quad \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)-\frac{1}{4}+\left(\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{6}\right)-\frac{1}{8}+\left(\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{10}\right)-\frac{1}{12}+\cdots \\[8pt]
 & = \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{10}-\frac{1}{12}+\cdots \\[8pt]

 \end{align}$$  Series acceleration  In practice, the numerical summation of an alternating series may be sped up using any one of a variety of series acceleration techniques. One of the oldest techniques is that of Euler summation , and there are many modern techniques that can offer even more rapid convergence.
