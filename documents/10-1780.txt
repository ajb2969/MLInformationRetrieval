Methylaspartate ammonia-lyase

In enzymology, a methylaspartate ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-threo-3-methylaspartate 
 
 
 
  mesaconate + NH3


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-threo-3-methylaspartate, and two products, mesaconate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threo-3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (mesaconate-forming). Other names in common use include beta-methylaspartase, 3-methylaspartase, and L-threo-3-methylaspartate ammonia-lyase. This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism and nitrogen metabolism. It employs one cofactor, cobamide.
Structural studies
Several structures of this enzyme have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (linked in the infobox) which show it possesses a TIM barrel domain.
