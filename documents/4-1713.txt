   Order (ring theory)      Order (ring theory)   In mathematics , an order in the sense of ring theory is a subring    𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   of a ring    A   A   A   , such that   A is a ring which is a finite-dimensional algebra over the rational number field    ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}        𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   spans A over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , so that     ℚ  𝒪   =  A        ℚ  𝒪   A    \mathbb{Q}\mathcal{O}=A   , and     𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   is a Z - lattice in A .   The last two conditions condition can be stated in less formal terms: Additively,   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   is a free abelian group generated by a basis for A over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   .  More generally for R an integral domain contained in a field K we define   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   to be an R -order in a K -algebra A if it is a subring of A which is a full R -lattice. 1  When A is not a commutative ring , the idea of order is still important, but the phenomena are different. For example, the Hurwitz quaternions form a maximal order in the quaternions with rational co-ordinates; they are not the quaternions with integer coordinates in the most obvious sense. Maximal orders exist in general, but need not be unique: there is in general no largest order, but a number of maximal orders. An important class of examples is that of integral group rings .  Examples: 2   If A is the matrix ring  M n ( K ) over K then the matrix ring M n ( R ) over R is an R -order in A  If R is an integral domain and L a finite separable extension of K , then the integral closure  S of R in L is an R -order in L .  If a in A is an integral element over R then the polynomial ring  R [ a ] is an R -order in the algebra K [ a ]  If A is the group ring  K [ G ] of a finite group G then R [ G ] is an R -order on K [ G ]   A fundamental property of R -orders is that every element of an R -order is integral over R . 3  If the integral closure S of R in A is an R -order then this result shows that S must be the maximal R -order in A . However this is not always the case: indeed S need not even be a ring, and even if S is a ring (for example, when A is commutative) then S need not be an R -lattice. 4  Algebraic number theory  The leading example is the case where A is a number field  K and   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}   is its ring of integers . In algebraic number theory there are examples for any K other than the rational field of proper subrings of the ring of integers that are also orders. For example in the field extension A = Q (i) of Gaussian rationals over Q , the integral closure of Z is the ring of Gaussian integers  Z [i] and so this is the unique maximal  Z -order: all other orders in A are contained in it: for example, we can take the subring of the       a  +   b  i    ,      a    b  i     a+bi,     for which b is an even number . 5  The maximal order question can be examined at a local field level. This technique is applied in algebraic number theory and modular representation theory .
