Proof of Stein's example

Stein's example is an important result in decision theory which can be stated as

The ordinary decision rule for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is inadmissible under mean squared error risk in dimension at least 3.
 

The following is an outline of its proof. The reader is referred to the main article for more information.
Sketched proof
The risk function of the decision rule 
 
 
 
  is



















Now consider the decision rule



where 
 
 
 
 . We will show that 
 
 
 
  is a better decision rule than 
 
 
 
 . The risk function is



















â€” a quadratic in 
 
 
 
 . We may simplify the middle term by considering a general "well-behaved" function 
 
 
 
  and using integration by parts. For 
 
 
 
 , for any continuously differentiable 
 
 
 
  growing sufficiently slowly for large 
 
 
 
  we have:














Therefore,



(This result is known as Stein's lemma.)
Now, we choose



If 
 
 
 
  met the "well-behaved" condition (it doesn't, but this can be remedied -- see below), we would have



and so






\mathbb{E}_\theta\left[\frac{\mathbf{(\theta-X)^T X}}{|\mathbf{X}|^2}\right] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}_\theta \left[ (\theta_i - X_i) \frac{X_i}{|\mathbf{X}|^2} \right]






Then returning to the risk function of 
 
 
 
 
  :



This quadratic in 
 
 
 
  is minimized at



giving



which of course satisfies:



making 
 
 
 
  an inadmissible decision rule.
It remains to justify the use of



This function is not continuously differentiable since it is singular at 
 
 
 
 . However the function



is continuously differentiable, and after following the algebra through and letting 
 
 
 
 
  one obtains the same result.
