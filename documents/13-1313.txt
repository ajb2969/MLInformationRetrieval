Milnor ring

In the mathematical discipline known as K-theory, the Milnor ring of a field F, named after John Milnor, is a graded ring

 
  with unit, defined from F. It has a generator 
 
 
 
  for each nonzero element a of the field, and is defined from these generators by the relations1



One can show that

 .
The Milnor ring appears on one side of the Milnor conjecture and the norm residue isomorphism theorem, which relate the Milnor ring to the Galois cohomology (or étale cohomology) of F.
