   Milnor ring      Milnor ring   In the mathematical discipline known as K-theory , the Milnor ring of a field F , named after John Milnor , is a graded ring      K  *  M    (  F  )        superscript   subscript  K    M   F    K_{*}^{M}(F)   with unit, defined from F . It has a generator    ℓ   (  a  )       normal-ℓ  a    \ell(a)   for each nonzero element a of the field, and is defined from these generators by the relations 1        ℓ   (   a  b   )    =    ℓ   (  a  )    +   ℓ   (  b  )      ,    ℓ   (  a  )   ℓ   (   1  -  a   )    =   0.       formulae-sequence      normal-ℓ    a  b        normal-ℓ  a     normal-ℓ  b         normal-ℓ  a  normal-ℓ    1  a    0.     \ell(ab)=\ell(a)+\ell(b),\quad\ell(a)\ell(1-a)=0.\,     One can show that      K  0  M    (  F  )    =  ℤ         superscript   subscript  K  0   M   F   ℤ    K_{0}^{M}(F)={\mathbb{Z}}   ,      K  1  M    (  F  )    =   F  -   {  0  }           superscript   subscript  K  1   M   F     F   0      K_{1}^{M}(F)=F-\{0\}   .  The Milnor ring appears on one side of the Milnor conjecture and the norm residue isomorphism theorem , which relate the Milnor ring to the Galois cohomology (or étale cohomology ) of F .
