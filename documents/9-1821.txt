Positive invariant set

In mathematical analysis, a positively invariant set is a set with the following properties:
Given a dynamical system

 
  and trajectory

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the initial point. Let 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a real valued function. The set 
 
 
 
  is said to be positively invariant if 
 
 
 
  implies that 
 
 

Intuitively, this means that once a trajectory of the system enters 
 
 
 
 
 , it will never leave it again.
