   Hill tetrahedron      Hill tetrahedron   In geometry , the Hill tetrahedra are a family of space-filling  tetrahedra . They were discovered in 1896 by M. J. M. Hill , a professor of mathematics at the University College London , who showed that they are scissor-congruent to a cube .  Construction  For every    α  ∈   (  0  ,    2  π   /  3   )       α   0      2  π   3      \alpha\in(0,2\pi/3)   , let      v  1   ,   v  2   ,   v  3    ∈   ℝ  3         subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2    subscript  v  3     superscript  ℝ  3     v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}   be three unit vectors with angle   α   α   \alpha   between every two of them. Define the Hill tetrahedron     Q   (  α  )       Q  α    Q(\alpha)   as follows:        Q   (  α  )    =   {     c  1    v  1    +    c  2    v  2    +    c  3    v  3     ∣   0  ≤   c  1   ≤   c  2   ≤   c  3   ≤  1   }    .        Q  α    conditional-set       subscript  c  1    subscript  v  1       subscript  c  2    subscript  v  2       subscript  c  3    subscript  v  3         0   subscript  c  1         subscript  c  2         subscript  c  3        1       Q(\alpha)\,=\,\{c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+c_{3}v_{3}\mid 0\leq c_{1}\leq c_{2}\leq

 _{3}\leq 1\}.   A special case    Q  =   Q   (   π  /  2   )        Q    Q    π  2      Q=Q(\pi/2)   is the tetrahedron having all sides right triangles with sides 1,    2      2    \sqrt{2}   and    3      3    \sqrt{3}   . Ludwig Schläfli studied   Q   Q   Q   as a special case of the orthoscheme , and H. S. M. Coxeter called it the characteristic tetrahedron of the cubic spacefilling.  Properties   A cube can be tiled with 6 copies of   Q   Q   Q   .  Every    Q   (  α  )       Q  α    Q(\alpha)   can be dissected into three polytopes which can be reassembled into a prism .   Generalizations  In 1951 Hugo Hadwiger found the following n -dimensional generalization of Hill tetrahedra:        Q   (  w  )    =   {     c  1    v  1    +  ⋯  +    c  n    v  n     ∣   0  ≤   c  1   ≤  ⋯  ≤   c  n   ≤  1   }    ,        Q  w    conditional-set       subscript  c  1    subscript  v  1    normal-⋯     subscript  c  n    subscript  v  n         0   subscript  c  1        normal-⋯        subscript  c  n        1       Q(w)\,=\,\{c_{1}v_{1}+\cdots+c_{n}v_{n}\mid 0\leq c_{1}\leq\cdots\leq c_{n}%
 \leq 1\},   where vectors     v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n       subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n     v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}   satisfy     (   v  i   ,   v  j   )   =  w        subscript  v  i    subscript  v  j    w    (v_{i},v_{j})=w   for all    1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  n        1  i       j       n     1\leq i   , and where     -   1  /   (   n  -  1   )     <  w  <  1            1    n  1     w       1     -1/(n-1)   . Hadwiger showed that all such simplices are scissor congruent to a hypercube .  See also   Schläfli orthoscheme   References   M. J. M.
