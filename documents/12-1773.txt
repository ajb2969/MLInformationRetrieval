Hill tetrahedron

In geometry, the Hill tetrahedra are a family of space-filling tetrahedra. They were discovered in 1896 by M. J. M. Hill, a professor of mathematics at the University College London, who showed that they are scissor-congruent to a cube.
Construction
For every 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be three unit vectors with angle 
 
 
 
  between every two of them. Define the Hill tetrahedron

 
  as follows:


 
  A special case 
 
 
 
  is the tetrahedron having all sides right triangles with sides 1, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Ludwig Schläfli studied 
 
 
 
  as a special case of the orthoscheme, and H. S. M. Coxeter called it the characteristic tetrahedron of the cubic spacefilling.
Properties

A cube can be tiled with 6 copies of 
 
 
 
 .
Every 
 
 
 
  can be dissected into three polytopes which can be reassembled into a prism.

Generalizations
In 1951 Hugo Hadwiger found the following n-dimensional generalization of Hill tetrahedra:


 
  where vectors 
 
 
 
  satisfy 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and where 
 
 
 
 . Hadwiger showed that all such simplices are scissor congruent to a hypercube.
