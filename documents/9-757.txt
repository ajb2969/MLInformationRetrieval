   Rotor (mathematics)      Rotor (mathematics)   A rotor is an object in geometric algebra that rotates any blade or general multivector about the origin . They are normally motivated by considering an even number of reflections , which generate rotations (see also the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem ).  Generation using reflections  General formulation  Reflections along a vector in geometric algebra may be represented as (minus) sandwiching a multivector M between a non-null vector v perpendicular to the hyperplane of reflection and that vector's inverse  v −1 :  $$-vMv^{-1}$$  and are of even grade. Under a rotation generated by the rotor R , a general multivector M will transform double-sidedly as  $$RMR^{-1}.$$  Restricted alternative formulation  For a Euclidean space , it may be convenient to consider an alternative formulation, and some authors define the operation of reflection as (minus) the sandwiching of a unit (i.e. normalized) multivector:  $$-vMv, \quad v^2=1 ,$$ forming rotors that are automatically normalised:  $$R\tilde{R}=\tilde{R}R=1 .$$ The derived rotor action is then expressed as a sandwich product with the reverse:  $$RM\tilde{R}$$ For a reflection for which the associated vector squares to a negative scalar, as may be the case with a pseudo-Euclidean space , such a vector can only be normalized up to the sign of its square, and additional bookkeeping of the sign of the application the rotor becomes necessary. The formulation in terms of the sandwich product with the inverse as above suffers no such shortcoming.  Rotations of multivectors and spinors  However, though as multivectors rotors also transform double-sidedly, rotors can be combined and form a group , and so multiple rotors compose single-sidedly. The alternative formulation above is not self-normalizing and motivates the definition of spinor in geometric algebra as an object that transforms single-sidedly – i.e. spinors may be regarded as non-normalised rotors in which the reverse rather than the inverse is used in the sandwich product.  Homogeneous representation algebras  In homogeneous representation algebras such as conformal geometric algebra , a rotor in the representation space corresponds to a rotation about an arbitrary point , a translation or possibly another transformation in the base space.
