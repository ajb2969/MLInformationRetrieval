   Macrolide 2'-kinase      Macrolide 2'-kinase   In enzymology , a macrolide 2'-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + oleandomycin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + oleandomycin 2'-O-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and oleandomycin , whereas its two products are ADP and oleandomycin 2'-O-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:macrolide 2'-O-phosphotransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
