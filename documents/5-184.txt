   Vector algebra      Vector algebra   In mathematics, vector algebra may mean:   Linear algebra , specifically the basic algebraic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication; see vector space .  The algebraic operations in vector calculus , namely the specific additional structure of vectors in 3-dimensional Euclidean space     ùêë  3     superscript  ùêë  3    \mathbf{R}^{3}   of dot product and especially cross product . In this sense, vector algebra is contrasted with geometric algebra , which provides an alternative generalization to higher dimensions.  Original vector algebras of the nineteenth century like quaternions , tessarines , or coquaternions , each of which has its own product . The vector algebras biquaternions and hyperbolic quaternions enabled the revolution in physics called special relativity by providing mathematical models.   "  Category:Algebra
