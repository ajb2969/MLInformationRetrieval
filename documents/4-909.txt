   Observability      Observability   In control theory , observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals . The concept of observability was introduced by American-Hungarian engineer Rudolf E. Kalman for linear dynamic systems. 1 2  Definition  Formally, a system is said to be observable if, for any possible sequence of state and control vectors, the current state can be determined in finite time using only the outputs (this definition is slanted towards the state space representation). Less formally, this means that from the system's outputs it is possible to determine the behaviour of the entire system. If a system is not observable, this means the current values of some of its states cannot be determined through output sensors . This implies that their value is unknown to the controller (although they can be estimated through various means).  For time-invariant linear systems in the state space representation, there is a convenient test to check if a system is observable. Consider a SISO system with   n   n   n   states (see state space for details about MIMO systems), if the row rank of the following observability matrix      𝒪  =   [     C       C  A        C   A  2        ⋮       C   A   n  -  1        ]       𝒪    C      C  A       C   superscript  A  2      normal-⋮      C   superscript  A    n  1         \mathcal{O}=\begin{bmatrix}C\\
 CA\\
 CA^{2}\\
 \vdots\\
 CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix}     is equal to   n   n   n   , then the system is observable. The rationale for this test is that if   n   n   n   rows are linearly independent, then each of the   n   n   n   states is viewable through linear combinations of the output variables    y   (  k  )       y  k    y(k)   .  A module designed to estimate the state of a system from measurements of the outputs is called a state observer or simply an observer for that system.   Observability index   The Observability index   v   v   v   of a linear time-invariant discrete system is the smallest natural number for which is satisfied that     rank   (   O  v   )    =   rank   (   O   v  +  1    )          rank   subscript  O  v      rank   subscript  O    v  1       \text{rank}{(O_{v})}=\text{rank}{(O_{v+1})}   , where        𝒪  v   =   [     C       C  A        C   A  2        ⋮       C   A   v  -  1        ]    .       subscript  𝒪  v     C      C  A       C   superscript  A  2      normal-⋮      C   superscript  A    v  1         \mathcal{O}_{v}=\begin{bmatrix}C\\
 CA\\
 CA^{2}\\
 \vdots\\
 CA^{v-1}\end{bmatrix}.      Detectability   A slightly weaker notion than observability is detectability. A system is detectable if and only if all of its unobservable modes are asymptotically stable. Thus even though not all system modes are observable, the ones that are not observable do not require stabilization.  Continuous time-varying system  Consider the continuous  linear  time-variant system        𝐱  ˙    (  t  )    =    A   (  t  )   𝐱   (  t  )    +   B   (  t  )   𝐮   (  t  )            normal-˙  𝐱   t       A  t  𝐱  t     B  t  𝐮  t      \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=A(t)\mathbf{x}(t)+B(t)\mathbf{u}(t)\,           𝐲   (  t  )    =   C   (  t  )   𝐱   (  t  )     .        𝐲  t     C  t  𝐱  t     \mathbf{y}(t)=C(t)\mathbf{x}(t).\,     Suppose that the matrices    A  ,  B  ,   and  C      A  B    and  C     A,B,\text{ and }C   are given as well as inputs and outputs    u  and  y      u  and  y    u\text{ and }y   for all    t  ∈   [   t  0   ,   t  1   ]       t    subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1      t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]   then it is possible to determine    x   (   t  0   )       x   subscript  t  0     x(t_{0})   to within an additive constant vector which lies in the null space of    M   (   t  0   ,   t  1   )       M    subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1      M(t_{0},t_{1})   defined by       M   (   t  0   ,   t  1   )    =    ∫   t  0    t  1     ϕ    (  t  ,   t  0   )   T   C    (  t  )   T   C   (  t  )   ϕ   (  t  ,   t  0   )   d  t          M    subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1       superscript   subscript    subscript  t  0     subscript  t  1      ϕ   superscript   t   subscript  t  0    T   C   superscript  t  T   C  t  ϕ   t   subscript  t  0    d  t      M(t_{0},t_{1})=\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\phi(t,t_{0})^{T}C(t)^{T}C(t)\phi(t,t_{0})dt   where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the state-transition matrix .  It is possible to determine a unique    x   (   t  0   )       x   subscript  t  0     x(t_{0})   if    M   (   t  0   ,   t  1   )       M    subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1      M(t_{0},t_{1})   is nonsingular . In fact, it is not possible to distinguish the initial state for    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   from that of    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   if     x  1   -   x  2        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     x_{1}-x_{2}   is in the null space of    M   (   t  0   ,   t  1   )       M    subscript  t  0    subscript  t  1      M(t_{0},t_{1})   .

In the nonlinear case, observability can be characterized for individual variables, and also for local estimator behavior rather than just global behavior.
