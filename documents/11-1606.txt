   Selenide, water dikinase      Selenide, water dikinase   In enzymology , a selenide, water dikinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + selenide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + selenophosphate + phosphate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , selenide , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are AMP , selenophosphate , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific, those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with paired acceptors ( dikinases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:selenide, water phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called selenophosphate synthetase . This enzyme participates in selenoamino acid metabolism .
