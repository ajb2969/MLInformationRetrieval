   Non-autonomous system (mathematics)      Non-autonomous system (mathematics)   In mathematics, an autonomous system is a dynamic equation on a smooth manifold . A non-autonomous system is a dynamic equation on a smooth fiber bundle     Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   over   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . For instance, this is the case of non-autonomous mechanics .  An r -order differential equation on a fiber bundle    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   is represented by a closed subbundle of a jet bundle      J  r   Q       superscript  J  r   Q    J^{r}Q   of    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   . A dynamic equation on    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   is a differential equation which is algebraically solved for a higher-order derivatives.  In particular, a first-order dynamic equation on a fiber bundle    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   is a kernel of the covariant differential of some connection   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   on    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   . Given bundle coordinates    (  t  ,   q  i   )     t   superscript  q  i     (t,q^{i})   on   Q   Q   Q   and the adapted coordinates    (  t  ,   q  i   ,   q  t  i   )     t   superscript  q  i    subscript   superscript  q  i   t     (t,q^{i},q^{i}_{t})   on a first-order jet manifold     J  1   Q       superscript  J  1   Q    J^{1}Q   , a first-order dynamic equation reads        q  t  i   =   Γ   (  t  ,   q  i   )     .       subscript   superscript  q  i   t     normal-Γ   t   superscript  q  i       q^{i}_{t}=\Gamma(t,q^{i}).     For instance, this is the case of Hamiltonian non-autonomous mechanics .  A second-order dynamic equation       q   t  t   i   =    ξ  i    (  t  ,   q  j   ,   q  t  j   )         subscript   superscript  q  i     t  t       superscript  ξ  i    t   superscript  q  j    subscript   superscript  q  j   t       q^{i}_{tt}=\xi^{i}(t,q^{j},q^{j}_{t})     on    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   is defined as a holonomic connection   ξ   ξ   \xi   on a jet bundle      J  1   Q   →  ℝ     normal-→     superscript  J  1   Q   ℝ    J^{1}Q\to\mathbb{R}   . This equation also is represented by a connection on an affine jet bundle      J  1   Q   →  Q     normal-→     superscript  J  1   Q   Q    J^{1}Q\to Q   . Due to the canonical imbedding      J  1   Q   →   T  Q      normal-→     superscript  J  1   Q     T  Q     J^{1}Q\to TQ   , it is equivalent to a geodesic equation on the tangent bundle    T  Q      T  Q    TQ   of   Q   Q   Q   . A free motion equation in non-autonomous mechanics exemplifies a second-order non-autonomous dynamic equation.
