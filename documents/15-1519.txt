Non-autonomous system (mathematics)

In mathematics, an autonomous system is a dynamic equation on a smooth manifold. A non-autonomous system is a dynamic equation on a smooth fiber bundle

 
  over 
 
 
 
 . For instance, this is the case of non-autonomous mechanics.
An r-order differential equation on a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
  is represented by a closed subbundle of a jet bundle

 
  of 
 
 
 
 . A dynamic equation on 
 
 
 
  is a differential equation which is algebraically solved for a higher-order derivatives.
In particular, a first-order dynamic equation on a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
  is a kernel of the covariant differential of some connection 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Given bundle coordinates 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and the adapted coordinates 
 
 
 
  on a first-order jet manifold 
 
 
 
 , a first-order dynamic equation reads



For instance, this is the case of  Hamiltonian non-autonomous mechanics.
A second-order dynamic equation



on 
 
 
 
  is defined as a holonomic connection 
 
 
 
  on a jet bundle 
 
 
 
 . This equation also is represented by a connection on an affine jet bundle 
 
 
 
 . Due to the canonical imbedding 
 
 
 
 , it is equivalent to a geodesic equation on the tangent bundle 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . A free motion equation in non-autonomous mechanics exemplifies a second-order non-autonomous dynamic equation.
