   Non-Hausdorff manifold      Non-Hausdorff manifold   In mathematics , it is a usual axiom of a manifold to be a Hausdorff space , and this is assumed throughout geometry and topology : "manifold" means "( second countable ) Hausdorff manifold".  In general topology , this axiom is relaxed, and one studies non-Hausdorff manifolds : spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space , but not necessarily Hausdorff.  Examples  Line with two origins  The most familiar non-Hausdorff manifold is the line with two origins , or bug-eyed line .  This is the quotient space of two copies of the real line   R × { a } and R × { b }   with the equivalence relation       (  x  ,  a  )   ∼    (  x  ,  b  )   if  x   ≠   0.        similar-to   x  a      x  b   if  x        0.     (x,a)\sim(x,b)\text{ if }x\neq 0.\;     This space has a single point for each nonzero real number r and two points 0 a and 0 b . In this space all neighbourhoods of 0 a intersect all neighbourhoods of 0 b , so it is non-Hausdorff.  Further, the line with two origins does not have the homotopy type of a CW-complex , or of any Hausdorff space. 1  Branching line  Similar to the line with two origins is the branching line .  This is the quotient space of two copies of the real line   R × { a } and R × { b }   with the equivalence relation       (  x  ,  a  )   ∼    (  x  ,  b  )   if  x   <   0.        similar-to   x  a      x  b   if  x        0.     (x,a)\sim(x,b)\text{ if }x<0.\;     This space has a single point for each negative real number r and two points     x  a   ,   x  b       subscript  x  a    subscript  x  b     x_{a},x_{b}   for every non-negative number: it has a "fork" at zero.  Etale space  The etale space of a sheaf , such as the sheaf of continuous real functions over a manifold, is a manifold that is often non-Hausdorff. (The etale space is Hausdorff if it is a sheaf of functions with some sort of analytic continuation property.)
