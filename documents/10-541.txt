   Histidinol dehydrogenase      Histidinol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a histidinol dehydrogenase (HIS4) (HDH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-histidinol + 2 NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-histidine + 2 NADH + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-histidinol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are L-histidine , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-histidinol:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called L-histidinol dehydrogenase .  Histidinol dehydrogenase catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of histidine in bacteria , fungi , and plants , the four- electron  oxidation of L-histidinol to histidine.  In 4-electron dehydrogenases, a single active site  catalyses 2 separate oxidation steps: oxidation of the substrate  alcohol to an intermediate  aldehyde ; and oxidation of the aldehyde to the product acid, in this case His. 1 The reaction proceeds via a tightly- or covalently-bound inter-mediate, and requires the presence of 2 NAD molecules . 2 By contrast with most dehydrogenases , the substrate is bound before the NAD  coenzyme . 3 A Cys residue has been implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the second oxidative step. 4  In bacteria HDH is a single chain polypeptide; in fungi it is the C-terminal domain of a multifunctional enzyme which catalyses three different steps of histidine biosynthesis; and in plants it is expressed as a nuclear encoded protein  precursor which is exported to the chloroplast . 5 6 7  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
