   Effusion      Effusion   (Figure)  Effusion|The image in the left shows effusion, where the image on the right shows diffusion. Effusion occurs through an orifice smaller than the mean path of the particles in motion where diffusion occurs through an opening in which multiple particles can flow through simultaneously.   Effusion is the process in which a gas escapes through a small hole. This occurs if the diameter of the hole is considerably smaller than the mean free path of the molecules. 1 According to Graham's law , the rate at which gases effuse (i.e., how many molecules pass through the hole per second) is dependent on their molecular weight. Gases with a higher molecular weight effuse more slowly than gases with a lower molecular weight; the number of smaller molecules escaping will be greater but the mass of the larger molecules will be greater. For two gases at the same temperature   T   T   T   , and thus having the same kinetic energy, 2 the root mean square molecular speed,    v  rms     subscript  v  rms    v_{\rm rms}   , of each gas can be found using the equation        3  2    k  B   T   =    1  2   m   v  rms  2            3  2    subscript  k  normal-B   T       1  2   m   superscript   subscript  v  rms   2      \frac{3}{2}k_{\rm B}T=\frac{1}{2}mv_{\rm rms}^{2}     where    k  B     subscript  k  normal-B    k_{\rm B}   is the Boltzmann constant . Thus, lighter molecules have a higher speed. This results in more molecules passing through the hole per unit time. This is why a balloon filled with low molecular weight helium deflates faster than an equivalent balloon full of higher molecular weight oxygen .  Application to thermodynamics  Thomas Graham (1805–1869), a Scottish chemist, found experimentally that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles. 3 In other words, the relative rates of effusion of two gases at the same temperature and pressure are given by the inverse ratio of the square roots of the masses of the gas particles. The equation is given by        Rate of effusion of gas  1    Rate of effusion of gas  2    =     M  2    M  1            subscript  Rate of effusion of gas  1    subscript  Rate of effusion of gas  2         subscript  M  2    subscript  M  1       {\mbox{Rate of effusion of gas}_{1}\over\mbox{Rate of effusion of gas}_{2}}=%
 \sqrt{M_{2}\over M_{1}}   where    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   and    M  2     subscript  M  2    M_{2}   represent the molar masses of the gases. This equation is known as Graham's law of effusion .  The effusion rate for a gas depends directly on the average velocity of its particles. Thus, the faster the gas particles are moving, the more likely they are to pass through the effusion orifice. A figure of Graham's law of effusion linked below shows the rate of effusion (the rate at which the gas is transferred across the barrier through the pin hole) is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the gas molecules. 4  References  "  Category:Physical chemistry  Category:Gases     K.J.
