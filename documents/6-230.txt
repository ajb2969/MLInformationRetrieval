   Point process      Point process   In statistics and probability theory , a point process is a type of random process for which any one realisation consists of a set of isolated points either in time or geographical space, or in even more general spaces. For example, the occurrence of lightning strikes might be considered as a point process in both time and geographical space if each is recorded according to its location in time and space.  Point processes are well studied objects in probability theory 1 2 and the subject of powerful tools in statistics for modeling and analyzing spatial data , 3 4 which is of interest in such diverse disciplines as forestry, plant ecology, epidemiology, geography, seismology, materials science, astronomy, telecommunications, computational neuroscience, 5 economics 6 and others.  Point processes on the real line form an important special case that is particularly amenable to study, 7 because the points are ordered in a natural way, and the whole point process can be described completely by the (random) intervals between the points. These point processes are frequently used as models for random events in time, such as the arrival of customers in a queue ( queueing theory ), of impulses in a neuron ( computational neuroscience ), particles in a Geiger counter , location of radio stations in a telecommunication network 8 or of searches on the world-wide web .  General point process theory  In mathematics, a point process is a random element whose values are "point patterns" on a set  S . While in the exact mathematical definition a point pattern is specified as a locally finite  counting measure , it is sufficient for more applied purposes to think of a point pattern as a countable subset of S that has no limit points .  Definition  Let S be a locally compact  second countable  Hausdorff space equipped with its Borel σ-algebra  B ( S ). Write   𝔑   𝔑   \mathfrak{N}   for the set of locally finite counting measures on S and   𝒩   𝒩   \mathcal{N}   for the smallest σ-algebra on   𝔑   𝔑   \mathfrak{N}   that renders all the point counts       Φ  B   :    𝔑  →   ℤ  +    ,   ϱ  ↦   ϱ   (  B  )         normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ  B    formulae-sequence   normal-→  𝔑   subscript  ℤ      maps-to  ϱ    ϱ  B       \Phi_{B}:\mathfrak{N}\to\mathbb{Z}_{+},\varrho\mapsto\varrho(B)     for relatively compact sets  B in B measurable. A point process on S is a measurable map      ξ  :   Ω  →  𝔑      normal-:  ξ   normal-→  normal-Ω  𝔑     \xi:\Omega\to\mathfrak{N}     from a probability space     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  P  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  P    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)   to the measurable space     (  𝔑  ,  𝒩  )     𝔑  𝒩    (\mathfrak{N},\mathcal{N})   .  By this definition, a point process is a special case of a random measure .  The most common example for the state space S is the Euclidean space R n or a subset thereof, where a particularly interesting special case is given by the real half-line [0,∞). However, point processes are not limited to these examples and may among other things also be used if the points are themselves compact subsets of R n , in which case ξ is usually referred to as a particle process .  It has been noted that the term point process is not a very good one if S is not a subset of the real line, as it might suggest that ξ is a stochastic process . However, the term is well established and uncontested even in the general case.  Representation  Every point process ξ can be represented as       ξ  =    ∑   i  =  1   N    δ   X  i      ,      ξ    superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  δ   subscript  X  i       \xi=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta_{X_{i}},     where   δ   δ   \delta   denotes the Dirac measure , N is an integer-valued random variable and    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   are random elements of S . If    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   's are almost surely distinct (or equivalently, almost surely     ξ   (  x  )    ≤  1        ξ  x   1    \xi(x)\leq 1   for all    x  ∈   ℝ  d       x   superscript  ℝ  d     x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}   ), then the point process is known as simple .  Expectation measure  The expectation measure  Eξ (also known as mean measure ) of a point process ξ is a measure on S that assigns to every Borel subset B of S the expected number of points of ξ in B . That is,         E  ξ   (  B  )    :=   E   (   ξ   (  B  )    )       for every  B   ∈  ℬ    .     formulae-sequence   assign    E  ξ  B     E    ξ  B         for every  B   ℬ     E\xi(B):=E\bigl(\xi(B)\bigr)\quad\text{for every }B\in\mathcal{B}.     Laplace functional  The Laplace functional      Ψ  N    (  f  )        subscript  normal-Ψ  N   f    \Psi_{N}(f)   of a point process N is a map from the set of all positive valued functions f on the state space of N , to    [  0  ,  ∞  )     0     [0,\infty)   defined as follows:        Ψ  N    (  f  )    =   E   [   exp   (   -   N   (  f  )     )    ]           subscript  normal-Ψ  N   f     E   delimited-[]        N  f         \Psi_{N}(f)=E[\exp(-N(f))]     They play a similar role as the characteristic functions for random variable . One important theorem says that: two point processes have the same law iff their Laplace functionals are equal.  Moment measure  The   n   n   n   th power of a point process,     ξ  n   ,     superscript  ξ  n    \xi^{n},   is defined on the product space    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   as follows :        ξ  n    (    A  1   ×  ⋯  ×   A  n    )    =    ∏   i  =  1   n    ξ   (   A  i   )            superscript  ξ  n      subscript  A  1   normal-⋯   subscript  A  n       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n     ξ   subscript  A  i       \xi^{n}(A_{1}\times\cdots\times A_{n})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\xi(A_{i})     By monotone class theorem , this uniquely defines the product measure on     (   S  n   ,   B   (   S  n   )    )   .      superscript  S  n     B   superscript  S  n      (S^{n},B(S^{n})).   The expectation    E   ξ  n    (  ⋅  )       E   superscript  ξ  n   normal-⋅    E\xi^{n}(\cdot)   is called the   n   n   n   th moment measure . The first moment measure is the mean measure.  Let    S  =   ℝ  d       S   superscript  ℝ  d     S=\mathbb{R}^{d}   . The joint intensities of a point process   ξ   ξ   \xi   w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure are functions     ρ   (  k  )    :     (   ℝ  d   )   k   →   [  0  ,  ∞  )       normal-:   superscript  ρ  k    normal-→   superscript   superscript  ℝ  d   k    0       \rho^{(k)}:(\mathbb{R}^{d})^{k}\to[0,\infty)   such that for any disjoint bounded Borel subsets     B  1   ,  …  ,   B  k       subscript  B  1   normal-…   subscript  B  k     B_{1},\ldots,B_{k}           E   (    ∏  i    ξ   (   B  i   )     )    =    ∫    B  1   ×  ⋯  ×   B  k       ρ   (  k  )     (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )   d   x  1   ⋯  d   x  k      .        E    subscript  product  i     ξ   subscript  B  i        subscript      subscript  B  1   normal-⋯   subscript  B  k        superscript  ρ  k     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k    d   subscript  x  1   normal-⋯  d   subscript  x  k       E\left(\prod_{i}\xi(B_{i})\right)=\int_{B_{1}\times\cdots\times B_{k}}\rho^{(k%
 )}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})\,dx_{1}\cdots dx_{k}.     Joint intensities do not always exist for point processes. Given that moments of a random variable determine the random variable in many cases, a similar result is to be expected for joint intensities. Indeed, this has been shown in many cases. 9  Stationarity  A point process    ξ  ⊂   ℝ  d       ξ   superscript  ℝ  d     \xi\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   is said to be stationary if     ξ  +  x   :=    ∑   i  =  1   N    δ    X  i   +  x        assign    ξ  x     superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  δ     subscript  X  i   x       \xi+x:=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta_{X_{i}+x}   has the same distribution as   ξ   ξ   \xi   for all     x  ∈   ℝ  d    .      x   superscript  ℝ  d     x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}.   For a stationary point process, the mean measure    E  ξ   (  ⋅  )   =  λ  ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  E  ξ   fragments  normal-(  normal-⋅  normal-)    λ  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    E\xi(\cdot)=\lambda\|\cdot\|   for some constant    λ  ≥  0      λ  0    \lambda\geq 0   and where    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   stands for the Lebesgue measure. This   λ   λ   \lambda   is called the intensity of the point process. A stationary point process on    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   has almost surely either 0 or an infinite number of points in total. For more on stationary point processes and random measure, refer to Chapter 12 of Daley & Vere-Jones. 10 It is to be noted that stationarity has been defined and studied for point processes in more general spaces than    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   .  Examples of point processes  We shall see some examples of point processes in     ℝ  d   .     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}.     Poisson point process  The simplest and most ubiquitous example of a point process is the Poisson point process , which is a spatial generalisation of the Poisson process . A Poisson (counting) process on the line can be characterised by two properties : the number of points (or events) in disjoint intervals are independent and have a Poisson distribution . A Poisson point process can also be defined using these two properties. Namely, we say that a point process   ξ   ξ   \xi   is a Poisson point process if the following two conditions hold  1)     ξ   (   B  1   )    ,  …  ,   ξ   (   B  n   )         ξ   subscript  B  1    normal-…    ξ   subscript  B  n      \xi(B_{1}),\ldots,\xi(B_{n})   are independent for disjoint subsets      B  1   ,  …  ,   B  n    .      subscript  B  1   normal-…   subscript  B  n     B_{1},\ldots,B_{n}.     2) For any bounded subset   B   B   B   ,    ξ   (  B  )       ξ  B    \xi(B)   has a Poisson distribution with parameter     λ   ∥  B  ∥    ,      λ   norm  B     \lambda\|B\|,   where    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   denotes the Lebesgue measure .  The two conditions can be combined together and written as follows : For any disjoint bounded subsets     B  1   ,  …  ,   B  n       subscript  B  1   normal-…   subscript  B  n     B_{1},\ldots,B_{n}   and non-negative integers     k  1   ,  …  ,   k  n       subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  n     k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}   we have that        Pr   [    ξ   (   B  i   )    =   k  i    ,   1  ≤  i  ≤  n   ]    =    ∏  i     e   -   λ   ∥   B  i   ∥         (   λ   ∥   B  i   ∥    )    k  i      k  i   !       .       Pr      ξ   subscript  B  i     subscript  k  i        1  i       n       subscript  product  i      superscript  e      λ   norm   subscript  B  i          superscript    λ   norm   subscript  B  i      subscript  k  i       subscript  k  i         \Pr[\xi(B_{i})=k_{i},1\leq i\leq n]=\prod_{i}e^{-\lambda\|B_{i}\|}\frac{(%
 \lambda\|B_{i}\|)^{k_{i}}}{k_{i}!}.     The constant   λ   λ   \lambda   is called the intensity of the Poisson point process. Note that the Poisson point process is characterised by the single parameter    λ  .    λ   \lambda.   It is a simple, stationary point process. To be more specific one calls the above point process, an homogeneous Poisson point process. An inhomogeneous Poisson process is defined as above but by replacing    λ   ∥  B  ∥       λ   norm  B     \lambda\|B\|   with           ∫  B    λ   (  x  )   d  x        superscript  absent  absent   absent    subscript   B     λ  x  d  x      \stackrel{}{}\int_{B}\lambda(x)\,dx   where   λ   λ   \lambda   is a non-negative function on     ℝ  d   .     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}.     Cox point process  A Cox process (named after Sir David Cox ) is a generalisation of the Poisson point process, in that we use random measures in place of    λ   ∥  B  ∥       λ   norm  B     \lambda\|B\|   . More formally, let   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   be a random measure . A Cox point process driven by the random measure    Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   is the point process   ξ   ξ   \xi   with the following two properties :   Given    Λ   (  ⋅  )       normal-Λ  normal-⋅    \Lambda(\cdot)   ,    ξ   (  B  )       ξ  B    \xi(B)   is Poisson distributed with parameter    Λ   (  B  )       normal-Λ  B    \Lambda(B)   for any bounded subset    B  .    B   B.     For any finite collection of disjoint subsets     B  1   ,  …  ,   B  n       subscript  B  1   normal-…   subscript  B  n     B_{1},\ldots,B_{n}   and conditioned on      Λ   (   B  1   )    ,  …  ,   Λ   (   B  n   )     ,       normal-Λ   subscript  B  1    normal-…    normal-Λ   subscript  B  n      \Lambda(B_{1}),\ldots,\Lambda(B_{n}),   we have that     ξ   (   B  1   )    ,  …  ,   ξ   (   B  n   )         ξ   subscript  B  1    normal-…    ξ   subscript  B  n      \xi(B_{1}),\ldots,\xi(B_{n})   are independent.   It is easy to see that Poisson point process (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) follow as special cases of Cox point processes. The mean measure of a Cox point process is     E  ξ   (  ⋅  )    =   E  Λ   (  ⋅  )          E  ξ  normal-⋅     E  normal-Λ  normal-⋅     E\xi(\cdot)=E\Lambda(\cdot)   and thus in the special case of a Poisson point process, it is    λ  ∥  ⋅  ∥  .     fragments  λ  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to  normal-.    \lambda\|\cdot\|.     For a Cox point process,    Λ   (  ⋅  )       normal-Λ  normal-⋅    \Lambda(\cdot)   is called the intensity measure . Further, if    Λ   (  ⋅  )       normal-Λ  normal-⋅    \Lambda(\cdot)   has a (random) density ( Radon–Nikodym derivative )    λ   (  ⋅  )       λ  normal-⋅    \lambda(\cdot)   i.e.,        Λ   (  B  )     =  a.s.     ∫  B    λ   (  x  )   d  x     ,      superscript   a.s.     normal-Λ  B     subscript   B     λ  x  d  x      \Lambda(B)\stackrel{\text{a.s.}}{=}\int_{B}\lambda(x)\,dx,   then    λ   (  ⋅  )       λ  normal-⋅    \lambda(\cdot)   is called the intensity field of the Cox point process. Stationarity of the intensity measures or intensity fields imply the stationarity of the corresponding Cox point processes.  There have been many specific classes of Cox point processes that have been studied in detail such as:   Log Gaussian Cox point processes: 11      λ   (  y  )    =   exp   (   X   (  y  )    )          λ  y       X  y      \lambda(y)=\exp(X(y))   for a Gaussian random field     X   (  .  )      fragments  X   fragments  normal-(  normal-.  normal-)     X(.)

Thus points are distributed with greater variability in a Cox point process compared to a Poisson point process. This is sometimes called clustering or attractive property of the Cox point process.  Determinantal point processes  An important class of point processes, with applications to physics , random matrix theory , and combinatorics , is that of determinantal point processes . 16  Point processes on the real half-line  Historically the first point processes that were studied had the real half line R + = [0,∞) as their state space, which in this context is usually interpreted as time. These studies were motivated by the wish to model telecommunication systems, 17 in which the points represented events in time, such as calls to a telephone exchange.  Point processes on R + are typically described by giving the sequence of their (random) inter-event times ( T 1 , T 2 , ...), from which the actual sequence ( X 1 , X 2 , ...) of event times can be obtained as        X  k   =    ∑   j  =  1   k    T  j       for  k   ≥  1.      formulae-sequence     subscript  X  k     superscript   subscript     j  1    k    subscript  T  j         for  k   1.     X_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}T_{j}\quad\text{for }k\geq 1.     If the inter-event times are independent and identically distributed, the point process obtained is called a renewal process .  Conditional intensity function  The conditional intensity function of a point process on the real half-line is a function λ ( t | H t ) defined as      λ   (  t  ∣   H  t   )   =   lim    Δ  t   →  0     1   Δ  t    P   (   One event occurs in the time-interval    [  t  ,  t  +  Δ  t  ]   ∣   H  t   )   ,     fragments  λ   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-∣   subscript  H  t   normal-)     subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  t   0      1    normal-Δ  t    P   fragments  normal-(  One event occurs in the time-interval   fragments  normal-[  t  normal-,  t   Δ  t  normal-]   normal-∣   subscript  H  t   normal-)   normal-,    \lambda(t\mid H_{t})=\lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{1}{\Delta t}{P}(\text{One event%
  occurs in the time-interval}\,[t,t+\Delta t]\mid H_{t}),     where H t denotes the history of event times preceding time t .  The compensator of a point process, also known as the dual-predictable projection , is the integrated conditional intensity function defined by      Λ   (  s  ,  u  )   =   ∫  s  u   λ   (  t  |   H  t   )   d  t     fragments  Λ   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-,  u  normal-)     superscript   subscript   s   u   λ   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-|   subscript  H  t   normal-)   d  t    \Lambda(s,u)=\int_{s}^{u}\lambda(t|H_{t})\mathrm{d}t     Papangelou intensity function  The Papangelou intensity function of a point process   N   N   N   in the   n   n   n   -dimensional Euclidean space    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   is defined as         λ  p    (  x  )    =    lim   δ  →  0      1   |    B  δ    (  x  )    |    P   {    One event occurs in    B  δ    (  x  )    ∣   σ   [   N  ∖   (    B  δ    (  x  )    )    ]    }      ,         subscript  λ  p   x     subscript    normal-→  δ  0        1       subscript  B  δ   x     P   conditional-set    One event occurs in   subscript  B  δ   x     σ   delimited-[]    N     subscript  B  δ   x           \lambda_{p}(x)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}\frac{1}{|B_{\delta}(x)|}{P}\{\text{One event%
  occurs in }\,B_{\delta}(x)\mid\sigma[N\setminus(B_{\delta}(x))]\},     where     B  δ    (  x  )        subscript  B  δ   x    B_{\delta}(x)   is the ball centered at   x   x   x   of a radius   δ   δ   \delta   , and    σ   [   N  ∖   (    B  δ    (  x  )    )    ]       σ   delimited-[]    N     subscript  B  δ   x       \sigma[N\setminus(B_{\delta}(x))]   denotes the information of the point process   N   N   N   outside     B  δ    (  x  )        subscript  B  δ   x    B_{\delta}(x)   .  Point processes in spatial statistics  The analysis of point pattern data in a compact subset S of R n is a major object of study within spatial statistics . Such data appear in a broad range of disciplines, 18 amongst which are   forestry and plant ecology (positions of trees or plants in general)  epidemiology (home locations of infected patients)  zoology (burrows or nests of animals)  geography (positions of human settlements, towns or cities)  seismology (epicenters of earthquakes)  materials science (positions of defects in industrial materials)  astronomy (locations of stars or galaxies)  computational neuroscience (spikes of neurons).   The need to use point processes to model these kinds of data lies in their inherent spatial structure. Accordingly, a first question of interest is often whether the given data exhibit complete spatial randomness (i.e. are a realization of a spatial Poisson process ) as opposed to exhibiting either spatial aggregation or spatial inhibition.  In contrast, many datasets considered in classical multivariate statistics consist of independently generated datapoints that may be governed by one or several covariates (typically non-spatial).  Apart from the applications in spatial statistics, point processes are one of the fundamental objects in stochastic geometry . Research has also focussed extensively on various models built on point processes such as Voronoi Tessellations, Random geometric graphs, Boolean model etc.  See also   Empirical measure  Random measure  Point process notation  Point process operation  Poisson process  Renewal theory   References    "  Category:Statistical data types  Category:Stochastic processes    Category:Spatial processes     Kallenberg, O.
