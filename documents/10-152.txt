   Magnetic anisotropy      Magnetic anisotropy   Magnetic anisotropy is the directional dependence of a material's magnetic properties. The magnetic moment of magnetically anisotropic materials will tend to align with an "easy axis", which is an energetically favorable direction of spontaneous magnetization . The two opposite directions along an easy axis are usually equivalent, and the actual direction of magnetization can be along either of them (see spontaneous symmetry breaking ).  In contrast, a magnetically isotropic material has no preferential direction for its magnetic moment unless there is an applied magnetic field .  Magnetic anisotropy is a prerequisite for hysteresis in ferromagnets : without it, a ferromagnet is superparamagnetic . 1  Sources  There are several sources of magnetic anisotropy: 2   Magnetocrystalline anisotropy : the atomic structure of a crystal introduces preferential directions for the magnetization .  Shape anisotropy: when a particle is not perfectly spherical, the demagnetizing field will not be equal for all directions, creating one or more easy axes.  Magnetoelastic anisotropy : tension may alter magnetic behaviour, leading to magnetic anisotropy.  Exchange anisotropy : occurs when antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic materials interact. 3   Anisotropy energy of a single-domain magnet  Suppose that a ferromagnet is single-domain in the strictest sense: the magnetization is uniform and rotates in unison. If the magnetic moment is   𝝁   𝝁   \scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\mu}   and the volume of the particle is   V   V   \scriptstyle V   , the magnetization is    𝐌  =   𝝁  /  V   =    M  s    (  α  ,  β  ,  γ  )          𝐌    𝝁  V           subscript  M  s    α  β  γ       \scriptstyle\mathbf{M}=\boldsymbol{\mu}/V=M_{s}\left(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\right)   , where    M  s     subscript  M  s    \scriptstyle M_{s}   is the saturation magnetization and    α  ,  β  ,  γ     α  β  γ    \scriptstyle\alpha,\beta,\gamma   are direction cosines (components of a unit vector ) so      α  2   +   β  2   +   γ  2    =  1         superscript  α  2    superscript  β  2    superscript  γ  2    1    \scriptstyle\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}+\gamma^{2}=1   . The energy associated with magnetic anisotropy can depend on the direction cosines in various ways, the most common of which are discussed below.  Uniaxial  A magnetic particle with uniaxial anisotropy has one easy axis. If the easy axis is in the   z   z   z   direction, the anisotropy energy can be expressed as one of the forms:       E  =   K  V   (   1  -   γ  2    )    =   K  V    sin  2   θ     ,        E    K  V    1   superscript  γ  2            K  V    superscript   2   θ       E=KV\left(1-\gamma^{2}\right)=KV\sin^{2}\theta,     where   V   V   \scriptstyle V   is the volume,   K   K   \scriptstyle K   the anisotropy constant, and   θ   θ   \scriptstyle\theta   the angle between the easy axis and the particle's magnetization. When shape anisotropy is explicitly considered, the symbol   𝒩   𝒩   \scriptstyle\mathcal{N}   is often used to indicate the anisotropy constant, instead of   K   K   \scriptstyle K   . In the widely used Stoner–Wohlfarth model , the anisotropy is uniaxial.  Triaxial  A magnetic particle with triaxial anisotropy still has a single easy axis, but it also has a hard axis (direction of maximum energy) and an intermediate axis (direction associated with a saddle point in the energy). The coordinates can be chosen so the energy has the form       E  =     K  a   V   α  2    +    K  b   V   β  2      .      E       subscript  K  a   V   superscript  α  2       subscript  K  b   V   superscript  β  2       \displaystyle E=K_{a}V\alpha^{2}+K_{b}V\beta^{2}.     If      K  a   >   K  b   >  0   ,         subscript  K  a    subscript  K  b        0     \scriptstyle K_{a}>K_{b}>0,   the easy axis is the   z   z   z   direction, the intermediate axis is the   y   y   y   direction and the hard axis is the   x   x   x   direction. 4  Cubic  A magnetic particle with cubic anisotropy has three or four easy axes, depending on the anisotropy parameters. The energy has the form       E  =   K  V   (     α  2    β  2    +    β  2    γ  2    +    γ  2    α  2     )     .      E    K  V       superscript  α  2    superscript  β  2       superscript  β  2    superscript  γ  2       superscript  γ  2    superscript  α  2        E=KV\left(\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}+\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}+\gamma^{2}\alpha^{2}\right).     If     K  >  0   ,      K  0    \scriptstyle K>0,   the easy axes are the     x  ,  y   ,     x  y    x,y,   and   z   z   z   axes. If     K  <  0   ,      K  0    \scriptstyle K<0,   there are four easy axes characterized by    x  =   ±  y   =   ±  z         x   plus-or-minus  y         plus-or-minus  z      x=\pm y=\pm z   .
