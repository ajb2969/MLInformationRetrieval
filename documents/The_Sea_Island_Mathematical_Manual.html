<h1>The Sea Island Mathematical Manual</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><em>The Sea Island Mathematical Manual</em></strong> or <em>Haidao suanjing</em> (海岛算经) was written by the <a href="Chinese_mathematics" title="wikilink">Chinese mathematician</a> <a href="Liu_Hui" title="wikilink">Liu Hui</a> of the <a href="Three_Kingdoms" title="wikilink">Three Kingdoms</a> era (220–280) as an extension of chapter 9 of <em><a href="The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art" title="wikilink">The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> During the <a href="Tang_Dynasty" title="wikilink">Tang Dynasty</a>, this appendix was taken out from <em>The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</em> as a separate book, titled <em>Haidao suanjing</em> (<em>Sea Island Mathematical Manual</em>), named after problem No 1 "Looking at a sea island." In the time of the early Tang dynasty, <em>The Sea Island Mathematical Manual</em> was selected into one of <a href="The_Ten_Computational_Canons" title="wikilink">The Ten Computational Canons</a> as the official mathematical texts for imperial examinations in mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p> This book contained many practical problems of surveying using geometry. This work provided detailed instructions on how to measure distances and heights with tall surveyor's poles and horizontal bars fixed at right angles to them. The unit of measurement was 1 li = 180 <a href="zhang_(unit)" title="wikilink">zhang</a>= 1800<a href="chi_(unit)" title="wikilink">chi</a>, 1 zhang = 10 chi, 1 chi = 10 <a href="cun_(unit)" title="wikilink">cun</a>, 1 step(<a href="Chinese_units_of_measurement" title="wikilink">bu</a>) = 6 chi. Calculation was carried out with place value decimal <a href="Rod_calculus" title="wikilink">Rod calculus</a>.</p>

<p>Liu Hui used his rectangle in right angle triangle theorem as the mathematical basis for survey. With his "In-out-complement" principle, he proved that the area of two inscribed rectangles in the two complementary right angle triangles have equal area, thus</p>

<p>''Q: Now surveying a sea island, set up two three zhang poles at one thousand steps apart, let the two poles and the island in a straight line. Step back from the front post 123 steps, with eye on ground level, the tip of the pole is on a straight line with the peak of island. Step back 127 steps from the rear pole, eye on ground level also aligns with the tip of pole and tip of island. What is the height of the island, and what is the distance to the pole ?</p>

<p>''A: The height of the island is four li and 55 steps, and it is 120 li and 50 steps from the pole.</p>

<p><em>Algorithm: Let the numerator equals to the height of pole multiplied by the separation of poles, let denominator be the difference of ofsets, add the quotient to the height of pole to obtain the height of island.</em></p>

<p>As the distance of front pole to the island could not be measured directly, Liu Hui set up two poles of same height at a known distance apart and made two measurements. The pole was perpendicular to the ground, eye view from ground level when the tip of pole was on a straight line sight with the peak of island, the distance of eye to the pole was called front ofset =DG, similarly, the back ofset =FH, difference of ofsets =FH-DG.</p>

<p> <em>A pine of unknown height on a hill. Set up two poles of two zhang each, one at front and one at the rear 50 steps in between. Let the rear pole aligns with the front pole. Step back 7 steps and 4 chi, view the tip of pine tree from the ground till it aligns in a straight line with the tip of the pole. Then view the tree trunk, the line of sight intersects the poles at 2 chi and 8 cun from its tip . Step back 8 steps and 5 chi from the rear pole, the view from ground also aligns with tree top and pole top. What is the height of the pine tree, and what is its distance from the pole ?</em> <em>Answer: the height of the pine is 11 zhang 2 chi 8 cun, the distance of mountain from the pole is 1 li and 28 and four seventh steps.</em></p>

<p><em>Algorithm: let the numerator be the product of separation of the poles and intersection from tip of pole, let the denominator be the difference of offsets. Add the height of pole to the quotient to obtain the height of pine tree.</em></p>
