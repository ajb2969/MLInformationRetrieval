Adjoint filter

In signal processing, the adjoint filter mask

 
  of a filter mask

 
  is reversed in time and the elements are complex conjugated.



Its name is derived from the fact, that the convolution with the adjoint filter is the adjoint operator of the original filter with respect to the Hilbert space

 
  of the sequences with respect to the Euclidean norm.



The autocorrelation of a signal 
 
 
 
  can be written as
