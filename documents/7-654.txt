   Moment map      Moment map   In mathematics , specifically in symplectic geometry , the momentum map (or moment map ) is a tool associated with a Hamiltonian  action of a Lie group on a symplectic manifold , used to construct conserved quantities for the action. The moment map generalizes the classical notions of linear and angular momentum . It is an essential ingredient in various constructions of symplectic manifolds, including symplectic ( Marsden–Weinstein ) quotients , discussed below, and symplectic cuts and sums .  Formal definition  Let M be a manifold with symplectic form ω. Suppose that a Lie group G acts on M via symplectomorphisms (that is, the action of each g in G preserves ω). Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be the Lie algebra of G ,    𝔤  *     superscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}^{*}   its dual , and       ⟨  ,  ⟩   :   𝔤  *   ×  𝔤  →  𝐑     fragments   fragments  normal-⟨  normal-,  normal-⟩   normal-:   superscript  𝔤     g  normal-→  R    \langle,\rangle:\mathfrak{g}^{*}\times\mathfrak{g}\to\mathbf{R}     the pairing between the two. Any ξ in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   induces a vector field ρ(ξ) on M describing the infinitesimal action of ξ. To be precise, at a point x in M the vector    ρ    (  ξ  )   x       ρ   subscript  ξ  x     \rho(\xi)_{x}   is           d   d  t    |    t  =  0     exp   (   t  ξ   )     ⋅  x   ,     normal-⋅     evaluated-at    d    d  t      t  0        t  ξ     x    \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}\exp(t\xi)\cdot x,     where    exp  :   𝔤  →  G      normal-:    normal-→  𝔤  G     \exp:\mathfrak{g}\to G   is the exponential map and   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   denotes the G -action on M . 1 Let     ι   ρ   (  ξ  )      ω        subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    ω    \iota_{\rho(\xi)}\omega\,   denote the contraction of this vector field with ω. Because G acts by symplectomorphisms, it follows that     ι   ρ   (  ξ  )      ω        subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    ω    \iota_{\rho(\xi)}\omega\,   is closed for all ξ in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  A moment map for the G -action on ( M , ω) is a map    μ  :   M  →   𝔤  *       normal-:  μ   normal-→  M   superscript  𝔤       \mu:M\to\mathfrak{g}^{*}   such that       d   (   ⟨  μ  ,  ξ  ⟩   )    =    ι   ρ   (  ξ  )     ω         d   μ  ξ       subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    ω     d(\langle\mu,\xi\rangle)=\iota_{\rho(\xi)}\omega     for all ξ in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Here    ⟨  μ  ,  ξ  ⟩     μ  ξ    \langle\mu,\xi\rangle   is the function from M to R defined by      ⟨  μ  ,  ξ  ⟩    (  x  )    =   ⟨   μ   (  x  )    ,  ξ  ⟩          μ  ξ   x      μ  x   ξ     \langle\mu,\xi\rangle(x)=\langle\mu(x),\xi\rangle   . The moment map is uniquely defined up to an additive constant of integration.  A moment map is often also required to be G -equivariant, where G acts on    𝔤  *     superscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}^{*}   via the coadjoint action . If the group is compact or semisimple, then the constant of integration can always be chosen to make the moment map coadjoint equivariant; however in general the coadjoint action must be modified to make the map equivariant (this is the case for example for the Euclidean group ). The modification is by a 1- cocycle on the group with values in    𝔤  *     superscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}^{*}   , as first described by Souriau (1970).  Hamiltonian group actions  The definition of the moment map requires     ι   ρ   (  ξ  )     ω       subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    ω    \iota_{\rho(\xi)}\omega   to be closed . In practice it is useful to make an even stronger assumption. The G -action is said to be Hamiltonian if and only if the following conditions hold. First, for every ξ in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   the one-form     ι   ρ   (  ξ  )     ω       subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    ω    \iota_{\rho(\xi)}\omega   is exact, meaning that it equals    d   H  ξ       d   subscript  H  ξ     dH_{\xi}   for some smooth function        H  ξ   :   M  →  𝐑    .     normal-:   subscript  H  ξ    normal-→  M  𝐑     H_{\xi}:M\to\mathbf{R}.     If this holds, then one may choose the    H  ξ     subscript  H  ξ    H_{\xi}   to make the map    ξ  ↦   H  ξ      maps-to  ξ   subscript  H  ξ     \xi\mapsto H_{\xi}   linear. The second requirement for the G -action to be Hamiltonian is that the map    ξ  ↦   H  ξ      maps-to  ξ   subscript  H  ξ     \xi\mapsto H_{\xi}   be a Lie algebra homomorphism from   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   to the algebra of smooth functions on M under the Poisson bracket .  If the action of G on ( M , ω) is Hamiltonian in this sense, then a moment map is a map    μ  :   M  →   𝔤  *       normal-:  μ   normal-→  M   superscript  𝔤       \mu:M\to\mathfrak{g}^{*}   such that writing     H  ξ   =   ⟨  μ  ,  ξ  ⟩        subscript  H  ξ    μ  ξ     H_{\xi}=\langle\mu,\xi\rangle   defines a Lie algebra homomorphism    ξ  ↦   H  ξ      maps-to  ξ   subscript  H  ξ     \xi\mapsto H_{\xi}   satisfying     ρ   (  ξ  )    =   X   H  ξ          ρ  ξ    subscript  X   subscript  H  ξ      \rho(\xi)=X_{H_{\xi}}   . Here    X   H  ξ      subscript  X   subscript  H  ξ     X_{H_{\xi}}   is the vector field of the Hamiltonian    H  ξ     subscript  H  ξ    H_{\xi}   , defined by         ι   X   H  ξ     ω   =   d   H  ξ     .         subscript  ι   subscript  X   subscript  H  ξ     ω     d   subscript  H  ξ      \iota_{X_{H_{\xi}}}\omega=dH_{\xi}.     Examples of moment maps  In the case of a Hamiltonian action of the circle    G  =   𝒰   (  1  )        G    𝒰  1     G=\mathcal{U}(1)   , the Lie algebra dual    𝔤  *     superscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}^{*}   is naturally identified with   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   , and the moment map is simply the Hamiltonian function that generates the circle action.  Another classical case occurs when   M   M   M   is the cotangent bundle of    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   and   G   G   G   is the Euclidean group generated by rotations and translations. That is,   G   G   G   is a six-dimensional group, the semidirect product of    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   and    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   . The six components of the moment map are then the three angular momenta and the three linear momenta.  Let   N   N   N   be a smooth manifold and let     T  *   N       superscript  T    N    T^{*}N   be its cotangent bundle, with projection map    π  :     T  *   N   →  N      normal-:  π   normal-→     superscript  T    N   N     \pi:T^{*}N\rightarrow N   . Let   τ   τ   \tau   denote the tautological 1-form on     T  *   N       superscript  T    N    T^{*}N   . Suppose   G   G   G   acts on   N   N   N   . The induced action of   G   G   G   on the symplectic manifold    (    T  *   N   ,   d  τ   )        superscript  T    N     normal-d  τ     (T^{*}N,\mathrm{d}\tau)   , given by     g  ⋅  η   :=     (    T   π   (  η  )      g   -  1     )   *   η      assign   normal-⋅  g  η      superscript     subscript  T    π  η     superscript  g    1       η     g\cdot\eta:=(T_{\pi(\eta)}g^{-1})^{*}\eta   for     g  ∈  G   ,   η  ∈    T  *   N       formulae-sequence    g  G     η     superscript  T    N      g\in G,\eta\in T^{*}N   is Hamiltonian with moment map    -    ι   ρ   (  ξ  )     τ          subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    τ     -\iota_{\rho(\xi)}\tau   for all    ξ  ∈  𝔤      ξ  𝔤    \xi\in\mathfrak{g}   . Here     ι   ρ   (  ξ  )     τ       subscript  ι    ρ  ξ    τ    \iota_{\rho(\xi)}\tau   denotes the contraction of the vector field    ρ   (  ξ  )       ρ  ξ    \rho(\xi)   , the infinitesimal action of   ξ   ξ   \xi   , with the 1-form    τ   τ   \tau   .  The facts mentioned below may be used to generate more examples of moment maps.  Some facts about moment maps  Let    G  ,  H     G  H    G,H   be Lie groups with Lie algebras    𝔤  ,  𝔥     𝔤  𝔥    \mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h}   , respectively.  1. Let      𝒪   (  F  )    ,  F   ∈   𝔤  *          𝒪  F   F    superscript  𝔤      \mathcal{O}(F),F\in\mathfrak{g}^{*}   be a coadjoint orbit . Then there exists a unique symplectic structure on    𝒪   (  F  )       𝒪  F    \mathcal{O}(F)   such that inclusion map     𝒪   (  F  )    ↪   𝔤  *      normal-↪    𝒪  F    superscript  𝔤      \mathcal{O}(F)\hookrightarrow\mathfrak{g}^{*}   is a moment map.  2. Let   G   G   G   act on a symplectic manifold    (  M  ,  ω  )     M  ω    (M,\omega)   with     Φ  G   :   M  →   𝔤  *       normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ  G    normal-→  M   superscript  𝔤       \Phi_{G}:M\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}^{*}   a moment map for the action, and    ψ  :   H  →  G      normal-:  ψ   normal-→  H  G     \psi:H\rightarrow G   be a Lie group homomorphism, inducing an action of   H   H   H   on   M   M   M   . Then the action of   H   H   H   on   M   M   M   is also Hamiltonian, with moment map given by      (   d  ψ   )   e  *   ∘   Φ  G        superscript   subscript    normal-d  ψ   e      subscript  normal-Φ  G     (\mathrm{d}\psi)_{e}^{*}\circ\Phi_{G}   , where      (   d  ψ   )   e  *   :    𝔤  *   →   𝔥  *       normal-:   superscript   subscript    normal-d  ψ   e      normal-→   superscript  𝔤     superscript  𝔥       (\mathrm{d}\psi)_{e}^{*}:\mathfrak{g}^{*}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}^{*}   is the dual map to      (   d  ψ   )   e   :   𝔥  →  𝔤      normal-:   subscript    normal-d  ψ   e    normal-→  𝔥  𝔤     (\mathrm{d}\psi)_{e}:\mathfrak{h}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}   (   e   e   e   denotes the identity element of   H   H   H   ). A case of special interest is when   H   H   H   is a Lie subgroup of   G   G   G   and   ψ   ψ   \psi   is the inclusion map.  3. Let    (   M  1   ,   ω  1   )      subscript  M  1    subscript  ω  1     (M_{1},\omega_{1})   be a Hamiltonian   G   G   G   -manifold and    (   M  2   ,   ω  2   )      subscript  M  2    subscript  ω  2     (M_{2},\omega_{2})   a Hamiltonian   H   H   H   -manifold. Then the natural action of    G  ×  H      G  H    G\times H   on    (    M  1   ×   M  2    ,    ω  1   ×   ω  2    )        subscript  M  1    subscript  M  2       subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2      (M_{1}\times M_{2},\omega_{1}\times\omega_{2})   is Hamiltonian, with moment map the direct sum of the two moment maps    Φ  G     subscript  normal-Φ  G    \Phi_{G}   and    Φ  H     subscript  normal-Φ  H    \Phi_{H}   . Here      ω  1   ×   ω  2    :=     π  1  *    ω  1    +    π  2  *    ω  2        assign     subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2         superscript   subscript  π  1      subscript  ω  1       superscript   subscript  π  2      subscript  ω  2       \omega_{1}\times\omega_{2}:=\pi_{1}^{*}\omega_{1}+\pi_{2}^{*}\omega_{2}   , where     π  i   :     M  1   ×   M  2    →   M  i       normal-:   subscript  π  i    normal-→     subscript  M  1    subscript  M  2     subscript  M  i      \pi_{i}:M_{1}\times M_{2}\rightarrow M_{i}   denotes the projection map.  4. Let   M   M   M   be a Hamiltonian   G   G   G   -manifold, and   N   N   N   a submanifold of   M   M   M   invariant under   G   G   G   such that the restriction of the symplectic form on   M   M   M   to   N   N   N   is non-degenerate. This imparts a symplectic structure to   N   N   N   in a natural way. Then the action of   G   G   G   on   N   N   N   is also Hamiltonian, with moment map the composition of the inclusion map with   M   M   M   's moment map.  Symplectic quotients  Suppose that the action of a compact Lie group  G on the symplectic manifold ( M , ω) is Hamiltonian, as defined above, with moment map    μ  :   M  →   𝔤  *       normal-:  μ   normal-→  M   superscript  𝔤       \mu:M\to\mathfrak{g}^{*}   . From the Hamiltonian condition it follows that     μ   -  1     (  0  )        superscript  μ    1    0    \mu^{-1}(0)   is invariant under G .  Assume now that 0 is a regular value of μ and that G acts freely and properly on     μ   -  1     (  0  )        superscript  μ    1    0    \mu^{-1}(0)   . Thus     μ   -  1     (  0  )        superscript  μ    1    0    \mu^{-1}(0)   and its quotient       μ   -  1     (  0  )    /  G         superscript  μ    1    0   G    \mu^{-1}(0)/G   are both manifolds. The quotient inherits a symplectic form from M ; that is, there is a unique symplectic form on the quotient whose pullback to     μ   -  1     (  0  )        superscript  μ    1    0    \mu^{-1}(0)   equals the restriction of ω to     μ   -  1     (  0  )        superscript  μ    1    0    \mu^{-1}(0)   . Thus the quotient is a symplectic manifold, called the Marsden–Weinstein quotient , symplectic quotient or symplectic reduction of M by G and is denoted    M  /  /  G     fragments  M    G    M/\!\!/G   . Its dimension equals the dimension of M minus twice the dimension of G .  See also: GIT quotient , Quantization commutes with reduction .
