Carnitine decarboxylase

In enzymology, a carnitine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

carnitine 
 
 
 
  2-methylcholine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, carnitine, and two products, 2-methylcholine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carnitine carboxy-lyase (2-methylcholine-forming). This enzyme is also called carnitine carboxy-lyase. It employs one cofactor, ATP.
