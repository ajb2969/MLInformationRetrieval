Soler model

The Soler model is a quantum field theory model of Dirac fermions interacting via four fermion interactions in 3 spatial and 1 time dimension. It was introduced in 1970 by Mario Soler1 as a toy model of self-interacting electron.
This model is described by the Lagrangian density



where 
 
 
 
  is the coupling constant, 
 
 
 
  in the Feynman slash notations, 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , are Dirac gamma matrices.
The corresponding equation can be written as


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are the Dirac matrices. In one dimension, this model is known as the massive Gross-Neveu model.2 3
Generalizations
A commonly considered generalization is



with 
 
 
 
 , or even


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is a smooth function.
Features
Renormalizability
The Soler model is renormalizable by the power counting for 
 
 
 
  and in one dimension only, and non-renormalizable for higher values of 
 
 
 
  and in higher dimensions.
Solitary wave solutions
The Soler model admits solitary wave solutions of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is localized (becomes small when 
 
 
 
  is large) and 
 
 
 
  is a real number.4
