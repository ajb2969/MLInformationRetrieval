Laver property

In mathematical set theory, the Laver property holds between two models if they are not "too dissimilar", in the following sense.
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  transitive models of set theory, 
 
 
 
  is said to have the Laver property over 
 
 
 
  if and only if for every function 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  diverges to infinity, and every function 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and every function 
 
 
 
  which bounds 
 
 
 
 , there is a tree 
 
 
 
  such that each branch of 
 
 
 
  is bounded by 
 
 
 
  and for every 
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
  level of 
 
 
 
  has cardinality at most 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a branch of

A forcing notion is said to have the Laver property if and only if the forcing extension has the Laver property over the ground model. Examples include Laver forcing.
The concept is named after Richard Laver.
Shelah proved that when proper forcings with the Laver property are iterated using countable supports, the resulting forcing notion will have the Laver property as well.23
The conjunction of the Laver property and the 
 
 
 
 -bounding property is equivalent to the Sacks property.
