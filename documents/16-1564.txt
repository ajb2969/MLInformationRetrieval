   Laver property      Laver property   In mathematical set theory, the Laver property holds between two models if they are not "too dissimilar", in the following sense.  For   M   M   M   and   N   N   N   transitive models of set theory,   N   N   N   is said to have the Laver property over   M   M   M   if and only if for every function    g  ∈  M      g  M    g\in M   mapping   ω   ω   \omega   to    ω  ∖   {  0  }       ω   0     \omega\setminus\{0\}   such that   g   g   g   diverges to infinity, and every function    f  ∈  N      f  N    f\in N   mapping   ω   ω   \omega   to   ω   ω   \omega   and every function    h  ∈  M      h  M    h\in M   which bounds   f   f   f   , there is a tree    T  ∈  M      T  M    T\in M   such that each branch of   T   T   T   is bounded by   h   h   h   and for every   n   n   n   the    n  th     superscript  n  th    n^{\text{th}}   level of   T   T   T   has cardinality at most    g   (  n  )       g  n    g(n)   and   f   f   f   is a branch of   T   T   T   . 1  A forcing notion is said to have the Laver property if and only if the forcing extension has the Laver property over the ground model. Examples include Laver forcing .  The concept is named after Richard Laver .  Shelah proved that when proper forcings with the Laver property are iterated using countable supports, the resulting forcing notion will have the Laver property as well. 2 3  The conjunction of the Laver property and the    ω    ω     superscript  ω  ω    {}^{\omega}\omega   -bounding property is equivalent to the Sacks property .
