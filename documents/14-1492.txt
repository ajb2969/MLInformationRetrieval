Radial set

In mathematics, given a linear space

 
 , a set 
 
 
 
  is radial at the point 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
  there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .1 In set notation, 
 
 
 
  is radial at the point 
 
 
 
  if



The set of all points at which 
 
 
 
  is radial is equal to the algebraic interior.23 The points at which a set is radial are often referred to as internal points.45
A set 
 
 
 
  is absorbing if and only if it is radial at 0.6 Some authors use the term radial as a synonym for absorbing, i. e. they call a set radial if it is radial at 0.7
