   Radial set      Radial set   In mathematics , given a linear space    X   X   X   , a set    A  ⊆  X      A  X    A\subseteq X   is radial at the point     x  0   ∈  A       subscript  x  0   A    x_{0}\in A   if for every    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   there exists a     t  x   >  0       subscript  t  x   0    t_{x}>0   such that for every    t  ∈   [  0  ,   t  x   ]       t   0   subscript  t  x      t\in[0,t_{x}]   ,      x  0   +   t  x    ∈  A         subscript  x  0     t  x    A    x_{0}+tx\in A   . 1 In set notation,   A   A   A   is radial at the point     x  0   ∈  A       subscript  x  0   A    x_{0}\in A   if          ⋃   x  ∈  X        ⋂    t  x   >  0       ⋃   t  ∈   [  0  ,   t  x   ]      {    x  0   +   t  x    }      ⊆  A   .        subscript     x  X      subscript      subscript  t  x   0      subscript     t   0   subscript  t  x          subscript  x  0     t  x        A    \bigcup_{x\in X}\ \bigcap_{t_{x}>0}\ \bigcup_{t\in[0,t_{x}]}\{x_{0}+tx\}%
 \subseteq A.     The set of all points at which    A  ⊆  X      A  X    A\subseteq X   is radial is equal to the algebraic interior . 2 3 The points at which a set is radial are often referred to as internal points. 4 5  A set    A  ⊆  X      A  X    A\subseteq X   is absorbing if and only if it is radial at 0. 6 Some authors use the term radial as a synonym for absorbing , i. e. they call a set radial if it is radial at 0. 7  References  "  Category:Topology     ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩
