   CTAIDI      CTAIDI   The Customer Total Average Interruption Duration Index (CTAIDI) 1 is a reliability indicator associated with electric power distribution. 2 CTAIDI is the average total duration of interruption for customers who had at least one interruption during the period of analysis , and is calculated as:      CTAIDI  =     ∑    U  i    N  i       N   i  o         CTAIDI         subscript  U  i    subscript  N  i      subscript  N    i  o       \mbox{CTAIDI}=\frac{\sum{U_{i}N_{i}}}{N_{io}}     where    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   is the number of customers and    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is the annual outage time for location   i   i   i   , and    N   i  o      subscript  N    i  o     N_{io}   is the number of customers at location   i   i   i   that were interrupted. In other words,      CTAIDI  =   sum of durations of customer interruptions  number of distinct customers interrupted       CTAIDI    sum of durations of customer interruptions  number of distinct customers interrupted     \mbox{CTAIDI}=\frac{\mbox{sum of durations of customer interruptions}}{\mbox{%
 number of distinct customers interrupted}}     CTAIDI is measured in units of time, such as minutes or hours. It is similar to CAIDI , but CAIDI divides the total duration of interruptions by the number of interruptions whereas CTAIDI divides by the number of interrupted customers. When CTAIDI is much greater than CAIDI , the service outages are more concentrated among certain customers.  CTAIDI also has the same numerator as SAIDI , but SAIDI divides the total duration of interruptions by the total number of customers served. The fraction of distinct customers interrupted illustrates the relationship between several reliability indicators:        N   i  o     N  i    =   SAIDI  CTAIDI   =   SAIFI  CAIFI            subscript  N    i  o     subscript  N  i      SAIDI  CTAIDI          SAIFI  CAIFI      \frac{N_{io}}{N_{i}}=\frac{\mbox{SAIDI}}{\mbox{CTAIDI}}=\frac{\mbox{SAIFI}}{%
