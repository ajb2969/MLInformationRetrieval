Aristarchus' inequality

In trigonometry, Aristarchus' inequality, named after the ancient astronomer Aristarchus of Samos, states that if α and β are acute angles (i.e. between 0 and a right angle) and β  \frac{\sin\alpha}{\sin\beta} 
The first of these inequalities was used by Ptolemy in constructing his table of chords.1
