   (butirosin acyl-carrier protein)—L-glutamate ligase      (butirosin acyl-carrier protein)—L-glutamate ligase   (butirosin acyl-carrier protein)—L-glutamate ligase (, [BtrI acyl-carrier protein]—L-glutamate ligase , BtrJ ) is an enzyme with system name (BtrI acyl-carrier protein):L-glutamate ligase (ADP-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) ATP + L- glutamate + BtrI acyl-carrier protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + L-glutamyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein]  (2) ATP + L-glutamate + 4-amino butanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + 4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein]   This enzyme catalyses two steps in the biosynthesis of the side chain of the aminoglycoside antibiotics of the butirosin family.
