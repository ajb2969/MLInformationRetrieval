   Divisible group      Divisible group   In mathematics , especially in the field of group theory , a divisible group is an abelian group in which every element can, in some sense, be divided by positive integers, or more accurately, every element is an n th multiple for each positive integer n . Divisible groups are important in understanding the structure of abelian groups, especially because they are the injective abelian groups.  Definition  An abelian group ( G ,+) is divisible if, for every positive integer n and every g in G , there exists y in G such that ny = g . 1 An equivalent condition is: for any positive integer n , nG = G , since the existence of y for every n and g implies that nG ‚äá G , and in the other direction nG ‚äÜ G is true for every group. A third equivalent condition is that an abelian group G is divisible if and only if G is an injective object in the category of abelian groups ; for this reason, a divisible group is sometimes called an injective group .  An abelian group is p - divisible for a prime  p if for every positive integer n and every g in G , there exists y in G such that p n y = g . Equivalently, an abelian group is p -divisible if and only if pG = G .  Examples   The rational numbers    ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   form a divisible group under addition.  More generally, the underlying additive group of any vector space over   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   is divisible.  Every quotient of a divisible group is divisible. Thus,    ‚Ñö  /  ‚Ñ§      ‚Ñö  ‚Ñ§    \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}   is divisible.  The p - primary component      ‚Ñ§   [   1  /  p   ]    /  ‚Ñ§        ‚Ñ§   delimited-[]    1  p     ‚Ñ§    \mathbb{Z}[1/p]/\mathbb{Z}   of    ‚Ñö  /  ‚Ñ§      ‚Ñö  ‚Ñ§    \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}   , which is isomorphic to the p - quasicyclic group     ‚Ñ§   [   p  ‚àû   ]       ‚Ñ§   delimited-[]   superscript  p       \mathbb{Z}[p^{\infty}]   is divisible.  The multiplicative group of the complex numbers     ‚ÑÇ  *     superscript  ‚ÑÇ     \mathbb{C}^{*}   is divisible.  Every existentially closed group (in the model theoretic sense) is divisible.   Properties   If a divisible group is a subgroup of an abelian group then it is a direct summand . 2  Every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group. 3  Non-trivial divisible groups are not finitely generated .  Further, every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group as an essential subgroup in a unique way. 4  An abelian group is divisible if and only if it is p -divisible for every prime p .  Let   A   A   A   be a ring. If   T   T   T   is a divisible group, then     Hom  ùêô    (  A  ,  T  )        subscript  Hom  ùêô    A  T     \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Z}}(A,T)   is injective in the category of   A   A   A   -modules. 5   Structure theorem of divisible groups  Let G be a divisible group. Then the torsion subgroup Tor( G ) of G is divisible. Since a divisible group is an injective module , Tor( G ) is a direct summand of G . So       G  =    Tor   (  G  )    ‚äï    G  /  Tor    (  G  )      .      G   direct-sum    Tor  G       G  Tor   G      G=\mathrm{Tor}(G)\oplus G/\mathrm{Tor}(G).     As a quotient of a divisible group, G /Tor( G ) is divisible. Moreover, it is torsion-free . Thus, it is a vector space over Q and so there exists a set I such that         G  /  Tor    (  G  )    =    ‚äï   i  ‚àà  I    ‚Ñö   =   ‚Ñö   (  I  )     .            G  Tor   G     subscript  direct-sum    i  I    ‚Ñö         superscript  ‚Ñö  I      G/\mathrm{Tor}(G)=\oplus_{i\in I}\mathbb{Q}=\mathbb{Q}^{(I)}.     The structure of the torsion subgroup is harder to determine, but one can show that for all prime numbers  p there exists    I  p     subscript  I  p    I_{p}   such that         (   Tor   (  G  )    )   p   =    ‚äï   i  ‚àà   I  p      ‚Ñ§   [   p  ‚àû   ]     =   ‚Ñ§    [   p  ‚àû   ]    (   I  p   )      ,         subscript    Tor  G   p     subscript  direct-sum    i   subscript  I  p       ‚Ñ§   delimited-[]   superscript  p              ‚Ñ§   superscript   delimited-[]   superscript  p      subscript  I  p        (\mathrm{Tor}(G))_{p}=\oplus_{i\in I_{p}}\mathbb{Z}[p^{\infty}]=\mathbb{Z}[p^{%
 \infty}]^{(I_{p})},     where     (   Tor   (  G  )    )   p     subscript    Tor  G   p    (\mathrm{Tor}(G))_{p}   is the p -primary component of Tor( G ).  Thus, if P is the set of prime numbers,       G  =    (    ‚äï   p  ‚àà  ùêè     ‚Ñ§    [   p  ‚àû   ]    (   I  p   )      )   ‚äï   ‚Ñö   (  I  )      .      G   direct-sum    subscript  direct-sum    p  ùêè      ‚Ñ§   superscript   delimited-[]   superscript  p      subscript  I  p       superscript  ‚Ñö  I      G=\left(\bigoplus_{p\in\mathbf{P}}\mathbb{Z}[p^{\infty}]^{(I_{p})}\right)%
 \oplus\mathbb{Q}^{(I)}.     The cardinalities of the sets I and I p for p ‚àà P are uniquely determined by the group G .  Injective envelope  As stated above, any abelian group A can be uniquely embedded in a divisible group D as an essential subgroup . This divisible group D is the injective envelope of A , and this concept is the injective hull in the category of abelian groups.  Reduced abelian groups  An abelian group is said to be reduced if its only divisible subgroup is {0}. Every abelian group is the direct sum of a divisible subgroup and a reduced subgroup. In fact, there is a unique largest divisible subgroup of any group, and this divisible subgroup is a direct summand. 6 This is a special feature of hereditary rings like the integers Z : the direct sum of injective modules is injective because the ring is Noetherian , and the quotients of injectives are injective because the ring is hereditary, so any submodule generated by injective modules is injective. The converse is a result of : if every module has a unique maximal injective submodule, then the ring is hereditary.  A complete classification of countable reduced periodic abelian groups is given by Ulm's theorem .  Generalization  Several distinct definitions which generalize divisible groups to divisible modules. The following definitions have been used in the literature to define a divisible module  M over a ring  R :   rM = M for all nonzero r in R . (It is sometimes required that r is not a zero-divisor, and some authors require that R is a domain.)  For every principal left ideal Ra , any homomorphism from Ra into M extends to a homomorphism from R into M . (This type of divisible module is also called principally injective module .)  For every finitely generated left ideal L of R , any homomorphism from L into M extends to a homomorphism from R into M .   The last two conditions are "restricted versions" of the Baer's criterion for injective modules . Since injective left modules extend homomorphisms from all left ideals to R , injective modules are clearly divisible in sense 2 and 3.  If R is additionally a domain then all three definitions coincide. If R is a principal left ideal domain, then divisible modules coincide with injective modules. Thus in the case of the ring of integers Z , which is a principal ideal domain, a Z -module (which is exactly an abelian group) is divisible if and only if it is injective.  If R is a commutative domain, then the injective R modules coincide with the divisible R modules if and only if R is a Dedekind domain .  Notes  References    With an appendix by David A.
