DTDP-3-amino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose N,N-dimethyltransferase

DTDP-3-amino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose N,N-dimethyltransferase (, DesVI) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:dTDP-3-amino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose 3-N,N-dimethyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + dTDP-3-amino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose 
 
 
 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + dTDP-3-dimethylamino-3,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of desosamine.
