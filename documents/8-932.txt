   Multicomplex number      Multicomplex number   In mathematics , the multicomplex number systems C n are defined inductively as follows: Let C 0 be the real number system. For every  let i n be a square root of −1, that is, an imaginary number . Then     C   n  +  1    =   {   z  =   x  +   y   i   n  +  1       :    x  ,  y   ∈   C  n    }        subscript  C    n  1     conditional-set    z    x    y   subscript  i    n  1          x  y    subscript  C  n       \text{C}_{n+1}=\{z=x+yi_{n+1}:x,y\in\text{C}_{n}\}   . In the multicomplex number systems one also requires that      i  n    i  m    =    i  m    i  n           subscript  i  n    subscript  i  m       subscript  i  m    subscript  i  n      i_{n}i_{m}=i_{m}i_{n}   ( commutativity ). Then C 1 is the complex number system, C 2 is the bicomplex number system, C 3 is the tricomplex number system of Corrado Segre , and C n is the multicomplex number system of order n .  Each C n forms a Banach algebra . G. Bayley Price has written about the function theory of multicomplex systems, providing details for the bicomplex system C 2 .  The multicomplex number systems are not to be confused with Clifford numbers (elements of a Clifford algebra ), since Clifford's square roots of −1 anti-commute (       i  n    i  m    +    i  m    i  n     =  0           subscript  i  n    subscript  i  m       subscript  i  m    subscript  i  n     0    i_{n}i_{m}+i_{m}i_{n}=0   when  for Clifford).  With respect to subalgebra C k , k = 0, 1, ..., , the multicomplex system C n is of dimension  over C k .  References   G.
