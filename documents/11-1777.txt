   Cone of curves      Cone of curves   In mathematics , the cone of curves (sometimes the Kleiman-Mori cone) of an algebraic variety    X   X   X   is a combinatorial invariant of much importance to the birational geometry of   X   X   X   .  Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a proper variety. By definition, a (real) 1-cycle on   X   X   X   is a formal linear combination     C  =   ∑    a  i    C  i         C       subscript  a  i    subscript  C  i       C=\sum a_{i}C_{i}   of irreducible, reduced and proper curves    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   , with coefficients     a  i   ∈  ℝ       subscript  a  i   ℝ    a_{i}\in\mathbb{R}   . Numerical equivalence of 1-cycles is defined by intersections: two 1-cycles   C   C   C   and    C  ′     superscript  C  normal-′    C^{\prime}   are numerically equivalent if     C  ⋅  D   =    C  ′   ⋅  D        normal-⋅  C  D    normal-⋅   superscript  C  normal-′   D     C\cdot D=C^{\prime}\cdot D   for every Cartier divisor    D   D   D   on   X   X   X   . Denote the real vector space of 1-cycles modulo numerical equivalence by     N  1    (  X  )        subscript  N  1   X    N_{1}(X)   .  We define the cone of curves of   X   X   X   to be      N  E   (  X  )   =   {  ∑   a  i    [   C  i   ]   ,  0  ≤   a  i   ∈  ℝ  }      fragments  N  E   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     fragments  normal-{    subscript  a  i    fragments  normal-[   subscript  C  i   normal-]   normal-,  0    subscript  a  i    R  normal-}     NE(X)=\left\{\sum a_{i}[C_{i}],\ 0\leq a_{i}\in\mathbb{R}\right\}     where the    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   are irreducible, reduced, proper curves on   X   X   X   , and    [   C  i   ]     delimited-[]   subscript  C  i     [C_{i}]   their classes in     N  1    (  X  )        subscript  N  1   X    N_{1}(X)   . It is not difficult to see that    N  E   (  X  )       N  E  X    NE(X)   is indeed a convex cone in the sense of convex geometry.  Applications  One useful application of the notion of the cone of curves is the Kleiman condition , which says that a (Cartier) divisor   D   D   D   on a complete variety   X   X   X   is ample if and only if     D  ⋅  x   >  0       normal-⋅  D  x   0    D\cdot x>0   for any nonzero element   x   x   x   in     N  E   (  X  )    ¯     normal-¯    N  E  X     \overline{NE(X)}   , the closure of the cone of curves in the usual real topology. (In general,    N  E   (  X  )       N  E  X    NE(X)   need not be closed, so taking the closure here is important.)  A more involved example is the role played by the cone of curves in the theory of minimal models of algebraic varieties. Briefly, the goal of that theory is as follows: given a (mildly singular) projective variety   X   X   X   , find a (mildly singular) variety    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   which is birational to   X   X   X   , and whose canonical divisor     K   X  ′      subscript  K   superscript  X  normal-′     K_{X^{\prime}}   is nef . The great breakthrough of the early 1980s (due to Mori and others) was to construct (at least morally) the necessary birational map from   X   X   X   to    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   as a sequence of steps, each of which can be thought of as contraction of a    K  x     subscript  K  x    K_{x}   -negative extremal ray of    N  E   (  X  )       N  E  X    NE(X)   . This process encounters difficulties, however, whose resolution necessitates the introduction of the flip .  A structure theorem  The above process of contractions could not proceed without the fundamental result on the structure of the cone of curves known as the Cone Theorem . The first version of this theorem, for smooth varieties , is due to Mori ; it was later generalised to a larger class of varieties by Kollár , Reid , Shokurov , and others. Mori's version of the theorem is as follows:  Cone Theorem. Let   X   X   X   be a smooth projective variety . Then  1. There are countably many  rational curves     C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   on   X   X   X   , satisfying    0  <   -    K  X   ⋅   C  i     ≤    dim  X   +  1         0     normal-⋅   subscript  K  X    subscript  C  i             dim  X   1      0<-K_{X}\cdot C_{i}\leq\operatorname{dim}X+1   , and         N  E   (  X  )    ¯   =      N  E   (  X  )    ¯     K  X   ≥  0    +    ∑  i     𝐑    ≥  0     [   C  i   ]       .       normal-¯    N  E  X       subscript   normal-¯    N  E  X       subscript  K  X   0      subscript   i      subscript  𝐑    absent  0     delimited-[]   subscript  C  i         \overline{NE(X)}=\overline{NE(X)}_{K_{X}\geq 0}+\sum_{i}\mathbf{R}_{\geq 0}[C_%
 {i}].     2. For any positive real number   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   and any ample divisor    H   H   H   ,         N  E   (  X  )    ¯   =      N  E   (  X  )    ¯      K  X   +   ϵ  H    ≥  0    +   ∑    𝐑    ≥  0     [   C  i   ]       ,       normal-¯    N  E  X       subscript   normal-¯    N  E  X         subscript  K  X     ϵ  H    0         subscript  𝐑    absent  0     delimited-[]   subscript  C  i         \overline{NE(X)}=\overline{NE(X)}_{K_{X}+\epsilon H\geq 0}+\sum\mathbf{R}_{%
 \geq 0}[C_{i}],     where the sum in the last term is finite.  The first assertion says that, in the closed half-space of     N  1    (  X  )        subscript  N  1   X    N_{1}(X)   where intersection with    K  X     subscript  K  X    K_{X}   is nonnegative, we know nothing, but in the complementary half-space, the cone is spanned by some countable collection of curves which are quite special: they are rational , and their 'degree' is bounded very tightly by the dimension of   X   X   X   . The second assertion then tells us more: it says that, away from the hyperplane    {  C  :     K  X   ⋅  C   =  0   }     conditional-set  C     normal-⋅   subscript  K  X   C   0     \{C:K_{X}\cdot C=0\}   , extremal rays of the cone cannot accumulate.  If in addition the variety   X   X   X   is defined over a field of characteristic 0, we have the following assertion, sometimes referred to as the Contraction Theorem :  3. Let    F  ⊂    N  E   (  X  )    ¯       F   normal-¯    N  E  X      F\subset\overline{NE(X)}   be an extremal face of the cone of curves on which    K  X     subscript  K  X    K_{X}   is negative. Then there is a unique morphism      cont  F   :   X  →  Z      normal-:   subscript  cont  F    normal-→  X  Z     \operatorname{cont}_{F}:X\rightarrow Z   to a projective variety Z , such that       (   cont  F   )   *    𝒪  X    =   𝒪  Z          subscript   subscript  cont  F      subscript  𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  Z     (\operatorname{cont}_{F})_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}=\mathcal{O}_{Z}   and an irreducible curve   C   C   C   in   X   X   X   is mapped to a point by    cont  F     subscript  cont  F    \operatorname{cont}_{F}   if and only if     [  C  ]   ∈  F       delimited-[]  C   F    [C]\in F   .
