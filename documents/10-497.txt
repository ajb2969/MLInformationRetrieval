   DTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose 4-dehydrogenase      DTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose 4-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose 4-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-L-mannose + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-L-mannose , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose:NADP + 4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include thymidine diphospho-6-deoxy-L-talose dehydrogenase , TDP-6-deoxy-L-talose dehydrogenase , thymidine diphospho-6-deoxy-L-talose dehydrogenase , and dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose dehydrogenase (4-reductase) . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
