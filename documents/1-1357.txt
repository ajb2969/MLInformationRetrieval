   Specific detectivity      Specific detectivity   Specific detectivity , or D* , for a photodetector is a figure of merit used to characterize performance, equal to the reciprocal of noise-equivalent power (NEP), normalized per square root of the sensor's area and frequency bandwidth (reciprocal of twice the integration time).  Specific detectivity is given by     D  *   =     A  f     N  E  P         superscript  D          A  f      N  E  P      D^{*}=\frac{\sqrt{Af}}{NEP}   , where   A   A   A   is the area of the photosensitive region of the detector and   f   f   f   is the frequency bandwidth. It is commonly expressed in Jones units (      c  m   ⋅    H  z     /  W       normal-⋅    c  m       H  z     W    cm\cdot\sqrt{Hz}/W   )in honor of Robert Clark Jones who originally defined it. 1 2  Given that noise-equivalent power can be expressed as a function of the responsivity    ℜ   ℜ   \mathfrak{R}   (in units of    A  /  W      A  W    A/W   or    V  /  W      V  W    V/W   ) and the noise spectral density     S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   (in units of     A  /  H    z   1  /  2          A  H    superscript  z    1  2      A/Hz^{1/2}   or     V  /  H    z   1  /  2          V  H    superscript  z    1  2      V/Hz^{1/2}   ) as     N  E  P   =    S  n   ℜ         N  E  P      subscript  S  n   ℜ     NEP=\frac{S_{n}}{\mathfrak{R}}   , it's common to see the specific detectivity expressed as     D  *   =    ℜ  ⋅   A     S  n         superscript  D       normal-⋅  ℜ    A     subscript  S  n      D^{*}=\frac{\mathfrak{R}\cdot\sqrt{A}}{S_{n}}   .  It is often useful to express the specific detectivity in terms of relative noise levels present in the device. A common expression is given below.       D  *   =     q  λ  η    h  c      [     4  k  T     R  0   A    +   2   q  2   η   Φ  b     ]    -   1  /  2           superscript  D          q  λ  η     h  c     superscript   delimited-[]        4  k  T      subscript  R  0   A      2   superscript  q  2   η   subscript  normal-Φ  b          1  2        D^{*}=\frac{q\lambda\eta}{hc}\left[\frac{4kT}{R_{0}A}+2q^{2}\eta\Phi_{b}\right%
 ]^{-1/2}     With q as the electronic charge,   λ   λ   \lambda   is the wavelength of interest, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature of the detector,     R  0   A       subscript  R  0   A    R_{0}A   is the zero-bias dynamic resistance area product (often measured experimentally, but also expressible in noise level assumptions),   η   η   \eta   is the quantum efficiency of the device, and    Φ  b     subscript  normal-Φ  b    \Phi_{b}   is the total flux of the source (often a blackbody) in photons/sec/cm².  Detectivity measurement  Detectivity can be measured from a suitable optical setup using known parameters. You will need a known light source with known irradiance at a given standoff distance. The incoming light source will be chopped at a certain frequency, and then each wavelet will be integrated over a given time constant over a given number of frames.  In detail, we compute the bandwidth    Δ  f      normal-Δ  f    \Delta f   directly from the integration time constant    t  c     subscript  t  c    t_{c}   .       Δ  f   =   1   2   t  c           normal-Δ  f     1    2   subscript  t  c       \Delta f=\frac{1}{2t_{c}}     Next, an rms signal and noise needs to be measured from a set of   N   N   N   frames. This is done either directly by the instrument, or done as post-processing.       S  i  g  n  a   l   r  m  s     =     1  N    (    ∑  i  N    S  i  g  n  a   l  i  2     )           S  i  g  n  a   subscript  l    r  m  s           1  N     superscript   subscript   i   N     S  i  g  n  a   superscript   subscript  l  i   2         Signal_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\big(\sum_{i}^{N}Signal_{i}^{2}\big)}        N  o  i  s   e   r  m  s     =   σ  2   =     1  N     ∑  i  N     (    S  i  g  n  a   l  i    -   S  i  g  n  a   l   a  v  g      )   2              N  o  i  s   subscript  e    r  m  s      superscript  σ  2              1  N     superscript   subscript   i   N    superscript      S  i  g  n  a   subscript  l  i      S  i  g  n  a   subscript  l    a  v  g      2         Noise_{rms}=\sigma^{2}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}(Signal_{i}-Signal_{avg})^%
 {2}}     Now, the computation of the radiance   H   H   H   in W/sr/cm² must be computed where cm² is the emitting area. Next, emitting area must be converted into a projected area and the solid angle ; this product is often called the etendue . This step can be obviated by the use of a calibrated source, where the exact number of photons/s/cm² is known at the detector. If this is unknown, it can be estimated using the black-body radiation equation, detector active area    A  d     subscript  A  d    A_{d}   and the etendue. This ultimately converts the outgoing radiance of the black body in W/sr/cm² of emitting area into one of W observed on the detector.  The broad-band responsivity, is then just the signal weighted by this wattage.      R  =    S  i  g  n  a   l   r  m  s      H  G    =    S  i  g  n  a  l     ∫   d  H  d   A  d   d   Ω   B  B              R      S  i  g  n  a   subscript  l    r  m  s       H  G             S  i  g  n  a  l       d  H  d   subscript  A  d   d   subscript  normal-Ω    B  B          R=\frac{Signal_{rms}}{HG}=\frac{Signal}{\int dHdA_{d}d\Omega_{BB}}     Where,      R   R   R   is the responsivity in units of Signal / W, (or sometimes V/W or A/W)     H   H   H   is the outgoing radiance from the black body (or light source) in W/sr/cm² of emitting area     G   G   G   is the total integrated etendue between the emitting source and detector surface      A  d     subscript  A  d    A_{d}   is the detector area      Ω   B  B      subscript  normal-Ω    B  B     \Omega_{BB}   is the solid angle of the source projected along the line connecting it to the detector surface.   From this metric noise-equivalent power can be computed by taking the noise level over the responsivity.       N  E  P   =    N  o  i  s   e   r  m  s     R   =     N  o  i  s   e   r  m  s      S  i  g  n  a   l   r  m  s      H  G           N  E  P       N  o  i  s   subscript  e    r  m  s     R              N  o  i  s   subscript  e    r  m  s       S  i  g  n  a   subscript  l    r  m  s      H  G      NEP=\frac{Noise_{rms}}{R}=\frac{Noise_{rms}}{Signal_{rms}}HG     Similarly, noise-equivalent irradiance can be computed using the responsivity in units of photons/s/W instead of in units of the signal. Now, the detectivity is simply the noise-equivalent power normalized to the bandwidth and detector area.
