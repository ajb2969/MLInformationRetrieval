Beta wavelet

Continuous wavelets of compact support can be built [1], which are related to the beta distribution. The process is derived from probability distributions using blur derivative. These new wavelets have just one cycle, so they are termed unicycle wavelets. They can be viewed as a soft variety of Haar wavelets whose shape is fine-tuned by two parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Closed-form expressions for beta wavelets and scale functions as well as their spectra are derived. Their importance is due to the Central Limit Theorem by Gnedenko and Kolmogorov applied for compactly supported signals [2].
Beta distribution
The beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution defined over the interval 
 
 
 
 . It is characterised by a couple of parameters, namely 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  according to:


 
 .
The normalising factor is 
 
 
 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the generalised factorial function of Euler and 
 
 
 
 
  is the Beta function [4].
Gnedenko-Kolmogorov central limit theorem revisited
Let 
 
 
 
  be a probability density of the random variable 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  i.e.


 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose that all variables are independent.
The mean and the variance of a given random variable 
 
 
 
  are, respectively



 
 .
The mean and variance of 
 
 
 
 
  are therefore 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The density 
 
 
 
  of the random variable corresponding to the sum 
 
 
 
  is given by the
Central Limit Theorem for distributions of compact support (Gnedenko and Kolmogorov) [2].
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be distributions such that

Let 
 
 
 
 , and

Without loss of generality assume that 
 
 
 
  and

The random variable 
 
 
 
  holds, as

Beta wavelets
Since 
 
 
 
  is unimodal, the wavelet generated by


 
  has only one-cycle (a negative half-cycle and a positive half-cycle).
The main features of beta wavelets of parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are:




The parameter 
 
 
 
  is referred to as “cyclic balance”, and is defined as the ratio between the lengths of the causal and non-causal piece of the wavelet. The instant of transition 
 
 
 
  from the first to the second half cycle is given by



The (unimodal) scale function associated with the wavelets is given by



 
 .
A closed-form expression for first-order beta wavelets can easily be derived. Within their support,

Beta wavelet spectrum
The beta wavelet spectrum can be derived in terms of the Kummer hypergeometric function [5].
Let 
 
 
 
 
  denote the Fourier transform pair associated with the wavelet.
This spectrum is also denoted by 
 
 
 
  for short. It can be proved by applying properties of the Fourier transform that



where 
 
 
 
 .
Only symmetrical 
 
 
 
  cases have zeroes in the spectrum. A few asymmetric 
 
 
 
 
  beta wavelets are shown in Fig. Inquisitively, they are parameter-symmetrical in the sense that they hold 
 
 

Higher derivatives may also generate further beta wavelets. Higher order beta wavelets are defined by 
 
 

This is henceforth referred to as an 
 
 
 
 -order beta wavelet. They exist for order 
 
 
 
 . After some algebraic handling, their closed-form expression can be found:

Application
Wavelet theory is applicable to several subjects. All wavelet transforms may be considered forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filter banks. Similarly, Beta wavelet [1][6] and its derivative are utilized in several real-time engineering applications such as image compression[6],bio-medical signal compression[7][8], image recognition [9] etc.
