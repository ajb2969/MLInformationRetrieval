It is the conjunction of all the unique literals of the terms, excluding the literal which appears unnegated in one term and negated in the other.  The conjunctive dual of this equation is:        (   x  ∨  y   )    (    x  ¯   ∨  z   )    (   y  ∨  z   )    =    (   x  ∨  y   )    (    x  ¯   ∨  z   )            x  y      normal-¯  x   z     y  z        x  y      normal-¯  x   z      (x\vee y)(\bar{x}\vee z)(y\vee z)=(x\vee y)(\bar{x}\vee z)     Proof   LHS =      x  y   ∨    x  ¯   z   ∨    (   x  ∨   x  ¯    )   y  z         x  y      normal-¯  x   z       x   normal-¯  x    y  z     xy\vee\bar{x}z\vee(x\vee\bar{x})yz     =      x  y   ∨    x  ¯   z   ∨   x  y  z   ∨    x  ¯   y  z         x  y      normal-¯  x   z     x  y  z      normal-¯  x   y  z     xy\vee\bar{x}z\vee xyz\vee\bar{x}yz     =      x  y   ∨   x  y  z   ∨    x  ¯   z   ∨    x  ¯   y  z         x  y     x  y  z      normal-¯  x   z      normal-¯  x   y  z     xy\vee xyz\vee\bar{x}z\vee\bar{x}yz     =      x  y   (   1  ∨  z   )    ∨    x  ¯   z   (   1  ∨  y   )          x  y    1  z       normal-¯  x   z    1  y      xy(1\vee z)\vee\bar{x}z(1\vee y)     =      x  y   ∨    x  ¯   z         x  y      normal-¯  x   z     xy\vee\bar{x}z     = RHS  Consensus  The consensus or consensus term of two conjunctive terms of a disjunction is defined when one term contains the literal   a   a   a   and the other the literal    a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \bar{a}   , an opposition . The consensus is the conjunction of the two terms, omitting both   a   a   a   and    a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \bar{a}   , and repeated literals; the consensus is undefined if there is more than one opposition. For example, the consensus of     x  ¯   y  z       normal-¯  x   y  z    \bar{x}yz   and    w   y  ¯   z      w   normal-¯  y   z    w\bar{y}z   is    w   x  ¯   z      w   normal-¯  x   z    w\bar{x}z   . 2  The consensus can be derived from    (   x  ∨  y   )      x  y    (x\vee y)   and    (    x  ¯   ∨  z   )       normal-¯  x   z    (\bar{x}\vee z)   through the resolution  inference rule . This shows that the LHS is derivable from the RHS (if A → B then A → AB ; replacing A with RHS and B with ( y ∨ z ) ). The RHS can be derived from the LHS simply through the conjunction elimination inference rule. Since RHS → LHS and LHS → RHS (in propositional calculus ), then LHS = RHS (in Boolean algebra).  Applications  In Boolean algebra, repeated consensus is the core of one algorithm for calculating the Blake canonical form of a formula. 3  In digital logic , including the consensus term in a circuit can eliminate race hazards . 4  History  The concept of consensus was introduced by Archie Blake in 1937. 5 It was rediscovered by Samson and Mills in 1954 6 and by Quine in 1955. 7 Quine coined the term 'consensus'. Robinson used it for clauses in 1965 as the basis of his " resolution principle ". 8 9  Notes  References   Roth, Charles H. Jr. and Kinney, Larry L. (2004, 2010).
