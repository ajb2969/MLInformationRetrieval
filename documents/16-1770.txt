   Farley–Buneman instability      Farley–Buneman instability   The Farley–Buneman instability , or FB instability , is a microscopic  plasma instability named after Donald T. Farley 1 and Oscar Buneman . 2 It is similar to the ionospheric  Rayleigh-Taylor instability .  It occurs in collisional plasma with neutral component, and is driven by drift currents . It can be thought of as a modified two-stream instability arising from the difference in drifts of electrons and ions exceeding the ion acoustic speed.  It is present in the equatorial and polar  ionospheric  E-regions . Since the FB fluctuations can scatter the electromagnetic waves , the instability can be used to diagnose the state of ionosphere by the use of electromagnetic pulses .  Conditions  To derive the dispersion relation below, we must make the following assumptions. We consider the plasma to be quasi-neutral (ni~ne), which is appropriate since the wavelengths of interest are much larger than the Debye length. Additionally, we take the ions to be unmagnetized due to the high collisions frequency with neutrals compared to the ion gyro-frequency. So the ions, in the equilibrium state, are assumed to be at rest. Additionally we must neglect refraction and propagation effects. We take the electric field to be electrostatic since the plasma pressure is much smaller than the ambient magnetic energy density. We ignore gravity and assume the species are isothermal.  Dispersion relation  We use linearized fluid equations ( equation of motion , equation of continuity ) for electrons and ions with Lorenz force and collisional term. This additional term describes the collisions of charged particles with neutral particles in the plasma by frequency of collisions. We denote    ν   e  n      subscript  ν    e  n     \nu_{en}   as the frequency of collisions between electrons and neutrals, and    ν   i  n      subscript  ν    i  n     \nu_{in}   as the frequency of collisions between ions and neutrals. We also assume exponential type of behaviour, meaning that all physical quantities   f   f   f   will behave as an exponential function of time   t   t   t   and position   x   x   x   (where   k   k   k   is the wave number ) :      f  ∼   exp   (    i  ω  t   +   i  k  x    )       similar-to  f        i  ω  t     i  k  x       f\sim\exp(i\omega t+ikx)   . This can lead to oscillations if the frequency    ω   ω   \omega   is a real number , or to either exponential growth or exponential decay if   ω   ω   \omega   is complex . Dispersion relation takes the form of:       ω   (   1  +   i   ψ  0     ω  -   i   ν   i  n       ν   i  n       )    =    k   v  E    +   i   ψ  0      k  2    c  i  2     ν   i  n             ω    1    i   subscript  ψ  0       ω    i   subscript  ν    i  n       subscript  ν    i  n            k   subscript  v  E      i   subscript  ψ  0        superscript  k  2    superscript   subscript  c  i   2     subscript  ν    i  n         \omega\left(1+i\psi_{0}\frac{\omega-i\nu_{in}}{\nu_{in}}\right)=kv_{E}+i\psi_{%
 0}\frac{k^{2}c_{i}^{2}}{\nu_{in}}   , where    v  E     subscript  v  E    v_{E}   is the    E  ×  B      E  B    E\times B    drift and    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   is the acoustic speed of ions. The coefficient    ψ  0     subscript  ψ  0    \psi_{0}   described the combined effect of electron and ion collisions as well as their cyclotron frequencies     Ω  i     subscript  normal-Ω  i    \Omega_{i}   and    Ω  e     subscript  normal-Ω  e    \Omega_{e}   :       ψ  0   =     ν   i  n     ν   e  n       Ω  i    Ω  e          subscript  ψ  0        subscript  ν    i  n     subscript  ν    e  n        subscript  normal-Ω  i    subscript  normal-Ω  e       \psi_{0}=\frac{\nu_{in}\nu_{en}}{\Omega_{i}\Omega_{e}}   .  Growth rate  Solving the dispersion we arrive at frequency given as:      ω  =    ω  r   +   i  γ        ω     subscript  ω  r     i  γ      \omega=\omega_{r}+i\gamma   , where   γ   γ   \gamma   describes the growth rate of the instability. For FB we have the following:       ω  r   =    k   v  E     1  +   ψ  0          subscript  ω  r       k   subscript  v  E      1   subscript  ψ  0       \omega_{r}=\frac{kv_{E}}{1+\psi_{0}}         γ  =     ψ  0    ν   i  n        ω  r  2   -    k  2    c  i  2      1  +   ψ  0          γ       subscript  ψ  0    subscript  ν    i  n          superscript   subscript  ω  r   2      superscript  k  2    superscript   subscript  c  i   2       1   subscript  ψ  0        \gamma=\frac{\psi_{0}}{\nu_{in}}\frac{\omega_{r}^{2}-k^{2}c_{i}^{2}}{1+\psi_{0}}   .
