Bogoliubov causality condition

Bogoliubov causality condition is a causality condition for scattering matrix (S-matrix) in axiomatic quantum field theory. The condition was introduced in axiomatic quantum field theory by Nikolay Bogolyubov in 1955.
Formulation
In axiomatic quantum theory, S-matrix is considered as a functional of a function 
 
 
 
  defined on the Minkowski space

 
 . This function characterizes the intensity of the interaction in different space-time regions: the value 
 
 
 
  at a point 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the absence of interaction in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the most intense interaction, and values between 0 and 1 correspond to incomplete interaction at 
 
 
 
 . For two points 
 
 
 
 , the notation 
 
 
 
  means that 
 
 
 
  causally precedes 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be scattering matrix as a functional of 
 
 
 
 . The Bogoliubov causality condition in terms of variational derivatives has the form:
