(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate synthase

In enzymology, a (2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + (2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and (2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:2,3-dihydroxybenzoate adenylyltransferase. This enzyme is also called 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase. This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal.
