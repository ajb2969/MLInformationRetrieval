Pfister's sixteen-square identity

In algebra, Pfister's sixteen-square identity is a non-bilinear identity of form



It was first proven to exist by H. Zassenhaus and W. Eichhorn in the 1960s,1 and independently by Pfister2 around the same time. There are several versions, a concise one of which is
















































If all

  are set equal to zero, then it reduces to Degen's eight-square identity (in blue). The

Thus the identity shows that, in general, the product of two sums of sixteen squares is the sum of sixteen rational squares.
No sixteen-square identity exists involving only bilinear functions since Hurwitz's theorem states an identity of the form

bilinear functions of the

 .3 There are also non-bilinear versions of Euler's four-square and Degen's eight-square identities.
