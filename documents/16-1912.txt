Sub-Gaussian random variable

In probability theory, a sub-Gaussian random variable, is a random variable with strong tail decay property. Formally, 
 
 
 
  is called sub-Gaussian if there are constants

 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
  :



The sub-Gaussian random variables with the following norm:


 
  form a Birnbaumâ€“Orlicz space.
