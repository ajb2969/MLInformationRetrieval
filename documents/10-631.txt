1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase (1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol-forming)

In enzymology, a 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase (1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol + NADP+

 
  1,5-anhydro-D-fructose + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase (ambiguous), and AFR.
