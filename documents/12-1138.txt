Papyrus 90

Papyrus 90 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
90, is a small fragment from the Gospel of John 18:36-19:7 dating palaeographically to the late 2nd century.1
The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Aland placed it in Category I (because of its date).2
Comfort says "
 
 
90 has [close] textual affinity with 

66 ... [and] some affinity with א (Aleph)."3
It is currently housed at the Sackler Library (Papyrology Rooms, P. Oxy. 3523) in Oxford.45
Greek text
