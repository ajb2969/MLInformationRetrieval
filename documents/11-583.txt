   Self-concordant function      Self-concordant function   In optimization , a self-concordant function is a function     f  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   for which        |    f  ′′′    (  x  )    |   ≤   2   f  ′′     (  x  )    3  /  2      .           superscript  f  ′′′   x      2   superscript  f  ′′    superscript  x    3  2       |f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)|\leq 2f^{\prime\prime}(x)^{3/2}.     A function     g   (  x  )    :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:    g  x    normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     g(x):\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is self-concordant if its restriction to any arbitrary line is self-concordant. 1  History  The self-concordant functions are introduced by Yurii Nesterov and Arkadi Nemirovski in their 1994 book. 2  Properties  Self concordance is preserved under addition, affine transformations , and scalar multiplication by a value greater than one.  Applications  Among other things, self-concordant functions are useful in the analysis of Newton's method . Self-concordant barrier functions are used to develop the barrier functions used in interior point methods for convex and nonlinear optimization.
