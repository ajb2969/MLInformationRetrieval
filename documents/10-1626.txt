   CDP-paratose 2-epimerase      CDP-paratose 2-epimerase   In enzymology , a CDP-paratose 2-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CDP-3,6-dideoxy-D-mannose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , CDP-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose , and one product , CDP-3,6-dideoxy-D-mannose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose 2-epimerase . Other names in common use include CDP-paratose epimerase , cytidine diphosphoabequose epimerase , cytidine diphosphodideoxyglucose epimerase , cytidine diphosphoparatose epimerase , and cytidine diphosphate paratose-2-epimerase . It is also incorrectly known as CDP-abequose epimerase , and CDP-D-abequose 2-epimerase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism. It employs one cofactor , NAD+ .
