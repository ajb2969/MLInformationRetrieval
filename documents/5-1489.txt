Strong topology (polar topology)

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics the strong topology is the finest polar topology, the topology with the most open sets, on a dual pair. The coarsest polar topology is called weak topology.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a dual pair of vector spaces over the field 
 
 
 
  of real (
 
 
 
 ) or complex (
 
 
 
 ) numbers. Let us denote by 
 
 
 
  the system of all subsets 
 
 
 
  bounded by elements of 
 
 
 
  in the following sense:


 
  Then the strong topology

 
  on 
 
 
 
  is defined as the locally convex topology on 
 
 
 
  generated by the seminorms of the form



In the special case when 
 
 
 
  is a locally convex space, the strong topology on the (continuous) dual space

 
  (i.e. on the space of all continuous linear functionals 
 
 
 
 ) is defined as the strong topology 
 
 
 
 , and it coincides with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets in 
 
 
 
 , i.e. with the topology on 
 
 
 
  generated by the seminorms of the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  runs over the family of all bounded sets in 
 
 
 
 . The space 
 
 
 
  with this topology is called strong dual space of the space 
 
 
 
  and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

If 
 
 
 
  is a normed vector space, then its (continuous) dual space

 
  with the strong topology coincides with the Banach dual space

 
 , i.e. with the space 
 
 
 
  with the topology induced by the operator norm. Conversely 
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  is identical to the topology induced by the norm on 
 
 
 
 .

Properties

If 
 
 
 
  is a barrelled space, then its topology coincides with the strong topology 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and with the Mackey topology on 
 
 
 
  generated by the pairing 
 
 
 
 .
