   Central force      Central force   In classical mechanics , a central force on an object is a force whose magnitude only depends on the distance  r of the object from the origin and is directed along the line joining them: 1       F  →   =   𝐅   (  𝐫  )    =   F   (   ||  𝐫  ||   )    𝐫  ^           normal-→  F     𝐅  𝐫          F   norm  𝐫    normal-^  𝐫       \vec{F}=\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})=F(||\mathbf{r}||)\hat{\mathbf{r}}   where    F  →     normal-→  F    \scriptstyle\vec{\text{ F }}   is the force, F is a vector valued force function , F is a scalar valued force function, r is the position vector , || r || is its length, and    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \scriptstyle\hat{\mathbf{r}}   = r /|| r || is the corresponding unit vector .  Equivalently, a force field is central if and only if it is spherically symmetric .  Properties  A central force is a conservative field , that is, it can always be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential energy :       𝐅   (  𝐫  )    =   -    ∇  V    (  𝐫  )   , where  V   (  𝐫  )     =    ∫   |  𝐫  |    +   \infin      F   (  r  )   d  r            𝐅  𝐫        normal-∇  V   𝐫  , where  V  𝐫           superscript   subscript     𝐫      \infin      F  r  normal-d  r       \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})=-\mathbf{\nabla}V(\mathbf{r})\text{, where }V(\mathbf{r%
 })=\int_{|\mathbf{r}|}^{+\infin}F(r)\,\mathrm{d}r   (the upper bound of integration is arbitrary, as the potential is defined up to an additive constant).  In a conservative field, the total mechanical energy ( kinetic and potential) is conserved:      E  =     1  2   m    |   𝐫  ˙   |   2    +   V   (  𝐫  )     =  constant        E        1  2   m   superscript     normal-˙  𝐫    2      V  𝐫         constant     E=\frac{1}{2}m|\mathbf{\dot{r}}|^{2}+V(\mathbf{r})=\text{constant}   (where ṙ denotes the derivative of r with respect to time, that is the velocity ), and in a central force field, so is the angular momentum :      𝐋  =    𝐫  ×  m    𝐫  ˙    =  constant        𝐋      𝐫  m    normal-˙  𝐫         constant     \mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times m\mathbf{\dot{r}}=\text{constant}   because the torque exerted by the force is zero. As a consequence, the body moves on the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum vector and containing the origin, and obeys Kepler's second law . (If the angular momentum is zero, the body moves along the line joining it with the origin.)  As a consequence of being conservative, a central force field is irrotational, that is, its curl is zero, except at the origin :        ∇  ×  𝐅    (  𝐫  )    =   𝟎  .           normal-∇  𝐅   𝐫     0  .     \nabla\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})=\mathbf{0}\text{.}     Examples  Gravitational force and Coulomb force are two familiar examples with F ( r ) being proportional to 1/ r 2 . An object in such a force field with negative F (corresponding to an attractive force) obeys Kepler's laws of planetary motion .  The force field of a spatial harmonic oscillator is central with F ( r ) proportional to r and negative.  By Bertrand's theorem , these two, F ( r ) = − k / r 2 and F ( r ) = − kr , are the only possible central force fields where all orbits are stable closed orbits. However there exist other force fields, which have some closed orbits.
