   Simple function      Simple function   In the mathematical field of real analysis , a simple function is a real -valued function over a subset of the real line , similar to a step function . Simple functions are sufficiently 'nice' that using them makes mathematical reasoning, theory, and proof easier. For example simple functions attain only a finite number of values. Some authors also require simple functions to be measurable ; as used in practice, they invariably are.  A basic example of a simple function is the floor function over the half-open interval [1,9), whose only values are {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. A more advanced example is the Dirichlet function over the real line, which takes the value 1 if x is rational and 0 otherwise. (Thus the "simple" of "simple function" has a technical meaning somewhat at odds with common language.) Note also that all step functions are simple.  Simple functions are used as a first stage in the development of theories of integration , such as the Lebesgue integral , because it is easy to a define integration for a simple function, and also, it is straightforward to approximate more general functions by sequences of simple functions.  Definition  Formally, a simple function is a finite linear combination of indicator functions of measurable sets . More precisely, let ( X , Œ£) be a measurable space . Let A 1 , ..., A n ‚àà Œ£ be a sequence of disjoint measurable sets, and let a 1 , ..., a n be a sequence of real or complex numbers . A simple function is a function    f  :   X  ‚Üí  ‚ÑÇ      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  ‚ÑÇ     f:X\to\mathbb{C}   of the form        f   (  x  )    =    ‚àë   k  =  1   n     a  k    ùüè   A  k     (  x  )      ,        f  x     superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  a  k    subscript  1   subscript  A  k    x      f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}{\mathbf{1}}_{A_{k}}(x),     where    ùüè  A     subscript  1  A    {\mathbf{1}}_{A}   is the indicator function of the set A .  Properties of simple functions  The sum, difference, and product of two simple functions are again simple functions, and multiplication by constant keeps a simple function simple; hence it follows that the collection of all simple functions on a given measurable space forms a commutative algebra over   ‚ÑÇ   ‚ÑÇ   \mathbb{C}   .  Integration of simple functions  If a measure Œº is defined on the space ( X ,Œ£), the integral of f with respect to Œº is        ‚àë   k  =  1   n     a  k   Œº   (   A  k   )     ,      superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  a  k   Œº   subscript  A  k      \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}\mu(A_{k}),   if all summands are finite.  Relation to Lebesgue integration  Any non-negative measurable function    f  :   X  ‚Üí   ‚Ñù  +       normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X   superscript  ‚Ñù       f\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^{+}   is the pointwise limit of a monotonic increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions. Indeed, let   f   f   f   be a non-negative measurable function defined over the measure space    (  X  ,  Œ£  ,  Œº  )     X  normal-Œ£  Œº    (X,\Sigma,\mu)   as before. For each    n  ‚àà  ‚Ñï      n  ‚Ñï    n\in\mathbb{N}   , subdivide the range of   f   f   f   into     2   2  n    +  1       superscript  2    2  n    1    2^{2n}+1   intervals,    2   2  n      superscript  2    2  n     2^{2n}   of which have length    2   -  n      superscript  2    n     2^{-n}   . For each   n   n   n   , set       I   n  ,  k    =   [    k  -  1    2  n    ,   k   2  n    )        subscript  I   n  k         k  1    superscript  2  n      k   superscript  2  n       I_{n,k}=\left[\frac{k-1}{2^{n}},\frac{k}{2^{n}}\right)   for    k  =   1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   2   2  n         k   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶   superscript  2    2  n       k=1,2,\ldots,2^{2n}   , and     I   n  ,    2   2  n    +  1     =   [   2  n   ,  ‚àû  )        subscript  I   n     superscript  2    2  n    1       superscript  2  n       I_{n,2^{2n}+1}=[2^{n},\infty)   .  (Note that, for fixed   n   n   n   , the sets    I   n  ,  k      subscript  I   n  k     I_{n,k}   are disjoint and cover the non-negative real line.)  Now define the measurable sets       A   n  ,  k    =    f   -  1     (   I   n  ,  k    )         subscript  A   n  k       superscript  f    1     subscript  I   n  k       A_{n,k}=f^{-1}(I_{n,k})\,   for    k  =   1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,    2   2  n    +  1        k   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶     superscript  2    2  n    1      k=1,2,\ldots,2^{2n}+1   .  Then the increasing sequence of simple functions       f  n   =    ‚àë   k  =  1     2   2  n    +  1       k  -  1    2  n     ùüè   A   n  ,  k            subscript  f  n     superscript   subscript     k  1       superscript  2    2  n    1          k  1    superscript  2  n     subscript  1   subscript  A   n  k         f_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{2^{2n}+1}\frac{k-1}{2^{n}}{\mathbf{1}}_{A_{n,k}}     converges pointwise to   f   f   f   as    n  ‚Üí  ‚àû     normal-‚Üí  n     n\to\infty   . Note that, when   f   f   f   is bounded, the convergence is uniform. This approximation of   f   f   f   by simple functions (which are easily integrable) allows us to define an integral   f   f   f   itself; see the article on Lebesgue integration for more details.
