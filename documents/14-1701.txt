Template:Oiint/doc

This template is used to include the double closed integral, usually in a mathematical formula. It overcomes a limitation of the TeX rendering which cannot display this symbol without clumsy workarounds.
Arguments

preintegral the text or formula immediately before the integral
intsubscpt the subscript below the integral
integrand the text or formula immediately after the formula

All parameters are optional.
Examples

Two of Maxwell's equations
