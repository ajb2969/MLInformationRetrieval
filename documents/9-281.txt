   Fixed-point property      Fixed-point property   A mathematical object X has the fixed-point property if every suitably well-behaved mapping from X to itself has a fixed point . The term is most commonly used to describe topological spaces on which every continuous mapping has a fixed point. But another use is in order theory , where a partially ordered set  P is said to have the fixed point property if every increasing function on P has a fixed point.  Definition  Let A be an object in the concrete category  C . Then A has the fixed-point property if every morphism (i.e., every function )    f  :   A  →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  A     f:A\to A   has a fixed point.  The most common usage is when C = Top is the category of topological spaces. Then a topological space X has the fixed-point property if every continuous map    f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\to X   has a fixed point.  Examples  The closed interval  The closed interval [0,1] has the fixed point property: Let f :[0,1] → [0,1] be a continuous mapping. If f (0) = 0 or f (1) = 1, then our mapping has a fixed point at 0 or 1. If not, then f (0) > 0 and f (1) − 1 0 with g ( x 0 ) = 0, which is to say that f ( x 0 ) − x 0 = 0, and so x 0 is a fixed point.  The open interval does not have the fixed-point property. The mapping f ( x ) = x 2 has no fixed point on the interval (0,1).  The closed disc  The closed interval is a special case of the closed disc , which in any finite dimension has the fixed-point property by the Brouwer fixed-point theorem .  Topology  A retract  A of a space X with the fixed-point property also has the fixed-point property. This is because if    r  :   X  →  A      normal-:  r   normal-→  X  A     r:X\to A   is a retraction and    f  :   A  →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  A     f:A\to A   is any continuous function, then the composition     i  ∘  f  ∘  r   :   X  →  X      normal-:    i  f  r    normal-→  X  X     i\circ f\circ r:X\to X   (where    i  :   A  →  X      normal-:  i   normal-→  A  X     i:A\to X   is inclusion) has a fixed point. That is, there is    x  ∈  A      x  A    x\in A   such that      f  ∘  r    (  x  )    =  x          f  r   x   x    f\circ r(x)=x   . Since    x  ∈  A      x  A    x\in A   we have that     r   (  x  )    =  x        r  x   x    r(x)=x   and therefore      f   (  x  )    =  x   .        f  x   x    f(x)=x.     A topological space has the fixed-point property if and only if its identity map is universal .  A product of spaces with the fixed-point property in general fails to have the fixed-point property even if one of the spaces is the closed real interval.  The FPP is a topological invariant , i.e. is preserved by any homeomorphism . The FPP is also preserved by any retraction .  According to Brouwer fixed point theorem every compact and convex subset of an euclidean space has the FPP. Compactness alone does not imply the FPP and convexity is not even a topological property so it makes sense to ask how to topologically characterize the FPP. In 1932 Borsuk asked whether compactness together with contractibility could be a sufficient condition for the FPP to hold. The problem was open for 20 years until the conjecture was disproved by Kinoshita who found an example of a compact contractible space without the FPP. 1  References        "  Category:Fixed points (mathematics)     Kinoshita, S.
