   Phosphoglycolate phosphatase      Phosphoglycolate phosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphoglycolate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-phosphoglycolate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycolate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-phosphoglycolate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are glycolate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-phosphoglycolate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include phosphoglycolate hydrolase , 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase , P-glycolate phosphatase , and phosphoglycollate phosphatase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
