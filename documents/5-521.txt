   1/N expansion      1/N expansion      How a three gluon vertex would appear in t'Hooft's double index notation. This makes the analogy to a string theory that will appear at large N apparent.    Examples    1      In quantum field theory and statistical mechanics , the 1/ N expansion (also known as the large-N expansion) is a particular perturbative analysis of quantum field theories with an internal symmetry  group such as SO(N) or SU(N) . It consists in deriving an expansion for the properties of the theory in powers of $1/N$ , which is treated as a small parameter.  This technique is used in QCD (even though $N$ is only 3 there) with the gauge group SU(3). Another application in particle physics is to the study of AdS/CFT dualities.  It is also extensively used in condensed matter physics where it can be used to provide a rigorous basis for mean field theory .  Example  Starting with a simple example - the O(N)  φ 4 - the scalar field φ takes on values in the real  vector representation of O(N). Using the index notation for the N " flavors " with the Einstein summation convention and because O(N) is orthogonal, no distinction will be made between covariant and contravariant indices. The Lagrangian density is given by  $$\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}\partial^\mu \phi_a \partial_\mu \phi_a-{m^2\over 2}\phi_a \phi_a-{\lambda\over 8N}(\phi_a \phi_a)^2$$  where $a$ runs from 1 to N. Note that N has been absorbed into the coupling strength λ. This is crucial here.  Introducing an auxiliary field F;  $$\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}\partial^\mu \phi_a \partial_\mu \phi_a -{m^2\over 2}\phi_a \phi_a +{1\over 2}F^2-{\sqrt{\lambda /N}\over 2}F \phi_a \phi_a$$  In the Feynman diagrams , the graph breaks up into disjoint cycles , each made up of φ edges of the same flavor and the cycles are connected by F edges.  Each 4-point vertex contributes λ/N and hence, 1/N. Each flavor cycle contributes N because there are N such flavors to sum over. Note that not all momentum flow cycles are flavor cycles.  At least perturbatively, the dominant contribution to the 2k-point connected correlation function is of the order (1/N) k-1 and the other terms are higher powers of 1/N. Performing a 1/N expansion gets more and more accurate in the large N limit. The vacuum energy density is proportional to N, but can be ignored due to non-compliance with general relativity assumptions.  Due to this structure, a different graphical notation to denote the Feynman diagrams can be used. Each flavor cycle can be represented by a vertex. The flavor paths connecting two external vertices are represented by a single vertex. The two external vertices along the same flavor path are naturally paired and can be replaced by a single vertex and an edge (not an F edge) connecting it to the flavor path. The F edges are edges connecting two flavor cycles/paths to each other (or a flavor cycle/path to itself). The interactions along a flavor cycle/path have a definite cyclic order and represent a special kind of graph where the order of the edges incident to a vertex matters, but only up to a cyclic permutation, and since this is a theory of real scalars, also an order reversal (but if we have SU(N) instead of SU(2), order reversals aren't valid). Each F edge is assigned a momentum (the momentum transfer) and there is an internal momentum integral associated with each flavor cycle.  QCD  QCD is a SU(3) gauge theory involving gluons and quarks . The left-handed quarks belong to a triplet representation, the right-handed to an antitriplet representation (after charge-conjugating them) and the gluons to a real  adjoint representation . A quark edge is assigned a color and orientation and a gluon edge is assigned a color pair.  In the large N limit, we only consider the dominant term. See AdS/CFT .
