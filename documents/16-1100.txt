Formal ball

In topology, a formal ball is an extension of the notion of ball to allow negative radius. The concept of formal ball was introduced by Weihrauch and Schreiber in 1981 and the negative radius case (the generalized formal ball) by Tsuiki and Hattori in 2008.
Specifically, if 
 
 
 
  is a metric space and 
 
 
 
  the nonnegative real numbers, then an element of 
 
 
 
  is a formal ball. Elements of 
 
 
 
 
  are known as generalized formal balls.
Formal balls possess a partial order 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , identical to that defined by set inclusion.
Generalized formal balls are interesting because this partial order works just as well for 
 
 
 
  as for 
 
 
 
 
 , even though a generalized formal ball with negative radius does not correspond to a subset of 
 
 
 
 .
Formal balls possess the Lawson topology and the Martin topology.
