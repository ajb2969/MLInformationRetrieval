World Ranking points
The Super Series Premier and Super Series tournaments offer ranking points to players based on the round a player/pair reaches. The Super Series Premier tournaments offer higher ranking points, second only to BWF tournaments (BWF World Championships and Summer Olympics). Points will be used for World Ranking and also Super Series standing to decide the top eight players/pairs play in the Super Series Masters Finals.7
Nationality separation
Starting in 2007, players from the same nation are not separated in the main draw of the tournaments. All but the top two seeds will not be divided into two draws as they were before. The top Chinese player Lin Dan has criticized the rule change.8 2010 onwards saw rules altered with nationality separation in the first round.9
Entries

Prior to September 2008, 32 players/pairs can participate in qualifying rounds. Since then, only up to 16 players/pairs can participate in qualifying rounds, where four highest-ranked players/pairs in World Ranking will be seeded.10 This change is to avoid a big strain between the qualifiers and the main events.11
