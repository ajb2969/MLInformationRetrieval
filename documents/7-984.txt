   Partition regularity      Partition regularity   In combinatorics , a branch of mathematics , partition regularity is one notion of largeness for a collection of sets.  Given a set   X   X   X   , a collection of subsets    𝕊  ⊂   𝒫   (  X  )        𝕊    𝒫  X     \mathbb{S}\subset\mathcal{P}(X)   is called partition regular if every set A in the collection has the property that, no matter how A is partitioned into finitely many subsets, at least one of the subsets will also belong to the collection. That is, for any    A  ∈  𝕊      A  𝕊    A\in\mathbb{S}   , and any finite partition    A  =    C  1   ∪   C  2   ∪  ⋯  ∪   C  n        A     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2   normal-⋯   subscript  C  n      A=C_{1}\cup C_{2}\cup\cdots\cup C_{n}   , there exists an i ≤ n , such that    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   belongs to   𝕊   𝕊   \mathbb{S}   . Ramsey theory is sometimes characterized as the study of which collections   𝕊   𝕊   \mathbb{S}   are partition regular.  Examples   the collection of all infinite subsets of an infinite set X is a prototypical example. In this case partition regularity asserts that every finite partition of an infinite set has an infinite cell (i.e. the infinite pigeonhole principle .)    sets with positive upper density in   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   : the upper density      d  ¯    (  A  )        normal-¯  d   A    \overline{d}(A)   of    A  ⊂  ℕ      A  ℕ    A\subset\mathbb{N}   is defined as       d  ¯    (  A  )    =    lim sup   n  →  ∞      |    {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  n  }   ∩  A   |   n     .         normal-¯  d   A     subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n            1  2  normal-…  n   A    n      \overline{d}(A)=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{|\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\cap A|}{n}.       For any ultrafilter    𝕌   𝕌   \mathbb{U}   on a set   X   X   X   ,   𝕌   𝕌   \mathbb{U}   is partition regular. If    𝕌  ∋  A  =    ⋃  1  n    C  i         contains  𝕌  A         superscript   subscript   1   n    subscript  C  i       \mathbb{U}\ni A=\bigcup_{1}^{n}C_{i}   , then for exactly one   i   i   i   is     C  i   ∈  𝕌       subscript  C  i   𝕌    C_{i}\in\mathbb{U}   .    sets of recurrence: a set R of integers is called a set of recurrence if for any measure preserving transformation   T   T   T   of the probability space (Ω, β, μ) and    A  ∈  β      A  β    A\in\ \beta   of positive measure there is a nonzero    n  ∈  R      n  R    n\in R   so that     μ   (   A  ∩    T  n   A    )    >  0        μ    A     superscript  T  n   A     0    \mu(A\cap T^{n}A)>0   .    Call a subset of natural numbers a.p.-rich if it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Then the collection of a.p.-rich subsets is partition regular ( Van der Waerden , 1927).    Let     [  A  ]   n     superscript   delimited-[]  A   n    [A]^{n}   be the set of all n -subsets of    A  ⊂  ℕ      A  ℕ    A\subset\mathbb{N}   . Let     𝕊  n   =    ⋃   A  ⊂  ℕ      [  A  ]   n         superscript  𝕊  n     subscript     A  ℕ     superscript   delimited-[]  A   n      \mathbb{S}^{n}=\bigcup_{A\subset\mathbb{N}}[A]^{n}   . For each n,    𝕊  n     superscript  𝕊  n    \mathbb{S}^{n}   is partition regular. ( Ramsey , 1930).    For each infinite cardinal   κ   κ   \kappa   , the collection of stationary sets of   κ   κ   \kappa   is partition regular. More is true: if   S   S   S   is stationary and    S  =    ⋃   α  <  λ     S  α        S    subscript     α  λ     subscript  S  α      S=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}S_{\alpha}   for some    λ  <  κ      λ  κ    \lambda<\kappa   , then some    S  α     subscript  S  α    S_{\alpha}   is stationary.    the collection of   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   -sets    A  ⊂  ℕ      A  ℕ    A\subset\mathbb{N}   is a   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   -set if   A   A   A   contains the set of differences   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   .    the set of barriers on   𝔹   𝔹   \mathbb{B}   : call a collection   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   of finite subsets of       ∀  X   ,  Y   ∈  𝔹   ,   X  ⊄  Y      formulae-sequence      for-all  X   Y   𝔹    not-subset-of  X  Y     \forall X,Y\in\mathbb{B},X\not\subset Y   a barrier if:      I  ⊂   ∪  𝔹       I    𝔹     I\subset\cup\mathbb{B}   and  for all infinite    X  ∈  𝔹      X  𝔹    X\in\mathbb{B}   , there is some    X  ⊂  I      X  I    X\subset I   such that the elements of X are the smallest elements of I; i.e.      [  A  ]   n     superscript   delimited-[]  A   n    [A]^{n}   and \forall i \in I \setminus X, \forall x \in X, x .     This generalizes Ramsey's theorem , as each    β  ℕ      β  ℕ    \beta\mathbb{N}   is a barrier.

Then the collection of i.p.-rich subsets is partition regular ( Folkman – Rado –Sanders, 1968).
