   Complexification (Lie group)      Complexification (Lie group)   In mathematics , the complexification or universal complexification of a real Lie group is given by a continuous homomorphism of the group into a complex Lie group with the universal property that every continuous homomorphism of the original group into another complex Lie group extends compatibly to a complex analytic homomorphism between the complex Lie groups. The complexification, which always exists, is unique up to isomorphism. Its Lie algebra is a quotient of the complexification of the Lie algebra of the original group. They are isomorphic if the original group has a quotient by a discrete normal subgroup which is linear.  For compact Lie groups , the complexification, sometimes called the Chevalley complexification after Claude Chevalley , can be defined as the group of complex characters of the Hopf algebra of representative functions , i.e. the matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional representations of the group. In any finite-dimensional faithful unitary representation of the compact group it can be realized concretely as a closed subgroup of the complex general linear group . It consists of operators with polar decomposition     g  =   u  •  e  x  p  i  X       g    u  normal-•  e  x  p  i  X     g=u•expiX   , where   u   u   u   is a unitary operator in the compact group and   X   X   X   is a skew-adjoint operator in its Lie algebra. In this case the complexification is a complex algebraic group and its Lie algebra is the complexification of the Lie algebra of the compact Lie group.  Universal complexification  Definition  If   G   G   G   is a Lie group, a universal complexification is given by a complex Lie group and a continuous homomorphism with the universal property that, if    f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f    G  normal-→  H     f:G→H   is an arbitrary continuous homomorphism into a complex Lie group   H   H   H   , then there is a unique complex analytic homomorphism such that    f  =   F  ∘  φ       f    F  normal-∘  φ     f=F∘φ   .  Uniqueness  The universal property implies that the universal complexification, if it exists, is unique up to complex analytic isomorphism.  Existence  If   G   G   G   is connected with Lie algebra   𝖌   normal-𝖌   𝖌   , then its universal covering group    𝐆   𝐆   \mathbf{G}   is simply connected. Let be the simply connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra    𝖌  ⊗  𝐂      normal-𝖌  normal-⊗  𝐂    𝖌⊗\mathbf{C}   . Let be the natural homomorphism and    π  :   𝐆  →  G      normal-:  π    𝐆  normal-→  G     π:\mathbf{G}→G   the natural covering map. Then given a homomorphism    f  :   G  →  H      normal-:  f    G  normal-→  H     f:G→H   , there is a unique complex analytic homomorphism such that     f  ∘  π   =   E  ∘  Φ         f  normal-∘  π     E  normal-∘  normal-Φ     f∘π=E∘Φ   . Let   K   K   K   be the intersection of the kernels of the homomorphisms   E   E   E   as   f   f   f   varies over all possibilities. Then   K   K   K   is a closed normal complex Lie subgroup of and the quotient group is a universal complexification. In particular if   G   G   G   is simply connected, its universal complexification is just .

 \Gamma\rightarrow\{1\}     and the complex Lie group is a complexification of   G   G   G   . 1  Injectivity  If the original group is linear, so too is the universal complexification and the homomorphism between the two is an inclusion. 2 give an example of a connected real Lie group for which the homomorphism is not injective even at the Lie algebra level: they take the product of   𝐓   𝐓   \mathbf{T}   by the universal covering group of    S  L   (  2  ,  𝐑  )       S  L   2  𝐑     SL(2,\mathbf{R})   and quotient out by the discrete cyclic subgroup generated by an irrational rotation in the first factor and a generator of the center in the second.  Chevalley complexification  Hopf algebra of matrix coefficients  If   G   G   G   is a compact Lie group, the *-algebra   A   A   A   of matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional unitary representations is a uniformly dense *-subalgebra of    C   (  G  )       C  G    C(G)   , the *-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on   G   G   G   . It is naturally a Hopf algebra with comultiplication given by        Δ  f   (  g  ,  h  )    =   f   (   g  h   )     .        normal-Δ  f   g  h      f    g  h      \displaystyle{\Delta f(g,h)=f(gh).}     The characters of   A   A   A   are the *-homomorphisms of   A   A   A   into   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . They can be identified with the point evaluations    f  ↦  f   (  g  )       f  normal-↦  f  g    f↦f(g)   for   g   g   g   in   G   G   G   and the comultiplication allows the group structure on   G   G   G   to be recovered. The homomorphisms of   A   A   A   into   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   also form a group. It is a complex Lie group and can be identified with the complexification of   G   G   G   . The *-algebra   A   A   A   is generated by the matrix coefficients of any faithful representation   σ   σ   σ   of   G   G   G   . It follows that   σ   σ   σ   defines a faithful complex analytic representation of . See:        Invariant theory  The original approach of  to the complexification of a compact Lie group can be concisely stated within the language of classical invariant theory , described in . Let   G   G   G   be a closed subgroup of the unitary group     U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   where   V   V   V   is a finite-dimensional complex inner product space. Its Lie algebra consists of all skew-adjoint operators   X   X   X   such that    e  x  p  t  X      e  x  p  t  X    exptX   lies in   G   G   G   for all real   t   t   t   . Set    W  =   V  ⊕  𝐂       W    V  normal-⊕  𝐂     W=V⊕\mathbf{C}   with the trivial action of   G   G   G   on the second summand. The group   G   G   G   acts on , with an element   u   u   u   acting as . The commutant (or centralizer algebra) is denoted by End G  W ⊗ N }} . It is generated as a *-algebra by its unitary operators and its commutant is the *-algebra spanned by the operators . The complexification of   G   G   G   consists of all operators   g   g   g   in    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   such that commutes with and   g   g   g   acts trivially on the second summand in   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . By definition it is a closed subgroup of    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   . The defining relations (as a commutant) show that   G   G   G   is an algebraic subgroup. Its intersection with    U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   coincides with   G   G   G   , since it is a priori a larger compact group for which the irreducible representations stay irreducible and inequivalent when restricted to   G   G   G   . Since is generated by unitaries, an invertible operator   g   g   g   lies in if the unitary operator   u   u   u   and positive operator   p   p   p   in its polar decomposition     g  =   u  ⋅  p       g    u  normal-⋅  p     g=u⋅p   both lie in . Thus   u   u   u   lies in   G   G   G   and the operator   p   p   p   can be written uniquely as    p  =   e  x  p  T       p    e  x  p  T     p=expT   with   T   T   T   a self-adjoint operator. By the functional calculus for polynomial functions it follows that lies in the commutant of if    h  =   e  x  p  z  T       h    e  x  p  z  T     h=expzT   with   z   z   z   in   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . In particular taking   z   z   z   purely imaginary,   T   T   T   must have the form    i  X      i  X    iX   with   X   X   X   in the Lie algebra of   G   G   G   . Since every finite-dimensional representation of   G   G   G   occurs as a direct summand of , it is left invariant by and thus every finite-dimensional representation of   G   G   G   extends uniquely to . The extension is compatible with the polar decomposition. Finally the polar decomposition implies that   G   G   G   is a maximal compact subgroup of , since a strictly larger compact subgroup would contain all integer powers of a positive operator   p   p   p   , a closed infinite discrete subgroup. See:       Decompositions in the Chevalley complexification  Cartan decomposition  The decomposition derived from the polar decomposition        G  𝐂   =   G  ⋅  P   =   G  ⋅   exp   i  𝔤      ,         subscript  G  𝐂    normal-⋅  G  P         normal-⋅  G      i  𝔤        \displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}}=G\cdot P=G\cdot\exp i\mathfrak{g},}     where   𝖌   normal-𝖌   𝖌   is the Lie algebra of   G   G   G   , is called the Cartan decomposition of . The exponential factor   P   P   P   is invariant under conjugation by   G   G   G   but is not a subgroup. The complexification is invariant under taking adjoints, since   G   G   G   consists of unitary operators and   P   P   P   of positive operators.  Gauss decomposition  The Gauss decomposition is a generalization of the LU decomposition for the general linear group and a specialization of the Bruhat decomposition . For    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   it states that with respect to a given orthonormal basis an element   g   g   g   of    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   can be factorized in the form      g  =   X  D  Y       g    X  D  Y     \displaystyle{g=XDY}     with   X   X   X   lower unitriangular ,   Y   Y   Y   upper unitriangular and   D   D   D   diagonal if and only if all the principal minors of   g   g   g   are non-vanishing. In this case    X  ,  Y     X  Y    X,Y   and   D   D   D   are uniquely determined.  In fact Gaussian elimination shows there is a unique   X   X   X   such that is upper triangular. 3  The upper and lower unitriangular matrices, and , are closed unipotent subgroups of GL( V ). Their Lie algebras consist of upper and lower strictly triangular matrices. The exponential mapping is a polynomial mapping from the Lie algebra to the corresponding subgroup by nilpotence. The inverse is given by the logarithm mapping which by unipotence is also a polynomial mapping. In particular there is a correspondence between closed connected subgroups of and subalgebras of their Lie algebras. The exponential map is onto in each case, since the polynomial function lies in a given Lie subalgebra if   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   do and are sufficiently small. 4  The Gauss decomposition can be extended to complexifications of other closed connected subgroups   G   G   G   of    U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   by using the root decomposition to write the complexified Lie algebra as See:             𝔤  𝐂   =    𝔫  -   ⊕   𝔱  𝐂   ⊕   𝔫  +     ,       subscript  𝔤  𝐂    direct-sum   subscript  𝔫     subscript  𝔱  𝐂    subscript  𝔫       \displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}=\mathfrak{n}_{-}\oplus\mathfrak{t}_{%
 \mathbf{C}}\oplus\mathfrak{n}_{+},}     where   𝖙   normal-𝖙   𝖙   is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus   T   T   T   of   G   G   G   and are the direct sum of the corresponding positive and negative root spaces. In the weight space decomposition of   V   V   V   as eigenspaces of    T  ,  𝖙     T  normal-𝖙    T,𝖙   acts as diagonally, acts as lowering operators and as raising operators. are nilpotent Lie algebras acting as nilpotent operators; they are each other's adjoints on   V   V   V   . In particular   T   T   T   acts by conjugation of , so that is a semidirect product of a nilpotent Lie algebra by an abelian Lie algebra.  By Engel's theorem , if    𝖆  ⊕  𝖓      normal-𝖆  normal-⊕  normal-𝖓    𝖆⊕𝖓   is a semidirect product, with   𝖆   normal-𝖆   𝖆   abelian and   𝖓   normal-𝖓   𝖓   nilpotent, acting on a finite-dimensional vector space   W   W   W   with operators in   𝖆   normal-𝖆   𝖆   diagonalizable and operators in   𝖓   normal-𝖓   𝖓   nilpotent, there is a vector   w   w   w   that is an eigenvector for   𝖆   normal-𝖆   𝖆   and is annihilated by   𝖓   normal-𝖓   𝖓   . In fact it is enough to show there is a vector annihilated by   𝖓   normal-𝖓   𝖓   , which follows by induction on    d  i  m  𝖓      d  i  m  normal-𝖓    dim𝖓   , since the derived algebra   𝖓   normal-𝖓   𝖓   annihilates a non-zero subspace of vectors on which    𝖓  /  𝖓      normal-𝖓  normal-𝖓    𝖓/𝖓   and   𝖆   normal-𝖆   𝖆   act with the same hypotheses.  Applying this argument repeatedly to shows that there is an orthonormal basis of   V   V   V   consisting of eigenvectors of with acting as upper triangular matrices with zeros on the diagonal.  If and are the complex Lie groups corresponding to and , then the Gauss decomposition states that the subset       N  -    T  𝐂    N  +        subscript  N     subscript  T  𝐂    subscript  N      \displaystyle{N_{-}T_{\mathbf{C}}N_{+}}     is a direct product and consists of the elements in for which the principal minors are non-vanishing. It is open and dense. Moreover, if   𝐓   𝐓   \mathbf{T}   denotes the maximal torus in    U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   ,         N  ±   =    𝐍  ±   ∩   G  𝐂     ,    T  𝐂   =    𝐓  𝐂   ∩   G  𝐂      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  N  plus-or-minus      subscript  𝐍  plus-or-minus    subscript  G  𝐂        subscript  T  𝐂      subscript  𝐓  𝐂    subscript  G  𝐂       \displaystyle{N_{\pm}=\mathbf{N}_{\pm}\cap G_{\mathbf{C}},\,\,\,T_{\mathbf{C}}%
 =\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{C}}\cap G_{\mathbf{C}}.}     These results are an immediate consequence of the corresponding results for    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   . 5  Bruhat decomposition  If  N G ( T ) / T }} denotes the Weyl group of   T   T   T   and   B   B   B   denotes the Borel subgroup  , the Gauss decomposition is also a consequence of the more precise Bruhat decomposition        G  𝐂   =    ⋃   σ  ∈  W     B  σ  B     ,       subscript  G  𝐂     subscript     σ  W      B  σ  B      \displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}}=\bigcup_{\sigma\in W}B\sigma B,}     decomposing into a disjoint union of double cosets of   B   B   B   . The complex dimension of a double coset    B  σ  B      B  σ  B    BσB   is determined by the length of   σ   σ   σ   as an element of   W   W   W   . The dimension is maximized at the Coxeter element and gives the unique open dense double coset. Its inverse conjugates   B   B   B   into the Borel subgroup of lower triangular matrices in  .

Iwasawa decomposition  The Iwasawa decomposition      A  ⋅  N      A  normal-⋅  N    A⋅N     gives a decomposition for for which, unlike the Cartan decomposition, the direct factor   G   G   G   is a closed subgroup, but it is no longer invariant under conjugation by   N   N   N   . It is the semidirect product of the nilpotent subgroup   A   A   A   by the Abelian subgroup    U   (  V  )       U  V    U(V)   .  For    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   and its complexification   V   V   V   , this decomposition can be derived as a restatement of the Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization process . 8  In fact let be an orthonormal basis of   g   g   g   and let    G  L   (  V  )       G  L  V    GL(V)   be an element in   k   k   k   . Applying the Gram–Schmidt process to , there is a unique orthonormal basis and positive constants such that     𝐀𝐍   𝐀𝐍   \mathbf{AN}     Since the decomposition is direct for    G  ×  A  ×  N      G  normal-×  A  normal-×  N    G×A×N   , it is enough to check that  GAN }} . From the properties of the Iwasawa decomposition for   g   g   g   , the map    h  =   g  *  g       h    g  g     h=g*g   is a diffeomorphism onto its image in , which is closed. On the other hand the dimension of the image is the same as the dimension of , so it is also open. So  GAN }} because is connected. 9 gives a method for explicitly computing the elements in the decomposition. 10 For    h  =   X  D  Y       h    X  D  Y     h=XDY   in set   X   X   X   .

By the Gauss decomposition, it can therefore be written uniquely in the form   D   D   D   with   Y   Y   Y   in ,   h   h   h   in and    Y  =  X  *     fragments  Y   X     Y=X*   in . Since   D   D   D   is self-adjoint, uniqueness forces   A   A   A   . Since it is also positive    D  =   e  x  p  i  T       D    e  x  p  i  T     D=expiT   must lie in   T   T   T   and have the form   𝖙   normal-𝖙   𝖙   for some unique    a  =    e  x  p  i  T   /  2       a      e  x  p  i  T   2     a=expiT/2   in   A   A   A   .

Complex structures on homogeneous spaces  The Iwasawa decomposition can be used to describe complex structures on the    G  /  T      G  T    G/T   s in complex projective space of highest weight vectors of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of   G   G   G   . In particular the identification between   T   T   T   and can be used to formulate the Borel–Weil theorem . It states that each irreducible representation of    G  /  T      G  T    G/T   can be obtained by holomorphic induction from a character of   G   G   G   , or equivalently that it is realized in the space of sections of a holomorphic line bundle on   T   T   T   .  The closed connected subgroups of    S  ⊆  T      S  normal-⊆  T    S⊆T   containing   x   x   x   are described by Borel–de Siebenthal theory . They are exactly the centralizers of tori   X   X   X   . Since every torus is generated topologically by a single element   𝖙   normal-𝖙   𝖙   , these are the same as centralizers of elements   y   y   y   in   S   S   S   . By a result of Hopf is always connected: indeed any element   v   v   v   is along with   λ   λ   λ   contained in some maximal torus, necessarily contained in .  Given an irreducible finite-dimensional representation with highest weight vector    𝐂  v      𝐂  v    \mathbf{C}v   of weight   G   G   G   , the stabilizer of   H   H   H   in   v   v   v   is a closed subgroup   T   T   T   . Since   H   H   H   is an eigenvector of   T   T   T   ,   V   V   V   contains   P   P   P   . The complexification also acts on   v   v   v   and the stabilizer is a closed complex subgroup   α   α   α   containing . Since   P   P   P   is annihilated by every raising operator corresponding to a positive root   B   B   B   ,   v   v   v   contains the Borel subgroup   α   α   α   . The vector     (  λ  ,  α  )   =  0       λ  α   0    (λ,α)=0   is also a highest weight vector for the copy of corresponding to   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   , so it is annihilated by the lowering operator generating if   P   P   P   .

The group    G  /  Z      G  Z    G/Z   is also connected. In fact the space   Z   Z   Z   is simply connected, since it can be written as the quotient of the (compact) universal covering group of the compact semisimple group   G   G   G   by a connected subgroup, where   P   P   P   is the center of   P   P   P   . 11 If is the identity component of   P   P   P   , has as a covering space, so that  P o }} . The homogeneous space has a complex structure, because   B   B   B   is a complex subgroup. The orbit in complex projective space is closed in the Zariski topology by Chow's theorem , so is a smooth projective variety. The Borel–Weil theorem and its generalizations are discussed in this context in , ,  and .

It is generated by the reflections corresponding to the simple roots orthogonal to    𝔱  ⊖  𝔰     symmetric-difference  𝔱  𝔰    \mathfrak{t}\ominus\mathfrak{s}   . See:       Noncompact real forms  There are other closed subgroups of the complexification of a compact connected Lie group G which have the same the complexified Lie algebra. These are the other real forms of G C . 12  Involutions of simply connected compact Lie groups  If G is a simply connected compact Lie group and σ is an automorphism of period 2, then the fixed point subgroup K = G σ is automatically connected . (In fact this is true for any automorphism of G , as shown for inner automorphisms by Steinberg and in general by Borel .) See:       , Exercise 11    This can be seen most directly when the involution σ corresponds to a Hermitian symmetric space . In that case σ is inner and implemented by an element in a one-parameter subgroup exp tT contained in the center of G σ . The innerness of σ implies that K contains a maximal torus of G , so has maximal rank. On the other hand the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus S of elements exp tT is connected, since if x is any element in K there is a maximal torus containing x and S , which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand it contains K since S is central in K and is contained in K since z lies in S . So K is the centralizer of S and hence connected. In particular K contains the center of G . 13  For a general involution σ, the connectedness of G σ can be seen as follows. 14  The starting point is the Abelian version of the result: if T is a maximal torus of a simply connected group G and σ is an involution leaving invariant T and a choice of positive roots (or equivalently a Weyl chamber ), then the fixed point subgroup T σ is connected. In fact the kernel of the exponential map from   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   onto T is a lattice Λ with a Z -basis indexed by simple roots, which σ permutes. Splitting up according to orbits, T can be written as a product of terms T on which σ acts trivially or terms T 2 where σ interchanges the factors. The fixed point subgroup just corresponds to taking the diagonal subgroups in the second case, so is connected.  Now let x be any element fixed by σ, let S be a maximal torus in C G ( x ) σ and let T be the identity component of C G ( x , S ). Then T is a maximal torus in G containing x and S . It is invariant under σ and the identity component of T σ is S . In fact since x and S commute, they are contained in a maximal torus which, because it is connected, must lie in T . By construction T is invariant under σ. The identity component of T σ contains S , lies in C G ( x ) σ and centralizes S , so it equals S . But S is central in T , to T must be Abelian and hence a maximal torus. For σ acts as multiplication by −1 on the Lie algebra    𝔤  α     subscript  𝔤  α    \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}   , so it and therefore also   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   are Abelian.  The proof is completed by showing that σ preserves a Weyl chamber associated with T . For then T σ is connected so must equal S . Hence x lies in S . Since x was arbitrary, G σ must therefore be connected.  To produce a Weyl chamber invariant under σ, note that there is no root space    𝔤  𝐂     subscript  𝔤  𝐂    \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}   on which both x and S acted trivially, for this would contradict the fact that C G ( x , S ) has the same Lie algebra as T . Hence there must be an element s in S such that t = xs acts non-trivially on each root space. In this case t is a regular element of T —the identity component of its centralizer in G equals T . There is a unique Weyl alcove  A in    𝔤  𝐂     subscript  𝔤  𝐂    \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}   such that t lies in exp A and 0 lies in the closure of A . Since t is fixed by σ, the alcove is left invariant by σ and hence so also is the Weyl chamber  C containing it.  Conjugations on the complexification  Let G be a simply connected compact Lie group with complexification G C . The map c ( g ) = ( g *) −1 defines an automorphism of G C as a real Lie group with G as fixed point subgroup. It is conjugate-linear on    𝔤  𝐂     subscript  𝔤  𝐂    \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}   and satisfies c 2 = id. Such automorphisms of either G C or     c  0   =   φ  ∘   c  1   ∘   φ   -  1          subscript  c  0     φ   subscript  c  1    superscript  φ    1       \displaystyle{c_{0}=\varphi\circ c_{1}\circ\varphi^{-1}}   are called conjugations . Since G C is also simply connected any conjugation c 1 on      c  0    (   X  +   i  Y    )    =    σ   (  X  )    -   i  σ   (  Y  )            subscript  c  0     X    i  Y         σ  X     i  σ  Y      \displaystyle{c_{0}(X+iY)=\sigma(X)-i\sigma(Y)}   corresponds to a unique automorphism c 1 of G C .  The classification of conjugations c 0 reduces to that of involutions σ of G because given a c 1 there is an automorphism φ of the complex group G C such that     𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}     commutes with c . The conjugation c 0 then leaves G invariant and restricts to an involutive automorphism σ. By simple connectivity the same is true at the level of Lie algebras. At the Lie algebra level c 0 can be recovered from σ by the formula        (  X  ,  Y  )   =   -   B   (  X  ,   c   (  Y  )    )      ,       X  Y       B   X    c  Y        \displaystyle{(X,Y)=-B(X,c(Y)),}     for X , Y in    𝔤  𝐂     subscript  𝔤  𝐂    \mathfrak{g}_{\mathbf{C}}   .  To prove the existence of φ let ψ = c 1 c an automorphism of the complex group G C . On the Lie algebra level it defines a self-adjoint operator for the complex inner product      φ  =    (   ψ  2   )    1  /  4        φ   superscript   superscript  ψ  2     1  4      \displaystyle{\varphi=(\psi^{2})^{1/4}}     where B is the Killing form on       c  0   c   =   φ   c  1    φ   -  1    c   =   φ  c   c  1   φ   =     (   ψ  2   )    1  /  2     ψ   -  1     =    φ   -  1    c   c  1    φ   -  1     =   c  φ   c  1    φ   -  1     =   c   c  0     .           subscript  c  0   c     φ   subscript  c  1    superscript  φ    1    c          φ  c   subscript  c  1   φ           superscript   superscript  ψ  2     1  2     superscript  ψ    1             superscript  φ    1    c   subscript  c  1    superscript  φ    1            c  φ   subscript  c  1    superscript  φ    1            c   subscript  c  0       \displaystyle{c_{0}c=\varphi c_{1}\varphi^{-1}c=\varphi cc_{1}\varphi=(\psi^{2%

 _{0}.}   . Thus ψ 2 is a positive operator and an automorphism along with all its real powers. In particular take        G  𝐂   =   G  ⋅   exp   i  𝔤     =   G  ⋅  P   =   P  ⋅  G    .         subscript  G  𝐂    normal-⋅  G      i  𝔤           normal-⋅  G  P         normal-⋅  P  G      \displaystyle{G_{\mathbf{C}}=G\cdot\exp i\mathfrak{g}=G\cdot P=P\cdot G.}     It satisfies      𝔤  =   𝔨  ⊕  𝔭       𝔤   direct-sum  𝔨  𝔭     \displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{p}}     Cartan decomposition in a real form  For the complexification G C , the Cartan decomposition is described above. Derived from the polar decomposition in the complex general linear group , it gives a diffeomorphism     𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}     On G C there is a conjugation operator c corresponding to G as well as an involution σ commuting with c . Let c 0 = c σ and let G 0 be the fixed point subgroup of c . It is closed in the matrix group G C and therefore a Lie group. The involution σ acts on both G and G 0 . For the Lie algebra of G there is a decomposition      𝔤  =   𝔨  ⊕  𝔭       𝔤   direct-sum  𝔨  𝔭     \displaystyle{\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{p}}     into the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of σ. The fixed point subgroup K of σ in G is connected since G is simply connected. Its Lie algebra is the +1 eigenspace     G  0   =   K  ⋅   exp   i  𝔭     =   K  ⋅   P  0    =    P  0   ⋅  K          subscript  G  0    normal-⋅  K      i  𝔭           normal-⋅  K   subscript  P  0          normal-⋅   subscript  P  0   K      \displaystyle{G_{0}=K\cdot\exp i\mathfrak{p}=K\cdot P_{0}=P_{0}\cdot K}   . The Lie algebra of G 0 is given by     𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}     and the fixed point subgroup of σ is again K , so that G ∩ G 0 = K . In G 0 , there is a Cartan decomposition     𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}     which is again a diffeomorphism onto the direct and corresponds to the polar decomposition of matrices. It is the restriction of the decomposition on G C . The product gives a diffeomorphism onto a closed subset of G 0 . To check that it is surjective, for g in G 0 write g = u ⋅ p with u in G and p in P . Since c 0  g = g , uniqueness implies that σ u = u and σ p = p −1 . Hence u lies in K and p in P 0 .  The Cartan decomposition in G 0 shows that G 0 is connected, simply connected and noncompact, because of the direct factor P 0 . Thus G 0 is a noncompact real semisimple Lie group. 15  Moreover given a maximal Abelian subalgebra   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , A = exp   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   is a toral subgroup such that σ( a ) = a −1 on A ; and any two such   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   's are conjugate by an element of K . The properties of A can be shown directly. A is closed because the closure of A is a toral subgroup satisfying σ( a ) = a −1 , so its Lie algebra lies in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   and hence equals   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   by maximality. A can be generated topologically by a single element exp X , so   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   is the centralizer of X in   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   . In the K -orbit of any element of   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   there is an element Y such that (X,Ad k Y) is minimized at k = 1. Setting k = exp tT with T in   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   , it follows that ( X ,[ T , Y ]) = 0 and hence [ X , Y ] = 0, so that Y must lie in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   . Thus   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is the union of the conjugates of   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   . In particular some conjugate of X lies in any other choice of     𝔞  0   =   i  𝔞        subscript  𝔞  0     i  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}_{0}=i\mathfrak{a}   , which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of    𝔭  0     subscript  𝔭  0    \mathfrak{p}_{0}   . 16  A similar statements hold for the action of K on    𝔞  0     subscript  𝔞  0    \mathfrak{a}_{0}   in      G  0   =   K   A  0   K    .       subscript  G  0     K   subscript  A  0   K     \displaystyle{G_{0}=KA_{0}K.}   . Morevoer, from the Cartan decomposition for G 0 , if A 0 = exp $\mathfrak{a}_0$ , then  $$\displaystyle{G_0=KA_0K.}$$  Iwasawa decomposition in a real form  See also   Real form (Lie theory)   Notes  References                              "  Category:Lie groups  Category:Lie algebras  Category:Algebraic groups  Category:Representation theory     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  See: ↩  ↩  ↩
