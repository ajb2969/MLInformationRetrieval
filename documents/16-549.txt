   Fuzzy cold dark matter      Fuzzy cold dark matter   Fuzzy cold dark matter is a hypothetical form of cold dark matter proposed to solve the cuspy halo problem . It would consist of extremely light scalar particles with masses on the order of     ≈   10   -  22        absent   superscript  10    22      \approx 10^{-22}   eV. Fuzzy cold dark matter halos in dwarf galaxies would manifest wave behavior on astrophysical scales, and the cusps would be avoided through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle . 1  Notes    "  Category:Cosmology     ↩
