Diaminopimelate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a diaminopimelate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate 
 
 
 
  L-lysine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate, and two products, L-lysine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate carboxy-lyase (L-lysine-forming). Other names in common use include diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase, meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase, DAP-decarboxylase, and meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
