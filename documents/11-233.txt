Phaseollidin hydratase

In enzymology, a phaseollidin hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phaseollidin hydrate 
 
 
 
  phaseollidin + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, phaseollidin hydrate, and two products, phaseollidin and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phaseollidin-hydrate hydro-lyase (phaseollidin-forming). This enzyme is also called phaseollidin-hydrate hydro-lyase.
