   Mean integrated squared error      Mean integrated squared error   In statistics , the mean integrated squared error (MISE) is used in density estimation . The MISE of an estimate of an unknown probability density is given by       E    ∥    f  n   -  f   ∥   2  2    =   E   ∫      (     f  n    (  x  )    -   f   (  x  )     )   2    d  x           normal-E   superscript   subscript   norm     subscript  f  n   f    2   2      normal-E       superscript       subscript  f  n   x     f  x    2   d  x       \operatorname{E}\|f_{n}-f\|_{2}^{2}=\operatorname{E}\int(f_{n}(x)-f(x))^{2}\,dx     where ƒ is the unknown density, ƒ n is its estimate based on a sample of n  independent and identically distributed random variables. Here, E denotes the expected value with respect to that sample.  The MISE is also known as L 2  risk function .
