Bingham distribution

In statistics, the Bingham distribution, named after Christopher Bingham, is an antipodally symmetric probability distribution on the n-sphere.1
It is widely used in paleomagnetic data analysis,2 and has been reported as being of use in the field of computer vision.345
Its probability density function is given by


 
  which may also be written



where x is an axis, M is an orthogonal orientation matrix, Z is a diagonal concentration matrix, 
 
 
 
  is a confluent hypergeometric function of matrix argument.
