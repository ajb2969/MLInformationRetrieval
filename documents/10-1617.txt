Arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase




Arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase

In enzymology, an arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-arabinose 5-phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-ribulose 5-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-arabinose 5-phosphate, and one product, D-ribulose 5-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinose-5-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include arabinose phosphate isomerase, phosphoarabinoisomerase, and D-arabinose-5-phosphate ketol-isomerase.
