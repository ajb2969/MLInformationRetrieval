4'-demethylrebeccamycin synthase

4'-demethylrebeccamycin synthase (, arcyriaflavin A N-glycosyltransferase, RebG) is an enzyme with system name 4'-demethylrebeccamycin D-glucose-lyase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4'-O-demethylrebeccamycin + H2O 
 
 
 
  dichloro-arcyriaflavin A + beta-D-glucose
 

This enzyme catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin.
