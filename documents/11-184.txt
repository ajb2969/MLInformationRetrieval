   CDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase      CDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase   In the field of enzymology , a CDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-glucose    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , CDP-glucose , and two products , CDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism . It employs one cofactor , NAD+ .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-glucose 4,6-hydro-lyase (CDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose-forming). Other names in common use include:   cytidine diphosphoglucose oxidoreductase, and  CDP-glucose 4,6-hydro-lyase.   Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
