Q-derivative

In mathematics, in the area of combinatorics, the q-derivative, or Jackson derivative, is a q-analog of the ordinary derivative, introduced by Frank Hilton Jackson. It is the inverse of Jackson's q-integration.
Definition
The q-derivative of a function f(x) is defined as



It is also often written as 
 
 
 
 . The q-derivative is also known as the Jackson derivative.
Formally, in terms of Lagrange's shift operator in logarithmic variables, it amounts to the operator


 
  which goes to the plain derivative, → d⁄dx, as q → 1.
It is manifestly linear,



It has product rule analogous to the ordinary derivative product rule, with two equivalent forms



Similarly, it satisfies a quotient rule,



There is also a rule similar to the chain rule for ordinary derivatives. Let 
 
 
 
 . Then



The eigenfunction of the q-derivative is the q-exponential eq(x).
Relationship to ordinary derivatives
Q-differentiation resembles ordinary differentiation, with curious differences. For example, the q-derivative of the monomial is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the q-bracket of n. Note that 
 
 
 
  so the ordinary derivative is regained in this limit.
The n-th q-derivative of a function may be given as:



provided that the ordinary n-th derivative of f exists at x = 0. Here, 
 
 
 
  is the q-Pochhammer symbol, and 
 
 
 
  is the q-factorial. If 
 
 
 
  is analytic we can apply the Taylor formula to the definition of 
 
 
 
  to get



A q-analog of the Taylor expansion of a function about zero follows:
