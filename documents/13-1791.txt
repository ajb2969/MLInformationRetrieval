Fritz John conditions

The Fritz John conditions (abbr. FJ conditions), in mathematics, are a necessary condition for a solution in nonlinear programming to be optimal. They are used as lemma in the proof of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, but they are relevant on their own.
We consider the following optimization problem:



where ƒ is the function to be minimized, 
 
 
 
  the inequality constraints and 
 
 
 
  the equality constraints, and where, respectively, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the indices set of inactive, active and equality constraints and 
 
 
 
  is an optimal solution of 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a non-zero vector 
 
 
 
  such that:



if the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are linearly independent or, more generally, when a constraint qualification holds.
Named after Fritz John, these conditions are equivalent to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions in the case 
 
 
 
 .
