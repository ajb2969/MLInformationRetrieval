Maltose-transporting ATPase




Maltose-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a maltose-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + maltoseout 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + maltosein
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and maltose, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and maltose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (maltose-importing). This enzyme is a member of the ABC Transporter family.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
