   Logical equivalence      Logical equivalence   In logic , statements p and q are logically equivalent if they have the same logical content. This is a semantic concept; two statements are equivalent if they have the same truth value in every model (Mendelson 1979:56). The logical equivalence of p and q is sometimes expressed as    p  ≡  q      p  q    p\equiv q   , E pq , or    p  ⇔  q     normal-⇔  p  q    p\Leftrightarrow q   . However, these symbols are also used for material equivalence ; the proper interpretation depends on the context. Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence, although the two concepts are closely related.

(In symbols,    f  →  e     normal-→  f  e    f\rightarrow e   .)  If Lisa is not in Europe, then she is not in France. (In symbols,     ¬  e   →   ¬  f      normal-→     e      f     \neg e\rightarrow\neg f   .)   Syntactically, (1) and (2) are derivable from each other via the rules of contraposition and double negation . Semantically, (1) and (2) are true in exactly the same models (interpretations, valuations); namely, those in which either Lisa is in France is false or Lisa is in Europe is true.  (Note that in this example classical logic is assumed. Some non-classical logics do not deem (1) and (2) logically equivalent.)  Relation to material equivalence  Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence . The material equivalence of p and q (often written p ↔ q ) is itself another statement, call it r , in the same object language as p and q . r expresses the idea " p if and only if q ". In particular, the truth value of p ↔ q can change from one model to another.  The claim that two formulas are logically equivalent is a statement in the metalanguage , expressing a relationship between two statements p and q . The claim that p and q are semantically equivalent does not depend on any particular model; it says that in every possible model, p will have the same truth value as q . The claim that p and q are syntactically equivalent does not depend on models at all; it states that there is a deduction of q from p and a deduction of p from q .  There is a close relationship between material equivalence and logical equivalence. Formulas p and q are syntactically equivalent if and only if p ↔ q is a theorem , while p and q are semantically equivalent if and only if p ↔ q is true in every model (that is, p ↔ q is logically valid ).
