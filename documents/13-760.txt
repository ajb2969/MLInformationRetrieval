Duhem–Margules equation

The Duhem–Margules equation, named for Pierre Duhem and Max Margules, is a thermodynamic statement of the relationship between the two components of a single liquid where the vapour mixture is regarded as an ideal gas:



where PA and PB are the partial vapour pressures of the two constituents and xA and xB are the mole fractions of the liquid.
