   Duhem–Margules equation      Duhem–Margules equation   The Duhem–Margules equation , named for Pierre Duhem and Max Margules , is a thermodynamic statement of the relationship between the two components of a single liquid where the vapour mixture is regarded as an ideal gas :        (     d     ln    P  A       d     ln    x  A      )    T  ,  P    =    (     d     ln    P  B       d     ln    x  B      )    T  ,  P         subscript      d     subscript  P  A       d     subscript  x  A       T  P     subscript      d     subscript  P  B       d     subscript  x  B       T  P      \left(\frac{d\,\ln\,P_{A}}{d\,\ln\,x_{A}}\right)_{T,P}=\left(\frac{d\,\ln\,P_{%
 B}}{d\,\ln\,x_{B}}\right)_{T,P}     where P A and P B are the partial vapour pressures of the two constituents and x A and x B are the mole fractions of the liquid.
