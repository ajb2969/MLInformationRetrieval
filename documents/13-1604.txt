Pocklington's algorithm

Pocklington's algorithm is a technique for solving a congruence of the form



where x and a are integers and a is a quadratic residue.
The algorithm is one of the first efficient methods to solve such a congruence. It was described by H.C. Pocklington in 1917.1
The algorithm
(Note: all 
 
 
 
  are taken to mean 
 
 
 
 , unless indicated otherwise.)
Inputs:

p, an odd prime
a, an integer which is a quadratic residue 
 
 
 
 .

Outputs:

x, an integer satisfying 
 
 
 
 . Note that if x is a solution, −x is a solution as well and since p is odd, 
 
 
 
 . So there is always a second solution when one is found.

Solution method
Pocklington separates 3 different cases for p:
The first case, if 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , the solution is 
 
 
 
 .
The second case, if 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  and



 
 , the solution is 
 
 
 
 .


 
 , 2 is a (quadratic) non-residue so 
 
 
 
 . This means that 
 
 
 
  so 
 
 
 
  is a solution of 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
  or, if y is odd, 
 
 
 
 .

The third case, if 
 
 
 
 , put 
 
 
 
 , so the equation to solve becomes 
 
 
 
 . Now find by trial and error 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic non-residue. Furthermore let


 
 . The following equalities now hold:


 
 . Supposing that p is of the form 
 
 
 
  (which is true if p is of the form 
 
 
 
 ), D is a quadratic residue and 
 
 
 
 . Now the equations


 
  give a solution 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 . This means that either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is divisible by p. If it is 
 
 
 
 , put 
 
 
 
  and proceed similarly with 
 
 
 
 . Not every 
 
 
 
  is divisible by p, for 
 
 
 
  is not. The case 
 
 
 
  with m odd is impossible, because 
 
 
 
  holds and this would mean that 
 
 
 
  is congruent to a quadratic non-residue, which is a contradiction. So this loop stops when 
 
 
 
  for a particular l. This gives 
 
 
 
 , and because 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue, l must be even. Put 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 . So the solution of 
 
 
 
  is got by solving the linear congruence 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
The following are 3 examples, corresponding to the 3 different cases in which Pocklington divided forms of p. All 
 
 
 
  are taken with the modulus in the example.
Example 1
Solve the congruence


 
  The modulus is 23. This is 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 . The solution should be 
 
 
 
 , which is indeed true
 
 
 
 .
Example 2
Solve the congruence


 
  The modulus is 13. This is 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 . Now verifying 
 
 
 
 . So the solution is 
 
 
 
 . This is indeed true
 
 
 
 .
Example 3
Solve the congruence 
 
 
 
 . For this, write 
 
 
 
 . First find a 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic nonresidue. Take for example 
 
 
 
 . Now find 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  by computing


 
 ,


 
  And similarly 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

Since 
 
 
 
 , the equation 
 
 
 
  which leads to solving the equation 
 
 
 
 . This has solution 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, 
 
 
 
 .
