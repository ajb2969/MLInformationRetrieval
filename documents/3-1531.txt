   Reduced ring      Reduced ring   In ring theory , a ring R is called a reduced ring if it has no non-zero nilpotent elements. Equivalently, a ring is reduced if it has no non-zero elements with square zero, that is, x 2 = 0 implies x = 0. A commutative algebra over a commutative ring is called a reduced algebra if its underlying ring is reduced.  The nilpotent elements of a commutative ring R form an ideal of R , called the nilradical of R ; therefore a commutative ring is reduced if and only if its nilradical is zero. Moreover, a commutative ring is reduced if and only if the only element contained in all prime ideals is zero.  A quotient ring  R/I is reduced if and only if I is a radical ideal .  Let D be the set of all zerodivisors in a reduced ring R . Then D is the union of all minimal prime ideals . Proof: let    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   be all the (possibly zero) minimal prime ideals.       D  ⊂   ∪   𝔭  i     :      normal-:    D     subscript  𝔭  i     absent    D\subset\cup\mathfrak{p}_{i}:   Let x be in D . Then xy = 0 for some nonzero y . Since R is reduced, (0) is the intersection of all    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   and thus y is not in some    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   . Since xy is in all    𝔭  j     subscript  𝔭  j    \mathfrak{p}_{j}   ; in particular, in    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   , x is in    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   .       D  ⊃   𝔭  i    :      normal-:     subscript  𝔭  i   D   absent    D\supset\mathfrak{p}_{i}:   (stolen from Kaplansky, commutative rings, Theorem 84). We drop the subscript i . Let    S  =   {   x  y   |    x  ∈   R  -  D    ,   y  ∈   R  -  𝔭     }       S   conditional-set    x  y    formulae-sequence    x    R  D      y    R  𝔭        S=\{xy|x\in R-D,y\in R-\mathfrak{p}\}   . S is multiplicatively closed and so we can consider the localization    R  →   R   [   S   -  1    ]       normal-→  R    R   delimited-[]   superscript  S    1        R\to R[S^{-1}]   . Let   𝔮   𝔮   \mathfrak{q}   be the pre-image of a maximal ideal. Then   𝔮   𝔮   \mathfrak{q}   is contained in both D and   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   and by minimality    𝔮  =  𝔭      𝔮  𝔭    \mathfrak{q}=\mathfrak{p}   . (This direction is immediate if R is Noetherian by the theory of associated primes .)  Examples and non-examples   Subrings , products , and localizations of reduced rings are again reduced rings.  The ring of integers Z is a reduced ring. Every field and every polynomial ring over a field (in arbitrarily many variables) is a reduced ring.  More generally, every integral domain is a reduced ring since a nilpotent element is a fortiori a zero divisor . On the other hand, not every reduced ring is an integral domain. For example, the ring Z [ x , y ]/( xy ) contains x + (xy) and y + (xy) as zero divisors, but no non-zero nilpotent elements. As another example, the ring Z × Z contains (1,0) and (0,1) as zero divisors, but contains no non-zero nilpotent elements.  The ring Z /6 Z is reduced, however Z /4 Z is not reduced: The class 2 + 4 Z is nilpotent. In general, Z / n Z is reduced if and only if n = 0 or n is a square-free integer .  If R is a commutative ring and N is the nilradical of R , then the quotient ring R / N is reduced.  A commutative ring R of characteristic  p for some prime number p is reduced if and only if its Frobenius endomorphism is injective . (cf. perfect field .)   Generalizations  Reduced rings play an elementary role in algebraic geometry , where this concept is generalized to the concept of a reduced scheme .
