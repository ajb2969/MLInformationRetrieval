   Geranoyl-CoA carboxylase      Geranoyl-CoA carboxylase   In enzymology , a geranoyl-CoA carboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + geranoyl-CoA + HCO 3 - $\rightleftharpoons$ ADP + phosphate + 3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , geranoyl-CoA , and HCO3- , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and 3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)pent-2-enedioyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbonâ€“carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranoyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include geranoyl coenzyme A carboxylase , and geranyl-CoA carboxylase . It employs one cofactor , biotin .
