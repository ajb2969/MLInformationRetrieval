   Tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase      Tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase   Tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase (, FOMT , TaOMT1 , TaCOMT1 , TaOMT2 ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltricetin (overall reaction)  (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3'-O-methyltricetin  (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3'-O-methyltricetin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin  (1c) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltricetin   The enzyme from Triticum aestivum catalyses the sequential O-methylation of tricetin via 3'-O-methyltricetin, 3',5'-O-methyltricetin to 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltricetin.
