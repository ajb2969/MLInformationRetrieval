Tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase

Tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase (, FOMT, TaOMT1, TaCOMT1, TaOMT2) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tricetin 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin

 
  3 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltricetin (overall reaction)
 
(1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tricetin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3'-O-methyltricetin
 
(1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3'-O-methyltricetin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin
 
(1c) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3',5'-O-dimethyltricetin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltricetin
 

The enzyme from Triticum aestivum catalyses the sequential O-methylation of tricetin via 3'-O-methyltricetin, 3',5'-O-methyltricetin to 3',4',5'-O-trimethyltricetin.
