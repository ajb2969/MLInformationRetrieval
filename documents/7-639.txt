   Sauerbrey equation      Sauerbrey equation   The Sauerbrey equation was developed by G. Sauerbrey in 1959 as a method for correlating changes in the oscillation frequency of a piezoelectric  crystal with the mass deposited on it. He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the characteristic frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency determining component of an oscillator circuit. His method continues to be used as the primary tool in quartz crystal microbalance experiments for conversion of frequency to mass and is valid in nearly all applications.  The equation is derived by treating the deposited mass as though it were an extension of the thickness of the underlying quartz. 1  2 Because of this, the mass to frequency correlation (as determined by Sauerbrey’s equation) is largely independent of electrode geometry. This has the benefit of allowing mass determination without calibration, making the set-up desirable from a cost and time investment standpoint.  The Sauerbrey equation is defined as:       Δ  f   =   -     2   f  0  2     A     ρ  q    μ  q       Δ  m          normal-Δ  f           2   superscript   subscript  f  0   2      A       subscript  ρ  q    subscript  μ  q       normal-Δ  m      \Delta f=-\frac{2f_{0}^{2}}{A\sqrt{\rho_{q}\mu_{q}}}\Delta m   .

A 19(1),97-100 Jan/Feb 2001  If the change in frequency is greater than 2%, that is,     Δ  f   /  f        normal-Δ  f   f    \Delta f/f   > 0.02, the Z-match method must be used to determine the change in mass. 3 The formula for the Z-match method is: 4         Δ  m   A    =      N  q    ρ  q     π  Z   f  L       tan   -  1     [   Z   tan   (   π     f  U   -   f  L     f  U     )     ]             normal-Δ  m   A          subscript  N  q    subscript  ρ  q      π  Z   subscript  f  L       superscript     1      Z      π       subscript  f  U    subscript  f  L     subscript  f  U           \frac{\Delta m}{A}\ =\frac{N_{q}\rho_{q}}{\pi Zf_{L}}\tan^{-1}\left[Z\tan\left%

It has been shown that quartz crystal microbalance measurements can be performed in liquid, in which case a viscosity related decrease in the resonant frequency will be observed:       Δ  f   =   -    f  0   3  /  2      (      η  l    ρ  l    /  π    ρ  q    μ  q    )    1  /  2            normal-Δ  f        superscript   subscript  f  0     3  2     superscript         subscript  η  l    subscript  ρ  l    π    subscript  ρ  q    subscript  μ  q      1  2        \Delta f={-\ f_{0}^{3/2}(\eta_{l}\rho_{l}/\pi\rho_{q}\mu_{q})^{1/2}}     where    ρ  l     subscript  ρ  l    \rho_{l}   is the density of the liquid and    η  l     subscript  η  l    \eta_{l}   is the viscosity of the liquid (Kanazawa and Gordon 1985).
