Extension by definitions

In mathematical logic, more specifically in the proof theory of first-order theories, extensions by definitions formalize the introduction of new symbols by means of a definition. For example, it is common in naive set theory to introduce a symbol 
 
 
 
  for the set which has no member. In the formal setting of first-order theories, this can be done by adding to the theory a new constant 
 
 
 
  and the new axiom

 
 , meaning 'for all x, x is not a member of 
 
 
 
 
 '. It can then be proved that doing so adds essentially nothing to the old theory, as should be expected from a definition. More precisely, the new theory is a conservative extension of the old one.
Definition of relation symbols
Let

 
  be a first-order theory and 
 
 
 
  a formula of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
 
  are distinct and include the variables free in 
 
 
 
 . Form a new first-order theory 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  by adding a new 
 
 
 
 -ary relation symbol 
 
 
 
 
 , the logical axioms featuring the symbol 
 
 
 
  and the new axiom


 
 , called the defining axiom of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a formula of 
 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the formula of 
 
 
 
  obtained from 
 
 
 
  by replacing any occurrence of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 
  (changing the bound variables in 
 
 
 
  if necessary so that the variables occurring in the 
 
 
 
  are not bound in 
 
 
 
 ). Then the following hold:



 
  is provable in 
 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  is a conservative extension of 
 
 
 
 .

The fact that 
 
 
 
  is a conservative extension of 
 
 
 
  shows that the defining axiom of 
 
 
 
 
  cannot be used to prove new theorems. The formula 
 
 
 
  is called a translation of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 . Semantically, the formula 
 
 
 
  has the same meaning as 
 
 
 
 
 , but the defined symbol 
 
 
 
  has been eliminated.
Definition of function symbols
Let 
 
 
 
  be a first-order theory (with equality) and 
 
 
 
  a formula of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
  are distinct and include the variables free in 
 
 
 
 . Assume that we can prove


 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e. for all 
 
 
 
 , ..., 
 
 
 
 , there exists a unique y such that 
 
 
 
 . Form a new first-order theory 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
 
  by adding a new 
 
 
 
 -ary function symbol 
 
 
 
 , the logical axioms featuring the symbol 
 
 
 
  and the new axiom


 
 , called the defining axiom of 
 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is an atomic formula of 
 
 
 
 , define a formula 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  recursively as follows. If the new symbol 
 
 
 
 
  does not occur in 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise, choose an occurrence of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  does not occur in the terms 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be obtained from 
 
 
 
  by replacing that occurrence by a new variable 
 
 
 
 
 . Then since 
 
 
 
  occurs in 
 
 
 
  one less time than in 
 
 
 
 , the formula 
 
 
 
  has already been defined, and we let 
 
 
 
 
  be


 
  (changing the bound variables in 
 
 
 
  if necessary so that the variables occurring in the 
 
 
 
  are not bound in 
 
 
 
 ). For a general formula 
 
 
 
 
 , the formula 
 
 
 
  is formed by replacing every occurrence of an atomic subformula 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Then the following hold:



 
  is provable in 
 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  is a conservative extension of 
 
 
 
 .

The formula 
 
 
 
  is called a translation of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 
 . As in the case of relation symbols, the formula 
 
 
 
  has the same meaning as 
 
 
 
 , but the new symbol 
 
 
 
  has been eliminated.
The construction of this paragraph also works for constants, which can be viewed as 0-ary function symbols.
Extensions by definitions
A first-order theory 
 
 
 
  obtained from 
 
 
 
 
  by successive introductions of relation symbols and function symbols as above is called an extension by definitions of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a conservative extension of 
 
 
 
 , and for any formula 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  we can form a formula 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , called a translation of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 
  is provable in 
 
 
 
 . Such a formula is not unique, but any two of them can be proved to be equivalent in T.
In practice, an extension by definitions 
 
 
 
  of T is not distinguished from the original theory T. In fact, the formulas of 
 
 
 
  can be thought of as abbreviating their translations into T. The manipulation of these abbreviations as actual formulas is then justified by the fact that extensions by definitions are conservative.
Examples

Traditionally, the first-order set theory ZF has 
 
 
 
  (equality) and 
 
 
 
 
  (membership) as its only primitive relation symbols, and no function symbols. In everyday mathematics, however, many other symbols are used such as the binary relation symbol 
 
 
 
 , the constant 
 
 
 
 , the unary function symbol P (the power-set operation), etc. All of these symbols belong in fact to extensions by definitions of ZF.


Let 
 
 
 
  be a first-order theory for groups in which the only primitive symbol is the binary product 
 
 
 
 . In T, we can prove that there exists a unique element y such that x.y=y.x=x for every x. Therefore we can add to T a new constant e and the axiom



 
 , and what we obtain is an extension by definitions 
 
 
 
  of T. Then in 
 
 
 
  we can prove that for every x, there exists a unique y such that x.y=y.x=e. Consequently, the first-order theory 
 
 
 
  obtained from 
 
 
 
  by adding a unary function symbol 
 
 
 
 
  and the axiom


 
  is an extension by definitions of T. Usually, 
 
 
 
  is denoted 
 
 
 
 .
