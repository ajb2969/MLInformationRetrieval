Indolin-2-one monooxygenase

Indolin-2-one monooxygenase (, BX3 (gene), CYP71C2 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name indolin-2-one,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

indolin-2-one + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  3-hydroxyindolin-2-one + NAD(P)+ + H2O
 

Indolin-2-one monooxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of protective and allelophatic benzoxazinoids in some plants.
