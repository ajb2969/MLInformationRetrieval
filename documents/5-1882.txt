FastICA

FastICA is an efficient and popular algorithm for independent component analysis invented by Aapo Hyvärinen at Helsinki University of Technology.12 The algorithm is based on a fixed-point iteration scheme maximizing non-Gaussianity as a measure of statistical independence. It can also be derived as an approximative Newton iteration.
Algorithm
Preprocess the data
Before the FastICA algorithm can be applied, the input vector data 
 
 
 
  should be centered and whitened.
Centering the data
The input data 
 
 
 
  is centered by computing the mean of each component of 
 
 
 
  and subtracting that mean. This has the effect of making each component have zero mean. Thus:





Whitening the data
Whitening the data involves linearly transforming the data so that the new components are uncorrelated and have variance one. If 
 
 
 
  is the whitened data, then the covariance matrix of the whitened data is the identity matrix:





This can be done using eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of the data
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the matrix of eigenvectors and 
 
 
 
  is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Once eigenvalue decomposition is done, the whitened data is:





Single component extraction
The iterative algorithm finds the direction for the weight vector 
 
 
 
  maximizing the non-Gaussianity of the projection 
 
 
 
  for the data 
 
 
 
 . The function

 
  is the derivative of a nonquadratic nonlinearity function 
 
 
 
 . Hyvärinen states that good equations for 
 
 
 
  (shown with their derivatives 
 
 
 
  and second derivatives 
 
 
 
 ) are:










The first equation is a good general-purpose equation, while the second is highly robust.

Randomize the initial weight vector 
 
 

Let 

  \mathbf{w}^+ \leftarrow E\left\{\mathbf{x} g(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x})^T\right\} - 
                 E\left\{g'(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x})\right\}\mathbf{w} 
     , where 

 means averaging over all column-vectors of matrix 



Let 
 
 

If not converged, go back to 2

Multiple component extraction
The single unit iterative algorithm only estimates one of the independent components, to estimate more the algorithm must repeated, and the projection vectors decorrelated. Although Hyvärinen provides several ways of decorrelating results, the simplest multiple unit algorithm follows.
