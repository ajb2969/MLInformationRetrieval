   Galactitol 2-dehydrogenase      Galactitol 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a galactitol 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   galactitol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-tagatose + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are galactitol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-tagatose , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is galactitol:NAD + 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called dulcitol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism .
