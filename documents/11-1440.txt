Anthranilate adenylyltransferase




Anthranilate adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, an anthranilate adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + anthranilate $\rightleftharpoons$ diphosphate + N-adenylylanthranilate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and anthranilate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and N-adenylylanthranilate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:anthranilate N-adenylyltransferase. This enzyme is also called anthranilic acid adenylyltransferase.
