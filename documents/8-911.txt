   Palindromic polynomial      Palindromic polynomial   A polynomial is palindromic, if the sequence of its coefficients are a palindrome .  Let       P   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    x  i           P  x     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  x  i       P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{i}   be a polynomial of degree  n , then P is palindromic if a i = a n − i for i = 0, 1, ... n .  Similarly, P is called antipalindromic if a i = − a n − i for i = 0, 1, ... n . It follows from the definition that if P is of even degree (so has odd number of terms in the polynomial), then it can only be antipalindromic when the 'middle' term is 0, i.e. a i = − a n , where n = 2 i .  Examples  Some examples of palindromic polynomials are:        (   x  +  1   )   2   =    x  2   +   2  x   +  1        superscript    x  1   2      superscript  x  2     2  x   1     (x+1)^{2}=x^{2}+2x+1           (   x  +  1   )   3   =    x  3   +   3   x  2    +   3  x   +  1.        superscript    x  1   3      superscript  x  3     3   superscript  x  2      3  x   1.     (x+1)^{3}=x^{3}+3x^{2}+3x+1.     These are examples of the expansion of ( x + 1) n , which is palindromic for all n , this can be seen from the binomial expansion .  Another example of a palindromic polynomial [which isn't of the form ( x + 1) n ] is:       x  2   +   3  x   +  1       superscript  x  2     3  x   1    x^{2}+3x+1     An example of an antipalindromic polynomial is:       x  2   -  1       superscript  x  2   1    x^{2}-1     Note the zero coefficient for the term in x.  Properties   If a is a root of a polynomial that is either palindromic or antipalindromic, then 1/ a is also a root and has the same multiplicity . 1  The converse is true: If a polynomial is such that if a is a root then 1/ a is also a root of the same multiplicity, then the polynomial is either palindromic or antipalindromic.  The product of two palindromic or antipalindromic polynomials is palindromic.  The product of a palindromic polynomial and an antipalindromic polynomial is antipalindromic.  A palindromic polynomial of odd degree is a multiple of x +1 (it has -1 as a root) and its quotient by x +1 is also palindromic.  An antipalindromic polynomial is a multiple of x -1 (it has 1 as a root) and its quotient by x -1 is palindromic.  An antipalindromic polynomial of even degree is a multiple of x 2 -1 (it has -1 and 1 as a roots) and its quotient by x 2 -1 is palindromic.  If p ( x ) is a palindromic polynomial of even degree 2 d , then there is a polynomial q of degree d such that x d q ( x +1/ x ) = p ( x ).   It results from these properties that the study of the roots of a polynomial of degree d that is either palindromic or antipalindromic may be reduced to the study of the roots of a polynomial of degree at most d /2.  Factorization  Factorization techniques (and the search for roots) follow on directly from the properties listed above.  For example, Property 5 yields an immediate factor x +1 for palindromic polynomials of odd degree.  As another example, Property 8 leads to the technique of dividing by x d and replacing x + 1 / x by X .  As an example of the latter technique suppose        x  4   +   x  2   +  1   =  0         superscript  x  4    superscript  x  2   1   0    x^{4}+x^{2}+1=0     Letting X = x + 1 / x , dividing by x 2 and deriving       X  2   =    x  2   +  2  +   1  /   x  2          superscript  X  2      superscript  x  2   2    1   superscript  x  2       X^{2}=x^{2}+2+1/x^{2}     we have the much simpler        X  2   -  1   =  0         superscript  X  2   1   0    X^{2}-1=0     which factorizes as        (   X  -  1   )    (   X  +  1   )    =  0          X  1     X  1    0    (X-1)(X+1)=0     so either ''X = 1 or X = - 1  The X = - 1 case yields       x  +   1  /  x    =   -  1         x    1  x      1     x+1/x=-1     or        x  2   +  x  +  1   =  0         superscript  x  2   x  1   0    x^{2}+x+1=0     which has no real roots.  The X = 1 case yields       x  +   1  /  x    =  1        x    1  x    1    x+1/x=1     or         x  2   -  x   +  1   =  0           superscript  x  2   x   1   0    x^{2}-x+1=0     which also has no real roots.  Converting other polynomials to palindromic form  Some polynomials can be converted to palindromic form by, for example, suitable substutions. For example consider       4   x  2    +   4  x   +  1        4   superscript  x  2      4  x   1    4x^{2}+4x+1   .  Writing y = 2 x this becomes       y  2   +   2  y   +  1       superscript  y  2     2  y   1    y^{2}+2y+1     or       (   y  +  1   )   2     superscript    y  1   2    (y+1)^{2}     with the resultant factorization       (    2  x   +  1   )   2     superscript      2  x   1   2    (2x+1)^{2}     Similar techniques might yield a polynomial in antipalindromic form.
