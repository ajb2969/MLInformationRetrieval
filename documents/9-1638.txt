Friedel's law

Friedel's law, named after Georges Friedel, is a property of Fourier transforms of real functions.1
Given a real function 
 
 
 
 , its Fourier transform



has the following properties.





where 
 
 
 
  is the complex conjugate of 
 
 
 
 .
Centrosymmetric points 
 
 
 
  are called Friedel's pairs.
The squared amplitude (
 
 
 
 ) is centrosymmetric:





The phase 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is antisymmetric:



 
 .

Friedel's law is used in X-ray diffraction, crystallography and scattering from real potential within the Born approximation. Note that a twin operation (aka Opération de maclage) is equivalent to an inversion centre and the intensities from the individuals are equivalent under Friedel's law.234
