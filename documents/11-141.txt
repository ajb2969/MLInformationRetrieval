   Nonhypotenuse number      Nonhypotenuse number   In mathematics , a nonhypotenuse number is a natural number whose square cannot be written as the sum of two nonzero squares. The name stems from the fact that an edge of length equal to a nonhypotenuse number cannot form the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle with integer sides .  The numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all nonhypotenuse numbers. The number 5, however, is not a nonhypotenuse number as 5 2 equals 3 2 + 4 2 .  The first fifty nonhypotenuse numbers are:   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 36, 38, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 54, 56, 57, 59, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 71, 72, 76, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84   Although nonhypotenuse numbers are common among small integers, they become more-and-more sparse for larger numbers. Yet, there are infinitely many nonhypotenuse numbers, and the number of nonhypotenuse numbers not exceeding a value x scales asymptotically with x/√(log x). 1  The nonhypotenuse numbers are those numbers that have no prime factors of the form 4k+1. 2 Equivalently, any number that cannot be put into the form    K   (    m  2   +   n  2    )       K     superscript  m  2    superscript  n  2      K(m^{2}+n^{2})   where K, m, and n are all positive integers, is never a nonhypotenuse number. A number whose prime factors are not all of the form 4k+1 cannot be the hypotenuse of a primitive triangle, but may still be the hypotenuse of a non-primitive triangle. 3  See also   Nonhypotenuse Numbers  Eta Numbers  Pythagorean theorem  Landau-Ramanujan constant  Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares   References  "  Category:Integer sequences     .
