   Countably generated space      Countably generated space   In mathematics , a topological space  X is called countably generated if the topology of X is determined by the countable sets in a similar way as the topology of a sequential space (or a Fréchet space ) by the convergent sequences.  The countable generated spaces are precisely the spaces having countable tightness - therefore the name countably tight is used as well.  Definition  A topological space X is called countably generated if V is closed in X whenever for each countable subspace  U of X the set    V  ∩  U      V  U    V\cap U   is closed in U . Equivalently, X is countably generated if and only if the closure of any subset A of X equals the union of closures of all countable subsets of A .  Properties  A quotient of countably generated space is again countably generated. Similarly, a topological sum of countably generated spaces is countably generated. Therefore the countably generated spaces form a coreflective subcategory of the category of topological spaces . They are the coreflective hull of all countable spaces.  Any subspace of a countably generated space is again countably generated.  Examples  Every sequential space (in particular, every metrizable space) is countably generated.  An example of a space which is countably generated but not sequential can be obtained, for instance, as a subspace of Arens–Fort space .  See also   The concept of finitely generated space is related to this notion.  Tightness is a cardinal function related to countably generated spaces and their generalizations.
