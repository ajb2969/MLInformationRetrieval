Lyapunov–Malkin theorem

The Lyapunov–Malkin theorem (named for Aleksandr Lyapunov and Ioel Gilevich Malkin) is a mathematical theorem detailing nonlinear stability of systems.1
Theorem
In the system of differential equations,



where, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in an m × m matrix, and X(x, y), Y(x, y) represent higher order nonlinear terms. If all eigenvalues of the matrix 
 
 
 
  have negative real parts, and X(x, y), Y(x, y) vanish when x = 0, then the solution x = 0, y = 0 of this system is stable with respect to (x, y) and asymptotically stable with respect to  x. If a solution (x(t), y(t)) is close enough to the solution x = 0, y = 0, then
