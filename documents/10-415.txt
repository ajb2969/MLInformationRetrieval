Krener's theorem

In mathematics, Krener's theorem is a result attributed to Arthur J. Krener in geometric control theory about the topological properties of attainable sets of finite-dimensional control systems. It states that any attainable set of a bracket-generating system has nonempty interior or, equivalently, that any attainable set has nonempty interior in the topology of the corresponding orbit. Heuristically, Krener's theorem prohibits attainable sets from being hairy.
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth control system, where 
 
 
 
  belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  belongs to a control set 
 
 
 
 . Consider the family of vector fields 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Lie algebra generated by 
 
 
 
  with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields. Given 
 
 
 
 , if the vector space 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks and consequences
Even if 
 
 
 
  is different from 
 
 
 
 , the attainable set from 
 
 
 
  has nonempty interior in the orbit topology, as it follows from Krener's theorem applied to the control system restricted to the orbit through 
 
 
 
 .
When all the vector fields in 
 
 
 
  are analytic, 
 
 
if and only if

 
  belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from 
 
 
 
 . This is a consequence of Krener's theorem and of the orbit theorem.
As a corollary of Krener's theorem one can prove that if the system is bracket-generating and if the attainable set from 
 
 
 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 , then the attainable set from 
 
 
 
  is actually equal to 
 
 
 
 .
