   Krener's theorem      Krener's theorem   In mathematics, Krener's theorem is a result attributed to Arthur J. Krener in geometric control theory about the topological properties of attainable sets of finite-dimensional control systems. It states that any attainable set of a bracket-generating system has nonempty interior or, equivalently, that any attainable set has nonempty interior in the topology of the corresponding orbit . Heuristically, Krener's theorem prohibits attainable sets from being hairy .  Theorem  Let      q  ˙    =   f   (  q  ,  u  )         normal-˙  q     f   q  u      {\ }\dot{q}=f(q,u)   be a smooth control system, where    q    q   {\ q}   belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold    M    M   \ M   and    u    u   \ u   belongs to a control set    U    U   \ U   . Consider the family of vector fields    ℱ  =   {   f   (  ⋅  ,  u  )    ∣   u  ∈  U   }       ℱ   conditional-set    f   normal-⋅  u      u  U      {\mathcal{F}}=\{f(\cdot,u)\mid u\in U\}   .  Let     Lie   ℱ      Lie  ℱ    \ \mathrm{Lie}\,\mathcal{F}   be the Lie algebra generated by   ℱ   ℱ   {\mathcal{F}}   with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields . Given     q   ∈  M      q  M    \ q\in M   , if the vector space        Lie   q    ℱ   =   {   g   (  q  )    ∣   g  ∈    Lie   ℱ    }          subscript  Lie  q   ℱ    conditional-set    g  q     g    Lie  ℱ       \ \mathrm{Lie}_{q}\,\mathcal{F}=\{g(q)\mid g\in\mathrm{Lie}\,\mathcal{F}\}   is equal to      T   q   M       subscript  T  q   M    \ T_{q}M   , then    q    q   \ q   belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from    q    q   \ q   .  Remarks and consequences  Even if      Lie  q    ℱ       subscript  Lie  q   ℱ    \mathrm{Lie}_{q}\,\mathcal{F}   is different from      T   q   M       subscript  T  q   M    \ T_{q}M   , the attainable set from    q    q   \ q   has nonempty interior in the orbit topology, as it follows from Krener's theorem applied to the control system restricted to the orbit through    q    q   \ q   .  When all the vector fields in    ℱ    ℱ   \ \mathcal{F}   are analytic,        Lie   q    ℱ   =    T  q   M          subscript  Lie  q   ℱ      subscript  T  q   M     \ \mathrm{Lie}_{q}\,\mathcal{F}=T_{q}M    if and only if     q    q   \ q   belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from    q    q   \ q   . This is a consequence of Krener's theorem and of the orbit theorem .  As a corollary of Krener's theorem one can prove that if the system is bracket-generating and if the attainable set from     q   ∈  M      q  M    \ q\in M   is dense in    M    M   \ M   , then the attainable set from    q    q   \ q   is actually equal to    M    M   \ M   .
