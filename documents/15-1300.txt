Mashreghi–Ransford inequality

In Mathematics, the Mashreghi–Ransford inequality is a bound on the growth rate of certain sequences. It is named after J. Mashreghi and T. Ransford.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of complex numbers, and let



and



We remind that the binomial coefficients are defined by



Assume that, for some
