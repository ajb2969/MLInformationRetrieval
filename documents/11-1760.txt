Yurii Shirokov

Yurii Shirokov, (Широков, Юрий Михайлович 21.6.1921—5.7.1980), writer, physicist, professor. Graduated from Moscow State University (Moscow) in 1948. Worked in the same university, then in the Steklov Mathematical Institute (Moscow). He wrote more than 100 scientific papers 1 and several monographs, among which the textbook "Nuclear Physics" is particularly relevant. .2
Algebra of generalized functions
 Yu.Shirokov had constructed the Algebra of Generalized functions.34 Then it was applied to various systems .567
Classical and quantum mechanics
Shirokov was, perhaps, not the first to mention that quantum mechanics has many classical limits. The Planck constant

 
  appears in many relations, and there are many options to keep some of parameters (or even to vary them all) as 
 
 
 
 . The most known limiting cases of quantum mechanics are classical waves and Newtonian mechanics. Shirokov has systematised the construction of classical limits of quantum mechanics, see .8
Development of Shirokov's ideas
The most important ideas about the quantum mechanics and the theoretical physics in general formulated by Shirokov are not yet developed.9 In particular, the field theory in terms of wave packets (i.e., without divergent terms and without divergent series) is not yet constructed.
