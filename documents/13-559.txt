Glicksberg's theorem

In the study of zero sum games, Glicksberg's theorem (also Glicksberg's existence theorem) is a result that shows certain games have a minimax value .1
If A and B are compact sets, and K is an upper semicontinuous or lower semicontinuous function on 
 
 
 
 , then



where f and g run over Borel probability measures on A and B.
The theorem is useful if f and g are interpreted as mixed strategies of two players in the context of a continuous game. If the payoff function K is upper semicontinuous, then the game has a value.
The continuity condition may not be dropped: see example of a game with no value.
