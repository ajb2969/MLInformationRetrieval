   Metric differential      Metric differential   In mathematical analysis , a metric differential is a generalization of a derivative for a Lipschitz continuous function defined on a Euclidean space and taking values in an arbitrary metric space . With this definition of a derivative, one can generalize Rademarcher's theorem to metric space-valued Lipschitz functions.  Discussion  Rademacher's theorem states that a Lipschitz map f : R n → R m is differentiable almost everywhere in R n ; in other words, for almost every x , f is approximately linear in any sufficiently small range of x . If f is a function from a Euclidean space R n that takes values instead in a metric space  X , it doesn't immediately make sense to talk about differentiability since X has no linear structure a priori. Even if you assume that X is a Banach space and ask whether a Fréchet derivative exists almost everywhere, this does not hold. For example, consider the function f : [0,1] → L 1 ([0,1]), mapping the unit interval into the space of integrable functions , defined by f ( x ) = χ [0, x ] , this function is Lipschitz (and in fact, an isometry ) since, if 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1, then        |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     |   =    ∫  0  1     |     χ   [  0  ,  x  ]     (  t  )    -    χ   [  0  ,  y  ]     (  t  )     |   d  t    =     ∫  x  y     d  t    =   |   x  -  y   |    ,              f  x     f  y       superscript   subscript   0   1            subscript  χ   0  x    t      subscript  χ   0  y    t     d  t           superscript   subscript   x   y     d  t             x  y       |f(x)-f(y)|=\int_{0}^{1}|\chi_{[0,x]}(t)-\chi_{[0,y]}(t)|\,dt=\int_{x}^{y}\,dt%
 =|x-y|,     but one can verify that lim h →0 ( f ( x + h ) − f ( x ))/ h does not converge to an L 1 function for any x in [0,1], so it is not differentiable anywhere.  However, if you look at Rademacher's theorem as a statement about how a Lipschitz function stabilizes as you zoom in on almost every point, then such a theorem exists but is stated in terms of the metric properties of f instead of its linear properties.  Definition and existence of the metric differential  A substitute for a derivative of f : R n → X is the metric differential of f at a point z in R n which is a function on R n defined by the limit       M  D   (  f  ,  z  )    (  x  )    =    lim   r  →  0       d  X    (   f   (   z  +   r  x    )    ,   f   (  z  )    )    r          M  D   f  z   x     subscript    normal-→  r  0         subscript  d  X      f    z    r  x       f  z     r      MD(f,z)(x)=\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{d_{X}(f(z+rx),f(z))}{r}   whenever the limit exists (here d X denotes the metric on X ).  A theorem due to Bernd Kirchheim 1 states that a Rademacher theorem in terms of metric differentials holds: for almost every z in R n , MD( f , z ) is a seminorm and          d  X    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    -   M  D   (  f  ,  z  )    (   x  -  y   )     =   o   (    |   x  -  z   |   +   |   y  -  z   |    )     .           subscript  d  X      f  x     f  y       M  D   f  z     x  y       o        x  z        y  z        d_{X}(f(x),f(y))-MD(f,z)(x-y)=o(|x-z|+|y-z|).\,     The little-o notation employed here means that, at values very close to z , the function f is approximately an isometry from R n with respect to the seminorm MD( f , z ) into the metric space X .
