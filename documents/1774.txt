   Oersted      Oersted   Oersted (abbreviated as Oe ) is the unit of the auxiliary magnetic field H in the CGS system of units. It is identical to Dyne / Maxwell .  Difference between CGS and SI systems  In CGS the unit of H-field is the oersted and the unit of B‑field is the gauss . In the SI system, ampere per meter ( A/m ), which is equivalent to Newton / Weber , is used for H‑field and Tesla is used for B‑field. 1  History  The unit was established by the IEC in 1930 2 in honour of the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted . Ørsted discovered the relationship between magnetism and electric current when a magnetic field produced in a current-carrying coil deflected an ammeter (an instrument used to measure current) when it was switched on and off.  Definition  The oersted is defined as a dyne per unit pole . 3 The oersted is 1000/4π (≈79.5774715) amperes per meter, in terms of SI units . 4 5 6 7  The H-field strength inside a long solenoid wound with 79.58 turns per meter of a wire carrying 1 A is approximately 1 oersted. The preceding statement is exactly correct if the solenoid considered is infinite in length with the current evenly distributed over its surface.  The oersted is closely related to the gauss , the CGS unit of magnetic flux density. In a vacuum, if the magnetizing field strength is 1 Oe, then the magnetic field density is 1 G , whereas, in a medium having permeability    μ   μ   \mu    r (relative to permeability of vacuum), their relation is:       B   (  G  )    =    μ  r   H   (  Oe  )          B  G      subscript  μ  r   H  Oe     B(\mbox{G})=\mu_{r}H(\mbox{Oe})     Because oersteds are used to measure magnetizing field strength, they are also related to the magnetomotive force (mmf) of current in a single-winding wire-loop:       H   (  Oe  )    =     4  π   1000     I   (  A  )     l   (  m  )            H  Oe         4  π   1000       I  A     l  m       H(\mbox{Oe})=\frac{4\pi}{1000}\frac{I(\mbox{A})}{l(\mbox{m})}    8  Stored energy  The stored energy in a magnet, called magnet performance or maximum energy product (often abbreviated BH max ), is typically measured in units of megagauss-oersteds (MGOe). One MGOe is approximately equal to 7957.74715 J/m 3 . 9  See also   Centimetre gram second system of units  Ampere's model of magnetization   References  "  Category:Centimetre–gram–second system of units  Category:Units of magnetic induction     Kaye, G.
