   Lorden's inequality      Lorden's inequality   In probability theory , Lorden's inequality is a bound for the moments of overshoot for a stopped sum of random variables , first published by Gary Lorden in 1970. 1 Overshoots play a central role in renewal theory . 2  Statement of inequality  Let X 1 , X 2 , ... be independent and identially distributed positive random variables and define the sum S n = X 1 + X 2 + ... + X n . Consider the first time S n exceeds a given value b and at that time compute R b = S n − b . R b is called the overshoot or excess at b . Lorden's inquality states that the expectation of this overshoot is bounded as 3          E   (   R  b   )    ≤    E   (   X  2   )     E   (  X  )      .       normal-E   subscript  R  b       normal-E   superscript  X  2     normal-E  X      \operatorname{E}(R_{b})\leq\frac{\operatorname{E}(X^{2})}{\operatorname{E}(X)}.        Proof  Three proofs are known due to Lorden, 4 Carlsson and Nerman 5 and Chang. 6  See also   Wald's equation   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes  Category:Probabilistic inequalities     ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩
