   Acetoacetyl-CoA synthase      Acetoacetyl-CoA synthase   Acetoacetyl-CoA synthase (, NphT7 ) is an enzyme with system name acetyl-CoA:malonyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (decarboxylating) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    acetoacetyl-CoA + CoA + CO 2    The enzyme from the soil  bacterium  Streptomyces sp. CL190 produces acetoacetyl-CoA.  References  External links     "  Category:EC 2.3.1     ↩
