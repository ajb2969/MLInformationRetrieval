   Dyadic distribution      Dyadic distribution   A dyadic distribution is a specific type of discrete or categorical probability distribution that is of some theoretical importance in data compression .  Definition  A dyadic distribution on the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, ... is a probability distribution whose probability mass function is        f   (  u  )    =   2   -   n  u      ,   u  ∈  U      formulae-sequence      f  u    superscript  2     subscript  n  u        u  U     f(u)=2^{-n_{u}},\quad u\in U     where n u is some (positive) integer . More generally it is a categorical distribution in which the probability assigned to any label is of the above form  It is possible to find a code defined on this distribution, which has an average code length that is equal to the entropy .
