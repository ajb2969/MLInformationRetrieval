Holo-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase




Holo-(acyl-carrier-protein) synthase

In enzymology, a holo-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:
CoA-[4'-phosphopantetheine] + apo-acyl carrier protein

 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + holo-acyl carrier protein
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CoA-[4'-phosphopantetheine]:apo-[acyl-carrier-protein] 4'-pantetheinephosphotransferase. Other names in common use include acyl carrier protein holoprotein (holo-ACP) synthetase, holo-ACP synthetase, coenzyme A:fatty acid synthetase apoenzyme 4'-phosphopantetheine, transferase, holosynthase, acyl carrier protein synthetase, holo-ACP synthase, PPTase, AcpS, ACPS, acyl carrier protein synthase, P-pant transferase, and CoA:apo-[acyl-carrier-protein] pantetheinephosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.
