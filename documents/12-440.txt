Beltrami identity

The Beltrami identity, named after Eugenio Beltrami, is a simplified and less general version of the Euler–Lagrange equation in the calculus of variations.
The Euler–Lagrange equation serves to extremize action functionals of the form1
$$I[u]=\int_a^b L[x,u(x),u'(x)] \, dx \, ,$$ where $a , b$ are constants and $u ′(x) = du / dx$.
For the special case of $∂ L / ∂ x = 0$, the Euler–Lagrange equation reduces to the Beltrami identity,2
where $C$ is a constant.3
Derivation
The following derivation of the Beltrami identity4 starts with the Euler–Lagrange equation,
$$\frac{\part L}{\part u} =\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\part L}{\part u'} \, .$$ Multiplying both sides by $u ′$,
$$u'\frac{\part L}{\part u} =u'\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\part L}{\part u'} \, .$$
According to the chain rule,
$${dL \over dx} = {\part L \over \part u}u' +  {\part L \over \part u'}u'' + {\part L \over \part x}  \, ,$$ where  du′/dx {{=}} d2u / dx2}}.
Rearranging this yields
$$u' {\part L \over \part u} = {dL \over dx}  - {\part L \over \part u'}u'' - {\part L \over \part x} \, .$$ Thus, substituting this expression for $u ′ ∂ L /∂ u$ into the second equation of this derivation,
$${dL \over dx}  - {\part L \over \part u'}u'' - {\part L \over \part x} -u'\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\part L}{\part u'} = 0 \, .$$ By the product rule, the last term is re-expressed as
$$u'\frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}=\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}u' \right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}u'' \, ,$$ and rearranging,
$${d \over dx} \left( { L - u'\frac{\part L}{\part u'} } \right) = {\part L \over \part x}  \, .$$
For the case of $∂ L / ∂ x = 0$, this reduces to
$${d \over dx} \left( { L - u'\frac{\part L}{\part u'} } \right) = 0 \, ,$$ so that taking the antiderivative results in the Beltrami identity,
$$L - u'\frac{\part L}{\part u'}   = C \, ,$$ where $C$ is a constant.
Application
An example of an application of the Beltrami identity is the Brachistochrone problem, which involves finding the curve $y = y ( x )$ that minimizes the integral
$$I[y] = \int_0^a \sqrt { {1+y'^{\, 2}} \over y } dx \, .$$ The integrand
$$L(y,y') = \sqrt{ {1+y'^{\, 2}} \over y }$$ does not depend explicitly on the variable of integration $x$, so the Beltrami identity applies,
$$L-y'\frac{\part L}{\part y'}=C \, .$$ Substituting for $L$ and simplifying,
$$y(1+y'^{\, 2}) = 1/C^2  ~~\text {(constant)} \, ,$$ which can be solved with the result put in the form of parametric equations
$$x = A(\phi - \sin \phi)$$
$$y = A(1 - \cos \phi)$$ with $A$ being half the above constant, 1/(2C ²), and $φ$ being a variable. These are the parametric equations for a cycloid.5
