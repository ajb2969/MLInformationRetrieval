   65537-gon      65537-gon   In geometry , a 65537-gon is a polygon with 65537 sides. The sum of the interior angles of any non-self-intersecting 65537-gon is 23592600°.  The area of a regular 65537-gon is (with )      A  =    65537  4    t  2    cot   π  65537         A      65537  4    superscript  t  2       π  65537       A=\frac{65537}{4}t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{65537}     A whole regular 65537-gon is not visually discernible from a circle, and its perimeter differs from that of the circumscribed circle by about 15 parts per billion .  Regular 65537-gon construction  The regular 65537-gon (one with all sides equal and all angles equal) is of interest for being a constructible polygon : that is, it can be constructed using a compass and an unmarked straightedge). This is because 65537 is a Fermat prime , being of the form 2 2 n + 1 (in this case n = 4). Thus, the values    cos   π  65537         π  65537     \cos\frac{\pi}{65537}   and    cos    2  π   65537           2  π   65537     \cos\frac{2\pi}{65537}   are 32768-degree algebraic numbers , and like any constructible numbers they can be written in terms of square roots and no higher-order roots.  Although it was known to Gauss by 1801 that the regular 65537-gon was constructible, the first explicit constructions of a regular 65537-gon was given by Johann Gustav Hermes (1894). The construction is very complex; Hermes spent 10 years completing the 200-page manuscript. 1 Another method involves the use of at most 1332 Carlyle circles , and the first stages of this method are pictured below. This method faces practical problems, as one of these Carlyle circles solves the quadratic equation  x 2 + x − 16384 = 0 (16384 being 2 14 ). 2  (Figure)  Regular 65537-gon First Carlyle Circle.gif   65537-gram  A 65537-gram is a 65537-sided star polygon . As 65537 is prime, there are 32767 regular forms generated by Schläfli symbols {65537/ n } for all integers 2 ≤ n ≤ 32768 as     ⌊   65537  2   ⌋   =  32768          65537  2    32768    \left\lfloor\frac{65537}{2}\right\rfloor=32768   .
