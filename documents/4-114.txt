   Tridecagon      Tridecagon   In geometry , a tridecagon (or triskaidecagon ) is a polygon with 13 sides and angles.  A regular tridecagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {13}.  Regular tridecagon  The measure of each internal angle of a regular tridecagon is approximately 152.308 degrees , and the area with side length a is given by       A  =    13  4    a  2    cot   π  13     ≃    13.1858    a  2     .        A      13  4    superscript  a  2       π  13       similar-to-or-equals      13.1858   superscript  a  2       A=\frac{13}{4}a^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{13}\simeq 13.1858\,a^{2}.     Numismatic use  The regular tridecagon is used as the shape of the Czech 20 korun coin . 1      Related polygons  A tridecagram is a 13-sided star polygon . There are 5 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols : {13/2}, {13/3}, {13/4}, {13/5}, and {13/6}.
