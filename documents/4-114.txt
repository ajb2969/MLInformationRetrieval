Tridecagon

In geometry, a tridecagon (or triskaidecagon) is a polygon with 13 sides and angles.
A regular tridecagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {13}.
Regular tridecagon
The measure of each internal angle of a regular tridecagon is approximately 152.308 degrees, and the area with side length a is given by



Numismatic use
The regular tridecagon is used as the shape of the Czech 20 korun coin.1

  AME1 = 27.6923076923115...° ; 360° : 13 = 27.692307692307692307...° ; 
 
 
 
  AME1 - 360° : 13 = 3.80...E-12°
Example to illustrating the error: At a circumscribed circle radius r = 100 million km, the absolute error of the 1st side would be approximately -2.85 mm.
