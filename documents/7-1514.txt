   Sunrise equation      Sunrise equation   (Figure)  A contour plot of the hours of daylight as a function of latitude and day of the year, using the most accurate models described in Sunrise equation, Latitude 40° N (approximately New York City, Madrid and Beijing) is highlighted for reference   The sunrise equation as follows can be used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset for any solar declination and latitude in terms of local solar time when sunrise and sunset actually occur:       cos   ω  ∘    =   -    tan  ϕ   ×   tan  δ            subscript  ω           ϕ     δ       \cos\omega_{\circ}=-\tan\phi\times\tan\delta     where:     ω  ∘     subscript  ω     \omega_{\circ}   is the hour angle at either sunrise (when negative value is taken) or sunset (when positive value is taken);     ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the latitude of the observer on the Earth ;     δ   δ   \delta   is the sun declination .  Theory of the equation  The Earth rotates at an angular velocity of 15°/hour, therefore the expression     ω  ∘   ×   hour   15  ∘         subscript  ω      hour   superscript  15       \omega_{\circ}\times\frac{\mathrm{hour}}{{15}^{\circ}}   gives the interval of time before and after local solar noon that sunrise or sunset will occur.  The sign convention is typically that the observer latitude   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is 0 at the Equator , positive for the Northern Hemisphere and negative for the Southern Hemisphere , and the solar declination   δ   δ   \delta   is 0 at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes when the sun is exactly above the Equator, positive during the Northern Hemisphere summer and negative during the Northern Hemisphere winter.  The expression above is always applicable for latitudes between the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle . North of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, there is at least one day of the year with no sunrise or sunset. Formally, there is a sunrise or sunset when      -   90  ∘    +  δ   <  ϕ  <    90  ∘   -  δ              superscript  90     δ   ϕ          superscript  90    δ      -90^{\circ}+\delta<\phi<90^{\circ}-\delta   during the Northern Hemisphere summer, and when      -   90  ∘    -  δ   <  ϕ  <    90  ∘   +  δ              superscript  90     δ   ϕ          superscript  90    δ      -90^{\circ}-\delta<\phi<90^{\circ}+\delta   during the Northern Hemisphere winter. Out of these latitudes, it is either 24-hour daytime or 24-hour nighttime .  Generalized equation  Also note that the above equation neglects the influence of atmospheric refraction (which lifts the solar disc by approximately 0.6° when it is on the horizon) and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc (about 0.5°). The times of the rising and the setting of the upper solar limb as given in astronomical almanacs correct for this by using the more general equation       cos   ω  ∘    =     sin  a   -    sin  ϕ   ×   sin  δ       cos  ϕ   ×   cos  δ            subscript  ω           a       ϕ     δ         ϕ     δ       \cos\omega_{\circ}=\dfrac{\sin a-\sin\phi\times\sin\delta}{\cos\phi\times\cos\delta}     with the altitude (a) of the center of the solar disc set to about −0.83° (or −50 arcminutes).  Complete calculation on Earth  The generalized equation relies on a number of other variables which need to be calculated before it can itself be calculated. These equations have the solar-earth constants substituted with angular constants expressed in degrees.

Declination of the Sun       sin  δ   =    sin  λ   ×   sin   23.45  ∘           δ       λ      superscript  23.45        \sin\delta=\sin\lambda\times\sin 23.45^{\circ}     where:     δ   δ   \delta   is the declination of the sun.

For observations on a sea horizon an elevation-of-observer correction, add    -     1.15  ∘    elevation in feet    /   60  ∘             superscript  1.15      elevation in feet     superscript  60       -1.15^{\circ}\sqrt{\text{elevation in feet}}/60^{\circ}   , or    -     2.076  ∘    elevation in metres    /   60  ∘             superscript  2.076      elevation in metres     superscript  60       -2.076^{\circ}\sqrt{\text{elevation in metres}}/60^{\circ}   to the -0.83° in the numerator's sine term. This corrects for both apparent dip and terrestrial refraction. For example, for an observer at 10,000 feet, add (-115°/60°) or about -1.92° to -0.83°.
