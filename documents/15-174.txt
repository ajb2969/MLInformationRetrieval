The tessellation fills space by 7-simplex , rectified 7-simplex , birectified 7-simplex , and trirectified 7-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.  A7 lattice  This vertex arrangement is called the A7 lattice or 7-simplex lattice . The 56 vertices of the expanded 7-simplex  vertex figure represent the 56 roots of the     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   Coxeter group. 1 It is the 7-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb . Around each vertex figure are 254 facets: 8+8 7-simplex , 28+28 rectified 7-simplex , 56+56 birectified 7-simplex , 70 trirectified 7-simplex , with the count distribution from the 9th row of Pascal's triangle .       E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   contains     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   as a subgroup of index 144. 2 Both     E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   and     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   can be seen as affine extensions from    A  7     subscript  A  7    A_{7}   from different nodes:  The A     7     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   7    {}^{2}_{7}   lattice can be constructed as the union of two A 7 lattices, and is identical to the E7 lattice .      ∪  = .  The A     7     4     subscript   superscript  absent  4   7    {}^{4}_{7}   lattice is the union of four A 7 lattices, which is identical to the E7* lattice (or E     7     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   7    {}^{2}_{7}   ).      ∪  ∪  ∪ .  The A     7     *     subscript   superscript  absent    7    {}^{*}_{7}   lattice (also called A     7     8     subscript   superscript  absent  8   7    {}^{8}_{7}   ) is the union of eight A 7 lattices, and has the vertex arrangement to the dual honeycomb of the omnitruncated 7-simplex honeycomb , and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 7-simplex .      ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of .  Related polytopes and honeycombs  Projection by folding  The 7-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional tesseractic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement :           A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}                C  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  C   4    {\tilde{C}}_{4}         See also  Regular and uniform honeycombs in 7-space:   7-cubic honeycomb  7-demicubic honeycomb  Truncated 7-simplex honeycomb  Omnitruncated 7-simplex honeycomb  E7 honeycomb   Notes  References   Norman Johnson  Uniform Polytopes , Manuscript (1991)  Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings of H.S.M.
