   Stellar-wind bubble      Stellar-wind bubble   Stellar-wind bubble is the astronomical term usually used to describe a cavity light years across filled with hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by the high-velocity (several thousand km/s) stellar wind from a single massive star of type  O or B . Weaker stellar winds still blow bubble structures though, and these are also called astrospheres . The heliosphere blown by the solar wind , within which all the major planets of the Solar System are embedded, is a small example of a stellar-wind bubble.  Stellar-wind bubbles have a two-shock structure. 1 The freely-expanding stellar wind hits an inner termination shock, where its kinetic energy is thermalized, producing 10 6  K , X-ray emitting plasma . The hot, high-pressure, shocked wind expands, driving a shock into the surrounding interstellar gas. If the surrounding gas is dense enough (number densities    n  >   0.1   cm   -  3         n    0.1   superscript  cm    3       n>0.1\mbox{ cm}^{-3}   or so), the swept up gas radiatively cools far faster than the hot interior, forming a thin, relatively dense shell around the hot, shocked wind.
