Monoterpenyl-diphosphatase




Monoterpenyl-diphosphatase

In enzymology, a monoterpenyl-diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

monoterpenyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  monoterpenol + diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are monoterpenyl diphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are monoterpenol and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on diphosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is monoterpenyl-diphosphate diphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include bornyl pyrophosphate hydrolase, and monoterpenyl-pyrophosphatase.
