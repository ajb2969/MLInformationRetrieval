   Magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase      Magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase   In enzymology , a magnesium protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + magnesium protoporphyrin IX   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + magnesium protoporphyrin IX 13-methyl ester   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and magnesium protoporphyrin IX , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and magnesium protoporphyrin IX 13-methyl ester .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:magnesium-protoporphyrin-IX O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .
