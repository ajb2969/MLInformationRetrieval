The input data   d   d   d   is shown on the left, and is the sum of CMB, which is a Gaussian random field which is strongly correlated in real space (but diagonal in frequency space), and a noise field, which has independent values in each pixel, but increasing standard deviation towards the edge. The signal and noise have covariance   S   S   S   and   N   N   N   respectively.  The center panel shows the Wiener-filtered result , computed via     s  ^   =     (    S   -  1    +   N   -  1     )    -  1     N   -  1    d        normal-^  s      superscript     superscript  S    1     superscript  N    1       1     superscript  N    1    d     \hat{s}=(S^{-1}+N^{-1})^{-1}N^{-1}d   .  The right panel shows the true input signal .  Licensing  "
