Seashell surface

 In mathematics, a seashell surface is a surface made by a circle which spirals up the z-axis while decreasing its own radius and distance from the z-axis. Not all seashell surfaces describe actual seashells found in nature.
Parametrization
The following is a parameterization of one seashell surface:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 \\
Various authors have suggested different models for the shape of shell. David M. Raup proposed a model where there is one magnification for the x-y plane, and another for the x-z plane. Chris Illert1 proposed a model where the magnification is scalar, and the same for any sense or direction with an equation like


 
  which starts with an initial generating curve 
 
 
 
  and applies a rotation and exponential magnification.
