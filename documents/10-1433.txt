   3-aci-nitropropanoate oxidase      3-aci-nitropropanoate oxidase   In enzymology , a 3-aci-nitropropanoate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-aci-nitropropanoate + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxopropanoate + nitrite + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 3-aci-nitropropanoate , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 3-oxopropanoate , nitrite , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-aci-nitropropanoate:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called propionate-3-nitronate oxidase . It employs one cofactor , FMN .
