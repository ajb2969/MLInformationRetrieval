Almost simple group

In mathematics, a group is said to be almost simple if it contains a non-abelian simple group and is contained within the automorphism group of that simple group: if it fits between a (non-abelian) simple group and its automorphism group. In symbols, a group A is almost simple if there is a simple group S such that 
 
 

Examples

Trivially, nonabelian simple groups and the full group of automorphisms are almost simple, but proper examples exist, meaning almost simple groups that are neither simple nor the full automorphism group.
For 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  the symmetric group

 
  is the automorphism group of the simple alternating group

 
  so 
 
 
 
  is almost simple in this trivial sense.
For 
 
 
 
  there is a proper example, as

  and the projective general linear group

 
  also sit properly between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


Properties
The full automorphism group of a nonabelian simple group is a complete group (the conjugation map is an isomorphism to the automorphism group), but proper subgroups of the full automorphism group need not be complete.
Structure
By the Schreier conjecture, now generally accepted as a corollary of the classification of finite simple groups, the outer automorphism group of a finite simple group is a solvable group. Thus a finite almost simple group is an extension of a solvable group by a simple group.
