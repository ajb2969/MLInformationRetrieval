   Free-by-cyclic group      Free-by-cyclic group   In group theory , a group    G   G   G   is said to be free-by-cyclic if it has a free  normal subgroup    F   F   F   such that the quotient group      G  /  F      G  F    G/F     is cyclic .  In other words,   G   G   G   is free-by-cyclic if it can be expressed as a group extension of a free group by a cyclic group (NB there are two conventions for 'by').  If   F   F   F   is a finitely generated group we say that   G   G   G   is (finitely generated free)-by-cyclic (or (f.g. free)-by-cyclic).  References   A. Martino and E.
