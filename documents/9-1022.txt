Free-by-cyclic group

In group theory, a group

 
  is said to be free-by-cyclic if it has a free normal subgroup

 
  such that the quotient group



is cyclic.
In other words, 
 
 
 
 
  is free-by-cyclic if it can be expressed as a group extension of a free group by a cyclic group (NB there are two conventions for 'by').
If 
 
 
 
  is a finitely generated group we say that 
 
 
 
  is (finitely generated free)-by-cyclic (or (f.g. free)-by-cyclic).
