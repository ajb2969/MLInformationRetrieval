   Torsor (algebraic geometry)      Torsor (algebraic geometry)   In algebraic geometry, given a smooth algebraic group  G , a G -torsor or a principal G -bundle  P over a scheme X is a scheme (or even algebraic space ) with the action of G that is locally trivial in the given Grothendieck topology in the sense that the base change    Y   √ó  X   P      subscript   X   Y  P    Y\times_{X}P   along "some" covering map    Y  ‚Üí  X     normal-‚Üí  Y  X    Y\to X   is the trivial torsor     Y  √ó  G   ‚Üí  Y     normal-‚Üí    Y  G   Y    Y\times G\to Y   ( G acts only on the second factor). 1 Equivalently, a G -torsor P on X is a principal homogeneous space for the group scheme      G  X   =   X  √ó  G        subscript  G  X     X  G     G_{X}=X\times G   (i.e.,    G  X     subscript  G  X    G_{X}   acts simply transitively on   P   P   P   .)  The definition may be formulated in the sheaf-theoretic language: a sheaf P on the category of X -schemes with some Grothendieck topology is a G -torsor if there is a covering    {    U  i   ‚Üí  X   }      normal-‚Üí   subscript  U  i   X     \{U_{i}\to X\}   in the topology, called the local trivialization, such that the restriction of P to each    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is a trivial    G   U  i      subscript  G   subscript  U  i     G_{U_{i}}   -torsor.  A line bundle is nothing but a    ùîæ  m     subscript  ùîæ  m    \mathbb{G}_{m}   -bundle, and, like a line bundle, the two points of views of torsors, geometric and sheaf-theoretic, are used interchangeably (by permitting P to be a stack like an algebraic space if necessary 2 ).  Examples and basic properties  Examples   A    G   L  n       G   subscript  L  n     GL_{n}   -torsor on X is a vector bundle of rank n (i.e., a locally free sheaf) on X .  If    L  /  K      L  K    L/K   is a finite  Galois extension , then     Spec  L   ‚Üí   Spec  K      normal-‚Üí   Spec  L    Spec  K     \operatorname{Spec}L\to\operatorname{Spec}K   is a    Gal   (   L  /  K   )      Gal    L  K     \operatorname{Gal}(L/K)   -torsor (roughly because the Galois group acts simply transitively on the roots.) This fact is a basis for Galois descent . See integral extension for a generalization.   Remark: A G -torsor P over X is isomorphic to a trivial torsor if and only if     P   (  X  )    =   Mor   (  X  ,  P  )          P  X    Mor  X  P     P(X)=\operatorname{Mor}(X,P)   is nonempty. (Proof: if there is an    s  :   X  ‚Üí  P      normal-:  s   normal-‚Üí  X  P     s:X\to P   , then      X  √ó  G   ‚Üí  P   ,    (  x  ,  g  )   ‚Ü¶   s   (  x  )   g       formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí    X  G   P    maps-to   x  g     s  x  g      X\times G\to P,(x,g)\mapsto s(x)g   is an isomorphism.)  Let P be a G -torsor with a local trivialization    {    U  i   ‚Üí  X   }      normal-‚Üí   subscript  U  i   X     \{U_{i}\to X\}   in √©tale topology. A trivial torsor admits a section: thus, there are elements     s  i   ‚àà   P   (   U  i   )         subscript  s  i     P   subscript  U  i      s_{i}\in P(U_{i})   . Fixing such sections    s  i     subscript  s  i    s_{i}   , we can write uniquely      s  i    g   i  j     =   s  j          subscript  s  i    subscript  g    i  j      subscript  s  j     s_{i}g_{ij}=s_{j}   on    U   i  j      subscript  U    i  j     U_{ij}   with     g   i  j    ‚àà   G   (   U   i  j    )         subscript  g    i  j      G   subscript  U    i  j       g_{ij}\in G(U_{ij})   . Different choices of    s  i     subscript  s  i    s_{i}   amount to 1-coboundaries in cohomology; that is, the    g   i  j      subscript  g    i  j     g_{ij}   define a cohomology class in the sheaf cohomology (more precisely ƒåech cohomology with sheaf coefficient) group     H  1    (  X  ,  G  )        superscript  H  1    X  G     H^{1}(X,G)   . 3 A trivial torsor corresponds to the identity element. Conversely, it is easy to see any class in     H  1    (  X  ,  G  )        superscript  H  1    X  G     H^{1}(X,G)   defines a G -torsor on X , unique up to an isomorphism.  If G is a connected algebraic group over a finite field    ùêÖ  q     subscript  ùêÖ  q    \mathbf{F}_{q}   , then any G -bundle over    Spec   ùêÖ  q      Spec   subscript  ùêÖ  q     \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{F}_{q}   is trivialy. ( Lang's theorem .)  Reduction of a structure group  Most of constructions and terminology regarding principal bundles in algebraic topology carry over in verbatim to G -bundles. For example, if    P  ‚Üí  X     normal-‚Üí  P  X    P\to X   is a G -bundle and G acts from the left on a scheme F , then one can form the associated bundle      P   √ó  G   F   ‚Üí  X     normal-‚Üí    superscript   G   P  F   X    P\times^{G}F\to X   with fiber F . In particular, if H is a closed subgroup of G , then for any H -bundle P ,    P   √ó  H   G      superscript   H   P  G    P\times^{H}G   is a G -bundle called the induced bundle .  If P is a G -bundle that is isomorphic to the induced bundle     P  ‚Ä≤    √ó  H   G      superscript   H    superscript  P  normal-‚Ä≤   G    P^{\prime}\times^{H}G   for some H -bundle P' , then P is said to admit a reduction of structure group from G to H .  Let X be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field k , G a semisimple algebraic group and P a G -bundle on a relative curve     X  R   =   X   √ó   Spec  k     Spec  R         subscript  X  R     subscript    Spec  k    X   Spec  R      X_{R}=X\times_{\operatorname{Spec}k}\operatorname{Spec}R   , R a finitely generated k -algebra. Then a theorem of Drinfeld and Simpson states that, if G is simply connected and split , there is an √©tale morphism     R  ‚Üí   R  ‚Ä≤      normal-‚Üí  R   superscript  R  normal-‚Ä≤     R\to R^{\prime}   such that    P   √ó   X  R     X   R  ‚Ä≤        subscript    subscript  X  R    P   subscript  X   superscript  R  normal-‚Ä≤      P\times_{X_{R}}X_{R^{\prime}}   admits a reduction of structure group to a Borel subgroup of G . 4 5  Invariants  If P is a parabolic subgroup of a smooth affine group scheme G with connected fibers, then its degree of instability, denoted by     deg  i    (  P  )       subscript  deg  i   P    \operatorname{deg}_{i}(P)   , is the degree of its Lie algebra    Lie   (  P  )      Lie  P    \operatorname{Lie}(P)   as a vector bundle on X . The degree of instability of G is then      deg  i    (  G  )    =   max   {    deg  i    (  P  )    |   P  ‚äÇ   G  parabolic subgroups    }          subscript  deg  i   G       subscript  deg  i   P     P    G  parabolic subgroups       \operatorname{deg}_{i}(G)=\max\{\operatorname{deg}_{i}(P)|P\subset G\text{ %
 parabolic subgroups}\}   . If G is an algebraic group and E is a G -torsor, then the degree of instability of E is the degree of the inner form      G    E   =    Aut  G    (  E  )         superscript  G  E     subscript  Aut  G   E     {}^{E}G=\operatorname{Aut}_{G}(E)   of G induced by E (which is a group scheme over X ); i.e.,      deg  i    (  E  )    =    deg  i    (   G    E   )          subscript  deg  i   E     subscript  deg  i    superscript  G  E      \operatorname{deg}_{i}(E)=\operatorname{deg}_{i}({}^{E}G)   . E is said to be semi-stable if      deg  i    (  E  )    ‚â§  0        subscript  deg  i   E   0    \operatorname{deg}_{i}(E)\leq 0   and is stable if      deg  i    (  E  )    <  0        subscript  deg  i   E   0    \operatorname{deg}_{i}(E)<0   .
