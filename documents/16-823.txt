Torsor (algebraic geometry)

In algebraic geometry, given a smooth algebraic group G, a G-torsor or a principal G-bundle P over a scheme X is a scheme (or even algebraic space) with the action of G that is locally trivial in the given Grothendieck topology in the sense that the base change 
 
 
 
  along "some" covering map 
 
 
 
  is the trivial torsor 
 
 
 
  (G acts only on the second factor).1 Equivalently, a G-torsor P on X is a principal homogeneous space for the group scheme

 
  (i.e., 
 
 
 
  acts simply transitively on 
 
 
 
 .)
The definition may be formulated in the sheaf-theoretic language: a sheaf P on the category of X-schemes with some Grothendieck topology is a G-torsor if there is a covering 
 
 
 
  in the topology, called the local trivialization, such that the restriction of P to each 
 
 
 
  is a trivial 
 
 
 
 -torsor.
A line bundle is nothing but a 
 
 
 
 -bundle, and, like a line bundle, the two points of views of torsors, geometric and sheaf-theoretic, are used interchangeably (by permitting P to be a stack like an algebraic space if necessary2).
Examples and basic properties
Examples

A 
 
 
 
 -torsor on X is a vector bundle of rank n (i.e., a locally free sheaf) on X.
If 
 
 
 
  is a finite Galois extension, then 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -torsor (roughly because the Galois group acts simply transitively on the roots.) This fact is a basis for Galois descent. See integral extension for a generalization.

Remark: A G-torsor P over X is isomorphic to a trivial torsor if and only if 
 
 
 
  is nonempty. (Proof: if there is an 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism.)
Let P be a G-torsor with a local trivialization 
 
 
 
  in étale topology. A trivial torsor admits a section: thus, there are elements 
 
 
 
 . Fixing such sections 
 
 
 
 , we can write uniquely 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Different choices of 
 
 
 
  amount to 1-coboundaries in cohomology; that is, the 
 
 
 
  define a cohomology class in the sheaf cohomology (more precisely Čech cohomology with sheaf coefficient) group 
 
 
 
 .3 A trivial torsor corresponds to the identity element. Conversely, it is easy to see any class in 
 
 
 
  defines a G-torsor on X, unique up to an isomorphism.
If G is a connected algebraic group over a finite field 
 
 
 
 , then any G-bundle over 
 
 
 
  is trivialy. (Lang's theorem.)
Reduction of a structure group
Most of constructions and terminology regarding principal bundles in algebraic topology carry over in verbatim to G-bundles. For example, if 
 
 
 
  is a G-bundle and G acts from the left on a scheme F, then one can form the associated bundle

 
  with fiber F. In particular, if H is a closed subgroup of G, then for any H-bundle P, 
 
 
 
  is a G-bundle called the induced bundle.
If P is a G-bundle that is isomorphic to the induced bundle 
 
 
 
  for some H-bundle P', then P is said to admit a reduction of structure group from G to H.
Let X be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field k, G a semisimple algebraic group and P a G-bundle on a relative curve 
 
 
 
 , R a finitely generated k-algebra. Then a theorem of Drinfeld and Simpson states that, if G is simply connected and split, there is an étale morphism

 
  such that 
 
 
 
  admits a reduction of structure group to a Borel subgroup of G.45
Invariants
If P is a parabolic subgroup of a smooth affine group scheme G with connected fibers, then its degree of instability, denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the degree of its Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  as a vector bundle on X. The degree of instability of G is then 
 
 
 
 . If G is an algebraic group and E is a G-torsor, then the degree of instability of E is the degree of the inner form

 
  of G induced by E (which is a group scheme over X); i.e., 
 
 
 
 . E is said to be semi-stable if 
 
 
 
  and is stable if 
 
 
 
 .
