== Summary == The plot showing the dependence of the histogram 
 
 
 
  on g at 
 
 
 
 . There is a logarithmical scale on the y-axis , while on the x-axis there is a linear scale. The values of 
 
 
 
  obtained from the computer search are represented by small circles. The points oscillate with main period 6. Let us mention ``local'' spikes at 
 
 
 
 . Especially well profound are spikes at 
 
 
 
 , and for 
 
 
 
  also at its multiplicity g=420 (second harmonic).
