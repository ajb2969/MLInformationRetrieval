   File:Gaps.jpg      File:Gaps.jpg   == Summary == The plot showing the dependence of the histogram     h  N    (  g  )        subscript  h  N   g    h_{N}(g)   on g at    N  =    2  20   ,   2  22   ,  …  ,   2  44        N    superscript  2  20    superscript  2  22   normal-…   superscript  2  44      N=2^{20},2^{22},\ldots,2^{44}   . There is a logarithmical scale on the y -axis , while on the x -axis there is a linear scale. The values of     h  N    (  g  )        subscript  h  N   g    h_{N}(g)   obtained from the computer search are represented by small circles. The points oscillate with main period 6. Let us mention ``local'' spikes at    g  =    30     (    =   2  ⋅  3  ⋅  5    )    ,  60  ,  …       g    annotated  30    absent   normal-⋅  2  3  5     60  normal-…     g=30(=2\cdot 3\cdot 5),60,\dots   . Especially well profound are spikes at    g  =  210  =   2  ⋅  3  ⋅  5  ⋅  7         g  210        normal-⋅  2  3  5  7      g=210=2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7   , and for     N  =   2  40    ,    N  =   2  42    ,   N  =   2  44        formulae-sequence    N   superscript  2  40     formulae-sequence    N   superscript  2  42      N   superscript  2  44       N=2^{40},~{}N=2^{42},~{}N=2^{44}   also at its multiplicity g=420 (second harmonic).
