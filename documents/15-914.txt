Carvone reductase () is an enzyme with system name (+)-dihydrocarvone:acceptor 1,6-oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) (+)-dihydrocarvone + acceptor 
 
 
 
  (-)-carvone + reduced acceptor
 
(2) (-)-isodihydrocarvone + acceptor 
 
 
 
  (+)-carvone + reduced acceptor
 

This enzyme participates in the carveol and dihydrocarveol degradation pathway of the Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14.
