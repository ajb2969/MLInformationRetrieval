   Halpern–Läuchli theorem      Halpern–Läuchli theorem   In mathematics , the Halpern–Läuchli theorem is a partition result about finite products of infinite trees . Its original purpose was to give a model for set theory in which the Boolean prime ideal theorem is true but the axiom of choice is false. It is often called the Halpern–Läuchli theorem, but the proper attribution for the theorem as it is formulated below is to Halpern–Läuchli–Laver–Pincus or HLLP (named after James D. Halpern, Hans Läuchli, Richard Laver , and David Pincus), following (Milliken 1979).  Let d,r \langle T_i: i \in d \rangle be a sequence of finitely splitting trees of height ω. Let      ⟨    T  i   :   i  ∈  d    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   subscript  T  i     i  d      \langle T_{i}:i\in d\rangle    strongly embedded in    𝕊  d     superscript  𝕊  d    \mathbb{S}^{d}   such that  $$\bigcup_{n \in \omega} \left(\prod_{i Alternatively, let
 
 : S^d_{\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle} = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} \left(\prod_{i and
 
 : \mathbb{S}^d=\bigcup_{\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle} S^d_{\langle T_i: i \in d \rangle}.$$ .  The HLLP theorem says that not only is the collection $\mathbb{S}^d$  partition regular for each d T= \langle T_i: i \in d \rangle.\  References   J.D. Halpern and H.
