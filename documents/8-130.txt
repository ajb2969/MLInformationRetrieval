   Polar set (potential theory)      Polar set (potential theory)   In mathematics , in the area of classical potential theory , polar sets are the "negligible sets", similar to the way in which sets of measure zero are the negligible sets in measure theory .  Definition  A set   Z   Z   Z   in     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   (where    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   ) is a polar set if there is a non-constant subharmonic function     u   u   u   on     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}     such that       Z  ⊆   {  x  :    u   (  x  )    =   -  ∞    }    .      Z   conditional-set  x      u  x           Z\subseteq\{x:u(x)=-\infty\}.     Note that there are other (equivalent) ways in which polar sets may be defined, such as by replacing "subharmonic" by "superharmonic", and    -  ∞         -\infty   by   ∞     \infty   in the definition above.  Properties  The most important properties of polar sets are:   A singleton set in     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   is polar.  A countable set in     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   is polar.  The union of a countable collection of polar sets is polar.  A polar set has Lebesgue measure zero in      \R   n   .     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}.      Nearly everywhere  A property holds nearly everywhere in a set S if it holds on S − E where E is a Borel polar set. If P holds nearly everywhere then it holds almost everywhere . 1  See also   Pluripolar set   References       External links     "  Category:Subharmonic functions     Ransford (1995) p.56 ↩
