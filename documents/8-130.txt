Polar set (potential theory)

In mathematics, in the area of classical potential theory, polar sets are the "negligible sets", similar to the way in which sets of measure zero are the negligible sets in measure theory.
Definition
A set 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
 ) is a polar set if there is a non-constant subharmonic function


 
  on 
 
 

such that



Note that there are other (equivalent) ways in which polar sets may be defined, such as by replacing "subharmonic" by "superharmonic", and 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  in the definition above.
Properties
The most important properties of polar sets are:

A singleton set in 
 
 
 
  is polar.
A countable set in 
 
 
 
  is polar.
The union of a countable collection of polar sets is polar.
A polar set has Lebesgue measure zero in 
 
 


Nearly everywhere
A property holds nearly everywhere in a set S if it holds on S−E where E is a Borel polar set. If P holds nearly everywhere then it holds almost everywhere.1
