In mathematics , Fisher's equation (named after statistician and biologist  Ronald Fisher , 1 also known as Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation , KPP equation or Fisher-KPP equation ) is the partial differential equation .         ∂  u    ∂  t    =    r  u   (   1  -  u   )    +   D     ∂  2   u    ∂   x  2        .          u     t        r  u    1  u      D      superscript   2   u      superscript  x  2         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=ru(1-u)+D\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}.\,     Fisher proposed this equation in 1937 in the context of population dynamics to describe the spatial spread of an advantageous allele and explored its travelling wave solutions. 2 For every wave speed    c  ≥   2    r  D         c    2      r  D       c\geq 2\sqrt{rD}   (    c  ≥  2      c  2    c\geq 2   in dimensionless form) it admits travelling wave solutions of the form        u   (  x  ,  t  )    =   v   (   x  ±   c  t    )    ≡   v   (  z  )     ,          u   x  t      v   plus-or-minus  x    c  t            v  z      u(x,t)=v(x\pm ct)\equiv v(z),\,     where   v   v   \textstyle v   is increasing and         lim   z  →   -  ∞      v   (  z  )     =  0   ,     lim   z  →  ∞     v   (  z  )     =  1.      formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  z          v  z    0       subscript    normal-→  z       v  z    1.     \lim_{z\rightarrow-\infty}v\left(z\right)=0,\quad\lim_{z\rightarrow\infty}v%
 \left(z\right)=1.     That is, the solution switches from the equilibrium state u = 0 to the equilibrium state u = 1. No such solution exists for c  3 4 The wave shape for a given wave speed is unique. The travelling-wave solutions are stable against near-field perturbations, but not to far-field perturbations which can thicken the tail. One can prove using the comparison principle and super-solution theory that all solutions with compact initial data converge to waves with the minimum speed.  For the special wave speed    c  =   ±   5  /   6         c   plus-or-minus    5    6       c=\pm 5/\sqrt{6}   , all solutions can be found in a closed form, 5 with       v   (  z  )    =    (   1  +   C  exp   (   ±   z  /   6     )     )    -  2          v  z    superscript    1    C  exp   plus-or-minus    z    6         2      v(z)=\left(1+C\mathrm{exp}\left(\pm{z}/{\sqrt{6}}\right)\right)^{-2}     where   C   C   C   is arbitrary, and the above limit conditions are satisfied for    C  >  0      C  0    C>0   .  It is perhaps the simplest example of a semilinear reaction-diffusion equation         ∂  u    ∂  t    =    Δ  u   +   F   (  u  )      ,          u     t        normal-Δ  u     F  u      \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\Delta u+F\left(u\right),     which can exhibit traveling wave solutions that switch between equilibrium states given by     f   (  u  )    =  0        f  u   0    f(u)=0   . Such equations occur, e.g., in ecology , physiology , combustion , crystallization , plasma physics , and in general phase transition problems.  Proof of the existence of traveling wave solutions and analysis of their properties is often done by the phase space method .
