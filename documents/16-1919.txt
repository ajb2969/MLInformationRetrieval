Diameter of a finite group

In group theory, the diameter of a group is a measure of a finite group's complexity.
Consider a finite group 
 
 
 
 , and any set of generators S. Define 
 
 
 
  to be the graph diameter the Cayley graph

 
 . Then the diameter of 
 
 
 
  is the maximal value of 
 
 
 
  taken over all generating sets S.
It is conjectured that, for all finite simple groups G, that
