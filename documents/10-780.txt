Iodophenol O-methyltransferase




Iodophenol O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, an iodophenol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2-iodophenol 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2-iodophenol methyl ether
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 2-iodophenol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 2-iodophenol methyl ether.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:2-iodophenol O-methyltransferase.
