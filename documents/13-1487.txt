Fundamental theorem of linear programming

In mathematical optimization, the fundamental theorem of linear programming states, in a weak formulation, that the maxima and minima of a linear function over a convex polygonal region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the line segment between them.
Statement
Consider the optimization problem



Where 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and 
 
 
 
  is an optimal solution to the problem, then 
 
 
 
  is either an extreme point (vertex) of 
 
 
 
 , or lies on a face 
 
 
 
  of optimal solutions.
Proof
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists some 
 
 
 
  such that the ball of radius 
 
 
 
  centered at 
 
 
 
  is contained in 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  and



Hence 
 
 
 
  is not an optimal solution, a contradiction. Therefore, 
 
 
 
  must live on the boundary of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is not a vertex itself, it must be the convex combination of vertices of 
 
 
 
 , say 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Observe that



Since 
 
 
 
  is an optimal solution, all terms in the sum are nonnegative. Since the sum is equal to zero, we must have that each individual term is equal to zero. Hence, 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
 , so every 
 
 
 
  is also optimal, and therefore all points on the face whose vertices are 
 
 
 
 , are optimal solutions.
