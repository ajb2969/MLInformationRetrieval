Moishezon manifold

In mathematics, a Moishezon manifold

 
  is a compact complex manifold such that the field of meromorphic functions on each component 
 
 
 
  has transcendence degree equal the complex dimension of the component:



Complex algebraic varieties have this property, but the converse is not true: Hironaka's example gives a smooth 3-dimensional Moishezon manifold that is not an algebraic variety or scheme.  showed that a Moishezon manifold is a projective algebraic variety if and only if it admits a KÃ¤hler metric.  showed that any Moishezon manifold carries an algebraic space structure; more precisely, the category of Moishezon spaces (similar to Moishezon manifolds, but are allowed to have singularities) is equivalent with the category of algebraic spaces that are proper over
