   Genetic distance      Genetic distance   Genetic distance is a measure of the genetic divergence between species or between populations within a species. 1 Populations with many similar genes have small genetic distances. This indicates that they are closely related and have a recent common ancestor .  Genetic distance is useful for reconstructing the history of populations. For example, evidence from genetic distance suggests that African and Eurasian people diverged about 100,000 years ago. 2 Genetic distance is also used for understanding the origin of biodiversity . For example, the genetic distances between different breeds of domesticated animals are often investigated in order to determine which breeds should be protected to maintain genetic diversity. 3  Biological foundation  In the genome of an organism , each gene is located at a specific place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, eye colour). However, most alleles do not have an observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift . By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated. 4  Measures of genetic distance  Although it is simple to define genetic distance as a measure of genetic divergence, there are several different statistical measures that have been proposed. This has happened because different authors considered different evolutionary models. The most commonly used are Nei's genetic distance, 5 Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards measure, 6 and Reynolds, Weir and Cockerham's genetic distance, 7 listed below.  In all the formulae in this section,   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   represent two different populations for which   L   L   L   loci have been studied. Let    X  u     subscript  X  u    X_{u}   represent the   u   u   u    th allele at the   l   l   l    th locus.  Nei's standard genetic distance  In 1972, Masatoshi Nei published what came to be known as Nei's standard genetic distance. This distance has the nice property that if the rate of genetic change (amino acid substitution) is constant per year or generation then Nei's standard genetic distance ( D ) increases in proportion to divergence time. This measure assumes that genetic differences are caused by mutation and genetic drift . 8      D  =   -   ln      ∑  l     ∑  u     X  u    Y  u         (    ∑  l     ∑  u    X  u  2     )    (    ∑  l     ∑  u    Y  u  2     )             D          subscript   l     subscript   u      subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u            subscript   l     subscript   u    superscript   subscript  X  u   2       subscript   l     subscript   u    superscript   subscript  Y  u   2            \displaystyle D=-\ln\frac{\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}X_{u}Y_{u}}{\sqrt{(%
 \sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}X_{u}^{2})(\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}Y_{u}^{%
 2})}}     This distance can also be expressed in terms of the arithmetic mean of gene identity. Let    j  X     subscript  j  X    j_{X}   be the probability for the two members of population   X   X   X   having the same allele at a particular locus and    j  Y     subscript  j  Y    j_{Y}   be the corresponding probability in population   Y   Y   Y   . Also, let    j   X  Y      subscript  j    X  Y     j_{XY}   be the probability for a member of   X   X   X   and a member of   Y   Y   Y   having the same allele. Now let    J  X     subscript  J  X    J_{X}   ,    J  Y     subscript  J  Y    J_{Y}   and    J   X  Y      subscript  J    X  Y     J_{XY}   represent the arithmetic mean of    j  X     subscript  j  X    j_{X}   ,    j  Y     subscript  j  Y    j_{Y}   and    j   X  Y      subscript  j    X  Y     j_{XY}   over all loci, respectively. In other words       J  X   =     ∑  l       ∑  u       X  u    2   L           subscript  J  X     subscript   l     subscript   u      superscript   subscript  X  u   2   L       \displaystyle J_{X}=\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}\frac{{X_{u}}^{2}}{L}          J  Y   =     ∑  l       ∑  u       Y  u    2   L           subscript  J  Y     subscript   l     subscript   u      superscript   subscript  Y  u   2   L       \displaystyle J_{Y}=\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}\frac{{Y_{u}}^{2}}{L}          J   X  Y    =     ∑  l       ∑  u        X  u    Y  u    L           subscript  J    X  Y      subscript   l     subscript   u        subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u    L       \displaystyle J_{XY}=\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}\frac{X_{u}Y_{u}}{L}     where   L   L   L   is the total number of loci examined. 9  Nei's standard distance can then be written as 10      D  =   -   ln     J   X  Y       J  X    J  Y             D         subscript  J    X  Y         subscript  J  X    subscript  J  Y          \displaystyle D=-\ln{\frac{J_{XY}}{\sqrt{J_{X}J_{Y}}}}     Cavalli-Sforza chord distance  In 1967 Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and A. W. F. Edwards published this measure. It assumes that genetic differences arise due to genetic drift only. One major advantage of this measure is that the populations are represented in a hypersphere, the scale of which is one unit per gene substitution. The chord distance in the hyperdimensional sphere is given by 11 12       D   C  H    =     2  π      2   (  1  -    ∑  l      ∑  u       X  u    Y  u   )             subscript  D    C  H        2  π      fragments  2   fragments  normal-(  1    subscript   l    subscript   u      fragments   subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u   normal-)          \displaystyle D_{CH}=\frac{2}{\pi}\sqrt{2(1-\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}%
 \sqrt{X_{u}Y_{u})}}     Some authors drop the factor    2  π      2  π    \frac{2}{\pi}   to simplify the formula at the cost of losing the property that the scale is one unit per gene substitution.  Reynolds, Weir, and Cockerham's genetic distance  In 1983, this measure was published by John Reynolds, B.S. Weir and C. Clark Cockerham. This measure assumes that genetic differentiation occurs only by genetic drift without mutations. It estimates the coancestry coefficient    Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   which provides a measure of the genetic divergence by: 13       Θ  w   =       ∑  l     ∑  u     (    X  u   -   Y  u    )   2      2    ∑  l    (   1  -    ∑  u     X  u    Y  u      )             subscript  normal-Θ  w         subscript   l     subscript   u    superscript     subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u    2       2    subscript   l     1    subscript   u      subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u            \displaystyle\Theta_{w}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}(X_{u}-Y_{u}%
 )^{2}}{2\sum\limits_{l}(1-\sum\limits_{u}X_{u}Y_{u})}}     Other measures of genetic distance  Many other measures of genetic distance have been proposed with varying success.  Nei's D A distance 1983  This distance assumes that genetic differences arise due to mutation and genetic drift , but this distance measure is known to give more reliable population trees than other distances particularly for microsatellite DNA data. 14 15       D  A   =   1  -     ∑  l       ∑  u        X  u    Y  u     /  L           subscript  D  A     1    subscript   l     subscript   u          subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u     L        \displaystyle D_{A}=1-\sum\limits_{l}\sum\limits_{u}\sqrt{X_{u}Y_{u}}/{L}     Euclidean distance       D   E  U    =      ∑  u      (    X  u   -   Y  u    )   2          subscript  D    E  U        subscript   u    superscript     subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u    2       \displaystyle D_{EU}=\sqrt{\sum\limits_{u}(X_{u}-Y_{u})^{2}}    16  Goldstein distance 1995  It was specifically developed for microsatellite markers and is based on the stepwise-mutation model (SMM).    μ  X     subscript  μ  X    \mu_{X}   and    μ  Y     subscript  μ  Y    \mu_{Y}   are the means of the allele frequencies in population X and Y. 17        (   δ  μ   )   2   =     ∑  l       (    μ  X   -   μ  Y    )   2   /  L         superscript    δ  μ   2     subscript   l      superscript     subscript  μ  X    subscript  μ  Y    2   L      \displaystyle(\delta\mu)^{2}=\sum\limits_{l}(\mu_{X}-\mu_{Y})^{2}/{L}     Nei's minimum genetic distance 1973  This measure assumes that genetic differences arise due to mutation and genetic drift . 18       D  m   =      (    J  X   +   J  Y    )   2    -   J   X  Y          subscript  D  m          subscript  J  X    subscript  J  Y    2    subscript  J    X  Y       \displaystyle D_{m}=\frac{(J_{X}+J_{Y})}{2}-J_{XY}     Roger's distance 1972       D  R   =     1  L         ∑  u     (    X  u   -   Y  u    )   2    2           subscript  D  R       1  L         subscript   u    superscript     subscript  X  u    subscript  Y  u    2    2       \displaystyle D_{R}=\frac{1}{L}\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{u}(X_{u}-Y_{u})^{2}}{2}}    19  Fixation index  A commonly used measure of genetic distance is the fixation index which varies between 0 and 1. A value of 0 indicates that two populations are genetically identical whereas a value of 1 indicates that two populations are different species. No mutation is assumed.
