   Photon antibunching      Photon antibunching    Photon antibunching generally refers to a light field with photons more equally spaced than a coherent laser field, 1 a signature being signals at appropriate detectors which are anticorrelated . More specifically, it can (but it need not 2 ) refer to sub-Poissonian photon statistics, that is a photon number distribution for which the variance is less than the mean. Nevertheless this kind of statistics was not observed directly with photon number resolving detector . A coherent state, as output by a laser far above threshold has Poissonian statistics yielding random photon spacing; while a thermal light field has super-Poissonian statistics and yields bunched photon spacing. In the thermal (bunched) case, the number of fluctuations is larger than a coherent state; for an antibunched source they are smaller. 3  The variance of the photon number distribution is        V  n   =   ⟨   Δ   n  2    ⟩   =    ⟨   n  2   ⟩   -    ⟨  n  ⟩   2    =    ⟨    (    a  †   a   )   2   ⟩   -    ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩   2     .         subscript  V  n    delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript  n  2             delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  n  2     superscript   delimited-⟨⟩  n   2            delimited-⟨⟩   superscript     superscript  a  normal-†   a   2     superscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a    2       V_{n}=\langle\Delta n^{2}\rangle=\langle n^{2}\rangle-\langle n\rangle^{2}=%
 \left\langle\left(a^{\dagger}a\right)^{2}\right\rangle-\langle a^{\dagger}a%
 \rangle^{2}.     Using commutation relations, this can be written as        V  n   =     ⟨     (   a  †   )   2    a  2    ⟩   +   ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩    -    ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩   2     .       subscript  V  n        delimited-⟨⟩     superscript   superscript  a  normal-†   2    superscript  a  2      delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a      superscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a    2      V_{n}=\langle{(a^{\dagger}})^{2}a^{2}\rangle+\langle a^{\dagger}a\rangle-%
 \langle a^{\dagger}a\rangle^{2}.     This can be written as         V  n   -   ⟨  n  ⟩    =    ⟨     (   a  †   )   2    a  2    ⟩   -    ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩   2     .         subscript  V  n    delimited-⟨⟩  n       delimited-⟨⟩     superscript   superscript  a  normal-†   2    superscript  a  2      superscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a    2      V_{n}-\langle n\rangle=\langle(a^{\dagger})^{2}a^{2}\rangle-\langle a^{\dagger%
 }a\rangle^{2}.     The second-order intensity correlation function (for zero delay time) is defined as         g   (  2  )     (  0  )    =    ⟨     (   a  †   )   2    a  2    ⟩     ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩   2     .         superscript  g  2   0      delimited-⟨⟩     superscript   superscript  a  normal-†   2    superscript  a  2      superscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a    2      g^{(2)}(0)={{\langle(a^{\dagger})^{2}a^{2}\rangle}\over{\langle a^{\dagger}a%
 \rangle^{2}}}.     This quantity is basically the probability of detecting two simultaneous photons, normalized by the probability of detecting two photons at once for a random photon source. Here and after we assume stationary counting statistics.  Then we have        1    (   ⟨  n  ⟩   )   2     (    V  n   -   ⟨  n  ⟩    )    =     g   (  2  )     (  0  )    -  1.           1   superscript   delimited-⟨⟩  n   2       subscript  V  n    delimited-⟨⟩  n          superscript  g  2   0   1.     {{1}\over{(\langle n\rangle)^{2}}}(V_{n}-\langle n\rangle)=g^{(2)}(0)-1.     Then we see that sub-Poisson photon statistics, one definition of photon antibunching, is given by      g   (  2  )     (  0  )    <  1         superscript  g  2   0   1    g^{(2)}(0)<1   . We can equivalently express antibunching by    Q  <  0      Q  0    Q<0   where the Mandel Q Parameter is defined as      Q  ≡     V  n    ⟨  n  ⟩    -  1.       Q       subscript  V  n    delimited-⟨⟩  n    1.     Q\equiv\frac{V_{n}}{\langle n\rangle}-1.     If the field had a classical stochastic process underlying it, say a positive definite probability distribution for photon number, the variance would have to be greater than or equal to the mean. This can be shown by an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the definition of     g   (  2  )     (  0  )        superscript  g  2   0    g^{(2)}(0)   . Sub-Poissonian fields violate this, and hence are nonclassical in the sense that there can be no underlying positive definite probability distribution for photon number (or intensity).  Photon antibunching by this definition was first observed by Kimble , Mandel , and Dagenais in resonance fluorescence . A driven atom cannot emit two photons at once, and so in this case      g   (  2  )     (  0  )    =  0.0         superscript  g  2   0   0.0    g^{(2)}(0)=0.0   . An experiment with more precision that did not require subtraction of a background count rate was done for a single atom in an ion trap by Walther et al.  A more general definition for photon antibunching concerns the slope of the correlation function away from zero time delay. It can also be shown by an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the time dependent intensity correlation function         g   (  2  )     (  τ  )    =    ⟨    a  †    (  0  )    a  †    (  τ  )   a   (  τ  )   a   (  0  )    ⟩     ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩   2     .         superscript  g  2   τ      delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   0   superscript  a  normal-†   τ  a  τ  a  0     superscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a    2      g^{(2)}(\tau)={{\langle a^{\dagger}(0)a^{\dagger}(\tau)a(\tau)a(0)\rangle}%
 \over{\langle a^{\dagger}a\rangle^{2}}}.     It can be shown that for a classical positive definite probability distribution to exist (i.e. for the field to be classical)      g   (  2  )     (  0  )    ≤    g   (  2  )     (  τ  )           superscript  g  2   0      superscript  g  2   τ     g^{(2)}(0)\leq g^{(2)}(\tau)   . 4 Hence a rise in the second order intensity correlation function at early times is also nonclassical. This initial rise is photon antibunching.  Another way of looking at this time dependent correlation function, inspired by quantum trajectory theory is        g   (  2  )     (  τ  )    =     ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩   C    ⟨    a  †   a   ⟩           superscript  g  2   τ      subscript   delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a    C    delimited-⟨⟩     superscript  a  normal-†   a       g^{(2)}(\tau)={{\langle a^{\dagger}a\rangle_{C}}\over{\langle a^{\dagger}a%
 \rangle}}     where         ⟨  O  ⟩   C   ≡   ⟨   Ψ  C   |  O  |   Ψ  C   ⟩    .       subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  O   C    quantum-operator-product   subscript  normal-Ψ  C   O   subscript  normal-Ψ  C      \langle O\rangle_{C}\equiv\langle\Psi_{C}|O|\Psi_{C}\rangle.     with    |   Ψ  C   ⟩     ket   subscript  normal-Ψ  C     |\Psi_{C}\rangle   is the state conditioned on previous detection of a photon at time    τ  =  0      τ  0    \tau=0   .
