   Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator      Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator   In mathematics , a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator is a type of integral transform . Specifically, given a domain (an open and connected set) Ω in n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n , a Hilbert–Schmidt kernel is a function k : Ω × Ω → C with        ∫  Ω     ∫  Ω       |   k   (  x  ,  y  )    |   2    d   x   d  y     <  ∞        subscript   normal-Ω     subscript   normal-Ω      superscript      k   x  y     2   d  x  d  y        \int_{\Omega}\int_{\Omega}|k(x,y)|^{2}\,dx\,dy<\infty     (that is, the L 2 (Ω×Ω; C ) norm of k is finite), and the associated Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator is the operator K : L 2 (Ω; C ) → L 2 (Ω; C ) given by         (   K  u   )    (  x  )    =    ∫  Ω    k   (  x  ,  y  )   u   (  y  )   d  y     .          K  u   x     subscript   normal-Ω     k   x  y   u  y  d  y      (Ku)(x)=\int_{\Omega}k(x,y)u(y)\,dy.     Then K is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator with Hilbert–Schmidt norm         ∥  K  ∥   HS   =    ∥  k  ∥    L  2     .       subscript   norm  K   HS    subscript   norm  k    superscript  L  2      \|K\|_{\mathrm{HS}}=\|k\|_{L^{2}}.     Hilbert–Schmidt integral operators are both continuous (and hence bounded) and compact (as with all Hilbert–Schmidt operators).  The concept of a Hilbert–Schmidt operator may be extended to any locally compact  Hausdorff spaces . Specifically, let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space equipped with a positive Borel measure . Suppose further that L 2 ( X ) is a separable  Hilbert space . The above condition on the kernel k on R n can be interpreted as demanding k belong to L 2 ( X × X ). Then the operator        (   K  f   )    (  x  )    =    ∫  X    k   (  x  ,  y  )   f   (  y  )   d  y            K  f   x     subscript   X     k   x  y   f  y  d  y      (Kf)(x)=\int_{X}k(x,y)f(y)\,dy   is compact . If       k   (  x  ,  y  )    =    k   (  y  ,  x  )    ¯         k   x  y     normal-¯    k   y  x       k(x,y)=\overline{k(y,x)}   then K is also self-adjoint and so the spectral theorem applies. This is one of the fundamental constructions of such operators, which often reduces problems about infinite-dimensional vector spaces to questions about well-understood finite-dimensional eigenspaces.
