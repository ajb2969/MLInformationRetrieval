   Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration      Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration   In measure-theoretic  analysis and related branches of mathematics , Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration generalizes Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue integration , preserving the many advantages of the former in a more general measure-theoretic framework. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure , and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.  Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals , named for Henri Leon Lebesgue and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes , are also known as Lebesgue–Radon integrals or just Radon integrals , after Johann Radon , to whom much of the theory is due. They find common application in probability and stochastic processes , and in certain branches of analysis including potential theory .  Definition  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral       ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  g   (  x  )        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  g  x     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)     is defined when    f  :    a  a   ,   b  →  𝐑       normal-:  f     a  a     b  normal-→  𝐑      f:aa,b→\mathbf{R}   is Borel - measurable and bounded and    g  :    a  a   ,   b  →  𝐑       normal-:  g     a  a     b  normal-→  𝐑      g:aa,b→\mathbf{R}   is of bounded variation in     a  a   ,  b       a  a   b    aa,b   and right-continuous, or when   f   f   f   is non-negative and   g   g   g   is monotone and right-continuous. To start, assume that   f   f   f   is non-negative and   g   g   g   is monotone non-decreasing and right-continuous. Define    w   (   (  s  ,  t  )   =  g   (  t  )   −  g   (  s  )       fragments  w   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-,  t  normal-)    g   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   −  g   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)      w((s,t)=g(t)−g(s)   and  (Alternatively, the construction works for   g   g   g   left-continuous,    w   (  s  s  ,  t  )   )  =  g  (  t  )  −  g  (  s  )     fragments  w   fragments  normal-(  s  s  normal-,  t  normal-)   normal-)   g  normal-(  t  normal-)  −  g  normal-(  s  normal-)    w(ss,t))=g(t)−g(s)   and ).  By Carathéodory's extension theorem , there is a unique Borel measure on     a  a   ,  b       a  a   b    aa,b   which agrees with   w   w   w   on every interval   I   I   I   . The measure arises from an outer measure (in fact, a metric outer measure ) given by        μ  g    (  E  )    =   inf   {    ∑  i     μ  g    (   I  i   )     :   E  ⊂    ⋃  i    I  i     }           subscript  μ  g   E    infimum   conditional-set    subscript   i      subscript  μ  g    subscript  I  i       E    subscript   i    subscript  I  i         \mu_{g}(E)=\inf\left\{\sum_{i}\mu_{g}(I_{i})\ :\ E\subset\bigcup_{i}I_{i}\right\}     the infimum taken over all coverings of   E   E   E   by countably many semiopen intervals. This measure is sometimes called 1 the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure associated with   g   g   g   .  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral       ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  g   (  x  )        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  g  x     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)     is defined as the Lebesgue integral of   f   f   f   with respect to the measure in the usual way. If   g   g   g   is non-increasing, then define         ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  g   (  x  )     :=   -    ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d   (   -  g   )    (  x  )       ,     assign    superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  g  x        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d    g   x       \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x):=-\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,d(-g)(x),     the latter integral being defined by the preceding construction.  If   g   g   g   is of bounded variation and   f   f   f   is bounded, then it is possible to write       d  g   (  x  )    =    d   g  1    (  x  )    -   d   g  2    (  x  )           d  g  x       d   subscript  g  1   x     d   subscript  g  2   x      dg(x)=dg_{1}(x)-dg_{2}(x)     where  V g }} is the total variation of   g   g   g   in the interval     a  a   ,  x       a  a   x    aa,x   , and  g 1 ( x ) − g ( x )}} . Both and are monotone non-decreasing. Now the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral with respect to   g   g   g   is defined by         ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  g   (  x  )     =     ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d   g  1    (  x  )     -    ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d   g  2    (  x  )       ,        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  g  x        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d   subscript  g  1   x      superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d   subscript  g  2   x       \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg_{1}(x)-\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg_{2}(x),     where the latter two integrals are well-defined by the preceding construction.  Daniell integral  An alternative approach  is to define the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral as the Daniell integral that extends the usual Riemann–Stieltjes integral. Let   g   g   g   be a non-increasing right-continuous function on     a  a   ,  b       a  a   b    aa,b   , and define    I   (  f  )       I  f    I(f)   to be the Riemann–Stieltjes integral       I   (  f  )    =    ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  g   (  x  )           I  f     superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  g  x      I(f)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dg(x)     for all continuous functions   f   f   f   . The functional    I   I   I   defines a Radon measure on     a  a   ,  b       a  a   b    aa,b   . This functional can then be extended to the class of all non-negative functions by setting       I  ¯    (  h  )        normal-¯  I   h    \displaystyle\overline{I}(h)     For Borel measurable functions, one has         I  ¯    (  h  )    =     I  ¯   ¯    (  h  )     ,         normal-¯  I   h      normal-¯   normal-¯  I    h     \overline{I}(h)=\overline{\overline{I}}(h),     and either side of the identity then defines the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of   h   h   h   . The outer measure is defined via        μ  g    (  A  )    =     I  ¯   ¯    (   χ  A   )           subscript  μ  g   A      normal-¯   normal-¯  I     subscript  χ  A      \mu_{g}(A)=\overline{\overline{I}}(\chi_{A})     where is the indicator function of   A   A   A   .  Integrators of bounded variation are handled as above by decomposing into positive and negative variations.  Example  Suppose that is a rectifiable curve in the plane and is Borel measurable. Then we may define the length of   γ   γ   γ   with respect to the Euclidean metric weighted by ρ to be        ∫  a  b    ρ   (   γ   (  t  )    )   d  ℓ   (  t  )     ,      superscript   subscript   a   b     ρ    γ  t   d  normal-ℓ  t     \int_{a}^{b}\rho(\gamma(t))\,d\ell(t),     where    ℓ   (  t  )       normal-ℓ  t    \ell(t)   is the length of the restriction of   γ   γ   γ   to     a  a   ,  t       a  a   t    aa,t   . This is sometimes called the   ρ   ρ   ρ   -length of   γ   γ   γ   . This notion is quite useful for various applications: for example, in muddy terrain the speed in which a person can move may depend on how deep the mud is. If    ρ   (  z  )       ρ  z    ρ(z)   denotes the inverse of the walking speed at or near   z   z   z   , then the   ρ   ρ   ρ   -length of   γ   γ   γ   is the time it would take to traverse   γ   γ   γ   . The concept of extremal length uses this notion of the   ρ   ρ   ρ   -length of curves and is useful in the study of conformal mappings .  Integration by parts  A function   f   f   f   is said to be "regular" at a point   a   a   a   if the right and left hand limits    f   (   a  +   )       f   limit-from  a      f(a+)   and    f   (   a  −   )       f    a  normal-−     f(a−)   exist, and the function takes the average value,        f   (  a  )    =     f   (   a  -   )    +   f   (   a  +   )     2    ,        f  a         f   limit-from  a       f   limit-from  a      2     f(a)=\frac{f(a-)+f(a+)}{2},     at the limiting point. Given two functions   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   of finite variation, if at each point either   U   U   U   or   V   V   V   is continuous, or if both   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   are regular, then there is an integration by parts formula for the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral:           ∫  a  b     U   d  V    +    ∫  a  b     V   d  U     =    U   (   b  +   )   V   (   b  +   )    -   U   (   a  -   )   V   (   a  -   )      ,   b  >  a    .     formulae-sequence        superscript   subscript   a   b     U  d  V      superscript   subscript   a   b     V  d  U         U   limit-from  b    V   limit-from  b       U   limit-from  a    V   limit-from  a         b  a     \int_{a}^{b}U\,dV+\int_{a}^{b}V\,dU=U(b+)V(b+)-U(a-)V(a-),\qquad b>a.     Under a slight generalization of this formula, the extra conditions on   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   can be dropped. 2  An alternative result, of significant importance in the theory of Stochastic calculus is the following. Given two functions   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   of finite variation, which are both right-continuous and have left-limits (they are cadlag functions) then        U   (  t  )   V   (  t  )    =    U   (  0  )   V   (  0  )    +    ∫   (  0  ,  t  ]     U   (   s  -   )   d  V   (  s  )     +    ∫   (  0  ,  t  ]     V   (   s  -   )   d  U   (  s  )     +    ∑   u  ∈   (  0  ,  t  ]      Δ   U  u   Δ   V  u       ,        U  t  V  t       U  0  V  0     subscript    0  t      U   limit-from  s    d  V  s      subscript    0  t      V   limit-from  s    d  U  s      subscript     u   0  t       normal-Δ   subscript  U  u   normal-Δ   subscript  V  u        U(t)V(t)=U(0)V(0)+\int_{(0,t]}U(s-)\,dV(s)+\int_{(0,t]}V(s-)\,dU(s)+\sum_{u\in%
 (0,t]}\Delta U_{u}\Delta V_{u},     where  U ( t ) − U ( t −)}} . This result can be seen as a precursor to Itō's lemma , and is of use in the general theory of Stochastic integration. The final term is    Δ  U   (  t  )   Δ  V   (  t  )   =  d  U  U  ,  V  ,  ,     fragments  Δ  U   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   Δ  V   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    d  U  U  normal-,  V  normal-,  normal-,    ΔU(t)ΔV(t)=dUU,V,,   which arises from the quadratic covariation of   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   . (The earlier result can then be seen as a result pertaining to the Stratonovich integral .)  Related concepts  Lebesgue integration  When     g   (  x  )    =  x        g  x   x    g(x)=x   for all real   x   x   x   , then is the Lebesgue measure , and the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of   f   f   f   with respect to   g   g   g   is equivalent to the Lebesgue integral of   f   f   f   .  Riemann–Stieltjes integration and probability theory  Where   f   f   f   is a continuous real-valued function of a real variable and   v   v   v   is a non-decreasing real function, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is equivalent to the Riemann–Stieltjes integral , in which case we often write       ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  v   (  x  )        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  v  x     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dv(x)   for the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral, letting the measure remain implicit. This is particularly common in probability theory when   v   v   v   is the cumulative distribution function of a real-valued random variable   X   X   X   , in which case         ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  x  )   d  v   (  x  )     =   E   [   f   (  X  )    ]     .        superscript   subscript            f  x  d  v  x      normal-E   delimited-[]    f  X       \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\,dv(x)=\mathrm{E}[f(X)].
