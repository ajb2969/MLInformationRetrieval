   Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase      Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase   Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (, ribonucleotide reductase , 2'-deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphate:oxidized-thioredoxin 2'-oxidoreductase ) is an enzyme with system name 2'-deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphate:thioredoxin-disulfide 2'-oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate + thioredoxin disulfide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ribonucleoside triphosphate + thioredoxin   Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase requires a cobamide coenzyme and ATP.
