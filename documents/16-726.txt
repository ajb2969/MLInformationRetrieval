   Conditional probability table      Conditional probability table   In statistics , the conditional probability table (CPT) is defined for a set of discrete (not independent) random variables to demonstrate marginal probability of a single variable with respect to the others. For example, assume there are three random variables     x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3     x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}   where each have   K   K   K   states. Then, the conditional probability table of    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   provides the marginal probability values for    P   (   x  1   ∣   x  2   ,   x  3   )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-∣   subscript  x  2   normal-,   subscript  x  3   normal-)     P(x_{1}\mid x_{2},x_{3})   . Clearly, this table has K 3 cells. In general, for   M   M   M   number of variables     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  M       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  M     x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{M}   with   K   K   K   states, the CPT has size K M . 1  CPT table can be put into a matrix form. For example, the values of    P   (   x  j   ∣   x  i   )   =   T   i  j       fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  j   normal-∣   subscript  x  i   normal-)     subscript  T    i  j      P(x_{j}\mid x_{i})=T_{ij}   create a matrix. This matrix is a stochastic matrix since sum of all its elements is equals to 1; i.e.     ∑  j    T   i  j        subscript   j    subscript  T    i  j      \sum_{j}T_{ij}   .
