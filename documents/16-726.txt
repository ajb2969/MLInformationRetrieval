Conditional probability table

In statistics, the conditional probability table (CPT) is defined for a set of discrete (not independent) random variables to demonstrate marginal probability of a single variable with respect to the others. For example, assume there are three random variables 
 
 
 
  where each have 
 
 
 
  states. Then, the conditional probability table of 
 
 
 
  provides the marginal probability values for 
 
 
 
 . Clearly, this table has K3 cells. In general, for 
 
 
 
  number of variables 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  states, the CPT has sizeÂ KM.1
CPT table can be put into a matrix form. For example, the values of 
 
 
 
  create a matrix. This matrix is a stochastic matrix since sum of all its elements is equals to 1; i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
