   Protein-disulfide reductase      Protein-disulfide reductase   In enzymology , a protein-disulfide reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protein dithiol + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protein disulfide + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are protein dithiol , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are protein disulfide , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is protein-dithiol:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include protein disulphide reductase , insulin-glutathione transhydrogenase , disulfide reductase , and NAD(P)H2:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
