It is composed entirely of omnitruncated 5-simplex facets.  The facets of all omnitruncated simplectic honeycombs are called permutahedra and can be positioned in n+1 space with integral coordinates, permutations of the whole numbers (0,1,..,n).  A 5 * lattice  The A     5     *     subscript   superscript  absent    5    {}^{*}_{5}   lattice (also called A     5     6     subscript   superscript  absent  6   5    {}^{6}_{5}   ) is the union of six A 5 lattices , and is the dual vertex arrangement to the omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb , and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 5-simplex .      ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of  Related polytopes and honeycombs  Projection by folding  The omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 3-dimensional omnitruncated cubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same 3-space vertex arrangement :           A  ~   5     subscript   normal-~  A   5    {\tilde{A}}_{5}                C  ~   3     subscript   normal-~  C   3    {\tilde{C}}_{3}         See also  Regular and uniform honeycombs in 5-space:   5-cube honeycomb  5-demicube honeycomb  5-simplex honeycomb   Notes  References   Norman Johnson  Uniform Polytopes , Manuscript (1991)  Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings of H.S.M.
