Bile-acid-CoA hydrolase




Bile-acid-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, a bile-acid-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

deoxycholoyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + deoxycholate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are deoxycholoyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and deoxycholate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deoxycholoyl-CoA hydrolase.
