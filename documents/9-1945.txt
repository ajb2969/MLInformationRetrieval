Spectral risk measure

A Spectral risk measure is a risk measure given as a weighted average of outcomes where bad outcomes are, typically, included with larger weights. A spectral risk measure is a function of portfolio returns and outputs the amount of the numeraire (typically a currency) to be kept in reserve. A spectral risk measure is always a coherent risk measure, but the converse does not always hold. An advantage of spectral measures is the way in which they can be related to risk aversion, and particularly to a utility function, through the weights given to the possible portfolio returns.1
Definition
Consider a portfolio

 
  Then a spectral risk measure 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is non-negative, non-increasing, right-continuous, integrable function defined on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is defined by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the cumulative distribution function for X.23
If there are 
 
 
 
  equiprobable outcomes with the corresponding payoffs given by the order statistics

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . The measure 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  is a spectral measure of risk if 
 
 
 
  satisfies the conditions

Nonnegativity
 
 
 
  for all

Normalization
 
 
 
 ,
Monotonicity 
 
 
 
  is non-increasing, that is 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and

Properties
Spectral risk measures are also coherent. Every spectral risk measure 
 
 
 
  satisfies:

Positive Homogeneity: for every portfolio X and positive value 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ;
Translation-Invariance: for every portfolio X and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ;
Monotonicity: for all portfolios X and Y such that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ;
Sub-additivity: for all portfolios X and Y, 
 
 
 
 ;
Law-Invariance: for all portfolios X and Y with cumulative distribution functions

 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively, if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 ;
Comonotonic Additivity: for every comonotonic random variables X and Y, 
 
 
 
 . Note that X and Y are comonotonic if for every 
 
 
 
 .5

Examples

The expected shortfall is a spectral measure of risk.
The expected value is trivially a spectral measure of risk.
