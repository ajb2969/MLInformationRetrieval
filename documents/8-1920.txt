   Qualitative economics      Qualitative economics   Qualitative economics refers to representation and analysis of information about the direction of change (+, -, or 0) in some economic variable(s) as related to change of some other economic variable(s). For the non-zero case, what makes the change qualitative is that its direction but not its magnitude is specified. 1  Typical exercises of qualitative economics include comparative-static changes studied in microeconomics or macroeconomics and comparative equilibrium-growth states in a macroeconomic growth model . A simple example illustrating qualitative change is from macroeconomics. Let:   GDP = nominal gross domestic product , a measure of national income   M = money supply   T = total taxes .   Monetary theory hypothesizes a positive relationship between GDP the dependent variable and M the independent variable . Equivalent ways to represent such a qualitative relationship between them are as a signed functional relationship and as a signed derivative :       +     +\,\!            G  D  P   =   f   (  M  )          G  D  P     f  M     GDP=f(M)\,\!       o  r      o  r    or\,\!         d  f   (  M  )     d  M    >  0.          d  f  M     d  M    0.    \frac{df(M)}{dM}>0.      where the '+' indexes a positive relationship of GDP to M , that is, as M increases, GDP increases, and vice versa.  Another model of GDP hypothesizes that GDP has a negative relationship to T . This can be represented similarly to the above, with a theoretically appropriate sign change as indicated:       -     -\,\!            G  D  P   =   f   (  T  )          G  D  P     f  T     GDP=f(T)\,\!       o  r      o  r    or\,\!         d  f   (  T  )     d  T    <  0.          d  f  T     d  T    0.    \frac{df(T)}{dT}<0.      That is, as T increases, GDP decreases, and vice versa. A combined model uses both M and T as independent variables. The hypothesized relationships can be equivalently represented as signed functional relationships and signed partial derivatives (suitable for more than one independent variable):       +     +\,\!      -     -\,\!            G  D  P   =   f   (  M  ,  T  )          G  D  P     f   M  T      GDP=f(M,T)\,\!       o  r      o  r    or\,\!           ∂  f    (  M  ,  T  )     ∂  M    >  0   ,            f    M  T      M    0    \frac{\partial f(M,T)}{\partial M}>0,          ∂  f    (  M  ,  T  )     ∂  T    <  0.            f    M  T      T    0.    \frac{\partial f(M,T)}{\partial T}<0.      Qualitative hypotheses occur in earliest history of formal economics but only as to formal economic models from the late 1930s with Hicks's model of general equilibrium in a competitive economy. 2 A classic exposition of qualitative economics is Samuelson, 1947. 3 There Samuelson identifies qualitative restrictions and the hypotheses of maximization and stability of equilibrium as the three fundamental sources of meaningful theorems — hypotheses about empirical data that could conceivably be refuted by empirical data. 4  Notes  References   J.
