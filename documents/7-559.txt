   Lomer–Cottrell junction      Lomer–Cottrell junction   In materials science , a Lomer–Cottrell junction is a particular configuration of dislocations .  When two perfect dislocations encounter along a slip plane, each perfect dislocation can split into two Shockley partial dislocations : a leading dislocation and a trailing dislocation. When the two leading Shockley partials combine, they form a separate dislocation with a burgers vector that is not in the slip plane. This is the Lomer–Cottrell dislocation. It is sessile and immobile in the slip plane, acting as a barrier against other dislocations in the plane. The trailing dislocations pile up behind the Lomer–Cottrell dislocation, and an ever greater force is required to push additional dislocations into the pile-up.  ex.
