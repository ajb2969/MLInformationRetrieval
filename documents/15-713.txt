   Koszul cohomology      Koszul cohomology   In mathematics , the Koszul cohomology groups K p , q ( X , L ) are groups associated to a projective variety  X with a line bundle  L . They were introduced by , and named after Jean-Louis Koszul as they are closely related to the Koszul complex .  surveys early work on Koszul cohomology,  gives an introduction to Koszul cohomology, and  gives a more advanced survey.  Definitions  If M is a graded module over the symmetric algebra of a vector space  V , then the Koszul cohomology K p , q ( M , V ) of M is given by the cohomology of the sequence        ∧   p  +  1     M   q  -  1     →    ∧  p    M  q    →    ∧   p  -  1     M   q  +  1          normal-→    superscript     p  1     subscript  M    q  1       superscript   p    subscript  M  q      normal-→      superscript     p  1     subscript  M    q  1        \wedge^{p+1}M_{q-1}\rightarrow\wedge^{p}M_{q}\rightarrow\wedge^{p-1}M_{q+1}   If L is a line bundle over a projective variety X , then the Koszul cohomology K p , q ( X , L ) is given by the Koszul cohomology K p , q ( M , V ) of the graded module M = ⊕ q H 0 ( L q ), as a module over the symmetric algebra of the vector space V = H 0 ( L ).
