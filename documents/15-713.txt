Koszul cohomology

In mathematics, the Koszul cohomology groups Kp,q(X, L) are groups associated to a projective variety X with a line bundle L. They were introduced by , and named after Jean-Louis Koszul as they are closely related to the Koszul complex.
surveys early work on Koszul cohomology,  gives an introduction to Koszul cohomology, and  gives a more advanced survey.
Definitions
If M is a graded module over the symmetric algebra of a vector space V, then the Koszul cohomology Kp,q(M,V) of M is given by the cohomology of the sequence


 
  If L is a line bundle over a projective variety X, then the Koszul cohomology Kp,q(X,L) is given by the Koszul cohomology Kp,q(M,V) of the graded module M = âŠ•qH0(Lq), as a module over the symmetric algebra of the vector space V=H0(L).
