It is the Voronoi diagram of the face-centered cubic sphere-packing, which is the densest possible packing of equal spheres in ordinary space (see Kepler conjecture ).  Geometry  It consists of copies of a single cell , the rhombic dodecahedron . All faces are rhombi , with diagonals in the ratio 1:√2. Three cells meet at each edge. The honeycomb is thus cell-transitive , face-transitive and edge-transitive ; but it is not vertex-transitive , as it has two kinds of vertex. The vertices with the obtuse rhombic face angles have 4 cells. The vertices with the acute rhombic face angles have 6 cells.  The rhombic dodecahedron can be twisted on one of its hexagonal cross-sections to form a trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron , which is the cell of a somewhat similar tessellation, the Voronoi diagram of hexagonal close-packing .
