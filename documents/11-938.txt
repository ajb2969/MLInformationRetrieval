Isocitrate O-dihydroxycinnamoyltransferase

In enzymology, an isocitrate O-dihydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

caffeoyl-CoA + isocitrate 
 
 
 
  CoA + 2-caffeoylisocitrate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are caffeoyl-CoA and isocitrate, whereas its two products are CoA and 2-caffeoylisocitrate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is caffeoyl-CoA:isocitrate 3-O-(3,4-dihydroxycinnamoyl)transferase.
