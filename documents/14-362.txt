   Appert topology      Appert topology   In general topology , a branch of mathematics, the Appert topology , named for , is an example of a topology on the set } of positive integers . 1 To give Z + a topology means to say which subsets of Z + are open in a manner that satisfies certain axioms: 2   The union of open sets is an open set.  The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.  Z + and the empty set ∅ are open sets.   In the Appert topology, the open sets are those that do not contain 1, and those that asymptotically contain almost every positive integer.  Construction  Let S be a subset of Z + , and let  denote the number of elements of S which are less than or equal to n :        N   (  n  ,  S  )    =   #   {   m  ∈  S   :   m  ≤  n   }     .        normal-N   n  S      normal-#   conditional-set    m  S     m  n       \mathrm{N}(n,S)=\#\{m\in S:m\leq n\}.   In Appert's topology, a set S is defined to be open if either it does not contain 1 or N( n , S )/ n tends towards 1 as n tends towards infinity: 3        lim   n  →  ∞      N   (  n  ,  S  )    n    =  1.        subscript    normal-→  n         N   n  S    n    1.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\text{N}(n,S)}{n}=1.   The empty set is an open set in this topology because ∅ is a set that does not contain 1, and the whole set Z + is also open in this topology since         N    (  n  ,   ℤ  +   )    =   n    ,        N   n   superscript  ℤ      n    \text{N}\!\left(n,{\mathbb{Z}}^{+}\right)=n\ ,   meaning that  for all n .  Related topologies  The Appert topology is closely related to the Fort space topology that arises from giving the set of integers greater than one the discrete topology , and then taking the point 1 as the point at infinity in a one point compactification of the space. 4 The Fort space is a refinement of the Appert topology.  Properties  The closed subsets of Z + , equipped with the Appert topology, are the subsets S that either contain 1 or for which        lim   n  →  ∞      N   (  n  ,  S  )    n    =  0.        subscript    normal-→  n         normal-N   n  S    n    0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\mathrm{N}(n,S)}{n}=0.   As a result, Z + is a completely normal space (and thus also Hausdorff ), for suppose that A and B are disjoint closed sets. If  did not contain 1, then A and B would also be open and thus completely separated. On the other hand, if A contains 1 then B is open and      lim   n  →  ∞      N   (  n  ,  B  )    /   n     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n         normal-N   n  B    n    0    \scriptstyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathrm{N}(n,B)/n\,=\,0   , so that Z + − B is an open neighborhood of A disjoint from B . 5  A subset of Z + is compact in the Appert topology if and only if it is finite. In particular, Z + is not locally compact , since there is no compact neighborhood of 1. Moreover, Z + is not countably compact . 6  Notes  References    .   .
