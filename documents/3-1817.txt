   Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem      Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics , the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem states that an everywhere-defined symmetric operator on a Hilbert space with inner product    ⟨  ⋅  |  ⋅  ⟩     inner-product  normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot|\cdot\rangle   is bounded . By definition, an operator A is symmetric if       ⟨   A  x   |  y  ⟩   =   ⟨  x  |   A  y   ⟩        inner-product    A  x   y    inner-product  x    A  y      \langle Ax|y\rangle=\langle x|Ay\rangle   for all x , y in the domain of A . Note that symmetric everywhere-defined operators are necessarily self-adjoint , so this theorem can also be stated as follows: an everywhere-defined self-adjoint operator is bounded. The theorem is named after Ernst David Hellinger and Otto Toeplitz .  This theorem can be viewed as an immediate corollary of the closed graph theorem , as self-adjoint operators are closed . Alternatively, it can be argued using the uniform boundedness principle . One relies on the symmetric assumption, therefore the inner product structure, in proving the theorem. Also crucial is the fact that the given operator A is defined everywhere (and, in turn, the completeness of Hilbert spaces).  The Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem reveals certain technical difficulties in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics . Observables in quantum mechanics correspond to self-adjoint operators on some Hilbert space, but some observables (like energy) are unbounded. By Hellinger–Toeplitz, such operators cannot be everywhere defined (but they may be defined on a dense subset ). Take for instance the quantum harmonic oscillator . Here the Hilbert space is L 2 ( R ), the space of square integrable functions on R , and the energy operator H is defined by (assuming the units are chosen such that ℏ = m = ω = 1)         [   H  f   ]    (  x  )    =    -    1  2     d  2    d   x  2     f   (  x  )     +    1  2    x  2   f   (  x  )      .         delimited-[]    H  f    x           1  2      superscript  normal-d  2     normal-d   superscript  x  2     f  x        1  2    superscript  x  2   f  x      [Hf](x)=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}f(x)+\frac{1}{2}x^{2%
 }f(x).   This operator is self-adjoint and unbounded (its eigenvalues are 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...), so it cannot be defined on the whole of L 2 ( R ).
