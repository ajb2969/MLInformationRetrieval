Salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

salicylaldehyde + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  salicylate + NADH + 2 H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are salicylaldehyde, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are salicylate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is salicylaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in naphthalene and anthracene degradation.
