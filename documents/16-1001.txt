   Eisenstein triple      Eisenstein triple   Similar to a Pythagorean triple , an Eisenstein triple is a set of integers which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle where one of the angles is 60 degrees.  Triangles with an angle of 60°  Triangles with an angle of 60° are a special case of the Law of Cosines : 1 2 3        c  2   =     a  2   -   a  b    +   b  2     .       superscript  c  2        superscript  a  2     a  b     superscript  b  2      c^{2}=a^{2}-ab+b^{2}.     When the lengths of the sides are integers, the values form a set known as an Eisenstein triple. 4  Examples of Eisenstein triples include: 5      Side a   Side b   Side c       3   8   7     5   8   7     5   21   19     7   40   37     Triangles with an angle of 120°  A similar special case of the Law of Cosines relates the sides of a triangle with an angle of 120 degrees:        c  2   =    a  2   +   a  b   +   b  2     .       superscript  c  2      superscript  a  2     a  b    superscript  b  2      c^{2}=a^{2}+ab+b^{2}.     Examples of such triangles include: 6      Side a   Side b   Side c       3   5   7     7   8   13     5   16   19     See also   Integer triangles with a 60° angle  Integer triangles with a 120° angle   References    External links   http://161.200.126.13/download/2301499_Senior_Project/Report/Year_2555/MATH19%20-%20Eisenstein%20Triples%20and%20Inner%20Products.pdf  https://www.callutheran.edu/schools/cas/programs/mathematics/people/documents/honorsfinalpresentation.pdf   "  Category:Arithmetic problems of plane geometry  Category:Triangle geometry  Category:Diophantine equations     Gilder, J., Integer-sided triangles with an angle of 60°," Mathematical Gazette 66, December 1982, 261 266 ↩  Burn, Bob, "Triangles with a 60° angle and sides of integer length," Mathematical Gazette 87, March 2003, 148–153. ↩  Read, Emrys, "On integer-sided triangles containing angles of 120° or 60°", Mathematical Gazette , 90, July 2006, 299–305. ↩  http://www2.edc.org/cme/showcase/slides.delaware.2006.pdf ↩  http://www.had2know.com/academics/integer-triangles-60-degree-angle.html ↩  http://www.had2know.com/academics/integer-triangles-120-degree-angle.html ↩
