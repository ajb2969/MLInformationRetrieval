   Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase      Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase   Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase (, HIF hydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name hypoxia-inducible factor-L-proline, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   hypoxia-inducible factor -L- proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hypoxia-inducible factor-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline + succinate + CO 2    Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase contains iron, and requires ascorbate.
