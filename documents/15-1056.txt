Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase

Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase (, HIF hydroxylase) is an enzyme with system name hypoxia-inducible factor-L-proline, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

hypoxia-inducible factor-L-proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  hypoxia-inducible factor-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline + succinate + CO2


Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase contains iron, and requires ascorbate.
