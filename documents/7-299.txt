   Credible interval      Credible interval   In Bayesian statistics , a credible interval (or Bayesian confidence interval ) is an interval in the domain of a posterior probability distribution or predictive distribution used for interval estimation . 1 The generalisation to multivariate problems is the credible region . Credible intervals are analogous to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics , 2 although they differ on a philosophical basis; 3 Bayesian intervals treat their bounds as fixed and the estimated parameter as a random variable, whereas frequentist confidence intervals treat their bounds as random variables and the parameter as a fixed value.  For example, in an experiment that determines the uncertainty distribution of parameter   t   t   t   , if the probability that   t   t   t   lies between 35 and 45 is 0.95, then    35  ≤  t  ≤  45        35  t       45     35\leq t\leq 45   is a 95% credible interval.  Choosing a credible interval  Credible intervals are not unique on a posterior distribution. Methods for defining a suitable credible interval include:   Choosing the narrowest interval, which for a unimodal distribution will involve choosing those values of highest probability density including the mode . This is sometimes called the highest posterior density interval .  Choosing the interval where the probability of being below the interval is as likely as being above it. This interval will include the median . This is sometimes called the equal-tailed interval .  Assuming that the mean exists, choosing the interval for which the mean is the central point.   It is possible to frame the choice of a credible interval within decision theory and, in that context, an optimal interval will always be a highest probability density set. 4  Contrasts with confidence interval  A frequentist 95% confidence interval means that with a large number of repeated samples, 95% of such calculated confidence intervals would include the true value of the parameter. The probability that the parameter is inside the given interval (say, 35–45) is either 0 or 1 (the non-random unknown parameter is either there or not). In frequentist terms, the parameter is fixed (cannot be considered to have a distribution of possible values) and the confidence interval is random (as it depends on the random sample). Antelman (1997, p. 375) summarizes a [95%] confidence interval as "... one interval generated by a procedure that will give correct intervals 95% of the time". 5  In general, Bayesian credible intervals do not coincide with frequentist confidence intervals for two reasons:   credible intervals incorporate problem-specific contextual information from the prior distribution whereas confidence intervals are based only on the data;  credible intervals and confidence intervals treat nuisance parameters in radically different ways.   For the case of a single parameter and data that can be summarised in a single sufficient statistic , it can be shown that the credible interval and the confidence interval will coincide if the unknown parameter is a location parameter (i.e. the forward probability function has the form    Pr   (  x  |  μ  )   =  f   (  x  -  μ  )      fragments  Pr   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-|  μ  normal-)    f   fragments  normal-(  x   μ  normal-)     \mathrm{Pr}(x|\mu)=f(x-\mu)   ), with a prior that is a uniform flat distribution; 6 and also if the unknown parameter is a scale parameter (i.e. the forward probability function has the form    Pr   (  x  |  s  )   =  f   (  x  /  s  )      fragments  Pr   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-|  s  normal-)    f   fragments  normal-(  x   s  normal-)     \mathrm{Pr}(x|s)=f(x/s)   ), with a Jeffreys' prior     Pr   (  s  |  I  )   ∝  1  /  s     fragments  Pr   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-|  I  normal-)   proportional-to  1   s    \mathrm{Pr}(s|I)\;\propto\;1/s    7 — the latter following because taking the logarithm of such a scale parameter turns it into a location parameter with a uniform distribution. But these are distinctly special (albeit important) cases; in general no such equivalence can be made.
