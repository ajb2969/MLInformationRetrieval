   Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space      Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space   In mathematical abstract harmonic analysis , Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space is a space of functions on a semisimple Lie group whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing, studied by . It is an analogue of the Schwartz space on a real vector space , and is used to define the space of tempered distributions on a semisimple Lie group.  Definition  The definition of the Schwartz space uses Harish-Chandra's Ξ function and his σ function. The σ function is defined by       σ   (  x  )    =   ∥  X  ∥         σ  x    norm  X     \sigma(x)=\|X\|   for x = k exp X with k in K and X in p for a Cartan decomposition  G = K exp p of the Lie group G , where || X || is a K -invariant Euclidean norm on p , usually chosen to be the Killing form . .  The Schwartz space on G consists roughly of the functions all of whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing compared to Ξ . More precisely, if G is connected then the Schwartz space consists of all smooth functions f on G such that         (   1  +  σ   )   r    |   D  f   |    Ξ         superscript    1  σ   r       D  f     normal-Ξ    \frac{(1+\sigma)^{r}|Df|}{\Xi}   is bounded, where D is a product of left-invariant and right-invariant differential operators on G .
