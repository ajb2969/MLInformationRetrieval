   General Leibniz rule      General Leibniz rule   In calculus , the general Leibniz rule , 1 named after Gottfried Leibniz , generalizes the product rule (which is also known as " Leibniz's rule "). It states that if f and g are n -times differentiable functions , then product fg is also n -times differentiable and its n th derivative is given by        (   f  g   )    (  n  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n     (     n      k     )    f   (  k  )     g   (   n  -  k   )           superscript    f  g   n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    superscript  f  k    superscript  g    n  k        (fg)^{(n)}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}f^{(k)}g^{(n-k)}     where     (      n      k      )   =    n  !     k  !     (   n  -  k   )   !          binomial  n  k       n       k       n  k        {n\choose k}={n!\over k!(n-k)!}   is the binomial coefficient .  This can be proved by using the product rule and mathematical induction .  More than two factors  The formula can be generalized to the product of m differentiable functions f 1 ,..., f m .         (    f  1    f  2   ⋯   f  m    )    (  n  )    =    ∑     k  1   +   k  2   +  ⋯  +   k  m    =  n      (     n        k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  m       )     ∏   1  ≤  t  ≤  m      f  t   (   k  t   )         ,       superscript     subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2   normal-⋯   subscript  f  m    n     subscript        subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-⋯   subscript  k  m    n       binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  m       subscript  product      1  t       m      superscript   subscript  f  t    subscript  k  t         \left(f_{1}f_{2}\cdots f_{m}\right)^{(n)}=\sum_{k_{1}+k_{2}+\cdots+k_{m}=n}{n%
 \choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{m}}\prod_{1\leq t\leq m}f_{t}^{(k_{t})}\,,   where the sum extends over all m -tuples ( k 1 ,..., k m ) of non-negative integers with      ∑   t  =  1   m    k  t    =  n        superscript   subscript     t  1    m    subscript  k  t    n    \sum_{t=1}^{m}k_{t}=n   and       (     n        k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  m       )   =    n  !      k  1   !     k  2   !   ⋯    k  m   !          binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  m         n        subscript  k  1       subscript  k  2    normal-⋯     subscript  k  m        {n\choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{m}}=\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\,k_{2}!\cdots k_{m}!}   are the multinomial coefficients . This is akin to the multinomial formula from algebra.  Multivariable calculus  With the multi-index notation for partial derivatives of functions of several variables, the Leibniz rule states more generally:         ∂  α    (   f  g   )    =    ∑   {   β   :   β  ≤  α   }      (     α      β     )    (    ∂  β   f   )    (    ∂   α  -  β    g   )      .        superscript   α     f  g      subscript    conditional-set  β    β  α        binomial  α  β     superscript   β   f     superscript     α  β    g       \partial^{\alpha}(fg)=\sum_{\{\beta\,:\,\beta\leq\alpha\}}{\alpha\choose\beta}%
 (\partial^{\beta}f)(\partial^{\alpha-\beta}g).     This formula can be used to derive a formula that computes the symbol of the composition of differential operators. In fact, let P and Q be differential operators (with coefficients that are differentiable sufficiently many times) and    R  =   P  ∘  Q       R    P  Q     R=P\circ Q   . Since R is also a differential operator, the symbol of R is given by:        R   (  x  ,  ξ  )    =    e   -   ⟨  x  ,  ξ  ⟩     R   (   e   ⟨  x  ,  ξ  ⟩    )     .        R   x  ξ       superscript  e     x  ξ     R   superscript  e   x  ξ       R(x,\xi)=e^{-{\langle x,\xi\rangle}}R(e^{\langle x,\xi\rangle}).     A direct computation now gives:        R   (  x  ,  ξ  )    =    ∑  α     1   α  !      (   ∂   ∂  ξ    )   α   P   (  x  ,  ξ  )     (   ∂   ∂  x    )   α   Q   (  x  ,  ξ  )      .        R   x  ξ      subscript   α       1    α     superscript       ξ    α   P   x  ξ    superscript       x    α   Q   x  ξ       R(x,\xi)=\sum_{\alpha}{1\over\alpha!}\left({\partial\over\partial\xi}\right)^{%
 \alpha}P(x,\xi)\left({\partial\over\partial x}\right)^{\alpha}Q(x,\xi).     This formula is usually known as the Leibniz formula. It is used to define the composition in the space of symbols, thereby inducing the ring structure.
