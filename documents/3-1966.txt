   Littlewood conjecture      Littlewood conjecture   In mathematics , the Littlewood conjecture is an open problem () in Diophantine approximation , proposed by John Edensor Littlewood around 1930. It states that for any two real numbers α and β,          lim inf   n  →  ∞       n    ∥   n  α   ∥    ∥   n  β   ∥     =  0   ,        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n       n   norm    n  α     norm    n  β      0    \liminf_{n\to\infty}\ n\,\|n\alpha\|\,\|n\beta\|=0,     where    ∥  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  parallel-to    \|\,\|   is here the distance to the nearest integer.  Formulation and explanation  This means the following: take a point (α,β) in the plane, and then consider the sequence of points   (2α,2β), (3α,3β), ... .   For each of these consider the closest lattice point , as determined by multiplying the distance to the closest line with integer x-coordinate by the distance to the closest line with integer y-coordinate. This product will certainly be at most 1/4. The conjecture makes no statement about whether this sequence of values will converge ; it typically does not, in fact. The conjecture states something about the limit inferior , and says that there is a subsequence for which the distances decay faster than the reciprocal, i.e.   o(1/ n )   in the little-o notation .  Connection to further conjectures  It is known that this would follow from a result in the geometry of numbers , about the minimum on a non-zero lattice point of a product of three linear forms in three real variables: the implication was shown in 1955 by J. W. S. Cassels and Swinnerton-Dyer . 1 This can be formulated another way, in group-theoretic terms. There is now another conjecture, expected to hold for n ≥ 3: it is stated in terms of G = SL n ( R ), Γ = SL n ( Z ), and the subgroup D of diagonal matrices in G .  Conjecture : for any g in G /Γ such that Dg is relatively compact (in G /Γ), then Dg is closed.  This in turn is a special case of a general conjecture of Margulis on Lie groups .  Partial results  Borel showed in 1909 that the exceptional set of real pairs (α,β) violating the statement of the conjecture is of Lebesgue measure zero. 2  Manfred Einsiedler , Anatole Katok and Elon Lindenstrauss have shown 3 that it must have Hausdorff dimension zero; 4 and in fact is a union of countably many compact sets of box-counting dimension zero. The result was proved by using measure classification theorem for diagonalizable actions of higher-rank groups, and an isolation theorem proved by Lindenstrauss and Barak Weiss.  These results imply that non-trivial pairs satisfying the conjecture exist: indeed, given a real number α such that      inf   n  ≥  1     n  ⋅   ||   n  α   ||     >  0        subscript  infimum    n  1     normal-⋅  n   norm    n  α      0    \inf_{n\geq 1}n\cdot||n\alpha||>0   , it is possible to construct an explicit β such that (α,β) satisfies the conjecture. 5  See also   Littlewood polynomial   References     Further reading     "  Category:Diophantine approximation  Category:Conjectures     ↩  Adamczewski & Bugeaud (2010) p.444 ↩  ↩  Adamczewski & Bugeaud (2010) p.445 ↩  Adamczewski & Bugeaud (2010) p.446 ↩
