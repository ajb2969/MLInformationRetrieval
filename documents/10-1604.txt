   4-hydroxyproline epimerase      4-hydroxyproline epimerase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxyproline epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline , and one product , cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyproline 2-epimerase . Other names in common use include hydroxyproline epimerase , hydroxyproline 2-epimerase , and L-hydroxyproline epimerase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 5.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
