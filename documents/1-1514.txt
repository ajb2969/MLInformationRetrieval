Euler number

In number theory, the Euler numbers are a sequence En of integers  defined by the following Taylor series expansion:



where cosh t is the hyperbolic cosine. The Euler numbers appear as a special value of the Euler polynomials.
The odd-indexed Euler numbers are all zero. The even-indexed ones  have alternating signs. Some values are:

E0 = 1
 
E2 = −1
 
E4 = 5
 
E6 = −61
 
E8 = 1,385
 
E10 = −50,521
 
E12 = 2,702,765
 
E14 = −199,360,981
 
E16 = 19,391,512,145
 
E18 = −2,404,879,675,441
 

Some authors re-index the sequence in order to omit the odd-numbered Euler numbers with value zero, and/or change all signs to positive. This encyclopedia adheres to the convention adopted above.
The Euler numbers appear in the Taylor series expansions of the secant and hyperbolic secant functions. The latter is the function in the definition. They also occur in combinatorics, specifically when counting the number of alternating permutations of a set with an even number of elements.
Explicit formulas
Iterated sum
An explicit formula for Euler numbers is:1



where i denotes the imaginary unit with i2=−1.
Sum over partitions
The Euler number E2n can be expressed as a sum over the even partitions of 2n,2



as well as a sum over the odd partitions of 2n − 1,3



where in both cases 
 
 
 
  and


 
  is a multinomial coefficient. The Kronecker delta's in the above formulas restrict the sums over the k's to 
 
 
 
  and to 
 
 
 
 , respectively.
As an example,



Determinant
E2n is also given by the determinant



Asymptotic approximation
The Euler numbers grow quite rapidly for large indices as they have the following lower bound

Generalized Euler numbers
Generalizations of Euler numbers include poly-Euler numbers, which play an important role in multiple zeta functions.
