   Revolving armature alternator      Revolving armature alternator   In electrical engineering , an alternator is a machine that produces alternating current electric power when its shaft is turned by a prime mover such as a steam turbine . Most large alternators have a stationary winding, the armature , which has voltage induced in it by a rotating magnetic field produced by a rotor . However, some early machines, and some small machines even now, have a reverse arrangement with the armature rotating, and the field as a stationary structure.  A 60 Hz, three-phase revolving armature alternator was built by General Electric Company in 1895. It was designed by Elihu Thomson . Four were installed in the powerhouse at what is now the Folsom Powerhouse State Historic Park . Transmission 22 miles to Sacramento began 13 July 1895 at 2010 hp. These 750 kilowatt machines remained in service until 1952, when the new Folsom dam was being built and removed water flow from the old powerhouse.   These Folsom machines predated the Niagara Falls to Buffalo transmission and were the same power. The Niagara alternators were only two phase machines at 25 Hz. The Niagara transmission used the Scott-T transformer to get the third phase.  Mechanical  Weight: 57,877 pounds  Height overall: 10feet Prime mover: John B.

Shaft Rotation Speed (Nominal): 300 RPM  Stator  Stator salient poles : 24 Dipoles: 12   Rotor  Slots: 216 The winding is a progressive counterclockwise flattened-spiral wave, full pitch. Each of the six sub-phase wires circle the rotor three times.  There is a common ring whose diameter is approximately 5 feet. All six sub-phase low voltage sides (Cold) connect to this common ring near the rotor perimeter. There is a wire connected at the common ring, routed to the back and connected to a single slip-ring. The single rear slip-ring output is routed to the back wall where it goes through a high impedance ground (a transformer primary and resistor on the secondary) to earth.  There are six bus bars that connect the armature perimeter inductors to the slip ring assembly.  The three bus bar pairs are not spaced equally (radial rotational symmetry) around the rotor perimeter.
