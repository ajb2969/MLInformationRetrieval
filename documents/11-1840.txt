Comparative methods
The single sequence methods mentioned above have a difficult job detecting a small sample of reasonable secondary structures from a large space of possible structures. A good way to reduce the size of the space is to use evolutionary approaches. Structures that have been conserved by evolution are far more likely to be the functional form. The methods below use this approach.

Cupid

Cupid is a method for simultaneous prediction of miRNA-target interactions and their mediated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions. It is an integrative approach significantly improves on miRNA-target prediction accuracy as assessed by both mRNA and protein level measurements in breast cancer cell lines. Cupid is implemented in 3 steps: Step 1: re-evaluate candidate miRNA binding sites in 3’ UTRs. Step2: interactions are predicted by integrating information about selected sites and the statistical dependency between the expression profiles of miRNA and putative targets. Step 3: Cupid assesses whether inferred targets compete for predicted miRNA regulators.

TargetScan

Predicts biological targets of miRNAs by searching for the presence of sites that match the seed region of each miRNA. In flies and nematodes, predictions are ranked based on the probability of their evolutionary conservation. In zebrafish, predictions are ranked based on site number, site type, and site context, which includes factors that influence target-site accessibility. In mammals, the user can choose whether the predictions should be ranked based on the probability of their conservation or on site number, type, and context. In mammals and nematodes, the user can chose to extend the predictions beyond conserved sites and consider all sites.

miReader

miReader is a first of its type to detect mature miRNAs without any dependence upon genomic or reference sequences. So far, discovering miRNAs was possible only with species for which genomic or reference sequences would be available as most of the miRNA discovery tools relied on drawing pre-miRNA candidates. Due to this, miRNA biology became limited to model organisms, mostly. With miReader, one can now directly find out mature miRNAs from small RNA sequencing data, without any need of genomic/reference sequences. It has been developed for large number of Phyla and species, ranging from Vertebrate models to plant and fish models. Its accuracy has been found to be consistently >90% for large number of validatory testing.

Single state design





EteRNA/EteRNABot

An RNA folding game that challenges players to come up with sequences that fold into a target RNA structure. The best sequences for a given puzzle are synthesized and their structures are probed through chemical mapping. The sequences are then scored by the data's agreement to the target structure and feedback is provided to the players. EteRNABot is a software implementation based on design rules submitted by EteRNA players.

RNAinverse

The ViennaRNA package provides RNAinverse, an algorithm for designing sequences with desired structure.

RNAiFold

A complete RNA inverse folding approach based on constraint programming and implemented using  OR Tools which allows for the specification of a wide range of design constraints. The RNAiFold software provides two algorithms to solve the inverse folding problem: i) RNA-CPdesign explores the complete search space and ii) RNA-LNSdesign based on the large neighborhood search metaheuristic is suitable to design large structures. The software is also able to design interacting RNA molecules using RNAcofold of the ViennaRNA Package. A fully functional, earlier implementation using COMET is available.

RNA-SSD/RNA Designer

The RNA-SSD (RNA Secondary Structure Designer) approach first assigns bases probabilistically to each position based probabilistic models. Subsequently a stochastic local search is used to optimize this sequence. RNA-SSD is publically available under the name of RNA Designer at the RNASoft web page

INFO-RNA

INFO-RNA uses a dynamic programming approach to generate an energy optimized starting sequence that is subsequently further improved by a stochastic local search that uses an effective neighbor selection method.

RNAexinv

RNAexinv is an extension of RNAinverse to generate sequences that not only fold into a desired structure, but they should also exhibit selected attributes such as thermodynamic stability and mutational robustness. This approach does not necessarily outputs a sequence that perfectly fits the input structure, but a shape abstraction, i.e. it keeps the adjacency and nesting of structural elements, but disregards helix lengths and the exact number unpaired positions, of it.

RNA-ensign

This approach applies an efficient global sampling algorithm to examine the mutational landscape under structural and thermodynamical constraints. The authors show that the global sampling approach is more robust, succeeds more often and generates more thermodynamically stable sequences than local approaches do.

IncaRNAtion

DSS-Opt

The Dynamics in Sequence Space Optimization (DSS-Opt) approach uses Newtonian dynamics in the sequence space in combination with a negative design term and simulated annealing to optimize a sequence such that it folds into the desired secondary structure.

Source Code

203



MODENA

This approach interprets RNA inverse folding as a multi-objective optimization problem and solves it using a genetic algorithm. In its extended version MODENA is able to design pseudoknotted RNA structures with the aid of IPknot.

ERD

Evolutionary RNA Design (ERD) can be used to design RNA sequences that fold into a given target structure. Any RNA secondary structure contains different structural components, each having a different length. Therefore, in the first step, the RNA sub-sequences (pools) corresponding to different components with different lengths are reconstructed. Using these pools, ERD reconstructs an initial RNA sequence which is compatible with the given target structure. Then ERD uses an evolutionary algorithm to improve the quality of the sub-sequences corresponding to the components. The major contributions of ERD are utilizing the natural RNA sequences, a different method for evaluating the sequences in each population, and a different hierarchical decomposition of the target structure into smaller sub-structures.

switch.pl

The ViennaRNA package provides a Perl script to design RNA sequences that are able to adopt two states. For instance RNA thermometer, which change their structural state depending on the environmental temperature, have been successfully designed using this program.

RiboMaker

RiboMaker is intended to design small RNAs (sRNA) and their target mRNA's 5'UTR. The sRNA is designed to activate or repress protein expression of the mRNA. It is also possible to design just one of the two RNA components provided the other sequence is fixed.
