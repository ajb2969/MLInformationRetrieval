   Subdivided interval categories      Subdivided interval categories   In category theory ( mathematics ) there exists an important collection of categories denoted    [  n  ]     delimited-[]  n    [n]   for natural numbers    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   . The objects of    [  n  ]     delimited-[]  n    [n]   are the integers    0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  n     0  1  2  normal-…  n    0,1,2,\ldots,n   , and the morphism set    H  o  m   (  i  ,  j  )       H  o  m   i  j     Hom(i,j)   for objects     i  ,  j   ∈   [  n  ]        i  j    delimited-[]  n     i,j\in[n]   is empty if   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   .  Subdivided interval categories are very useful in defining simplicial sets . The category whose objects are the subdivided interval categories and whose morphisms are functors is often written    X  :    Δ   o  p    →   S  e  t  s       normal-:  X   normal-→   superscript  normal-Δ    o  p      S  e  t  s      X:\Delta^{op}\rightarrow Sets   and is called the simplicial indexing category . A simplicial set is just a contravariant functor   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   .  Examples  The category � is an empty interval, that is, an empty category, having any objects or morphisms. It is an initial object in the category of all categories.  The category [0], also denoted as �, is a one-object, one-morphism category. It is the terminal object in the category of all categories.  The category [1], also denoted as � has two objects and a single (non-identity) morphism between them. If    𝒞   [  1  ]      superscript  𝒞   delimited-[]  1     \mathcal{C}^{[1]}   is any category, then    𝒞  .    𝒞   \mathcal{C}.   is the category of morphisms and commutative squares in $\mathcal{C}.$  The category [2], also denoted as � has three objects and three non-identity morphisms.
