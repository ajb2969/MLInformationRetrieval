Subdivided interval categories

In category theory (mathematics) there exists an important collection of categories denoted 
 
 
 
  for natural numbers 
 
 
 
 . The objects of 
 
 
 
  are the integers 
 
 
 
 , and the morphism set 
 
 
 
  for objects 
 
 
 
  is empty if 
 
 
 
 .
Subdivided interval categories are very useful in defining simplicial sets. The category whose objects are the subdivided interval categories and whose morphisms are functors is often written 
 
 
 
  and is called the simplicial indexing category. A simplicial set is just a contravariant functor 
 
 
 
 .
Examples
The category � is an empty interval, that is, an empty category, having any objects or morphisms. It is an initial object in the category of all categories.
The category [0], also denoted as �, is a one-object, one-morphism category. It is the terminal object in the category of all categories.
The category [1], also denoted as � has two objects and a single (non-identity) morphism between them. If 
 
 
 
  is any category, then 
 
 
 
  is the category of morphisms and commutative squares in $\mathcal{C}.$
The category [2], also denoted as � has three objects and three non-identity morphisms.
