   Maxwell material      Maxwell material   A Maxwell material is a viscoelastic material having the properties both of elasticity and viscosity . 1 It is named for James Clerk Maxwell who proposed the model in 1867. It is also known as a Maxwell fluid.  Definition  The Maxwell model can be represented by a purely viscous damper and a purely elastic spring connected in series, 2 as shown in the diagram. In this configuration, under an applied axial stress, the total stress,    σ  Total     subscript  σ  Total    \sigma_{\mathrm{Total}}   and the total strain,    ε  Total     subscript  ε  Total    \varepsilon_{\mathrm{Total}}   can be defined as follows: 3       σ  Total   =   σ  D   =   σ  S          subscript  σ  Total    subscript  σ  D         subscript  σ  S      \sigma_{\mathrm{Total}}=\sigma_{D}=\sigma_{S}          ε  Total   =    ε  D   +   ε  S         subscript  ε  Total      subscript  ε  D    subscript  ε  S      \varepsilon_{\mathrm{Total}}=\varepsilon_{D}+\varepsilon_{S}     where the subscript D indicates the stress/strain in the damper and the subscript S indicates the stress/strain in the spring. Taking the derivative of strain with respect to time, we obtain:        d   ε  Total     d  t    =     d   ε  D     d  t    +    d   ε  S     d  t     =    σ  η   +    1  E     d  σ    d  t                d   subscript  ε  Total      d  t          d   subscript  ε  D      d  t        d   subscript  ε  S      d  t              σ  η       1  E       d  σ     d  t         \frac{d\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Total}}}{dt}=\frac{d\varepsilon_{D}}{dt}+\frac{d%
 \varepsilon_{S}}{dt}=\frac{\sigma}{\eta}+\frac{1}{E}\frac{d\sigma}{dt}     where E is the elastic modulus and η is the material coefficient of viscosity. This model describes the damper as a Newtonian fluid and models the spring with Hooke's law .  (Figure)  Maxwell diagram.svg   If we connect these two elements in parallel, 4 we get a generalized model of Kelvin–Voigt material .  In a Maxwell material, stress σ, strain ε and their rates of change with respect to time t are governed by equations of the form: 5         1  E     d  σ    d  t     +   σ  η    =    d  ε    d  t              1  E       d  σ     d  t       σ  η        d  ε     d  t      \frac{1}{E}\frac{d\sigma}{dt}+\frac{\sigma}{\eta}=\frac{d\varepsilon}{dt}     or, in dot notation:         σ  ˙   E   +   σ  η    =   ε  ˙            normal-˙  σ   E     σ  η     normal-˙  ε     \frac{\dot{\sigma}}{E}+\frac{\sigma}{\eta}=\dot{\varepsilon}     The equation can be applied either to the shear stress or to the uniform tension in a material. In the former case, the viscosity corresponds to that for a Newtonian fluid . In the latter case, it has a slightly different meaning relating stress and rate of strain.  The model is usually applied to the case of small deformations. For the large deformations we should include some geometrical non-linearity. For the simplest way of generalizing the Maxwell model, refer to the upper-convected Maxwell model .  Effect of a sudden deformation  If a Maxwell material is suddenly deformed and held to a strain of    ε  0     subscript  ε  0    \varepsilon_{0}   , then the stress decays with a characteristic time of    η  E      η  E    \frac{\eta}{E}   .  The picture shows dependence of dimensionless stress     σ   (  t  )     E   ε  0          σ  t     E   subscript  ε  0      \frac{\sigma(t)}{E\varepsilon_{0}}   upon dimensionless time     E  η   t        E  η   t    \frac{E}{\eta}t   :  If we free the material at time    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   , then the elastic element will spring back by the value of        ε  back   =   -    σ   (   t  1   )    E    =    ε  0    exp   (   -    E  η    t  1     )      .         subscript  ε  back         σ   subscript  t  1    E            subscript  ε  0           E  η    subscript  t  1          \varepsilon_{\mathrm{back}}=-\frac{\sigma(t_{1})}{E}=\varepsilon_{0}\exp\left(%
 -\frac{E}{\eta}t_{1}\right).     Since the viscous element would not return to its original length, the irreversible component of deformation can be simplified to the expression below:        ε  irreversible   =    ε  0    (   1  -   exp   (   -    E  η    t  1     )     )     .       subscript  ε  irreversible      subscript  ε  0     1          E  η    subscript  t  1          \varepsilon_{\mathrm{irreversible}}=\varepsilon_{0}\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{E}%
 {\eta}t_{1}\right)\right).     Effect of a sudden stress  If a Maxwell material is suddenly subjected to a stress    σ  0     subscript  σ  0    \sigma_{0}   , then the elastic element would suddenly deform and the viscous element would deform with a constant rate:       ε   (  t  )    =     σ  0   E   +   t    σ  0   η           ε  t        subscript  σ  0   E     t     subscript  σ  0   η       \varepsilon(t)=\frac{\sigma_{0}}{E}+t\frac{\sigma_{0}}{\eta}     If at some time    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   we would release the material, then the deformation of the elastic element would be the spring-back deformation and the deformation of the viscous element would not change:        ε  reversible   =    σ  0   E    ,       subscript  ε  reversible      subscript  σ  0   E     \varepsilon_{\mathrm{reversible}}=\frac{\sigma_{0}}{E},           ε  irreversible   =    t  1     σ  0   η     .       subscript  ε  irreversible      subscript  t  1      subscript  σ  0   η      \varepsilon_{\mathrm{irreversible}}=t_{1}\frac{\sigma_{0}}{\eta}.     The Maxwell Model does not exhibit creep since it models strain as linear function of time.  If a small stress is applied for a sufficiently long time, then the irreversible strains become large. Thus, Maxwell material is a type of liquid .  Dynamic modulus  The complex dynamic modulus of a Maxwell material would be:        E  *    (  ω  )    =   1    1  /  E   -   i  /   (   ω  η   )      =     E   η  2    ω  2    +   i  ω   E  2   η       η  2    ω  2    +   E  2              superscript  E    ω     1      1  E     i    ω  η                 E   superscript  η  2    superscript  ω  2      i  ω   superscript  E  2   η         superscript  η  2    superscript  ω  2     superscript  E  2        E^{*}(\omega)=\frac{1}{1/E-i/(\omega\eta)}=\frac{E\eta^{2}\omega^{2}+i\omega E%
 ^{2}\eta}{\eta^{2}\omega^{2}+E^{2}}     Thus, the components of the dynamic modulus are :        E  1    (  ω  )    =    E   η  2    ω  2       η  2    ω  2    +   E  2     =       (   η  /  E   )   2    ω  2        (   η  /  E   )   2    ω  2    +  1    E   =      τ  2    ω  2       τ  2    ω  2    +  1    E            subscript  E  1   ω       E   superscript  η  2    superscript  ω  2         superscript  η  2    superscript  ω  2     superscript  E  2                 superscript    η  E   2    superscript  ω  2         superscript    η  E   2    superscript  ω  2    1    E               superscript  τ  2    superscript  ω  2         superscript  τ  2    superscript  ω  2    1    E      E_{1}(\omega)=\frac{E\eta^{2}\omega^{2}}{\eta^{2}\omega^{2}+E^{2}}=\frac{(\eta%
 /E)^{2}\omega^{2}}{(\eta/E)^{2}\omega^{2}+1}E=\frac{\tau^{2}\omega^{2}}{\tau^{%
 2}\omega^{2}+1}E     and        E  2    (  ω  )    =    ω   E  2   η      η  2    ω  2    +   E  2     =      (   η  /  E   )   ω       (   η  /  E   )   2    ω  2    +  1    E   =     τ  ω      τ  2    ω  2    +  1    E            subscript  E  2   ω       ω   superscript  E  2   η        superscript  η  2    superscript  ω  2     superscript  E  2                  η  E   ω        superscript    η  E   2    superscript  ω  2    1    E              τ  ω        superscript  τ  2    superscript  ω  2    1    E      E_{2}(\omega)=\frac{\omega E^{2}\eta}{\eta^{2}\omega^{2}+E^{2}}=\frac{(\eta/E)%
 \omega}{(\eta/E)^{2}\omega^{2}+1}E=\frac{\tau\omega}{\tau^{2}\omega^{2}+1}E     The picture shows relaxational spectrum for Maxwell material.
