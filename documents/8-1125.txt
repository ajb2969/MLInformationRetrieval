   Kepler–Bouwkamp constant      Kepler–Bouwkamp constant   (Figure)  A sequence of inscribed polygons and circles.   In plane geometry , the Kepler –Bouwkamp constant (or Polygon inscribing constant ) is obtained as a limit of the following sequence. Take a circle of radius 1. Inscribe a regular triangle in this circle. Inscribe a circle in this triangle. Inscribe a square in it. Inscribe a circle, regular pentagon , circle, regular hexagon and so forth. The radius of the limiting circle is called the Kepler–Bouwkamp constant (Finch, 2003), it is the inverse of the polygon circumscribing constant .  Numerical value of the Kepler–Bouwkamp constant  The decimal expansion of the Kepler–Bouwkamp constant is         ∏   k  =  3   ∞    cos   (   π  k   )     =   0.1149420448  …    .        superscript   subscript  product    k  3          π  k       0.1149420448  normal-…     \prod_{k=3}^{\infty}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{k}\right)=0.1149420448\dots.     If the product is taken over the odd primes, the constant        ∏   k  =   3  ,  5  ,  7  ,  11  ,  13  ,  17  ,  …      cos   (   π  k   )     =   0.312832  …         subscript  product    k   3  5  7  11  13  17  normal-…         π  k       0.312832  normal-…     \prod_{k=3,5,7,11,13,17,\ldots}\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{k}\right)=0.312832\ldots   is obtained .
