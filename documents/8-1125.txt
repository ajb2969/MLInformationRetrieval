A sequence of inscribed polygons and circles.

In plane geometry, the Kepler–Bouwkamp constant (or Polygon inscribing constant) is obtained as a limit of the following sequence. Take a circle of radius 1. Inscribe a regular triangle in this circle. Inscribe a circle in this triangle. Inscribe a square in it. Inscribe a circle, regular pentagon, circle, regular hexagon and so forth. The radius of the limiting circle is called the Kepler–Bouwkamp constant (Finch, 2003), it is the inverse of the polygon circumscribing constant.
