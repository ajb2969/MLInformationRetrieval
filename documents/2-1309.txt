   Abel's theorem      Abel's theorem   In mathematics , Abel's theorem for power series relates a limit of a power series to the sum of its coefficients . It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel .  Theorem  Let a = { a k : k ≥ 0} be any sequence of real or complex numbers and let        G  a    (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k     z  k             subscript  G  a   z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       G_{a}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}\!     be the power series with coefficients a . Suppose that the series     ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k        superscript   subscript     k  0       subscript  a  k     \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\!   converges. Then        lim   z  →   1  -       G  a    (  z  )     =     ∑   k  =  0   ∞    a  k    ,   (  *  )          subscript    normal-→  z   superscript  1         subscript  G  a   z       superscript   subscript     k  0       subscript  a  k        \lim_{z\rightarrow 1^{-}}G_{a}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k},\qquad(*)\!     where the variable z is supposed to be real, or, more generally, to lie within any Stolz angle , that is, a region of the open unit disk where       |   1  -  z   |   ≤   M   (   1  -   |  z  |    )            1  z      M    1    z       |1-z|\leq M(1-|z|)\,     for some M . Without this restriction, the limit may fail to exist: for example, the power series       ∑   n  >  0      (    z   3  n    -   z   2  ×   3  n      )   /  n       subscript     n  0         superscript  z   superscript  3  n     superscript  z    2   superscript  3  n      n     \sum_{n>0}(z^{3^{n}}-z^{2\times 3^{n}})/n   converges to 0 at z =1, but is unbounded near any point of the form e πi/3 n , so the value at z =1 is not the limit as z tends to 1 in the whole open disk.  Note that     G  a    (  z  )        subscript  G  a   z    G_{a}(z)   is continuous on the real closed interval [0, t ] for t G_a(z) is continuous on [0, 1].  Remarks  As an immediate consequence of this theorem, if z is any nonzero complex number for which the series     ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k     z  k         superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}\!   converges, then it follows that        lim   t  →   1  -       G  a    (   t  z   )     =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k     z  k            subscript    normal-→  t   superscript  1         subscript  G  a     t  z       superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       \lim_{t\to 1^{-}}G_{a}(tz)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}\!     in which the limit is taken from below .  The theorem can also be generalized to account for infinite sums. If        ∑   k  =  0   ∞    a  k    =   ∞         superscript   subscript     k  0       subscript  a  k       \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}=\infty\!     then the limit from below     lim   z  →   1  -       G  a    (  z  )        subscript    normal-→  z   superscript  1         subscript  G  a   z     \lim_{z\to 1^{-}}G_{a}(z)   will tend to infinity as well. However, if the series is only known to be divergent, the theorem fails; take for example, the power series for    1   1  +  z       1    1  z     \frac{1}{1+z}   . The series is equal to       1  -  1   +  1   -  1   +  ⋯            1  1   1   1   normal-⋯    1-1+1-1+\cdots   at    z  =  1      z  1    z=1   , but     1  /   (   1  +  1   )    =   1  /  2         1    1  1      1  2     1/(1+1)=1/2   .  Applications  The utility of Abel's theorem is that it allows us to find the limit of a power series as its argument (i.e.   z   z   z   ) approaches 1 from below, even in cases where the radius of convergence ,   R   R   R   , of the power series is equal to 1 and we cannot be sure whether the limit should be finite or not. See e.g. the binomial series . Abel's theorem allows us to evaluate many series in closed form. For example, when     a  k   =     (   -  1   )   k   /   (   k  +  1   )         subscript  a  k      superscript    1   k     k  1      a_{k}=(-1)^{k}/(k+1)   , we obtain      G  a    (  z  )    =    ln   (   1  +  z   )    /  z          subscript  G  a   z         1  z    z     G_{a}(z)=\ln(1+z)/z   for    0  <  z  <  1        0  z       1     0   , by integrating the uniformly convergent geometric power series term by term on    [   -  z   ,  0  ]       z   0    [-z,0]   ; thus the series     ∑   k  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   k   /   (   k  +  1   )        superscript   subscript     k  0         superscript    1   k     k  1      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}/(k+1)\!   converges to    ln   (  2  )       2    \ln(2)   by Abel's theorem. Similarly,     ∑   k  =  0   ∞      (   -  1   )   k   /   (    2  k   +  1   )        superscript   subscript     k  0         superscript    1   k       2  k   1      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}/(2k+1)\!   converges to     arctan   (  1  )    =   π  /  4         1     π  4     \arctan(1)=\pi/4   .       G  a    (  z  )        subscript  G  a   z    G_{a}(z)   is called the generating function of the sequence   a   a   a   . Abel's theorem is frequently useful in dealing with generating functions of real-valued and non-negative sequences , such as probability-generating functions . In particular, it is useful in the theory of Galton–Watson processes .  Outline of proof  After subtracting a constant from     a  0      subscript  a  0    a_{0}\!   , we may assume that      ∑   k  =  0   ∞    a  k    =   0         superscript   subscript     k  0       subscript  a  k    0    \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}=0\!   . Let     s  n   =    ∑   k  =  0   n     a  k          subscript  s  n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  a  k      s_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}\!   . Then substituting     a  k   =    s  k   -    s   k  -  1           subscript  a  k      subscript  s  k    subscript  s    k  1       a_{k}=s_{k}-s_{k-1}\!   and performing a simple manipulation of the series results in         G  a    (  z  )    =    (   1  -  z   )     ∑   k  =  0   ∞     s  k    z  k       .         subscript  G  a   z       1  z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  s  k    superscript  z  k        G_{a}(z)=(1-z)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}s_{k}z^{k}.\!     Given    ϵ  >   0       ϵ  0    \epsilon>0\!   , pick n large enough so that     |   s  k   |   <   ϵ          subscript  s  k    ϵ    |s_{k}|<\epsilon\!   for all    k  ≥   n       k  n    k\geq n\!   and note that       |    (   1  -  z   )     ∑   k  =  n   ∞     s  k    z  k      |   ≤   ϵ   |   1  -  z   |     ∑   k  =  n   ∞     |  z  |   k     =   ϵ   |   1  -  z   |      |  z  |   n    1  -   |  z  |      <   ϵ   M                1  z     superscript   subscript     k  n         subscript  s  k    superscript  z  k         ϵ      1  z      superscript   subscript     k  n       superscript    z   k            ϵ      1  z       superscript    z   n     1    z             ϵ  M      \left|(1-z)\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}s_{k}z^{k}\right|\leq\epsilon|1-z|\sum_{k=n}^{%

Whenever z is sufficiently close to 1 we have        |    (   1  -  z   )     ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1      s  k    z  k      |   <  ϵ   ,            1  z     superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       subscript  s  k    superscript  z  k       ϵ    \left|(1-z)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}s_{k}z^{k}\right|<\epsilon,     so that     |    G  a    (  z  )    |   <    (   M  +  1   )    ϵ             subscript  G  a   z        M  1   ϵ     |G_{a}(z)|<(M+1)\epsilon\!   when z is both sufficiently close to 1 and within the Stolz angle.  Related concepts  Converses to a theorem like Abel's are called Tauberian theorems : There is no exact converse, but results conditional on some hypothesis. The field of divergent series , and their summation methods, contains many theorems of abelian type and of tauberian type .
