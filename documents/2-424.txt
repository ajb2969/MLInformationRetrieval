   Linear function      Linear function     In mathematics , the term linear function refers to two distinct, although related, notions: 1   In calculus and related areas, a linear function is a polynomial function of degree zero or one, or is the zero polynomial. 2  In linear algebra and functional analysis , a linear function is a linear map . 3   As a polynomial function  In calculus, analytic geometry and related areas, a linear function is a polynomial of degree one or less, including the zero polynomial (the latter not being considered to have degree zero).  When the function is of only one variable , it is of the form        f   (  x  )    =    a  x   +  b    ,        f  x       a  x   b     f(x)=ax+b,   where   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are constants , often real numbers . The graph of such a function of one variable is a nonvertical line.   a   a   a   is frequently referred to as the slope of the line, and   b   b   b   as the intercept.  For a function    f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )       f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k      f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})   of any finite number of independent variables , the general formula is       f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )    =   b  +    a  1    x  1    +  …  +    a  k    x  k           f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k       b     subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1    normal-…     subscript  a  k    subscript  x  k       f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})=b+a_{1}x_{1}+\ldots+a_{k}x_{k}   , and the graph is a hyperplane of dimension .  A constant function is also considered linear in this context, as it is a polynomial of degree zero or is the zero polynomial. Its graph, when there is only one independent variable, is a horizontal line.  In this context, the other meaning (a linear map) may be referred to as a homogeneous linear function or a linear form . In the context of linear algebra, this meaning (polynomial functions of degree 0 or 1) is a special kind of affine map .  As a linear map  In linear algebra, a linear function is a map f between two vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication :       f   (   𝐱  +  𝐲   )    =    f   (  𝐱  )    +   f   (  𝐲  )           f    𝐱  𝐲        f  𝐱     f  𝐲      f(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})=f(\mathbf{x})+f(\mathbf{y})           f   (   a  𝐱   )    =   a  f   (  𝐱  )     .        f    a  𝐱      a  f  𝐱     f(a\mathbf{x})=af(\mathbf{x}).   Here   a   a   a   denotes a constant belonging to some field    K   K   K   of scalars (for example, the real numbers ) and   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   and   𝐲   𝐲   \mathbf{y}   are elements of a vector space , which might be   K   K   K   itself.  Some authors use "linear function" only for linear maps that take values in the scalar field; 4 these are also called linear functionals .  The "linear functions" of calculus qualify as "linear maps" when (and only when)    f   (  0   [  ,  …  ,  0  ]   )   =  0     fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  0   fragments  normal-[  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  0  normal-]   normal-)    0    f(0[,\ldots,0])=0   , or, equivalently, when the constant    b  =  0      b  0    b=0   . Geometrically, the graph of the function must pass through the origin.
