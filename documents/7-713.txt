   Continuously compounded nominal and real returns      Continuously compounded nominal and real returns   ==Nominal return== Let P t be the price of a security at time t , including any cash dividends or interest , and let P t − 1 be its price at t − 1. Let RS t be the simple rate of return on the security from t − 1 to t . Then        1  +   R   S  t     =    P  t    P   t  -  1      .        1    R   subscript  S  t        subscript  P  t    subscript  P    t  1       1+RS_{t}=\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}.     The continuously compounded rate of return or instantaneous rate of return  RC t obtained during that period is        R   C  t    =   ln   (    P  t    P   t  -  1     )     .        R   subscript  C  t         subscript  P  t    subscript  P    t  1        RC_{t}=\ln\left(\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\right).     If this instantaneous return is received continuously for one period, then the initial value P t-1 will grow to     P  t   =    P   t  -  1    ⋅   e   R   C  t           subscript  P  t    normal-⋅   subscript  P    t  1     superscript  e    R   subscript  C  t        P_{t}=P_{t-1}\cdot e^{RC_{t}}   during that period. See also continuous compounding .  Since this analysis did not adjust for the effects of inflation on the purchasing power of P t , RS and RC are referred to as nominal rates of return .  Real return  Let    π  t     subscript  π  t    \pi_{t}   be the purchasing power of a dollar at time t (the number of bundles of consumption that can be purchased for $1). Then     π  t   =   1  /   (   P   L  t    )         subscript  π  t     1    P   subscript  L  t       \pi_{t}=1/(PL_{t})   , where PL t is the price level at t (the dollar price of a bundle of consumption goods). The simple inflation rate IS t from t –1 to t is      P   L  t     P   L   t  -  1      -  1          P   subscript  L  t      P   subscript  L    t  1      1    \tfrac{PL_{t}}{PL_{t-1}}-1   . Thus, continuing the above nominal example, the final value of the investment expressed in real terms is        P  t   r  e  a  l    =    P  t   ⋅    P   L   t  -  1      P   L  t       .       superscript   subscript  P  t     r  e  a  l     normal-⋅   subscript  P  t       P   subscript  L    t  1       P   subscript  L  t        P_{t}^{real}=P_{t}\cdot\frac{PL_{t-1}}{PL_{t}}.     Then the continuously compounded real rate of return    R   C   r  e  a  l        R   superscript  C    r  e  a  l      RC^{real}   is        R   C  t   r  e  a  l     =   ln   (    P  t   r  e  a  l     P   t  -  1     )     .        R   superscript   subscript  C  t     r  e  a  l          superscript   subscript  P  t     r  e  a  l     subscript  P    t  1        RC_{t}^{real}=\ln\left(\frac{P_{t}^{real}}{P_{t-1}}\right).     The continuously compounded real rate of return is just the continuously compounded nominal rate of return minus the continuously compounded inflation rate.
