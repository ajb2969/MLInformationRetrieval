   Hotelling's lemma      Hotelling's lemma   Hotelling's lemma is a result in microeconomics that relates the supply of a good to the profit of the good's producer. It was first shown by Harold Hotelling , and is widely used in the theory of the firm . The lemma is very simple, and can be stated:  Let    y   (  p  )       y  p    y(p)   be a firm's net supply function in terms of a certain good's price (   p   p   p   ). Then:       y   (  p  )    =     ∂  π    (  p  )     ∂  p          y  p         π   p     p      y(p)=\frac{\partial\pi(p)}{\partial p}     for   π   π   \pi   the profit function of the firm in terms of the good's price, assuming that    p  >  0      p  0    p>0   and that derivative exists.  The proof of the theorem stems from the fact that for a profit-maximizing firm, the maximum of the firm's profit at some output     y  *    (  p  )        superscript  y    p    y^{*}(p)   is given by the minimum of     π   (   p  *   )    -    p  *    y  *    (  p  )          π   superscript  p        superscript  p     superscript  y    p     \pi(p^{*})-p^{*}y^{*}(p)   at some price,    p  *     superscript  p     p^{*}   , namely where        ∂  π    (  p  )     ∂  p    -  y   =  0              π   p     p    y   0    \frac{\partial\pi(p)}{\partial p}-y=0   holds. Thus,     y   (  p  )    =     ∂  π    (  p  )     ∂  p          y  p         π   p     p      y(p)=\frac{\partial\pi(p)}{\partial p}   ; QED.  The proof is also a corollary of the envelope theorem .  See also   Hotelling's law  Hotelling's rule  Supply and demand  Shephard's lemma   References    Varian, H. 1992.
