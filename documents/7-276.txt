Hotelling's lemma

Hotelling's lemma is a result in microeconomics that relates the supply of a good to the profit of the good's producer. It was first shown by Harold Hotelling, and is widely used in the theory of the firm. The lemma is very simple, and can be stated:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a firm's net supply function in terms of a certain good's price (
 
 
 
 ). Then:



for 
 
 
 
  the profit function of the firm in terms of the good's price, assuming that 
 
 
 
  and that derivative exists.
The proof of the theorem stems from the fact that for a profit-maximizing firm, the maximum of the firm's profit at some output 
 
 
 
  is given by the minimum of 
 
 
 
  at some price, 
 
 
 
 , namely where 
 
 
 
  holds. Thus,

The proof is also a corollary of the envelope theorem.
