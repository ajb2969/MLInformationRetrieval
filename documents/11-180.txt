Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydratase

In enzymology, a bile-acid 7alpha-dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate 
 
 
 
  12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dienoate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate, and two products, 12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dienoate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate hydro-lyase (12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dienoate-forming). This enzyme is also called 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate hydro-lyase.
