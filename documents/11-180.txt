   Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydratase      Bile-acid 7alpha-dehydratase   In enzymology , a bile-acid 7alpha-dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dienoate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate , and two products , 12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dienoate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate hydro-lyase (12alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochola-4,6-dienoate-forming) . This enzyme is also called 7alpha,12alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoate hydro-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
