   Graded-index fiber      Graded-index fiber   In fiber optics , a graded-index or gradient-index fiber is an optical fiber whose core has a refractive index that decreases with increasing radial distance from the optical axis of the fiber.  Because parts of the core closer to the fiber axis have a higher refractive index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber. The most common refractive index profile for a graded-index fiber is very nearly parabolic. The parabolic profile results in continual refocusing of the rays in the core, and minimizes modal dispersion.  Multi-mode optical fiber can be built with either graded index or step index . The advantage of the multi-mode graded index compared to the multi-mode step index is the considerable decrease in modal dispersion . Modal dispersion can be further decreased by selecting a smaller core size (less than 5-10μm) and forming a single mode step index fiber. 1  This type of fiber is normalized by the International Telecommunications Union ITU-T at recommendation G.651.1. 2  Pulse dispersion  Pulse dispersion in a graded index optical fiber is given by         Pulse   dispersion   =    k  δ   n     n  1    l   c    ,        Pulse  dispersion       k  δ  n   subscript  n  1   l   c     \mathrm{Pulse~{}dispersion}=\frac{k\delta n\ n_{1}\ l}{c}\,\!,     where      δ  n      δ  n    \delta n\,\!   is the difference in refractive indices of core and cladding,      n  1     subscript  n  1    n_{1}\,\!   is the refractive index of the cladding,     l   l   l\,\!   is the length of the fiber taken for observing the pulse dispersion,      c  ≈     3  ×    10  8     m   /  s       c        3   superscript  10  8    normal-m   normal-s     c\approx 3\times 10^{8}~{}\mathrm{m/s}\,\!   is the speed of light , and     k   k   k\,\!   is the constant of graded index profile.
