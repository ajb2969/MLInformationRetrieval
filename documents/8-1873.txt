   Hamming graph      Hamming graph   Hamming graphs are a special class of graphs named after Richard Hamming and used in several branches of mathematics and computer science . Let S be a set of q elements and d a positive integer. The Hamming graph H ( d , q ) has vertex set S d , the set of ordered d -tuples of elements of S , or sequences of length d from S . Two vertices are adjacent if they differ in precisely one coordinate; that is, if their Hamming distance is one. The Hamming graph H ( d , q ) is, equivalently, the Cartesian product of d  complete graphs  K q . 1  In some cases, Hamming graphs may be considered more generally as the Cartesian products of complete graphs that may be of varying sizes. 2 Unlike the Hamming graphs H ( d , q ), the graphs in this more general class are not necessarily distance-regular , but they continue to be regular and vertex-transitive .  Special Cases   H (2,3), which is the generalized quadrangle G  Q (2,1) 3  H (1, q ), which is the complete graph K q 4  H (2, q ), which is the lattice graph L q,q and also the rook's graph 5  H ( d ,1), which is the singleton graph K 1  H ( d ,2), which is the hypercube graph  Q d 6   Applications  The Hamming graphs are interesting in connection with error-correcting codes 7 and association schemes , 8 to name two areas. They have also been considered as a communications network topology in distributed computing . 9  Computational complexity  It is possible to test whether a graph is a Hamming graph, and in the case that it is find a labeling of it with tuples that realizes it as a Hamming graph, in linear time . 10  References  External links      "  Category:Parametric families of graphs  Category:Regular graphs     . ↩  . ↩  .
