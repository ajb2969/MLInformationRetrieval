Constant problem

In mathematics, the constant problem is the problem of deciding if a given expression is equal to zero.
The problem
This problem is also referred to as the identity problem1 or the method of zero estimates. It has no formal statement as such but refers to a general problem prevalent in transcendence theory. Often proofs in transcendence theory are proofs by contradiction, specifically they use some auxiliary function to create an integer n ≥ 0 which is shown to satisfy n 1, ..., xn are real numbers then there is an algorithm2 for deciding if there are integers a1, ..., an such that



If the expression we are interested in contains a function which oscillates, such as the sine or cosine function, then it has been shown that the problem is undecidable, a result known as Richardson's theorem. In general, methods specific to the expression being studied are required to prove that it cannot be zero.
