Asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)

Asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) (, asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolysing), glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase, asparagine synthetase B, AS, AS-B) is an enzyme with system name L-aspartate:L-glutamine amido-ligase (AMP-forming).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + L-aspartate + L-glutamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-asparagine + L-glutamate (overall reaction)
 
(1a) L-glutamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-glutamate + NH3

(1b) ATP + L-aspartate + NH3

 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-asparagine
 

The enzyme from Escherichia coli has two active sites6].
