   2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating)      2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating)   In enzymology , a 2-oxopropyl-CoM reductase (carboxylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-mercaptoethanesulfonate + acetoacetate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-(2-oxopropylthio)ethanesulfonate + CO 2 + NADPH   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate , acetoacetate , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 2-(2-oxopropylthio)ethanesulfonate , CO 2 , and NADPH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate,acetoacetate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include NADPH:2-(2-ketopropylthio)ethanesulfonate , oxidoreductase/carboxylase , and NADPH:2-ketopropyl-coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
