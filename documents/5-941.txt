Contorsion tensor

The contorsion tensor in differential geometry expresses the difference between a metric-compatible affine connection with Christoffel symbol

 
  and the unique torsion-free Levi-Civita connection for the same metric.
The contortion tensor 
 
 
 
  is defined in terms of the torsion tensor

 
  as



where the indices are being raised and lowered with respect to the metric:


 
 .
The reason for the non-obvious sum in the definition is that the contortion tensor, being the difference between two metric-compatible Christoffel symbols, must be antisymmetric in the last two indices, whilst the torsion tensor itself is antisymmetric in its first two indices.
The connection can now be written as



where 
 
 
 
  is the torsion-free Levi-Civita connection.
