Conoid

(Figure)
The hyperbolic paraboloid z=xy is a conoid with the x-axis as its axis.

In geometry, a conoid is a Catalan surface all of whose rulings intersect a fixed line, called the axis of the conoid. If all its rulings are perpendicular to its axis, then the conoid is called a right conoid.[http://books.google.com/books?id=K31Nzi_xhoQC&pg;;=PA277&dq;=conoid+maple&lr;=&ei;=B9hvSs_qKYzSkASR8c3XDg]
For example, the hyperbolic paraboloid z = xy is a conoid (in fact, a right conoid) with x-axis and y-axis as its two axes.
A conoid can be represented by parametric equations



where {ℓ, m, n} is a vector parallel to the axis of the conoid and ƒ(u) is some function.
If ℓ = m = 0 and n = 1, then the conoid is a right conoid.
