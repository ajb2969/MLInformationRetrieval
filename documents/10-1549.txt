Protein-disulfide reductase (glutathione)




Protein-disulfide reductase (glutathione)

In enzymology, a protein-disulfide reductase (glutathione) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 glutathione + protein-disulfide 
 
 
 
  glutathione disulfide + protein-dithiol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glutathione and protein disulfide, whereas its two products are glutathione disulfide and protein dithiol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutathione:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase, insulin reductase, reductase, protein disulfide (glutathione), protein disulfide transhydrogenase, glutathione-protein disulfide oxidoreductase, protein disulfide reductase (glutathione), GSH-insulin transhydrogenase, protein-disulfide interchange enzyme, protein-disulfide isomerase/oxidoreductase, thiol:protein-disulfide oxidoreductase, and thiol-protein disulphide oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism.
Structural studies
