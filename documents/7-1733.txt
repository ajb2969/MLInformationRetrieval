   Born–Huang approximation      Born–Huang approximation   The Born–Huang approximation 1 (named after Max Born and Huang Kun ) is an approximation closely related to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation . It takes into account diagonal nonadiabatic effects in the electronic Hamiltonian than the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. 2 Despite the addition of correction terms, the electronic states remain uncoupled under the Born–Huang approximation, making it an adiabatic approximation .  Mathematical formula  The Born–Huang approximation asserts that the representation matrix of nuclear kinetic energy operator in the basis of Born–Oppenheimer electronic wavefunctions is diagonal:        ⟨    χ   k  ′     (  𝐫  ;  𝐑  )    |   T  n   |    χ  k    (  𝐫  ;  𝐑  )    ⟩    (  𝐫  )    =    𝒯  k    (  𝐑  )    δ    k  ′   k          subscript   quantum-operator-product     subscript  χ   superscript  k  normal-′     𝐫  𝐑     subscript  T  normal-n      subscript  χ  k    𝐫  𝐑     𝐫      subscript  𝒯  normal-k   𝐑   subscript  δ     superscript  k  normal-′   k       \langle\chi_{k^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})|T_{\mathrm{n}}|\chi_{k}(%
 \mathbf{r};\mathbf{R})\rangle_{(\mathbf{r})}=\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{%
 R})\delta_{k^{\prime}k}     Consequences  The Born–Huang approximation loosens the Born–Oppenheimer approximation by including some electronic matrix elements, while at the same time maintains its diagonal structure in the nuclear equations of motion. As a result, the nuclei still move on isolated surfaces, obtained by the addition of a small correction to the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface .  Under the Born–Huang approximation, the Schrödinger equation of the molecular system simplifies to          [    T  n   +    E  k    (  𝐑  )    +    𝒯  k    (  𝐑  )     ]    ϕ  k    (  𝐑  )    =    E   ϕ  k    (  𝐑  )    for     k  =   1  ,  …  ,  K     ,     formulae-sequence       delimited-[]     subscript  T  normal-n      subscript  E  k   𝐑      subscript  𝒯  normal-k   𝐑      subscript  ϕ  k   𝐑      E   subscript  ϕ  k   𝐑   for      k   1  normal-…  K      \left[T_{\mathrm{n}}+E_{k}(\mathbf{R})+\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{R})%
 \right]\;\phi_{k}(\mathbf{R})=E\phi_{k}(\mathbf{R})\quad\mathrm{for}\quad k=1,%
 \ldots,K,     The quantity    [     E  k    (  𝐑  )    +    𝒯  k    (  𝐑  )     ]     delimited-[]       subscript  E  k   𝐑      subscript  𝒯  normal-k   𝐑      \left[E_{k}(\mathbf{R})+\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{R})\right]   serves as the corrected potential energy surface.  Upper-Bound property  The value of Born–Huang approximation is that it provides the upper-bound for the ground state energy. 3 The Born–Oppenheimer approximation, on the other hand, provides the lower-bound for this value. 4  See also   Vibronic coupling  Born–Oppenheimer approximation   References  "  Category:Quantum chemistry  Category:Approximations     ↩  Mathematical Methods and the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation ↩   ↩
