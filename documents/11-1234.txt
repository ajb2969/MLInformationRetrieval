   Digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase      Digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase   In enzymology , a digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + 3-(beta-D-galactosyl)-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 3-[alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-galactosyl]-1,2-diacyl-sn- glycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and 3-(beta-D-galactosyl)-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol , whereas its 3 products are UDP , [[3-[alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-galactosyl]-1,2-diacyl-sn-]], and glycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:3-(beta-D-galactosyl)-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 6-alpha-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include DGD1 , DGD2 , DGDG synthase (ambiguous) , UDP-galactose-dependent DGDG synthase , UDP-galactose-dependent digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase , and UDP-galactose:MGDG galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
