   Sign function      Sign function   (Figure)  Signum function y = sgn(x)   In mathematics , the sign function or signum function (from signum , Latin for "sign") is an odd  mathematical function that extracts the sign of a real number . In mathematical expressions the sign function is often represented as sgn .  Definition  The signum function of a real number  x is defined as follows:       sgn   (  x  )    :=   {      -  1        if  x   <  0   ,       0       if  x   =  0   ,       1      if  x   >  0.          assign   sgn  x    cases    1       if  x   0   0      if  x   0   1      if  x   0.      \operatorname{sgn}(x):=\begin{cases}-1&\text{if }x<0,\\
 0&\text{if }x=0,\\
 1&\text{if }x>0.\end{cases}     Properties  Any real number can be expressed as the product of its absolute value and its sign function:       x  =    sgn   (  x  )    ⋅   |  x  |     .      x   normal-⋅   sgn  x     x      x=\operatorname{sgn}(x)\cdot|x|\,.   It follows that whenever x is not equal to 0 we have       sgn   (  x  )    =   x   |  x  |    =    |  x  |   x          sgn  x     x    x             x   x      \operatorname{sgn}(x)={x\over|x|}={|x|\over x}   Similarly, for any real number x ,       |  x  |   =    sgn   (  x  )    ⋅  x         x    normal-⋅   sgn  x   x     |x|=\operatorname{sgn}(x)\cdot x     The signum function is the derivative of the absolute value function (up to the indeterminacy at zero): Note, the resultant power of x is 0, similar to the ordinary derivative of x. The numbers cancel and all we are left with is the sign of x.        d   |  x  |     d  x    =    sgn   (  x  )    for  x   ≠  0            d    x      d  x       sgn  x   for  x        0     {d|x|\over dx}=\operatorname{sgn}(x)\mbox{ for }x\neq 0   .  The signum function is differentiable with derivative 0 everywhere except at 0. It is not differentiable at 0 in the ordinary sense, but under the generalised notion of differentiation in distribution theory , the derivative of the signum function is two times the Dirac delta function , which can be demonstrated using the identity       sgn   (  x  )    =    2  H   (  x  )    -   1         sgn  x       2  H  x   1     \operatorname{sgn}(x)=2H(x)-1\,    1 (where H ( x ) is the Heaviside step function using the standard H (0) = 1/2 formalism). Using this identity, it is easy to derive the distributional derivative:         d   sgn   (  x  )      d  x    =   2    d  H   (  x  )     d  x     =   2  δ   (  x  )     .            d   sgn  x      d  x      2      d  H  x     d  x            2  δ  x      {d\operatorname{sgn}(x)\over dx}=2{dH(x)\over dx}=2\delta(x)\,.    2  The signum can also be written using the Iverson bracket notation:      sgn   (  x  )   =  -   [  x  <  0  ]   +   [  x  >  0  ]   .     fragments  sgn   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)      fragments  normal-[  x   0  normal-]     fragments  normal-[  x   0  normal-]   normal-.    \ \operatorname{sgn}(x)=-[x<0]+[x>0]\,.     The signum can also be written using the floor and the absolute value functions:        sgn   (  x  )    =    ⌊   x    |  x  |   +  1    ⌋   -   ⌊    -  x     |   -  x   |   +  1    ⌋     .       sgn  x         x      x   1           x         x    1        \ \operatorname{sgn}(x)=\Bigg\lfloor\frac{x}{|x|+1}\Bigg\rfloor-\Bigg\lfloor%
 \frac{-x}{|-x|+1}\Bigg\rfloor\,.     For    k  ≫  1     much-greater-than  k  1    k\gg 1   , a smooth approximation of the sign function is        sgn   (  x  )    ≈   tanh   (   k  x   )     .       sgn  x       k  x      \ \operatorname{sgn}(x)\approx\tanh(kx)\,.   Another approximation is        sgn   (  x  )    ≈    x     x  2   +   ϵ  2        .       sgn  x     x       superscript  x  2    superscript  ϵ  2        \ \operatorname{sgn}(x)\approx\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2}+\epsilon^{2}}}\,.   which gets sharper as    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\to 0   , note that it's the derivative of      x  2   +   ϵ  2           superscript  x  2    superscript  ϵ  2      \sqrt{x^{2}+\epsilon^{2}}   . This is inspired from the fact that the above is exactly equal for all nonzero x if    ϵ  =  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon=0   , and has the advantage of simple generalization to higher-dimensional analogues of the sign function (for example, the partial derivatives of      x  2   +   y  2           superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}   ).

Complex signum  The signum function can be generalized to complex numbers as       sgn   (  z  )    =   z   |  z  |         sgn  z     z    z      \operatorname{sgn}(z)=\frac{z}{|z|}   for any z ∈   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   except z = 0. The signum of a given complex number z is the point on the unit circle of the complex plane that is nearest to z . Then, for z ≠ 0,        sgn   (  z  )    =    e   i   arg  z       ,       sgn  z    superscript  e    i    z       \operatorname{sgn}(z)=e^{i\arg z}\,,   where arg is the complex argument function . For reasons of symmetry, and to keep this a proper generalization of the signum function on the reals, also in the complex domain one usually defines, for z = 0:       sgn   (   0  +   0  i    )    =  0       sgn    0    0  i     0    \operatorname{sgn}(0+0i)=0     Another generalization of the sign function for real and complex expressions is csgn , 3 which is defined as:       csgn   (  z  )    =   {     1       if   ℜ   (  z  )     >  0   ,        -  1        if   ℜ   (  z  )     <  0   ,        sgn   (   ℑ   (  z  )    )        if   ℜ   (  z  )     =  0            csgn  z    cases  1      if    z    0     1       if    z    0    sgn    z        if    z    0      \operatorname{csgn}(z)=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }\Re(z)>0,\\
 -1&\text{if }\Re(z)<0,\\
 \operatorname{sgn}(\Im(z))&\text{if }\Re(z)=0\end{cases}   where    ℜ   (  z  )       z    \Re(z)   is the real part of z,    ℑ   (  z  )       z    \Im(z)   is the imaginary part of z.  We then have (except for z = 0):        csgn   (  z  )    =   z    z  2     =     z  2    z    .         csgn  z     z     superscript  z  2               superscript  z  2    z      \operatorname{csgn}(z)=\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^{2}}}=\frac{\sqrt{z^{2}}}{z}.     Generalized signum function  At real values of    x    x   ~{}x~{}   , it is possible to define a generalized function –version of the signum function,     ε   (  x  )    ,      ε  x    \varepsilon(x),   such that      ε     (  x  )   2    =   1         ε   superscript  x  2    1    ~{}\varepsilon(x)^{2}=1~{}   everywhere, including at the point     x   =   0       x  0    ~{}x=0~{}   (unlike   sgn   sgn   ~{}\operatorname{sgn}~{}   , for which    sgn    (  0  )   2   =   0      fragments  sgn   superscript   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)   2    0    \operatorname{sgn}(0)^{2}=0~{}   ). This generalized signum allows construction of the algebra of generalized functions , but the price of such generalization is the loss of commutativity . In particular, the generalized signum anticommutes with the Dirac delta function 4         ε   (  x  )   δ   (  x  )    +   δ   (  x  )   ε   (  x  )     =   0    ;          ε  x  δ  x     δ  x  ε  x    0    \varepsilon(x)\delta(x)+\delta(x)\varepsilon(x)=0~{};   in addition,     ε    (  x  )       ε  x    ~{}\varepsilon(x)~{}   cannot be evaluated at     x   =   0       x  0    ~{}x=0~{}   ; and the special name,   ε   ε   \varepsilon   is necessary to distinguish it from the function   sgn   sgn   ~{}\operatorname{sgn}~{}   . (    ε   (  0  )       ε  0    \varepsilon(0)   is not defined, but     sgn   (  0  )    =   0        sgn  0   0    ~{}\operatorname{sgn}(0)=0~{}   .)
