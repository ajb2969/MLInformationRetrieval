   Alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase      Alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase   In enzymology , an alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CMP-N-acetylneuraminate + alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D-galactosyl-R   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,8-alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D- galactosyl-R   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CMP-N-acetylneuraminate and alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D-galactosyl-R , whereas its 3 products are CMP , alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,8-alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D- , and galactosyl-R . This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways : glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - neo-lactoseries , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - globoseries , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - ganglioseries , and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those glycosyltransferases that do not transfer hexosyl or pentosyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CMP-N-acetylneuraminate:alpha-N-acetylneuraminyl-2,3-beta-D-galactos ide alpha-2,8-N-acetylneuraminyltransferase . Other names in common use include cytidine monophosphoacetylneuraminate-ganglioside GM3 , alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase , ganglioside GD3 synthase , ganglioside GD3 synthetase sialyltransferase , CMP-NeuAc:LM1(alpha2-8) sialyltranferase , GD3 synthase , and SAT-2 .
