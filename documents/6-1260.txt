   Five Equations That Changed the World      Five Equations That Changed the World   Five Equations That Changed the World: The Power and Poetry of Mathematics is a book by Michael Guillen , published in 1995. It is divided into five chapters that talk about five different equations in physics and the people who have developed them. The scientists and their equations are:   Isaac Newton     F  =    G  M  m   /   r  2        F      G  M  m    superscript  r  2      F=GMm/r^{2}   ( Universal Law of Gravity )  Daniel Bernoulli ( Law of Hydrodynamic Pressure )  Michael Faraday ( Law of Electromagnetic Induction )  Rudolf Clausius ( Second Law of Thermodynamics )  Albert Einstein ( Theory of Special Relativity )   The book is a light study in science and history, portraying the preludes to and times and settings of discoveries that have been the basis of further development, including space travel , flight and nuclear power . Each chapter of the book is divided into sections titled Veni, Vidi, Vici.  The reviews of the book have been mixed. Publishers Weekly called it "wholly accessible, beautifully written", Kirkus Reviews wrote that it is a "crowd-pleasing kind of book designed to make the science as palatable as possible", 1 and Frank Mahnke wrote that Guillen "has a nice touch for the history of mathematics and physics and their impact on the world". 2 However, in contrast, Charles Stephens panned "the superficiality of the author's treatment of scientific ideas", 3 and the editors of The Capital Times called the book a "miserable failure" at its goal of helping the public appreciate the beauty of mathematics .  Summary: Isaac Newton found “Law of the Universal Gravitation.” He coming from poor family and his mom left him but he worked very much and his law very important for physics. Also he found “Infinitesimal Law.” This law cause to change science’s language to mathematic language. Johann Bernoulli hate to Newton but his son takes an example by Newton. Johann and Daniel already to hate from each other.  Daniel Bernoulli found “Law of the Hydrodynamic Pressure.” But his story is too interesting. His father Johann Bernoulli is jealousy to his son so Johann steal Daniel’s equation with Leonard Euler’s help. Leonard Euler is student of Johann. Daniel thought Leonard was Daniel’s friend so he gave his equation to Leonard but Leonard trick to Daniel and gave equation to Johann. So Johann publish “Hydrodynamic Pressure” earlier than Daniel. A lot of books giving this equation to just “Bernoulli Equation.” I think this mean war of Johann between Daniel’s winner indeterminate.  Michael Faraday found “Law of Electromagnetic Induction.” He explain this law to “When the magnetic force increase or decrease electricity is generate; If this magnetic force fast increase or decrease magnetic force is generate more electricity.” But this formula couldn’t translate to mathematic language, so this formula takes so much adverse response. And finally Clark Maxwell translate this formula to mathematic, language.  Rudolf Clausius found “Second Law of Thermodynamics. He explain this law to “Changing on total entropy of universe is bigger than zero everytime.”Entropy is a function based on a system that explains the possibility of heat converting to work.  A lot of people hear e=mc² formula. Albert Einstein is founder this formula. He explain this formula to “Theory of Special Relativity.” On 1999 year, 100 physicists join to millennium voting and he get most vote so he choosed best physicist in the world. Also he has interesting story on his dead. When he dead his body burned and his ashes throw but Thomas Stoltz Harvey steal his brain and used it on scientific works.
