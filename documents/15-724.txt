   Kostant's convexity theorem      Kostant's convexity theorem   In mathematics, Kostant's convexity theorem , introduced by , states that the projection of every coadjoint orbit of a connected compact Lie group into the dual of a Cartan subalgebra is a convex set . It is a special case of a more general result for symmetric spaces . Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of ,  and  for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all n by n complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ 1 , ..., λ n ) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ. In fact this result is 'Kostant's linear convexity theorem'; the main focus of  is Kostant's nonlinear convexity theorem which involves the Iwasawa projection rather than the linear projection to the dual of a Cartan subalgebra.  Kostant used this to generalize the Golden–Thompson inequality to all compact groups.  Compact Lie groups  Let K be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus  T and Weyl group  W = N K ( T )/ T . Let their Lie algebras be   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   and   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   . Let P be the orthogonal projection of   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   onto   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   for some Ad-invariant inner product on   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   . Then for X in   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   , P (Ad( K )⋅ X ) is the convex polytope with vertices w ( X ) where w runs over the Weyl group.  Symmetric spaces  Let G be a compact Lie group and σ an involution with K a compact subgroup fixed by σ and containing the identity component of the fixed point subgroup of σ. Thus G / K is a symmetric space of compact type. Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   be their Lie algebras and let σ also denote the corresponding involution of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Let   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   be the −1 eigenspace of σ and let   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   be a maximal Abelian subspace. Let Q be the orthogonal projection of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   onto   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   for some Ad( K )-invariant inner product on   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   . Then for X in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , Q (Ad( K )⋅ X ) is the convex polytope with vertices the w ( X ) where w runs over the restricted Weyl group (the normalizer of   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   in K modulo its centralizer).  The case of a compact Lie group is the special case where G = K × K , K is embedded diagonally and σ is the automorphism of G interchanging the two factors.  Proof for a compact Lie group  Kostant's proof for symmetric spaces is given in . There is an elementary proof just for compact Lie groups using similar ideas, due to : it is based on a generalization of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm to compact Lie groups.  Let K be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus T . For each positive root α there is a homomorphism of SU(2) into K . A simple calculation with 2 by 2 matrices shows that if Y is in   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   and k varies in this image of SU(2), then P (Ad( k )⋅ Y ) traces a straight line between P ( Y ) and its reflection in the root α. In particular the component in the α root space—its "α off-diagonal coordinate"—can be sent to 0. In performing this latter operation, the distance from P ( Y ) to P (Ad( k )⋅ Y ) is bounded above by size of the α off-diagonal coordinate of Y . Let m be the number of positive roots, half the dimension of K / T . Starting from an arbitrary Y 1 take the largest off-diagonal coordinate and send it to zero to get Y 2 . Continue in this way, to get a sequence ( Y n ). Then         ∥    P  ⟂    (   Y   n  +  1    )    ∥   2   ≤    (    m  -  1   m   )     ∥    P  ⟂    (   Y  n   )    ∥   2     .       superscript   norm     superscript  P  perpendicular-to    subscript  Y    n  1      2         m  1   m    superscript   norm     superscript  P  perpendicular-to    subscript  Y  n     2      \displaystyle{\|P^{\perp}(Y_{n+1})\|^{2}\leq\left({m-1\over m}\right)\|P^{%
 \perp}(Y_{n})\|^{2}.}     Thus P ⊥ ( Y n ) tends to 0 and        ∥   P   (    Y   n  +  1    -   Y  n    )    ∥   ≤   ∥    P  ⟂    (   Y  n   )    ∥    .       norm    P     subscript  Y    n  1     subscript  Y  n       norm     superscript  P  perpendicular-to    subscript  Y  n       \displaystyle{\|P(Y_{n+1}-Y_{n})\|\leq\|P^{\perp}(Y_{n})\|.}     Hence X n = P ( Y n ) is a Cauchy sequence, so tends to X in   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   . Since Y n = P ( Y n ) ⊕ P ⊥ ( Y n ), Y n tends to X . On the other hand X n lies on the line segment joining X n +1 and its reflection in the root α. Thus X n lies in the Weyl group polytope defined by X n +1 . These convex polytopes are thus increasing as n increases and hence P ( Y ) lies in the polytope for X . This can be repeated for each Z in the K -orbit of X . The limit is necessarily in the Weyl group orbit of X and hence P (Ad( K )⋅ X ) is contained in the convex polytope defined by W ( X ).  To prove the opposite inclusion, take X to be a point in the positive Weyl chamber. Then all the other points Y in the convex hull of W ( X ) can be obtained by a series of paths in that intersection moving along the negative of a simple root. (This matches a familiar picture from representation theory: if by duality X corresponds to a dominant weight λ, the other weights in the Weyl group polytope defined by λ are those appearing in the irreducible representation of K with highest weight λ. An argument with lowering operators shows that each such weight is linked by a chain to λ obtained by successively subtracting simple roots from λ. See:      ) Each part of the path from X to Y can be obtained by the process described above for the copies of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, so the whole convex polytope lies in P (Ad( K )⋅ X ).  Other proofs  gave another proof of the convexity theorem for compact Lie groups, also presented in . For compact groups,  and  showed that if M is a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian action of a torus T with Lie algebra   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   , then the image of the moment map      M  →   𝔱  *      normal-→  M   superscript  𝔱      \displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{t}^{*}}     is a convex polytope with vertices in the image of the fixed point set of T (the image is a finite set). Taking for M a coadjoint orbit of K in    𝔨  *     superscript  𝔨     \mathfrak{k}^{*}   , the moment map for T is the composition       M  →   𝔨  *   →   𝔱  *    .       normal-→  M   superscript  𝔨      normal-→     superscript  𝔱       \displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{k}^{*}\rightarrow\mathfrak{t}^{*}.}     Using the Ad-invariant inner product to identify    𝔨  *     superscript  𝔨     \mathfrak{k}^{*}   and   𝔨   𝔨   \mathfrak{k}   , the map becomes         Ad   (  K  )    ⋅  X   →  𝔱   ,     normal-→   normal-⋅    Ad  K   X   𝔱    \displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(K)\cdot X\rightarrow\mathfrak{t},}     the restriction of the orthogonal projection. Taking X in   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   , the fixed points of T in the orbit Ad( K )⋅ X are just the orbit under the Weyl group, W ( X ). So the convexity properties of the moment map imply that the image is the convex polytope with these vertices.  gave a simplified direct version of the proof using moment maps.  showed that a generalization of the convexity properties of the moment map could be used to treat the more general case of symmetric spaces. Let τ be a smooth involution of M which takes the symplectic form ω to −ω and such that t ∘ τ = τ ∘ t −1 . Then M and the fixed point set of τ (assumed to be non-empty) have the same image under the moment map. To apply this, let T = exp   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , a torus in G . If X is in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   as before the moment map yields the projection map         Ad   (  G  )    ⋅  X   →  𝔞   .     normal-→   normal-⋅    Ad  G   X   𝔞    \displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(G)\cdot X\rightarrow\mathfrak{a}.}     Let τ be the map τ( Y ) = − σ( Y ). The map above has the same image as that of the fixed point set of τ, i.e. Ad( K )⋅ X . Its image is the convex polytope with vertices the image of the fixed point set of T on Ad( G )⋅ X , i.e. the points w ( X ) for w in W = N K ( T )/C K ( T ).
