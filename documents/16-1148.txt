   Havel–Hakimi algorithm      Havel–Hakimi algorithm   The Havel–Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory solving the graph realization problem , i.e. the question if there exists for a finite list of nonnegative integers a simple graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. For a positive answer the list of integers is called graphic . The algorithm constructs a special solution if one exists or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm . The algorithm was published by , and later by .  The algorithm  The algorithm is based on the following theorem.  Let    S  =   (   d  1   ,  …  ,   d  n   )       S    subscript  d  1   normal-…   subscript  d  n      S=(d_{1},\dots,d_{n})   be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is nonincreasing . List   S   S   S   is graphic if and only if the finite list     S  ′   =   (    d  2   -  1   ,    d  3   -  1   ,  …  ,    d    d  1   +  1    -  1   ,   d    d  1   +  2    ,  …  ,   d  n   )        superscript  S  normal-′       subscript  d  2   1      subscript  d  3   1   normal-…     subscript  d     subscript  d  1   1    1    subscript  d     subscript  d  1   2    normal-…   subscript  d  n      S^{\prime}=(d_{2}-1,d_{3}-1,\dots,d_{d_{1}+1}-1,d_{d_{1}+2},\dots,d_{n})   has nonnegative integers and is graphic.  Is the given list   S   S   S   graphic then the theorem will be applied at most    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   times setting in each further step    S  :=   S  ′      assign  S   superscript  S  normal-′     S:=S^{\prime}   . Note that it can be necessary to sort this list again. This process ends when the whole list    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   consists of zeros. In each step of the algorithm one constructs the edges of a graph with vertices     v  1   ,  ⋯  ,   v  n       subscript  v  1   normal-⋯   subscript  v  n     v_{1},\cdots,v_{n}   , i.e. if it is possible to reduce the list   S   S   S   to    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   , then we add edges     {   v  1   ,   v  2   }   ,   {   v  1   ,   v  3   }   ,  ⋯  ,   {   v  1   ,   v    d  1   +  1    }        subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2      subscript  v  1    subscript  v  3    normal-⋯    subscript  v  1    subscript  v     subscript  d  1   1       \{v_{1},v_{2}\},\{v_{1},v_{3}\},\cdots,\{v_{1},v_{d_{1}+1}\}   . When the list   S   S   S   cannot be reduced to a list    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   of nonnegative integers in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list   S   S   S   from the beginning is not graphic.
