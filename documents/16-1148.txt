Havel–Hakimi algorithm

The Havel–Hakimi algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory solving the graph realization problem, i.e. the question if there exists for a finite list of nonnegative integers a simple graph such that its degree sequence is exactly this list. For a positive answer the list of integers is called graphic. The algorithm constructs a special solution if one exists or proves that one cannot find a positive answer. This construction is based on a recursive algorithm. The algorithm was published by , and later by .
The algorithm
The algorithm is based on the following theorem.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite list of nonnegative integers that is nonincreasing. List 
 
 
 
  is graphic if and only if the finite list 
 
 
 
  has nonnegative integers and is graphic.
Is the given list 
 
 
 
  graphic then the theorem will be applied at most 
 
 
 
  times setting in each further step 
 
 
 
 . Note that it can be necessary to sort this list again. This process ends when the whole list 
 
 
 
  consists of zeros. In each step of the algorithm one constructs the edges of a graph with vertices 
 
 
 
 , i.e. if it is possible to reduce the list 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , then we add edges 
 
 
 
 . When the list 
 
 
 
  cannot be reduced to a list 
 
 
 
  of nonnegative integers in any step of this approach, the theorem proves that the list 
 
 
 
  from the beginning is not graphic.
