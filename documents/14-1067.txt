   Teichmüller character      Teichmüller character  In [[number theory]], the '''Teichmüller character''' ω (at a prime ' 'p ) is a character of ( Z / q' 'Z ) × , where q = p if p is odd and q=4 if p = 2, taking values in the roots of unity of the p -adic integers . It was introduced by Oswald Teichmüller . Identifying the roots of unity in the p -adic integers with the corresponding ones in the complex numbers, ω can be considered as a usual Dirichlet character of conductor q . More generally, given a complete  discrete valuation ring  O whose residue field  k is perfect of characteristic  p , there is a unique multiplicative section of the natural surjection . The image of an element under this map is called its Teichmüller representative . The restriction of ω to k × is called the Teichmüller character .  Definition  If x is a p -adic integer, then ω( x ) is the unique solution of ω( x ) p = ω( x ) that is congruent to x mod p . It can also be defined by       ω   (  x  )    =    lim   n  →  ∞     x   p  n           ω  x     subscript    normal-→  n      superscript  x   superscript  p  n       \omega(x)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x^{p^{n}}     The multiplicative group of p -adic units is a product of the finite group of roots of unity and a group isomorphic to the p -adic integers. The finite group is cyclic of order p – 1 or 2, as p is odd or even, respectively, and so it is isomorphic to ( Z / q Z ) × . The Teichmüller character gives a canonical isomorphism between these two groups.  References   Section 4.3 of      "  Category:Class field theory
