   Deacetylipecoside synthase      Deacetylipecoside synthase   In enzymology , a deacetylipecoside synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   deacetylipecoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dopamine + secologanin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are deacetylipecoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dopamine and secologanin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically amine lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deacetylipecoside dopamine-lyase (secologanin-forming) . This enzyme is also called deacetylipecoside dopamine-lyase . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 4.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
