   Kozeny–Carman equation      Kozeny–Carman equation   The Kozeny–Carman equation (or Carman-Kozeny equation ) is a relation used in the field of fluid dynamics to calculate the pressure drop of a fluid flowing through a packed bed of solids. It is named after Josef Kozeny and Philip C. Carman. The equation is only valid for laminar flow . The equation was derived by Kozeny and Carman (see 1 ) from a starting point of (a) modelling fluid flow in a packed bed as laminar fluid flow in a collection of curving passages/tubes crossing the packed bed and (b) Poiseuille's law describing laminar fluid flow in straight, circular section pipes.  Equation  The equation is given as: 2 3        Δ  p   L   =     180  μ     Φ  s  2    D  p  2        (   1  -  ϵ   )   2    ϵ  3     v  s            normal-Δ  p   L         180  μ      superscript   subscript  normal-Φ  normal-s   2    superscript   subscript  D  normal-p   2        superscript    1  ϵ   2    superscript  ϵ  3     subscript  v  s      \frac{\Delta p}{L}=\frac{180\mu}{\Phi_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}D_{\mathrm{p}}^{2}}\frac%
 {(1-\epsilon)^{2}}{\epsilon^{3}}v_{s}     where:       Δ  p      normal-Δ  p    \Delta p   is the pressure drop;     L   L   L   is the total height of the bed;      v  s     subscript  v  s    v_{s}   is the superficial or "empty-tower" velocity ;     μ   μ   \mu   is the viscosity of the fluid;     ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the porosity of the bed;      Φ  s     subscript  normal-Φ  normal-s    \Phi_{\mathrm{s}}   is the sphericity of the particles in the packed bed;      D  p     subscript  D  normal-p    D_{\mathrm{p}}   is the diameter of the related spherical particle.   This equation holds for flow through packed beds with particle Reynolds numbers up to approximately 1.0, after which point frequent shifting of flow channels in the bed causes considerable kinetic energy losses.  This equation can be expressed as " flow is proportional to the pressure drop and inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity ", which is known as Darcy's law . 4  History  The equation was first 5 proposed by Kozeny (1927) 6 and later modified by Carman (1937, 1956). 7 8  See also   Fractionating column  Random close pack  Raschig ring  Ergun equation   References    "  Category:Equations of fluid dynamics  Category:Unit operations  Category:Porous media     ↩   ↩   Robert P.
