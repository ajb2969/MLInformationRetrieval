Shuttlecock (film)   ... that the filming of Shuttlecock was described as "highly unorganized chaos" by its producer?   :* Reviewed : Not a self-nom 5x expanded by Dr. Blofeld ( talk ). Nominated by Rosiestep ( talk ) at 16:59, 20 September 2014 (UTC) .  :*  Expansion began on 16 September, is long enough, neutral and well referenced. The hook is interesting and supported by an inline citation. I'm a bit concerned about the number of [ http://tools.wmflabs.org/copyvios?lang=en&project; ;=wikipedia&title;=Shuttlecock+%28film%29&oldid;=&action;=search&use;_engine=0&use;_engine=1&use;_links=0&use;_links=1 similarities with the main source], though; there are many instances where phrases could easily be reworded to avoid any too-close paraphrasing. 97198 ( talk ) 13:00, 23 October 2014 (UTC)  Given the reliance on those sources it's perhaps inevitable. Let this one go thanks.♦ Dr. Blofeld 14:36, 23 October 2014 (UTC)   I'm not comfortable with "letting this one go" and signing off on an article to appear on the main page where I feel some of the text is too close to another source. Maybe another editor will... you can ask for a second opinion at WT:DYK if you think I'm being unreasonable. 97198 ( talk ) 03:23, 24 October 2014 (UTC)  To be fair, the tool is flagging a couple of properly identified quotes as copyvio - they are not. However, there are a few instances that are quite close. Short excerpts like "wanted the characters and settings Americanized" can be directly quoted, whereas the last sentence of that paragraph, for example, can be rephrased further while still maintaining the meaning of the source. Nikkimaria ( talk ) 03:41, 25 October 2014 (UTC)       Dr. Blofeld , as this is your article, it's up to you to address the issues raised here, given that Rosiestep on wikibreak. It's been about two weeks; please let us know if you intend to make any changes to the article. If not, we'll have to close the nomination. BlueMoonset ( talk ) 02:36, 7 November 2014 (UTC)     What part about "Let this one go thanks." didn't go get?? Close it, please.♦ Dr. Blofeld 12:00, 7 November 2014 (UTC)   Dr. Blofeld , "let this one go" can easily mean "let this one go through", as was clearly the interpretation by 97198. Next time, please just withdraw the nomination; that's clear and unambiguous. Thanks. BlueMoonset ( talk ) 22:44, 7 November 2014 (UTC)    Withdrawn by creator; closing per request.
