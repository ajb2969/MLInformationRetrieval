   Ribosylpyrimidine nucleosidase      Ribosylpyrimidine nucleosidase   In enzymology , a ribosylpyrimidine nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a pyrimidine nucleoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribose + a pyrimidine base   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyrimidine nucleoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-ribose and pyrimidine base .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyrimidine-nucleoside ribohydrolase . Other names in common use include N-ribosylpyrimidine nucleosidase , pyrimidine nucleosidase , N-ribosylpyrimidine ribohydrolase , pyrimidine nucleoside hydrolase , RihB , YeiK , and nucleoside ribohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
