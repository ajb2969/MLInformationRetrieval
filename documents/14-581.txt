   Range expansion index      Range expansion index   The range expansion index ( REI ) is a technical indicator used in the technical analysis of financial markets . It is intended to chart the relative strength or weakness of a trading vehicle based on the comparison of the recent price changes and the overall price changes for the period.  The REI can be classified as a momentum oscillator , measuring the velocity and magnitude of directional price movements. The REI shows overbought/oversold price conditions by measuring the relation between the sum of "strong" price changes (such that form a trend) and all price changes for the period.  The REI is most typically used on an 8 day timeframe. It changes on a scale from −100 to +100, with the overbought and oversold levels marked at +60 and −60, respectively.  The range expansion index was developed by Thomas DeMark and published in his 1994 book, The New Science of Technical Analysis . 1  Calculation  Two sums are calculated for each day. One is the conditional sum of the "strong" price changes:       S  1   =    ∑   j  =  1   k     n  j    m  j    s  j           S  1     superscript   subscript     j  1    k      subscript  n  j    subscript  m  j    subscript  s  j       S1=\sum_{j=1}^{k}n_{j}m_{j}s_{j}     where   k   k   k   is the period of calculation (usually, 8),    n  j     subscript  n  j    n_{j}   is a first condition:   if ((High[j – 2] < Close[j - 7]) && (High[j - 2] < Close[j - 8]) && (High[j] < High[j - 5]) && (High[j] < High[j - 6])) n_j = 0 else n_j = 1      m  j     subscript  m  j    m_{j}   is a second condition:   if ((Low[j – 2] > Close[j – 7]) && (Low[j – 2] > Close[j – 8]) && (Low[j] > Low[j – 5]) && (Low[j] > Low[j – 6])) m_j = 0 else m_j = 1  and    s  j     subscript  s  j    s_{j}   is the price change parameter:        s  j   =      H  i  g  h   [  j  ]    -   H  i  g  h   [   j  -  2   ]     +   L  o  w   [  j  ]     -   L  o  w   [   j  -  2   ]      ,       subscript  s  j           H  i  g  h   delimited-[]  j      H  i  g  h   delimited-[]    j  2        L  o  w   delimited-[]  j       L  o  w   delimited-[]    j  2        s_{j}=High[j]-High[j-2]+Low[j]-Low[j-2],\!     The second sum is calculated as following:       S  2   =     ∑   j  =  1   k    |    H  i  g  h   [  j  ]    -   H  i  g  h   [   j  -  2   ]     |    +   |    L  o  w   [  j  ]    -   L  o  w   [   j  -  2   ]     |          S  2       superscript   subscript     j  1    k         H  i  g  h   delimited-[]  j      H  i  g  h   delimited-[]    j  2              L  o  w   delimited-[]  j      L  o  w   delimited-[]    j  2          S2=\sum_{j=1}^{k}|High[j]-High[j-2]|+|Low[j]-Low[j-2]|     For each trading day the value of the indicator is calculated:       R  E  I   =     S  1    S  2    100         R  E  I         S  1     S  2    100     REI=\frac{S1}{S2}100     Interpretation  According to Thomas DeMark , price weakness is shown by the indicator when its value rises above level 60 and then declines below it. Price strength is shown when the REI goes below −60 and then rises above that level.  See also   Relative strength index   References  "  Category:Technical indicators     Thomas R.
