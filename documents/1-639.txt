Mersenne prime

In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form  2n − 1}}. This is to say that it is a prime number which is one less than a power of two. They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century. The first four Mersenne primes  are 3, 7, 31, and 127.
If n is a composite number then so is . The definition is therefore unchanged when written  2p − 1}} where p is assumed prime.
More generally, numbers of the form  2n − 1}} without the primality requirement are called Mersenne numbers. Mersenne numbers are sometimes defined to have the additional requirement that n be prime, equivalently that they be pernicious Mersenne numbers, namely those pernicious numbers whose binary representation contains no zeros. The smallest composite pernicious Mersenne number is  2047 {{=}} 23 × 89}}.
, 48 Mersenne primes are known. The largest known prime number  is a Mersenne prime.12
Since 1997, all newly found Mersenne primes have been discovered by the “Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search” (GIMPS), a distributed computing project on the Internet.
About Mersenne primes
Many fundamental questions about Mersenne primes remain unresolved. It is not even known whether the set of Mersenne primes is finite or infinite. The Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and predicts their order of growth. It is also not known whether infinitely many Mersenne numbers with prime exponents are composite, although this would follow from widely believed conjectures about prime numbers, for example, the infinitude of Sophie Germain primes congruent to 3 (mod 4), for these primes p, 2p + 1 (which is also prime) will divides Mp, e.g., 23|M11, 47|M23, 167|M83, 263|M131, 359|M179, 383|M191, 479|M239, and 503|M251. 
The first four Mersenne primes are

 3}},  7}},  31}} and  127}}.
 

A basic theorem about Mersenne numbers states that if Mp is prime, then the exponent p must also be prime. This follows from the identity


 
 
  This rules out primality for Mersenne numbers with composite exponent, such as  24 − 1 {{=}} 15 {{=}} 3 × 5 {{=}} (22 − 1) × (1 + 22)}}.
Though the above examples might suggest that Mp is prime for all primes p, this is not the case, and the smallest counterexample is the Mersenne number

 211 − 1 {{=}} 2047 {{=}} 23 × 89}}.
 

The evidence at hand does suggest that a randomly selected Mersenne number is much more likely to be prime than an arbitrary randomly selected integer of similar size. Nonetheless, prime Mp appear to grow increasingly sparse as p increases. In fact, of the 9,592 prime numbers p up to 100,000,3 Mp is prime for only 28 of them.
The lack of any simple test to determine whether a given Mersenne number is prime makes the search for Mersenne primes a difficult task, since Mersenne numbers grow very rapidly. The Lucas–Lehmer primality test (LLT) is an efficient primality test that greatly aids this task. The search for the largest known prime has somewhat of a cult following. Consequently, a lot of computer power has been expended searching for new Mersenne primes, much of which is now done using distributed computing.
Mersenne primes are used in pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne twister, Park–Miller random number generator, Generalized Shift Register and Fibonacci RNG.
Perfect numbers
Mersenne primes Mp are also noteworthy due to their connection to perfect numbers. In the 4th century BC, Euclid proved that if  is prime, then ) is a perfect number. This number, also expressible as , is the Mp-th triangular number and the  hexagonal number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that, conversely, all even perfect numbers have this form.4 This is known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. It is unknown whether there are any odd perfect numbers.
History
Mersenne primes take their name from the 17th-century French scholar Marin Mersenne, who compiled what was supposed to be a list of Mersenne primes with exponents up to 257, as follows:
2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257
His list was completely accurate until 31, but then becomes largely incorrect, as Mersenne mistakenly included M67 and M257 (which are composite), and omitted M61, M89, and M107 (which are prime). Mersenne gave little indication how he came up with his list.5 
Édouard Lucas proved in 1876 that M127 is indeed prime, as Mersenne claimed. This was the largest known prime number for 75 years, and the largest ever calculated by hand. M61 was determined to be prime in 1883 by Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin, though Mersenne claimed it was composite, and for this reason it is sometimes called Pervushin's number. This was the second-largest known prime number, and it remained so until 1911. Lucas had shown another error in Mersenne's list in 1876. Without finding a factor, Lucas demonstrated that M67 is actually composite. No factor was found until a famous talk by Cole in 1903.6 Without speaking a word, he went to a blackboard and raised 2 to the 67th power, then subtracted one. On the other side of the board, he multiplied  and got the same number, then returned to his seat (to applause) without speaking.7 He later said that the result had taken him "three years of Sundays" to find.8 A correct list of all Mersenne primes in this number range was completed and rigorously verified only about three centuries after Mersenne published his list.
Searching for Mersenne primes
Fast algorithms for finding Mersenne primes are available, and as of 2014 the ten largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes.
The first four Mersenne primes  3}},  7}},  31}} and  127}} were known in antiquity. The fifth,  8191}}, was discovered anonymously before 1461; the next two (M17 and M19) were found by Cataldi in 1588. After nearly two centuries, M31 was verified to be prime by Euler in 1772. The next (in historical, not numerical order) was M127, found by Lucas in 1876, then M61 by Pervushin in 1883. Two more (M89 and M107) were found early in the 20th century, by Powers in 1911 and 1914, respectively.
The best method presently known for testing the primality of Mersenne numbers is the Lucas–Lehmer primality test. Specifically, it can be shown that for prime ,  2p − 1}} is prime if and only if Mp divides , where S0 = 4 and, for k > 0,

 ''Sk − 12 − 2}}


 The search for Mersenne primes was revolutionized by the introduction of the electronic digital computer. Alan Turing searched for them on the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949,9 but the first successful identification of a Mersenne prime, M521, by this means was achieved at 10:00 pm on January 30, 1952 using the U.S. National Bureau of Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC) at the Institute for Numerical Analysis at the University of California, Los Angeles, under the direction of Lehmer, with a computer search program written and run by Prof. R. M. Robinson. It was the first Mersenne prime to be identified in thirty-eight years; the next one, M607, was found by the computer a little less than two hours later. Three more — M1279, M2203, M2281 — were found by the same program in the next several months. M4253 is the first Mersenne prime that is titanic, M44497 is the first gigantic, and M6,972,593 was the first megaprime to be discovered, being a prime with at least 1,000,000 digits.10 All three were the first known prime of any kind of that size.
In September 2008, mathematicians at UCLA participating in GIMPS won part of a $100,000 prize from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for their discovery of a very nearly 13-million-digit Mersenne prime. The prize, finally confirmed in October 2009, is for the first known prime with at least 10 million digits. The prime was found on a Dell OptiPlex 745 on August 23, 2008. This is the eighth Mersenne prime discovered at UCLA.11
On April 12, 2009, a GIMPS server log reported that a 47th Mersenne prime had possibly been found. This report was apparently overlooked until June 4, 2009. The find was verified on June 12, 2009. The prime is . Although it is chronologically the 47th Mersenne prime to be discovered, it is smaller than the largest known at the time, which was the 45th to be discovered.
On January 25, 2013, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered a 48th Mersenne prime,  (a number with 17,425,170 digits), as a result of a search executed by a GIMPS server network.12 This was the third Mersenne prime discovered by Dr. Cooper and his team in the past seven years.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) offers a prize of $150,000 to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with at least 100,000,000 decimal digits13 (the smallest Mersenne number with said amount of digits is ).
Theorems about Mersenne numbers

If a and p are natural numbers such that  is prime, then  or .
 
Proof:  Then  so  Thus  ap − 1.}} However,  is prime, so  ap − 1}} or  In the former case,  ap,}} hence  (which is a contradiction, as neither −1 nor 0 is prime) or  In the latter case,  or  If  however,  0 − 1 {{=}} −1}} which is not prime. Therefore, 

If 2p − 1 is prime, then p is prime.
 
Proof: suppose that p is composite, hence can be written  with a and  Then   2ab − 1}}  (2a)b − 1}}  (2a − 1)[(2a)b − 1 + (2a)b − 2 + … + 2a + 1]}} so  is composite contradicting our assumption that  is prime.

If p is an odd prime, then every prime q that divides  must be 1 plus a multiple of 2p. This holds even when  is prime.
 
Examples: Example I:  31}} is prime, and . Example II:  23 × 89}}, where , and .
Proof: By Fermat's little theorem, q is a factor of . Since q is a factor of , for all positive integers c, q is also a factor of . Since p is prime and q is not a factor of , p is also the smallest positive integer x such that q is a factor of . As a result, for all positive integers x, q is a factor of  if and only if p is a factor of x. Therefore, since q is a factor of , p is a factor of  so . Furthermore, since q is a factor of , which is odd, q is odd. Therefore, .
Note: This fact provides a proof of the infinitude of primes distinct from Euclid's theorem: for every odd prime p, all primes dividing  are larger than p; thus there are always larger primes than any particular prime.

If p is an odd prime, then every prime q that divides  is congruent to .
 
Proof:  2 mod q}}, so  is a square root of . By quadratic reciprocity, every prime modulo which the number 2 has a square root is congruent to .

A Mersenne prime cannot be a Wieferich prime.
 
Proof: We show if  2m − 1}} is a Mersenne prime, then the congruence  does not satisfy. By Fermat's Little theorem, . Now write, . If the given congruence satisfies, then  2mλ − 1}},therefore   1 + 2m + 22m + ... + 2λ − 1m}} . Hence  λ}},and therefore . This leads to , which is impossible since .

A prime number divides at most one prime-exponent Mersenne number,14 so in other words the set of pernicious Mersenne numbers is pairwise coprime.
If p and  are both prime (meaning that p is a Sophie Germain prime), and p is congruent to , then  divides .15

Example: 11 and 23 are both prime, and , so 23 divides .
Proof: Let q be . By Fermat's Little theorem, , so either  or . Supposing latter true, then  (2(p + 1) /2)2 ≡ −2 (mod q)}}, so −2 would be a quadratic residue mod q. However, since p is congruent to , q is congruent to  and therefore 2 is a quadratic residue mod q. Also since q is congruent to , −1 is a quadratic nonresidue mod q, so −2 is the product of a residue and a nonresidue and hence it is a nonresidue, which is a contradiction. Hence, the former congruence must be true and  divides Mp.

All composite divisors of prime-exponent Mersenne numbers pass the Fermat primality test for the base 2.
The number of digits in the decimal representation of Mn equals , where ⌊x⌋ denotes the floor function.

c. 430 BC

Ancient Greek mathematiciansThere is no mentioning among the ancient Egyptians of prime numbers, and they did not have any concept for prime numbers known today. In the Rhind papyrus (1650 BC) the Egyptian fraction expansions have fairly different forms for primes and composites, so it may be argued that they knew about prime numbers. See Prime Numbers Divide [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. "The Egyptians used ($) in the table above for the first primes r=3, 5, 7, or 11 (also for r=23). Here is another intriguing observation: That the Egyptians stopped the use of ($) at 11 suggests they understood (at least some parts of) Eratosthenes's Sieve 2000 years before Eratosthenes 'discovered' it." The Rhind 2/n Table [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. In the school of Pythagoras (b. about 570 – d. about 495 BC) and the Pythagoreans, we find the first sure observations of prime numbers. Hence the first two Mersenne primes, 3 and 7, were known to and may even be said to have been discovered by them. There is no reference, though, to their special form 22 − 1 and 23 − 1 as such. The sources to the knowledge of prime numbers among the Pythagoreans are late. The Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus, AD c. 245–c. 325, states that the Greek Platonic philosopher Speusippus, c. 408 – 339/8 BC, wrote a book named On Pythagorean Numbers. According to Iamblichus this book was based on the works of the Pythagorean Philolaus, c. 470–c. 385 BC, who lived a century after Pythagoras, 570 – c. 495 BC. In his Theology of Arithmetic in the chapter On the Decad, Iamblichus writes: "Speusippus, the son of Plato's sister Potone, and head of the Academy before Xenocrates, compiled a polished little book from the Pythagorean writings which were particularly valued at any time, and especially from the writings of Philolaus; he entitled the book On Pythagorean Numbers. In the first half of the book, he elegantly expounds linear numbers [i.e. prime numbers], polygonal numbers and all sorts of plane numbers, solid numbers and the five figures which are assigned to the elements of the universe, discussing both their individual attributes and their shared features, and their proportionality and reciprocity." Iamblichus The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 112f. [Retrieved 2012-11-11].

Iamblichus also gives us a direct quote from Speusippus' book where Speusippus among other things writes: "Secondly, it is necessary for a perfect number [the concept "perfect number" is not used here in a modern sense] to contain an equal amount of prime and incomposite numbers, and secondary and composite numbers." Iamblichus The Theology of Arithmetic translated by Robin Waterfiled, 1988, p. 113. [Retrieved 2012-11-11]. For the Greek original text, see [http://books.google.se/books?id=cUPXqSb7V1wC&lpg;;=PA276&ots;=Q3QhUOGtvH&dq;=Speusippus%20prime&hl;=sv&pg;=PA140#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Speusippus of Athens: A Critical Study with a Collection of the Related Texts and Commentary by Leonardo Tarán, 1981, p. 140 line 21–22] [Retrieved 2012-11-11] In his comments to Nicomachus of Gerasas's Introduction to Arithmetic, Iamblichus also mentions that Thymaridas, ca. 400 BC – ca. 350 BC, uses the term rectilinear for prime numbers, and that Theon of Smyrna, fl. AD 100, uses euthymetric and linear as alternative terms. Nicomachus of Gerasa, Introduction to Aritmetic, 1926, p. 127 [Retrieved 2012-11-11] It is unclear though when this said Thymaridas lived. "In a highly suspect passage in Iamblichus, Thymaridas is listed as a pupil of Pythagoras himself." Pythagoreanism [Retrieved 2012-11-11] Before Philolaus, c. 470–c. 385 BC, we have no proof of any knowledge of prime numbers.

It is not verified whether any undiscovered Mersenne primes exist between the 44th (M32,582,657) and the 48th (M57,885,161) on this chart; the ranking is therefore provisional. All Mersenne numbers below the 47th (M43,112,609) have been tested at least once but some have not been double-checked. Some Mersenne numbers below the 48th have not yet been tested.79 Primes are not always discovered in increasing order. For example, the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and the 31st. Similarly, M43,112,609 was followed by two smaller Mersenne primes, first 2 weeks later and then 8 months later. M42,643,801 was first found by a machine on April 12, 2009; however, no human took notice of this fact until June 4. Thus, either April 12 or June 4 may be considered the 'discovery' date. The discoverer, Strindmo, apparently used the alias Stig M. Valstad. 
To help visualize the size of the 48th known Mersenne prime, it would require 4,647 pages to display the number in base 10 with 75 digits per line and 50 lines per page.
The largest known Mersenne prime  is also the largest known prime number.80 M43,112,609 was the first discovered prime number with more than 10 million decimal digits.
In modern times, the largest known prime has almost always been a Mersenne prime.81
Factorization of composite Mersenne numbers
The factors of a prime number are by definition one, and the number itself - this section is about composite numbers. Mersenne numbers are very good test cases for the special number field sieve algorithm, so often the largest number factorized with this algorithm has been a Mersenne number. , 2
 
 
 
  − 1 is the record-holder,82 using a variant on the special number field sieve allowing the factorisation of several numbers at once. See integer factorization records for links to more information. The special number field sieve can factorize numbers with more than one large factor. If a number has only one very large factor then other algorithms can factorize larger numbers by first finding small factors and then making a primality test on the cofactor. , the largest factorization with probable prime factors allowed is  604,874,508,299,177 × q}}, where q is a 1,042,896-digit probable prime.83  (or  with both prime and composite Mersenne numbers) (for the primes p, see )

Mersenne primitive part
The primitive part of Mersenne number Mn is , the n-th cyclotomic polynomial at 2, they are

1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 3, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 57, 524287, 205, 2359, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... 
 

Besides, if we notice those prime factors, and delete "old prime factors", for example, 3 divides the 2nd, 6th, 18th, 54th, 162nd, ... terms of this sequence, we only allow the 2nd term divided by 3, if we do, they are

1, 3, 7, 5, 31, 1, 127, 17, 73, 11, 2047, 13, 8191, 43, 151, 257, 131071, 19, 524287, 41, 337, 683, 8388607, 241, 1082401, 2731, 262657, 3277, 536870911, 331, ... 
 

The numbers n which Φn(2) is prime are

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 150, ... 
 

The numbers n which 2n - 1 has an only primitive prime factor are

2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, 49, 54, 56, 61, 62, 65, 69, 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 98, 107, 120, 122, 126, 127, 129, 133, 145, 147, 150, ...  (Differ from last sequence, this sequence does not have the term 6, but has the terms 18, 20, 21, 54, 147, 342, 602, and 889, and it is conjectured that no others)
 

Mersenne numbers in nature and elsewhere
In computer science, unsigned n-bit integers can be used to express numbers up to Mn. Signed  integers can express values between  and Mn, using the two's complement representation.
In the mathematical problem Tower of Hanoi, solving a puzzle with an n-disc tower requires Mn steps, assuming no mistakes are made.84
The asteroid with minor planet number 8191 is named 8191 Mersenne after Marin Mersenne, because 8191 is a Mersenne prime (3 Juno, 7 Iris, 31 Euphrosyne and 127 Johanna having been discovered and named during the 19th century).85
Mersenne-Fermat primes
A Mersenne-Fermat number is defined as , with p prime, r natural number, and can be written as MF(p, r), when , it is a Mersenne number, and when , it is a Fermat number, the only known Mersenne-Fermat prime with  are

MF(2, 2), MF(3, 2), MF(7, 2), MF(59, 2), MF(2, 3), MF(3, 3), MF(2, 4), and MF(2, 5).86


In fact,  Φpr (2)}}, where Φ is the cyclotomic polynomial.
Generalizations
It is natural to try to generalize primes of the form 
 
 
 
  to primes of the form 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  (and 
 
 
 
 ). However (see also theorems above), 
 
 
 
  is always divisible by 
 
 
 
 , so unless 
 
 
 
  is a unit, the former is not a prime. There are two ways to deal with that:
Gaussian Mersenne primes
In the ring of integers, if 
 
 
 
  is a unit, then 
 
 
 
  is either 2 or 0. But 
 
 
 
  are the usual Mersenne primes, and the formula 
 
 
 
  does not lead to anything interesting. However, if we regard instead the ring of Gaussian integers, we get the case 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and can ask (WLOG) for what 
 
 
 
  the number


 
  is a Gaussian prime which will then be called a Gaussian Mersenne prime.87

 
  is a Gaussian prime for exponents 
 
 
 
  in 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 19, 29, 47, 73, 79, 113, 151, 157, 163, 167, 239, 241, 283, 353, 367, 379, 457, 997, 1367, 3041, ... . This sequence is in many ways similar to the list of exponents of ordinary Mersenne primes.
The norms (i.e. squares of absolute values) of these Gaussian primes are rational primes 5, 13, 41, 113, 2113, 525313, ... .
Repunit primes
The other way to deal with the fact that 
 
 
 
  is always divisible by 
 
 
 
 , the integer b can be either positive or negative, but b is not a perfect power, it is to simply take out this factor and ask which n makes


 
  to be a prime.88 If for example we take 
 
 
 
 , we get 
 
 
 
  values of 2, 19, 23, 317, 1031, 49081, 86453, 109297, 270343, ... , corresponding to primes 11, 1111111111111111111, 11111111111111111111111, ... . These primes are called repunit primes. Another example is when we take 
 
 
 
 , we get 
 
 
 
  values of 2, 5, 11, 109, 193, 1483, 11353, 21419, 21911, 24071, 106859, 139739, ... . It is a conjecture that there are infinitely many 
 
 
 
  values of every integer 
 
 
 
  which is not a perfect power.
The least n such that 
 
 
 
  is prime are (start with b = 2)

2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 2, 17, 2, 5, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 19, 3, 3, 2, 5, 3, 0, 7, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 0, 3, 13, 313, 2, 13, 3, 349, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 19, 2, 127, 19, 0, 3, 4229, 2, 11, 3, 17, 7, 3, 2, 3, 2, 7, 3, 5, 0, 19, 2, 19, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, ...
 

For negative base b, they are (start with b = -2)

3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 7, 2, 17, 2, 3, 3, 11, 2, 3, 11, 0, 3, 7, 2, 109, 2, 5, 3, 11, 31, 5, 2, 3, 53, 17, 2, 5, 2, 103, 7, 5, 2, 7, 1153, 3, 7, 21943, 2, 3, 37, 53, 3, 17, 2, 7, 2, 3, 0, 19, 7, 3, 2, 11, 3, 5, 2, ... , (but this OEIS sequence does not allow n = 2)
 

The least base b such that 
 
 
 
  is prime are

2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 10, 6, 2, 61, 14, 15, 5, 24, 19, 2, 46, 3, 11, 22, 41, 2, 12, 22, 3, 2, 12, 86, 2, 7, 13, 11, 5, 29, 56, 30, 44, 60, 304, 5, 74, 118, 33, 156, 46, 183, 72, 606, 602, 223, 115, 37, 52, 104, 41, 6, 338, 217, ... 
 

For negative bases b, they are

3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 16, 61, 2, 6, 10, 6, 2, 5, 46, 18, 2, 49, 16, 70, 2, 5, 6, 12, 92, 2, 48, 89, 30, 16, 147, 19, 19, 2, 16, 11, 289, 2, 12, 52, 2, 66, 9, 22, 5, 489, 69, 137, 16, 36, 96, 76, 117, 26, 3, ... 
 

Another generized Mersenne number is


 
  with a, b any coprime integers, a > 1, -a (b+1)^n-b^n
Is a difference of two perfect nth powers, and if an - bn is prime, than a must be b + 1 or b - 1, because it is divisible by a - b.
The least n such that 
 
 
 
  is prime are

2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 3, 2, 17, 3, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 2, 2, 229, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 7, 2, 3, 37, 2, 3, 5, 58543, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 4663, 54517, 17, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 47, 61, 19, ... 
 

The least b such that 
 
 
 
  is prime are

1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 39, 6, 4, 12, 2, 2, 1, 6, 17, 46, 7, 5, 1, 25, 2, 41, 1, 12, 7, 1, 7, 327, 7, 8, 44, 26, 12, 75, 14, 51, 110, 4, 14, 49, 286, 15, 4, 39, 22, 109, 367, 22, 67, 27, 95, 80, 149, 2, 142, ...
