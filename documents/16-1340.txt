   Beam and Warming scheme      Beam and Warming scheme  In num erical mathematics, '''Beam and Warming scheme ''' or Beam–Warming implicit scheme introduced in 1978 by Richard M. Beam and R. F. Warming, 1 2 is a second order accurate implicit scheme , mainly used for solving non-linear hyperbolic equation. It is not used much nowadays.  Introduction  This scheme is spatially factored,non iterative, ADI scheme and uses Euler implicit to perform the time Integration. The algorithm is an delta-form , linearized through implementation of a Taylor-series . Hence Observed as increments of the conserved variables. In this an efficient factored algorithm is obtained by are evaluating the spatial cross derivatives explicitly. This allows for direct derivation of scheme and efficient solution using this computational algorithm. The efficiency is because although it is three-time-level scheme,but requires only two time levels of data storage. This results in unconditional stability. It is centered and needs the artificial dissipation operator to guarantee numerical stability. 3  The delta form of equation produced has an advantage property of steady state (if existing) independent of the size of the time step. 4  The method  Consider the inviscid Burgers' equation in one dimension         ∂  u    ∂  t    =   -   u    ∂  u    ∂  x         with  x   ∈  R      formulae-sequence        u     t        u      u     x           with  x   R     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\quad\text{with }%

This is done to keep the solution under control and maintain convergence of the solution.      D  =   -    ϵ  e    (       u   i  +  2   n   -   4   u   i  +  1   n     +   6   u  i  n     -   4   i  -  1   n    +   u   i  -  2   n    )         D       subscript  ϵ  e            subscript   superscript  u  n     i  2      4   subscript   superscript  u  n     i  1        6   subscript   superscript  u  n   i      subscript   superscript  4  n     i  1      subscript   superscript  u  n     i  2         D=-\epsilon_{e}(u^{n}_{i+2}-4u^{n}_{i+1}+6u^{n}_{i}-4^{n}_{i-1}+u^{n}_{i-2})     This term is added explicitly at level   n   n   n   to the right hand side. This is always used for successful computation where high-frequent oscillations are observed and must be suppressed.  Smoothing term  If only the stable solution is required, then in the equation to the right hand side a second-order smoothing term is added on the implicit layer. The other term in the same equation can be second-order because it has no influence on the stable solution if        ∇  n    (  U  )    =  0        superscript  normal-∇  n   U   0    \nabla^{n}(U)=0     The addition of smoothing term increases the number of steps required by three.  Properties  This scheme is produced by combining the trapezoidal formula, linearization, factoring, Padt spatial differencing, the homogeneous property of the flux vectors (where applicable), and hybrid spatial differencing and is most suitable for nonlinear systems in conservation-law form. ADI algorithm retains the order of accuracy and the steady-state property while reducing the bandwidth of the system of equations. 6 Stability of the equation is      L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   Stable under CFL      |  a  |   Δ  t   ≤   2  Δ  x           a   normal-Δ  t     2  normal-Δ  x     |a|\Delta t\leq 2\Delta x   The order of Truncation error is      O   (     (   Δ  t   )   2   +    (   Δ  x   )   2    )       O     superscript    normal-Δ  t   2    superscript    normal-Δ  x   2      O((\Delta t)^{2}+(\Delta x)^{2})   The result is smooth with considerable overshoot (that does not much grow with time).
