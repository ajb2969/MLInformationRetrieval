   Rational sequence topology      Rational sequence topology   In mathematics , more specifically general topology , the rational sequence topology is an example of a topology given to the set of real numbers , denoted R .  To give R a topology means to say which subsets of R are "open", and to do so in a way that the following axioms are met: 1   The union of open sets is an open set.  The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.  R and the empty set ∅ are open sets.   Construction  Let x be an irrational number (cf. rational number ). Take a sequence of rational numbers { x k } with the property that { x k } converges , with respect to the Euclidean topology , towards x as k tends towards infinity. Informally, this means that each of the numbers in the sequence get closer and closer to x as we progress further and further along the sequence.  The rational sequence topology is given by defining both the whole set R and the empty set ∅ to be open, defining each rational number singleton to be open, and using as a basis for the irrational number x , the sets 2         U  n    (  x  )    :=    {   x  k   :   n  ≤  k  <  ∞   }   ∪   {  x  }     .     assign     subscript  U  n   x      conditional-set   subscript  x  k       n  k            x      U_{n}(x):=\{x_{k}:n\leq k<\infty\}\cup\{x\}.
