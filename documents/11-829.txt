   2-methylcitrate synthase      2-methylcitrate synthase   In enzymology , a 2-methylcitrate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   propanoyl-CoA + H 2 O + oxaloacetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (2R,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate + CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are propanoyl-CoA , H 2 O , and oxaloacetate , whereas its two products are (2R,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is propanoyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-propanoyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, 1-carboxyethyl-forming) . Other names in common use include 2-methylcitrate oxaloacetate-lyase , MCS , methylcitrate synthase , and methylcitrate synthetase . This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism .
