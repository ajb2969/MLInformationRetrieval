Proof without words

In mathematics, a proof without words is a proof of an identity or mathematical statement which can be demonstrated as self-evident by a diagram without any accompanying explanatory text. Such proofs can be considered more elegant than more formal and mathematically rigorous proofs due to their self-evident nature.1 When the diagram demonstrates a particular case of a general statement, to be a proof, it must be generalisable.2
Examples
Sum of odd numbers
 The statement that the sum of all positive odd numbers up to 2n − 1 is a perfect square—more specifically, the perfect square n2—can be demonstrated by a proof without words, as shown on the right.3 The first square is formed by 1 block; 1 is the first square. The next strip, made of white squares, shows how adding 3 more blocks makes another square: four. The next strip, made of black squares, shows how adding 5 more blocks makes the next square. This process can be continued indefinitely.
Pythagorean theorem
 The Pythagorean theorem can be proven without words as shown in the second diagram on left. The two different methods for determining the area of the large square give the relation


 
  between the sides. This proof is more subtle than the above, but still can be considered a proof without words.4
Jensen's inequality
 Jensen's inequality can also be proven graphically, as illustrated on the third diagram. The dashed curve along the X axis is the hypothetical distribution of X, while the dashed curve along the Y axis is the corresponding distribution of Y values. Note that the convex mapping Y(X) increasingly "stretches" the distribution for increasing values of X.5
Usage
Mathematics Magazine, College Mathematics Journal run a regular feature entitled "Proof without words" containing, as the title suggests, proofs without words.6 The Art of Problem Solving and USAMTS websites run Java applets illustrating proofs without words.78
