   Hydrogen cycle      Hydrogen cycle  [[Anaerobic fermentation]] of organic substances to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]] is a collaborative effort involving many different biochemical reactions, processes and species of [[microorganisms]]. One of these many processes that occur is termed "interspecies hydrogen transfer". This process has been described as integral to the [[symbiosis]] between certain methane-producing archaea ([[methanogens]]) and nonmethanogenic anaerobes. In this symbiosis, the nonmethanogenic anaerobes degrade the organic substance and produce -among other things- molecular hydrogen (H 2 ). T his hydrogen is then taken up by methanogens and converted to methane via methanogenesis . One important characteristic of interspecies hydrogen transfer is that the H 2 concentration in the microbial environment is very low. Maintaining a low hydrogen concentration is important because the anaerobic fermentative process becomes increasingly thermodynamically unfavorable as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases. A key difference compared to other biogeochemical cycles is that because of its low molecular weight hydrogen can leave Earth's atmosphere. It has been suggested that this occurred on a grand scale in the past and that this is why today the Earth is mostly irreversibly oxidised . 1  Relevance for the Global Climate  H 2 is a trace, secondary greenhouse gas that interferes with the removal of methane. H 2 interacts with hydroxyl radicals (•OH), reducing them to H 2 O (water). •OH radicals that would typically oxidize methane in the following reaction are removed if they first interact with H 2 in the atmosphere.

The largest sources of environmental H 2 are the atmospheric photochemical process of hydrocarbon dissociation and microbial H 2 production. Biological processes are the dominant sink for atmospheric H 2 illustrating that overall the most important physiological role of H 2 is as a biological fuel. Within microbial environments cellular processes which result in H 2 production are nearly always linked with either inter or intracellular H 2 uptake. 2  Terrestrial Biosphere   Microbe-mediated soil uptake  Nitrogen-fixation by-products  Biomass Burning   Oceans  Anthropogenic   Fossil Fuel & Industrial Output   Human Impact on H2 Cycle  See also   Hydrogen  Biogeochemical cycle  Hydrogen fuel cell  Streptomyces  Methane  Carbon cycle  Sulfur-iodine cycle   References  External links   A Lecture (archived Jun 7, 2008)   Bibliography   "Microbiology and Biochemistry of Strict Anaerobes Involved in Interspecies Hydrogen Transfer" by Jean-Pierre Bélaich; Mireille Bruschi; Jean-Louis Garcia; Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
