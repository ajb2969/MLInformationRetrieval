   Adapted process      Adapted process   In the study of stochastic processes , an adapted process (or non-anticipating process ) is one that cannot "see into the future". An informal interpretation 1 is that X is adapted if and only if, for every realisation and every n , X n is known at time n . The concept of an adapted process is essential, for instance, in the definition of the Itō integral , which only makes sense if the integrand is an adapted process.  Definition  Let       (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  ℙ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  ℙ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   be a probability space ;     I   I   I   be an index set with a total order   ≤     \leq   (often,   I   I   I   is   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   ,    ℕ  0     subscript  ℕ  0    \mathbb{N}_{0}   ,    [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   or    [  0  ,   +  ∞   )     0        [0,+\infty)   );       ℱ  ⋅   =    (   ℱ  i   )    i  ∈  I         subscript  ℱ  normal-⋅    subscript   subscript  ℱ  i     i  I      \mathcal{F}_{\cdot}=\left(\mathcal{F}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}   be a filtration of the sigma algebra    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   ;      (  S  ,  Σ  )     S  normal-Σ    (S,\Sigma)   be a measurable space , the state space ;      X  :    I  ×  Ω   →  S      normal-:  X   normal-→    I  normal-Ω   S     X:I\times\Omega\to S   be a stochastic process .   The process   X   X   X   is said to be adapted to the filtration      (   ℱ  i   )    i  ∈  I      subscript   subscript  ℱ  i     i  I     \left(\mathcal{F}_{i}\right)_{i\in I}   if the random variable      X  i   :   Ω  →  S      normal-:   subscript  X  i    normal-→  normal-Ω  S     X_{i}:\Omega\to S   is a    (   ℱ  i   ,  Σ  )      subscript  ℱ  i   normal-Σ    (\mathcal{F}_{i},\Sigma)   - measurable function for each    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   . 2  Examples  Consider a stochastic process X : [0, T ] × Ω → R , and equip the real line  R with its usual Borel sigma algebra generated by the open sets .   If we take the natural filtration  F • X , where F t X is the σ -algebra generated by the pre-images for Borel subsets B of R and times 0 ≤ s ≤ t , then X is automatically F • X -adapted. Intuitively, the natural filtration F • X contains "total information" about the behaviour of X up to time t .    This offers a simple example of a non-adapted process : set F t to be the trivial σ -algebra {∅, Ω} for times 0 ≤ t  t = F t X for times . Since the only way that a function can be measurable with respect to the trivial σ -algebra is to be constant, any process X that is non-constant on [0, 1] will fail to be F • -adapted. The non-constant nature of such a process "uses information" from the more refined "future" σ -algebras F t , .
