Join (topology)

 In topology, a field of mathematics, the join of two topological spaces A and B, often denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is defined to be the quotient space


 
  where I is the interval [0, 1] and R is the equivalence relation generated by





 
  At the endpoints, this collapses 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
Intuitively, 
 
 
 
  is formed by taking the disjoint union of the two spaces and attaching a line segment joining every point in A to every point in B.
Properties

The join is homeomorphic to sum of cartesian products of cones over spaces and spaces itself, where sum is taken over cartesian product of spaces:





Given basepointed CW complexes (A,a0) and (B,b0), the "reduced join"



 
  is homeomorphic to the reduced suspension


 
  of the smash product. Consequently, since 
 
 
 
  is contractible, there is a homotopy equivalence



Examples

The join of subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space A and B is homotopy equivalent to the space of paths in n-dimensional Euclidean space, beginning in A and ending in B.
The join of a space X with a one-point space is called the cone CX of X.
The join of a space X with 
 
 
 
  (the 0-dimensional sphere, or, the discrete space with two points) is called the suspension

 
  of X.
The join of the spheres 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the sphere 
 
 
 
 .
