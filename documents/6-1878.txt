   Join (topology)      Join (topology)   In topology , a field of mathematics , the join of two topological spaces  A and B , often denoted by    A  ⋆  B     normal-⋆  A  B    A\star B   , is defined to be the quotient space        (   A  ×  B  ×  I   )   /  R   ,        A  B  I   R    (A\times B\times I)/R,\,   where I is the interval [0, 1] and R is the equivalence relation generated by         (  a  ,   b  1   ,  0  )   ∼   (  a  ,   b  2   ,  0  )       for all  a   ∈   A  and   b  1     ,    b  2   ∈  B     ,     formulae-sequence   similar-to   a   subscript  b  1   0    a   subscript  b  2   0     formulae-sequence      for all  a     A  and   subscript  b  1        subscript  b  2   B      (a,b_{1},0)\sim(a,b_{2},0)\quad\mbox{for all }a\in A\mbox{ and }b_{1},b_{2}\in
 B,            (   a  1   ,  b  ,  1  )   ∼    (   a  2   ,  b  ,  1  )    for all   a  1      ,    a  2   ∈   A  and  b   ∈  B    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to    subscript  a  1   b  1      subscript  a  2   b  1     for all   subscript  a  1           subscript  a  2     A  and  b        B      (a_{1},b,1)\sim(a_{2},b,1)\quad\mbox{for all }a_{1},a_{2}\in A\mbox{ and }b\in
 B.   At the endpoints, this collapses    A  ×  B  ×   {  0  }       A  B   0     A\times B\times\{0\}   to   A   A   A   and    A  ×  B  ×   {  1  }       A  B   1     A\times B\times\{1\}   to   B   B   B   .  Intuitively,    A  ⋆  B     normal-⋆  A  B    A\star B   is formed by taking the disjoint union of the two spaces and attaching a line segment joining every point in A to every point in B .  Properties   The join is homeomorphic to sum of cartesian products of cones over spaces and spaces itself, where sum is taken over cartesian product of spaces:         A  ⋆  B   ≅     C   (  A  )    ×  B    ∪   A  ×  B      C   (  B  )    ×  A     .       normal-⋆  A  B     subscript     A  B        C  A   B       C  B   A      A\star B\cong C(A)\times B\cup_{A\times B}C(B)\times A.      Given basepointed CW complexes ( A , a 0 ) and ( B , b 0 ), the "reduced join"        A  ⋆  B     A  ⋆   {   b  0   }    ∪    {   a  0   }   ⋆  B         normal-⋆  A  B      normal-⋆  A    subscript  b  0      normal-⋆    subscript  a  0    B      \frac{A\star B}{A\star\{b_{0}\}\cup\{a_{0}\}\star B}   is homeomorphic to the reduced suspension      Σ   (   A  ∧  B   )       normal-Σ    A  B     \Sigma(A\wedge B)   of the smash product . Consequently, since     A  ⋆   {   b  0   }    ∪    {   a  0   }   ⋆  B        normal-⋆  A    subscript  b  0      normal-⋆    subscript  a  0    B     {A\star\{b_{0}\}\cup\{a_{0}\}\star B}   is contractible, there is a homotopy equivalence        A  ⋆  B   ≃   Σ   (   A  ∧  B   )     .     similar-to-or-equals   normal-⋆  A  B     normal-Σ    A  B      A\star B\simeq\Sigma(A\wedge B).     Examples   The join of subsets of n -dimensional Euclidean space A and B is homotopy equivalent to the space of paths in n -dimensional Euclidean space , beginning in A and ending in B .  The join of a space X with a one-point space is called the cone  CX of X .  The join of a space X with    S  0     superscript  S  0    S^{0}   (the 0-dimensional sphere , or, the discrete space with two points) is called the suspension     S  X      S  X    SX   of X .  The join of the spheres    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   and    S  m     superscript  S  m    S^{m}   is the sphere    S   n  +  m  +  1      superscript  S    n  m  1     S^{n+m+1}   .
