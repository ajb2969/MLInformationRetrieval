   Babel function      Babel function   The Babel function (also known as cumulative coherence ) measures the maximum total coherence between a fixed atom and a collection of other atoms in a dictionary .  Definition and formulation  The Babel function of a dictionary   𝑨   𝑨   \boldsymbol{A}   with normalized columns is a real-valued function that is defined as         μ   (  p  )    =    max    |  λ  |   =  p     {    max   j  ∉  λ     {    ∑   i  ∈  λ     |    𝒂  i  𝑻    𝒂  j    |    }    }          μ  p     subscript       λ   p      subscript     j  λ      subscript     i  λ         superscript   subscript  𝒂  i   𝑻    subscript  𝒂  j          \mu(p)=\max_{|\lambda|=p}\{\max_{j\notin\lambda}\{\sum_{i\in\lambda}{|%
 \boldsymbol{a}_{i}^{\boldsymbol{T}}\boldsymbol{a}_{j}|}\}\}        where    𝒂  k     subscript  𝒂  k    \boldsymbol{a}_{k}   are the columns (atoms) of the dictionary   𝑨   𝑨   \boldsymbol{A}   . 1 2  Special case  When p=1, the babel function is the mutual coherence .
