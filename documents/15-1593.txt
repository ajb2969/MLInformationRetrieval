   Glycerate 2-kinase      Glycerate 2-kinase   Glycerate 2-kinase (, D-glycerate-2-kinase , glycerate kinase (2-phosphoglycerate forming) , ATP:(R)-glycerate 2-phosphotransferase ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:D-glycerate 2-phosphotransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + D- glycerate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 2-phospho-D-glycerate   A key enzyme in the nonphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway in archaea .
