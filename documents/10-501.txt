   D-xylose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+)      D-xylose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a D-xylose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-xylose + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-xylono-1,5-lactone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-xylose and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are D-xylono-1,5-lactone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-xylose:NADP + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-xylose (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , dehydrogenase , D-xylose-NADP + dehydrogenase , D-xylose:NADP + oxidoreductase , and D-xylose 1-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) .
