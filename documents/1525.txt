The green points are sampled from a distribution with high concentration and high correlation (     κ  1   =   κ  2   =  200         subscript  κ  1    subscript  κ  2        200     \kappa_{1}=\kappa_{2}=200   ,     κ  3   =  0       subscript  κ  3   0    \kappa_{3}=0   ), the blue points are sampled from a distribution with high concentration and negative correlation (     κ  1   =   κ  2   =  200         subscript  κ  1    subscript  κ  2        200     \kappa_{1}=\kappa_{2}=200   ,     κ  3   =  100       subscript  κ  3   100    \kappa_{3}=100   ), and the red points are sampled from a distribution with low concentration and no correlation (      κ  1   =   κ  2   =  20   ,    κ  3   =  0      formulae-sequence       subscript  κ  1    subscript  κ  2        20       subscript  κ  3   0     \kappa_{1}=\kappa_{2}=20,\kappa_{3}=0   ).   In probability theory and statistics , the bivariate von Mises distribution is a probability distribution describing values on a torus . It may be thought of as an analogue on the torus of the bivariate normal distribution . The distribution belongs to the field of directional statistics . The general bivariate von Mises distribution was first proposed by Kanti Mardia in 1975. 1 2 One of its variants is today used in the field of bioinformatics to formulate a probabilistic model of protein structure in atomic detail. 3 4  Definition  The bivariate von Mises distribution is a probability distribution defined on the torus ,     S  1   ×   S  1        superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1     S^{1}\times S^{1}   in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   . The probability density function of the general bivariate von Mises distribution for the angles     ϕ  ,  ψ   ∈   [  0  ,   2  π   ]        ϕ  ψ    0    2  π      \phi,\psi\in[0,2\pi]   is given by 5        f   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )    ∝   exp   [     κ  1    cos   (   ϕ  -  μ   )     +    κ  2    cos   (   ψ  -  ν   )     +    (   cos   (   ϕ  -  μ   )    ,   sin   (   ϕ  -  μ   )    )   𝐀    (   cos   (   ψ  -  ν   )    ,   sin   (   ψ  -  ν   )    )   T     ]     ,     proportional-to    f   ϕ  ψ           subscript  κ  1       ϕ  μ        subscript  κ  2       ψ  ν            ϕ  μ        ϕ  μ     𝐀   superscript       ψ  ν        ψ  ν     T        f(\phi,\psi)\propto\exp[\kappa_{1}\cos(\phi-\mu)+\kappa_{2}\cos(\psi-\nu)+(%
 \cos(\phi-\mu),\sin(\phi-\mu))\mathbf{A}(\cos(\psi-\nu),\sin(\psi-\nu))^{T}],     where   μ   μ   \mu   and   ν   ν   \nu   are the means for   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and   ψ   ψ   \psi   ,    κ  1     subscript  κ  1    \kappa_{1}   and    κ  2     subscript  κ  2    \kappa_{2}   their concentration and the matrix    𝐀  ∈   𝕄   (  2  ,  2  )        𝐀    𝕄   2  2      \mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{M}(2,2)   is related to their correlation.  Two commonly used variants of the bivariate von Mises distribution are the sine and cosine variant.  The cosine variant of the bivariate von Mises distribution 6 has the probability density function        f   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )    =    Z  c    (   κ  1   ,   κ  2   ,   κ  3   )    exp   [      κ  1    cos   (   ϕ  -  μ   )     +    κ  2    cos   (   ψ  -  ν   )      -    κ  3    cos   (    ϕ  -  μ  -  ψ   +  ν   )      ]      ,        f   ϕ  ψ       subscript  Z  c     subscript  κ  1    subscript  κ  2    subscript  κ  3             subscript  κ  1       ϕ  μ        subscript  κ  2       ψ  ν         subscript  κ  3         ϕ  μ  ψ   ν          f(\phi,\psi)=Z_{c}(\kappa_{1},\kappa_{2},\kappa_{3})\ \exp[\kappa_{1}\cos(\phi%
 -\mu)+\kappa_{2}\cos(\psi-\nu)-\kappa_{3}\cos(\phi-\mu-\psi+\nu)],     where   μ   μ   \mu   and   ν   ν   \nu   are the means for   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and   ψ   ψ   \psi   ,    κ  1     subscript  κ  1    \kappa_{1}   and    κ  2     subscript  κ  2    \kappa_{2}   their concentration and    κ  3     subscript  κ  3    \kappa_{3}   is related to their correlation.    Z  c     subscript  Z  c    Z_{c}   is the normalization constant. This distribution with    κ  3     subscript  κ  3    \kappa_{3}   =0 has been used for kernel density estimates of the distribution of the protein dihedral angles   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   and   ψ   ψ   \psi   . 7  The sine variant has the probability density function 8        f   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )    =    Z  s    (   κ  1   ,   κ  2   ,   κ  3   )    exp   [     κ  1    cos   (   ϕ  -  μ   )     +    κ  2    cos   (   ψ  -  ν   )     +    κ  3    sin   (   ϕ  -  μ   )     sin   (   ψ  -  ν   )      ]      ,        f   ϕ  ψ       subscript  Z  s     subscript  κ  1    subscript  κ  2    subscript  κ  3           subscript  κ  1       ϕ  μ        subscript  κ  2       ψ  ν        subscript  κ  3       ϕ  μ        ψ  ν          f(\phi,\psi)=Z_{s}(\kappa_{1},\kappa_{2},\kappa_{3})\ \exp[\kappa_{1}\cos(\phi%
 -\mu)+\kappa_{2}\cos(\psi-\nu)+\kappa_{3}\sin(\phi-\mu)\sin(\psi-\nu)],     where the parameters have the same interpretation.
