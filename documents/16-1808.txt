   Bhattacharyya angle      Bhattacharyya angle   In statistics, Bhattacharyya angle , also called statistical angle , is a measure of distance between two probability measures defined on a finite probability space. It is defined as       Δ   (  p  ,  q  )    =   arccos   BC   (  p  ,  q  )           normal-Δ   p  q        BC  p  q      \Delta(p,q)=\arccos\operatorname{BC}(p,q)     where p i , q i are the probabilities assigned to the point i , for i = 1, ..., n , and       BC   (  p  ,  q  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n      p  i    q  i           BC  p  q     superscript   subscript     i  1    n        subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i        \operatorname{BC}(p,q)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{p_{i}q_{i}}     is the Bhattacharya coefficient . 1  The Bhattacharya distance is the geodesic distance in the orthant of the sphere    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   obtained by projecting the probability simplex on the sphere by the transformation      p  i   ↦    p  i     ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence   maps-to   subscript  p  i      subscript  p  i       i   1  normal-…  n      p_{i}\mapsto\sqrt{p_{i}},\ i=1,\ldots,n   .  This distance is compatible with Fisher metric . It is also related to Bures distance and fidelity between quantum states as for two diagonal states one has        Δ   (  ρ  ,  σ  )    =   arccos    F   (  ρ  ,  σ  )       .        normal-Δ   ρ  σ          F   ρ  σ        \Delta(\rho,\sigma)=\arccos\sqrt{F(\rho,\sigma)}.
