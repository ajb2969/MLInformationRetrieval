Bhattacharyya angle

In statistics, Bhattacharyya angle, also called statistical angle, is a measure of distance between two probability measures defined on a finite probability space. It is defined as



where pi, qi are the probabilities assigned to the point i, for i = 1, ..., n, and



is the Bhattacharya coefficient.1
The Bhattacharya distance is the geodesic distance in the orthant of the sphere 
 
 
 
  obtained by projecting the probability simplex on the sphere by the transformation 
 
 
 
 .
This distance is compatible with Fisher metric. It is also related to Bures distance and fidelity between quantum states as for two diagonal states one has
