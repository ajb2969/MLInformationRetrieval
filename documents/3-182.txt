   Sherwood number      Sherwood number   The Sherwood number ( Sh ) (also called the mass transfer Nusselt number ) is a dimensionless number used in mass-transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the total rate of mass transfer to the rate of diffusive mass transport alone, 1 and is named in honor of Thomas Kilgore Sherwood .  It is defined as follows      Sh  =    K  L   D   =   Mass transfer rate  Diffusion rate         Sh      K  L   D          Mass transfer rate  Diffusion rate      \mathrm{Sh}=\frac{KL}{D}=\frac{\mbox{Mass transfer rate}}{\mbox{Diffusion rate}}     where   L is a characteristic length (m)  D is mass diffusivity (m 2 .s −1 )  K is the mass transfer coefficient (m .s −1 )   Using dimensional analysis, it can also be further defined as a function of the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers:      Sh  =   f   (  Re  ,  Sc  )        Sh    f   Re  Sc      \mathrm{Sh}=f(\mathrm{Re},\mathrm{Sc})     For example, for a single sphere it can be expressed as:      Sh  =    Sh  0   +    C     Re  m     Sc   1  3          Sh     subscript  Sh  0     C   superscript  Re  m    superscript  Sc    1  3        \mathrm{Sh}=\mathrm{Sh}_{0}+C\,\mathrm{Re}^{m}\,\mathrm{Sc}^{\frac{1}{3}}     where    Sh  0     subscript  Sh  0    \mathrm{Sh}_{0}   is the Sherwood number due only to natural convection and not forced convection.  A more specific correlation, the Froessling equation:      Sh  =   2  +    0.552     Re   1  2      Sc   1  3          Sh    2    0.552   superscript  Re    1  2     superscript  Sc    1  3        \mathrm{Sh}=2+0.552\,\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{1}{2}}\,\mathrm{Sc}^{\frac{1}{3}}     This form is particularly valuable to chemical engineers in situations where the Reynolds number and Schmidt number are readily available. Since Re and Sc are both dimensionless numbers, the Sherwood number is also dimensionless.  These correlations are the mass transfer analogs to heat transfer correlations of the Nusselt number in terms of the Reynolds number and Prandtl number . For a correlation for a given geometry (e.g. spheres, plates, cylinders, etc.), a heat transfer correlation (often more readily available from literature and experimental work, and easier to determine) for the Nusselt number (Nu) in terms of the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr) can be used as a mass transfer correlation by replacing the Prandtl number with the analogous dimensionless number for mass transfer, the Schmidt number , and replacing the Nusselt number with the analogous dimensionless number for mass transfer, the Sherwood number.  As an example, a heat transfer correlation for spheres is given by the Ranz-Marshall Correlation:        Nu  =   2  +    0.6     Re   1  2      Pr   1  3       ,   0  ≤  Re  <  200    ,   0  ≤  Pr  <  250      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence    Nu    2    0.6   superscript  Re    1  2     superscript  Pr    1  3           0  Re       200         0  Pr       250      \mathrm{Nu}=2+0.6\,\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{1}{2}}\,\mathrm{Pr}^{\frac{1}{3}},~{}0%
 \leq~{}\mathrm{Re}<200,~{}0\leq\mathrm{Pr}<250     This correlation can be made into a mass transfer correlation using the above procedure, which yields:        Sh  =   2  +    0.6     Re   1  2      Sc   1  3       ,   0  ≤  Re  <  200    ,   0  ≤  Sc  <  250      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence    Sh    2    0.6   superscript  Re    1  2     superscript  Sc    1  3           0  Re       200         0  Sc       250      \mathrm{Sh}=2+0.6\,\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{1}{2}}\,\mathrm{Sc}^{\frac{1}{3}},~{}0%
 \leq~{}\mathrm{Re}<200,~{}0\leq\mathrm{Sc}<250     This is a very concrete way of demonstrating the analogies between different forms of transport phenomena .
