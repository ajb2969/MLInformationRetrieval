   Frostman lemma      Frostman lemma   In mathematics , and more specifically, in the theory of fractal dimensions , Frostman's lemma provides a convenient tool for estimating the Hausdorff dimension of sets.  Lemma: Let A be a Borel subset of R n , and let s > 0. Then the following are equivalent:   H s ( A ) > 0, where H s denotes the s -dimensional Hausdorff measure .  There is an (unsigned) Borel measure  μ satisfying μ ( A ) > 0, and such that          μ   (   B   (  x  ,  r  )    )    ≤   r  s         μ    B   x  r      superscript  r  s     \mu(B(x,r))\leq r^{s}       holds for all x ∈ R n and r >0.   Otto Frostman proved this lemma for closed sets A as part of his PhD dissertation at Lund University in 1935. The generalization to Borel sets is more involved, and requires the theory of Suslin sets .  A useful corollary of Frostman's lemma requires the notions of the s -capacity of a Borel set A ⊂ R n , which is defined by         C  s    (  A  )    :=   sup   {    (    ∫   A  ×  A      d  μ   (  x  )   d  μ   (  y  )      |   x  -  y   |   s     )    -  1    :    μ  is a Borel measure and  μ   (  A  )    =  1   }     .     assign     subscript  C  s   A    supremum   conditional-set   superscript    subscript     A  A        d  μ  x  d  μ  y    superscript      x  y    s       1        μ  is a Borel measure and  μ  A   1       C_{s}(A):=\sup\Bigl\{\Bigl(\int_{A\times A}\frac{d\mu(x)\,d\mu(y)}{|x-y|^{s}}%
 \Bigr)^{-1}:\mu\text{ is a Borel measure and }\mu(A)=1\Bigr\}.     (Here, we take inf ∅ = ∞ and  = 0. As before, the measure   μ   μ   \mu   is unsigned.) It follows from Frostman's lemma that for Borel A ⊂ R n         dim  H    (  A  )    =   sup   {   s  ≥  0   :     C  s    (  A  )    >  0   }     .         subscript  dim  H   A    supremum   conditional-set    s  0        subscript  C  s   A   0       \mathrm{dim}_{H}(A)=\sup\{s\geq 0:C_{s}(A)>0\}.
