Cytokinin 7-beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a cytokinin 7-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + N6-alkylaminopurine 
 
 
 
  UDP + N6-alkylaminopurine-7-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and N6-alkylaminopurine, whereas its two products are UDP and N6-alkylaminopurine-7-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:zeatin 7-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-zeatin 7-glucosyltransferase, and cytokinin 7-glucosyltransferase.
