   E6 (mathematics)      E6 (mathematics)     In mathematics , E 6 is the name of some closely related Lie groups , linear algebraic groups or their Lie algebras     ùî¢  6     subscript  ùî¢  6    \mathfrak{e}_{6}   , all of which have dimension 78; the same notation E 6 is used for the corresponding root lattice , which has rank 6. The designation E 6 comes from the Cartan‚ÄìKilling classification of the complex simple Lie algebras (see ). This classifies Lie algebras into four infinite series labeled A n , B n , C n , D n , and five exceptional cases labeled E 6 , E 7 , E 8 , F 4 , and G 2 . The E 6 algebra is thus one of the five exceptional cases.  The fundamental group of the complex form, compact real form, or any algebraic version of E 6 is the cyclic group  Z /3 Z , and its outer automorphism group is the cyclic group Z /2 Z . Its fundamental representation is 27-dimensional (complex), and a basis is given by the 27 lines on a cubic surface . The dual representation , which is inequivalent, is also 27-dimensional.  In particle physics , E 6 plays a role in some grand unified theories .  Real and complex forms  There is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E 6 , corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 78. The complex adjoint Lie group E 6 of complex dimension 78 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 156. This has fundamental group Z /3 Z , has maximal compact subgroup the compact form (see below) of E 6 , and has an outer automorphism group non-cyclic of order 4 generated by complex conjugation and by the outer automorphism which already exists as a complex automorphism.  As well as the complex Lie group of type E 6 , there are five real forms of the Lie algebra, and correspondingly five real forms of the group with trivial center (all of which have an algebraic double cover, and three of which have further non-algebraic covers, giving further real forms), all of real dimension 78, as follows:   The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which has fundamental group Z /3 Z and outer automorphism group Z /2 Z .  The split form, EI (or E 6(6) ), which has maximal compact subgroup Sp(4)/(¬±1), fundamental group of order 2 and outer automorphism group of order 2.  The quasi-split form EII (or E 6(2) ), which has maximal compact subgroup SU(2) √ó SU(6)/(center), fundamental group cyclic of order 6 and outer automorphism group of order 2.  EIII (or E 6(-14) ), which has maximal compact subgroup SO(2) √ó Spin(10)/(center), fundamental group Z and trivial outer automorphism group.  EIV (or E 6(-26) ), which has maximal compact subgroup F 4 , trivial fundamental group cyclic and outer automorphism group of order 2.   The EIV form of E 6 is the group of collineations (line-preserving transformations) of the octonionic projective plane  OP 2 . 1 It is also the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of the exceptional Jordan algebra . The exceptional Jordan algebra is 27-dimensional, which explains why the compact real form of E 6 has a 27-dimensional complex representation. The compact real form of E 6 is the isometry group of a 32-dimensional Riemannian manifold known as the 'bioctonionic projective plane'; similar constructions for E 7 and E 8 are known as the Rosenfeld projective planes , and are part of the Freudenthal magic square .  E 6 as an algebraic group  By means of a Chevalley basis for the Lie algebra, one can define E 6 as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù) adjoint form of E 6 . Over an algebraically closed field, this and its triple cover are the only forms; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or ‚Äútwists‚Äù of E 6 , which are classified in the general framework of Galois cohomology (over a perfect field  k ) by the set H 1 ( k , Aut(E 6 )) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E 6 (see below ) has automorphism group Z /2 Z , maps to H 1 ( k , Z /2 Z ) = Hom (Gal( k ), Z /2 Z ) with kernel H 1 ( k , E 6,ad ). 2  Over the field of real numbers, the real component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E 6 coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned above , but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all adjoint forms of E 6 have fundamental group Z /3 Z in the sense of algebraic geometry, with Galois action as on the third roots of unity; this means that they admit exactly one triple cover (which may be trivial on the real points); the further non-compact real Lie group forms of E 6 are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations. The compact real form of E 6 as well as the noncompact forms EI=E 6(6) and EIV=E 6(-26) are said to be inner or of type 1 E 6 meaning that their class lies in H 1 ( k , E 6,ad ) or that complex conjugation induces the trivial automorphism on the Dynkin diagram, whereas the other two real forms are said to be outer or of type 2 E 6 .  Over finite fields, the Lang‚ÄìSteinberg theorem implies that H 1 ( k , E 6 ) = 0, meaning that E 6 has exactly one twisted form, known as 2 E 6 : see below .  Algebra  Dynkin diagram  The Dynkin diagram for E 6 is given by , which may also be drawn as  or .  Roots of E 6  (Figure)  The 72 vertices of the 1 22 polytope represent the root vectors of the E 6 , as shown in this Coxeter plane projection.  Coxeter-Dynkin diagram :   Although they span a six-dimensional space, it is much more symmetrical to consider them as vectors in a six-dimensional subspace of a nine-dimensional space.

Two 16-dimensional subalgebras that transform as a Weyl spinor of    spin   (  10  )      spin  10    \operatorname{spin}(10)   and its complex conjugate. These have a non-zero last entry.  1 generator which is their chirality generator, and is the sixth Cartan generator .   One choice of simple roots for E 6 is given by the rows of the following matrix, indexed in the order :      [     1     -  1     0    0    0    0      0    1     -  1     0    0    0      0    0    1     -  1     0    0      0    0    0    1    1    0       -   1  2       -   1  2       -   1  2       -   1  2       -   1  2        3   2       0    0    0    1     -  1     0     ]     delimited-[]    1    1   0  0  0  0    0  1    1   0  0  0    0  0  1    1   0  0    0  0  0  1  1  0        1  2        1  2        1  2        1  2        1  2        3   2     0  0  0  1    1   0      \left[\begin{smallmatrix}1&-1&0&0&0&0\\

Other maximal subalgebras which have an importance in physics (see below) and can be read off the Dynkin diagram, are the algebras of SO(10) √ó U(1) and SU(6) √ó SU(2).  In addition to the 78-dimensional adjoint representation, there are two dual 27-dimensional "vector" representations .  The characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula . The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are :   1 , 27 (twice), 78 , 351 (four times), 650 , 1728 (twice), 2430 , 2925 , 3003 (twice) , 5824 (twice) , 7371 (twice), 7722 (twice), 17550 (twice), 19305 (four times), 34398 (twice), 34749 , 43758 , 46332 (twice), 51975 (twice), 54054 (twice), 61425 (twice), 70070 , 78975 (twice) , 85293 , 100386 (twice), 105600 , 112320 (twice), 146432 (twice) , 252252 (twice) , 314496 (twice), 359424 (four times), 371800 (twice) , 386100 (twice), 393822 (twice), 412776 (twice), 442442 (twice) ‚Ä¶   The underlined terms in the sequence above are the dimensions of those irreducible representations possessed by the adjoint form of E 6 (equivalently, those whose weights belong to the root lattice of E 6 ), whereas the full sequence gives the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simply connected form of E 6 .  The symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of E 6 explains why many dimensions occur twice, the corresponding representations being related by the non-trivial outer automorphism; however, there are sometimes even more representations than this, such as four of dimension 351, two of which are fundamental and two of which are not.  The fundamental representations have dimensions 27, 351, 2925, 351, 27 and 78 (corresponding to the six nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order chosen for the Cartan matrix above, i.e., the nodes are read in the five-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the middle one).  E6 polytope  The E 6 polytope is the convex hull of the roots of E 6 . It therefore exists in 6 dimensions; its symmetry group contains the Coxeter group for E 6 as an index 2 subgroup.  Chevalley and Steinberg groups of type E 6 and 2 E 6  The groups of type E 6 over arbitrary fields (in particular finite fields) were introduced by .  The points over a finite field with q elements of the (split) algebraic group E 6 (see above ), whether of the adjoint (centerless) or simply connected form (its algebraic universal cover), give a finite Chevalley group . This is closely connected to the group written E 6 ( q ), however there is ambiguity in this notation, which can stand for several things:   the finite group consisting of the points over F q of the simply connected form of E 6 (for clarity, this can be written E 6,sc ( q ) or more rarely      E  ~   6    (  q  )        subscript   normal-~  E   6   q    \tilde{E}_{6}(q)   and is known as the "universal" Chevalley group of type E 6 over F q ),  (rarely) the finite group consisting of the points over F q of the adjoint form of E 6 (for clarity, this can be written E 6,ad ( q ), and is known as the "adjoint" Chevalley group of type E 6 over F q ), or  the finite group which is the image of the natural map from the former to the latter: this is what will be denoted by E 6 ( q ) in the following, as is most common in texts dealing with finite groups.   From the finite group perspective, the relation between these three groups, which is quite analogous to that between SL( n,q ), PGL( n,q ) and PSL( n,q ), can be summarized as follows: E 6 ( q ) is simple for any q , E 6,sc ( q ) is its Schur cover , and E 6,ad ( q ) lies in its automorphism group; furthermore, when q ‚àí1 is not divisible by 3, all three coincide, and otherwise (when q is congruent to 1 mod 3), the Schur multiplier of E 6 ( q ) is 3 and E 6 ( q ) is of index 3 in E 6,ad ( q ), which explains why E 6,sc ( q ) and E 6,ad ( q ) are often written as 3¬∑E 6 ( q ) and E 6 ( q )¬∑3. From the algebraic group perspective, it is less common for E 6 ( q ) to refer to the finite simple group, because the latter is not in a natural way the set of points of an algebraic group over F q unlike E 6,sc ( q ) and E 6,ad ( q ).  Beyond this ‚Äúsplit‚Äù (or ‚Äúuntwisted‚Äù) form of E 6 , there is also one other form of E 6 over the finite field F q , known as 2 E 6 , which is obtained by twisting by the non-trivial automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of E 6 . Concretely, 2 E 6 ( q ), which is known as a Steinberg group, can be seen as the subgroup of E 6 ( q 2 ) fixed by the composition of the non-trivial diagram automorphism and the non-trivial field automorphism of F q 2 . Twisting does not change the fact that the algebraic fundamental group of 2 E 6,ad is Z /3 Z , but it does change those q for which the covering of 2 E 6,ad by 2 E 6,sc is non-trivial on the F q -points. Precisely: 2 E 6,sc ( q ) is a covering of 2 E 6 ( q ), and 2 E 6,ad ( q ) lies in its automorphism group; when q +1 is not divisible by 3, all three coincide, and otherwise (when q is congruent to 2 mod 3), the degree of 2 E 6,sc ( q ) over 2 E 6 ( q ) is 3 and 2 E 6 ( q ) is of index 3 in 2 E 6,ad ( q ), which explains why 2 E 6,sc ( q ) and 2 E 6,ad ( q ) are often written as 3¬∑ 2 E 6 ( q ) and 2 E 6 ( q )¬∑3.  Two notational issues should be raised concerning the groups 2 E 6 ( q ). One is that this is sometimes written 2 E 6 ( q 2 ), a notation which has the advantage of transposing more easily to the Suzuki and Ree groups, but the disadvantage of deviating from the notation for the F q -points of an algebraic group. Another is that whereas 2 E 6,sc ( q ) and 2 E 6,ad ( q ) are the F q -points of an algebraic group, the group in question also depends on q (e.g., the points over F q 2 of the same group are the untwisted E 6,sc ( q 2 ) and E 6,ad ( q 2 )).  The groups E 6 ( q ) and 2 E 6 ( q ) are simple for any q , 4 5 and constitute two of the infinite families in the classification of finite simple groups . Their order is given by the following formula :       |    E  6    (  q  )    |   =    1   gcd   (  3  ,   q  -  1   )      q  36    (    q  12   -  1   )    (    q  9   -  1   )    (    q  8   -  1   )    (    q  6   -  1   )    (    q  5   -  1   )    (    q  2   -  1   )             subscript  E  6   q        1    gcd   3    q  1       superscript  q  36      superscript  q  12   1      superscript  q  9   1      superscript  q  8   1      superscript  q  6   1      superscript  q  5   1      superscript  q  2   1      |E_{6}(q)|=\frac{1}{\mathrm{gcd}(3,q-1)}q^{36}(q^{12}-1)(q^{9}-1)(q^{8}-1)(q^{%
 6}-1)(q^{5}-1)(q^{2}-1)          |    E  6     2    (  q  )    |   =    1   gcd   (  3  ,   q  +  1   )      q  36    (    q  12   -  1   )    (    q  9   +  1   )    (    q  8   -  1   )    (    q  6   -  1   )    (    q  5   +  1   )    (    q  2   -  1   )             superscript   subscript  E  6   2   q        1    gcd   3    q  1       superscript  q  36      superscript  q  12   1      superscript  q  9   1      superscript  q  8   1      superscript  q  6   1      superscript  q  5   1      superscript  q  2   1      |{}^{2}\!E_{6}(q)|=\frac{1}{\mathrm{gcd}(3,q+1)}q^{36}(q^{12}-1)(q^{9}+1)(q^{8%
 }-1)(q^{6}-1)(q^{5}+1)(q^{2}-1)   . The order of E 6,sc ( q ) or E 6,ad ( q ) (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(3, q ‚àí1) from the first formula , and the order of 2 E 6,sc ( q ) or 2 E 6,ad ( q ) (both are equal) can be obtained by removing the dividing factor gcd(3, q +1) from the second .  The Schur multiplier of E 6 ( q ) is always gcd(3, q ‚àí1) (i.e., E 6,sc ( q ) is its Schur cover). The Schur multiplier of 2 E 6 ( q ) is gcd(3, q +1) (i.e., 2 E 6,sc ( q ) is its Schur cover) outside of the exceptional case q =2 where it is 2 2 ¬∑3 (i.e., there is an additional 2 2 -fold cover). The outer automorphism group of E 6 ( q ) is the product of the diagonal automorphism group Z /gcd(3, q ‚àí1) Z (given by the action of E 6,ad ( q )), the group Z /2 Z of diagram automorphisms, and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order f if q = p f where p is prime). The outer automorphism group of 2 E 6 ( q ) is the product of the diagonal automorphism group Z /gcd(3, q +1) Z (given by the action of 2 E 6,ad ( q )) and the group of field automorphisms (i.e., cyclic of order f if q = p f where p is prime).  Importance in physics  (Figure)  The pattern of weak isospin , W, weaker isospin, W', strong g3 and g8, and baryon minus lepton, B, charges for particles in the SO(10)  Grand Unified Theory , rotated to show the embedding in E 6 .   N=8 supergravity in five dimensions, which is a dimensional reduction from 11 dimensional supergravity, admits an E 6 bosonic global symmetry and an Sp(8) bosonic local symmetry . The fermions are in representations of Sp(8), the gauge fields are in a representation of E 6 , and the scalars are in a representation of both (Gravitons are singlets with respect to both). Physical states are in representations of the coset E 6 /Sp(8).  In grand unification theories , E 6 appears as a possible gauge group which, after its breaking , gives rise to the SU(3) √ó SU(2) √ó U(1) gauge group of the standard model (also see Importance in physics of E8 ). One way of achieving this is through breaking to SO(10) √ó U(1). The adjoint 78 representation breaks, as explained above, into an adjoint 45, spinor 16 and    16  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  16    \bar{16}   as well as a singlet of the SO(10) subalgebra. Including the U(1) charge we have       78  ‚Üí     45  0   ‚äï   16   -  3    ‚äï    16  ¬Ø   3    +   1  0     .     normal-‚Üí  78     direct-sum   subscript  45  0    subscript  16    3     subscript   normal-¬Ø  16   3     subscript  1  0      78\rightarrow 45_{0}\oplus 16_{-3}\oplus\bar{16}_{3}+1_{0}.     Where the subscript denotes the U(1) charge.  See also   En (Lie algebra)  ADE classification  Freudenthal magic square   References    . Online HTML version at 1 .   .
