   Errera graph      Errera graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the Errera graph is a graph with 17 vertices and 45 edges discovered by Alfred Errera. 1 Published in 1921, it provides an example of how Kempe 's proof of the four color theorem cannot work. 2 3  Later, the Fritsch graph and Soifer graph provide two smaller counterexamples. 4  The Errera graph is planar and has chromatic number 4, chromatic index 6, radius 3, diameter 4 and girth 3. All its vertices are of degree 5 or 6 and it is a 5- vertex-connected graph and a 5- edge-connected graph .  Algebraic properties  The Errera graph is not a vertex-transitive graph and its full automorphism group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 20, the group of symmetries of a decagon , including both rotations and reflections.  The characteristic polynomial of the Errera graph is    -    (    x  2   -   2  x   -  5   )     (     x  2   +  x   -  1   )   2    (     x  3   -   4   x  2    -   9  x    +  10   )     (     x  4   +   2   x  3     -   7   x  2    -   18  x   -  9   )   2             superscript  x  2     2  x   5    superscript       superscript  x  2   x   1   2        superscript  x  3     4   superscript  x  2      9  x    10    superscript       superscript  x  4     2   superscript  x  3       7   superscript  x  2      18  x   9   2      -(x^{2}-2x-5)(x^{2}+x-1)^{2}(x^{3}-4x^{2}-9x+10)(x^{4}+2x^{3}-7x^{2}-18x-9)^{2}   .
