It was invented by Donald F. Hunt , Joshua Coon , John E. P. Syka and Jarrod Marto at the University of Virginia . 2  ETD fragmentation  ETD does not use free electrons but employs radical anions (e.g. anthracene or azobenzene ) for this purpose:         [   M  +   n  H    ]    n  +    +   A  -    →     [    [   M  +   n  H    ]     (   n  -  1   )   +    ]   *   +  A   →   f  r  a  g  m  e  n  t  s        normal-→     superscript   delimited-[]    M    n  H      limit-from  n      superscript  A        superscript   delimited-[]   superscript   delimited-[]    M    n  H      limit-from    n  1         A     normal-→      f  r  a  g  m  e  n  t  s      [M+nH]^{n+}+A^{-}\to\bigg[[M+nH]^{(n-1)+}\bigg]^{*}+A\to fragments   . 3  where A is the anion. ETD cleaves randomly along the peptide backbone (so called c and z ions) while side chains and modifications such as phosphorylation are left intact. The technique only works well for higher charge state ions (z>2), however relative to collision-induced dissociation (CID), ETD is advantageous for the fragmentation of longer peptides or even entire proteins. This makes the technique important for top-down proteomics .  Much like ECD, ETD is believed to be particularly effective for peptides with modifications such as phosphorylation. 4  See also   Negative electron-transfer dissociation  Tandem mass spectrometry  Electrospray   References  "  Category:Tandem mass spectrometry     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
