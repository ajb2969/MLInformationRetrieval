   Affine manifold      Affine manifold   In differential geometry , an affine manifold is a differentiable manifold equipped with a flat , torsion-free  connection .  Equivalently, it is a manifold that is (if connected) covered by an open subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    {\mathbb{R}}^{n}   , with monodromy acting by affine transformations . This equivalence is an easy corollary of Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem .  Equivalently, it is a manifold equipped with an atlas—called the affine structure —with all transition functions between charts affine (that is, have constant jacobian matrix); 1 two atlases are equivalent if the manifold admits an atlas subjugated to both, with transitions from both atlases to a smaller atlas being affine. A manifold having a distinguished affine structure is called an affine manifold and the charts which are affinely related to those of the affine structure are called affine charts . In each affine coordinate domain the coordinate vector fields form a parallelization of that domain, so there is an associated connection on each domain. These locally defined connections are the same on overlapping parts, so there is a unique connection associated with an affine structure. Note there is a link between linear  connection (also called affine connection ) and a web .  Formal definition  An affine manifold     M    M   M\,   is a real manifold with charts     ψ  i   :    U  i   →   ℝ  n       normal-:   subscript  ψ  i    normal-→   subscript  U  i    superscript  ℝ  n      \psi_{i}\colon U_{i}\to{\mathbb{R}}^{n}   such that      ψ  i   ∘   ψ  j   -  1     ∈   Aff   (   ℝ  n   )           subscript  ψ  i    superscript   subscript  ψ  j     1       Aff   superscript  ℝ  n      \psi_{i}\circ\psi_{j}^{-1}\in{\rm Aff}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})   for all     i  ,   j    ,     i  j    i,j\,,   where    Aff   (   ℝ  n   )       Aff   superscript  ℝ  n     {\rm Aff}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})   denotes the Lie group of affine transformations.  An affine manifold is called complete if its universal covering is homeomorphic to    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    {\mathbb{R}}^{n}   .  In the case of a compact affine manifold   M   M   M   , let   G   G   G   be the fundamental group of   M   M   M   and    M  ~     normal-~  M    \tilde{M}   be its universal cover . One can show that each   n   n   n   -dimensional affine manifold comes with a developing map    D  :    M  ~   →   ℝ  n       normal-:  D   normal-→   normal-~  M    superscript  ℝ  n      D\colon{\tilde{M}}\to{\mathbb{R}}^{n}   , and a homomorphism     φ  :   G  →   Aff   (   ℝ  n   )        normal-:  φ   normal-→  G    Aff   superscript  ℝ  n       \varphi\colon G\to{\rm Aff}({\mathbb{R}}^{n})   , such that   D   D   D   is an immersion and equivariant with respect to   φ   φ   \varphi   .  A fundamental group of a compact complete flat affine manifold is called an affine crystallographic group . Classification of affine crystallographic groups is a difficult problem, far from being solved. The Riemannian crystallographic groups (also known as Bieberbach groups ) were classified by Ludwig Bieberbach , answering a question posed by David Hilbert . In his work on Hilbert's 18-th problem , Bieberbach proved that any Riemannian crystallographic group contains an abelian subgroup of finite index.  Important longstanding conjectures  Geometry of affine manifolds is essentially a network of longstanding conjectures; most of them proven in low dimension and some other special cases.  The most important of them are   Markus conjecture (1961) stating that a compact affine manifold is complete if and only if it has constant volume. 2 Known in dimension 3.    Auslander conjecture (1964) 3 4 stating that any affine crystallographic group contains a polycyclic subgroup of finite index . Known in dimensions up to 6, 5 and when the holonomy of the flat connection preserves a Lorentz metric . 6 Since every virtually polycyclic crystallographic group preserves a volume form, Auslander conjecture implies the "only if" part of the Markus conjecture. 7    Chern conjecture (1955) The Euler class of an affine manifold vanishes. 8   Notes  References       "  Category:Group theory  Category:Affine geometry  Category:Structures on manifolds  Category:Differential geometry  Category:Manifolds     Bishop, R.L.; Goldberg, S.I.
