   Angle notation      Angle notation   Angle notation or phasor notation is a notation used in electronics.    1   \ang   θ      1  \ang  θ    1\ang\theta   can represent either the vector     (   cos  θ   ,   sin  θ   )       θ     θ     (\cos\theta,\sin\theta)\,   or the complex number       cos  θ   +   j   sin  θ     =   e   j  θ            θ     j    θ      superscript  e    j  θ      \cos\theta+j\sin\theta=e^{j\theta}   , with     j  2   =   -  1        superscript  j  2     1     j^{2}=-1   , both of which have magnitudes of 1.  A vector whose polar coordinates are magnitude   A   A   A   and angle   θ   θ   \theta   is written     A   \ang   θ   .      A  \ang  θ    A\ang\theta.    1 For converting between polar and rectangular forms, see Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates .  In electronics and electrical engineering , there may also be an implied conversion from degrees to radians . For example    1   \ang   90      1  \ang  90    1\ang 90   would be assumed to be     1   \ang    90  ∘    ,      1  \ang   superscript  90      1\ang 90^{\circ},   which is the vector    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)\,   or the number     e    j  π   /  2    .     superscript  e      j  π   2     e^{j\pi/2}.\,     See also   Vector notation   References  "  Category:Electronic engineering     , [ http://books.google.com/books?id=sxmM8RFL99wC&pg; ;=PA338 Chapter 9, page 338] ↩
