Angle notation

Angle notation or phasor notation is a notation used in electronics.  
 
 
 
  can represent either the vector  
 
 
 
   or the complex number  
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , both of which have magnitudes of 1.  A vector whose polar coordinates are magnitude  
 
 
 
 
   and angle  
 
 
 
   is written  
 
 
1    For converting between polar and rectangular forms, see Converting between polar and Cartesian coordinates.
In electronics and electrical engineering, there may also be an implied conversion from degrees to radians. For example  
 
 
 
   would be assumed to be  
 
 
 
   which is the vector  
 
 
 
 
   or the number
