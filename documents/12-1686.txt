   BSWW Beach Soccer rankings      BSWW Beach Soccer rankings   The Beach Soccer Worldwide Beach Soccer Rankings are rankings for international beach soccer teams put together by BSWW and FIFA after FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups have taken place. An individual rankings table for European nations also exists.  FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup rankings table  Scoring points  The nations are ranked based on their participation in the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups between 2006 and 2013 with the most successful teams being ranked highest on the table. A point system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of games played at the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups. Three points for a win in normal time, two points for a win in extra-time or penalties and no points for a loss. Therefore the points each nations has earned are worked out using this formula:      Points Earned  =    (   3  ×  Number of games won in normal time   )   +   (   2  ×  Number of games won in extra time or on penalties   )        Points Earned      3  Number of games won in normal time     2  Number of games won in extra time or on penalties      \text{Points Earned}=(3\times\text{Number of games won in normal time})+(2%
 \times\text{Number of games won in extra time or on penalties})     Sometimes two of the teams will have the same amount of points but one will be in a higher position than the other. This occurs as one team has achieved the same amount of points as the other in a fewer number of games. Teams that have not taken part in a world cup cannot score points, even 0, and therefore are not counted in the rankings table. The next time the table will be updated is after the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup .  The table  The following table is the current rankings for the 30 nations who have qualified to any number of FIFA Beach Soccer World Cups between 2006 and 2013.      Rankings as of the end of the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup       Rank       1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10     11     12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21     22     23     24     25     26     27     28     29     30     European rankings  Scoring points  The other rankings table is the European rankings table specifically for European nations. The points system used to rank nations in this table is much different than the system used to rank the world cup nations. Points are earned through nations competing in continental tournaments throughout the year. These points are then added to 70% of the amount of points earned in the previous year and 40% of the amount of points earned in the year before that. Therefore, to work out the points earned for nations at the end of 2010, this would be the formula used:      Points Earned  =     Points earned in 2008  100   ×  40   +    Points earned in 2009  100   ×  70   +  Points earned in 2010       Points Earned        Points earned in 2008  100   40       Points earned in 2009  100   70   Points earned in 2010     \text{Points Earned}=\frac{\text{Points earned in 2008}}{100}\times 40+\frac{%
 \text{Points earned in 2009}}{100}\times 70+\text{Points earned in 2010}     These rankings are then used to seed the teams in Beach Soccer Worldwide competitions in the following year.  Rankings  The following table is the rankings table after all competitions in 2010. This table will affect seeds in 2011 UEFA beach soccer competitions. A red block indicates that that nation did not compete in that beach soccer season and therefore earned zero points.      2010 Ranking Table 1       Rank       1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10     11     12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21     22     23     24     25     26     27     28     29     30     31     References  "  R  Category:Sports world rankings     ↩
