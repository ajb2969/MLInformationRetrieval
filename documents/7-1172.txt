   Additive identity      Additive identity   In mathematics the additive identity of a set which is equipped with the operation of addition is an element which, when added to any element x in the set, yields x . One of the most familiar additive identities is the number  0 from elementary mathematics , but additive identities occur in other mathematical structures where addition is defined, such as in groups and rings .  Elementary examples   The additive identity familiar from elementary mathematics is zero, denoted 0 . For example,  5 + 0 = 5 = 0 + 5   In the natural numbers  N and all of its supersets (the integers  Z , the rational numbers  Q , the real numbers  R , or the complex numbers  C ), the additive identity is 0. Thus for any one of these numbers  n ,  n + 0 = n = 0 + n     Formal definition  Let N be a set which is closed under the operation of addition , denoted + . An additive identity for N is any element e such that for any element n in N ,   e + n = n = n + e    Example: The formula is n + 0 = n = 0 + n.  Further examples   In a group the additive identity is the identity element of the group, is often denoted 0, and is unique (see below for proof).  A ring or field is a group under the operation of addition and thus these also have a unique additive identity 0. This is defined to be different from the multiplicative identity  1 if the ring (or field) has more than one element. If the additive identity and the multiplicative identity are the same, then the ring is trivial (proved below).  In the ring M m × n ( R ) of m by n  matrices over a ring R , the additive identity is denoted 0 and is the m by n matrix whose entries consist entirely of the identity element 0 in R . For example, in the 2 by 2 matrices over the integers M 2 ( Z ) the additive identity is     0  =   (     0    0      0    0     )       0    0  0    0  0      0=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix}     In the quaternions , 0 is the additive identity.  In the ring of functions from R to R , the function mapping every number to 0 is the additive identity.  In the additive group of vectors in R n , the origin or zero vector is the additive identity.   Proofs  The additive identity is unique in a group  Let ( G , +) be a group and let 0 and 0' in G both denote additive identities, so for any g in G ,   0 + g = g = g + 0 and 0' + g = g = g + 0'   It follows from the above that   (0') = (0') + 0 = 0' + (0) = (0)   The additive identity annihilates ring elements  In a system with a multiplication operation that distributes over addition, the additive identity is a multiplicative absorbing element , meaning that for any s in S , s ·0 = 0. This can be seen because:      s  ⋅  0     normal-⋅  s  0    \displaystyle s\cdot 0     The additive and multiplicative identities are different in a non-trivial ring  Let R be a ring and suppose that the additive identity 0 and the multiplicative identity 1 are equal, or 0 = 1. Let r be any element of R . Then   r = r × 1 = r × 0 = 0   proving that R is trivial, that is, R = {0}. The contrapositive , that if R is non-trivial then 0 is not equal to 1, is therefore shown.
