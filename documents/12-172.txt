Definition  Let E n (ƒ) be the error of the best uniform approximation to a real function  ƒ ( x ) on the interval [−1, 1] by real polynomials of no more than degree n . In the case of ƒ ( x ) = | x |,  showed that the limit  $$\beta=\lim_{n \to \infty}2nE_{2n}(f),\,$$  called Bernstein's constant , exists and is between 0.278 and 0.286. His conjecture that the limit is:  $$\frac {1}{2\sqrt {\pi}}=0.28209\dots\,.$$  was disproven by , who calculated  $$\beta=0.280169499023\dots\,.$$  References       "  Category:Numerical analysis  Category:Mathematical constants
