   Symmetric successive overrelaxation      Symmetric successive overrelaxation   In applied mathematics, symmetric successive overrelaxation (SSOR) , 1 is a preconditioner .  If the original matrix can be decomposed into diagonal, lower and upper tridiagonal as    A  =   D  +  L  +   L  T        A    D  L   superscript  L  T      A=D+L+L^{T}   then SSOR preconditioner matrix is defined as      M  =    (   D  +  L   )    D   -  1      (   D  +  L   )   T        M      D  L    superscript  D    1     superscript    D  L   T      M=(D+L)D^{-1}(D+L)^{T}     It can also be parametrised by   ω   ω   \omega   as follows. 2       M   (  ω  )    =    ω   2  -  ω     (     1  ω   D   +  L   )     (  D  )    -  1      (     1  ω   D   +  L   )   T          M  ω       ω    2  ω          1  ω   D   L    superscript  D    1     superscript        1  ω   D   L   T      M(\omega)={\omega\over{2-\omega}}\left({1\over\omega}D+L\right)\left(D\right)^%
