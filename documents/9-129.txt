Symmetric successive overrelaxation

In applied mathematics, symmetric successive overrelaxation (SSOR),1 is a preconditioner.
If the original matrix can be decomposed into diagonal, lower and upper tridiagonal as 
 
 
 
  then SSOR preconditioner matrix is defined as



It can also be parametrised by 
 
 
 
  as follows.2
