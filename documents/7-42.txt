   Hirzebruch surface      Hirzebruch surface   In mathematics, a Hirzebruch surface is a ruled surface over the projective line . They were studied by .  Definition  The Hirzebruch surface Σ n is the P 1 bundle over P 1 associated to the sheaf        O   (  0  )    +   O   (   -  n   )     .        O  0     O    n      O(0)+O(-n).     The notation here means: O( n ) is the n -th tensor power of the Serre twist sheaf O(1), the invertible sheaf or line bundle with associated Cartier divisor a single point. The surface Σ 0 is isomorphic to P 1 × P 1 , and Σ 1 is isomorphic to P 2 blown up at a point so is not minimal.  Properties  Hirzebruch surfaces for n >0 have a special rational curve  C on them: The surface is the projective bundle of O( -n ) and the curve C is the zero section . This curve has self-intersection number − n , and is the only irreducible curve with negative self intersection number. The only irreducible curves with zero self intersection number are the fibers of the Hirzebruch surface (considered as a fiber bundle over P 1 ). The Picard group is generated by the curve C and one of the fibers, and these generators have intersection matrix       [     0    1      1     -  n      ]   ,      0  1    1    n      \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\
 1&-n\end{bmatrix},     so the bilinear form is two dimensional unimodular, and is even or odd depending on whether n is even or odd.  The Hirzebruch surface Σ n ( n > 1) blown up at a point on the special curve C is isomorphic to Σ n-1 blown up at a point not on the special curve.
