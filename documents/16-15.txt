Very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) dehydratase

Very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) dehydratase (, PHS1 (gene), PAS2 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) hydro-lyase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] 
 
 
 
  a very-long-chain trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + H2O
 

This is the third component of the elongase.
