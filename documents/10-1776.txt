L-cysteate sulfo-lyase




L-cysteate sulfo-lyase

In enzymology, a L-cysteate sulfo-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-cysteate + H2O 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + bisulfite + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-cysteate and H2O, whereas its 3 products are pyruvate, bisulfite, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteate bisulfite-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include L-cysteate sulfo-lyase (deaminating), and CuyA.
