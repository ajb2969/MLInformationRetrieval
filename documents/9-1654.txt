   Curvature of a measure      Curvature of a measure   In mathematics , the curvature of a measure defined on the Euclidean plane  R 2 is a quantification of how much the measure's "distribution of mass" is "curved". It is related to notions of curvature in geometry . In the form presented below, the concept was introduced in 1995 by the mathematician  Mark S. Melnikov ; accordingly, it may be referred to as the Melnikov curvature or Menger-Melnikov curvature . Melnikov and Verdera (1995) established a powerful connection between the curvature of measures and the Cauchy kernel .  Definition  Let μ be a Borel measure on the Euclidean plane R 2 . Given three (distinct) points x , y and z in R 2 , let R ( x , y , z ) be the radius of the Euclidean circle that joins all three of them, or +∞ if they are collinear . The Menger curvature  c ( x , y , z ) is defined to be        c   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =   1   R   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )      ,        c   x  y  z      1    R   x  y  z       c(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{R(x,y,z)},     with the natural convention that c ( x , y , z ) = 0 if x , y and z are collinear. It is also conventional to extend this definition by setting c ( x , y , z ) = 0 if any of the points x , y and z coincide. The Menger-Melnikov curvature  c 2 ( μ ) of μ is defined to be         c  2    (  μ  )    =    ∭   ℝ  2     c     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   2    d  μ   (  x  )   d  μ   (  y  )   d  μ   (  z  )      .         superscript  c  2   μ     subscript  triple-integral   superscript  ℝ  2      c   superscript   x  y  z   2   normal-d  μ  x  normal-d  μ  y  normal-d  μ  z      c^{2}(\mu)=\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}c(x,y,z)^{2}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)\mathrm{d}\mu(%
 y)\mathrm{d}\mu(z).     More generally, for α ≥ 0, define c 2 α ( μ ) by         c   2  α     (  μ  )    =    ∭   ℝ  2     c     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    2  α     d  μ   (  x  )   d  μ   (  y  )   d  μ   (  z  )      .         superscript  c    2  α    μ     subscript  triple-integral   superscript  ℝ  2      c   superscript   x  y  z     2  α    normal-d  μ  x  normal-d  μ  y  normal-d  μ  z      c^{2\alpha}(\mu)=\iiint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}c(x,y,z)^{2\alpha}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x)%
 \mathrm{d}\mu(y)\mathrm{d}\mu(z).     One may also refer to the curvature of μ at a given point x :         c  2    (  μ  ;  x  )    =    ∬   ℝ  2     c     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   2    d  μ   (  y  )   d  μ   (  z  )      ,         superscript  c  2    μ  x      subscript  double-integral   superscript  ℝ  2      c   superscript   x  y  z   2   normal-d  μ  y  normal-d  μ  z      c^{2}(\mu;x)=\iint_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}c(x,y,z)^{2}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(y)\mathrm{d}\mu%
 (z),     in which case         c  2    (  μ  )    =    ∫   ℝ  2      c  2    (  μ  ;  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )      .         superscript  c  2   μ     subscript    superscript  ℝ  2       superscript  c  2    μ  x   normal-d  μ  x      c^{2}(\mu)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}c^{2}(\mu;x)\,\mathrm{d}\mu(x).     Examples   The trivial measure has zero curvature.  A Dirac measure  δ a supported at any point a has zero curvature.  If μ is any measure whose support is contained within a Euclidean line L , then μ has zero curvature. For example, one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on any line (or line segment) has zero curvature.  The Lebesgue measure defined on all of R 2 has infinite curvature.  If μ is the uniform one-dimensional Hausdorff measure on a circle C r or radius r , then μ has curvature 1/ r .   Relationship to the Cauchy kernel  In this section, R 2 is thought of as the complex plane  C . Melnikov and Verdera (1995) showed the precise relation of the boundedness of the Cauchy kernel to the curvature of measures. They proved that if there is some constant C 0 such that       μ   (    B  r    (  x  )    )    ≤    C  0   r         μ     subscript  B  r   x       subscript  C  0   r     \mu(B_{r}(x))\leq C_{0}r     for all x in C and all r > 0, then there is another constant C , depending only on C 0 , such that       |    6    ∫  ℂ       |    𝒞  ε    (  μ  )    (  z  )    |   2    d  μ   (  z  )      -    c  ε  2    (  μ  )     |   ≤   C   ∥  μ  ∥              6    subscript   ℂ      superscript       subscript  𝒞  ε   μ  z    2   normal-d  μ  z        superscript   subscript  c  ε   2   μ       C   norm  μ      \left|6\int_{\mathbb{C}}|\mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon}(\mu)(z)|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}\mu%
 (z)-c_{\varepsilon}^{2}(\mu)\right|\leq C\|\mu\|     for all ε > 0. Here c ε denotes a truncated version of the Menger-Melnikov curvature in which the integral is taken only over those points x , y and z such that        |   x  -  y   |   >  ε   ;          x  y    ε    |x-y|>\varepsilon;           |   y  -  z   |   >  ε   ;          y  z    ε    |y-z|>\varepsilon;           |   z  -  x   |   >  ε   .          z  x    ε    |z-x|>\varepsilon.     Similarly,    𝒞  ε     subscript  𝒞  ε    \mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon}   denotes a truncated Cauchy integral operator: for a measure μ on C and a point z in C , define         𝒞  ε    (  μ  )    (  z  )    =   ∫     1   ξ  -  z     d  μ   (  ξ  )      ,         subscript  𝒞  ε   μ  z         1    ξ  z    normal-d  μ  ξ      \mathcal{C}_{\varepsilon}(\mu)(z)=\int\frac{1}{\xi-z}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(\xi),     where the integral is taken over those points ξ in C with        |   ξ  -  z   |   >  ε   .          ξ  z    ε    |\xi-z|>\varepsilon.
