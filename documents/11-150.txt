   1,5-anhydro-D-fructose dehydratase      1,5-anhydro-D-fructose dehydratase   In enzymology , a 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,5-anhydro-D-fructose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose , and two products , 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose and H 2 O .  It catalyzes two steps in the anhydrofructose pathway process. 1  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases , which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydro-lyase (ascopyrone-M-forming) . Other names in common use include 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose 4-dehydratase , 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydrolyase , 1,5-anhydro-D-arabino-hex-2-ulose dehydratase , AFDH , AF dehydratase , and 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydro-lyase .
