   Sulfur oxygenase/reductase      Sulfur oxygenase/reductase   In enzymology , a sulfur oxygenase/reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4 sulfur + 4 H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 hydrogen sulfide + 2 bisulfite + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are sulfur , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are hydrogen sulfide , bisulfite , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is sulfur:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydrogen-sulfide- and sulfite-forming) . Other names in common use include SOR , sulfur oxygenase , and sulfur oxygenase reductase .  References        "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
