Motivic zeta function

In algebraic geometry, the motivic zeta function of a smooth algebraic variety

 
  is the formal power series


 
  Here 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th symmetric power of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., the quotient of 
 
 
 
  by the action of the symmetric group

 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the class of 
 
 
 
  in the ring of motives (see below).
If the ground field is finite, and one applies the counting measure to 
 
 
 
 , one obtains the local zeta function of 
 
 
 
 .
If the ground field is the complex numbers, and one applies Euler characteristic with compact supports to 
 
 
 
 , one obtains 
 
 
 
 .
Motivic measures
A motivic measure is a map 
 
 
 
  from the set of finite type schemes over a field

 
  to a commutative ring

 
 , satisfying the three properties


 
  depends only on the isomorphism class of 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  if 
 
 
 
  is a closed subscheme of 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 . For example if 
 
 
 
  is a finite field and 
 
 
 
  is the ring of integers, then 
 
 
 
  defines a motivic measure, the counting measure.
If the ground field is the complex numbers, then Euler characteristic with compact supports defines a motivic measure with values in the integers.
The zeta function with respect to a motivic measure 
 
 
 
  is the formal power series in 
 
 
 
  given by


 
 .
There is a universal motivic measure. It takes values in the K-ring of varieties, 
 
 
 
 , which is the ring generated by the symbols 
 
 
 
 , for all varieties 
 
 
 
 , subject to the relations


 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic,


 
  if 
 
 
 
  is a closed subvariety of 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 . The universal motivic measure gives rise to the motivic zeta function.
Examples
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the class of the affine line.






If 
 
 
 
  is a smooth projective irreducible curve of genus

 
  admitting a line bundle of degree 1, and the motivic measure takes values in a field in which 
 
 
 
  is invertible, then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 . Thus, in this case, the motivic zeta function is rational. In higher dimension, the motivic zeta function is not always rational.
If 
 
 
 
  is a smooth surface over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 
 
 
 
 , then the generating function for the motives of the Hilbert schemes of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in terms of the motivic zeta function by GÃ¶ttsche's Formula



Here 
 
 
 
  is the Hilbert scheme of length 
 
 
 
  subschemes of 
 
 
 
 . For the affine plane this formula gives



This is essentially the partition function.
