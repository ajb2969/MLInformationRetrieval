   Thiele's interpolation formula      Thiele's interpolation formula   In mathematics , Thiele's interpolation formula is a formula that defines a rational function     f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   from a finite set of inputs    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   and their function values    f   (   x  i   )       f   subscript  x  i     f(x_{i})   . The problem of generating a function whose graph passes through a given set of function values is called interpolation . This interpolation formula is named after the Danish mathematician Thorvald N. Thiele . It is expressed as a continued fraction , where ρ represents the reciprocal difference :       f   (  x  )    =    f   (   x  1   )    +    x  -   x  1      ρ   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    +     x  -   x  2        ρ  2    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    -   f   (   x  1   )     +     x  -   x  3        ρ  3    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   ,   x  4   )    -   ρ   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )     +  ⋯                 f  x       f   subscript  x  1     continued-fraction    x   subscript  x  1        ρ    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      continued-fraction    x   subscript  x  2           subscript  ρ  2     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       f   subscript  x  1      continued-fraction    x   subscript  x  3           subscript  ρ  3     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4       ρ    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      normal-⋯           f(x)=f(x_{1})+\cfrac{x-x_{1}}{\rho(x_{1},x_{2})+\cfrac{x-x_{2}}{\rho_{2}(x_{1}%
