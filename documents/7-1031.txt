Thiele's interpolation formula

In mathematics, Thiele's interpolation formula is a formula that defines a rational function

 
  from a finite set of inputs 
 
 
 
  and their function values 
 
 
 
 . The problem of generating a function whose graph passes through a given set of function values is called interpolation. This interpolation formula is named after the Danish mathematician Thorvald N. Thiele. It is expressed as a continued fraction, where œÅ represents the reciprocal difference:
