   Frattini subgroup      Frattini subgroup   (Figure)  Hasse diagram of the lattice of subgroups of the dihedral group  Dih 4  In the 3-element layer are the maximal subgroups; their intersection (the F. s. ) is the central element in the 5-element layer. So Dih 4 has only one non-generating element beyond e .   In mathematics , the Frattini subgroup Φ( G ) of a group  G is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of G . For the case that G has no maximal subgroups, for example the trivial group  e or the Prüfer group , it is defined by Φ( G ) = G . It is analogous to the Jacobson radical in the theory of rings , and intuitively can be thought of as the subgroup of "small elements" (see the "non-generator" characterization below). It is named after Giovanni Frattini , who defined the concept in a paper published in 1885.  Some facts   Φ( G ) is equal to the set of all non-generators or non-generating elements of G . A non-generating element of G is an element that can always be removed from a generating set ; that is, an element a of G such that whenever X is a generating set of G containing a , X − { a } is also a generating set of G .  Φ( G ) is always a characteristic subgroup of G ; in particular, it is always a normal subgroup of G .  If G is finite, then Φ( G ) is nilpotent .  If G is a finite p -group , then Φ( G ) = G p [ G , G ]. Thus the Frattini subgroup is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) normal subgroup  N such that the quotient group  G / N is an elementary abelian group , i.e., isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of order  p . Moreover, if the quotient group G /Φ( G ) (also called the Frattini quotient of G ) has order p k , then k is the smallest number of generators for G (that is the smallest cardinality of a generating set for G ). In particular a finite p -group is cyclic if and only if its Frattini quotient is cyclic (of order p ). A finite p -group is elementary abelian if and only if its Frattini subgroup is the trivial group , Φ( G ) = e .  If H and K are finite, then Φ( H x K ) = Φ( H )x Φ( K ).   An example of a group with nontrivial Frattini subgroup is the cyclic group  G of order p 2 , where p is prime, generated by a , say; here,     Φ   (  G  )    =   ⟨   a  p   ⟩         normal-Φ  G    delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  a  p      \Phi(G)=\left\langle a^{p}\right\rangle   .
