   Pierpont prime      Pierpont prime   A Pierpont prime is a prime number of the form  2 u 3 v + 1 for some nonnegative integers  u and v . That is, they are the prime numbers p for which p − 1 is 3-smooth . They are named after the mathematician James Pierpont .  It is possible to prove that if v = 0 and u > 0, then u must be a power of 2, making the prime a Fermat prime . If v is positive then u must also be positive, and the Pierpont prime is of the form 6 k + 1 (because if u = 0 and v > 0 then 2 u 3 v + 1 is an even number greater than 2 and therefore composite).  The first few Pierpont primes are:   2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 37 , 73 , 97 , 109 , 163 , 193 , 257 , 433 , 487, 577, 769, 1153, 1297, 1459, 2593, 2917, 3457, 3889, 10369, 12289, 17497, 18433, 39367, 52489, 65537, 139969, 147457, 209953, 331777, 472393, 629857, 746497, 786433, 839809, 995329.   Distribution of Pierpont primes   Andrew Gleason conjectured there are infinitely many Pierpont primes. They are not particularly rare and there are few restrictions from algebraic factorisations, so there are no requirements like the Mersenne prime condition that the exponent must be prime. There are 36 Pierpont primes less than 10 6 , 59 less than 10 9 , 151 less than 10 20 , and 789 less than 10 100 ; conjecturally there are O(log N ) Pierpont primes smaller than N , as opposed to the conjectured O(log log N ) Mersenne primes in that range.  Pierpont primes found as factors of Fermat numbers  As part of the ongoing worldwide search for factors of Fermat numbers , some Pierpont primes have been announced as factors. The following table 1 gives values of m , k , and n such that       k  ⋅   2  n    +   1  divides   2   2  m     +   1.        normal-⋅  k   superscript  2  n      1  divides   superscript  2   superscript  2  m     1.    k\cdot 2^{n}+1\text{ divides }2^{2^{m}}+1.\,     The left-hand side is a Pierpont prime when k is a power of 3; the right-hand side is a Fermat number.       m   k   n   Year   Discoverer     38   3   41   1903   Cullen , Cunningham & Western     63   9   67   1956   Robinson     207   3   209   1956   Robinson     452   27   455   1956   Robinson     9428   9   9431   1983   Keller     12185   81   12189   1993   Dubner     28281   81   28285   1996   Taura     157167   3   157169   1995   Young     213319   3   213321   1996   Young     303088   3   303093   1998   Young     382447   3   382449   1999   Cosgrave & Gallot     461076   9   461081   2003   Nohara, Jobling, Woltman & Gallot     672005   27   672007   2005   Cooper , Jobling, Woltman & Gallot     2145351   3   2145353   2003   Cosgrave, Jobling, Woltman & Gallot     2478782   3   2478785   2003   Cosgrave, Jobling, Woltman & Gallot     , the largest known Pierpont prime is 3 × 2 7033641 + 1, 2 whose primality was discovered by Michael Herder in 2011.  In the mathematics of paper folding , the Huzita axioms define six of the seven types of fold possible. It has been shown that these folds are sufficient to allow any regular polygon of N sides to be formed, as long as N > 3 and of the form 2 m 3 n ρ, where ρ is a product of distinct Pierpont primes. This is the same class of regular polygons as those that can be constructed with a compass , straightedge , and angle-trisector . Regular polygons which can be constructed with only compass and straightedge ( constructible polygons ) are the special case where n = 0 and ρ is a product of distinct Fermat primes , themselves a subset of Pierpont primes.  The smallest prime that is not a Pierpont (or Fermat) prime is 11; therefore, the hendecagon is the smallest regular polygon that cannot be constructed with compass, straightedge and angle trisector. All other regular n -gons with 3≤ n ≤21 can be constructed with compass, straightedge and trisector (if needed).
