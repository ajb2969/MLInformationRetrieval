   Quadrature modulation      Quadrature modulation   Quadrature modulation is the general technique of modulating two carriers.  Examples include Quadrature amplitude modulation , Phase-shift keying , and Minimum-shift keying .  Constellation diagrams are used to examine the modulation in the 2-D signal space.  Explanation  Sending a signal by amplitude modulation consists of sending the function       y   (  t  )    =    I   (  t  )    ⋅   cos   (    ω  c   t   )           y  t    normal-⋅    I  t        subscript  ω  c   t       y(t)=I(t)\cdot\cos(\omega_{c}t)   where    I   (  t  )       I  t    I(t)   is the signal to encode and    cos   (    ω  c   t   )          subscript  ω  c   t     \cos(\omega_{c}t)   is the carrier wave,    ω  c     subscript  ω  c    \omega_{c}   is the carrier frequency – one is changing the amplitude of a carrier wave to encode the signal, hence amplitude modulation.  In general one could also change the phase of the carrier to encode the signal, as in:       z   (  t  )    =     I   (  t  )    ⋅   cos   (    ω  c   t   )     -    Q   (  t  )    ⋅   sin   (    ω  c   t   )            z  t      normal-⋅    I  t        subscript  ω  c   t      normal-⋅    Q  t        subscript  ω  c   t        z(t)=I(t)\cdot\cos(\omega_{c}t)-Q(t)\cdot\sin(\omega_{c}t)   this 90° (the angle of a rectangle, or a 1/4 turn) is why it is called "quadrature" modulation, and the symbols    I   (  t  )       I  t    I(t)   and    Q   (  t  )       Q  t    Q(t)   indicate the "in-phase" signal and "quadrature" signal.  In terms of Euler's formula ,      e   i  t    =    cos  t   +   i   sin  t      ,       superscript  e    i  t        t     i    t       e^{it}=\cos t+i\sin t,   amplitude modulation encodes a 1-dimensional real signal, while quadrature modulation encodes a 2-dimensional complex signal. This viewpoint, that a wave of a given frequency can encode 2 dimensions of data, is elaborated in Fourier analysis , and is the principle that quadrature modulation exploits.  Clocking  The added channel capacity is not costless, however.  An amplitude-modulated signal is self-clocking – it has zero-crossings at a regular frequency as a clock pulse . A quadrature-modulated signal, by contrast, has no such pulse, and thus sender and receiver must share a clock or otherwise send a clock signal – if the clocks drift by phase φ, which corresponds to rotation by φ in the    (  I  ,  Q  )     I  Q    (I,Q)   plane, then the I and Q signal bleed into each other, yielding crosstalk . In this context, the clock signal is called a "phase reference" – in NTSC , which uses quadrature amplitude modulation , this is conveyed by the color burst , a synchronization signal.  By contrast, in polar modulation, clock drift simply degrades the phase-modulated signal.  Polar modulation  Quadrature modulates two signals by changing the in-phase and quadrature phase components, corresponding to Cartesian coordinates . By contrast, one can instead consider this to be changing the amplitude and phase of a wave, which corresponds to polar coordinates . The corresponding modulation is called polar modulation , and was developed earlier, in the 1874 quadruplex telegraph by Thomas Edison .
