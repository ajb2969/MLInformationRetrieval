Purification of quantum state

In quantum mechanics, especially quantum information, purification refers to the fact that every mixed state acting on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be viewed as the reduced state of some pure state.
In purely linear algebraic terms, it can be viewed as a statement about positive-semidefinite matrices.
Statement
Let ρ be a density matrix acting on a Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  of finite dimension n. Then there exist a Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  and a pure state 
 
 
 
  such that the partial trace of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 




We say that 
 
 
 
  is the purification of 
 
 
 
 .
Proof
A density matrix is by definition positive semidefinite. So ρ can be diagonalized and written as 
 
 
 
  for some basis 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be another copy of the n-dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
  by



Direct calculation gives




This proves the claim.
Note

The vectorial pure state 
 
 
 
  is in the form specified by the Schmidt decomposition.


Since square root decompositions of a positive semidefinite matrix are not unique, neither are purifications.


In linear algebraic terms, a square matrix is positive semidefinite if and only if it can be purified in the above sense. The if part of the implication follows immediately from the fact that the partial trace of a positive map remains a positive map.

An application: Stinespring's theorem
By combining Choi's theorem on completely positive maps and purification of a mixed state, we can recover the Stinespring dilation theorem for the finite-dimensional case.
