   Narrow class group      Narrow class group   In algebraic number theory , the narrow class group of a number field  K is a refinement of the class group of K that takes into account some information about embeddings of K into the field of real numbers .  Formal definition  Suppose that K is a finite extension of Q . Recall that the ordinary class group of K is defined to be        C  K   =    I  K   /   P  K     ,       subscript  C  K      subscript  I  K    subscript  P  K      C_{K}=I_{K}/P_{K},\,\!   where I K is the group of fractional ideals of K , and P K is the group of principal fractional ideals of K , that is, ideals of the form aO K where a is a unit of K .  The narrow class group is defined to be the quotient        C  K  +   =    I  K   /   P  K  +     ,       superscript   subscript  C  K        subscript  I  K    superscript   subscript  P  K        C_{K}^{+}=I_{K}/P_{K}^{+},   where now P K + is the group of totally positive principal fractional ideals of K ; that is, ideals of the form aO K where a is a unit of K such that σ( a ) is positive for every embedding       σ  :   K  →  𝐑    .     normal-:  σ   normal-→  K  𝐑     \sigma:K\to\mathbf{R}.     Uses  The narrow class group features prominently in the theory of representing of integers by quadratic forms . An example is the following result (Fröhlich and Taylor, Chapter V, Theorem 1.25).   Theorem . Suppose that      K  =   𝐐   (   d   )     ,      K    𝐐    d      K=\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d}),      where d is a square-free integer , and that the narrow class group of K is trivial. Suppose that     {   ω  1   ,   ω  2   }      subscript  ω  1    subscript  ω  2     \{\omega_{1},\omega_{2}\}\,\!      is a basis for the ring of integers of K . Define a quadratic form       q  K    (  x  ,  y  )    =    N   K  /  𝐐     (     ω  1   x   +    ω  2   y    )           subscript  q  K    x  y       subscript  N    K  𝐐         subscript  ω  1   x      subscript  ω  2   y       q_{K}(x,y)=N_{K/\mathbf{Q}}(\omega_{1}x+\omega_{2}y)   ,   where N K / Q is the norm . Then a prime number  p is of the form     p  =    q  K    (  x  ,  y  )        p     subscript  q  K    x  y      p=q_{K}(x,y)\,\!      for some integers x and y  if and only if either     p  ∣   d  K   ,     fragments  p  normal-∣   subscript  d  K   normal-,    p\mid d_{K}\,\!,      or       p  =   2  and      d  K   ≡   1     (   mod  8   )      ,     formulae-sequence    p   2  and       subscript  d  K    annotated  1   pmod  8       p=2\quad\mbox{and}\quad d_{K}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}8),      or       p  >   2  and      (    d  K   p   )   =  1    ,     formulae-sequence    p   2  and         subscript  d  K   p   1     p>2\quad\mbox{and}\quad\left(\frac{d_{K}}{p}\right)=1,      where d K is the discriminant of K , and     (   a  b   )      a  b    \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)      indicates the Legendre symbol .   Examples  For example, one can prove that the quadratic fields Q (√−1), Q (√2), Q (√−3) all have trivial narrow class group. Then, by choosing appropriate bases for the integers of each of these fields, the above theorem implies the following:   A prime p is of the form p = x 2 + y 2 for integers x and y if and only if           p  =   2  or     p  ≡   1     (   mod  4   )      .     formulae-sequence    p   2  or      p   annotated  1   pmod  4       p=2\quad\mbox{or}\quad p\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}4).       (This is known as Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares .)    A prime p is of the form p = x 2 − 2 y 2 for integers x and y if and only if           p  =   2  or     p  ≡   1  ,   7     (   mod  8   )       .     formulae-sequence    p   2  or      p   1   annotated  7   pmod  8        p=2\quad\mbox{or}\quad p\equiv 1,7\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}8).         A prime p is of the form p = x 2 − xy + y 2 for integers x and y if and only if           p  =   3  or     p  ≡   1     (   mod  3   )      .     formulae-sequence    p   3  or      p   annotated  1   pmod  3       p=3\quad\mbox{or}\quad p\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}3).
