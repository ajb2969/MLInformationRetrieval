Bell series

In mathematics, the Bell series is a formal power series used to study properties of arithmetical functions. Bell series were introduced and developed by Eric Temple Bell.
Given an arithmetic function

 
  and a prime

 
 , define the formal power series 
 
 
 
 , called the Bell series of 
 
 
 
  modulo 
 
 
 
  as:



Two multiplicative functions can be shown to be identical if all of their Bell series are equal; this is sometimes called the uniqueness theorem: given multiplicative functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , one has 
 
 
if and only if:


 
  for all primes 
 
 
 
 .
Two series may be multiplied (sometimes called the multiplication theorem): For any two arithmetic functions

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be their Dirichlet convolution. Then for every prime 
 
 
 
 , one has:



In particular, this makes it trivial to find the Bell series of a Dirichlet inverse.
If 
 
 
 
  is completely multiplicative, then formally:
