   Bell series      Bell series   In mathematics , the Bell series is a formal power series used to study properties of arithmetical functions. Bell series were introduced and developed by Eric Temple Bell .  Given an arithmetic function    f   f   f   and a prime    p   p   p   , define the formal power series     f  p    (  x  )        subscript  f  p   x    f_{p}(x)   , called the Bell series of   f   f   f   modulo   p   p   p   as:         f  p    (  x  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    f   (   p  n   )    x  n      .         subscript  f  p   x     superscript   subscript     n  0        f   superscript  p  n    superscript  x  n       f_{p}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f(p^{n})x^{n}.     Two multiplicative functions can be shown to be identical if all of their Bell series are equal; this is sometimes called the uniqueness theorem : given multiplicative functions   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   , one has    f  =  g      f  g    f=g    if and only if :        f  p    (  x  )    =    g  p    (  x  )           subscript  f  p   x      subscript  g  p   x     f_{p}(x)=g_{p}(x)   for all primes   p   p   p   .  Two series may be multiplied (sometimes called the multiplication theorem ): For any two arithmetic functions    f   f   f   and   g   g   g   , let    h  =   f  *  g       h    f  g     h=f*g   be their Dirichlet convolution . Then for every prime   p   p   p   , one has:         h  p    (  x  )    =    f  p    (  x  )    g  p    (  x  )     .         subscript  h  p   x      subscript  f  p   x   subscript  g  p   x     h_{p}(x)=f_{p}(x)g_{p}(x).\,     In particular, this makes it trivial to find the Bell series of a Dirichlet inverse .  If   f   f   f   is completely multiplicative , then formally:         f  p    (  x  )    =   1   1  -   f   (  p  )   x      .         subscript  f  p   x     1    1    f  p  x       f_{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1-f(p)x}.     Examples  The following is a table of the Bell series of well-known arithmetic functions.   The Möbius function    μ   μ   \mu   has       μ  p    (  x  )    =   1  -  x    .         subscript  μ  p   x     1  x     \mu_{p}(x)=1-x.     Euler's Totient    φ   φ   \varphi   has       φ  p    (  x  )    =    1  -  x    1  -   p  x      .         subscript  φ  p   x       1  x     1    p  x       \varphi_{p}(x)=\frac{1-x}{1-px}.     The multiplicative identity of the Dirichlet convolution    δ   δ   \delta   has      δ  p    (  x  )    =  1.         subscript  δ  p   x   1.    \delta_{p}(x)=1.     The Liouville function    λ   λ   \lambda   has       λ  p    (  x  )    =   1   1  +  x     .         subscript  λ  p   x     1    1  x      \lambda_{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}.     The power function Id k has        (   Id  k   )   p    (  x  )    =   1   1  -    p  k   x      .         subscript   subscript  Id  k   p   x     1    1     superscript  p  k   x       (\textrm{Id}_{k})_{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1-p^{k}x}.   Here, Id k is the completely multiplicative function      Id  k    (  n  )    =   n  k         subscript  Id  k   n    superscript  n  k     \operatorname{Id}_{k}(n)=n^{k}   .  The divisor function     σ  k     subscript  σ  k    \sigma_{k}   has        (   σ  k   )   p    (  x  )    =   1    1  -    (   1  +   p  k    )   x    +    p  k    x  2       .         subscript   subscript  σ  k   p   x     1      1      1   superscript  p  k    x       superscript  p  k    superscript  x  2        (\sigma_{k})_{p}(x)=\frac{1}{1-(1+p^{k})x+p^{k}x^{2}}.
