   Renilla-luciferin sulfotransferase      Renilla-luciferin sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a Renilla-luciferin sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + Renilla luciferin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + luciferyl sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and Renilla luciferin , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and luciferyl sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:Renilla luciferin sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include luciferin sulfotransferase , luciferin sulfokinase , luciferin sulfokinase (3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate:luciferin , and sulfotransferase) .
