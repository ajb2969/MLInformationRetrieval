   Earnings per share      Earnings per share   Earnings per share (EPS) is the monetary value of earnings per outstanding share of common stock for a company.  In the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires EPS information for the four major categories of the income statement : continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and net income .  Calculating EPS  Preferred stock rights have precedence over common stock. Therefore, dividends on preferred shares are subtracted before calculating the EPS. When preferred shares are cumulative, annual dividends are deducted whether or not they have been declared. Dividends in arrears are not relevant when calculating EPS.

Diluted EPS indicates a "worst case" scenario, one that reflects the issuance of stock for all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities that would reduce earnings per share. 1  Calculations  Calculations of diluted EPS vary. Morningstar reports diluted EPS "Earnings/Share $", which is net income minus preferred stock dividends divided by the weighted average of common stock shares outstanding over the past year; this is adjusted for dilutive shares. 2 3 Some data sources may simplify this calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a reporting period. 4  U.S. GAAP  Calculations of diluted EPS under U.S. GAAP are described under Statement No. 128 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FAS No. 128). 5 The objective of diluted EPS is to measure the performance of a company over the reporting period taking into account the dilutive effect of potential common stock that could be issued by the company. To compute diluted EPS, both the denominator (outstanding shares) and the numerator (earnings) may need to be adjusted.  ''Diluted shares: '' To calculate the total number of shares used in the calculation, FASB prescribes using the treasury method to calculate the dilutive effect of any instruments that could result in the issuance of shares, including:   Stock options  Warrants  Convertible preferred stock  Convertible bonds  Share-based payment arrangements  Written put options  Contingently issuable shares   ''Earnings: '' The numerator used in calculating diluted EPS is adjusted to take into account the impact that the conversion of any securities would have on earnings. For example, interest would be added back to earnings to reflect the conversion of any outstanding convertible bonds, preferred dividends would be added back to reflect the conversion of convertible preferred stock, and any impact of these changes on other financial items, such as royalties and taxes, would also be adjusted.  International financial reporting standards  Under International Financial Reporting Standards , diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of shares for the effects of dilutive options and other dilutive potential common stock . 6 Dilutive potential common stock includes: 7   convertible debt  convertible preferred stock  share warrants  share options  share rights  Employee stock purchase plans  contractual rights to purchase shares  contingent issuance contracts or agreement   See also   Accretion/dilution analysis  P/E ratio   References  External links   European banks’ earnings announcements , video  Earnings Per Share Screener - figures from official financial statements  Price-To-Earning Ratio calculator   "  Category:Corporate finance  Category:Fundamental analysis  Category:Basic financial concepts  Category:Financial ratios     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
