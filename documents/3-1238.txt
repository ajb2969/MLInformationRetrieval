   Basel problem      Basel problem   The Basel problem is a problem in mathematical analysis with relevance to number theory , first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1644 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1734 1 and read on 5 December 1735 in The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences (). 2 Since the problem had withstood the attacks of the leading mathematicians of the day, Euler's solution brought him immediate fame when he was twenty-eight. Euler generalised the problem considerably, and his ideas were taken up years later by Bernhard Riemann in his seminal 1859 paper On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude , in which he defined his zeta function and proved its basic properties. The problem is named after Basel , hometown of Euler as well as of the Bernoulli family who unsuccessfully attacked the problem.  The Basel problem asks for the precise summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers , i.e. the precise sum of the infinite series :         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2     =    lim   n  →   +  ∞      (    1   1  2    +   1   2  2    +  ⋯  +   1   n  2     )     .        superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2       subscript    normal-→  n            1   superscript  1  2      1   superscript  2  2    normal-⋯    1   superscript  n  2        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}=\lim_{n\to+\infty}\left(\frac{1}{1^{2}}+%
 \frac{1}{2^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right).     The series is approximately equal to 1.644934 . The Basel problem asks for the exact sum of this series (in closed form ), as well as a proof that this sum is correct. Euler found the exact sum to be     π  2   6       superscript  π  2   6    \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}   and announced this discovery in 1735. His arguments were based on manipulations that were not justified at the time, and it was not until 1741 that he was able to produce a truly rigorous proof.  Euler's approach  Euler's original derivation of the value π 2 /6 essentially extended observations about finite polynomials and assumed that these same properties hold true for infinite series.  Of course, Euler's original reasoning requires justification (100 years later, Weierstrass proved that Euler's representation of the sine function as an infinite product is correct, see: Weierstrass factorization theorem ), but even without justification, by simply obtaining the correct value, he was able to verify it numerically against partial sums of the series. The agreement he observed gave him sufficient confidence to announce his result to the mathematical community.  To follow Euler's argument, recall the Taylor series expansion of the sine function        sin   (  x  )    =      x  -    x  3    3  !     +    x  5    5  !     -    x  7    7  !     +  ⋯    .        x           x     superscript  x  3     3        superscript  x  5     5        superscript  x  7     7     normal-⋯     \sin(x)=x-\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}-\frac{x^{7}}{7!}+\cdots.     Dividing through by x , we have         sin   (  x  )    x   =      1  -    x  2    3  !     +    x  4    5  !     -    x  6    7  !     +  ⋯    .          x   x           1     superscript  x  2     3        superscript  x  4     5        superscript  x  6     7     normal-⋯     \frac{\sin(x)}{x}=1-\frac{x^{2}}{3!}+\frac{x^{4}}{5!}-\frac{x^{6}}{7!}+\cdots.     Using the Weierstrass factorization theorem , it can also be shown that the left-hand side is the product of linear factors given by its roots, just as we do for finite polynomials (which Euler assumed, but is not always true):        sin   (  x  )    x         x   x    \displaystyle\frac{\sin(x)}{x}     If we formally multiply out this product and collect all the x 2 terms (we are allowed to do so because of Newton's identities ), we see that the x 2 coefficient of sin( x )/ x is        -   (    1   π  2    +   1   4   π  2     +   1   9   π  2     +  ⋯   )    =   -    1   π  2      ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2        .            1   superscript  π  2      1    4   superscript  π  2       1    9   superscript  π  2     normal-⋯          1   superscript  π  2      superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2         -\left(\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}+\frac{1}{4\pi^{2}}+\frac{1}{9\pi^{2}}+\cdots\right)=-%
 \frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}.     But from the original infinite series expansion of sin( x )/ x , the coefficient of x 2 is −1/(3!) = −1/6. These two coefficients must be equal; thus,        -   1  6    =   -    1   π  2      ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2        .          1  6          1   superscript  π  2      superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2         -\frac{1}{6}=-\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}.     Multiplying through both sides of this equation by    -   π  2        superscript  π  2     -\pi^{2}   gives the sum of the reciprocals of the positive square integers.         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2     =    π  2   6    .        superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2        superscript  π  2   6     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}.     The Riemann zeta function  The Riemann zeta function     ζ   (  s  )       ζ  s    \zeta(s)   is one of the most important functions in mathematics, because of its relationship to the distribution of the prime numbers . The function is defined for any complex number  s with real part > 1 by the following formula:        ζ   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  s      .        ζ  s     superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  s       \zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}.     Taking s = 2, we see that    ζ   (  2  )       ζ  2    \zeta(2)   is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the positive integers:       ζ   (  2  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2     =    1   1  2    +   1   2  2    +   1   3  2    +   1   4  2    +  ⋯   =    π  2   6   ≈  1.644934.          ζ  2     superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2              1   superscript  1  2      1   superscript  2  2      1   superscript  3  2      1   superscript  4  2    normal-⋯           superscript  π  2   6        1.644934.     \zeta(2)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}=\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\frac{1}{2^{2}}+%
 \frac{1}{3^{2}}+\frac{1}{4^{2}}+\cdots=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}\approx 1.644934.     Convergence can be proven with the following inequality:         ∑   n  =  1   N      1   n  2      <         superscript   subscript     n  1    N     1   superscript  n  2     absent    \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n^{2}}<     This gives us the upper bound     ζ   (  2  )    <  2        ζ  2   2    \zeta(2)<2   , and because the infinite sum has only positive terms, it must converge. It can be shown that    ζ   (  s  )       ζ  s    \zeta(s)   has a nice expression in terms of the Bernoulli numbers whenever s is a positive even integer. With    s  =   2  n       s    2  n     s=2n   :       ζ   (   2  n   )    =      (   2  π   )    2  n      (   -  1   )    n  +  1     B   2  n      2  ⋅    (   2  n   )   !           ζ    2  n         superscript    2  π     2  n     superscript    1     n  1     subscript  B    2  n      normal-⋅  2      2  n        \zeta(2n)=\frac{(2\pi)^{2n}(-1)^{n+1}B_{2n}}{2\cdot(2n)!}     A rigorous proof using Fourier series  Let     f   (  x  )    =  x        f  x   x    f(x)=x   over the interval x ∈ (–   π   π   \pi   ,   π   π   \pi   ). The Fourier series for this function (worked out in that article) is        f   (  x  )    =   2    ∑   n  =  1   ∞       (   -  1   )    n  +  1    n    sin   (   n  x   )        .        f  x     2    superscript   subscript     n  1           superscript    1     n  1    n       n  x         f(x)=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}\sin(nx).     Then, using Parseval's identity (with     f   (  x  )    =  x        f  x   x    f(x)=x   ) we have that        ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     |   a  n   |   2    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π      x  2    d  x           superscript   subscript     n           superscript     subscript  a  n    2        1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π      superscript  x  2   d  x       \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|a_{n}|^{2}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}x^{2}\,dx   ,  where      a  n     subscript  a  n    \displaystyle a_{n}     for n ≠ 0, and a 0 = 0. Thus,        |   a  n   |   2   =   1   n  2         superscript     subscript  a  n    2     1   superscript  n  2      |a_{n}|^{2}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}     for n ≠ 0 and        ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     |   a  n   |   2    =   2    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2      =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π      x  2    d  x             superscript   subscript     n           superscript     subscript  a  n    2      2    superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2               1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π      superscript  x  2   d  x        \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|a_{n}|^{2}=2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}=\frac%

 \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}     as required.  A rigorous elementary proof  This is by far the most elementary well-known proof; while most proofs use results from advanced mathematics, such as Fourier analysis , complex analysis , and multivariable calculus , the following does not even require single-variable calculus (although a single limit is taken at the end).  For a proof using the residue theorem , see the linked article.  History of this proof  The proof goes back to Augustin Louis Cauchy (Cours d'Analyse, 1821, Note VIII). In 1954, this proof appeared in the book of Akiva and Isaak Yaglom "Nonelementary Problems in an Elementary Exposition". Later, in 1982, it appeared in the journal Eureka , attributed to John Scholes, but Scholes claims he learned the proof from Peter Swinnerton-Dyer , and in any case he maintains the proof was "common knowledge at Cambridge in the late 1960s".  The proof  The main idea behind the proof is to bound the partial sums        ∑   k  =  1   m    1   k  2     =    1   1  2    +   1   2  2    +  ⋯  +   1   m  2           superscript   subscript     k  1    m     1   superscript  k  2         1   superscript  1  2      1   superscript  2  2    normal-⋯    1   superscript  m  2       \sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{1}{k^{2}}=\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{%
 m^{2}}     between two expressions, each of which will tend to   π   π   \pi    2 /6 as m approaches infinity. The two expressions are derived from identities involving the cotangent and cosecant functions. These identities are in turn derived from de Moivre's formula , and we now turn to establishing these identities.  Let   x   x   x   be a real number with     (    cot  x   +  i   )   n     superscript      x   i   n    \displaystyle(\cot x+i)^{n}     From the binomial theorem , we have         sin   (   n  x   )      (   sin  x   )   n    =   [      (     n      1     )     cot   n  -  1    x    -    (     n      3     )     cot   n  -  3    x     ±  ⋯   ]    .            n  x     superscript    x   n     delimited-[]   plus-or-minus       binomial  n  1     superscript     n  1    x       binomial  n  3     superscript     n  3    x     normal-⋯      \frac{\sin(nx)}{(\sin x)^{n}}=\left[{n\choose 1}\cot^{n-1}x-{n\choose 3}\cot^{%
 n-3}x\pm\cdots\right].     Combining the two equations and equating imaginary parts gives the identity     m   m   m     We take this identity, fix a positive integer    n  =    2  m   +   1        n      2  m   1     n=2m+1\,   , set     x  r   =    r  π     2  m   +  1         subscript  x  r       r  π       2  m   1      x_{r}=\frac{r\pi}{2m+1}   and consider    r  =   1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  m       r   1  2  normal-…  m     r=1,2,\ldots,m   for    n    x  r        n   subscript  x  r     nx_{r}\,   .

Packing squares with side 1/ n  The solution to the Basel problem is related to packing squares with side length of    S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   . The question that is asked is "What is the smallest rectangle that can contain the squares as n approaches infinity?" 3 One bound to the answer is dependent on one rectangle side,     S  1   =    1  2   +   1  3    =   5  6          subscript  S  1       1  2     1  3           5  6      S_{1}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{6}   , to be the sum of the largest two squares sides summed together,      S  2     subscript  S  2    S_{2}   .  The other rectangle side,    A  =    ∑   n  =  2   ∞    1   n  2     =     π  2   6   -  1         A    superscript   subscript     n  2        1   superscript  n  2               superscript  π  2   6   1      A=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}-1   , depends on the order of remaining squares. However, we know that total area, A , of the squares (minus the square with n=1) is:       S  2   =   A   S  1    =      π  2   6   -  1    5  6    =     π  2   -  6   5   =   0.77392088021  ⋯          subscript  S  2     A   subscript  S  1                superscript  π  2   6   1     5  6              superscript  π  2   6   5          0.77392088021  normal-⋯      S_{2}=\frac{A}{S_{1}}=\frac{\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}-1}{\frac{5}{6}}=\frac{\pi^{2}-6}%
 {5}=0.77392088021\cdots   .  Dividing the square's total area by the one known rectangle side leaves the ideal rectangle side length,  $$S_2 = \frac{A}{S_1} = \frac{\frac{\pi ^2}{6} - 1}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{\pi ^2 - 6}{5} = 0.77392088021 \cdots$$ .
