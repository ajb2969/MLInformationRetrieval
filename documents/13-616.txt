M-spline

In the mathematical subfield of numerical analysis, an M-spline12 is a non-negative spline function.

Definition
A family of M-spline functions of order k with n free parameters is defined by a set of knots t1  ≤ t2  ≤  ...  ≤  tn+k such that

t1 = ... = tk
tn+1 = ... = tn+k
ti i+k for all i

The family includes n members indexed by i = 1,...,n.
Properties
An M-spline Mi(x|k, t) has the following mathematical properties

Mi(x|k, t) is non-negative


Mi(x|k, t) is zero unless ti ≤ x i+k


Mi(x|k, t) has k − 2 continuous derivatives at interior knots tk+1, ..., tn−1


Mi(x|k, t) integrates to 1

Computation
M-splines can be efficiently and stably computed using the following recursions:
For k = 1,



if ti ≤ x i+1, and Mi(x|1,t) = 0 otherwise.
For k > 1,



Applications
M-splines can be integrated to produce a family of monotone splines called I-splines. M-splines can also be used directly as basis splines for regression analysis involving positive response data (constraining the regression coefficients to be non-negative).
