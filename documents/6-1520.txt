   Noetherian topological space      Noetherian topological space   In mathematics , a Noetherian topological space is a topological space in which closed subsets satisfy the descending chain condition . Equivalently, we could say that the open subsets satisfy the ascending chain condition , since they are the complements of the closed subsets. It can also be shown to be equivalent that every open subset of such a space is compact , and in fact the seemingly stronger statement that every subset is compact.  Definition  A topological space    X   X   X   is called Noetherian if it satisfies the descending chain condition for closed subsets : for any sequence       Y  1   ‚äá   Y  2   ‚äá  ‚ãØ       superset-of-or-equals   subscript  Y  1    subscript  Y  2     superset-of-or-equals    normal-‚ãØ     Y_{1}\supseteq Y_{2}\supseteq\cdots     of closed subsets    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   of   X   X   X   , there is an integer    m   m   m   such that      Y  m   =   Y   m  +  1    =  ‚ãØ   .         subscript  Y  m    subscript  Y    m  1         normal-‚ãØ     Y_{m}=Y_{m+1}=\cdots.     Relation to compactness  The Noetherian condition can be seen as a strong compactness condition:   Every Noetherian topological space is compact.  A topological space   X   X   X   is Noetherian if and only if every subspace of   X   X   X   is compact. (i.e.   X   X   X   is hereditarily compact).   Noetherian topological spaces from algebraic geometry  Many examples of Noetherian topological spaces come from algebraic geometry , where for the Zariski topology an irreducible set has the intuitive property that any closed proper subset has smaller dimension. Since dimension can only 'jump down' a finite number of times, and algebraic sets are made up of finite unions of irreducible sets, descending chains of Zariski closed sets must eventually be constant.  A more algebraic way to see this is that the associated ideals defining algebraic sets must satisfy the ascending chain condition . That follows because the rings of algebraic geometry, in the classical sense, are Noetherian rings . This class of examples therefore also explains the name.  If R is a commutative Noetherian ring, then Spec( R ), the prime spectrum of R , is a Noetherian topological space. More generally, a Noetherian scheme is a Noetherian topological space. The converse does not hold, since Spec( R ) of a one-dimensional valuation domain R consists of exactly two points and therefore is Noetherian, but there are examples of such rings which are not Noetherian.  Example  The space    ùî∏  k  n     subscript   superscript  ùî∏  n   k    \mathbb{A}^{n}_{k}   (affine   n   n   n   -space over a field    k   k   k   ) under the Zariski topology is an example of a Noetherian topological space. By properties of the ideal of a subset of    ùî∏  k  n     subscript   superscript  ùî∏  n   k    \mathbb{A}^{n}_{k}   , we know that if       Y  1   ‚äá   Y  2   ‚äá   Y  3   ‚äá  ‚ãØ       superset-of-or-equals   subscript  Y  1    subscript  Y  2     superset-of-or-equals     subscript  Y  3     superset-of-or-equals    normal-‚ãØ     Y_{1}\supseteq Y_{2}\supseteq Y_{3}\supseteq\cdots     is a descending chain of Zariski-closed subsets, then       I   (   Y  1   )    ‚äÜ   I   (   Y  2   )    ‚äÜ   I   (   Y  3   )    ‚äÜ  ‚ãØ          I   subscript  Y  1      I   subscript  Y  2           I   subscript  Y  3         normal-‚ãØ     I(Y_{1})\subseteq I(Y_{2})\subseteq I(Y_{3})\subseteq\cdots     is an ascending chain of ideals of     k   [   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]    .      k    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n      k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}].   Since    k   [   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]       k    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n      k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]   is a Noetherian ring, there exists an integer   m   m   m   such that        I   (   Y  m   )    =   I   (   Y   m  +  1    )    =   I   (   Y   m  +  2    )    =  ‚ãØ   .          I   subscript  Y  m      I   subscript  Y    m  1            I   subscript  Y    m  2          normal-‚ãØ     I(Y_{m})=I(Y_{m+1})=I(Y_{m+2})=\cdots.     Since    V   (   I   (  Y  )    )       V    I  Y     V(I(Y))   is the closure of Y for all Y ,     V   (   I   (   Y  i   )    )    =   Y  i         V    I   subscript  Y  i      subscript  Y  i     V(I(Y_{i}))=Y_{i}   for all    i  .    i   i.   Hence       Y  m   =   Y   m  +  1    =   Y   m  +  2    =  ‚ãØ         subscript  Y  m    subscript  Y    m  1          subscript  Y    m  2         normal-‚ãØ     Y_{m}=Y_{m+1}=Y_{m+2}=\cdots   as required.
