   3-hydroxyoctanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) dehydratase      3-hydroxyoctanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) dehydratase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3R)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oct-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3R)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) , and two products , oct-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3R)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydro-lyase (oct-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein]-forming) . Other names in common use include D-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-[acyl carrier protein] dehydratase , D-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase , beta-hydroxyoctanoyl-acyl carrier protein dehydrase , beta-hydroxyoctanoyl thioester dehydratase , beta-hydroxyoctanoyl-ACP-dehydrase , and (3R)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydro-lyase .
