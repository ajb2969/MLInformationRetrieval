Draft:GHz Frequency Ultrasonic Interferometry

Introduction
GHz frequency ultrasonic interferometry (GHz ultrasonics) is a powerful technique primarily used in material science and earth science, to determine adiabatic bulk moduli, 
 
 
 
 , and shear moduli, G, from longitudinal wave, 
 
 
 
 , and transverse wave, 
 
 
 
 , velocities. Advantages of GHz ultrasonics include small sample size capabilities, high precision, and the ability to measure opaque materials.
The technique measures acoustic wave propagation velocities to determine material elastic properties. The acoustic waves are of frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 GHz, approximately 1-10 micrometers wavelength, which allow for very small samples, 100 micrometer thickness, to be measured. The small scale sample measuring capabilities of GHz ultrasonics makes it an invaluable technique for determining elastic properties of rare single crystal and glass samples. This is an advantageous quality due to the scarcity of many materials of interest such as deep earth minerals and super hard materials. The small sample size capabilities also makes GHz ultrasonics a popular technique in mineral physics where materials at very high pressure are often studied. In order to obtain high pressures very small samples must be used. These experiments are often performed in diamond anvil cells.
The technique is also unique in its ability to measure elastic properties of opaque materials. Unlike GHz ultrasonics, elastic property measuring techniques such as Brillouin spectroscopy require the sample to be transparent to visible light. This is often a problem when studying ceramics or basaltic minerals. Acoustic waves, however, do not require visible transparency to propagate.
Instrumentation
Most GHz ultrasonics systems are composed of three primary components. The first component, the radio frequency (RF) generator and pulse generator, creates the RF signal and chops it into phase coherent packets. The second component, the digitizing oscilloscope with GHz bandwidth, samples the signal with picosecond resolution providing extreme sensitivity of low amplitude signals. The third primary component is the buffer rod. The buffer rod consists of a cylindrical oriented single crystal polished to a small flat tip with a GHz transducer on the opposing end. The transducer consists of a piezoelectric material which creates a compressional wave when excited by an electrical signal. The compressional wave then travels through the buffer rod into the sample.
For atmospheric measurements, a polished sample is carefully aligned with the BR so the surfaces are as parallel as possible. If the surfaces are not parallel the wave will not be efficiently transmitted between the BR and the sample. Also, if the surfaces are not parallel the wave can be refracted at some unknown angle into the sample as opposed to propagating perpendicularly to the surfaces.
Next, an acoustic wave packet is sent from transducer through the BR into the sample. The first signal received by the transducer is the echo from the BR-sample interface (BR echo). The next signal recorded is the sample’s free surface (S1 echo), the sample-atmosphere interface. The time between the BR echo and the S1 echo can then be measured. Compressional wave velocity will then be equal to sample length divided by one half of the travel time.
This technique however, can only produce a rough two way travel time. In order to measure a more precise travel time the wave pulse width can be increased such that the BR echo interferes with the phase coherent S1 echo. In this interferometry mode, the amplitude of the interference pattern is then measured across a range of frequencies, from 0.3-1.3 GHz for example.1
The maximum and minimum of the interference pattern are then identified with each maximum or minimum corresponding to a specific condition. At a high impedance to low impedance interface a π radians phase shift will always occur for a plane stress wave. Also, for specific frequencies an integer or half integer number of wavelengths will be within twice the sample length corresponding to a maximum or minimum in the interference pattern. If there are an integral number of wavelengths, there will be a phase shift between two consecutive echoes of π radians and destructive interference will occur resulting in a minimum amplitude condition. If there are a half integer number of wavelengths, the interfering sinusoidal waves will be in phase, constructively interfering, resulting in a maximum amplitude condition.2
The frequency difference between two consecutive maxima or minima will then yield the travel time, 
 
 
 
 , according to:

One large assumption that is made during these measurements is that wave velocity does not vary significantly with frequency in a material. The accuracy of this assumption is debatable especially over a frequency range of GHz.
It is also possible perform in situ GHz ultrasonics measurements under extreme conditions using a diamond anvil cell. The cell can be used to replicate pressures conditions of 300 km depth and hundreds of degrees Celsius. The pressure is primarily limited by sample size while maximum temperature is limited by heater design. A resistive heater must be used as opposed to laser heating which would greatly increase the achievable temperature range. The resistive heating design, however, does provide a sample environment with only low temperature gradients which is highly beneficial.
High pressure GHz ultrasonics measurements can be made by aligning the BR with the diamond table of a diamond anvil cell as opposed to the sample directly. In this case, the diamond culet-sample interface echo acts as the BR-sample echo3.

Applications
Mineral physics and material science are the primary fields of study where GHz ultrasonic techniques are utilized. Many mineral physics measurements have been made using GHz ultrasonics. The technique is ideal for nearly opaque iron oxides where Brillouin spectroscopy struggles. 456
The ultra-high precision of GHz ultrasonic measurements has made it a valuable technique when studying super hard materials where error of only a few percent can result in wave propagation velocity errors on the order of kilometers per second. Recently the velocities of nanopolycrystalin diamond have been measured to an accuracy of +/- 5 m/s7.
