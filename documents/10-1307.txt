   Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating)      Methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating)   In enzymology , a methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate + CoA + H 2 O + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   propanoyl-CoA + HCO 3 - + NADH   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate , CoA , H 2 O , and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are propanoyl-CoA , HCO3- , and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate:NAD+ 3-oxidoreductase (CoA-propanoylating) . Other names in common use include MSDH , and MMSA dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : inositol metabolism , valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation , and propanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
