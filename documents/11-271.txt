   Capsular-polysaccharide-transporting ATPase      Capsular-polysaccharide-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a capsular-polysaccharide-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + capsular polysaccharidein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + capsular polysaccharideout   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and capsular polysaccharide , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and capsular polysaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (capsular-polysaccharide-exporting) .  References         "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
