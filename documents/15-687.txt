Local language (formal language)

In mathematics, a local language is a formal language for which membership of a word in the language can be determined by looking at a "window" of length two.1 Equivalently, it is a language recognised by a local automaton, a class of deterministic finite automaton.2
Formally, we define a language L over an alphabet A to be local if there are subsets R and S of A and a subset F of AÃ—A such that a word w is in L if and only if the first letter of w is in R, the last letter of w is in S and no factor of length 2 in w is in F.3 This corresponds to the regular expression45



More generally, a k-testable language L is one for which membership of a word w in L depends only on the prefix, suffix and the set of factors of w of length k; a language is locally testable if it is k-testable for some k.6 A local language is 2-testable.7
Examples

Over the alphabet {a,b}8




Properties

The family of local languages over A is closed under intersection and Kleene star, but not complement, union or concatenation.9
Every regular language not containing the empty string is the image of a local language under a strictly alphabetic morphism.101112
