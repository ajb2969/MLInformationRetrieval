   Alpha-ribazole phosphatase      Alpha-ribazole phosphatase   In enzymology , an alpha-ribazole phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   alpha-ribazole 5'-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-ribazole + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-ribazole 5'-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are alpha-ribazole and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-ribazole-5'-phosphate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called CobC . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 16 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
