   Methylarsonate reductase      Methylarsonate reductase   In enzymology , a methylarsonate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methylarsonate + 2 glutathione   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methylarsonite + glutathione disulfide + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methylarsonate and glutathione , whereas its 3 products are methylarsonite , glutathione disulfide , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donor with disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is gluthathione:methylarsonate oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called MMA(V) reductase .
