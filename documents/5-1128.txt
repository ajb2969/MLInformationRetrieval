Radical of an integer

In number theory, the radical of a positive integer n is defined as the product of the distinct prime numbers dividing n (each prime factor of n occurs exactly once as a factor of the product mentioned):



Examples
Radical numbers for the first few positive integers are

1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 10, ... .
 

For example,



and therefore



Properties
The function 
 
 
 
  is multiplicative (but not completely multiplicative).
The radical of any integer n is the largest square-free divisor of n and so also described as the square-free kernel of n.1 The definition is generalized to the largest t-free divisor of n, 
 
 
 
 , which are multiplicative functions which act on prime powers as



The cases t=3 and t=4 are tabulated in  and .
One of the most striking applications of the notion of radical occurs in the abc conjecture, which states that, for any ε > 0, there exists a finite Kε such that, for all triples of coprime positive integers a, b, and c satisfying a + b = c,



Furthermore, it can be shown that the nilpotent elements of 
 
 
 
  are all of the multiples of rad(n).
