   Radical of an integer      Radical of an integer   In number theory , the radical of a positive  integer  n is defined as the product of the distinct prime numbers dividing n (each prime factor of n occurs exactly once as a factor of the product mentioned):       rad   (  n  )    =    ∏       p  ∣  n        p  prime        p         rad  n     subscript  product   STACKED   fragments  p  normal-∣  n     p  prime     p     \displaystyle\mathrm{rad}(n)=\prod_{\scriptstyle p\mid n\atop p\text{ prime}}p     Examples  Radical numbers for the first few positive integers are   1 , 2 , 3 , 2, 5 , 6 , 7 , 2, 3, 10 , ... .   For example,      504  =    2  3   ⋅   3  2   ⋅  7       504   normal-⋅   superscript  2  3    superscript  3  2   7     504=2^{3}\cdot 3^{2}\cdot 7     and therefore       rad   (  504  )    =   2  ⋅  3  ⋅  7   =  42          rad  504    normal-⋅  2  3  7        42     \mathrm{rad}(504)=2\cdot 3\cdot 7=42     Properties  The function   rad   rad   \mathrm{rad}   is multiplicative (but not completely multiplicative ).  The radical of any integer n is the largest square-free divisor of n and so also described as the square-free kernel of n . 1 The definition is generalized to the largest t -free divisor of n ,    rad  t     subscript  rad  t    \mathrm{rad}_{t}   , which are multiplicative functions which act on prime powers as        rad  t    (   p  e   )    =   p   min   (  e  ,   t  -  1   )            subscript  rad  t    superscript  p  e     superscript  p    min   e    t  1        \mathrm{rad}_{t}(p^{e})=p^{\mathrm{min}(e,t-1)}     The cases t =3 and t =4 are tabulated in  and .  One of the most striking applications of the notion of radical occurs in the abc conjecture , which states that, for any ε > 0, there exists a finite K ε such that, for all triples of coprime positive integers a , b , and c satisfying a + b = c ,      c  <    K  ε    rad    (  a  b  c  )    1  +  ε       fragments  c    subscript  K  ε   rad   superscript   fragments  normal-(  a  b  c  normal-)     1  ε      c     Furthermore, it can be shown that the nilpotent elements of     ℤ  /  n   ℤ        ℤ  n   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}   are all of the multiples of rad( n ).
