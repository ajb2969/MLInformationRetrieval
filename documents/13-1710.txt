Zeta function (operator)

The zeta function of a mathematical operator

 
  is a function defined as



for those values of s where this expression exists, and as an analytic continuation of this function for other values of s. Here "tr" denotes a functional trace.
The zeta function may also be expressible as a spectral zeta function1 in terms of the eigenvalues

 
  of the operator 
 
 
 
 
  by


 
 .
It is used in giving a rigorous definition to the functional determinant of an operator, which is given by



The Minakshisundaram–Pleijel zeta function is an example, when the operator is the Laplacian of a compact Riemannian manifold.
One of the most important motivations for Arakelov theory is the zeta functions for operators with the method of heat kernels generalized algebro-geometrically.2
