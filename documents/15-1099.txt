   FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase      FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase   FAD-dependent urate hydroxylase (, HpxO enzyme , FAD-dependent urate oxidase , urate hydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name urate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (5-hydroxyisourate forming) . 1  2 A non-homologous isofunctional enzyme (NISE) to HpxO was found, and named HpyO. 3 HpyO was determined to be a typical Michaelian enzyme. These FAD-dependent urate hydroxylases are flavoproteins.  This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   urate + NADH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    5-hydroxyisourate + NAD + + H 2 O   References  External links     "  Category:EC 1.14.13     ↩  ↩  ↩
