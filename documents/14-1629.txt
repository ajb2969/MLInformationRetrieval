Non-local means

Non-local means is an algorithm in image processing for image denoising. Unlike "local mean" filters, which take the mean value of a group of pixels surrounding a target pixel to smooth the image, non-local means filtering takes a mean of all pixels in the image, weighted by how similar these pixels are to the target pixel. This results in much greater post-filtering clarity, and less loss of detail in the image compared with local mean algorithms.1
If compared with other well-known denoising techniques, such as the Gaussian smoothing model, the anisotropic diffusion model, the total variation denoising, the neighborhood filters and an elegant variant, the Wiener local empirical filter, the translation invariant wavelet thresholding, the non-local means method noise looks more like white noise.2 Recently non-local means has been extended to other image processing applications such as deinterlacing3 and view interpolation.4
Definition
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is the area of an image, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two points within the image. Then, the algorithm is:5



where 
 
 
 
  is the filtered value of the image at point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the unfiltered value of the image at point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the weighting function, and the integral is evaluated over 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is a normalizing factor, given by:



Common weighting functions
The purpose of the weighting function, 
 
 
 
 , is to determine how closely related the image at the point 
 
 
 
  is to the image at the point 
 
 
 
 . It can take many forms.
Gaussian
The Gaussian weighting function sets up a normal distribution with a mean, 
 
 
 
  and a variable standard deviation:6



where 
 
 
 
  is the filtering parameter (i.e., standard deviation) and 
 
 
 
  is the local mean value of the image point values surrounding 
 
 

Discrete algorithm
For an image, 
 
 
 
 , with discrete pixels, a discrete algorithm is required.



where 
 
 
 
  is given by:



Then, for a Gaussian weighting function,



where 
 
 
 
  is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  and is a square region of pixels surrounding 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the number of pixels in the region 
 
 
 
 .
