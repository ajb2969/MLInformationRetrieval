   Lévy's modulus of continuity theorem      Lévy's modulus of continuity theorem   In mathematics , Lévy's modulus of continuity theorem gives a result about the almost sure behaviour of an estimate of the modulus of continuity for the Wiener process , which models Brownian motion . It is due to the French mathematician Paul Lévy .  Statement of the result  Let    B  :     [  0  ,  1  ]   ×  Ω   →  ℝ      normal-:  B   normal-→     0  1   normal-Ω   ℝ     B:[0,1]\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}   be a standard Wiener process. Then, almost surely ,        lim   h  →  0      sup   0  ≤  t  ≤   1  -  h       |    B   t  +  h    -   B  t    |     2  h   log   (   1  /  h   )         =  1.        subscript    normal-→  h  0      subscript  supremum      0  t         1  h             subscript  B    t  h     subscript  B  t         2  h      1  h         1.    \lim_{h\to 0}\sup_{0\leq t\leq 1-h}\frac{|B_{t+h}-B_{t}|}{\sqrt{2h\log(1/h)}}=1.     In other words, the sample paths of Brownian motion have modulus of continuity        ω  B    (  δ  )    =    2  δ   log   (   1  /  δ   )             subscript  ω  B   δ       2  δ      1  δ        \omega_{B}(\delta)=\sqrt{2\delta\log(1/\delta)}     with probability one, and for sufficiently small    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   .
