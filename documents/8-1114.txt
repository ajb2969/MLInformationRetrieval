Lévy's modulus of continuity theorem

In mathematics, Lévy's modulus of continuity theorem gives a result about the almost sure behaviour of an estimate of the modulus of continuity for the Wiener process, which models Brownian motion. It is due to the French mathematician Paul Lévy.
Statement of the result
Let 
 
 
 
  be a standard Wiener process. Then, almost surely,



In other words, the sample paths of Brownian motion have modulus of continuity



with probability one, and for sufficiently small 
 
 
 
 
 .
