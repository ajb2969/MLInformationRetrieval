   Surface wave magnitude      Surface wave magnitude   The surface wave magnitude (     M  s     subscript  M  s    M_{s}    ) scale is one of the magnitude scales used in seismology to describe the size of an earthquake . It is based on measurements in Rayleigh surface waves that travel primarily along the uppermost layers of the earth. It is currently used in People's Republic of China as a national standard ( GB 17740-1999 ) for categorising earthquakes. 1  Surface wave magnitude was initially developed in 1950s by the same researchers who developed the local magnitude scale M L in order to improve resolution on larger earthquakes: 2  Recorded magnitudes of earthquakes during that time, commonly attributed to Richter , could be either    M  s     subscript  M  s    M_{s}   or    M  L     subscript  M  L    M_{L}   .  Definition  The formula to calculate surface wave magnitude is: 3 4     M  =   log  10     (   A  T   )   max   +  σ   (  Δ  )      fragments  M    subscript   10    subscript   fragments  normal-(    A  T   normal-)   max    σ   fragments  normal-(  Δ  normal-)     M=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A}{T}\right)_{\text{max}}+\sigma(\Delta)     where A is the maximum particle displacement in surface waves ( vector sum of the two horizontal displacements) in μm , T is the corresponding period in s , Δ is the epicentral distance in ° , and       σ   (  Δ  )    =    1.66  ⋅    log  10    (  Δ  )     +  3.5         σ  normal-Δ      normal-⋅  1.66    subscript   10   normal-Δ    3.5     \sigma(\Delta)=1.66\cdot\log_{10}(\Delta)+3.5     According to GB 17740-1999, the two horizontal displacements must be measured at the same time or within 1/8 of a period; if the two displacements have different periods, weighed sum must be used:      T  =      T  N    A  N    +    T  E    A  E       A  N   +   A  E         T         subscript  T  N    subscript  A  N       subscript  T  E    subscript  A  E        subscript  A  N    subscript  A  E       T=\frac{T_{N}A_{N}+T_{E}A_{E}}{A_{N}+A_{E}}     where A N is the north-south displacement in μm,　A E is the east-west displacement in μm,　T N is the period corresponding to A N in s, and T E is the period corresponding to A E in s.  Other studies  Vladimír Tobyáš and Reinhard Mittag proposed to relate surface wave magnitude to local magnitude scale M L , using 5       M  s   =    -  3.2   +   1.45   M  L          subscript  M  s       3.2     1.45   subscript  M  L       M_{s}=-3.2+1.45M_{L}     Other formulas include three revised formulae proposed by CHEN Junjie et al.: 6       M  s   =     log  10    (    A   m  a  x    T   )    +   1.54  ⋅    log  10    (  Δ  )     +  3.53        subscript  M  s       subscript   10      subscript  A    m  a  x    T     normal-⋅  1.54    subscript   10   normal-Δ    3.53     M_{s}=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_{max}}{T}\right)+1.54\cdot\log_{10}(\Delta)+3.53          M  s   =     log  10    (    A   m  a  x    T   )    +   1.73  ⋅    log  10    (  Δ  )     +  3.27        subscript  M  s       subscript   10      subscript  A    m  a  x    T     normal-⋅  1.73    subscript   10   normal-Δ    3.27     M_{s}=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_{max}}{T}\right)+1.73\cdot\log_{10}(\Delta)+3.27     and       M  s   =      log  10    (    A   m  a  x    T   )    -   6.2  ⋅    log  10    (  Δ  )      +  20.6        subscript  M  s         subscript   10      subscript  A    m  a  x    T     normal-⋅  6.2    subscript   10   normal-Δ     20.6     M_{s}=\log_{10}\left(\frac{A_{max}}{T}\right)-6.2\cdot\log_{10}(\Delta)+20.6     See also   Moment magnitude scale  Seismic scale   Notes and references  External links    Visual Glossary - magnitude - USGS  Earthquake Size  Surface wave magnitude calculator   "  Category:Seismic scales     ↩   ↩   It is obvious that the entire formula cannot stand dimensional analysis without additional qualifications.
