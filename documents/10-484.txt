   D-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase      D-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a D-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-arabinitol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribulose + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-arabinitol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-ribulose , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinitol:NAD + 2-oxidoreductase (D-ribulose-forming) . This enzyme is also called D-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase (ribulose-forming) .
