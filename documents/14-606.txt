Nearly Kähler manifold

In mathematics, a nearly Kähler manifold is an almost Hermitian manifold

 
 , with almost complex structure

 
 , such that the (2,1)-tensor 
 
 
 
  is skew-symmetric. So,



for every vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 .
In particular, a Kähler manifold is nearly Kähler. The converse is not true. The nearly Kähler six-sphere 
 
 
 
  is an example of a nearly Kähler manifold that is not Kähler.1 The familiar almost complex structure on the six-sphere is not induced by a complex atlas on 
 
 
 
 . Usually, non Kählerian nearly Kähler manifolds are called "strict nearly Kähler manifolds". Nearly Kähler manifolds, also known as almost Tachibana manifolds, were studied by Shun-ichi Tachibana in 19592 and then by Alfred Gray from 1970 on.3 For example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold is an Einstein manifold and has vanishing first Chern class (in particular, this implies spin). In the 1980s, strict nearly Kähler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to Killing spinors: Thomas Friedrich and Ralf Grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold admits a Riemannian Killing spinor if and only if it is nearly Kähler.4 The only known 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifolds are
 
 
 
 . In fact, these are the only homogeneous nearly Kähler manifolds in dimension six.5 In applications, it is apparent that nearly Kähler manifolds are most interesting in dimension 6; in 2002. Paul-Andi Nagy proved that indeed any strict and complete nearly Kähler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly Kähler spaces, twistor spaces over Kähler manifolds and 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds.6 Nearly Kähler manifolds are an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with parallel totally antisymmetric torsion7
A nearly Kähler manifold should not be confused with an almost Kähler manifold. An almost Kähler manifold 
 
 
 
  is an almost Hermitian manifold with a closed Kähler form: 
 
 
 
 . The Kähler form or fundamental 2-form 
 
 
 
  is defined by



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the metric on 
 
 
 
 . The nearly Kähler condition and the almost Kähler condition are mutually exclusive.
