   Nearly Kähler manifold      Nearly Kähler manifold   In mathematics, a nearly Kähler manifold is an almost Hermitian manifold    M   M   M   , with almost complex structure    J   J   J   , such that the (2,1)-tensor    ∇  J     normal-∇  J    \nabla J   is skew-symmetric . So,        (    ∇  X   J   )   X   =   0           subscript  normal-∇  X   J   X   0    (\nabla_{X}J)X=0\,     for every vector field   X   X   X   on   M   M   M   .  In particular, a Kähler manifold is nearly Kähler. The converse is not true. The nearly Kähler six-sphere    S  6     superscript  S  6    S^{6}   is an example of a nearly Kähler manifold that is not Kähler. 1 The familiar almost complex structure on the six-sphere is not induced by a complex atlas on    S  6     superscript  S  6    S^{6}   . Usually, non Kählerian nearly Kähler manifolds are called "strict nearly Kähler manifolds". Nearly Kähler manifolds, also known as almost Tachibana manifolds, were studied by Shun-ichi Tachibana in 1959 2 and then by Alfred Gray from 1970 on. 3 For example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold is an Einstein manifold and has vanishing first Chern class (in particular, this implies spin). In the 1980s, strict nearly Kähler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to Killing spinors : Thomas Friedrich and Ralf Grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold admits a Riemannian Killing spinor if and only if it is nearly Kähler. 4 The only known 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifolds are     S  6   =      G  2   /  S   U   (  3  )    ,       S  p   (  2  )    /  S   U   (  2  )    ×  U    (  1  )    ,       S  U   (  3  )    /  U    (  1  )    ×  U    (  1  )    ,    S  3   ×   S  3          superscript  S  6         subscript  G  2   S   U  3             S  p  2   S   U  2   U   1             S  U  3   U   1   U   1      superscript  S  3    superscript  S  3       S^{6}=G_{2}/SU(3),Sp(2)/SU(2)\times U(1),SU(3)/U(1)\times U(1),S^{3}\times S^{3}   . In fact, these are the only homogeneous nearly Kähler manifolds in dimension six. 5 In applications, it is apparent that nearly Kähler manifolds are most interesting in dimension 6; in 2002. Paul-Andi Nagy proved that indeed any strict and complete nearly Kähler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly Kähler spaces, twistor spaces over Kähler manifolds and 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds. 6 Nearly Kähler manifolds are an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with parallel totally antisymmetric torsion 7  A nearly Kähler manifold should not be confused with an almost Kähler manifold . An almost Kähler manifold   M   M   M   is an almost Hermitian manifold with a closed Kähler form :     d  ω   =  0        d  ω   0    d\omega=0   . The Kähler form or fundamental 2-form   ω   ω   \omega   is defined by        ω   (  X  ,  Y  )    =   g   (   J  X   ,  Y  )     ,        ω   X  Y      g     J  X   Y      \omega(X,Y)=g(JX,Y),\,     where   g   g   g   is the metric on   M   M   M   . The nearly Kähler condition and the almost Kähler condition are mutually exclusive.  References  "  Category:Topology  Category:Differential geometry  Category:Manifolds     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
