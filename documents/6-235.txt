   Plastic number      Plastic number          Binary     Decimal     Hexadecimal     Continued fraction 1     Algebraic form     In mathematics , the plastic number  ρ (also known as the plastic constant or the minimal Pisot number ) is a mathematical constant which is the unique real solution of the cubic equation       x  3   =   x  +  1 .        superscript  x  3     x  1 .     x^{3}=x+1\,.     It has the exact value 2         ρ  =       108  +   12   69     3   +    108  -   12   69     3    6     .      ρ         3     108    12    69         3     108    12    69       6     \rho=\frac{\sqrt[3]{108+12\sqrt{69}}+\sqrt[3]{108-12\sqrt{69}}}{6}\,.        Its decimal expansion begins with . 3 and at least 10,000,000,000 decimal digits have been computed. 4  The plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio     1  +   2       1    2     1+\sqrt{2}   .  Properties  The powers of the plastic number A ( n ) = ρ n satisfy the recurrence relation A ( n ) = A ( n − 2) + A ( n − 3) for n > 2. Hence it is the limiting ratio of successive terms of any (non-zero) integer sequence satisfying this recurrence such as the Padovan sequence and the Perrin sequence , and bears the same relationship to these sequences as the golden ratio does to the Fibonacci sequence and the silver ratio does to the Pell numbers .  Because the plastic number has minimal polynomial  0,}} it is also a solution of the polynomial equation p ( x ) = 0 for every polynomial p that is a multiple of but not for any other polynomials with integer coefficients. Since the discriminant of minimal polynomial is -23, its splitting field over rationals is    ℚ   (    -  23    ,  ρ  )       ℚ       23    ρ     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-23},\rho)   . This field is also Hilbert class field of    ℚ   (    -  23    )       ℚ      23      \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-23})   .  The plastic number satisfies the nested radical recurrence: 5       ρ  =     1  +    1  +    1  +  ⋯   3    3    3     .      ρ     3     1     3     1     3     1  normal-⋯          \rho=\sqrt[3]{1+\sqrt[3]{1+\sqrt[3]{1+\cdots}}}\,.     The plastic number is the smallest Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number . Its algebraic conjugates are          (    -   1  2    ±     3   2   i    )      1  2   +    1  6     23  3      3    +    (    -   1  2    ∓     3   2   i    )      1  2   -    1  6     23  3      3     ≈    -  0.662359   ±   0.56228  i     ,           plus-or-minus      1  2          3   2   i       3       1  2       1  6       23  3           minus-or-plus      1  2          3   2   i       3       1  2       1  6       23  3          plus-or-minus    0.662359     0.56228  i      \left(-\frac{1}{2}\pm\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\right)\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6%

 \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{\frac{23}{3}}}\approx-0.662359\pm 0.56228i,   of absolute value ≈ 0.868837 . This value is also    1   ρ       1    ρ     \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}   because the product of the three roots of the minimal polynomial is 1.  The plastic number can be written using the Hyperbolic cosine and its inverse:        ρ  =     1  c     cosh   (     1  3      cosh   -  1     (   3  c   )     )      ,   c  =   cos   (     2  π   12    )    =   sin   (     2  π   6    )    =      3   2       .     formulae-sequence    ρ      1  c         1  3     superscript     1      3  c            c        2  π   12               2  π   6             3   2       \rho=\tfrac{1}{c}\cosh\left(\tfrac{1}{3}\cosh^{-1}(3c)\right),\qquad c=\cos%

History  The name plastic number ( het plastische getal in Dutch ) was given to this number in 1928 by Dom Hans van der Laan. Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio , the word plastic was not intended to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. 6 This is because, according to Padovan, the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another.
