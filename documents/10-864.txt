Reprojection error

The reprojection error is a geometric error corresponding to the image distance between a projected point and a measured one. It is used to quantify how closely an estimate of a 3D point 
 
 
 
  recreates the point's true projection 
 
 
 
 . More precisely, let 
 
 
 
  be the projection matrix of a camera and 
 
 
 
  be the image projection of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 . The reprojection error of 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Euclidean distance between the image points represented by vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Minimizing the reprojection error can be used for estimating the error from point correspondences between two images. Suppose we are given 2D to 2D point imperfect correspondences 
 
 
 
 . We wish to find a homography

 
  and pairs of perfectly matched points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , i.e. points that satisfy 
 
 
 
  that minimize the reprojection error function given by


 
  So the correspondences can be interpreted as imperfect images of a world point and the reprojection error quantifies their deviation from the true image projections
