<h1>Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In the <a href="foundations_of_mathematics" title="wikilink">foundations of mathematics</a>, <strong>von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory</strong> (<strong>NBG</strong>) is an <a href="axiomatic_set_theory" title="wikilink">axiomatic set theory</a> that is a <a href="conservative_extension" title="wikilink">conservative extension</a> of the canonical <a href="Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> (ZFC). A statement in the language of ZFC is provable in NBG <a href="if_and_only_if" title="wikilink">if and only if</a> it is provable in ZFC. The <a class="uri" href="ontology" title="wikilink">ontology</a> of NBG includes <a href="proper_class" title="wikilink">proper classes</a>, objects having members but that cannot be members of other entities. NBG's principle of <a href="axiom_of_comprehension" title="wikilink">class comprehension</a> is <a href="impredicativity" title="wikilink">predicative</a>; <a href="Quantifier_(logic)" title="wikilink">quantified</a> variables in the defining <a href="first_order_logic" title="wikilink">formula</a> can range only over sets. Allowing <a href="impredicativity" title="wikilink">impredicative</a> comprehension turns NBG into <a href="Morse-Kelley_set_theory" title="wikilink">Morse-Kelley set theory</a> (MK). NBG, unlike ZFC and MK, can be <a href="finite_set" title="wikilink">finitely</a> axiomatized.</p>
<h2 id="ontology">Ontology</h2>

<p>The defining aspect of NBG is the distinction between <a href="proper_class" title="wikilink">proper class</a> and <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a>. Let <em>a</em> and <em>s</em> be two individuals. Then the <a href="atomic_sentence" title="wikilink">atomic sentence</a>

 is defined if <em>a</em> is a set and <em>s</em> is a <a href="class_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">class</a>. In other words,

 is defined unless <em>a</em> is a proper class. A proper class is very large; NBG even admits of "the class of all sets", the universal class called <em>V</em>. However, NBG does not admit "the class of all classes" (which fails because proper classes are not "objects" that can be put into classes in NBG) or "the set of all sets" (whose existence cannot be justified with NBG axioms).</p>

<p>By NBG's axiom schema of Class Comprehension, all objects satisfying any given formula in the <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order language</a> of NBG form a class; if a class is not a set in <a class="uri" href="ZFC" title="wikilink">ZFC</a>, it is an NBG proper class.</p>

<p>The development of classes mirrors the development of <a href="naive_set_theory" title="wikilink">naive set theory</a>. The principle of abstraction is given, and thus classes can be formed out of all individuals satisfying any statement of <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order logic</a> whose <a href="atomic_sentence" title="wikilink">atomic sentences</a> all involve either the membership relation or predicates definable from membership. Equality, pairing, subclass, and such, are all definable and so need not be axiomatized — their definitions denote a particular <a class="uri" href="abstraction" title="wikilink">abstraction</a> of a <a class="uri" href="formula" title="wikilink">formula</a>.</p>

<p>Sets are developed in a manner very similarly to ZF. Let <em>Rp</em>(<em>A,a</em>), meaning "the set <em>a</em> represents the class <em>A</em>," denote a <a href="binary_relation" title="wikilink">binary relation</a> defined as follows:</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>In two articles published in 1925 and 1928, <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">John von Neumann</a> stated his axioms and showed they were adequate to develop set theory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Von Neumann took functions and arguments as <a href="Primitive_notion" title="wikilink">primitives</a>. His functions correspond to classes, and functions that can be used as arguments correspond to sets. In fact, he defined classes and sets using functions that can take only two values (that is, <a href="indicator_function" title="wikilink">indicator functions</a> whose domain is the class of all arguments).</p>

<p>Von Neumann's work in set theory was influenced by <a href="Georg_Cantor" title="wikilink">Cantor</a>'s articles, <a href="Zermelo_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo's 1908 axioms for set theory</a>, and the 1922 critiques of Zermelo's set theory that were given independently by <a href="Abraham_Fraenkel" title="wikilink">Fraenkel</a> and <a href="Thoralf_Skolem" title="wikilink">Skolem</a>. Both Fraenkel and Skolem pointed out that Zermelo's axioms cannot prove the existence of the set {<em>Z</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>Z</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>Z</em><sub>2</sub>, … } where <em>Z</em><sub>0</sub> is the set of <a href="natural_number" title="wikilink">natural numbers</a>, and <em>Z</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> is the <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> of <em>Z</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>. They then introduced the <a href="axiom_of_replacement" title="wikilink">axiom of replacement</a>, which would guarantee the existence of such sets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, they were reluctant to adopt this axiom: Fraenkel's opinion was "that Replacement was too strong an axiom for 'general set theory' … and … Skolem only wrote that 'we could introduce' Replacement".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Von Neumann worked on the deficiencies in <a href="Zermelo_set_theory" title="wikilink">Zermelo's set theory</a> and introduced several innovations to remedy them, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A theory of <a href="ordinal_number" title="wikilink">ordinals</a>.</strong> Zermelo's set theory does not contain Cantor's theory of ordinal numbers. Von Neumann recovered this theory by defining the ordinals using sets that are <a class="uri" href="well-ordered" title="wikilink">well-ordered</a> by the ∈-relation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In contrast to Fraenkel and Skolem, von Neumann found the axiom of replacement so essential to his work that he declared: "In fact, I believe that no theory of ordinals is possible at all without this axiom."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>A criterion identifying classes that are too large to be sets.</strong> Zermelo did not provide such a criterion. His set theory avoids the large classes that lead to the <a href="Georg_Cantor#Paradoxes_of_set_theory" title="wikilink">paradoxes</a>, but it leaves out many sets, such as the one mentioned by Fraenkel and Skolem.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Von Neumann's criterion is: A class is too large to be a set if and only if it can be mapped <a class="uri" href="onto" title="wikilink">onto</a> the universal class. Von Neumann realized that the paradoxes can be avoided by not allowing such large classes to be members of any class. Combining this restriction with his criterion, he obtained his <a href="axiom_of_limitation_of_size" title="wikilink">axiom of limitation of size</a>: A class <em>X</em> is not a member of any class if and only if <em>X</em> can be mapped onto the universal class.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> He proved that this axiom implies the axioms of replacement and <a href="Axiom_of_separation" title="wikilink">separation</a>, and implies that the universal class can be well-ordered (which is equivalent to the <a href="axiom_of_global_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of global choice</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finite axiomatization.</strong> Fraenkel and Skolem formalized Zermelo's imprecise concept of "definite <a href="propositional_function" title="wikilink">propositional function</a>", which appears in his axiom of separation. Skolem gave the <a href="axiom_schema_of_separation" title="wikilink">axiom schema of separation</a> that is currently used in ZFC; Fraenkel gave an equivalent approach. Zermelo rejected both approaches "particularly because they implicitly involve the concept of natural number which, in Zermelo's view, should be based upon set theory."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Von Neumann avoided <a href="axiom_schema" title="wikilink">axiom schemas</a> by formalizing the concept of "definite propositional function" with his functions, whose construction requires only finitely many axioms. This led to his set theory having finitely many axioms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> (In 1961, <a href="Richard_Montague" title="wikilink">Montague</a> proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The <a href="axiom_of_regularity" title="wikilink">axiom of regularity</a>.</strong> Zermelo's set theory does not exclude non-<a class="uri" href="well-founded" title="wikilink">well-founded</a> sets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Fraenkel and von Neumann introduced axioms to exclude these sets. Von Neumann introduced the axiom of regularity, which states that all sets are well-founded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Although von Neumann did not adopt regularity as an axiom,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> he proved its relative consistency while studying his axiom of limitation of size. First he weakened his axiom system by replacing the latter axiom with two of its consequences: replacement and a choice axiom equivalent to global choice.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Next he proved that if this weaker system is consistent, it remains consistent after adding the axiom of regularity. Finally, he showed that his weaker system augmented with regularity proves the axiom of limitation of size.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> These results establish that the axioms of regularity and limitation of size are relatively consistent with respect to his weaker system, and that (in the presence of regularity and his other axioms) replacement and his choice axiom are equivalent to the axiom of limitation of size.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a series of articles published between 1937 and 1954, <a href="Paul_Bernays" title="wikilink">Paul Bernays</a> modified von Neumann's theory by taking sets and classes as primitives. By using sets, Bernays was following the tradition established by Cantor, <a href="Richard_Dedekind" title="wikilink">Dedekind</a>, and Zermelo. His classes followed the tradition of <a href="Boolean_algebra" title="wikilink">Boolean algebra</a> since they permit the operation of complement as well as union and intersection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Bernays handled sets and classes in a <a href="Many-sorted_first-order_logic" title="wikilink">two-sorted logic</a>. This required the introduction of two membership primitives: one for membership in sets, and one for membership in classes. With these primitives, Bernays rewrote and simplified von Neumann's axioms. He also adopted the axiom of regularity, and replaced the axiom of limitation of size with the axioms of replacement and von Neumann's choice axiom. (Von Neumann's work shows that the last two changes allow Bernays' axioms to prove the axiom of limitation of size.) <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Kurt_Gödel" title="wikilink">Kurt Gödel</a> simplified Bernays' theory by making every set a class, which allowed him to use just one sort for classes and one membership primitive. He also introduced a <a href="Predicate_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">predicate</a> indicating which classes are sets. Gödel modified some of Bernays' axioms, and introduced the axiom of global choice to replace von Neumann's choice axiom. He used his axioms in his 1940 monograph on the relative consistency of global choice and the <a href="generalized_continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">generalized continuum hypothesis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>Several reasons have been given for Gödel choosing NBG for his 1940 monograph.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Gödel gave a mathematical reason—NBG's global choice produces a stronger consistency theorem: "This stronger form of the axiom [of choice], if consistent with the other axioms, implies, of course, that a weaker form is also consistent."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> <a href="Robert_Solovay" title="wikilink">Robert Solovay</a> conjectured: "My guess is that he wished to avoid a discussion of the technicalities involved in developing the rudiments of <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a> within axiomatic set theory."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> <a href="Kenneth_Kunen" title="wikilink">Kenneth Kunen</a> gave a reason for Gödel avoiding this discussion: "There is also a much more combinatorial approach to <strong>L</strong> [the <a href="constructible_universe" title="wikilink">constructible universe</a>], developed by … [Gödel in his 1940 monograph] in an attempt to explain his work to non-logicians. … This approach has the merit of removing all vestiges of logic from the treatment of <strong>L</strong>."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> <a href="Charles_Parsons_(philosopher)" title="wikilink">Charles Parsons</a> gives a philosophical reason for Gödel's choice of NBG: "This view [that 'property of set' is a primitive of set theory] may be reflected in Gödel's choice of a theory with class variables as the framework for … [his monograph]."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Gödel's achievement together with the details of his presentation led to the prominence that NBG would enjoy for the next two decades.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> Even <a href="Paul_Cohen_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Paul Cohen</a>'s 1963 <a href="Independence_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">independence</a> proofs for ZF used tools that Gödel developed for his work in NBG.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> However, in the 1960s, ZFC became more popular than NBG. This was caused by several factors, including the extra work required to handle <a href="Forcing_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">forcing</a> in NBG,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Cohen's 1966 presentation of forcing (which uses techniques that naturally belong to ZF),<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> and the proof that NBG is a conservative extension of ZFC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="axiom_of_limitation_of_size" title="wikilink">Limitation of Size</a>:</strong> For any class <em>C</em>, a set <em>x</em> such that <em>x=C</em> exists if and only if there is no <a class="uri" href="bijection" title="wikilink">bijection</a> between <em>C</em> and the class <em>V</em> of all sets.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From this axiom, due to <a href="Von_Neumann" title="wikilink">Von Neumann</a>, <a href="axiom_schema_of_separation" title="wikilink">Subsets</a>, <a href="axiom_schema_of_replacement" title="wikilink">Replacement</a>, and <a href="axiom_of_global_choice" title="wikilink">Global Choice</a> can all be derived. This axiom implies the <a href="axiom_of_global_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of global choice</a> because the class of <a href="ordinal_number" title="wikilink">ordinals</a> is not a set; hence there exists a <a class="uri" href="bijection" title="wikilink">bijection</a> between the ordinals and the <a href="von_Neumann_universe" title="wikilink">universe</a>. If Limitation of Size were weakened to "If the domain of a class function is a set, then the range of that function is likewise a set," then no form of the <a href="axiom_of_choice" title="wikilink">axiom of choice</a> is an NBG theorem. In this case, any of the usual local forms of Choice may be taken as an added axiom, if desired.

<dd>Limitation of Size cannot be found in Mendelson (1997) NBG.

<dd>Class Comprehension is the only axiom schema of NBG. In the next section, we show how this schema can be replaced by a number of its own instances. Hence NBG can be finitely axiomatized.

<h3 id="replacing-class-comprehension-with-finite-instances-thereof">Replacing Class Comprehension with finite instances thereof</h3>

<p>An appealing but somewhat mysterious feature of NBG is that its axiom schema of Class Comprehension is equivalent to the conjunction of a finite number of its instances. The axioms of this section may replace the Axiom Schema of Class Comprehension in the preceding section. The finite axiomatization presented below does not necessarily resemble exactly any NBG axiomatization in print.</p>

<p>We develop our axiomatization by considering the structure of formulas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sets:</strong> For any set <em>x</em>, there is a class <em>X</em> such that <em>x=X</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This axiom, in combination with the set existence axioms from the previous axiomatization, assures the existence of classes from the outset, and enables formulas with class parameters.</p>

The idea is to apply <em>Assoc1</em> until the argument to be brought to the front is second, then apply <em>Conv1</em> or <em>Conv2</em> as appropriate to bring the second argument to the front, then apply <em>Assoc2</em> until the effects of the original applications of <em>Assoc1</em> (which are now behind the moved argument) are corrected.</p>

<p>Even though NBG is a <a href="conservative_extension" title="wikilink">conservative extension</a> of ZFC, a theorem may have a shorter and more elegant proof in NBG than in ZFC (or vice versa). For a survey of known results of this nature, see Pudlak (1998).</p>

Now let the members of <em>V</em> include the <a href="inaccessible_cardinal" title="wikilink">inaccessible cardinal</a> κ. Also let Def(<em>X</em>) denote the Δ<sub>0</sub> definable <a href="subset" title="wikilink">subsets</a> of <em>X</em> (see <a href="constructible_universe" title="wikilink">constructible universe</a>). Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>V</em><sub>κ</sub> is an <a href="intended_interpretation" title="wikilink">intended model</a> of <a class="uri" href="ZFC" title="wikilink">ZFC</a>;</li>
<li>Def(<em>V</em><sub>κ</sub>) is an intended model of NBG;</li>
<li><em>V</em><sub>κ+1</sub> is an intended model of <a href="Morse–Kelley_set_theory" title="wikilink">MK</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="category-theory">Category theory</h3>

<p>The ontology of NBG provides scaffolding for speaking about "large objects" without risking paradox. In some developments of <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a>, for instance, a "large category" is defined as one whose <a href="object_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">objects</a> make up a proper class, with the same being true of its <a href="morphism" title="wikilink">morphisms</a>. A "small category", on the other hand, is one whose objects and morphisms are members of some set. We can thus easily speak of the "<a href="category_of_all_sets" title="wikilink">category of all sets</a>" or "<a href="category_of_all_small_categories" title="wikilink">category of all small categories</a>" without risking paradox. Those categories are large, of course. There is no "category of all categories" since it would have to contain large categories which no category can do. Although yet another ontological extension can enable one to talk formally about such a "category" (see for example the "quasicategory of all categories" of Adámek et al. (1990), whose objects and morphisms form a "proper conglomerate").</p>

<p>On whether an ontology including classes as well as sets is adequate for <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a>, see Muller (2001).</p>

<li id="fn6">After introducing the <a href="cumulative_hierarchy" title="wikilink">cumulative hierarchy</a>, von Neumann could show that Zermelo's axioms do not prove the existence of ordinals α ≥ ω + ω, which include uncountably many <a href="hereditarily_countable_set" title="wikilink">hereditarily countable sets</a>. This follows from Skolem's result that V<sub>ω+ω</sub> satisfies Zermelo's axioms () and from α ∈ V<sub>β</sub> implying α β.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn12">Von Neumann also analyzed Fraenkel's axiom and stated that it was not "precisely formulated", but it would approximately say: "Besides the sets … whose existence is absolutely required by the axioms, there are no further sets." His analysis led him to reject this axiom and to propose the axiom of regularity instead (; English translation: p. 404–405 &amp; p. 410–411).<a href="#fnref12">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn19">Gödel used von Neumann's axioms in his 1938 announcement of his relative consistency theorem, and used ZF in his 1939 outline of his proof (). In his 1938 announcement, Gödel also stated "A corresponding theorem holds if <em>T</em> denotes the system <em>Principia mathematica</em> …" (). Proving a theorem in multiple <a href="formal_systems" title="wikilink">formal systems</a> was not unusual for Gödel. For example, he proved his <a href="incompleteness_theorem" title="wikilink">incompleteness theorem</a> for the system of <em>Principia mathematica</em>, but pointed out that it "holds for a wide class of formal systems …" ().<a href="#fnref19">↩</a></li>

<li id="fn21">. Gödel's consistency proof builds the <a href="constructible_universe" title="wikilink">constructible universe</a>. To build this in ZF requires some model theory; Gödel built it in NBG without model theory. For a discussion of Gödel's technique: see .<a href="#fnref21">↩</a></li>
