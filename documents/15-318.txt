   Conway group Co1      Conway group Co1     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Conway group  Co 1 is a sporadic simple group of order   2 21 {{¬∑}}3 9 {{¬∑}}5 4 {{¬∑}}7 2 {{¬∑}}11{{¬∑}}13{{¬∑}}23  = 4157776806543360000  ‚âà 4     √ó    10  1   8       absent     superscript  10  1   8     \times 10^{1}8   .   History and properties  Co 1 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered by John Horton Conway in 1968. It is the largest of the three sporadic Conway groups and can be obtained as the quotient of Co 0 ( group of automorphisms of the Leech lattice Œõ that fix the origin) by its center , which consists of the scalar matrices ¬±1. It also appears at the top of the automorphism group of the even 26-dimensional unimodular lattice II 25,1 . Some rather cryptic comments in Witt's collected works suggest that he found the Leech lattice and possibly the order of its automorphism group in unpublished work in 1940.  The outer automorphism group is trivial and the Schur multiplier has order 2. Co 0 has no matrices of determinant -1.  An inner product on the Leech lattice is defined as 1/8 the sum of the products of respective co-ordinates of the two multiplicand vectors. The norm of a vector is its inner product with itself. It is common to speak of the type of a Leech lattice vector: half the norm. This lattice has no vectors of type 1. The matrices of Co 0 are orthogonal , I. e. they leave the inner product invariant. The inverse is the transpose.  Monomial subgroup of Co 0 , N ‚âà 2 12 :M 24  Conway started his investigation of Co 0 with a subgroup often called N , a holomorph of the binary Golay code (as diagonal matrices) by the Mathieu group M 24 (as permutation matrices).  A standard representation, used throughout this article, of the (extended) binary Golay code arranges the 24 co-ordinates so that 6 consecutive blocks (tetrads) of 4 constitute a sextet .  The Leech lattice can easily be defined as the Z-module generated by the set Œõ 2 of all vectors of type 2, consisting of   (4,4,0 22 )  (2 8 ,0 16 )  (-3,1 23 )   and their images under N. Under N Œõ 2 falls into 3 orbits of sizes 1104, 97152, and 98304.Then |Œõ 2 | = 196560 = 2 4 *3 3 *5*7*13. Conway strongly suspected Co 0 was transitive on Œõ 2 , and indeed he found a new matrix, not monomial and not an integer matrix.  Let Œ∑ be the 4-by-4 matrix       ùüè  /  2    (     1     -  1      -  1      -  1        -  1     1     -  1      -  1        -  1      -  1     1     -  1        -  1      -  1      -  1     1     )         1  2     1    1     1     1       1   1    1     1       1     1   1    1       1     1     1   1      {\mathbf{1}/2}\left(\begin{matrix}1&-1&-1&-1\\
 -1&1&-1&-1\\
 -1&-1&1&-1\\
 -1&-1&-1&1\end{matrix}\right)   Now let Œ∂ be a block sum of 6 matrices: odd numbers each of Œ∑ and its negative. 1 2 Œ∂ is a symmetric and orthogonal matrix, thus an involution . Some experimenting shows that it interchanges vectors between different orbits of N.  To compute |Co 0 | it is best to consider Œõ 4 , the set of vectors of type 4. For any type 4 vector, there are exactly 48 type 4 vectors congruent to it modulo 2Œõ, falling into 24 orthogonal pairs { v ,‚Äì v }. A set of 48 such vectors is called a frame or cross . N has as an orbit the frame of vectors with just one non-zero component, equal ¬±8. The subgroup fixing a given frame is a conjugate of N. The group 2 12 is isomorphic to the Golay code and acts as sign changes on vectors of the frame, while M 24 permutes the 24 pairs of the frame. Co 0 can be shown to be transitive on Œõ 4 . Conway multiplied the order 2 12 |M 24 | of N by the number of frames, the latter being equal to the quotient |Œõ 4 |/48 = 8,252,375 = 3 6 *5 3 *7*13. That product is the order of any subgroup of Co 0 that properly contains N; hence N is a maximal subgroup of Co 0 and contains 2-Sylow subgroups of Co 0 . N also is the subgroup in Co 0 of all matrices with integer components.  Since Œõ includes vectors of the shape (¬±8,0 23 ), Co 0 consists of rational matrices whose denominators are all divisors of 8.  Involutions in Co 0 and Co 1  Any involution in Co 0 can be shown to be conjugate to an element of the Golay code. Co 0 has 4 conjugacy classes of involutions; these collapse to 2 in Co 1 , but there are 4-elements in Co 0 that correspond to a third class of involutions in Co 1 .  A permutation matrix of shape 2 12 can be shown to be conjugate to a dodecad. Its centralizer has the form 2 12 :M 12 and has conjugates inside the monomial subgroup.  A permutation matrix of shape 2 8 1 8 can be shown to be conjugate to an octad. This and its negative have a common centralizer of the form (2 1+8 x2).O 8 + (2), a subgroup maximal in Co 0 .  Representations  The smallest non-trivial representation of Co 0 over any field is the 24-dimensional one coming from the Leech lattice, and this is faithful over fields of characteristic other than 2.  The smallest faithful permutation representation of Co 1 is on the 98280 pairs { v ,‚Äì v } of norm 4 vectors.  The centralizer of an involution of type 2B in the monster group is of the form 2 1+24 Co 1 .  The Dynkin diagram of the even Lorentzian unimodular lattice  II 1,25 is isometric to the (affine) Leech lattice Œõ, so the group of diagram automorphisms is split extension Œõ,Co 0 of affine isometries of the Leech lattice.  Maximal subgroups  found the 22 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Co 1 , though there were some errors in this list, corrected by .   Co 2 The lift to Aut(Œõ) fixes a type 2 (norm 4) vector.  3.Suz:2 The lift to Aut(Œõ) fixes a complex structure or changes it to the complex conjugate structure. Top of Suzuki chain; see below.  2 11 :M 24 The lift to Aut(Œõ) fixes a frame; see above.  Co 3 The lift to Aut(Œõ) fixes a type 3 (norm 6) vector.  2 1+8 .O 8 + (2)  U 6 (2):S 3  (A 4 √ó G 2 (4)):2 in Suzuki chain.  2 2+12 :(A 8 √ó S 3 )  2 4+12 .(S 3 √ó 3.S 6 )  3 2 .U 4 (3).D 8  3 6 :2.M 12 (holomorph of ternary Golay code )  (A 5 √ó J 2 ):2 in Suzuki chain  3 1+4 :2.PSp 4 (3).2  (A 6 √ó U 3 (3)).2 in Suzuki chain  3 3+4 :2.(S 4 √ó S 4 )  A 9 √ó S 3 in Suzuki chain  (A 7 √ó L 2 (7)):2 in Suzuki chain  (D 10 √ó (A 5 √ó A 5 ).2).2  5 1+2 :GL 2 (5)  5 3 :(4 √ó A 5 ).2  7 2 :(3 √ó 2.S 4 )  5 2 :2A 5   Suzuki chain of product groups  Co 0 (as well as its quotient Co 1 ) has 4 conjugacy classes of elements of order 3. In M 24 an element of shape 3 8 generates a group normal in a copy of S 3 , which commutes with a simple subgroup of order 168. The product PSL(2,7) x S 3 permutes the octads of a trio . In Co 0 this normalizer is expanded to a maximal subgroup of the form 2.A 9 x S 3 , where 2.A 9 is the double cover of the alternating group A 9 .  John Thompson pointed out it would be fruitful to investigate the normalizers of smaller subgroups of the form 2.A n . Several other maximal subgroups of Co 0 are found in this way. Moreover, two sporadic groups appear in the resulting chain.  There is a subgroup 2.A 8 x S 4 , the only one of this chain not maximal in Co 0 . Next there is the subgroup (2.A 7 x PSL 2 (7)):2. Next comes (2.A 6 x SU 3 (3)):2. The unitary group SU 3 (3) (order 6048) possesses a graph of 36 vertices, in anticipation of the next subgroup. That subgroup is (2.A 5 o 2.HJ):2. The aforementioned graph expands to the Hall-Janko graph , with 100 vertices. The Hall-Janko group HJ makes its appearance here. Next comes (2.A 4 o 2.G 2 (4)):2, G 2 (4) being an exceptional group of Lie type .  The chain ends with 6.Suz:2 (Suz=Suzuki group), which, as mentioned above, respects a complex representation of the Leech Lattice.
