   Sketch (mathematics)      Sketch (mathematics)   In the mathematical theory of categories , a sketch is a category D , together with a set of limit cones and a set of colimit cones . A model of the sketch in a category C is a functor      M  :   D  →  C      normal-:  M   normal-→  D  C     M:D\rightarrow C   that takes each specified cone to a limit cone in C and each specified cocone to a colimit cocone in C . Morphisms of models are natural transformations . Sketches are a general way of specifying structures on the objects of a category, forming a category-theoretic analog to the logical concept of a theory and its models . They allow multisorted models and models in any category.  Sketches were invented in 1968 by Charles Ehresmann , using a different but equivalent definition. There are still other definitions in the research literature.  References    .   .   .   .   .   .   External links   Sketches: Outline with references (updated 2009).
