   Biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase      Biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase   Biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase (, malonate decarboxylase (with biotin) , malonate decarboxylase ) is an enzyme with system name malonate carboxy-lyase (biotin-dependent) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   malonate + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    acetate + CO 2    Two types of malonate decarboxylase are currently known, both of which form multienzyme complexes.
