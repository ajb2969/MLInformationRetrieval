   Hilbert–Schmidt operator      Hilbert–Schmidt operator   In mathematics , a Hilbert–Schmidt operator , named for David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt , is a bounded operator  A on a Hilbert space  H with finite Hilbert–Schmidt norm        ∥  A  ∥    H  S   2   =   Tr   (    A    *    A   )    :=    ∑   i  ∈  I      ∥   A   e  i    ∥   2           subscript   superscript   norm  A   2     H  S      Tr     superscript  A      A      assign      subscript     i  I     superscript   norm    A   subscript  e  i     2       \|A\|^{2}_{HS}={\rm Tr}(A^{{}^{*}}A):=\sum_{i\in I}\|Ae_{i}\|^{2}     where    ∥  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  parallel-to    \|\ \|   is the norm of H ,    {   e  i   :   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  e  i     i  I     \{e_{i}:i\in I\}   an orthonormal basis of H , and Tr is the trace of a nonnegative self-adjoint operator. 1 2 Note that the index set need not be countable. This definition is independent of the choice of the basis, and therefore        ∥  A  ∥    H  S   2   =    ∑   i  ,  j      |   A   i  ,  j    |   2    =    ∥  A  ∥   2  2          subscript   superscript   norm  A   2     H  S      subscript    i  j     superscript     subscript  A   i  j     2          subscript   superscript   norm  A   2   2      \|A\|^{2}_{HS}=\sum_{i,j}|A_{i,j}|^{2}=\|A\|^{2}_{2}     for     A   i  ,  j    =   ⟨   e  i   ,   A   e  j    ⟩        subscript  A   i  j      subscript  e  i     A   subscript  e  j       A_{i,j}=\langle e_{i},Ae_{j}\rangle   and     ∥  A  ∥   2     subscript   norm  A   2    \|A\|_{2}   the Schatten norm of   A   A   A   for p=2 . In Euclidean space     ∥   ∥   H  S       fragments  parallel-to   subscript  parallel-to    H  S      \|\ \|_{HS}   is also called Frobenius norm , named for Ferdinand Georg Frobenius .  The product of two Hilbert–Schmidt operators has finite trace class norm ; therefore, if A and B are two Hilbert–Schmidt operators, the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product can be defined as         ⟨  A  ,  B  ⟩   HS   =   Tr   (    A  *   B   )    =    ∑  i    ⟨   A   e  i    ,   B   e  i    ⟩     .         subscript   A  B   HS    Tr     superscript  A    B           subscript   i      A   subscript  e  i      B   subscript  e  i         \langle A,B\rangle_{\mathrm{HS}}=\operatorname{Tr}(A^{*}B)=\sum_{i}\langle Ae_%
 {i},Be_{i}\rangle.     The Hilbert–Schmidt operators form a two-sided *-ideal in the Banach algebra of bounded operators on H . They also form a Hilbert space, which can be shown to be naturally isometrically isomorphic to the tensor product of Hilbert spaces        H  *   ⊗  H   ,     tensor-product   superscript  H    H    H^{*}\otimes H,\,     where H* is the dual space of H .  The set of Hilbert–Schmidt operators is closed in the norm topology if, and only if, H is finite-dimensional.  An important class of examples is provided by Hilbert–Schmidt integral operators .  Hilbert–Schmidt operators are nuclear operators of order 2, and are therefore compact.  References  "  Category:Operator theory     ↩  ↩
