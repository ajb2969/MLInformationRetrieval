   L-lysine-lactamase      L-lysine-lactamase   In enzymology , a L-lysine-lactamase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-lysine 1,6-lactam + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-lysine 1,6-lactam and H 2 O , whereas its product is L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine-1,6-lactam lactamhydrolase . Other names in common use include L-alpha-aminocaprolactam hydrolase , and L-lysinamidase .
