Integer broom topology

In general topology, a branch of mathematics, the integer broom topology, is an example of a topology on the so-called integer broom space X.1
Definition of the integer broom space

A subset of the integer broom

]] The integer broom space X is a subset of the plane R2. Assume that the plane is parametrised by polar coordinates. The integer broom contains the origin and the points  such that n is a non-negative integer, and }.2 The image on the right gives an illustration for  and . Geometrically, the space consists of a series of convergent sequences. For a fixed n, we have a sequence of points − lying on circle with centre (0,0) and radius n − that converges to the point (n,0).
Definition of the integer broom topology
We define a topology on X by means of a product topology. The Integer Broom space is given by the polar coordinates


 
  Let us write  for simplicity. The Integer Broom topology on X is the product topology induced by giving U the right order topology, and V the subspace topology from R.3
Properties
The integer broom space, together with the integer broom topology, is a compact topological space. It is a so-called Kolmogorov space, but it is neither a Fréchet space nor a Hausdorff space. The space is locally connected and path connected, while not arc connected.4
