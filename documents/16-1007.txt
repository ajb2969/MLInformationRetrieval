Final functor

In Category theory, the notion of final functor (resp., initial functor) is a generalization of the notion of final object (resp., initial object) in a category.
A functor 
 
 
 
  is called final if, for any set-valued functor 
 
 
 
 , the colimit of G is the same as the colimit of 
 
 
 
 . Note that an object dâˆˆOb(D) is a final object in the usual sense if and only if the functor 
 
 
 
  is a final functor as defined here.
The notion of initial functor is defined as above, replacing final by initial and colimit by limit.
