   Final functor      Final functor   In Category theory , the notion of final functor (resp., initial functor ) is a generalization of the notion of final object (resp., initial object) in a category.  A functor    F  :   C  →  D      normal-:  F   normal-→  C  D     F:C\to D   is called final if, for any set-valued functor    G  :   D  →   S  e  t       normal-:  G   normal-→  D    S  e  t      G:D\to Set   , the colimit of G is the same as the colimit of    G  ∘  F      G  F    G\circ F   . Note that an object d∈Ob(D) is a final object in the usual sense if and only if the functor     {  *  }    →  𝑑   D      d  normal-→      D    \{*\}\xrightarrow{d}D   is a final functor as defined here.  The notion of initial functor is defined as above, replacing final by initial and colimit by limit .  References    .   .   .
