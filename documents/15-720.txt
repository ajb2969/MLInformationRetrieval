   Rice's formula      Rice's formula   In probability theory , Rice's formula counts the average number of times an ergodic  stationary process  X ( t ) per unit time crosses a fixed level u . 1 Adler and Taylor describe the result as "one of the most important results in the applications of smooth stochastic processes." 2  History  The formula was published by Stephen O. Rice in 1944, 3 having previously been discussed in his 1936 note entitled "Singing Transmission Lines." 4 5  Formula  Write D u for the number of times the ergodic stationary stochastic process X ( t ) takes the value u in a unit of time (i.e. t ∈ [0,1]). Then Rice's formula states that         𝔼   (   D  u   )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     |   x  ′   |   p   (  u  ,   x  ′   )   d   x  ′           𝔼   subscript  D  u      superscript   subscript               superscript  x  normal-′    p   u   superscript  x  normal-′    normal-d   superscript  x  normal-′       \mathbb{E}(D_{u})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x^{\prime}|p(u,x^{\prime})\,\mathrm{%
 d}x^{\prime}        where p ( x , x ') is the joint probability density of the X ( t ) and its mean-square derivative X '( t ). 6  If the process X ( t ) is a Gaussian process and u = 0 then the formula simplifies significantly to give 7 8         𝔼   (   D  0   )    =    1  π     -    ρ  ′′    (  0  )             𝔼   subscript  D  0        1  π          superscript  ρ  ′′   0        \mathbb{E}(D_{0})=\frac{1}{\pi}\sqrt{-\rho^{\prime\prime}(0)}        where ρ '' is the second derivative of the normalised autocorrelation of X ( t ) at 0.  Uses  Rice's formula can be used to approximate an excursion probability 9        ℙ   {   sup   t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     X   (  t  )   ≥  u  }      fragments  P   fragments  normal-{   subscript  supremum    t   0  1     X   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    u  normal-}     \mathbb{P}\left\{\sup_{t\in[0,1]}X(t)\geq u\right\}        as for large values of u the probability that there is a level crossing is approximately the probability of reaching that level.
