   Standard basis      Standard basis   In mathematics , the standard basis (also called natural basis or canonical basis ) for a Euclidean space is the set of unit vectors pointing in the direction of the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system . For example, the standard basis for the Euclidean plane is formed by vectors         𝐞  x   =   (  1  ,  0  )    ,    𝐞  y   =   (  0  ,  1  )     ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  𝐞  x    1  0       subscript  𝐞  y    0  1      \mathbf{e}_{x}=(1,0),\quad\mathbf{e}_{y}=(0,1),   and the standard basis for three-dimensional space is formed by vectors         𝐞  x   =   (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )    ,     𝐞  y   =   (  0  ,  1  ,  0  )    ,    𝐞  z   =   (  0  ,  0  ,  1  )      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  𝐞  x    1  0  0     formulae-sequence     subscript  𝐞  y    0  1  0       subscript  𝐞  z    0  0  1       \mathbf{e}_{x}=(1,0,0),\quad\mathbf{e}_{y}=(0,1,0),\quad\mathbf{e}_{z}=(0,0,1).   Here the vector e x points in the x direction, the vector e y points in the y direction, and the vector e z points in the z direction. There are several common notations for these vectors, including { e x , e y , e z }, { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 }, { i , j , k }, and { x , y , z }. These vectors are sometimes written with a hat to emphasize their status as unit vectors. Each of these vectors is sometimes referred to as the versor of the corresponding Cartesian axis.  These vectors are a basis in the sense that any other vector can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of these. For example, every vector v in three-dimensional space can be written uniquely as          v  x     𝐞  x    +     v  y     𝐞  y    +     v  z     𝐞  z     ,         subscript  v  x    subscript  𝐞  x       subscript  v  y    subscript  𝐞  y       subscript  v  z    subscript  𝐞  z      v_{x}\,\mathbf{e}_{x}+v_{y}\,\mathbf{e}_{y}+v_{z}\,\mathbf{e}_{z},   the scalars  v x , v y , v z being the scalar components of the vector v .  In   n   n   n   - dimensional Euclidean space, the standard basis consists of n distinct vectors       {   𝐞  i   :   1  ≤  i  ≤  n   }   ,     conditional-set   subscript  𝐞  i       1  i       n      \{\mathbf{e}_{i}:1\leq i\leq n\},   where e i denotes the vector with a 1 in the   i   i   i   th coordinate and 0's elsewhere.  Standard bases can be defined for other vector spaces , such as polynomials and matrices . In both cases, the standard basis consists of the elements of the vector space such that all coefficients but one are 0 and the non-zero one is 1. For polynomials, the standard basis thus consists of the monomials and is commonly called monomial basis . For matrices    ℳ   m  ×  n      subscript  ℳ    m  n     \mathcal{M}_{m\times n}   , the standard basis consists of the m × n -matrices with exactly one non-zero entry, which is 1. For example, the standard basis for 2×2 matrices is formed by the 4 matrices         𝐞  11   =   (     1    0      0    0     )    ,     𝐞  12   =   (     0    1      0    0     )    ,     𝐞  21   =   (     0    0      1    0     )    ,    𝐞  22   =   (     0    0      0    1     )       .     formulae-sequence     subscript  𝐞  11     1  0    0  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  𝐞  12     0  1    0  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  𝐞  21     0  0    1  0        subscript  𝐞  22     0  0    0  1         \mathbf{e}_{11}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix},\quad\mathbf{e}_{12}=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 0&0\end{pmatrix},\quad\mathbf{e}_{21}=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\
 1&0\end{pmatrix},\quad\mathbf{e}_{22}=\begin{pmatrix}0&0\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}.     Properties  By definition, the standard basis is a sequence of orthogonal  unit vectors . In other words, it is an ordered and orthonormal basis.  However, an ordered orthonormal basis is not necessarily a standard basis. For instance the two vectors representing a 30° rotation of the 2D standard basis described above, i.e.       v  1   =   (    3   2   ,   1  2   )        subscript  v  1        3   2     1  2      v_{1}=\left({\sqrt{3}\over 2},{1\over 2}\right)\,          v  2   =   (   1  2   ,    -   3    2   )        subscript  v  2      1  2         3    2      v_{2}=\left({1\over 2},{-\sqrt{3}\over 2}\right)\,     are also orthogonal unit vectors, but they are not aligned with the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system , so the basis with these vectors does not meet the definition of standard basis.  Generalizations  There is a standard basis also for the ring of polynomials in n indeterminates over a field , namely the monomials .  All of the preceding are special cases of the family        (   e  i   )    i  ∈  I    =    (    (   δ   i  j    )    j  ∈  I    )    i  ∈  I         subscript   subscript  e  i     i  I     subscript   subscript   subscript  δ    i  j      j  I      i  I      {(e_{i})}_{i\in I}=((\delta_{ij})_{j\in I})_{i\in I}     where   I   I   I   is any set and    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   is the Kronecker delta , equal to zero whenever i≠j and equal to 1 if i=j . This family is the canonical basis of the R -module ( free module )      R   (  I  )      superscript  R  I    R^{(I)}     of all families      f  =   (   f  i   )       f   subscript  f  i     f=(f_{i})     from I into a ring  R , which are zero except for a finite number of indices, if we interpret 1 as 1 R , the unit in R .  Other usages  The existence of other 'standard' bases has become a topic of interest in algebraic geometry , beginning with work of Hodge from 1943 on Grassmannians . It is now a part of representation theory called standard monomial theory . The idea of standard basis in the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra is established by the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem .  Gröbner bases are also sometimes called standard bases.  In physics , the standard basis vectors for a given Euclidean space are sometimes referred to as the versors of the axes of the corresponding Cartesian coordinate system.
