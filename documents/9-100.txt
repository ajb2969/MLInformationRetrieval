   Craig's theorem      Craig's theorem   In mathematical logic , Craig's theorem states that any recursively enumerable set of well-formed formulas of a first-order language is (primitively) recursively axiomatizable. This result is not related to the well-known Craig interpolation theorem, although both results are named after the same mathematician, William Craig .  Recursive axiomatization  Let     A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …      subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…    A_{1},A_{2},\dots   be an enumeration of the axioms of a recursively enumerable set T of first-order formulas. Construct another set T* consisting of         A  i   ∧  …  ∧   A  i    ⏟   i     subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  A  i   normal-…   subscript  A  i     i    \underbrace{A_{i}\land\dots\land A_{i}}_{i}     for each positive integer i . The deductive closures of T* and T are thus equivalent; the proof will show that T* is a decidable set. A decision procedure for T* lends itself according to the following informal reasoning. Each member of T* is either    A  1     subscript  A  1    A_{1}   or of the form          B  j   ∧  …  ∧   B  j    ⏟   j   .     subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  B  j   normal-…   subscript  B  j     j    \underbrace{B_{j}\land\dots\land B_{j}}_{j}.     Since each formula has finite length, it is checkable whether or not it is    A  1     subscript  A  1    A_{1}   or of the said form. If it is of the said form and consists of j conjuncts, it is in T* if it is the expression    A  j     subscript  A  j    A_{j}   ; otherwise it is not in T*. Again, it is checkable whether it is in fact    A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   by going through the enumeration of the axioms of T and then checking symbol-for-symbol whether the expressions are identical.  Primitive recursive axiomatizations  The proof above shows that for each recursively enumerable set of axioms there is a recursive set of axioms with the same deductive closure. A set of axioms is primitive recursive if there is a primitive recursive function that decides membership in the set. To obtain a primitive recursive aximatization, instead of replacing a formula    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   with         A  i   ∧  …  ∧   A  i    ⏟   i     subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  A  i   normal-…   subscript  A  i     i    \underbrace{A_{i}\land\dots\land A_{i}}_{i}     one instead replaces it with         A  i   ∧  …  ∧   A  i    ⏟    f   (  i  )       subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  A  i   normal-…   subscript  A  i       f  i     \underbrace{A_{i}\land\dots\land A_{i}}_{f(i)}   (*)  where f ( x ) is a function that, given i , returns a computation history showing that    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   is in the original recursively enumerable set of axioms. It is possible for a primitive recursive function to parse an expression of form (*) to obtain    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   and j . Then, because Kleene's T predicate is primitive recursive, it is possible for a primitive recursive function to verify that j is indeed a computation history as required.
