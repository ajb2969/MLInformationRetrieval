  [31,1,3,3,31,1] |} The 6-demicubic honeycomb or demihexeractic honeycube is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 6-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 6-cube honeycomb.
It is composed of two different types of facets. The 6-cubes become alternated into 6-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 6-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,4} facets.
D6 lattice
The vertex arrangement of the 6-demicubic honeycomb is the D6 lattice.1 The 60 vertices of the rectified 6-orthoplex vertex figure of the 6-demicubic honeycomb reflect the kissing number 60 of this lattice.2 The best known is 72, from the E6 lattice and the 222 honeycomb.
The D
 
 
 
  lattice (also called D
 
 
 
 ) can be constructed by the union of two D6 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 25=32 (2n-1 for n8).3


∪ 


The D
 
 
 
  lattice (also called D
 
 
 
  and C
 
 
 
 ) can be constructed by the union of all four 6-demicubic lattices:4 It is also the 6-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 6-cube honeycombs in dual positions.


∪  ∪  ∪  =  ∪ .


The kissing number of the D6* lattice is 12 (2n for n≥5).5 and its Voronoi tessellation is a trirectified 6-cubic honeycomb, , containing all birectified 6-orthoplex Voronoi cell, .6
Symmetry constructions
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of differened colors on the 64 6-demicube facets around each vertex.
