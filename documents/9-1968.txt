It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 6-cube honeycomb .  It is composed of two different types of facets . The 6-cubes become alternated into 6-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 6-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,4} facets.  D6 lattice  The vertex arrangement of the 6-demicubic honeycomb is the D 6 lattice . 1 The 60 vertices of the rectified 6-orthoplex  vertex figure of the 6-demicubic honeycomb reflect the kissing number 60 of this lattice. 2 The best known is 72, from the E 6 lattice and the 2 22 honeycomb .  The D     6     +     subscript   superscript  absent    6    {}^{+}_{6}   lattice (also called D     6     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   6    {}^{2}_{6}   ) can be constructed by the union of two D 6 lattices. This packing is only a lattice for even dimensions. The kissing number is 2 5 =32 (2 n-1 for n8). 3    ∪    The D     6     *     subscript   superscript  absent    6    {}^{*}_{6}   lattice (also called D     6     4     subscript   superscript  absent  4   6    {}^{4}_{6}   and C     6     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   6    {}^{2}_{6}   ) can be constructed by the union of all four 6-demicubic lattices: 4 It is also the 6-dimensional body centered cubic , the union of two 6-cube honeycombs in dual positions.    ∪  ∪  ∪  =  ∪ .    The kissing number of the D 6 * lattice is 12 ( 2n for n≥5). 5 and its Voronoi tessellation is a trirectified 6-cubic honeycomb , , containing all birectified 6-orthoplex  Voronoi cell , . 6  Symmetry constructions  There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of differened colors on the 64 6-demicube facets around each vertex.
