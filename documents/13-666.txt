   Bicentric quadrilateral      Bicentric quadrilateral   In Euclidean geometry , a bicentric quadrilateral is a convex  quadrilateral that has both an incircle and a circumcircle . The radii and center of these circles are called the inradius and circumradius , and incenter and circumcenter respectively. From the definition it follows that bicentric quadrilaterals have all the properties of both tangential quadrilaterals and cyclic quadrilaterals . Other names for these quadrilaterals are chord-tangent quadrilateral 1 and inscribed and circumscribed quadrilateral . It has also been called a double circle quadrilateral . 2  If two circles, one within the other, are the incircle and the circumcircle of a bicentric quadrilateral, then every point on the circumcircle is the vertex of a bicentric quadrilateral having the same incircle and circumcircle. 3 This was proved by the French mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788–1867).  Special cases  Examples of bicentric quadrilaterals are squares , right kites , and isosceles tangential trapezoids .  Characterizations  A convex quadrilateral ABCD with sides a , b , c , d is bicentric if and only if opposite sides satisfy Pitot's theorem for tangential quadrilaterals and the cyclic quadrilateral property that opposite angles are supplementary ; that is,      {       a  +  c   =   b  +  d            A  +  C   =   B  +  D   =  π   .          cases      a  c     b  d    otherwise        A  C     B  D        π    otherwise    \begin{cases}a+c=b+d\\
 A+C=B+D=\pi.\end{cases}     Three other characterizations concern the points where the incircle in a tangential quadrilateral is tangent to the sides. If the incircle is tangent to the sides AB , BC , CD , DA at W , X , Y , Z respectively, then a tangential quadrilateral ABCD is also cyclic if and only if any one of the following three conditions holds: 4   WY is perpendicular to XZ        A  W    W  B    =    D  Y    Y  C            A  W     W  B        D  Y     Y  C      \frac{AW}{WB}=\frac{DY}{YC}           A  C    B  D    =     A  W   +   C  Y      B  X   +   D  Z             A  C     B  D          A  W     C  Y        B  X     D  Z       \frac{AC}{BD}=\frac{AW+CY}{BX+DZ}      The first of these three means that the contact quadrilateral  WXYZ is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral .  If E , F , G , H are the midpoints of WX , XY , YZ , ZW respectively, then the tangential quadrilateral ABCD is also cyclic if and only if the quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle . 5  According to another characterization, if I is the incenter in a tangential quadrilateral where the extensions of opposite sides intersect at J and K , then the quadrilateral is also cyclic if and only if JIK is a right angle . 6  Yet another necessary and sufficient condition is that a tangential quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic if and only if its Newton line is perpendicular to the Newton line of its contact quadrilateral WXYZ . (The Newton line of a quadrilateral is the line defined by the midpoints of its diagonals.) 7  Construction  There is a simple method for constructing a bicentric quadrilateral. Draw two perpendicular  chords in a circle (it will be the incircle). At the endpoints of the chords, draw the tangents to the circle. These intersect at four points, which are the vertices of a bicentric quadrilateral. 8 The validity of this construction is due to the characterization that, in a tangential quadrilateral  ABCD , the contact quadrilateral WXYZ has perpendicular diagonals if and only if the tangential quadrilateral is also cyclic .  Area  Formulas in terms of four quantities  The area  K of a bicentric quadrilateral can be expressed in terms of four quantities of the quadrilateral in several different ways. If the sides are a , b , c , d , then the area is given by 9 10 11 12 13       K  =    a  b  c  d     .      K      a  b  c  d      \displaystyle K=\sqrt{abcd}.     This is a special case of Brahmagupta's formula . It can also be derived directly from the trigonometric formula for the area of a tangential quadrilateral . Note that the converse does not hold: Some quadrilaterals that are not bicentric also have area     K  =    a  b  c  d     .      K      a  b  c  d      \displaystyle K=\sqrt{abcd}.    14 One example of such a quadrilateral is a non-square rectangle .  The area can also be expressed in terms of the tangent lengths  e , f , g , h as 15       K  =     e  f  g  h   4    (   e  +  f  +  g  +  h   )     .      K       4     e  f  g  h      e  f  g  h      K=\sqrt[4]{efgh}(e+f+g+h).     A formula for the area of bicentric quadrilateral ABCD with incenter I is 16       K  =      A  I   ⋅  C   I   +     B  I   ⋅  D   I     .      K       normal-⋅    A  I   C   I      normal-⋅    B  I   D   I      K=AI\cdot CI+BI\cdot DI.     If a bicentric quadrilateral has tangency chords  k , l and diagonals p , q , then it has the area 17       K  =    k  l  p  q     k  2   +   l  2      .      K      k  l  p  q      superscript  k  2    superscript  l  2       K=\frac{klpq}{k^{2}+l^{2}}.     If k , l are the tangency chords and m , n are the bimedians of the quadrilateral, then the area can be calculated using the formula 18      K  =    |     m  2   -   n  2      k  2   -   l  2     |   k  l       K           superscript  m  2    superscript  n  2       superscript  k  2    superscript  l  2      k  l     K=\left|\frac{m^{2}-n^{2}}{k^{2}-l^{2}}\right|kl     This formula cannot be used if the quadrilateral is a right kite , since the denominator is zero in that case.  If M and N are the midpoints of the diagonals, and E and F are the intersection points of the extensions of opposite sides, then the area of a bicentric quadrilateral is given by      K  =        2  M  N   ⋅  E   I   ⋅  F   I    E  F        K       normal-⋅     normal-⋅    2  M  N   E   I   F   I     E  F      K=\frac{2MN\cdot EI\cdot FI}{EF}     where I is the center of the incircle. 19  Formulas in terms of three quantities  The area of a bicentric quadrilateral can be expressed in terms of two opposite sides and the angle θ between the diagonals according to 20       K  =   a  c   tan   θ  2     =   b  d   cot   θ  2      .        K    a  c      θ  2            b  d      θ  2        K=ac\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}=bd\cot{\frac{\theta}{2}}.     In terms of two adjacent angles and the radius r of the incircle, the area is given by 21       K  =   2   r  2    (    1   sin  A    +   1   sin  B     )     .      K    2   superscript  r  2       1    A      1    B        K=2r^{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sin{A}}+\frac{1}{\sin{B}}\right).     The area is given in terms of the circumradius R and the inradius r as      K  =   r   (   r  +     4   R  2    +   r  2      )    sin  θ        K    r    r        4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2        θ      K=r(r+\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}})\sin\theta     where θ is either angle between the diagonals. 22  If M and N are the midpoints of the diagonals, and E and F are the intersection points of the extensions of opposite sides, then the area can also be expressed as      K  =   2  M  N      E  Q   ⋅  F   Q         K    2  M  N       normal-⋅    E  Q   F   Q       K=2MN\sqrt{EQ\cdot FQ}     where Q is the foot of the normal to the line EF through the center of the incircle. 23  Inequalities  If r and R are the inradius and the circumradius respectively, then the area  K satisfies the inequalities 24        4   r  2    ≤  K  ≤   2   R  2     .          4   superscript  r  2    K         2   superscript  R  2       \displaystyle 4r^{2}\leq K\leq 2R^{2}.     There is equality on either side only if the quadrilateral is a square .  Another inequality for the area is 25      K  ≤     4  3    r     4   R  2    +   r  2          K      4  3   r        4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2        K\leq\tfrac{4}{3}r\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}}     where r and R are the inradius and the circumradius respectively.  A similar inequality giving a sharper upper bound for the area than the previous one is 26      K  ≤   r   (   r  +     4   R  2    +   r  2      )        K    r    r        4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2         K\leq r(r+\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}})     with equality holding if and only if the quadrilateral is a right kite .  In addition, with sides a, b, c, d and semiperimeter  s :        2   K    ≤  s  ≤   r  +     r  2   +   4   R  2        ;          2    K    s         r       superscript  r  2     4   superscript  R  2          2\sqrt{K}\leq s\leq r+\sqrt{r^{2}+4R^{2}};    27        6  K   ≤    a  b   +   a  c   +   a  d   +   b  c   +   b  d   +   c  d    ≤    4   r  2    +   4   R  2    +   4  r     r  2   +   4   R  2         ;          6  K       a  b     a  c     a  d     b  c     b  d     c  d             4   superscript  r  2      4   superscript  R  2      4  r       superscript  r  2     4   superscript  R  2           6K\leq ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd\leq 4r^{2}+4R^{2}+4r\sqrt{r^{2}+4R^{2}};    28        4  K   r  2    ≤   a  b  c  d   ≤    16  9    r  2    (    r  2   +   4   R  2     )     .          4  K   superscript  r  2      a  b  c  d            16  9    superscript  r  2      superscript  r  2     4   superscript  R  2         4Kr^{2}\leq abcd\leq\frac{16}{9}r^{2}(r^{2}+4R^{2}).    29  Angle formulas  If a , b , c , d are the length of the sides AB , BC , CD , DA respectively in a bicentric quadrilateral ABCD , then its vertex angles can be calculated with the tangent function : 30        tan   A  2    =     b  c    a  d     =   cot   C  2     ,            A  2          b  c     a  d              C  2       \tan{\frac{A}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{bc}{ad}}=\cot{\frac{C}{2}},           tan   B  2    =     c  d    a  b     =   cot   D  2     .            B  2          c  d     a  b              D  2       \tan{\frac{B}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{cd}{ab}}=\cot{\frac{D}{2}}.     Using the same notations, for the sine and cosine functions the following formulas holds: 31        sin   A  2    =     b  c     a  d   +   b  c      =   cos   C  2     ,            A  2          b  c       a  d     b  c               C  2       \sin{\frac{A}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{bc}{ad+bc}}=\cos{\frac{C}{2}},           cos   A  2    =     a  d     a  d   +   b  c      =   sin   C  2     ,            A  2          a  d       a  d     b  c               C  2       \cos{\frac{A}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{ad}{ad+bc}}=\sin{\frac{C}{2}},           sin   B  2    =     c  d     a  b   +   c  d      =   cos   D  2     ,            B  2          c  d       a  b     c  d               D  2       \sin{\frac{B}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{cd}{ab+cd}}=\cos{\frac{D}{2}},           cos   B  2    =     a  b     a  b   +   c  d      =   sin   D  2     .            B  2          a  b       a  b     c  d               D  2       \cos{\frac{B}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{ab}{ab+cd}}=\sin{\frac{D}{2}}.     The angle θ between the diagonals can be calculated from 32        tan   θ  2    =     b  d    a  c      .          θ  2          b  d     a  c       \displaystyle\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{bd}{ac}}.     Inradius and circumradius  The inradius  r of a bicentric quadrilateral is determined by the sides a , b , c , d according to 33       r  =     a  b  c  d     a  +  c    =     a  b  c  d     b  +  d     .        r        a  b  c  d      a  c               a  b  c  d      b  d       \displaystyle r=\frac{\sqrt{abcd}}{a+c}=\frac{\sqrt{abcd}}{b+d}.     The circumradius  R is given as a special case of Parameshvara 's formula. It is 34       R  =    1  4       (    a  b   +   c  d    )    (    a  c   +   b  d    )    (    a  d   +   b  c    )     a  b  c  d       .      R      1  4             a  b     c  d        a  c     b  d        a  d     b  c       a  b  c  d        \displaystyle R=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{(ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)}{abcd}}.     The inradius can also be expressed in terms of the consecutive tangent lengths  e , f , g , h according to 35       r  =    e  g    =    f  h     .        r      e  g             f  h       \displaystyle r=\sqrt{eg}=\sqrt{fh}.     These two formulas are in fact necessary and sufficient conditions for a tangential quadrilateral with inradius r to be cyclic .  The four sides a , b , c , d of a bicentric quadrilateral are the four solutions of the quartic equation           y  4   -   2  s   y  3     +    (    s  2   +   2   r  2    +   2  r     4   R  2    +   r  2       )    y  2     -   2  r  s   (      4   R  2    +   r  2     +  r   )   y    +    r  2    s  2     =  0               superscript  y  4     2  s   superscript  y  3          superscript  s  2     2   superscript  r  2      2  r        4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2        superscript  y  2       2  r  s          4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2     r   y       superscript  r  2    superscript  s  2     0    y^{4}-2sy^{3}+(s^{2}+2r^{2}+2r\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}})y^{2}-2rs(\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}%
 }+r)y+r^{2}s^{2}=0     where s is the semiperimeter, and r and R are the inradius and circumradius respectively. 36  If there is a bicentric quadrilateral with inradius r whose tangent lengths are e , f , g , h , then there exists a bicentric quadrilateral with inradius r v whose tangent lengths are e v , f v , g v , h v , where v may be any real number . 37  A bicentric quadrilateral has a greater inradius than does any other tangential quadrilateral having the same sequence of side lengths. 38  Inequalities  The circumradius R and the inradius r satisfy the inequality      R  ≥    2   r       R      2   r     R\geq\sqrt{2}r     which was proved by L. Fejes Tóth in 1948. 39 It holds with equality only when the two circles are concentric (have the same center as each other); then the quadrilateral is a square . The inequality can be proved in several different ways, one is using the double inequality for the area above.  An extension of the previous inequality is 40        r   2    R   ≤    1  2    (     sin   A  2     cos   B  2     +    sin   B  2     cos   C  2     +    sin   C  2     cos   D  2     +    sin   D  2     cos   A  2      )    ≤  1            r    2    R       1  2           A  2        B  2           B  2        C  2           C  2        D  2           D  2        A  2            1     \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{R}\leq\frac{1}{2}\left(\sin{\frac{A}{2}}\cos{\frac{B}{2}}+%
 \sin{\frac{B}{2}}\cos{\frac{C}{2}}+\sin{\frac{C}{2}}\cos{\frac{D}{2}}+\sin{%
 \frac{D}{2}}\cos{\frac{A}{2}}\right)\leq 1     where there is equality on either side if and only if the quadrilateral is a square . 41  The semiperimeter  s of a bicentric quadrilateral satisfies 42        8  r   (      4   R  2    +   r  2     -  r   )     ≤  s  ≤      4   R  2    +   r  2     +  r             8  r          4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2     r     s               4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2     r      \sqrt{8r\left(\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}}-r\right)}\leq s\leq\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}}+r   where r and R are the inradius and circumradius respectively.  Moreover, 43       2  s   r  2    ≤    a  b  c   +   a  b  d   +   a  c  d   +   b  c  d    ≤   2  r    (   r  +     r  2   +   4   R  2       )   2            2  s   superscript  r  2        a  b  c     a  b  d     a  c  d     b  c  d           2  r   superscript    r       superscript  r  2     4   superscript  R  2       2       2sr^{2}\leq abc+abd+acd+bcd\leq 2r(r+\sqrt{r^{2}+4R^{2}})^{2}     and         a  b  c   +   a  b  d   +   a  c  d   +   b  c  d    ≤   2   K    (   K  +   2   R  2     )     .          a  b  c     a  b  d     a  c  d     b  c  d      2    K     K    2   superscript  R  2        abc+abd+acd+bcd\leq 2\sqrt{K}(K+2R^{2}).    44  Distance between the incenter and circumcenter  (Figure)  A bicentric quadrilateral ABCD with incenter I and circumcenter O   Fuss' theorem  Fuss' theorem gives a relation between the inradius  r , the circumradius  R and the distance x between the incenter  I and the circumcenter  O , for any bicentric quadrilateral. The relation is 45 46 47         1    (   R  -  x   )   2    +   1    (   R  +  x   )   2     =   1   r  2     ,          1   superscript    R  x   2      1   superscript    R  x   2       1   superscript  r  2      \frac{1}{(R-x)^{2}}+\frac{1}{(R+x)^{2}}=\frac{1}{r^{2}},     or equivalently        2   r  2    (    R  2   +   x  2    )    =    (    R  2   -   x  2    )   2    .        2   superscript  r  2      superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2      superscript     superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2    2     \displaystyle 2r^{2}(R^{2}+x^{2})=(R^{2}-x^{2})^{2}.     It was derived by Nicolaus Fuss (1755–1826) in 1792. Solving for x yields       x  =      R  2   +   r  2    -   r     4   R  2    +   r  2         .      x         superscript  R  2    superscript  r  2      r        4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2          x=\sqrt{R^{2}+r^{2}-r\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}}}.     Fuss's theorem, which is a generalization of Euler's theorem in geometry to a bicentric quadrilateral, says that if a quadrilateral is bicentric, then its two associated circles are related according to the above equations. In fact the converse also holds: given two circles (one within the other) with radii R and r and distance x between their centers satisfying the condition in Fuss' theorem, there exists a convex quadrilateral inscribed in one of them and tangent to the other 48 (and then by Poncelet's closure theorem , there exist infinitely many of them).  Applying     x  2   ≥  0       superscript  x  2   0    x^{2}\geq 0   to the expression of Fuss's theorem for x in terms of r and R is another way to obtain the above-mentioned inequality     R  ≥    2   r    .      R      2   r     R\geq\sqrt{2}r.   A generalization is 49         2   r  2    +   x  2    ≤   R  2   ≤    2   r  2    +   x  2   +   2  r  x     .            2   superscript  r  2     superscript  x  2     superscript  R  2            2   superscript  r  2     superscript  x  2     2  r  x       2r^{2}+x^{2}\leq R^{2}\leq 2r^{2}+x^{2}+2rx.     Carlitz' identity  Another formula for the distance x between the centers of the incircle and the circumcircle is due to the American mathematician Leonard Carlitz (1907–1999). It states that 50       x  2   =    R  2   -    2  R  r   ⋅  μ         superscript  x  2      superscript  R  2    normal-⋅    2  R  r   μ      \displaystyle x^{2}=R^{2}-2Rr\cdot\mu     where r and R are the inradius and the circumradius respectively, and      μ  =      (    a  b   +   c  d    )    (    a  d   +   b  c    )       (   a  +  c   )   2    (    a  c   +   b  d    )      =      (    a  b   +   c  d    )    (    a  d   +   b  c    )       (   b  +  d   )   2    (    a  c   +   b  d    )            μ            a  b     c  d        a  d     b  c        superscript    a  c   2       a  c     b  d                      a  b     c  d        a  d     b  c        superscript    b  d   2       a  c     b  d          \displaystyle\mu=\sqrt{\frac{(ab+cd)(ad+bc)}{(a+c)^{2}(ac+bd)}}=\sqrt{\frac{(%
 ab+cd)(ad+bc)}{(b+d)^{2}(ac+bd)}}     where a , b , c , d are the sides of the bicentric quadrilateral.  Inequalities for the tangent lengths and sides  For the tangent lengths  e , f , g , h the following inequalities holds: 51       4  r   ≤   e  +  f  +  g  +  h   ≤    4  r   ⋅     R  2   +   x  2      R  2   -   x  2              4  r     e  f  g  h         normal-⋅    4  r        superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2       superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2         4r\leq e+f+g+h\leq 4r\cdot\frac{R^{2}+x^{2}}{R^{2}-x^{2}}     and       4   r  2    ≤    e  2   +   f  2   +   g  2   +   h  2    ≤   4   (     R  2   +   x  2    -   r  2    )            4   superscript  r  2       superscript  e  2    superscript  f  2    superscript  g  2    superscript  h  2           4       superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2     superscript  r  2        4r^{2}\leq e^{2}+f^{2}+g^{2}+h^{2}\leq 4(R^{2}+x^{2}-r^{2})     where r is the inradius, R is the circumradius, and x is the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. The sides a , b , c , d satisfy the inequalities 52       8  r   ≤   a  +  b  +  c  +  d   ≤    8  r   ⋅     R  2   +   x  2      R  2   -   x  2              8  r     a  b  c  d         normal-⋅    8  r        superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2       superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2         8r\leq a+b+c+d\leq 8r\cdot\frac{R^{2}+x^{2}}{R^{2}-x^{2}}     and        4   (     R  2   -   x  2    +   2   r  2     )    ≤    a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2   +   d  2    ≤   4   (    3   R  2    -   2   r  2     )     .          4       superscript  R  2    superscript  x  2      2   superscript  r  2         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2           4      3   superscript  R  2      2   superscript  r  2         4(R^{2}-x^{2}+2r^{2})\leq a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}\leq 4(3R^{2}-2r^{2}).     Other properties of the incenter  The circumcenter , the incenter , and the intersection of the diagonals in a bicentric quadrilateral are collinear . 53  There is the following equality relating the four distances between the incenter I and the vertices of a bicentric quadrilateral ABCD : 54        1   I   A  2     +   1   I   C  2      =    1   I   B  2     +   1   I   D  2      =   1   r  2              1    I   superscript  A  2       1    I   superscript  C  2          1    I   superscript  B  2       1    I   superscript  D  2             1   superscript  r  2       \frac{1}{IA^{2}}+\frac{1}{IC^{2}}=\frac{1}{IB^{2}}+\frac{1}{ID^{2}}=\frac{1}{r%
 ^{2}}     where r is the inradius.  An inequality concerning the inradius r and circumradius R in a bicentric quadrilateral ABCD is 55       4   r  2    ≤      I  A   ⋅  I   C   +     I  B   ⋅  I   D    ≤   2   R  2            4   superscript  r  2         normal-⋅    I  A   I   C      normal-⋅    I  B   I   D           2   superscript  R  2       4r^{2}\leq IA\cdot IC+IB\cdot ID\leq 2R^{2}     where I is the incenter.  Properties of the diagonals  The lengths of the diagonals in a bicentric quadrilateral can be expressed in terms of the sides or the tangent lengths , which are formulas that holds in a cyclic quadrilateral and a tangential quadrilateral respectively.  In a bicentric quadrilateral with diagonals  p and q , the following identity holds: 56         p  q    4   r  2     -    4   R  2     p  q     =  1            p  q     4   superscript  r  2         4   superscript  R  2      p  q     1    \displaystyle\frac{pq}{4r^{2}}-\frac{4R^{2}}{pq}=1     where r and R are the inradius and the circumradius respectively. This equality can be rewritten as 57      r  =    p  q    2     p  q   +   4   R  2            r      p  q     2        p  q     4   superscript  R  2          r=\frac{pq}{2\sqrt{pq+4R^{2}}}     or, solving it as a quadratic equation for the product of the diagonals, in the form        p  q   =   2  r   (   r  +     4   R  2    +   r  2      )     .        p  q     2  r    r        4   superscript  R  2     superscript  r  2         pq=2r\left(r+\sqrt{4R^{2}+r^{2}}\right).     An inequality for the product of the diagonals p , q in a bicentric quadrilateral is 58       8  p  q   ≤    (   a  +  b  +  c  +  d   )   2         8  p  q    superscript    a  b  c  d   2     \displaystyle 8pq\leq(a+b+c+d)^{2}   where a , b , c , d are the sides.
