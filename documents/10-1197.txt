   Choline dehydrogenase      Choline dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a choline dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   choline + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   betaine aldehyde + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are choline and acceptor , whereas its two products are betaine aldehyde and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is choline:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include choline oxidase , choline-cytochrome c reductase , choline:(acceptor) oxidoreductase , and choline:(acceptor) 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , PQQ .
