   Radial function      Radial function   In mathematics , a radial function is a function defined on a Euclidean space  R n whose value at each point depends only on the distance between that point and the origin. For example, a radial function Φ in two dimensions has the form        Φ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   φ   (  r  )     ,   r  =     x  2   +   y  2         formulae-sequence      normal-Φ   x  y      φ  r      r       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        \Phi(x,y)=\varphi(r),\quad r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}   where φ is a function of a single non-negative real variable. Radial functions are contrasted with spherical functions , and any decent function (e.g., continuous and rapidly decreasing ) on Euclidean space can be decomposed into a series consisting of radial and spherical parts: the solid spherical harmonic expansion.  A function is radial if and only if it is invariant under all rotations leaving the origin fixed. That is, ƒ is radial if and only if       f  ∘  ρ   =   f         f  ρ   f    f\circ\rho=f\,   for all , the special orthogonal group in n dimensions. This characterization of radial functions makes it possible also to define radial distributions . These are distributions S on R n such that       S   [  ϕ  ]    =   S   [   φ  ∘  ρ   ]          S   delimited-[]  ϕ      S   delimited-[]    φ  ρ       S[\phi]=S[\varphi\circ\rho]   for every test function φ and rotation ρ.  Given any (locally integrable) function ƒ , its radial part is given by averaging over spheres centered at the origin. To wit,       ϕ   (  x  )    =    1   ω   n  -  1       ∫   S   n  -  1      f   (   r   x  ′    )   d   x  ′            ϕ  x       1   subscript  ω    n  1       subscript    superscript  S    n  1       f    r   superscript  x  normal-′    d   superscript  x  normal-′        \phi(x)=\frac{1}{\omega_{n-1}}\int_{S^{n-1}}f(rx^{\prime})\,dx^{\prime}   where ω n −1 is the surface area of the ( n −1)-sphere  S n −1 , and , . It follows essentially by Fubini's theorem that a locally integrable function has a well-defined radial part at almost every  r .  The Fourier transform of a radial function is also radial, and so radial functions play a vital role in Fourier analysis . Furthermore, the Fourier transform of a radial function typically has stronger decay behavior at infinity than non-radial functions: for radial functions bounded in a neighborhood of the origin, the Fourier transform decays faster than R −( n −1)/2 . The Bessel functions are a special class of radial function that arise naturally in Fourier analysis as the radial eigenfunctions of the Laplacian ; as such they appear naturally as the radial portion of the Fourier transform.
