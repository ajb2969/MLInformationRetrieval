Tsallis entropy

In physics, the Tsallis entropy is a generalization of the standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy. It was introduced in 1988 by Constantino Tsallis1 as a basis for generalizing the standard statistical mechanics. In the scientific literature, the physical relevance of the Tsallis entropy was occasionally debated. However, from the years 2000 on, an increasingly wide spectrum of natural, artificial and social complex systems have been identified which confirm the predictions and consequences that are derived from this nonadditive entropy, such as nonextensive statistical mechanics,2 which generalizes the Boltzmann–Gibbs theory.
Among the various experimental verifications and applications presently available in the literature, the following ones deserve a special mention:

The distribution characterizing the motion of cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices, predicted in 20033 and observed in 2006.4
The fluctuations of the magnetic field in the solar wind enabled the calculation of the q-triplet (or Tsallis triplet).5
The velocity distributions in driven dissipative dusty plasma.6
Spin glass relaxation.7
Trapped ion interacting with a classical buffer gas.8
High energy collisional experiments at LHC/CERN (CMS, ATLAS and ALICE detectors)910 and RHIC/Brookhaven (STAR and PHENIX detectors).11

Among the various available theoretical results which clarify the physical conditions under which Tsallis entropy and associated statistics apply, the following ones can be selected:

Anomalous diffusion.1213
Uniqueness theorem.14
Sensitivity to initial conditions and entropy production at the edge of chaos.1516
Probability sets which make the nonadditive Tsallis entropy to be extensive in the thermodynamical sense.17
Strongly quantum entangled systems and thermodynamics.18
Thermostatistics of overdamped motion of interacting particles.1920
Nonlinear generalizations of the Schroedinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.21

Given a discrete set of probabilities 
 
 
 
  with the condition 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  any real number, the Tsallis entropy is defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is a real parameter sometimes called entropic-index. In the limit as 
 
 
 
 , the usual Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy is recovered, namely



For continuous probability distributions, we define the entropy as



where 
 
 
 
  is a probability density function.
The Tsallis Entropy has been used along with the Principle of maximum entropy to derive the Tsallis distribution.
Various relationships
The discrete Tsallis entropy satisfies



where Dq is the q-derivative with respect to x. This may be compared to the standard entropy formula:



Non-additivity
Given two independent systems A and B, for which the joint probability density satisfies



the Tsallis entropy of this system satisfies



From this result, it is evident that the parameter 
 
 
 
  is a measure of the departure from additivity. In the limit when q = 1,



which is what is expected for an additive system. This property is sometimes referred to as "pseudo-additivity".
Exponential families
Many common distributions like the normal distribution belongs to the statistical exponential families. Tsallis entropy for an exponential family can be written 22 as


 
  where F is log-normalizer and k the term indicating the carrier measure. For multivariate normal, term k is zero, and therefore the Tsallis entropy is in closed-form.
Generalised entropies
A number of interesting physical systems23 abide to entropic functionals that are more general than the standard Tsallis entropy. Therefore, several physically meaningful generalisations have been introduced. The two most general of those are notably: Superstatistics, introduced by C. Beck and E.G.D. Cohen in 200324 and Spectral Statistics, introduced by G.A. Tsekouras and Constantino Tsallis in 2005.25 Both these entropic forms have Tsallis and Boltzmann–Gibbs statistics as special cases; Spectral Statistics has been proven to at least contain Superstatistics and it has been conjectured to also cover some additional cases.
