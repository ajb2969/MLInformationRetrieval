   Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis      Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis   Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis is a conceptual tool used in physics , chemistry , and engineering . This form of dimensional analysis expresses a functional relationship of some variables in the form of an exponential equation . It was named after Lord Rayleigh .  The method involves the following steps:   Gather all the independent variables that are likely to influence the dependent variable .  If R is a variable that depends upon independent variables R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , ..., R n , then the functional equation can be written as R = F ( R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , ..., R n ).  Write the above equation in the form    X  =   C   X  1  a    X  2  b    X  3  c   ⋯    X  n  m         X    C   superscript   subscript  X  1   a    superscript   subscript  X  2   b    superscript   subscript  X  3   c   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  X  n   m      X=CX_{1}^{a}X_{2}^{b}X_{3}^{c}\cdots X_{n}^{m}\,   where C is a dimensionless constant and a , b , c , ..., m are arbitrary exponents.  Express each of the quantities in the equation in some fundamental units in which the solution is required.  By using dimensional homogeneity , obtain a set of simultaneous equations involving the exponents a , b , c , ..., m .  Solve these equations to obtain the value of exponents a , b , c , ..., m .  Substitute the values of exponents in the main equation, and form the non-dimensional  parameters by grouping the variables with like exponents.   Drawback – It doesn't provide any information regarding number of dimensionless groups to be obtained as a result of dimension analysis  See also   Physical quantity  Buckingham pi theorem   "  Category:Dimensional analysis
