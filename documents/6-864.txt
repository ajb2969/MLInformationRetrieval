Zero-sum problem

In number theory, zero-sum problems are a certain class of combinatorial questions. In general, a finite abelian group G is considered. The zero-sum problem for the integer n is the following: Find the smallest integer k such that every sequence of elements of G with length 
 
 
 
  contains n terms that sum to 0.
In 1961 Paul Erdős, Abraham Ginzburg, and Abraham Ziv proved the general result for 
 
 
 
  (the integers mod n) that1



Explicitly this says that any multiset of 2n − 1 integers has a subset of size n the sum of whose elements is a multiple of n. This result is known as the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem after its discoverers: it may be deduced from the Cauchy–Davenport theorem.2
More general results than this theorem exist, such as Olson's theorem, Kemnitz's conjecture (proved by Christian Reiher in 20033), and the weighted EGZ theorem (proved by David J. Grynkiewicz in 20054).
