   Factor shares      Factor shares   In macroeconomics , factor shares are the share of production given to the factors of production , usually capital and labor . This concept uses the methods and fits into the framework of neoclassical economics .  Derivation  In exogenous growth models , the production function can be represented by:      Y  =   F   (  K  ,  L  )        Y    F   K  L      Y=F(K,L)\,     with Y total production, K capital, and L labor. So a representative agent will attempt to maximize a profit function:      π  =     m  a   x   {  K  ,  L  }    F   (  K  ,  L  )    *  P   -   r  K   -   w   L         π        m  a   subscript  x   K  L    F   K  L    P     r  K     w  L      \pi=max_{\{K,L\}}F(K,L)*P-rK-wL\,     where     r  K   +   w   L          r  K     w  L     rK+wL\,   is the cost to the firm, r the rental rate of capital, w the wage rate for labor, and P is the price of the output.  As in microeconomics  supply and demand models, first-order conditions that the derivative of this function with respect to capital and labor will be zero at the functions maximum. Thus (assuming P = 1 ) we can calculate the wages and the rental rate of capital:      w  =    D  L    [   F   (  K  ,  L  )    ]        w     subscript  D  L    delimited-[]    F   K  L        w=D_{L}[F(K,L)]\,   and    r  =    D  K    [   F   (  K  ,  L  )    ]        r     subscript  D  K    delimited-[]    F   K  L        r=D_{K}[F(K,L)]\,   .  Now we can write the expenditure allocated to labor as     w  L   =     D  L    [   F   (  K  ,  L  )    ]    *   L          w  L        subscript  D  L    delimited-[]    F   K  L      L     wL=D_{L}[F(K,L)]*L\,     and to capital as     r  K   =     D  K    [   F   (  K  ,  L  )    ]    *   K          r  K        subscript  D  K    delimited-[]    F   K  L      K     rK=D_{K}[F(K,L)]*K\,     So the factor share devoted to labor is:        w  L   /  Y   =       D  L    [   F   (  K  ,  L  )    ]    *  L   /  F    (  K  ,  L  )            w  L   Y            subscript  D  L    delimited-[]    F   K  L      L   F    K  L      wL/Y=D_{L}[F(K,L)]*L/F(K,L)\,     and the factor share devoted to capital is:        r  K   /  Y   =       D  K    [   F   (  K  ,  L  )    ]    *  K   /  F    (  K  ,  L  )            r  K   Y            subscript  D  K    delimited-[]    F   K  L      K   F    K  L      rK/Y=D_{K}[F(K,L)]*K/F(K,L)\,   "  Category:Macroeconomics
