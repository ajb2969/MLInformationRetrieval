   Goodstein's theorem      Goodstein's theorem   In mathematical logic , Goodstein's theorem is a statement about the natural numbers , proved by Reuben Goodstein in 1944, which states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Kirby and Paris 1 showed that it is unprovable in Peano arithmetic (but it can be proven in stronger systems, such as second order arithmetic ). This was the third example of a true statement that is unprovable in Peano arithmetic, after Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Gerhard Gentzen 's 1943 direct proof of the unprovability of ε 0 -induction in Peano arithmetic. The Paris–Harrington theorem was a later example.  Laurence Kirby and Jeff Paris introduced a graph theoretic hydra game with behavior similar to that of Goodstein sequences: the " Hydra " is a rooted tree, and a move consists of cutting off one of its "heads" (a branch of the tree), to which the hydra responds by growing a finite number of new heads according to certain rules. Kirby and Paris proved that the Hydra will eventually be killed, regardless of the strategy that Hercules uses to chop off its heads, though this may take a very long time. 2  Hereditary base- n notation  Goodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called "hereditary base- n notation". This notation is very similar to usual base- n positional notation, but the usual notation does not suffice for the purposes of Goodstein's theorem.  In ordinary base- n notation, where n is a natural number greater than 1, an arbitrary natural number m is written as a sum of multiples of powers of n :       m  =     a  k    n  k    +    a   k  -  1     n   k  -  1     +  ⋯  +   a  0     ,      m       subscript  a  k    superscript  n  k       subscript  a    k  1     superscript  n    k  1     normal-⋯   subscript  a  0      m=a_{k}n^{k}+a_{k-1}n^{k-1}+\cdots+a_{0},   where each coefficient a i satisfies , and . For example, in base 2,       35  =   32  +  2  +  1   =    2  5   +   2  1   +   2  0     .        35    32  2  1           superscript  2  5    superscript  2  1    superscript  2  0       35=32+2+1=2^{5}+2^{1}+2^{0}.   Thus the base 2 representation of 35 is 100011, which means . Similarly, 100 represented in base 3 is 10201:       100  =   81  +  18  +  1   =    3  4   +   2  ⋅   3  2    +   3  0     .        100    81  18  1           superscript  3  4    normal-⋅  2   superscript  3  2     superscript  3  0       100=81+18+1=3^{4}+2\cdot 3^{2}+3^{0}.   Note that the exponents themselves are not written in base- n notation. For example, the expressions above include 2 5 and 3 4 .  To convert a base- n representation to hereditary base n notation, first rewrite all of the exponents in base- n notation. Then rewrite any exponents inside the exponents, and continue in this way until every digit appearing in the expression is n or less.  For example, while 35 in ordinary base-2 notation is , it is written in hereditary base-2 notation as       35  =    2    2  2   +  1    +  2  +  1    ,      35     superscript  2     superscript  2  2   1    2  1     35=2^{2^{2}+1}+2+1,   using the fact that Similarly, 100 in hereditary base 3 notation is      100  =    3   3  +  1    +   2  ⋅   3  2    +  1.       100     superscript  3    3  1     normal-⋅  2   superscript  3  2    1.     100=3^{3+1}+2\cdot 3^{2}+1.     Goodstein sequences  The Goodstein sequence  G ( m ) of a number m is a sequence of natural numbers. The first element in the sequence G ( m ) is m itself. To get the second, G ( m )(2), write m in hereditary base 2 notation, change all the 2s to 3s, and then subtract 1 from the result. In general, the  term  of the Goodstein sequence of m is as follows: take the hereditary base  representation of G ( m )( n ), and replace each occurrence of the base  with  and then subtract one. Note that the next term depends both on the previous term and on the index n . Continue until the result is zero, at which point the sequence terminates.  Early Goodstein sequences terminate quickly. For example, G (3) terminates at the sixth step:      Base   Hereditary notation   Value   Notes       2        2  1   +  1       superscript  2  1   1    2^{1}+1      3   Write 3 in base 2 notation     3          3  1   +  1   -  1   =   3  1            superscript  3  1   1   1    superscript  3  1     3^{1}+1-1=3^{1}      3   Switch the 2 to a 3, then subtract 1     4         4  1   -  1   =  3         superscript  4  1   1   3    4^{1}-1=3      3   Switch the 3 to a 4, then subtract 1.

(Curiously, this is a Woodall number       3  ⋅   2  402653211    -  1   =    402653184  ⋅   2  402653184    -  1          normal-⋅  3   superscript  2  402653211    1      normal-⋅  402653184   superscript  2  402653184    1     3\cdot 2^{402653211}-1=402653184\cdot 2^{402653184}-1   . This is also the case with all other final bases for starting values greater than 4.)  However, even G (4) doesn't give a good idea of just how quickly the elements of a Goodstein sequence can increase.

Proof of Goodstein's theorem  Goodstein's theorem can be proved (using techniques outside Peano arithmetic, see below) as follows: Given a Goodstein sequence G ( m ), we construct a parallel sequence P ( m ) of ordinal numbers which is strictly decreasing and terminates. Then G ( m ) must terminate too, and it can terminate only when it goes to 0. A common misunderstanding of this proof is to believe that G ( m ) goes to 0 because it is dominated by P ( m ). In fact that P ( m ) dominates G ( m ) plays no role at all. The important points is: G ( m )( k ) exists if and only if P ( m )( k ) exists (parallelism). Then if P ( m ) terminates, so does G ( m ). And G ( m ) can terminate only when it comes to 0.  More precisely, each term P ( m )( n ) of the sequence P ( m ) is obtained by applying a function f on the term G ( m )( n ) of the Goodstein sequence of m as follows: take the hereditary base  representation of G ( m )( n ), and replace each occurrence of the base  with the first infinite ordinal number ω. For example and . Addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal numbers are well defined.   The base-changing operation of the Goodstein sequence when going from G ( m )( n ) to  does not change the value of f (that's the main point of the construction), thus after the minus 1 operation,  will be strictly smaller than P ( m )( n ). For example,     f   (    3  ⋅   4   4  4     +  4   )    =    3   ω   ω  ω     +  ω   =   f   (    3  ⋅   5   5  5     +  5   )            f     normal-⋅  3   superscript  4   superscript  4  4     4        3   superscript  ω   superscript  ω  ω     ω          f     normal-⋅  3   superscript  5   superscript  5  5     5       f(3\cdot 4^{4^{4}}+4)=3\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}+\omega=f(3\cdot 5^{5^{5}}+5)   , hence    f   (    3  ⋅   4   4  4     +  4   )       f     normal-⋅  3   superscript  4   superscript  4  4     4     f(3\cdot 4^{4^{4}}+4)   is strictly greater than     f   (    (    3  ⋅   5   5  5     +  5   )   -  1   )    .      f       normal-⋅  3   superscript  5   superscript  5  5     5   1     f((3\cdot 5^{5^{5}}+5)-1).      If the sequence G ( m ) did not go to 0, it would not terminate and would be infinite (since  would always exist). Consequently, P ( m ) also would be infinite (since in its turn  would always exist too). But P ( m ) is strictly decreasing and the standard order , which shows that Goodstein's theorem is not a theorem of Peano arithmetic, is technical and considerably more difficult. It makes use of countable nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic. What Kirby showed is that Goodstein's theorem leads to Gentzen's theorem , i.e. it can substitute for induction up to ε 0 .  Extended Goodstein's theorem  Suppose the definition Goodstein sequence is changed so that instead of replacing each occurrence of the base b with  it was replaces it with . Would the sequence still terminate? More generally, let b 1 , b 2 , b 3 , … be any sequences of integers. Then let the  term  of the extended Goodstein sequence of m be as follows: take the hereditary base b n representation of G ( m )( n ), and replace each occurrence of the base b n with and then subtract one. The claim is that this sequence still terminates. The extended proof defines  as follows: take the hereditary base b n representation of G ( m )( n ), and replace each occurrence of the base b n with the first infinite ordinal number ω. The base-changing operation of the Goodstein sequence when going from G ( m )( n ) to  still does not change the value of f . For example, if and if , then     f   (    3  ⋅   4   4  4     +  4   ,  4  )    =    3   ω   ω  ω     +  ω   =   f   (    3  ⋅   9   9  9     +  9   ,  9  )            f      normal-⋅  3   superscript  4   superscript  4  4     4   4        3   superscript  ω   superscript  ω  ω     ω          f      normal-⋅  3   superscript  9   superscript  9  9     9   9       f(3\cdot 4^{4^{4}}+4,4)=3\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}+\omega=f(3\cdot 9^{9^{9}}+9,9)   , hence the ordinal    f   (    3  ⋅   4   4  4     +  4   ,  4  )       f      normal-⋅  3   superscript  4   superscript  4  4     4   4     f(3\cdot 4^{4^{4}}+4,4)   is strictly greater than the ordinal     f   (    (    3  ⋅   9   9  9     +  9   )   -  1   ,  9  )    .      f        normal-⋅  3   superscript  9   superscript  9  9     9   1   9     f((3\cdot 9^{9^{9}}+9)-1,9).     Sequence length as a function of the starting value  The Goodstein function ,    𝒢  :   ℕ  →  ℕ      normal-:  𝒢   normal-→  ℕ  ℕ     \mathcal{G}:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\,\!   , is defined such that    𝒢   (  n  )       𝒢  n    \mathcal{G}(n)   is the length of the Goodstein sequence that starts with n . (This is a total function since every Goodstein sequence terminates.) The extreme growth-rate of   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}\,\!   can be calibrated by relating it to various standard ordinal-indexed hierarchies of functions, such as the functions    H  α     subscript  H  α    H_{\alpha}\,\!   in the Hardy hierarchy , and the functions    f  α     subscript  f  α    f_{\alpha}\,\!   in the fast-growing hierarchy of Löb and Wainer:   Kirby and Paris (1982) proved that      𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}\,\!   has approximately the same growth-rate as    H   ϵ  0      subscript  H   subscript  ϵ  0     H_{\epsilon_{0}}\,\!   (which is the same as that of    f   ϵ  0      subscript  f   subscript  ϵ  0     f_{\epsilon_{0}}\,\!   ); more precisely,   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}\,\!   dominates    H  α     subscript  H  α    H_{\alpha}\,\!   for every    α  <   ϵ  0       α   subscript  ϵ  0     \alpha<\epsilon_{0}\,\!   , and    H   ϵ  0      subscript  H   subscript  ϵ  0     H_{\epsilon_{0}}\,\!   dominates    𝒢  .    𝒢   \mathcal{G}\,\!.      (For any two functions     f  ,  g   :   ℕ  →  ℕ      normal-:   f  g    normal-→  ℕ  ℕ     f,g:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\,\!   ,   f   f   f\,\!   is said to dominate    g   g   g\,\!   if     f   (  n  )    >   g   (  n  )          f  n     g  n     f(n)>g(n)\,\!   for all sufficiently large   n   n   n\,\!   .)    Cichon (1983) showed that         𝒢   (  n  )    =     H    R  2  ω    (   n  +  1   )      (  1  )    -  1    ,        𝒢  n        subscript  H     superscript   subscript  R  2   ω     n  1     1   1     \mathcal{G}(n)=H_{R_{2}^{\omega}(n+1)}(1)-1,      where     R  2  ω    (  n  )        superscript   subscript  R  2   ω   n    R_{2}^{\omega}(n)   is the result of putting n in hereditary base-2 notation and then replacing all 2s with ω (as was done in the proof of Goodstein's theorem).    Caicedo (2007) showed that if    n  =    2   m  1    +   2   m  2    +  ⋯  +   2   m  k         n     superscript  2   subscript  m  1     superscript  2   subscript  m  2    normal-⋯   superscript  2   subscript  m  k       n=2^{m_{1}}+2^{m_{2}}+\cdots+2^{m_{k}}   with      m  1   >   m  2   >  ⋯  >   m  k    ,         subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2        normal-⋯        subscript  m  k      m_{1}>m_{2}>\cdots>m_{k},   then        𝒢   (  n  )    =     f    R  2  ω    (   m  1   )      (    f    R  2  ω    (   m  2   )      (   ⋯   (    f    R  2  ω    (   m  k   )      (  3  )    )   ⋯   )    )    -  2         𝒢  n        subscript  f     superscript   subscript  R  2   ω    subscript  m  1        subscript  f     superscript   subscript  R  2   ω    subscript  m  2       normal-⋯     subscript  f     superscript   subscript  R  2   ω    subscript  m  k     3   normal-⋯     2     \mathcal{G}(n)=f_{R_{2}^{\omega}(m_{1})}(f_{R_{2}^{\omega}(m_{2})}(\cdots(f_{R%

Application to computable functions  Goodstein's theorem can be used to construct a total computable function that Peano arithmetic cannot prove to be total. The Goodstein sequence of a number can be effectively enumerated by a Turing machine ; thus the function which maps n to the number of steps required for the Goodstein sequence of n to terminate is computable by a particular Turing machine. This machine merely enumerates the Goodstein sequence of n and, when the sequence reaches 0 , returns the length of the sequence. Because every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates, this function is total. But because Peano arithmetic does not prove that every Goodstein sequence terminates, Peano arithmetic does not prove that this Turing machine computes a total function.
