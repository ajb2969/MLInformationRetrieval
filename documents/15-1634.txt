GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase

GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase () is an enzyme with system name GDP:alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

GDP-alpha-D-glucose + phosphate

 
  alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + GDP
 

The enzyme may be involved in prevention of misincorporation of glucose in place of mannose residues into glycoconjugates.
