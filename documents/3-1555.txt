   Flat morphism      Flat morphism   In mathematics , in particular in the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry , a flat morphism  f from a scheme X to a scheme Y is a morphism such that the induced map on every stalk is a flat map of rings, i.e.,   f P : O Y,f(P) → O X,P    is a flat map for all P in X . 1 A map of rings A → B is called flat , if it is a homomorphism that makes B a flat A-module.  A morphism of schemes f is a faithfully flat morphism if f is a surjective flat morphism. 2  Two of the basic intuitions are that flatness is a generic property , and that the failure of flatness occurs on the jumping set of the morphism .  The first of these comes from commutative algebra : subject to some finiteness conditions on f , it can be shown that there is a non-empty open subscheme Y ′ of Y , such that f restricted to Y ′ is a flat morphism ( generic flatness ). Here 'restriction' is interpreted by means of fiber product , applied to f and the inclusion map of Y ′ into Y .  For the second, the idea is that morphisms in algebraic geometry can exhibit discontinuities of a kind that are detected by flatness. For instance, the operation of blowing down in the birational geometry of an algebraic surface , can give a single fiber that is of dimension 1 when all the others have dimension 0. It turns out (retrospectively) that flatness in morphisms is directly related to controlling this sort of semicontinuity , or one-sided jumping.  Flat morphisms are used to define (more than one version of) the flat topos , and flat cohomology of sheaves from it. This is a deep-lying theory, and has not been found easy to handle. The concept of étale morphism (and so étale cohomology ) depends on the flat morphism concept: an étale morphism being flat, of finite type, and unramified .  Properties of flat morphisms  Let  be a morphism of schemes. For a morphism , let  X × Y  Y ′}} and ( f , 1 Y ′ ) : X ′ → Y ′}} . f is flat if and only if for every g , the pullback f ′ * is an exact functor from the category of quasi-coherent    𝒪   Y  ′      subscript  𝒪   superscript  Y  normal-′     \mathcal{O}_{Y^{\prime}}   -modules to the category of quasi-coherent    𝒪   X  ′      subscript  𝒪   superscript  X  normal-′     \mathcal{O}_{X^{\prime}}   -modules. 3  Assume that  and  are morphisms of schemes. Assume furthermore that f is flat at x in X . Then g is flat at f ( x ) if and only if gf is flat at x . 4 In particular, if f is faithfully flat, then g is flat or faithfully flat if and only if gf is flat or faithfully flat, respectively. 5  Fundamental properties   The composite of two flat morphisms is flat. 6  The fibered product of two flat or faithfully flat morphisms is a flat or faithfully flat morphism, respectively. 7  Flatness and faithful flatness is preserved by base change: If f is flat or faithfully flat and , then the fiber product is flat or faithfully flat, respectively. 8  The set of points where a morphism (locally of finite presentation) is flat is open. 9  If f is faithfully flat and of finite presentation, and if gf is finite type or finite presentation, then g is of finite type or finite presentation, respectively. 10   Suppose that  is a flat morphism of schemes.   If F is a quasi-coherent sheaf of finite presentation on Y (in particular, if F is coherent), and if J is the annihilator of F on Y , then      f  *   J   →   𝒪  X      normal-→     superscript  f    J    subscript  𝒪  X     f^{*}J\to\mathcal{O}_{X}   , the pullback of the inclusion map, is an injection, and the image of f * J in    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   is the annihilator of f * F  on X . 11  If f is faithfully flat and if G is a quasi-coherent    𝒪  Y     subscript  𝒪  Y    \mathcal{O}_{Y}   -module, then the pullback map on global sections     Γ   (  Y  ,  G  )    →   Γ   (  X  ,    f  *   G   )       normal-→    normal-Γ   Y  G      normal-Γ   X     superscript  f    G       \Gamma(Y,G)\to\Gamma(X,f^{*}G)   is injective. 12   Suppose now that  is flat. Let X and Y be S -schemes, and let X ′ and Y ′ be their base change by h .   If  is quasi-compact and dominant, then its base change  is quasi-compact and dominant. 13  If h is faithfully flat, then the pullback map is injective. 14  Assume that  is quasi-compact and quasi-separated. Let Z be the closed image of X , and let  be the canonical injection. Then the closed subscheme determined by the base change  is the closed image of X ′. 15   Topological properties  If  is flat, then it possesses all of the following properties:   For every point x of X and every generization y ′ of , there is a generization x ′ of x such that . 16  For every point x of X ,     f   (   Spec   𝒪   X  ,  x     )    =   Spec   𝒪   Y  ,   f   (  x  )             f   Spec   subscript  𝒪   X  x       Spec   subscript  𝒪   Y    f  x        f(\operatorname{Spec}\,\mathcal{O}_{X,x})=\operatorname{Spec}\,\mathcal{O}_{Y,%
 f(x)}   . 17  For every irreducible closed subset Y ′ of Y , every irreducible component of f −1 ( Y ′) dominates Y . 18  If Z and Z ′ are two irreducible closed subsets of Y with Z contained in Z ′, then for every irreducible component T of f −1 ( Z ), there is an irreducible component T ′ of f −1 ( Z ′) containing T . 19  For every irreducible component T of X , the closure of f ( T ) is an irreducible component of Y . 20  If Y is irreducible with generic point y , and if f −1 ( y ) is irreducible, then X is irreducible. 21  If f is also closed, the image of every connected component of X is a connected component of Y . 22  For every pro-constructible subset Z of Y ,      f   -  1     (   Z  ¯   )    =     f   -  1     (  Z  )    ¯          superscript  f    1     normal-¯  Z     normal-¯     superscript  f    1    Z      f^{-1}(\bar{Z})=\overline{f^{-1}(Z)}   . 23   If f is flat and locally of finite presentation, then f is universally open. 24 However, if f is faithfully flat and quasi-compact, it is not in general true that f is open, even if X and Y are noetherian. 25 Furthermore, no converse to this statement holds: If f is the canonical map from the reduced scheme X red to X , then f is a universal homeomorphism, but for X noetherian, f is never flat. 26  If  is faithfully flat, then:   The topology on Y is the quotient topology relative to f . 27  If f is also quasi-compact, and if Z is a subset of Y , then Z is a locally closed pro-constructible subset of Y if and only if f −1 ( Z ) is a locally closed pro-constructible subset of X . 28   If f is flat and locally of finite presentation, then for each of the following properties P , the set of points where f has P is open: 29   Serre's condition S k (for any fixed k ).  Geometrically regular.  Geometrically normal.   If in addition f is proper, then the same is true for each of the following properties: 30   Geometrically reduced.  Geometrically reduced and having k geometric connected components (for any fixed k ).  Geometrically integral.   Flatness and dimension  Assume that X and Y are locally noetherian, and let .   Let x be a point of X and . If f is flat, then dim y  Y + dim x  f −1 ( y )}} . 31 Conversely, if this equality holds for all x , X is Cohen–Macaulay , and Y is regular , then f is flat. 32  If f is faithfully flat, then for each closed subset Z of Y , codim X ( f −1 ( Z ))}} . 33  Suppose that f is flat and that F is a quasi-coherent module over Y . If F has projective dimension at most n , then f * F has projective dimension at most n . 34   Descent properties   Assume f is flat at x in X . If X is reduced or normal at x , then Y is reduced or normal, respectively, at f ( x ). 35 Conversely, if f is also of finite presentation and f −1 ( y ) is reduced or normal, respectively, at x , then X is reduced or normal, respectively, at x . 36  In particular, if f is faithfully flat, then X reduced or normal implies that Y is reduced or normal, respectively. If f is faithfully flat and of finite presentation, then all the fibers of f reduced or normal implies that X is reduced or normal, respectively.  If f is flat at x in X , and if X is integral or integrally closed at x , then Y is integral or integrally closed, respectively, at f ( x ). 37  If f is faithfully flat, X is locally integral, and the topological space of Y is locally noetherian, then Y is locally integral. 38  If f is faithfully flat and quasi-compact, and if X is locally noetherian, then Y is also locally noetherian. 39  Assume that f is flat and X and Y are locally noetherian. If X is regular at x , then Y is regular at f ( x ). Conversely, if Y is regular at f ( x ) and f −1 ( f ( x )) is regular at x , then X is regular at x . 40  Assume again that f is flat and X and Y are locally noetherian. If X is normal at x , then Y is normal at f ( x ). Conversely, if Y is normal at f ( x ) and f −1 ( f ( x )) is normal at x , then X is normal at x . 41   Let  be faithfully flat. Let F be a quasi-coherent sheaf on Y , and let F ′ be the pullback of F to Y ′. Then F is flat over Y if and only if F ′ is flat over Y ′. 42  Assume that f is faithfully flat and quasi-compact. Let G be a quasi-coherent sheaf on Y , and let F denote its pullback to X . Then F is finite type, finite presentation, or locally free of rank n if and only if G has the corresponding property. 43  Suppose that  is an S -morphism of S -schemes. Let  be faithfully flat and quasi-compact, and let X ′, Y ′, and f ′ denote the base changes by g . Then for each of the following properties P , f has P if and only if f ′ has P . 44   Open.  Universally open.  Closed.  Universally closed.  A homeomorphism.  A universal homeomorphism.  Quasi-compact.  Quasi-compact and universally bicontinuous.  Quasi-compact and a homeomorphism onto its image.  Quasi-compact and dominant.  Separated.  Quasi-separated.  Locally of finite type.  Locally of finite presentation.  Finite type.  Finite presentation.  Proper.  An isomorphism.  A monomorphism.  An open immersion.  A quasi-compact immersion.  A closed immersion.  Affine.  Quasi-affine.  Finite.  Quasi-finite.  Integral.   It is possible for f ′ to be a local isomorphism without f being even a local immersion. 45  If f is quasi-compact and L is an invertible sheaf on X , then L is f -ample or f -very ample if and only if its pullback L ′ is f ′-ample or f ′-very ample, respectively. 46 However, it is not true that f is projective if and only if f ′ is projective. It is not even true that if f is proper and f ′ is projective, then f is quasi-projective, because it is possible to have an f ′-ample sheaf on X ′ which does not descend to X . 47  See also   fpqc morphism   Notes  References    , section 6.
