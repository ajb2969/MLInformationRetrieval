Quadratic integral

In mathematics, a quadratic integral is an integral of the form



It can be evaluated by completing the square in the denominator.



Positive-discriminant case
Assume that the discriminant q = b2 − 4ac is positive. In that case, define u and A by


 
 ,
and



The quadratic integral can now be written as



The partial fraction decomposition



allows us to evaluate the integral:



The final result for the original integral, under the assumption that q > 0, is



Negative-discriminant case

This (hastily written) section may need attention.


In case the discriminant q = b2 − 4ac is negative, the second term in the denominator in



is positive. Then the integral becomes
