Non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase

In enzymology, the term non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase () describes a class of enzymes that belong to the family of transferases, specifically protein-serine/threonine kinases. These enzymes transfer phosphates to the oxygen atom of a serine or threonine sidechain in proteins. This process is called phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation in particular plays a significant role in a wide range of cellular processes and is a very important posttranslational modification.
The chemical reaction performed by these enzymes can be written as

ATP + a protein 
 
 
 
  ADP + a phosphoprotein
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and a protein, whereas its two products are ADP and phosphoprotein.
The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:protein phosphotransferase (non-specific).
