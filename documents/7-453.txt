Life and work
Harbater was born in New York City and attended Stuyvesant High School, where he was on the math team. After graduating in 1970, he entered Harvard University.
After graduating summa cum laude in 1974, Harbater earned a master's degree from Brandeis University and then a Ph.D. in 1978 from MIT, where he wrote a dissertation (Deformation Theory and the Fundamental Group in Algebraic Geometry) under the direction of Michael Artin.
In 1995, Harbater was awarded the Cole Prize for his solution, with Michel Raynaud, of the long outstanding Abhyankar conjecture. He has also solved the inverse Galois problem over 
 
 
 
 , and made many other significant contributions to the field of Galois theory.
In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.1
Harbater's recent work on patching over fields, together with Julia Hartmann and Daniel Krashen, has had applications in such varied fields as quadratic forms, central simple algebras and local-global principles.
