8-Hydroxy-5-deazaflavin:NADPH oxidoreductase

8-Hydroxy-5-deazaflavin:NADPH oxidoreductase (, 8-OH-5dFl:NADPH oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name reduced coenzyme F420:NADP+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

reduced coenzyme F420 + NADP+

coenzyme F420 + NADPH + H+


The enzyme requires the 5-deazaflavin structure, as well as an 8-hydroxy group in the substrate.
