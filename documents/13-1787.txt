   Summation equation      Summation equation   In mathematics , a summation equation or discrete integral equation is an equation in which an unknown function appears under a summation sign. The theories of summation equations and integral equations can be unified as integral equations on time scales 1 using time scale calculus . A summation equation compares to a difference equation as an integral equation compares to a differential equation .  The Volterra summation equation is:       x   (  t  )    =    f   (  t  )    +    ∑   i  =  m   n    k   (  t  ,  s  ,   x   (  s  )    )            x  t       f  t     superscript   subscript     i  m    n     k   t  s    x  s         x(t)=f(t)+\sum_{i=m}^{n}k(t,s,x(s))   where x is the unknown function, and s, a, t are integers, and f, k are known functions.
