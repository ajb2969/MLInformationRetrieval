   Breather      Breather   In physics, a breather is a nonlinear  wave in which energy concentrates in a localized and oscillatory fashion. This contradicts with the expectations derived from the corresponding linear system for infinitesimal  amplitudes , which tends towards an even distribution of initially localized energy.  A discrete breather is a breather solution on a nonlinear lattice .  The term breather originates from the characteristic that most breathers are localized in space and oscillate ( breathe ) in time. 1 But also the opposite situation: oscillations in space and localized in time, is denoted as a breather.  Overview  A breather is a localized periodic solution of either continuous media equations or discrete lattice equations. The exactly solvable sine-Gordon equation 2 and the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation 3 are examples of one- dimensional  partial differential equations that possess breather solutions. 4 Discrete nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices in many cases support breather solutions.  Breathers are solitonic structures. There are two types of breathers: standing or traveling ones. 5 Standing breathers correspond to localized solutions whose amplitude vary in time (they are sometimes called oscillons ). A necessary condition for the existence of breathers in discrete lattices is that the breather main frequency and all its multipliers are located outside of the phonon  spectrum of the lattice.  Example of a breather solution for the sine-Gordon equation  The sine-Gordon equation is the nonlinear dispersive partial differential equation            ∂  2   u    ∂   t  2     -     ∂  2   u    ∂   x  2      +   sin  u    =  0   ,              superscript   2   u      superscript  t  2         superscript   2   u      superscript  x  2        u    0    \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}}-\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+\sin

An exact solution found by using the inverse scattering transform is: 6       u  =   4   arctan   (       1  -   ω  2       cos   (   ω  t   )       ω    cosh   (      1  -   ω  2      x   )      )      ,      u    4            1   superscript  ω  2         ω  t       ω          1   superscript  ω  2     x          u=4\arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1-\omega^{2}}\;\cos(\omega t)}{\omega\;\cosh(\sqrt%
 {1-\omega^{2}}\;x)}\right),     which, for ''ω The focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation has a nonlinearity parameter κ of the same sign (mathematics) as the dispersive term proportional to ∂ 2 u/∂x 2 , and has soliton solutions. In the de-focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation the nonlinearity parameter is of opposite sign. is the dispersive partial differential equation:          i     ∂  u    ∂  t     +     ∂  2   u    ∂   x  2     +     |  u  |   2   u    =  0   ,          i      u     t         superscript   2   u      superscript  x  2        superscript    u   2   u    0    i\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+|u|^{2}u%

One of the breather solutions is 7        u  =     (       2    b  2    cosh   (  θ  )     +    2    i    b      2  -   b  2       sinh   (  θ  )         2    cosh   (  θ  )     -     2      2  -   b  2      cos   (    a    b   x   )       -  1   )    a    exp   (    i     a  2    t   )     with     θ  =     a  2     b      2  -   b  2      t     ,     formulae-sequence    u             2   superscript  b  2     θ      2  i  b      2   superscript  b  2       θ         2    θ        2       2   superscript  b  2         a  b  x       1   a      i   superscript  a  2   t     with      θ     superscript  a  2   b      2   superscript  b  2     t      u=\left(\frac{2\,b^{2}\cosh(\theta)+2\,i\,b\,\sqrt{2-b^{2}}\;\sinh(\theta)}{2%

These breathers exist for values of the modulation parameter b less than √ 2 . Note that a limiting case of the breather solution is the Peregrine soliton . 8  See also   Breather surface  Soliton   References and notes  "  Category:Waves     ↩   Translated from Teoreticheskaya i Matematicheskaya Fizika 72(2): 183–196, August, 1987. ↩  ↩  Miroshnichenko A, Vasiliev A, Dmitriev S.
