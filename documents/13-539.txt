   Du Val singularity      Du Val singularity   In algebraic geometry , a du Val singularity , also called simple surface singularity , Kleinian singularity , or rational double point , is an isolated singularity of a complex surface which is modeled on a double branched cover of the plane, with minimal resolution obtained by replacing the singular point with a tree of smooth rational curves, with intersection pattern dual to a Dynkin diagram of A-D-E singularity type. They are the canonical singularities (or, equivalently, rational Gorenstein singularities) in dimension 2. They were studied by  and Felix Klein .  The du Val singularities also appear as quotients of C 2 by a finite subgroup of SL 2 ( C ) ; equivalently, a finite subgroup of SU(2), which are known as binary polyhedral groups . The rings of invariant polynomials of these finite group actions were computed by Klein, and are essentially the coordinate rings of the singularities; this is a classic result in invariant theory .  Classification  The possible du Val singularities are (up to analytic isomorphism):   A n       w  2   +   x  2   +   y   n  +  1     =  0         superscript  w  2    superscript  x  2    superscript  y    n  1     0    w^{2}+x^{2}+y^{n+1}=0     D n      w  2   +  y   (   x  2   +   y   n  -  2    )   =  0   (  n  ≥  4  )      fragments   superscript  w  2    y   fragments  normal-(   superscript  x  2     superscript  y    n  2    normal-)    0  italic-   fragments  normal-(  n   4  normal-)     w^{2}+y(x^{2}+y^{n-2})=0\qquad(n\geq 4)     E 6       w  2   +   x  3   +   y  4    =  0         superscript  w  2    superscript  x  3    superscript  y  4    0    w^{2}+x^{3}+y^{4}=0     E 7       w  2   +   x   (    x  2   +   y  3    )     =  0         superscript  w  2     x     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  3      0    w^{2}+x(x^{2}+y^{3})=0     E 8       w  2   +   x  3   +   y  5    =  0.         superscript  w  2    superscript  x  3    superscript  y  5    0.    w^{2}+x^{3}+y^{5}=0.
