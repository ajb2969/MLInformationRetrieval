   Rupture field      Rupture field   In abstract algebra , a rupture field of a polynomial     P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   over a given field    K   K   K   such that     P   (  X  )    ∈   K   [  X  ]          P  X     K   delimited-[]  X      P(X)\in K[X]   is a field extension of   K   K   K   generated by a root    a   a   a   of    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   . 1  For instance, if    K  =  ℚ      K  ℚ    K=\mathbb{Q}   and     P   (  X  )    =    X  3   -  2         P  X      superscript  X  3   2     P(X)=X^{3}-2   then    ℚ   [   2  3   ]       ℚ   delimited-[]     3   2      \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]   is a rupture field for    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   .  The notion is interesting mainly if    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   is irreducible over   K   K   K   . In that case, all rupture fields of    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   over   K   K   K   are isomorphic, non canonically, to     K  P   =    K   [  X  ]    /   (   P   (  X  )    )         subscript  K  P       K   delimited-[]  X      P  X      K_{P}=K[X]/(P(X))   : if    L  =   K   [  a  ]        L    K   delimited-[]  a      L=K[a]   where   a   a   a   is a root of    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   , then the ring homomorphism    f   f   f   defined by     f   (  k  )    =  k        f  k   k    f(k)=k   for all    k  ∈  K      k  K    k\in K   and     f   (   X  mod  P   )    =  a        f   modulo  X  P    a    f(X\mod P)=a   is an isomorphism . Also, in this case the degree of the extension equals the degree of   P   P   P   .  A rupture field of a polynomial does not necessarily contain all the roots of that polynomial : in the above example the field    ℚ   [   2  3   ]       ℚ   delimited-[]     3   2      \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt[3]{2}]   does not contain the other two (complex) roots of    P   (  X  )       P  X    P(X)   (namely    ω   2  3       ω     3   2     \omega\sqrt[3]{2}   and     ω  2    2  3        superscript  ω  2      3   2     \omega^{2}\sqrt[3]{2}   where   ω   ω   \omega   is a primitive third root of unity). For a field containing all the roots of a polynomial , see the splitting field .  Examples  A rupture field of     X  2   +  1       superscript  X  2   1    X^{2}+1   over   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   . It is also a splitting field .  The rupture field of     X  2   +  1       superscript  X  2   1    X^{2}+1   over    𝔽  3     subscript  𝔽  3    \mathbb{F}_{3}   is    𝔽  9     subscript  𝔽  9    \mathbb{F}_{9}   since there is no element of    𝔽  3     subscript  𝔽  3    \mathbb{F}_{3}   with square equal to    -  1      1    -1   (and all quadratic extensions of    𝔽  3     subscript  𝔽  3    \mathbb{F}_{3}   are isomorphic to    𝔽  9     subscript  𝔽  9    \mathbb{F}_{9}   ).
