Rupture field

In abstract algebra, a rupture field of a polynomial

 
  over a given field

 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a field extension of 
 
 
 
  generated by a root

 
  of 
 
 
 
 .1
For instance, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is a rupture field for 
 
 
 
 .
The notion is interesting mainly if 
 
 
 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
 . In that case, all rupture fields of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic, non canonically, to 
 
 
 
 : if 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a root of 
 
 
 
 , then the ring homomorphism

 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism. Also, in this case the degree of the extension equals the degree of 
 
 
 
 .
A rupture field of a polynomial does not necessarily contain all the roots of that polynomial: in the above example the field 
 
 
 
  does not contain the other two (complex) roots of 
 
 
 
  (namely 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a primitive third root of unity). For a field containing all the roots of a polynomial, see the splitting field.
Examples
A rupture field of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . It is also a splitting field.
The rupture field of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  since there is no element of 
 
 
 
  with square equal to 
 
 
 
  (and all quadratic extensions of 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 ).
