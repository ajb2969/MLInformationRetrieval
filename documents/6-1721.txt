   Graph pebbling      Graph pebbling   Graph pebbling is a mathematical game and area of interest played on a graph with pebbles on the vertices . 'Game play' is composed of a series of pebbling moves. A pebbling move on a graph consists of taking two pebbles off one vertex and placing one on an adjacent vertex (the second removed pebble is discarded from play). π( G ), the pebbling number of a graph G is the lowest natural number  n that satisfies the following condition:   Given any target or 'root' vertex in the graph and any initial configuration of n pebbles on the graph, it is possible, after a series of pebbling moves, to reach a new configuration in which the designated root vertex has one or more pebbles.   For example, on a graph with 2 vertices and 1 edge connecting them the pebbling number is 2. No matter how the two pebbles are placed on the vertices of the graph it is always possible to move a pebble to any vertex in the graph. One of the central questions of graph pebbling is the value of π( G ) for a given graph G .  Other topics in pebbling include cover pebbling, optimal pebbling, domination cover pebbling, bounds, and thresholds for pebbling numbers, deep graphs, and others.  π( G ) — the pebbling number of a graph  The game of pebbling was first suggested by Lagarias and Saks, as a tool for solving a particular problem in number theory . In 1989 F.R.K. Chung introduced the concept in the literature 1 and defined the pebbling number, π( G ).  The pebbling number for a complete graph on n vertices is easily verified to be n : If we had ( n − 1) pebbles to put on the graph, then we could put 1 pebble on each vertex except one. This would make it impossible to place a pebble on the last vertex. Since this last vertex could have been the designated target vertex, the pebbling number must be greater than n − 1. If we were to add 1 more pebble to the graph there are 2 possible cases. First, we could add it to the empty vertex, which would put a pebble on every vertex. Or secondly, we could add it to one of the vertices with only 1 pebble on them. Once any vertex has 2 pebbles on it, it becomes possible to make a pebbling move to any other vertex in the complete graph.  π( G ) for families of graphs       π   (   K  n   )    =  n        π   subscript  K  n    n    \scriptstyle\pi(K_{n})\,=\,n   where    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   is a complete graph on n vertices.       π   (   P  n   )    =   2   n  -  1          π   subscript  P  n     superscript  2    n  1      \scriptstyle\pi(P_{n})\,=\,2^{n-1}   where    P  n     subscript  P  n    P_{n}   is a path graph on n vertices.       π   (   W  n   )    =  n        π   subscript  W  n    n    \scriptstyle\pi(W_{n})\,=\,n   where    W  n     subscript  W  n    W_{n}   is a wheel graph on n vertices.  γ( G ) — the cover pebbling number of a graph  Crull et al. 2 introduced the concept of cover pebbling. γ( G ), the cover pebbling number of a graph is the minimum number of pebbles needed so that from any initial arrangement of the pebbles, after a series of pebbling moves, it is possible to have at least 1 pebble on every vertex of a graph. Vuong and Wyckoff 3 proved a theorem known as the stacking theorem which essentially finds the cover pebbling number for any graph: this theorem was proved at about the same time by Jonas Sjostrand. 4  The stacking theorem  The stacking theorem states the initial configuration of pebbles that requires the most pebbles to be cover solved happens when all pebbles are placed on a single vertex. From there they state:       s   (  v  )    =    ∑   u  ∈   V   (  G  )       2   d   (  u  ,  v  )            s  v     subscript     u    V  G      superscript  2    d   u  v        s(v)=\sum_{u\in V(G)}2^{d(u,v)}     Do this for every vertex v in G . d ( u , v ) denotes the distance from u to v . Then the cover pebbling number is the largest s ( v ) that results.  γ( G ) for families of graphs       γ   (   K  n   )    =    2  n   -  1         γ   subscript  K  n        2  n   1     \scriptstyle\gamma(K_{n})\,=\,2n-1   where    K  n     subscript  K  n    \scriptstyle K_{n}   is a complete graph on n vertices.       γ   (   P  n   )    =    2  n   -  1         γ   subscript  P  n       superscript  2  n   1     \scriptstyle\gamma(P_{n})\,=\,2^{n}-1   where    P  n     subscript  P  n    \scriptstyle P_{n}   is a path on n vertices.       γ   (   W  n   )    =    4  n   -  9         γ   subscript  W  n        4  n   9     \scriptstyle\gamma(W_{n})\,=\,4n-9   where    W  n     subscript  W  n    \scriptstyle W_{n}   is a wheel graph on n vertices.
