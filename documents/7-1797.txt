   Kuhn length      Kuhn length   (Figure)  Bond angle   The Kuhn length is a theoretical treatment, developed by Werner Kuhn , in which a real polymer chain is considered as a collection of   N   N   N    Kuhn segments each with a Kuhn length   b   b   b   . Each Kuhn segment can be thought of as if they are freely jointed with each other. 1 2 3 Each segment in a freely jointed chain can randomly orient in any direction without the influence of any forces, independent of the directions taken by other segments. Instead of considering a real chain consisting of   n   n   n   bonds and with fixed bond angles, torsion angles, and bond lengths, Kuhn considered an equivalent ideal chain with   N   N   N   connected segments, now called Kuhn segments, that can orient in any random direction.  The length of a fully stretched chain is    L  =   N  b       L    N  b     L=Nb   for the Kuhn segment chain. 4 In the simplest treatment, such a chain follows the random walk model, where each step taken in a random direction is independent of the directions taken in the previous steps, forming a random coil . The average end-to-end distance for a chain satisfying the random walk model is     ⟨   R  2   ⟩   =   N   b  2         delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  R  2      N   superscript  b  2      \langle R^{2}\rangle=Nb^{2}   .  Since the space occupied by a segment in the polymer chain cannot be taken by another segment, a self-avoiding random walk model can also be used. The Kuhn segment construction is useful in that it allows complicated polymers to be treated with simplified models as either a random walk or a self-avoiding walk , which can simplify the treatment considerably.  For an actual homopolymer chain (consists of the same repeat units) with bond length   l   l   l   and bond angle θ with a dihedral angle energy potential, the average end-to-end distance can be obtained as       ⟨   R  2   ⟩   =    n   l  2     1  +   cos   (  θ  )      1  -   cos   (  θ  )       ⋅    1  +   ⟨   cos   (  ϕ  )    ⟩     1  -   ⟨   cos   (  ϕ  )    ⟩           delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  R  2     normal-⋅    n   superscript  l  2       1    θ      1    θ          1   delimited-⟨⟩    ϕ       1   delimited-⟨⟩    ϕ         \langle R^{2}\rangle=nl^{2}\frac{1+\cos(\theta)}{1-\cos(\theta)}\cdot\frac{1+%
 \langle\cos(\textstyle\phi\,\!)\rangle}{1-\langle\cos(\textstyle\phi\,\!)\rangle}   ,    where    ⟨   cos   (  ϕ  )    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩    ϕ     \langle\cos(\textstyle\phi\,\!)\rangle   is the average cosine of the dihedral angle.     The fully stretched length    L  =   n   l    cos   (   θ  /  2   )         L    n  l      θ  2       L=nl\,\cos(\theta/2)   . By equating    ⟨   R  2   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  R  2     \langle R^{2}\rangle   and   L   L   L   for the actual chain and the equivalent chain with Kuhn segments, the number of Kuhn segments   N   N   N   and the Kuhn segment length   b   b   b   can be obtained.  For worm-like chain , Kuhn length equals two times the persistence length . 5  References  "  Category:Polymer chemistry  Category:Polymer physics     Flory, P.J.
