Strong monad

In category theory, a strong monad over a monoidal category (C, ⊗, I) is a monad (T, η, μ) together with a natural transformation tA,B : A ⊗ TB → T(A ⊗ B), called (tensorial) strength, such that the diagrams

,
 

and




commute for every object A, B and C (see Definition 3.2 in 1).
If the monoidal category (C, ⊗, I) is closed then a strong monad is the same thing as a C-enriched monad.
Commutative strong monads
For every strong monad T on a symmetric monoidal category, a costrength natural transformation can be defined by


 
 . A strong monad T is said to be commutative when the diagram




commutes for all objects 
 
 
 
  and

One interesting fact about commutative strong monads is that they are "the same as" symmetric monoidal monads. More explicitly,

a commutative strong monad 
 
 
 
  defines a symmetric monoidal monad 
 
 
 
  by





and conversely a symmetric monoidal monad 
 
 
 
  defines a commutative strong monad 
 
 
 
  by



 
  and the conversion between one and the other presentation is bijective.
