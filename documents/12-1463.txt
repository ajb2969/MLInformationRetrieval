Covering number

In mathematics, the idea of a covering number is to count how many small spherical balls would be needed to completely cover (with overlap) a given space. There are two closely related concepts as well, the packing number, which counts how many disjoint balls fit in a space, and the metric entropy, which counts how many points fit in a space when constrained to lie at some fixed minimum distance apart.
Mathematical Definition
More precisely, consider a subset 
 
 
 
  of a metric space

 
  and a parameter 
 
 
 
 . Denote the ball of radius 
 
 
 
  centered at the point 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . There are two notions of covering number, internal and external, along with the packing number and the metric entropy.

The packing number

 
  is the largest number of points 
 
 
 
  such that the balls 
 
 
 
  fit within K and are pairwise disjoint.
The internal covering number

 
  is the fewest number of points 
 
 
 
  such that the balls 
 
 
 
  cover 
 
 
 
 .
The external covering number

 
  is the fewest number of points 
 
 
 
  such that the balls 
 
 
 
  cover 
 
 
 
 .
The metric entropy

 
  is the largest number of points 
 
 
 
  such that the points are 
 
 
 
 -separated, i.e. 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .

Inequalities and Monotonicity
The internal and external covering numbers, the packing number, and the metric entropy are all closely related. The following chain of inequalities holds for any 
 
 
 
 .1


In addition, the quantities 
 
 
 
  are non-increasing in 
 
 
 
  and non-decreasing in 
 
 
 
  for each of 
 
 
 
 . However, monotonicity in 
 
 
 
  can in general fail for 
 
 
 
 .
