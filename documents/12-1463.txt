   Covering number      Covering number   In mathematics, the idea of a covering number is to count how many small spherical balls would be needed to completely cover (with overlap) a given space. There are two closely related concepts as well, the packing number , which counts how many disjoint balls fit in a space, and the metric entropy , which counts how many points fit in a space when constrained to lie at some fixed minimum distance apart.  Mathematical Definition  More precisely, consider a subset   K   K   K   of a metric space     (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   and a parameter    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   . Denote the ball of radius   ε   ε   \varepsilon   centered at the point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   by     B  ε    (  x  )        subscript  B  ε   x    B_{\varepsilon}(x)   . There are two notions of covering number, internal and external, along with the packing number and the metric entropy.   The packing number      N  ε  pack    (  K  )        subscript   superscript  N  pack   ε   K    N^{\text{pack}}_{\varepsilon}(K)   is the largest number of points     x  i   ∈  K       subscript  x  i   K    x_{i}\in K   such that the balls     B  ε    (   x  i   )        subscript  B  ε    subscript  x  i     B_{\varepsilon}(x_{i})   fit within K and are pairwise disjoint.  The internal covering number      N  ε  int    (  K  )        subscript   superscript  N  int   ε   K    N^{\text{int}}_{\varepsilon}(K)   is the fewest number of points     x  i   ∈  K       subscript  x  i   K    x_{i}\in K   such that the balls     B  ε    (   x  i   )        subscript  B  ε    subscript  x  i     B_{\varepsilon}(x_{i})   cover   K   K   K   .  The external covering number      N  ε  ext    (  K  )        subscript   superscript  N  ext   ε   K    N^{\text{ext}}_{\varepsilon}(K)   is the fewest number of points     x  i   ∈  X       subscript  x  i   X    x_{i}\in X   such that the balls     B  ε    (   x  i   )        subscript  B  ε    subscript  x  i     B_{\varepsilon}(x_{i})   cover   K   K   K   .  The metric entropy      N  ε  met    (  K  )        subscript   superscript  N  met   ε   K    N^{\text{met}}_{\varepsilon}(K)   is the largest number of points     x  i   ∈  K       subscript  x  i   K    x_{i}\in K   such that the points are   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -separated, i.e.     d   (   x  i   ,   x  j   )    ≥  ε        d    subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j     ε    d(x_{i},x_{j})\geq\varepsilon   for all    i  ≠  j      i  j    i\neq j   .   Inequalities and Monotonicity  The internal and external covering numbers, the packing number, and the metric entropy are all closely related. The following chain of inequalities holds for any    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   . 1       N   2  ε   met    (  K  )    ≤    N  ε  pack    (  K  )    ≤    N  ε  ext    (  K  )    ≤    N  ε  int    (  K  )    ≤    N  ε  met    (  K  )             subscript   superscript  N  met     2  ε    K      subscript   superscript  N  pack   ε   K           subscript   superscript  N  ext   ε   K           subscript   superscript  N  int   ε   K           subscript   superscript  N  met   ε   K      \displaystyle N^{\text{met}}_{2\varepsilon}(K)\leq N^{\text{pack}}_{%
 \varepsilon}(K)\leq N^{\text{ext}}_{\varepsilon}(K)\leq N^{\text{int}}_{%
 \varepsilon}(K)\leq N^{\text{met}}_{\varepsilon}(K)     In addition, the quantities     N  ε  *    (  K  )        subscript   superscript  N    ε   K    N^{*}_{\varepsilon}(K)   are non-increasing in   ε   ε   \varepsilon   and non-decreasing in   K   K   K   for each of    *  =  pack  ,  ext  ,  met     fragments    pack  normal-,  ext  normal-,  met    *=\text{pack},\text{ext},\text{met}   . However, monotonicity in   K   K   K   can in general fail for    *  =  int     fragments    int    *=\text{int}   .  References  "  Category:Topology     ↩
