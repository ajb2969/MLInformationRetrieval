   Mixing ratio      Mixing ratio   In chemistry and physics , the dimensionless  mixing ratio is the abundance of one component of a mixture relative to that of all other components. The term can refer either to mole ratio or mass ratio. 1  Mole ratio  In atmospheric chemistry , mixing ratio usually refers to the mole ratio     r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}   , which is defined as the amount of a constituent    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   divided by the total amount of all other constituents in a mixture:       r  i   =    n  i     n   t  o  t    -   n  i          subscript  r  i      subscript  n  i      subscript  n    t  o  t     subscript  n  i       r_{i}=\frac{n_{i}}{n_{tot}-n_{i}}     The mole ratio is also called amount ratio . 2  If    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   is much smaller than    n   t  o  t      subscript  n    t  o  t     n_{tot}   (which is the case for atmospheric trace constituents), the mole ratio is almost identical to the mole fraction .  Mass ratio  In meteorology , mixing ratio usually refers to the mass ratio     ζ  i     subscript  ζ  i    \zeta_{i}   , which is defined as the mass of a constituent    m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   divided by the total mass of all other constituents in a mixture:       ζ  i   =    m  i     m   t  o  t    -   m  i          subscript  ζ  i      subscript  m  i      subscript  m    t  o  t     subscript  m  i       \zeta_{i}=\frac{m_{i}}{m_{tot}-m_{i}}     The mass ratio of water vapor in air can be used to describe humidity .
