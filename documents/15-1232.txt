Demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase

Demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase (, S-adenosyl-L-methione-DMK methyltransferase, demethylmenaquinone C-methylase, 2-heptaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase, 2-demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methione:2-demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methione:demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

demethylmenaquinol + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

menaquinol + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine


The enzyme catalyses the last step in menaquinone biosynthesis.
