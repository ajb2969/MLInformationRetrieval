Koenigs function

In mathematics, the Koenigs function is a function arising in complex analysis and dynamical systems. Introduced in 1884 by the French mathematician Gabriel Koenigs, it gives a canonical representation as dilations of a univalent holomorphic mapping, or a semigroup of mappings, of the unit disk in the complex numbers into itself.
Existence and uniqueness of Koenigs function
Let D be the unit disk in the complex numbers. Let 
 
 
 
  be a holomorphic function mapping D into itself, fixing the point 0, with 
 
 
 
  not identically 0 and 
 
 
 
  not an automorphism of D, i.e. a Möbius transformation defined by a matrix in SU(1,1).
By the Denjoy-Wolff theorem, 
 
 
 
 
  leaves invariant each disk |z | $f$ converge uniformly on compacta to 0: in fact for 0 $r$  |f(z)|\le M(r) |z| for |z | ≤ r with M(r ) $f$ '(0) = 
 
 
 
  with 0 $λ$| $h$(0) = 0, 
 
 
 
  '(0) = 1 and Schröder's equation is satisfied,



The function h is the uniform limit on compacta of the normalized iterates, 
 
 
 
 .
Moreover, if 
 
 
 
 
  is univalent, so is 
 
 
 
 .12
As a consequence, when 
 
 
 
  (and hence 
 
 
 
 ) are univalent, 
 
 
 
  can be identified with the open domain 
 
 
 
 
 . Under this conformal identification, the mapping   
 
 
 
  becomes multiplication by 
 
 
 
 , a dilation on 
 
 
 
 .
Proof

Uniqueness. If 
 
 
 
  is another solution then, by analyticity, it suffices to show that k = h near 0. Let








near 0. Thus H(0) =0, H'(0)=1 and, for |z | small,
 
 





Substituting into the power series for 
 
 
 
 , it follows that 
 
 
 
  near 0. Hence 
 
 
 
  near 0.
 


Existence. If 
 
 
 
 
  then by the Schwarz lemma










On the other hand,
 
 





Hence gn converges uniformly for |z| ≤ r by the Weierstrass M-test since
 










Univalence. By Hurwitz's theorem, since each gn is univalent and normalized, i.e. fixes 0 and has derivative 1 there , their limit 
 
 
 
  is also univalent.

Koenigs function of a semigroup
Let  be a semigroup of holomorphic univalent mappings of 
 
 
 
 
  into itself fixing 0 defined for 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  is not an automorphism for 
 
 
 
  > 0








 
  is jointly continuous in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


Each  with 
 
 
 
  > 0 has the same Koenigs function, cf. iterated function. In fact, if h is the Koenigs function of  f1}}, then  satisfies Schroeder's equation and hence is proportion to h.
Taking derivatives gives


 
  Hence 
 
 
 
  is the Koenigs function of .
Structure of univalent semigroups
On the domain 
 
 
 
 , the maps  become multiplication by 
 
 
 
 , a continuous semigroup. So 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is a uniquely determined solution of  λ''}} with Re
 
 
 
   v(z)=\partial_t f_t(z)|_{t=0}, a holomorphic function on 
 
 
 
  with v(0) = 0 and 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
 .
Then


 
  so that


 
  and


 
  the flow equation for a vector field.
Restricting to the case with 0 \Re {zh^\prime(z)\over h(z)} \ge 0 ~.
Since the same result holds for the reciprocal,


 
  so that 
 
 
 
  satisfies the conditions of 



Conversely, reversing the above steps, any holomorphic vector field 
 
 
 
  satisfying these conditions is associated to a semigroup , with
