Partial specific volume




Partial specific volume

The partial specific volume 

 express the variation of the extensive volume of a mixture in respect to composition of the masses. It is the partial derivative of volume with respect to the mass of the component of interest.



where 
 
 
 
  is the partial specific volume of a component 
 
 
 
  defined as:



The PSV is usually measured in milliLiters (mL) per gram (g).
Properties
The sum of partial specific volumes of a mixture or solution is an inverse of density of the mixture namely the specific volume of the mixture.
