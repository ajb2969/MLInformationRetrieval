   Partial specific volume      Partial specific volume   The partial specific volume        v  i   ¯   ,     normal-¯   subscript  v  i     \bar{v_{i}},    express the variation of the extensive volume of a mixture in respect to composition of the masses. It is the partial derivative of volume with respect to the mass of the component of interest.

The PSV is usually measured in milliLiters (mL) per gram (g).  Properties  The sum of partial specific volumes of a mixture or solution is an inverse of density of the mixture namely the specific volume of the mixture.      v  =    ∑  i     w  i   ⋅    v  i   ¯     =   1  ρ         v    subscript   i    normal-⋅   subscript  w  i    normal-¯   subscript  v  i             1  ρ      v=\sum_{i}w_{i}\cdot\bar{v_{i}}=\frac{1}{\rho}           ∑  i     ρ  i   ⋅    v  i   ¯     =  1        subscript   i    normal-⋅   subscript  ρ  i    normal-¯   subscript  v  i      1    \sum_{i}\rho_{i}\cdot\bar{v_{i}}=1     Notes    See also   Partial molar property  Apparent molar property   "  Category:Density
