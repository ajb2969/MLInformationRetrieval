In chemistry , a quaternary compound is a cation consisting of a central positively charged nitrogen group atom with four substituents, especially organic ( alkyl and aryl ) groups, discounting hydrogen atoms. 1  The best known quaternary compounds are quaternary ammonium cations , having a nitrogen atom at the centre. 2 For example, in the following reaction, the nitrogen atom is said to be quaternized as it has gone from 3 to 4 substituents:         R  3   N   +  RCl   ⟶    R  4     N  +     Cl  -       normal-⟶       subscript  normal-R  3   normal-N   RCl      subscript  normal-R  4    superscript  normal-N     superscript  Cl       \mathrm{R_{3}N+RCl\longrightarrow R_{4}N^{+}\ Cl^{-}}     Other examples include substituted phosphonium salts (R 4 P + ), substituted arsonium salts (R 4 As + ) like arsenobetaine , as well as some arsenic containing superconductors . 3 Substituted stibonium (R 4 Sb + ) 4 and bismuthonium salts (R 4 Bi + ) have also been described. 5  See also   Onium compounds   References  "  Category:Quaternary compounds     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
