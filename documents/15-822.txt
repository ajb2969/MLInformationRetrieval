   Chanoclavine-I dehydrogenase      Chanoclavine-I dehydrogenase   Chanoclavine-I dehydrogenase (, easD (gene) , fgaDH (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name chanoclavine-I:NAD + oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction   chanoclavine -I + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   chanoclavine-I aldehyde + NADH + H +    This enzyme catalyses a step in the pathway of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis in certain fungi.
