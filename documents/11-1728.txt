   Extraction ratio      Extraction ratio     Extraction ratio is a measure in renal physiology , primarily used to calculate renal plasma flow in order to evaluate renal function . It is the amount of compound entering the kidney that got excreted into the final urine. 1  Measured in concentration in blood plasma , it may thus be expressed as:       E  x  t  r  a  c  t  i  o  n  r  a  t  i  o   =     P  a   -   P  v     P  a          E  x  t  r  a  c  t  i  o  n  r  a  t  i  o        subscript  P  a    subscript  P  v     subscript  P  a      Extractionratio=\frac{P_{a}-P_{v}}{P_{a}}   , where P a is the concentration in renal artery , and P v is the concentration in the renal vein .  For instance, para aminohippuric acid (PAH) is almost completely excreted in the final urine, and thus almost none is found in the venous return (P v ~0). Therefore, the extraction ration of PAH ~1. This is why PAH is used in PAH clearance to estimate renal plasma flow .  Hepatic Extraction Ratio is a similar measurement for clearance of a substance(usually a pharmacological drug) by the liver. defined as fraction of drug removed from blood by the liver. it depends on 3 factors, the hepatic blood flow, the uptake into the [hepatocytes], and the enzyme metabolic capacity. examples of drugs with a high hepatic extaction ratio include [propranalol] [opiates] and [lignocaine]  References  "  Category:Renal physiology     Renal Mathematics Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center â†©
