Alcohol oxidase




Alcohol oxidase

In enzymology, an alcohol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a primary alcohol + O2

 
  an aldehyde + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are primary alcohol and O2, whereas its two products are aldehyde and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alcohol:oxygen oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called ethanol oxidase. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
