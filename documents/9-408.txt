   FitzHugh–Nagumo model      FitzHugh–Nagumo model   The FitzHugh–Nagumo model ( FHN ), named after Richard FitzHugh (1922 – 2007) who suggested the system in 1961 and J. Nagumo et al . who created the equivalent circuit the following year, describes a prototype of an excitable system (e.g., a neuron ).  The FHN Model is an example of a relaxation oscillator because, if the external stimulus    I  ext     subscript  I  ext    I_{\text{ext}}   exceeds a certain threshold value, the system will exhibit a characteristic excursion in phase space , before the variables   v   v   v   and   w   w   w   relax back to their rest values.  This behaviour is typical for spike generations (a short, nonlinear elevation of membrane voltage   v   v   v   , diminished over time by a slower, linear recovery variable   w   w   w   ) in a neuron after stimulation by an external input current.  The equations for this dynamical system read       v  ˙   =    v  -    v  3   3   -  w   +   I  ext         normal-˙  v       v     superscript  v  3   3   w    subscript  I  ext      \dot{v}=v-\frac{v^{3}}{3}-w+I_{\rm ext}           τ   w  ˙    =    v  +  a   -   b  w     .        τ   normal-˙  w        v  a     b  w      \tau\dot{w}=v+a-bw.     The dynamics of this system can be nicely described by zapping between the left and right branch of the cubic nullcline .  The FitzHugh–Nagumo model is a simplified version of the Hodgkin–Huxley model which models in a detailed manner activation and deactivation dynamics of a spiking neuron. In the original papers of FitzHugh, this model was called Bonhoeffer–van der Pol oscillator (named after Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer and Balthasar van der Pol ) because it contains the van der Pol oscillator as a special case for    a  =  b  =  0        a  b       0     a=b=0   . The equivalent circuit was suggested by Jin-ichi Nagumo, Suguru Arimoto, and Shuji Yoshizawa. 1  See also   Autowave  Biological neuron models  Computational neuroscience  Hodgkin–Huxley model  Reaction-diffusion  Theta model   Further reading   FitzHugh R.
