   D-serine ammonia-lyase      D-serine ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , a D-serine ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-serine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D- in common use include D-hydroxyaminoacid dehydratase , D-serine dehydrase , D-hydroxy amino acid dehydratase , D-serine hydrolase , D-serine dehydratase (deaminating) , D-serine deaminase , and D-serine hydro-lyase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
