( Details , animated GIF version )   In elementary algebra , completing the square is a technique for converting a quadratic polynomial of the form       a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c        a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c    ax^{2}+bx+c\,\!     to the form        a    (   ⋯  ⋯   )   2    +  constant   .        a   superscript    normal-⋯  normal-⋯   2    constant    a(\cdots\cdots)^{2}+\mbox{constant}.\,     In this context, "constant" means not depending on x . The expression inside the parenthesis is of the form ( x + constant). Thus       a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c        a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c    ax^{2}+bx+c\,\!   is converted to       a    (   x  +  h   )   2    +   k         a   superscript    x  h   2    k    a(x+h)^{2}+k\,     for some values of h and k .  Completing the square is used in   solving quadratic equations ,  graphing quadratic functions ,  evaluating integrals in calculus, such as Gaussian integrals with a linear term in the exponent  finding Laplace transforms .   In mathematics, completing the square is considered a basic algebraic operation, and is often applied without remark in any computation involving quadratic polynomials. Completing the square is also used to derive the quadratic formula .  Overview  Background  There is a simple formula in elementary algebra for computing the square of a binomial :          (   x  +  p   )   2    =    x  2   +   2  p  x   +   p  2     .       superscript    x  p   2      superscript  x  2     2  p  x    superscript  p  2      (x+p)^{2}\,=\,x^{2}+2px+p^{2}.\,\!     For example:       (   x  +  3   )   2     superscript    x  3   2    \displaystyle(x+3)^{2}     In any perfect square, the number p is always half the coefficient of x , and the constant term is equal to p 2 .  Basic example  Consider the following quadratic polynomial :       x  2   +   10  x   +  28.       superscript  x  2     10  x   28.    x^{2}+10x+28.\,\!     This quadratic is not a perfect square, since 28 is not the square of 5:         (   x  +  5   )   2    =    x  2   +   10  x   +  25.        superscript    x  5   2      superscript  x  2     10  x   25.     (x+5)^{2}\,=\,x^{2}+10x+25.\,\!     However, it is possible to write the original quadratic as the sum of this square and a constant:        x  2   +   10  x   +   28    =     (   x  +  5   )   2   +  3.          superscript  x  2     10  x   28      superscript    x  5   2   3.     x^{2}+10x+28\,=\,(x+5)^{2}+3.     This is called completing the square .  General description  Given any monic quadratic        x  2   +   b  x   +  c   ,       superscript  x  2     b  x   c    x^{2}+bx+c,\,\!     it is possible to form a square that has the same first two terms:          (   x  +     1  2    b    )   2    =    x  2   +   b  x   +     1  4     b  2      .       superscript    x      1  2   b    2      superscript  x  2     b  x       1  4    superscript  b  2       \left(x+\tfrac{1}{2}b\right)^{2}\,=\,x^{2}+bx+\tfrac{1}{4}b^{2}.     This square differs from the original quadratic only in the value of the constant term. Therefore, we can write         x  2   +   b  x   +   c    =     (   x  +     1  2    b    )   2   +  k    ,         superscript  x  2     b  x   c      superscript    x      1  2   b    2   k     x^{2}+bx+c\,=\,\left(x+\tfrac{1}{2}b\right)^{2}+k,     where k is a constant. This operation is known as completing the square . For example:       x  2   +   6  x   +  11       superscript  x  2     6  x   11    \displaystyle x^{2}+6x+11     Non-monic case  Given a quadratic polynomial of the form       a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c        a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c    ax^{2}+bx+c\,\!   it is possible to factor out the coefficient a , and then complete the square for the resulting monic polynomial .  Example:       3   x  2    +   12  x   +  27        3   superscript  x  2      12  x   27    \displaystyle 3x^{2}+12x+27   This allows us to write any quadratic polynomial in the form        a    (   x  -  h   )   2    +  k   .        a   superscript    x  h   2    k    a(x-h)^{2}+k.\,\!     Formula  The result of completing the square may be written as a formula. For the general case: 1          a   x  2    +   b  x   +   c    =     a    (   x  -  h   )   2    +  k   ,  where      h  =    -   b   2  a     and     k  =   c  -   a   h  2     =   c  -    b  2    4  a        .     formulae-sequence        a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c        a   superscript    x  h   2    k   where     formulae-sequence    h       b    2  a     and        k    c    a   superscript  h  2            c     superscript  b  2     4  a          ax^{2}+bx+c\;=\;a(x-h)^{2}+k,\quad\text{where}\quad h=-\frac{b}{2a}\quad\text{%
 and}\quad k=c-ah^{2}=c-\frac{b^{2}}{4a}.     Specifically, when a =1:          x  2   +   b  x   +   c    =      (   x  -  h   )   2   +  k   ,  where      h  =    -   b  2    and     k  =   c  -    b  2   4       .     formulae-sequence       superscript  x  2     b  x   c       superscript    x  h   2   k   where     formulae-sequence    h       b  2    and      k    c     superscript  b  2   4        x^{2}+bx+c\;=\;(x-h)^{2}+k,\quad\text{where}\quad h=-\frac{b}{2}\quad\text{and%
 }\quad k=c-\frac{b^{2}}{4}.     The matrix case looks very similar:          x  T   A  x   +    x  T   b   +  c   =       (   x  -  h   )   T   A   (   x  -  h   )    +  k   where      h  =    -    1  2    A   -  1    b    and     k  =   c  -    1  4    b  T    A   -  1    b         formulae-sequence         superscript  x  normal-T   A  x      superscript  x  normal-T   b   c         superscript    x  h   normal-T   A    x  h    k   where     formulae-sequence    h         1  2    superscript  A    1    b    and      k    c      1  4    superscript  b  normal-T    superscript  A    1    b        x^{\mathrm{T}}Ax+x^{\mathrm{T}}b+c=(x-h)^{\mathrm{T}}A(x-h)+k\quad\text{where}%
 \quad h=-\frac{1}{2}A^{-1}b\quad\text{and}\quad k=c-\frac{1}{4}b^{\mathrm{T}}A%
 ^{-1}b     where   A   A   A   has to be symmetric.  If   A   A   A   is not symmetric the formulae for   h   h   h   and   k   k   k   have to be generalized to:       h  =    -     (   A  +   A  T    )    -  1    b    and     k  =   c  -    h  T   A  h    =   c  -    b  T     (   A  +   A  T    )    -  1    A    (   A  +   A  T    )    -  1    b        formulae-sequence    h        superscript    A   superscript  A  normal-T      1    b    and        k    c     superscript  h  normal-T   A  h           c     superscript  b  normal-T    superscript    A   superscript  A  normal-T      1    A   superscript    A   superscript  A  normal-T      1    b        h=-(A+A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b\quad\text{and}\quad k=c-h^{\mathrm{T}}Ah=c-b^{%
 \mathrm{T}}(A+A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1}A(A+A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1}b   .  Relation to the graph  In analytic geometry , the graph of any quadratic function is a parabola in the xy -plane. Given a quadratic polynomial of the form         (   x  -  h   )   2   +  k   or    a    (   x  -  h   )   2    +  k         superscript    x  h   2   k   or      a   superscript    x  h   2    k     (x-h)^{2}+k\quad\text{or}\quad a(x-h)^{2}+k     the numbers h and k may be interpreted as the Cartesian coordinates of the vertex of the parabola. That is, h is the x -coordinate of the axis of symmetry, and k is the minimum value (or maximum value, if a 2 is a parabola whose vertex is at the origin (0, 0). Therefore, the graph of the function ƒ ( x − h ) = ( x − h ) 2 is a parabola shifted to the right by h whose vertex is at ( h , 0), as shown in the top figure. In contrast, the graph of the function ƒ ( x ) + k = x 2 + k is a parabola shifted upward by k whose vertex is at (0, k ), as shown in the center figure. Combining both horizontal and vertical shifts yields ƒ ( x − h ) + k = ( x − h ) 2 + k is a parabola shifted to the right by h and upward by k whose vertex is at ( h , k ), as shown in the bottom figure.  Solving quadratic equations  Completing the square may be used to solve any quadratic equation . For example:         x  2   +   6  x   +  5   =  0   ,         superscript  x  2     6  x   5   0    x^{2}+6x+5=0,\,\!     The first step is to complete the square:         (   x  +  3   )   2   -  4   =  0.         superscript    x  3   2   4   0.    (x+3)^{2}-4=0.\,\!     Next we solve for the squared term:        (   x  +  3   )   2   =  4.       superscript    x  3   2   4.    (x+3)^{2}=4.\,\!     Then either         x  +  3   =    -  2   or      x  +  3   =  2    ,     formulae-sequence      x  3      2   or        x  3   2     x+3=-2\quad\text{or}\quad x+3=2,     and therefore       x  =    -  5   or     x  =   -  1.       formulae-sequence    x     5   or      x    1.      x=-5\quad\text{or}\quad x=-1.     This can be applied to any quadratic equation. When the x 2 has a coefficient other than 1, the first step is to divide out the equation by this coefficient: for an example see the non-monic case below.  Irrational and complex roots  Unlike methods involving factoring the equation, which is reliable only if the roots are rational , completing the square will find the roots of a quadratic equation even when those roots are irrational or complex . For example, consider the equation         x  2   -   10  x    +  18   =  0.           superscript  x  2     10  x    18   0.    x^{2}-10x+18=0.\,\!     Completing the square gives          (   x  -  5   )   2   -  7   =  0   ,         superscript    x  5   2   7   0    (x-5)^{2}-7=0,\,\!     so        (   x  -  5   )   2   =  7.       superscript    x  5   2   7.    (x-5)^{2}=7.\,\!     Then either         x  -  5   =    -   7    or      x  -  5   =   7     ,     formulae-sequence      x  5        7    or        x  5     7      x-5=-\sqrt{7}\quad\text{or}\quad x-5=\sqrt{7},\,     so        x  =    5  -   7    or     x  =   5  +   7      .     formulae-sequence    x     5    7    or      x    5    7       x=5-\sqrt{7}\quad\text{or}\quad x=5+\sqrt{7}.\,     In terser language:       x  =   5  ±   7     .      x   plus-or-minus  5    7      x=5\pm\sqrt{7}.\,     Equations with complex roots can be handled in the same way. For example:           x  2   +   4  x   +   5    =  0           (   x  +  2   )   2   +   1    =  0           (   x  +  2   )   2    =   -  1          x  +   2    =   ±  i           x   =    -  2   ±  i    .              superscript  x  2     4  x   5   0          superscript    x  2   2   1   0        superscript    x  2   2     1          x  2    plus-or-minus  i        x   plus-or-minus    2   i       \begin{array}[]{c}x^{2}+4x+5\,=\,0\\
 (x+2)^{2}+1\,=\,0\\
 (x+2)^{2}\,=\,-1\\
 x+2\,=\,\pm i\\
 x\,=\,-2\pm i.\end{array}     Non-monic case  For an equation involving a non-monic quadratic, the first step to solving them is to divide through by the coefficient of x 2 . For example:           2   x  2    +   7  x   +   6    =  0          x  2   +     7  2    x   +   3    =  0           (   x  +    7  4     )   2   -     1  16      =  0           (   x  +    7  4     )   2    =    1  16            x  +    7  4     =     1  4    or      x  +    7  4     =   -    1  4             x  =    -    3  2     or     x  =   -  2.                 2   superscript  x  2      7  x   6   0          superscript  x  2       7  2   x   3   0          superscript    x    7  4    2     1  16    0        superscript    x    7  4    2     1  16       formulae-sequence      x    7  4       1  4   or        x    7  4        1  4         formulae-sequence    x       3  2    or      x    2.        \begin{array}[]{c}2x^{2}+7x+6\,=\,0\\
 x^{2}+\tfrac{7}{2}x+3\,=\,0\\
 \left(x+\tfrac{7}{4}\right)^{2}-\tfrac{1}{16}\,=\,0\\
 \left(x+\tfrac{7}{4}\right)^{2}\,=\,\tfrac{1}{16}\\
 x+\tfrac{7}{4}=\tfrac{1}{4}\quad\text{or}\quad x+\tfrac{7}{4}=-\tfrac{1}{4}\\
 x=-\tfrac{3}{2}\quad\text{or}\quad x=-2.\end{array}     Other applications  Integration  Completing the square may be used to evaluate any integral of the form      ∫    d  x     a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c            d  x       a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c      \int\frac{dx}{ax^{2}+bx+c}     using the basic integrals         ∫    d  x     x  2   -   a  2      =      1   2  a     ln   |    x  -  a    x  +  a    |     +  C   and      ∫    d  x     x  2   +   a  2      =     1  a    arctan   (   x  a   )     +  C     .     formulae-sequence          d  x      superscript  x  2    superscript  a  2             1    2  a            x  a     x  a       C   and            d  x      superscript  x  2    superscript  a  2            1  a       x  a     C      \int\frac{dx}{x^{2}-a^{2}}=\frac{1}{2a}\ln\left|\frac{x-a}{x+a}\right|+C\quad%
 \text{and}\quad\int\frac{dx}{x^{2}+a^{2}}=\frac{1}{a}\arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}%
 \right)+C.     For example, consider the integral       ∫    d  x     x  2   +   6  x   +  13     .          d  x      superscript  x  2     6  x   13      \int\frac{dx}{x^{2}+6x+13}.     Completing the square in the denominator gives:        ∫     d  x      (   x  +  3   )   2   +  4      =   ∫    d  x      (   x  +  3   )   2   +   2  2       .            d  x      superscript    x  3   2   4           d  x      superscript    x  3   2    superscript  2  2        \int\frac{dx}{(x+3)^{2}+4}\,=\,\int\frac{dx}{(x+3)^{2}+2^{2}}.     This can now be evaluated by using the substitution  u = x + 3, which yields        ∫     d  x      (   x  +  3   )   2   +  4      =     1  2    arctan   (    x  +  3   2   )     +  C    .            d  x      superscript    x  3   2   4           1  2         x  3   2     C     \int\frac{dx}{(x+3)^{2}+4}\,=\,\frac{1}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{x+3}{2}\right)+C.     Complex numbers  Consider the expression          |  z  |   2   -    b  *   z   -   b   z  *     +  c   ,         superscript    z   2      superscript  b    z     b   superscript  z      c    |z|^{2}-b^{*}z-bz^{*}+c,\,     where z and b are complex numbers , z * and b * are the complex conjugates of z and b , respectively, and c is a real number . Using the identity | u | 2 = uu * we can rewrite this as          |   z  -  b   |   2   -    |  b  |   2    +  c   ,         superscript      z  b    2    superscript    b   2    c    |z-b|^{2}-|b|^{2}+c,\,\!     which is clearly a real quantity. This is because       |   z  -  b   |   2     superscript      z  b    2    \displaystyle|z-b|^{2}     As another example, the expression        a   x  2    +   b   y  2    +  c   ,        a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2    c    ax^{2}+by^{2}+c,\,\!     where a , b , c , x , and y are real numbers, with a > 0 and b > 0, may be expressed in terms of the square of the absolute value of a complex number. Define       z  =      a    x   +   i    b    y     .      z        a   x     i    b   y      z=\sqrt{a}\,x+i\sqrt{b}\,y.     Then       |  z  |   2     superscript    z   2    \displaystyle|z|^{2}     so         a   x  2    +   b   y  2    +  c   =     |  z  |   2   +  c    .          a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2    c      superscript    z   2   c     ax^{2}+by^{2}+c=|z|^{2}+c.\,\!     Idempotent matrix  A matrix  M is idempotent when M  2 = M . Idempotent matrices generalize the idempotent properties of 0 and 1. The completion of the square method of addressing the equation         a  2   +   b  2    =  a   ,         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    a    a^{2}+b^{2}=a,   shows that some idempotent 2 × 2 matrices are parametrized by a circle in the ( a,b )-plane:  The matrix    (     a    b      b     1  -  a      )      a  b    b    1  a      \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 b&1-a\end{pmatrix}   will be idempotent provided       a  2   +   b  2    =  a   ,         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    a    a^{2}+b^{2}=a,   which, upon completing the square, becomes          (   a  -    1  2     )   2   +   b  2    =    1  4     .         superscript    a    1  2    2    superscript  b  2      1  4     (a-\tfrac{1}{2})^{2}+b^{2}=\tfrac{1}{4}.   In the ( a,b )-plane, this is the equation of a circle with center (1/2, 0) and radius 1/2.  Geometric perspective  (Figure)  Completing the square.svg   Consider completing the square for the equation         x  2   +   b  x    =  a   .         superscript  x  2     b  x    a    x^{2}+bx=a.\,     Since x 2 represents the area of a square with side of length x , and bx represents the area of a rectangle with sides b and x , the process of completing the square can be viewed as visual manipulation of rectangles.  Simple attempts to combine the x 2 and the bx rectangles into a larger square result in a missing corner. The term ( b /2) 2 added to each side of the above equation is precisely the area of the missing corner, whence derives the terminology "completing the square". 1  A variation on the technique  As conventionally taught, completing the square consists of adding the third term, v 2 to       u  2   +   2  u   v         superscript  u  2     2  u  v     u^{2}+2uv\,     to get a square. There are also cases in which one can add the middle term, either 2 uv or −2 uv , to       u  2   +    v  2         superscript  u  2    superscript  v  2     u^{2}+v^{2}\,     to get a square.  Example: the sum of a positive number and its reciprocal  By writing      x  +    1  x        x    1  x     \displaystyle x+{1\over x}     we show that the sum of a positive number x and its reciprocal is always greater than or equal to 2. The square of a real expression is always greater than or equal to zero, which gives the stated bound; and here we achieve 2 just when x is 1, causing the square to vanish.  Example: factoring a simple quartic polynomial  Consider the problem of factoring the polynomial       x  4   +  324.       superscript  x  4   324.    x^{4}+324.\,\!     This is         (   x  2   )   2   +    (  18  )   2    ,       superscript   superscript  x  2   2    superscript  18  2     (x^{2})^{2}+(18)^{2},\,\!     so the middle term is 2( x 2 )(18) = 36 x 2 . Thus we get       x  4   +  324       superscript  x  4   324    \displaystyle x^{4}+324     (the last line being added merely to follow the convention of decreasing degrees of terms).
