Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction

The Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction is a continued fraction discovered by  and independently by Srinivasa Ramanujan, and closely related to the Rogers–Ramanujan identities. It can be evaluated explicitly for a broad class of values of its argument.

Given the functions G(q) and H(q) appearing in the Rogers–Ramanujan identities,



and,


 
 
   and , respectively, where 
 
 
 
  denotes the infinite q-Pochhammer symbol, j is the j-function, and 2F1 is the hypergeometric function, then the Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction is,



Modular functions
If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , as well as their quotient 
 
 
 
 , are modular functions of 
 
 
 
 . Since they have integral coefficients, the theory of complex multiplication implies that their values for 
 
 
 
  an imaginary quadratic irrational are algebraic numbers that can be evaluated explicitly.
Examples

  is the golden ratio.
Relation to modular forms
It can be related to the Dedekind eta function, a modular form of weight 1/2, as,1






Relation to j-function
Among the many formulas of the j-function, one is,



where,



Eliminating the eta quotient, one can then express j(τ) in terms of 
 
 
 
  as,






where the numerator and denominator are polynomial invariants of the icosahedron. Using the modular equation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , one finds that,

 ,then
 
 

where,



which in fact is the j-invariant of the elliptic curve,



parameterized by the non-cusp points of the modular curve

 
 .
Functional equation
For convenience, one can also use the notation 
 
 
 
  when q = e2πiτ. While other modular functions like the j-invariant satisfies,



and the Dedekind eta function has,



the functional equation of the Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction involves2 the golden ratio

Modular equations
There are modular equations between

Other results
Ramanujan found many other interesting results regarding R(q).4 Let

The powers of R(q) also can be expressed in unusual ways. For its cube,
