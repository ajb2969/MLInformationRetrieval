   Winsorized mean      Winsorized mean   A Winsorized mean is a Winsorized  statistical  measure of central tendency , much like the mean and median , and even more similar to the truncated mean . It involves the calculation of the mean after replacing given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end with the most extreme remaining values, 1 typically doing so for an equal amount of both extremes; often 10 to 25 percent of the ends are replaced.  Advantages  The Winsorized mean is a useful estimator because it is less sensitive to outliers than the mean but will still give a reasonable estimate of central tendency or mean for almost all statistical models. In this regard it is referred to as a robust estimator .  Drawbacks  The Winsorized mean uses more information from the distribution or sample than the median . However, unless the underlying distribution is symmetric , the Winsorized mean of a sample is unlikely to produce an unbiased estimator for either the mean or the median.  Example   For a sample of 10 numbers (from x 1 , the smallest, to x 10 the largest) the 10% Winsorized mean is              x  2   +   x  2    ⏞   +   x  3   +   x  4   +   x  5   +   x  6   +   x  7   +   x  8   +     x  9   +   x  9    ⏞    10   .         normal-⏞     subscript  x  2    subscript  x  2      subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4    subscript  x  5    subscript  x  6    subscript  x  7    subscript  x  8    normal-⏞     subscript  x  9    subscript  x  9      10    \frac{\overbrace{x_{2}+x_{2}}+x_{3}+x_{4}+x_{5}+x_{6}+x_{7}+x_{8}+\overbrace{x%
 _{9}+x_{9}}}{10}.\,         The key is in the repetition of x 2 and x 9 : the extras substitute for the original values x 1 and x 10 which have been discarded and replaced.
