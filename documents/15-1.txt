   Landauer formula      Landauer formula   The Landauer formula —named after Rolf Landauer , who first suggested its prototype in 1957 1 —is a formula relating the electrical resistance of a quantum conductor to the scattering properties of the conductor. 2 In the simplest case where the system only has two terminals, and the scattering matrix of the conductor does not depend on energy, the formula reads        G   (  μ  )    =    G  0     ∑  n     T  n    (  μ  )       ,        G  μ      subscript  G  0     subscript   n      subscript  T  n   μ       G(\mu)=G_{0}\sum_{n}T_{n}(\mu)\ ,   where   G   G   G   is the electrical conductance,     G  0   =    e  2   /   (   π  ℏ   )    ≈    7.75  ×   10   -  5      Ω   -  1            subscript  G  0      superscript  e  2     π  Planck-constant-over-2-pi             7.75   superscript  10    5      superscript  normal-Ω    1        G_{0}=e^{2}/(\pi\hbar)\approx 7.75\times 10^{-5}\Omega^{-1}   is the conductance quantum ,    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   are the transmission eigenvalues of the channels, and the sum runs over all transport channels in the conductor. This formula is very simple and physically sensible: The conductance of a nanoscale conductor is given by the sum of all the transmission possibilities an electron has when propagating with an energy equal to the chemical potential,    E  =  μ      E  μ    E=\mu   .
