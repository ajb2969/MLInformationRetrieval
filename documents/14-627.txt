   Tilting theory      Tilting theory   In mathematics , specifically representation theory , tilting theory describes a way to relate the module categories of two algebras using so-called tilting modules and associated tilting functors . Here, the second algebra is the endomorphism algebra of a tilting module over the first algebra.  Tilting theory was motivated by the introduction of reflection functors by ; these functors were used to relate representations of two quivers . These functors were reformulated by , and generalized by  who introduced tilting functors.  defined tilted algebras and tilting modules as further generalizations of this.  Definitions  Suppose that A is a finite-dimensional unital  associative algebra over some field . A finitely-generated right A -module T is called a tilting module if it has the following three properties:   T has projective dimension at most 1, in other words it is a quotient of a projective module by a projective submodule.  Ext ( T , T ) = 0.  The right A -module A is the kernel of a surjective morphism between finite direct sums of direct summands of T .   Given such a tilting module, we define the endomorphism algebra  B = End A ( T ). This is another finite-dimensional algebra, and T is a finitely-generated left B -module. The tilting functors Hom A ( T ,−), Ext( T ,−), −⊗ B T and Tor (−, T ) relate the category mod- A of finitely-generated right A -modules to the category mod- B of finitely-generated right B -modules.  In practice one often considers hereditary finite dimensional algebras A because the module categories over such algebras are fairly well understood. The endomorphism algebra of a tilting module over a hereditary finite dimensional algebra is called a tilted algebra .  Facts  Suppose A is a finite-dimensional algebra, T is a tilting module over A , and B = End A ( T ). Write F =Hom A ( T ,−), F′ =Ext( T ,−), G =−⊗ B T , and G′ =Tor(−, T ). F is right adjoint to G and F′ is right adjoint to G′ .  showed that tilting functors give equivalences between certain subcategories of mod- A and mod- B . Specifically, if we define the two subcategories    ℱ  =   ker   (  F  )        ℱ   kernel  F     \mathcal{F}=\ker(F)   and    𝒯  =   ker   (   F  ′   )        𝒯   kernel   superscript  F  normal-′      \mathcal{T}=\ker(F^{\prime})   of A -mod, and the two subcategories    𝒳  =   ker   (  G  )        𝒳   kernel  G     \mathcal{X}=\ker(G)   and    𝒴  =   ker   (   G  ′   )        𝒴   kernel   superscript  G  normal-′      \mathcal{Y}=\ker(G^{\prime})   of B -mod, then    (  𝒯  ,  ℱ  )     𝒯  ℱ    (\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})   is a torsion pair in A -mod (i.e.   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   and   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   are maximal subcategories with the property     Hom   (  𝒯  ,  ℱ  )    =  0       Hom  𝒯  ℱ   0    \operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})=0   ; this implies that every M in A -mod admits a natural short exact sequence    0  →  U  →  M  →  V  →  0       normal-→  0  U    normal-→    M    normal-→    V    normal-→    0     0\to U\to M\to V\to 0   with U in   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   and V in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   ) and    (  𝒳  ,  𝒴  )     𝒳  𝒴    (\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})   is a torsion pair in B -mod. Further, the restrictions of the functors F and G yield inverse equivalences between   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   and   𝒴   𝒴   \mathcal{Y}   , while the restrictions of F′ and G′ yield inverse equivalences between   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   and   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   . (Note that these equivalences switch the order of the torsion pairs    (  𝒯  ,  ℱ  )     𝒯  ℱ    (\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})   and    (  𝒳  ,  𝒴  )     𝒳  𝒴    (\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})   .)  Tilting theory may be seen as a generalization of Morita equivalence which is recovered if T is a projective generator ; in that case    𝒯  =   mod  -  A       𝒯    mod  A     \mathcal{T}=\operatorname{mod}-A   and    𝒴  =   mod  -  B       𝒴    mod  B     \mathcal{Y}=\operatorname{mod}-B   .  If A has finite global dimension , then B also has finite global dimension, and the difference of F and F ' induces an isometry between the Grothendieck groups K 0 ( A ) and K 0 ( B ).  In case A is hereditary (i.e. B is a tilted algebra), the global dimension of B is at most 2, and the torsion pair    (  𝒳  ,  𝒴  )     𝒳  𝒴    (\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})   splits, i.e. every indecomposable object of B -mod is either in   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   or in   𝒴   𝒴   \mathcal{Y}   .  and  showed that in general A and B are derived equivalent (i.e. the derived categories D b ( A -mod) and D b ( B -mod) are equivalent as triangulated categories ).  Generalizations and extensions  A generalized tilting module over the finite-dimensional algebra A is a right A -module T with the following three properties:   T has finite projective dimension.  Ext ( T , T ) = 0 for all i >0.  There is an exact sequence    0  →  A  →   T  1   →  …  →   T  n   →  0       normal-→  0  A    normal-→     subscript  T  1     normal-→    normal-…    normal-→     subscript  T  n     normal-→    0     0\to A\to T_{1}\to\dots\to T_{n}\to 0   where the T i are finite direct sums of direct summands of T .   These generalized tilting modules also yield derived equivalences between A and B , where B =End A ( T ).  extended the results on derived equivalence by proving that two finite-dimensional algebras R and S are derived equivalent if and only if S is the endomorphism algebra of a "tilting complex" over R . Tilting complexes are generalizations of generalized tilting modules. A version of this theorem is valid for arbitrary rings R and S .  defined tilting objects in hereditary abelian categories in which all Hom- and Ext-spaces are finite-dimensional over some algebraically closed field  k . The endomorphism algebras of these tilting objects are the quasi-tilted algebras , a generalization of tilted algebras. The quasi-tilted algebras over k are precisely the finite-dimensional algebras over k of global dimension ≤ 2 such that every indecomposable module either has projective dimension ≤ 1 or injective dimension ≤ 1.  classified the hereditary abelian categories that can appear in the above construction.  defined tilting objects T in an arbitrary abelian category  C ; their definition requires that C contain the direct sums of arbitrary (possibly infinite) numbers of copies of T , so this is not a direct generalization of the finite-dimensional situation considered above. Given such a tilting object with endomorphism ring R , they establish tilting functors that provide equivalences between a torsion pair in C and a torsion pair in R -Mod, the category of all  R -modules.  From the theory of cluster algebras came the definition of cluster category and cluster tilted algebra associated to a hereditary algebra A . A cluster tilted algebra arises from a tilted algebra as a certain semidirect product , and the cluster category of A summarizes all the module categories of cluster tilted algebras arising from A .
