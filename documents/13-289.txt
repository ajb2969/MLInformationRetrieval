Arithmetical ring

In algebra, a commutative ring R is said to be arithmetical (or arithmetic) if any of the following equivalent conditions holds:

The localization

 
  of R at 
 
 
 
  is a uniserial ring for every maximal ideal

 
  of R.
For all ideals

 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 


For all ideals 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 



The last two conditions both say that the lattice of all ideals of R is distributive.
An arithmetical domain is the same thing as a Pr√ºfer domain.
