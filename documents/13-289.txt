   Arithmetical ring      Arithmetical ring   In algebra, a commutative ring  R is said to be arithmetical (or arithmetic ) if any of the following equivalent conditions holds:   The localization     R  𝔪     subscript  R  𝔪    R_{\mathfrak{m}}   of R at   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   is a uniserial ring for every maximal ideal    𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   of R .  For all ideals     𝔞  ,  𝔟     𝔞  𝔟    \mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b}   , and   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   ,      𝔞  ∩   (   𝔟  +  𝔠   )    =    (   𝔞  ∩  𝔟   )   +   (   𝔞  ∩  𝔠   )          𝔞    𝔟  𝔠        𝔞  𝔟     𝔞  𝔠      \mathfrak{a}\cap(\mathfrak{b}+\mathfrak{c})=(\mathfrak{a}\cap\mathfrak{b})+(%
 \mathfrak{a}\cap\mathfrak{c})     For all ideals    𝔞  ,  𝔟     𝔞  𝔟    \mathfrak{a},\mathfrak{b}   , and   𝔠   𝔠   \mathfrak{c}   ,      𝔞  +   (   𝔟  ∩  𝔠   )    =    (   𝔞  +  𝔟   )   ∩   (   𝔞  +  𝔠   )          𝔞    𝔟  𝔠        𝔞  𝔟     𝔞  𝔠      \mathfrak{a}+(\mathfrak{b}\cap\mathfrak{c})=(\mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{b})\cap(%
 \mathfrak{a}+\mathfrak{c})      The last two conditions both say that the lattice of all ideals of R is distributive .  An arithmetical domain is the same thing as a Prüfer domain .  References       External links  "  Category:Ring theory
