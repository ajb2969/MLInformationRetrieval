Suspension (dynamical systems)

Suspension is a construction passing from a map to a flow. Namely, let 
 
 
 
  be a metric space, 
 
 
 
  be a continuous map and 
 
 
 
  be a function (roof function or ceiling function) bounded away from 0. Consider the quotient space



The suspension of 
 
 
 
  with roof function 
 
 
 
  is the semiflow1

 
  induced by the time-translation 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , then the quotient space is also called the mapping torus of 
 
 
 
 .
