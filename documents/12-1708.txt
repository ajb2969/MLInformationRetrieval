   Nullity theorem      Nullity theorem   The nullity theorem is a mathematical theorem about the inverse of a partitioned matrix , which states that the nullity of a block in a matrix equals the nullity of the complementary block in its inverse matrix. Here, the nullity is the dimension of the kernel . The theorem was proven in an abstract setting by , and for matrices by .  Partition a matrix and its inverse in four submatrices:         [     A    B      C    D     ]    -  1    =   [     E    F      G    H     ]    .       superscript    A  B    C  D      1      E  F    G  H      \begin{bmatrix}A&B\\
 C&D\end{bmatrix}^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}E&F\\
 G&H\end{bmatrix}.   The partition on the right-hand side should be the transpose of the partition on the left-hand side, in the sense that if A is an m -by- n block then E should be an n -by- m block.  The statement of the nullity theorem is now that the nullities of the blocks on the right equal the nullities of the blocks on the left :      nullity  A     nullity  A    \displaystyle\operatorname{nullity}\,A     More generally, if a submatrix is formed from the rows with indices { i 1 , i 2 , …, i m } and the columns with indices { j 1 , j 2 , …, j n }, then the complementary submatrix is formed from the rows with indices {1, 2, …, N } \ { j 1 , j 2 , …, j n } and the columns with indices {1, 2, …, N } \ { i 1 , i 2 , …, i m }, where N is the size of the whole matrix. The nullity theorem states that the nullity of any submatrix equals the nullity of the complementary submatrix of the inverse.  References    .   .   .   "  Category:Matrix theory
