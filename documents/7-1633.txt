Coefficient matrix

In linear algebra, the coefficient matrix refers to a matrix consisting of the coefficients of the variables in a set of linear equations.
Example
In general, a system with m linear equations and n unknowns can be written as












where 
 
 
 
  are the unknowns and the numbers 
 
 
 
  are the coefficients of the system. The coefficient matrix is the mxn matrix with the coefficient 
 
 
 
  as the (i,j)-th entry:
