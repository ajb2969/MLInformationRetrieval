Landsberg–Schaar relation

In number theory and harmonic analysis, the Landsberg–Schaar relation (or identity) is the following equation, which is valid for arbitrary positive integers p and q:



Although both sides are mere finite sums, no proof by entirely finite methods has yet been found. The standard way to prove it1 is to put 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  in this identity due to Jacobi (which is essentially just a special case of the Poisson summation formula in classical harmonic analysis):



and then let 
 
 

If we let q = 1, the identity reduces to a formula for the quadratic Gauss sum modulo p.
The Landsberg–Schaar identity can be rephrased more symmetrically as



provided that we add the hypothesis that pq is an even number.
