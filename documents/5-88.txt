Asymmetric relation




Asymmetric relation

In mathematics an asymmetric relation is a binary relation on a set X where:

For all a and b in X, if a is related to b, then b is not related to a.1

In mathematical notation, this is:

Examples
An example is .

Restrictions and inverses of asymmetric relations are also asymmetric. For example, the restriction of  of < is also asymmetric.
A transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive:2 if a R b and b R a, transitivity gives a R a, contradicting irreflexivity.
