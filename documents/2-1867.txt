Heptathlon

A heptathlon is a track and field combined events contest made up of seven events.1 The name derives from the Greek hepta (seven) and athlon (contest).2 A competitor in a heptathlon is referred to as a heptathlete.
There are two heptathlons – the women's heptathlon and the men's – composed of different events. The men's heptathlon is older and is held indoors, while the women's is held outdoors and was introduced in the 1980s, first appearing in the Olympics in 1984.
Women's heptathlon

The IAAF World Combined Events Challenge determines a yearly women's heptathlon champion. The women's outdoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and the remaining three on day two:

100 metres hurdles
High jump
Shot put
200 metres
Long jump
Javelin throw
800 metres

The heptathlon has been contested by female athletes since the early 1980s, when it replaced the pentathlon as the primary women's combined event contest (the javelin throw and 800 m were added). It was first contested at the Olympic level in the 1984 Summer Olympics. In recent years some women's decathlon competitions have been conducted, consisting of the same events as the men's competition in a slightly different order, and the IAAF has begun keeping records for it, but the heptathlon remains the championship-level combined event for women. Ganna Melnichenko is the current World Champion, winning in Moscow in 2013. Jessica Ennis representing Great Britain, is the 2012 Olympic Gold Medallist.
There is also a Tetradecathlon, which is a double heptathlon, consisting of 14 events, seven events per day.
Point system
The heptathlon scoring system was devised by Dr Karl Ulbrich, a Viennese mathematician. The formulae are constructed so that, for each event, a designated "standard" performance (for example, approximately 1.82 m for the high jump) scores 1000 points.3 Each event also has a minimum recordable performance level (e.g. 0.75 m for the high jump), corresponding to zero points. The formulae are devised so that successive constant increments in performance correspond to gradually increasing increments in points awarded.

The events are split into three groups, and the scores are calculated according to the three formulae:4

Running events (200 m, 800 m and 100 m hurdles):
 
 
 



Jumping events (high jump and long jump):
 
 
 



Throwing events (shot put and javelin):
 
 
 




P is for points, T is for time in seconds, M is for height or length in centimeters and D is length in meters. a, b and c have different values for each of the events (see table).

Men's heptathlon
 The other version is an indoor competition, normally contested by men only. It is the men's combined event in the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics. The men's indoor heptathlon consists of the following events, with the first four contested on the first day, and remaining three on day two:

60 metres
long jump
shot put
high jump
60 metres hurdles
pole vault
1000 metres

The scoring is similar for both versions. In each event, the athlete scores points for his/her performance in each event according to scoring tables issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).5 The athlete accumulating the highest number of points wins the competition.
