   Algorithmic complexity attack      Algorithmic complexity attack   An algorithmic complexity attack is a form of computer attack that exploits known cases in which an algorithm used in a piece of software will exhibit worst case behavior. This type of attack can be used to achieve a denial-of-service .  Examples   Billion laughs  ReDoS  Zip bomb   See also   Adversarial input  Quicksort - popular and fast in-place sorting algorithm, running    O   (   n   log  n    )       O    n    n      O(n\log n)   on average, but having    O   (   n  2   )       O   superscript  n  2     O(n^{2})   behaviour if implemented na√Øvely.
