Diaminobutyrate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a diaminobutyrate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-2,4-diaminobutanoate 
 
 
 
  propane-1,3-diamine + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-2,4-diaminobutanoate, and two products, propane-1,3-diamine and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2,4-diaminobutanoate carboxy-lyase (propane-1,3-diamine-forming). Other names in common use include DABA DC, L-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase, and L-2,4-diaminobutanoate carboxy-lyase.
