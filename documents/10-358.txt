   Epstein frame      Epstein frame   (Figure)  Epstein frame   An Epstein frame or Epstein square is a standardised measurement device for measuring the magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials, especially used for testing of electrical steels .  The International Standard for the measurement configuration and conditions are defined by the standard IEC 60404-2:2008 Magnetic materials - Part 2: Methods of measurement of the magnetic properties of electrical steel sheet and strip by means of an Epstein frame 1 published by International Electrotechnical Commission .  An Epstein frame comprises a primary and a secondary winding . The sample under test should be prepared as a set of a number of strips (always a multiple of four) cut from electrical steel sheet or ribbon. Each layer of the sample is double-lapped in corners and weighted down with a force of 1 N (see photo).  The power losses are measured by means of a wattmeter method in which the primary current and secondary voltage are used. During the measurement, the Epstein frame behaves as an unloaded transformer .  Power loss, P c , is calculated as:       P  c   =      N  1    N  2    ⋅   P  m    -     (  1  ,   111  ⋅   |    U  2   ¯   |    )   2    R  i          subscript  P  c      normal-⋅     subscript  N  1    subscript  N  2     subscript  P  m       superscript   1   normal-⋅  111     normal-¯   subscript  U  2       2    subscript  R  i       P_{c}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}\cdot P_{m}-\frac{\left(1,111\cdot|\bar{U_{2}}|\right%
 )^{2}}{R_{i}}     where:      N  1      subscript  N  1    N_{1}~{}   is the number of turns of primary winding      N  2      subscript  N  2    N_{2}~{}   is the number of turns of secondary winding      P  m      subscript  P  m    P_{m}~{}   is the reading of the wattmeter in watts      R  i      subscript  R  i    R_{i}~{}   is the total resistance of the instruments in the secondary circuit in ohms and     |    U  2   ¯   |       normal-¯   subscript  U  2      |\bar{U_{2}}|   is the average secondary voltage in volts .  Specific power loss, P s , is calculated as:       P  s   =     P  c   ⋅  4  ⋅  l    m  ⋅   l  m          subscript  P  s      normal-⋅   subscript  P  c   4  l    normal-⋅  m   subscript  l  m       P_{s}=\frac{P_{c}\cdot 4\cdot l}{m\cdot l_{m}}     where:     l    l   l~{}   is the length of the sample in metres      l  m      subscript  l  m    l_{m}~{}   is the average magnetic path length = 0.94 (constant value)     m    m   m~{}   is the mass of the sample in kilograms  If all conditions are as defined in the standard, the standard deviation of the reproducibility of the values is not greater than 1.5% up to 1.5 T for non-oriented electrical steel and up to 1.7 T for grain-oriented electrical steel .
