   Maximal arc      Maximal arc   A Maximal arc in a finite projective plane is a largest possible ( k , d )- arc in that projective plane. If the finite projective plane has order q (there are q +1 points on any line), then for a maximal arc, k , the number of points of the arc, is the maximum possible (= qd + d - q ) with the property that no d +1 points of the arc lie on the same line.  Definition  Let   π   π   \pi   be a finite projective plane of order q (not necessarily desarguesian ). Maximal arcs of degree  d ( 2 ≤ d ≤ q - 1) are ( k , d )- arcs in   π   π   \pi   , where k is maximal with respect to the parameter d , in other words, k = qd + d - q .  Equivalently, one can define maximal arcs of degree d in   π   π   \pi   as non-empty sets of points K such that every line intersects the set either in 0 or d points.  Some authors permit the degree of a maximal arc to be 1, q or even q + 1. 1 Letting K be a maximal ( k , d )-arc in a projective plane of order q , if   d = 1, K is a point of the plane,  d = q , K is the complement of a line (an affine plane of order q ), and  d = q + 1, K is the entire projective plane.   All of these cases are considered to be trivial examples of maximal arcs, existing in any type of projective plane for any value of q . When 2 ≤ d ≤ q - 1, the maximal arc is called non-trivial , and the definition given above and the properties listed below all refer to non-trivial maximal arcs.  Properties   The number of lines through a fixed point p , not on a maximal arc K , intersecting K in d points, equals     (   q  +  1   )   -   q  d         q  1     q  d     (q+1)-\frac{q}{d}   . Thus, d divides q .  In the special case of d = 2, maximal arcs are known as hyperovals which can only exist if q is even.  An arc K having one fewer point than a maximal arc can always be uniquely extended to a maximal arc by adding to K the point at which all the lines meeting K in d - 1 points meet. 2  In PG(2, q ) with q odd, no non-trivial maximal arcs exist. 3  In PG(2,2 h ), maximal arcs for every degree 2 t , 1 ≤ t ≤ h exist. 4   Partial geometries  One can construct partial geometries , derived from maximal arcs: 5   Let K be a maximal arc with degree d . Consider the incidence structure     S   (  K  )    =   (  P  ,  B  ,  I  )         S  K    P  B  I     S(K)=(P,B,I)   , where P contains all points of the projective plane not on K , B contains all line of the projective plane intersecting K in d points, and the incidence I is the natural inclusion. This is a partial geometry    p  g   (   q  -  d   ,   q  -   q  d    ,    q  -   q  d   -  d   +  1   )       p  g     q  d     q    q  d        q    q  d   d   1      pg(q-d,q-\frac{q}{d},q-\frac{q}{d}-d+1)   .  Consider the space    P  G   (  3  ,   2  h   )    (  h  ≥  1  )      fragments  P  G   fragments  normal-(  3  normal-,   superscript  2  h   normal-)    fragments  normal-(  h   1  normal-)     PG(3,2^{h})(h\geq 1)   and let K a maximal arc of degree    d  =   2  s    (  1  ≤  s  ≤  m  )      fragments  d    superscript  2  s    fragments  normal-(  1   s   m  normal-)     d=2^{s}(1\leq s\leq m)   in a two-dimensional subspace   π   π   \pi   . Consider an incidence structure      T  2  *    (  K  )    =   (  P  ,  B  ,  I  )          superscript   subscript  T  2     K    P  B  I     T_{2}^{*}(K)=(P,B,I)   where P contains all the points not in   π   π   \pi   , B contains all lines not in   π   π   \pi   and intersecting   π   π   \pi   in a point in K , and I is again the natural inclusion.     T  2  *    (  K  )        superscript   subscript  T  2     K    T_{2}^{*}(K)   is again a partial geometry    p  g   (    2  h   -  1   ,    (    2  h   +  1   )    (    2  m   -  1   )    ,    2  m   -  1   )       p  g      superscript  2  h   1        superscript  2  h   1      superscript  2  m   1       superscript  2  m   1      pg(2^{h}-1,(2^{h}+1)(2^{m}-1),2^{m}-1)\,   .
