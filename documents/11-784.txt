   Riboflavinase      Riboflavinase   In enzymology , a riboflavinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   riboflavin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ribitol + lumichrome   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are riboflavin and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ribitol and lumichrome .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in compounds that have not been otherwise categorized within EC number 3.5. The systematic name of this enzyme class is riboflavin hydrolase . This enzyme participates in riboflavin metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
