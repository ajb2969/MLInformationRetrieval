Linamarin synthase




Linamarin synthase

In enzymology, a linamarin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile 
 
 
 
  UDP + linamarin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, whereas its two products are UDP and linamarin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-ketone glucosyltransferase, uridine diphosphate-glucose-ketone cyanohydrin, beta-glucosyltransferase, UDP glucose ketone cyanohydrin glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:ketone cyanohydrin beta-glucosyltransferase, and uridine diphosphoglucose-ketone cyanohydrin glucosyltransferase.
