Benzoate—CoA ligase




Benzoate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a benzoate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + benzoate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + benzoyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, benzoate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and benzoyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include benzoate-coenzyme A ligase, benzoyl-coenzyme A synthetase, and benzoyl CoA synthetase (AMP forming). This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
