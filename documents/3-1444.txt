   Very Long Baseline Array      Very Long Baseline Array     The Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) is a system of ten radio telescopes which are operated remotely from their Array Operations Center located in Socorro, New Mexico , as a part of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). These ten radio antennas work together as an array that forms the longest system in the world that uses very long baseline interferometry . The longest baseline available in this interferometer is about . 1  The construction of the VLBA began in February 1986 and it was completed in May 1993. The first astronometrical observation using all ten antennas was carried out on May 29, 1993. The total cost of building the VLBA was about 85 million dollars.  Each receiver in the VLBA consists of a parabolic dish antenna 25 meters (82 feet) in diameter, along with its adjacent control building. This contains the supporting electronics and machinery for the receiver, including low-noise electronics, digital computers , data storage units, and the antenna-pointing machinery. Each of the antennas is about as tall as a ten-story building when the antenna is pointed straight up, and each antenna weighs about 218 metric tons (240 short tons ).  The signals from each antenna are recorded on a bank of approximately one- terabyte hard disc drives, and the information is time-stamped using atomic clocks . Once the disc drives are loaded with information, they are carried to the Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center at the NRAO in Socorro. There the information undergoes signal processing in a powerful set of digital computers that carry out the interferometry. These computers also make corrections for the rotation of the Earth, the slight shifts in the crust of the Earth over time, and other small measurement errors .  Observations by the VLBA  The Very Long Baseline Array usually makes radio observations at wavelengths from three millimeters to 28 centimeters , or in other words, at frequencies from 0.3 gigahertz to 96 gigahertz. Within this frequency range, the VLBA observes in eight different frequency bands that are useful for radio astronomy. The VLBA also makes observations in two narrow radio bands below one gigahertz that include spectral lines produced by bright maser emissions.  The VLBA radio telescopes are located at:      Toponym   U.S. state   Geographic coordinate system        St. Croix   U.S. Virgin Islands    SC     Hancock   New Hampshire    HN     North Liberty   Iowa    NL     Fort Davis   Texas    FD     Los Alamos   New Mexico    LA     Pie Town   New Mexico    PT     Kitt Peak   Arizona    KP     Owens Valley   California    OV     Brewster   Washington    BR     Mauna Kea   Hawaii    MK     High-Sensitivity Array  The use of the VLBA can be scheduled dynamically, and its sensitivity can be improved by a factor of five by including other radio telescopes such as the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico and the Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany. These four additional sites are brought online for as much as 100 hours per four-month trimester. In this configuration, the entire array is known as the High-Sensitivity Array ( HSA ). 2 These sites, with coordinates, are as follows:      Toponym   State   Geographic coordinate system        Arecibo   Puerto Rico    AR     Green Bank   West Virginia    GB     Very Large Array   New Mexico    Y27     Effelsberg   Germany    EB     Baseline distance and angular resolution  Distance between each VLBA baseline (km): 3 The longest baseline in the array is . 4       SC   HN   NL   FD   LA   PT   KP   OV   BR   MK   EB   AR   GB   Y27       SC   ...   2853   3645   4143   4458   4579   4839   5460   5767   8611   6822   238   2708   4532     HN   2853   ...   1611   3105   3006   3226   3623   3885   3657   7502   5602   2748   829   3198     NL   3645   1611   ...   1654   1432   1663   2075   2328   2300   6156   6734   3461   1064   1640     FD   4143   3105   1654   ...   608   564   744   1508   2345   5134   8084   3922   2354   515     LA   4458   3006   1432   608   ...   236   652   1088   1757   4970   7831   4246   2344   226     PT   4579   3226   1663   564   236   ...   417   973   1806   4795   8014   4365   2551   52     KP   4839   3623   2075   744   652   417   ...   845   1913   4466   8321   4623   2939   441     OV   5460   3885   2328   1508   1088   973   845   ...   1214   4015   8203   5255   3323   1025     BR   5767   3657   2300   2345   1757   1806   1913   1214   ...   4398   7441   5585   3326   1849     MK   8611   7502   6156   5134   4970   4795   4466   4015   4398   ...   10328   8434   7028   4835     EB   6822   5602   6734   8084   7831   8014   8321   8203   7441   10328   ...   6911   6335   8008     AR   238   2748   3461   3922   4246   4365   4623   5255   5585   8434   6911   ...   2545   4317     GB   2708   829   1064   2354   2344   2551   2939   3323   3326   7028   6335   2545   ...   2516     Y27   4532   3198   1640   515   226   52   441   1025   1849   4835   8008   4317   2516   ...
