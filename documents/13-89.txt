   Polyphase sequence      Polyphase sequence   In mathematics, a polyphase sequence is a sequence whose terms are complex  roots of unity :       a  n   =    e   i    2  π   q    x  n           subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i      2  π   q    subscript  x  n       a_{n}=e^{i\frac{2\pi}{q}x_{n}}\,     where x n is an integer .  Polyphase sequences are an important class of sequences and play important roles in synchronizing sequence design.  See also   Zadoff–Chu sequence   References     "  Category:Sequences and series
