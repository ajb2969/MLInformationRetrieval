   Diphthine—ammonia ligase      Diphthine—ammonia ligase   In enzymology , a diphthine-ammonia ligase (, diphthamide synthase , diphthamide synthetase ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + diphthine + NH 3    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + diphthamide    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , diphthine , and NH 3 , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and diphthamide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is diphthine:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include diphthamide synthase , and diphthamide synthetase .
