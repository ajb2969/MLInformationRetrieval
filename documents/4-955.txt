Global section functor




Global section functor

Let X be a topological space, and 
 
 
 
  denote the category of sheaves with values in 
 
 
 
 . Then the map that associates to a sheaf 
 
 
 
  its global sections

 
  is a covariant functor to 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is the category of abelian groups, then this functor is left exact. This important remark leads to the notion of sheaf cohomology, via derived functors.
Examples

Let 
 
 
 
  be the locally constant sheaf. Then its global sections are given by 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the direct sum indexed by connected components of X


Let 
 
 
 
  be the sheaf of holomorphic functions on the compact connected complex manifold X, then by the maximum principle, global sections are constant, ie.




Let 
 
 
 
  denote the twisting sheaves on the projective space

 
 , then 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , and 0 for 
 
 
 
 .
