Reinhardt domain

In mathematics, especially several complex variables, an open subset 
 
 
 
  of Cn is called Reinhardt domain if 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
  for all real numbers 
 
 
 
 .
The reason for studying these kinds of domains is that logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain are the domains of convergence of power series in several complex variables. Note that in one complex variable, a logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain is simply a disc.
The intersection of logarithmically convex Reinhardt domains is still a logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain, so for every Reinhardt domain, there is a smallest logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain which contains it.
A simple example of logarithmically convex Reinhardt domains is a polydisc, that is, a product of disks.
Thullen's classical result says that a 2-dimensional bounded Reinhard domain containing the origin is biholomorphic to one of the following domains provided that the orbit of the origin by the automorphism group has positive dimension:
(1) 
 
 
 
  (polydisc);
(2) 
 
 
 
  (unit ball);
(3) 
 
 
 
  (Thullen domain).
In 1978, Toshikazu Sunada established a generalization of Thullen's result, and proved that two 
 
 
 
 -dimensional bounded Reinhardt domains 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are mutually biholomorphic if and only if there exists a transformation 
 
 
 
  given by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  being a permutation of the indices), such that
