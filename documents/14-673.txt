   Cramér's V      Cramér's V   In statistics , Cramér's V (sometimes referred to as Cramér's phi and denoted as φ c ) is a measure of association between two nominal variables , giving a value between 0 and +1 (inclusive). It is based on Pearson's chi-squared statistic and was published by Harald Cramér in 1946. 1  Usage and interpretation  φ c is the intercorrelation of two discrete variables 2 and may be used with variables having two or more levels. φ c is a symmetrical measure, it does not matter which variable we place in the columns and which in the rows. Also, the order of rows/columns doesn't matter, so φ c may be used with nominal data types or higher (ordered, numerical, etc.)  Cramér's V may also be applied to goodness of fit chi-squared models when there is a 1×k table (e.g.: r =1). In this case k is taken as the number of optional outcomes and it functions as a measure of tendency towards a single outcome.  Cramér's V varies from 0 (corresponding to no association between the variables) to 1 (complete association) and can reach 1 only when the two variables are equal to each other.  φ c 2 is the mean square canonical correlation between the variables.  In the case of a 2×2 contingency table Cramér's V is equal to the Phi coefficient .  Note that as chi-squared values tend to increase with the number of cells, the greater the difference between r (rows) and c (columns), the more likely φ c will tend to 1 without strong evidence of a meaningful correlation.  V may be viewed as the association between two variables as a percentage of their maximum possible variation. V 2 is the mean square canonical correlation between the variables.  Calculation  Let a sample of size n of the simultaneously distributed variables   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   for     i  =   1  ,  …  ,  r    ;   j  =   1  ,  …  ,  k       formulae-sequence    i   1  normal-…  r      j   1  normal-…  k      i=1,\ldots,r;j=1,\ldots,k   be given by the frequencies       n   i  j    =        subscript  n    i  j    absent    n_{ij}=   number of times the values    (   A  i   ,   B  j   )      subscript  A  i    subscript  B  j     (A_{i},B_{j})   were observed.  The chi-squared statistic then is:       χ  2   =    ∑   i  ,  j       (    n   i  j    -     n   i  .     n   .  j     n    )   2      n   i  .     n   .  j     n          superscript  χ  2     subscript    i  j       superscript     subscript  n    i  j         subscript  n   fragments  i  normal-.     subscript  n   fragments  normal-.  j     n    2        subscript  n   fragments  i  normal-.     subscript  n   fragments  normal-.  j     n       \chi^{2}=\sum_{i,j}\frac{(n_{ij}-\frac{n_{i.}n_{.j}}{n})^{2}}{\frac{n_{i.}n_{.%
 j}}{n}}     Cramér's V is computed by taking the square root of the chi-squared statistic divided by the sample size and the minimum dimension minus 1:      V  =     φ  2    min   (   k  -  1   ,   r  -  1   )      =      χ  2   /  n    min   (   k  -  1   ,   r  -  1   )            V       superscript  φ  2       k  1     r  1                  superscript  χ  2   n       k  1     r  1         V=\sqrt{\frac{\varphi^{2}}{\min(k-1,r-1)}}=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^{2}/n}{\min(k-1,r-%
 1)}}   where:       φ  2     superscript  φ  2    \varphi^{2}   is the phi coefficient .      χ  2     superscript  χ  2    \chi^{2}   is derived from Pearson's chi-squared test     n   n   n   is the grand total of observations and     k   k   k   being the number of columns.     r   r   r   being the number of rows.   The p-value for the significance of V is the same one that is calculated using the Pearson's chi-squared test .  The formula for the variance of V =φ c is known. 3  In R, the function cramersV() from the lsr package, calculates V using the chisq.test function from the stats package. 4  See also  Other measures of correlation for nominal data:   The phi coefficient  Tschuprow's T  The uncertainty coefficient  The Lambda coefficient   Other related articles:   Contingency table  Effect size   References   Cramér, H.
