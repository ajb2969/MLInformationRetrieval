   Baxter permutation      Baxter permutation   In combinatorial  mathematics , a Baxter permutation is a permutation     σ  ∈   S  n       σ   subscript  S  n     \sigma\in S_{n}   which satisfies the following generalized pattern avoidance property:   There are no indices i < j < k such that σ ( j + 1) < σ ( i ) < σ ( k ) < σ ( j ) or σ ( j ) < σ ( k ) < σ ( i ) < σ ( j + 1).   For example, the permutation σ = 2413 in S 4 (written in one-line notation ) is not a Baxter permutation because, taking i = 1, j = 2 and k = 4, this permutation violates the first condition.  These permutations were introduced by Glen E. Baxter in the context of mathematical analysis .  Enumeration  For n = 1, 2, 3, ..., the number a n of Baxter permutations of length n is   1, 2, 6, 22, 92, 422, 2074, 10754, 58202, 326240, 1882960, 11140560, 67329992, 414499438, 2593341586, 16458756586,...   This is sequence  in the OEIS . In general, a n has the following formula:         a_n \, = \,\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\binom{n+1}{k-1}\binom{n+1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k+1}}{\binom{n+1}{1}\binom{n+1}{2}} . 1  In fact, this formula is graded by the number of descents in the permutations, i.e., there are      (       n  +  1        k  -  1       )    (       n  +  1       k      )    (       n  +  1        k  +  1       )      (       n  +  1       1      )    (       n  +  1       2      )           binomial    n  1     k  1     binomial    n  1   k    binomial    n  1     k  1        binomial    n  1   1    binomial    n  1   2      \frac{{\left({{n+1}\atop{k-1}}\right)}{\left({{n+1}\atop{k}}\right)}{\left({{n%
 +1}\atop{k+1}}\right)}}{{\left({{n+1}\atop{1}}\right)}{\left({{n+1}\atop{2}}%
 \right)}}   Baxter permutations in S n with k-1 descents.  Other properties   The number of alternating Baxter permutations of length 2 n is ( C n ) 2 , the square of a Catalan number , and of length 2 n + 1 is C n C n +1 . 2  The number of doubly alternating permutations of length 2 n and 2 n + 1 (i.e., those for which both σ and its inverse σ −1 are alternating) is the Catalan number C n . 3  Baxter permutations are related to Hopf algebras , 4  planar graphs , 5 and tilings . 6 7   See also   Enumerations of specific permutation classes   References  External links   Sequence A001181 in OEIS .
