Baxter permutation




Baxter permutation

In combinatorial mathematics, a Baxter permutation is a permutation

 
  which satisfies the following generalized pattern avoidance property:

There are no indices i < j < k such that σ(j + 1) < σ(i) < σ(k) < σ(j) or σ(j) < σ(k) < σ(i) < σ(j + 1).

For example, the permutation σ = 2413 in S4 (written in one-line notation) is not a Baxter permutation because, taking i = 1, j = 2 and k = 4, this permutation violates the first condition.
These permutations were introduced by Glen E. Baxter in the context of mathematical analysis.
Enumeration
For n = 1, 2, 3, ..., the number an of Baxter permutations of length n is

1, 2, 6, 22, 92, 422, 2074, 10754, 58202, 326240, 1882960, 11140560, 67329992, 414499438, 2593341586, 16458756586,...

This is sequence  in the OEIS. In general, an has the following formula:






a_n \, = \,\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\binom{n+1}{k-1}\binom{n+1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k+1}}{\binom{n+1}{1}\binom{n+1}{2}} .1
In fact, this formula is graded by the number of descents in the permutations, i.e., there are 
 
 
 
  Baxter permutations in Sn with k-1 descents.
Other properties

The number of alternating Baxter permutations of length 2n is (Cn)2, the square of a Catalan number, and of length 2n + 1 is CnCn+1.2
The number of doubly alternating permutations of length 2n and 2n + 1 (i.e., those for which both σ and its inverse σ−1 are alternating) is the Catalan number Cn.3
Baxter permutations are related to Hopf algebras,4 planar graphs,5 and tilings.67
