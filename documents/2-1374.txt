   Bean machine      Bean machine   (Figure)  The bean machine, as drawn by Sir Francis Galton   The bean machine , also known as the quincunx or Galton box , is a device invented by Sir Francis Galton 1 to demonstrate the central limit theorem , in particular that the normal distribution is approximate to the binomial distribution .  The machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins. Balls are dropped from the top, and bounce left and right as they hit the pins. Eventually, they are collected into one-ball-wide bins at the bottom. The height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve .  Overlaying Pascal's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin.  A large-scale working model of this device can be seen at the Museum of Science, Boston in the Mathematica exhibit (currently closed).  Distribution of the balls  If a ball bounces to the right k times on its way down (and to the left on the remaining pins) it ends up in the k th bin counting from the left. Denoting the number of rows of pins in a bean machine by n , the number of paths to the k th bin on the bottom is given by the binomial coefficient     (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   . If the probability of bouncing right on a pin is p (which equals 0.5 on an unbiased machine) the probability that the ball ends up in the k th bin equals     (      n      k      )    p  k     (   1  -  p   )    n  -  k         binomial  n  k    superscript  p  k    superscript    1  p     n  k      {n\choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}   . This is the probability mass function of a binomial distribution .  According to the central limit theorem the binomial distribution approximates the normal distribution provided that n , the number of rows of pins in the machine, is large.
