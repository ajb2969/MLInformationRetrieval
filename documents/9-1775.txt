First, the time series is time delay embedded into a reconstructed phase space. Then, around each point in the embedded phase space, a recurrence neighbourhood of radius   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is created. All recurrences into this neighbourhood are tracked, and the time interval   T   T   T   between recurrences is recorded in a histogram. This histogram is normalised to create an estimate of the recurrence period density function    P   (  T  )       P  T    P(T)   . The normalised entropy of this density is the RPDE value    H   n  o  r  m      subscript  H    n  o  r  m     H_{norm}   .  Licensing  "
