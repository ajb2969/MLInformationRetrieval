== Summary == Pictorial description of the calculations required to find the RPDE value. First, the time series is time delay embedded into a reconstructed phase space. Then, around each point in the embedded phase space, a recurrence neighbourhood of radius 
 
 
 
  is created. All recurrences into this neighbourhood are tracked, and the time interval 
 
 
 
  between recurrences is recorded in a histogram. This histogram is normalised to create an estimate of the recurrence period density function 
 
 
 
 . The normalised entropy of this density is the RPDE value 
 
 
 
 .
