   Einstein protocol      Einstein protocol   Einstein protocol is a standard used for precisely measuring the distance between two objects in space . 1 The Einstein protocol of finding the distance between two points is sending light from point   a   a   a   to point   b   b   b   and then immediately sending a signal, using light, from point   b   b   b   to point   a   a   a   . The calculations done with this data uses the formula    D  =   c     t  3   -   t  1    2        D    c       subscript  t  3    subscript  t  1    2      D=c{{t_{3}-t_{1}}\over 2}   .  The protocol  Because there are many factors in measuring the distance of space a protocol was set up to determine order of importance when measuring a distance, using light, from   a   a   a   to   b   b   b   and back.  References    Footnotes  Because space is not linear we can attribute one factor to the curvature of space and time when light is sent from one area to the next.
