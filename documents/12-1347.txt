Einstein protocol

Einstein protocol is a standard used for precisely measuring the distance between two objects in space.1 The Einstein protocol of finding the distance between two points is sending light from point 
 
 
 
  to point 
 
 
 
  and then immediately sending a signal, using light, from point 
 
 
 
 
  to point 
 
 
 
 . The calculations done with this data uses the formula 
 
 
 
 .
The protocol
Because there are many factors in measuring the distance of space a protocol was set up to determine order of importance when measuring a distance, using light, from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and back.

Footnotes
Because space is not linear we can attribute one factor to the curvature of space and time when light is sent from one area to the next.
