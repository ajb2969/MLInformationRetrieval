   Lactosylceramide 1,3-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyltransferase      Lactosylceramide 1,3-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyltransferase   In enzymology , a lactosylceramide 1,3-N-anning-beta-D-glrofelucosaminyltlolferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-1,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D- glucosylceramide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide , whereas its 3 products are UDP , N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-1,3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D- , and glucosylceramide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:D-galactosyl-1,4-beta-D-glucosylceramide beta-1,3-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . Other names in common use include LA2 synthase , beta1->3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-lactosylceramide , beta-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , and lactosylceramide beta-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lactoseries , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - neo-lactoseries , and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2 .
