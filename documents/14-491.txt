Bayes classifier

In statistical classification the Bayes classifier minimises the probability of misclassification.1
Definition
Suppose a pair 
 
 
 
  takes values in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the class label of 
 
 
 
 . This means that the conditional distribution of X, given that the label Y takes the value r is given by


 
  for 
 
 

where "
 
 
 
 " means "is distributed as", and where 
 
 
 
  denotes a probability distribution.
A classifier is a rule that assigns to an observation X=x a guess or estimate of what the unobserved label Y=r actually was. In theoretical terms, a classifier is a measurable function 
 
 
 
 , with the interpretation that C classifies the point x to the class C(x). The probability of misclassification, or risk, of a classifier C is defined as



The Bayes classifier is



In practice, as in most of statistics, the difficulties and subtleties are associated with modeling the probability distributions effectively—in this case, 
 
 
 
 . The Bayes classifier is a useful benchmark in statistical classification.
The excess risk of a general classifier 
 
 
 
  (possibly depending on some training data) is defined as 
 
 
 
  Thus this non-negative quantity is important for assessing the performance of different classification techniques. A classifier is said to be consistent if the excess risk converges to zero as the size of the training data set tends to infinity.
