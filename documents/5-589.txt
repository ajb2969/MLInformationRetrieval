Dual representation

In mathematics, if 
 
 
 
  is a group and 
 
 
 
  is a linear representation of it on the vector space

 
 , then the dual representation

 
  is defined over the dual vector space

 
  as follows:1



 
  is the transpose of , that is, 
 
 
 
  =  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

The dual representation is also known as the contragredient representation.
If 
 
 
 
  is a Lie algebra and 
 
 
 
  is a representation of it on the vector space 
 
 
 
 , then the dual representation 
 
 
 
  is defined over the dual vector space 
 
 
 
  as follows:2



 
  =  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

In both cases, the dual representation is a representation in the usual sense.
Motivation
In representation theory, both vectors in 
 
 
 
  and linear functionals in 
 
 
 
  are considered as column vectors so that the representation can act (by matrix multiplication) from the left. Given a basis for 
 
 
 
  and the dual basis for 
 
 
 
 , the action of a linear functional 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  can be expressed by matrix multiplication,


 
 , where the superscript 
 
 
 
  is matrix transpose. Consistency requires


3 With the definition given,


 
 .
For the Lie algebra representation one chooses consistency with a possible group representation. Generally, if 
 
 
 
  is a representation of a Lie group, then 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  is a representation of its Lie algebra. If 
 
 
 
  is dual to 
 
 
 
 , then its corresponding Lie algebra representation 
 
 
 
  is given by

Generalization
A general ring module does not admit a dual representation. Modules of Hopf algebras do, however.
