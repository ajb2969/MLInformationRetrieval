   Dual representation      Dual representation   In mathematics , if   G   G   G   is a group and   ρ   ρ   ρ   is a linear representation of it on the vector space    V   V   V   , then the dual representation     ρ  *     fragments  ρ     ρ*   is defined over the dual vector space     V  *     fragments  V     V*   as follows: 1       ρ  *   (  g  )       ρ  g    ρ*(g)   is the transpose of , that is,    ρ  *   (  g  )       ρ  g    ρ*(g)   = for all    g  ∈  G      g  normal-∈  G    g∈G   .   The dual representation is also known as the contragredient representation .  If   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is a Lie algebra and   π   π   π   is a representation of it on the vector space   V   V   V   , then the dual representation    π  *     fragments  π     π*   is defined over the dual vector space    V  *     fragments  V     V*   as follows: 2       π  *   (  X  )       π  X    π*(X)   = for all    X  ∈  𝐠      X  normal-∈  𝐠    X∈\mathbf{g}   .   In both cases, the dual representation is a representation in the usual sense.  Motivation  In representation theory, both vectors in   V   V   V   and linear functionals in    V  *     fragments  V     V*   are considered as column vectors so that the representation can act (by matrix multiplication) from the left . Given a basis for   V   V   V   and the dual basis for    V  *     fragments  V     V*   , the action of a linear functional   φ   φ   φ   on   v   v   v   ,    φ   (  v  )       φ  v    φ(v)   can be expressed by matrix multiplication,       ⟨  φ  ,  v  ⟩   ≡   φ   (  v  )    =    φ  T   v          φ  v     φ  v           superscript  φ  T   v      \langle\varphi,v\rangle\equiv\varphi(v)=\varphi^{T}v   , where the superscript   T   T   T   is matrix transpose. Consistency requires        ⟨    ρ  *    (  g  )   φ   ,   ρ   (  g  )   v   ⟩   =   ⟨  φ  ,  v  ⟩    .          superscript  ρ    g  φ     ρ  g  v     φ  v     \langle{\rho}^{*}(g)\varphi,\rho(g)v\rangle=\langle\varphi,v\rangle.    3 With the definition given,       ⟨    ρ  *    (  g  )   φ   ,   ρ   (  g  )   v   ⟩   =   ⟨   ρ    (   g   -  1    )   T   φ   ,   ρ   (  g  )   v   ⟩   =     (   ρ    (   g   -  1    )   T   φ   )   T   ρ   (  g  )   v   =    φ  T   ρ   (   g   -  1    )   ρ   (  g  )   v   =    φ  T   v   =   ⟨  φ  ,  v  ⟩             superscript  ρ    g  φ     ρ  g  v       ρ   superscript   superscript  g    1    T   φ     ρ  g  v            superscript    ρ   superscript   superscript  g    1    T   φ   T   ρ  g  v           superscript  φ  T   ρ   superscript  g    1    ρ  g  v           superscript  φ  T   v         φ  v      \langle{\rho}^{*}(g)\varphi,\rho(g)v\rangle=\langle\rho(g^{-1})^{T}\varphi,%
 \rho(g)v\rangle=(\rho(g^{-1})^{T}\varphi)^{T}\rho(g)v=\varphi^{T}\rho(g^{-1})%
 \rho(g)v=\varphi^{T}v=\langle\varphi,v\rangle   .  For the Lie algebra representation one chooses consistency with a possible group representation. Generally, if   Π   normal-Π   Π   is a representation of a Lie group, then   π   π   π   given by        π   (  X  )    =      d   d  t    Π   (   e   t  X    )    |    t  =  0     .        π  X    evaluated-at      d    d  t    normal-Π   superscript  e    t  X       t  0      \pi(X)=\frac{d}{dt}\Pi(e^{tX})|_{t=0}.   is a representation of its Lie algebra. If    Π  *     fragments  Π     Π*   is dual to   Π   normal-Π   Π   , then its corresponding Lie algebra representation    π  *     fragments  π     π*   is given by         π  *    (  X  )    =      d   d  t     Π  *    (   e   t  X    )    |    t  =  0    =      d   d  t    Π    (   e   -   t  X     )   T    |    t  =  0    =   -   π    (  X  )   T      .           superscript  π    X    evaluated-at      d    d  t     superscript  normal-Π     superscript  e    t  X       t  0          evaluated-at      d    d  t    normal-Π   superscript   superscript  e      t  X     T      t  0             π   superscript  X  T        \pi^{*}(X)=\frac{d}{dt}\Pi^{*}(e^{tX})|_{t=0}=\frac{d}{dt}\Pi(e^{-tX})^{T}|_{t%
 =0}=-\pi(X)^{T}.   . 4  Generalization  A general ring module does not admit a dual representation. Modules of Hopf algebras do, however.
