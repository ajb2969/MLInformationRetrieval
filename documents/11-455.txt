Cephalosporin-C deacetylase




Cephalosporin-C deacetylase

In enzymology, a cephalosporin-C deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cephalosporin C + H2O 
 
 
 
  deacetylcephalosporin C + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cephalosporin C and H2O, whereas its two products are deacetylcephalosporin C and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cephalosporin-C acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include cephalosporin C acetyl-hydrolase, cephalosporin C acetylase, cephalosporin acetylesterase, cephalosporin C acetylesterase, cephalosporin C acetyl-esterase, and cephalosporin C deacetylase. This enzyme participates in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis.
