4-methyloxaloacetate esterase

In enzymology, a 4-methyloxaloacetate esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

oxaloacetate 4-methyl ester + H2O 
 
 
 
  oxaloacetate + methanol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are oxaloacetate 4-methyl ester and H2O, whereas its two products are oxaloacetate and methanol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oxaloacetate-4-methyl-ester oxaloacetohydrolase.
