   Pedoe's inequality      Pedoe's inequality   In geometry , Pedoe's inequality , named after Daniel Pedoe , states that if a , b , and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle with area ƒ , and A , B , and C are the lengths of the sides of a triangle with area F , then          A  2    (     b  2   +   c  2    -   a  2    )    +    B  2    (     a  2   +   c  2    -   b  2    )    +    C  2    (     a  2   +   b  2    -   c  2    )     ≥   16  F  f    ,           superscript  A  2        superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2     superscript  a  2        superscript  B  2        superscript  a  2    superscript  c  2     superscript  b  2        superscript  C  2        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2     superscript  c  2        16  F  f     A^{2}(b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2})+B^{2}(a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2})+C^{2}(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2})\geq

 6Ff,\,     with equality if and only if the two triangles are similar with pairs of corresponding sides ( A, a ), ( B, b ), and ( C, c ).  The expression on the left is not only symmetric under any of the six permutations of the set { ( A , a ), ( B , b ), ( C , c ) } of pairs, but also—perhaps not so obviously—remains the same if a is interchanged with A and b with B and c with C . In other words, it is a symmetric function of the pair of triangles.  Pedoe's inequality is a generalization of Weitzenböck's inequality , which is the case in which one of the triangles is equilateral .
