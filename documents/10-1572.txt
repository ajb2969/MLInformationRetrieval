   Trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (cytochrome c)      Trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (cytochrome c)   In enzymology , a trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (cytochrome c) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trimethylamine + 2 (ferricytochrome c)-subunit + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   trimethylamine N-oxide + 2 (ferrocytochrome c)-subunit + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are trimethylamine , (ferricytochrome c)-subunit , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are trimethylamine N-oxide , (ferrocytochrome c)-subunit , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trimethylamine:cytochrome c oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include TMAO reductase , and TOR . This enzyme participates in two-component system - general .  References        "  Category:EC 1.7.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
