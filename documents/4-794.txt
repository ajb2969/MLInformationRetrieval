   Pullback (category theory)      Pullback (category theory)   In category theory , a branch of mathematics , a pullback (also called a fiber product , fibre product , fibered product or Cartesian square ) is the limit of a diagram consisting of two morphisms     f  :   X  →  Z      normal-:  f    X  normal-→  Z     f:X→Z   and    g  :   Y  →  Z      normal-:  g    Y  normal-→  Z     g:Y→Z   with a common codomain; it is the limit of the cospan     X  →  Z  ←  Y      X  normal-→  Z  normal-←  Y    X→Z←Y   . The pullback is often written    X × Z  Y }} .   The categorical dual of a pullback is a called a pushout . Remarks opposite to the above apply: the pushout is a coproduct with additional structure.  Universal property  Explicitly, the pullback of the morphisms   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   consists of an object   P   P   P   and two morphisms and for which the diagram      commutes . Moreover, the pullback must be universal with respect to this diagram. That is, for any other such triple for which the following diagram commutes, there must exist a unique    u  :   Q  →  P      normal-:  u    Q  normal-→  P     u:Q→P   (called a mediating morphism) such that          p  2   ∘  u   =   q  2    ,     p  1   ∘  u   =   q  1     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  p  2   u    subscript  q  2         subscript  p  1   u    subscript  q  1      p_{2}\circ u=q_{2},\qquad p_{1}\circ u=q_{1}.         As with all universal constructions, the pullback, if it exists, is unique up to isomorphism . In fact, given two pullbacks and of the same cospan, there is a unique isomorphism between   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   respecting the pullback structure.  Weak pullbacks  A weak pullback of a cospan     X  →  Z  ←  Y      X  normal-→  Z  normal-←  Y    X→Z←Y   is a cone over the cospan that is only weakly universal , that is, the mediating morphism    u  :   Q  →  P      normal-:  u    Q  normal-→  P     u:Q→P   above is not required to be unique.  Pullback and product  The pullback is similar to the product , but not the same. One may obtain the product by "forgetting" that the morphisms   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   exist, and forgetting that the object   Z   Z   Z   exists. One is then left with a discrete category containing only the two objects   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   , and no arrows between them. This discrete category may be used as the index set to construct the ordinary binary product. Thus, the pullback can be thought of as the ordinary (Cartesian) product, but with additional structure. Instead of "forgetting"   Z   Z   Z   ,   f   f   f   , and   g   g   g   , one can also "trivialize" them by specializing   Z   Z   Z   to be the terminal object (assuming it exists).   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   are then uniquely determined and thus carry no information, and the pullback of this cospan can be seen to be the product of   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   .  Examples  Commutative rings  In the category of commutative rings (with identity), denoted   𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠   𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠   \mathbf{CRing}   , the pullback is called the fibered product. Let       A  ,  B  ,   C  ∈  O  b   (  𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠  )       A  B    C  normal-∈  O  b  𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠     A,B,C∈Ob(\mathbf{CRing})   ,      α  :   A  →  C  ∈  H  o  m   (  𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠  )       normal-:  α    A  normal-→  C  normal-∈  H  o  m  𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠     α:A→C∈Hom(\mathbf{CRing})   ,      β  :   B  →  C  ∈  H  o  m   (  𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠  )       normal-:  β    B  normal-→  C  normal-∈  H  o  m  𝐂𝐑𝐢𝐧𝐠     β:B→C∈Hom(\mathbf{CRing})   .   So   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   , and   C   C   C   are commutative rings with identity and   α   α   α   and   β   β   β   are ring homomorphisms. Then the pullback of this diagram is the subring of the Cartesian product    A  ×  B      A  normal-×  B    A×B   defined by       A   ×  C   B   =   {    (  a  ,  b  )   ∈   A  ×   B     |    α   (  a  )    =   β   (  b  )     }         subscript   C   A  B    conditional-set     a  b     A  B        α  a     β  b       A\times_{C}B=\left\{(a,b)\in A\times B\;\big|\;\alpha(a)=\beta(b)\right\}     along with the morphisms       β  ′   :    A   ×  C   B   →   A  ,   α  ′     :    A   ×  C   B   →  B        normal-:   superscript  β  normal-′    normal-→    subscript   C   A  B    A   superscript  α  normal-′       normal-:     normal-→    subscript   C   A  B   B      \beta^{\prime}\colon A\times_{C}B\to A,\qquad\alpha^{\prime}\colon A\times_{C}%
 B\to B     given by      β  ′    (  a  ,  b  )    =  a         superscript  β  normal-′    a  b    a    \beta^{\prime}(a,b)=a   and      α  ′    (  a  ,  b  )    =  b         superscript  α  normal-′    a  b    b    \alpha^{\prime}(a,b)=b   for all     (  a  ,  b  )   ∈   A   ×  C   B        a  b     subscript   C   A  B     (a,b)\in A\times_{C}B   , for which        α  ∘   β  ′    =   β  ∘   α  ′     .        α   superscript  β  normal-′      β   superscript  α  normal-′      \alpha\circ\beta^{\prime}=\beta\circ\alpha^{\prime}.     Sets  In the category of sets , a pullback of   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   is given by the set        X   ×  Z   Y   =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   X  ×  Y    |    f   (  x  )    =   g   (  y  )     }    ,        subscript   Z   X  Y    conditional-set     x  y     X  Y        f  x     g  y       X\times_{Z}Y=\{(x,y)\in X\times Y|f(x)=g(y)\},     together with the restrictions of the projection maps  and to .  Alternatively one may view the pullback in   𝐒𝐞𝐭   𝐒𝐞𝐭   \mathbf{Set}   asymmetrically:       X   ×  Z   Y   ≅    ∐   x  ∈  X      g   -  1     [   {   f   (  x  )    }   ]     ≅    ∐   y  ∈  Y      f   -  1     [   {   g   (  y  )    }   ]             subscript   Z   X  Y     subscript  coproduct    x  X       superscript  g    1     delimited-[]     f  x              subscript  coproduct    y  Y       superscript  f    1     delimited-[]     g  y          X\times_{Z}Y\cong\coprod_{x\in X}g^{-1}[\{f(x)\}]\cong\coprod_{y\in Y}f^{-1}[%
 \{g(y)\}]     where   ∐   coproduct   \coprod   is the disjoint (tagged) union of sets (the involved sets are not disjoint on their own unless   f   f   f   resp.   g   g   g   is injective). In the first case, the projection extracts the   x   x   x   index while forgets the index, leaving elements of   Y   Y   Y   .  This example motivates another way of characterizing the pullback: as the equalizer of the morphisms where    X  ×  Y      X  normal-×  Y    X×Y   is the binary product of   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   and and are the natural projections. This shows that pullbacks exist in any category with binary products and equalizers. In fact, by the existence theorem for limits , all finite limits exist in a category with a terminal object, binary products and equalizers.  Fiber bundles  Another example of a pullback comes from the theory of fiber bundles : given a bundle map    π  :   E  →  B      normal-:  π    E  normal-→  B     π:E→B   and a continuous map     f  :   X  →  B      normal-:  f    X  normal-→  B     f:X→B   , the pullback is a fiber bundle over   X   X   X   called the pullback bundle . The associated commutative diagram is a morphism of fiber bundles.  Categories with a terminal object  In any category with a terminal object    T   T   T   , the pullback is just the ordinary product     X  ×  Y      X  normal-×  Y    X×Y   . 1  Preimages  Preimages of sets under functions can be described as pullbacks as follows:  Suppose    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f    A  normal-→  B     f:A→B   , . Let   g   g   g   be the inclusion map . Then a pullback of   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   (in   𝐒𝐞𝐭   𝐒𝐞𝐭   \mathbf{Set}   ) is given by the preimage together with the inclusion of the preimage in   A   A   A         and the restriction of   f   f   f   to   .   Properties   Whenever exists, then so does and there is an isomorphism .  Monomorphisms are stable under pullback: if the arrow   f   f   f   above is monic, then so is the arrow . For example, in the category of sets, if   X   X   X   is a subset of   Z   Z   Z   , then, for any    g  :   Y  →  Z      normal-:  g    Y  normal-→  Z     g:Y→Z   , the pullback is the inverse image of   X   X   X   under .  Isomorphisms are also stable, and hence, for example, for any map    Y  →  X      Y  normal-→  X    Y→X   .  Any category with pullbacks and products has equalizers.
