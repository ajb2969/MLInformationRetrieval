Barth–Nieto quintic

In algebraic geometry, the Barth–Nieto quintic is a quintic 3-fold in 4 (or sometimes 5) dimensional projective space studied by  that is the Hessian of the Segre cubic. The Barth–Nieto quintic is the closure of the set of points (x0:x1:x2:x3:x4:x5) of P5 satisfying the equations






The Barth–Nieto quintic is not rational, but has a smooth model that is a Calabi–Yau manifold.
