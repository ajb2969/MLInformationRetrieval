   Stratified Morse theory      Stratified Morse theory   In mathematics, stratified Morse theory is an analogue to Morse theory for general stratified spaces , originally developed by Mark Goresky and Robert MacPherson . The main point of the theory is to consider functions    f  :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  ℝ     f:M\to\mathbb{R}   and consider how the stratified space     f   -  1     (   -  ∞   ,  c  ]        superscript  f    1         c     f^{-1}(-\infty,c]   changes as the real number    c  ∈  ℝ      c  ℝ    c\in\mathbb{R}   changes. Morse theory of stratified spaces has uses everywhere from pure mathematics topics such as braid groups and representations to robot motion planning and potential theory. A popular application in pure mathematics is Morse theory on manifolds with boundary, and manifolds with corners.
