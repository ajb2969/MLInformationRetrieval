   TRNA-pseudouridine synthase I      TRNA-pseudouridine synthase I   In enzymology , a tRNA-pseudouridine synthase I () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   tRNA uridine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tRNA pseudouridine   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , tRNA uridine , and one product , tRNA pseudouridine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is tRNA-uridine uracilmutase . Other names in common use include tRNA-uridine isomerase , tRNA pseudouridylate synthase I , transfer ribonucleate pseudouridine synthetase , pseudouridine synthase , and transfer RNA pseudouridine synthetase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
