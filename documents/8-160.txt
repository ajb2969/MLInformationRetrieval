   Frey curve      Frey curve   In mathematics, a Frey curve or Frey–Hellegouarch curve is the elliptic curve         y  2   =   x   (   x  -   a  ℓ    )    (   x  +   b  ℓ    )         superscript  y  2     x    x   superscript  a  normal-ℓ      x   superscript  b  normal-ℓ       y^{2}=x(x-a^{\ell})(x+b^{\ell})        associated with a (hypothetical) solution of Fermat's equation         a  ℓ   +   b  ℓ    =   c  ℓ    .         superscript  a  normal-ℓ    superscript  b  normal-ℓ     superscript  c  normal-ℓ     a^{\ell}+b^{\ell}=c^{\ell}.     History  came up with the idea of associating solutions (a,b,c) of Fermat's equation with a completely different mathematical object: an elliptic curve. If ℓ is an odd prime and a , b , and c are positive integers such that         a  ℓ   +   b  ℓ    =   c  ℓ    ,         superscript  a  normal-ℓ    superscript  b  normal-ℓ     superscript  c  normal-ℓ     a^{\ell}+b^{\ell}=c^{\ell},     then a corresponding Frey curve is an algebraic curve given by the equation       y  2   =   x   (   x  -   a  ℓ    )    (   x  +   b  ℓ    )         superscript  y  2     x    x   superscript  a  normal-ℓ      x   superscript  b  normal-ℓ       y^{2}=x(x-a^{\ell})(x+b^{\ell})     or, equivalently        y  2   =   x   (   x  -   a  ℓ    )    (   x  -   c  ℓ    )     .       superscript  y  2     x    x   superscript  a  normal-ℓ      x   superscript  c  normal-ℓ       y^{2}=x(x-a^{\ell})(x-c^{\ell}).     This is a nonsingular algebraic curve of genus one defined over Q , and its projective completion is an elliptic curve over Q .  called attention to the unusual properties of the same curve as Hellegouarch, which became called a Frey curve. This provided a bridge between Fermat and Taniyama by showing that a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would create such a curve that would not be modular. The conjecture attracted considerable interest when  suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem. However, his argument was not complete. In 1985, Jean-Pierre Serre proposed that a Frey curve could not be modular and provided a partial proof of this. This showed that a proof of the semistable case of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture would imply Fermat's Last Theorem. Serre did not provide a complete proof and what was missing became known as the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture. In the summer of 1986, Ribet (1990) proved the epsilon conjecture, thereby proving that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implied Fermat's Last Theorem.
