Since 1999, the Lakers have played their home games at Staples Center . 1 The Lakers' franchise was founded in 1947 in Minneapolis , Minnesota . The first owners purchased the disbanded Gems from Detroit , Michigan , then renamed and moved the team. It was in Minneapolis where the Lakers got its official title from the Minnesota's nickname, Land of 10,000 Lakes. 2 The Lakers won five championships before relocating to Los Angeles in the 1960–61 NBA season . The Lakers went on to lose all of their eight appearances in the NBA Finals in the 1960s, despite having help from Elgin Baylor and Jerry West . In , the Lakers compiled a 33-game winning streak , the longest streak in U.S. professional team sports , and won their sixth title under coach Bill Sharman . 3 The Lakers' popularity soared in the 1980s when they won five additional championships during a nine-year span with the help of Hall of Famers  Magic Johnson , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , James Worthy and coach Pat Riley , the franchise's all-time leader in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins. 4 5 Two of those championships during that span were against their arch-rivals , the Boston Celtics . With the help of Shaquille O'Neal , Kobe Bryant , and Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson , the Lakers played in seven NBA Finals between 2000 and 2010, winning three of them consecutively from 2000 to 2002 , losing the next two in 2004 and 2008 , and winning in 2009 and 2010 ; the last three appearances were without O'Neal.  The Lakers hold records for having (at the end of the 2014–15 NBA season ) the most wins (3,125), the highest winning percentage (.620), the most NBA Finals appearances (31) of any NBA franchise, second for the least non-playoff seasons with 7 and are second NBA championships with 16, behind the Boston Celtics' 17. 6  Table key  (Figure)  Jerry West played in nine of the Lakers' thirty one NBA Finals appearances, from 1962 to 1973 .|alt=head shot of Jerry West       AMVP   All-Star Game Most Valuable Player     COY   Coach of the Year     DPOY   Defensive Player of the Year     Finish   Final position in league or division standings     GB   Games behind first-place team in division{{#tag:ref|The formula is as followed      Games   behind   =     (     TeamA  ′    s   wins   -    TeamB  ′    s   wins    )   +   (     TeamB  ′    s   losses   -    TeamA  ′    s   losses    )    2         Games  behind            superscript  TeamA  normal-′   normal-s  wins      superscript  TeamB  normal-′   normal-s  wins         superscript  TeamB  normal-′   normal-s  losses      superscript  TeamA  normal-′   normal-s  losses     2     \mathrm{Games}\ \mathrm{behind}=\frac{(\mathrm{TeamA^{\prime}s}\ \mathrm{wins}%
