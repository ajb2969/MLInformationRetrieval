   Adjoint bundle      Adjoint bundle   In mathematics , an adjoint bundle  1  2 is a vector bundle naturally associated to any principal bundle . The fibers of the adjoint bundle carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint bundle into a (nonassociative) algebra bundle . Adjoint bundles have important applications in the theory of connections as well as in gauge theory .  Formal definition  Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , and let P be a principal G -bundle over a smooth manifold  M . Let      Ad  :   G  →   Aut   (  𝔤  )    \sub   GL   (  𝔤  )        normal-:  Ad   normal-→  G    Aut  𝔤  \sub  GL  𝔤      \mathrm{Ad}:G\to\mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{g})\sub\mathrm{GL}(\mathfrak{g})   be the adjoint representation of G . The adjoint bundle of P is the associated bundle       ad  P   =   P   ×  Ad   𝔤         ad  P     superscript   Ad   P  𝔤     \mathrm{ad}P=P\times^{\mathrm{Ad}}\mathfrak{g}   The adjoint bundle is also commonly denoted by    𝔤  P     subscript  𝔤  P    \mathfrak{g}_{P}   . Explicitly, elements of the adjoint bundle are equivalence classes of pairs [ p , x ] for p ∈ P and x ∈   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   such that       [   p  ⋅  g   ,  x  ]   =   [  p  ,    Ad   g   -  1      (  x  )    ]         normal-⋅  p  g   x    p     subscript  Ad   superscript  g    1     x      [p\cdot g,x]=[p,\mathrm{Ad}_{g^{-1}}(x)]   for all g ∈ G . Since the structure group of the adjoint bundle consists of Lie algebra automorphisms , the fibers naturally carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint bundle into a bundle of Lie algebras over M .  Properties  Differential forms on M with values in    ad  P      ad  P    \mathrm{ad}P   are in one-to-one correspondence with horizontal, G -equivariant  Lie algebra-valued forms on P . A prime example is the curvature of any connection on P which may be regarded as a 2-form on M with values in    ad  P      ad  P    \mathrm{ad}P   .  The space of sections of the adjoint bundle is naturally an (infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra. It may be regarded as the Lie algebra of the infinite-dimensional Lie group of gauge transformations of P which can be thought of as sections of the bundle P × Ψ  G where Ψ is the action of G on itself by conjugation .
