Adjoint bundle

In mathematics, an adjoint bundle 1 2 is a vector bundle naturally associated to any principal bundle. The fibers of the adjoint bundle carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint bundle into a (nonassociative) algebra bundle. Adjoint bundles have important applications in the theory of connections as well as in gauge theory.
Formal definition
Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra

 
 , and let P be a principal G-bundle over a smooth manifold M. Let


 
  be the adjoint representation of G. The adjoint bundle of P is the associated bundle


 
  The adjoint bundle is also commonly denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Explicitly, elements of the adjoint bundle are equivalence classes of pairs [p, x] for p ∈ P and x ∈ 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  for all g ∈ G. Since the structure group of the adjoint bundle consists of Lie algebra automorphisms, the fibers naturally carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint bundle into a bundle of Lie algebras over M.
Properties
Differential forms on M with values in 
 
 
 
  are in one-to-one correspondence with horizontal, G-equivariant Lie algebra-valued forms on P. A prime example is the curvature of any connection on P which may be regarded as a 2-form on M with values in 
 
 
 
 .
The space of sections of the adjoint bundle is naturally an (infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra. It may be regarded as the Lie algebra of the infinite-dimensional Lie group of gauge transformations of P which can be thought of as sections of the bundle P ×Ψ G where Ψ is the action of G on itself by conjugation.
