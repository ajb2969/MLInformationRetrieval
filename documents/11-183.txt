Casbene synthase

In enzymology, a casbene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

geranylgeranyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  casbene + diphosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and two products, casbene and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranylgeranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, casbene-forming). Other names in common use include casbene synthetase, and geranylgeranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing). This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis.
