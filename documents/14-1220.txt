Products in algebraic topology

In algebraic topology, several types of products are defined on homological and cohomological theories.
The cross product



The cap product



The slant product



The cup product



This product can be understood as induced by the exterior product of differential forms in de Rham cohomology. It makes the singular cohomology of a connected manifold into a unitary supercommutative ring.
