   Support function      Support function   In mathematics , the support function  h A of a non-empty closed  convex set  A in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   describes the (signed) distances of supporting hyperplanes of A from the origin. The support function is a convex function on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . Any non-empty closed convex set A is uniquely determined by h A . Furthermore the support function, as a function of the set A is compatible with many natural geometric operations, like scaling, translation, rotation and Minkowski addition . Due to these properties, the support function is one of the most central basic concepts in convex geometry.  Definition  The support function     h  A   :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:   subscript  h  A    normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     h_{A}\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}   of a non-empty closed convex set A in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   is given by         h  A    (  x  )    =   sup   {   x  ⋅  a   :   a  ∈  A   }     ,         subscript  h  A   x    supremum   conditional-set   normal-⋅  x  a     a  A       h_{A}(x)=\sup\{x\cdot a:a\in A\},       x  ∈   ℝ  n       x   superscript  ℝ  n     x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   ; see 1  2 . 3 Its interpretation is most intuitive when x is a unit vector: by definition, A is contained in the closed half space      {   y  ∈   ℝ  n    :    y  ⋅  x   ⩽    h  A    (  x  )     }     conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ  n       normal-⋅  y  x      subscript  h  A   x      \{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:y\cdot x\leqslant h_{A}(x)\}   and there is at least one point of A in the boundary       H   (  x  )    =   {   y  ∈   ℝ  n    :    y  ⋅  x   =    h  A    (  x  )     }         H  x    conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ  n       normal-⋅  y  x      subscript  h  A   x       H(x)=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:y\cdot x=h_{A}(x)\}   of this half space. The hyperplane H ( x ) is therefore called a supporting hyperplane with exterior (or outer ) unit normal vector x . The word exterior is important here, as the orientation of x plays a role, the set H ( x ) is in general different from H (- x ). Now h A is the (signed) distance of H ( x ) from the origin.  Examples  The support function of a singleton A ={ a } is      h  A    (  x  )    =   x  ⋅  a          subscript  h  A   x    normal-⋅  x  a     h_{A}(x)=x\cdot a   .  The support function of the Euclidean unit ball B 1 is      h   B  1     (  x  )    =   |  x  |          subscript  h   subscript  B  1    x     x     h_{B_{1}}(x)=|x|   .  If A is a line segment through the origin with endpoints - a and a then      h  A    (  x  )    =   |   x  ⋅  a   |          subscript  h  A   x      normal-⋅  x  a      h_{A}(x)=|x\cdot a|   .  Properties  As a function of x  The support function of a compact convex set is real valued and continuous, but if the set is unbounded, its support function is extended real valued (it takes the value   ∞     \infty   ). As any nonempty closed convex set is the intersection of its supporting half spaces, the function h A determines A uniquely. This can be used to describe certain geometric properties of convex sets analytically. For instance, a set A is point symmetric with respect to the origin if and only h A is an even function .  In general, the support function is not differentiable. However, directional derivatives exist and yield support functions of support sets. If A is compact and convex, and h A '( u ; x ) denotes the directional derivative of h A at u ≠ 0 in direction x , we have          h  A  ′    (  u  ;  x  )    =    h   A  ∩   H   (  u  )       (  x  )      x  ∈   ℝ  n     .     formulae-sequence       superscript   subscript  h  A   normal-′    u  x       subscript  h    A    H  u     x      x   superscript  ℝ  n      h_{A}^{\prime}(u;x)=h_{A\cap H(u)}(x)\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}.   Here H ( u ) is the supporting hyperplane of A with exterior normal vector u , defined above. If A ∩ H ( u ) is a sinlgeton { y }, say, it follows that the support function is differentable at u and its gradient coincides with y . Conversely, if h A is differentiable at u , then A ∩ H ( u ) is a sinlgeton. Hence h A is differentable at all points u ≠ 0 if and only if A is strictly convex (the boundary of A does not contain any line segments).  It follows directly from its definition that the support function is positive homogeneous:          h  A    (   α  x   )    =   α   h  A    (  x  )     ,    α  ≥  0   ,   x  ∈   ℝ  n      ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  h  A     α  x      α   subscript  h  A   x     formulae-sequence    α  0     x   superscript  ℝ  n       h_{A}(\alpha x)=\alpha h_{A}(x),\qquad\alpha\geq 0,x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},   and subadditive:          h  A    (   x  +  y   )    ≤      h  A    (  x  )    +    h  A    (  y  )     ,  x    ,   y  ∈   ℝ  n     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  h  A     x  y          subscript  h  A   x      subscript  h  A   y    x      y   superscript  ℝ  n      h_{A}(x+y)\leq h_{A}(x)+h_{A}(y),\qquad x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}.   It follows that h A is a convex function . It is crucial in convex geometry that these properties characterize support functions: Any positive homogeneous, convex, real valued function on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   is the support function of a nonempty compact convex set. Several proofs are known , 4 one is using the fact that the Legendre transform of a positive homogeneous, convex, real valued function is the (convex) indicator function of a compact convex set.  Many authors restrict the support function to the Euclidean unit sphere and consider it as a function on S n -1 . The homogeneity property shows that this restriction determines the support function on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , as defined above.  As a function of A  The support functions of a dilated or translated set are closely related to the original set A :         h   α  A     (  x  )    =   α   h  A    (  x  )     ,    α  ≥  0   ,   x  ∈   ℝ  n        formulae-sequence       subscript  h    α  A    x     α   subscript  h  A   x     formulae-sequence    α  0     x   superscript  ℝ  n       h_{\alpha A}(x)=\alpha h_{A}(x),\qquad\alpha\geq 0,x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   and          h   A  +  b     (  x  )    =      h  A    (  x  )    +   x  ⋅  b    ,  x    ,   b  ∈   ℝ  n     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  h    A  b    x         subscript  h  A   x    normal-⋅  x  b    x      b   superscript  ℝ  n      h_{A+b}(x)=h_{A}(x)+x\cdot b,\qquad x,b\in\mathbb{R}^{n}.   The latter generalises to          h   A  +  B     (  x  )    =     h  A    (  x  )    +    h  B    (  x  )      ,   x  ∈   ℝ  n     ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  h    A  B    x        subscript  h  A   x      subscript  h  B   x       x   superscript  ℝ  n      h_{A+B}(x)=h_{A}(x)+h_{B}(x),\qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},   where A + B denotes the Minkowski sum :        A  +  B   :=   {    a  +  b   ∈   ℝ  n    ∣    a  ∈  A   ,   b  ∈   B     }    .     assign    A  B    conditional-set      a  b    superscript  ℝ  n     formulae-sequence    a  A     b  B       A+B:=\{\,a+b\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\mid a\in A,\ b\in B\,\}.   The Hausdorff distance  of two nonempty compact convex sets A and B can be expressed in terms of support functions,        d  H    (  A  ,  B  )    =    ∥    h  A   -   h  B    ∥   ∞          subscript  d  normal-H    A  B     subscript   norm     subscript  h  A    subscript  h  B         d_{\mathrm{H}}(A,B)=\|h_{A}-h_{B}\|_{\infty}   where, on the right hand side, the uniform norm on the unit sphere is used.  The properties of the support function as a function of the set A are sometimes summarized in saying that   τ   τ   \tau   : A    ↦   maps-to   \mapsto    h  A maps the family of non-empty compact convex sets to the cone of all real-valued continuous functions on the sphere whose positive homogeneous extension is convex. Abusing terminology slightly,   τ   τ   \tau   is sometimes called linear , as it respects Minkowski addition, although it is not defined on a linear space, but rather on an (abstract) convex cone of nonempty compact convex sets. The mapping   τ   τ   \tau   is an isometry between this cone, endowed with the Hausdorff metric, and a subcone of the family of continuous functions on S n -1 with the uniform norm.  Variants  In contrast to the above, support functions are sometimes defined on the boundary of A rather than on S n -1 , under the assumption that there exists a unique exterior unit normal at each boundary point. Convexity is not needed for the definition. For an oriented regular surface , M , with a unit normal vector , N , defined everywhere on its surface, the support function is then defined by      x  ↦    x  ⋅  N    (  x  )       maps-to  x     normal-⋅  x  N   x     {x}\mapsto{x}\cdot N({x})   . In other words, for any    x  ∈  M      x  M    {x}\in M   , this support function gives the signed distance of the unique hyperplane that touches M in x .
