Matrix analytic method

In probability theory, the matrix analytic method is a technique to compute the stationary probability distribution of a Markov chain which has a repeating structure (after some point) and a state space which grows unboundedly in no more than one dimension.12 Such models are often described as M/G/1 type Markov chains because they can describe transitions in an M/G/1 queue.34 The method is a more complicated version of the matrix geometric method and is the classical solution method for M/G/1 chains.5
Method description
An M/G/1-type stochastic matrix is one of the form6






B_0 & B_1 & B_2 & B_3 & \cdots \\ A_0 & A_1 & A_2 & A_3 & \cdots \\
      & A_0    & A_1    & A_2    & \cdots \\
      &        & A_0    & A_1    & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \end{pmatrix}
where Bi and Ai are k × k matrices. (Note that unmarked matrix entries represent zeroes.) Such a matrix describes the embedded Markov chain in an M/G/1 queue.78 If P is irreducible and positive recurrent then the stationary distribution is given by the solution to the equations9








where e represents a vector of suitable dimension with all values equal to 1. Matching the structure of P, π is partitioned to π1, π2, π3, …. To compute these probabilities the column stochastic matrix G is computed such that10








G is called the auxiliary matrix.11 Matrices are defined12






\overline{A}_{i+1} &= \sum_{j=i+1}^\infty G^{j-i-1}A_j \\ \overline{B}_i &= \sum_{j=i}^\infty G^{j-i}B_j \end{align}
then π0 is found by solving13






\overline{B}_0 \pi_0 &= \pi_0\\
\quad \left(\mathbf e^{\text{T}} + \mathbf e^{\text{T}}\left(I - \sum_{i=1}^\infty \overline{A}_i\right)^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^\infty \overline{B}_i\right) \pi_0 &= 1
\end{align}
and the πi are given by Ramaswami's formula,14 a numerically stable relationship first published by Vaidyanathan Ramaswami in 1988.15








Computation of G
There are two popular iterative methods for computing G,1617
