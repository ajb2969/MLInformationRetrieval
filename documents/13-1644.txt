Design effect
In [[statistics]], the '''design effect''' (or '''estimates of unit variance''') is an adjustment used in some kinds of studies, such as [[cluster randomised trial]]s, to allow for the design structure. The adjustment inflates the [[variance]] of parameter estimates, and therefore their [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]]s, which is necessary to allow for [[correlation]]s among [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] of observations.{{cite journal|url=http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/14/6/521 |title=Design  effects and intraclass correlation coefficients from a health facility cluster survey in Benin|author=Alexander K.

Definition
For a cluster randomised trial with m observations in each cluster and intra-cluster correlation of 
 
 
 
 , the design effect. Deff, is given by:4



Formally, the design effect is the ratio of two theoretical variances for an estimator:56
:*the actual variance for a given sampling design;
:*the variance assuming the same sample size, but using simple random sampling without replacement.
