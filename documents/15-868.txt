Long-chain acyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase

Long-chain acyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (, long-chain acyl-[acp] reductase, fatty acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase, acyl-[acp] reductase) is an enzyme with system name long-chain-aldehyde:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (acyl-(acyl-carrier protein)-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

a long-chain aldehyde + acyl-carrier protein + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  a long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + NAD(P)H + H+


This enzyme catalyses the reaction in the opposite direction.
