Sight reduction

Sight reduction, is the process of deriving from a sight the information needed for establishing a line of position.
Sight is defined as the observation of the altitude, and sometimes also the azimuth, of a celestial body for a line of position; or the data obtained by such observation.1
Nowadays sight reduction uses the equation of the circle of equal altitude to calculate the altitude of the celestial body,



and the azimuth Zn is obtained from Z by:



With the observed altitude Ho, Hc and Zn are the parameters of the Marcq St Hilaire intercept for the line of position:
 
With B the latitude (+ N / S), L the longitude (+ E / -W). LHA = GHA + L is the local hour angle, Dec and GHA are the declination and Greenwich hour angle of the star observed. And Hc is the calculated altitude. Z is the calculated azimuth of the body.
Basic procedures involved computer sight reduction or longhand tabular methods.

Longhand Haversine Sight Reduction
This method is a practical procedure to reduce celestial sights with the needed accuracy, without using electronic tools such as calculator or a computer. And it could serve as a backup in case of malfunction of the positioning system aboard.
Doniol
The first approach of a compact and concise method was published by R. Doniol in 19552 The altitude is derived from Sin Hc = n - a(m+n), in wich n = Cos(B-Dec), m = Cos(B+Dec), a = haversine(LHA)
The calulation is:
n = Cos(B-Dec)
m = Cos(B+Dec)
a = haversine(LHA)
sin_Hc = n - a(m+n)
Hc = asin(sin_Hc)

Haversine Sight Reduction algorithm

A practical and friendly method using haversines was developed between 2014 and 2015,3 and published in NavList.
A compact expression for the altitude was derived4 using haversines, hv, for all the terms of the equation:
hv(ZD) = hv(B-Dec) + [ 1 - hv(B-Dec) - hv(B+Dec) ]* hv(LHA)
where ZD is the zenith distance
Hc = (90 - ZD) the calculated altitude
The algorithm if absolute values are used is:
if same name for latitude and declination
 n = hv(|B| - |Dec|)
 m = hv(|B| + |Dec|)
if contrary name
 n = hv(|B| + |Dec|)
 m = hv(|B| - |Dec|)
q = n + m
a = hv(LHA)
hv(ZD) = n+(1-q)*a
ZD = inverse hv -> look at the haversine tables
Hc = 90º - ZD
For the azimut a diagram5 was developed for a faster solution without calculation, and with an accuracy of 1º.  This diagram could be used also for star identification.6
An ambiguity in the value of azimuth may arise since in the diagram 0 Azimuth haversine formula by Lars Bergman http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-Bergman-nov-2014-g29441 should be used.
hv(Z) = [hv(90º-Dec) - hv(B-Hc)]/[ 1 - hv(B-Hc) - hv(B+Hc)]
The algorithm if absolute values are used is:
if same name
 a = hv(90º-|Dec|)
if contrary name
 a = hv(90º+|Dec|)
m = hv(B+Hc)
n = hv(B-Hc)
q = n + m
hv(Z) = (a-n)/(1-q)
Z = inverse hv -> look at the haversine tables
if Latitude N:
 if LHA> 180◦, Zn = Z
 if LHA 180◦, Zn = 180◦ − Z
 if LHAhttp://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-HannoIx-nov-2014-g29172
An example
Data:
 B = 34º 10.0' N (+)
 Dec = 21º 11.0' S (-)
 LHA = 302º 43.0'
Altitude Hc:
 a = 0.2298
 m = 0.0128
 n = 0.2157
 hv(ZD) = 0.3930 -> table ->
 ZD = 77º 39'
 Hc  = 12º 21'
Azimuth Zn:
 a = 0.6807
 m = 0.1560
 n = 0.0358
 hv(Z) = 0.7979
