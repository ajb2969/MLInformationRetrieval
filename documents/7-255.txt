Chien search

In abstract algebra, the Chien search, named after Robert T. Chien, is a fast algorithm for determining roots of polynomials defined over a finite field. The most typical use of the Chien search is in finding the roots of error-locator polynomials encountered in decoding Reed-Solomon codes and BCH codes.
Algorithm
We denote the polynomial (over the finite field GF(
 
 
 
 )) whose roots we wish to determine as:



Conceptually, we may evaluate 
 
 
 
  for each non-zero 
 
 
 
  in GF(
 
 
 
 ). Those resulting in 0 are roots of the polynomial.
The Chien search is based on two observations:

Each non-zero 
 
 
 
  may be expressed as 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a primitive element of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the power number of primitive element 
 
 
 
 . Thus the powers 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  cover the entire field (excluding the zero element).


The following relationship exists:







In other words, we may define each 
 
 
 
  as the sum of a set of terms 
 
 
 
 , from which the next set of coefficients may be derived thus:



In this way, we may start at 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , and iterate through each value of 
 
 
 
  up to 
 
 
 
 . If at any stage the resultant summation is zero, i.e.



then 
 
 
 
  also, so 
 
 
 
  is a root. In this way, we check every element in the field.
When implemented in hardware, this approach significantly reduces the complexity, as all multiplications consist of one variable and one constant, rather than two variables as in the brute-force approach.
