End (category theory)

In category theory, an end of a functor 
 
 
 
  is a universal extranatural transformation from an object e of X to S.
More explicitly, this is a pair 
 
 
 
 
 , where e is an object of X and



is a extranatural transformation such that for every extranatural transformation



there exists a unique morphism



of X with



for every object a of C.
By abuse of language the object e is often called the end of the functor S (forgetting 
 
 
 
 
 ) and is written



Characterization as limit: If X is complete, the end can be described as the equaliser in the diagram



where the first morphism is induced by 
 
 
 
  and the second morphism is induced by 
 
 
 
 .
Coend
The definition of the coend of a functor 
 
 
 
 
  is the dual of the definition of an end.
Thus, a coend of S consists of a pair 
 
 
 
 , where d is an object of X and



is a extranatural transformation, such that for every extranatural transformation



there exists a unique morphism



of X with



for every object a of C.
The coend d of the functor S is written



Characterization as colimit: Dually, if X is cocomplete, then the coend can be described as the coequalizer in the diagram



Examples

Natural transformations:

Suppose we have functors 
 
 
 
  then


 
 .
In this case, the category of sets is complete, so we need only form the equalizer and in this case



the natural transformations from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Intuitively, a natural transformation from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is a morphism from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
  in the category with compatibility conditions. Looking at the equalizer diagram defining the end makes the equivalence clear.

Geometric realizations:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a simplicial set. That is, 
 
 
 
  is a functor 
 
 
 
 
 . The discrete topology gives a functor 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the category of topological spaces. Moreover, there is a map 
 
 
 
  which sends the object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  to the standard 
 
 
 
  simplex inside 
 
 
 
 . Finally there is a functor 
 
 
 
  which takes the product of two topological spaces.
Define 
 
 
 
  to be the composition of this product functor with 
 
 
 
 
 . The coend of 
 
 
 
  is the geometric realization of 
 
 
 
 .
