   Zeatin reductase      Zeatin reductase   In enzymology , a zeatin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dihydrozeatin + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   zeatin + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dihydrozeatin and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are zeatin , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydrozeatin:NADP+ oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.3.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
