Diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinase

In enzymology, a diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 1D-myo-inositol 5-diphosphate pentakisphosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1D-myo-inositol bisdiphosphate tetrakisphosphate (isomeric configuration unknown)
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1D-myo-inositol 5-diphosphate pentakisphosphate, whereas its 3 products are ADP, 1D-myo-inositol bisdiphosphate tetrakisphosphate and (isomeric configuration unknown).
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1D-myo-inositol-5-diphosphate-pentakisphosphate phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include PP-IP5 kinase, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase, and ATP:5-diphospho-1D-myo-inositol-pentakisphosphate phosphotransferase.
