   Uniform limit theorem      Uniform limit theorem   (Figure)  Counterexample to a strengthening of the uniform limit theorem, in which pointwise convergence, rather than uniform convergence, is assumed. The continuous green functions     sin  n    (  x  )       superscript   n   x    \scriptstyle\scriptstyle\sin^{n}(x)   converge to the non-continuous red function. This can happen only if convergence is not uniform.   In mathematics , the uniform limit theorem states that the uniform limit of any sequence of continuous functions is continuous.  Statement  More precisely, let X be a topological space , let Y be a metric space , and let ƒ n : X → Y be a sequence of functions converging uniformly to a function ƒ : X → Y . According to the uniform limit theorem, if each of the functions ƒ n is continuous, then the limit ƒ must be continuous as well.  This theorem does not hold if uniform convergence is replaced by pointwise convergence . For example, let ƒ n : [0, 1] → R be the sequence of functions ƒ n ( x ) = x n . Then each function ƒ n is continuous, but the sequence converges pointwise to the discontinuous function ƒ that is zero on [0, 1) but has ƒ(1) = 1. Another example is shown in the image to the right.  In terms of function spaces , the uniform limit theorem says that the space C ( X , Y ) of all continuous functions from a topological space X to a metric space Y is a closed subset of Y X under the uniform metric . In the case where Y is complete , it follows that C ( X , Y ) is itself a complete metric space. In particular, if Y is a Banach space , then C ( X , Y ) is itself a Banach space under the uniform norm .  The uniform limit theorem also holds if continuity is replaced by uniform continuity . That is, if X and Y are metric spaces and ƒ n : X → Y is a sequence of uniformly continuous functions converging uniformly to a function ƒ, then ƒ must be uniformly continuous.  Proof  In order to prove the continuity of f 0 , we have to show that for every ε > 0, there exists a neighbourhood  U of any point x of X such that:         d  Y    (    f  0    (  x  )    ,    f  0    (  y  )    )    <  ϵ   ,    ∀  y   ∈  U      formulae-sequence       subscript  d  Y       subscript  f  0   x      subscript  f  0   y     ϵ      for-all  y   U     d_{Y}(f_{0}(x),f_{0}(y))<\epsilon,\qquad\forall y\in U     Let us consider an arbitrary ε > 0. Since the sequence of functions { f n } converges uniformly to f by hypothesis, there exists a natural number N such that:         d  Y    (    f  N    (  t  )    ,    f  0    (  t  )    )    <   ϵ  3    ,    ∀  t   ∈  X      formulae-sequence       subscript  d  Y       subscript  f  N   t      subscript  f  0   t       ϵ  3       for-all  t   X     d_{Y}(f_{N}(t),f_{0}(t))<\frac{\epsilon}{3},\qquad\forall t\in X     Moreover, since f N is continuous on X by hypothesis, for every x there exists a neighbourhood U such that:         d  Y    (    f  N    (  x  )    ,    f  N    (  y  )    )    <   ϵ  3    ,    ∀  y   ∈  U      formulae-sequence       subscript  d  Y       subscript  f  N   x      subscript  f  N   y       ϵ  3       for-all  y   U     d_{Y}(f_{N}(x),f_{N}(y))<\frac{\epsilon}{3},\qquad\forall y\in U     In the final step, we apply the triangle inequality in the following way:       d  Y    (    f  0    (  x  )    ,    f  0    (  y  )    )        subscript  d  Y       subscript  f  0   x      subscript  f  0   y      \displaystyle d_{Y}(f_{0}(x),f_{0}(y))     Hence, we have shown that the first inequality in the proof holds, so by definition f is continuous everywhere on X .
