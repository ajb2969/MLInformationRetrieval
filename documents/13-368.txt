Simulation algorithms for atomic DEVS

Given an atomic DEVS model, simulation algorithms are methods to generate the model's legal behaviors which are trajectories not to reach to illegal states. (see Behavior of DEVS). [Zeigler84] originally introduced the algorithms that handle time variables related to lifespan

 
  and elapsed time

 
  by introducing two other time variables, last event time, 
 
 
 
 , and next event time

 
 
  with the following relations:





and





where 
 
 
 
  denotes the current time. And the remaining time,





is equivalently computed as





, apparently 
 
 
 
 .
Since the behavior of a given atomic DEVS model can be defined in two different views depending on the total state and the external transition function (refer to Behavior of DEVS), the simulation algorithms are also introduced in two different views as below.
Common parts
Regardless of two different views of total states, algorithms for initialization and internal transition cases are commonly defined as below.

    parent // parent coordinator

== View 1: total states = states * elapsed times == As addressed in Behavior of Atomic DEVS, when DEVS receives an input event, right calling 
 
 
 
 
 , the last event time,
 
 
 
  is set by the current time,
 
 
 
 , thus the elapsed time
 
 
 
  becomes zero because

==View 2: total states = states * lifespans * elapsed times== Notice that as addressed in Behavior of Atomic DEVS, depending on the value of

 ,consequently, elapsed time,

 , are updated (if 
 
 
 
 ) or preserved (if 
 
 
 
 ).
