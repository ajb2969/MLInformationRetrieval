Theta Centauri

Theta Centauri (θ Cen, θ Centauri) is a star in the southern constellation of Centaurus, the centaur. It has the traditional Arabic name Menkent (possibly abbreviation of ألمنكب ألقنتوس - al mankib al-qanturis, meaning "shoulder of the Centaur"). This star has an apparent visual magnitude of +2.06,1 making it the fourth brightest member of the constellation. This star is close enough to the Earth that its distance can be measured using the parallax technique, yielding a value of .2
In Chinese,  (), meaning Arsenal, refers to an asterism consisting of θ Centauri, ζ Centauri, η Centauri, 2 Centauri, HD 117440, ξ1 Centauri, γ Centauri, τ Centauri, D Centauri and σ Centauri.3 Consequently, θ Centauri itself is known as  (, .)4
This is an evolved giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III.5 The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is ,6 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 10.6 times the radius of the Sun.7 The outer envelope has an effective temperature of 4,980 K,8 giving it the orange-hued glow of a cool, K-type star.9 Soft X-ray emission has been detected from this star, which has an estimated X-ray luminosity of .10
