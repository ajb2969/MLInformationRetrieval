   Rademacher–Menchov theorem      Rademacher–Menchov theorem   In mathematical analysis , the Rademacher–Menchov theorem , introduced by  and , gives a sufficient condition for a series of orthogonal functions on an interval to converge almost everywhere .  Statement  If the coefficients c ν of a series of bounded orthogonal functions on an interval satisfy      ∑  |   c  ν    |  2   log    (  ν  )   2   <  ∞     fragments   normal-|   subscript  c  ν    superscript  normal-|  2     superscript   fragments  normal-(  ν  normal-)   2       \sum|c_{\nu}|^{2}\log(\nu)^{2}<\infty   then the series converges almost everywhere.
