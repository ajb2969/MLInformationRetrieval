Typical subspace

In quantum information theory, the idea of a typical subspace plays an important role in the proofs of many coding theorems (the most prominent example being Schumacher compression). Its role is analogous to that of the typical set in classical information theory.
Unconditional Quantum Typicality
Consider a density operator

 
  with the following spectral decomposition:


 
  The weakly typical subspace is defined as the span of all vectors such that the sample entropy 
 
 
 
  of their classical label is close to the true entropy

 
  of the distribution

 
 :


 
  where





 
  The projector

 
  onto the typical subspace of 
 
 
 
  is defined as


 
  where we have "overloaded" the symbol 
 
 
 
  to refer also to the set of 
 
 
 
 -typical sequences:


 
  The three important properties of the typical projector are as follows:








 
  where the first property holds for arbitrary 
 
 
 
  and sufficiently large 
 
 
 
 .
Conditional Quantum Typicality
Consider an ensemble 
 
 
 
  of states. Suppose that each state 
 
 
 
  has the following spectral decomposition:


 
  Consider a density operator

 
  which is conditional on a classical sequence 
 
 
 
 :


 
  We define the weak conditionally typical subspace as the span of vectors (conditional on the sequence 
 
 
 
 ) such that the sample conditional entropy 
 
 
 
 
  of their classical labels is close to the true conditional entropy

 
  of the distribution

 
 :


 
  where





 
  The projector

 
  onto the weak conditionally typical subspace of 
 
 
 
  is as follows:


 
  where we have again overloaded the symbol 
 
 
 
 
  to refer to the set of weak conditionally typical sequences:


 
  The three important properties of the weak conditionally typical projector are as follows:








 
  where the first property holds for arbitrary 
 
 
 
  and sufficiently large 
 
 
 
 , and the expectation is with respect to the distribution 
 
 
 
 .
