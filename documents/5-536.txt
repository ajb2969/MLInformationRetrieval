   Unbounded operator      Unbounded operator   In mathematics , more specifically functional analysis and operator theory , the notion of unbounded operator provides an abstract framework for dealing with differential operators , unbounded observables in quantum mechanics, and other cases.  The term "unbounded operator" can be misleading, since   "unbounded" should sometimes be understood as "not necessarily bounded";  "operator" should be understood as " linear operator " (as in the case of "bounded operator");  the domain of the operator is a linear subspace, not necessarily the whole space;  this linear subspace is not necessarily closed; often (but not always) it is assumed to be dense;  in the special case of a bounded operator, still, the domain is usually assumed to be the whole space.   In contrast to bounded operators , unbounded operators on a given space do not form an algebra, nor even a linear space, because each one is defined on its own domain.  The term "operator" often means "bounded linear operator", but in the context of this article it means "unbounded operator", with the reservations made above. The given space is assumed to be a Hilbert space . Some generalizations to Banach spaces and more general topological vector spaces are possible.  Short history  The theory of unbounded operators developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of developing a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics . 1 The theory's development is due to John von Neumann 2 and Marshall Stone . 3 Von Neumann introduced using graphs to analyze unbounded operators in 1936. 4  Definitions and basic properties  Let    X  ,  Y     X  Y    X,Y   be Banach spaces . An unbounded operator (or simply operator )    T  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  T    X  normal-→  Y     T:X→Y   is a linear map    T   T   T   from a linear subspace    D   (  T  )   ⊆  X      D  T  normal-⊆  X    D(T)⊆X   — the domain of   T   T   T   — to the space   Y   Y   Y   . 5 Contrary to the usual convention,   T   T   T   may not be defined on the whole space   X   X   X   . Two operators are equal if they have a common domain and they coincide on that common domain. 6  An operator   T   T   T   is said to be closed if its graph     Γ   (  T  )       normal-Γ  T    Γ(T)   is a closed set . 7 (Here, the graph    Γ   (  T  )       normal-Γ  T    Γ(T)   is a linear subspace of the direct sum     X  ⊕  Y      X  normal-⊕  Y    X⊕Y   , defined as the set of all pairs    (  x  ,   T  x   )     x    T  x     (x,Tx)   , where   x   x   x   runs over the domain of   T   T   T   ). Explicitly, this means that for every sequence  of points from the domain of   T   T   T   such that and , it holds that   x   x   x   belongs to the domain of   T   T   T   and     T  x   =  y        T  x   y    Tx=y   . 8 The closedness can also be formulated in terms of the graph norm : an operator   T   T   T   is closed if and only if its domain    D   (  T  )       D  T    D(T)   is a complete space with respect to the norm: 9         ∥  x  ∥   T   =      ∥  x  ∥   2   +    ∥   T  x   ∥   2      .       subscript   norm  x   T        superscript   norm  x   2    superscript   norm    T  x    2       \|x\|_{T}=\sqrt{\|x\|^{2}+\|Tx\|^{2}}.     An operator   T   T   T   is said to be densely defined if its domain is dense in   X   X   X   . 10 This also includes operators defined on the entire space   X   X   X   , since the whole space is dense in itself. The denseness of the domain is necessary and sufficient for the existence of the adjoint and the transpose; see the next section.  If    T  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  T    X  normal-→  Y     T:X→Y   is closed, densely defined and continuous on its domain, then its domain is all of   X   X   X   . 11  A densely defined operator   T   T   T   on a Hilbert space    H   H   H   is called bounded from below if    T  +  a      T  a    T+a   is a positive operator for some real number   a   a   a   . That is, x ⟩ ≥ − a {{!!}} x {{!!}} 2 }} for all   x   x   x   in the domain of   T   T   T   . 12 If both   T   T   T   and    −  T      normal-−  T    −T   are bounded from below then   T   T   T   is bounded. 13  Example  Let    C   (  0  ,  11  )   )     fragments  C   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-,  11  normal-)   normal-)    C(0,11))   denote the space of continuous functions on the interval, and let denote the space of continuously differentiable functions. Define the classical differentiation operator by the usual formula:          (    d   d  x    f   )    (  x  )    =    lim   h  →  0       f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )     h     ,    ∀  x   ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     .     formulae-sequence          d    d  x    f   x     subscript    normal-→  h  0          f    x  h      f  x    h        for-all  x    0  1      \left(\frac{d}{dx}f\right)(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},\qquad\forall
 x%
 \in[0,1].     Every differentiable function is continuous, so . Consequently,     d   d  x    :  C   (  0  ,  11  )   →  C   (  0  ,  11  )   )     fragments    d    d  x    normal-:  C   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-,  11  normal-)   →  C   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-,  11  normal-)   normal-)    \frac{d}{dx}:C(0,11)→C(0,11))   is a well-defined unbounded operator, with domain .  This is a linear operator, since a linear combination     a   f   +   b  g         a  normal-  f     b  g     a f+bg   of two continuously differentiable functions    f  ,  g     f  g    f,g   is also continuously differentiable, and         (    d   d  x     )    (    a  f   +   b  g    )    =    a   (     d   d  x     f   )    +   b   (     d   d  x     g   )      .          d    d  x        a  f     b  g         a      d    d  x    f      b      d    d  x    g       \left(\tfrac{d}{dx}\right)(af+bg)=a\left(\tfrac{d}{dx}f\right)+b\left(\tfrac{d%
 }{dx}g\right).     The operator is not bounded. For example,      {       f  n   :    [  0  ,  1  ]   →   [   -  1   ,  1  ]             f  n    (  x  )    =   sin   (   2  π  n  x   )            cases   normal-:   subscript  f  n    normal-→   0  1      1   1     otherwise       subscript  f  n   x       2  π  n  x     otherwise    \begin{cases}f_{n}:[0,1]\to[-1,1]\\
 f_{n}(x)=\sin(2\pi nx)\end{cases}     satisfy         ∥   f  n   ∥   2   =   1   2     ,       subscript   norm   subscript  f  n    2     1    2      \left\|f_{n}\right\|_{2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},     but         ∥   (     d   d  x      f  n    )   ∥   2   =    2  π  n    2    →  ∞   .         subscript   norm      d    d  x     subscript  f  n     2       2  π  n     2      normal-→        \left\|\left(\tfrac{d}{dx}f_{n}\right)\right\|_{2}=\frac{2\pi n}{\sqrt{2}}\to\infty.     The operator is densely defined, and closed.  The same operator can be treated as an operator    Z  →  Z      Z  normal-→  Z    Z→Z   for many choices of Banach space   Z   Z   Z   and not be bounded between any of them. At the same time, it can be bounded as an operator    X  →  Y      X  normal-→  Y    X→Y   for other pairs of Banach spaces    X  ,  Y     X  Y    X,Y   , and also as operator    Z  →  Z      Z  normal-→  Z    Z→Z   for some topological vector spaces   Z   Z   Z   . As an example let    I  ⊂  𝐑      I  normal-⊂  𝐑    I⊂\mathbf{R}   be an open interval and consider       d   d  x    :   (   C  1    (  I  )   ,  ∥  ⋅   ∥   C  1    )   →   (   C  0    (  I  )   ,  ∥  ⋅   ∥  ∞   )   ,     fragments    d    d  x    normal-:   fragments  normal-(   superscript  C  1    fragments  normal-(  I  normal-)   normal-,  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to   superscript  C  1    normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(   superscript  C  0    fragments  normal-(  I  normal-)   normal-,  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to    normal-)   normal-,    \frac{d}{dx}:\left(C^{1}(I),\|\cdot\|_{C^{1}}\right)\to\left(C^{0}(I),\|\cdot%
 \|_{\infty}\right),     where:         ∥  f  ∥    C  1    =     ∥  f  ∥   ∞   +    ∥   f  ′   ∥   ∞     .       subscript   norm  f    superscript  C  1       subscript   norm  f      subscript   norm   superscript  f  normal-′         \|f\|_{C^{1}}=\|f\|_{\infty}+\|f^{\prime}\|_{\infty}.     Adjoint  The adjoint of an unbounded operator can be defined in two equivalent ways. Let be an unbounded operator between Hilbert spaces.  First, it can be defined in a way analogous to how we define the adjoint of a bounded operator. Namely, the adjoint of   T   T   T   is defined as an operator with the property:          ⟨   T  x   ∣  y  ⟩   2   =    ⟨  x  ∣    T  *   y   ⟩   1    ,   x  ∈   D   (  T  )      .     formulae-sequence     subscript   inner-product    T  x   y   2    subscript   inner-product  x     superscript  T    y    1      x    D  T      \langle Tx\mid y\rangle_{2}=\left\langle x\mid T^{*}y\right\rangle_{1},\qquad x%
 \in D(T).     More precisely, is defined in the following way. If is such that    x  ↦   ⟨   T  x   ∣  y  ⟩      maps-to  x   inner-product    T  x   y     x\mapsto\langle Tx\mid y\rangle   is a continuous linear functional on the domain of   T   T   T   , then we declare y to be an element of , and after extending the linear functional to the whole space via the Hahn–Banach theorem , we can find a z in H 1 such that          ⟨   T  x   ∣  y  ⟩   2   =    ⟨  x  ∣  z  ⟩   1    ,   x  ∈   D   (  T  )      ,     formulae-sequence     subscript   inner-product    T  x   y   2    subscript   inner-product  x  z   1      x    D  T      \langle Tx\mid y\rangle_{2}=\langle x\mid z\rangle_{1},\qquad x\in D(T),     since the dual of a Hilbert space can be identified with the set of linear functionals given by the inner product. For each    y  ,  z     y  z    y,z   is uniquely determined if and only if the linear functional that we extended was densely defined; i.e., if   T   T   T   is densely defined. Finally, we let  z }} , completing the construction of . 14 Note that exists if and only if   T   T   T   is densely defined.  By definition, the domain of consists of elements   y   y   y   in such that    x  ↦   ⟨   T  x   ∣  y  ⟩      maps-to  x   inner-product    T  x   y     x\mapsto\langle Tx\mid y\rangle   is continuous on the domain of   T   T   T   . Consequently, the domain of could be anything; it could be trivial (i.e., contains only zero). 15 It may happen that the domain of T ∗ is a closed hyperplane and vanishes everywhere on the domain. 16 17 Thus, boundedness of on its domain does not imply boundedness of   T   T   T   . On the other hand, if is defined on the whole space then   T   T   T   is bounded on its domain and therefore can be extended by continuity to a bounded operator on the whole space. 18 If the domain of is dense, then it has its adjoint . 19 A closed densely defined operator   T   T   T   is bounded if and only if is bounded. 20  The other equivalent definition of the adjoint can be obtained by noticing a general fact. Define a linear operator   J   J   J   as follows: 21      {      J  :     H  1   ⊕   H  2    →    H  2   ⊕   H  1             J   (   x  ⊕  y   )    =    -  y   ⊕  x           cases   normal-:  J   normal-→   direct-sum   subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2     direct-sum   subscript  H  2    subscript  H  1      otherwise      J   direct-sum  x  y     direct-sum    y   x    otherwise    \begin{cases}J:H_{1}\oplus H_{2}\to H_{2}\oplus H_{1}\\
 J(x\oplus y)=-y\oplus x\end{cases}     Since   J   J   J   is an isometric surjection, it is unitary. We then have: is the graph of some operator   S   S   S   if and only if   T   T   T   is densely defined. 22 A simple calculation shows that this "some"   S   S   S   satisfies:         ⟨   T  x   ∣  y  ⟩   2   =    ⟨  x  ∣   S  y   ⟩   1    ,       subscript   inner-product    T  x   y   2    subscript   inner-product  x    S  y    1     \langle Tx\mid y\rangle_{2}=\langle x\mid Sy\rangle_{1},     for every   x   x   x   in the domain of   T   T   T   . Thus,   S   S   S   is the adjoint of   T   T   T   .  It follows immediately from the above definition that the adjoint is closed. 23 In particular, a self-adjoint operator (i.e.,  T  ∗ }} ) is closed. An operator   T   T   T   is closed and densely defined if and only if  T }} . 24  Some well-known properties for bounded operators generalize to closed densely defined operators. The kernel of a closed operator is closed. Moreover, the kernel of a closed densely defined operator coincides with the orthogonal complement of the range of the adjoint. That is, 25      ker   (  T  )   =  ran    (   T  *   )   ⊥   .     fragments  ker   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)    ran   superscript   fragments  normal-(   superscript  T    normal-)   bottom   normal-.    \operatorname{ker}(T)=\operatorname{ran}(T^{*})^{\bot}.     von Neumann's theorem states that and are self-adjoint, and that and both have bounded inverses. 26 If has trivial kernel,   T   T   T   has dense range (by the above identity.) Moreover:      T   T   T   is surjective if and only if there is a    K  >  0      K  0    K>0   such that  f {{!!}} 2 ≤ K {{!!}} T  ∗ f {{!!}} 1 }} for all   f   f   f   in . If   T   T   T   is surjective, then has bounded inverse, which we denote by   S   S   S   . The estimate then follows since         ∥  f  ∥   2  2   =   |    ⟨   T  S  f   ∣  f  ⟩   2   |   ≤    ∥  S  ∥     ∥  f  ∥   2     ∥    T  *   f   ∥   1           superscript   subscript   norm  f   2   2      subscript   inner-product    T  S  f   f   2            norm  S    subscript   norm  f   2    subscript   norm     superscript  T    f    1       \|f\|_{2}^{2}=\left|\langle TSf\mid f\rangle_{2}\right|\leq\|S\|\|f\|_{2}\left%
 \|T^{*}f\right\|_{1}     Conversely, suppose the estimate holds. Since has closed range then, we have: ran( TT  * )}} . Since    r  a  n   (  T  )       r  a  n  T    ran(T)   is dense, it suffices to show that has closed range. If is convergent, then is convergent by the estimate since         ∥    T  *    f  j    ∥   1  2   =   |    ⟨    T  *    f  j    ∣    T  *    f  j    ⟩   1   |   ≤     ∥   T   T  *    f  j    ∥   2     ∥   f  j   ∥   2     .         superscript   subscript   norm     superscript  T     subscript  f  j     1   2      subscript   inner-product     superscript  T     subscript  f  j       superscript  T     subscript  f  j     1            subscript   norm    T   superscript  T     subscript  f  j     2    subscript   norm   subscript  f  j    2       \|T^{*}f_{j}\|_{1}^{2}=|\langle T^{*}f_{j}\mid T^{*}f_{j}\rangle_{1}|\leq\|TT^%
 {*}f_{j}\|_{2}\|f_{j}\|_{2}.     Say, . Since is self-adjoint; thus, closed, (von Neumann's theorem), . QED (This is essentially a variant of the so-called closed range theorem .) In particular,   T   T   T   has closed range if and only if has closed range.  In contrast to the bounded case, it is not necessary that we have:  S  ∗ T  ∗ }} , since, for example, it is even possible that doesn't exist. This is, however, the case if, for example,   T   T   T   is bounded. 27  A densely defined, closed operator   T   T   T   is called normal if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: 28    TT  ∗ }} ;    the domain of   T   T   T   is equal to the domain of , and Tx {{!!}} {{=}} {{!!}} T  ∗ x {{!!}}}} for every   x   x   x   in this domain;    there exist self-adjoint operators    A  ,  B     A  B    A,B   such that    T  =   A  +   i  B        T    A    i  B      T=A+iB   ,  A – iB }} , and Tx {{!!}} 2 {{=}} {{!!}} Ax {{!!}} 2 + {{!!}} Bx {{!!}} 2 }} for every   x   x   x   in the domain of   T   T   T   .   Every self-adjoint operator is normal.  Transpose  Let be an operator between Banach spaces. Then the transpose (or dual )     T  ′   :    B  2    *   →   B  1    *       normal-:   superscript  T  normal-′    normal-→   superscript   subscript  B  2      superscript   subscript  B  1        T^{\prime}:{B_{2}}^{*}\to{B_{1}}^{*}   of T is an operator satisfying:       ⟨   T  x   ,   y  ′   ⟩   =   ⟨  x  ,    T  ′    y  ′    ⟩          T  x    superscript  y  normal-′     x     superscript  T  normal-′    superscript  y  normal-′       \langle Tx,y^{\prime}\rangle=\langle x,T^{\prime}y^{\prime}\rangle   for all x in B 1 and y in B 2 * . Here, we used the notation     ⟨  x  ,   x  ′   ⟩   =    x  ′    (  x  )         x   superscript  x  normal-′       superscript  x  normal-′   x     \langle x,x^{\prime}\rangle=x^{\prime}(x)   . 29  The necessary and sufficient condition for the transpose of T to exist is that T is densely defined (for essentially the same reason as to adjoints, as discussed above.)  For any Hilbert space H , there is the anti-linear isomorphism:      J  :    H  *   →  H      normal-:  J   normal-→   superscript  H    H     J:H^{*}\to H   given by Jf = y where    f   (  x  )   =    ⟨  x  ∣  y  ⟩   H   ,   (  x  ∈  H  )      fragments  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript   fragments  normal-⟨  x  normal-∣  y  normal-⟩   H   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  x   H  normal-)     f(x)=\langle x\mid y\rangle_{H},(x\in H)   . Through this isomorphism, the transpose T ' relates to the adjoint T ∗ in the following way:       T  *   =    J  1    T  ′    J  2   -  1          superscript  T       subscript  J  1    superscript  T  normal-′    superscript   subscript  J  2     1       T^{*}=J_{1}T^{\prime}J_{2}^{-1}   , 30 where     J  j   :    H  j  *   →   H  j       normal-:   subscript  J  j    normal-→   superscript   subscript  H  j      subscript  H  j      J_{j}:H_{j}^{*}\to H_{j}   . (For the finite-dimensional case, this corresponds to the fact that the adjoint of a matrix is its conjugate transpose.) Note that this gives the definition of adjoint in terms of a transpose.  Closed linear operators  Closed linear operators are a class of linear operators on Banach spaces . They are more general than bounded operators , and therefore not necessarily continuous , but they still retain nice enough properties that one can define the spectrum and (with certain assumptions) functional calculus for such operators. Many important linear operators which fail to be bounded turn out to be closed, such as the derivative and a large class of differential operators .  Let    X  ,  Y     X  Y    X,Y   be two Banach spaces . A linear operator     A  :   D   (  A  )   ⊂  X  →  Y      normal-:  A    D  A  normal-⊂  X  normal-→  Y     A:D(A)⊂X→Y   is closed if for every sequence in    D   (  A  )       D  A    D(A)    converging to   x   x   x   in   X   X   X   such that as    n  →  ∞      n  normal-→  normal-∞    n→∞   one has    x  ∈  D   (  A  )       x  normal-∈  D  A    x∈D(A)   and     A  x   =  y        A  x   y    Ax=y   . Equivalently,   A   A   A   is closed if its graph is closed in the direct sum     X  ⊕  Y      X  normal-⊕  Y    X⊕Y   .  Given a linear operator   A   A   A   , not necessarily closed, if the closure of its graph in    X  ⊕  Y      X  normal-⊕  Y    X⊕Y   happens to be the graph of some operator, that operator is called the closure of   A   A   A   , and we say that   A   A   A   is closable . Denote the closure of   A   A   A   by    A  ¯     normal-¯  A    \overline{A}   . It follows easily that   A   A   A   is the restriction of    A  ¯     normal-¯  A    \overline{A}   to    D   (  A  )       D  A    D(A)   .  A core of a closable operator is a subset    C   C   C   of    D   (  A  )       D  A    D(A)   such that the closure of the restriction of   A   A   A   to   C   C   C   is    A  ¯     normal-¯  A    \overline{A}   .  Basic Properties  Any closed linear operator defined on the whole space   X   X   X   is bounded. This is the closed graph theorem . Additionally, the following properties are easily checked:   If   A   A   A   is closed then    A  −  λ  I      A  normal-−  λ  I    A−λI   is closed where   λ   λ   λ   is a scalar and   I   I   I   is the identity function ;  If   A   A   A   is closed, then its kernel (or nullspace) is a closed subspace of   X   X   X   ;  If   A   A   A   is closed and injective , then its inverse  is also closed;  An operator   A   A   A   admits a closure if and only if for every pair of sequences  and  in    D   (  A  )       D  A    D(A)   both converging to   x   x   x   , such that both  and  converge, one has lim n  Ay n }} .   Example  Consider the derivative operator    A  =   d   d  x        A    d    d  x      A=\frac{d}{dx}   where    X  =  Y  =  C   (  a  a  ,  b  )   )     fragments  X   Y   C   fragments  normal-(  a  a  normal-,  b  normal-)   normal-)    X=Y=C(aa,b))   is the Banach space of all continuous functions on an interval      a  a   ,  b       a  a   b    aa,b   . If one takes its domain    D   (  A  )       D  A    D(A)   to be , then   A   A   A   is a closed operator, which is not bounded. On the other hand if [[smooth function| C ∞ ([ a , b ])]]}} , then   A   A   A   will no longer be closed, but it will be closable, with the closure being its extension defined on .  Symmetric operators and self-adjoint operators  An operator T on a Hilbert space is symmetric if and only if for each x and y in the domain of   T   T   T   we have     ⟨  T  x  ∣  y  ⟩   =   \lang   x  ∣  T  y   \rang      fragments   fragments  normal-⟨  T  x  normal-∣  y  normal-⟩    \lang  x  normal-∣  T  y  \rang    \langle Tx\mid y\rangle=\lang x\mid Ty\rang   . A densely defined operator   T   T   T   is symmetric if and only if it agrees with its adjoint T ∗ restricted to the domain of T , in other words when T ∗ is an extension of   T   T   T   . 31  In general, if T is densely defined and symmetric, the domain of the adjoint T ∗ need not equal the domain of T . If T is symmetric and the domain of T and the domain of the adjoint coincide, then we say that T is self-adjoint . 32 Note that, when T is self-adjoint, the existence of the adjoint implies that T is densely defined and since T ∗ is necessarily closed, T is closed.  A densely defined operator T is symmetric , if the subspace    Γ   (  T  )       normal-Γ  T    Γ(T)   (defined in a previous section) is orthogonal to its image    J   (   Γ   (  T  )    )       J    normal-Γ  T     J(Γ(T))   under J (where J ( x , y ):=( y ,- x )). 33  Equivalently, an operator T is self-adjoint if it is densely defined, closed, symmetric, and satisfies the fourth condition: both operators    T  –  i      T  normal-–  i    T–i   ,    T  +  i      T  i    T+i   are surjective, that is, map the domain of T onto the whole space H . In other words: for every x in H there exist y and z in the domain of T such that     T  y  –  i  y   =  x        T  y  normal-–  i  y   x    Ty–iy=x   and      T  z   +   i  z    =  x          T  z     i  z    x    Tz+iz=x   . 34  An operator T is self-adjoint , if the two subspaces    Γ   (  T  )       normal-Γ  T    Γ(T)   ,    J   (   Γ   (  T  )    )       J    normal-Γ  T     J(Γ(T))   are orthogonal and their sum is the whole space     H  ⊕  H   .     direct-sum  H  H    H\oplus H.    35  This approach does not cover non-densely defined closed operators. Non-densely defined symmetric operators can be defined directly or via graphs, but not via adjoint operators.  A symmetric operator is often studied via its Cayley transform .  An operator T on a complex Hilbert space is symmetric if and only if its quadratic form is real, that is, the number    ⟨   T  x   ∣  x  ⟩     inner-product    T  x   x    \langle Tx\mid x\rangle   is real for all x in the domain of T . 36  A densely defined closed symmetric operator T is self-adjoint if and only if T ∗ is symmetric. 37 It may happen that it is not. 38 39  A densely defined operator T is called positive 40 (or nonnegative 41 ) if its quadratic form is nonnegative, that is,     ⟨   T  x   ∣  x  ⟩   ≥  0       inner-product    T  x   x   0    \langle Tx\mid x\rangle\geq 0   for all x in the domain of T . Such operator is necessarily symmetric.  The operator T ∗ T is self-adjoint 42 and positive 43 for every densely defined, closed T .  The spectral theorem applies to self-adjoint operators 44 and moreover, to normal operators, 45 46 but not to densely defined, closed operators in general, since in this case the spectrum can be empty. 47 48  A symmetric operator defined everywhere is closed, therefore bounded, 49 which is the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem . 50  Extension-related  By definition, an operator T is an extension of an operator S if    Γ   (  S  )   ⊆  Γ   (  T  )       normal-Γ  S  normal-⊆  normal-Γ  T    Γ(S)⊆Γ(T)   . 51 An equivalent direct definition: for every x in the domain of S , x belongs to the domain of T and     S  x   =   T  x         S  x     T  x     Sx=Tx   . 52 53  Note that an everywhere defined extension exists for every operator, which is a purely algebraic fact explained at Discontinuous linear map#General existence theorem and based on the axiom of choice . If the given operator is not bounded then the extension is a discontinuous linear map . It is of little use since it cannot preserve important properties of the given operator (see below), and usually is highly non-unique.  An operator T is called closable if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: 54 55 56   T has a closed extension;  the closure of the graph of T is the graph of some operator;  for every sequence ( x n ) of points from the domain of T such that x n → 0 and also Tx n → y it holds that    y  =  0      y  0    y=0   .   Not all operators are closable. 57  A closable operator T has the least closed extension    T  ¯     normal-¯  T    \overline{T}   called the closure of T . The closure of the graph of T is equal to the graph of     T  ¯   .     normal-¯  T    \overline{T}.    58 59  Other, non-minimal closed extensions may exist. 60 61  A densely defined operator T is closable if and only if T ∗ is densely defined. In this case     T  ¯   =   T    *  *         normal-¯  T    superscript  T    absent       \overline{T}=T^{**}   and       (   T  ¯   )   *   =   T  *    .       superscript   normal-¯  T      superscript  T      (\overline{T})^{*}=T^{*}.    62 63  If S is densely defined and T is an extension of S then S ∗ is an extension of T ∗ . 64  Every symmetric operator is closable. 65  A symmetric operator is called maximal symmetric if it has no symmetric extensions, except for itself. 66  Every self-adjoint operator is maximal symmetric. 67 The converse is wrong. 68  An operator is called essentially self-adjoint if its closure is self-adjoint. 69  An operator is essentially self-adjoint if and only if it has one and only one self-adjoint extension. 70  An operator may have more than one self-adjoint extension, and even a continuum of them. 71  A densely defined, symmetric operator T is essentially self-adjoint if and only if both operators    T  –  i      T  normal-–  i    T–i   ,    T  +  i      T  i    T+i   have dense range. 72  Let T be a densely defined operator. Denoting the relation " T is an extension of S " by S ⊂ T (a conventional abbreviation for Γ( S ) ⊆ Γ( T )) one has the following. 73   If T is symmetric then T ⊂ T ∗∗ ⊂ T ∗ .  If T is closed and symmetric then T = T ∗∗ ⊂ T ∗ .  If T is self-adjoint then T = T ∗∗ = T ∗ .  If T is essentially self-adjoint then T ⊂ T ∗∗ = T ∗ .   Importance of self-adjoint operators  The class of self-adjoint operators is especially important in mathematical physics. Every self-adjoint operator is densely defined, closed and symmetric. The converse holds for bounded operators but fails in general. Self-adjointness is substantially more restricting than these three properties. The famous spectral theorem holds for self-adjoint operators. In combination with Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups it shows that self-adjoint operators are precisely the infinitesimal generators of strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups, see Self-adjoint operator#Self-adjoint extensions in quantum mechanics . Such unitary groups are especially important for describing time evolution in classical and quantum mechanics.
