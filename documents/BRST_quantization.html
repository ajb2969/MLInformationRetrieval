<h1>BRST quantization</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="theoretical_physics" title="wikilink">theoretical physics</a>, <strong>BRST quantization</strong> (where the <em>BRST</em> refers to <a href="Carlo_Becchi" title="wikilink">Becchi</a>, <a href=":de:Alain_Rouet" title="wikilink">Rouet</a>, <a href="Raymond_Stora" title="wikilink">Stora</a> and <a href="Igor_Tyutin" title="wikilink">Tyutin</a>) denotes a relatively rigorous mathematical approach to <a href="Quantization_(physics)" title="wikilink">quantizing</a> a <a href="quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">field theory</a> with a <a href="gauge_symmetry" title="wikilink">gauge symmetry</a>. <a href="Quantization_(physics)" title="wikilink">Quantization</a> rules in earlier QFT frameworks resembled "prescriptions" or "heuristics" more than proofs, especially in <a href="non-abelian_gauge_theory" title="wikilink">non-abelian</a> QFT, where the use of "<a href="ghost_fields" title="wikilink">ghost fields</a>" with superficially bizarre properties is almost unavoidable for technical reasons related to <a class="uri" href="renormalization" title="wikilink">renormalization</a> and <a href="anomaly_cancellation" title="wikilink">anomaly cancellation</a>.</p>

<p>The BRST global <a class="uri" href="supersymmetry" title="wikilink">supersymmetry</a> introduced in the mid-1970s was quickly understood to rationalize the introduction of these <a href="Faddeev–Popov_ghost" title="wikilink">Faddeev–Popov ghosts</a> and their exclusion from "physical" asymptotic states when performing QFT calculations. Crucially, this symmetry of the path integral is preserved in loop order, and thus prevents introduction of counterterms which might spoil <a href="Renormalization#Renormalizability" title="wikilink">renormalizability</a> of gauge theories. Work by other authors a few years later related the BRST operator to the existence of a rigorous alternative to <a href="Path_integral_formulation" title="wikilink">path integrals</a> when quantizing a gauge theory.</p>

<p>Only in the late 1980s, when QFT was reformulated in <a href="fiber_bundle" title="wikilink">fiber bundle</a> language for application to problems in the <a href="Donaldson_theory" title="wikilink">topology of low-dimensional manifolds</a>, did it become apparent that the BRST "transformation" is fundamentally geometrical in character. In this light, "BRST quantization" becomes more than an alternate way to arrive at anomaly-cancelling ghosts. It is a different perspective on what the ghost fields represent, why the Faddeev–Popov method works, and how it is related to the use of <a href="Hamiltonian_mechanics" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian mechanics</a> to construct a perturbative framework. The relationship between <a href="gauge_invariance" title="wikilink">gauge invariance</a> and "BRST invariance" forces the choice of a Hamiltonian system whose states are composed of "particles" according to the rules familiar from the <a href="canonical_quantization" title="wikilink">canonical quantization</a> formalism. This esoteric consistency condition therefore comes quite close to explaining how <a href="quantum" title="wikilink">quanta</a> and <a class="uri" href="fermions" title="wikilink">fermions</a> arise in physics to begin with.</p>

<p>In certain cases, notably <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">gravity</a> and <a class="uri" href="supergravity" title="wikilink">supergravity</a>, BRST must be superseded by a more general formalism, the <a href="Batalin–Vilkovisky_formalism" title="wikilink">Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="technical-summary">Technical summary</h2>

<p>BRST quantization (or the <strong>BRST formalism</strong>) is a <a href="Differential_geometry" title="wikilink">differential geometric</a> approach to performing consistent, <a href="Anomaly_(physics)" title="wikilink">anomaly</a>-free <a href="Time-dependent_perturbation_theory" title="wikilink">perturbative calculations</a> in a <a href="non-abelian_gauge_theory" title="wikilink">non-abelian</a> <a href="gauge_theory" title="wikilink">gauge theory</a>. The analytical form of the BRST "transformation" and its relevance to <a class="uri" href="renormalization" title="wikilink">renormalization</a> and <a href="anomaly_cancellation" title="wikilink">anomaly cancellation</a> were described by <a href="Carlo_Becchi" title="wikilink">Carlo Maria Becchi</a>, <a href=":de:Alain_Rouet" title="wikilink">:de:Alain Rouet</a>, and <a href="Raymond_Stora" title="wikilink">Raymond Stora</a> in a series of papers culminating in the 1976 "Renormalization of gauge theories". The equivalent transformation and many of its properties were independently discovered by <a href="Igor_Tyutin" title="wikilink">Igor Viktorovich Tyutin</a>. Its significance for rigorous <a href="canonical_quantization" title="wikilink">canonical quantization</a> of a <a href="Yang–Mills_theory" title="wikilink">Yang–Mills theory</a> and its correct application to the <a href="Fock_space" title="wikilink">Fock space</a> of instantaneous field configurations were elucidated by Kugo Taichiro and Ojima Izumi. Later work by many authors, notably Thomas Schücker and <a href="Edward_Witten" title="wikilink">Edward Witten</a>, has clarified the geometric significance of the BRST operator and related fields and emphasized its importance to <a href="topological_quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">topological quantum field theory</a> and <a href="string_theory" title="wikilink">string theory</a>.</p>

<p>In the BRST approach, one selects a perturbation-friendly <a href="gauge_fixing" title="wikilink">gauge fixing</a> procedure for the <a href="action_principle" title="wikilink">action principle</a> of a gauge theory using the <a href="differential_geometry" title="wikilink">differential geometry</a> of the <a href="principal_bundle" title="wikilink">gauge bundle</a> on which the field theory lives. One then <a href="Quantization_(physics)" title="wikilink">quantizes</a> the theory to obtain a <a href="Hamiltonian_system" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian system</a> in the <a href="interaction_picture" title="wikilink">interaction picture</a> in such a way that the "unphysical" fields introduced by the gauge fixing procedure resolve <a href="gauge_anomaly" title="wikilink">gauge anomalies</a> without appearing in the asymptotic <a href="quantum_state" title="wikilink">states</a> of the theory. The result is a set of <a href="Feynman_rules" title="wikilink">Feynman rules</a> for use in a <a href="Dyson_series" title="wikilink">Dyson series</a> <a href="perturbative_expansion" title="wikilink">perturbative expansion</a> of the <a class="uri" href="S-matrix" title="wikilink">S-matrix</a> which guarantee that it is <a href="Unitary_matrix" title="wikilink">unitary</a> and <a class="uri" href="renormalizable" title="wikilink">renormalizable</a> at each <a href="one-loop_order" title="wikilink">loop order</a>—in short, a coherent approximation technique for making physical predictions about the results of <a href="Scattering#Scattering_in_particle_physics" title="wikilink">scattering experiments</a>.</p>

<p>This is related to a <a href="Symplectic_geometry" title="wikilink">supersymplectic</a> <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> where pure operators are graded by integral <a href="ghost_numbers" title="wikilink">ghost numbers</a> and we have a BRST <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gauge-transformations-in-qft">Gauge transformations in QFT</h2>

<p>From a practical perspective, a <a href="quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">quantum field theory</a> consists of an <a href="action_principle" title="wikilink">action principle</a> and a set of procedures for performing <a href="Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)" title="wikilink">perturbative calculations</a>. There are other kinds of "sanity checks" that can be performed on a quantum field theory to determine whether it fits qualitative phenomena such as <a href="quark_confinement" title="wikilink">quark confinement</a> and <a href="asymptotic_freedom" title="wikilink">asymptotic freedom</a>. However, most of the predictive successes of quantum field theory, from <a href="quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum electrodynamics</a> to the present day, have been quantified by matching <a class="uri" href="S-matrix" title="wikilink">S-matrix</a> calculations against the results of <a class="uri" href="scattering" title="wikilink">scattering</a> experiments.</p>

<p>In the early days of QFT, one would have to have said that the <a href="Quantization_(physics)" title="wikilink">quantization</a> and <a class="uri" href="renormalization" title="wikilink">renormalization</a> prescriptions were as much part of the model as the <a href="Lagrangian_density" title="wikilink">Lagrangian density</a>, especially when they relied on the powerful but mathematically ill-defined <a href="Path_integral_formulation" title="wikilink">path integral formalism</a>. It quickly became clear that QED was almost "magical" in its relative tractability, and that most of the ways that one might imagine extending it would not produce rational calculations. However, one class of field theories remained promising: <a href="gauge_theories" title="wikilink">gauge theories</a>, in which the objects in the theory represent <a href="equivalence_classes" title="wikilink">equivalence classes</a> of physically indistinguishable field configurations, any two of which are related by a <a href="gauge_transformation" title="wikilink">gauge transformation</a>. This generalizes the QED idea of a <a href="Gauge_theory#Classical_electromagnetism" title="wikilink">local change of phase</a> to a more complicated <a href="Lie_group" title="wikilink">Lie group</a>.</p>

<p>QED itself is a gauge theory, as is <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>, although the latter has proven resistant to quantization so far, for reasons related to renormalization. Another class of gauge theories with a <a href="Non-abelian_group" title="wikilink">non-Abelian</a> gauge group, beginning with <a href="Yang–Mills_theory" title="wikilink">Yang–Mills theory</a>, became amenable to quantization in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely due to the work of <a href="Ludwig_D._Faddeev" title="wikilink">Ludwig D. Faddeev</a>, <a href="Victor_Popov" title="wikilink">Victor Popov</a>, <a href="Bryce_DeWitt" title="wikilink">Bryce DeWitt</a>, and <a href="Gerardus_'t_Hooft" title="wikilink">Gerardus 't Hooft</a>. However, they remained very difficult to work with until the introduction of the BRST method. The BRST method provided the calculation techniques and renormalizability proofs needed to extract accurate results from both "unbroken" Yang–Mills theories and those in which the <a href="Higgs_mechanism" title="wikilink">Higgs mechanism</a> leads to <a href="spontaneous_symmetry_breaking" title="wikilink">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a>. Representatives of these two types of Yang–Mills systems—<a href="quantum_chromodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum chromodynamics</a> and <a href="electroweak_theory" title="wikilink">electroweak theory</a>—appear in the <a href="Standard_Model" title="wikilink">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a>.</p>

<p>It has proven rather more difficult to prove the <em>existence</em> of non-Abelian quantum field theory in a rigorous sense than to obtain accurate predictions using semi-heuristic calculation schemes. This is because analyzing a quantum field theory requires two mathematically interlocked perspectives: a <a href="Lagrangian_system" title="wikilink">Lagrangian system</a> based on the <a href="action_functional" title="wikilink">action functional</a>, composed of <em>fields</em> with distinct values at each point in spacetime and <a href="local_operators" title="wikilink">local operators</a> which act on them, and a <a href="Hamiltonian_system" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian system</a> in the <a href="Dirac_picture" title="wikilink">Dirac picture</a>, composed of <em>states</em> which characterize the entire system at a given time and <a href="field_operators" title="wikilink">field operators</a> which act on them. What makes this so difficult in a gauge theory is that the objects of the theory are not really local fields on spacetime; they are <a class="uri" href="right-invariant" title="wikilink">right-invariant</a> local fields on the <a href="principal_gauge_bundle" title="wikilink">principal gauge bundle</a>, and different <a href="local_sections" title="wikilink">local sections</a> through a portion of the gauge bundle, related by <em>passive</em> transformations, produce different Dirac pictures.</p>

<p>What is more, a description of the system as a whole in terms of a set of fields contains many redundant degrees of freedom; the distinct configurations of the theory are <a href="equivalence_classes" title="wikilink">equivalence classes</a> of field configurations, so that two descriptions which are related to one another by an <em>active</em> gauge transformation are also really the same physical configuration. The "solutions" of a quantized gauge theory exist not in a straightforward space of fields with values at every point in spacetime but in a <a href="Quotient_space_(topology)" title="wikilink">quotient space</a> (or <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a>) whose elements are equivalence classes of field configurations. Hiding in the BRST formalism is a system for parameterizing the variations associated with all possible active gauge transformations and correctly accounting for their physical irrelevance during the conversion of a Lagrangian system to a Hamiltonian system.</p>
<h3 id="gauge-fixing-and-perturbation-theory">Gauge fixing and perturbation theory</h3>

<p>The principle of <a href="gauge_invariance" title="wikilink">gauge invariance</a> is essential to constructing a workable quantum field theory. But it is generally not feasible to perform a perturbative calculation in a gauge theory without first "fixing the gauge"—adding terms to the <a href="Lagrangian_density" title="wikilink">Lagrangian density</a> of the action principle which "break the gauge symmetry" to suppress these "unphysical" degrees of freedom. The idea of <a href="gauge_fixing" title="wikilink">gauge fixing</a> goes back to the <a href="Lorenz_gauge" title="wikilink">Lorenz gauge</a> approach to electromagnetism, which suppresses most of the excess degrees of freedom in the <a class="uri" href="four-potential" title="wikilink">four-potential</a> while retaining manifest <a href="Lorentz_invariance" title="wikilink">Lorentz invariance</a>. The Lorenz gauge is a great simplification relative to Maxwell's field-strength approach to <a href="classical_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">classical electrodynamics</a>, and illustrates why it is useful to deal with excess degrees of freedom in the <a href="group_representation" title="wikilink">representation</a> of the objects in a theory at the Lagrangian stage, before passing over to <a href="Hamiltonian_mechanics" title="wikilink">Hamiltonian mechanics</a> via the <a href="Legendre_transform" title="wikilink">Legendre transform</a>.</p>

<p>The Hamiltonian density is related to the Lie derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to a unit timelike horizontal vector field on the gauge bundle. In a quantum mechanical context it is conventionally rescaled by a factor

. Integrating it by parts over a spacelike cross section recovers the form of the integrand familiar from <a href="canonical_quantization" title="wikilink">canonical quantization</a>. Because the definition of the Hamiltonian involves a unit time vector field on the base space, a <a href="horizontal_lift" title="wikilink">horizontal lift</a> to the bundle space, and a spacelike surface "normal" (in the <a href="Minkowski_metric" title="wikilink">Minkowski metric</a>) to the unit time vector field at each point on the base manifold, it is dependent both on the <a href="Connection_(principal_bundle)" title="wikilink">connection</a> and the choice of Lorentz <a href="Inertial_frame_of_reference" title="wikilink">frame</a>, and is far from being globally defined. But it is an essential ingredient in the perturbative framework of quantum field theory, into which the quantized Hamiltonian enters via the <a href="Dyson_series" title="wikilink">Dyson series</a>.</p>

<p>For perturbative purposes, we gather the configuration of all the fields of our theory on an entire three-dimensional horizontal spacelike cross section of <em>P</em> into one object (a <a href="Fock_state" title="wikilink">Fock state</a>), and then describe the "evolution" of this state over time using the <a href="interaction_picture" title="wikilink">interaction picture</a>.

. In the interaction picture, we relate Fock states at different times by prescribing that each eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian experiences a constant rate of phase rotation proportional to its <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> (the corresponding <a class="uri" href="eigenvalue" title="wikilink">eigenvalue</a> of the unperturbed Hamiltonian).</p>

<p>Hence, in the zero-order approximation, the set of weights characterizing a Fock state does not change over time, but the corresponding field configuration does. In higher approximations, the weights also change; <a class="uri" href="collider" title="wikilink">collider</a> experiments in <a href="high-energy_physics" title="wikilink">high-energy physics</a> amount to measurements of the rate of change in these weights (or rather integrals of them over distributions representing uncertainty in the initial and final conditions of a scattering event).

, in the form of a power series in the <a href="coupling_constant" title="wikilink">coupling constant</a> <em>g</em>; it is the principal tool for making quantitative predictions from a quantum field theory.</p>

<p>To use the Dyson series to calculate anything, one needs more than a gauge-invariant Lagrangian density; one also needs the quantization and gauge fixing prescriptions that enter into the <a href="Feynman_rules" title="wikilink">Feynman rules</a> of the theory. The Dyson series produces infinite integrals of various kinds when applied to the Hamiltonian of a particular QFT. This is partly because all usable quantum field theories to date must be considered <a href="effective_field_theories" title="wikilink">effective field theories</a>, describing only interactions on a certain range of energy scales that we can experimentally probe and therefore vulnerable to <a href="ultraviolet_divergences" title="wikilink">ultraviolet divergences</a>. These are tolerable as long as they can be handled via standard techniques of <a class="uri" href="renormalization" title="wikilink">renormalization</a>; they are not so tolerable when they result in an infinite series of infinite renormalizations or, worse, in an obviously unphysical prediction such as an uncancelled <a href="gauge_anomaly" title="wikilink">gauge anomaly</a>. There is a deep relationship between renormalizability and gauge invariance, which is easily lost in the course of attempts to obtain tractable Feynman rules by fixing the gauge.</p>

. This sort of prescription can be applied to an <a href="Abelian_gauge_theory" title="wikilink">Abelian gauge theory</a> such as <a href="Quantum_electrodynamics" title="wikilink">QED</a>, although it results in some difficulty in explaining why the <a href="Ward_identities" title="wikilink">Ward identities</a> of the classical theory carry over to the quantum theory—in other words, why <a href="Feynman_diagrams" title="wikilink">Feynman diagrams</a> containing internal <a href="longitudinally_polarized" title="wikilink">longitudinally polarized</a> <a href="virtual_photons" title="wikilink">virtual photons</a> do not contribute to <a class="uri" href="S-matrix" title="wikilink">S-matrix</a> calculations. This approach also does not generalize well to <a href="non-Abelian_gauge_groups" title="wikilink">non-Abelian gauge groups</a> such as the SU(2) of Yang–Mills and <a href="electroweak_theory" title="wikilink">electroweak theory</a> and the SU(3) of <a href="quantum_chromodynamics" title="wikilink">quantum chromodynamics</a>. It suffers from <a href="Gribov_ambiguities" title="wikilink">Gribov ambiguities</a> and from the difficulty of defining a gauge fixing constraint that is in some sense "orthogonal" to physically significant changes in the field configuration.</p>

<p>More sophisticated approaches do not attempt to apply a <a href="Kronecker_delta" title="wikilink">delta function</a> constraint to the gauge transformation degrees of freedom. Instead of "fixing" the gauge to a particular "constraint surface" in configuration space, one can break the gauge freedom with an additional, non-gauge-invariant term added to the Lagrangian density. In order to reproduce the successes of gauge fixing, this term is chosen to be minimal for the choice of gauge that corresponds to the desired constraint and to depend quadratically on the deviation of the gauge from the constraint surface. By the <a href="stationary_phase_approximation" title="wikilink">stationary phase approximation</a> on which the <a href="Feynman_path_integral" title="wikilink">Feynman path integral</a> is based, the dominant contribution to perturbative calculations will come from field configurations in the neighborhood of the constraint surface.</p>

<p>The perturbative expansion associated with this Lagrangian, using the method of <a href="functional_quantization" title="wikilink">functional quantization</a>, is generally referred to as the <em>R</em><sub>ξ</sub> gauge. It reduces in the case of an Abelian U(1) gauge to the same set of <a href="Feynman_rules" title="wikilink">Feynman rules</a> that one obtains in the method of <a href="canonical_quantization" title="wikilink">canonical quantization</a>. But there is an important difference: the broken gauge freedom appears in the <a href="functional_integral" title="wikilink">functional integral</a> as an additional factor in the overall normalization. This factor can only be pulled out of the perturbative expansion (and ignored) when the contribution to the Lagrangian of a perturbation along the gauge degrees of freedom is independent of the particular "physical" field configuration. This is the condition that fails to hold for non-Abelian gauge groups. If one ignores the problem and attempts to use the Feynman rules obtained from "naive" functional quantization, one finds that one's calculations contain unremovable anomalies.</p>

<p>The problem of perturbative calculations in QCD was solved by introducing additional fields known as <a href="Faddeev–Popov_ghosts" title="wikilink">Faddeev–Popov ghosts</a>, whose contribution to the gauge-fixed Lagrangian offsets the anomaly introduced by the coupling of "physical" and "unphysical" perturbations of the non-Abelian gauge field. From the functional quantization perspective, the "unphysical" perturbations of the field configuration (the gauge transformations) form a subspace of the space of all (infinitesimal) perturbations; in the non-Abelian case, the embedding of this subspace in the larger space depends on the configuration around which the perturbation takes place. The ghost term in the Lagrangian represents the <a href="functional_determinant" title="wikilink">functional determinant</a> of the <a href="Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant" title="wikilink">Jacobian</a> of this embedding, and the properties of the ghost field are dictated by the exponent desired on the determinant in order to correct the <a href="functional_measure" title="wikilink">functional measure</a> on the remaining "physical" perturbation axes.</p>

<p>More importantly for the Hamiltonian perturbative formalism (which is carried out not on the fiber bundle but on a local section), adding a BRST exact term to a gauge invariant Lagrangian density preserves the relation <em>s<sub>B</sub>X</em> = 0. As we shall see, this implies that there is a related operator <em>Q<sub>B</sub></em> on the state space for which

 (or vice versa).</p>

<p>Another way of looking at the nilpotence of the BRST operator is to say that its <a href="image_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">image</a> (the space of BRST <a href="exact_form" title="wikilink">exact forms</a>) lies entirely within its <a href="Kernel_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">kernel</a> (the space of BRST <a href="Closed_differential_form" title="wikilink">closed forms</a>). (The "true" Lagrangian, presumed to be invariant under local gauge transformations, is in the kernel of the BRST operator but not in its image.) The preceding argument says that we can limit our universe of initial and final conditions to asymptotic "states"—field configurations at timelike infinity, where the interaction Lagrangian is "turned off"—that lie in the kernel of <em>Q<sub>B</sub></em> and still obtain a unitary scattering matrix. (BRST closed and exact states are defined similarly to BRST closed and exact fields; closed states are annihilated by <em>Q<sub>B</sub></em>, while exact states are those obtainable by applying <em>Q<sub>B</sub></em> to some arbitrary field configuration.)</p>

<p>We can also suppress states that lie inside the image of <em>Q<sub>B</sub></em> when defining the asymptotic states of our theory—but the reasoning is a bit subtler. Since we have postulated that the "true" Lagrangian of our theory is gauge invariant, the true "states" of our Hamiltonian system are equivalence classes under local gauge transformation; in other words, two initial or final states in the Hamiltonian picture that differ only by a BRST exact state are physically equivalent. However, the use of a BRST exact gauge breaking prescription does not guarantee that the interaction Hamiltonian will preserve any particular subspace of closed field configurations that we can call "orthogonal" to the space of exact configurations. (This is a crucial point, often mishandled in QFT textbooks. There is no <em>a priori</em> inner product on field configurations built into the action principle; we construct such an inner product as part of our Hamiltonian perturbative apparatus.)</p>

<p>We therefore focus on the vector space of BRST closed configurations at a particular time with the intention of converting it into a <a href="Fock_space" title="wikilink">Fock space</a> of intermediate states suitable for Hamiltonian perturbation. To this end, we shall endow it with <a href="ladder_operators" title="wikilink">ladder operators</a> for the energy-momentum eigenconfigurations (particles) of each field, complete with appropriate (anti-)commutation rules, as well as a <a href="Definite_bilinear_form" title="wikilink">positive semi-definite</a> <a href="inner_product" title="wikilink">inner product</a>. We require that the <a href="inner_product" title="wikilink">inner product</a> be <a href="Mathematical_singularity" title="wikilink">singular</a> exclusively along directions that correspond to BRST exact eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. This ensures that one can freely choose, from within the two equivalence classes of asymptotic field configurations corresponding to particular initial and final eigenstates of the (unbroken) free-field Hamiltonian, any pair of BRST closed Fock states that we like.</p>

<p>The desired quantization prescriptions will also provide a <em>quotient</em> Fock space isomorphic to the <strong>BRST cohomology</strong>, in which each BRST closed equivalence class of intermediate states (differing only by an exact state) is represented by exactly one state that contains no quanta of the BRST exact fields. This is the Fock space we want for <em>asymptotic</em> states of the theory; even though we will not generally succeed in choosing the particular final field configuration to which the gauge-fixed <em>Lagrangian</em> dynamics would have evolved that initial configuration, the singularity of the inner product along BRST exact degrees of freedom ensures that we will get the right entries for the physical scattering matrix.</p>

<p>(Actually, we should probably be constructing a <a href="Krein_space" title="wikilink">Krein space</a> for the BRST-closed intermediate Fock states, with the time reversal operator playing the role of the "fundamental symmetry" relating the Lorentz-invariant and positive semi-definite inner products. The asymptotic state space is presumably the Hilbert space obtained by quotienting BRST exact states out of this Krein space.)</p>

<p>In sum, no field introduced as part of a BRST gauge fixing procedure will appear in asymptotic states of the gauge-fixed theory. However, this does not imply that we can do without these "unphysical" fields in the intermediate states of a perturbative calculation! This is because perturbative calculations are done in the <a href="interaction_picture" title="wikilink">interaction picture</a>. They implicitly involve initial and final states of the non-interaction Hamiltonian

<p>T. Kugo and I. Ojima are commonly credited with the discovery of the principal QCD <a href="color_confinement" title="wikilink">color confinement</a> criterion. Their role in obtaining a correct version of the BRST formalism in the Lagrangian framework seems to be less widely appreciated. It is enlightening to inspect their variant of the BRST transformation, which emphasizes the <a href="hermitian_operator" title="wikilink">hermitian</a> properties of the newly introduced fields, before proceeding from an entirely geometrical angle. The gauge fixed Lagrangian density is below; the two terms in parentheses form the coupling between the gauge and ghost sectors, and the final term becomes a Gaussian weighting for the functional measure on the auxiliary field <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>Here we have omitted the details of the matter sector ψ and left the form of the Ward operator on it unspecified; these are unimportant so long as the representation of the gauge algebra on the matter fields is consistent with their coupling to δ<em>A</em><sub>μ</sub>. The properties of the other fields we have added are fundamentally analytical rather than geometric. The bias we have introduced towards connections with

<p>In order to do the BRST method justice, we must switch from the "algebra-valued fields on Minkowski space" picture typical of quantum field theory texts (and of the above exposition) to the language of <a href="fiber_bundle" title="wikilink">fiber bundles</a>, in which there are two quite different ways to look at a gauge transformation: as a change of <a href="Section_(fiber_bundle)#Local_and_global_sections" title="wikilink">local section</a> (also known in <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a> as a <a href="Active_and_passive_transformation" title="wikilink">passive transformation</a>) or as the <a href="pullback_(differential_geometry)" title="wikilink">pullback</a> of the field configuration along a <a href="vertical_diffeomorphism" title="wikilink">vertical diffeomorphism</a> of the <a href="principal_bundle" title="wikilink">principal bundle</a>. It is the latter sort of gauge transformation that enters into the BRST method. Unlike a passive transformation, it is well-defined globally on a principal bundle with any structure group over an arbitrary manifold. (However, for concreteness and relevance to conventional QFT, this article will stick to the case of a principal gauge bundle with compact fiber over 4-dimensional Minkowski space.)</p>

<p>A <a href="principal_gauge_bundle" title="wikilink">principal gauge bundle</a> <em>P</em> over a 4-manifold <em>M</em> is locally isomorphic to <em>U</em> × <em>F</em>, where <em>U</em> ⊂ <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup> and the <a href="fiber_bundle" title="wikilink">fiber</a> <em>F</em> is isomorphic to a <a href="Lie_group" title="wikilink">Lie group</a> <em>G</em>, the <a href="gauge_group" title="wikilink">gauge group</a> of the field theory (this is an isomorphism of manifold structures, not of group structures; there is no special surface in <em>P</em> corresponding to 1 in <em>G</em>, so it is more proper to say that the fiber <em>F</em> is a <em>G</em>-<a class="uri" href="torsor" title="wikilink">torsor</a>). Thus, the (physical) principal gauge bundle is related to the (mathematical) <a href="principal_bundle" title="wikilink">principal G-bundle</a> but has more structure. Its most basic property as a <a href="fiber_bundle" title="wikilink">fiber bundle</a> is the "projection to the base space" π : <em>P</em> → <em>M</em>, which defines the "vertical" directions on <em>P</em> (those lying within the fiber π<sup>−1</sup>(<em>p</em>) over each point <em>p</em> in <em>M</em>). As a <a href="gauge_bundle" title="wikilink">gauge bundle</a> it has a <a href="group_action" title="wikilink">left action</a> of <em>G</em> on <em>P</em> which respects the fiber structure, and as a <a href="principal_bundle" title="wikilink">principal bundle</a> it also has a <a href="group_action" title="wikilink">right action</a> of <em>G</em> on <em>P</em> which also respects the fiber structure and commutes with the left action.</p>

<p>The left action of the <a href="structure_group" title="wikilink">structure group</a> <em>G</em> on <em>P</em> corresponds to a mere change of <a href="coordinate_system" title="wikilink">coordinate system</a> on an individual fiber. The (global) right action <em>R<sub>g</sub></em> : <em>P</em> → <em>P</em> for a fixed <em>g</em> in <em>G</em> corresponds to an actual <a class="uri" href="automorphism" title="wikilink">automorphism</a> of each fiber and hence to a map of <em>P</em> to itself. In order for <em>P</em> to qualify as a principal <em>G</em>-bundle, the global right action of each <em>g</em> in <em>G</em> must be an automorphism with respect to the manifold structure of <em>P</em> with a smooth dependence on <em>g</em>—i. e., a diffeomorphism <em>P</em> × <em>G</em> → <em>P</em>.</p>

<p>The existence of the global right action of the structure group picks out a special class of <a href="right_invariant" title="wikilink">right invariant</a> geometric objects on <em>P</em>—those which do not change when they are <a href="Pullback_(differential_geometry)" title="wikilink">pulled back</a> along <em>R<sub>g</sub></em> for all values of <em>g</em> in <em>G</em>. The most important right invariant objects on a principal bundle are the right invariant <a href="vector_fields" title="wikilink">vector fields</a>, which form an <a href="Ideal_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">ideal</a>

<p>Identifying local gauge transformations with a particular subspace of vector fields on the manifold <em>P</em> equips us with a better framework for dealing with infinite-dimensional infinitesimals: <a href="differential_geometry" title="wikilink">differential geometry</a> and the <a href="exterior_calculus" title="wikilink">exterior calculus</a>. The change in a scalar field under pullback along an infinitesimal automorphism is captured in the <a href="Lie_derivative" title="wikilink">Lie derivative</a>, and the notion of retaining only the term linear in the scale of the vector field is implemented by separating it into the <a href="inner_derivative" title="wikilink">inner derivative</a> and the <a href="exterior_derivative" title="wikilink">exterior derivative</a>. (In this context, "forms" and the exterior calculus refer exclusively to degrees of freedom which are dual to vector fields <em>on the gauge bundle</em>, not to degrees of freedom expressed in (Greek) tensor indices on the base manifold or (Roman) matrix indices on the gauge algebra.)</p>

<p>The Lie derivative on a manifold is a globally well-defined operation in a way that the <a href="partial_derivative" title="wikilink">partial derivative</a> is not. The proper generalization of <a href="Clairaut's_theorem" title="wikilink">Clairaut's theorem</a> to the non-trivial manifold structure of <em>P</em> is given by the <a href="Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields" title="wikilink">Lie bracket of vector fields</a> and the <a class="uri" href="nilpotence" title="wikilink">nilpotence</a> of the <a href="exterior_derivative" title="wikilink">exterior derivative</a>. And we obtain an essential tool for computation: the <a href="generalized_Stokes_theorem" title="wikilink">generalized Stokes theorem</a>, which allows us to integrate by parts and drop the surface term as long as the integrand drops off rapidly enough in directions where there is an open boundary. (This is not a trivial assumption, but can be dealt with by <a class="uri" href="renormalization" title="wikilink">renormalization</a> techniques such as <a href="dimensional_regularization" title="wikilink">dimensional regularization</a> as long as the surface term can be made gauge invariant.)</p>
<h2 id="brst-formalism">BRST formalism</h2>

<p>In <a href="theoretical_physics" title="wikilink">theoretical physics</a>, the <strong>BRST formalism</strong> is a method of implementing <a href="first_class_constraint" title="wikilink">first class constraints</a>. The letters BRST stand for <a href="Carlo_Becchi" title="wikilink">Becchi</a>, Rouet, Stora, and (independently) Tyutin who discovered this formalism. It is a sophisticated method to deal with quantum physical theories with <a href="gauge_invariance" title="wikilink">gauge invariance</a>. For example, the BRST methods are often applied to <a href="Quantum_Yang-Mills_theory" title="wikilink">gauge theory</a> and quantized <a href="general_relativity" title="wikilink">general relativity</a>.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-version">Quantum version</h3>

<p>The space of states is not a Hilbert space (see below). This <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> is both <a href="graded_vector_space" title="wikilink"><strong>Z</strong><sub>2</sub>-graded</a> and <a href="graded_vector_space" title="wikilink"><strong>R</strong>-graded</a>. If you wish, you may think of it as a <strong>Z</strong><sub>2</sub> × <strong>R</strong>-<a href="graded_vector_space" title="wikilink">graded vector space</a>. The former grading is the parity, which can either be even or odd. The latter grading is the <a href="ghost_number" title="wikilink">ghost number</a>. Note that it is <strong>R</strong> and not <strong>Z</strong> because unlike the classical case, we can have nonintegral ghost numbers. Operators acting upon this space are also <strong>Z</strong><sub>2</sub> × <strong>R</strong>-<a href="graded_algebra" title="wikilink">graded</a> in the obvious manner. In particular, <em>Q</em> is odd and has a ghost number of 1.</p>

<p>Let <em>H<sub>n</sub></em> be the subspace of all states with ghost number <em>n</em>. Then, <em>Q</em> restricted to <em>H<sub>n</sub></em> maps <em>H<sub>n</sub></em> to <em>H</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>. Since <em>Q</em><sup>2</sup> = 0, we have a <a href="cochain_complex" title="wikilink">cochain complex</a> describing a <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a>.</p>

<p>The physical states are identified as elements of <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a> of the operator <em>Q</em>, i.e. as vectors in Ker(<em>Q</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>)/Im(<em>Q<sub>n</sub></em>). The BRST theory is in fact linked to the <a href="standard_resolution" title="wikilink">standard resolution</a> in <a href="Lie_algebra_cohomology" title="wikilink">Lie algebra cohomology</a>.</p>

<p>Recall that the space of states is <strong>Z</strong><sub>2</sub>-graded. If <em>A</em> is a pure graded operator, then the BRST transformation maps <em>A</em> to [<em>Q</em>, <em>A</em>) where [ , ) is the <a class="uri" href="supercommutator" title="wikilink">supercommutator</a>. BRST-invariant operators are operators for which [<em>Q</em>, <em>A</em>) = 0. Since the operators are also graded by ghost numbers, this BRST transformation also forms a cohomology for the operators since [<em>Q</em>, [<em>Q</em>, <em>A</em>)) = 0.</p>

<p>Although the BRST formalism is more general than the <a href="Faddeev-Popov_gauge_fixing" title="wikilink">Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing</a>, in the special case where it is derived from it, the BRST operator is also useful to obtain the right <a href="Jacobian_variety" title="wikilink">Jacobian</a> associated with constraints that gauge-fix the symmetry.</p>

<p>The BRST is a <a class="uri" href="supersymmetry" title="wikilink">supersymmetry</a>. It generates the <a href="Lie_superalgebra" title="wikilink">Lie superalgebra</a> with a zero-dimensional even part and a one-dimensional odd part spanned by <em>Q</em>. [<em>Q</em>, <em>Q</em>) = {<em>Q</em>, <em>Q</em>} = 0 where [ , ) is the <a href="Lie_superalgebra" title="wikilink">Lie superbracket</a> (i.e. <em>Q</em><sup>2</sup> = 0). This means <em>Q</em> acts as an <a class="uri" href="antiderivation" title="wikilink">antiderivation</a>.</p>

<p>Because <em>Q</em> is <a href="Hermitian_operator" title="wikilink">Hermitian</a> and its square is zero but <em>Q</em> itself is nonzero, this means the vector space of all states prior to the cohomological reduction has an <a href="Positive_definiteness" title="wikilink">indefinite norm</a>! This means it is not a <a href="Hilbert_space" title="wikilink">Hilbert space</a>.</p>

<li>Chapter 16 of Peskin &amp; Schroeder (ISBN 0-201-50397-2 or ISBN 0-201-50934-2) applies the "BRST symmetry" to reason about anomaly cancellation in the Faddeev–Popov Lagrangian. This is a good start for QFT non-experts, although the connections to geometry are omitted and the treatment of asymptotic Fock space is only a sketch.</li>
<li>Chapter 12 of M. Göckeler and T. Schücker (ISBN 0-521-37821-4 or ISBN 0-521-32960-4) discusses the relationship between the BRST formalism and the geometry of gauge bundles. It is substantially similar to <a href="http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.cmp/1104116716">Schücker's 1987 paper</a>.</li>
