   The Whetstone of Witte      The Whetstone of Witte    The Whetstone of Witte is the shortened title of Robert Recorde 's mathematics book published in 1557, the full title being ' The whetstone of witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmetike: containyng thextraction of Rootes: The Coßike practise, with the rule of Equation : and the woorkes of Surde Nombers '. The book covers topics including whole numbers, the extraction of roots and irrational numbers. 1 The work is notable for containing the first recorded use of the equals sign 2 and also for being the first book in English to use the plus and minus signs . 3  Recordian notation for exponentiation , however, differed from the later Cartesian notation     p  q   =     p  ×  p  ×  p   ⋯   ×  p        superscript  p  q         p  p  p   normal-⋯   p     p^{q}=p\times p\times p\cdots\times p   . Recorde expressed indices and surds larger than 3 in a systematic form based on the prime factorization of the exponent: a factor of two he termed a zenzic , and a factor of three, a cubic . Recorde termed the larger prime numbers appearing in this factorization sursolids , distinguishing between them by use of ordinal numbers: that is, he defined 5 as the first sursolid and 7 as the second sursolid . 4 He also devised symbols for these factors: a zenzic was denoted by z , and a cubic by & . For instance, he referred to p 8 =p 2×2×2 as p zzz ' (the zenzizenzizenzic of p ), and q 12 =q 2×2×3 as ''q zz&''' (the zenzizenzicubic of q ). 5  References  External links   The Whetstone of Witte at The Internet Archive   "  Category:Mathematics books  Category:British non-fiction literature  Category:1557 books     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  , p. 180. ↩  , p. 184. ↩
