   Second derivative test      Second derivative test   In calculus , the second derivative test is a criterion for determining whether a given critical point of a real function of one variable is a local maximum or a local minimum using the value of the second derivative at the point.  The test states: if the function f is twice differentiable at a critical point x (i.e. f'(x) = 0 ), then:   If       f   ′′    (  x  )    <  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    \ f^{\prime\prime}(x)<0   then    f    f   \ f   has a local maximum at    x    x   \ x   .  If       f   ′′    (  x  )    >  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    \ f^{\prime\prime}(x)>0   then    f    f   \ f   has a local minimum at    x    x   \ x   .  If       f   ′′    (  x  )    =  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    \ f^{\prime\prime}(x)=0   , the test is inconclusive.   In the latter case, Taylor's Theorem may be used to determine the behavior of f near x using higher derivatives .  Multivariable case  For a function of more than one variable, the second derivative test generalizes to a test based on the eigenvalues of the function's Hessian matrix at the critical point. In particular, assuming that all second order partial derivatives of f are continuous on a neighbourhood of a critical point x , then if the eigenvalues of the Hessian at x are all positive, then x is a local minimum. If the eigenvalues are all negative, then x is a local maximum, and if some are positive and some negative, then the point is a saddle point . If the Hessian matrix is singular , then the second derivative test is inconclusive.  Proof of the second derivative test  Suppose we have      f  ′′    (  x  )    >  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    f^{\prime\prime}(x)>0   (the proof for      f  ′′    (  x  )    <  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    f^{\prime\prime}(x)<0   is analogous). By assumption,      f  ′    (  x  )    =  0         superscript  f  normal-′   x   0    f^{\prime}(x)=0   . Then       0  <    f  ′′    (  x  )    =    lim   h  →  0        f  ′    (   x  +  h   )    -    f  ′    (  x  )     h    =    lim   h  →  0        f  ′    (   x  +  h   )    -  0   h    =    lim   h  →  0       f  ′    (   x  +  h   )    h     .        0     superscript  f  ′′   x          subscript    normal-→  h  0           superscript  f  normal-′     x  h       superscript  f  normal-′   x    h           subscript    normal-→  h  0           superscript  f  normal-′     x  h    0   h           subscript    normal-→  h  0         superscript  f  normal-′     x  h    h       0     Thus, for h sufficiently small we get         f  ′    (   x  +  h   )    h   >  0           superscript  f  normal-′     x  h    h   0    \frac{f^{\prime}(x+h)}{h}>0   which means that      f  ′    (   x  +  h   )    <  0         superscript  f  normal-′     x  h    0    f^{\prime}(x+h)<0   if h f'(x+h) > 0 if h > 0 (intuitively, f is increasing as we go right from x ). Now, by the first derivative test ,   f   f   f   has a local minimum at   x   x   x   .  Concavity test  A related but distinct use of second derivatives is to determine whether a function is concave up or concave down at a point. It does not, however, provide information about inflection points . Specifically, a twice-differentiable function f is concave up if       f   ′′    (  x  )    >  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    \ f^{\prime\prime}(x)>0   and concave down if       f   ′′    (  x  )    <  0         superscript  f  ′′   x   0    \ f^{\prime\prime}(x)<0   . Note that if      f    (  x  )    =   x  4         f  x    superscript  x  4     \ f(x)=x^{4}   , then     x   =  0      x  0    \ x=0   has zero second derivative, yet is not an inflection point, so the second derivative alone does not give enough information to determine if a given point is an inflection point.
