   N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D      N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D   N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (, NAPE-PLD , anandamide-generating phospholipase D , N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D , NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D ) is an enzyme with system name N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidohydrolase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    N-acylethanolamine + a 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-phosphate   This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of anandamide .
