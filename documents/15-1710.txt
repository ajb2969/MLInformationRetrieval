N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D

N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (, NAPE-PLD, anandamide-generating phospholipase D, N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D, NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D) is an enzyme with system name N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidohydrolase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine + H2O 
 
 
N-acylethanolamine + a 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-phosphate
 

This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of anandamide.
