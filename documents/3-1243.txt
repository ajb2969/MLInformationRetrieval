   Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry      Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry   This is a glossary of some terms used in Riemannian geometry and metric geometry — it doesn't cover the terminology of differential topology .  The following articles may also be useful; they either contain specialised vocabulary or provide more detailed expositions of the definitions given below.   Connection  Curvature  Metric space  Riemannian manifold   See also:   Glossary of general topology  Glossary of differential geometry and topology  List of differential geometry topics   Unless stated otherwise, letters X , Y , Z below denote metric spaces, M , N denote Riemannian manifolds, | xy | or     |   x  y   |   X     subscript      x  y    X    |xy|_{X}   denotes the distance between points x and y in X . Italic word denotes a self-reference to this glossary.  A caveat : many terms in Riemannian and metric geometry, such as convex function , convex set and others, do not have exactly the same meaning as in general mathematical usage.  __NOTOC__  A  Alexandrov space a generalization of Riemannian manifolds with upper, lower or integral curvature bounds (the last one works only in dimension 2)  Almost flat manifold  Arc-wise isometry the same as path isometry .

Cartan extended Einstein's General relativity to Einstein-Cartan theory , using Riemannian-Cartan geometry instead of Riemannian geometry. This extension provides affine torsion , which allows for non-symmetric curvature tensors and the incorporation of spin-orbit coupling .  Center of mass . A point q ∈ M is called the center of mass of the points     p  1   ,   p  2   ,  …  ,   p  k       subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-…   subscript  p  k     p_{1},p_{2},\dots,p_{k}   if it is a point of global minimum of the function       f   (  x  )    =    ∑  i     |    p  i   x   |   2          f  x     subscript   i    superscript       subscript  p  i   x    2      f(x)=\sum_{i}|p_{i}x|^{2}     Such a point is unique if all distances    |    p  i    p  j    |         subscript  p  i    subscript  p  j      |p_{i}p_{j}|   are less than radius of convexity .  Christoffel symbol  Collapsing manifold  Complete space  Completion  Conformal map is a map which preserves angles.  Conformally flat a M is conformally flat if it is locally conformally equivalent to a Euclidean space, for example standard sphere is conformally flat.  Conjugate points two points p and q on a geodesic   γ   γ   \gamma   are called conjugate if there is a Jacobi field on   γ   γ   \gamma   which has a zero at p and q .  Convex function . A function f on a Riemannian manifold is a convex if for any geodesic   γ   γ   \gamma   the function    f  ∘  γ      f  γ    f\circ\gamma   is convex . A function f is called   λ   λ   \lambda   -convex if for any geodesic   γ   γ   \gamma   with natural parameter   t   t   t   , the function      f  ∘  γ    (  t  )    -   λ   t  2            f  γ   t     λ   superscript  t  2      f\circ\gamma(t)-\lambda t^{2}   is convex .

H  Hadamard space is a complete simply connected space with nonpositive curvature.  Horosphere a level set of Busemann function .  I  Injectivity radius The injectivity radius at a point p of a Riemannian manifold is the largest radius for which the exponential map at p is a diffeomorphism . The injectivity radius of a Riemannian manifold is the infimum of the injectivity radii at all points. See also cut locus .  For complete manifolds, if the injectivity radius at p is a finite number r , then either there is a geodesic of length 2 r which starts and ends at p or there is a point q conjugate to p (see conjugate point above) and on the distance r from p . For a closed Riemannian manifold the injectivity radius is either half the minimal length of a closed geodesic or the minimal distance between conjugate points on a geodesic.  Infranilmanifold Given a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N acting on itself by left multiplication and a finite group of automorphisms F of N one can define an action of the semidirect product     N  ⋊  F     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  N  F    N\rtimes F   on N . An orbit space of N by a discrete subgroup of    N  ⋊  F     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  N  F    N\rtimes F   which acts freely on N is called an infranilmanifold . An infranilmanifold is finitely covered by a nilmanifold.  Isometry is a map which preserves distances.  Intrinsic metric  J  Jacobi field A Jacobi field is a vector field on a geodesic γ which can be obtained on the following way: Take a smooth one parameter family of geodesics    γ  τ     subscript  γ  τ    \gamma_{\tau}   with     γ  0   =  γ       subscript  γ  0   γ    \gamma_{0}=\gamma   , then the Jacobi field is described by        J   (  t  )    =       ∂   γ  τ     (  t  )    /   ∂  τ    |    τ  =  0     .

N  Natural parametrization is the parametrization by length.  Net . A sub set S of a metric space X is called   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   -net if for any point in X there is a point in S on the distance     ≤  ϵ      absent  ϵ    \leq\epsilon   . This is distinct from topological nets which generalise limits.  Nilmanifold : An element of the minimal set of manifolds which includes a point, and has the following property: any oriented    S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   -bundle over a nilmanifold is a nilmanifold. It also can be defined as a factor of a connected nilpotent  Lie group by a lattice .  Normal bundle : associated to an imbedding of a manifold M into an ambient Euclidean space    ℝ  N     superscript  ℝ  N    {\mathbb{R}}^{N}   , the normal bundle is a vector bundle whose fiber at each point p is the orthogonal complement (in    ℝ  N     superscript  ℝ  N    {\mathbb{R}}^{N}   ) of the tangent space     T  p   M       subscript  T  p   M    T_{p}M   .  Nonexpanding map same as short map  P  Parallel transport  Polyhedral space a simplicial complex with a metric such that each simplex with induced metric is isometric to a simplex in Euclidean space .  Principal curvature is the maximum and minimum normal curvatures at a point on a surface.  Principal direction is the direction of the principal curvatures.  Path isometry  Proper metric space is a metric space in which every closed ball is compact . Every proper metric space is complete .  Q  Quasigeodesic has two meanings; here we give the most common. A map    f  :   𝐑  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  R  Y     f:\textbf{R}\to Y   is called quasigeodesic if there are constants    K  >  0      K  0    K>0   and    C  ≥  0      C  0    C\geq 0   such that          1  K   d   (  x  ,  y  )    -  C   ≤   d   (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    ≤    K  d   (  x  ,  y  )    +  C    .              1  K   d   x  y    C     d     f  x     f  y              K  d   x  y    C      {1\over K}d(x,y)-C\leq d(f(x),f(y))\leq Kd(x,y)+C.   Note that a quasigeodesic is not necessarily a continuous curve.  Quasi-isometry . A map    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is called a quasi-isometry if there are constants    K  ≥  1      K  1    K\geq 1   and    C  ≥  0      C  0    C\geq 0   such that          1  K   d   (  x  ,  y  )    -  C   ≤   d   (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    ≤    K  d   (  x  ,  y  )    +  C    .              1  K   d   x  y    C     d     f  x     f  y              K  d   x  y    C      {1\over K}d(x,y)-C\leq d(f(x),f(y))\leq Kd(x,y)+C.   and every point in Y has distance at most C from some point of f ( X ). Note that a quasi-isometry is not assumed to be continuous, for example any map between compact metric spaces is a quasi isometry. If there exists a quasi-isometry from X to Y, then X and Y are said to be quasi-isometric .  R  Radius of metric space is the infimum of radii of metric balls which contain the space completely.  Radius of convexity at a point p of a Riemannian manifold is the largest radius of a ball which is a convex subset.  Ray is a one side infinite geodesic which is minimizing on each interval  Riemann curvature tensor  Riemannian manifold  Riemannian submersion is a map between Riemannian manifolds which is submersion and submetry at the same time.  S  Second fundamental form is a quadratic form on the tangent space of hypersurface, usually denoted by II, an equivalent way to describe the shape operator of a hypersurface,       II   (  v  ,  w  )    =   ⟨   S   (  v  )    ,  w  ⟩         II   v  w       S  v   w     \text{II}(v,w)=\langle S(v),w\rangle   It can be also generalized to arbitrary codimension, in which case it is a quadratic form with values in the normal space.  Shape operator for a hypersurface M is a linear operator on tangent spaces, S p : T p M → T p M . If n is a unit normal field to M and v is a tangent vector then       S   (  v  )    =   ±    ∇  v   n          S  v    plus-or-minus    subscript  normal-∇  v   n      S(v)=\pm\nabla_{v}n   (there is no standard agreement whether to use + or − in the definition).  Short map is a distance non increasing map.  Smooth manifold  Sol manifold is a factor of a connected solvable Lie group by a lattice .  Submetry a short map f between metric spaces is called a submetry if there exists R > 0 such that for any point x and radius ''r f(B_r(x))=B_r(f(x)) \,\!  Sub-Riemannian manifold  Systole . The k -systole of M ,    s  y  s   t  k    (  M  )       s  y  s   subscript  t  k   M    syst_{k}(M)   , is the minimal volume of k -cycle nonhomologous to zero.  T  Tangent bundle  Totally convex. A subset K of a Riemannian manifold M is called totally convex if for any two points in K any geodesic connecting them lies entirely in K , see also convex .  Totally geodesic submanifold is a submanifold such that all geodesics in the submanifold are also geodesics of the surrounding manifold.  U  Uniquely geodesic metric space is a metric space where any two points are the endpoints of a unique minimizing geodesic .  W  Word metric on a group is a metric of the Cayley graph constructed using a set of generators.  "  Geometry  *  *
