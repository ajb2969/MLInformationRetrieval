   Beta-diketone hydrolase      Beta-diketone hydrolase   In enzymology , a beta-diketone hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   nonane-4,6-dione + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pentan-2-one + butanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nonane-4,6-dione and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-pentanone and butanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nonane-4,6-dione acylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called oxidized PVA hydrolase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
