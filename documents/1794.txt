   Pochhammer k-symbol      Pochhammer k-symbol   In the mathematical theory of special functions , the Pochhammer k -symbol and the k -gamma function , introduced by Rafael Díaz and Eddy Pariguan, 1 are generalizations of the Pochhammer symbol and gamma function . They differ from the Pochhammer symbol and gamma function in that they can be related to a general arithmetic progression in the same manner as those are related to the sequence of consecutive integers .  The Pochhammer k -symbol ( x ) n,k is defined as         (  x  )    n  ,  k    =   x   (   x  +  k   )    (   x  +   2  k    )   ⋯   (   x  +    (   n  -  1   )   k    )     ,       subscript  x   n  k      x    x  k     x    2  k    normal-⋯    x      n  1   k       (x)_{n,k}=x(x+k)(x+2k)\cdots(x+(n-1)k),\,     and the k -gamma function Γ k , with k > 0, is defined as         Γ  k    (  x  )    =    lim   n  →  ∞       n  !    k  n     (   n  k   )     x  /  k   -  1       (  x  )    n  ,  k       .         subscript  normal-Γ  k   x     subscript    normal-→  n           n    superscript  k  n    superscript    n  k       x  k   1      subscript  x   n  k        \Gamma_{k}(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n!k^{n}(nk)^{x/k-1}}{(x)_{n,k}}.     When k = 1 the standard Pochhammer symbol and gamma function are obtained.  Díaz and Pariguan use these definitions to demonstrate a number of properties of the hypergeometric function . Although Díaz and Pariguan restrict these symbols to k > 0, the Pochhammer k -symbol as they define it is well-defined for all real k, and for negative k gives the falling factorial , while for k = 0 it reduces to the power  x n .  The Díaz and Pariguan paper does not address the many analogies between the Pochhammer k -symbol and the power function, such as the fact that the binomial theorem can be extended to Pochhammer k -symbols. It is true, however, that many equations involving the power function x n continue to hold when x n is replaced by ( x ) n,k .
