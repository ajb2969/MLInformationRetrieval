Conductor-discriminant formula

In mathematics, the conductor-discriminant formula or FÃ¼hrerdiskriminantenproduktformel, introduced by  for abelian extensions and by  for Galois extensions, is a formula calculating the relative discriminant of a finite Galois extension 
 
 
 
  of local or global fields from the Artin conductors of the irreducible characters

 
  of the Galois group

 
 .
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite Galois extension of global fields with Galois group 
 
 
 
 . Then the discriminant equals








where 
 
 
 
  equals the global Artin conductor of 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  be a cyclotomic extension of the rationals. The Galois group 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 
 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  is the only finite prime ramified, the global Artin conductor 
 
 
 
  equals the local one 
 
 
 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  is abelian, every non-trivial irreducible character 
 
 
 
  is of degree 
 
 
 
 . Then, the local Artin conductor of 
 
 
 
  equals the conductor of the 
 
 
 
 -adic completion of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the smallest natural number such that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , the Galois group 
 
 
 
  is cyclic of order 
 
 
 
 , and by local class field theory and using that 
 
 
 
  one sees easily that 
 
 
 
 : the exponent is
