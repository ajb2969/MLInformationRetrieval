Inada conditions

In macroeconomics, the Inada conditions, named after Japanese economist Ken-Ichi Inada,1 are assumptions about the shape of a production function that guarantee the stability of an economic growth path in a neoclassical growth model. The conditions as such had been introduced by Hirofumi Uzawa.2
The six conditions for a given function 
 
 
 
  are:

the value of the function 
 
 
 
  at 0 is 0
 
 

the function is continuously differentiable,
the function is strictly increasing in 
 
 

 
 ,
the second derivative of the function is negative in 
 
 
 
  (thus the function is concave)
 
 
 
 ,
the limit of the first derivative is positive infinity as 
 
 
 
  approaches 0
 
 
 
 ,
the limit of the first derivative is zero as 
 
 
 
  approaches positive infinity
 
 


It can be shown that the Inada conditions imply that the elasticity of substitution is asymptotically equal to one (although the production function is not necessarily asymptotically Cobb–Douglas).34
In stochastic neoclassical growth model, if the production function does not satisfy the Inada condition at zero, any feasible path converges to zero with probability one provided that the shocks are sufficiently volatile.5
