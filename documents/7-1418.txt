   Inada conditions      Inada conditions   In macroeconomics , the Inada conditions , named after Japanese economist Ken-Ichi Inada , 1 are assumptions about the shape of a production function that guarantee the stability of an economic growth path in a neoclassical growth model . The conditions as such had been introduced by Hirofumi Uzawa . 2  The six conditions for a given function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   are:   the value of the function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   at 0 is 0     f   (  0  )    =  0        f  0   0    f(0)=0     the function is continuously differentiable ,  the function is strictly increasing in    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}          ∂  f    (  x  )    /   ∂   x  i     >  0            f   x      subscript  x  i     0    \partial f(x)/\partial x_{i}>0   ,  the second derivative of the function is negative in    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   (thus the function is concave )        ∂  2   f    (  x  )    /   ∂   x  i  2     <  0            superscript   2   f   x      superscript   subscript  x  i   2     0    \partial^{2}f(x)/\partial x_{i}^{2}<0   ,  the limit of the first derivative is positive infinity as    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   approaches 0      lim    x  i   →  0       ∂  f    (  x  )    /   ∂   x  i      =   +  ∞         subscript    normal-→   subscript  x  i   0          f   x      subscript  x  i            \lim_{x_{i}\to 0}\partial f(x)/\partial x_{i}=+\infty   ,  the limit of the first derivative is zero as    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   approaches positive infinity      lim    x  i   →   +  ∞        ∂  f    (  x  )    /   ∂   x  i      =  0        subscript    normal-→   subscript  x  i               f   x      subscript  x  i      0    \lim_{x_{i}\to+\infty}\partial f(x)/\partial x_{i}=0      It can be shown that the Inada conditions imply that the elasticity of substitution is asymptotically equal to one (although the production function is not necessarily asymptotically Cobb–Douglas ). 3 4  In stochastic neoclassical growth model , if the production function does not satisfy the Inada condition at zero, any feasible path converges to zero with probability one provided that the shocks are sufficiently volatile. 5  References  Further reading       "  Category:Economic growth     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
