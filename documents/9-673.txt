   Posynomial      Posynomial   A posynomial , also known as a posinomial in some literature, is a function of the form       f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    ∑   k  =  1   K     c  k    x  1   a   1  k     ⋯   x  n   a   n  k             f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       superscript   subscript     k  1    K      subscript  c  k    superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  a    1  k     normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  a    n  k         f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}c_{k}x_{1}^{a_{1k}}\cdots x_{n}^{a_{%
 nk}}     where all the coordinates    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   and coefficients    c  k     subscript  c  k    c_{k}   are positive real numbers , and the exponents    a   i  k      subscript  a    i  k     a_{ik}   are real numbers. Posynomials are closed under addition, multiplication, and nonnegative scaling.  For example,       f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =    2.7   x  1  2    x  2   -   1  /  3      x  3  0.7    +   2   x  1   -  4     x  3   2  /  5            f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3         2.7   superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2       1  3      superscript   subscript  x  3   0.7      2   superscript   subscript  x  1     4     superscript   subscript  x  3     2  5        f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=2.7x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{-1/3}x_{3}^{0.7}+2x_{1}^{-4}x_{3}^{2/5}     is a posynomial.  Posynomials are not the same as polynomials in several independent variables. A polynomial's exponents must be non-negative integers, but its independent variables and coefficients can be arbitrary real numbers; on the other hand, a posynomial's exponents can be arbitrary real numbers, but its independent variables and coefficients must be positive real numbers. This terminology was introduced by Richard J. Duffin , Elmor L. Peterson, and Clarence Zener in their seminal book on Geometric programming .  References              External links   S. Boyd, S. J.
