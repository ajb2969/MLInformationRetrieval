Posynomial

A posynomial, also known as a posinomial in some literature, is a function of the form



where all the coordinates 
 
 
 
  and coefficients 
 
 
 
  are positive real numbers, and the exponents 
 
 
 
  are real numbers. Posynomials are closed under addition, multiplication, and nonnegative scaling.
For example,



is a posynomial.
Posynomials are not the same as polynomials in several independent variables. A polynomial's exponents must be non-negative integers, but its independent variables and coefficients can be arbitrary real numbers; on the other hand, a posynomial's exponents can be arbitrary real numbers, but its independent variables and coefficients must be positive real numbers. This terminology was introduced by Richard J. Duffin, Elmor L. Peterson, and Clarence Zener in their seminal book on Geometric programming.
