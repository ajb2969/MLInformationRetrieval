   Triakis octahedron      Triakis octahedron   In geometry , a triakis octahedron (or kisoctahedron 1 ) is an Archimedean dual solid, or a Catalan solid . Its dual is the truncated cube .  It can be seen as an octahedron with triangular pyramids added to each face; that is, it is the Kleetope of the octahedron. It is also sometimes called a trisoctahedron , or, more fully, trigonal trisoctahedron . Both names reflect the fact that it has three triangular faces for every face of an octahedron. The tetragonal trisoctahedron is another name for the deltoidal icositetrahedron , a different polyhedron with three quadrilateral faces for every face of an octahedron.  This convex polyhedron is topologically similar to the concave stellated octahedron . They have the same face connectivity, but the vertices are in different relative distances from the center.  If its shorter edges have length 1, its surface area and volume are:      A  =   3    7  +   4   2           A    3      7    4    2         A=3\sqrt{7+4\sqrt{2}}          V  =    1  2    (   3  +   2   2     )     .

Orthogonal projections  The triakis octahedron has three symmetry positions, two located on vertices, and one mid-edge:      Orthogonal projections     Projective symmetry     Triakis octahedron     Truncated cube     Cultural references   A triakis octahedron is a vital element in the plot of cult author Hugh Cook 's novel The Wishstone and the Wonderworkers .   Related polyhedra  The triakis octahedron is one of a family of duals to the uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.  The triakis octahedron is a part of a sequence of polyhedra and tilings, extending into the hyperbolic plane. These face-transitive figures have (*n32) reflectional symmetry .  The triakis octahedron is also a part of a sequence of polyhedra and tilings, extending into the hyperbolic plane. These face-transitive figures have (*n42) reflectional symmetry .
