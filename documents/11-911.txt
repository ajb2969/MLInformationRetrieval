Glucarolactone O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase




Glucarolactone O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase

In enzymology, a glucarolactone O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sinapoyl-CoA + glucarolactone 
 
 
 
  CoA + O-sinapoylglucarolactone
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sinapoyl-CoA and glucarolactone, whereas its two products are CoA and O-sinapoylglucarolactone.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sinapoyl-CoA:glucarolactone O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase.
