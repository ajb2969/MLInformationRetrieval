Liberman's lemma

Liberman's lemma is a theorem used in studying intrinsic geometry of convex surface. It is named after Joseph Liberman.
Formulation
If 
 
 
 
  is a unit-speed minimizing geodesic on the surface of a convex body K in Euclidean space then for any point p ∈ K, the function



is concave.
