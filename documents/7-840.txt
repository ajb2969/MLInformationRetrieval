Dinatural transformation

In category theory, a dinatural transformation

 
  between two functors



written



is a function which to every object c of C associates an arrow


 
  of X
and satisfies the following coherence property: for every morphism 
 
 
 
  of C the diagram  commutes.
The composition of two dinatural transformations need not be dinatural.
