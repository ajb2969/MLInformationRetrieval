   Polysaccharide O-methyltransferase      Polysaccharide O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a polysaccharide O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 1,4-alpha-D-glucooligosaccharide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + oligosaccharide containing 6-methyl-D-glucose units   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 1,4-alpha-D-glucooligosaccharide , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and oligosaccharide containing 6-methyl-D-glucose units .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 6-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include polysaccharide methyltransferase , and acylpolysacharide 6-methyltransferase .
