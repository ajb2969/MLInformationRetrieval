   Rational singularity      Rational singularity   In mathematics , more particularly in the field of algebraic geometry , a scheme    X   X   X   has rational singularities , if it is normal , of finite type over a field of characteristic zero, and there exists a proper  birational map      f  :   Y  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  Y  X     f\colon Y\rightarrow X     from a regular scheme    Y   Y   Y   such that the higher direct images of    f  *     subscript  f     f_{*}   applied to    𝒪  Y     subscript  𝒪  Y    \mathcal{O}_{Y}   are trivial. That is,        R  i    f  *    𝒪  Y    =  0         superscript  R  i    subscript  f     subscript  𝒪  Y    0    R^{i}f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}=0   for    i  >  0      i  0    i>0   .  If there is one such resolution, then it follows that all resolutions share this property, since any two resolutions of singularities can be dominated by a third.  For surfaces, rational singularities were defined by .  Formulations  Alternately, one can say that   X   X   X   has rational singularities if and only if the natural map in the derived category       𝒪  X   →   R   f  *    𝒪  Y       normal-→   subscript  𝒪  X     R   subscript  f     subscript  𝒪  Y      \mathcal{O}_{X}\rightarrow Rf_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}   is a quasi-isomorphism . Notice that this includes the statement that     𝒪  X   ≃    f  *    𝒪  Y       similar-to-or-equals   subscript  𝒪  X      subscript  f     subscript  𝒪  Y      \mathcal{O}_{X}\simeq f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{Y}   and hence the assumption that   X   X   X   is normal.  There are related notions in positive and mixed characteristic of   pseudo-rational   and   F-rational   Rational singularities are in particular Cohen-Macaulay , normal and Du Bois . They need not be Gorenstein or even Q-Gorenstein .  Log terminal singularities are rational.  Examples  An example of a rational singularity is the singular point of the quadric cone        x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    =   0.          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2    0.    x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=0.\,   showed that the rational double points of a algebraic surfaces are the Du Val singularities .
