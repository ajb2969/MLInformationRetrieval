Rational singularity

In mathematics, more particularly in the field of algebraic geometry, a scheme

 
  has rational singularities, if it is normal, of finite type over a field of characteristic zero, and there exists a proper birational map



from a regular scheme

 
  such that the higher direct images of 
 
 
 
 
  applied to 
 
 
 
  are trivial. That is,


 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
If there is one such resolution, then it follows that all resolutions share this property, since any two resolutions of singularities can be dominated by a third.
For surfaces, rational singularities were defined by .
Formulations
Alternately, one can say that 
 
 
 
  has rational singularities if and only if the natural map in the derived category


 
  is a quasi-isomorphism. Notice that this includes the statement that 
 
 
 
  and hence the assumption that 
 
 
 
  is normal.
There are related notions in positive and mixed characteristic of

pseudo-rational

and

F-rational

Rational singularities are in particular Cohen-Macaulay, normal and Du Bois. They need not be Gorenstein or even Q-Gorenstein.
Log terminal singularities are rational.
Examples
An example of a rational singularity is the singular point of the quadric cone


 
   showed that the rational double points of a algebraic surfaces are the Du Val singularities.
