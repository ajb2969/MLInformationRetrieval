Finite Fourier transform

In mathematics the finite Fourier transform may refer to either

another name for the discrete Fourier transform1

or

another name for the Fourier series coefficients2

or

a transform based on a Fourier-transform-like integral applied to a function 
 
 
 
 , but with integration only on a finite interval, usually taken to be the interval 
 
 
 
 .3 Equivalently, it is the Fourier transform of a function 
 
 
 
  multiplied by a rectangular window function. That is, the finite Fourier transform 
 
 
 
  of a function 
 
 
 
  on the finite interval 
 
 
 
  is given by:
