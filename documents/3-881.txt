   Finite Fourier transform      Finite Fourier transform   In mathematics the finite Fourier transform may refer to either   another name for the discrete Fourier transform 1   or   another name for the Fourier series coefficients 2   or   a transform based on a Fourier-transform-like integral applied to a function    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   , but with integration only on a finite interval, usually taken to be the interval    [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   . 3 Equivalently, it is the Fourier transform of a function    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   multiplied by a rectangular window function . That is, the finite Fourier transform    X   (  ω  )       X  ω    X(\omega)   of a function    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   on the finite interval    [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   is given by:        X   (  ω  )    =    1    2  π       ∫  0  T    x   (  t  )     e   -   i  ω  t      d  t           X  ω       1      2  π       superscript   subscript   0   T     x  t   superscript  e      i  ω  t     d  t       X(\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{T}x(t)e^{-i\omega t}\,dt     References  "     J.
