200xp| The bivariate (Deming regression) case of Total Least Squares. The red lines show the error in both x and y. This is different from the traditional least squares method which measures error parallel to the y axis. The case shown, with deviations measured perpendicularly, arises when x and y have equal variances.

Total least squares also known as (in a special case) orthogonal regression, is a type of errors-in-variables regression, a least squares data modeling technique in which observational errors on both dependent and independent variables are taken into account. It is a generalization of Deming regression, and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.
The total least squares approximation of the data is generically equivalent to the best, in the Frobenius norm, low-rank approximation of the data matrix.1
Linear model
Background
In the least squares method of data modeling, the objective function, S,


 
  is minimized, where r is the vector of residuals and W is a weighting matrix. In linear least squares the model contains equations which are linear in the parameters appearing in the parameter vector 
 
 
 
 , so the residuals are given by


 
  There are m observations in y and n parameters in β with m>n. X is a m×n matrix whose elements are either constants or functions of the independent variables, x. The weight matrix W is, ideally, the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix

 
  of the observations y. The independent variables are assumed to be error-free. The parameter estimates are found by setting the gradient equations to zero, which results in the normal equations 2



Allowing observation errors in all variables
Now, suppose that both x and y are observed subject to error, with variance-covariance matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. In this case the objective function can be written as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the residuals in x and y respectively. Clearly these residuals cannot be independent of each other, but they must be constrained by some kind of relationship. Writing the model function as 
 
 
 
 , the constraints are expressed by m condition equations.3


 
  Thus, the problem is to minimize the objective function subject to the m constraints. It is solved by the use of Lagrange multipliers. After some algebraic manipulations,4 the result is obtained.


 
 , or alternatively 
 
 
 
  Where M is the variance-covariance matrix relative to both independent and dependent variables.



Example
In practice these equations are easy to use. When the data errors are uncorrelated, all matrices M and W are diagonal. Then, take the example of straight line fitting.


 
  It is easy to show that, in this case


 
  showing how the variance at the ith point is determined by the variances of both independent and dependent variables and by the model being used to fit the data. The expression may be generalized by noting that the parameter 
 
 
 
  is the slope of the line.



An expression of this type is used in fitting pH titration data where a small error on x translates to a large error on y when the slope is large.
Algebraic point of view
First of all it is necessary to note that the TLS problem does not have a solution in general, which was already shown in 1980.5 The following considers the simple case where a unique solution exists without making any particular assumptions.
The computation of the TLS using singular value decomposition is described in standard texts.6 We can solve the equation


 
  for B where X is m-by-n and Y is m-by-k. 7
That is, we seek to find B that minimizes error matrices E and F for X and Y respectively. That is,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the augmented matrix with E and F side by side and 
 
 
 
  is the Frobenius norm, the square root of the sum of the squares of all entries in a matrix and so equivalently the square root of the sum of squares of the lengths of the rows or columns of the matrix.
This can be rewritten as


 
 . where 
 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
  identity matrix. The goal is then to find 
 
 
 
  that reduces the rank of 
 
 
 
  by k. Define 
 
 
 
  to be the singular value decomposition of the augmented matrix 
 
 
 
 
 .


 
  where V is partitioned into blocks corresponding to the shape of X and Y.
Using the Eckart-Young theorem, the approximation minimising the norm of the error is such that matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are unchanged, while the 
 
 
 
 -smallest singular values are replaced with zeroes. That is, we want


 
  so by linearity,


 
 . We can then remove blocks from the U and Σ matrices, simplifying to


 
 . This provides E and F so that


 
 . Now if 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular, which is not always the case (note that the behavior of TLS when 
 
 
 
 
  is singular is not well understood yet), we can then right multiply both sides by 
 
 
 
  to bring the bottom block of the right matrix to the negative identity, giving8


 
  and so



A naive GNU Octave implementation of this is:
function B = tls(xdata,ydata)
 
 m       = length(ydata);       %number of x,y data pairs
 X       = [xdata];
 Y       = ydata;
 n       = size(X,2);          % n is the width of X (X is m by n)
 Z       = [X Y];              % Z is X augmented with Y.
 [U S V] = svd(Z,0);           % find the SVD of Z.
 VXY     = V(1:n,1+n:end);     % Take the block of V consisting of the first n rows and the n+1 to last column
 VYY     = V(1+n:end,1+n:end); % Take the bottom-right block of V.
 B       = -VXY/VYY;
 end
The way described above of solving the problem, which requires that the matrix 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular, can be slightly extended by the so-called classical TLS algorithm.9
Computation
The standard implementation of classical TLS algorithm is available through Netlib, see also.1011 All modern implementations based, for example, on solving a sequence of ordinary least squares problems, approximate the matrix 
 
 
 
 
  (denoted 
 
 
 
  in the literature), as introduced by Van Huffel and Vandewalle. It is worth noting, that this 
 
 
 
  is, however, not the TLS solution in many cases.1213
Non-linear model
For non-linear systems similar reasoning shows that the normal equations for an iteration cycle can be written as



Geometrical interpretation
When the independent variable is error-free a residual represents the "vertical" distance between the observed data point and the fitted curve (or surface). In total least squares a residual represents the distance between a data point and the fitted curve measured along some direction. In fact, if both variables are measured in the same units and the errors on both variables are the same, then the residual represents the shortest distance between the data point and the fitted curve, that is, the residual vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. For this reason, this type of regression is sometimes called two dimensional Euclidean regression (Stein, 1983)14 or orthogonal regression.
Scale invariant methods
A serious difficulty arises if the variables are not measured in the same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve - what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then it is clear that we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.
In short, total least squares does not have the property of units-invariance—i.e. it is not scale invariant. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line; (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables.15 This line has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as standardised major axis (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006),1617 the reduced major axis, the geometric mean functional relationship (Draper and Smith, 1998),18 least products regression, diagonal regression, line of organic correlation, and the least areas line. Tofallis (2002)19 has extended this approach to deal with multiple variables.
