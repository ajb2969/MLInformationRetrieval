   Fuglede's theorem      Fuglede's theorem   In mathematics , Fuglede's theorem is a result in operator theory , named after Bent Fuglede .  The result  Theorem (Fuglede) Let T and N be bounded operators on a complex Hilbert space with N being normal . If TN = NT , then TN* = N*T , where N* denotes the adjoint of N .  Normality of N is necessary, as is seen by taking T = N . When T is self-adjoint, the claim is trivial regardless of whether N is normal:        T   N  *    =    (   N  T   )   *   =    (   T  N   )   *   =    N  *   T    .          T   superscript  N      superscript    N  T           superscript    T  N             superscript  N    T      TN^{*}=(NT)^{*}=(TN)^{*}=N^{*}T.\,     Tentative Proof : If the underlying Hilbert space is finite-dimensional, the spectral theorem says that N is of the form      N  =    ∑  i     λ  i     P  i          N    subscript   i      subscript  λ  i    subscript  P  i       N=\sum_{i}\lambda_{i}P_{i}\,     where P i are pairwise orthogonal projections. One aspects that TN = NT if and only if TP i = P i T . Indeed it can be proved to be true by elementary arguments (e.g. it can be shown that all P i are representable as polynomials of N and for this reason, if T commutes with N , it has to commute with P i ...). Therefore T must also commute with        N  *   =    ∑  i      λ  ¯   i    P  i      .       superscript  N      subscript   i      subscript   normal-¯  λ   i    subscript  P  i       N^{*}=\sum_{i}{\bar{\lambda}_{i}}P_{i}.     In general, when the Hilbert space is not finite-dimensional, the normal operator N gives rise to a projection-valued measure  P on its spectrum, σ ( N ), which assigns a projection P Ω to each Borel subset of σ ( N ). N can be expressed as       N  =    ∫   σ   (  N  )      λ  d  P   (  λ  )      .      N    subscript     σ  N      λ  d  P  λ      N=\int_{\sigma(N)}\lambda dP(\lambda).\,     Differently from the finite dimensional case, it is by no means obvious that TN = NT implies TP Ω = P Ω T . Thus, it is not so obvious that T also commutes with any simple function of the form       ρ  =    ∑  i     λ  ¯    P   Ω  i       .      ρ    subscript   i      normal-¯  λ    subscript  P   subscript  normal-Ω  i        \rho=\sum_{i}{\bar{\lambda}}P_{\Omega_{i}}.     Indeed, following the construction of the spectral decomposition for a bounded, normal, not self-adjoint, operator T , one sees that to verify that T commutes with    P   Ω  i      subscript  P   subscript  normal-Ω  i     P_{\Omega_{i}}   , the most straightforward way is to assume that T commutes with both N and N* , giving rise to a vicious circle!  That is the relevance of Fuglede's theorem: The latter hypothesis is not really necessary.  Putnam's generalization  The following contains Fuglede's result as a special case. The proof by Rosenblum pictured below is just that presented by Fuglede for his theorem when assuming N=M .  Theorem (Calvin Richard Putnam) Let T , M , N be linear operators on a complex Hilbert space , and suppose that M and N are normal , M is bounded and MT = TN . Then M * T = TN *.  First proof (Marvin Rosenblum) : By induction, the hypothesis implies that M k T = TN k for all k. Thus for any λ in   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   ,         e    λ  ¯   M    T   =   T   e    λ  ¯   N      .         superscript  e     normal-¯  λ   M    T     T   superscript  e     normal-¯  λ   N       e^{\bar{\lambda}M}T=Te^{\bar{\lambda}N}.     Consider the function        F   (  λ  )    =    e   λ   M  *     T   e   -   λ   N  *        .        F  λ      superscript  e    λ   superscript  M      T   superscript  e      λ   superscript  N          F(\lambda)=e^{\lambda M^{*}}Te^{-\lambda N^{*}}.   This is equal to        e   λ   M  *      [    e   -    λ  ¯   M     T   e    λ  ¯   N     ]    e   -   λ   N  *       =   U   (  λ  )   T  V    (  λ  )    -  1            superscript  e    λ   superscript  M       delimited-[]     superscript  e       normal-¯  λ   M     T   superscript  e     normal-¯  λ   N       superscript  e      λ   superscript  N          U  λ  T  V   superscript  λ    1       e^{\lambda M^{*}}\left[e^{-\bar{\lambda}M}Te^{\bar{\lambda}N}\right]e^{-%
 \lambda N^{*}}=U(\lambda)TV(\lambda)^{-1}   , where     U   (  λ  )    =   e    λ   M  *    -    λ  ¯   M           U  λ    superscript  e      λ   superscript  M        normal-¯  λ   M       U(\lambda)=e^{\lambda M^{*}-\bar{\lambda}M}   and     V   (  λ  )    =   e    λ   N  *    -    λ  ¯   N           V  λ    superscript  e      λ   superscript  N        normal-¯  λ   N       V(\lambda)=e^{\lambda N^{*}-\bar{\lambda}N}   . However we have       U    (  λ  )   *    =   e     λ  ¯   M   -   λ   M  *      =   U    (  λ  )    -  1             U   superscript  λ      superscript  e       normal-¯  λ   M     λ   superscript  M              U   superscript  λ    1        U(\lambda)^{*}=e^{\bar{\lambda}M-\lambda M^{*}}=U(\lambda)^{-1}   so U is unitary, and hence has norm 1 for all λ; the same is true for V (λ), so        ∥   F   (  λ  )    ∥   ≤    ∥  T  ∥    ∀  λ     .       norm    F  λ       norm  T    for-all  λ      \|F(\lambda)\|\leq\|T\|\ \forall\lambda.     So F is a bounded analytic vector-valued function, and is thus constant, and equal to F (0) = T . Considering the first-order terms in the expansion for small λ, we must have M*T = TN* .  The original paper of Fuglede appeared in 1950; it was extended to the form given above by Putnam in 1951. The short proof given above was first published by Rosenblum in 1958; it is very elegant, but is less general than the original proof which also considered the case of unbounded operators. Another simple proof of Putnam's theorem is as follows:  Second proof: Consider the matrices         T  ′   =    [     0    0      T    0     ]   and      N  ′   =   [     N    0      0    M     ]     .     formulae-sequence     superscript  T  normal-′      0  0    T  0    and       superscript  N  normal-′     N  0    0  M       T^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\
 T&0\end{bmatrix}\par
 \quad\mbox{and}\quad\par
  N^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}N&0\\
 0&M\end{bmatrix}.     The operator ''N' '' is normal and, by assumption, ''T' N' = N' T' ''. By Fuglede's theorem, one has         T  ′     (   N  ′   )   *    =     (   N  ′   )   *    T  ′     .         superscript  T  normal-′    superscript   superscript  N  normal-′         superscript   superscript  N  normal-′      superscript  T  normal-′      T^{\prime}(N^{\prime})^{*}=(N^{\prime})^{*}T^{\prime}.\,     Comparing entries then gives the desired result.  From Putnam's generalization, one can deduce the following:  Corollary If two normal operators M and N are similar, then they are unitarily equivalent.  Proof : Suppose MS = SN where S is a bounded invertible operator. Putnam's result implies M*S = SN* , i.e.         S   -  1     M  *   S   =   N  *    .         superscript  S    1     superscript  M    S    superscript  N      S^{-1}M^{*}S=N^{*}.\,     Take the adjoint of the above equation and we have         S  *   M    (   S   -  1    )   *    =  N   .         superscript  S    M   superscript   superscript  S    1       N    S^{*}M(S^{-1})^{*}=N.\,     So          S  *   M    (   S   -  1    )   *    =     S   -  1    M  S   ⇒      S   S  *   M    (   S   S  *    )    -  1     =  M    .     formulae-sequence       superscript  S    M   superscript   superscript  S    1           superscript  S    1    M  S   normal-⇒        S   superscript  S    M   superscript    S   superscript  S       1     M     S^{*}M(S^{-1})^{*}=S^{-1}MS\quad\Rightarrow\quad SS^{*}M(SS^{*})^{-1}=M.     Let S*=VR , with V a unitary (since S is invertible) and R the positive square root of SS* . As R is a limit of polynomials on SS* , the above implies that R commutes with M . It is also invertible. Then       N  =    S  *   M    (   S  *   )    -  1     =   V  R  M   R   -  1     V  *    =   V  M   V  *     .        N     superscript  S    M   superscript   superscript  S      1            V  R  M   superscript  R    1     superscript  V            V  M   superscript  V        N=S^{*}M(S^{*})^{-1}=VRMR^{-1}V^{*}=VMV^{*}.     Corollary If M and N are normal operators, and MN = NM , then MN is also normal.  Proof : The argument invokes only Fuglede's theorem. One can directly compute         (   M  N   )     (   M  N   )   *    =   M  N    (   N  M   )   *    =   M  N   M  *    N  *     .            M  N    superscript    M  N        M  N   superscript    N  M             M  N   superscript  M     superscript  N        (MN)(MN)^{*}=MN(NM)^{*}=MNM^{*}N^{*}.\,     By Fuglede, the above becomes        =   M   M  *   N   N  *    =    M  *   M   N  *   N    .        absent    M   superscript  M    N   superscript  N             superscript  M    M   superscript  N    N      =MM^{*}NN^{*}=M^{*}MN^{*}N.\,     But M and N are normal, so        =    M  *    N  *   M  N   =     (   M  N   )   *   M  N    .        absent     superscript  M     superscript  N    M  N           superscript    M  N     M  N      =M^{*}N^{*}MN=(MN)^{*}MN.\,     C* -algebras  The theorem can be rephrased as a statement about elements of C*-algebras .  Theorem (Fuglede-Putnam-Rosenblum) Let x, y be two normal elements of a C* -algebra A and z such that xz = zy . Then it follows that x* z = z y* .  References   Fuglede, Bent.
