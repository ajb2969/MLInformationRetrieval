Isometry (Riemannian geometry)

In the study of Riemannian geometry in mathematics, a local isometry from one (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold to another is a map which pulls back the metric tensor on the second manifold to the metric tensor on the first. When such a map is also a diffeomorphism, such a map is called an isometry (or isometric isomorphism), and provides a notion of isomorphism ("sameness") in the category Rm of Riemannian manifolds.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds, and let 
 
 
 
  be a diffeomorphism. Then 
 
 
 
  is called an isometry (or isometric isomorphism) if



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the pullback of the rank (0, 2) metric tensor 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Equivalently, in terms of the push-forward 
 
 
 
 , we have that for any two vector fields 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  (i.e. sections of the tangent bundle

 
 ),



If 
 
 
 
  is a local diffeomorphism such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is called a local isometry.
