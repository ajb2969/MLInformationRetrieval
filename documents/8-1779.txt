   Isometry (Riemannian geometry)      Isometry (Riemannian geometry)   In the study of Riemannian geometry in mathematics , a local isometry from one ( pseudo -) Riemannian manifold to another is a map which pulls back the metric tensor on the second manifold to the metric tensor on the first. When such a map is also a diffeomorphism , such a map is called an isometry (or isometric isomorphism ), and provides a notion of isomorphism ("sameness") in the category  Rm of Riemannian manifolds.  Definition  Let    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   and    (   M  ′   ,   g  ′   )      superscript  M  normal-′    superscript  g  normal-′     (M^{\prime},g^{\prime})   be two (pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds, and let    f  :   M  →   M  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  M   superscript  M  normal-′      f:M\to M^{\prime}   be a diffeomorphism. Then   f   f   f   is called an isometry (or isometric isomorphism ) if       g  =    f  *    g  ′     ,      g     superscript  f     superscript  g  normal-′      g=f^{*}g^{\prime},\,     where     f  *    g  ′        superscript  f     superscript  g  normal-′     f^{*}g^{\prime}   denotes the pullback of the rank (0, 2) metric tensor    g  ′     superscript  g  normal-′    g^{\prime}   by   f   f   f   . Equivalently, in terms of the push-forward    f  *     subscript  f     f_{*}   , we have that for any two vector fields    v  ,  w     v  w    v,w   on   M   M   M   (i.e. sections of the tangent bundle     T  M      normal-T  M    \mathrm{T}M   ),        g   (  v  ,  w  )    =    g  ′    (    f  *   v   ,    f  *   w   )     .        g   v  w       superscript  g  normal-′       subscript  f    v      subscript  f    w       g(v,w)=g^{\prime}\left(f_{*}v,f_{*}w\right).\,     If   f   f   f   is a local diffeomorphism such that    g  =    f  *    g  ′        g     superscript  f     superscript  g  normal-′      g=f^{*}g^{\prime}   , then   f   f   f   is called a local isometry .
