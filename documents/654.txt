   5-aminopentanamidase      5-aminopentanamidase   In enzymology , a 5-aminopentanamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-aminopentanamide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-aminopentanoate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-aminopentanamide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 5-aminopentanoate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-aminopentanamide amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include 5-aminovaleramidase , and 5-aminonorvaleramidase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
