   Artin–Schreier theory      Artin–Schreier theory    See Artin–Schreier theorem for theory about real-closed fields .    In mathematics , Artin–Schreier theory is a branch of Galois theory , and more specifically is a positive characteristic analogue of Kummer theory , for Galois extensions of degree equal to the characteristic p .  introduced Artin–Schreier theory for extensions of prime degree p , and  generalized it to extensions of prime power degree p n .  If K is a field of characteristic p , a prime number , any polynomial of the form         X  p   -  X   +  α   ,         superscript  X  p   X   α    X^{p}-X+\alpha,\,     for   α   α   \alpha   in K , is called an Artin–Schreier polynomial . When   α   α   \alpha   does not lie in the subset    {   y  ∈   K    |   y  =    x  p   -    x   for  x    ∈  K   }     conditional-set    y  K       y     superscript  x  p     x  for  x         K      \{y\in K\,|\,y=x^{p}-x\;\mbox{for }x\in K\}   , this polynomial is irreducible in K [ X ], and its splitting field over K is a cyclic extension of K of degree p . This follows since for any root β, the numbers β + i, for    1  ≤  i  ≤  p        1  i       p     1\leq i\leq p   , form all the roots—by Fermat's little theorem —so the splitting field is    K   (  β  )       K  β    K(\beta)   .  Conversely, any Galois extension of K of degree p equal to the characteristic of K is the splitting field of an Artin–Schreier polynomial. This can be proved using additive counterparts of the methods involved in Kummer theory , such as Hilbert's theorem 90 and additive Galois cohomology . These extensions are called Artin–Schreier extensions .  Artin–Schreier extensions play a role in the theory of solvability by radicals , in characteristic p , representing one of the possible classes of extensions in a solvable chain.  They also play a part in the theory of abelian varieties and their isogenies . In characteristic p , an isogeny of degree p of abelian varieties must, for their function fields, give either an Artin–Schreier extension or a purely inseparable extension .  Artin–Schreier–Witt extensions  There is an analogue of Artin–Schreier theory which describes cyclic extensions in characteristic p of p -power degree (not just degree p itself), using Witt vectors , developed by .
