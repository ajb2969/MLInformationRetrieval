   Quantum concentration      Quantum concentration   The quantum concentration  is the particle concentration (i.e. the number of particles per unit volume) of a system where the interparticle distance is equal to the thermal de Broglie wavelength .  Quantum effects become appreciable when the particle concentration is greater than or equal to the quantum concentration, which is defined as: 1       n  Q   =    (    M  k  T    2  π   ℏ  2     )    3  /  2         subscript  n  normal-Q    superscript      M  k  T     2  π   superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2       3  2      n_{\rm Q}=\left(\frac{MkT}{2\pi\hbar^{2}}\right)^{3/2}      where:     M   M   M   is the mass of the particles in the system     k   k   k   is the Boltzmann constant      T   T   T   is the temperature as measured in kelvins      ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is the reduced Planck constant    As the quantum concentration depends on temperature, high temperatures will put most systems in the classical limit unless they have a very high density e.g. a White dwarf .  For an ideal gas the Sackur–Tetrode equation can be written in terms of the quantum concentration as 2       S   (  T  ,  V  ,  N  )    =   N   k  B    [    5  2   +   ln   (    n  Q   n   )     ]          S   T  V  N      N   subscript  k  normal-B    delimited-[]      5  2        subscript  n  normal-Q   n         S(T,V,N)=Nk_{\rm B}\left[\frac{5}{2}+\ln\left(\frac{n_{\rm Q}}{n}\right)\right]     References  "  Category:Statistical mechanics     ↩
