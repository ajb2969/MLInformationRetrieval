G-prior

In statistics, the g-prior is an objective prior for the regression coefficients of a multiple regression. It was introduced by Arnold Zellner.1 It is a key tool in Bayes and empirical Bayes variable selection.23
Definition
Consider a data set 
 
 
 
 , where the 
 
 
 
  are Euclidean vectors and the 
 
 
 
  are scalars. The multiple regression model is formulated as


 
  where the 
 
 
 
  are random errors. Zellner's g-prior for 
 
 
 
  is a multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix proportional to the inverse Fisher information matrix for 
 
 
 
 .
Assume the 
 
 
 
  are iid normal with zero mean and variance 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the matrix with 
 
 
 
 th row equal to 
 
 
 
 . Then the g-prior for 
 
 
 
  is the multivariate normal distribution with prior mean a hyperparameter 
 
 
 
  and covariance matrix proportional to 
 
 
 
 , i.e.,


 
  where g is a positive scalar parameter.
Selection of g
A variety of methods have been proposed, including Bayes and empirical Bayes estimators. As g →∞, we would obtain posterior estimate the same as frequentist estimate.
