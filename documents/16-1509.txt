   G-prior      G-prior   In statistics , the g-prior is an objective prior for the regression coefficients of a multiple regression . It was introduced by Arnold Zellner . 1 It is a key tool in Bayes and empirical Bayes  variable selection . 2 3  Definition  Consider a data set     (   x  1   ,   y  1   )   ,  …  ,   (   x  n   ,   y  n   )        subscript  x  1    subscript  y  1    normal-…    subscript  x  n    subscript  y  n      (x_{1},y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{n},y_{n})   , where the    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   are Euclidean vectors and the    y  i     subscript  y  i    y_{i}   are scalars . The multiple regression model is formulated as        y  i   =     x  i  ⊤   β   +   ε  i     .       subscript  y  i        superscript   subscript  x  i   top   β    subscript  ε  i      y_{i}=x_{i}^{\top}\beta+\varepsilon_{i}.   where the    ε  i     subscript  ε  i    \varepsilon_{i}   are random errors. Zellner's g-prior for   β   β   \beta   is a multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix proportional to the inverse Fisher information matrix for   β   β   \beta   .  Assume the    ε  i     subscript  ε  i    \varepsilon_{i}   are iid normal with zero mean and variance    ψ   -  1      superscript  ψ    1     \psi^{-1}   . Let   X   X   X   be the matrix with   i   i   i   th row equal to    x  i  ⊤     superscript   subscript  x  i   top    x_{i}^{\top}   . Then the g-prior for   β   β   \beta   is the multivariate normal distribution with prior mean a hyperparameter    β  0     subscript  β  0    \beta_{0}   and covariance matrix proportional to    ψ    (    X  ⊤   X   )    -  1        ψ   superscript     superscript  X  top   X     1      \psi(X^{\top}X)^{-1}   , i.e.,       β  ∼   MVN   [   β  0   ,   g  ψ    (    X  ⊤   X   )    -  1     ]     .     similar-to  β    MVN    subscript  β  0     g  ψ   superscript     superscript  X  top   X     1         \beta\sim\text{MVN}[\beta_{0},g\psi(X^{\top}X)^{-1}].   where g is a positive scalar parameter.  Selection of g  A variety of methods have been proposed, including Bayes and empirical Bayes estimators. As g →∞, we would obtain posterior estimate the same as frequentist estimate.
