Slip ratio

Slip ratio is a means of calculating and expressing the locking status of a wheel and is vital to the effectiveness of any anti-lock braking system.
When a vehicle is being driven along a road in a straight line its wheels rotate at virtually identical speeds. The vehicle’s body also travels along the road at this same speed. When the driver applies the brakes in order to slow the vehicle, the speed of the wheels becomes slightly slower than the speed of the body, which is travelling along under its own inertia. This difference in speed is expressed as a percentage, and is called ‘slip ratio’. The ideal slip ratio for maximum deceleration is 10 to 30%.
Slip ratio is calculated as follows:
