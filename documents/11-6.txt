Rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase

In enzymology, a rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-rhamnulose 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  glycerone phosphate + (S)-lactaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-rhamnulose 1-phosphate, and two products, glycerone phosphate and (S)-lactaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate (S)-lactaldehyde-lyase (glycerone-phosphate-forming). Other names in common use include rhamnulose phosphate aldolase, L-rhamnulose 1-phosphate aldolase, L-rhamnulose-phosphate aldolase, and L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate lactaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and fructose and mannose metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
