   (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase      (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase   In enzymology , a (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-2-haloacid + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)-2-hydroxyacid + halide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-haloacid and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (R)-2-hydroxyacid and halide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on halide bonds in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-haloacid halidohydrolase . Other names in common use include 2-haloacid dehalogenase[ambiguous] , 2-haloacid halidohydrolase [ambiguous][ambiguous] , 2-haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase , 2-haloalkanoid acid halidohydrolase , 2-halocarboxylic acid dehalogenase II , DL-2-haloacid dehalogenase[ambiguous] , L-2-haloacid dehalogenase , and L-DEX . This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation and 1,2-dichloroethane degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 10 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , and .
