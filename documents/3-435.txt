   Tensor product of algebras      Tensor product of algebras   In mathematics , the tensor product of two R -algebras is also an R -algebra. This gives us a tensor product of algebras . The special case R = Z gives us a tensor product of rings , since rings may be regarded as Z -algebras.  Definition  Let R be a commutative ring and let A and B be R -algebras . Since A and B may both be regarded as R -modules , we may form their tensor product      A   ⊗  R   B      subscript  tensor-product  R   A  B    A\otimes_{R}B   which is also an R -module. We can give the tensor product the structure of an algebra by defining 1        (    a  1   ⊗   b  1    )    (    a  2   ⊗   b  2    )    =      a  1    a  2    ⊗   b  1     b  2           tensor-product   subscript  a  1    subscript  b  1     tensor-product   subscript  a  2    subscript  b  2        tensor-product     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2     subscript  b  1     subscript  b  2      (a_{1}\otimes b_{1})(a_{2}\otimes b_{2})=a_{1}a_{2}\otimes b_{1}b_{2}   and then extending by linearity to all of . This product is easily seen to be R -bilinear, associative, and unital with an identity element given by , 2 where 1 A and 1 B are the identities of A and B . If A and B are both commutative then the tensor product is commutative as well.  The tensor product turns the category of all R -algebras into a symmetric monoidal category .  Further properties  There are natural homomorphisms of A and B to given by 3      a  ↦   a  ⊗   1  B       maps-to  a   tensor-product  a   subscript  1  B      a\mapsto a\otimes 1_{B}         b  ↦    1  A   ⊗  b      maps-to  b   tensor-product   subscript  1  A   b     b\mapsto 1_{A}\otimes b   These maps make the tensor product a coproduct in the category of commutative R -algebras. The tensor product is not the coproduct in the category of all R -algebras. There the coproduct is given by a more general free product of algebras. Nevertheless the tensor product of non-commutative algebras can be described by an universal property similar to that of the coproduct:       H  o  m   (   A  ⊗  B   ,  X  )    ≅   {    (  f  ,  g  )   ∈     H  o  m   (  A  ,  X  )    ×  H   o  m   (  B  ,  X  )     ∣      ∀  a   ∈  A   ,   b  ∈  B    :    [   f   (  a  )    ,   g   (  b  )    ]   =  0    }         H  o  m    tensor-product  A  B   X     conditional-set     f  g         H  o  m   A  X    H   o  m   B  X      normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  a   A     b  B         f  a     g  b    0       Hom(A\otimes B,X)\cong\{(f,g)\in Hom(A,X)\times Hom(B,X)\mid\forall a\in A,b%
 \in B:[f(a),g(b)]=0\}   The natural isomorphism is given by identifying a morphism    ϕ  :    A  ⊗  B   →  X      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   tensor-product  A  B   X     \phi:A\otimes B\to X   on the left hand side with the pair of morphism    (  f  ,  g  )     f  g    (f,g)   on the right hand side where     f   (  a  )    :=   ϕ   (   a  ⊗  1   )       assign    f  a     ϕ   tensor-product  a  1      f(a):=\phi(a\otimes 1)   and similarly     g   (  b  )    :=   ϕ   (   1  ⊗  b   )       assign    g  b     ϕ   tensor-product  1  b      g(b):=\phi(1\otimes b)   .  Applications  The tensor product of algebras is of constant use in algebraic geometry : working in the opposite category to that of commutative R -algebras, it provides pullbacks of affine schemes , otherwise known as fiber products .
