   Power-to-weight ratio      Power-to-weight ratio   Power-to-weight ratio (or specific power or power-to-mass ratio ) is a calculation commonly applied to engines and mobile power sources to enable the comparison of one unit or design to another. Power-to-weight ratio is a measurement of actual performance of any engine or power source. It is also used as a measurement of performance of a vehicle as a whole, with the engine's power output being divided by the weight (or mass ) of the vehicle, to give a metric that is independent of the vehicle's size. Power-to-weight is often quoted by manufacturers at the peak value, but the actual value may vary in use and variations will affect performance.  The inverse of power-to-weight, weight-to-power ratio (power loading) is a calculation commonly applied to aircraft, cars, and vehicles in general, to enable the comparison of one vehicle's performance to another. Power-to-weight ratio is equal to thrust per unit mass multiplied by the velocity of any vehicle.  Power-to-weight (specific power)  The power-to-weight ratio (Specific Power) formula for an engine (power plant) is the power generated by the engine divided by the mass. ("Weight" in this context is a colloquial term for "mass". To see this, note that what an engineer means by the "power to weight ratio" of an electric motor is not infinite in a zero gravity environment.)  A typical turbocharged V8 diesel engine might have an engine power of  and a mass of , 1 giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 0.65 kW/kg (0.40 hp/lb).  Examples of high power-to-weight ratios can often be found in turbines. This is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds. For example, the Space Shuttle 's main engines used turbopumps (machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen ) into the engine's combustion chamber. The original liquid hydrogen turbopump is similar in size to an automobile engine (weighing approximately ) and produces 72,000 hp (53.6 MW ) 2 for a power-to-weight ratio of 153 kW/kg (93 hp/lb).  Physical interpretation  In classical mechanics , instantaneous power is the limiting value of the average work done per unit time as the time interval Δ t approaches zero.      P  =    lim    Δ  t   →  0       Δ  W   (  t  )     Δ  t      =    lim    Δ  t   →  0      P  avg           P    subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  t   0        normal-Δ  W  t     normal-Δ  t            subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  t   0     subscript  P  avg       P=\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\tfrac{\Delta W(t)}{\Delta t}=\lim_{\Delta t%
 \rightarrow 0}P_{\mathrm{avg}}\,     The typically used metrical unit of the power-to-weight ratio is     W   k  g        W    k  g     \tfrac{W}{kg}\;   which equals      m  2    s  3         superscript  m  2    superscript  s  3     \tfrac{m^{2}}{s^{3}}\;   . This fact allows one to express the power-to-weight ratio purely by SI base units .  Propulsive power  If the work to be done is rectilinear motion of a body with constant mass     m    m   m\;   , whose center of mass is to be accelerated along a straight line to a speed    |   𝐯   (  t  )    |        𝐯  t     |\mathbf{v}(t)|\;   and angle    ϕ    ϕ   \phi\;   with respect to the centre and radial of a gravitational field by an onboard powerplant , then the associated kinetic energy to be delivered to the body is equal to       E  K   =     1  2    m    |   𝐯   (  t  )    |   2         subscript  E  K       1  2   m   superscript      𝐯  t    2      E_{K}=\tfrac{1}{2}m|\mathbf{v}(t)|^{2}     where:      m    m   m\;   is mass of the body      |   𝐯   (  t  )    |        𝐯  t     |\mathbf{v}(t)|\;   is speed of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.  The instantaneous mechanical pushing/pulling power delivered to the body from the powerplant is then       P  K   =     1  2    m  2   |   𝐯   (  t  )    |     lim    Δ  t   →  0       Δ   |   𝐯   (  t  )    |     Δ  t       =     m  𝐚   (  t  )    ⋅  𝐯    (  t  )    =     𝐅   (  t  )    ⋅  𝐯    (  t  )    =     τ   (  t  )    ⋅  ω    (  t  )           subscript  P  K       1  2   m  2      𝐯  t      subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  t   0        normal-Δ      𝐯  t       normal-Δ  t              normal-⋅    m  𝐚  t   𝐯   t           normal-⋅    𝐅  t   𝐯   t           normal-⋅    τ  t   ω   t      P_{K}=\tfrac{1}{2}m2|\mathbf{v}(t)|\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\tfrac{\Delta|%
 \mathbf{v}(t)|}{\Delta t}=m\mathbf{a}(t)\cdot\mathbf{v}(t)=\mathbf{F}(t)\cdot%
 \mathbf{v}(t)=\mathbf{\tau}(t)\cdot\mathbf{\omega}(t)     where:      𝐚   (  t  )       𝐚  t    \mathbf{a}(t)\;   is acceleration of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.      𝐅   (  t  )       𝐅  t    \mathbf{F}(t)\;   is linear force - or thrust - applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.      𝐯   (  t  )       𝐯  t    \mathbf{v}(t)\;   is velocity of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.      τ   (  t  )       τ  t    \mathbf{\tau}(t)\;   is torque applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.      ω   (  t  )       ω  t    \mathbf{\omega}(t)\;   is angular velocity of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.  In propulsion, power is only delivered if the powerplant is in motion, and is transmitted to cause the body to be in motion. It is typically assumed here that mechanical transmission allows the powerplant to operate at peak output power. This assumption allows engine tuning to trade power band width and engine mass for transmission complexity and mass. Electric motors do not suffer from this tradeoff, instead trading their high torque for traction at low speed. The power advantage or power-to-weight ratio is then      P-to-W  =      |   𝐚   (  t  )    |    |   𝐯   (  t  )    |     |  𝐠  |         P-to-W          𝐚  t        𝐯  t       𝐠      \mbox{P-to-W}=\frac{|\mathbf{a}(t)||\mathbf{v}(t)|}{|\mathbf{g}|}\;     where:      |   𝐯   (  t  )    |        𝐯  t     |\mathbf{v}(t)|\;   is linear speed of the center of mass of the body.  Engine power  The actual useful power of any traction engine can be calculated using a dynamometer to measure torque and rotational speed , with peak power sustained when transmission and/or operator keeps the product of torque and rotational speed maximised. For jet engines there is often a cruise speed and power can be usefully calculated there, for rockets there is typically no cruise speed, so it is less meaningful.  Peak power of a traction engine occurs at a rotational speed higher than the speed when torque is maximised and at or below the maximum rated rotational speed - Max RPM. A rapidly falling torque curve would correspond with sharp torque and power curve peaks around their maxima at similar rotational speed, for example a small, lightweight engine with a large turbocharger. A slowly falling or near flat torque curve would correspond with a slowly rising power curve up to a maximum at a rotational speed close to Max RPM, for example a large, heavy multi-cylinder engine suitable for cargo/hauling. A falling torque curve could correspond with a near flat power curve across rotational speeds for smooth handling at different vehicle speeds.  Examples  Engines  Heat engines and heat pumps  Thermal energy is made up from molecular  kinetic energy and latent  phase energy. Heat engines are able to convert thermal energy in the form of a temperature gradient between a hot source and a cold sink into other desirable mechanical work . Heat pumps take mechanical work to regenerate thermal energy in a temperature gradient. Care should be made when interpreting propulsive power, especially for jet engines and rockets, deliverable from heat engines to a vehicle.

A nominal output voltage and a cutoff voltage are typically specified for a battery by its manufacturer. The output voltage falls to the cutoff voltage when the battery becomes "discharged". The nominal output voltage is always less than the open-circuit voltage produced when the battery is "charged". The temperature of a battery can affect the power it can deliver, where lower temperatures reduce power. Total energy delivered from a single charge cycle is affected by both the battery temperature and the power it delivers. If the temperature lowers or the power demand increases, the total energy delivered at the point of "discharge" is also reduced.  Battery discharge profiles are often described in terms of a factor of battery capacity . For example a battery with a nominal capacity quoted in ampere-hours (Ah) at a C/10 rated discharge current (derived in amperes) may safely provide a higher discharge current - and therefore higher power-to-weight ratio - but only with a lower energy capacity. Power-to-weight ratio for batteries is therefore less meaningful without reference to corresponding energy-to-weight ratio and cell temperature. This relationship is known as Peukert's law . 43      Battery type   Volts   Temp.   data-sort-type="number"|Energy-to-weight ratio   data-sort-type="number"|Power-to-weight ratio       Energizer 675 Mercury Free Zinc-air battery 44   1.4V   21 °C   1,645 kJ/kg to 0.9 V   1.65 W/kg 2.24 mA     GE Durathon™ NaMx A2 UPS  Molten salt battery 45   54.2V   -40–65 °C   342 kJ/kg to 37.8 V   15.8 W/kg C/6 (76 A)     Panasonic R03 AAA Zinc–carbon battery 46 47   1.5 V   20±2 °C   47 kJ/kg 20 mA to 0.9 V   3.3 W/kg 20 mA     88 kJ/kg 150 mA to 0.9 V   24 W/kg 150 mA     Eagle-Picher SAR-10081 60Ah 22-cell Nickel–hydrogen battery 48   27.7 V   10 °C   192 kJ/kg C/2 to 22 V   23 W/kg C/2     165 kJ/kg C/1 to 22 V   46 W/kg C/1     ClaytonPower 400Ah Lithium-ion battery 49 50   12V    617 kJ/kg   85.7 W/kg C/1 (175 A)     Energizer 522 Prismatic Zn – MnO 2  Alkaline battery 51   9 V   21 °C   444 kJ/kg 25 mA to 4.8 V   4.9 W/kg 25 mA     340 kJ/kg 100 mA to 4.8 V   19.7 W/kg 100 mA     221 kJ/kg 500 mA to 4.8 V   99 W/kg 500 mA     Panasonic HHR900D 9.25Ah Nickel–metal hydride battery 52   1.2 V   20 °C   209.65 kJ/kg to 0.7 V   11.7 W/kg C/5     58.2 W/kg C/1     116 W/kg 2C     URI 1418Ah replaceable anode Aluminium–air battery model {{Cite journal   doi = 10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00370-1   issn = 0378-7753   volume = 112   issue = 1     LG Chemical / CPI E2 6Ah LiMn 2 O 4  Lithium-ion polymer battery 53 54   3.8 V   25 °C   530.1 kJ/kg C/2 to 3.0 V   71.25 W/kg     513 kJ/kg 1C to 3.0 V   142.5 W/kg     Saft 45E Fe Super-Phosphate Lithium iron phosphate battery 55   3.3 V   25 °C   581 kJ/kg C to 2.5 V   161 W/kg     560 kJ/kg 1.14 C to 2.0 V   183 W/kg     0.73 kJ/kg 2.27 C to 1.5 V   367 W/kg     Energizer CH35 C 1.8Ah Nickel–cadmium battery 56   1.2 V   21 °C   152 kJ/kg C/10 to 1 V   4 W/kg C/10     147.1 kJ/kg 5C to 1 V   200 W/kg 5 C     Firefly Energy Oasis FF12D1-G31 6-cell 105Ah VRLA  battery 57   12 V   25 °C   142 kJ/kg C/10 to 7.2 V   4 W/kg C/10     -1 8 °C   7 kJ/kg CCA to 7.2V   234 W/kg CCA (625A)     0 °C   9 kJ/kg CA to 7.2 V   300 W/kg CA (800 A)     Panasonic CGA103450A 1.95Ah LiCoO 2  Lithium-ion battery 58   3.7 V   20 °C   666 kJ/kg C/5.3 to 2.75 V   35 W/kg C/5.3     0 °C   633 kJ/kg C/1 to 2.75 V   176 W/kg C/1     20 °C   655 kJ/kg C/1 to 2.75 V   182 W/kg C/1     20 °C   641 kJ/kg 2C to 2.75 V   356 W/kg 2C     Electric Fuel Battery Corp.

Electrostatic capacitors feature planar electrodes onto which electric charge accumulates. Electrolytic capacitors use a liquid electrolyte as one of the electrodes and the electric double layer effect upon the surface of the dielectric-electrolyte boundary to increase the amount of charge stored per unit volume. Electric double-layer capacitors extend both electrodes with a nanopourous material such as activated carbon to significantly increase the surface area upon which electric charge can accumulate, reducing the dielectric medium to nanopores and a very thin high permittivity separator.  While capacitors tend not to be as temperature sensitive as batteries, they are significantly capacity constrained and without the strength of chemical bonds suffer from self-discharge. Power-to-weight ratio of capacitors is usually higher than batteries because charge transport units within the cell are smaller (electrons rather than ions), however energy-to-weight ratio is conversely usually lower.

With a continuous flow of fuel and oxidant, available fuel cells and flow cells continue to convert the energy storage medium into electric energy and waste products. Fuel cells distinctly contain a fixed electrolyte whereas flow cells also require a continuous flow of electrolyte. Flow cells typically have the fuel dissolved in the electrolyte.

This could be slightly misleading, especially with regard to motorcycles, where the driver might weigh 1/3 to 1/2 as much as the vehicle itself. In the sport of competitive cycling athlete's performance is increasingly being expressed in VAMs and thus as a power-to-weight ratio in W/kg. This can be measured through the use of a bicycle powermeter or calculated from measuring incline of a road climb and the rider's time to ascend it. 90  Utility and practical vehicles  Most vehicles are designed to meet passenger comfort and cargo carrying requirements. Different designs trade off power-to-weight ratio to increase comfort, cargo space, fuel economy , emissions control , energy security and endurance. Reduced drag and lower rolling resistance in a vehicle design can facilitate increased cargo space without increase in the (zero cargo) power-to-weight ratio. This increases the role flexibility of the vehicle. Energy security considerations can trade off power (typically decreased) and weight (typically increased), and therefore power-to-weight ratio, for fuel flexibility or drive-train hybridisation . Some utility and practical vehicle variants such as hot hatches and sports-utility vehicles reconfigure power (typically increased) and weight to provide the perception of sports car like performance or for other psychological benefit . Rail locomotives require high mass to maintain adhesive traction on the rails, therefore improving the power-to-weight ratio by reducing mass is not necessarily beneficial. However choice of rail locomotive traction system (i.e. AC VFD over DC) can support improved power-to-weight ratio by reducing mass for the same adhesion.
