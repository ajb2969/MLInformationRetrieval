   Centered heptagonal number      Centered heptagonal number   (Figure)  Centered heptagonal number.svg   A centered heptagonal number is a centered  figurate number that represents a heptagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive heptagonal layers. The centered heptagonal number for n is given by the formula         7   n  2    -   7  n    +  2   2            7   superscript  n  2      7  n    2   2    {7n^{2}-7n+2}\over 2   .  This can also be calculated by multiplying the triangular number for ( n â€“ 1) by 7, then adding 1.  The first few centered heptagonal numbers are  1 , 8 , 22 , 43 , 71 , 106 , 148 , 197 , 253, 316, 386, 463, 547, 638, 736, 841, 953  Centered heptagonal numbers alternate parity in the pattern odd-even-even-odd.  Centered heptagonal prime  A centered heptagonal prime is a centered heptagonal number that is prime . The first few centered heptagonal primes are   43, 71, 197, 463, 547, 953, 1471, 1933, 2647, 2843, 3697, ...   and centered heptagonal twin prime numbers are   43, 71, 197, 463, 1933, 5741, 8233, 9283, 11173, 14561, 34651, ... .
