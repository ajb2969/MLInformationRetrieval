   Polyconvex function      Polyconvex function   In mathematics , the notion of polyconvexity is a generalization of the notion of convexity for functions defined on spaces of matrices . Let M m × n ( K ) denote the space of all m × n matrices over the field  K , which may be either the real numbers  R , or the complex numbers  C . A function f : M m × n ( K ) → R ∪ {±∞} is said to be polyconvex if      A  ↦   f   (  A  )       maps-to  A    f  A     A\mapsto f(A)     can be written as a convex function of the p × p sub determinants of A , for 1 ≤ p ≤ min{ m , n }.  Polyconvexity is a weaker property than convexity. For example, the function f given by       f   (  A  )    =   {        1   det   (  A  )      ,        det   (  A  )    >  0   ;         +  ∞   ,        det   (  A  )    ≤  0   ;             f  A    cases    1    A        A   0           A   0      f(A)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{\det(A)},&\det(A)>0;\\
 +\infty,&\det(A)\leq 0;\end{cases}     is polyconvex but not convex.  References    (Definition 10.25)   "  Category:Convex analysis  Category:Matrices  Category:Types of functions
