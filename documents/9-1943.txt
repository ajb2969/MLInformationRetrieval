   Risk measure      Risk measure   In financial mathematics , a risk measure is used to determine the amount of an asset or set of assets (traditionally currency ) to be kept in reserve. The purpose of this reserve is to make the risks taken by financial institutions , such as banks and insurance companies, acceptable to the regulator . In recent years attention has turned towards convex and coherent risk measurement .  Mathematically  A risk measure is defined as a mapping from a set of random variables to the real numbers. This set of random variables represents portfolio returns. The common notation for a risk measure associated with a random variable   X   X   X   is    ρ   (  X  )       ρ  X    \rho(X)   . A risk measure    ρ  :   ℒ  →   ℝ  ∪   {   +  ∞   }        normal-:  ρ   normal-→  ℒ    ℝ            \rho:\mathcal{L}\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{+\infty\}   should have certain properties: 1   Normalized       ρ   (  0  )    =  0        ρ  0   0    \rho(0)=0       Translative         If   a   ∈    ℝ    and   Z   ∈  ℒ   ,     then   ρ   (   Z  +  a   )    =    ρ   (  Z  )    -  a       formulae-sequence        If  a     ℝ  and  Z        ℒ        then  ρ    Z  a        ρ  Z   a      \mathrm{If}\;a\in\mathbb{R}\;\mathrm{and}\;Z\in\mathcal{L},\;\mathrm{then}\;%

Set-valued risk measures are useful for markets with transaction costs . 2  Mathematically  A set-valued risk measure is a function    R  :    L  d  p   →   𝔽  M       normal-:  R   normal-→   superscript   subscript  L  d   p    subscript  𝔽  M      R:L_{d}^{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_{M}   , where    L  d  p     superscript   subscript  L  d   p    L_{d}^{p}   is a   d   d   d   -dimensional Lp space ,     𝔽  M   =   {   D  ⊆  M   :   D  =   c  l   (   D  +   K  M    )     }        subscript  𝔽  M    conditional-set    D  M     D    c  l    D   subscript  K  M         \mathbb{F}_{M}=\{D\subseteq M:D=cl(D+K_{M})\}   , and     K  M   =   K  ∩  M        subscript  K  M     K  M     K_{M}=K\cap M   where   K   K   K   is a constant solvency cone and   M   M   M   is the set of portfolios of the   m   m   m   reference assets.   R   R   R   must have the following properties: 3   Normalized       K  M   ⊆  R   (  0  )    and   R   (  0  )   ∩  -  int   K  M   =  ∅     fragments   subscript  K  M    R   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)   and  R   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)     int   subscript  K  M       K_{M}\subseteq R(0)\;\mathrm{and}\;R(0)\cap-\mathrm{int}K_{M}=\emptyset       Translative in M         ∀  X   ∈   L  d  p    ,    ∀  u   ∈  M    :    R   (   X  +   u  1    )    =    R   (  X  )    -  u       normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  X    superscript   subscript  L  d   p       for-all  u   M        R    X    u  1         R  X   u      \forall X\in L_{d}^{p},\forall u\in M:R(X+u1)=R(X)-u       Monotone        ∀   X  2    -   X  1    ∈    L  d  p    (  K  )    ⇒   R   (   X  2   )    ⊇   R   (   X  1   )             for-all   subscript  X  2     subscript  X  1       superscript   subscript  L  d   p   K     normal-⇒      R   subscript  X  2      superset-of-or-equals      R   subscript  X  1       \forall X_{2}-X_{1}\in L_{d}^{p}(K)\Rightarrow R(X_{2})\supseteq R(X_{1})      Examples  Well known risk measures   Value at risk  Expected shortfall  Tail conditional expectation  Entropic risk measure  Superhedging price  ...   Variance  Variance (or standard deviation ) is not a risk measure. This can be seen since it has neither the translation property nor monotonicity. That is,     V  a  r   (   X  +  a   )    =   V  a  r   (  X  )    ≠    V  a  r   (  X  )    -  a           V  a  r    X  a      V  a  r  X            V  a  r  X   a      Var(X+a)=Var(X)\neq Var(X)-a   for all    a  ∈  ℝ      a  ℝ    a\in\mathbb{R}   , and a simple counterexample for monotonicity can be found. The standard deviation is a deviation risk measure .  Relation to acceptance set  There is a one-to-one correspondence between an acceptance set and a corresponding risk measure. As defined below it can be shown that      R   A  R     (  X  )    =   R   (  X  )           subscript  R   subscript  A  R    X     R  X     R_{A_{R}}(X)=R(X)   and     A   R  A    =  A       subscript  A   subscript  R  A    A    A_{R_{A}}=A   . 4  Risk measure to acceptance set   If   ρ   ρ   \rho   is a (scalar) risk measure then     A  ρ   =   {   X  ∈   L  p    :    ρ   (  X  )    ≤  0   }        subscript  A  ρ    conditional-set    X   superscript  L  p        ρ  X   0      A_{\rho}=\{X\in L^{p}:\rho(X)\leq 0\}   is an acceptance set.  If   R   R   R   is a set-valued risk measure then     A  R   =   {   X  ∈   L  d  p    :   0  ∈   R   (  X  )     }        subscript  A  R    conditional-set    X   subscript   superscript  L  p   d      0    R  X       A_{R}=\{X\in L^{p}_{d}:0\in R(X)\}   is an acceptance set.   Acceptance set to risk measure   If   A   A   A   is an acceptance set (in 1-d) then      ρ  A    (  X  )    =   inf   {   u  ∈  ℝ   :    X  +   u  1    ∈  A   }           subscript  ρ  A   X    infimum   conditional-set    u  ℝ       X    u  1    A       \rho_{A}(X)=\inf\{u\in\mathbb{R}:X+u1\in A\}   defines a (scalar) risk measure.  If   A   A   A   is an acceptance set then      R  A    (  X  )    =   {   u  ∈  M   :    X  +   u  1    ∈  A   }          subscript  R  A   X    conditional-set    u  M       X    u  1    A      R_{A}(X)=\{u\in M:X+u1\in A\}   is a set-valued risk measure.   Relation with deviation risk measure  There is a one-to-one relationship between a deviation risk measure  D and an expectation-bounded risk measure   ρ   ρ   \rho   where for any    X  ∈   ℒ  2       X   superscript  ℒ  2     X\in\mathcal{L}^{2}           D   (  X  )    =   ρ   (   X  -   𝔼   [  X  ]     )          D  X     ρ    X    𝔼   delimited-[]  X        D(X)=\rho(X-\mathbb{E}[X])          ρ   (  X  )    =    D   (  X  )    -   𝔼   [  X  ]           ρ  X       D  X     𝔼   delimited-[]  X       \rho(X)=D(X)-\mathbb{E}[X]   .      ρ   ρ   \rho   is called expectation bounded if it satisfies     ρ   (  X  )    >   𝔼   [   -  X   ]          ρ  X     𝔼   delimited-[]    X       \rho(X)>\mathbb{E}[-X]   for any nonconstant X and     ρ   (  X  )    =   𝔼   [   -  X   ]          ρ  X     𝔼   delimited-[]    X       \rho(X)=\mathbb{E}[-X]   for any constant X . 5  See also   Coherent risk measure  Dynamic risk measure  Managerial risk accounting  Risk management  Risk metric - the abstract concept that a risk measure quantifies  RiskMetrics - a model for risk management  Spectral risk measure  Distortion risk measure  Value at risk  Conditional value-at-risk  Entropic value at risk  Risk return ratio   References  Further reading            "  Category:Actuarial science  Category:Mathematical finance  Category:Financial risk     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
