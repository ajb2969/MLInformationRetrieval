Risk measure

In financial mathematics, a risk measure is used to determine the amount of an asset or set of assets (traditionally currency) to be kept in reserve. The purpose of this reserve is to make the risks taken by financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, acceptable to the regulator. In recent years attention has turned towards convex and coherent risk measurement.
Mathematically
A risk measure is defined as a mapping from a set of random variables to the real numbers. This set of random variables represents portfolio returns. The common notation for a risk measure associated with a random variable 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . A risk measure 
 
 
 
  should have certain properties:1

Normalized





Translative





Monotone




Set-valued
In a situation with 
 
 
 
 -valued portfolios such that risk can be measured in 
 
 
 
  of the assets, then a set of portfolios is the proper way to depict risk. Set-valued risk measures are useful for markets with transaction costs.2
Mathematically
A set-valued risk measure is a function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Lp space, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a constant solvency cone and 
 
 
 
  is the set of portfolios of the 
 
 
 
  reference assets. 
 
 
 
  must have the following properties:3

Normalized





Translative in M





Monotone




Examples
Well known risk measures

Value at risk
Expected shortfall
Tail conditional expectation
Entropic risk measure
Superhedging price

Variance
Variance (or standard deviation) is not a risk measure. This can be seen since it has neither the translation property nor monotonicity. That is, 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and a simple counterexample for monotonicity can be found. The standard deviation is a deviation risk measure.
Relation to acceptance set
There is a one-to-one correspondence between an acceptance set and a corresponding risk measure. As defined below it can be shown that 
 
 
 
  and

Risk measure to acceptance set

If 
 
 
 
  is a (scalar) risk measure then 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set.
If 
 
 
 
  is a set-valued risk measure then 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set.

Acceptance set to risk measure

If 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set (in 1-d) then 
 
 
 
  defines a (scalar) risk measure.
If 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set then 
 
 
 
  is a set-valued risk measure.

Relation with deviation risk measure
There is a one-to-one relationship between a deviation risk measure D and an expectation-bounded risk measure 
 
 
 
  where for any 
 
 







 
 .



 
  is called expectation bounded if it satisfies 
 
 
 
  for any nonconstant X and 
 
 
 
  for any constant X.5
