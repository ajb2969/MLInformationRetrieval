Pachner moves

In topology, a branch of mathematics, Pachner moves, named after Udo Pachner, are ways of replacing a triangulation of a piecewise linear manifold by a different triangulation of a homoeomorphic manifold. Pachner moves are also called bistellar flips. Any two triangulations of a piecewise linear manifold are related by a finite sequence of Pachner moves.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be the 
 
 
 
 -simplex. 
 
 
 
  is a combinatorial n-sphere with its triangulation as the boundary of the n+1-simplex.
Given a triangulated piecewise linear n-manifold 
 
 
 
 , and a co-dimension 0 subcomplex 
 
 
 
  together with a simplicial isomorphism 
 
 
 
 , the Pachner move on N associated to C is the triangulated manifold 
 
 
 
 . By design, this manifold is PL-isomorphic to 
 
 
 
  but the isomorphism does not preserve the triangulation.
