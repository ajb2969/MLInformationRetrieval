   Pachner moves      Pachner moves   In topology , a branch of mathematics, Pachner moves , named after Udo Pachner, are ways of replacing a triangulation of a piecewise linear manifold by a different triangulation of a homoeomorphic manifold. Pachner moves are also called bistellar flips . Any two triangulations of a piecewise linear manifold are related by a finite sequence of Pachner moves.  Definition  Let    Δ   n  +  1      subscript  normal-Δ    n  1     \Delta_{n+1}   be the    (   n  +  1   )      n  1    (n+1)   - simplex .    ∂   Δ   n  +  1         subscript  normal-Δ    n  1      \partial\Delta_{n+1}   is a combinatorial n -sphere with its triangulation as the boundary of the n+1 -simplex.  Given a triangulated piecewise linear n -manifold   N   N   N   , and a co-dimension 0 subcomplex    C  ⊂  N      C  N    C\subset N   together with a simplicial isomorphism    ϕ  :   C  →   C  ′   ⊂   ∂   Δ   n  +  1         normal-:  ϕ     normal-→  C   superscript  C  normal-′           subscript  normal-Δ    n  1         \phi:C\to C^{\prime}\subset\partial\Delta_{n+1}   , the Pachner move on N associated to C is the triangulated manifold     (   N  ∖  C   )    ∪  ϕ    (    ∂   Δ   n  +  1     ∖   C  ′    )       subscript   ϕ     N  C        subscript  normal-Δ    n  1      superscript  C  normal-′      (N\setminus C)\cup_{\phi}(\partial\Delta_{n+1}\setminus C^{\prime})   . By design, this manifold is PL-isomorphic to   N   N   N   but the isomorphism does not preserve the triangulation.  References    .
