Phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase

In enzymology, a phenylacetaldoxime dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(Z)-phenylacetaldehyde oxime 
 
 
 
  phenylacetonitrile + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (Z)-phenylacetaldehyde oxime, and two products, phenylacetonitrile and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the "catch-all" class of lyases that do not fit into any other sub-class. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (Z)-phenylacetaldehyde-oxime hydro-lyase (phenylacetonitrile-forming). Other names in common use include PAOx dehydratase, arylacetaldoxime dehydratase, OxdB, and (Z)-phenylacetaldehyde-oxime hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in styrene degradation.
