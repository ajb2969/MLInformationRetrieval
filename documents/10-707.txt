Symplectization

In mathematics, the symplectization of a contact manifold is a symplectic manifold which naturally corresponds to it.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a contact manifold, and let 
 
 
 
 . Consider the set


 
  of all nonzero 1-forms at 
 
 
 
 , which have the contact plane 
 
 
 
  as their kernel. The union


 
  is a symplectic submanifold of the cotangent bundle of 
 
 
 
 , and thus possesses a natural symplectic structure.
The projection

 
  supplies the symplectization with the structure of a principal bundle over 
 
 
 
  with structure group

 
 .
The coorientable case
When the contact structure

 
  is cooriented by means of a contact form

 
 , there is another version of symplectization, in which only forms giving the same coorientation to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  are considered:






Note that 
 
 
 
  is coorientable if and only if the bundle 
 
 
 
  is trivial. Any section of this bundle is a coorienting form for the contact structure.
