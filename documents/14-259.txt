Pedal equation

For a plane curve C and a given fixed point O, the pedal equation of the curve is a relation between r and p where r is the distance from O to a point on C and p is the perpendicular distance from O to the tangent line to C at the point. The point O is called the pedal point and the values r and p are sometimes called the pedal coordinates of a point relative to the curve and the pedal point. Some curves have particularly simple pedal equations and knowing the pedal equation of a curve may simplify the calculation of certain of its properties such as curvature.
Equations
Cartesian coordinates
For C given in rectangular coordinates by f(x, y) = 0, and with O taken to be the origin, the pedal coordinates of the point (x, y) are given by:1






The pedal equation can be found by eliminating x and y from these equations and the equation of the curve.
The expression for p may be simplified if the equation of the curve is written in homogeneous coordinates by introducing a variable z, so that the equation of the curve is g(x, y, z) = 0. The value of p is then given by2


 
  where the result is evaluated at z=1
Polar coordinates
For C given in polar coordinates by r = f(θ), then



where ψ is the polar tangential angle given by



The pedal equation can be found by eliminating θ from these equations.3
