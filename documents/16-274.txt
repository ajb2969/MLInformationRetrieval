Adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase

Adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (, CbiB) is an enzyme with system name adenosylcobyric acid:(R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate ligase (ADP-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) ATP + adenosylcobyric acid + (R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + adenosylcobinamide phosphate
 
(2) ATP + adenosylcobyric acid + (R)-1-aminopropan-2-ol 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + adenosylcobinamide
 

One of the substrates, (R)-1-aminopropan-2-yl phosphate, is produced by CobD (EC 4.1.1.81).
