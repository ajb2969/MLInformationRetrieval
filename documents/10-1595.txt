2-acetolactate mutase

In enzymology, a 2-acetolactate mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-acetolactate 
 
 
 
  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-acetolactate, and one product, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-acetolactate methylmutase. Other names in common use include acetolactate mutase, and acetohydroxy acid isomerase. This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, ascorbate.
