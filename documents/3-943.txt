   Icosagon      Icosagon   In geometry , an icosagon is a twenty-sided polygon . The sum of any icosagon's interior angles is 3240 degrees.  The regular icosagon is a constructible polygon , by an edge- bisection of a regular decagon , and can be seen as a truncated decagon, t{10}. One interior angle in a regular icosagon is 162°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 18°.  Regular Icosagon  The area of a regular icosagon is: (with t = edge length)       A  =   5   t  2    (   1  +   5   +    5  +   2   5       )    ≃   31.56875757   t  2     .

Uses  The Big Wheel on the popular US game show The Price Is Right is an icosagon.  The Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare's acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989. 1  As a golygonal path, the swastika is considered to be an irregular icosagon. 2  A regular square, pentagon, and icosagon can completely fill a plane vertex.  Construction  A regular icosagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge :  Construction of a regular icosagon  Related polygons  An icosagram is a 20-sided star polygon , represented by symbol {20/n}. There are 3 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols : {20/3}, {20/7}, and {20/9}. There are also 5 regular star figures (compounds) using the same vertex arrangement : 2{10}, 4{5}, 5{4}, 2{10/3}, 4{5/2}, and 10{2}.      n   1   2   3   4   5       Form   Convex polygon   Compound   Star polygon   Compound     Image   {20/1} = {20}   {20/2} = 2{10}   {20/3}   {20/4} = 4{5}   {20/5} = 5{4}     Interior angle   162°   144°   126°   108°   90°     n   6   7   8   9   10     Form   Compound   Star polygon   Compound   Star polygon   Compound     Image   {20/6} = 2{10/3}   {20/7}   {20/8} = 4{5/2}   {20/9}   {20/10} = 10{2}     Interior angle   72°   54°   36°   18°   0°     Deeper truncations of the regular decagon and decagram can produce isogonal ( vertex-transitive ) intermediate icosagram forms with equally spaced vertices and two edge lengths. 3  A regular icosagram, {20/9}, can be seen as a quasitruncated decagon, t{10/9}={20/9}. Similarly a decagram , {10/3} has a quasitruncation t{10/7}={20/7}, and finally a simple truncation of a decagram gives t{10/3}={20/3}.
