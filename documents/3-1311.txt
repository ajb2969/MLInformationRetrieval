Auto magma object

In mathematics, a magma in a category, or magma object, can be defined in a category with a cartesian product. This is the 'internal' form of definition of a binary operation in a category.
As Mag the magma category has direct products, the concept of an (internal) magma (or internal binary operation) in Mag is defined, say



Since 
 
 
 
  is a morphism we must have



If we want to take the original operation, this will be allowed only if the medial identity



is valid.
This operation, which gives a medial magma, can have a two-sided identity only if it is a commutative monoidal operation. The if direction is obvious.
As a result Med, the medial category, has all its objects as '' medial objects''; and this characterizes it.
