Diiodophenylpyruvate reductase

In enzymology, a diiodophenylpyruvate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate + NAD+

 
  3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-(3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include aromatic alpha-keto acid, KAR, and 2-oxo acid reductase.
