Dichlorochromopyrrolate synthase

Dichlorochromopyrrolate synthase (, RebD, dichlorochromopyrrolic acid synthase) is an enzyme with systematic name 2-imino-3-(7-chloroindol-3-yl)propanoate ammonia-lyase (dichlorochromopyrrolate-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4 2-imino-3-(7-chloroindol-3-yl)propanoate + O2

 
  2 dichlorochromopyrrolate + 2 NH3 + 2 H2O
 

This enzyme catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin.
