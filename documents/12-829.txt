Massera's lemma

In stability theory and nonlinear control, Massera's lemma, named after José Luis Massera, deals with the construction of the Lyapunov function to prove the stability of a dynamical system.1 The lemma appears in  as the first lemma in section 12, and in more general form in  as lemma 2. In 2004, Massera's original lemma for single variable functions was extended to the multivariable case, and the resulting lemma was used to prove the stability of switched dynamical systems, where a common Lyapunov function describes the stability of multiple modes and switching signals.
Massera's original lemma
Massera’s lemma is used in the construction of a converse Lyapunov function of the following form (also known as the integral construction)


 
  for an asymptotically stable dynamical system whose stable trajectory starting from 
 
 

The lemma states:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive, continuous, strictly decreasing function with 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive, continuous, nondecreasing function. Then there exists a function 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  and its derivative 
 
 
 
  are class-K functions defined for all t ≥ 0
There exist positive constants k1, k2, such that for any continuous function u satisfying 0 ≤ u(t) ≤ g(t) for all t ≥ 0,





Extension to multivariable functions
Massera's lemma for single variable functions was extended to the multivariable case by Vu and Liberzon.2

Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive, continuous, strictly decreasing function with 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive, continuous, nondecreasing function. Then there exists a differentiable function 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  and its derivative 
 
 
 
  are class-K functions on 
 
 
 
 .
For every positive integer 
 
 
 
 , there exist positive constants k1, k2, such that for any continuous function 
 
 
 
  satisfying



 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  we have
