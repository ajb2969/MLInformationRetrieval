   Novikov's condition      Novikov's condition   In probability theory , Novikov's condition is the sufficient condition for a stochastic process which takes the form of the Radon-Nikodym derivative in Girsanov's theorem to be a martingale . If satisfied together with other conditions, Girsanov's theorem may be applied to a Brownian motion stochastic process to change from the original measure to the new measure defined by the Radon-Nikodym derivative.  This condition was suggested and proved by Alexander Novikov . There are other results which may be used to show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative is a martingale, such as the more general criterion Kazamaki's condition , however Novikov's condition is the most well-known result.
