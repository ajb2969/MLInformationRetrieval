Novikov's condition

In probability theory, Novikov's condition is the sufficient condition for a stochastic process which takes the form of the Radon-Nikodym derivative in Girsanov's theorem to be a martingale. If satisfied together with other conditions, Girsanov's theorem may be applied to a Brownian motion stochastic process to change from the original measure to the new measure defined by the Radon-Nikodym derivative.
This condition was suggested and proved by Alexander Novikov. There are other results which may be used to show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative is a martingale, such as the more general criterion Kazamaki's condition, however Novikov's condition is the most well-known result.
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is a real valued adapted process on the probability space 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an adapted Brownian motion:1
If the condition



is fulfilled then the process



is a martingale under the probability measure 
 
 
 
  and the filtration
