Matrix of ones

In mathematics, a matrix of ones or all-ones matrix is a matrix where every element is equal to one.1 Examples of standard notation are given below:
$$J_2=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 
 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 J_3=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1
 \end{pmatrix};\quad
 J_{2,5}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 
 \end{pmatrix}.\quad$$
Some sources call the all-ones matrix the unit matrix,2 but that term may also refer to the identity matrix, a different matrix.
Properties
For an n×n matrix of ones J, the following properties hold:

The  trace of J is n,3 and the determinant is 1 if n is 1, or 0 otherwise.
The rank of J is 1 and the eigenvalues are n (once) and 0 (n-1 times).4
J is positive semi-definite matrix. This follows from the previous property.
$J^k = n^{k-1} J, \mbox{ for } k=1,2,\ldots.\,$5
The matrix $\tfrac1n J$ is idempotent. This is a simple corollary of the above.6
$\exp(J) = I + \frac{ e^n-1}{n} J,$ where exp(J) is the matrix exponential.
J is the neutral element of the Hadamard product.7
If A is the adjacency matrix of a n-vertex undirected graph G, and J is the all-ones matrix of the same dimension, then G is a regular graph if and only if AJ = JA.8
