   Complex Hadamard matrix      Complex Hadamard matrix   A complex Hadamard matrix is any complex     N  √ó  N      N  N    N\times N    matrix    H   H   H   satisfying two conditions:   unimodularity (the modulus of each entry is unity)      |   H   j  k    |   =   1  for  j    ,   k  =   1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  N       formulae-sequence       subscript  H    j  k      1  for  j      k   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶  N      |H_{jk}|=1{\quad\rm for\quad}j,k=1,2,\dots,N       orthogonality      H   H  ‚Ä†    =    N   ùïÄ         H   superscript  H  normal-‚Ä†      N  ùïÄ     HH^{\dagger}=N\;{\mathbb{I}}   ,   where   ‚Ä†   normal-‚Ä†   {\dagger}   denotes the Hermitian transpose of H and   ùïÄ   ùïÄ   {\mathbb{I}}   is the identity matrix. The concept is a generalization of the Hadamard matrix . Note that any complex Hadamard matrix   H   H   H   can be made into a unitary matrix by multiplying it by    1   N       1    N     \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}   ; conversely, any unitary matrix whose entries all have modulus    1   N       1    N     \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}   becomes a complex Hadamard upon multiplication by    N      N    \sqrt{N}   .  Complex Hadamard matrices arise in the study of operator algebras and the theory of quantum computation . Real Hadamard matrices and Butson-type Hadamard matrices form particular cases of complex Hadamard matrices.  Complex Hadamard matrices exist for any natural N (compare the real case, in which existence is not known for every N ). For instance the Fourier matrices        [   F  N   ]    j  k    :=  exp   [   (  2  œÄ  i   (  j  -  1  )    (  k  -  1  )   /  N  ]   for  j  ,  k  =  1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  N      fragments   subscript   fragments  normal-[   subscript  F  N   normal-]     j  k    assign    fragments  normal-[   fragments  normal-(  2  œÄ  i   fragments  normal-(  j   1  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  k   1  normal-)    N  normal-]    for   j  normal-,  k   1  normal-,  2  normal-,  normal-‚Ä¶  normal-,  N     [F_{N}]_{jk}:=\exp[(2\pi i(j-1)(k-1)/N]{\quad\rm for\quad}j,k=1,2,\dots,N     belong to this class.  Equivalency  Two complex Hadamard matrices are called equivalent, written     H  1   ‚âÉ   H  2      similar-to-or-equals   subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2     H_{1}\simeq H_{2}   , if there exist diagonal unitary matrices      D  1   ,   D  2       subscript  D  1    subscript  D  2     D_{1},D_{2}   and permutation matrices      P  1   ,   P  2       subscript  P  1    subscript  P  2     P_{1},P_{2}   such that        H  1   =    D  1    P  1    H  2    P  2    D  2     .       subscript  H  1      subscript  D  1    subscript  P  1    subscript  H  2    subscript  P  2    subscript  D  2      H_{1}=D_{1}P_{1}H_{2}P_{2}D_{2}.     Any complex Hadamard matrix is equivalent to a dephased Hadamard matrix, in which all elements in the first row and first column are equal to unity.  For    N  =   2  ,  3       N   2  3     N=2,3   and   5   5   5   all complex Hadamard matrices are equivalent to the Fourier matrix    F  N     subscript  F  N    F_{N}   . For    N  =  4      N  4    N=4   there exists a continuous, one-parameter family of inequivalent complex Hadamard matrices,          F  4   (  1  )     (  a  )    :=    [     1    1    1    1      1     i   e   i  a        -  1      -   i   e   i  a          1     -  1     1     -  1       1     -   i   e   i  a         -  1      i   e   i  a        ]   with     a  ‚àà   [  0  ,  œÄ  )     .     formulae-sequence   assign     superscript   subscript  F  4   1   a      1  1  1  1    1    i   superscript  e    i  a       1       i   superscript  e    i  a        1    1   1    1     1      i   superscript  e    i  a        1     i   superscript  e    i  a       with      a   0  œÄ      F_{4}^{(1)}(a):=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&1&1\\
 1&ie^{ia}&-1&-ie^{ia}\\
 1&-1&1&-1\\
 1&-ie^{ia}&-1&ie^{ia}\end{bmatrix}{\quad\rm with\quad}a\in[0,\pi).     For    N  =  6      N  6    N=6   the following families of complex Hadamard matrices are known:   a single two-parameter family which includes    F  6     subscript  F  6    F_{6}   ,  a single one-parameter family     D  6    (  t  )        subscript  D  6   t    D_{6}(t)   ,  a one-parameter orbit     B  6    (  Œ∏  )        subscript  B  6   Œ∏    B_{6}(\theta)   , including the circulant Hadamard matrix    C  6     subscript  C  6    C_{6}   ,  a two-parameter orbit including the previous two examples     X  6    (  Œ±  )        subscript  X  6   Œ±    X_{6}(\alpha)   ,  a one-parameter orbit     M  6    (  x  )        subscript  M  6   x    M_{6}(x)   of symmetric matrices,  a two-parameter orbit including the previous example     K  6    (  x  ,  y  )        subscript  K  6    x  y     K_{6}(x,y)   ,  a three-parameter orbit including all the previous examples     K  6    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )        subscript  K  6    x  y  z     K_{6}(x,y,z)   ,  a further construction with four degrees of freedom,    G  6     subscript  G  6    G_{6}   , yielding other examples than     K  6    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )        subscript  K  6    x  y  z     K_{6}(x,y,z)   ,  a single point - one of the Butson-type Hadamard matrices,     S  6   ‚àà   H   (  3  ,  6  )         subscript  S  6     H   3  6      S_{6}\in H(3,6)   .   It is not known, however, if this list is complete, but it is conjectured that      K  6    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    ,   G  6   ,   S  6         subscript  K  6    x  y  z     subscript  G  6    subscript  S  6     K_{6}(x,y,z),G_{6},S_{6}   is an exhaustive (but not necessarily irredundant) list of all complex Hadamard matrices of order 6.
