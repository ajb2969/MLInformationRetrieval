Conditional expectation




Conditional expectation

In probability theory, the conditional expectation of a random variable is another random variable equal to the average of the former over each possible "condition". In the case when the random variable is defined over a discrete probability space, the "conditions" are a partition of this probability space. This definition is then generalized to any probability space using measure theory.
Conditional expectation is also known as conditional expected value or conditional mean.
In modern probability theory the concept of conditional probability is defined in terms of conditional expectation.
Concept
The concept of conditional probability can be nicely illustrated through the following example. Suppose we have daily rainfall data (mm of rain each day) collected by a weather station on every day of the ten year period from Jan 1, 1990 to Dec 31, 1999. The conditional expectation of daily rainfall knowing the month of the year is the average of daily rainfall over all days of the ten year period that fall in a given month. These data then may be considered either as a function of each day (so for example its value for Mar 3, 1992, would be the sum of daily rainfalls on all days that are in the month of March during the ten years, divided by the number of these days, which is 310) or as a function of just the month (so for example the value for March would be equal to the value of the previous example).
It is important to note the following.

The conditional expectation of daily rainfall knowing that we are in a month of March of the given ten years is not a monthly rainfall data, that is it is not the average of the ten monthly total March rainfalls. That number would be 31 times higher.
The average daily rainfall in March 1992 is not equal to the conditional expectation of daily rainfall knowing that we are in a month of March of the given ten years, because we have restricted ourselves to 1992, that is we have more conditions than just that of being in March. This shows that reasoning as "we are in March 1992, so I know we are in March, so the average daily rainfall is the March average daily rainfall" is incorrect. Stated differently, although we use the expression "conditional expectation knowing that we are in March" this really means "conditional expectation knowing nothing other than that we are in March".

History
The related concept of conditional probability dates back at least to Laplace who calculated conditional distributions. It was Andrey Kolmogorov who in 1933 formalized it using the Radon–Nikodym theorem.1 In works of Paul Halmos 19502 and Joseph L. Doob 19533 conditional expectation was generalized to its now usual definition using sub-sigma-algebras.4
Classical definition
Conditional expectation with respect to an event
In classical probability theory the conditional expectation of X given an event H (which may be the event Y=y for a random variable Y) is the average of X over all outcomes in H, that is



The sum above can be grouped by different values of 
 
 
 
 , to get a sum over the range

 
  of X



In modern probability theory, when H is an event with strictly positive probability, it is possible to give a similar formula. This is notably the case for a discrete random variable Y and for y in the range of Y if the event H is Y=y. Let 
 
 
 
  be a probability space, X a random variable on that probability space, and 
 
 
 
  an event with strictly positive probability 
 
 
 
 . Then the conditional expectation of X given the event H is



where 
 
 
 
  is the range of X and 
 
 
 
  is the conditional probability of A knowing H.
When P(H) = 0 (for instance if Y is a continuous random variable and H is the event Y=y, this is in general the case), the Borel–Kolmogorov paradox demonstrates the ambiguity of attempting to define the conditional probability knowing the event H. The above formula shows that this problem transposes to the conditional expectation. So instead one only defines the conditional expectation with respect to a sigma-algebra or a random variable.
Conditional expectation with respect to a random variable
If Y is a discrete random variable with range 
 
 
 
 , then we can define on 
 
 
 
  the function



Sometimes this function is called the conditional expectation of X with respect to Y. In fact, according to the modern definition, it is 
 
 
 
  that is called the conditional expectation of X with respect to Y, so that we have



which is a random variable.
As mentioned above, if Y is a continuous random variable, it is not possible to define 
 
 
 
  by this method. As explained in the Borel–Kolmogorov paradox, we have to specify what limiting procedure produces the set Y = y. This can be naturally done by defining the set 
 
 
 
 , and taking the limit 
 
 
 
 , so that if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then


 
 .
The modern definition is analogous to the above except that the above limiting process is replaced by the Radon–Nikodym derivative, so the result holds more generally.
Formal definition
Conditional expectation with respect to a σ-algebra
[[File:LokaleMittelwertbildung.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Conditional expectation with respect to a sigma-algebra: in this example the probability space 
 
 
 
  is the [0,1] interval with the Lebesgue measure. We define the following σ-algebras
 
 
 
  while 
 
 
 
  is the σ-algebra generated by the intervals with end-points 0, ¼, ½, ¾, 1 and 
 
 
 
  is the σ-algebra generated by the intervals with end-points 0, ½, 1. Here the conditional expectation is effectively the average over the minimal sets of the σ-algebra.]]
Consider the following

  is a random variable on that probability space


 
  is a sub-σ-algebra of 
 
 


Then a conditional expectation of X given 
 
 
 
 , denoted as 
 
 
 
 , is any 
 
 
 
 -measurable function (
 
 
 
 ) which satisfies:


 
 .5
The existence of 
 
 
 
  can be established by noting that 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 is a measure on 
 
 
 
  that is absolutely continuous with respect to 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, if 
 
 
 
  is the natural injection from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is absolutely continuous with respect to 
 
 
 
  since 
 
 
 
 . Thus, we have



where the derivatives are Radon–Nikodym derivatives of measures.

 -measurable function

 
  which satisfies:


 
 .
the random variable 
 
 
 
 , denoted as 
 
 
 
 , is a conditional expectation of X given 
 
 
 
 .
This definition is equivalent to defining the conditional expectation using the pre-image of Σ with respect to Y. If we define



then

Discussion
A couple of points worth noting about the definition:

This is not a constructive definition; we are merely given the required property that a conditional expectation must satisfy.
 
The definition of 
 
 
 
  may resemble that of 
 
 
 
  but these are very different objects, the former being a 
 
 
 
 -measurable function 
 
 
 
 , while the latter is an element of 
 
 
 
  for fixed 
 
 
 
 , or a function 
 
 
 
  if considered as the function 
 
 
 
 .
Existence of a conditional expectation function is determined by the Radon–Nikodym theorem, a sufficient condition is that the (unconditional) expected value for X exist.
Uniqueness can be shown to be almost sure: that is, versions of the same conditional expectation will only differ on a set of probability zero.

The σ-algebra 
 
 
 
  controls the "granularity" of the conditioning. A conditional expectation 
 
 
 
  over a finer-grained σ-algebra 
 
 
 
  will allow us to condition on a wider variety of events.

Conditioning as factorization
In the definition of conditional expectation that we provided above, the fact that 
 
 
 
  is a real random element is irrelevant. Let 
 
 
 
  be a measurable space, where 
 
 
 
  is a σ-algebra in 
 
 
 
 . A 
 
 
 
 -valued random element is a measurable function 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . The distribution of 
 
 
 
  is the probability measure 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem. If 
 
 
 
  is an integrable random variable, then there exists a 
 
 
 
 -unique integrable random element 
 
 
 
 , such that



for all 
 
 
 
 .
Proof sketch
Let 
 
 
 
  be such that 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a signed measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to 
 
 
 
 . Indeed 
 
 
 
  means exactly that 
 
 
 
 . Since the integral of an integrable function on a set of probability 0 is 0, this proves absolute continuity. The Radon–Nikodym theorem then proves the existence of a density of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 , which we denote by 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 

Comparing with conditional expectation with respect to sub-sigma algebras, it holds that



We can further interpret this equality by considering the abstract change of variables formula to transport the integral on the right hand side to an integral over Ω:



The equation means that the integrals of 
 
 
 
  and the composition 
 
 
 
  over sets of the form 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 , are identical.
This equation can be interpreted to say that the following diagram is commutative in the average.






Computation
When X and Y are both discrete random variables, then the conditional expectation of X given the event Y=y can be considered as function of y for y in the range of Y



where 
 
 
 
  is the range of X.
If X is a continuous random variable, while Y remains a discrete variable, the conditional expectation is:



with 
 
 
 
  (where fX,Y(x, y) gives the joint density of X and Y) is the conditional density of X given Y=y.
If both X and Y are continuous random variables, then the conditional expectation is:



where 
 
 
 
  (where fY(y) gives the density of Y).
Basic properties
All the following formulas are to be understood in an almost sure sense. The sigma-algebra 
 
 
 
  could be replaced by a random variable 
 
 


Pulling out independent factors:
 
If 
 
 
 
  is independent of

Let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is independent of 
 
 
 
 , so we get that


 
  Thus the definition of conditional expectation is satisfied by the constant random variable 
 
 
 
 , as desired. 


If 
 
 
 
  is independent of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . Note that this is not necessarily the case if 
 
 
 
  is only independent of 
 
 
 
  and of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  are independent, 
 
 
 
  are independent,

  is in the sense of the L2(P) scalar product the orthogonal projection from 
 
 
 
  to the linear subspace of 
 
 
 
 -measurable functions. (This allows to define and prove the existence of the conditional expectation based on the Hilbert projection theorem.)
the mapping 
 
 
 
  is self-adjoint
