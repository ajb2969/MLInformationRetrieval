   UDP-glucose—glycoprotein glucose phosphotransferase      UDP-glucose—glycoprotein glucose phosphotransferase   In enzymology , an UDP-glucose—glycoprotein glucose phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + glycoprotein D-mannose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UMP + glycoprotein 6-(D-glucose-1-phospho)-D-mannose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and glycoprotein D-mannose , whereas its two products are UMP and glycoprotein 6-(D-glucose-1-phospho)-D-mannose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:glycoprotein-D-mannose glucosephosphotransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucose-1-phosphotransferase , GlcPTase , Glc-phosphotransferase , and uridine diphosphoglucose-glycoprotein glucose-1-phosphotransferase .
