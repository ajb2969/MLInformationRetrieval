Vitali convergence theorem




Vitali convergence theorem

In real analysis and measure theory, the Vitali convergence theorem, named after the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Vitali, is a generalization of the better-known dominated convergence theorem of Henri Lebesgue. It is a strong condition that depends on uniform integrability. It is useful when a dominating function cannot be found for the sequence of functions in question; when such a dominating function can be found, Lebesgue's theorem follows as a special case of Vitali's.
Statement of the theorem1
Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive measure space. If






 
  is uniformly integrable


a.e. as 
 
 
 
  and


 
  a.e.

then the following hold:






 
 .

Outline of Proof

For proving statement 1, we use Fatou's lemma

:*Using uniform integrability, we have 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a set such that 
 
 

:*By Egorov's theorem, 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly on the set 
 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  for a large 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Using triangle inequality, 
 
 

:*Plugging the above bounds on the RHS of Fatou's lemma gives us statement 1.

For statement 2, use 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
 
 :*The terms in the RHS are bounded respectively using Statement 1, uniform integrability of 
 
 
 
  and Egorov's theorem for all 
 
 
 
 .


Converse of the theorem2
