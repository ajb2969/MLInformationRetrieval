Planar lamina

In mathematics, a planar lamina is a closed set in a plane of mass 
 
 
 
  and surface density 
 
 
 
  such that:


 
 , over the closed set.
The center of mass of the lamina is at the point



where 
 
 
 
  moment of the entire lamina about the x-axis and 
 
 
 
  moment of the entire lamina about the y-axis.


 
 , over the closed surface.


 
 , over the closed surface.
Example 1.
Find the center of mass of a lamina with edges given by the lines 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where the density is given as 
 
 
 
 .













































center of mass is at the point



Planar laminas can be used to determine moments of inertia, or center of mass.
