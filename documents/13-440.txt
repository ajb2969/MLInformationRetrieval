   Radioactive Instability in the Nucleus – Formula      Radioactive Instability in the Nucleus – Formula   When calculating the unstable fraction of the radioactivity in the original isotope  nucleus , there is a simple equation which can help you find the fraction of unstable nuclei still radioactive after a given period of half-lives.  Equation  $p=1/2^n$  when $p$ is the fraction of unstable nucleus, and $n$ the number of half lives.  Example:  Q: The half-life of Cobalt-60 is 5 years. After 225 years, what fraction of the Cobalt-60 is still unstable?''  A: (225÷5=45 will find you the number of half lives.)''  $p=1/2^n$  $p=1/2^{45}$  "  Category:Radioactivity
