Nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H)

Nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H) (, assimilatory nitrate reductase, assimilatory NAD(P)H-nitrate reductase, NAD(P)H bispecific nitrate reductase, nitrate reductase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)), nitrate reductase NAD(P)H, NAD(P)H-nitrate reductase, nitrate reductase [NAD(P)H2], NAD(P)H2:nitrate oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name nitrite:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.1234 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction

nitrite + NAD(P)+ + H2O 
 
 
nitrate + NAD(P)H + H+


Nitrate reductase is an iron-sulfur molybdenum flavoprotein.
