   Nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H)      Nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H)   Nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H) (, assimilatory nitrate reductase , assimilatory NAD(P)H-nitrate reductase , NAD(P)H bispecific nitrate reductase , nitrate reductase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)) , nitrate reductase NAD(P)H , NAD(P)H-nitrate reductase , nitrate reductase [NAD(P)H 2 ] , NAD(P)H 2 :nitrate oxidoreductase ) is an enzyme with system name nitrite:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction   nitrite + NAD(P) + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    nitrate + NAD(P)H + H +    Nitrate reductase is an iron-sulfur molybdenum flavoprotein.
