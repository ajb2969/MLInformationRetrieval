Q-Hahn polynomials

In mathematics, the q-Hahn polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme.  give a detailed list of their properties.
Definition
The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by 
 
 

Orthogonality
Recurrence and difference relations
Rodrigues formula
Generating function
Relation to other polynomials
q-Hahn polynomials→ Quantum q-Krawtchouk polynomials：



q-Hahn polynomials→ Hahn polynomials
make the substitution
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
  into definition of q-Hahn polynomials, and find the limit q→1, we obtain
： 
 
 
 
 ，which is exactly Hahn polynomials.
