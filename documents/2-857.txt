   Poisson's equation      Poisson's equation   In mathematics , Poisson's equation is a partial differential equation of elliptic type with broad utility in electrostatics , mechanical engineering and theoretical physics . It is used, for instance, to describe the potential energy field caused by a given charge or mass density distribution. The equation is named after the French  mathematician , geometer , and physicist  Sim√©on Denis Poisson . 1  Statement of the equation  Poisson's equation is       Œî  œÜ   =  f        normal-Œî  œÜ   f    \Delta\varphi=f     where   Œî   normal-Œî   \Delta   is the Laplace operator , and f and œÜ are real or complex -valued functions on a manifold . Usually, f is given and œÜ is sought. When the manifold is Euclidean space , the Laplace operator is often denoted as ‚àá 2 and so Poisson's equation is frequently written as         ‚àá  2   œÜ   =  f   .        superscript  normal-‚àá  2   œÜ   f    \nabla^{2}\varphi=f.     In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates , it takes the form         (     ‚àÇ  2    ‚àÇ   x  2     +    ‚àÇ  2    ‚àÇ   y  2     +    ‚àÇ  2    ‚àÇ   z  2      )   œÜ   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =   f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     .             superscript   2      superscript  x  2        superscript   2      superscript  y  2        superscript   2      superscript  z  2      œÜ   x  y  z      f   x  y  z      \left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}+%
 \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial z^{2}}\right)\varphi(x,y,z)=f(x,y,z).     When    f  =  0      f  0    f=0   we retrieve Laplace's equation .  Poisson's equation may be solved using a Green's function ; a general exposition of the Green's function for Poisson's equation is given in the article on the screened Poisson equation . There are various methods for numerical solution. The relaxation method , an iterative algorithm, is one example.  Newtonian gravity  In the case of a gravitational field g due to an attracting massive object of density œÅ , Gauss's law for gravity in differential form can be used to obtain the corresponding Poisson equation for gravity:       ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  ùïò   =   -   4  œÄ  G  œÅ         normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  ùïò       4  œÄ  G  œÅ      \nabla\cdot\mathbb{g}=-4\pi G\rho     Since the gravitational field is conservative, it can be expressed in terms of a scalar potential Œ¶ :      ùïò  =   -   ‚àá  Œ¶        ùïò     normal-‚àá  normal-Œ¶      \mathbb{g}=-\nabla\Phi     Substituting into Gauss's law       ‚àá  ‚ãÖ   (   -   ‚àá  Œ¶    )    =   -   4  œÄ  G  œÅ         normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá     normal-‚àá  normal-Œ¶         4  œÄ  G  œÅ      \nabla\cdot(-\nabla\Phi)=-4\pi G\rho     obtains Poisson's equation for gravity:         ‚àá  2   Œ¶   =   4  œÄ  G  œÅ    .        superscript  normal-‚àá  2   normal-Œ¶     4  œÄ  G  œÅ     {\nabla}^{2}\Phi=4\pi G\rho.     Electrostatics  One of the cornerstones of electrostatics is setting up and solving problems described by the Poisson equation. Solving the Poisson equation amounts to finding the electric potential œÜ for a given charge distribution     œÅ  f     subscript  œÅ  f    \rho_{f}    .  The mathematical details behind Poisson's equation in electrostatics are as follows ( SI units are used rather than Gaussian units , which are also frequently used in electromagnetism ).  Starting with Gauss's law for electricity (also one of Maxwell's equations ) in differential form, we have:       ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  ùêÉ   =   œÅ  f        normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  ùêÉ    subscript  œÅ  f     \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{D}=\rho_{f}     where    ‚àá  ‚ãÖ     fragments  normal-‚àá  normal-‚ãÖ    \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot   is the divergence operator , D = electric displacement field , and œÅ f = free charge  density (describing charges brought from outside). Assuming the medium is linear, isotropic, and homogeneous (see polarization density ), we have the constitutive equation :      ùêÉ  =   Œµ  ùêÑ       ùêÉ    Œµ  ùêÑ     \mathbf{D}=\varepsilon\mathbf{E}     where Œµ = permittivity of the medium and E = electric field . Substituting this into Gauss's law and assuming Œµ is spatially constant in the region of interest obtains:       ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  ùêÑ   =    œÅ  f   Œµ        normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  ùêÑ      subscript  œÅ  f   Œµ     \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{E}=\frac{\rho_{f}}{\varepsilon}     In the absence of a changing magnetic field, B , Faraday's law of induction gives:       ‚àá  √ó  ùêÑ   =   -    ‚àÇ  ùêÅ    ‚àÇ  t     =  0          normal-‚àá  ùêÑ         ùêÅ     t          0     \nabla\times\mathbf{E}=-\dfrac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=0     where    ‚àá  √ó     fragments  normal-‚àá     \nabla\times   is the curl operator and t is time. Since the curl of the electric field is zero, it is defined by a scalar electric potential field,   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   (see Helmholtz decomposition ).      ùêÑ  =   -   ‚àá  œÜ        ùêÑ     normal-‚àá  œÜ      \mathbf{E}=-\nabla\varphi     The derivation of Poisson's equation under these circumstances is straightforward. Substituting the potential gradient for the electric field        ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  ùîº   =   ‚àá  ‚ãÖ   (   -   ‚àá  œÜ    )    =   -    ‚àá  2   œÜ    =    œÅ  f   Œµ    ,         normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  ùîº    normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá     normal-‚àá  œÜ              superscript  normal-‚àá  2   œÜ            subscript  œÅ  f   Œµ      \nabla\cdot\mathbb{E}=\nabla\cdot(-\nabla\varphi)=-{\nabla}^{2}\varphi=\frac{%
 \rho_{f}}{\varepsilon},     directly obtains Poisson's equation for electrostatics, which is:         ‚àá  2   œÜ   =   -    œÅ  f   Œµ     .        superscript  normal-‚àá  2   œÜ        subscript  œÅ  f   Œµ      {\nabla}^{2}\varphi=-\frac{\rho_{f}}{\varepsilon}.     Solving Poisson's equation for the potential requires knowing the charge density distribution. If the charge density is zero, then Laplace's equation results. If the charge density follows a Boltzmann distribution , then the Poisson-Boltzmann equation results. The Poisson‚ÄìBoltzmann equation plays a role in the development of the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory of dilute electrolyte solutions .  The above discussion assumes that the magnetic field is not varying in time. The same Poisson equation arises even if it does vary in time, as long as the Coulomb gauge is used. In this more general context, computing œÜ is no longer sufficient to calculate E , since E also depends on the magnetic vector potential  A , which must be independently computed. See Maxwell's equation in potential formulation for more on œÜ and A in Maxwell's equations and how Poisson's equation is obtained in this case.  Potential of a Gaussian charge density  If there is a static spherically symmetric Gaussian charge density         œÅ  f    (  r  )    =     Q    œÉ  3      2  œÄ    3       e   -    r  2   /   (   2   œÉ  2    )        ,         subscript  œÅ  f   r       Q     superscript  œÉ  3    superscript      2  œÄ    3      superscript  e       superscript  r  2     2   superscript  œÉ  2          \rho_{f}(r)=\frac{Q}{\sigma^{3}\sqrt{2\pi}^{3}}\,e^{-r^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})},     where Q is the total charge, then the solution œÜ ( r ) of Poisson's equation,        ‚àá  2   œÜ   =   -    œÅ  f   Œµ          superscript  normal-‚àá  2   œÜ        subscript  œÅ  f   Œµ      {\nabla}^{2}\varphi=-{\rho_{f}\over\varepsilon}   ,  is given by       œÜ   (  r  )    =    1   4  œÄ  Œµ      Q  r    erf   (   r    2   œÉ    )          œÜ  r       1    4  œÄ  Œµ      Q  r   erf    r      2   œÉ       \varphi(r)={1\over 4\pi\varepsilon}\frac{Q}{r}\,\mbox{erf}\left(\frac{r}{\sqrt%
 {2}\sigma}\right)     where erf( x ) is the error function .  This solution can be checked explicitly by evaluating     ‚àá  2   œÜ      superscript  normal-‚àá  2   œÜ    {\nabla}^{2}\varphi   . Note that, for r much greater than œÉ , the erf function approaches unity and the potential œÜ ( r ) approaches the point charge potential      œÜ  ‚âà    1   4  œÄ  Œµ     Q  r        œÜ      1    4  œÄ  Œµ      Q  r      \varphi\approx{1\over 4\pi\varepsilon}{Q\over r}   ,  as one would expect. Furthermore the erf function approaches 1 extremely quickly as its argument increases; in practice for r > 3 œÉ the relative error is smaller than one part in a thousand.  Surface reconstruction  Poisson's equation is also used to reconstruct a smooth 3D surface based on a large number of points p i (a point cloud ) where each point also carries an estimate of the local surface normal  n i . 2  This technique reconstructs the implicit function  f whose value is zero at the points p i and whose gradient at the points p i equals the normal vectors n i . The set of ( p i , n i ) is thus a sampling of a continuous vector Ô¨Åeld V . The implicit function f is found by integrating the vector Ô¨Åeld V . Since not every vector Ô¨Åeld is the gradient of a function, the problem may or may not have a solution: the necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient condition for a smooth vector Ô¨Åeld V to be the gradient of a function f is that the curl of V must be identically zero. In case this condition is difÔ¨Åcult to impose, it is still possible to perform a least-squares fit to minimize the difference between V and the gradient of f .
