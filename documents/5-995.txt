   Weierstrass factorization theorem      Weierstrass factorization theorem   In mathematics , and particularly in the field of complex analysis , the Weierstrass factorization theorem asserts that entire functions can be represented by a product involving their zeroes . In addition, every sequence tending to infinity has an associated entire function with zeroes at precisely the points of that sequence. The theorem is named after Karl Weierstrass .  A second form of the theorem extends to meromorphic functions and allows one to consider a given meromorphic function as a product of three factors: terms depending on the function's poles and zeroes, and an associated non-zero holomorphic function .  Motivation  The consequences of the fundamental theorem of algebra are twofold. 1 Firstly, any finite sequence    {   c  n   }      subscript  c  n     \{c_{n}\}   in the complex plane has an associated polynomial     p   (  z  )       p  z    p(z)   that has zeroes precisely at the points of that sequence ,      p   (  z  )    =    ∏  n    (   z  -   c  n    )     .        p  z     subscript  product  n     z   subscript  c  n       p(z)=\,\prod_{n}(z-c_{n}).     Secondly, any polynomial function    p   (  z  )       p  z    p(z)   in the complex plane has a factorization        p    (  z  )    =   a    ∏  n    (   z  -   c  n    )      ,        p  z     a    subscript  product  n     z   subscript  c  n        \,p(z)=a\prod_{n}(z-c_{n}),   where a is a non-zero constant and c n are the zeroes of p .  The two forms of the Weierstrass factorization theorem can be thought of as extensions of the above to entire functions. The necessity of extra machinery is demonstrated when one considers the product     ∏  n    (   z  -   c  n    )       subscript  product  n     z   subscript  c  n      \,\prod_{n}(z-c_{n})   if the sequence    {   c  n   }      subscript  c  n     \{c_{n}\}   is not finite . It can never define an entire function, because the infinite product does not converge. Thus one cannot, in general, define an entire function from a sequence of prescribed zeroes or represent an entire function by its zeroes using the expressions yielded by the fundamental theorem of algebra.  A necessary condition for convergence of the infinite product in question is that each factor    (   z  -   c  n    )      z   subscript  c  n     (z-c_{n})   must approach 1 as    n  →  ∞     normal-→  n     n\to\infty   . So it stands to reason that one should seek a function that could be 0 at a prescribed point, yet remain near 1 when not at that point and furthermore introduce no more zeroes than those prescribed. Weierstrass' elementary factors have these properties and serve the same purpose as the factors    (   z  -   c  n    )      z   subscript  c  n     (z-c_{n})   above.  The elementary factors  These are also referred to as primary factors . 2  For    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   , define the elementary factors : 3        E  n    (  z  )    =   {      (   1  -  z   )        if  n   =  0   ,         (   1  -  z   )    exp   (      z  1   1    +     z  2   2    +  ⋯  +     z  n   n     )        otherwise  .              subscript  E  n   z    cases    1  z       if  n   0       1  z          superscript  z  1   1      superscript  z  2   2   normal-⋯     superscript  z  n   n      otherwise     E_{n}(z)=\begin{cases}(1-z)&\text{if }n=0,\\
 (1-z)\exp\left(\frac{z^{1}}{1}+\frac{z^{2}}{2}+\cdots+\frac{z^{n}}{n}\right)&%
 \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}     Their utility lies in the following lemma: 4  Lemma (15.8, Rudin) for | z | ≤ 1, n ∈ N o        |   1  -    E  n    (  z  )     |   ≤    |  z  |    n  +  1     .          1     subscript  E  n   z      superscript    z     n  1      |1-E_{n}(z)|\leq|z|^{n+1}.     The two forms of the theorem  Existence of entire function with specified zeroes  Sometimes called the Weierstrass theorem . 5  Let    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   be a sequence of non-zero complex numbers such that     |   a  n   |   →  ∞     normal-→     subscript  a  n       |a_{n}|\to\infty   . If    {   p  n   }      subscript  p  n     \{p_{n}\}   is any sequence of integers such that for all    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   ,         ∑   n  =  1   ∞     (   r  /   |   a  n   |    )    1  +   p  n      <  ∞   ,        superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript    r     subscript  a  n       1   subscript  p  n         \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(r/|a_{n}|\right)^{1+p_{n}}<\infty,   then the function       f   (  z  )    =    ∏   n  =  1   ∞     E   p  n     (   z  /   a  n    )           f  z     superscript   subscript  product    n  1         subscript  E   subscript  p  n      z   subscript  a  n        f(z)=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}E_{p_{n}}(z/a_{n})   is entire with zeros only at points    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   . If number    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   occurs in sequence    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   exactly m times, then function f has a zero at    z  =   z  0       z   subscript  z  0     z=z_{0}   of multiplicity m .   Note that the sequence    {   p  n   }      subscript  p  n     \{p_{n}\}   in the statement of the theorem always exists. For example we could always take     p  n   =  n       subscript  p  n   n    p_{n}=n   and have the convergence. Such a sequence is not unique: changing it at finite number of positions, or taking another sequence p' n ≥ p n , will not break the convergence.  The theorem generalizes to the following: sequences in open subsets (and hence regions ) of the Riemann sphere have associated functions that are holomorphic in those subsets and have zeroes at the points of the sequence. 6  Note also that the case given by the fundamental theorem of algebra is incorporated here. If the sequence    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   is finite then we can take     p  n   =  0       subscript  p  n   0    p_{n}=0   and obtain      f    (  z  )    =    c     ∏  n    (   z  -   a  n    )           f  z     c    subscript  product  n     z   subscript  a  n        \,f(z)=c\,{\displaystyle\prod}_{n}(z-a_{n})   .   The Weierstrass factorization theorem  Sometimes called the Weierstrass product/factor theorem. 7  Let ƒ be an entire function, and let    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   be the non-zero zeros of ƒ repeated according to multiplicity; suppose also that ƒ has a zero at z = 0 of order m ≥ 0 (a zero of order m = 0 at z = 0 means ƒ (0) ≠ 0). Then there exists an entire function g and a sequence of integers    {   p  n   }      subscript  p  n     \{p_{n}\}   such that        f   (  z  )    =    z  m    e   g   (  z  )       ∏   n  =  1   ∞      E   p  n      (   z   a  n    )       .        f  z      superscript  z  m    superscript  e    g  z      superscript   subscript  product    n  1         subscript  E   subscript  p  n      z   subscript  a  n         f(z)=z^{m}e^{g(z)}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}E_{p_{n}}\!\!\left(\frac{z}{a_{n}}\right).    8  Examples of factorization        sin   π  z    =   π  z    ∏   n  ≠  0      (   1  -   z  n    )    e   z  /  n       =   π  z    ∏   n  =  1   ∞    (   1  -    z  2    n  2     )               π  z      π  z    subscript  product    n  0        1    z  n     superscript  e    z  n              π  z    superscript   subscript  product    n  1        1     superscript  z  2    superscript  n  2          \sin\pi z=\pi z\prod_{n\neq 0}\left(1-\frac{z}{n}\right)e^{z/n}=\pi z\prod_{n=%
