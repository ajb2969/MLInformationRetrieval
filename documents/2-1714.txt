   Cramér's conjecture      Cramér's conjecture   In number theory , Cramér's conjecture , formulated by the Swedish mathematician Harald Cramér in 1936, 1 is an estimate for the size of gaps between consecutive prime numbers : intuitively, that gaps between consecutive primes are always small, and the conjecture quantifies asymptotically just how small they must be. It states that         p   n  +  1    -   p  n    =   O   (    (   log   p  n    )   2   )     ,         subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n      O   superscript     subscript  p  n    2      p_{n+1}-p_{n}=O((\log p_{n})^{2}),   where p n denotes the n th prime number , O is big O notation , and "log" is the natural logarithm . While this is the statement explicitly conjectured by Cramér, his argument actually supports the stronger statement         lim sup   n  →  ∞       p   n  +  1    -   p  n      (   log   p  n    )   2     =  1   ,        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n          subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n     superscript     subscript  p  n    2     1    \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_{n}}{(\log p_{n})^{2}}=1,   and this formulation is often called Cramér's conjecture in the literature.  Neither form of Cramér's conjecture has yet been proven or disproven.  Conditional proven results on prime gaps  Cramér gave a conditional proof of the much weaker statement that        p   n  +  1    -   p  n    =   O   (      p  n      log   p  n     )           subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n      O       subscript  p  n       subscript  p  n        p_{n+1}-p_{n}=O(\sqrt{p_{n}}\,\log p_{n})   on the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis . 2  In the other direction, E. Westzynthius proved in 1931 that prime gaps grow more than logarithmically. That is, 3         lim sup   n  →  ∞       p   n  +  1    -   p  n     log   p  n      =  ∞   .        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n          subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n       subscript  p  n         \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_{n}}{\log p_{n}}=\infty.     Heuristic justification  Cramér's conjecture is based on a probabilistic model (essentially a heuristic ) of the primes, in which one assumes that the probability of a natural number of size x being prime is 1/log x . This is known as the Cramér model of the primes. Cramér proved that in this model, the above conjecture holds true with probability one . 4  Related conjectures and heuristics   Daniel Shanks conjectured asymptotic equality of record gaps, a somewhat stronger statement than Cramér's conjecture. 5  In the Cramér random model,         lim sup   n  →  ∞       p   n  +  1    -   p  n      (   log   p  n    )   2     =  c   ,        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n          subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n     superscript     subscript  p  n    2     c    \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_{n}}{(\log p_{n})^{2}}=c,   with    c  =  1.      c  1.    c=1.   However, as pointed out by Andrew Granville , 6  Maier's theorem shows that the Cramér random model does not adequately describe the distribution of primes, and a refinement of Cramér's model taking into account divisibility by small primes suggests that    c  ≥   2   e   -  γ     ≈   1.1229  …         c    2   superscript  e    γ            1.1229  normal-…      c\geq 2e^{-\gamma}\approx 1.1229\ldots   (), where   γ   γ   \gamma   is the Euler–Mascheroni constant .  In the paper 7 J.H. Cadwell has proposed the formula for the maximal gaps:      G   (  x  )    ∼    ln   (  x  )     (    ln   (  x  )    -   ln   ln   (   (  x  )   )      )     ,     similar-to    G  x       x       x       x        G(x)\sim\ln(x)(\ln(x)-\ln\ln((x))),   which for large   x   x   x   goes into the Cramer's conjecture     G   (  x  )    ∼    ln  2    (  x  )       similar-to    G  x     superscript   2   x     G(x)\sim\ln^{2}(x)   .  Thomas Nicely has calculated many large prime gaps. 8 He measures the quality of fit to Cramér's conjecture by measuring the ratio       R  =    log   (   p  n   )       p   n  +  1    -   p  n       .      R       subscript  p  n         subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n        R=\frac{\log(p_{n})}{\sqrt{p_{n+1}-p_{n}}}.     He writes, “For the largest known maximal gaps,   R   R   R   has remained near 1.13.” However,    1  /   R  2       1   superscript  R  2     1/R^{2}   is still less than 1, and it does not provide support to Granville's refinement that c should be greater than 1.
