   Friendship graph      Friendship graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the friendship graph (or Dutch windmill graph or n -fan ) F n is a planar  undirected graph with 2n+1 vertices and 3n edges. 1  The friendship graph F n can be constructed by joining n copies of the cycle graph  C 3 with a common vertex. 2  By construction, the friendship graph F n is isomorphic to the windmill graph Wd(3, n ). It is unit distance with girth 3, diameter 2 and radius 1. The graph F 2 is isomorphic to the butterfly graph .  Friendship theorem  The friendship theorem of 3 states that the finite graphs with the property that every two vertices have exactly one neighbor in common are exactly the friendship graphs. Informally, if a group of people has the property that every pair of people has exactly one friend in common, then there must be one person who is a friend to all the others. However, for infinite graphs, there can be many different graphs with the same cardinality that have this property. 4 A combinatorial proof was given by Mertzios and Unger. 5 Another proof was given by Craig Huneke 6  Labeling and colouring  The friendship graph has chromatic number 3 and chromatic index  2n . Its chromatic polynomial can be deduced from the chromatic polynomial of the cycle graph C 3 and is equal to      (   x  -  2   )   n     (   x  -  1   )   n   x       superscript    x  2   n    superscript    x  1   n   x    (x-2)^{n}(x-1)^{n}x   .  The friendship graph F n is edge-graceful if and only if n is odd. It is graceful if and only if n ≡ 0 (mod 4) or n ≡ 1 (mod 4). 7 8  Every friendship graph is factor-critical .  Extremal graph theory  According to extremal graph theory , every graph with sufficiently many edges (relative to its number of vertices) must contain a k -fan. More specifically, this is true for an n -vertex graph if the number of edges is        ⌊    n  2   4   ⌋   +   f   (  k  )     ,           superscript  n  2   4      f  k     \left\lfloor\frac{n^{2}}{4}\right\rfloor+f(k),   where f ( k ) is k 2 − k if k is odd, and f ( k ) is k 2 − 3 k /2 if k is even. These bounds generalize Turán's theorem on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph , and they are the best possible bounds for this problem, in that for any smaller number of edges there exist graphs that do not contain a k -fan. 9  References  "  Category:Parametric families of graphs  Category:Planar graphs     ↩  Gallian, J.
