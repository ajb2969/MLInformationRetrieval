Formimidoylglutamase

In enzymology, a formimidoylglutamase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-glutamate + formamide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate and H2O, whereas its two products are L-glutamate and formamide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-formimidoyl-L-glutamate formimidoylhydrolase. Other names in common use include formiminoglutamase, N-formiminoglutamate hydrolase, and N-formimino-L-glutamate formiminohydrolase. This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
