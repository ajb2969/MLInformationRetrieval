UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing)

UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing) (, UDP-Bac2Ac4Ac 2-epimerase, NeuC) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine hydrolase (2-epimerising).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  UDP + 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-mannopyranose
 

This enzyme requires Mg2+. It is involved in biosynthesis of legionaminic acid.
