   UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing)      UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing)   UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing) (, UDP-Bac2Ac4Ac 2-epimerase , NeuC ) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine hydrolase (2-epimerising) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-mannopyranose   This enzyme requires Mg 2+ . It is involved in biosynthesis of legionaminic acid .  References  External links     "  Category:EC 3.2.1     ↩  ↩
