   Trans-epoxysuccinate hydrolase      Trans-epoxysuccinate hydrolase   In enzymology , a trans-epoxysuccinate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   meso-tartrate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate and H 2 O , whereas its product is meso-tartrate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate hydrolase . Other names in common use include trans-epoxysuccinate hydratase , and tartrate epoxydase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
