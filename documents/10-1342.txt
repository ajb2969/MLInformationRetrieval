   Diferric-transferrin reductase      Diferric-transferrin reductase   In enzymology , a diferric-transferrin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   transferrin[Fe(II)]2 + NAD + + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   transferrin[Fe(III)]2 + NADH   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are [[transferrin[Fe(II)]2]], NAD + , and H + , whereas its two products are [[transferrin[Fe(III)]2]] and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those oxidizing metal ion with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is transferrin[Fe(II)]2:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include diferric transferrin reductase , NADH diferric transferrin reductase , and transferrin reductase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
