   Histidine N-acetyltransferase      Histidine N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a histidine N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + L-histidine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-acetyl-L-histidine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and L-histidine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-L-histidine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:L-histidine N-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include acetylhistidine synthetase , and histidine acetyltransferase .
