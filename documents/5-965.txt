The two functions of dagesh are distinguished as either kal (light) or hazak (strong). The six letters are bet , gimel, daled , kaph , pe , and taf . Three of them (bet, kaph, and pe) have their sound value changed in modern Hebrew from the fricative to the plosive by adding a dagesh.

In Egypt and Yemen (mostly Tihama), it is normally pronounced  (as in Hebrew and the other Semitic languages).
