   Kirby–Siebenmann class      Kirby–Siebenmann class   In mathematics , the Kirby–Siebenmann class is an element of the fourth cohomology group       e   (  M  )    ∈    H  4    (  M  ;   𝐙  2   )          e  M      superscript  H  4    M   subscript  𝐙  2       e(M)\in H^{4}(M;\mathbf{Z}_{2})   which must vanish if a topological manifold  M is to have a piecewise linear structure . It is named for Robion Kirby and Larry Siebenmann .  See also   Hauptvermutung   References     Topology of 4-Manifolds by Robion C.
