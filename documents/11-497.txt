   (glycogen-synthase-D) phosphatase      (glycogen-synthase-D) phosphatase   In enzymology , a [glycogen-synthase-D] phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [glycogen-synthase D] + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [glycogen-synthase I] + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycogen-synthase D and H 2 O , whereas its two products are glycogen-synthase I and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [UDP-glucose:glycogen 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase-D] phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase , UDP-glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase , UDPglucose-glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase , glycogen glucosyltransferase phosphatase , glycogen synthetase phosphatase , glycogen synthase phosphatase , glycogen synthase D phosphatase , Mg 2+ dependent glycogen synthase phosphatase , and phosphatase type 2_degree_C .
