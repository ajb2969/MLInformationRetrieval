Series multisection

In mathematics, a multisection of a power series is a new power series composed of equally spaced terms extracted unaltered from the original series. Formally, if one is given a power series



then its multisection is a power series of the form



where c, d are integers, with 0 â‰¤ d F(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n\cdot x^n
has a closed-form expression in terms of the function 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  is a primitive c-th root of unity.
Example
Multisection of a binomial



at x = 1 gives the following identity for the sum of binomial coefficients with step c:
