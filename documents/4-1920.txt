   Dual basis in a field extension      Dual basis in a field extension   In mathematics , the linear algebra concept of dual basis can be applied in the context of a finite extension  L / K , by using the field trace . This requires the property that the field trace Tr L / K provides a non-degenerate  quadratic form over K . This can be guaranteed if the extension is separable ; it is automatically true if K is a perfect field , and hence in the cases where K is finite, or of characteristic zero.  A dual basis is not a concrete basis like the polynomial basis or the normal basis ; rather it provides a way of using a second basis for computations.  Consider two bases for elements in a finite field , GF( p m ):       B  1   =    α  0   ,   α  1   ,  …  ,   α   m  -  1          subscript  B  1     subscript  α  0    subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α    m  1       B_{1}={\alpha_{0},\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{m-1}}     and       B  2   =    γ  0   ,   γ  1   ,  …  ,   γ   m  -  1          subscript  B  2     subscript  γ  0    subscript  γ  1   normal-…   subscript  γ    m  1       B_{2}={\gamma_{0},\gamma_{1},\ldots,\gamma_{m-1}}     then B 2 can be considered a dual basis of B 1 provided      Tr   (   α  i   ⋅   γ  j   )   =   {      0  ,       if  i   ≠  j        1  ,     otherwise         fragments  Tr   fragments  normal-(   subscript  α  i   normal-⋅   subscript  γ  j   normal-)     fragments  normal-{    0     if  i   j     1  otherwise       \operatorname{Tr}(\alpha_{i}\cdot\gamma_{j})=\left\{\begin{matrix}0,&%
 \operatorname{if}\ i\neq j\\
 1,&\operatorname{otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.     Here the trace of a value in GF( p m ) can be calculated as follows:       Tr   (  β  )    =    ∑   i  =  0    m  -  1     β   p  i          Tr  β     superscript   subscript     i  0      m  1     superscript  β   superscript  p  i       \operatorname{Tr}(\beta)=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\beta^{p^{i}}     Using a dual basis can provide a way to easily communicate between devices that use different bases, rather than having to explicitly convert between bases using the change of bases formula. Furthermore, if a dual basis is implemented then conversion from an element in the original basis to the dual basis can be accomplished with a multiplication by the multiplicative identity (usually 1).
