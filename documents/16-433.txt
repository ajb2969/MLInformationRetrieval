3, [6,3,5] |- |Properties||Regular |} In the field of hyperbolic geometry, the order-5 hexagonal tiling honeycomb arises one of 11 regular paracompact honeycombs in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. It is called paracompact because it has infinite cells. Each cell consists of a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere: a flat plane in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.
The Schläfli symbol of the order-5 hexagonal tiling honeycomb is {6,3,5}. Since that of the hexagonal tiling of the plane is {6,3}, this honeycomb has five such hexagonal tilings meeting at each edge. Since the Schläfli symbol of the icosahedron is {3,5}, the vertex figure of this honeycomb is an icosahedron. Thus, 20 hexagonal tilings meet at each vertex of this honeycomb.1 
Symmetry
A lower symmetry, [6,(3,5)*], index 120 construction exists with regular dodecahedral fundamental domains, and a icosahedral shaped Coxeter diagram with 6 axial infinite order (ultraparallel) branches.
Images
It is similar to the 2D hyperbolic regular tiling, {∞,5}, with infinite apeirogonal faces, and 5 meeting around every vertex (peak).
