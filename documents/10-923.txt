   Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,6-dihydrouracil + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6-dihydrouracil and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are uracil , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6-dihydrouracil:NADP+ 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include:   dihydrothymine dehydrogenase  dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NADP+)  4,5-dihydrothymine: oxidoreductase  DPD  DHPDH  dehydrogenase, dihydrouracil (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , phosphate)  DHU dehydrogenase  hydropyrimidine dehydrogenase  dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (NADP+)   This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : pyrimidine metabolism , beta-alanine metabolism , and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
