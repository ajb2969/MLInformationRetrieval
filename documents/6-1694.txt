   Bosonization      Bosonization   In theoretical  condensed matter physics , Bosonization is a mathematical procedure by which a system of interacting fermions in (1+1) dimensions can be transformed to a system of massless, non-interacting bosons . 1 The method of bosonization was conceived independently by particle physicists Sidney Coleman and Stanley Mandelstam ; and condensed matter physicists Daniel Mattis and Alan Luther in 1975. 2  The basic physical idea behind bosonization is that particle-hole excitations are bosonic in character. However, it was shown by Tomonaga in 1950 that this principle is only valid in one-dimensional systems. 3 Bosonization is an effective field theory that focuses on low-energy excitations. 4 This is done for Luttinger liquid theory .  Two complex fermions    ψ  ,   ψ  ¯      ψ   normal-¯  ψ     \psi,\bar{\psi}   are written as functions of a boson   ϕ   ϕ   \phi           ψ  ¯   -    ψ  +   =  :  exp   (  i  ϕ  )   :  ,    ψ  ¯   -    ψ  +   =  :  exp   (  -  i  ϕ  )   :     fragments   subscript   normal-¯  ψ      subscript  ψ     normal-:    fragments  normal-(  i  ϕ  normal-)   normal-:  normal-,   subscript   normal-¯  ψ      subscript  ψ     normal-:    fragments  normal-(   i  ϕ  normal-)   normal-:    \bar{\psi}_{-}\psi_{+}=:\exp(i\phi):,\qquad\bar{\psi}_{-}\psi_{+}=:\exp(-i\phi):    5 while the inverse map is given by      ∂  ϕ  =  :   ψ  ¯   ψ  :     fragments   ϕ   normal-:   normal-¯  ψ   ψ  normal-:    \partial\phi=:\bar{\psi}\psi:   All equations are normal-ordered . The changed statistics arises from anomalous dimensions of the fields.
