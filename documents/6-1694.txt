Bosonization

In theoretical condensed matter physics, Bosonization is a mathematical procedure by which a system of interacting fermions in (1+1) dimensions can be transformed to a system of massless, non-interacting bosons.1 The method of bosonization was conceived independently by particle physicists Sidney Coleman and Stanley Mandelstam; and condensed matter physicists Daniel Mattis and Alan Luther in 1975.2
The basic physical idea behind bosonization is that particle-hole excitations are bosonic in character. However, it was shown by Tomonaga in 1950 that this principle is only valid in one-dimensional systems.3 Bosonization is an effective field theory that focuses on low-energy excitations.4 This is done for Luttinger liquid theory.

  All equations are normal-ordered. The changed statistics arises from anomalous dimensions of the fields.

In actuality, there is a cocycle prefactor to give correct (anti-)commutation relations with other fields under consideration.
