Townsend (unit)

The Townsend (symbol Td) is a physical unit of the reduced electric field (ratio E/N), where 
 
 
 
  is electric field and 
 
 
 
  is concentration of neutral particles. It is defined by the relation





For example, an electric field of 
 
 
 
  in a medium with density 
 
 
 
  gives 
 
 
 
 , which corresponds to 
 
 
 
 .
This unit is important in gas discharge physics, where it serves as scaling parameter because the mean energy of electrons (and therefore many other properties of discharge) is typically a function of 
 
 
 
  over broad range of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The concentration 
 
 
 
 , which is in ideal gas simply related to pressure and temperature, controls the mean free path and collision frequency. The electric field 
 
 
 
  governs the energy gained between two successive collisions.
Reduced electric field being a scaling factor effectively means, that increasing the electric field intensity E by some factor q has the same consequences as lowering gas density N by factor q.
It is named after John Sealy Townsend.
