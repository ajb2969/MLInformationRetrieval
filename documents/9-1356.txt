   Townsend (unit)      Townsend (unit)   The Townsend (symbol Td) is a physical unit of the reduced electric field ( ratio E/N ), where   E   E   E   is electric field and   N   N   N   is concentration of neutral particles. It is defined by the relation          1   Td   =      10   -  21     V   ⋅   m  2    =      10   -  17     V   ⋅   cm  2     .          1  Td    normal-⋅     superscript  10    21    normal-V    superscript  normal-m  2          normal-⋅     superscript  10    17    normal-V    superscript  cm  2       1\,{\rm Td}=10^{-21}\,{\rm V\cdot m^{2}}=10^{-17}\,{\rm V\cdot cm^{2}}.      For example, an electric field of    E  =     2.5  ⋅    10  4     V   /  m       E       normal-⋅  2.5   superscript  10  4    normal-V   normal-m     E=2.5\cdot 10^{4}\,{\rm V/m}   in a medium with density    N  =    2.5  ⋅    10  25      m   -  3         N     normal-⋅  2.5   superscript  10  25     superscript  normal-m    3       N=2.5\cdot 10^{25}\,{\rm m^{-3}}   gives     E  /  N   =      10   -  21     V   ⋅   m  2          E  N    normal-⋅     superscript  10    21    normal-V    superscript  normal-m  2      E/N=10^{-21}\,{\rm V\cdot m^{2}}   , which corresponds to     1   Td      1  Td    1\,{\rm Td}   .  This unit is important in gas discharge physics, where it serves as scaling parameter because the mean energy of electrons (and therefore many other properties of discharge) is typically a function of    E  /  N      E  N    E/N   over broad range of   E   E   E   and   N   N   N   . The concentration   N   N   N   , which is in ideal gas simply related to pressure and temperature, controls the mean free path and collision frequency . The electric field   E   E   E   governs the energy gained between two successive collisions.  Reduced electric field being a scaling factor effectively means, that increasing the electric field intensity E by some factor q has the same consequences as lowering gas density N by factor q .  It is named after John Sealy Townsend .  See also   Electric glow discharge  Vacuum arc   "  Category:Electrical breakdown  Category:Plasma physics
