   Commutative ring spectrum      Commutative ring spectrum   In the mathematical field of algebraic topology , a commutative ring spectrum , roughly equivalent to a     E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   -ring spectrum , is a commutative monoid in a good 1 category of spectra .  The category of commutative ring spectra over the field   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   of rational numbers is Quillen equivalent to the category of differential graded algebras over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   .  Example: The Witten genus may be realized as a morphism of commutative ring spectra MString → tmf .  See also: simplicial commutative ring , highly structured ring spectrum and derived scheme .  Terminology  Almost all reasonable categories of commutative ring spectra can be shown to be Quillen equivalent to each other. Thus, from the point view of the stable homotopy theory , the term "commutative ring spectrum" may be used as a synonymous to an    E  ∞     subscript  E     E_{\infty}   -ring spectrum.
