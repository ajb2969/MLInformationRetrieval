   Crossed product      Crossed product   In mathematics , and more specifically in the theory of von Neumann algebras , a crossed product is a basic method of constructing a new von Neumann algebra from a von Neumann algebra acted on by a group . It is related to the semidirect product construction for groups. (Roughly speaking, crossed product is the expected structure for a group ring of a semidirect product group. Therefore crossed products have a ring theory aspect also. This article concentrates on an important case, where they appear in functional analysis .)  Motivation  Recall that if we have two finite groups    G   G   G   and N with an action of G on N we can form the semidirect product    N  ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  N  G    N\rtimes G   . This contains N as a normal subgroup , and the action of G on N is given by conjugation in the semidirect product. We can replace N by its complex group algebra  C [ N ], and again form a product     C   [  N  ]    ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product    C   delimited-[]  N    G    C[N]\rtimes G   in a similar way; this algebra is a sum of subspaces  gC [ N ] as g runs through the elements of G , and is the group algebra of    N  ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  N  G    N\rtimes G   . We can generalize this construction further by replacing C [ N ] by any algebra A acted on by G to get a crossed product    A  ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  A  G    A\rtimes G   , which is the sum of subspaces gA and where the action of G on A is given by conjugation in the crossed product.  The crossed product of a von Neumann algebra by a group G acting on it is similar except that we have to be more careful about topologies , and need to construct a Hilbert space acted on by the crossed product. (Note that the von Neumann algebra crossed product is usually larger than the algebraic crossed product discussed above; in fact it is some sort of completion of the algebraic crossed product.)  In physics, this structure appears in presence of the so called gauge group of the first kind. G is the gauge group, and N the "field" algebra. The observables are then defined as the fixed points of N under the action of G . A result by Doplicher, Haag and Roberts says that under some assumptions the crossed product can be recovered from the algebra of observables.  Construction  Suppose that A is a von Neumann algebra of operators acting on a Hilbert space H and G is a discrete group acting on A . We let K be the Hilbert space of all square summable H -valued functions on G . There is an action of A on K given by   a(k)(g) = g −1 (a)k(g)   for k in K , g , h in G , and a in A , and there is an action of G on K given by   g(k)(h) = k(g −1 h).   The crossed product    A  ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  A  G    A\rtimes G   is the von Neumann algebra acting on K generated by the actions of A and G on K . It does not depend (up to isomorphism) on the choice of the Hilbert space H .  This construction can be extended to work for any locally compact group G acting on any von Neumann algebra A . When   A   A   A   is an abelian von Neumann algebra , this is the original group-measure space construction of Murray and von Neumann .  Properties  We let G be an infinite countable discrete group acting on the abelian von Neumann algebra A . The action is called free if A has no non-zero projections p such that some nontrivial g fixes all elements of pAp . The action is called ergodic if the only invariant projections are 0 and 1. Usually A can be identified as the abelian von Neumann algebra     L  ∞    (  X  )        superscript  L    X    L^{\infty}(X)   of essentially bounded functions on a measure space  X acted on by G , and then the action of G on X is ergodic (for any measurable invariant subset, either the subset or its complement has measure 0) if and only if the action of G on A is ergodic.  If the action of G on A is free and ergodic then the crossed product    A  ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  A  G    A\rtimes G   is a factor. Moreover:   The factor is of type I if A has a minimal projection such that 1 is the sum of the G conjugates of this projection. This corresponds to the action of G on X being transitive. Example: X is the integers, and G is the group of integers acting by translations.    The factor has type II 1 if A has a faithful finite normal G -invariant trace. This corresponds to X having a finite G invariant measure, absolutely continuous with respect to the measure on X . Example: X is the unit circle in the complex plane, and G is the group of all roots of unity.  The factor has type II ∞ if it is not of types I or II 1 and has a faithful semifinite normal G -invariant trace. This corresponds to X having an infinite G invariant measure without atoms, absolutely continuous with respect to the measure on X . Example: X is the real line, and G is the group of rationals acting by translations.  The factor has type III if A has no faithful semifinite normal G -invariant trace. This corresponds to X having no non-zero absolutely continuous G -invariant measure. Example: X is the real line, and G is the group of all transformations ax + b for a and b rational, a non-zero.   In particular one can construct examples of all the different types of factors as crossed products.  Duality  If   A   A   A   is a von Neumann algebra on which a locally compact Abelian   G   G   G   acts, then   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   , the dual group of characters    χ   χ   \chi   of   G   G   G   , acts by unitaries on   K   K   K   :         (   χ  ⋅  k   )    (  h  )    =   χ   (  h  )   k   (  h  )           normal-⋅  χ  k   h     χ  h  k  h     (\chi\cdot k)(h)=\chi(h)k(h)      These unitaries normalise the crossed product, defining the dual action of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   . Together with the crossed product, they generate     A  ⊗  B    (    L  2    (  G  )    )        tensor-product  A  B      superscript  L  2   G     A\otimes B(L^{2}(G))   , which can be identified with the iterated crossed product by the dual action     (   A  ⋊  G   )   ⋊  Γ     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product   right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  A  G   normal-Γ    (A\rtimes G)\rtimes\Gamma   . Under this identification, the double dual action of   G   G   G   (the dual group of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   ) corresponds to the tensor product of the original action on   A   A   A   and conjugation by the following unitaries on     L  2    (  G  )        superscript  L  2   G    L^{2}(G)   :         (   g  ⋅  f   )    (  h  )    =   f   (   h  g   )           normal-⋅  g  f   h     f    h  g      (g\cdot f)(h)=f(hg)      The crossed product may be identified with the fixed point algebra of the double dual action. More generally   A   A   A   is the fixed point algebra of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   in the crossed product.  Similar statements hold when   G   G   G   is replaced by a non-Abelian locally compact group or more generally a locally compact quantum group , a class of Hopf algebra related to von Neumann algebras . An analogous theory has also been developed for actions on C* algebras and their crossed products.  Duality first appeared for actions of the reals in the work of Connes and Takesaki on the classification of Type III factors . According to Tomita–Takesaki theory , every vector which is cyclic for the factor and its commutant gives rise to a 1-parameter modular automorphism group . The corresponding crossed product is a Type    I   I  ∞       I   subscript  I      II_{\infty}    von Neumann algebra and the corresponding dual action restricts to an ergodic action of the reals on its centre, an Abelian von Neumann algebra . This ergodic flow is called the flow of weights ; it is independent of the choice of cyclic vector. The Connes spectrum , a closed subgroup of the positive reals ℝ + , is obtained by applying the exponential to the kernel of this flow.   When the kernel is the whole of   R   R   R   , the factor is type    I  I   I  1       I  I   subscript  I  1     III_{1}   .  When the kernel is     (   log  λ   )   Z        λ   Z    (\log\lambda)Z   for   λ   λ   \lambda   in (0,1), the factor is type    I  I   I  λ       I  I   subscript  I  λ     III_{\lambda}   .  When the kernel is trivial, the factor is type    I  I   I  0       I  I   subscript  I  0     III_{0}   .   Connes and Haagerup proved that the Connes spectrum and the flow of weights are complete invariants of hyperfinite  Type III factors . From this classification and results in ergodic theory , it is known that every infinite-dimensional hyperfinite factor has the form      L  ∞    (  X  )    ⋊  Z     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product     superscript  L    X   Z    L^{\infty}(X)\rtimes Z   for some free ergodic action of   Z   Z   Z   .  Examples   If we take the algebra A to be the complex numbers C , then the crossed product    A  ⋊  G     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  A  G    A\rtimes G   is called the von Neumann group algebra of G .    If G is an infinite discrete group such that every conjugacy class has infinite order then the von Neumann group algebra is a factor of type II 1 . Moreover if every finite set of elements of G generates a finite subgroup (or more generally if G is amenable) then the factor is the hyperfinite factor of type II 1 .
