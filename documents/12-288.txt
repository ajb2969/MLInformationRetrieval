Generalized Korteweg窶電e Vries equation

In mathematics a generalized Korteweg窶電e Vries equation  is the nonlinear partial differential equation


 
  The function f is sometimes taken to be f(u) = uk+1/(k+1) + u for some positive integer k (where the extra u is a "drift term" that makes the analysis a little easier). The case f(u) = 3u2 is the original Korteweg窶電e Vries equation.
