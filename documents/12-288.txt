   Generalized Korteweg–de Vries equation      Generalized Korteweg–de Vries equation   In mathematics a generalized Korteweg–de Vries equation is the nonlinear partial differential equation         ∂  t   u   +    ∂  x  3   u   +     ∂  x   f    (  u  )     =   0.           subscript   t   u     superscript   subscript   x   3   u       subscript   x   f   u    0.    \partial_{t}u+\partial_{x}^{3}u+\partial_{x}f(u)=0.\,   The function f is sometimes taken to be f ( u ) = u k +1 /( k +1) + u for some positive integer k (where the extra u is a "drift term" that makes the analysis a little easier). The case f ( u ) = 3 u 2 is the original Korteweg–de Vries equation .  References     External links     "  Category:Partial differential equations
