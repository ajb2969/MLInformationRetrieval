   Malyl-CoA lyase      Malyl-CoA lyase   In enzymology , a malyl-CoA lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3S)-3-carboxy-3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl-CoA + glyoxylate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3S)-3-carboxy-3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA , and two products , acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3S)-3-carboxy-3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA glyoxylate-lyase (acetyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include malyl-coenzyme A lyase , and (3S)-3-carboxy-3-hydroxypropanoyl-CoA glyoxylate-lyase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
