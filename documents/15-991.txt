Peptide-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase

Peptide-methionine (S)-S-oxide reductase (, MsrA, methionine sulphoxide reductase A, methionine S-oxide reductase (S-form oxidizing), methionine sulfoxide reductase A, peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase) is an enzyme with system name peptide-L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase (L-methionine (S)-S-oxide-forming).12345678910 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) peptide-L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H2O 
 
 
 
  peptide-L-methionine (S)-S-oxide + thioredoxin

(2) L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-methionine (S)-S-oxide + thioredoxin
 

The reaction occurs in the reverse direction.
