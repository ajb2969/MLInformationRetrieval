   Harish-Chandra module      Harish-Chandra module   In mathematics , specifically in the representation theory of Lie groups , a Harish-Chandra module , named after the Indian mathematician and physicist Harish-Chandra , is a representation of a real Lie group , associated to a general representation, with regularity and finiteness conditions. When the associated representation is a    (  𝔤  ,  K  )     𝔤  K    (\mathfrak{g},K)   -module, then its Harish-Chandra module is a representation with desirable factorization properties.  Definition  Let G be a Lie group and K a compact subgroup of G . If    (  π  ,  V  )     π  V    (\pi,V)   is a representation of G , then the Harish-Chandra module of   π   π   \pi   is the subspace X of V consisting of the K-finite smooth vectors in V . This means that X includes exactly those vectors v such that the map     φ  v   :   G  ⟶  V      normal-:   subscript  φ  v    normal-⟶  G  V     \varphi_{v}:G\longrightarrow V   via        φ  v    (  g  )    =   π   (  g  )   v          subscript  φ  v   g     π  g  v     \varphi_{v}(g)=\pi(g)v     is smooth, and the subspace      span   {   π   (  k  )   v   :   k  ∈  K   }       span   conditional-set    π  k  v     k  K      \text{span}\{\pi(k)v:k\in K\}     is finite-dimensional.  Notes  In 1973, Lepowsky showed that any irreducible    (  𝔤  ,  K  )     𝔤  K    (\mathfrak{g},K)   -module X is isomorphic to the Harish-Chandra module of an irreducible representation of G on a Hilbert space . Such representations are admissible , meaning that they decompose in a manner analogous to the prime factorization of integers. (Of course, the decomposition may have infinitely many distinct factors!) Further, a result of Harish-Chandra indicates that if G is a reductive Lie group with maximal compact subgroup K , and X is an irreducible    (  𝔤  ,  K  )     𝔤  K    (\mathfrak{g},K)   -module with a positive definite Hermitian form satisfying       ⟨   k  ⋅  v   ,  w  ⟩   =   ⟨  v  ,    k   -  1    ⋅  w   ⟩         normal-⋅  k  v   w    v   normal-⋅   superscript  k    1    w      \langle k\cdot v,w\rangle=\langle v,k^{-1}\cdot w\rangle   and       ⟨   Y  ⋅  v   ,  w  ⟩   =   -   ⟨  v  ,   Y  ⋅  w   ⟩          normal-⋅  Y  v   w      v   normal-⋅  Y  w       \langle Y\cdot v,w\rangle=-\langle v,Y\cdot w\rangle   for all    Y  ∈  𝔤      Y  𝔤    Y\in\mathfrak{g}   and    k  ∈  K      k  K    k\in K   , then X is the Harish-Chandra module of a unique irreducible unitary representation of G .
