   Complex lamellar vector field      Complex lamellar vector field   In vector calculus , a complex lamellar vector field is a vector field in three dimensions which is orthogonal to its own curl . That is,       𝐅  ⋅   (   ∇  ×  𝐅   )    =  0.       normal-⋅  𝐅    normal-∇  𝐅    0.    \mathbf{F}\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{F})=0.     Complex lamellar vector fields are precisely those that are normal to a family of surfaces. A special case are irrotational vector fields , satisfying       ∇  ×  𝐅   =  0.        normal-∇  𝐅   0.    \nabla\times\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{0}.     An irrotational vector field is locally the gradient of a function, and is therefore orthogonal to the family of level surfaces (the equipotential surfaces ). Accordingly, the term lamellar vector field is sometimes used as a synonym for an irrotational vector field. 1 The adjective "lamellar" derives from the noun "lamella", which means a thin layer. The lamellae to which "lamellar flow" refers are the surfaces of constant potential, or in the complex case, the surfaces orthogonal to the vector field.
