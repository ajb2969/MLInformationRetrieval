   Character group      Character group   In mathematics , a character group is the group of representations of a group by complex -valued functions . These functions can be thought of as one-dimensional matrix representations and so are special cases of the group characters that arise in the related context of character theory . Whenever a group is represented by matrices , the function defined by the trace of the matrices is called a character; however, these traces do not in general form a group. Some important properties of these one-dimensional characters apply to characters in general:   Characters are invariant on conjugacy classes.  The characters of irreducible representations are orthogonal.   The primary importance of the character group for finite abelian groups is in number theory , where it is used to construct Dirichlet characters . The character group of the cyclic group also appears in the theory of the discrete Fourier transform . For locally compact abelian groups, the character group (with an assumption of continuity) is central to Fourier analysis .  Preliminaries  Let G be an abelian group. A function    f  :   G  →   ℂ  \   {  0  }        normal-:  f   normal-→  G   normal-\  ℂ   0       f:G\rightarrow\mathbb{C}\backslash\{0\}   mapping the group to the non-zero complex numbers is called a character of G if it is a group homomorphism —that is, if      ∀   g  1    ,   g  2    ∈    G   f   (    g  1    g  2    )    =   f   (   g  1   )   f   (   g  2   )            for-all   subscript  g  1     subscript  g  2      G  f     subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2            f   subscript  g  1   f   subscript  g  2       \forall g_{1},g_{2}\in G\;\;f(g_{1}g_{2})=f(g_{1})f(g_{2})   .  If f is a character of a finite group G , then each function value f(g) is a root of unity (since     ∀  g   ∈    G    ∃  k    ∈  ℕ         for-all  g     G    k         ℕ     \forall g\in G\;\;\exists k\in\mathbb{N}   such that     g  k   =  e       superscript  g  k   e    g^{k}=e   ,     f    (  g  )   k    =   f   (   g  k   )    =   f   (  e  )    =  1          f   superscript  g  k      f   superscript  g  k           f  e        1     f(g)^{k}=f(g^{k})=f(e)=1   ).  Each character f is a constant on conjugacy classes of G , that is, f ( h  g  h −1 ) = f ( g ). For this reason, the character is sometimes called the class function .  A finite abelian group of order n has exactly n distinct characters. These are denoted by f 1 , ..., f n . The function f 1 is the trivial representation; that is,     ∀  g   ∈    G    f  1    (  g  )    =  1         for-all  g     G   subscript  f  1   g        1     \forall g\in G\;\;f_{1}(g)=1   . It is called the principal character of G ; the others are called the non-principal characters . The non-principal characters have the property that      f  i    (  g  )    ≠  1         subscript  f  i   g   1    f_{i}(g)\neq 1   for some    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   .  Definition  If G is an abelian group of order n , then the set of characters f k forms an abelian group under multiplication      (    f  j    f  k    )    (  g  )    =    f  j    (  g  )    f  k    (  g  )             subscript  f  j    subscript  f  k    g      subscript  f  j   g   subscript  f  k   g     (f_{j}f_{k})(g)=f_{j}(g)f_{k}(g)   for each element    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   . This group is the character group of G and is sometimes denoted as    G  ^     normal-^  G    \hat{G}   . It is of order n . The identity element of    G  ^     normal-^  G    \hat{G}   is the principal character f 1 . The inverse of f k is the reciprocal 1/ f k . Note that since     ∀  g   ∈    G    |    f  k    (  g  )    |    =  1         for-all  g     G       subscript  f  k   g          1     \forall g\in G\;\;|f_{k}(g)|=1   , the inverse is equal to the complex conjugate.  Orthogonality of characters  Consider the    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrix A = A ( G ) whose matrix elements are     A   j  k    =    f  j    (   g  k   )         subscript  A    j  k       subscript  f  j    subscript  g  k      A_{jk}=f_{j}(g_{k})   where    g  k     subscript  g  k    g_{k}   is the k th element of G .  The sum of the entries in the j th row of A is given by        ∑   k  =  1   n    A   j  k     =    ∑   k  =  1   n     f  j    (   g  k   )     =  0          superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  A    j  k       superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  f  j    subscript  g  k          0     \sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{jk}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}f_{j}(g_{k})=0   if    j  ≠  1      j  1    j\neq 1   , and        ∑   k  =  1   n    A   1  k     =  n        superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  A    1  k     n    \sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{1k}=n   .  The sum of the entries in the k th column of A is given by        ∑   j  =  1   n    A   j  k     =    ∑   j  =  1   n     f  j    (   g  k   )     =  0          superscript   subscript     j  1    n    subscript  A    j  k       superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  f  j    subscript  g  k          0     \sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{jk}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{j}(g_{k})=0   if    k  ≠  1      k  1    k\neq 1   , and        ∑   j  =  1   n    A   j  1     =    ∑   j  =  1   n     f  j    (  e  )     =  n          superscript   subscript     j  1    n    subscript  A    j  1       superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  f  j   e         n     \sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{j1}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{j}(e)=n   .  Let    A  ∗     superscript  A  normal-∗    A^{\ast}   denote the conjugate transpose of A . Then       A   A  ∗    =    A  ∗   A   =   n  I           A   superscript  A  normal-∗       superscript  A  normal-∗   A          n  I      AA^{\ast}=A^{\ast}A=nI   . This implies the desired orthogonality relationship for the characters: i.e.,        ∑   k  =  1   n     f  k    *    (   g  i   )    f  k    (   g  j   )     =   n   δ   i  j           superscript   subscript     k  1    n      superscript   subscript  f  k      subscript  g  i    subscript  f  k    subscript  g  j       n   subscript  δ    i  j       \sum_{k=1}^{n}{f_{k}}^{*}(g_{i})f_{k}(g_{j})=n\delta_{ij}   , where    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   is the Kronecker delta and     f  k  *    (   g  i   )        subscript   superscript  f    k    subscript  g  i     f^{*}_{k}(g_{i})   is the complex conjugate of     f  k    (   g  i   )        subscript  f  k    subscript  g  i     f_{k}(g_{i})   .
