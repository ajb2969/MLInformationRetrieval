Regular polygons may be convex or star . In the limit , a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides becomes a circle , if the perimeter is fixed, or a regular apeirogon , if the edge length is fixed.  General properties   These properties apply to all regular polygons, whether convex or star .  A regular n -sided polygon has rotational symmetry of order n .  All vertices of a regular polygon lie on a common circle (the circumscribed circle ), i.e., they are concyclic points . That is, a regular polygon is a cyclic polygon .  Together with the property of equal-length sides, this implies that every regular polygon also has an inscribed circle or incircle that is tangent to every side at the midpoint. Thus a regular polygon is a tangential polygon .  A regular n -sided polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if the odd  prime factors of n are distinct Fermat primes . See constructible polygon .  Symmetry  The symmetry group of an n -sided regular polygon is dihedral group  D n (of order 2 n ): D 2 , D 3 , D 4 , ... It consists of the rotations in C n , together with reflection symmetry in n axes that pass through the center. If n is even then half of these axes pass through two opposite vertices, and the other half through the midpoint of opposite sides. If n is odd then all axes pass through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.  Regular convex polygons  All regular simple polygons (a simple polygon is one that does not intersect itself anywhere) are convex. Those having the same number of sides are also similar .  An n -sided convex regular polygon is denoted by its Schläfli symbol { n }. For n \left(1-\frac{2}{n}\right)\times 180 (or equally of     (   n  -  2   )   ×   180  n         n  2     180  n     (n-2)\times\frac{180}{n}   ) degrees,   or      (   n  -  2   )   π   n          n  2   π   n    \frac{(n-2)\pi}{n}   radians,  or     (   n  -  2   )    2  n         n  2     2  n     \frac{(n-2)}{2n}   full turns ,   and each exterior angle (i.e. supplementary to the interior angle) has a measure of    360  n      360  n    \tfrac{360}{n}   degrees, with the sum of the exterior angles equal to 360 degrees or 2π radians or one full turn.  Diagonals  For n > 2 the number of diagonals is     n   (   n  -  3   )    2        n    n  3    2    \tfrac{n(n-3)}{2}   , i.e., 0, 2, 5, 9, ... for a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, .... The diagonals divide the polygon into 1, 4, 11, 24, ... pieces.  For a regular n -gon inscribed in a unit-radius circle, the product of the distances from a given vertex to all other vertices (including adjacent vertices and vertices connected by a diagonal) equals n .  Interior points  For a regular n -gon, the sum of the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the n sides is n times the apothem 1 (the apothem being the distance from the center to any side). This is a generalization of Viviani's theorem for the n =3 case. 2 3  Circumradius  The circumradius  R from the center of a regular polygon to one of the vertices is related to the side length s or to the apothem  a by      R  =   s   2   sin   π  n      =   a   cos   π  n           R    s    2      π  n             a      π  n        R=\frac{s}{2\sin{\frac{\pi}{n}}}=\frac{a}{\cos{\frac{\pi}{n}}}     For constructible polygons , algebraic expressions for these relationships exist; see Bicentric polygon#Regular polygons .  The sum of the perpendiculars from a regular n -gon's vertices to any line tangent to the circumcircle equals n times the circumradius. 4  The sum of the squared distances from the vertices of a regular n -gon to any point on its circumcircle equals 2 nR 2 where R is the circumradius. 5  The sum of the squared distances from the midpoints of the sides of a regular n -gon to any point on the circumcircle is 2 nR 2 — ( ns 2 )/4, where s is the side length and R is the circumradius. 6  Area  The area A of a convex regular n -sided polygon having side  s , circumradius  R , apothem  a , and perimeter  p is given by 7 8      A  =     1  2    n  s  a   =     1  2    p  a   =     1  4    n   s  2    cot    π  n      =   n   a  2    tan    π  n      =     1  2    n   R  2    sin     2  π   n            A      1  2   n  s  a            1  2   p  a            1  4   n   superscript  s  2       π  n            n   superscript  a  2       π  n              1  2   n   superscript  R  2         2  π   n        A=\tfrac{1}{2}nsa=\tfrac{1}{2}pa=\tfrac{1}{4}ns^{2}\cot{\tfrac{\pi}{n}}=na^{2}%

The zig-zagging side edges of a n - antiprism represent a regular skew 2 n -gon, as shown in this 17-gonal antiprism.     A regular skew polygon in 3-space can be seen as nonplanar paths zig-zagging between two parallel planes, defined as the side-edges of a uniform antiprism . All edges and internal angles are equal.      The Platonic solids (the tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , dodecahedron , and icosahedron ) have Petrie polygons, seen in red here, with sides 4, 6, 6, 10, and 10 respectively.     More generally regular skew polygons can be defined in n -space. Examples include the Petrie polygons , polygonal paths of edges that divide a regular polytope into two halves, and seen as a regular polygon in orthogonal projection.  In the infinite limit regular skew polygons become skew apeirogons . {{-}}  Regular star polygons      Regular star polygons     2 {5/2}     |- ! Schläfli symbol |{p/q} |- !

The most common example is the pentagram , which has the same vertices as a pentagon , but connects alternating vertices.  For an n -sided star polygon, the Schläfli symbol is modified to indicate the density or "starriness" m of the polygon, as { n / m }. If m is 2, for example, then every second point is joined. If m is 3, then every third point is joined. The boundary of the polygon winds around the center m times.  The (non-degenerate) regular stars of up to 12 sides are:   Pentagram – {5/2}  Heptagram – {7/2} and {7/3}  Octagram – {8/3}  Enneagram – {9/2} and {9/4}  Decagram – {10/3}  Hendecagram – {11/2}, {11/3}, {11/4} and {11/5}  Dodecagram – {12/5}   m and n must be coprime , or the figure will degenerate.  The degenerate regular stars of up to 12 sides are:   Square - {4/2}  Hexagons – {6/2}, {6/3}  Octagons – {8/2}, {8/4}  Enneagon – {9/3}  Decagons – {10/2}, {10/4} and {10/5}  Dodecagons – {12/2}, {12/3}, {12/4} and {12/6}       Two interpretations of {6/2}   Grünbaum {6/2} or 2{3} 11   Coxeter  2 {3} or {6}[2{3}]{6}    (Figure)  Doubly wound hexagon.png   (Figure)  Regular star figure 2(3,1).svg      Doubly-wound hexagon   Hexagram as a compound of two triangles     Depending on the precise derivation of the Schläfli symbol, opinions differ as to the nature of the degenerate figure. For example {6/2} may be treated in either of two ways:   For much of the 20th century (see for example ), we have commonly taken the /2 to indicate joining each vertex of a convex {6} to its near neighbors two steps away, to obtain the regular compound of two triangles, or hexagram .    Coxeter clarifies this regular compound with a notation {kp}[k{p}]{kp} for the compound {p/k}, so the hexagram is represented as {6}[2{3}]{6}. 12 More compactly Coxeter also writes 2 {n/2}, like 2 {3} for a hexagram as compound as alternations of regular even-sided polygons, with italics on the leading factor to differentiate it from the coinciding interpretation. 13     Many modern geometers, such as Grünbaum (2003), 14 regard this as incorrect. They take the /2 to indicate moving two places around the {6} at each step, obtaining a "double-wound" triangle that has two vertices superimposed at each corner point and two edges along each line segment. Not only does this fit in better with modern theories of abstract polytopes , but it also more closely copies the way in which Poinsot (1809) created his star polygons – by taking a single length of wire and bending it at successive points through the same angle until the figure closed.   Duality of regular polygons  All regular polygons are self-dual to congruency, and for odd n they are self-dual to identity.  In addition, the regular star figures (compounds), being composed of regular polygons, are also self-dual.  Regular polygons as faces of polyhedra  A uniform polyhedron has regular polygons as faces, such that for every two vertices there is an isometry mapping one into the other (just as there is for a regular polygon).  A quasiregular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron which has just two kinds of face alternating around each vertex.  A regular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron which has just one kind of face.  The remaining (non-uniform) convex polyhedra with regular faces are known as the Johnson solids .  A polyhedron having regular triangles as faces is called a deltahedron .
