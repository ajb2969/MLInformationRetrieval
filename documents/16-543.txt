   Smith space      Smith space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , Smith space is a complete  compactly generated  locally convex space    X   X   X   having a compact set   K   K   K   which absorbs every other compact set    T  ⊆  X      T  X    T\subseteq X   (i.e.    T  ⊆   λ  ⋅  K       T   normal-⋅  λ  K     T\subseteq\lambda\cdot K   for some    λ  >  0      λ  0    \lambda>0   ).  Smith spaces are named after M. F. Smith, 1 who introduced them as duals to Banach spaces in some versions of duality theory for topological vector spaces . All Smith spaces are stereotype and are in the stereotype duality relations with Banach spaces : 2 3  :* for any Banach space   X   X   X   its stereotype dual space 4     X  ⋆     superscript  X  normal-⋆    X^{\star}   is a Smith space,  :* and vice versa, for any Smith space   X   X   X   its stereotype dual space    X  ⋆     superscript  X  normal-⋆    X^{\star}   is a Banach space.
