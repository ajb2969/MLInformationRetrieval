Smith space

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, Smith space is a complete compactly generated locally convex space

 
  having a compact set 
 
 
 
  which absorbs every other compact set 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 ).
Smith spaces are named after M. F. Smith,1 who introduced them as duals to Banach spaces in some versions of duality theory for topological vector spaces. All Smith spaces are stereotype and are in the stereotype duality relations with Banach spaces:23
:* for any Banach space 
 
 
 
  its stereotype dual space4

 
  is a Smith space,
:* and vice versa, for any Smith space 
 
 
 
  its stereotype dual space 
 
 
 
  is a Banach space.

The stereotype dual space to a locally convex space

  of all linear continuous functionals
