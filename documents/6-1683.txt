K-homology

In mathematics, K-homology is a homology theory on the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. It classifies the elliptic pseudo-differential operators acting on the vector bundles over a space. In terms of 

 
 -algebras, it classifies the Fredholm modules over an algebra.
An operator homotopy between two Fredholm modules 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a norm continuous path of Fredholm modules, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  Two Fredholm modules are then equivalent if they are related by unitary transformations or operator homotopies. The 
 
 
group is the abelian group of equivalence classes of even Fredholm modules over A. The 
 
 
 
  group is the abelian group of equivalence classes of odd Fredholm modules over A. Addition is given by direct summation of Fredholm modules, and the inverse of 
 
 
 
  is
