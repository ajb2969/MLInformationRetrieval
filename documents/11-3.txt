   Phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase      Phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase   In enzymology , a phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-[(R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl]-L-cysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pantotheine 4'-phosphate + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , [[N-[(R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl]-L-cysteine]], and two products , pantotheine 4'-phosphate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , to be specific the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-[(R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl]-L-cysteine carboxy-lyase (pantotheine-4'-phosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include 4-phosphopantotheoylcysteine decarboxylase , 4-phosphopantothenoyl-L-cysteine decarboxylase , PPC-decarboxylase , and N-[(R)-4'-phosphopantothenoyl]-L-cysteine carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis from pantothenic acid .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
