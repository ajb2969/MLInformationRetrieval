   Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average      Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average   In statistics , autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average models are time series models that generalize ARIMA ( autoregressive integrated moving average ) models by allowing non-integer values of the differencing parameter . These models are useful in modeling time series with long memory —that is, in which deviations from the long-run mean decay more slowly than an exponential decay. The acronyms "ARFIMA" or "FARIMA" are often used, although it is also conventional to simply extend the "ARIMA( p , d , q )" notation for models, by simply allowing the order of differencing, d , to take fractional values.  Basics  In an ARIMA model, the integrated part of the model includes the differencing operator (1 − B ) (where B is the backshift operator ) raised to an integer power. For example         (   1  -  B   )   2   =    1  -   2  B    +    B  2      ,       superscript    1  B   2       1    2  B     superscript  B  2      (1-B)^{2}=1-2B+B^{2}\,,   where         B  2    X  t    =    X   t  -  2      ,         superscript  B  2    subscript  X  t     subscript  X    t  2      B^{2}X_{t}=X_{t-2}\,,   so that          (   1  -  B   )   2    X  t    =     X  t   -   2   X   t  -  1      +   X   t  -  2      .         superscript    1  B   2    subscript  X  t         subscript  X  t     2   subscript  X    t  1       subscript  X    t  2       (1-B)^{2}X_{t}=X_{t}-2X_{t-1}+X_{t-2}.     In a fractional model, the power is allowed to be fractional, with the meaning of the term identified using the following formal binomial series expansion       (   1  -  B   )   d     superscript    1  B   d    \displaystyle(1-B)^{d}     ARFIMA(0, d ,0)  The simplest autoregressive fractionally integrated model, ARFIMA(0, d ,0), is, in standard notation,          (   1  -  B   )   d    X  t    =   ε  t    ,         superscript    1  B   d    subscript  X  t     subscript  ε  t     (1-B)^{d}X_{t}=\varepsilon_{t},   where this has the interpretation           X  t   -   d   X   t  -  1      +     d   (   d  -  1   )     2  !     X   t  -  2      -  ⋯   =   ε  t    .             subscript  X  t     d   subscript  X    t  1            d    d  1      2     subscript  X    t  2      normal-⋯    subscript  ε  t     X_{t}-dX_{t-1}+\frac{d(d-1)}{2!}X_{t-2}-\cdots=\varepsilon_{t}.     ARFIMA(0, d ,0) is similar to fractional Gaussian noise (fGn): with d = H −½, their covariances have the same power-law decay. The advantage of fGn over ARFIMA(0, d ,0) is that many asymptotic relations hold for finite samples. 1 The advantage of ARFIMA(0, d ,0) over fGn is that it has an especially simple spectral density —   f (λ) = (1/2π) (2sin(λ/2)) −2 d    —and it is a particular case of ARFIMA( p , d , q ), which is a versatile family of models. 2  General form: ARFIMA( p , d , q )  An ARFIMA model shares the same form of representation as the ARIMA ( p , d , q ) process, specifically:         (   1  -    ∑   i  =  1   p     ϕ  i    B  i      )     (   1  -  B   )   d    X  t    =    (   1  +    ∑   i  =  1   q     θ  i    B  i      )     ε  t      .          1    superscript   subscript     i  1    p      subscript  ϕ  i    superscript  B  i       superscript    1  B   d    subscript  X  t        1    superscript   subscript     i  1    q      subscript  θ  i    superscript  B  i       subscript  ε  t      \left(1-\sum_{i=1}^{p}\phi_{i}B^{i}\right)\left(1-B\right)^{d}X_{t}=\left(1+%
 \sum_{i=1}^{q}\theta_{i}B^{i}\right)\varepsilon_{t}\,.     In contrast to the ordinary ARIMA process, the "difference parameter", d , is allowed to take non-integer values.
