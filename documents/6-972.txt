   Montonen–Olive duality      Montonen–Olive duality   In theoretical physics , Montonen–Olive duality is the oldest known example of S-duality or a strong-weak duality . It generalizes the electro-magnetic symmetry of Maxwell's equations . It is named after Finnish  Claus Montonen and British  David Olive .  Overview  In a four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with N =4 supersymmetry , which is the case where the Montonen–Olive duality applies, one obtains a physically equivalent theory if one replaces the gauge coupling constant  g by 1/ g . This also involves an interchange of the electrically charged particles and magnetic monopoles . See also Seiberg duality .  In fact, there exists a larger SL(2, Z ) symmetry where both g as well as theta-angle are transformed non-trivially.  Mathematical formalism  The gauge coupling and theta-angle can be combined together to form one complex coupling       τ  =    θ   2  π    +    4  π  i    g  2      .      τ      θ    2  π        4  π  i    superscript  g  2       \tau=\frac{\theta}{2\pi}+\frac{4\pi i}{g^{2}}.   Since the theta-angle is periodic, there is a symmetry      τ  ↦   τ  +  1.      maps-to  τ    τ  1.     \tau\mapsto\tau+1.   The quantum mechanical theory with gauge group G (but not the classical theory, except in the case when the G is abelian ) is also invariant under the symmetry      τ  ↦    -  1     n  G   τ       maps-to  τ      1      subscript  n  G   τ      \tau\mapsto\frac{-1}{n_{G}\tau}   while the gauge group G is simultaneously replaced by its Langlands dual group  L G and    n  G     subscript  n  G    n_{G}   is an integer depending on the choice of gauge group. In the case the theta-angle is 0, this reduces to the simple form of Montonen–Olive duality stated above.
