   Weierstrass–Erdmann condition      Weierstrass–Erdmann condition   The Weierstrass–Erdmann condition is a technical tool from the calculus of variations . This condition gives the sufficient conditions for an extremal to have a corner.  Conditions  The condition says that, along a piecewise smooth extremal x ( t ) (i.e. an extremal which is smooth except at a finite number of corners) for an integral     J  =   ∫   f   (  t  ,  x  ,  y  )   d  t        J      f   t  x  y   d  t      J=\int f(t,x,y)\,dt   , the partial derivative      ∂  f   /   ∂  x         f     x     \partial f/\partial x   must be continuous at a corner T . That is, if one takes the limit of partials on both sides of the corner as one approaches the corner T , the result must be the same answer.  Applications  The condition allows one to prove that a corner exists along a given extremal. As a result, there are many applications to differential geometry . In calculations of the Weierstrass E-Function , it is often helpful to find where corners exist along the curves. Similarly, the condition allows for one to find a minimizing curve for a given integral.  "  Category:Calculus of variations
