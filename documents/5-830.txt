   Null graph      Null graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the term "null graph" may refer either to the order - zero  graph , or alternatively, to any edgeless graph (the latter is sometimes called an "empty graph").  Order-zero graph  The order-zero graph ,    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   , is the unique graph having no vertices (hence its order is zero). It follows that    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   also has no edges . Some authors exclude    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   from consideration as a graph (either by definition, or more simply as a matter of convenience). Whether including    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   as a valid graph is useful depends on context. On the positive side,    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   follows naturally from the usual set-theoretic definitions of a graph (it is the ordered pair ( V , E ) for which the vertex and edge sets, V and E , are both empty ), in proofs it serves as a natural base case for mathematical induction , and similarly, in recursively defined  data structures     K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   is useful for defining the base case for recursion (by treating the null tree as the child of missing edges in any non-null binary tree , every non-null binary tree has exactly two children). On the negative side, including    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   as a graph requires that many well-defined formulas for graph properties include exceptions for it (for example, either "counting all strongly connected components of a graph" becomes "counting all non-null strongly connected components of a graph", or the definition of connected graphs has to be modified not to include K 0 ). To avoid the need for such exceptions, it is often assumed in literature that the term graph implies "graph with at least one vertex" unless context suggests otherwise. 1 2  In category theory , the order-zero graph is, according to some definitions of "category of graphs," the initial object in the category.      K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   does fulfill ( vacuously ) most of the same basic graph properties as does    K  1     subscript  K  1    K_{1}   (the graph with one vertex and no edges). As some examples,    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   is of size zero, it is equal to its complement graph      K  0   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  K  0     \overline{K_{0}}   , a forest , and a planar graph . It may be considered undirected , directed , or even both; when considered as directed, it is a directed acyclic graph . And it is both a complete graph and an edgeless graph. However, definitions for each of these graph properties will vary depending on whether context allows for    K  0     subscript  K  0    K_{0}   .  Edgeless graph  For each natural number  n , the edgeless graph (or empty graph)     K  ¯   n     subscript   normal-¯  K   n    \overline{K}_{n}   of order n is the graph with n vertices and zero edges. An edgeless graph is occasionally referred to as a null graph in contexts where the order-zero graph is not permitted. 3 4  The notation     K  ¯   n     subscript   normal-¯  K   n    \overline{K}_{n}   arises from the fact that the n -vertex edgeless graph is the complement of the complete graph     K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   .
