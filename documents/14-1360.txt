Erdelyi–Kober operator

In mathematics, an Erdélyi–Kober operator is a fractional integration operation introduced by  and .
The Erdélyi–Kober fractional integral is given by
$$\frac{x^{-\nu-\alpha+1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^x (t-x)^{\alpha-1}t^{-\alpha-\nu}f(t) dt$$
which generalizes the Riemann fractional integral and the Weyl integral.
