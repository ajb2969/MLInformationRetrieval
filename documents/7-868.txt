Schur-convex function

In mathematics, a Schur-convex function, also known as S-convex, isotonic function and order-preserving function is a function

 
  that for all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is majorized by 
 
 
 
 
 , one has that 
 
 
 
 . Named after Issai Schur, Schur-convex functions are used in the study of majorization. Every function that is convex and symmetric is also Schur-convex. The opposite implication is not true, but all Schur-convex functions are symmetric (under permutations of the arguments).1
Schur-concave function
A function f is 'Schur-concave' if its negative, -f, is Schur-convex.
Schur-Ostrowski criterion
If f is symmetric and all first partial derivatives exist, then f is Schur-convex if and only if


 
  for all 
 
 

holds for all 1≤i≠j≤d.2
Examples



 
  is Schur-concave while 
 
 
 
 
  is Schur-convex. This can be seen directly from the definition.


The Shannon entropy function 
 
 
 
  is Schur-concave.


The Rényi entropy function is also Schur-concave.




 
  is Schur-convex.


The function 
 
 
 
  is Schur-concave, when we assume all 
 
 
 
 . In the same way, all the Elementary symmetric functions are Schur-concave, when 
 
 
 
 
 .


A natural interpretation of majorization is that if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is more spread out than 
 
 
 
 . So it is natural to ask if statistical measures of variability are Schur-convex. The variance and standard deviation are Schur-convex functions, while the Median absolute deviation is not.


If 
 
 
 
  is a convex function defined on a real interval, then 
 
 
 
 
  is Schur-convex.


A probability example: If 
 
 
 
  are exchangeable random variables, then the function 
 
 
 
  is Schur-convex as a function of 
 
 
 
 , assuming that the expectations exist.


The Gini coefficient is strictly Schur concave.
