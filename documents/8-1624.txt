Pythagorean quadruple

A Pythagorean quadruple is a tuple of integers a, b, c and d, such that d > 0 and 
 
 
 
 , and is often denoted 
 
 
 
 . Geometrically, a Pythagorean quadruple 
 
 
 
  defines a cuboid with integer side lengths |a|, |b|, and |c|, whose space diagonal has integer length d. Pythagorean quadruples are thus also called Pythagorean Boxes.1
Parametrization of primitive quadruples
The set of all primitive Pythagorean quadruples, i.e., those for which gcd(a,b,c) = 1 where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor, and for which without loss of generality a is odd, is parametrized by,234












where m, n, p, q are non-negative integers and gcd(m, n, p, q) = 1 and m + n + p + q ≡ 1 (mod 2). Thus, all primitive Pythagorean quadruples are characterized by the Lebesgue Identity



Alternate parametrization
All Pythagorean quadruples (including non-primitives, and with repetition, though a, b and c do not appear in all possible orders) can be generated from two positive integers a and b as follows:
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have different parity, let p be any factor of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
 .
A similar method exists5 for generating all Pythagorean quadruples for which 
 
 
 
  are both even. Let l = a / 2 and m = b / 2 and let n be a factor of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  This method generates all Pythagorean quadruples exactly once each when l and m run through all pairs of natural numbers and n runs through all permissible values for each pair.
No such method exists if both a and b are odd, in which case no solutions exist as can be seen by the parametrization in the previous section.
Properties
The largest number that always divides the product abcd is 12.6 The quadruple with the minimal product is (1, 2, 2, 3).
Relationship with quaternions and rational orthogonal matrices
A primitive Pythagorean quadruple 
 
 
parametrized by 
 
 
 
  corresponds to the first column of the matrix representation

 
  of conjugation

 
  by the Hurwitz quaternion

restricted to the subspace of 

 spanned by 
 
 
 
 , which is given by



where the columns are pairwise orthogonal and each has norm d. Furthermore, we have 
 
 


, and, in fact, all 3 × 3 orthogonal matrices with rational coefficients arise in this manner.7
