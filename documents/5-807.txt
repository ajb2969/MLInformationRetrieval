   Trend stationary      Trend stationary   In the statistical analysis of time series , a stochastic process is trend stationary if an underlying trend (function solely of time) can be removed , leaving a stationary process . 1  Formal definition  A process { Y } is said to be trend stationary if 2  $$Y_t = f(t) + e_t,$$  where t is time, f is any function mapping from the reals to the reals, and { e } is a stationary process. The value $f(t)$ is said to be the trend value of the process at time t .  Simplest example: stationarity around a linear trend  Suppose the variable Y evolves according to  $$Y_t = a \cdot t + b + e_t$$  where t is time and e t is the error term, which is hypothesized to be white noise or more generally to have been generated by any stationary process. Then one can use 3 4 5 linear regression to obtain an estimate $\hat{a}$ of the true underlying trend slope $a$ and an estimate $\hat{b}$ of the underlying intercept term b ; if the estimate $\hat{a}$ is significantly different from zero, this is sufficient to show with high confidence that the variable Y is non-stationary. The residuals from this regression are given by  $$\hat{e}_t = Y - \hat{a} \cdot t - \hat{b}.$$  If these estimated residuals can be statistically shown to be stationary (more precisely, if one can reject the hypothesis that the true underlying errors are non-stationary), then the residuals are referred to as the detrended data, 6 and the original series { Y t } is said to be trend stationary even though it is not stationary.  Stationarity around other types of trend  Exponential growth trend  Many economic time series are characterized by exponential growth . For example, suppose that one hypothesizes that gross domestic product is characterized by stationary deviations from a trend involving a constant growth rate. Then it could be modeled as  $$\text{GDP}_t = Be^{at}U_t$$  with U t being hypothesized to be a stationary error process. To estimate the parameters $a$ and B , one first takes 7 the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of this equation:  $$\ln (\text{GDP}_t) =  \ln B + at + \ln (U_t).$$  This log-linear equation is in the same form as the previous linear trend equation and can be detrended in the same way, giving the estimated $(\ln U)_t$ as the detrended value of $(\ln \text{GDP})_t$ , and hence the implied $U_t$ as the detrended value of $\text{GDP}_t$ , assuming one can reject the hypothesis that $(\ln U)_t$ is non-stationary.  Quadratic trend  Trends do not have to be linear or log-linear. For example, a variable could have a quadratic trend:  $$Y_t = a \cdot t + c \cdot t^2 + b + e_t.$$  This can be regressed linearly in the coefficients using t and t 2 as regressors; again, if the residuals are shown to be stationary then they are the detrended values of $Y_t$ .  Other non-stationary processes that are not trend stationary but can be rendered stationary  Trend stationary processes are not the only kind of non-stationary process that can be transformed into a stationary one; another prominent such process exhibits one or more unit roots 8 9 10 11 but has all its other roots smaller than unity in magnitude.
