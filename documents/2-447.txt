   Characteristic function      Characteristic function   In mathematics, characteristic function can refer to any of several distinct concepts:   As a synonym for indicator function , that is the function           ùüè  A   :   X  ‚Üí   {  0  ,  1  }     ,     normal-:   subscript  1  A    normal-‚Üí  X   0  1      \mathbf{1}_{A}\colon X\to\{0,1\},       which for a given subset A of X , has value 1 at points of A and 0 at points of X ‚àí A .    In probability theory, the characteristic function of any probability distribution on the real line is given by the following formula, where X is any random variable with the distribution in question:           œÜ  X    (  t  )    =   E   (   e   i  t  X    )           subscript  œÜ  X   t    normal-E   superscript  e    i  t  X       \varphi_{X}(t)=\operatorname{E}\left(e^{itX}\right)   ,    where E means expected value. This concept extends to multivariate distributions.    The characteristic function in convex analysis:           œá  A    (  x  )    :=   {      0  ,       x  ‚àà  A   ;         +  ‚àû   ,       x  ‚àâ  A   .          assign     subscript  œá  A   x    cases  0    x  A         x  A      \chi_{A}(x):=\begin{cases}0,&x\in A;\\
 +\infty,&x\not\in A.\end{cases}         The cooperative game in game theory.  The characteristic polynomial in linear algebra.  The characteristic state function in statistical mechanics.
