Characteristic function

In mathematics, characteristic function can refer to any of several distinct concepts:

As a synonym for indicator function, that is the function








which for a given subset A of X, has value 1 at points of A and 0 at points of X − A.
 


In probability theory, the characteristic function of any probability distribution on the real line is given by the following formula, where X is any random variable with the distribution in question:





 
 ,
 


where E means expected value. This concept extends to multivariate distributions.
