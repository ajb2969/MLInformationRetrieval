   Phoenix network coordinates      Phoenix network coordinates    Phoenix is a decentralized network coordinate (NC) system based on the matrix factorization model. 1  Background   Network coordinates (NC) system 2 is an efficient mechanism for Internet distance ( round-trip latency ) prediction with scalable measurements. For a network with N hosts, by performing O(N) measurements, all N*N distances can be predicted.  Use cases: Vuze BitTorrent, application layer multicast, PeerWise overlay, multi-player online gaming.  Triangle inequality violation (TIV) is widely exist on the Internet due to the current sub-optimal Internet routing .   Model   Most of the prior NC systems use the Euclidean distance model, i.e., embeds N hosts into a d-dimensional Euclidean space  R d . Due to the wide existence of TIV on the Internet, the prediction accuracy of such systems is limited. Phoenix chooses matrix factorization (MF) model, which does not have the constraint of TIV.  The linear dependence among the rows motivates the factorization of Internet distance matrix, i.e., for a system with   N   N   N   Internet nodes, the    N  ×  N      N  N    N\times N   Internet distance matrix D can be factorized into two smaller matrices.    D  ≈   X   Y  T        D    X   superscript  Y  T      D\approx XY^{T}   where   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are    N  ×  d      N  d    N\times d   matrices (d << N). This matrix factorization is essentially a problem of linear dimensionality reduction, while Phoenix try to solve it via a distributed way.   Design choices in Phoenix   Different from the existing MF based NC systems such as IDES 3 and DMF, 4 Phoenix introduces a weight to each reference NC and trusts the NCs with higher weight values more than the others. The weight-based mechanism can substantially reduce the impact of the error propagation.  For node discovery, Phoenix uses a distributed scheme, so-called peer exchange (PEX), which is used in BitTorrent (protocol) . The usage of PEX reduces the load of the tracker, while still ensuring the prediction accuracy under node churn.  Similar to DMF, for avoiding the potential drift of the NCs, Regularization (mathematics) is introduced in NC calculation.  NCShield 5 is a decentralized, goosip-based trust and reputation system to secure Phoenix and other matrix factorization-based NC systems.
