Under the previous government's NBN Co corporate plan, it was estimated that the NBN construction would require A$27.5 billion in Government equity and raise an estimated A$13.4 billion in debt funding without government support; a total funding requirement of A$40.9 billion up to FY2021. Financial forecasts for NBN Co assuming a 7% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) expect the Government and Debt equity will be fully repaid including accrued interest by FY204023 These forecasts have now been made redundant with the change of government following the 2013 Federal Election. The new Liberal National Coalition government is undertaking a 60 day strategic review of the project, stating the intention to investigate the best infrastructure technology mix to deliver fast broadband around the country as soon as possible and at the lowest cost.
This has resulted in the implementation of both FTTN (Fibre to the node) technology in metropolitan areas, and LTE Fixed wireless technology in regional areas.
