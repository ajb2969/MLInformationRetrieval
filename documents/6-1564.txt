   Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem      Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem   In mathematics , the Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem characterizes when a finitely additive  function with non-negative (possibly infinite) values can be extended to a bona fide  measure . It is named after the Austrian  mathematician  Hans Hahn and the Russian / Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov .  Statement of the theorem  Let    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   be an algebra of subsets of a set     X  .    X   X.   Consider a function       μ  0   :    Σ  0   →   [  0  ,  ∞  ]       normal-:   subscript  μ  0    normal-→   subscript  normal-Σ  0    0       \mu_{0}\colon\Sigma_{0}\to[0,\infty]     which is finitely additive , meaning that        μ  0    (    ⋃   n  =  1   N    A  n    )    =    ∑   n  =  1   N     μ  0    (   A  n   )            subscript  μ  0     superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  A  n       superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  μ  0    subscript  A  n       \mu_{0}\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}A_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\mu_{0}(A_{n})     for any positive integer  N and     A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …  ,   A  N       subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…   subscript  A  N     A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{N}    disjoint sets in    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   .  Assume that this function satisfies the stronger sigma additivity assumption        μ  0    (    ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     μ  0    (   A  n   )            subscript  μ  0     superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n       superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  μ  0    subscript  A  n       \mu_{0}\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mu_{0}(A_{%
 n})     for any disjoint family    {   A  n   :   n  ∈  ℕ   }     conditional-set   subscript  A  n     n  ℕ     \{A_{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}   of elements of    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   such that      ∪   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    ∈   Σ  0         superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n     subscript  normal-Σ  0     \cup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in\Sigma_{0}   . (Functions    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   obeying these two properties are known as pre-measures .) Then,    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   extends to a measure defined on the sigma-algebra    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   generated by    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   ; i.e., there exists a measure      μ  :   Σ  →   [  0  ,  ∞  ]       normal-:  μ   normal-→  normal-Σ   0       \mu\colon\Sigma\to[0,\infty]     such that its restriction to    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   coincides with     μ  0   .     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}.     If    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is   σ   σ   \sigma   -finite, then the extension is unique.  Non-uniqueness of the extension  If    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is not   σ   σ   \sigma   -finite then the extension need not be unique, even if the extension itself is   σ   σ   \sigma   -finite.  Here is an example:  We call rational closed-open interval , any subset of   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   of the form    [  a  ,  b  )     a  b    [a,b)   , where     a  ,  b   ∈  ℚ       a  b   ℚ    a,b\in\mathbb{Q}   .  Let   X   X   X   be    ℚ  ∩   [  0  ,  1  )       ℚ   0  1     \mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1)   and let    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   be the algebra of all finite union of rational closed-open intervals contained in    ℚ  ∩   [  0  ,  1  )       ℚ   0  1     \mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1)   . It is easy to prove that    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   is, in fact, an algebra. It is also easy to see that every non-empty set in    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   is infinite.  Let    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   be the counting set function (   #   normal-#   \#   ) defined in    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   . It is clear that    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is finitely additive and   σ   σ   \sigma   -additive in    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   . Since every non-empty set in    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   is infinite, we have, for every non-empty set    A  ∈   Σ  0       A   subscript  normal-Σ  0     A\in\Sigma_{0}   ,      μ  0    (  A  )    =   +  ∞          subscript  μ  0   A         \mu_{0}(A)=+\infty     Now, let   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   be the   σ   σ   \sigma   -algebra generated by    Σ  0     subscript  normal-Σ  0    \Sigma_{0}   . It is easy to see that   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is the Borel   σ   σ   \sigma   -algebra of subsets of   X   X   X   , and both   #   normal-#   \#   and    2  #      2  normal-#    2\#   are measures defined on   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   and both are extensions of    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   .  Comments  This theorem is remarkable for it allows one to construct a measure by first defining it on a small algebra of sets, where its sigma additivity could be easy to verify, and then this theorem guarantees its extension to a sigma-algebra. The proof of this theorem is not trivial, since it requires extending    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   from an algebra of sets to a potentially much bigger sigma-algebra, guaranteeing that the extension is unique (if    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is   σ   σ   \sigma   -finite), and moreover that it does not fail to satisfy the sigma-additivity of the original function.
