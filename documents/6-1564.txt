Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem

In mathematics, the Hahn–Kolmogorov theorem characterizes when a finitely additive function with non-negative (possibly infinite) values can be extended to a bona fide measure. It is named after the Austrian mathematician Hans Hahn and the Russian/Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be an algebra of subsets of a set

 
  Consider a function



which is finitely additive, meaning that



for any positive integer N and 
 
 
disjoint sets in 
 
 
 
 .
Assume that this function satisfies the stronger sigma additivity assumption



for any disjoint family 
 
 
 
  of elements of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . (Functions 
 
 
 
  obeying these two properties are known as pre-measures.) Then, 
 
 
 
  extends to a measure defined on the sigma-algebra

 
  generated by 
 
 
 
 ; i.e., there exists a measure



such that its restriction to 
 
 
 
  coincides with 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -finite, then the extension is unique.
Non-uniqueness of the extension
If 
 
 
 
  is not 
 
 
 
 -finite then the extension need not be unique, even if the extension itself is 
 
 
 
 -finite.
Here is an example:
We call rational closed-open interval, any subset of 
 
 
 
  of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be the algebra of all finite union of rational closed-open intervals contained in 
 
 
 
 . It is easy to prove that 
 
 
 
  is, in fact, an algebra. It is also easy to see that every non-empty set in 
 
 
 
  is infinite.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the counting set function (
 
 
 
 ) defined in 
 
 
 
 . It is clear that 
 
 
 
  is finitely additive and 
 
 
 
 -additive in 
 
 
 
 . Since every non-empty set in 
 
 
 
  is infinite, we have, for every non-empty set 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 

Now, let 
 
 
 
  be the 
 
 
 
 -algebra generated by 
 
 
 
 . It is easy to see that 
 
 
 
  is the Borel 
 
 
 
 -algebra of subsets of 
 
 
 
 , and both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are measures defined on 
 
 
 
  and both are extensions of 
 
 
 
 .
Comments
This theorem is remarkable for it allows one to construct a measure by first defining it on a small algebra of sets, where its sigma additivity could be easy to verify, and then this theorem guarantees its extension to a sigma-algebra. The proof of this theorem is not trivial, since it requires extending 
 
 
 
  from an algebra of sets to a potentially much bigger sigma-algebra, guaranteeing that the extension is unique (if 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -finite), and moreover that it does not fail to satisfy the sigma-additivity of the original function.
