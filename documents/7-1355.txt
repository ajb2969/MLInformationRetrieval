   Total average      Total average   Total average is a baseball statistic devised by sportswriter Thomas Boswell in the 1970s. The statistic is designed to measure a hitter's overall offensive contributions.  The definition of the statistic is simple. A player gets a credit for every base he accumulates and a penalty for every out he makes. So a player gets one credit for a single, walk , stolen base or being hit by a pitch ; two for a double ; three for a triple ; and four for a home run . A player's Total Average is calculated by adding all the bases together and dividing them by the number of outs the player makes.  The formula is:       T  A   =     T  B   +   H  B  P   +   B  B   +   S  B       A  B   -  H   +   C  S   +   G  I  D  P           T  A         T  B     H  B  P     B  B     S  B          A  B   H     C  S     G  I  D  P       TA=\frac{TB+HBP+BB+SB}{AB-H+CS+GIDP}     where   TA = Total average  TB = Total bases  HBP = Hit by pitch  BB = Walks  SB = Stolen base  CS = Caught stealing  AB = At bats  H = Hits  GIDP = grounded into double play   Because Total average emphasizes walks and extra base hits - and de-emphasizes singles - it has much in common with statistics developed by Bill James and other sabermetricians . Like OPS , total average gives credit to players who draw a lot of walks and hit with a lot of power: Babe Ruth , Barry Bonds , Ted Williams and Frank Thomas for instance. James himself was critical of total average.  "  Category:Batting statistics
