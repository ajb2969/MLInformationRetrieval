   Proizvolov's identity      Proizvolov's identity   In mathematics , Proizvolov's identity is an identity concerning sums of differences of positive integers . The identity was posed by Vyacheslav Proizvolov as a problem in the 1985 All-Union Soviet Student Olympiads .  To state the identity, take the first 2 N positive integers,   1, 2, 3, ..., 2 N − 1, 2 N ,   and partition them into two subsets of N numbers each. Arrange one subset in increasing order:        A  1   <   A  2   <  ⋯  <   A  N    .         subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2        normal-⋯        subscript  A  N      A_{1}     Arrange the other subset in decreasing order:        B  1   >   B  2   >  ⋯  >   B  N    .         subscript  B  1    subscript  B  2        normal-⋯        subscript  B  N      B_{1}>B_{2}>\cdots>B_{N}.     Then the sum       |    A  1   -   B  1    |   +   |    A  2   -   B  2    |   +  ⋯  +   |    A  N   -   B  N    |            subscript  A  1    subscript  B  1          subscript  A  2    subscript  B  2     normal-⋯       subscript  A  N    subscript  B  N       |A_{1}-B_{1}|+|A_{2}-B_{2}|+\cdots+|A_{N}-B_{N}|     is always equal to N 2 .  Example  Take for example N = 3. The set of numbers is then {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Select three numbers of this set, say 2, 3 and 5. Then the sequences A and B are:   A 1 = 2, A 2 = 3, and A 3 = 5;  B 1 = 6, B 2 = 4, and B 3 = 1.   The sum is         |    A  1   -   B  1    |   +   |    A  2   -   B  2    |   +   |    A  3   -   B  3    |    =    |   2  -  6   |   +   |   3  -  4   |   +   |   5  -  1   |    =   4  +  1  +  4   =  9   ,               subscript  A  1    subscript  B  1          subscript  A  2    subscript  B  2          subscript  A  3    subscript  B  3            2  6        3  4        5  1            4  1  4        9     |A_{1}-B_{1}|+|A_{2}-B_{2}|+|A_{3}-B_{3}|=|2-6|+|3-4|+|5-1|=4+1+4=9,   which indeed equals 3 2 .
