Proizvolov's identity

In mathematics, Proizvolov's identity is an identity concerning sums of differences of positive integers. The identity was posed by Vyacheslav Proizvolov as a problem in the 1985 All-Union Soviet Student Olympiads .
To state the identity, take the first 2N positive integers,

1, 2, 3, ..., 2N âˆ’ 1, 2N,
 

and partition them into two subsets of N numbers each. Arrange one subset in increasing order:



Arrange the other subset in decreasing order:



Then the sum



is always equal to N2.
Example
Take for example N = 3. The set of numbers is then {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Select three numbers of this set, say 2, 3 and 5. Then the sequences A and B are:

A1 = 2, A2 = 3, and A3 = 5;
 
B1 = 6, B2 = 4, and B3 = 1.
 

The sum is


 
  which indeed equals 32.
