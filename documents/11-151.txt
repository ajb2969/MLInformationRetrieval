16-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone dehydratase

In enzymology, a 16alpha-hydroxyprogesterone dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

16alpha-hydroxyprogesterone 
 
 
 
  16,17-didehydroprogesterone + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 16alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and two products, 16,17-didehydroprogesterone and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 16alpha-hydroxyprogesterone hydro-lyase (16,17-didehydroprogesterone-forming). Other names in common use include hydroxyprogesterone dehydroxylase, 16alpha-hydroxyprogesterone dehydroxylase, 16alpha-dehydroxylase, and 16alpha-hydroxyprogesterone hydro-lyase.
