   Meyerhoff manifold      Meyerhoff manifold   In hyperbolic geometry , the Meyerhoff manifold is the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained by (5, 1) surgery on the figure-8  knot complement . It was introduced by  as a possible candidate for the hyperbolic 3-manifold of smallest volume, but the Weeks manifold turned out to have slightly smaller volume. It has the second smallest volume        12  ⋅    (  283  )    3  /  2      ζ  k    (  2  )     (   2  π   )    -  6     =   0.9812  …          normal-⋅  12   superscript  283    3  2      subscript  ζ  k   2   superscript    2  π     6       0.9812  normal-…     12\cdot(283)^{3/2}\zeta_{k}(2)(2\pi)^{-6}=0.9812\ldots   of orientable arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds (where ζ k is the zeta function of the quartic field of discriminant −283).  showed that it is arithmetic.
