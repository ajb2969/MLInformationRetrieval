Meyerhoff manifold

In hyperbolic geometry, the Meyerhoff manifold is the arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained by (5, 1) surgery on the figure-8 knot complement. It was introduced by  as a possible candidate for the hyperbolic 3-manifold of smallest volume, but the Weeks manifold turned out to have slightly smaller volume. It has the second smallest volume


 
  of orientable arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds (where ζk is the zeta function of the quartic field of discriminant −283).  showed that it is arithmetic.
