In probability theory, a logit-normal distribution is a probability distribution of a random variable whose logit has a normal distribution. If Y is a random variable with a normal distribution, and P is the logistic function, then X = P(Y) has a logit-normal distribution; likewise, if X is logit-normally distributed, then Y = logit(X)= log (X/(1-X)) is normally distributed. It is also known as the logistic normal distribution,1 which often refers to a multinomial logit version (e.g.2345).
A variable might be modeled as logit-normal if it is a proportion, which is bounded by zero and one, and where values of zero and one never occur.
Characterization
Probability density function
The probability density function (PDF) of a logit-normal distribution, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, is:



where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable’s logit (by definition, the variable’s logit is normally distributed).
The density obtained by changing the sign of μ is symmetrical, in that it is equal to f(1-x;-μ,σ), shifting the mode to the other side of 0.5 (the midpoint of the (0,1) interval).

Moments
The moments of the logit-normal distribution have no analytic solution. However, they can be estimated by numerical integration.
Mode
When the derivative of the density equals 0 then the location of the mode x satisfies the following equation:



Multivariate generalization
The logistic normal distribution is a generalization of the logit–normal distribution to D-dimensional probability vectors by taking a logistic transformation of a multivariate normal distribution.678
Probability density function
The probability density function is:



where 
 
 
 
  denotes a vector of the first (D-1) components of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the simplex of D-dimensional probability vectors. This follows from applying the additive logistic transformation to map a multivariate normal random variable 
 
 
 
  to the simplex:

Use in statistical analysis
The logistic normal distribution is a more flexible alternative to the Dirichlet distribution in that it can capture correlations between components of probability vectors. It also has the potential to simplify statistical analyses of compositional data by allowing one to answer questions about log-ratios of the components of the data vectors. One is often interested in ratios rather than absolute component values.
The probability simplex is a bounded space, making standard techniques that are typically applied to vectors in 
 
 
 
  less meaningful. Aitchison described the problem of spurious negative correlations when applying such methods directly to simplicial vectors.9 However, mapping compositional data in 
 
 
 
  through the inverse of the additive logistic transformation yields real-valued data in 
 
 
 
 . Standard techniques can be applied to this representation of the data. This approach justifies use of the logistic normal distribution, which can thus be regarded as the "Gaussian of the simplex".
Relationship with the Dirichlet distribution

The Dirichlet and logistic normal distributions are never exactly equal for any choice of parameters. However, Aitchison described a method for approximating a Dirichlet with a logistic normal such that their Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) is minimized:



This is minimized by:



Using moment properties of the Dirichlet distribution, the solution can be written in terms of the digamma

 
  and trigamma

 
  functions:









This approximation is particularly accurate for large 
 
 
 
 . In fact, one can show that for 
 
 
 
 , we have that
