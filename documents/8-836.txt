Log-distance path loss model

The log-distance path loss model is a radio propagation model that predicts the path loss a signal encounters inside a building or densely populated areas over distance.
Mathematical formulation
The model
Log-distance path loss model is formally expressed as:



where


 
  is the total path loss measured in Decibel (dB)


 
  is the transmitted power in dBm, where


 
  is the transmitted power in watt.


 
  is the received power in dBm, where


 
  is the received power in watt.


 
  is the path loss at the reference distance d0. Unit: Decibel (dB)


 
  is the length of the path.


 
  is the reference distance, usually 1 km (or 1 mile).


 
  is the path loss exponent.


 
  is a normal (or Gaussian) random variable with zero mean, reflecting the attenuation (in decibel) caused by flat fading. In case of no fading, this variable is 0. In case of only shadow fading or slow fading, this random variable may have Gaussian distribution with 
 
 
standard deviation in dB, resulting in log-normal distribution of the received power in Watt. In case of only fast fading caused by multipath propagation, the corresponding gain in Watts 
 
 
 
  may be modelled as a random variable with Rayleigh distribution or Ricean distribution.1
Corresponding non-logarithmic model
This corresponds to the following non-logarithmic gain model:



where


 
  is the average multiplicative gain at the reference distance 
 
 
 
  from the transmitter. This gain depends on factors such as carrier frequency, antenna heights and antenna gain, for example due to directional antennas; and


 
  is a stochastic process that reflects flat fading. In case of only slow fading (shadowing), it may have log-normal distribution with parameter 
 
 
 
  dB. In case of only fast fading due to multipath propagation, its amplitude may have Rayleigh distribution or Ricean distribution.
Empirical coefficient values for indoor propagation
Empirical measurements of coefficients 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in dB have shown the following values for a number of indoor wave propagation cases.2
