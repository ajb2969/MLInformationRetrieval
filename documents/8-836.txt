   Log-distance path loss model      Log-distance path loss model   The log-distance path loss model is a radio propagation model that predicts the path loss a signal encounters inside a building or densely populated areas over distance.  Mathematical formulation  The model  Log-distance path loss model is formally expressed as:        P   L    =    P   T   x   d  B  m      -    P   R   x   d  B  m        =    P    L  0     +   10   γ     log  10     d   d  0       +   X  g     ,          P  L      subscript  P    T   subscript  x    d  B  m       subscript  P    R   subscript  x    d  B  m                P   subscript  L  0      10  γ    subscript   10     d   subscript  d  0       subscript  X  g       PL\;=P_{Tx_{dBm}}-P_{Rx_{dBm}}\;=\;PL_{0}\;+\;10\gamma\;\log_{10}\frac{d}{d_{0%
 }}\;+\;X_{g},     where      P  L      P  L    {PL}   is the total path loss measured in Decibel (dB)        P   T   x   d  B  m       =   10    log  10     P   T  x     1  m  W           subscript  P    T   subscript  x    d  B  m        10    subscript   10      subscript  P    T  x      1  m  W        P_{Tx_{dBm}}\;=10\log_{10}\frac{P_{Tx}}{1mW}   is the transmitted power in dBm , where      P   T  x      subscript  P    T  x     P_{Tx}   is the transmitted power in watt .        P   R   x   d  B  m       =   10    log  10     P   R  x     1  m  W           subscript  P    R   subscript  x    d  B  m        10    subscript   10      subscript  P    R  x      1  m  W        P_{Rx_{dBm}}\;=10\log_{10}\frac{P_{Rx}}{1mW}   is the received power in dBm, where      P   R  x      subscript  P    R  x     {P_{Rx}}   is the received power in watt.      P   L  0       P   subscript  L  0     PL_{0}   is the path loss at the reference distance d 0 . Unit: Decibel (dB)     d   d   {d}   is the length of the path.      d  0     subscript  d  0    {d_{0}}   is the reference distance, usually 1 km (or 1 mile).     γ   γ   \gamma   is the path loss exponent.      X  g     subscript  X  g    X_{g}   is a normal (or Gaussian) random variable with zero mean , reflecting the attenuation (in decibel) caused by flat fading . In case of no fading, this variable is 0. In case of only shadow fading or slow fading , this random variable may have Gaussian distribution with    σ    σ   \sigma\;    standard deviation in dB , resulting in log-normal distribution of the received power in Watt. In case of only fast fading caused by multipath propagation, the corresponding gain in Watts      F  g    =   10    -   X  g    10         subscript  F  g    superscript  10       subscript  X  g    10      F_{g}\;=\;10^{\frac{-X_{g}}{10}}   may be modelled as a random variable with Rayleigh distribution or Ricean distribution . 1  Corresponding non-logarithmic model  This corresponds to the following non-logarithmic gain model:         P   R  x     P   T  x      =     c  0    F  g     d  γ           subscript  P    R  x     subscript  P    T  x          subscript  c  0    subscript  F  g     superscript  d  γ      \frac{P_{Rx}}{P_{Tx}}\;=\;\frac{c_{0}F_{g}}{d^{\gamma}}     where        c  0    =    d  0  γ    10    -   L  0    10          subscript  c  0      superscript   subscript  d  0   γ    superscript  10       subscript  L  0    10       c_{0}\;=\;{d_{0}^{\gamma}}10^{\frac{-L_{0}}{10}}   is the average multiplicative gain at the reference distance    d  0     subscript  d  0    d_{0}   from the transmitter. This gain depends on factors such as carrier frequency, antenna heights and antenna gain, for example due to directional antennas; and        F  g    =   10    -   X  g    10         subscript  F  g    superscript  10       subscript  X  g    10      F_{g}\;=\;10^{\frac{-X_{g}}{10}}   is a stochastic process that reflects flat fading . In case of only slow fading (shadowing), it may have log-normal distribution with parameter    σ    σ   \sigma\;   dB. In case of only fast fading due to multipath propagation , its amplitude may have Rayleigh distribution or Ricean distribution .
