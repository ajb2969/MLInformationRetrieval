Presheaf (category theory)

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a presheaf on a category 
 
 
 
  is a functor

 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the poset of open sets in a topological space, interpreted as a category, then one recovers the usual notion of presheaf on a topological space.
A morphism of presheaves is defined to be a natural transformation of functors. This makes the collection of all presheaves into a category, and is an example of a functor category. It is often written as 
 
 
 
 
 . A functor into 
 
 
 
  is sometimes called a profunctor.
A presheaf that is naturally isomorphic to the contravariant hom-functor Hom(â€“,A) for some object A of C is called a representable presheaf.
Some authors refer to a functor 
 
 
 
  as a 
 
 
 
 -valued presheaf.
Examples

A simplicial set is a Set-valued presheaf on the simplex category

 
 .

Properties

When 
 
 
 
 
  is a small category, the functor category 
 
 
 
  is cartesian closed.
The partially ordered set of subobjects of 
 
 
 
  form a Heyting algebra, whenever 
 
 
 
  is an object of 
 
 
 
  for small 
 
 
 
 
 .
For any morphism 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the pullback functor of subobjects 
 
 
 
  has a right adjoint, denoted 
 
 
 
 , and a left adjoint, 
 
 
 
 
 . These are the universal and existential quantifiers.
A locally small category 
 
 
 
  embeds fully and faithfully into the category 
 
 
 
  of set-valued presheaves via the Yoneda embedding

 
  which to every object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  associates the hom-set 
 
 
 
 .
The presheaf category 
 
 
 
  is (up to equivalence of categories) the free colimit completion of the category 
 
 
 
 .
