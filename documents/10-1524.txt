   NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone)      NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone)   In enzymology , a NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NAD(P)H + H + + a quinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NAD(P) + + a hydroquinone   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are NADH , NADPH , H + , and quinone , whereas its 3 products are NAD + , NADP + , and hydroquinone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include menadione reductase , phylloquinone reductase , quinone reductase , dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate, , quinone) , DT-diaphorase , flavoprotein NAD(P)H-quinone reductase , menadione oxidoreductase , NAD(P)H dehydrogenase , NAD(P)H menadione reductase , NAD(P)H-quinone dehydrogenase , NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase , NAD(P)H: (quinone-acceptor)oxidoreductase , NAD(P)H: menadione oxidoreductase , NADH-menadione reductase , naphthoquinone reductase , p-benzoquinone reductase , reduced NAD(P)H dehydrogenase , viologen accepting pyridine nucleotide oxidoreductase , vitamin K reductase , diaphorase , reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase , vitamin-K reductase , NAD(P)H2 dehydrogenase (quinone) , NQO1 , QR1 , and NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids . It employs one cofactor , FAD . At least one compound, Dicumarol is known to inhibit this enzyme .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
