   Reciprocal rule      Reciprocal rule   In calculus , the reciprocal rule is a shorthand method of finding the derivative of a function that is the reciprocal of a differentiable function, without using the quotient rule or chain rule .  The reciprocal rule states that the derivative of 1/ g ( x ) is given by        d   d  x     (   1   g   (  x  )     )    =    -    g  ′    (  x  )       (   g   (  x  )    )   2            normal-d    normal-d  x      1    g  x            superscript  g  normal-′   x     superscript    g  x   2      \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\frac{1}{g(x)}\right)=\frac{-g^{\prime}(x)%
 }{(g(x))^{2}}     where g ( x ) ≠ 0.  Proof  From the quotient rule  The reciprocal rule is derived from the quotient rule , with the numerator f ( x ) = 1. Then:         d   d  x      (    1   g   (  x  )      )    =     d   d  x      (     f   (  x  )     g   (  x  )      )            normal-d    normal-d  x      1    g  x         normal-d    normal-d  x        f  x     g  x       \displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\frac{1}{g(x)}\right)=\frac{%
 \mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right)     From the chain rule and power rule  It is also possible to derive the reciprocal rule from the chain rule and power rule , by a process very much like that of the derivation of the quotient rule. One thinks of 1/ g ( x ) as being the function 1/ x composed with the function g ( x ). The result then follows by application of the chain rule.        d   d  x     (   1   g   (  x  )     )    =    d   d  x      (   g   (  x  )    )    -  1     =   -    1  ⋅    (   g   (  x  )    )    -  2    ⋅   g  ′     (  x  )     =   -     g  ′    (  x  )      (   g   (  x  )    )   2               d    d  x      1    g  x         d    d  x     superscript    g  x     1               normal-⋅  1   superscript    g  x     2     superscript  g  normal-′    x                superscript  g  normal-′   x    superscript    g  x   2        \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{g(x)}\right)=\frac{d}{dx}\left({g(x)}\right)^{-1}=-%

 {(x^{3}+4x)^{2}}.     The derivative of 1/cos( x ) (when cos( x ) ≠ 0) is:         d   d  x     (   1   cos   (  x  )     )    =    sin   (  x  )      cos  2    (  x  )     =    1   cos   (  x  )       sin   (  x  )     cos   (  x  )      =    sec   (  x  )     tan   (  x  )      .            normal-d    normal-d  x      1    x         x     superscript   2   x             1    x        x     x              x     x       \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\right)=\frac{\sin(x)}{%
 \cos^{2}(x)}=\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}=\sec(x)\tan(x).     For more general examples, see the derivative article.  See also   Product rule  Quotient rule  Chain rule  Difference quotient   "  Category:Differentiation rules
