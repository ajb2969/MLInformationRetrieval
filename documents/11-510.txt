   Lipid-phosphate phosphatase      Lipid-phosphate phosphatase   In enzymology , a lipid-phosphate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (9S,10S)-10-hydroxy-9-(phosphonooxy)octadecanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (9S,10S)-9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (9S,10S)-10-hydroxy-9-(phosphonooxy)octadecanoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are (9S,10S)-9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (9S,10S)-10-hydroxy-9-(phosphonooxy)octadecanoate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include hydroxy fatty acid phosphatase , dihydroxy fatty acid phosphatase , hydroxy lipid phosphatase , sEH (ambiguous) , and soluble epoxide hydrolase (ambiguous) .
