   Nearly completely decomposable Markov chain      Nearly completely decomposable Markov chain   In probability theory , a nearly completely decomposable (NCD) Markov chain is a Markov chain where the state-space can be partitioned in such a way that movement within a partition occurs much more frequently than movement between partitions. 1 Particularly efficient algorithms exist to compute the stationary distribution of Markov chains with this property. 2  Definition  Ando and Fisher define a completely decomposable matrix as one where "an identical rearrangement of rows and columns leaves a set of square submatrices on the principal diagonal and zeros everywhere else." A nearly completely decomposable matrix is one where an identical rearrangement of rows and columns leaves a set of square submatrices on the principal diagonal and small nonzeros everywhere else. 3 4  Example  A Markov chain with transition matrix    P =     \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\ \end{pmatrix} + \epsilon \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\ \end{pmatrix} is nearly completely decomposable if ε is small (say 0.1). 5  Stationary distribution algorithms  Special-purpose iterative algorithms have been designed for NCD Markov chains 6 though the multi–level algorithm, a general purpose algorithm, 7 has been shown experimentally to be competitive and in some cases significantly faster. 8  See also   Lumpability   References  "  Category:Markov processes     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Example 1.1 from ↩   ↩  ↩
