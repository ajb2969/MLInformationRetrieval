Grönwall's inequality

In mathematics, Grönwall's inequality (also called Grönwall's lemma or the Grönwall–Bellman inequality) allows one to bound a function that is known to satisfy a certain differential or integral inequality by the solution of the corresponding differential or integral equation. There are two forms of the lemma, a differential form and an integral form. For the latter there are several variants.
Grönwall's inequality is an important tool to obtain various estimates in the theory of ordinary and stochastic differential equations. In particular, it provides a Comparison theorem that can be used to prove uniqueness of a solution to the initial value problem; see the Picard–Lindelöf theorem.
It is named for Thomas Hakon Grönwall (1877–1932). Grönwall is the Swedish spelling of his name, but he spelled his name as Gronwall in his scientific publications after emigrating to the United States.
The differential form was proven by Grönwall in 1919.1 The integral form was proven by Richard Bellman in 1943.2
A nonlinear generalization of the Grönwall–Bellman inequality is known as Bihari's inequality. Other variants and generalizations can be found in Pachpatte, B.G. (1998).3
Differential form
Let 
 
 
 
  denote an interval of the real line of the form 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 




then 
 
 
 
  is bounded by the solution of the corresponding differential equation

for all 
 
 
 
 .
Remark: There are no assumptions on the signs of the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Proof
Define the function



Note that 
 
 
 
  satisfies



with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . By the quotient rule



Thus the derivative of the function 
 
 
 
  is non-positive and (by the mean value theorem) the function is bounded by its value at the initial point 
 
 
 
  of the interval 
 
 
 
 :



which is Grönwall's inequality.
Integral form for continuous functions
Let 
 
 
 
  denote an interval of the real line of the form 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 


(a) If 
 
 
 
  is non-negative and if 
 
 
 
  satisfies the integral inequality








then
 
 





(b) If, in addition, the function 
 
 
 
  is non-decreasing, then









Remarks:

There are no assumptions on the signs of the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Compared to the differential form, differentiability of 
 
 
 
  is not needed for the integral form.
For a version of Grönwall's inequality which doesn't need continuity of

Proof
(a) Define



Using the product rule, the chain rule, the derivative of the exponential function and the fundamental theorem of calculus, we obtain for the derivative



where we used the assumed integral inequality for the upper estimate. Since 
 
 
 
  and the exponential are non-negative, this gives an upper estimate for the derivative of 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
 , integration of this inequality from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  gives



Using the definition of 
 
 
 
  for the first step, and then this inequality and the functional equation of the exponential function, we obtain



Substituting this result into the assumed integral inequality gives Grönwall's inequality.
(b) If the function 
 
 
 
 
  is non-decreasing, then part (a), the fact 
 
 
 
 , and the fundamental theorem of calculus imply that



Integral form with locally finite measures
Let 
 
 
 
  denote an interval of the real line of the form 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 




and that 
 
 
 
  satisfies the integral inequality



If, in addition,

the function 
 
 
 
  is non-negative or
the function  is continuous for 
 
 
 
  and the function 
 
 
 
  is integrable with respect to 
 
 
 
  in the sense that









then 
 
 
 
  satisfies Grönwall's inequality



for all 
 
 
 
 , where  denotes to open interval 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks

There are no continuity assumptions on the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The integral in Grönwall's inequality is allowed to give the value infinity.
If 
 
 
 
  is the zero function and 
 
 
 
  is non-negative, then Grönwall's inequality implies that 
 
 
 
  is the zero function.
The integrability of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  is essential for the result. For a counterexample, let 
 
 
 
  denote Lebesgue measure on the unit interval

 
 , define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 

 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the zero function.
The version given in the textbook by S. Ethier and T. Kurtz.4 makes the stronger assumptions that 
 
 
 
  is a non-negative constant and 
 
 
 
  is bounded on bounded intervals, but doesn't assume that the measure 
 
 
 
  is locally finite. Compared to the one given below, their proof does not discuss the behaviour of the remainder .

Special cases

If the measure 
 
 
 
  has a density 
 
 
 
  with respect to Lebesgue measure, then Grönwall's inequality can be rewritten as










If the function 
 
 
 
  is non-negative and the density 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is bounded by a constant 
 
 
 
 , then










If, in addition, the non-negative function 
 
 
 
  is non-decreasing, then







=\alpha(t)\exp(c(t-a)),\qquad t\in I.
Outline of proof
The proof is divided into three steps. In idea is to substitute the assumed integral inequality into itself 
 
 
 
  times. This is done in Claim 1 using mathematical induction. In Claim 2 we rewrite the measure of a simplex in a convenient form, using the permutation invariance of product measures. In the third step we pass to the limit 
 
 
 
  to infinity to derive the desired variant of Grönwall's inequality.
Detailed proof
Claim 1: Iterating the inequality
For every natural number 
 
 
 
  including zero,



with remainder



where



Proof of Claim 1
We use mathematical induction. For 
 
 
 
  this is just the assumed integral inequality, because the empty sum is defined as zero.
Induction step from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 : Inserting the assumed integral inequality for the function 
 
 
 
  into the remainder gives



with



Using the Fubini–Tonelli theorem to interchange the two integrals, we obtain



Hence Claim 1 is proved for 
 
 
 
 .
Claim 2: Measure of the simplex
For every natural number 
 
 
 
  including zero and all 
 
 




with equality in case  is continuous for 
 
 
 
 .
Proof of Claim 2
For 
 
 
 
 , the claim is true by our definitions. Therefore, consider 
 
 
 
  in the following.
Let  denote the set of all permutations of the indices in }. For every permutation  define



Therefore,



Since they all have the same measure with respect to the 
 
 
 
 -fold product of 
 
 
 
 , and since there are 
 
 
 
  permutations in , the claimed inequality follows.
Assume now that  is continuous for 
 
 
 
 . Then, for different indices }, the set



is contained in a hyperplane, hence by an application of Fubini's theorem its measure with respect to the 
 
 
 
 -fold product of 
 
 
 
  is zero. Since



By assumption we have . Hence, the integrability assumption on 
 
 
 
  implies that



Claim 2 and the series representation of the exponential function imply the estimate
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \mu^{\otimes k}(A_k(s,t))
 \le\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)^k}{k!}
 \le\exp\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)$$
for all $s  in $I$. If the function $α$ is non-negative, then it suffices to insert these results into Claim 1 to derive the above variant of Grönwall's inequality for the function $u$.
In case  is continuous for $t ∈ I$, Claim 2 gives
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \mu^{\otimes k}(A_k(s,t))
 =\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)^k}{k!}
 \to\exp\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)\qquad\text{as }n\to\infty$$
and the integrability of the function $α$ permits to use the dominated convergence theorem to derive Grönwall's inequality.
