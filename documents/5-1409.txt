   Grönwall's inequality      Grönwall's inequality   In mathematics , Grönwall's inequality (also called Grönwall's lemma or the Grönwall–Bellman inequality ) allows one to bound a function that is known to satisfy a certain differential or integral inequality by the solution of the corresponding differential or integral equation. There are two forms of the lemma, a differential form and an integral form. For the latter there are several variants.  Grönwall's inequality is an important tool to obtain various estimates in the theory of ordinary and stochastic differential equations . In particular, it provides a Comparison theorem that can be used to prove uniqueness of a solution to the initial value problem ; see the Picard–Lindelöf theorem .  It is named for Thomas Hakon Grönwall (1877–1932). Grönwall is the Swedish spelling of his name, but he spelled his name as Gronwall in his scientific publications after emigrating to the United States.  The differential form was proven by Grönwall in 1919. 1 The integral form was proven by Richard Bellman in 1943. 2  A nonlinear generalization of the Grönwall–Bellman inequality is known as Bihari's inequality . Other variants and generalizations can be found in Pachpatte, B.G. (1998). 3  Differential form  Let   I   I   I   denote an interval of the real line of the form    [  a  ,    ∞   )     a    normal-  normal-∞     [a, ∞)   or    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   or    [  a  ,  b  )     a  b    [a,b)   with   β   β   β        u   u   u     then     y  ′   (  t  )    =   β   (  t  )   y   (  t  )          y  normal-′  t     β  t  y  t     y′(t)=β(t)y(t)   is bounded by the solution of the corresponding differential equation      u   (  t  )    ≤   u   (  a  )    exp   (    ∫  a  t    β   (  s  )   d  s    )           u  t     u  a      superscript   subscript   a   t     β  s  normal-d  s        u(t)\leq u(a)\exp\biggl(\int_{a}^{t}\beta(s)\,\mathrm{d}s\biggr)   :      t  ∈  I      t  normal-∈  I    t∈I     for all   β   β   β   .

Remarks   There are no continuity assumptions on the functions   u   u   u   and   u   u   u   .  The integral in Grönwall's inequality is allowed to give the value infinity.  If   u   u   u   is the zero function and   μ   μ   μ   is non-negative, then Grönwall's inequality implies that   μ   μ   μ   is the zero function.

The version given in the textbook by S. Ethier and T. Kurtz. 4 makes the stronger assumptions that   μ   μ   μ   is a non-negative constant and   β   β   β   is bounded on bounded intervals, but doesn't assume that the measure       u   (  t  )    ≤    α   (  t  )    +    ∫  a  t    α   (  s  )   β   (  s  )    exp   (    ∫  s  t    β   (  r  )   d  r    )    d  s      ,   t  ∈  I    .     formulae-sequence      u  t       α  t     superscript   subscript   a   t     α  s  β  s      superscript   subscript   s   t     β  r  normal-d  r     normal-d  s        t  I     u(t)\leq\alpha(t)+\int_{a}^{t}\alpha(s)\beta(s)\exp\biggl(\int_{s}^{t}\beta(r)%

Claim 2: Measure of the simplex  For every natural number    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   including zero and all    n  ≥  1      n  normal-≥  1    n≥1        n   n   n     with equality in case is continuous for   μ   μ   μ   .  Proof of Claim 2  For    n  !      n    n!   , the claim is true by our definitions. Therefore, consider    t  ∈  I      t  normal-∈  I    t∈I   in the following.  Let denote the set of all permutations of the indices in }. For every permutation define      {    (   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  n   )   ∈   I   s  ,  t   n    ∣    s  i   =   s  j    }     conditional-set      subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  n     superscript   subscript  I   s  t    n       subscript  s  i    subscript  s  j      \{(s_{1},\ldots,s_{n})\in I_{s,t}^{n}\mid s_{i}=s_{j}\}     Therefore,     n   n   n     Since they all have the same measure with respect to the   μ   μ   μ   -fold product of   n   n   n   , and since there are   u   u   u   permutations in , the claimed inequality follows.  Assume now that is continuous for        lim   n  →  ∞      R  n    (  t  )     =  0   ,   t  ∈  I    .     formulae-sequence      subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  R  n   t    0     t  I     \lim_{n\to\infty}R_{n}(t)=0,\qquad t\in I.   . Then, for different indices }, the set        ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1      μ    ⊗  k     (    A  k    (  s  ,  t  )    )     ≤    ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1       (   μ   (   I   s  ,  t    )    )   k    k  !     ≤   exp   (   μ   (   I   s  ,  t    )    )            superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       superscript  μ   tensor-product  absent  k       subscript  A  k    s  t        superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       superscript    μ   subscript  I   s  t     k     k              μ   subscript  I   s  t         \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\mu^{\otimes k}(A_{k}(s,t))\leq\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\bigl(\mu%

Since     u   u   u     By assumption we have . Hence, the integrability assumption on       ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1      μ    ⊗  k     (    A  k    (  s  ,  t  )    )     =    ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1       (   μ   (   I   s  ,  t    )    )   k    k  !     →   exp   (   μ   (   I   s  ,  t    )    )       as  n   →  ∞      formulae-sequence        superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       superscript  μ   tensor-product  absent  k       subscript  A  k    s  t        superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       superscript    μ   subscript  I   s  t     k     k       normal-→        μ   subscript  I   s  t         normal-→    as  n       \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\mu^{\otimes k}(A_{k}(s,t))=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\bigl(\mu(I_%
 {s,t})\bigr)^{k}}{k!}\to\exp\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)\qquad\text{as }n\to\infty   implies that     α   α   α     Claim 2 and the series representation of the exponential function imply the estimate  $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \mu^{\otimes k}(A_k(s,t))
 \le\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)^k}{k!}
 \le\exp\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)$$  for all $s  in $I$ . If the function $α$ is non-negative, then it suffices to insert these results into Claim 1 to derive the above variant of Grönwall's inequality for the function $u$ .  In case is continuous for $t ∈ I$ , Claim 2 gives  $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \mu^{\otimes k}(A_k(s,t))
 =\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)^k}{k!}
 \to\exp\bigl(\mu(I_{s,t})\bigr)\qquad\text{as }n\to\infty$$  and the integrability of the function $α$ permits to use the dominated convergence theorem to derive Grönwall's inequality.
