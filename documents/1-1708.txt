   Euler's totient function      Euler's totient function   (Figure)  The first thousand values of    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    œÜ(n)      In number theory , Euler's totient function (or Euler's phi function ), denoted as    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    œÜ(n)   or    œï   (  n  )       œï  n    œï(n)   , is an arithmetic function that counts the positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n . (These integers are sometimes referred to as totatives of n .) Thus, if n is a positive integer , then    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    œÜ(n)   is the number of integers k in the range    1  ‚â§  k  ‚â§  n      1  normal-‚â§  k  normal-‚â§  n    1‚â§k‚â§n   for which the greatest common divisor      g  c  d   (  n  ,  k  )    =  1        g  c  d   n  k    1    gcd(n,k)=1   . 1 2  Euler's totient function is a multiplicative function , meaning that if two numbers m and n are coprime , then     œÜ   (   m  n   )    =   œÜ   (  m  )   œÜ   (  n  )          œÜ    m  n      œÜ  m  œÜ  n     œÜ(mn)=œÜ(m)œÜ(n)   . 3 4  For example, let    n  =  9      n  9    n=9   . Then     g  c  d   (  9  ,  3  )    =   g  c  d   (  9  ,  6  )    =  3          g  c  d   9  3      g  c  d   9  6         3     gcd(9,3)=gcd(9,6)=3   and     g  c  d   (  9  ,  9  )    =  9        g  c  d   9  9    9    gcd(9,9)=9   . The other six numbers in the range    1  ‚â§  k  ‚â§  9      1  normal-‚â§  k  normal-‚â§  9    1‚â§k‚â§9   , that is 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 are relatively prime to 9. Therefore,     œÜ   (  9  )    =  6        œÜ  9   6    œÜ(9)=6   . As another example,     œÜ   (  1  )    =  1        œÜ  1   1    œÜ(1)=1   since     g  c  d   (  1  ,  1  )    =  1        g  c  d   1  1    1    gcd(1,1)=1   .  Euler's phi function is important mainly because it gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n (the group of units of the ring ‚Ñ§/n‚Ñ§). 5 It also plays a key role in the definition of the RSA encryption system.  History, terminology, and notation  Leonhard Euler introduced the function in 1763. 6 7 8 However, he did not at that time choose any specific symbol to denote it. In a 1784 publication, Euler studied the function further, choosing the Greek letter œÄ to denote it: he wrote œÄD for "the multitude of numbers less than D, and which have no common divisor with it". 9 The standard notation 10 11 œÜ( A ) comes from Gauss 's 1801 treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae . 12 However, Gauss didn't use parentheses around the argument and wrote œÜ A . Thus, it is often called Euler's phi function or simply the phi function .  In 1879, J. J. Sylvester coined the term totient for this function, 13 14 so it is also referred to as Euler's totient function , the Euler totient , or Euler's totient . Jordan's totient is a generalization of Euler's.  The cototient of n is defined as n ‚Äì œÜ( n ), i.e. the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are divisible by at least one prime that also divides n .  Computing Euler's totient function  There are several formulas for computing    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    œÜ(n)   .  Euler's product formula  It states        œÜ   (  n  )    =   n    ‚àè   p  ‚à£  n     (   1  -   1  p    )      ,        œÜ  n     n    subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-‚à£  n      1    1  p        \varphi(n)=n\prod_{p\mid n}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right),   where the product is over the distinct prime numbers dividing n. (The notation is described in the article Arithmetical function .)  The proof of Euler's product formula depends on two important facts.  1) The function œÜ( n ) is multiplicative  This means that if gcd( m , n ) = 1, then œÜ( mn ) = œÜ( m ) œÜ( n ). ( Sketch of proof : let A , B , C be the sets of residue classes modulo-and-coprime to m , n , mn respectively; then there is a bijection between A √ó B and C , by the Chinese remainder theorem .)  ====2) œÜ( p k ) = p k ‚àí p k ‚àí1 = p k ‚àí1 ( p ‚àí 1)====  That is, if p is prime and k ‚â• 1 then        œÜ   (   p  k   )    =    p  k   -   p   k  -  1     =    p   k  -  1     (   p  -  1   )    =    p  k    (   1  -   1  p    )     .          œÜ   superscript  p  k       superscript  p  k    superscript  p    k  1             superscript  p    k  1      p  1            superscript  p  k     1    1  p        \varphi(p^{k})=p^{k}-p^{k-1}=p^{k-1}(p-1)=p^{k}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right).     Proof : since p is a prime number the only possible values of gcd( p k , m ) are 1, p , p 2 , ..., p k , and the only way for gcd( p k , m ) to not equal 1 is for m to be a multiple of p . The multiples of p that are less than or equal to p k are p , 2 p , 3 p , ..., p k ‚àí 1 p = p k , and there are p k ‚àí 1 of them. Therefore, the other p k ‚àí p k ‚àí 1 numbers are all relatively prime to p k .  Proof of Euler's product formula  The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that if n > 1 there is a unique expression for n ,       n  =    p  1   k  1    ‚ãØ   p  r   k  r      ,      n     superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  k  1    normal-‚ãØ   superscript   subscript  p  r    subscript  k  r       n=p_{1}^{k_{1}}\cdots p_{r}^{k_{r}},     where p 1 2 r are prime numbers and each k i ‚â• 1. (The case n = 1 corresponds to the empty product.)  Repeatedly using the multiplicative property of œÜ and the formula for œÜ( p k ) gives      œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    \displaystyle\varphi(n)     This is Euler's product formula.  Example       œÜ   (  36  )    =   œÜ   (    2  2    3  2    )    =   36   (   1  -   1  2    )    (   1  -   1  3    )    =   36  ‚ãÖ   1  2   ‚ãÖ   2  3    =  12.          œÜ  36     œÜ     superscript  2  2    superscript  3  2            36    1    1  2      1    1  3           normal-‚ãÖ  36    1  2     2  3         12.     \varphi(36)=\varphi\left(2^{2}3^{2}\right)=36\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1%
 -\frac{1}{3}\right)=36\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{3}=12.     In words, this says that the distinct prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3; half of the thirty-six integers from 1 to 36 are divisible by 2, leaving eighteen; a third of those are divisible by 3, leaving twelve numbers that are coprime to 36. And indeed there are twelve positive integers that are coprime with 36 and lower than 36: 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, and 35.  Fourier transform  The totient is the discrete Fourier transform of the gcd , evaluated at 1: ¬† ()      ‚Ñ±   {  ùê±  }    [  m  ]       ‚Ñ±   ùê±    delimited-[]  m     \displaystyle\mathcal{F}\left\{\mathbf{x}\right\}[m]   The real part of this formula is        œÜ   (  n  )    =    ‚àë   k  =  1   n     gcd   (  k  ,  n  )     cos   2  œÄ   k  n        .        œÜ  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n       k  n       2  œÄ    k  n         \varphi(n)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\gcd(k,n)\cos{2\pi\frac{k}{n}}.     Note that unlike the other two formulae (the Euler product and the divisor sum) this one does not require knowing the factors of n . However, it does involve the calculation of the greatest common divisor of n and every positive integer less than n , which would suffice to provide the factorization anyway.  Divisor sum  The property established by Gauss, 15 that         ‚àë   d  ‚à£  n     œÜ   (  d  )     =  n   ,        subscript    fragments  d  normal-‚à£  n      œÜ  d    n    \sum_{d\mid n}\varphi(d)=n,   where the sum is over all positive divisors d of n , can be proven in several ways. (see Arithmetical function for notational conventions.)  One way is to note that œÜ( d ) is also equal to the number of possible generators of the cyclic group  C d ; specifically, if C d = , then g k is a generator for every k coprime to d . Since every element of C n generates a cyclic subgroup , and all subgroups of C d ‚â§ C n are generated by some element of C n , the formula follows. 16 In the article Root of unity Euler's formula is derived by using this argument in the special case of the multiplicative group of the n th roots of unity.  This formula can also be derived in a more concrete manner. 17 Let n = 20 and consider the fractions between 0 and 1 with denominator 20:        1  20    ,    2  20    ,    3  20    ,    4  20    ,    5  20    ,    6  20    ,    7  20    ,    8  20    ,    9  20    ,    10  20    ,    11  20    ,    12  20    ,    13  20    ,    14  20    ,    15  20    ,    16  20    ,    17  20    ,    18  20    ,    19  20    ,    20  20         1  20     2  20     3  20     4  20     5  20     6  20     7  20     8  20     9  20     10  20     11  20     12  20     13  20     14  20     15  20     16  20     17  20     18  20     19  20     20  20     \tfrac{1}{20},\,\tfrac{2}{20},\,\tfrac{3}{20},\,\tfrac{4}{20},\,\tfrac{5}{20},%

Which fractions have 20 as denominator? The ones whose numerators are relatively prime to 20     (   1  20   ,   3  20   ,   7  20   ,   9  20   ,   11  20   ,   13  20   ,   17  20   ,   19  20   )   .       1  20     3  20     7  20     9  20     11  20     13  20     17  20     19  20     \left(\tfrac{1}{20},\,\tfrac{3}{20},\,\tfrac{7}{20},\,\tfrac{9}{20},\,\tfrac{1%
 1}{20},\,\tfrac{13}{20},\,\tfrac{17}{20},\,\tfrac{19}{20}\right).   By definition this is œÜ(20) fractions. Similarly, there are œÜ(10) = 4 fractions with denominator 10     (   1  10   ,   3  10   ,   7  10   ,   9  10   )   ,       1  10     3  10     7  10     9  10     \left(\tfrac{1}{10},\,\tfrac{3}{10},\,\tfrac{7}{10},\,\tfrac{9}{10}\right),   œÜ(5) = 4 fractions with denominator 5     (   1  5   ,   2  5   ,   3  5   ,   4  5   )   ,       1  5     2  5     3  5     4  5     \left(\tfrac{1}{5},\,\tfrac{2}{5},\,\tfrac{3}{5},\,\tfrac{4}{5}\right),   and so on.  In detail, we're considering the fractions of the form k/n where k is an integer from 1 to n inclusive. Upon reducing these to lowest terms, each fraction will have as its denominator some divisor of n . We can group the fractions together by denominator, and we must show that for a given divisor d of n , the number of such fractions with denominator d is œÜ(d) .  Note that to reduce k/n to lowest terms, we divide the numerator and denominator by gcd(k, n) . The reduced fractions with denominator d are therefore precisely the ones originally of the form k/n in which gcd(k, n)=n/d . The question therefore becomes: how many k are there less than or equal to n which verify gcd(k, n)=n/d ? Any such k must clearly be a multiple of n/d , but it must also be coprime to d (if it had any common divisor s with d , then sn/d would be a larger common divisor of n and k ). Conversely, any multiple k of n/d which is coprime to d will satisfy gcd(n, k)=n/d . We can generate œÜ(d) such numbers by taking the numbers less than d coprime to d and multiplying each one by n/d (these products will of course each by smaller than n , as required). This in fact generates all such numbers, as if k is a multiple of n/d coprime to d (and less than n ), then k/(n/d) will still be coprime to d , and must also be smaller than d , else k would be larger than n . Thus there are precisely œÜ(d) values of k less than or equal to n such that gcd(k, n)=n/d , which was to be demonstrated.  M√∂bius inversion gives        œÜ   (  n  )    =    ‚àë   d  ‚à£  n      d  ‚ãÖ  Œº    (   n  d   )     =   n    ‚àë   d  ‚à£  n      Œº   (  d  )    d      ,          œÜ  n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-‚à£  n       normal-‚ãÖ  d  Œº     n  d            n    subscript    fragments  d  normal-‚à£  n        Œº  d   d        \varphi(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d\cdot\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)=n\sum_{d\mid n}%
 \frac{\mu(d)}{d},     where Œº is the M√∂bius function .  This formula may also be derived from the product formula by multiplying out     ‚àè   p  ‚à£  n     (   1  -   1  p    )       subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-‚à£  n      1    1  p      \prod_{p\mid n}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)   to get      ‚àë   d  ‚à£  n      Œº   (  d  )    d    .      subscript    fragments  d  normal-‚à£  n        Œº  d   d     \sum_{d\mid n}\frac{\mu(d)}{d}.     Riemann zeta function limit  For    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   the Euler totient function can be calculated as a limit involving the Riemann zeta function:       œÜ   (  n  )    =   n    lim   s  ‚Üí  1     Œ∂   (  s  )     ‚àë   d  |  n     Œº   (  d  )     (   e   1  /  d    )    (   s  -  1   )               œÜ  n     n    subscript    normal-‚Üí  s  1      Œ∂  s    subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  n      Œº  d   superscript   superscript  e    1  d      s  1           \varphi(n)=n\lim\limits_{s\rightarrow 1}\zeta(s)\sum\limits_{d|n}\mu(d)(e^{1/d%
 })^{(s-1)}     where      Œ∂   (  s  )       Œ∂  s    \zeta(s)   is the Riemann zeta function ,   Œº   Œº   \mu   is the M√∂bius function ,   e   e   e   is e (mathematical constant) , and   d   d   d   is a divisor.  Some values of the function  The first 99 values  are shown in the table and graph below: 18  (Figure)  Graph of the first 100 values           œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    \varphi(n)      +0   +1   +2   +3   +4   +5   +6   +7   +8   +9       0+    1   1   2   2   4   2   6   4   6     10+   4   10   4   12   6   8   8   16   6   18     20+   8   12   10   22   8   20   12   18   12   28     30+   8   30   16   20   16   24   12   36   18   24     40+   16   40   12   42   20   24   22   46   16   42     50+   20   32   24   52   18   40   24   36   28   58     60+   16   60   30   36   32   48   20   66   32   44     70+   24   70   24   72   36   40   36   60   24   78     80+   32   54   40   82   24   64   42   56   40   88     90+   24   72   44   60   46   72   32   96   42   60     The top line in the graph, y = n ‚àí 1, is a true upper bound . It is attained whenever n is prime. There is no lower bound that is a straight line of positive slope; no matter how gentle the slope of a line is, there will eventually be points of the plot below the line. More precisely, the lower limit of the graph is proportional to n /log¬†log n rather than being linear. 19   Euler's theorem  This states that if a and n are relatively prime then        a   œÜ   (  n  )     ‚â°   1  mod  n    .       superscript  a    œÜ  n     modulo  1  n     a^{\varphi(n)}\equiv 1\mod n.\,     The special case where n is prime is known as Fermat's little theorem .  This follows from Lagrange's theorem and the fact that œÜ( n ) is the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n .  The RSA cryptosystem is based on this theorem: it implies that the inverse of the function    a  ‚Ü¶    a  e   mod  n      maps-to  a   modulo   superscript  a  e   n     a\mapsto a^{e}\mod n   , where   e   e   e   is the (public) encryption exponent, is the function    b  ‚Ü¶    b  d   mod  n      maps-to  b   modulo   superscript  b  d   n     b\mapsto b^{d}\mod n   , where   d   d   d   , the (private) decryption exponent, is the multiplicative inverse of   e   e   e   modulo    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    \varphi(n)   . The difficulty of computing    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    \varphi(n)   without knowing the factorization of   n   n   n   is thus the difficulty of computing   d   d   d   : this is known as the RSA problem which can be solved by factoring   n   n   n   . The owner of the private key knows the factorization, since an RSA private key is constructed by choosing   n   n   n   as the product of two (randomly chosen) large primes   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   . Only   n   n   n   is publicly disclosed, and given the difficulty to factor large numbers we have the guarantee that no-one else knows the factorization.

Note the special cases    \varphi(2m) = \begin{cases} 2\varphi(m) &\text{ if } m \text{ is even} \\ \varphi(m) &\text{ if } m \text{ is odd} \end{cases}  and   \;\varphi\left(n^m\right) = n^{m-1}\varphi(n).             œÜ   (   lcm   (  m  ,  n  )    )    ‚ãÖ  œÜ    (   gcd   (  m  ,  n  )    )    =     œÜ   (  m  )    ‚ãÖ  œÜ    (  n  )     .         normal-‚ãÖ    œÜ    lcm   m  n     œÜ     gcd   m  n        normal-‚ãÖ    œÜ  m   œÜ   n     \varphi(\mathrm{lcm}(m,n))\cdot\varphi(\mathrm{gcd}(m,n))=\varphi(m)\cdot%

Compare this to the formula        lcm   (  m  ,  n  )    ‚ãÖ  gcd    (  m  ,  n  )    =   m  ‚ãÖ  n    .         normal-‚ãÖ    lcm   m  n    gcd    m  n     normal-‚ãÖ  m  n     \mathrm{lcm}(m,n)\cdot\mathrm{gcd}(m,n)=m\cdot n.

Formulae involving the golden ratio  Schneider 27 found a pair of identities connecting the totient function, the golden ratio and the M√∂bius function     Œº   (  n  )       Œº  n    \mu(n)   . In this section    œÜ   (  n  )       œÜ  n    \varphi(n)   is the totient function, and    œï  =    1  +   5    2   =   1.618  ‚Ä¶         œï      1    5    2          1.618  normal-‚Ä¶      \phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}=1.618\dots   is the golden ratio.  They are:      œï  =   -    ‚àë   k  =  1   ‚àû      œÜ   (  k  )    k    log   (   1  -   1   œï  k     )           œï      superscript   subscript     k  1            œÜ  k   k       1    1   superscript  œï  k           \phi=-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\varphi(k)}{k}\log\left(1-\frac{1}{\phi^{k}}\right)   and        1  œï   =   -    ‚àë   k  =  1   ‚àû      Œº   (  k  )    k    log   (   1  -   1   œï  k     )        .        1  œï       superscript   subscript     k  1            Œº  k   k       1    1   superscript  œï  k           \frac{1}{\phi}=-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(k)}{k}\log\left(1-\frac{1}{\phi^{%

Subtracting them gives        ‚àë   k  =  1   ‚àû       Œº   (  k  )    -   œÜ   (  k  )     k    log   (   1  -   1   œï  k     )      =  1.        superscript   subscript     k  1              Œº  k     œÜ  k    k       1    1   superscript  œï  k        1.    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(k)-\varphi(k)}{k}\log\left(1-\frac{1}{\phi^{k}}%
 \right)=1.   Applying the exponential function to both sides of the preceding identity yields an infinite product formula for Euler's number    e   e   e          e  =    ‚àè   k  =  1   ‚àû     (   1  -   1   œï  k     )      Œº   (  k  )    -   œÜ   (  k  )     k      .      e    superscript   subscript  product    k  1       superscript    1    1   superscript  œï  k           Œº  k     œÜ  k    k       e=\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{\phi^{k}}\right)^{\frac{\mu(k)-\varphi(%

These two formulae can be proved by using little more than the formulae for œÜ( n ) and the divisor sum function œÉ( n ).  In fact, during the proof of the second formula, the inequality        6   œÄ  2    <    œÜ   (  n  )   œÉ   (  n  )     n  2    <  1   ,          6   superscript  œÄ  2        œÜ  n  œÉ  n    superscript  n  2         1     \frac{6}{\pi^{2}}<\frac{\varphi(n)\sigma(n)}{n^{2}}<1,   true for n > 1, is proven.  We also have 31        lim   inf     œÜ   (  n  )    n    log   log  n       =   e   -  Œ≥     .         infimum        œÜ  n   n       n        superscript  e    Œ≥      \lim\inf\frac{\varphi(n)}{n}\log\log n=e^{-\gamma}.

Proving this doesn't quite require the prime number theorem . 32 33 Since log log ( n ) goes to infinity, this formula shows that       lim   inf    œÜ   (  n  )    n     =  0.         infimum      œÜ  n   n     0.    \lim\inf\frac{\varphi(n)}{n}=0.     In fact, more is true. 34 35       œÜ   (  n  )    >   n      e  Œ≥     log   log  n     +   3   log   log  n             œÜ  n     n       superscript  e  Œ≥       n       3      n         \varphi(n)>\frac{n}{e^{\gamma}\;\log\log n+\frac{3}{\log\log n}}   for n > 2, and       œÜ   (  n  )    <   n    e  Œ≥    log   log  n            œÜ  n     n     superscript  e  Œ≥       n        \varphi(n)<\frac{n}{e^{\gamma}\log\log n}   for infinitely many n .  The second inequality was shown by Jean-Louis Nicolas . Ribenboim says "The method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption." 36  For the average order, we have 37 38      œÜ   (  1  )   +  œÜ   (  2  )   +  ‚ãØ  +  œÜ   (  n  )   =    3   n  2     œÄ  2    +  O   (  n    (  log  n  )    2  /  3      (  log  log  n  )    4  /  3    )    (  n  ‚Üí  ‚àû  )   ,     fragments  œÜ   fragments  normal-(  1  normal-)    œÜ   fragments  normal-(  2  normal-)    normal-‚ãØ   œÜ   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)        3   superscript  n  2     superscript  œÄ  2     O   fragments  normal-(  n   superscript   fragments  normal-(   n  normal-)     2  3     superscript   fragments  normal-(    n  normal-)     4  3    normal-)     fragments  normal-(  n  normal-‚Üí   normal-)   normal-,    \varphi(1)+\varphi(2)+\cdots+\varphi(n)=\frac{3n^{2}}{\pi^{2}}+O\left(n(\log n%

Korobov (this is currently the best known estimate of this type). The "Big O" stands for a quantity that is bounded by a constant times the function of "n" inside the parentheses (which is small compared to n 2 ).  This result can be used to prove 39 that the probability of two randomly chosen numbers being relatively prime is     6   œÄ  2    .      6   superscript  œÄ  2     \tfrac{6}{\pi^{2}}.     Ratio of consecutive values  In 1950 Somayajulu proved 40 41       lim   inf    œÜ   (   n  +  1   )     œÜ   (  n  )       =  0         infimum      œÜ    n  1      œÜ  n      0    \lim\inf\frac{\varphi(n+1)}{\varphi(n)}=0   and        lim   sup    œÜ   (   n  +  1   )     œÜ   (  n  )       =  ‚àû   .         supremum      œÜ    n  1      œÜ  n         \lim\sup\frac{\varphi(n+1)}{\varphi(n)}=\infty.   In 1954 Schinzel and Sierpi≈Ñski strengthened this, proving 42 43 that the set      {       œÜ   (   n  +  1   )     œÜ   (  n  )     ,  n   =  1   ,   2  ,  ‚ãØ    }      formulae-sequence         œÜ    n  1      œÜ  n    n   1    2  normal-‚ãØ      \left\{\frac{\varphi(n+1)}{\varphi(n)},\;\;n=1,2,\cdots\right\}   is dense in the positive real numbers.

The valency or multiplicity of a totient number m is the number of solutions to this equation. 45 A nontotient is a natural number which is not a totient number: there are infinitely many nontotients, 46 and indeed every odd number has an even multiple which is a nontotient. 47  The number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is       x   log  x     exp   (    (   C  +   o   (  1  )     )     (   log   log   log  x     )   2    )          x    x          C    o  1     superscript        x     2       \frac{x}{\log x}\exp\left({(C+o(1))(\log\log\log x)^{2}}\right)   for a constant C = 0.8178146... . 48  If counted accordingly to multiplicity, the number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is       |   {  n  :    œï   (  n  )    ‚â§  x   }   |   =      Œ∂   (  2  )   Œ∂   (  3  )     Œ∂   (  6  )     ‚ãÖ  x   +   R   (  x  )            conditional-set  n      œï  n   x        normal-‚ãÖ      Œ∂  2  Œ∂  3     Œ∂  6    x     R  x      |\{n:\phi(n)\leq x\}|=\frac{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}{\zeta(6)}\cdot x+R(x)   where the error term R is of order at most    x  /    (   log  x   )   k       x   superscript    x   k     x/(\log x)^{k}   for any positive k . 49  It is known that the multiplicity of m exceeds m Œ¥ infinitely often for any Œ¥ S√°ndor et al (2006) p.21 50  Ford's theorem  proved that for every integer k ‚â•¬†2 there is a totient number m of multiplicity k : that is, for which the equation œÜ( n )¬†= m has exactly k solutions; this result had previously been conjectured by Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski , 51 and it had been obtained as a consequence of Schinzel's hypothesis H . 52 Indeed, each multiplicity that occurs, does so infinitely often. 53 54  However, no number m is known with multiplicity k =¬†1. Carmichael's totient function conjecture is the statement that there is no such m . 55  Applications  Cyclotomy  In the last section of the Disquisitiones 56 57 Gauss proves 58 that a regular n -gon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if œÜ( n ) is a power of 2. If n is a power of an odd prime number the formula for the totient says its totient can be a power of two only if a) n is a first power and b) n ‚àí¬†1 is a power of 2. The primes that are one more than a power of 2 are called Fermat primes , and only five are known: 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537. Fermat and Gauss knew of these. Nobody has been able to prove whether there are any more.  Thus, a regular n -gon has a straightedge-and-compass construction if n is a product of distinct Fermat primes and any power of 2. The first few such n are 59 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, ... .  The RSA cryptosystem  Setting up an RSA system involves choosing large prime numbers p and q , computing n = pq and k = œÜ( n ), and finding two numbers e and d such that ed ‚â° 1 (mod k ). The numbers n and e (the "encryption key") are released to the public, and d (the "decryption key") is kept private.  A message, represented by an integer m , where 0 e (mod n ).  It is decrypted by computing t = S d (mod n ). Euler's Theorem can be used to show that if 0 Ribenboim, pp. 36-37.  In 1933 he proved that if any such n exists, it must be odd, square-free, and divisible by at least seven primes (i.e. œâ( n ) ‚â• 7). In 1980 Cohen and Hagis proved that n > 10 20 and that œâ( n ) ‚â• 14. 60 Further, Hagis showed that if 3 divides n then n > 10 1937042 and œâ( n ) ‚â• 298848. 61 62  Carmichael's conjecture  This states that there is no number n with the property that for all other numbers m , m ‚â† n , œÜ( m ) ‚â† œÜ( n ). See Ford's theorem above.  As stated in the main article, if there is a single counterexample to this conjecture, there must be infinitely many counterexamples, and the smallest one has at least ten billion digits in base 10. 63  See also   Carmichael function  Duffin‚ÄìSchaeffer conjecture  Generalizations of Fermat's little theorem  Highly composite number  Multiplicative group of integers modulo n  Ramanujan sum   Notes  References  The Disquisitiones Arithmeticae has been translated from Latin into English and German.
