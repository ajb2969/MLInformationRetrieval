   Plücker's conoid      Plücker's conoid    In geometry , the Plücker’s conoid is a ruled surface named after the German mathematician Julius Plücker . It is also called a conical wedge or cylindroid ; however, the latter name is ambiguous, as "cylindroid" may also refer to an elliptic cylinder .  The Plücker’s conoid is defined by the function of two variables:       z  =    2  x  y     x  2   +   y  2      .      z      2  x  y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       z=\frac{2xy}{x^{2}+y^{2}}.     By using cylindrical coordinates in space, we can write the above function into parametric equations        x  =   v   cos  u     ,    y  =   v   sin  u     ,   z  =   sin   2  u       .     formulae-sequence    x    v    u      formulae-sequence    y    v    u       z      2  u        x=v\cos u,\quad y=v\sin u,\quad z=\sin 2u.     Thus the Plücker’s conoid is a right conoid , which can be obtained by rotating a horizontal line about the z-axis with the oscillatory motion (with period 2 π ) along the segment [−1, 1] of the axis (Figure 4).  A generalization of the Plücker’s conoid is given by the parametric equations        x  =   v   cos  u     ,    y  =   v   sin  u     ,   z  =   sin   n  u       .     formulae-sequence    x    v    u      formulae-sequence    y    v    u       z      n  u        x=v\cos u,\quad y=v\sin u,\quad z=\sin nu.     where n denotes the number of folds in the surface. The difference is that the period of the oscillatory motion along the z -axis is 2 π / n .
