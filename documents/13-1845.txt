Bateman function

In mathematics, the Bateman function (or k-function) kn is a special case of the confluent hypergeometric function studied by . Bateman defined it by
$$\displaystyle k_n(x) = \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi/2}\cos(x\tan\theta-n\theta) \, d\theta$$
This is not to be confused with another function of the same name which is used in Pharmacokinetics.
