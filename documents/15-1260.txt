23S rRNA (cytosine1962-C5)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (cytosine1962-C5)-methyltransferase (, RlmI, rRNA large subunit methyltransferase I, YccW) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (cytosine1962-C5)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine1962 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine1962 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates cytosine1962 at C5 in 23S rRNA.
