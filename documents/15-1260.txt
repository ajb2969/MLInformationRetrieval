   23S rRNA (cytosine1962-C5)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (cytosine1962-C5)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (cytosine 1962 -C 5 )-methyltransferase (, RlmI , rRNA large subunit methyltransferase I , YccW ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (cytosine 1962 -C 5 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 1962 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 1962 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates cytosine 1962 at C 5 in 23S rRNA.
