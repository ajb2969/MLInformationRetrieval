   N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate hydrolase      N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate hydrolase   In enzymology , a N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutarate + methylamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-oxoglutarate and methylamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-methyl-2-oxoglutaramate methylamidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate synthase .
