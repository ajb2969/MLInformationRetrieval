   Cobalt(II) nitrate      Cobalt(II) nitrate   Cobalt nitrate is the inorganic  cobalt (II) salt of nitric acid , often with various amounts of water. It is more commonly found as a hexahydrate , Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O, which is a red-brown deliquescent salt that is soluble in water and other polar solvents.  Preparation  Cobalt(II) nitrate is formed by the interaction of cobalt oxide, hydroxide or carbonate with nitric acid .

The various degrees of hydration can be summarised by the general chemical formula Co(NO 3 ) 2 · n H 2 O, where n = 0, 2, 4, 6.  Anhydrous cobalt(II) nitrate adopts a three-dimensional polymeric network structure, with each cobalt(II) atom approximately octahedrally coordinated by six oxygen atoms, each from a different nitrate ion. Each nitrate ion coordinates to three cobalts. 1 The dihydrate is a two-dimensional polymer, with nitrate bridges between Co(II) centres and hydrogen bonding holding the layers together. The tetrahydrate consists of discrete, octahedral [(H 2 O) 4 Co(NO 3 ) 2 ] molecules. The hexahydrate is better described as hexaaquacobalt(II) nitrate, [Co(OH 2 ) 6 ][NO 3 ] 2 , as it consists of discrete [Co(OH 2 ) 6 ] 2+ and [NO 3 ] − ions. 2     (Figure)  Cobalt(II)-nitrate-xtal-2002-CM-3D-SF.png   (Figure)  Cobalt(II)-nitrate-dihydrate-xtal-1976-CM-3D-balls.png   (Figure)  Cobalt(II)-nitrate-tetrahydrate-xtal-1975-CM-3D-balls.png   (Figure)  Hexaaquacobalt(II)-nitrate-xtal-1973-unit-cell-CM-3D-balls.png      Co(NO 3 ) 2    Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·2H 2 O    Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O    Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O      Uses  It is commonly reduced to metallic cobalt or precipitated on various substrates for Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. 3  Production  It is derived from reacting metallic cobalt or one of its oxides, hydroxides, or carbonate with nitric acid. It is commonly used in dyes and inks. 4   CoCO 3 + 2 HNO 3 + 5 H 2 O → Co(NO 3 ) 2 (H 2 O) 6 + CO 2    Above 55 °C, it dehydrates to the trihydrate and at higher temperatures to the monohydrate.
