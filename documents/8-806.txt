   Super star cluster      Super star cluster   A super star cluster ( SSC ) is a very massive young open cluster that is thought to be the precursor of a globular cluster . 1 They typically contain a very large number of young , massive stars that ionize a surrounding H II region , similar to our Milky Way 's so-called "Ultra dense H II regions (UDHIIs)". 2 An SSC's H II region is in turn surrounded by a cocoon of dust . In many cases, the stars and the H II regions will be invisible to optical observations due to high levels of extinction . As a result, the youngest SSCs are best observed in radio and infrared . 3  The unique characteristics of SSCs are their large electron  densities      n  e   =   10  3        subscript  n  e    superscript  10  3     n_{e}=10^{3}   –    10  6     superscript  10  6    10^{6}   cm      -  3        3     {}^{-3}   and pressures     P  /     fragments  P     P/        k  b     subscript  k  b    k_{b}         =   10  7       absent   superscript  10  7     =10^{7}   –    10  10     superscript  10  10    10^{10}    K cm      -  3        3     {}^{-3}   . 4  List      Name   Galaxy   Comments   Notes       Westerlund 1 (Wd1)   Milky Way Galaxy   First SSC discovered in our galaxy.   5     NGC 3603   Milky Way Galaxy    6     R136   Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)   The prototype SSC   7      NGC 1569   Galaxy contains two SSCs   8     References  External links   Monster Super Star Cluster Discovered In Milky Way   "  Category:Star clusters       ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
