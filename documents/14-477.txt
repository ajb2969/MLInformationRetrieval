   Kallman–Rota inequality      Kallman–Rota inequality   In mathematics, the Kallman–Rota inequality , introduced by , is a generalization of the Landau–Kolmogorov inequality to Banach spaces . It states that if A is the infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter contraction  semigroup then         ∥   A  f   ∥   2   ≤   4   ∥  f  ∥    ∥    A  2   f   ∥     .       superscript   norm    A  f    2     4   norm  f    norm     superscript  A  2   f       \|Af\|^{2}\leq 4\|f\|\|A^{2}f\|.\,     References    .
