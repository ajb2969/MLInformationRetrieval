   Fundamental theorems of welfare economics      Fundamental theorems of welfare economics   There are two fundamental theorems of welfare economics . The first states that any competitive equilibrium or Walrasian equilibrium leads to a Pareto efficient allocation of resources. The second states the converse, that any efficient allocation can be sustainable by a competitive equilibrium.  The first theorem is often taken to be an analytical confirmation of Adam Smith 's " invisible hand " hypothesis, namely that competitive markets tend toward an efficient allocation of resources . The theorem supports a case for non-intervention in ideal conditions: let the markets do the work and the outcome will be Pareto efficient. However, Pareto efficiency is not necessarily the same thing as desirability; it merely indicates that no one can be made better off without someone being made worse off. There can be many possible Pareto efficient allocations of resources and not all of them may be equally desirable by society. 1  The second theorem states that out of all possible Pareto-efficient outcomes, one can achieve any particular one by enacting a lump-sum wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over . This appears to make the case that intervention has a legitimate place in policy – redistributions can allow us to select from all efficient outcomes for one that has other desired features, such as distributional equity. The shortcoming is that for the theorem to hold, the transfers have to be lump-sum and the government needs to have perfect information on individual consumers' tastes as well as the production possibilities of firms. An additional mathematical condition is that preferences and production technologies have to be convex . 2  Because of welfare economics' close ties to social choice theory , Arrow's impossibility theorem is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem. 3  The ideal conditions of the theorems, however are an abstraction. The Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem , for example, states that in the presence of either imperfect information , or incomplete markets, markets are not Pareto efficient. Thus, in real world economies, the degree of these variations from ideal conditions must factor into policy choices. 4 Further, even if these ideal conditions hold, the First Welfare Theorem fails in an overlapping generations model .  Proof of the first fundamental theorem  The first fundamental theorem of welfare economics states that any Walrasian equilibrium is Pareto-efficient . This was first demonstrated graphically by economist Abba Lerner and mathematically by economists Harold Hotelling , Oskar Lange , Maurice Allais , Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu . The theorem holds under general conditions. 5  The theorem relies only on three assumptions: (1) complete markets (i.e., no transaction costs and where each actor has perfect information), (2) price-taking behavior (i.e., no monopolists and easy entry and exit from a market), and (3) the relatively weak assumption of local nonsatiation of preferences (i.e., for every bundle of goods there is another similar bundle that would be preferred). However, no convexity assumptions are needed. 6  The formal statement of the theorem is as follows: If preferences are locally nonsatiated, and if (x*, y*, p) is a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation (x*, y*) is Pareto optimal. An equilibrium in this sense either relates to an exchange economy only or presupposes that firms are allocatively and productively efficient, which can be shown to follow from perfectly competitive factor and production markets. 7  Suppose that consumer i has wealth    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   such that      Σ  i    w  i    =    p  ⋅  ω   +     Σ  j   p   ⋅   y  j  *            subscript  normal-Σ  i    subscript  w  i       normal-⋅  p  ω    normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  j   p    subscript   superscript  y    j       \Sigma_{i}w_{i}=p\cdot\omega+\Sigma_{j}p\cdot y^{*}_{j}   where   ω   ω   \omega   is the aggregate endowment of goods and    y  j  *     subscript   superscript  y    j    y^{*}_{j}   is the production of firm j .  Preference maximization (from the definition of price equilibrium with transfers) implies:    if     x  i    >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    subscript   superscript  x    i     x_{i}>_{i}x^{*}_{i}   then     p  ⋅   x  i    >   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}>w_{i}        In other words, if a bundle of goods is strictly preferred to    x  i  *     subscript   superscript  x    i    x^{*}_{i}   it must be unaffordable at price p . Local nonsatiation additionally implies:    if     x  i    ≥  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    subscript   superscript  x    i     x_{i}\geq_{i}x^{*}_{i}   then     p  ⋅   x  i    ≥   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}\geq w_{i}        To see why, imagine that     x  i    ≥  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    subscript   superscript  x    i     x_{i}\geq_{i}x^{*}_{i}   but     p  ⋅   x  i    <   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}   . Then by local nonsatiation we could find    x  i  ′     subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i    x^{\prime}_{i}   arbitrarily close to    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   (and so still affordable) but which is strictly preferred to    x  i  *     subscript   superscript  x    i    x^{*}_{i}   . But    x  i  *     subscript   superscript  x    i    x^{*}_{i}   is the result of preference maximization, so this is a contradiction.  Now consider an allocation    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   that Pareto dominates    (   x  *   ,   y  *   )      superscript  x     superscript  y      (x^{*},y^{*})   . This means that     x  i    ≥  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    subscript   superscript  x    i     x_{i}\geq_{i}x^{*}_{i}   for all i and     x  i    >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    subscript   superscript  x    i     x_{i}>_{i}x^{*}_{i}   for some i . By the above, we know     p  ⋅   x  i    ≥   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}\geq w_{i}   for all i and     p  ⋅   x  i    >   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}>w_{i}   for some i . Summing, we find:           Σ  i   p   ⋅   x  i    >    Σ  i    w  i    =    p  ⋅  ω   +     Σ  j   p   ⋅   y  j  *            normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  i   p    subscript  x  i       subscript  normal-Σ  i    subscript  w  i            normal-⋅  p  ω    normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  j   p    subscript   superscript  y    j        \Sigma_{i}p\cdot x_{i}>\Sigma_{i}w_{i}=p\cdot\omega+\Sigma_{j}p\cdot y^{*}_{j}        Because    y  *     superscript  y     y^{*}   is profit maximizing, we know       Σ  j   p   ⋅   y  j  *    ≥     Σ  j   p   ⋅   y  j         normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  j   p    subscript   superscript  y    j     normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  j   p    subscript  y  j      \Sigma_{j}p\cdot y^{*}_{j}\geq\Sigma_{j}p\cdot y_{j}   , so       Σ  i   p   ⋅   x  i    >    p  ⋅  ω   +     Σ  j   p   ⋅   y  j          normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  i   p    subscript  x  i       normal-⋅  p  ω    normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  j   p    subscript  y  j       \Sigma_{i}p\cdot x_{i}>p\cdot\omega+\Sigma_{j}p\cdot y_{j}   . Hence,    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   is not feasible. Since all Pareto-dominating allocations are not feasible,    (   x  *   ,   y  *   )      superscript  x     superscript  y      (x^{*},y^{*})   must itself be Pareto optimal. 8  Proof of the second fundamental theorem  The second fundamental theorem of welfare economics states that, under the assumptions that every production set    Y  j     subscript  Y  j    Y_{j}   is convex and every preference relation    ≥  i     subscript   i    \geq_{i}   is convex and locally nonsatiated , any desired Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi -equilibrium with transfers. 9 Further assumptions are needed to prove this statement for price equilibriums with transfers.  The proof proceeds in two steps: first, we prove that any Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers; then, we give conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium.  Let us define a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers as an allocation    (   x  *   ,   y  *   )      superscript  x     superscript  y      (x^{*},y^{*})   , a price vector p , and a vector of wealth levels w (achieved by lump-sum transfers) with      Σ  i    w  i    =    p  ⋅  ω   +     Σ  j   p   ⋅   y  j  *            subscript  normal-Σ  i    subscript  w  i       normal-⋅  p  ω    normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Σ  j   p    subscript   superscript  y    j       \Sigma_{i}w_{i}=p\cdot\omega+\Sigma_{j}p\cdot y^{*}_{j}   (where   ω   ω   \omega   is the aggregate endowment of goods and    y  j  *     subscript   superscript  y    j    y^{*}_{j}   is the production of firm j ) such that:    i.     p  ⋅   y  j    ≤   p  ⋅   y  j  *         normal-⋅  p   subscript  y  j     normal-⋅  p   superscript   subscript  y  j        p\cdot y_{j}\leq p\cdot y_{j}^{*}   for all     y  j   ∈   Y  j        subscript  y  j    subscript  Y  j     y_{j}\in Y_{j}   (firms maximize profit by producing    y  j  *     superscript   subscript  y  j      y_{j}^{*}   )  ii. For all i , if     x  i    >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       x_{i}>_{i}x_{i}^{*}   then     p  ⋅   x  i    ≥   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}\geq w_{i}   (if    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is strictly preferred to    x  i  *     superscript   subscript  x  i      x_{i}^{*}   then it cannot cost less than    x  i  *     superscript   subscript  x  i      x_{i}^{*}   )  iii.      Σ  i    x  i  *    =   ω  +    Σ  j    y  j  *            subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i        ω     subscript  normal-Σ  j    superscript   subscript  y  j         \Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*}=\omega+\Sigma_{j}y_{j}^{*}   (budget constraint satisfied)     The only difference between this definition and the standard definition of a price equilibrium with transfers is in statement ( ii ). The inequality is weak here (     p  ⋅   x  i    ≥   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}\geq w_{i}   ) making it a price quasi-equilibrium. Later we will strengthen this to make a price equilibrium. 10 Define    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   to be the set of all consumption bundles strictly preferred to    x  i  *     superscript   subscript  x  i      x_{i}^{*}   by consumer i , and let V be the sum of all    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   .    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   is convex due to the convexity of the preference relation    ≥  i     subscript   i    \geq_{i}   . V is convex because every    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   is convex. Similarly    Y  +   {  ω  }       Y   ω     Y+\{\omega\}   , the union of all production sets    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   plus the aggregate endowment, is convex because every    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   is convex. We also know that the intersection of V and    Y  +   {  ω  }       Y   ω     Y+\{\omega\}   must be empty, because if it were not it would imply there existed a bundle that is strictly preferred to    (   x  *   ,   y  *   )      superscript  x     superscript  y      (x^{*},y^{*})   by everyone and is also affordable. This is ruled out by the Pareto-optimality of    (   x  *   ,   y  *   )      superscript  x     superscript  y      (x^{*},y^{*})   .  These two convex, non-intersecting sets allow us to apply the separating hyperplane theorem . This theorem states that there exists a price vector    p  ≠  0      p  0    p\neq 0   and a number r such that     p  ⋅  z   ≥  r       normal-⋅  p  z   r    p\cdot z\geq r   for every    z  ∈  V      z  V    z\in V   and     p  ⋅  z   ≤  r       normal-⋅  p  z   r    p\cdot z\leq r   for every    z  ∈   Y  +   {  ω  }        z    Y   ω      z\in Y+\{\omega\}   . In other words, there exists a price vector that defines a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two convex sets.  Next we argue that if     x  i    ≥  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       x_{i}\geq_{i}x_{i}^{*}   for all i then     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i    )    ≥  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    subscript  x  i     r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x_{i})\geq r   . This is due to local nonsatiation: there must be a bundle    x  i  ′     subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i    x^{\prime}_{i}   arbitrarily close to    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   that is strictly preferred to    x  i  *     superscript   subscript  x  i      x_{i}^{*}   and hence part of    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   , so     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i  ′    )    ≥  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i     r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x^{\prime}_{i})\geq r   . Taking the limit as     x  i  ′   →   x  i      normal-→   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i    subscript  x  i     x^{\prime}_{i}\rightarrow x_{i}   does not change the weak inequality, so     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i    )    ≥  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    subscript  x  i     r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x_{i})\geq r   as well. In other words,    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is in the closure of V .  Using this relation we see that for    x  i  *     superscript   subscript  x  i      x_{i}^{*}   itself     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i  *    )    ≥  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*})\geq r   . We also know that      Σ  i    x  i  *    ∈   Y  +   {  ω  }           subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i        Y   ω      \Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*}\in Y+\{\omega\}   , so     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i  *    )    ≤  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*})\leq r   as well. Combining these we find that     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i  *    )    =  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*})=r   . We can use this equation to show that    (   x  *   ,   y  *   ,  p  )      superscript  x     superscript  y    p    (x^{*},y^{*},p)   fits the definition of a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers.  Because     p  ⋅   (    Σ  i    x  i  *    )    =  r       normal-⋅  p     subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       r    p\cdot(\Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*})=r   and      Σ  i    x  i  *    =   ω  +    Σ  j    y  j  *            subscript  normal-Σ  i    superscript   subscript  x  i        ω     subscript  normal-Σ  j    superscript   subscript  y  j         \Sigma_{i}x_{i}^{*}=\omega+\Sigma_{j}y_{j}^{*}   we know that for any firm j:         p  ⋅   (   ω  +   y  j   +    Σ  h    y  h  *     )    ≤  r  =   p  ⋅   (   ω  +   y  j  *   +    Σ  h    y  h  *     )           normal-⋅  p    ω   subscript  y  j      subscript  normal-Σ  h    superscript   subscript  y  h        r        normal-⋅  p    ω   superscript   subscript  y  j        subscript  normal-Σ  h    superscript   subscript  y  h           p\cdot(\omega+y_{j}+\Sigma_{h}y_{h}^{*})\leq r=p\cdot(\omega+y_{j}^{*}+\Sigma_%
 {h}y_{h}^{*})   for    h  ≠  j      h  j    h\neq j        which implies     p  ⋅   y  j    ≤   p  ⋅   y  j  *         normal-⋅  p   subscript  y  j     normal-⋅  p   superscript   subscript  y  j        p\cdot y_{j}\leq p\cdot y_{j}^{*}   . Similarly we know:         p  ⋅   (    x  i   +    Σ  k    x  k  *     )    ≥  r  =   p  ⋅   (    x  i  *   +    Σ  k    x  k  *     )           normal-⋅  p     subscript  x  i      subscript  normal-Σ  k    superscript   subscript  x  k        r        normal-⋅  p     superscript   subscript  x  i        subscript  normal-Σ  k    superscript   subscript  x  k           p\cdot(x_{i}+\Sigma_{k}x_{k}^{*})\geq r=p\cdot(x_{i}^{*}+\Sigma_{k}x_{k}^{*})   for    k  ≠  i      k  i    k\neq i        which implies     p  ⋅   x  i    ≥   p  ⋅   x  i  *         normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     normal-⋅  p   superscript   subscript  x  i        p\cdot x_{i}\geq p\cdot x_{i}^{*}   . These two statements, along with the feasibility of the allocation at the Pareto optimum, satisfy the three conditions for a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers supported by wealth levels     w  i   =   p  ⋅   x  i  *         subscript  w  i    normal-⋅  p   superscript   subscript  x  i        w_{i}=p\cdot x_{i}^{*}   for all i .  We now turn to conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium, in other words, conditions under which the statement "if     x  i    >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       x_{i}>_{i}x_{i}^{*}   then     p  ⋅   x  i    ≥   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}\geq w_{i}   " imples "if     x  i    >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       x_{i}>_{i}x_{i}^{*}   then     p  ⋅   x  i    >   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}>w_{i}   ". For this to be true we need now to assume that the consumption set    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   is convex and the preference relation    ≥  i     subscript   i    \geq_{i}   is continuous . Then, if there exists a consumption vector    x  i  ′     subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i    x^{\prime}_{i}   such that     x  i  ′   ∈   X  i        subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i    subscript  X  i     x^{\prime}_{i}\in X_{i}   and     p  ⋅   x  i  ′    <   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x^{\prime}_{i}   , a price quasi-equilibrium is a price equilibrium.  To see why, assume to the contrary     x  i    >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i    subscript  x  i    superscript   subscript  x  i       x_{i}>_{i}x_{i}^{*}   and     p  ⋅   x  i    =   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript  x  i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x_{i}=w_{i}   , and    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   exists. Then by the convexity of    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   we have a bundle     x  i  ′′   =    α   x  i    +    (   1  -  α   )    x  i  ′     ∈   X  i          subscript   superscript  x  ′′   i       α   subscript  x  i        1  α    subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i           subscript  X  i      x^{\prime\prime}_{i}=\alpha x_{i}+(1-\alpha)x^{\prime}_{i}\in X_{i}   with     p  ⋅   x  i  ′′    <   w  i        normal-⋅  p   subscript   superscript  x  ′′   i     subscript  w  i     p\cdot x^{\prime\prime}_{i}   . By the continuity of    ≥  i     subscript   i    \geq_{i}   for   α   α   \alpha   close to 1 we have      α   x  i    +    (   1  -  α   )    x  i  ′      >  i    x  i  *       subscript   i       α   subscript  x  i        1  α    subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i      superscript   subscript  x  i       \alpha x_{i}+(1-\alpha)x^{\prime}_{i}>_{i}x_{i}^{*}   . This is a contradiction, because this bundle is preferred to    x  i  *     superscript   subscript  x  i      x_{i}^{*}   and costs less than    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   .  Hence, for price quasi-equilibria to be price equilibria it is sufficient that the consumption set be convex, the preference relation to be continuous, and for there always to exist a "cheaper" consumption bundle    x  i  ′     subscript   superscript  x  normal-′   i    x^{\prime}_{i}   . One way to ensure the existence of such a bundle is to require wealth levels    w  i     subscript  w  i    w_{i}   to be strictly positive for all consumers i . 11  See also   Convex preferences   References  "  Category:Economics theorems  Welfare economics  Category:General equilibrium and disequilibrium  Category:Mathematical economics  Category:Welfare economics     ↩  ↩  * ↩  ↩
