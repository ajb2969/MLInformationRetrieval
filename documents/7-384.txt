   Fluoroantimonic acid      Fluoroantimonic acid   Fluoroantimonic acid (systematically named fluoranium hexafluorostibanuide and fluoranium hexafluoridoantimonate(1−) ) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). It is an ionic liquid created by reacting hydrogen fluoride (HF) with antimony pentafluoride (SbF 5 ) in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. It is the strongest known superacid , which has been demonstrated to protonate even hydrocarbons to afford carbocations and H 2 . 1 Similar acids can be created by using excess antimony pentafluoride. 2  The reaction to produce fluoroantimonic acid is:   2 HF   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   H 2 F + + F −   SbF 5 + F − → SbF 6 −    The overall reaction is:   SbF 5 + 2 HF → SbF 6 − + H 2 F +    The second reaction is not in equilibrium, therefore the overall reaction is not in equilibrium. The reaction is exothermic.  The F − , produced by autoionization of hydrogen fluoride, reacts with SbF 5 to yield the adduct SbF 6 − . In the fluoronium ion, hydrogen fluoride is coordinated to the hydrogen ion. The anion is classified as noncoordinating and is both a very weak nucleophile and a very weak base .  The acid is often said to contain " naked protons ", but the "free" protons are, in fact, always bonded to hydrogen fluoride molecules to make the fluoronium cations (similar to the hydronium cation in aqueous solution). 3 It is the fluoronium ion that accounts for fluoroantomonic acid's extreme acidity. Fluoroantimonic acid is 10 16 (10 quadrillion) times stronger than 100% sulfuric acid . 4 The protons easily migrate through the solution, moving from H 2 F + to HF, when present, by the Grotthuss mechanism :   H 2 F + + HF   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   HF + H 2 F +    Fluoroantimonic acid thermally decomposes at higher temperatures, generating hydrogen fluoride gas.  Structure  Two related products have been crystallised from HF-SbF 5 mixtures, and both have been analyzed by single crystal X-ray crystallography . These salts have the formulas [H 2 F + ][Sb 2 F 11 − ] and [H 3 F 2 + ][Sb 2 F 11 − ]. In both salts, the anion is Sb 2 F 11 − . 5 As mentioned above, SbF 6 − is weakly basic; the larger anion Sb 2 F 11 − is expected to be still weaker.  The following values are based upon the Hammett acidity function . Increased acidity is indicated by smaller (in this case, more negative) values of H 0 .

In 1967, Bickel and Hogeveen showed that HF-SbF 5 will remove H 2 from isobutane and methane from neopentane : 6 7   (CH 3 ) 3 CH + H + → (CH 3 ) 3 C + + H 2   (CH 3 ) 4 C + H + → (CH 3 ) 3 C + + CH 4    Materials compatible with fluoroantimonic acid as a solvent include SO 2 ClF , and sulfur dioxide ; some chlorofluorocarbons have also been used. Containers for HF-SbF 5 are made of PTFE .  Safety  HF-SbF 5 is extremely corrosive, toxic, and moisture sensitive. 8 Like most strong acids, fluoroantimonic acid can react violently with water, owing to the exothermic hydration.
