   Tübingen triangle      Tübingen triangle     The Tübingen triangle is, apart from the Penrose rhomb tilings and their variations, a classical candidate to model 5-fold (respectively 10-fold) quasicrystals . The inflation factor is – as in the Penrose case – the golden mean,    φ  =   a  b   =    1  +   5    2   ≈  1.618.        φ    a  b            1    5    2        1.618.     \varphi=\frac{a}{b}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 1.618.     The prototiles are Robinson triangles , but the relation is different: The Penrose rhomb tilings are locally derivable from the Tübingen triangle tilings.  These tilings were discovered and studied thoroughly by a group in Tübingen , Germany, thus the name. 1  Since the prototiles are mirror symmetric, but their substitutions are not, left-handed and right-handed tiles need to be distinguished. This is indicated by the colours in the substitution rule and in the patches of the relevant figures. 2  References    "  Category:Tübingen  Category:Discrete geometry  Category:Aperiodic tilings  Category:Mathematics and art     Baake, M and Kramer, P and Schlottmann, M and Zeidler, D Planar patterns with fivefold symmetry as sections of periodic structures in 4-space Internat.
