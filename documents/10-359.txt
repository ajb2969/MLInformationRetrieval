   Partial current      Partial current   In electrochemistry , partial current is defined as the electric current associated with ( anodic or cathodic ) half of the electrode  reaction .  Depending on the electrode half-reaction, one can distinguish two types of partial current:   cathodic partial current  I c (called also cathodic current ): is the flow of electrons from the electrode surface to a species in solution;  anodic partial current  I a (called also anodic current ): is the flow of electrons into the electrode from a species in solution.   The cathodic and anodic partial currents are defined by IUPAC . 1  The partial current densities ( i c and i a ) are the ratios of partial currents respect to the electrode areas ( A c and A a ):   i c = I c /A c   i a = I a /A a    The sum of the cathodic partial current density i c (positive) and the anodic partial current density i a (negative) gives the net current density  i : 2   i = i c + i a    In the case of the cathodic partial current density are equal to the anodic partial current density (for example, in a corrosion process 3 ), the net current density on the electrode is zero: 4   i eq = i c,eq + i a,eq = 0    When more than one reaction occur on an electrode simultaneously, then the total electrode current can be expressed as: 5      I  =    Σ   I   a  ,  i     +   Σ   I   c  ,  i          I      normal-Σ   subscript  I   a  i       normal-Σ   subscript  I   c  i        I=\Sigma I_{a,i}+\Sigma I_{c,i}     where the index i refers to the particular reactions.
