Finite character

In mathematics, a family

 
  of sets is of finite character provided it has the following properties:

For each 
 
 
 
 , every finite subset of 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
 
 .
If every finite subset of a given set 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
 .

Properties
A family 
 
 
 
 
  of sets of finite character enjoys the following properties:

For each 
 
 
 
 , every (finite or infinite) subset of 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
 .
Tukey's lemma: In 
 
 
 
 , partially ordered by inclusion, the union of every chain of elements of 
 
 
 
 
  also belong to 
 
 
 
 , therefore, by Zorn's lemma, 
 
 
 
  contains at least one maximal element.

Example
Let V be a vector space, and let F be the family of linearly independent subsets of V. Then F is a family of finite character (because a subset X âŠ† V is linearly dependent iff X has a finite subset which is linearly dependent). Therefore, in every vector space, there exists a maximal family of linearly independent elements. As a maximal family is a vector basis, every vector space has a (possibly infinite) vector basis.
