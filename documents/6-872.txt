   Finite character      Finite character   In mathematics, a family    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of sets is of finite character provided it has the following properties:   For each    A  ∈  ℱ      A  ℱ    A\in\mathcal{F}   , every finite  subset of   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  If every finite subset of a given set   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , then   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .   Properties  A family   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of sets of finite character enjoys the following properties:   For each    A  ∈  ℱ      A  ℱ    A\in\mathcal{F}   , every (finite or infinite) subset of   A   A   A   belongs to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  Tukey's lemma : In   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , partially ordered by inclusion, the union of every chain of elements of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   also belong to   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , therefore, by Zorn's lemma ,   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   contains at least one maximal element.   Example  Let V be a vector space , and let F be the family of linearly independent subsets of V . Then F is a family of finite character (because a subset X ⊆ V is linearly dependent iff X has a finite subset which is linearly dependent). Therefore, in every vector space , there exists a maximal family of linearly independent elements. As a maximal family is a vector basis , every vector space has a (possibly infinite) vector basis.
