2-Deoxystreptamine N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase

2-deoxystreptamine N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase (, btrM (gene), neoD (gene), kanF (gene)) is an enzyme with system name UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine:2-deoxystreptamine N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine + 2-deoxystreptamine

 
  UDP + 2'-N-acetylparomamine
 

Involved in the biosynthetic pathways of several clinically important aminocyclitol antibiotics.
