Groupoid algebra

In mathematics, the concept of groupoid algebra generalizes the notion of group algebra.1
Definition
Given a groupoid

 
  and a field

 
 , it is possible to define the groupoid algebra 
 
 
 
  as the algebra over 
 
 
 
 
  formed by the vector space having the elements of 
 
 
 
  as generators and having the multiplication of these elements defined by 
 
 
 
 , whenever this product is defined, and 
 
 
 
  otherwise. The product is then extended by linearity.2
Examples
Some examples of groupoid algebras are the following:3

Group algebras
Matrix algebras
Algebras of functions

Properties

When a groupoid has a finite number of objects and a finite number of morphisms, the groupoid algebra is a direct sum of tensor products of group algebras and matrix algebras.4
