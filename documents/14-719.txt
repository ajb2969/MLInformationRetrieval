   Groupoid algebra      Groupoid algebra   In mathematics , the concept of groupoid algebra generalizes the notion of group algebra . 1  Definition  Given a groupoid     (  G  ,  ⋅  )     G  normal-⋅    (G,\cdot)   and a field    K   K   K   , it is possible to define the groupoid algebra    K  G      K  G    KG   as the algebra over   K   K   K   formed by the vector space having the elements of   G   G   G   as generators and having the multiplication of these elements defined by     g  *  h   =   g  ⋅  h         g  h    normal-⋅  g  h     g*h=g\cdot h   , whenever this product is defined, and     g  *  h   =  0        g  h   0    g*h=0   otherwise. The product is then extended by linearity . 2  Examples  Some examples of groupoid algebras are the following: 3   Group algebras  Matrix algebras  Algebras of functions   Properties   When a groupoid has a finite number of objects and a finite number of morphisms , the groupoid algebra is a direct sum of tensor products of group algebras and matrix algebras. 4   See also   Hopf algebra  Partial group algebra   Notes    References        "  Category:Algebra     Khalkhali (2009), [ p. 48] ↩  Dokuchaev, Exel & Piccione (2000), p. 7 ↩  da Silva & Weinstein (1999), [ p. 97] ↩  Khalkhali & Marcolli (2008), [ p. 210] ↩
