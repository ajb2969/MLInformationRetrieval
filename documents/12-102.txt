   Spatial acceleration      Spatial acceleration   In physics the study of rigid body motion provides for several ways of defining the acceleration state of a rigid body. The classical definition of acceleration entails following a single particle/point along the rigid body and observing its changes of velocity . In this article the notion of spatial acceleration is explored, which entails looking at a fixed (unmoving) point in space and observing the changes of velocity of whatever particle/point happens to coincide with the observation point. This is similar to the acceleration definition fluid dynamics where typically one can measure velocity and/or accelerations on a fixed locate inside a testing apparatus.  Definition  Consider a moving rigid body and the velocity of a particle/point P along the body being a function of the position and velocity of a center particle/point C and the angular velocity    ω  →     normal-→  ω    \vec{\omega}   .  The linear velocity vector     v  →   P     subscript   normal-→  v   P    \vec{v}_{P}   at P is expressed in terms of the velocity vector     v  →   C     subscript   normal-→  v   C    \vec{v}_{C}   at C as:        v  →   P   =     v  →   C   +    ω  →   ×   (     r  →   P   -    r  →   C    )          subscript   normal-→  v   P      subscript   normal-→  v   C      normal-→  ω      subscript   normal-→  r   P    subscript   normal-→  r   C        \vec{v}_{P}=\vec{v}_{C}+\vec{\omega}\times(\vec{r}_{P}-\vec{r}_{C})     where    ω  →     normal-→  ω    \vec{\omega}   is the angular velocity vector.  The material acceleration at P is:        a  →   P   =    d    v  →   P     d  t         subscript   normal-→  a   P       normal-d   subscript   normal-→  v   P      normal-d  t      \vec{a}_{P}=\frac{{\rm d}\vec{v}_{P}}{{\rm d}t}         a  →   P   =     a  →   C   +    α  →   ×   (     r  →   P   -    r  →   C    )    +    ω  →   ×   (     v  →   P   -    v  →   C    )          subscript   normal-→  a   P      subscript   normal-→  a   C      normal-→  α      subscript   normal-→  r   P    subscript   normal-→  r   C        normal-→  ω      subscript   normal-→  v   P    subscript   normal-→  v   C        \vec{a}_{P}=\vec{a}_{C}+\vec{\alpha}\times(\vec{r}_{P}-\vec{r}_{C})+\vec{%
 \omega}\times(\vec{v}_{P}-\vec{v}_{C})     where    α  →     normal-→  α    \vec{\alpha}   is the angular acceleration vector.  The spatial acceleration     ψ  →   P     subscript   normal-→  ψ   P    \vec{\psi}_{P}   at P is expressed in terms of the spatial acceleration     ψ  →   C     subscript   normal-→  ψ   C    \vec{\psi}_{C}   at C as:        ψ  →   P   =    ∂    v  →   P     ∂  t         subscript   normal-→  ψ   P        subscript   normal-→  v   P      t      \vec{\psi}_{P}=\frac{\partial\vec{v}_{P}}{\partial t}         ψ  →   P   =     ψ  →   C   +    α  →   ×   (     r  →   P   -    r  →   C    )          subscript   normal-→  ψ   P      subscript   normal-→  ψ   C      normal-→  α      subscript   normal-→  r   P    subscript   normal-→  r   C        \vec{\psi}_{P}=\vec{\psi}_{C}+\vec{\alpha}\times(\vec{r}_{P}-\vec{r}_{C})     which is similar to the velocity transformation above.  In general the spatial acceleration     ψ  →   P     subscript   normal-→  ψ   P    \vec{\psi}_{P}   of a particle point P that is moving with linear velocity     v  →   P     subscript   normal-→  v   P    \vec{v}_{P}   is derived from the material acceleration     a  →   P     subscript   normal-→  a   P    \vec{a}_{P}   at P as:        ψ  →   P   =     a  →   P   -    ω  →   ×    v  →   P          subscript   normal-→  ψ   P      subscript   normal-→  a   P      normal-→  ω    subscript   normal-→  v   P       \vec{\psi}_{P}=\vec{a}_{P}-\vec{\omega}\times\vec{v}_{P}     References    .   .
