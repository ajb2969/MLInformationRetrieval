   Von Kármán constant      Von Kármán constant   In fluid dynamics , the von Kármán constant (or Kármán constant ), named for Theodore von Kármán , is a dimensionless constant describing the logarithmic velocity profile of a turbulent fluid flow near a boundary with a no-slip condition . The equation for such boundary layer flow profiles is:       u  =     u  ⋆   κ    ln   z   z  0       ,      u       subscript  u  normal-⋆   κ       z   subscript  z  0        u=\frac{u_{\star}}{\kappa}\ln\frac{z}{z_{0}},     where u is the mean flow velocity at height z above the boundary. The roughness height (also known as roughness length ) z 0 is where   u   u   u   appears to go to zero. Further κ is the von Kármán constant being typically 0.41, and    u  ⋆     subscript  u  normal-⋆    u_{\star}   is the friction velocity which depends on the shear stress  τ w at the boundary of the flow:        u  ⋆   =     τ  w   ρ     ,       subscript  u  normal-⋆        subscript  τ  w   ρ      u_{\star}=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{w}}{\rho}},     with ρ the fluid density .  The Kármán constant is often used in turbulence modeling , for instance in boundary-layer meteorology to calculate fluxes of momentum , heat and moisture from the atmosphere to the land surface. It is considered to be a universal ( κ = 0.41).  Gaudio, Miglio and Dey argued that the Kármán constant is however nonuniversal in flows over mobile sediment beds.
