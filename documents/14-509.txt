   Eisenbud‚ÄìLevine‚ÄìKhimshiashvili signature formula      Eisenbud‚ÄìLevine‚ÄìKhimshiashvili signature formula  In mathematics, and especially [[differential topology]] and [[singularity theory]], the '''[[D. Eisenbud|Eisenbud]]‚ÄìLevine‚ÄìKhimshiashvili signature formula''' gives a way of computing the Poincar√©-Hopf [[Index of a vector field|index]] of a [[real valued function|real]], [[Analytic function|analytic]] [[vector field]] at an algebraically isolated singularity. 1 It is named after David Eisenbud , Harold Levine , and George Khimshiashvili . Intuitively, the index of a vector field near a zero is the number of times the vector field wraps around the sphere. Because analytic vector fields have a rich algebraic structure, the techniques of commutative algebra can be brought to bear to compute their index. The signature formula expresses the index of an analytic vector field in terms of the signature of a certain quadratic form .  Nomenclature  Consider the n -dimensional space  R n . Assume that R n has some fixed coordinate system , and write x for a point in R n , where  Let X be a vector field on R n . For  there exist functions  such that one may express X as       X  =     f  1    (  ùï©  )    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   x  1      +  ‚ãØ  +    f  n    (  ùï©  )    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   x  n        .      X       subscript  f  1   ùï©        subscript  x  1      normal-‚ãØ     subscript  f  n   ùï©        subscript  x  n         X=f_{1}({\mathbb{x}})\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}+\cdots+f_{n}({\mathbb{x%
 }})\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}}.     To say that X is an analytic vector field means that each of the functions is an analytic function . One says that X is singular at a point p in R n (or that p is a singular point of X ) if , i.e. X vanishes at p . In terms of the functions it means that for all . A singular point p of X is called isolated (or that p is an isolated singularity of X ) if  and there exists an open neighbourhood  , containing p , such that  for all q in U , different from p . An isolated singularity of X is called algebraically isolated if, when considered over the complex domain , it remains isolated. 2 3  Since the Poincar√©-Hopf index at a point is a purely local invariant (cf. Poincar√©-Hopf theorem ), one may restrict one's study to that of germs . Assume that each of the ∆í k from above are function germs , i.e. In turn, one may call X a vector field germ .  Construction  Let A n ,0 denote the ring of analytic function germs . Assume that X is a vector field germ of the form      X  =     f  1    (  ùï©  )    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   x  1      +  ‚ãØ  +    f  n    (  ùï©  )    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ   x  n           X       subscript  f  1   ùï©        subscript  x  1      normal-‚ãØ     subscript  f  n   ùï©        subscript  x  n         X=f_{1}({\mathbb{x}})\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}+\cdots+f_{n}({\mathbb{x%
 }})\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}}   with an algebraicially isolated singularity at 0. Where, as mentioned above, each of the ∆í k are function germs . Denote by ''I X'' the ideal generated by the ∆í k , i.e. Then one considers the local algebra , ''B X'' , given by the quotient        B  X   :=    A   n  ,  0    /    I  X      .     assign   subscript  B  X      subscript  A   n  0     subscript  I  X      B_{X}:=A_{n,0}/I_{X}\,.     The Eisenbud‚ÄìLevine‚ÄìKhimshiashvili signature formula gives the index of the vector field X , at 0, by assigning a non-degenerate bilinear form on the local algebra ''B X'' . The signature of this non-degenerate bilinear form being equal to the index of X . 4 5 6  The dimension of ''B X'' is finite if and only if the complexification of X has an isolated singularity at 0 in C n ; i.e. X has an algebraically isolated singularity at 0 in R n . 7 In this case, ''B X'' will be a finite-dimensional, real algebra .  Definition of the bilinear form  Using the analytic components of X , one defines another analytic germ given by        F   (  ùï©  )    :=   (    f  1    (  ùï©  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,    f  n    (  ùï©  )    )    ,     assign    F  ùï©       subscript  f  1   ùï©   normal-‚Ä¶     subscript  f  n   ùï©      F({\mathbb{x}}):=(f_{1}({\mathbb{x}}),\ldots,f_{n}({\mathbb{x}})),   for all . Let denote the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of F with respect to the basis Finally, let denote the equivalence class of J F , modulo ''I X'' . Using ‚àó to denote multiplication in ''B X'' one is able to define a non-degenerate bilinear form Œ≤ as follows: 8 9      Œ≤  :   B  X   √ó   B  X    ‚ü∂  *    B  X    ‚ü∂  ‚Ñì    \R   ;  Œ≤   (  g  ,  h  )   =  ‚Ñì   (  g  *  h  )   ,     fragments  Œ≤  normal-:   subscript  B  X     subscript  B  X    superscript  normal-‚ü∂     subscript  B  X    superscript  normal-‚ü∂  normal-‚Ñì   \R  normal-;  Œ≤   fragments  normal-(  g  normal-,  h  normal-)    ‚Ñì   fragments  normal-(  g   h  normal-)   normal-,    \beta:B_{X}\times B_{X}\stackrel{*}{\longrightarrow}B_{X}\stackrel{\ell}{%
 \longrightarrow}\R;\ \ \beta(g,h)=\ell(g*h),   where   ‚Ñì   normal-‚Ñì   \scriptstyle\ell   is any linear function such that       ‚Ñì   (   [   J  F   ]   )    >  0.        normal-‚Ñì   delimited-[]   subscript  J  F     0.    \ell\left(\left[J_{F}\right]\right)>0.   As mentioned: the signature of Œ≤ is exactly the signature of X at 0.  Example  Consider the case  of a vector field on the plane. Consider the case where X is given by       X  :=     (    x  3   -   3  x   y  2     )    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ  x     +    (    3   x  2   y   -   y  3    )    ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ  y       .     assign  X         superscript  x  3     3  x   superscript  y  2          x           3   superscript  x  2   y    superscript  y  3         y        X:=(x^{3}-3xy^{2})\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+(3x^{2}y-y^{3})\,\frac{%
 \partial}{\partial y}.   Clearly X has an algebraically isolated singularity at 0 since  if and only if  The ideal ''I X'' is given by and        B  X   =    A   2  ,  0    /   (    x  3   -   3  x   y  2     ,    3   x  2   y   -   y  3    )    ‚âÖ    \R    ‚ü®  1  ,  x  ,  y  ,   x  2   ,   x  y   ,   y  2   ,   x   y  2    ,   y  3   ,   y  4   ‚ü©     .         subscript  B  X      subscript  A   2  0        superscript  x  3     3  x   superscript  y  2         3   superscript  x  2   y    superscript  y  3             \R   1  x  y   superscript  x  2     x  y    superscript  y  2     x   superscript  y  2     superscript  y  3    superscript  y  4        B_{X}=A_{2,0}/(x^{3}-3xy^{2},3x^{2}y-y^{3})\cong\R\langle 1,x,y,x^{2},xy,y^{2}%
 ,xy^{2},y^{3},y^{4}\rangle.     The first step for finding the non-degenerate, bilinear form Œ≤ is to calculate the multiplication table of ''B X'' ; reducing each entry modulo ''I X'' .

One may take        ‚Ñì   (  1  )    =   ‚Ñì   (  x  )    =   ‚Ñì   (  y  )    =   ‚Ñì   (   x  2   )    =   ‚Ñì   (   x  y   )    =   ‚Ñì   (   y  2   )    =   ‚Ñì   (   x   y  2    )    =   ‚Ñì   (   y  3   )    =  0   ,     and   ‚Ñì   (   y  4   )    =  3.      formulae-sequence        normal-‚Ñì  1     normal-‚Ñì  x          normal-‚Ñì  y          normal-‚Ñì   superscript  x  2           normal-‚Ñì    x  y           normal-‚Ñì   superscript  y  2           normal-‚Ñì    x   superscript  y  2            normal-‚Ñì   superscript  y  3         0        and  normal-‚Ñì   superscript  y  4    3.     \ell(1)=\ell(x)=\ell(y)=\ell(x^{2})=\ell(xy)=\ell(y^{2})=\ell(xy^{2})=\ell(y^{%
 3})=0,\ \text{and}\ \ell(y^{4})=3.   This choice was made so that     ‚Ñì   (   [   J  F   ]   )    >  0        normal-‚Ñì   delimited-[]   subscript  J  F     0    \scriptstyle\ell\left(\left[J_{F}\right]\right)\,>\,0   as was required by the hypothesis, and to make the calculations involve integers, as aposed to fractions. Applying this to the multiplication table gives the matrix representation of the bilinear form Œ≤ with respect to the given basis:    \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccccc}    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array} \right]  The eigenvalues of this matrix are  There are 3 negative eigenvalues (), and six positive eigenvalues (); meaning that the signature of Œ≤ is . It follows that X has Poincar√©-Hopf index +3 at the origin.  Topological verification  With this particular choice of X it is possible to verify the Poincar√©-Hopf index is +3 by a direct application of the definition of Poincar√©-Hopf index. 10  This is very rarely the case, and was the reason for the choice of example . If one takes polar coordinates on the plane, i.e.  and  then and Restrict X to a circle, centre 0, radius , denoted by C 0,Œµ ; and consider the map given by       G  :   X  ‚üº   X   ||  X  ||      .     normal-:  G   normal-‚üº  X    X   norm  X       G:X\longmapsto\frac{X}{||X||}.   The Poincar√©-Hopf index of X is, by definition, the topological degree of the map G . 11 Restricting X to the circle C 0,Œµ , for arbitrarily small Œµ, gives        G   (  Œ∏  )    =   (   cos   (   3  Œ∏   )    ,   sin   (   3  Œ∏   )    )    ,        G  Œ∏        3  Œ∏        3  Œ∏       G(\theta)=(\cos(3\theta),\sin(3\theta)),\,   meaning that as Œ∏ makes one rotation about the circle C 0,Œµ in an anti-clockwise direction; the image G (Œ∏) makes three complete, anti-clockwise rotations about the unit circle C 0,1 . Meaning that the topological degree of G is +3 and that the Poincar√©-Hopf index of X at 0 is +3. 12  References  "  Category:Theorems in differential topology  Category:Singularity theory     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©    ‚Ü©     ‚Ü©
