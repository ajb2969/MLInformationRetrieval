   G2 manifold      G2 manifold   In differential geometry , a G 2 manifold is a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold with holonomy group contained in G 2 . The group     G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups . It can be described as the automorphism group of the octonions , or equivalently, as a proper subgroup of special orthogonal group SO(7) that preserves a spinor in the eight-dimensional spinor representation or lastly as the subgroup of the general linear group GL(7) which preserves the non-degenerate 3-form   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , the associative form. The Hodge dual ,    ψ  =  *  ϕ     fragments  ψ    ϕ    \psi=*\phi   is then a parallel 4-form, the coassociative form. These forms are calibrations in the sense of Harvey–Lawson , and thus define special classes of 3- and 4-dimensional submanifolds.  Properties  If M is a    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   -manifold, then M is:   Ricci-flat ,  orientable ,  a spin manifold .   History  Manifold with holonomy    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   was firstly introduced by Edmond Bonan in 1966, who constructed the parallel 3-form, the parallel 4-form and showed that this manifold was Ricci-flat. The first complete, but noncompact 7-manifolds with holonomy    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   were constructed by Robert Bryant and Salamon in 1989. The first compact 7-manifolds with holonomy    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   were constructed by Dominic Joyce in 1994, and compact    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   manifolds are sometimes known as "Joyce manifolds", especially in the physics literature.  Connections to physics  These manifolds are important in string theory . They break the original supersymmetry to 1/8 of the original amount. For example, M-theory compactified on a    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   manifold leads to a realistic four-dimensional (11-7=4) theory with N=1 supersymmetry. The resulting low energy effective supergravity contains a single supergravity supermultiplet , a number of chiral supermultiplets equal to the third Betti number of the    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   manifold and a number of U(1) vector supermultiplets equal to the second Betti number.
