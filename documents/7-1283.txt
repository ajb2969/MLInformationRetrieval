Milliken–Taylor theorem

In mathematics, the Milliken–Taylor theorem in combinatorics is a generalization of both Ramsey's theorem and Hindman's theorem. It is named after Keith Milliken and Alan D. Taylor.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of finite subsets of 
 
 
 
 , and define a partial order on 
 
 
 
  by α<β if and only if max α\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty \subset \mathbb{N}
and , let


 
  Let 
 
 
 
  denote the k-element subsets of a set S. The Milliken–Taylor theorem says that for any finite partition 
 
 
 
 , there exist some  and a sequence 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
For each 
 
 
 
 , call 
 
 
 
  an MTk set. Then, alternatively, the Milliken–Taylor theorem asserts that the collection of MTk sets is partition regular for each k.
