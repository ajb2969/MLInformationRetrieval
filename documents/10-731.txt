   Multiple of the median      Multiple of the median   A multiple of the median ( MoM ) is a measure of how far an individual test result deviates from the median . MoM is commonly used to report the results of medical screening tests, particularly where the results of the individual tests are highly variable . 1  MoM was originally used as a method to normalize data from participating laboratories of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) so that individual test results could be compared. 35 years later, it is the established standard for reporting maternal serum screening results. 2  An MoM for a test result for a patient can be determined by the following:       M  o  M   (   P  a  t  i  e  n  t   )    =    R  e  s  u  l  t   (   P  a  t  i  e  n  t   )     M  e  d  i  a  n   (   P  a  t  i  e  n  t  P  o  p  u  l  a  t  i  o  n   )           M  o  M    P  a  t  i  e  n  t        R  e  s  u  l  t    P  a  t  i  e  n  t      M  e  d  i  a  n    P  a  t  i  e  n  t  P  o  p  u  l  a  t  i  o  n       MoM(Patient)=\frac{Result(Patient)}{Median(PatientPopulation)}     As an example, Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing is used to screen for a neural tube defect (NTD) during the second trimester of pregnancy. If the median AFP result at 16 weeks of gestation is 30 ng/mL and a pregnant woman's AFP result at that same gestational age is 60 ng/mL, then her MoM is equal to 60/30 = 2.0. In other words, her AFP result is 2 times higher than "normal." 3  References  External links     "  Category:Medical tests  Category:Medical terminology  Category:Summary statistics  Category:Medical statistics     Bishop, J.C.; Dunstan, F.D.; Nix, B.J.; Reynolds, T.M. and Swift, A.; "All MoMs are not equal: some statistical properties associated with reporting results in the form of multiples of the median."
