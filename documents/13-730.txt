   Intersection (set theory)      Intersection (set theory)   In mathematics , the intersection  A ∩ B of two sets  A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that also belong to B (or equivalently, all elements of B that also belong to A ), but no other elements. 1  For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the table of mathematical symbols .  Basic definition  The intersection of A and B is written " A ∩ B ". Formally:       A  ∩  B   =   {  x  :   x  ∈    A   ∧  x   ∈  B   }         A  B    conditional-set  x      x    A  x        B       A\cap B=\{x:x\in A\,\land\,x\in B\}     that is   x ∈ A ∩ B  if and only if   x ∈ A  and  x ∈ B .     For example:  :* The intersection of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {2, 3}.  :* The number 9 is not in the intersection of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of odd numbers {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...}. 2  More generally, one can take the intersection of several sets at once. The intersection of A , B , C , and D , for example, is A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D = A ∩ ( B ∩ ( C ∩ D )). Intersection is an associative operation; thus,  A ∩ ( B ∩ C ) = ( A ∩ B ) ∩ C .  Inside a universe U one may define the complement  A c of A to be the set of all elements of U not in A . Now the intersection of A and B may be written as the complement of the union of their complements, derived easily from De Morgan's laws :  A ∩ B = ( A c ∪ B c ) c  Intersecting and disjoint sets  We say that A intersects (meets) B at an element x if x belongs to A and B . We say that A intersects (meets) B if A intersects B at some element. A intersects B if their intersection is inhabited .  We say that A and B are disjoint if A does not intersect B . In plain language, they have no elements in common. A and B are disjoint if their intersection is empty , denoted     A  ∩  B   =  ∅        A  B      A\cap B=\varnothing   .  For example, the sets {1, 2} and {3, 4} are disjoint, the set of even numbers intersects the set of multiples of 3 at 0, 6, 12, 18 and other numbers.  Arbitrary intersections  The most general notion is the intersection of an arbitrary nonempty collection of sets. If M is a nonempty set whose elements are themselves sets, then x is an element of the intersection of M if and only if for every element A of M , x is an element of A . In symbols:       (  x  ∈  ⋂  𝐌  )   ⇔   (  ∀  A  ∈  𝐌  ,  x  ∈  A  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  x    M  normal-)   normal-⇔   fragments  normal-(  for-all  A   M  normal-,  x   A  normal-)   normal-.    \left(x\in\bigcap\mathbf{M}\right)\Leftrightarrow\left(\forall A\in\mathbf{M},%
 \ x\in A\right).     The notation for this last concept can vary considerably. Set theorists will sometimes write " M ", while others will instead write " A ∈ M  A ". The latter notation can be generalized to " i ∈ I  A i ", which refers to the intersection of the collection { A i : i ∈ I }. Here I is a nonempty set, and A i is a set for every i in I .  In the case that the index set  I is the set of natural numbers , notation analogous to that of an infinite series may be seen:        ⋂   i  =  1   ∞    A  i    .      superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  A  i     \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}.     When formatting is difficult, this can also be written " A 1 ∩ A 2 ∩ A 3 ∩ ...", even though strictly speaking, A 1 ∩ ( A 2 ∩ ( A 3 ∩ ... makes no sense. (This last example, an intersection of countably many sets, is actually very common; for an example see the article on σ-algebras .)  Finally, let us note that whenever the symbol "∩" is placed before other symbols instead of between them, it should be of a larger size ().  Nullary intersection  Note that in the previous section we excluded the case where M was the empty set (). The reason is as follows: The intersection of the collection M is defined as the set (see set-builder notation )        ⋂  𝐌   =   {  x  :     ∀  A   ∈  𝐌   ,   x  ∈  A    }    .        𝐌    conditional-set  x   formulae-sequence     for-all  A   𝐌     x  A       \bigcap\mathbf{M}=\{x:\forall A\in\mathbf{M},x\in A\}.   If M is empty there are no sets A in M , so the question becomes "which x 's satisfy the stated condition?" The answer seems to be every possible x . When M is empty the condition given above is an example of a vacuous truth . So the intersection of the empty family should be the universal set (the identity element for the operation of intersection) 3  Unfortunately, according to standard ( ZFC ) set theory, the universal set does not exist. A partial fix for this problem can be found if we agree to restrict our attention to subsets of a fixed set U called the universe . In this case the intersection of a family of subsets of U can be defined as        ⋂  𝐌   =   {   x  ∈  U   :     ∀  A   ∈  𝐌   ,   x  ∈  A    }    .        𝐌    conditional-set    x  U    formulae-sequence     for-all  A   𝐌     x  A       \bigcap\mathbf{M}=\{x\in U:\forall A\in\mathbf{M},x\in A\}.   Now if M is empty there is no problem. The intersection is just the entire universe U , which is a well-defined set by assumption and becomes the identity element for this operation.
