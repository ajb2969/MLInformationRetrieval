   Capsule (geometry)      Capsule (geometry)   (Figure)  A two-dimensional orthographic projection of a capsule   A capsule (from Latin  capsula , "small box or chest"), or stadium of revolution , is a basic three-dimensional geometric shape consisting of a cylinder with hemispherical ends. 1 Another name for this shape is spherocylinder . 2  The shape is used for containers for pressurised gasses .  Formulas  The volume of a capsule is calculated by the formula    V  =   π   r  2    (     4  3   r   +  a   )        V    π   superscript  r  2         4  3   r   a      V=\pi r^{2}\left(\frac{4}{3}r+a\right)   where   r   r   r   is the radius of the cylinder and hemispheres and   a   a   a   is the height of the cylindrical part.  The surface area formula is      S  A   =   2  π  r   (    2  r   +  a   )     .        S  A     2  π  r      2  r   a      SA=2\pi r(2r+a).   . 3  References  "  Category:Elementary shapes     ↩  ↩  ↩
