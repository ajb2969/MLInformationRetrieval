   Wald's martingale      Wald's martingale   In probability theory  Wald's martingale , named after Abraham Wald and more commonly known as the geometric Brownian motion , is a stochastic process of the form        {     exp   (    λ   W  t    -    1  2    λ  2   t    )    ,  t   ≥  0   }              λ   subscript  W  t        1  2    superscript  λ  2   t     t   0     \left\{\exp\left(\lambda W_{t}-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2}t\right),t\geq 0\right\}        for any real value  λ where W t is a Wiener process . 1 2 3 The process is a martingale . 4  See also   Wald's equation   Notes  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩  ↩
