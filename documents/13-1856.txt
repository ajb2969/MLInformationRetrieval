Gent (hyperelastic model)

The ' Gent' hyperelastic material model 1 is a phenomenological model of rubber elasticity that is based on the concept of limiting chain extensibility. In this model, the strain energy density function is designed such that it has a singularity when the first invariant of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor reaches a limiting value 
 
 
 
 .
The strain energy density function for the Gent model is 2


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the shear modulus and 
 
 
 
 .
In the limit where 
 
 
 
 , the Gent model reduces to the Neo-Hookean solid model. This can be seen by expressing the Gent model in the form


 
  A Taylor series expansion of 
 
 
 
  around 
 
 
 
  and taking the limit as 
 
 
 
  leads to


 
  which is the expression for the strain energy density of a Neo-Hookean solid.
Several compressible versions of the Gent model have been designed. One such model has the form3


 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the bulk modulus, and 
 
 
 
  is the deformation gradient.
Consistency condition
We may alternatively express the Gent model in the form


 
  For the model to be consistent with linear elasticity, the following condition has to be satisfied:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the shear modulus of the material. Now, at 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  Therefore, the consistency condition for the Gent model is


 
  The Gent model assumes that 
 
 

Stress-deformation relations
The Cauchy stress for the incompressible Gent model is given by



Uniaxial extension
 For uniaxial extension in the 
 
 
 
 -direction, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  If 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Therefore,


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Equibiaxial extension
For equibiaxial extension in the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  directions, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Planar extension
Planar extension tests are carried out on thin specimens which are constrained from deforming in one direction. For planar extension in the 
 
 
 
  directions with the 
 
 
 
  direction constrained, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Simple shear
The deformation gradient for a simple shear deformation has the form4


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are reference orthonormal basis vectors in the plane of deformation and the shear deformation is given by


 
  In matrix form, the deformation gradient and the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor may then be expressed as


 
  Therefore,


 
  and the Cauchy stress is given by


 
  In matrix form,
