   Glycerol dehydrogenase (acceptor)      Glycerol dehydrogenase (acceptor)   In enzymology , a glycerol dehydrogenase (acceptor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycerol + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerone + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycerol and acceptor , whereas its two products are glycerone and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycerol:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called glycerol:(acceptor) 1-oxidoreductase . It employs one cofactor , PQQ .
