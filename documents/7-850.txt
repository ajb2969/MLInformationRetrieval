   Semisimple algebra      Semisimple algebra   In ring theory , a branch of mathematics, a semisimple algebra is an associative  artinian algebra over a field which has trivial Jacobson radical (only the zero element of the algebra is in the Jacobson radical). If the algebra is finite-dimensional this is equivalent to saying that it can be expressed as a Cartesian product of simple subalgebras .  Definition  The Jacobson radical of an algebra over a field is the ideal consisting of all elements that annihilate every simple left-module. The radical contains all nilpotent ideals, and if the algebra is finite-dimensional, the radical itself is a nilpotent ideal. A finite-dimensional algebra is then said to be semisimple if its radical contains only the zero element.  An algebra A is called simple if it has no proper ideals and A 2 = { ab | a , b ∈ A } ≠ {0}. As the terminology suggests, simple algebras are semisimple. The only possible ideals of a simple algebra A are A and {0}. Thus if A is not nilpotent, then A is semisimple. Because A 2 is an ideal of A and A is simple, A 2 = A . By induction, A n = A for every positive integer n , i.e. A is not nilpotent.  Any self-adjoint subalgebra A of n × n matrices with complex entries is semisimple. Let Rad( A ) be the radical of A . Suppose a matrix M is in Rad( A ). Then M*M lies in some nilpotent ideals of A , therefore ( M*M ) k = 0 for some positive integer k . By positive-semidefiniteness of M*M , this implies M*M = 0. So M x is the zero vector for all x , i.e. M = 0.  If { A i } is a finite collection of simple algebras, then their Cartesian product ∏ A i is semisimple. If ( a i ) is an element of Rad( A ) and e 1 is the multiplicative identity in A 1 (all simple algebras possess a multiplicative identity), then ( a 1 , a 2 , ...) · ( e 1 , 0, ...) = ( a 1 , 0..., 0) lies in some nilpotent ideal of ∏ A i . This implies, for all b in A 1 , a 1 b is nilpotent in A 1 , i.e. a 1 ∈ Rad( A 1 ). So a 1 = 0. Similarly, a i = 0 for all other i .  It is less apparent from the definition that the converse of the above is also true, that is, any finite-dimensional semisimple algebra is isomorphic to a Cartesian product of a finite number of simple algebras. The following is a semisimple algebra that appears not to be of this form. Let A be an algebra with Rad( A ) ≠ A . The quotient algebra B = A ⁄ Rad( A ) is semisimple: If J is a nonzero nilpotent ideal in B , then its preimage under the natural projection map is a nilpotent ideal in A which is strictly larger than Rad( A ), a contradiction.  Characterization  Let A be a finite-dimensional semisimple algebra, and       {  0  }   =   J  0   ⊂  ⋯  ⊂   J  n   ⊂  A         0    subscript  J  0        normal-⋯        subscript  J  n        A     \{0\}=J_{0}\subset\cdots\subset J_{n}\subset A     be a composition series of A , then A is isomorphic to the following Cartesian product:      A  ≃           J  1   ×   J  2    /   J  1    ×   J  3    /   J  2    ×  …  ×   J  n    /   J   n  -  1     ×  A   /   J  n       similar-to-or-equals  A                   subscript  J  1    subscript  J  2     subscript  J  1     subscript  J  3     subscript  J  2    normal-…   subscript  J  n     subscript  J    n  1     A    subscript  J  n      A\simeq J_{1}\times J_{2}/J_{1}\times J_{3}/J_{2}\times...\times J_{n}/J_{n-1}%
 \times A/J_{n}     where each       J   i  +  1    /    J  i         subscript  J    i  1     subscript  J  i     J_{i+1}/J_{i}\,     is a simple algebra.  The proof can be sketched as follows. First, invoking the assumption that A is semisimple, one can show that the J 1 is a simple algebra (therefore unital). So J 1 is a unital subalgebra and an ideal of J 2 . Therefore one can decompose        J  2   ≃     J  1   ×   J  2    /   J  1     .     similar-to-or-equals   subscript  J  2        subscript  J  1    subscript  J  2     subscript  J  1      J_{2}\simeq J_{1}\times J_{2}/J_{1}.     By maximality of J 1 as an ideal in J 2 and also the semisimplicity of A , the algebra       J  2   /    J  1         subscript  J  2    subscript  J  1     J_{2}/J_{1}\,     is simple. Proceed by induction in similar fashion proves the claim. For example, J 3 is the Cartesian product of simple algebras        J  3   ≃     J  2   ×   J  3    /   J  2    ≃       J  1   ×   J  2    /   J  1    ×   J  3    /   J  2     .       similar-to-or-equals   subscript  J  3        subscript  J  2    subscript  J  3     subscript  J  2      similar-to-or-equals             subscript  J  1    subscript  J  2     subscript  J  1     subscript  J  3     subscript  J  2       J_{3}\simeq J_{2}\times J_{3}/J_{2}\simeq J_{1}\times J_{2}/J_{1}\times J_{3}/%
 J_{2}.     The above result can be restated in a different way. For a semisimple algebra A = A 1 ×...× A n expressed in terms of its simple factors, consider the units e i ∈ A i . The elements E i = (0,..., e i ,...,0) are idempotent elements in A and they lie in the center of A . Furthermore, E i A = A i , E i E j = 0 for i ≠ j , and Σ E i = 1, the multiplicative identity in A .  Therefore, for every semisimple algebra A , there exists idempotents { E i } in the center of A , such that   E i E j = 0 for i ≠ j (such a set of idempotents is called central orthogonal ),  Σ E i = 1,  A is isomorphic to the Cartesian product of simple algebras E 1  A ×...× E n A .   Classification  A theorem due to Joseph Wedderburn completely classifies finite-dimensional semisimple algebras over a field   k   k   k   . Any such algebra is isomorphic to a finite product    ∏    M   n  i     (   D  i   )       product     subscript  M   subscript  n  i     subscript  D  i      \prod M_{n_{i}}(D_{i})   where the    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   are natural numbers, the    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   are division algebras over   k   k   k   , and     M   n  i     (   D  i   )        subscript  M   subscript  n  i     subscript  D  i     M_{n_{i}}(D_{i})   is the algebra of     n  i   ×   n  i        subscript  n  i    subscript  n  i     n_{i}\times n_{i}   matrices over    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   . This product is unique up to permutation of the factors. 1  This theorem was later generalized by Emil Artin to semisimple rings. This more general result is called the Artin-Wedderburn theorem .
