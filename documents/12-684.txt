   Q-ratio      Q-ratio   The Q-ratio (also known as Q number or just Q ) is used in poker  tournament strategy. It is also known as the "weak force." The Q-ratio describes the relation of the player's stack to the tournament players' average stack. A low Q-ratio — less than 1 — indicates a below-average chip stack, implying disadvantage against opponents. It is an addition to the M-ratio ("strong force") and usually doesn't play a large role in tournament decision-making. However, its importance grows as the table average M-ratio drops.  Q-ratio on freezeouts is calculated using the following method. 1      Q  =     c  u  r  r  e  n  t  C  h  i  p  s    s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  C  h  i  p  s    ×    c  u  r  r  e  n  t  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s    s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s         Q        c  u  r  r  e  n  t  C  h  i  p  s     s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  C  h  i  p  s        c  u  r  r  e  n  t  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s     s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s       Q=\frac{currentChips}{startingChips}\times\frac{currentNumPlayers}{startingNumPlayers}     For example, in a tournament starting with 50 players who have 10,000 chips, of which 30 have been eliminated, and one player has 20,000 chips:      Q  =     20  ,  000    10  ,  000    ×   20  50    =  0.8        Q       20  000    10  000      20  50         0.8     Q=\frac{20,000}{10,000}\times\frac{20}{50}=0.8     This player's accumulation of chips has not kept pace with the elimination of players, and their chip stack is now below average.  On rebuy and add-on tournaments, the calculation method is somewhat more complex and possible to calcutate in a reasonable amount of time only on specific online tournaments:      Q  =     c  u  r  r  e  n  t  C  h  i  p  s    s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  C  h  i  p  s    ×    c  u  r  r  e  n  t  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s     s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s   +   n  u  m  T  o  t  a  l  R  e  b  u  y  s   +   n  u  m  T  o  t  a  l  A  d  d  O  n  s          Q        c  u  r  r  e  n  t  C  h  i  p  s     s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  C  h  i  p  s        c  u  r  r  e  n  t  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s       s  t  a  r  t  i  n  g  N  u  m  P  l  a  y  e  r  s     n  u  m  T  o  t  a  l  R  e  b  u  y  s     n  u  m  T  o  t  a  l  A  d  d  O  n  s        Q=\frac{currentChips}{startingChips}\times\frac{currentNumPlayers}{%
