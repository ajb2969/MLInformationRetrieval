Carleman's equation

In mathematics, Carleman's equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind with a logarithmic kernel. Its solution was first given by Torsten Carleman in 1922. The equation is



The solution for b − a ≠ 4 is



If b − a = 4 then the equation is solvable only if the following condition is satisfied



In this case the solution has the form



where C is an arbitrary constant.
For the special case f(t) = 1 (in which case it is necessary to have b − a ≠ 4), useful in some applications, we get
