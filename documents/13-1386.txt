   Kelvin–Stokes theorem      Kelvin–Stokes theorem    For a more conventional discussion see Stokes Theorem.   The Kelvin–Stokes theorem , 1 2 3 4 5 also known as the curl theorem , 6 is a theorem in vector calculus on . Given a vector field , the theorem relates the integral of the curl of the vector field over some surface, to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary of the surface. The Kelvin–Stokes theorem is a special case of the “generalized Stokes' theorem .” 7 8 In particular, a vector field on can be considered as a 1-form in which case curl is the exterior derivative .  Theorem  Let be a Piecewise smooth  Jordan plane curve . The Jordan curve theorem implies that   γ   γ   γ   divides into two components, a compact one and another that is non-compact. Let   D   D   D   denote the compact part that is bounded by   γ   γ   γ   and suppose is smooth, with    S  :=   ψ   (  D  )       assign  S    ψ  D     S:=ψ(D)   . If   Γ   normal-Γ   Γ   is the space curve defined by     Γ   (  t  )    =   ψ   (   γ   (  t  )    )          normal-Γ  t     ψ    γ  t      Γ(t)=ψ(γ(t))    9 and   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   is a smooth vector field on , then: 10 11 12        ∮  Γ     𝐅   d  Γ    =    ∬  S     ∇  ×   𝐅    d  S          subscript  contour-integral  normal-Γ     𝐅  d  normal-Γ      subscript  double-integral  S       normal-∇  𝐅   d  S      \oint_{\Gamma}\mathbf{F}\,d\Gamma=\iint_{S}\nabla\times\mathbf{F}\,dS     Proof  The proof of the Theorem consists of 4 steps. 13 14 If you know the differential form , when we considering following identification of the vector field ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 )}} ,      𝐀  =   ω  𝐀   =     a  1   d   x  1    +    a  2   d   x  2    +    a  3   d   x  3           𝐀   subscript  ω  𝐀             subscript  a  1   d   subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2   d   subscript  x  2       subscript  a  3   d   subscript  x  3        \mathbf{A}=\omega_{\mathbf{A}}=a_{1}dx_{1}+a_{2}dx_{2}+a_{3}dx_{3}         𝐀  =   ω  𝐀     *   =         a  1   d   x  2    ∧   d   x  3     +    a  2   d   x  3     ∧   d   x  1     +    a  3   d   x  1     ∧   d   x  2           𝐀   superscript   subscript  ω  𝐀                       subscript  a  1   d   subscript  x  2      d   subscript  x  3        subscript  a  2   d   subscript  x  3       d   subscript  x  1        subscript  a  3   d   subscript  x  1       d   subscript  x  2        \mathbf{A}={}^{*}\omega_{\mathbf{A}}=a_{1}dx_{2}\wedge dx_{3}+a_{2}dx_{3}%

Under the identification  F }} the following equations are satisfied.      ∇  ×  𝐅      normal-∇  𝐅    \displaystyle\nabla\times\mathbf{F}     Here,   d   d   d   stands for Exterior derivative of Differential form , stands for pull back by   ψ   ψ   ψ   and, and are same as and of the body text of this article respectively. We assume Green's theorem , so what is of concern is how to boil down the three-dimensional complicated problem (Kelvin–Stokes theorem) to a two-dimensional rudimentary problem (Green's theorem). In an ordinary, mathematicians use the differential form , especially " pull-back 15 of differential form" is very powerful tool for this situation, however, learning differential form needs too much background knowledge. So, the proof below does not require background information on differential form , and may be helpful for understanding the notion of differential form .  First step of the proof (defining the pullback)  Define       𝐏   (  u  ,  v  )    =   (    P  1    (  u  ,  v  )    ,    P  2    (  u  ,  v  )    )         𝐏   u  v        subscript  P  1    u  v       subscript  P  2    u  v       \mathbf{P}(u,v)=(P_{1}(u,v),P_{2}(u,v))     so that   𝐏   𝐏   \mathbf{P}   is the pull-back 16 of   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   , and that    𝐏   (  u  ,  v  )       𝐏   u  v     \mathbf{P}(u,v)   is -valued function, depends on two parameter    u  ,  v     u  v    u,v   . In order to do so we define and as follows.         P  1    (  u  ,  v  )    =   ⟨   𝐅   (   ψ   (  u  ,  v  )    )    |    ∂  ψ    ∂  u    ⟩    ,     P  2    (  u  ,  v  )    =   ⟨   𝐅   (   ψ   (  u  ,  v  )    )    |    ∂  ψ    ∂  v    ⟩       formulae-sequence       subscript  P  1    u  v     inner-product    𝐅    ψ   u  v         ψ     u           subscript  P  2    u  v     inner-product    𝐅    ψ   u  v         ψ     v        P_{1}(u,v)=\left\langle\mathbf{F}(\psi(u,v))\bigg|\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial

 }\right\rangle,\qquad P_{2}(u,v)=\left\langle\mathbf{F}(\psi(u,v))\bigg|\frac{%
 \partial\psi}{\partial v}\right\rangle     Where,    ⟨  |  ⟩     fragments  normal-⟨  normal-|  normal-⟩    \langle\ |\ \rangle   is the normal inner product of and hereinafter,    ⟨   |  A  |   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩    A     \langle\ |A|\ \rangle   stands for bilinear form according to matrix   A   A   A   . Given a    n  ×  m      n  normal-×  m    n×m   matrix   A   A   A   we define a bilinear form :      𝐱  ∈   𝐑  m   ,  𝐲  ∈    𝐑  n    :   ⟨  𝐱  |  A  |  𝐲  ⟩   =   𝐱    t   A  𝐲     fragments  x    superscript  𝐑  m   normal-,  y    superscript  𝐑  n   normal-:  italic-   fragments  normal-⟨  x  normal-|  A  normal-|  y  normal-⟩     superscript  𝐱  t   A  y    \mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{R}^{m},\mathbf{y}\in\mathbf{R}^{n}\ :\qquad\left\langle%

 \mathbf{y}\right\rangle=\left\langle\mathbf{x}|A+B|\mathbf{y}\right\rangle     Second step of the proof (first equation)  According to the definition of line integral ,        ∮  Γ     𝐅  d  Γ       subscript  contour-integral  normal-Γ     𝐅  d  normal-Γ     \displaystyle\oint_{\Gamma}\mathbf{F}d\Gamma     where,    J  ψ      J  ψ    Jψ   stands for the Jacobian matrix of   ψ   ψ   ψ   . Hence, 17      ⟨   (    𝐅  ∘  Γ    (  t  )    )   |     (   J  ψ   )    γ   (  t  )        d  γ    d  t      (  t  )    ⟩     inner-product      𝐅  normal-Γ   t      subscript    J  ψ     γ  t        d  γ     d  t    t     \displaystyle\left\langle(\mathbf{F}\circ\Gamma(t))\bigg|(J\psi)_{\gamma(t)}%
 \frac{d\gamma}{dt}(t)\right\rangle     So, we obtain following equation        ∮  Γ    𝐅  d  Γ    =    ∮  γ    𝐏  d  γ          subscript  contour-integral  normal-Γ     𝐅  d  normal-Γ      subscript  contour-integral  γ     𝐏  d  γ      \oint_{\Gamma}\mathbf{F}d\Gamma=\oint_{\gamma}\mathbf{P}d\gamma     Third step of the proof (second equation)  First, calculate the partial derivatives, using Leibniz rule of inner product        ∂   P  1     ∂  v           subscript  P  1      v     \displaystyle\frac{\partial P_{1}}{\partial v}     So, 18 We prove following (★0).

 \mathbf{R}^{3}   (★0)  First, we note the linearity of the algebraic operator    𝐚  ×      𝐚  normal-×    \mathbf{a}×   and, we obtain its matrix representation. The method how to obtain the matrix representation of Linear map are described in for example 4 . Let both of   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   and   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   be 3-dimensional Column vector represented as follows,       𝐚  =   (      a  1        a  2        a  3      )    ,   𝐱  =   (      x  1        x  2        x  3      )       formulae-sequence    𝐚     subscript  a  1      subscript  a  2      subscript  a  3        𝐱     subscript  x  1      subscript  x  2      subscript  x  3        \mathbf{a}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{1}\\
 a_{2}\\
 a_{3}\end{pmatrix},\quad\mathbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix}x_{1}\\
 x_{2}\\
 x_{3}\end{pmatrix}     Then, according to the definition of Cross product ,    𝐚  ×  𝐱      𝐚  normal-×  𝐱    \mathbf{a}×\mathbf{x}   are represented as follows.       𝐚  ×  𝐱   =   (        a  2    x  3    -    a  3    x  2            a  3    x  1    -    a  1    x  3            a  1    x  2    -    a  2    x  1        )         𝐚  𝐱          subscript  a  2    subscript  x  3       subscript  a  3    subscript  x  2            subscript  a  3    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  1    subscript  x  3            subscript  a  1    subscript  x  2       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  1         \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{2}x_{3}-a_{3}x_{2}\\
 a_{3}x_{1}-a_{1}x_{3}\\

Application for conservative force and scalar potential  In this section, we will discuss the lamellar vector field based on Kelvin–Stokes theorem.  First, we define the notarization map as follows.      {       θ   [  a  ,  b  ]    :    [  0  ,  1  ]   →   [  a  ,  b  ]            θ   [  a  ,  b  ]    =    s   (   b  -  a   )    +  a           cases   normal-:   subscript  θ   a  b     normal-→   0  1    a  b     otherwise     subscript  θ   a  b        s    b  a    a    otherwise    \begin{cases}\theta_{[a,b]}:[0,1]\to[a,b]\\

For all piece-wise smooth paths and all smooth vector fields   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   , the domain of which includes    c   (  a  a  ,  b  )   )     fragments  c   fragments  normal-(  a  a  normal-,  b  normal-)   normal-)    c(aa,b))   , one has:        ∫  c    𝐅  d  c    =     ∫   c  ∘   θ   [  a  ,  b  ]         𝐅   d   (   c  ∘   θ   [  a  ,  b  ]     )           subscript   c     𝐅  d  c      subscript     c   subscript  θ   a  b        𝐅  d    c   subscript  θ   a  b         \int_{c}\mathbf{F}dc=\int_{c\circ\theta_{[a,b]}}\ \mathbf{F}\ d(c\circ\theta_{%

A smooth vector field,   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   on an open  is called a Lamellar vector field if     ∇  ×  𝐅   =  0        normal-∇  normal-×  𝐅   0    ∇×\mathbf{F}=0   .     In mechanics a lamellar vector field is called a conservative force ; in fluid dynamics , it is called a Vortex-free vector field . So, lamellar vector field, conservative force, and vortex-free vector field are the same notion.  Helmholtz's theorems  In this section, we will introduce a theorem that is derived from the Kelvin–Stokes theorem and characterizes vortex-free vector fields. In fluid dynamics it is called Helmholtz's theorems . 19  That theorem is also important in the area of Homotopy theorem . 20     Theorem 2-1 (Helmholtz's Theorem in Fluid Dynamics). 21 and see p142 of Fujimoto 22 Let be an open  subset with a Lamellar vector field   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   , and piecewise smooth loops .

Then,         ∫   c  0      𝐅   d   c  0     =    ∫   c  1      𝐅   d   c  1           subscript    subscript  c  0      𝐅  d   subscript  c  0       subscript    subscript  c  1      𝐅  d   subscript  c  1       \int_{c_{0}}\mathbf{F}\,dc_{0}=\int_{c_{1}}\mathbf{F}\,dc_{1}          Some textbooks such as Lawrence 23 call the relationship between and stated in Theorem 2-1 as “homotope” and the function    H  :   0  ,   11  ×  0   ,   11  →  U       normal-:  H   0    11  normal-×  0     11  normal-→  U      H:0,11×0,11→U   as “homotopy between and ”. However, “homotope” or “homotopy” in above-mentioned sense are different (stronger than) typical definitions of “homotope” or “homotopy”. Typical definition of homotopy and homotope are as follows.     Definition (Homotopy and Homotope). Suppose Z and W are topological spaces, with continuous maps f 0 , f 1 : Z → W .  (1) The continuous map    H  :    Z  ×  0   ,   11  →  W       normal-:  H     Z  normal-×  0     11  normal-→  W      H:Z×0,11→W   is said to be a "Homotopy between f 0 and f 1 " if   [H1] H ( t , 0) = f 0 ( t ) for all t ∈ Z ,  [H2] H ( t , 1) = f 1 ( t ) for all t ∈ Z .   (2) If there is a homotopy between f 0 and f 1 ", f 0 and f 1 " are said to be homotope.  (3) Suppose f 0 and f 1 are homotope and H is a homotopy between them. f 0 and f 1 are said to be piecewise homotope, if f 0 , f 1 , and H are piecewise smooth. H is then said to be the piecewise homotopy between f 0 and f 1 .     So from now on we refer to homotopy (homotope) in the sense of Theorem 2-1 as tube-like-homotopy (homotope) . In some textbooks such as  use the term of homotopy and homotope in Theorem 2-1 sense. homotopy and homotope in Theorem 2-1 sense Indeed, it is convenience to adopt such sense to discuss conservative force. However, homotopy in Theorem 2-1 sense and homotope in Theorem 2-1 sense are different from and stronger than homotopy in typical sense and homotope in typical sense. So there are no appropriate terminology which can discriminate between homotopy in typical sense and sense of Theorem 2-1. In this article, to avoid ambiguity and to discriminate between them, we will define two “just-in-time term”, tube-like homotopy and tube-like homotope as follows.     Definition (tube-like homotopy and tube-homotope). Suppose satisfy the following:   [A]  M is differentiable manifold ,  [B] The domain of c 0 : [0, 1] → M and c 1 : [0, 1] → M are the same,  [C] Both , and are continuous curves.   Then,  (1) Tube-Like-Homotopy: A homotopy    H  :   0  ,   11  ×  0   ,   11  →  M       normal-:  H   0    11  normal-×  0     11  normal-→  M      H:0,11×0,11→M   is "Tube-Like", if   [TLH0]  H is continues  [TLH1]  H ( t , 0) = c 0 ( t )  [TLH2]  H ( t , 1) = c 1 ( t )  [TLH3]  H (0, s ) = H (1, s ) for all s ∈ [0, 1]   (2) Tube homotope:  c 0 , and c 1 are "Tube Homotope" if and only if "there are H such that there is a Tube-like-Homotopy between c 0 and c 1 .  (3) Tube like and piecewise smooth homotopy: The homotopy H of (1) is Tube like and piecewise smooth homotopy when that H is piecewise smooth. And the relation of (1) is “Piecewise smooth Tube Homotope” when that H is piecewise smooth (so, it is “Piecewise smooth Tube Homotope”).      Proof of the theorem  (Figure)  The definitions of   Hereinafter, the ⊕ stands for joining paths If the two curves , satisfy  β ( a 2 )}} then, we can define new curve    α  ⊕  β      α  normal-⊕  β    α⊕β   so that, for all smooth vector field   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   (if domain of which includes image of    α  ⊕  β      α  normal-⊕  β    α⊕β   )        ∫   α  ⊕  β      𝐅   d   (   α  ⊕  β   )     =     ∫  α     𝐅   d  α    +    ∫  β     𝐅   d  β           subscript    direct-sum  α  β      𝐅  d   direct-sum  α  β         subscript   α     𝐅  d  α      subscript   β     𝐅  d  β       \int_{\alpha\oplus\beta}\mathbf{F}\,d(\alpha\oplus\beta)=\int_{\alpha}\mathbf{%

Application for conservative force  Helmholtz's theorem, gives an explanation as to why the work done by a conservative force in changing an object's position is path independent. First, we introduce the Lemma 2-2, which is a corollary of and a special case of Helmholtz's theorem.     Lemma 2-2. 26 27 Let be an open  subset , with a Lamellar vector field   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   and a piecewise smooth loop . Fix a point    𝐩  ∈  U      𝐩  normal-∈  U    \mathbf{p}∈U   , if there is a homotopy (tube-like-homotopy)    H  :   0  ,   11  ×  0   ,   11  →  U       normal-:  H   0    11  normal-×  0     11  normal-→  U      H:0,11×0,11→U   such that   [SC0]  H is piecewise smooth ,  [SC1]  H ( t , 0) = c 0 ( t ) for all t ∈ [0, 1],  [SC2]  H ( t , 1) = p for all t ∈ [0, 1],  [SC3]  H (0, s ) = H (1, s ) = p for all s ∈ [0, 1].   Then,         ∫   c  0      𝐅   d   c  0     =  0        subscript    subscript  c  0      𝐅  d   subscript  c  0     0    \int_{c_{0}}\mathbf{F}\,dc_{0}=0          Lemma 2-2, obviously follows from Theorem 2-1. In Lemma 2-2, the existence of   H   H   H   satisfying [SC0] to [SC3] is crucial. It is a well-known fact that, if U is simply connected, such H exists. The definition of Simply connected space follows:     Definition 2-2 (Simply Connected Space). 28 29 Let be non-empty, connected and path-connected .   M   M   M   is called simply connected if and only if for any continuous loop,    c  :   0  ,   11  →  M       normal-:  c   0    11  normal-→  M      c:0,11→M   there exists    H  :   0  ,   11  ×  0   ,   11  →  M       normal-:  H   0    11  normal-×  0     11  normal-→  M      H:0,11×0,11→M   such that   [SC0']  H is continuous ,  [SC1]  H ( t , 0) = c ( t ) for all t ∈ [0, 1],  [SC2]  H ( t , 1) = p for all t ∈ [0, 1],  [SC3]  H (0, s ) = H (1, s ) = p for all s ∈ [0, 1].       You will find that, the [SC1] to [SC3] of both Lemma 2-2 and Definition 2-2 is same.  So, someone may think that, "for a conservative force, the work done in changing an object's position is path independent" is elucidated. However there are very large gaps between following two:   There are continuous    H   H   H   such that it satisfies [SC1] to [SC3]  There are piecewise smooth    H   H   H   such that it satisfies [SC1] to [SC3]   To fill that gap, the deep knowledge of Homotopy Theorem is required. For example the following resources may be helpful for you.   Lee teaches Whitney approximation theorem ( 30 page 136) and "How to use that theorem to this isuue" ( 31 page 421).  More general statements appear in 32 (see Theorems 7 and 8).   Considering above-mentioned fact and Lemma 2-2, we will obtain following theorem.

(see Iwahori 38 p. 399) A non-empty subset is said to be a "Cube subdivisionable sphere" when there are at least one Indexed family of singular 2-cube       {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ      subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  φ  λ    subscript  S  λ       λ  normal-Λ     \left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}     such that      Λ   normal-Λ   Λ   is a finite set .

Definitions 3-3 (Boundary of a Cube Subdivision Sphere). (see Iwahori 39 p. 399) Let be a cube subdivisionable sphere with cube subdivision:        {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ    .     subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  φ  λ    subscript  S  λ       λ  normal-Λ     \left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}.     (1) The     φ   λ  1    ∘   δ   [  1  ,   j  1   ,   c  1   ]         subscript  φ   subscript  λ  1     subscript  δ   1   subscript  j  1    subscript  c  1       \varphi_{\lambda_{1}}\circ\delta_{[1,j_{1},c_{1}]}   are said to be an edge of the cube subdivision if         φ   λ  1    ∘   δ   [  1  ,   j  1   ,   c  1   ]      (  I  )    =     φ   λ  2    ∘   δ   [  1  ,   j  2   ,   c  2   ]      (  I  )             subscript  φ   subscript  λ  1     subscript  δ   1   subscript  j  1    subscript  c  1      I        subscript  φ   subscript  λ  2     subscript  δ   1   subscript  j  2    subscript  c  2      I     \varphi_{\lambda_{1}}\circ\delta_{[1,j_{1},c_{1}]}(I)=\varphi_{\lambda_{2}}%
 \circ\delta_{[1,j_{2},c_{2}]}(I)     implies     (   λ  1   ,   j  1   ,   c  1   )   =   (   λ  2   ,   j  2   ,   c  2   )         subscript  λ  1    subscript  j  1    subscript  c  1      subscript  λ  2    subscript  j  2    subscript  c  2      (\lambda_{1},j_{1},c_{1})=(\lambda_{2},j_{2},c_{2})   . That means,   l   l   l   is said to be an edge of     {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ      subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  φ  λ    subscript  S  λ       λ  normal-Λ     \{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}   if and only if there are unique    λ  ,  c     λ  c    λ,c   and   j   j   j   such that,    l  =    φ  λ   ∘   δ   [  1  ,  j  ,  c  ]         l     subscript  φ  λ    subscript  δ   1  j  c       l=\varphi_{\lambda}\circ\delta_{[1,j,c]}   .  (2) The boundary of the cube subdivision is a collection of edges in the above sense.    ∂    {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ       fragments    subscript   fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   superscript  I  2   normal-,   subscript  φ  λ   normal-,   subscript  S  λ   normal-)   normal-}     λ  normal-Λ      \partial\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}   means the boundary of     {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ      subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  φ  λ    subscript  S  λ       λ  normal-Λ     \{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}     (3) The notation for an edge   l   l   l   is as follows:      l  ≺  ∂    {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ       fragments  l  precedes    subscript   fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   superscript  I  2   normal-,   subscript  φ  λ   normal-,   subscript  S  λ   normal-)   normal-}     λ  normal-Λ      l\prec\partial\left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}        The definition of the boundary of the Definitions 3-3 is apparently depends on the cube subdivision. However, considering the following fact, the boundary is not depends on the cube subdivision.     Lemma 3-4. (see Iwahori 40 p. 399) Let be a cube subdivisionable sphere with cube subdivisions:         {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ    ,    {   (   I  2   ,   ψ  μ   ,   L  μ   )   }    μ  ∈  M     .      subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  φ  λ    subscript  S  λ       λ  normal-Λ     subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  ψ  μ    subscript  L  μ       μ  M      \left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda},\quad%
 \left\{(I^{2},\psi_{\mu},L_{\mu})\right\}_{\mu\in M}.     Then      ∂    {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ    =  ∂    {   (   I  2   ,   ψ  μ   ,   L  μ   )   }    μ  ∈  M       fragments    subscript   fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   superscript  I  2   normal-,   subscript  φ  λ   normal-,   subscript  S  λ   normal-)   normal-}     λ  normal-Λ       subscript   fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   superscript  I  2   normal-,   subscript  ψ  μ   normal-,   subscript  L  μ   normal-)   normal-}     μ  M      \partial\left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{\lambda\in%
 \Lambda}=\partial\left\{(I^{2},\psi_{\mu},L_{\mu})\right\}_{\mu\in M}     therefore the definition of boundary is not dependent on the choice of cube subdivision.     Therefore the following Definition is well-defined:     Definitions 3-5 (Boundary of Surface). (see Iwahori 41 p399) Let be a cube subdivisionable sphere and,     {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ      subscript     superscript  I  2    subscript  φ  λ    subscript  S  λ       λ  normal-Λ     \{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}   , then  (1)      ∂  S  :=  ∂    {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ       fragments   S  assign    subscript   fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   superscript  I  2   normal-,   subscript  φ  λ   normal-,   subscript  S  λ   normal-)   normal-}     λ  normal-Λ      \partial S:=\partial\left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{%
 \lambda\in\Lambda}     (2) If      l  ≺  ∂    {   (   I  2   ,   φ  λ   ,   S  λ   )   }    λ  ∈  Λ       fragments  l  precedes    subscript   fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   superscript  I  2   normal-,   subscript  φ  λ   normal-,   subscript  S  λ   normal-)   normal-}     λ  normal-Λ      l\prec\partial\left\{(I^{2},\varphi_{\lambda},S_{\lambda})\right\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}   then      l  ≺   ∂  S      precedes  l    S     l\prec\partial S   and then such   l   l   l   are said to be an edge of   S   S   S   .
