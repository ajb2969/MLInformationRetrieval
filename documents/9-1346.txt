   Belt problem      Belt problem   (Figure)  The belt problem   The belt problem is a mathematics problem which requires finding the length of a crossed belt that connects two circular pulleys with radius  r 1 and r 2 whose centers are separated by a distance P . The solution of the belt problem requires trigonometry and the concepts of the bitangent line , the vertical angle , and congruent angles .  Solution  Clearly triangles ACO and ADO are congruent  right angled triangles , as are triangles BEO and BFO. In addition, triangles ACO and BEO are similar . Therefore angles CAO, DAO, EBO and FBO are all equal. Denoting this angle by   φ   φ   \varphi   , the length of the belt is       C  O   +   D  O   +   E  O   +   F  O   +   arc  C  D   +   arc  E  F         C  O     D  O     E  O     F  O     arc  C  D     arc  E  F     CO+DO+EO+FO+\text{arc}CD+\text{arc}EF\,\!          =    2   r  1    tan   (  φ  )     +   2   r  2    tan   (  φ  )     +    (    2  π   -   2  φ    )    r  1    +    (    2  π   -   2  φ    )    r  2         absent      2   subscript  r  1     φ      2   subscript  r  2     φ          2  π     2  φ     subscript  r  1          2  π     2  φ     subscript  r  2       =2r_{1}\tan(\varphi)+2r_{2}\tan(\varphi)+(2\pi-2\varphi)r_{1}+(2\pi-2\varphi)r%
 _{2}\,\!          =   2   (    r  1   +   r  2    )    (     tan   (  φ  )    +  π   -  φ   )        absent    2     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2          φ   π   φ      =2(r_{1}+r_{2})(\tan(\varphi)+\pi-\varphi)\,\!     This uses the fact that the length of an arc = the radius × the measure of the angle facing the arc in radians .  To find   φ   φ   \varphi   we see from the similarity of triangles ACO and BEO that        A  O    B  O    =    A  C    B  E            A  O     B  O        A  C     B  E      \frac{AO}{BO}=\frac{AC}{BE}\,\!          ⇒    P  -  x   x   =    r  1    r  2         normal-⇒  absent      P  x   x           subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2       \Rightarrow\frac{P-x}{x}=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}\,\!          ⇒   P  x   =     r  1   +   r  2     r  2         normal-⇒  absent    P  x             subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2     subscript  r  2       \Rightarrow\frac{P}{x}=\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{r_{2}}\,\!          ⇒  x  =    P   r  2      r  1   +   r  2          normal-⇒  absent  x           P   subscript  r  2       subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2        \Rightarrow{x}=\frac{Pr_{2}}{r_{1}+r_{2}}\,\!          cos   (  φ  )    =    r  2   x   =    r  2    (     P   r  2      r  1   +   r  2      )    =     r  1   +   r  2    P           φ      subscript  r  2   x           subscript  r  2       P   subscript  r  2       subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2                subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    P      \cos(\varphi)=\frac{r_{2}}{x}=\frac{r_{2}}{\left(\dfrac{Pr_{2}}{r_{1}+r_{2}}%
 \right)}=\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{P}\,\!          ⇒  φ  =    cos   -  1     (     r  1   +   r  2    P   )         normal-⇒  absent  φ         superscript     1         subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    P       \Rightarrow\varphi=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{P}\right)\,\!     For fixed P the length of the belt depends only on the sum of the radius values r 1 + r 2 , and not on their individual values.  Pulley problem  (Figure)  The pulley problem   There are other types of problems similar to the belt problem. The pulley problem, as shown, is similar to the belt problem; however, the belt does not cross itself. In the pulley problem the length of the belt is        2  P   sin   (   θ  2   )     +    r  1    (    2  π   -  θ   )    +    r  2    θ     ,        2  P      θ  2        subscript  r  1       2  π   θ       subscript  r  2   θ     2P\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)+r_{1}(2\pi-\theta)+r_{2}{\theta}\,,     where r 1 represents the radius of the larger pulley, r 2 represents the radius of the smaller one, and:       θ  =   2    cos   -  1     (     r  1   -   r  2    P   )      .      θ    2    superscript     1         subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    P       \theta=2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r_{1}-r_{2}}{P}\right)\,.     Applications  The belt problem is used in real life 1 in the design of aeroplanes , bicycle gearing , cars , and other items with pulleys or belts that cross each other. The pulley problem is also used in the design of conveyor belts found in airport  luggage belts and automated  factory lines. 2  See also   Tangent lines to circles   References  "  Category:Trigonometry     Trigonometry examples in real life ↩  Trigonometry used in conveyor belts ↩
