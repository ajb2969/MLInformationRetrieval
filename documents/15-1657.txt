(G,X)-manifold

In mathematics, the concept of a 

 
 -manifold generalizes several different kinds of manifolds, including Riemannian manifolds, affine manifolds, piecewise linear manifolds, etc.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a group acting on a manifold 
 
 
 
  via diffeomorphisms—i.e. for each 
 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to itself is a diffeomorphism. A manifold 
 
 
 
  which satisfies the following conditions is called a 

 
 -manifold:1

There exists an open cover

 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  and a family 
 
 
 
  of diffeomorphisms taking each  to an open subset  of 
 
 
 
 .
For each  with nonempty intersection, there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . In other words, viewing the elements of 
 
 
 
  as diffeomorphisms, each transition map 
 
 
 
  is the restriction of an element of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 
 .
