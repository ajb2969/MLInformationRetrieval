   (G,X)-manifold      (G,X)-manifold   In mathematics, the concept of a     (  G  ,  X  )     G  X    (G,X)   -manifold generalizes several different kinds of manifolds , including Riemannian manifolds , affine manifolds , piecewise linear manifolds , etc.  Definition  Let   G   G   G   be a group  acting on a manifold   X   X   X   via diffeomorphisms —i.e. for each    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   , the map    x  ↦   g  x      maps-to  x    g  x     x\mapsto gx   from   X   X   X   to itself is a diffeomorphism. A manifold   M   M   M   which satisfies the following conditions is called a     (  G  ,  X  )     G  X    (G,X)   -manifold : 1   There exists an open cover     {   U  α   }      subscript  U  α     \{U_{\alpha}\}   of   M   M   M   and a family    {   φ  α   :    U  α   →   V  α    }     conditional-set   subscript  φ  α    normal-→   subscript  U  α    subscript  V  α      \{\varphi_{\alpha}\colon U_{\alpha}\to V_{\alpha}\}   of diffeomorphisms taking each to an open subset of   X   X   X   .  For each with nonempty intersection, there exists a    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   such that     g  x   =     ϕ  α   ∘   ϕ  β   -  1      (  x  )          g  x        subscript  ϕ  α    superscript   subscript  ϕ  β     1     x     gx=\phi_{\alpha}\circ\phi_{\beta}^{-1}(x)   for all    x  ∈    V  α   ∩   V  β        x     subscript  V  α    subscript  V  β      x\in V_{\alpha}\cap V_{\beta}   . In other words, viewing the elements of   G   G   G   as diffeomorphisms, each transition map      ϕ  α   ∘   ϕ  β   -  1     :     V  α   ∩   V  β    →    V  α   ∩   V  β        normal-:     subscript  ϕ  α    superscript   subscript  ϕ  β     1      normal-→     subscript  V  α    subscript  V  β       subscript  V  α    subscript  V  β       \phi_{\alpha}\circ\phi_{\beta}^{-1}\colon V_{\alpha}\cap V_{\beta}\to V_{%
 \alpha}\cap V_{\beta}   is the restriction of an element of   G   G   G   to     V  α   ∩   V  β        subscript  V  α    subscript  V  β     V_{\alpha}\cap V_{\beta}   .   Citations  References      "  Category:Structures on manifolds     ↩
