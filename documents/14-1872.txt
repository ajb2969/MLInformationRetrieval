   Leigh Mercer      Leigh Mercer   Leigh Mercer (1893–1977) was a noted British  wordplay and recreational mathematics expert. He is best known for devising the celebrated palindrome "A man, a plan, a canal — Panama!". 1  The following mathematical limerick is attributed to him: 2         12  +  144  +  20  +   3   4     7   +   (   5  ×  11   )    =    9  2   +  0             12  144  20    3    4     7     5  11       superscript  9  2   0     \frac{12+144+20+3\sqrt{4}}{7}+(5\times 11)=9^{2}+0   This is read as follows:   A dozen , a gross , and a score   Plus three times the square root of four  Divided by seven  Plus five times eleven  Is nine squared and not a bit more.
