3-deoxy-8-phosphooctulonate synthase

In enzymology, a 3-deoxy-8-phosphooctulonate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphoenolpyruvate + D-arabinose 5-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-octonate 8-phosphate + phosphate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate, D-arabinose 5-phosphate, and H2O, whereas its two products are 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-octonate 8-phosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate:D-arabinose-5-phosphate C-(1-carboxyvinyl)transferase (phosphate-hydrolysing, 2-carboxy-2-oxoethyl-forming). Other names in common use include 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-octonate-8-phosphate, D-arabinose-5-phosphate-lyase (pyruvate-phosphorylating), 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphooctonate aldolase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-8-phosphooctonic synthetase, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase, 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonate-8-phosphate synthetase, 3-deoxyoctulosonic 8-phosphate synthetase, KDOP synthase, and phospho-2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate aldolase. This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
