   Total pressure      Total pressure   In physics , the term total pressure may indicate two different quantities, both having the dimensions of a pressure :   In fluid dynamics , total pressure (    p  0     subscript  p  0    p_{0}   ) refers to the sum of static pressure p, dynamic pressure q, and gravitational head, as expressed by Bernoulli's principle :        p  0   =   p  +  q  +   ρ  g   z          subscript  p  0     p  q    ρ  g  z      p_{0}=p+q+\rho gz\,      where ρ is the density of the fluid, g is the local acceleration due to gravity, and z is the height above a datum.  If the variation in height above the datum is zero, or so small it can be ignored, the above equation reduces to the following simplified form:       p  0   =   p  +   q         subscript  p  0     p  q     p_{0}=p+q\,       In a mixture of ideal gases , total pressure refers to the sum of each gas' partial pressure .
