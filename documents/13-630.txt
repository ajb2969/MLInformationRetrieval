This color progression is intended to represent the phase progression of a quantum wave function . The left side of each animation represents the object in three-dimensional space , with the x and y axes respectively running horizontally and vertically. The right side represents the object in spacetime , with the x-axis running horizontally and time running vertically. The horizontal line through each animation represents the x-axis. |- | |- style="vertical-align:top;background-color:#ffffec;" align="full" |The images immediately above are still frames taken from the animations far above. The following physical variables have been marked on the images:      V  0     subscript  V  0    V_{0}   : the “rest volume” of the stone (volume when not moving).     V   V   V   : the volume of the stone when in motion.     λ   λ   \lambda   : the quantum wavelength ( Planck's constant / momentum ).      τ  0     subscript  τ  0    \tau_{0}   : the “rest period” of the stone ( Planck's constant / rest energy).      τ  H     subscript  τ  H    \tau_{H}   : the Hamiltonian period ( Planck's constant / total energy ).      τ  L     subscript  τ  L    \tau_{L}   : the Lagrangian period.  As the stone’s speed approaches the speed of light, the stone’s volume decreases (shrinks in the direction of motion) due to relativistic length contraction . Motion also causes the wavelength to decrease (reflecting an increase in momentum) and the Hamiltonian period to decrease (reflecting an increase in kinetic energy). The Lagrangian period increases with speed. |}"
