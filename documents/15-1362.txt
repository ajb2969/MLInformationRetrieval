23S rRNA (guanine2069-N7)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (guanine2069-N7)-methyltransferase (, rlmK (gene), 23S rRNA m7G2069 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine2069-N7)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine2069 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N7-methylguanine2069 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates guanine2069 at position N7 in 23S rRNA.
