   23S rRNA (guanine2069-N7)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (guanine2069-N7)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (guanine 2069 -N 7 )-methyltransferase (, rlmK (gene) , 23S rRNA m7G2069 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine 2069 -N 7 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 2069 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 7 -methylguanine 2069 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates guanine 2069 at position N 7 in 23S rRNA.
