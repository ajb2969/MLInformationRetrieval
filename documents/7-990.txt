   Mass index      Mass index   The mass index is an indicator, developed by Donald Dorsey , used in technical analysis to predict trend reversals. It is based on the notion that there is a tendency for reversal when the price range widens, and therefore compares previous trading ranges (highs minus lows).  Mass index for a commodity is obtained 1 by calculating its exponential moving average over a 9 day period and the exponential moving average of this average (a "double" average), and summing the ratio of these two over a given amount of days (usually 25).       M  a  s  s   =   S  u  m   [  25  ]   o   f     E  M  A   [  9  ]   o   f    (    h  i  g  h   -   l  o  w    )     E  M  A   [  9  ]   o   f   E  M  A   [  9  ]   o   f    (    h  i  g  h   -   l  o  w    )            M  a  s  s     S  u  m   delimited-[]  25   o  f      E  M  A   delimited-[]  9   o  f      h  i  g  h     l  o  w       E  M  A   delimited-[]  9   o  f  E  M  A   delimited-[]  9   o  f      h  i  g  h     l  o  w         Mass=Sum[25]\;of\;{EMA[9]\;of\;(high-low)\over EMA[9]\,of\,EMA[9]\;of\;(high-%
 low)}     Generally the EMA and the re-smoothed EMA of EMA are fairly close, making their ratio is roughly 1 and the sum around 25.  According to Dorsey, a so-called "reversal bulge" is a probable signal of trend reversal (regardless of the trend's direction). 2 Such a bulge takes place when a 25-day mass index reaches 27.0 and then falls to below 26 (or 26.5). A 9-day prime moving average is usually used to determine whether the bulge is a buy or sell signal.  This formula uses intraday range values: not the "true range," which adjusts for full and partial gaps. Also, the "bulge" does not indicate direction.
