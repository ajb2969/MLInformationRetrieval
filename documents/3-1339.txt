   Regular sequence      Regular sequence   In commutative algebra , a regular sequence is a sequence of elements of a commutative ring which are as independent as possible, in a precise sense. This is the algebraic analogue of the geometric notion of a complete intersection .  Definitions  For a commutative ring R and an R - module  M , an element r in R is called a '''non-zero-divisor on M ''' if r m = 0 implies m = 0 for m in M . An ''' M -regular sequence''' is a sequence   r 1 , ..., r d in R    such that r i is a non-zero-divisor on M /( r 1 , ..., r i -1 ) M for i = 1, ..., d . 1 Some authors also require that M /( r 1 , ..., r d ) M is not zero. Intuitively, to say that r 1 , ..., r d is an M -regular sequence means that these elements "cut M down" as much as possible, when we pass successively from M to M /( r 1 ) M , to M /( r 1 , r 2 ) M , and so on.  An R -regular sequence is called simply a regular sequence . That is, r 1 , ..., r d is a regular sequence if r 1 is a non-zero-divisor in R , r 2 is a non-zero-divisor in the ring R /( r 1 ), and so on. In geometric language, if X is an affine scheme and r 1 , ..., r d is a regular sequence in the ring of regular functions on X , then we say that the closed subscheme { r 1 =0, ..., r d =0} ⊂ X is a complete intersection subscheme of X .  For example, x , y (1- x ), z (1- x ) is a regular sequence in the polynomial ring C [ x , y , z ], while y (1- x ), z (1- x ), x is not a regular sequence. But if R is a Noetherian  local ring and the elements r i are in the maximal ideal, or if R is a graded ring and the r i are homogeneous of positive degree, then any permutation of a regular sequence is a regular sequence.  Let R be a Noetherian ring, I an ideal in R , and M a finitely generated R -module. The depth of I on M , written depth R ( I , M ) or just depth( I , M ), is the supremum of the lengths of all M -regular sequences of elements of I . When R is a Noetherian local ring and M is a finitely generated R -module, the depth of M , written depth R ( M ) or just depth( M ), means depth R ( m , M ); that is, it is the supremum of the lengths of all M -regular sequences in the maximal ideal m of R . In particular, the depth of a Noetherian local ring R means the depth of R as a R -module. That is, the depth of R is the maximum length of a regular sequence in the maximal ideal.  For a Noetherian local ring R , the depth of the zero module is ∞, 2 whereas the depth of a nonzero finitely generated R -module M is at most the Krull dimension of M (also called the dimension of the support of M ). 3  Examples   For a prime number p , the local ring Z ( p ) is the subring of the rational numbers consisting of fractions whose denominator is not a multiple of p . The element p is a non-zero-divisor in Z ( p ) , and the quotient ring of Z ( p ) by the ideal generated by p is the field Z /( p ). Therefore p cannot be extended to a longer regular sequence in the maximal ideal ( p ), and in fact the local ring Z ( p ) has depth 1.    For any field k , the elements x 1 , ..., x n in the polynomial ring A = k [ x 1 , ..., x n ] form a regular sequence. It follows that the localization  R of A at the maximal ideal m = ( x 1 , ..., x n ) has depth at least n . In fact, R has depth equal to n ; that is, there is no regular sequence in the maximal ideal of length greater than n .    More generally, let R be a regular local ring with maximal ideal m . Then any elements r 1 , ..., r d of m which map to a basis for m / m 2 as an R / m -vector space form a regular sequence.   An important case is when the depth of a local ring R is equal to its Krull dimension : R is then said to be Cohen-Macaulay . The three examples shown are all Cohen-Macaulay rings. Similarly, a finitely generated R -module M is said to be Cohen-Macaulay if its depth equals its dimension.  Applications   If r 1 , ..., r d is a regular sequence in a ring R , then the Koszul complex is an explicit free resolution of R /( r 1 , ..., r d ) as an R -module, of the form:       0  →   R   (      d      d      )    →  ⋯  →   R   (      d      1      )    →  R  →   R  /   (   r  1   ,  …  ,   r  d   )    →  0       normal-→  0   superscript  R   binomial  d  d      normal-→    normal-⋯    normal-→     superscript  R   binomial  d  1      normal-→    R    normal-→      R    subscript  r  1   normal-…   subscript  r  d       normal-→    0     0\rightarrow R^{{\left({{d}\atop{d}}\right)}}\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow R^{{%
 \left({{d}\atop{1}}\right)}}\rightarrow R\rightarrow R/(r_{1},\ldots,r_{d})\rightarrow
 0     In the special case where R is the polynomial ring k [ r 1 , ..., r d ], this gives a resolution of k as an R -module.   If I is an ideal generated by a regular sequence in a ring R , then the associated graded ring        ⊕   j  ≥  0      I  j   /   I   j  +  1         subscript  direct-sum    j  0       superscript  I  j    superscript  I    j  1       \oplus_{j\geq 0}I^{j}/I^{j+1}     is isomorphic to the polynomial ring ( R / I )[ x 1 , ..., x d ]. In geometric terms, it follows that a local complete intersection subscheme Y of any scheme X has a normal bundle which is a vector bundle, even though Y may be singular.
