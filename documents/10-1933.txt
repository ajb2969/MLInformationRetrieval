4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-oxalocrotonate 
 
 
 
  2-oxopent-4-enoate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-oxalocrotonate, and two products, 2-oxopent-4-enoate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-oxalocrotonate carboxy-lyase (2-oxopent-4-enoate-forming). This enzyme is also called 4-oxalocrotonate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: benzoate degradation via hydroxylation, toluene and xylene degradation, and fluorene degradation.
