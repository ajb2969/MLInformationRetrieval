Glossary of module theory

Module theory is the branch of mathematics in which modules are studied. This is a glossary of some terms of the subject.
Basic definition

left R-module
A left module 
 
 
 
  over the ring

 
  is an abelian group

 
  with an operation 
 
 
 
  (called scalar multipliction) satisfies the following condition:
 
 

 
 ,














right R-module
A right module 
 
 
 
  over the ring 
 
 
 
  is an abelian group 
 
 
 
  with an operation 
 
 
 
  satisfies the following condition:
 
 

 
 ,














Or it can be defined as the left module 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  (the opposite ring of 
 
 
 
 ).
 


bimodule
If an abelian group 
 
 
 
  is both a left 
 
 
 
 -module and right 
 
 
 
 -module, it can be made to a 
 
 
 
 -bimodule if 
 
 
 
 .
 


submodule
Given 
 
 
 
  is a left 
 
 
 
 -module, a subgroup 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a submodule if 
 
 
 
  .
 


homomorphism of 
 
 
 
 -modules
For two left 
 
 
 
 -modules 
 
 
 
 , a group homomorphism 
 
 
 
  is called homomorphism of 
 
 
 
 -modules if 
 
 
 
  .
 


quotient module
Given a left 
 
 
 
 -modules 
 
 
 
 , a submodule 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  can be made to a left 
 
 
 
 -module by 
 
 
 
  . It is also called a factor module.
 


annihilator
The annihilator of a left 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is the set 
 
 
 
  . It is a (left) ideal of 
 
 
 
 .
 
The annihilator of an element 
 
 
 
  is the set 
 
 
 
 .
 

Types of modules

finitely generated module
A module 
 
 
 
  is finitely generated if there exist finitely many elements 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that every element of 
 
 
 
  is a finite linear combination of those elements with coefficients from the scalar ring 
 
 
 
 .
 


cyclic module
A module is called a cyclic module if it is generated by one element.
 


free module
A free module is a module that has a basis, or equivalently, one that is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the scalar ring 
 
 
 
 .
 
basis
A basis of a module 
 
 
 
  is a set of elements in 
 
 
 
  such that every element in the module can be expressed as a finite sum of elements in the basis in a unique way.
 




Projective module
A 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is called a projective module if given a 
 
 
 
 -module homomorphism 
 
 
 
 , and a surjective

 
 -module homomorphism 
 
 
 
 , there exists a 
 
 
 
 -module homomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  .
 

(Figure)
The characteristic property of projective modules is called lifting.

::The following conditions are equivalent:
:* The covariant functor 
 
 
 
  is exact.
:* 
 
 
 
  is a projective module.
:* Every short exact sequence 
 
 
 
  is split.
:* 
 
 
 
  is a direct summand of free modules.

In particular, every free module is projective.
 


injective module
A 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is called an injective module if given a 
 
 
 
 -module homomorphism 

X \to Q, and an injective

 
 -module homomorphism 
 
 
 
 , there exists a 
 
 
 
 -module homomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  . 
::The following conditions are equivalent:
:* The contravariant functor 
 
 
 
  is exact.
:* 
 
 
 
  is a injective module.
:* Every short exact sequence 
 
 
 
  is split.

flat module
A 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is called a flat module if the tensor product functor 
 
 
 
  is exact.
 
In particular, every projective module is flat.
 


simple module
A simple module is a nonzero module whose only submodules are zero and itself.
 


indecomposable module
An indecomposable module is a non-zero module that cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero submodules. Every simple module is indecomposable.
 


principal indecomposable module
A cyclic indecomposable projective module is known as a PIM.
 


semisimple module
A module is called semisimple if it is the direct sum of simple submodules.
 


faithful module
A faithful module 
 
 
 
  is one where the action of each nonzero 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is nontrivial (i.e. 
 
 
 
  for some x in M). Equivalently, 
 
 
 
  is the zero ideal.
 


Noetherian module
A Noetherian module is a module such that every submodule is finitely generated. Equivalently, every increasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.
 


Artinian module
An Artinian module is a module in which every decreasing chain of submodules becomes stationary after finitely many steps.
 


finite length module
A module which is both Artinian and Noetherian has additional special properties.
 


graded module
A module 
 
 
 
  over a graded ring 
 
 
 
  is a graded module if 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a direct sum 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  .
 


invertible module
Roughly synonymous to rank 1 projective module.
 


uniform module
Module in which every two non-zero submodules have a non-zero intersection.
 


algebraically compact module (pure injective module)
Modules in which all systems of equations can be decided by finitary means. Alternatively, those modules which leave pure-exact sequence exact after applying Hom.
 


injective cogenerator
An injective module such that every module has a nonzero homomorphism into it.
 


irreducible module
synonymous to "simple module"
 


completely reducible module
synonymous to "semisimple module"
 

Operations on modules

Essential extension
An extension in which every nonzero submodule of the larger module meets the smaller module in a nonzero submodule.
 


Injective envelope
A maximal essential extension, or a minimal embedding in an injective module
 


Projective cover
A minimal surjection from a projective module.
 


Socle
The largest semisimple submodule
 


Radical of a module
The intersection of the maximal submodules. For Artinian modules, the smallest submodule with semisimple quotient.
