Choquet integral
A '''Choquet integral''' is a [[subadditive]] or [[superadditive]] integral created by the French mathematician [[Gustave Choquet]] in 1953.{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Choquet |title=Theory of capacities |journal=Ann. Inst. Fourier, Grenoble |volume=5 |year=1953 |issue= |pages=131–295 }} It was initially used in [[statistical mechanic
 s]] and potential theory,1 but found its way into decision theory in the 1980s,2 where it is used as a way of measuring the expected utility of an uncertain event. It is applied specifically to membership functions and capacities. In imprecise probability theory, the Choquet integral is also used to calculate the lower expectation induced by a 2-monotone lower probability, or the upper expectation induced by a 2-alternating upper probability.
Using the Choquet integral to denote the expected utility of belief functions measured with capacities is a way to reconcile the Ellsberg paradox and the Allais paradox.34
Definition
More specifically, let 
 
 
 
  be a set, and let 
 
 
 
  be any collection of subsets of 
 
 
 
 . Consider a function 
 
 
 
  and a monotone set function

 
 .
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is measurable with respect to 
 
 
 
 , that is



Then the Choquet integral of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  is defined by:



where the integrals on the right-hand side are the usual Riemann integral (the integrands are integrable because they are monotone in 
 
 
 
 ).
Properties
In general the Choquet integral does not satisfy additivity. More specifically, if 
 
 
 
  is not a probability measure, it may hold that



for some functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The Choquet integral does satisfy the following properties.
Monotonicity
If 
 
 
 
  then



Positive homogeneity
For all 
 
 
 
  it holds that



Comonotone additivity
If 
 
 
 
  are comonotone functions, that is, if for all 
 
 
 
  it holds that


 
 . then



Subadditivity
If 
 
 
 
  is 2-alternating, then



Superadditivity
If 
 
 
 
  is 2-monotone, then



Alternative Representation
Let 
 
 
 
  denote a cumulative distribution function such that 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  integrable. Then this following formula is often referred to as Choquet Integral:
