   Pterocarpin synthase      Pterocarpin synthase   In enzymology , a pterocarpin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   medicarpin + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   vestitone + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are medicarpin , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are vestitone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is medicarpin:NADP + 2'-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called pterocarpan synthase . This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis .
