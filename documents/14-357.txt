   Interlocking interval topology      Interlocking interval topology   In mathematics, and especially general topology , the interlocking interval topology is an example of a topology on the set , i.e. the set of all positive real numbers that are not positive whole numbers . 1 To give the set S a topology means to say which subsets of S are "open", and to do so in a way that the following axioms are met: 2   The union of open sets is an open set.  The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.  S and the empty set ∅ are open sets.   Construction  The open sets in this topology are taken to be the whole set S , the empty set ∅, and the sets generated by        X  n   :=    (  0  ,   1  n   )   ∪   (  n  ,   n  +  1   )    =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  +    :   0  <  x  <     1  n     or   n   <  x  <   n  +  1    }    .       assign   subscript  X  n      0    1  n     n    n  1           conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ         0  x           1  n   or  n        x         n  1         X_{n}:=\left(0,\frac{1}{n}\right)\cup(n,n+1)=\left\{x\in{\mathbb{R}}^{+}:0     The sets generated by X n will be formed by all possible unions of finite intersections of the X n . 3  References     "  Category:General topology  Category:Topological spaces     Steen & Seebach (1978) pp.77 – 78 ↩  Steen & Seebach (1978) p.3 ↩  Steen & Seebach (1978) p.4 ↩
