Interlocking interval topology

In mathematics, and especially general topology, the interlocking interval topology is an example of a topology on the set , i.e. the set of all positive real numbers that are not positive whole numbers.1 To give the set S a topology means to say which subsets of S are "open", and to do so in a way that the following axioms are met:2

The union of open sets is an open set.
The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.
S and the empty set ∅ are open sets.

Construction
The open sets in this topology are taken to be the whole set S, the empty set ∅, and the sets generated by



The sets generated by Xn will be formed by all possible unions of finite intersections of the Xn.3
