   Benzil reductase ((R)-benzoin forming)      Benzil reductase ((R)-benzoin forming)   Benzil reductase ((R)-benzoin forming) () is an enzyme with system name (R)-benzoin:NADP + oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (R)- benzoin + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    benzil + NADPH + H +    The bacterial enzyme ( Xanthomonas oryzae ) enantioselectively reduces one of the two carbonyl groups of benzil to form optically active (R)-benzoin.
