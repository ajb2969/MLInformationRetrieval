   Perfect totient number      Perfect totient number   In number theory , a perfect totient number is an integer that is equal to the sum of its iterated totients . That is, we apply the totient function to a number n , apply it again to the resulting totient, and so on, until the number 1 is reached, and add together the resulting sequence of numbers; if the sum equals n , then n is a perfect totient number. Or to put it algebraically, if       n  =    ∑   i  =  1    c  +  1      φ  i    (  n  )      ,      n    superscript   subscript     i  1      c  1       superscript  φ  i   n      n=\sum_{i=1}^{c+1}\varphi^{i}(n),   where       φ  i    (  n  )   =   {      φ   (  n  )        if  i   =  1        φ   (    φ   i  -  1     (  n  )    )      otherwise         fragments   superscript  φ  i    fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)     fragments  normal-{      φ  n       if  i   1       φ     superscript  φ    i  1    n    otherwise       \varphi^{i}(n)=\left\{\begin{matrix}\varphi(n)&\mbox{ if }i=1\\
 \varphi(\varphi^{i-1}(n))&\mbox{ otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.   is the iterated totient function and c is the integer such that         φ  c    (  n  )    =  2   ,         superscript  φ  c   n   2    \displaystyle\varphi^{c}(n)=2,   then n is a perfect totient number.  The first few perfect totient numbers are   3 , 9 , 15 , 27 , 39 , 81 , 111 , 183 , 243 , 255 , 327 , 363 , 471, 729 , 2187, 2199, 3063, 4359, 4375, ... .   For example, start with 327. Then φ(327) = 216, φ(216) = 72, φ(72) = 24, φ(24) = 8, φ(8) = 4, φ(4) = 2, φ(2) = 1, and 216 + 72 + 24 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 327.  Multiples and powers of three  It can be observed that many perfect totient are multiples of 3; in fact, 4375 is the smallest perfect totient number that is not divisible by 3. All powers of 3 are perfect totient numbers, as may be seen by induction using the fact that        φ   (   3  k   )    =   φ   (   2  ×   3  k    )    =   2  ×   3   k  -  1      .          φ   superscript  3  k      φ    2   superscript  3  k            2   superscript  3    k  1        \displaystyle\varphi(3^{k})=\varphi(2\times 3^{k})=2\times 3^{k-1}.     Venkataraman (1975) found another family of perfect totient numbers: if p = 4×3 k +1 is prime, then 3 p is a perfect totient number. The values of k leading to perfect totient numbers in this way are   0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 39, 201, 249, 1005, 1254, 1635, ... .   More generally if p is a prime number greater than 3, and 3 p is a perfect totient number, then p ≡ 1 (mod 4) (Mohan and Suryanarayana 1982). Not all p of this form lead to perfect totient numbers; for instance, 51 is not a perfect totient number. Iannucci et al. (2003) showed that if 9 p is a perfect totient number then p is a prime of one of three specific forms listed in their paper. It is not known whether there are any perfect totient numbers of the form 3 k p where p is prime and k > 3.  References                    "  Category:Integer sequences
