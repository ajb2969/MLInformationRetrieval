Stumpff function

In celestial mechanics, the Stumpff functions ck(x), developed by Karl Stumpff, are used for analyzing orbits using the universal variable formulation.1 They are defined by the formula:


 
  for 
 
 
 
  The series above converges absolutely for all real x.
By comparing the Taylor series expansion of the trigonometric functions sin and cos with c0(x) and c1(x), a relationship can be found:





 
  Similarly, by comparing with the expansion of the hyperbolic functions sinh and cosh we find:






The Stumpff functions satisfy the recursive relations:
