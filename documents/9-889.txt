   Hardy–Littlewood maximal function      Hardy–Littlewood maximal function   In mathematics , the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator  M is a significant non-linear operator used in real analysis and harmonic analysis . It takes a locally integrable function f : R d → C and returns another function Mf that, at each point x ∈ R d , gives the maximum average value that f can have on balls centered at that point. More precisely,       M  f   (  x  )    =    sup   r  >  0      1   |   B   (  x  ,  r  )    |      ∫   B   (  x  ,  r  )       |   f   (  y  )    |   d  y            M  f  x     subscript  supremum    r  0        1      B   x  r        subscript     B   x  r           f  y    d  y        Mf(x)=\sup_{r>0}\frac{1}{|B(x,r)|}\int_{B(x,r)}|f(y)|\,dy     where B ( x , r ) is the ball of radius r centred at x , and | E | denotes the d -dimensional Lebesgue measure of E ⊂ R d .  The averages are jointly continuous in x and r , therefore the maximal function Mf , being the supremum over r > 0, is measurable . It is not obvious that Mf is finite almost everywhere. This is a corollary of the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality  Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality  This theorem of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood states that M is bounded as a sublinear operator from the L p ( R d ) to itself for p > 1. That is, if f ∈ L p ( R d ) then the maximal function Mf is weak L 1 -bounded and Mf ∈ L p ( R d ). Before stating the theorem more precisely, for simplicity, let { f > t } denote the set { x | f ( x ) > t }. Now we have:   Theorem (Weak Type Estimate). For d ≥ 1 and f ∈ L 1 ( R d ), there is a constant C d > 0 such that for all λ > 0, we have:      |   {  M  f  >  λ  }   |  <    C  d   λ   ∥  f   ∥    L  1    (   𝐑  d   )     .     fragments  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  M  f   λ  normal-}   normal-|      subscript  C  d   λ   parallel-to  f   subscript  parallel-to     superscript  L  1    superscript  𝐑  d     normal-.    \left|\{Mf>\lambda\}\right|<\frac{C_{d}}{\lambda}\|f\|_{L^{1}(\mathbf{R}^{d})}.      With the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality in hand, the following strong-type estimate is an immediate consequence of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem :   Theorem (Strong Type Estimate). For d ≥ 1, 1 p''( R d ), there is a constant C p,d > 0 such that         ∥   M  f   ∥     L  p    (   𝐑  d   )     ≤    C   p  ,  d      ∥  f  ∥     L  p    (   𝐑  d   )       .       subscript   norm    M  f       superscript  L  p    superscript  𝐑  d        subscript  C   p  d     subscript   norm  f      superscript  L  p    superscript  𝐑  d        \|Mf\|_{L^{p}(\mathbf{R}^{d})}\leq C_{p,d}\|f\|_{L^{p}(\mathbf{R}^{d})}.      In the strong type estimate the best bounds for C p,d are unknown. 1 However subsequently Elias M. Stein used the Calderón-Zygmund method of rotations to prove the following:   Theorem (Dimension Independence). For 1 p,d'' = C p independent of d . 2 3   Proof  While there are several proofs of this theorem, a common one is given below: For p = ∞, the inequality is trivial (since the average of a function is no larger than its essential supremum ). For 1 Lemma. Let X be a separable metric space and   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   family of open balls with bounded diameter. Then   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   has a countable subfamily    ℱ  ′     superscript  ℱ  normal-′    \mathcal{F}^{\prime}   consisting of disjoint balls such that        ⋃   B  ∈  ℱ    B   ⊂    ⋃   B  ∈   ℱ  ′      5  B          subscript     B  ℱ    B     subscript     B   superscript  ℱ  normal-′       5  B      \bigcup_{B\in\mathcal{F}}B\subset\bigcup_{B\in\mathcal{F^{\prime}}}5B   where 5 B is B with 5 times radius.  If Mf ( x ) > t , then, by definition, we can find a ball B x centered at x such that         ∫   B  x      |  f  |   d  y    >   t   |   B  x   |     .        subscript    subscript  B  x        f   d  y      t     subscript  B  x       \int_{B_{x}}|f|dy>t|B_{x}|.   By the lemma, we can find, among such balls, a sequence of disjoint balls B j such that the union of 5 B j covers { Mf > t }. It follows:      |   {  M  f  >  t  }   |  ≤   5  d    ∑  j   |   B  j   |  ≤    5  d   t   ∫  |  f  |  d  y  .     fragments  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  M  f   t  normal-}   normal-|    superscript  5  d    subscript   j   normal-|   subscript  B  j   normal-|      superscript  5  d   t    normal-|  f  normal-|  d  y  normal-.    |\{Mf>t\}|\leq 5^{d}\sum_{j}|B_{j}|\leq{5^{d}\over t}\int|f|dy.   This completes the proof of the weak-type estimate. We next deduce from this the L p bounds. Define b by b ( x ) = f ( x ) if | f ( x )| > t /2 and 0 otherwise. By the weak-type estimate applied to b , we have:      |   {  M  f  >  t  }   |  ≤    2  C   t    ∫    |  f  |   >   t  2     |  f  |  d  x  ,     fragments  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  M  f   t  normal-}   normal-|       2  C   t    subscript       f     t  2     normal-|  f  normal-|  d  x  normal-,    |\{Mf>t\}|\leq{2C\over t}\int_{|f|>\frac{t}{2}}|f|dx,   with C = 5 d . Then      ∥  M  f   ∥  p  p   =  ∫   ∫  0   M  f   (  x  )     p   t   p  -  1    d  t  d  x  =  p   ∫  0  ∞    t   p  -  1    |   {  M  f  >  t  }   |  d  t     fragments  parallel-to  M  f   superscript   subscript  parallel-to  p   p      superscript   subscript   0     M  f  x    p   superscript  t    p  1    d  t  d  x   p   superscript   subscript   0      superscript  t    p  1    normal-|   fragments  normal-{  M  f   t  normal-}   normal-|  d  t    \|Mf\|_{p}^{p}=\int\int_{0}^{Mf(x)}pt^{p-1}dtdx=p\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{p-1}|\{Mf%

 _{p}\|f\|_{p}^{p}   where the constant C p depends only on p and d . This completes the proof of the theorem.  Note that the constant    C  =   5  d       C   superscript  5  d     C=5^{d}   in the proof can be improved to    3  d     superscript  3  d    3^{d}   by using the inner regularity of the Lebesgue measure , and the finite version of the Vitali covering lemma . See the Discussion section below for more about optimizing the constant.  Applications  Some applications of the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Inequality include proving the following results:   Lebesgue differentiation theorem  Rademacher differentiation theorem  Fatou's theorem on nontangential convergence.  Fractional integration theorem   Here we use a standard trick involving the maximal function to give a quick proof of Lebesgue differentiation theorem. (But remember that in the proof of the maximal theorem, we used the Vitali covering lemma.) Let f ∈ L 1 ( R n ) and       Ω  f   (  x  )    =     lim sup   r  →  0      f  r    (  x  )     -    lim inf   r  →  0      f  r    (  x  )            normal-Ω  f  x       subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  r  0       subscript  f  r   x      subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  r  0       subscript  f  r   x       \Omega f(x)=\limsup_{r\to 0}f_{r}(x)-\liminf_{r\to 0}f_{r}(x)     where         f  r    (  x  )    =    1   |   B   (  x  ,  r  )    |      ∫   B   (  x  ,  r  )      f   (  y  )   d  y      .         subscript  f  r   x       1      B   x  r        subscript     B   x  r       f  y  d  y       f_{r}(x)=\frac{1}{|B(x,r)|}\int_{B(x,r)}f(y)dy.     We write f = h + g where h is continuous and has compact support and g ∈ L 1 ( R n ) with norm that can be made arbitrary small. Then       Ω  f   ≤    Ω  g   +   Ω  h    =   Ω  g           normal-Ω  f       normal-Ω  g     normal-Ω  h           normal-Ω  g      \Omega f\leq\Omega g+\Omega h=\Omega g     by continuity. Now, Ω g ≤ 2 Mg and so, by the theorem, we have:      |   {  Ω  g  >  ε  }   |  ≤    2  A   ε   ∥  g   ∥  1      fragments  normal-|   fragments  normal-{  Ω  g   ε  normal-}   normal-|       2  A   ε   parallel-to  g   subscript  parallel-to  1     \left|\{\Omega g>\varepsilon\}\right|\leq\frac{2A}{\varepsilon}\|g\|_{1}     Now, we can let      ∥  g  ∥   1   →  0     normal-→   subscript   norm  g   1   0    \|g\|_{1}\to 0   and conclude Ω f = 0 almost everywhere; that is,     lim   r  →  0      f  r    (  x  )        subscript    normal-→  r  0       subscript  f  r   x     \lim_{r\to 0}f_{r}(x)   exists for almost all x . It remains to show the limit actually equals f ( x ). But this is easy: it is known that      ∥    f  r   -  f   ∥   1   →  0     normal-→   subscript   norm     subscript  f  r   f    1   0    \|f_{r}-f\|_{1}\to 0   ( approximation of the identity ) and thus there is a subsequence     f   r  k    →  f     normal-→   subscript  f   subscript  r  k    f    f_{r_{k}}\to f   almost everywhere. By the uniqueness of limit, f r → f almost everywhere then.  Discussion  It is still unknown what the smallest constants C p,d and C d are in the above inequalities. However, a result of Elias Stein about spherical maximal functions can be used to show that, for 1 p,d'' on the dimension, that is, C p,d = C p for some constant C p > 0 only depending on p . It is unknown whether there is a weak bound that is independent of dimension.  There are several common variants of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator which replace the averages over centered balls with averages over different families of sets. For instance, one can define the uncentered HL maximal operator (using the notation of Stein-Shakarchi)        f  *    (  x  )    =    sup   x  ∈   B  x       1   |   B  x   |      ∫   B  x      |   f   (  y  )    |   d  y             superscript  f    x     subscript  supremum    x   subscript  B  x         1     subscript  B  x       subscript    subscript  B  x          f  y    d  y        f^{*}(x)=\sup_{x\in B_{x}}\frac{1}{|B_{x}|}\int_{B_{x}}|f(y)|dy     where the balls B x are required to merely contain x, rather than be centered at x. There is also the dyadic HL maximal operator        M  Δ   f   (  x  )    =    sup   x  ∈   Q  x       1   |   Q  x   |      ∫   Q  x      |   f   (  y  )    |   d  y             subscript  M  normal-Δ   f  x     subscript  supremum    x   subscript  Q  x         1     subscript  Q  x       subscript    subscript  Q  x          f  y    d  y        M_{\Delta}f(x)=\sup_{x\in Q_{x}}\frac{1}{|Q_{x}|}\int_{Q_{x}}|f(y)|dy     where Q x ranges over all dyadic cubes containing the point x . Both of these operators satisfy the HL maximal inequality.  References     John B. Garnett , Bounded Analytic Functions . Springer-Verlag, 2006  Antonios D.
