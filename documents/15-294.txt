Tychonoff cube

In mathematics, more specifically in general topology, the Tychonoff cube is the generalization of the unit cube from the product of a finite number of unit intervals to the product of an infinite, even uncountable number of unit intervals. The Tychonoff cube is named after Andrey Tychonoff, who first considered the arbitrary product of topological spaces and who proved in the 1930s that the Tychonoff cube is compact. Tychonoff later generalized this to the product of collections of arbitrary compact spaces. This result is now known as Tychonoff's theorem and is considered one of the most important results in general topology.1
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the unit interval

 
 . Given a cardinal number

 
 , we define a Tychonoff cube of weight

 
  as the space 
 
 
 
  with the product topology, i.e. the product 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the cardinality of 
 
 
 
  and, for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
The Hilbert cube, 
 
 
 
 , is a special case of a Tychonoff cube.
Properties

The Tychonoff cube is compact.
Given a cardinal number

 
 , the space 
 
 
 
  is embeddable in

The Tychonoff cube 
 
 
 
  is a universal space for every compact space of weight
