   Tychonoff cube      Tychonoff cube   In mathematics , more specifically in general topology , the Tychonoff cube is the generalization of the unit cube from the product of a finite number of unit intervals to the product of an infinite, even uncountable number of unit intervals. The Tychonoff cube is named after Andrey Tychonoff , who first considered the arbitrary product of topological spaces and who proved in the 1930s that the Tychonoff cube is compact . Tychonoff later generalized this to the product of collections of arbitrary compact spaces. This result is now known as Tychonoff's theorem and is considered one of the most important results in general topology. 1  Definition  Let   I   I   I   denote the unit interval     [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   . Given a cardinal number     κ  ≥  ω      κ  ω    \kappa\geq\omega   , we define a Tychonoff cube of weight    κ   κ   \kappa   as the space    I  κ     superscript  I  κ    I^{\kappa}   with the product topology , i.e. the product     ∏   s  ∈  S     I  s       subscript  product    s  S     subscript  I  s     \prod_{s\in S}I_{s}   where   κ   κ   \kappa   is the cardinality of   S   S   S   and, for all    s  ∈  S      s  S    s\in S   ,     I  s   =  I       subscript  I  s   I    I_{s}=I   .  The Hilbert cube ,    I  ω     superscript  I  ω    I^{\omega}   , is a special case of a Tychonoff cube.  Properties   The Tychonoff cube is compact.  Given a cardinal number     λ  ≤  κ      λ  κ    \lambda\leq\kappa   , the space    I  λ     superscript  I  λ    I^{\lambda}   is embeddable in    I  κ     superscript  I  κ    I^{\kappa}   .  The Tychonoff cube    I  κ     superscript  I  κ    I^{\kappa}   is a universal space for every compact space of weight     κ  ≥  ω      κ  ω    \kappa\geq\omega   .  The Tychonoff cube    I  κ     superscript  I  κ    I^{\kappa}   is a universal space for every Tychonoff space of weight     κ  ≥  ω      κ  ω    \kappa\geq\omega   .  The character of    x  ∈   I  κ       x   superscript  I  κ     x\in I^{\kappa}   is   κ   κ   \kappa   .
