   TRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase      TRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing N 7 -methylguanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing N7-methyl guanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate guanine 7-methyltransferase , 7-methylguanine transfer ribonucleate methylase , tRNA guanine 7-methyltransferase , N7-methylguanine methylase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (guanine-7-N-)-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
