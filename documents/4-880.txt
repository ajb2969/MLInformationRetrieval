Cauchy product

In mathematics, the Cauchy product, named after Augustin Louis Cauchy, of two sequences

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , is the discrete convolution of the two sequences, the sequence 
 
 
 
  whose general term is given by



In other words, it is the sequence whose associated formal power series

 
  is the product of the two series similarly associated to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Series
A particularly important example is to consider the sequences 
 
 
 
  to be terms of two strictly formal (not necessarily convergent) series



usually, of real or complex numbers. Then the Cauchy product is defined by a discrete convolution as follows.


 
  for n = 0, 1, 2, ...
"Formal" means we are manipulating series in disregard of any questions of convergence. These need not be convergent series. See in particular formal power series.
One hopes, by analogy with finite sums, that in cases in which the two series do actually converge, the sum of the infinite series



is equal to the product



just as would work when each of the two sums being multiplied has only finitely many terms. This is not true in general, but see Mertens' Theorem and Cesàro's theorem below for some special cases.
Finite summations
The product of two finite series ak and bk with k between 0 and n satisfies the equation:



Convergence and Mertens' theorem
Let  and  be real or complex sequences. It was proved by Franz Mertens that, if the series 
 
 
converges to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  converges to 
 
 
 
 , and at least one of them converges absolutely, then their Cauchy product converges to 
 
 
 
 .
It is not sufficient for both series to be convergent; if both sequences are conditionally convergent, the Cauchy product does not have to converge towards the product of the two series, as the following example shows:
Example
Consider the two alternating series with



which are only conditionally convergent (the divergence of the series of the absolute values follows from the direct comparison test and the divergence of the harmonic series). The terms of their Cauchy product are given by



for every integer 
 
 
 
 . Since for every 
 
 
 
  we have the inequalities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , it follows for the square root in the denominator that 
 
 
 
 , hence, because there are 
 
 
 
  summands,



for every integer 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,  does not converge to zero as 
 
 
 
 
 , hence the series of the  diverges by the term test.
Proof of Mertens' theorem
Assume without loss of generality that the series of the 
 
 
 
  converges absolutely. Define the partial sums



with



Then



by rearrangement, hence
Fix 
 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  by absolute convergence, and since  converges to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  such that, for all integers 
 
 
 
 
 ,
(this is the only place where the absolute convergence is used). Since the series of the  converges, the individual  must converge to 0 by the term test. Hence there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  such that, for all integers 
 
 
 
 ,
Also, since  converges to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , there exists an integer 
 
 
 
 
  such that, for all integers 
 
 
 
 ,
Then, for all integers 
 
 
 
 , use the representation () for , split the sum in two parts, use the triangle inequality for the absolute value, and finally use the three estimates (), () and () to show that



By the definition of convergence of a series,  as required.
Examples
Finite series
Suppose 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Here the Cauchy product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is readily verified to be 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, for finite series (which are finite sums), Cauchy multiplication is direct multiplication of those series.
Infinite series

For some 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then




by definition and the binomial formula. Since, formally, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we have shown that 
 
 
 
 . Since the limit of the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is equal to the product of the limits of those series, we have proven the formula 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .

As a second example, let 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  so the Cauchy product 
 
 
 
  does not converge.

Cesàro's theorem
In cases where the two sequences are convergent but not absolutely convergent, the Cauchy product is still Cesàro summable. Specifically:
If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are real sequences with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then



This can be generalised to the case where the two sequences are not convergent but just Cesàro summable:
Theorem
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , suppose the sequence 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  summable with sum A and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  summable with sum B. Then their Cauchy product is 
 
 
 
  summable with sum AB.
Generalizations
All of the foregoing applies to sequences in 
 
 
 
  (complex numbers). The Cauchy product can be defined for series in the 
 
 
 
  spaces (Euclidean spaces) where multiplication is the inner product. In this case, we have the result that if two series converge absolutely then their Cauchy product converges absolutely to the inner product of the limits.
Products of finitely many infinite series
Let 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  (actually the following is also true for 
 
 
 
  but the statement becomes trivial in that case) and let 
 
 
 
  be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the 
 
 
 
 th one converge absolutely, and the 
 
 
 
 th one converges. Then the series


 
  converges and we have:



This statement can be proven by induction over 
 
 
 
 : The case for 
 
 
 
  is identical to the claim about the Cauchy product. This is our induction base.
The induction step goes as follows: Let the claim be true for an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the 
 
 
 
 th one converge absolutely, and the 
 
 
 
 th one converges. We first apply the induction hypothesis to the series 
 
 
 
 . We obtain that the series


 
  converges, and hence, by the triangle inequality and the sandwich criterion, the series


 
  converges, and hence the series


 
  converges absolutely. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, by what Mertens proved, and by renaming of variables, we have:


 
 
  Therefore, the formula also holds for 
 
 
 
 .
Relation to convolution of functions
One can also define the Cauchy product of doubly infinite sequences, thought of as functions on 
 
 
 
 . In this case the Cauchy product is not always defined: for instance, the Cauchy product of the constant sequence 1 with itself, 
 
 
 
  is not defined. This doesn't arise for singly infinite sequences, as these have only finite sums.
One has some pairings, for instance the product of a finite sequence with any sequence, and the product 
 
 
 
 . This is related to duality of Lp spaces.
