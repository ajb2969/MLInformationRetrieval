   CPCTC      CPCTC   (Figure)  Two congruent triangles   In geometry , "Corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent" ( CPCTC ) is the abbreviation of a theorem regarding congruent  triangles . 1 CPCTC states that if two or more triangles are proven congruent by any method , then all of their corresponding angles and sides are congruent as well. CPCTC is especially useful in proving various geometrical triangles and polygons. 2  If:       △  A  B  C   ≅   △  D  E   F          normal-△  A  B  C     normal-△  D  E  F     \triangle ABC\cong\triangle DEF\,     then the following statements are true:        A  B   ¯   ≅     D  E   ¯         normal-¯    A  B     normal-¯    D  E      \overline{AB}\cong\overline{DE}\,           B  C   ¯   ≅     E  F   ¯         normal-¯    B  C     normal-¯    E  F      \overline{BC}\cong\overline{EF}\,           A  C   ¯   ≅     D  F   ¯         normal-¯    A  C     normal-¯    D  F      \overline{AC}\cong\overline{DF}\,          ∠  B  A  C   ≅   ∠  E  D   F          normal-∠  B  A  C     normal-∠  E  D  F     \angle BAC\cong\angle EDF\,          ∠  A  B  C   ≅   ∠  D  E   F          normal-∠  A  B  C     normal-∠  D  E  F     \angle ABC\cong\angle DEF\,          ∠  B  C  A   ≅   ∠  E  F   D          normal-∠  B  C  A     normal-∠  E  F  D     \angle BCA\cong\angle EFD\,     A related theorem is CPCFC , in which "triangles" is replaced with "figures" so that the theorem applies to any polygon or polyhedron proven congruent. This proves congruence of 2 or more triangles.  References  External links   Dr. Math explains the importance of CPCTC   "  Category:Theorems in geometry  Category:Triangle geometry     ↩  ↩
