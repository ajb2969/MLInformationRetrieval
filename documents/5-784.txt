Two congruent triangles

In geometry, "Corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent" (CPCTC) is the abbreviation of a theorem regarding congruent triangles.1 CPCTC states that if two or more triangles are proven congruent by any method, then all of their corresponding angles and sides are congruent as well. CPCTC is especially useful in proving various geometrical triangles and polygons.2
If:



then the following statements are true:


















A related theorem is CPCFC, in which "triangles" is replaced with "figures" so that the theorem applies to any polygon or polyhedron proven congruent. This proves congruence of 2 or more triangles.
