   Pteridine reductase      Pteridine reductase   In enzymology , a pteridine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin + 2 NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   biopterin + 2 NADPH + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are biopterin , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include PTR1 , and pteridine reductase 1 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
