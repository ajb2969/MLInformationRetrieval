Laguerre formula

The Laguerre formula (named after Edmond Laguerre) provides the acute angle 
 
 
 
  between two proper real lines,12 as follows:



where:



 
 
  is the principal value of the complex logarithm


 
  is the cross-ratio of four collinear points


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the points at infinity of the lines


 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the intersections of the absolute conic, having equations 
 
 
 
 , with the line joining 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

The expression between vertical bars is a real number.
Laguerre formula can be useful in computer vision, since the absolute conic has an image on the retinal plane which is invariant under camera displacements, and the cross ratio of four collinear points is the same for their images on the retinal plane.
Derivation
It may be assumed that the lines go through the origin. Any isometry leaves the absolute conic invariant, this allows to take as the first line the x axis and the second line lying in the plane z=0. The homogeneous coordinates of the above four points are



respectively. Their nonhomogeneous coordinates on the infinity line of the plane z=0 are 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 0, 
 
 
 
 . (Exchanging 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  changes the cross ratio into its inverse, so the formula for 
 
 
 
 
  gives the same result.) Now from the formula of the cross ratio we have
