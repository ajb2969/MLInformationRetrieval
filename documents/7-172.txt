   Quadrature filter      Quadrature filter   In signal processing , a quadrature filter     q   (  t  )       q  t    q(t)   is the analytic representation of the impulse response     f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   of a real-valued filter:       q   (  t  )    =    f  a    (  t  )    =     (    δ   (  t  )    +   i   π  t     )   *  f    (  t  )            q  t      subscript  f  a   t                δ  t     i    π  t     f   t      q(t)=f_{a}(t)=\left(\delta(t)+{i\over\pi t}\right)*f(t)     If the quadrature filter    q   (  t  )       q  t    q(t)   is applied to a signal    s   (  t  )       s  t    s(t)   , the result is       h   (  t  )    =    (   q  *  s   )    (  t  )    =       (    δ   (  t  )    +   i   π  t     )   *  f    (  t  )    *  s    (  t  )            h  t       q  s   t                    δ  t     i    π  t     f   t   s   t      h(t)=(q*s)(t)=\left(\delta(t)+{i\over\pi t}\right)*f(t)*s(t)     which implies that    h   (  t  )       h  t    h(t)   is the analytic representation of     (   f  *  s   )    (  t  )         f  s   t    (f*s)(t)   .  Since   q   q   q   is an analytic signal, it is either zero or complex-valued. In practice, therefore,   q   q   q   is often implemented as two real-valued filters, which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the filter, respectively.  An ideal quadrature filter cannot have a finite support , but by choosing the function    f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   carefully, it is possible to design quadrature filters which are localized such that they can be approximated reasonably well by means of functions of finite support .  Applications  Estimation of analytic signal  Notice that the computation of an ideal analytic signal for general signals cannot be made in practice since it involves convolutions with the function      1   π  t       1    π  t     {1\over\pi t}     which is difficult to approximate as a filter which is either causal or of finite support , or both. According to the above result, however, it is possible to obtain an analytic signal by convolving the signal    s   (  t  )       s  t    s(t)   with a quadrature filter    q   (  t  )       q  t    q(t)   . Given that    q   (  t  )       q  t    q(t)   is designed with some care, it can be approximated by means of a filter which can be implemented in practice. The resulting function    h   (  t  )       h  t    h(t)   is the analytic signal of    f  *  s      f  s    f*s   rather than of   s   s   s   . This implies that   f   f   f   should be chosen such that convolution by   f   f   f   affects the signal as little as possible. Typically,    f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   is a band-pass filter, removing low and high frequencies, but allowing frequencies within a range which includes the interesting components of the signal to pass.  Single frequency signals  For single frequency signals (in practice narrow bandwidth signals) with frequency   ω   ω   \omega   the magnitude of the response of a quadrature filter equals the signal's amplitude A times the frequency function of the filter at frequency   ω   ω   \omega   .       h   (  t  )    =    (   s  *  q   )    (  t  )    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  ∞   ∞    S   (  u  )   Q   (  u  )    e   i  u  t    d  u     =    1   2  π      ∫   -  ∞   ∞    A  π   [    δ   (   u  +  ω   )    +   δ   (   u  -  ω   )     ]   Q   (  u  )    e   i  u  t    d  u     =           h  t       s  q   t            1    2  π      superscript   subscript            S  u  Q  u   superscript  e    i  u  t    d  u              1    2  π      superscript   subscript            A  π   delimited-[]      δ    u  ω      δ    u  ω      Q  u   superscript  e    i  u  t    d  u          absent     h(t)=(s*q)(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}S(u)Q(u)e^{iut}du=\frac{1}{%
 2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A\pi[\delta(u+\omega)+\delta(u-\omega)]Q(u)e^{iut}du=          =    A  2     ∫  0  ∞    δ   (   u  -  ω   )   Q   (  u  )    e   i  u  t    d  u     =    A  2   Q   (  ω  )    e   i  ω  t           absent      A  2     superscript   subscript   0       δ    u  ω   Q  u   superscript  e    i  u  t    d  u              A  2   Q  ω   superscript  e    i  ω  t        =\frac{A}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\delta(u-\omega)Q(u)e^{iut}du=\frac{A}{2}Q(\omega%

By choosing a suitable frequency function Q of the filter, we may generate known functions of the unknown frequency   ω   ω   \omega   which then can be estimated.
