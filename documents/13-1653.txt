   R. Tyrrell Rockafellar      R. Tyrrell Rockafellar   Ralph Tyrrell Rockafellar (born 1935) is one of the world's leaders in optimization theory and related fields of analysis and combinatorics . He is professor emeritus at the departments of mathematics and applied mathematics at the University of Washington, Seattle .  Prizes  Rockafellar received the John von Neumann Theory Prize from the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science and delivered the 1993 von Neumann lecture for the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  Rockafellar and his coauthor Roger J-B Wets were awarded the Frederick W. Lanchester Prize for 1997 by Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS).  The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) lists Rockafellar as a highly cited researcher . 1  Selected publications  Books    Rockafellar, R. Tyrrell. Conjugate duality and optimization .
