   Residue-class-wise affine group      Residue-class-wise affine group   In mathematics , specifically in group theory , residue-class-wise affine  groups are certain permutation groups  acting on   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   (the integers ), whose elements are bijective residue-class-wise affine mappings .  A mapping    f  :   ℤ  →  ℤ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℤ  ℤ     f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}   is called residue-class-wise affine if there is a nonzero integer   m   m   m   such that the restrictions of   f   f   f   to the residue classes (mod   m   m   m   ) are all affine . This means that for any residue class     r   (  m  )    ∈    ℤ  /  m   ℤ         r  m       ℤ  m   ℤ     r(m)\in\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}   there are coefficients      a   r   (  m  )     ,   b   r   (  m  )     ,   c   r   (  m  )      ∈  ℤ        subscript  a    r  m     subscript  b    r  m     subscript  c    r  m     ℤ    a_{r(m)},b_{r(m)},c_{r(m)}\in\mathbb{Z}   such that the restriction of the mapping   f   f   f   to the set      r   (  m  )    =   {   r  +   k  m    ∣   k  ∈  ℤ   }         r  m    conditional-set    r    k  m      k  ℤ      r(m)=\{r+km\mid k\in\mathbb{Z}\}   is given by        f  |    r   (  m  )     :     r   (  m  )    →  ℤ   ,   n  ↦      a   r   (  m  )     ⋅  n   +   b   r   (  m  )       c   r   (  m  )           normal-:   evaluated-at  f    r  m     formulae-sequence   normal-→    r  m   ℤ    maps-to  n       normal-⋅   subscript  a    r  m    n    subscript  b    r  m      subscript  c    r  m         f|_{r(m)}:r(m)\rightarrow\mathbb{Z},\ n\mapsto\frac{a_{r(m)}\cdot n+b_{r(m)}}{%
 c_{r(m)}}   .  Residue-class-wise affine groups are countable , and they are accessible to computational investigations . Many of them act multiply transitively on   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   or on subsets thereof.  A particularly basic type of residue-class-wise affine permutations are the class transpositions : given disjoint residue classes     r  1    (   m  1   )        subscript  r  1    subscript  m  1     r_{1}(m_{1})   and     r  2    (   m  2   )        subscript  r  2    subscript  m  2     r_{2}(m_{2})   , the corresponding class transposition is the permutation of   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   which interchanges     r  1   +   k   m  1         subscript  r  1     k   subscript  m  1      r_{1}+km_{1}   and     r  2   +   k   m  2         subscript  r  2     k   subscript  m  2      r_{2}+km_{2}   for every    k  ∈  ℤ      k  ℤ    k\in\mathbb{Z}   and which fixes everything else. Here it is assumed that    0  ≤   r  1   <   m  1         0   subscript  r  1         subscript  m  1      0\leq r_{1}   and that    0  ≤   r  2   <   m  2         0   subscript  r  2         subscript  m  2      0\leq r_{2}   .  The set of all class transpositions of   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}    generates a countable simple group which has the following properties:   It is not finitely generated .  Every finite group , every free product of finite groups and every free group of finite rank embeds into it.  The class of its subgroups is closed under taking direct products , under taking wreath products with finite groups, and under taking restricted wreath products with the infinite cyclic group .  It has finitely generated subgroups which do not have finite presentations .  It has finitely generated subgroups with algorithmically unsolvable  membership problem .  It has an uncountable series of simple subgroups which is parametrized by the sets of odd primes .   It is straightforward to generalize the notion of a residue-class-wise affine group to groups acting on suitable rings other than   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , though only little work in this direction has been done so far.  See also the Collatz conjecture , which is an assertion about a surjective , but not injective residue-class-wise affine mapping.  References and external links   Stefan Kohl.
