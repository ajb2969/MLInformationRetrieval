Actinomycin lactonase




Actinomycin lactonase

In enzymology, an actinomycin lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

actinomycin + H2O 
 
 
 
  actinomycinic monolactone
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are actinomycin and H2O, whereas its product is actinomycinic monolactone.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is actinomycin lactonohydrolase.
