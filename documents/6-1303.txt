   Circle bundle      Circle bundle   In mathematics , a circle bundle is a fiber bundle where the fiber is the circle     ùêí  1     superscript  ùêí  1    \scriptstyle\mathbf{S}^{1}   .  Oriented circle bundles are also known as principal U (1)-bundles . In physics , circle bundles are the natural geometric setting for electromagnetism . A circle bundle is a special case of a sphere bundle .  As 3-manifolds  Circle bundles over surfaces are an important example of 3-manifolds . A more general class of 3-manifolds is Seifert fiber spaces , which may be viewed as a kind of "singular" circle bundle, or as a circle bundle over a two-dimensional orbifold .  Relationship to electrodynamics  The Maxwell equations correspond to an electromagnetic field represented by a 2-form  F , with     œÄ  *   F       superscript  œÄ    F    \pi^{\!*}F   being cohomologous to zero. In particular, there always exists a 1-form  A such that         œÄ  *   F   =   d  A    .         superscript  œÄ    F     d  A     \pi^{\!*}F=dA.     Given a circle bundle P over M and its projection      œÄ  :   P  ‚Üí  M      normal-:  œÄ   normal-‚Üí  P  M     \pi:P\to M     one has the homomorphism       œÄ  *   :     H  2    (  M  ,  ‚Ñ§  )    ‚Üí    H  2    (  P  ,  ‚Ñ§  )        normal-:   superscript  œÄ     normal-‚Üí     superscript  H  2    M  ‚Ñ§       superscript  H  2    P  ‚Ñ§       \pi^{*}:H^{2}(M,\mathbb{Z})\to H^{2}(P,\mathbb{Z})     where    œÄ  *     superscript  œÄ     \pi^{\!*}   is the pullback . Each homomorphism corresponds to a Dirac monopole ; the integer cohomology groups correspond to the quantization of the electric charge .  Examples   The Hopf fibration is an example of a non-trivial circle bundle.    The unit normal bundle of a surface is another example of a circle bundle.    The unit normal bundle of a non-orientable surface is a circle bundle that is not a principal    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   bundle. Orientable surfaces have principal unit tangent bundles.   Classification  The isomorphism classes of circle bundles over a manifold M are in one-to-one correspondence with the homotopy classes of maps    M  ‚Üí   B   O  2       normal-‚Üí  M    B   subscript  O  2      M\to BO_{2}   . There is an extension of groups,     S   O  2    ‚Üí   O  2   ‚Üí   ‚Ñ§  2        normal-‚Üí    S   subscript  O  2     subscript  O  2     normal-‚Üí     subscript  ‚Ñ§  2      SO_{2}\to O_{2}\to\mathbb{Z}_{2}   , where     S   O  2    ‚â°   U   (  1  )          S   subscript  O  2      U  1     SO_{2}\equiv U(1)   . Circle bundles classified by maps into    B  U   (  1  )       B  U  1    BU(1)   are known as principal    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   -bundles, and are classified by an element element of the second integral cohomology group      H  2    (  M  ,  ‚Ñ§  )        superscript  H  2    M  ‚Ñ§     \scriptstyle H^{2}(M,\mathbb{Z})   of M , since     [  M  ,   B  U   (  1  )    ]   ‚â°   [  M  ,   ‚ÑÇ   P  ‚àû    ]   ‚â°    H  1    (  M  )           M    B  U  1     M    ‚ÑÇ   superscript  P              superscript  H  1   M      [M,BU(1)]\equiv[M,\mathbb{C}P^{\infty}]\equiv H^{1}(M)   . This isomorphism is realized by the Euler class . A circle bundle is a principal    U   (  1  )       U  1    U(1)   bundle if and only if the associated map    M  ‚Üí   B   ‚Ñ§  2       normal-‚Üí  M    B   subscript  ‚Ñ§  2      M\to B\mathbb{Z}_{2}   is null-homotopic, which is true if and only if the bundle is fibrewise orientable.
