   Vomilenine glucosyltransferase      Vomilenine glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a vomilenine glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + vomilenine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + raucaffricine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and vomilenine , whereas its two products are UDP and raucaffricine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:vomilenine 21-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called UDPG:vomilenine 21-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis .
