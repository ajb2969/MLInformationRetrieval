Disk covering problem

The disk covering problem asks for the smallest real number

 
  such that 
 
 
disks of radius 
 
 
 
  can be arranged in such a way as to cover the unit disk. Dually, for a given radius ε, one wishes to find the smallest integer n such that n disks of radius ε can cover the unit disk.1
The best solutions to date are as follows:
