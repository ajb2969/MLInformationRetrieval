   Singleton (mathematics)      Singleton (mathematics)   In mathematics , a singleton , also known as a unit set , 1 is a set with exactly one element. For example, the set {0} is a singleton.  The term is also used for a 1- tuple (a sequence with one element).  Properties  Within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory , the axiom of regularity guarantees that no set is an element of itself. This implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains, 2 thus 1 and {1} are not the same thing, and the empty set is distinct from the set containing only the empty set. A set such as {{1, 2, 3}} is a singleton as it contains a single element (which itself is a set, however, not a singleton).  A set is a singleton if and only if its cardinality is . In the standard set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers , the number 1 is defined as the singleton {0}.  In axiomatic set theory , the existence of singletons is a consequence of the axiom of pairing : for any set A , the axiom applied to A and A asserts the existence of { A , A }, which is the same as the singleton { A } (since it contains A , and no other set, as an element).  If A is any set and S is any singleton, then there exists precisely one function from A to S , the function sending every element of A to the single element of S . Thus every singleton is a terminal object in the category of sets .  A singleton has the property that every function from it to any arbitrary set is injective. The only non-singleton set with this property is the empty set .  In category theory  Structures built on singletons often serve as terminal objects or zero objects of various categories :   The statement above shows that the singleton sets are precisely the terminal objects in the category Set of sets . No other sets are terminal.  Any singleton admits a unique topological space structure (both subsets are open). These singleton topological spaces are terminal objects in the category of topological spaces and continuous functions . No other spaces are terminal in that category.  Any singleton admits a unique group structure (the unique element serving as identity element ). These singleton groups are zero objects in the category of groups and group homomorphisms . No other groups are terminal in that category.   Definition by indicator functions  Let   S   S   S   be a class defined by an indicator function      b  :   X  →   {  0  ,  1  }       normal-:  b   normal-→  X   0  1      b:X\to\{0,1\}   . Then   S   S   S   is called a singleton if and only if there is some    y  ∈  X      y  normal-∈  X    y∈X   such that for all    x  ∈  X      x  normal-∈  X    x∈X   ,      b   (  x  )   =   (  x  =  y  )      fragments  b   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-)     b(x)=(x=y)\,   .  Traditionally, this definition was introduced by Whitehead and Russell 3 along with the definition of the natural number 1 , as       1     =    def      α  ^    {   (  ∃  x  )   .  α  =  ι  ȷ  x  }      fragments  1    def  absent      normal-^  α    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   x  normal-)   normal-.  α   ι  ȷ  x  normal-}     1\ \overset{\underset{\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\ \hat{\alpha}\{(\exists x).\alpha=%
