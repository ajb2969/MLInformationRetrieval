(4S)-limonene synthase

In enzymology, a (4S)-limonene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (−)-(4S)-limonene + diphosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranyl diphosphate, and two products, (−)-(4S)-limonene and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing, (−)-(4S)-limonene-forming]. Other names in common use include (−)-(4S)-limonene synthase, 4S-(−)-limonene synthase, geranyldiphosphate diphosphate lyase (limonene forming), geranyldiphosphate diphosphate lyase [cyclizing,, and (4S)-limonene-forming]. This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis.
