   Quasi-analytic function      Quasi-analytic function   In mathematics , a quasi-analytic class of functions is a generalization of the class of real analytic functions based upon the following fact. If f is an analytic function on an interval [ a , b ] ⊂ R , and at some point f and all of its derivatives are zero, then f is identically zero on all of [ a , b ]. Quasi-analytic classes are broader classes of functions for which this statement still holds true.  Definitions  Let    M  =    {   M  k   }    k  =  0   ∞       M   superscript   subscript    subscript  M  k      k  0        M=\{M_{k}\}_{k=0}^{\infty}   be a sequence of positive real numbers. Then we define the class of functions C M ([ a , b ]) to be those f ∈ C ∞ ([ a , b ]) which satisfy       |      d  k   f    d   x  k      (  x  )    |   ≤    A   k  +  1     M  k                 superscript  d  k   f     d   superscript  x  k     x       superscript  A    k  1     subscript  M  k      \left|\frac{d^{k}f}{dx^{k}}(x)\right|\leq A^{k+1}M_{k}     for all x ∈ [ a , b ], some constant A , and all non-negative integers k . If M k = k ! this is exactly the class of real analytic functions on [ a , b ]. The class C M ([ a , b ]) is said to be quasi-analytic if whenever f ∈ C M ([ a , b ]) and          d  k   f    d   x  k      (  x  )    =  0             superscript  d  k   f     d   superscript  x  k     x   0    \frac{d^{k}f}{dx^{k}}(x)=0     for some point x ∈ [ a , b ] and all k , f is identically equal to zero.  A function f is called a quasi-analytic function if f is in some quasi-analytic class.  The Denjoy–Carleman theorem  The Denjoy–Carleman theorem, proved by  after  gave some partial results, gives criteria on the sequence M under which C M ([ a , b ]) is a quasi-analytic class. It states that the following conditions are equivalent:   C M ([ a , b ]) is quasi-analytic.       ∑   1  /   L  j     =  ∞          1   subscript  L  j        \sum 1/L_{j}=\infty   where     L  j   =    inf   k  ≥  j     M  k   1  /  k          subscript  L  j     subscript  infimum    k  j     superscript   subscript  M  k     1  k       L_{j}=\inf_{k\geq j}M_{k}^{1/k}   .        ∑  j     (   M  j  *   )    -   1  /  j      =  ∞        subscript   j    superscript   superscript   subscript  M  j         1  j         \sum_{j}(M_{j}^{*})^{-1/j}=\infty   , where M j * is the largest log convex sequence bounded above by M j .         ∑  j     M   j  -  1   *   /   M  j  *     =  ∞   .        subscript   j      superscript   subscript  M    j  1       superscript   subscript  M  j          \sum_{j}M_{j-1}^{*}/M_{j}^{*}=\infty.      The proof that the last two conditions are equivalent to the second uses Carleman's inequality .  Example:  pointed out that if M n is given by one of the sequences       n  n   ,    (   n   log  n    )   n   ,    (   n   log   n   log   log  n       )   n   ,     (   n   log   n   log   log   n   log   log   log  n           )   n   …       superscript  n  n    superscript    n    n    n    superscript    n      n      n       n      superscript    n      n        n        n           n   normal-…     n^{n},\,(n\log n)^{n},\,(n\log n\log\log n)^{n},\,(n\log n\log\log n\log\log%
 \log n)^{n}\dots   then the corresponding class is quasi-analytic. The first sequence gives analytic functions.  References          "  Category:Smooth functions
