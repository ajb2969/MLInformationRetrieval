   Engel identity      Engel identity   The Engel identity , named after Friedrich Engel , is a mathematical equation that is satisfied by all elements of a Lie ring , in the case of an Engel Lie ring, or by all the elements of a group , in the case of an Engel group . The Engel identity is the defining condition of an Engel group .  Formal definition  A Lie ring    L   L   L   is defined as a nonassociative ring with multiplication that is anticommutative and satisfies the Jacobi identity with respect to the Lie bracket     [  x  ,  y  ]     x  y    [x,y]   , defined for all elements    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   in the ring   L   L   L   . The Lie ring   L   L   L   is defined to be an n-Engel Lie ring if and only if   for all    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   in   L   L   L   , the n-Engel identity        [  x  ,   [  x  ,  …  ,   [  x  ,   [  x  ,  y  ]   ]   ,  …  ]   ]   =  0       x   x  normal-…   x   x  y    normal-…    0    [x,[x,\ldots,[x,[x,y]],\ldots]]=0   (n copies of   x   x   x   ), is satisfied. 1  In the case of a group    G   G   G   , in the preceding definition, use the definition  x −1 • y −1 • x • y }} and replace   0   0    by   1   1   1   , where   1   1   1   is the identity element of the group   G   G   G   . 2  See also   Adjoint representation  Efim Zelmanov  Engel's theorem   References  "  Category:Group theory  Category:Lie algebras     ↩  ↩
