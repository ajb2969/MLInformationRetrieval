Engel identity

The Engel identity, named after Friedrich Engel, is a mathematical equation that is satisfied by all elements of a Lie ring, in the case of an Engel Lie ring, or by all the elements of a group, in the case of an Engel group. The Engel identity is the defining condition of an Engel group.
Formal definition
A Lie ring

 
  is defined as a nonassociative ring with multiplication that is anticommutative and satisfies the Jacobi identity with respect to the Lie bracket

 
 , defined for all elements 
 
 
 
  in the ring 
 
 
 
 . The Lie ring 
 
 
 
  is defined to be an n-Engel Lie ring if and only if

for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , the n-Engel identity



 
  (n copies of 
 
 
 
 ), is satisfied.1
In the case of a group

 
 , in the preceding definition, use the definition  x−1 • y−1 • x • y}} and replace 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the identity element of the group
