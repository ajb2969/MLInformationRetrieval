   Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase      Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase   In enzymology , an arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   arachidonate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-(15S)-15-hydroperoxyicosa-5,8,11,13-tetraenoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arachidonate and O 2 , whereas its product is (5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-(15S)-15-hydroperoxyicosa-5,8,11,13-tetraenoate .  This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism .  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is arachidonate:oxygen 15-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 15-lipoxygenase , linoleic acid omega6-lipoxygenase , and omega6 lipoxygenase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
