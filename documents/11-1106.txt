Pyridoxamine—oxaloacetate transaminase

In enzymology, a pyridoxamine-oxaloacetate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

pyridoxamine + oxaloacetate 
 
 
 
  pyridoxal + L-aspartate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxamine and oxaloacetate, whereas its two products are pyridoxal and L-aspartate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxamine:oxaloacetate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in vitamin B6 metabolism.
