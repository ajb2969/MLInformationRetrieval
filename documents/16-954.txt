   Spherical wave transformation      Spherical wave transformation  '''Spherical wave transformations''' leave the form of [[spherical wave]]s as well as the laws of [[optics]] and [[electr odynamics]] invariant in all inertial frames. They were defined between 1908 and 1909 by Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham , with Bateman giving the transformation its name. 1 They correspond to the conformal group of "transformations by reciprocal radii" in the framework of Lie sphere geometry , which were already known in the 19th century. Time is used as fourth dimension as in Minkowski space , so spherical wave transformations are similar to the Lorentz transformation of special relativity . It turns out that the conformal group includes the Lorentz group and the Poincaré group as subgroups, but only the latter represent symmetries of all laws of nature including mechanics, whereas the conformal group is only related to certain areas such as electrodynamics. 2 3 4  A special case of Lie sphere geometry is the "transformation by reciprocal directions" or Laguerre inversion, being a generator of the group of Laguerre transformations (Laguerre group). It transforms not only spheres into spheres but also planes into planes. 5 6 7 If time is used as fourth dimension, a close analogy to the Lorentz transformation and the Lorentz group was pointed out by several authors such as Bateman, Cartan or Poincaré . 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  Transformation by reciprocal radii  Development in the 19th century  Inversions preserving angles between circles were first discussed by Durrande (1820), with Quetelet (1827) and Plücker (1828) writing down the corresponding transformation formula,   k   k   k   being the radius of inversion: 16        x  ′   =     k  2   x     x  2   +   y  2      ,    y  ′   =     k  2   y     x  2   +   y  2         formulae-sequence     superscript  x  normal-′        superscript  k  2   x      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2         superscript  y  normal-′        superscript  k  2   y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        x^{\prime}=\frac{k^{2}x}{x^{2}+y^{2}},\quad y^{\prime}=\frac{k^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{%
 2}}   .  These inversions were later called "transformations by reciprocal radii", and became better known when Thomson (1845, 1847) applied them on spheres with coordinates    x  ,  y  ,  z     x  y  z    x,y,z   in the course of developing the method of inversion in electrostatics . 17  Joseph Liouville (1847) demonstrated its mathematical meaning by showing that it belongs to the conformal transformations producing the following quadratic form : 18        δ   x   ′  2     +   δ   y   ′  2     +   δ   z   ′  2      =   λ   (    δ   x  2    +   δ   y  2    +   δ   z  2     )            δ   superscript  x   normal-′  2       δ   superscript  y   normal-′  2       δ   superscript  z   normal-′  2        λ      δ   superscript  x  2      δ   superscript  y  2      δ   superscript  z  2        \delta x^{\prime 2}+\delta y^{\prime 2}+\delta z^{\prime 2}=\lambda\left(%
 \delta x^{2}+\delta y^{2}+\delta z^{2}\right)   .  Liouville himself 19 and more extensively Sophus Lie (1871) 20 showed that the related conformal group can be differentiated ( Liouville's theorem ): For instance,    λ  =  1      λ  1    \lambda=1   includes the Euclidean group of ordinary motions;    λ  ≠  1      λ  1    \lambda\neq 1    scale or similarity transformations in which the coordinates of the previous transformations are multiplied by    λ      λ    \sqrt{\lambda}   ; and    λ  =    k  4   /    (    x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    )   2        λ     superscript  k  4    superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2    2      \lambda=k^{4}/\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{2}   gives Thomson's transformation by reciprocal radii (inversions): 21        x  ′   =     k  2   x     x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2      ,     y  ′   =     k  2   y     x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2      ,    z  ′   =     k  2   z     x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2          formulae-sequence     superscript  x  normal-′        superscript  k  2   x      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2       formulae-sequence     superscript  y  normal-′        superscript  k  2   y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2         superscript  z  normal-′        superscript  k  2   z      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2         x^{\prime}=\frac{k^{2}x}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}},\quad y^{\prime}=\frac{k^{2}y}{x^{%
 2}+y^{2}+z^{2}},\quad z^{\prime}=\frac{k^{2}z}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}   .  Subsequently, Liouville's theorem was extended to   n   n   n   dimensions by Lie (1871) 22 and others such as Darboux (1878): 23        δ   x  1   ′  2     +  …  +   δ   x  n   ′  2      =   λ   (    δ   x  1  2    +  …  +   δ   x  n  2     )            δ   superscript   subscript  x  1    normal-′  2     normal-…    δ   superscript   subscript  x  n    normal-′  2        λ      δ   superscript   subscript  x  1   2    normal-…    δ   superscript   subscript  x  n   2        \delta x_{1}^{\prime 2}+\dots+\delta x_{n}^{\prime 2}=\lambda\left(\delta x_{1%
 }^{2}+\dots+\delta x_{n}^{2}\right)   .  This group of conformal transformations by reciprocal radii preserves angles and transforms spheres into spheres or hyperspheres (see also conformal symmetry , Möbius transformation , and generally the Lie group ). It is a 6-parameter group in the plane R 2 , a 10-parameter group in space R 3 , and a 15-parameter group in R 4 . In R 2 it represents only a small subset of all conformal transformations therein, whereas in R 2+n it is identical to the group of all conformal transformations therein, in accordance with Liouville's theorem. 24 Conformal transformations in R 3 were often applied to what Darboux (1873) called "pentaspherical coordinates" by relating the points to homogeneous coordinates based on five spheres. 25 26  Oriented spheres  Another method for solving such sphere problems was to write down the coordinates together with the sphere's radius. 27 This was employed by Lie (1871) in the context of Lie sphere geometry which represents a general framework of sphere-transformations (being a special case of contact transformations ) conserving lines of curvature and transforming spheres into spheres. 28 The previously mentioned 10-parameter conformal group with respect to pentaspherical coordinates in R 3 , is extended to the 15-parameter group of Lie sphere transformations with respect to "hexaspherical coordinates" (named by Klein in 1893) by adding a sixth homogeneous coordinate related to the radius. 29 30 31 Since the radius of a sphere can have a positive or negative sign, one sphere always corresponds to two transformed spheres. It is advantageous to remove this ambiguity by attributing a definite sign to the radius, consequently giving the spheres a definite orientation too, so that one oriented sphere corresponds to one transformed oriented sphere. 32 This method was occasionally and implicitly employed by Lie (1871) 33 himself and explicitly introduced by Laguerre (1880). 34 In addition, Darboux (1887) brought the transformations by reciprocal radii into a form by which the radius r of a sphere can be determined if the radius of the other one is known: 35      x  ′     superscript  x  normal-′    \displaystyle x^{\prime}     Using coordinates together with the radius was often connected to a method called "minimal projection" by Klein (1893), 36 which was later called "isotropy projection" by Blaschke (1926) emphasizing the relation to oriented circles and spheres. 37 For instance, a circle with rectangular coordinates    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   and radius   r   r   r   in R 2 corresponds to a point in R 3 with coordinates    x  ,  y  ,  z     x  y  z    x,y,z   . This method was known for some time in circle geometry (though without using the concept of orientation) and can be further differentiated depending on whether the additional coordinate is treated as imaginary or real    z  =   i  r       z    i  r     z=ir   was used by Chasles (1852), Möbius (1857), Cayley (1867), and Darboux (1872); 38     z  =  r      z  r    z=r   was used by Cousinery (1826), Druckenmüller (1842), and in the "cyclography" of Fiedler (1882), therefore the latter method was also called "cyclographic projection" – see E. Müller (1910) for a summary. 39 This method was also applied to spheres 40 by Darboux (1872), 41 Lie (1871), 42 or Klein (1893). 43 Let    x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  r     x  y  z  r    x,y,z,r   and     x  ′   ,   y  ′   ,   z  ′   ,   r  ′       superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  y  normal-′    superscript  z  normal-′    superscript  r  normal-′     x^{\prime},y^{\prime},z^{\prime},r^{\prime}   be the center coordinates and radii of two spheres in three-dimensional space R 3 . If the spheres are touching each other with same orientation, their equation is given          (   x  -   x  ′    )   2   +    (   y  -   y  ′    )   2   +    (   z  -   z  ′    )   2    -    (   r  -   r  ′    )   2    =  0           superscript    x   superscript  x  normal-′    2    superscript    y   superscript  y  normal-′    2    superscript    z   superscript  z  normal-′    2     superscript    r   superscript  r  normal-′    2    0    (x-x^{\prime})^{2}+(y-y^{\prime})^{2}+(z-z^{\prime})^{2}-(r-r^{\prime})^{2}=0   .  Setting    t  =   i  r       t    i  r     t=ir   , these coordinates correspond to rectangular coordinates in four-dimensional space R 4 : 44 45         (   x  -   x  ′    )   2   +    (   y  -   y  ′    )   2   +    (   z  -   z  ′    )   2   +    (   t  -   t  ′    )   2    =  0         superscript    x   superscript  x  normal-′    2    superscript    y   superscript  y  normal-′    2    superscript    z   superscript  z  normal-′    2    superscript    t   superscript  t  normal-′    2    0    (x-x^{\prime})^{2}+(y-y^{\prime})^{2}+(z-z^{\prime})^{2}+(t-t^{\prime})^{2}=0   .  In general, Lie (1871) showed that the conformal point transformations in R n (composed of motions, similarities, and transformations by reciprocal radii) correspond in R n-1 to those sphere transformations which are contact transformations . 46 47 Klein (1893) pointed out that by using minimal projection on hexaspherical coordinates, the 15-parameter Lie sphere transformations in R 3 are simply the projections of the 15-parameter conformal point transformations in R 4 , whereas the points in R 4 can be seen as the stereographic projection of the points of a sphere in R 5 . 48 49  Relation to electrodynamics  Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham (1909) 50 showed that the electromagnetic equations are not only Lorentz invariant, but also scale and conformal invariant. 51 They are invariant under the 15-parameter group of conformal transformations    G  15     subscript  G  15    G_{15}   (transformations by reciprocal radii) in R 4 producing the relation        δ   x   ′  2     +   δ   y   ′  2     +   δ   z   ′  2     +   δ   u   ′  2      =   λ   (    δ   x  2    +   δ   y  2    +   δ   z  2    +   δ   u  2     )            δ   superscript  x   normal-′  2       δ   superscript  y   normal-′  2       δ   superscript  z   normal-′  2       δ   superscript  u   normal-′  2        λ      δ   superscript  x  2      δ   superscript  y  2      δ   superscript  z  2      δ   superscript  u  2        \delta x^{\prime 2}+\delta y^{\prime 2}+\delta z^{\prime 2}+\delta u^{\prime 2%
 }=\lambda\left(\delta x^{2}+\delta y^{2}+\delta z^{2}+\delta u^{2}\right)   ,  where    u  =   i  c  t       u    i  c  t     u=ict   includes   t   t   t   as time component and   c   c   c   as the speed of light . Bateman (1909) also noticed the equivalence to the previously mentioned Lie sphere transformations in R 3 , because the radius   r   r   r   used in them can be interpreted as the radius    c  t      c  t    ct   of a spherical wave contracting or expanding with   c   c   c   , therefore he called them "spherical wave transformations". 52 He wrote: 53  Depending on   λ   λ   \lambda   they can be differentiated into subgroups: 54  (a)    λ  =  1      λ  1    \lambda=1   correspond to mappings which transform not only spheres into spheres but also planes into planes. It includes the Lorentz transformations, which forms the 6-parameter Lorentz group or 10-parameter Poincaré group     G  10     subscript  G  10    G_{10}   with translations. 55  (b)    λ  ≠  1      λ  1    \lambda\neq 1   represents scale or similarity transformations by multiplication of the space-time variables of the Lorentz transformations by a constant factor depending on   λ   λ   \lambda   . 56 For instance, if    l  =   λ       l    λ     l=\sqrt{\lambda}   is used, then the transformation given by Poincaré in 1905 follows: 57        x  ′   =   γ  l   (   x  -   v  t    )     ,     y  ′   =   l  y    ,     z  ′   =   l  z    ,    t  ′   =   γ  l   (   t  -   x   v   c  2      )          formulae-sequence     superscript  x  normal-′     γ  l    x    v  t       formulae-sequence     superscript  y  normal-′     l  y     formulae-sequence     superscript  z  normal-′     l  z       superscript  t  normal-′     γ  l    t    x    v   superscript  c  2            x^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(x-vt\right),\quad y^{\prime}=ly,\quad z^{\prime}=lz,%
 \quad t^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(t-x\frac{v}{c^{2}}\right)   .  However, it was shown by Poincaré and Einstein that only    l  =  1      l  1    l=1   produces a group that is a symmetry of all laws of nature as required by the principle of relativity (the Lorentz group), while the group of scale transformations is only a symmetry of optics and electrodynamics.  (c) Setting    λ  =    r  4   /    (    x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2   +   u  2    )   2        λ     superscript  r  4    superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2    superscript  u  2    2      \lambda=r^{4}/\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+u^{2}\right)^{2}   particularly relates to the wide conformal group of transformations by reciprocal radii. It consists of elementary transformations that represent a generalized inversion into a four-dimensional hypersphere : 58      x  ′     superscript  x  normal-′    \displaystyle x^{\prime}     which become real spherical wave transformations in terms of Lie sphere geometry if the real radius    c  t      c  t    ct   is used instead of    u  =   i  c  t       u    i  c  t     u=ict   , thus      x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    -    c  2    t  2           superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2       superscript  c  2    superscript  t  2      x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}   is given in the denominator. 59  Felix Klein (1921) pointed out the similarity of these relations to Lie's and his own researches of 1871, adding that the conformal group doesn't have the same meaning as the Lorentz group, because the former applies to electrodynamics whereas the latter is a symmetry of all laws of nature including mechanics. 60 The possibility was discussed for some time, whether conformal transformations allow for the transformation into uniformly accelerated frames. 61 Later, conformal invariance became important again in certain areas such as conformal field theory . 62  Transformation by reciprocal directions  Development in the 19th century  Above, the connection of conformal transformations with coordinates including the radius of spheres within Lie sphere geometry was mentioned. In relation to this, 63 64 a special sphere transformation was given by Edmond Laguerre (1880-1885) who called it the "transformation by reciprocal directions" and who laid down the foundation of a geometry of oriented spheres and planes . 65 According to Darboux 66 and Bateman, 67 similar relations were discussed before by Albert Ribaucour (1870) 68 and by Lie himself (1871). 69  Stephanos (1881) pointed out that Laguerre's geometry is indeed a special case of Lie's sphere geometry. 70 He also represented Laguerre's oriented spheres by quaternions (1883). 71  Lines, circles, planes, or spheres with radii of certain orientation are called by Laguerre half-lines, half-circles (cycles), half-planes, half-spheres, etc. A tangent is a half-line cutting a cycle at a point where both have the same direction. The transformation by reciprocal directions transforms oriented spheres into oriented spheres and oriented planes into oriented planes, leaving invariant the "tangential distance" of two cycles (the distance between the points of each one of their common tangents), and also conserves the lines of curvature . 72 Laguerre (1882) applied the transformation to two cycles under the following conditions: Their radical axis is the axis of transformation, and their common tangents are parallel to two fixed directions of the half-lines that are transformed into themselves (Laguerre called this specific method the "transformation by reciprocal half-lines"). Setting   R   R   R   and    R  ′     superscript  R  normal-′    R^{\prime}   as the radii of the cycles, and   D   D   D   and    D  ′     superscript  D  normal-′    D^{\prime}   as the distances of their centers to the axis, he obtained: 73          D  2   -   D   ′  2     =    R  2   -   R   ′  2      ,     D  -   D  ′    =   α   (   R  -   R  ′    )     ,    D  +   D  ′    =    1  α    (   R  +   R  ′    )       ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  D  2    superscript  D   normal-′  2        superscript  R  2    superscript  R   normal-′  2       formulae-sequence      D   superscript  D  normal-′      α    R   superscript  R  normal-′          D   superscript  D  normal-′        1  α     R   superscript  R  normal-′         D^{2}-D^{\prime 2}=R^{2}-R^{\prime 2},\quad D-D^{\prime}=\alpha(R-R^{\prime}),%
 \quad D+D^{\prime}=\frac{1}{\alpha}(R+R^{\prime}),     with the transformation: 74         D  ′   =     D   (   1  +   α  2    )    -   2  α  R     1  -   α  2      ,    R  ′   =     2  α  D   -   R   (   1  +   α  2    )      1  -   α  2       .     formulae-sequence     superscript  D  normal-′         D    1   superscript  α  2       2  α  R      1   superscript  α  2         superscript  R  normal-′         2  α  D     R    1   superscript  α  2        1   superscript  α  2        D^{\prime}=\frac{D\left(1+\alpha^{2}\right)-2\alpha R}{1-\alpha^{2}},\quad R^{%
 \prime}=\frac{2\alpha D-R\left(1+\alpha^{2}\right)}{1-\alpha^{2}}.     Darboux (1887) obtained the same formulas in different notation (with    z  =  D      z  D    z=D   and    k  =  α      k  α    k=\alpha   ) in his treatment of the "transformation by reciprocal directions", though he included the   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   coordinates as well: 75      x  ′     superscript  x  normal-′    \displaystyle x^{\prime}     with          z  ′   +   R  ′    =     1  +  k    1  -  k     (   z  -  R   )     ,     z  ′   -   R  ′    =     1  -  k    1  +  k     (   z  +  R   )      ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  z  normal-′    superscript  R  normal-′          1  k     1  k      z  R          superscript  z  normal-′    superscript  R  normal-′          1  k     1  k      z  R       z^{\prime}+R^{\prime}=\frac{1+k}{1-k}(z-R),\quad z^{\prime}-R^{\prime}=\frac{1%
 -k}{1+k}(z+R),     consequently he obtained the relation         x   ′  2    +   y   ′  2    +   z   ′  2     -   R   ′  2     =     x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    -   R  2             superscript  x   normal-′  2     superscript  y   normal-′  2     superscript  z   normal-′  2      superscript  R   normal-′  2          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2     superscript  R  2      x^{\prime 2}+y^{\prime 2}+z^{\prime 2}-R^{\prime 2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-R^{2}   .  As mentioned above, oriented spheres in R 3 can be represented by points of four-dimensional space R 4 using minimal (isotropy) projection, which became particularly important in Laguerre's geometry. 76 For instance, E. Müller (1898) based his discussion of oriented spheres on the fact that they can be mapped upon the points of a plane manifold of four dimensions (which he likened to Fiedler's "cyclography" from 1882). He systematically compared the transformations by reciprocal radii (calling it "inversion at a sphere") with the transformations by reciprocal directions (calling it "inversion at a plane sphere complex"). 77 Following Müller's paper, Smith (1900) discussed Laguerre's transformation and the related "group of the geometry of reciprocal directions". Alluding to Klein's (1893) treatment of minimal projection, he pointed out that this group "is simply isomorphic with the group of all displacements and symmetry transformations in space of four dimensions". 78 Smith obtained the same transformation as Laguerre and Darboux in different notation, calling it "inversion into a spherical complex": 79        p  ′   =       κ  2   +  1     κ  2   -  1    p   -     2  κ     κ  2   -  1    R     ,    R  ′   =      2  κ     κ  2   -  1    p   -      κ  2   +  1     κ  2   -  1    R        formulae-sequence     superscript  p  normal-′            superscript  κ  2   1      superscript  κ  2   1    p         2  κ      superscript  κ  2   1    R        superscript  R  normal-′           2  κ      superscript  κ  2   1    p          superscript  κ  2   1      superscript  κ  2   1    R       p^{\prime}=\frac{\kappa^{2}+1}{\kappa^{2}-1}p-\frac{2\kappa}{\kappa^{2}-1}R,%

 -R^{2}.     Laguerre inversion and Lorentz transformation  In 1905 both Poincaré and Einstein pointed out that the Lorentz transformation of special relativity (setting    c  =  1      c  1    c=1   )        x  ′   =    x  -   v  t      1  -   v  2       ,     y  ′   =  y   ,     z  ′   =  z   ,    t  ′   =    t  -   v  x      1  -   v  2            formulae-sequence     superscript  x  normal-′       x    v  t        1   superscript  v  2        formulae-sequence     superscript  y  normal-′   y    formulae-sequence     superscript  z  normal-′   z      superscript  t  normal-′       t    v  x        1   superscript  v  2           x^{\prime}=\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}},\quad y^{\prime}=y,\quad z^{\prime}=z,%
 \quad t^{\prime}=\frac{t-vx}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}     leaves the relation      x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    -   t  2          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2     superscript  t  2     x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-t^{2}   invariant. 80 Einstein stressed the point that by this transformation a spherical light wave in one frame is transformed into a spherical light wave in another one. 81 Poincaré showed that the Lorentz transformation can be seen as a rotation in four-dimensional space with time as fourth coordinate, with Minkowski deepening this insight much further (see History of special relativity ).  As shown above, also the Transformation by reciprocal directions or half-lines – later called Laguerre inversion 82 83 – leaves the expression      x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    -   R  2          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2     superscript  R  2     x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-R^{2}   invariant. Subsequently, the relation to the Lorentz transformation was noted by several authors. For instance, Bateman (1910) argued that this transformation (which he attributed to Ribaucour) is "identical" to the Lorentz transformation. 84 In particular, he argued (1912) that the variant given by Darboux (1887) corresponds to the Lorentz transformation in   z   z   z   direction, if    R  =   c  t       R    c  t     R=ct   ,     R  ′   =   c   t  ′         superscript  R  normal-′     c   superscript  t  normal-′      R^{\prime}=ct^{\prime}   , and the   k   k   k   terms are replaced by velocities. 85 Bateman (1910) also sketched geometric representations of relativistic light spheres using such spherical systems. 86 87 However, Kubota (1925) responded to Bateman by arguing that the Laguerre inversion is involutory whereas the Lorentz transformation is not. He concluded that in order to make them equivalent, the Laguerre inversion has to be combined with a reversal of direction of the cycles. 88  The specific relation between the Lorentz transformation and the Laguerre inversion can also be demonstrated as follows (see H.R. Müller (1948) 89 for analogous formulas in different notation). Laguerre's inversion formulas from 1882 (equivalent to those of Darboux in 1887) read:         D  ′   =     D   (   1  +   α  2    )    -   2  α  R     1  -   α  2      ,    R  ′   =     2  α  D   -   R   (   1  +   α  2    )      1  -   α  2       .     formulae-sequence     superscript  D  normal-′         D    1   superscript  α  2       2  α  R      1   superscript  α  2         superscript  R  normal-′         2  α  D     R    1   superscript  α  2        1   superscript  α  2        D^{\prime}=\frac{D\left(1+\alpha^{2}\right)-2\alpha R}{1-\alpha^{2}},\quad R^{%

 {2}}}   .  According to Müller, the Lorentz transformation can be seen as the product of an even number of such Laguerre inversions that change the sign. First an inversion is conducted into plane    π  1     subscript  π  1    \pi_{1}   which is inclined with respect to plane   π   π   \pi   under a certain angle, followed by another inversion back to   π   π   \pi   . 90 See section #Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group for more details of the connection between the Laguerre inversion to other variants of Laguerre transformations.  Lorentz transformation within Laguerre geometry  Timerding (1911) 91 used Laguerre's concept of oriented spheres in order to represent and derive the Lorentz transformation. Given a sphere of radius   r   r   r   , with   x   x   x   as the distance between its center and the central plane, he obtained the relations to a corresponding sphere          x  ′   +   r  ′    =      1  +   λ  2     1  -   λ  2       (   x  +  r   )     ,      x  ′   -   r  ′      x  ′   +   r  ′     =     1  -  λ    1  +  λ    ⋅    x  -  r    x  +  r       ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  r  normal-′            1   superscript  λ  2      1   superscript  λ  2        x  r            superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  r  normal-′       superscript  x  normal-′    superscript  r  normal-′      normal-⋅      1  λ     1  λ        x  r     x  r        x^{\prime}+r^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{1+\lambda^{2}}{1-\lambda^{2}}}(x+r),\quad%
 \frac{x^{\prime}-r^{\prime}}{x^{\prime}+r^{\prime}}=\frac{1-\lambda}{1+\lambda%
 }\cdot\frac{x-r}{x+r},     resulting in the transformation           1  -   λ  2     ⋅   x  ′    =   x  -   λ  r     ,      1  -   λ  2     ⋅   r  ′    =   r  -   λ  x      .     formulae-sequence     normal-⋅      1   superscript  λ  2      superscript  x  normal-′      x    λ  r        normal-⋅      1   superscript  λ  2      superscript  r  normal-′      r    λ  x       \sqrt{1-\lambda^{2}}\cdot x^{\prime}=x-\lambda r,\quad\sqrt{1-\lambda^{2}}%
 \cdot r^{\prime}=r-\lambda x.     By setting    λ  =   v  /  c       λ    v  c     \lambda=v/c   and    r  =   c  t       r    c  t     r=ct   , it becomes the Lorentz transformation.  Following Timerding and Bateman, Ogura (1913) analyzed a Laguerre transformation of the form 92        α  ′   =    α   1    1  -   λ  2       -   R   λ    1  -   λ  2         ,     β  ′   =  β   ,     γ  ′   =  γ   ,    R  ′   =    α    -  λ     1  -   λ  2       +   R   1    1  -   λ  2              formulae-sequence     superscript  α  normal-′       α    1      1   superscript  λ  2         R    λ      1   superscript  λ  2          formulae-sequence     superscript  β  normal-′   β    formulae-sequence     superscript  γ  normal-′   γ      superscript  R  normal-′       α      λ       1   superscript  λ  2         R    1      1   superscript  λ  2             \alpha^{\prime}=\alpha\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^{2}}}-R\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{1-%

He stated that "the Laguerre transformation in sphere manifoldness is equivalent to the Lorentz transformation in spacetime manifoldness".  Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group  As shown above, the group of conformal point transformations in R n (composed of motions, similarities, and inversions) can be related by minimal projection to the group of contact transformations in R n-1 transforming circles or spheres into other circles or spheres. In addition, Lie (1871, 1896) pointed out that in R 3 there is a 7-parameter subgroup of point transformations composed of motions and similarities, which by using minimal projection corresponds to a 7-parameter subgroup of contact transformations in R 2 transforming circles into circles. 93 These relations were further studied by Smith (1900), 94  Blaschke (1910), 95  Coolidge (1916) 96 and others, who pointed out the connection to Laguerre's geometry of reciprocal directions related to oriented lines, circles, planes and spheres. Therefore, Smith (1900) called it the "group of the geometry of reciprocal directions", 97 and Blaschke (1910) used the expression "Laguerre group". 98 The "extended Laguerre group" consists of motions and similarities, having 7 parameters in R 2 transforming oriented lines and circles, or 11 parameters in R 3 transforming oriented planes and spheres. If similarities are excluded, it becomes the "restricted Laguerre group" having 6 parameters in R 2 and 10 parameters in R 3 , consisting of orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing motions, and preserving the tangential distance between oriented circles or spheres. 99 100 Subsequently it became common that the term Laguerre group only refers to the restricted Laguerre group. 101 102 It was also noted that the Laguerre group is part of a wider group conserving tangential distances, called the "equilong group" by Scheffers (1905). 103 104  In R 2 the Laguerre group leaves invariant the relation      d   x  2    +   d   y  2     -   d   r  2            d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2       d   superscript  r  2      dx^{2}+dy^{2}-dr^{2}   , which can be extended to arbitrary R n as well. 105 For instance, in R 3 it leaves invariant the relation      d   x  2    +   d   y  2    +   d   z  2     -   d   r  2            d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2      d   superscript  z  2       d   superscript  r  2      dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}-dr^{2}   . 106 This is equivalent to relation     d   x  2    +   d   y  2    +   d   z  2    +   d   r  2          d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2      d   superscript  z  2      d   superscript  r  2      dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}+dr^{2}   in R 4 by using minimal (isotropy) projection with imaginary radius coordinate, or cyclographic projection (in descriptive geometry ) with real radius coordinate. 107 The transformations forming the Laguerre group can be further differentiated into "direct Laguerre transformations" which are related to motions preserving both the tangential distance as well as the sign; or "indirect Laguerre transformations" which are related to orientation-reversing motions, preserving the tangential distance with the sign reversed. 108 109 The Laguerre inversion first given by Laguerre in 1882 is involutory , thus it belongs to the indirect Laguerre transformations. Laguerre himself did not discuss the group related to his inversion, but it turned out that every Laguerre transformation can be generated by at most four Laguerre inversions and every direct Laguerre transformation is the product of two involutory transformations, thus Laguerre inversions are of special importance because they are generating operators of the entire Laguerre group. 110 111  It was noted that the Laguerre group is indeed isomorphic to the Lorentz group (or the Poincaré group if translations are included), as both groups leave invariant the form      d   x  1  2    +   d   x  2  2    +   d   x  3  2     -   d   x  4  2            d   superscript   subscript  x  1   2      d   superscript   subscript  x  2   2      d   superscript   subscript  x  3   2       d   superscript   subscript  x  4   2      dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^{2}-dx_{4}^{2}   . After the first comparison of the Lorentz transformation and the Laguerre inversion by Bateman (1910) as mentioned above , the equivalence of both groups was pointed out by Cartan in 1912 112 and 1914, 113 and he expanded upon it in 1915 (published 1955) in the French version of Klein's encyclopedia . 114 Also Poincaré (1912, published 1921) wrote: 115 116   Others who noticed this connection include Coolidge (1916), 117  Klein & Blaschke (1926), 118 Blaschke (1929), 119  H.R.

An oriented plane   P   P   P   in    E  3     superscript  E  3    E^{3}   may be interpreted as the set of all oriented spheres which are tangent to   P   P   P   . Mapping   P   P   P   via this set of spheres into    ℝ  4     superscript  ℝ  4    \mathbb{R}^{4}   , one finds a hyperplane in    ℝ  4     superscript  ℝ  4    \mathbb{R}^{4}   which is parallel to a tangent hyperplane of the cone       x  1  2   +   x  2  2   +   x  3  2    -   x  4  2    =  0           superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2    superscript   subscript  x  3   2     superscript   subscript  x  4   2    0    x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{4}^{2}=0   .
