   Hyperstability      Hyperstability   In stability theory , hyperstability is a property of a system that requires the state vector to remain bounded if the inputs are restricted to belonging to a subset of the set of all possible inputs. 1  Definition: 2 A system is hyperstable if there are two constants      k  1   ≥  0   ,    k  2   ≥  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  k  1   0      subscript  k  2   0     k_{1}\geq 0,k_{2}\geq 0   such that any state trajectory of the system satisfies the inequality:        ∥   x   (  t  )    ∥   <     k  1    ∥   x   (  0  )    ∥    +   k  2     ,    ∀  t   ≥  0      formulae-sequence     norm    x  t         subscript  k  1    norm    x  0      subscript  k  2        for-all  t   0     \|x(t)\|     References    See also   Stability theory  BIBO stability   "  Category:Stability theory     Brian D.
