Hyperstability

In stability theory, hyperstability is a property of a system that requires the state vector to remain bounded if the inputs are restricted to belonging to a subset of the set of all possible inputs.1
Definition:2 A system is hyperstable if there are two constants 
 
 
 
  such that any state trajectory of the system satisfies the inequality:
