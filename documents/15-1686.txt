Non-linear coherent states




Non-linear coherent states

Coherent states are quasi-classical states that may be defined in different ways, for instance as eigenstates of the annihilation operator


 
 ,
or as a displacement from the vacuum


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the Sudarshan-Glauber displacement operator.1
One may think of a non-linear coherent state 2 by generalizing the annihilation operator:


 
 ,
and then using any of the above definitions by exchanging 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  . The above definition is also known as an 
 
 
 
 -deformed annihilation operator.3
