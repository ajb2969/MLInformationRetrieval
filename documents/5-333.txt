Megathrust earthquake

Megathrust earthquakes occur at subduction zones at destructive plate boundaries (convergent boundaries), where one tectonic plate is subducted (forced underneath) by another. These interplate earthquakes are the planet's most powerful, with moment magnitudes (
 
 
 
 ) that can exceed 9.0. Since 1900, all earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater have been megathrust earthquakes. No other type of known terrestrial source of tectonic activity has produced earthquakes of this scale.
Terminology
During the rupture, one side of the fault is pushed upwards relative to the other, and it is this type of movement that is known as thrust.1 They are one type of dip-slip faults. A thrust fault is a reverse fault with a dip of 45° or less.2 Oblique-slip faults have significant components of different slip styles. The term megathrust does not have a widely accepted rigorous definition, but is used to refer to an extremely large thrust fault, typically formed at the plate interface along a subduction zone such as the Sunda megathrust.34
Areas
The major subduction zone is associated with the Pacific and Indian Oceans and is responsible for the volcanic activity associated with the Pacific Ring of Fire. Since these earthquakes deform the ocean floor, they often generate a significant series of tsunami waves. They are known to produce intense shaking for periods of time that can last for up to a few minutes.
In Japan, the Nankai megathrust under the Nankai Trough is responsible for Nankai megathrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis.
The Big One
"The Big One" is a term often used in casual conversation by residents of California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia to describe the megathrust earthquake anticipated as inevitably striking the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Much of the United States infrastructure has been hardened specifically for the anticipation of "The Big One".5 The name has also been applied to a megathrust earthquake expected to happen in Tokyo, Kantō region, Japan with the epicenter in Sagami Bay where the Philippine Sea Plate and Pacific Plate movements cause large earthquakes regularly, with an interval of approximately 70 years.

It caused from ten to a hundred thousand deaths.
The grave of Nuno Álvares Pereira was forever lost along with the Historical records of the voyages of Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus
