   Biorthogonal polynomial      Biorthogonal polynomial   In mathematics, a biorthogonal polynomial is a polynomial that is orthogonal to several different measures. Biorthogonal polynomials are a generalization of orthogonal polynomials and share many of their properties. There are two different concepts of biorthogonal polynomials in the literature:  introduced the concept of polynomials biorthogonal with respect to a sequence of measures, while Szegő introduced the concept of two sequences of polynomials that are biorthogonal with respect to each other.  Polynomials biorthogonal with respect to a sequence of measures  A polynomial p is called biorthogonal with respect to a sequence of measures μ 1 , μ 2 , ... if       ∫   p   (  x  )   d   μ  i    (  x  )     =  0          p  x  d   subscript  μ  i   x    0    \int p(x)\,d\mu_{i}(x)=0   whenever i ≤ deg( p ).  Biorthogonal pairs of sequences  Two sequences ψ 0 , ψ 1 , ... and φ 0 , φ 1 , ... of polynomials are called biorthogonal (for some measure μ ) if       ∫    ϕ  m    (  x  )    ψ  n    (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )     =  0           subscript  ϕ  m   x   subscript  ψ  n   x  d  μ  x    0    \int\phi_{m}(x)\psi_{n}(x)\,d\mu(x)=0     whenever m ≠ n .  The definition of biorthogonal pairs of sequences is in some sense a special case of the definition of biorthogonality with respect to a sequence of measures. More precisely two sequences ψ 0 , ψ 1 , ... and φ 0 , φ 1 , ... of polynomials are biorthogonal for the measure μ if and only if the sequence ψ 0 , ψ 1 , ... is biorthogonal for the sequence of measures φ 0 μ, φ 1 μ, ..., and the sequence φ 0 , φ 1 , ... is biorthogonal for the sequence of measures ψ 0 μ, ψ 1 μ,....
