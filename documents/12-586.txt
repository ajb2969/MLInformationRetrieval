In 1847 along with the other 550 manuscripts (e.g. Add. 14448 ) it was brought to England. 11  The fragments of Luke were independently transcribed, both by Tregelles in 1854, and by Tischendorf in 1855, who afterwards re-examined the places wherein he differed from Tregelles (e.g. Luke 8:5; 18:1.10). 12  Tischendorf edited the text of the codex in 1857 in his Monumenta sacra inedita , volume VII, with a facsimile. 13  The 48 extant parchment leaves of the manuscript are kept in the British Library (Additional Manuscripts 17211) in London . 14 15  See also   List of New Testament uncials  Biblical manuscript  Textual criticism   References  Further reading    S.
