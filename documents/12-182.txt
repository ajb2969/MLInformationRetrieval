   Perfect measure      Perfect measure   In mathematics — specifically, in measure theory — a perfect measure (or, more accurately, a perfect measure space ) is one that is “ well-behaved ” in some sense. Intuitively, a perfect measure μ is one for which, if we consider the pushforward measure on the real line  R , then every measurable set is “ μ -approximately a Borel set ”. The notion of perfectness is closely related to tightness of measures : indeed, in metric spaces , tight measures are always perfect.  Definition  A measure space ( X , Σ, μ ) is said to be perfect if, for every Σ-measurable function f : X → R and every A ⊆ R with f −1 ( A ) ∈ Σ, there exist Borel subsets A 1 and A 2 of R such that       A  1   ⊆  A  ⊆    A  2   and  μ   (    f   -  1     (    A  2   ∖   A  1    )    )    =  0.         subscript  A  1   A          subscript  A  2   and  μ     superscript  f    1       subscript  A  2    subscript  A  1           0.     A_{1}\subseteq A\subseteq A_{2}\mbox{ and }\mu\big(f^{-1}(A_{2}\setminus A_{1}%
 )\big)=0.     Results concerning perfect measures   If X is any metric space and μ is an inner regular (or tight ) measure on X , then ( X , B X , μ ) is a perfect measure space, where B X denotes the Borel σ -algebra on X .   References      "  Category:Measures (measure theory)
