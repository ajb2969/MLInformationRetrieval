Somer–Lucas pseudoprime

In mathematics, in particular number theory, an odd composite number N is a Somer–Lucas d-pseudoprime (with given d ≥ 1) if there exists a nondegenerate Lucas sequence

 
  with the discriminant 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and the rank appearance of N in the sequence U(P, Q) is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Jacobi symbol.
Applications
Unlike the standard Lucas pseudoprimes, there is no known efficient primality test using the Lucas d-pseudoprimes. Hence they are not generally used for computation.

Lawrence Somer, in his 1985 thesis, also defined the Somer d-pseudoprimes. They are described in brief on page 117 of Ribenbaum 1996.
