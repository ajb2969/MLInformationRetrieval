   Somer–Lucas pseudoprime      Somer–Lucas pseudoprime   In mathematics , in particular number theory , an odd  composite number  N is a Somer–Lucas d - pseudoprime (with given d ≥ 1) if there exists a nondegenerate Lucas sequence     U   (  P  ,  Q  )       U   P  Q     U(P,Q)   with the discriminant     D  =    P  2   -   4  Q     ,      D     superscript  P  2     4  Q      D=P^{2}-4Q,   such that     gcd   (  N  ,  D  )    =  1        N  D   1    \gcd(N,D)=1   and the rank appearance of N in the sequence U ( P , Q ) is        1  d    (   N  -   (   D  N   )    )    ,        1  d     N    D  N      \frac{1}{d}\left(N-\left(\frac{D}{N}\right)\right),   where    (   D  N   )      D  N    \left(\frac{D}{N}\right)   is the Jacobi symbol .  Applications  Unlike the standard Lucas pseudoprimes , there is no known efficient primality test using the Lucas d -pseudoprimes. Hence they are not generally used for computation.  See Also  Lawrence Somer, in his 1985 thesis, also defined the Somer d-pseudoprimes . They are described in brief on page 117 of Ribenbaum 1996.  References        "  Category:Pseudoprimes
