   Philo line      Philo line   In geometry , the Philo line is a line segment defined from an angle and a point . The Philo line for a point P that lies inside an angle with edges d and e is the shortest line segment that passes through P and has its endpoints on d and e . Also known as the Philon line , it is named after Philo of Byzantium , a Greek writer on mechanical devices, who lived probably during the 1st or 2nd century BC. The Philo line is not, in general, constructible by compass and straightedge .  Doubling the cube  Philo's line can be used to double the cube , that is, to construct a geometric representation of the cube root of two, and this was Philo's purpose in defining this line (Coxeter and van de Craats, 1993). Specifically, let PQRS be a rectangle in which the aspect ratio  PQ:QR is 1:2, as in the figure below. Let TU be the Philo line of point P with respect to right angle QRS . Define point V to be the point of intersection of line TU and of the circle through points PQRS , and let W be the point where line QR crosses a perpendicular line through V . Then segments RS and RW are in proportion    1  :   2  3      normal-:  1     3   2     \scriptstyle 1:\sqrt[3]{2}   .  (Figure)  Philo line.svg   In this figure, segments PU and VT are of equal length, and RV is perpendicular to TU . These properties can be used as part of an equivalent alternative definition for the Philo line for a point P and angle edges d and e : it is a line segment connecting d to e through P such that the distance along the segment from P to d is equal to the distance along the segment from V to e , where V is the closest point on the segment to the corner point of the angle.  Since doubling the cube is impossible with compass and straightedge , it is similarly impossible to construct the Philo line with these tools.
