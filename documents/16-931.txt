   Born–Mayer equation      Born–Mayer equation   The Born–Mayer equation is an equation that is used to calculate the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound . It is a refinement of the Born–Landé equation by using an improved repulsion term. 1      E  =   -      N  A   M   z  +    z  -    e  2     4  π   ϵ  0    r  0      (   1  -   ρ   r  0     )         E           subscript  N  A   M   superscript  z     superscript  z     superscript  e  2      4  π   subscript  ϵ  0    subscript  r  0       1    ρ   subscript  r  0         E=-\frac{N_{A}Mz^{+}z^{-}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{0}}\left(1-\frac{\rho}{r_{0%
