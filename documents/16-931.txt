Born–Mayer equation

The Born–Mayer equation is an equation that is used to calculate the lattice energy of a crystalline ionic compound. It is a refinement of the Born–Landé equation by using an improved repulsion term.1


 
  where:

NA = Avogadro constant;
M = Madelung constant, relating to the geometry of the crystal;
z+ = charge number of cation
z− = charge number of anion
e = elementary charge, 1.6022
 
 
C
ε0 = permittivity of free space

4πε0 = 1.112
 
 
 
  C2/(J·m)
 

r0 = distance to closest ion
p = a constant dependant on the compressibility of the crystal; 30 pm works well for all alkali metal halides
