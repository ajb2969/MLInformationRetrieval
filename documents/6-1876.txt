In probability theory and statistics, the beta prime distribution (also known as inverted beta distribution or beta distribution of the second kind1) is an absolutely continuous probability distribution defined for 
 
 
 
  with two parameters α and β, having the probability density function:



where B is a Beta function.
The cumulative distribution function is



where I is the regularized incomplete beta function.
The expectation value, variance, and other details of the distribution are given in the sidebox; for 
 
 
 
 , the excess kurtosis is


 
 .
While the related beta distribution is the conjugate prior distribution of the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution expressed as a probability, the beta prime distribution is the conjugate prior distribution of the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution expressed in odds. The distribution is a Pearson type VI distribution.2
The mode of a variate X distributed as 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Its mean is 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  (if 
 
 
 
  the mean is infinite, in other words it has no well defined mean) and its variance is 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 .
For

For 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , this simplifies to



The cdf can also be written as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Gauss's hypergeometric function 2F1 .
Differential equation



Generalization
Two more parameters can be added to form the generalized beta prime distribution.


shape (real)

 
  scale (real)
having the probability density function:



with mean



and mode



Note that if p=q=1 then the generalized beta prime distribution reduces to the standard beta prime distribution
Compound gamma distribution
The compound gamma distribution3 is the generalization of the beta prime when the scale parameter, q is added, but where p=1. It is so named because it is formed by compounding two gamma distributions:



where G(x;a,b) is the gamma distribution with shape a and inverse scale b. This relationship can be used to generate random variables with a compound gamma, or beta prime distribution.
The mode, mean and variance of the compound gamma can be obtained by multiplying the mode and mean in the above infobox by q and the variance by q2.
