   Chandrasekhar limit      Chandrasekhar limit  The '''Chandrasekhar limit''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʌ|n|d|r|ə|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ|k|ɑr}}) is the maximum mass of a [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|stable]] [[white dwarf]] [[star]].  The limit was first indicated in papers published by [[Wilhelm Anderson]] and [[Edmund Clifton Stoner|E. C. Stoner]], and was named after [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], the Indian [[astrophysicist]] who independently discovered and improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 19, in [[India]].  This limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of [[black hole]]s, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time.  White dwarfs resist [[gravitational collapse]] primarily through [[electron degeneracy pressure]]. (By comparison, [[main sequence]] stars resist collapse through [[Pressure#Pressure of an ideal gas|thermal pressure]]. ) The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit would be subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant , such as a neutron star or black hole . (However, white dwarfs generally avoid this fate by exploding before they undergo collapse.) Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs. 1  The currently accepted value of the limit is about 1.39        M  ⊙          subscript  M  direct-product      \begin{smallmatrix}M_{\odot}\end{smallmatrix}    ( 2.765 × 10 30 kg). 2 3 4  Physics  Electron degeneracy pressure is a quantum-mechanical effect arising from the Pauli exclusion principle . Since electrons are fermions , no two electrons can be in the same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a band of energy levels. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons will increase upon compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of electron capture , relieving the pressure.  In the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an equation of state of the form    P  =    K  1    ρ   5  3         P     subscript  K  1    superscript  ρ    5  3       P=K_{1}\rho^{5\over 3}   , where P is the pressure ,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the mass density , and    K  1     subscript  K  1    K_{1}   is a constant. Solving the hydrostatic equation then leads to a model white dwarf which is a polytrope of index 3/2 and therefore has radius inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass, and volume inversely proportional to its mass. 5  As the mass of a model white dwarf increases, the typical energies to which degeneracy pressure forces the electrons are no longer negligible relative to their rest masses. The velocities of the electrons approach the speed of light, and special relativity must be taken into account. In the strongly relativistic limit, the equation of state takes the form    P  =    K  2    ρ   4  3         P     subscript  K  2    superscript  ρ    4  3       P=K_{2}\rho^{4\over 3}   . This will yield a polytrope of index 3, which will have a total mass, M limit say, depending only on K 2 . 6  For a fully relativistic treatment, the equation of state used will interpolate between the equations    P  =    K  1    ρ   5  3         P     subscript  K  1    superscript  ρ    5  3       P=K_{1}\rho^{5\over 3}   for small ρ and    P  =    K  2    ρ   4  3         P     subscript  K  2    superscript  ρ    4  3       P=K_{2}\rho^{4\over 3}   for large ρ. When this is done, the model radius still decreases with mass, but becomes zero at M limit . This is the Chandrasekhar limit. 7 The curves of radius against mass for the non-relativistic and relativistic models are shown in the graph. They are colored blue and green, respectively. μ e has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii 8 or kilometers, and mass in standard solar masses.  Calculated values for the limit will vary depending on the nuclear composition of the mass. 9 Chandrasekhar 10 , eq. (36), 11 , eq. (58), 12 , eq. (43) gives the following expression, based on the equation of state for an ideal Fermi gas :        M  limit   =      ω  3  0     3  π     2     (    ℏ  c   G   )    3  /  2     1    (    μ  e    m  H    )   2      ,       subscript  M  limit          superscript   subscript  ω  3   0       3  π     2    superscript      Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c   G     3  2      1   superscript     subscript  μ  e    subscript  m  H    2       M_{\rm limit}=\frac{\omega_{3}^{0}\sqrt{3\pi}}{2}\left(\frac{\hbar c}{G}\right%

As      ℏ  c   /  G           Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c   G     \sqrt{\hbar c/G}   is the Planck mass , the limit is of the order of        M   P  l   3    m  H  2    .       superscript   subscript  M    P  l    3    superscript   subscript  m  H   2     \frac{M_{Pl}^{3}}{m_{H}^{2}}.     A more accurate value of the limit than that given by this simple model requires adjusting for various factors, including electrostatic interactions between the electrons and nuclei and effects caused by nonzero temperature. 13 Lieb and Yau 14 have given a rigorous derivation of the limit from a relativistic many-particle Schrödinger equation .  History  In 1926, the British physicist  Ralph H. Fowler observed that the relationship among the density, energy and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei which obeyed Fermi–Dirac statistics . 15 This Fermi gas model was then used by the British physicist E. C. Stoner in 1929 to calculate the relationship among the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming them to be homogeneous spheres. 16  Wilhelm Anderson applied a relativistic correction to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately 1.37     ×    10  3   0       absent     superscript  10  3   0     \times 10^{3}0   kg. 17 In 1930, Stoner derived the internal energy – density  equation of state for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass–radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately (for μ e =2.5) 2.19 · 10 30 kg. 18 Stoner went on to derive the pressure – density equation of state, which he published in 1932. 19 These equations of state were also previously published by the Soviet  physicist  Yakov Frenkel in 1928, together with some other remarks on the physics of degenerate matter . 20 Frenkel's work, however, was ignored by the astronomical and astrophysical community. 21  A series of papers published between 1931 and 1935 had its beginning on a trip from India to England in 1930, where the Indian  physicist  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar worked on the calculation of the statistics of a degenerate Fermi gas. 22 In these papers, Chandrasekhar solved the hydrostatic equation together with the nonrelativistic Fermi gas equation of state , 23 and also treated the case of a relativistic Fermi gas, giving rise to the value of the limit shown above. 24 25 26 27 Chandrasekhar reviews this work in his Nobel Prize lecture. 28 This value was also computed in 1932 by the Soviet physicist Lev Davidovich Landau , 29 who, however, did not apply it to white dwarfs.  Chandrasekhar's work on the limit aroused controversy, owing to the opposition of the British astrophysicist  Arthur Stanley Eddington . Eddington was aware that the existence of black holes was theoretically possible, and also realized that the existence of the limit made their formation possible. However, he was unwilling to accept that this could happen. After a talk by Chandrasekhar on the limit in 1935, he replied:   Eddington's proposed solution to the perceived problem was to modify relativistic mechanics so as to make the law P=K 1 ρ 5/3 universally applicable, even for large ρ. 30 Although Bohr , Fowler, Pauli , and other physicists agreed with Chandrasekhar's analysis, at the time, owing to Eddington's status, they were unwilling to publicly support Chandrasekhar. 31 , pp. 110–111 Through the rest of his life, Eddington held to his position in his writings, 32 33 34 35 36 including his work on his fundamental theory . 37 The drama associated with this disagreement is one of the main themes of Empire of the Stars , Arthur I. Miller 's biography of Chandrasekhar. 38 In Miller's view:   Applications  The core of a star is kept from collapsing by the heat generated by the fusion of nuclei of lighter elements into heavier ones. At various stages of stellar evolution , the nuclei required for this process will be exhausted, and the core will collapse, causing it to become denser and hotter. A critical situation arises when iron accumulates in the core, since iron nuclei are incapable of generating further energy through fusion. If the core becomes sufficiently dense, electron degeneracy pressure will play a significant part in stabilizing it against gravitational collapse. 39  If a main-sequence star is not too massive (less than approximately 8 solar masses ), it will eventually shed enough mass to form a white dwarf having mass below the Chandrasekhar limit, which will consist of the former core of the star. For more-massive stars, electron degeneracy pressure will not keep the iron core from collapsing to very great density, leading to formation of a neutron star , black hole , or, speculatively, a quark star . (For very massive, low- metallicity stars, it is also possible that instabilities will destroy the star completely.) 40 41 42 43 During the collapse, neutrons are formed by the capture of electrons by protons in the process of electron capture , leading to the emission of neutrinos . 44 , pp. 1046–1047. The decrease in gravitational potential energy of the collapsing core releases a large amount of energy which is on the order of 10 46  joules (100 foes ). Most of this energy is carried away by the emitted neutrinos. 45 This process is believed to be responsible for supernovae of types Ib, Ic, and II . 46  Type Ia supernovae derive their energy from runaway fusion of the nuclei in the interior of a white dwarf . This fate may befall carbon – oxygen white dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion giant star , leading to a steadily increasing mass. As the white dwarf's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, its central density increases, and, as a result of compressional heating, its temperature also increases. This eventually ignites nuclear fusion reactions, leading to an immediate carbon detonation which disrupts the star and causes the supernova. 47 , §5.1.2  A strong indication of the reliability of Chandrasekhar's formula is that the absolute magnitudes of supernovae of Type Ia are all approximately the same; at maximum luminosity, M V is approximately -19.3, with a standard deviation of no more than 0.3. 48 , (1) A 1-sigma interval therefore represents a factor of less than 2 in luminosity. This seems to indicate that all type Ia supernovae convert approximately the same amount of mass to energy.  Super-Chandrasekhar mass supernovae  In April 2003, the Supernova Legacy Survey observed a type Ia supernova, designated SNLS-03D3bb , in a galaxy approximately 4 billion light years away. According to a group of astronomers at the University of Toronto and elsewhere, the observations of this supernova are best explained by assuming that it arose from a white dwarf which grew to twice the mass of the Sun before exploding. They believe that the star, dubbed the " Champagne Supernova " by University of Oklahoma astronomer David R. Branch, may have been spinning so fast that centrifugal force allowed it to exceed the limit. Alternatively, the supernova may have resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs, so that the limit was only violated momentarily. Nevertheless, they point out that this observation poses a challenge to the use of type Ia supernovae as standard candles . 49 50 51  Since the observation of the Champagne Supernova in 2003, more very bright type Ia supernovae have been observed that are thought to have originated from white dwarfs whose masses exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit. These include SN 2006gz , SN 2007if and SN 2009dc . 52 The super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs that gave rise to these supernovae are believed to have had masses up to 2.4–2.8 solar masses . 53 One way to potentially explain the problem of the Champagne Supernova was considering it the result of an aspherical explosion of a white dwarf. However, spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2009dc showed it had a polarization smaller than 0.3, making the large asphericity theory unlikely. 54  Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit  After a supernova explosion, a neutron star may be left behind. Like white dwarfs these objects are extremely compact and are supported by degeneracy pressure, but a neutron star is so massive and compressed that electrons and protons have combined to form neutrons, and the star is thus supported by neutron degeneracy pressure instead of electron degeneracy pressure. The limit of neutron degeneracy pressure, analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit, is known as the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit .
