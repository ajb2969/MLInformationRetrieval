This distribution has neither a probability density function nor a probability mass function , as it is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure , nor has it any point-masses. It is thus neither a discrete nor an absolutely continuous probability distribution, nor is it a mixture of these. Rather it is an example of a singular distribution .  Its cumulative distribution function is sometimes referred to as the Devil's staircase , although that term has a more general meaning.  Characterization  The support of the Cantor distribution is the Cantor set , itself the intersection of the (countably infinitely many) sets       C  0   =        subscript  C  0   absent    \displaystyle C_{0}=     The Cantor distribution is the unique probability distribution for which for any C t ( t ∈ { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }), the probability of a particular interval in C t containing the Cantor-distributed random variable is identically 2 − t on each one of the 2 t intervals.  Moments  It is easy to see by symmetry that for a random variable  X having this distribution, its expected value E( X ) = 1/2, and that all odd central moments of X are 0.  The law of total variance can be used to find the variance var( X ), as follows. For the above set C 1 , let Y = 0 if X ∈ [0,1/3], and 1 if X ∈ [2/3,1]. Then:      var   (  X  )      var  X    \displaystyle\operatorname{var}(X)     From this we get:        var   (  X  )    =   1  8    .       var  X     1  8     \operatorname{var}(X)=\frac{1}{8}.     A closed-form expression for any even central moment can be found by first obtaining the even cumulants 1        κ   2  n    =     2    2  n   -  1     (    2   2  n    -  1   )    B   2  n       n    (    3   2  n    -  1   )      ,       subscript  κ    2  n         superscript  2      2  n   1       superscript  2    2  n    1    subscript  B    2  n       n     superscript  3    2  n    1       \kappa_{2n}=\frac{2^{2n-1}(2^{2n}-1)B_{2n}}{n\,(3^{2n}-1)},\,\!     where B 2 n is the 2 n th Bernoulli number , and then expressing the moments as functions of the cumulants .
