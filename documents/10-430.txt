   4-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase      4-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxybutanoate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate semialdehyde + NADH + H +    The two substrates of this enzyme are therefore 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are succinate semialdehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. 1 The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxybutanoate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called gamma-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism and the degradation of the neurotransmitter  4-hydroxybutanoic acid . 2  References  "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩  ↩
