Methionine—tRNA ligase




Methionine—tRNA ligase

In enzymology, a methionine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-methionine + tRNAMet 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-methionyl-tRNAMet
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-methionine, and tRNA(Met), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and L-methionyl-tRNA(Met).
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-methionine:tRNAMet ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include methionyl-tRNA synthetase, methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase, methionyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase, methionyl-transfer RNA synthetase, methionine translase, and MetRS. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: methionine metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis.
