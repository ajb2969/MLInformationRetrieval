Routhian mechanics

In analytical mechanics, a branch of theoretical physics, Routhian mechanics is a hybrid formulation of Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics developed by Edward John Routh. Correspondingly, the Routhian is the function which replaces both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions.
The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of generalized coordinates representing the degrees of freedom in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta.
The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the Routhian equations are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations.
Often the Routhian approach may offer no new advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has cyclic coordinates (also called "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are coupled together - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates.
The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach. Moreover, the Routhian method directly makes clearer the physical interpretations of the constants associated with the cyclic coordinates, in the Lagrangian approach the constants are less obvious.
As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.
Definitions
In the case of Lagrangian mechanics, the generalized coordinates , ... and the corresponding velocities , and possibly time1

 
 , enter the Lagrangian,



where the overdots denote time derivatives.
In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates  and the corresponding generalized momenta  and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian,



where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum  corresponding to the coordinate  (partial derivatives are denoted using 
 
 
 
 ). The velocities  are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context,  is said to be the momentum "canonically conjugate" to .
The Routhian is intermediate between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; some coordinates  are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta , the rest of the coordinates  to have generalized velocities , and time may appear explicitly:23
where again the generalized velocity  is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum  via its defining relation. The choice of which 
 
 
 
  coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the 
 
 
 
  coordinates, is arbitrary.
The above is used by Landau and Lifshitz, and Goldstien. Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition.4
Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for tuples (or vectors) of the variables, thus  (q1, q2, ..., qn)}},  (ζ1, ζ2, ..., ζs)}},  (p1, p2, ..., pn)}}, and  (dζ1/dt, dζ2/dt, ..., dζs/dt)}}, so that

Equations of motion
For reference, the Lagrangian equations for 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom are a set of 
 
 
 
  coupled second order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates:



where 
 
 
 
 , and the Hamiltonian equations for 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom are a set of 
 
 
 
  coupled first order ordinary differential equations in the coordinates and momenta:



Below, the Routhian equations of motion are obtained in two ways, in the process other useful derivatives are found that can be used elsewhere.
Two degrees of freedom
Consider the case of a system with two degrees of freedom, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with generalized velocities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and the Lagrangian is time-dependent. (The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two).5 The Lagrangian of the system will have the form



The differential of 
 
 
 
  is



Now change variables, from the set (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ) to (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ), simply switching the velocity 
 
 
 
  to the momentum 
 
 
 
 . This change of variables in the differentials is the Legendre transformation. The differential of the new function to replace 
 
 
 
  will be a sum of differentials in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Using the definition of generalized momentum and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate 
 
 
 
 :



we have



and to replace 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , recall the product rule for differentials,6 and substitute



to obtain the differential of a new function in terms of the new set of variables:



Introducing the Routhian



where again the velocity 
 
 
 
  is a function of the momentum 
 
 
 
 , we have



but from the above definition, the differential of the Routhian is



Comparing the coefficients of the differentials 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , the results are Hamilton's equations for the coordinate 
 
 
 
 ,



and Lagrange's equation for the coordinate 
 
 




which follow from



and taking the total time derivative of the second equation and equating to the first. Notice the Routhian replaces the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions in all the equations of motion.
The remaining equation states the partial time derivatives of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are negatives:



Any number of degrees of freedom
For 
 
 
 
  coordinates as defined above, with Routhian



the equations of motion can be derived by a Legendre transformation of this Routhian as in the previous section, but another way is to simply take the partial derivatives of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the coordinates  and , momenta , and velocities , where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . The derivatives are:















The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of 
 
 
 
 ) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize:7
The total number of equations is 
 
 
 
 , there are 
 
 
 
  Hamiltonian equations plus 
 
 
 
  Lagrange equations.
Cyclic coordinates
The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with cyclic coordinates, because by definition those coordinates do not enter 
 
 
 
 , and hence 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding partial derivatives of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. Explicitly, if the  are all cyclic coordinates, and the  are all non cyclic, then



where the  are constants. With these constants substituted into the Routhian, 
 
 
 
  is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also):



The 
 
 
 
  Hamiltonian equations in the cyclic coordinates automatically vanish,



and the 
 
 
 
  Lagrangian equations are in the non cyclic coordinates:



Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates.
If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, we can integrate the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates.
Examples
Central potentials
One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with central potentials, because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles.
Cylindrical symmetry
Consider a particle of mass 
 
 
 
  in a central potential 
 
 
 
  in cylindrical coordinates

 
 , the Lagrangian is:



The potential 
 
 
 
  has cylindrical symmetry since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis.
There are two cyclic coordinates, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The momenta conjugate to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the constants



Notice  is the angular momentum about the imaginary cylinder axis, and  the linear or translational momentum along the axis. Both are conserved in this system.
The radial component 
 
 
 
  and angular velocity 
 
 
 
  can vary with time, but the momentum  is constant, and since  is constant it follows 
 
 
 
  is constant. The Routhian can take the form



The Hamiltonian equations for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for. The Lagrangian equation in 
 
 




is



To see how 
 
 
 
  changes with time, integrate the momenta expression for  above:



where  is an arbitrary constant, the initial value of 
 
 
 
  to be specified in the initial conditions.
The motion of the particle in this system is helicoidal, with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying according to the equation of motion derived above.
With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for 
 
 
 
  would include 
 
 
 
  which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to solve for.
The 
 
 
 
  equation is



the 
 
 
 
  equation is



and the 
 
 
 
  equation is



The 
 
 
 
  equation is trivial to integrate, the 
 
 
 
  equation less simple, but in any case the time derivatives are mixed in all the equations and must be eliminated, and the solutions involve more arbitrary constants which have less obvious physical meaning. In the Routhian approach above the constants are directly found and the physical interpretations are clearer - they are related to the angular momentum.
Spherical symmetry
Consider a particle of mass 
 
 
 
  under the influence of a central potential 
 
 
 
  in spherical polar coordinates

 
 :



Notice 
 
 
 
  is cyclic, because it does not appear in the Lagrangian. The momentum conjugate to 
 
 
 
  is the constant



in which 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can vary with time, but the angular momentum  is constant. The Routhian can be taken to be



We can solve for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  using Lagrange's equations, and do not need to solve for 
 
 
 
  since it is eliminated by Hamiltonian's equations. The 
 
 
 
  equation is



and the 
 
 
 
  equation is



The Routhian approach has obtained two coupled nonlinear equations. By contrast the Lagrangian approach leads to three nonlinear coupled equations, mixing in the first and second time derivatives of 
 
 
 
  in all of them, despite its absence from the Lagrangian.

Conical pendulum

Conical pendulum: angles and velocities.

Consider the conical pendulum, a mass 
 
 
 
  (known as a "pendulum bob") attached to a rigid rod of length 
 
 
 
  of negligible mass, subject to a local gravitational field 
 
 
 
 . The system rotates with angular velocity 
 
 
 
  which is not constant, and the rod and mass sweep out a cone (hence the name). The angle between the rod and vertical is 
 
 
 
  and is not constant.
The Lagrangian isThe potential energy is actually


 
  but since the first term is constant, it can be ignored in the Lagrangian (and Routhian) which only depend on derivatives of coordinates and velocities. Subtracting this from the kinetic energy means a plus sign in the Lagrangian, not minus.



and 
 
 
 
  is the cyclic coordinate for the system with constant momentum



which again is physically the angular momentum of the system about the vertical. The angle 
 
 
 
  and angular velocity 
 
 
 
  vary with time, but the angular momentum is constant. The Routhian is



The 
 
 
 
  equation is found from the Lagrangian equations:



or simplifying by introducing the constants



gives



This equation resembles the simple nonlinear pendulum equation, with an additional term to account for the rotation (the constant 
 
 
 
  is related to the angular momentum ). However, unlike the simple pendulum, this equation is still nonlinear even for the case of small 
 
 
 
 , as can be seen from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The factor of  in the denominator of the rotation term is indeed very small, but cannot be neglected, since  is very large (division by a small number much less than 1 is a large number).
The 
 
 
 
  equations from the Routhian are the Hamiltonian equations which trivially vanish.
Applying the Lagrangian approach there are two nonlinear coupled equations to solve.
The 
 
 
 
  equation is

The Routhian can be taken to be:



and since






we have



The first term is constant, and can be ignored since only the derivatives of R will enter the equations of motion. The simplified Routhian, without loss of information, is thus



The equation of motion for 
 
 
 
  is, by direct calculation,






or by introducing the constants



a simpler form of the equation is obtained



Although the equation is highly nonlinear, there is only one equation to solve for, it was obtained directly, and the cyclic coordinates are not involved.
By contrast, the Lagrangian approach leads to three nonlinear coupled equations to solve, despite the absence of the coordinates

  in the Lagrangian.

So although the Routhian method does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, it will lead to fewer equations.
Energy
Since the Lagrangian has units of energy, the Routhian also has units of energy. In SI units this is the Joule.
Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result



If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, 
 
 
 
 , so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system10



(If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of 
 
 
 
  with respect to all the velocities  and . Under the same condition of 
 
 
 
  being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of 
 
 
 
  and the partial derivatives of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the velocities ,



Notice only the partial derivatives of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the velocities  are needed instead of the full set of  and . In the case that 
 
 
 
  and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then 
 
 
 
 , that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for 
 
 
 
  in when 
 
 
 
  is also the Hamiltonian, so in all 
 
 
 
 .
If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is



which can be derived from the total time derivative of 
 
 
 
  in the same way as for

The coordinates are functions of time, so the Lagrangian always has implicit time-dependence via the coordinates. If the Lagrangian changes with time irrespective of the coordinates, usually due to some time-dependent potential, then the Lagrangian is said to have "explicit" time-dependence.
