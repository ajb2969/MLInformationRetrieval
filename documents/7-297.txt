   Routhian mechanics      Routhian mechanics   In analytical mechanics , a branch of theoretical physics , Routhian mechanics is a hybrid formulation of Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics developed by Edward John Routh . Correspondingly, the Routhian is the function which replaces both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions.  The Routhian, like the Hamiltonian, can be obtained from a Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, and has a similar mathematical form to the Hamiltonian, but is not exactly the same. The difference between the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and Routhian functions are their variables. For a given set of generalized coordinates representing the degrees of freedom in the system, the Lagrangian is a function of the coordinates and velocities, while the Hamiltonian is a function of the coordinates and momenta.  The Routhian differs from these functions in that some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized velocities, the rest to have corresponding generalized momenta. This choice is arbitrary, and can be done to simplify the problem. It also has the consequence that the Routhian equations are exactly the Hamiltonian equations for some coordinates and corresponding momenta, and the Lagrangian equations for the rest of the coordinates and their velocities. In each case the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are replaced by a single function, the Routhian. The full set thus has the advantages of both sets of equations, with the convenience of splitting one set of coordinates to the Hamilton equations, and the rest to the Lagrangian equations.  Often the Routhian approach may offer no new advantage, but one notable case where this is useful is when a system has cyclic coordinates (also called "ignorable coordinates"), by definition those coordinates which do not appear in the original Lagrangian. The Lagrangian equations are powerful results, used frequently in theory and practice, since the equations of motion in the coordinates are easy to set up. However, if cyclic coordinates occur there will still be equations to solve for all the coordinates, including the cyclic coordinates despite their absence in the Lagrangian. The Hamiltonian equations are useful theoretical results, but less useful in practice because coordinates and momenta are coupled together - after solving the equations the coordinates and momenta must be eliminated from each other. Nevertheless, the Hamiltonian equations are perfectly suited to cyclic coordinates because the equations in the cyclic coordinates trivially vanish, leaving only the equations in the non cyclic coordinates.  The Routhian approach has the best of both approaches, because cyclic coordinates can be split off to the Hamiltonian equations and eliminated, leaving behind the non cyclic coordinates to be solved from the Lagrangian equations. Overall fewer equations need to be solved compared to the Lagrangian approach. Moreover, the Routhian method directly makes clearer the physical interpretations of the constants associated with the cyclic coordinates, in the Lagrangian approach the constants are less obvious.  As with the rest of analytical mechanics, Routhian mechanics is completely equivalent to Newtonian mechanics, all other formulations of classical mechanics, and introduces no new physics. It offers an alternative way to solve mechanical problems.

 \frac{dq_{i}}{dt}\,,     where the overdots denote time derivatives .  In Hamiltonian mechanics, the generalized coordinates and the corresponding generalized momenta and possibly time, enter the Hamiltonian,         H   (   q  1   ,   q  2   ,  …  ,   p  1   ,   p  2   ,  …  ,  t  )    =     ∑  i      q  ˙   i    p  i     -   L   (   q  1   ,   q  2   ,  …  ,     q  ˙   1    (   p  1   )    ,     q  ˙   2    (   p  2   )    ,  …  ,  t  )      ,    p  i   =     ∂  L    ∂    q  ˙   i        ,     formulae-sequence      H    subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2   normal-…   subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   normal-…  t        subscript   i      subscript   normal-˙  q   i    subscript  p  i       L    subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2   normal-…     subscript   normal-˙  q   1    subscript  p  1       subscript   normal-˙  q   2    subscript  p  2    normal-…  t         subscript  p  i       L      subscript   normal-˙  q   i        H(q_{1},q_{2},\ldots,p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,t)=\sum_{i}\dot{q}_{i}p_{i}-L(q_{1},q_%

 {\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_{i}}\,,     where the second equation is the definition of the generalized momentum corresponding to the coordinate ( partial derivatives are denoted using   ∂   normal-∂   ∂   ). The velocities are expressed as functions of their corresponding momenta by inverting their defining relation. In this context, is said to be the momentum "canonically conjugate" to .  The Routhian is intermediate between   L   L   L   and   H   H   H   ; some coordinates are chosen to have corresponding generalized momenta , the rest of the coordinates to have generalized velocities , and time may appear explicitly: 2 3  where again the generalized velocity is to be expressed as a function of generalized momentum via its defining relation. The choice of which   n   n   n   coordinates are to have corresponding momenta, out of the    n  +  s      n  s    n+s   coordinates, is arbitrary.  The above is used by Landau and Lifshitz , and Goldstien . Some authors may define the Routhian to be the negative of the above definition. 4  Given the length of the general definition, a more compact notation is to use boldface for tuples (or vectors) of the variables, thus ( q 1 , q 2 , ..., q n )}} , ( ζ 1 , ζ 2 , ..., ζ s )}} , ( p 1 , p 2 , ..., p n )}} , and ( dζ 1 / dt , dζ 2 / dt , ..., dζ s / dt )}} , so that        R   (  𝐪  ,  𝜻  ,  𝐩  ,   𝜻  ˙   ,  t  )    =    𝐩  ⋅   𝐪  ˙    -   L   (  𝐪  ,  𝜻  ,   𝐪  ˙   ,   𝜻  ˙   ,  t  )      ,        R   𝐪  𝜻  𝐩   normal-˙  𝜻   t       normal-⋅  𝐩   normal-˙  𝐪      L   𝐪  𝜻   normal-˙  𝐪    normal-˙  𝜻   t       R(\mathbf{q},\boldsymbol{\zeta},\mathbf{p},\dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}},t)=\mathbf%

(The generalization to any number of degrees of freedom follows exactly the same procedure as with two). 5 The Lagrangian of the system will have the form      L   (  q  ,  ζ  ,   q  ˙   ,   ζ  ˙   ,  t  )       L   q  ζ   normal-˙  q    normal-˙  ζ   t     L(q,\zeta,\dot{q},\dot{\zeta},t)     The differential of   L   L   L   is        d  L   =      ∂  L    ∂  q    d  q   +     ∂  L    ∂  ζ    d  ζ   +     ∂  L    ∂   q  ˙     d   q  ˙    +     ∂  L    ∂   ζ  ˙     d   ζ  ˙    +     ∂  L    ∂  t    d   t      .        d  L           L     q    d  q         L     ζ    d  ζ         L      normal-˙  q     d   normal-˙  q          L      normal-˙  ζ     d   normal-˙  ζ          L     t    d  t      dL=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q}dq+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\zeta}d\zeta+%

The first two are identically the Hamiltonian equations. Equating the total time derivative of the fourth set of equations with the third (for each value of   j   j   j   ) gives the Lagrangian equations. The fifth is just the same relation between time partial derivatives as before. To summarize: 7  The total number of equations is     2  n   +  s        2  n   s    2n+s   , there are    2  n      2  n    2n   Hamiltonian equations plus   s   s   s   Lagrange equations.  Cyclic coordinates  The Routhian formulation is useful for systems with cyclic coordinates , because by definition those coordinates do not enter   L   L   L   , and hence   R   R   R   . The corresponding partial derivatives of   L   L   L   and   R   R   R   with respect to those coordinates are zero, which equates to the corresponding generalized momenta reducing to constants. Explicitly, if the are all cyclic coordinates, and the are all non cyclic, then          ∂  L    ∂   q  i     =    p  ˙   i   =   -    ∂  R    ∂   q  i      =  0     ⇒   p  i    =    α  i      ,     formulae-sequence          L      subscript  q  i      subscript   normal-˙  p   i              R      subscript  q  i           0       normal-⇒   subscript  p  i     subscript  α  i      \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_{i}}=\dot{p}_{i}=-\frac{\partial R}{\partial q_{i%

With these constants substituted into the Routhian,   R   R   R   is a function of only the non cyclic coordinates and velocities (and in general time also):        R   (   ζ  1   ,  …  ,   ζ  s   ,   α  1   ,  …  ,   α  n   ,    ζ  ˙   1   ,  …  ,    ζ  ˙   s   ,  t  )    =     ∑   i  =  1   n     α  i     q  ˙   i    (   α  i   )     -   L   (   ζ  1   ,  …  ,   ζ  s   ,     q  ˙   1    (   α  1   )    ,  …  ,     q  ˙   n    (   α  n   )    ,    ζ  ˙   1   ,  …  ,    ζ  ˙   s   ,  t  )      ,        R    subscript  ζ  1   normal-…   subscript  ζ  s    subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  n    subscript   normal-˙  ζ   1   normal-…   subscript   normal-˙  ζ   s   t        superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  α  i    subscript   normal-˙  q   i    subscript  α  i       L    subscript  ζ  1   normal-…   subscript  ζ  s      subscript   normal-˙  q   1    subscript  α  1    normal-…     subscript   normal-˙  q   n    subscript  α  n     subscript   normal-˙  ζ   1   normal-…   subscript   normal-˙  ζ   s   t       R(\zeta_{1},\ldots,\zeta_{s},\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n},\dot{\zeta}_{1},%

 \partial\zeta_{j}}\,.     Thus the problem has been reduced to solving the Lagrangian equations in the non cyclic coordinates, with the advantage of the Hamiltonian equations cleanly removing the cyclic coordinates.  If we are interested in how the cyclic coordinates change with time, we can integrate the equations for the generalized velocities corresponding to the cyclic coordinates.  Examples  Central potentials  One general class of mechanical systems with cyclic coordinates are those with central potentials , because potentials of this form only have dependence on radial separations and no dependence on angles.  Cylindrical symmetry  Consider a particle of mass   m   m   m   in a central potential    V   (  r  )       V  r    V(r)   in cylindrical coordinates     (  r  ,  θ  ,  z  )     r  θ  z    (r,θ,z)   , the Lagrangian is:        L   (  r  ,   r  ˙   ,   θ  ˙   ,   z  ˙   )    =     m  2    (     r  ˙   2   +    r  2     θ  2   ˙    +    z  ˙   2    )    -   V   (  r  )      .

 }+\dot{z}^{2})-V(r)\,.     The potential    V   (  r  )       V  r    V(r)   has cylindrical symmetry since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an imaginary cylinder axis.  There are two cyclic coordinates,   θ   θ   θ   and   z   z   z   . The momenta conjugate to   θ   θ   θ   and   z   z   z   are the constants         p  θ   =    ∂  L    ∂   θ  ˙     =   m   r  2     θ  ˙      ,    p  z   =    ∂  L    ∂   z  ˙     =   m    z  ˙       .     formulae-sequence       subscript  p  θ       L      normal-˙  θ            m   superscript  r  2    normal-˙  θ           subscript  p  z       L      normal-˙  z            m   normal-˙  z        p_{\theta}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\theta}}=mr^{2}\dot{\theta}\,,\quad p%
 _{z}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{z}}=m\dot{z}\,.     Notice is the angular momentum about the imaginary cylinder axis, and the linear or translational momentum along the axis. Both are conserved in this system.  The radial component   r   r   r   and angular velocity      d  θ   /  d   t          d  θ   d   t    dθ/dt   can vary with time, but the momentum is constant, and since is constant it follows      d  z   /  d   t          d  z   d   t    dz/dt   is constant. The Routhian can take the form      R   (  r  ,   r  ˙   )       R   r   normal-˙  r      \displaystyle R(r,\dot{r})     The Hamiltonian equations for   θ   θ   θ   and   z   z   z   automatically vanish and do not need to be solved for.

The motion of the particle in this system is helicoidal , with the axial motion uniform (constant) but the radial and angular components varying according to the equation of motion derived above.  With the Lagrangian approach, the equation for   r   r   r   would include      d  θ   /  d   t          d  θ   d   t    dθ/dt   which has to be eliminated, and there would be equations for   θ   θ   θ   and   z   z   z   to solve for.

 \quad\Rightarrow\quad m\ddot{z}=0\,.     The   z   z   z   equation is trivial to integrate, the   θ   θ   θ   equation less simple, but in any case the time derivatives are mixed in all the equations and must be eliminated, and the solutions involve more arbitrary constants which have less obvious physical meaning. In the Routhian approach above the constants are directly found and the physical interpretations are clearer - they are related to the angular momentum.

 \theta-I_{3}\dot{\psi}\sin\theta\dot{\theta}=0\,,     So although the Routhian method does not guarantee the equations of motion will be simple, it will lead to fewer equations.  Energy  Since the Lagrangian has units of energy , the Routhian also has units of energy. In SI units this is the Joule .  Taking the total time derivative of the Lagrangian leads to the general result         ∂  L    ∂  t    =    d   d  t     (      ∑   i  =  1   n      q  ˙   i     ∂  L    ∂    q  ˙   i       +    ∑   j  =  1   s      ζ  ˙   j     ∂  L    ∂    ζ  ˙   j        -  L   )     .

 {\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_{i}}+\sum_{j=1}^{s}\dot{\zeta}_{j}\frac{\partial L%
 }{\partial\dot{\zeta}_{j}}-L\right)\,.     If the Lagrangian is independent of time, the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero,       ∂  L   /  ∂   t   =  0            normal-∂  L   normal-∂   t   0    ∂L/∂t=0   , so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets must be a constant, it is the total energy of the system 10       E  =      ∑   i  =  1   n      q  ˙   i     ∂  L    ∂    q  ˙   i       +    ∑   j  =  1   s      ζ  ˙   j     ∂  L    ∂    ζ  ˙   j        -   L     ,      E        superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript   normal-˙  q   i       L      subscript   normal-˙  q   i         superscript   subscript     j  1    s      subscript   normal-˙  ζ   j       L      subscript   normal-˙  ζ   j        L     E=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\dot{q}_{i}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}_{i}}+\sum_{j=1}^{%
 s}\dot{\zeta}_{j}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{\zeta}_{j}}-L\,,     (If there are external fields interacting with the constituents of the system, they can vary throughout space but not time). This expression requires the partial derivatives of   L   L   L   with respect to all the velocities and . Under the same condition of   R   R   R   being time independent, the energy in terms of the Routhian is a little simpler, substituting the definition of   R   R   R   and the partial derivatives of   R   R   R   with respect to the velocities ,       E  =   R  -    ∑   j  =  1   s      ζ  ˙   j      ∂  R    ∂    ζ  ˙   j          .      E    R    superscript   subscript     j  1    s      subscript   normal-˙  ζ   j       R      subscript   normal-˙  ζ   j          E=R-\sum_{j=1}^{s}\dot{\zeta}_{j}\frac{\partial R}{\partial\dot{\zeta}_{j}}\,.     Notice only the partial derivatives of   R   R   R   with respect to the velocities are needed instead of the full set of and . In the case that    s  =  0      s  0    s=0   and the Routhian is explicitly time-independent, then    E  =  R      E  R    E=R   , that is, the Routhian equals the energy of the system. The same expression for   R   R   R   in when    s  =  0      s  0    s=0   is also the Hamiltonian, so in all    E  =  R  =  H        E  R       H     E=R=H   .  If the Routhian has explicit time dependence, the total energy of the system is not constant. The general result is         ∂  R    ∂  t    =    d   d  t     (   R  -    ∑   j  =  1   s      ζ  ˙   j     ∂  R    ∂    ζ  ˙   j        )     ,          R     t        d    d  t      R    superscript   subscript     j  1    s      subscript   normal-˙  ζ   j       R      subscript   normal-˙  ζ   j           \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}=\dfrac{d}{dt}\left(R-\sum_{j=1}^{s}\dot{\zeta}_{%
 j}\frac{\partial R}{\partial\dot{\zeta}_{j}}\right)\,,     which can be derived from the total time derivative of   R   R   R   in the same way as for   L   L   L   .
