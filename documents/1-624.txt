Legendre symbol (a/p) for various a (along top) and p (along left side). Only 0 ≤ a 


In number theory, the Legendre symbol is a multiplicative function with values 1, −1, 0 that is a quadratic character modulo a prime number p: its value on a (nonzero) quadratic residue mod p is 1 and on a non-quadratic residue (non-residue) is −1. Its value on zero is 0.
The Legendre symbol was introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 17981 in the course of his attempts at proving the law of quadratic reciprocity. Generalizations of the symbol include the Jacobi symbol and Dirichlet characters of higher order. The notational convenience of the Legendre symbol inspired introduction of several other "symbols" used in algebraic number theory, such as the Hilbert symbol and the Artin symbol.
Definition
Let p be an odd prime number. An integer a is a quadratic residue modulo p if it is congruent to a perfect square modulo p and is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p otherwise. The Legendre symbol is a function of a and p defined as



Legendre's original definition was by means of the explicit formula



By Euler's criterion, which had been discovered earlier and was known to Legendre, these two definitions are equivalent.2 Thus Legendre's contribution lay in introducing a convenient notation that recorded quadratic residuosity of a mod p. For the sake of comparison, Gauss used the notation 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  according to whether a is a residue or a non-residue modulo p.
For typographical convenience, the Legendre symbol is sometimes written as (a|p) or (a/p). The sequence (a|p) for a equal to 0,1,2,... is periodic with period p and is sometimes called the Legendre sequence, with {0,1,−1} values occasionally replaced by {1,0,1} or {0,1,0}.3
Properties of the Legendre symbol
There are a number of useful properties of the Legendre symbol which, together with the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to compute it efficiently.

The Legendre symbol is periodic in its first (or top) argument: if a ≡ b (mod p), then
 
 


The Legendre symbol is a completely multiplicative function of its top argument:
 
 


In particular, the product of two numbers that are both quadratic residues or quadratic non-residues modulo p is a residue, whereas the product of a residue with a non-residue is a non-residue. A special case is the Legendre symbol of a square:
 
 


When viewed as a function of a, the Legendre symbol 
 
 
 
 
  is the unique quadratic (or order 2) Dirichlet character modulo p.
The first supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:
 
 :

=\begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\pmod{4} \\ -1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 3\pmod{4}. \end{cases}

The second supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:
 
 :

1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\mbox{ or }7 \pmod{8} \\ -1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 3\mbox{ or }5 \pmod{8}. \end{cases}

Special formulas for the Legendre symbol 
 
 
 
  for small values of a:
 
For an odd prime p ≠ 3,
 
 :


=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\mbox{ or }11 \pmod{12} \\
-1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 5\mbox{ or }7 \pmod{12}. \end{cases}


For an odd prime p ≠ 5,
 
 :


=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 1\mbox{ or }4 \pmod5 \\
-1 & \mbox{ if }p \equiv 2\mbox{ or }3 \pmod5. \end{cases}

The Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... are defined by the recurrence  F2 {{=}} 1,}}  Fn + Fn−1.}} If p is a prime number then
 
 


For example,
 
 :

(\tfrac{2}{5}) &= -1, && F_3 = 2, F_2 = 1,\\ (\tfrac{3}{5}) &= -1, && F_4 = 3, F_3 = 2,\\ (\tfrac{5}{5}) &= 0, && F_5 = 5, \\ (\tfrac{7}{5}) &= -1, && F_8 = 21, F_7 = 13,\\ (\tfrac{11}{5})&= 1, && F_{10} = 55, F_{11} = 89. \end{align}

This result comes from the theory of Lucas sequences, which are used in primality testing.4 See Wall–Sun–Sun prime.

Legendre symbol and quadratic reciprocity
Let p and q be odd primes. Using the Legendre symbol, the quadratic reciprocity law can be stated concisely:



Many proofs of quadratic reciprocity are based on Legendre's formula



In addition, several alternative expressions for the Legendre symbol were devised in order to produce various proofs of the quadratic reciprocity law.

Gauss introduced the quadratic Gauss sum and used the formula










in his fourth5 and sixth6 proofs of quadratic reciprocity.
 


Kronecker's proof7 first establishes that










Reversing the roles of p and q, he obtains the relation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 



One of Eisenstein's proofs8 begins by showing that










Using certain elliptic functions instead of the sine function, Eisenstein was able to prove cubic and quartic reciprocity as well.

The Jacobi symbol

 
 
  is a generalization of the Legendre symbol that allows for a composite second (bottom) argument n, although n must still be odd and positive. This generalization provides an efficient way to compute all Legendre symbols without performing factorization along the way.
A further extension is the Kronecker symbol, in which the bottom argument may be any integer.
The power residue symbol

 
  generalizes the Legendre symbol to higher power n. The Legendre symbol represents the power residue symbol for n = 2.

Computational example
The above properties, including the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to evaluate any Legendre symbol. For example:
