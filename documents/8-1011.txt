Moving least squares

Moving least squares is a method of reconstructing continuous functions from a set of unorganized point samples via the calculation of a weighted least squares measure biased towards the region around the point at which the reconstructed value is requested.
In computer graphics, the moving least squares method is useful for reconstructing a surface from a set of points. Often it is used to create a 3D surface from a point cloud through either downsampling or upsampling.
Definition
 Consider a function 
 
 
 
  and a set of sample points 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
 
 's are real numbers. Then, the moving least square approximation of degree 
 
 
 
  at the point 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  minimizes the weighted least-square error


 
  over all polynomials 
 
 
 
  of degree 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the weight and it tends to zero as

In the example
