   Moving least squares      Moving least squares   Moving least squares is a method of reconstructing continuous functions from a set of unorganized point samples via the calculation of a weighted least squares  measure biased towards the region around the point at which the reconstructed value is requested.  In computer graphics , the moving least squares method is useful for reconstructing a surface from a set of points. Often it is used to create a 3D surface from a point cloud through either downsampling or upsampling .  Definition  Consider a function    f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}   and a set of sample points    S  =   {   (   x  i   ,   f  i   )   |    f   (   x  i   )    =   f  i    }       S   conditional-set    subscript  x  i    subscript  f  i        f   subscript  x  i     subscript  f  i       S=\{(x_{i},f_{i})|f(x_{i})=f_{i}\}   where     x  i   ∈   ℝ  n        subscript  x  i    superscript  ℝ  n     x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   and the    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   's are real numbers. Then, the moving least square approximation of degree   m   m   m   at the point   x   x   x   is     p  ~    (  x  )        normal-~  p   x    \tilde{p}(x)   where    p  ~     normal-~  p    \tilde{p}   minimizes the weighted least-square error       ∑   i  ∈  I       (    p   (   x  i   )    -   f  i    )   2   θ   (   ∥   x  -   x  i    ∥   )        subscript     i  I       superscript      p   subscript  x  i     subscript  f  i    2   θ   norm    x   subscript  x  i        \sum_{i\in I}(p(x_{i})-f_{i})^{2}\theta(\|x-x_{i}\|)   over all polynomials   p   p   p   of degree   m   m   m   in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   .    θ   (  s  )       θ  s    \theta(s)   is the weight and it tends to zero as    s  →  ∞     normal-→  s     s\to\infty   .  In the example     θ   (  s  )    =   e   -   s  2           θ  s    superscript  e     superscript  s  2       \theta(s)=e^{-s^{2}}   .
