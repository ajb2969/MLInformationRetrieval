   Dihydrobunolol dehydrogenase      Dihydrobunolol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a dihydrobunolol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+/−)-5-[(tert-butylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1- naphthol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+/−)-5-[(tert-butylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy]-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)- naphthalenone + NADPH + H +    The three substrates of this enzyme are [[(+/−)-5-[(tert-butylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol]], and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are [[(+/−)-5-[(tert-butylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy]-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-]], naphthalenone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+/−)-5-[(tert-butylamino)-2'-hydroxypropoxy]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-n aphthol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also termed bunolol reductase .
