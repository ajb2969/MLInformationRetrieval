<h1>Heckscher–Ohlin theorem</h1>
<hr/>

<p> The <strong>Heckscher–Ohlin theorem</strong> is one of the four critical theorems of the <a href="Heckscher–Ohlin_model" title="wikilink">Heckscher–Ohlin model</a>, developed by Swedish economist <a href="Eli_Heckscher" title="wikilink">Eli Heckscher</a> and <a href="Bertil_Ohlin" title="wikilink">Bertil Ohlin</a> (his student). It states that a country will export goods that use its abundant factors intensively, and import goods that use its scarce factors intensively. In the two-factor case, it states: "A capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good, while the labor-abundant country will export the labor-intensive good."</p>

<p>The critical assumption of the Heckscher–Ohlin model is that the two countries are identical, except for the difference in resource endowments. This also implies that the aggregate preferences are the same. The relative abundance in <a href="Capital_(economics)" title="wikilink">capital</a> will cause the capital-abundant country to <a href="Production,_costs,_and_pricing" title="wikilink">produce</a> the capital-intensive good cheaper than the <a href="Labour_(economics)" title="wikilink">labor</a>-abundant country and vice versa.</p>

<p>Initially, when the countries are not trading:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a class="uri" href="price" title="wikilink">price</a> of the capital-intensive good in the capital-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country,</li>
<li>the price of the labor-intensive good in the labor-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once trade is allowed, <a href="Profit_(economics)" title="wikilink">profit</a>-seeking firms will move their products to the markets that have (temporary) higher price. As a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>the capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good,</li>
<li>the labor-abundant country will export the labor-intensive good.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="Leontief_paradox" title="wikilink">Leontief paradox</a>, presented by <a href="Wassily_Leontief" title="wikilink">Wassily Leontief</a> in 1951,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> found that the U.S. (the most capital-abundant country in the world by any criterion) exported labor-intensive commodities and imported capital-intensive commodities, in apparent contradiction with the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem. However, if labor is separated into two distinct factors, skilled labor and unskilled labor, the Heckscher–Ohlin theorem is more accurate. The U.S. tends to export skilled-labor-intensive goods, and tends to import unskilled-labor-intensive goods.</p>
