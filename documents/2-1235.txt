   Index of a subgroup      Index of a subgroup   In mathematics , specifically group theory , the index of a subgroup  H in a group G is the "relative size" of H in G : equivalently, the number of "copies" (cosets) of H that fill up G . For example, if H has index 2 in G , then intuitively "half" of the elements of G lie in H . The index of H in G is usually denoted | G : H | or [ G : H ] or ( G : H ).  Formally, the index of H in G is defined as the number of cosets of H in G . (The number of left cosets of H in G is always equal to the number of right cosets.) For example, let Z be the group of integers under addition , and let 2 Z be the subgroup of Z consisting of the even integers . Then 2 Z has two cosets in Z (namely the even integers and the odd integers), so the index of 2 Z in Z is two. To generalize,      |  ùêô  :  n  ùêô  |  =  n     fragments  normal-|  Z  normal-:  n  Z  normal-|   n    |\mathbf{Z}:n\mathbf{Z}|=n   for any positive integer n .  If N is a normal subgroup of G , then the index of N in G is also equal to the order of the quotient group  G / N , since this is defined in terms of a group structure on the set of cosets of N in G .  If G is infinite, the index of a subgroup H will in general be a non-zero cardinal number . It may be finite - that is, a positive integer - as the example above shows.  If G and H are finite groups , then the index of H in G is equal to the quotient of the orders of the two groups:      |  G  :  H  |  =    |  G  |    |  H  |    .     fragments  normal-|  G  normal-:  H  normal-|       G     H    normal-.    |G:H|=\frac{|G|}{|H|}.   This is Lagrange's theorem , and in this case the quotient is necessarily a positive integer .  Properties   If H is a subgroup of G and K is a subgroup of H , then         |  G  :  K  |  =  |  G  :  H  |  |  H  :  K  |  .     fragments  normal-|  G  normal-:  K  normal-|   normal-|  G  normal-:  H  normal-|  normal-|  H  normal-:  K  normal-|  normal-.    |G:K|=|G:H|\,|H:K|.         If H and K are subgroups of G , then         |  G  :  H  ‚à©  K  |  ‚â§  |  G  :  H  |  |  G  :  K  |  ,     fragments  normal-|  G  normal-:  H   K  normal-|   normal-|  G  normal-:  H  normal-|  normal-|  G  normal-:  K  normal-|  normal-,    |G:H\cap K|\leq|G:H|\,|G:K|,       with equality if HK = G . (If | G : H ‚à© K | is finite, then equality holds if and only if HK = G .)    Equivalently, if H and K are subgroups of G , then         |  H  :  H  ‚à©  K  |  ‚â§  |  G  :  K  |  ,     fragments  normal-|  H  normal-:  H   K  normal-|   normal-|  G  normal-:  K  normal-|  normal-,    |H:H\cap K|\leq|G:K|,       with equality if HK = G . (If | H : H ‚à© K | is finite, then equality holds if and only if HK = G .)    If G and H are groups and œÜ : G ‚Üí H is a homomorphism , then the index of the kernel of œÜ in G is equal to the order of the image:         |  G  :  ker  œÜ  |  =  |  im  œÜ  |  .     fragments  normal-|  G  normal-:  ker  œÜ  normal-|   normal-|  im  œÜ  normal-|  normal-.    |G:\operatorname{ker}\;\varphi|=|\operatorname{im}\;\varphi|.         Let G be a group acting on a set  X , and let x ‚àà X . Then the cardinality of the orbit of x under G is equal to the index of the stabilizer of x :         |  G  x  |  =  |  G  :   G  x   |  .     fragments  normal-|  G  x  normal-|   normal-|  G  normal-:   subscript  G  x   normal-|  normal-.    |Gx|=|G:G_{x}|.\!       This is known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem .    As a special case of the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the number of conjugates  gxg ‚àí1 of an element x ‚àà G is equal to the index of the centralizer of x in G .  Similarly, the number of conjugates gHg ‚àí1 of a subgroup H in G is equal to the index of the normalizer of H in G .  If H is a subgroup of G , the index of the normal core of H satisfies the following inequality:         |  G  :  Core   (  H  )   |  ‚â§  |  G  :  H  |  !     fragments  normal-|  G  normal-:  Core   fragments  normal-(  H  normal-)   normal-|   normal-|  G  normal-:  H  normal-|     |G:\operatorname{Core}(H)|\leq|G:H|!       where ! denotes the factorial function; this is discussed further below .  As a corollary, if the index of H in G is 2, or for a finite group the lowest prime p that divides the order of G, then H is normal, as the index of its core must also be p, and thus H equals its core, i.e., is normal.  Note that a subgroup of lowest prime index may not exist, such as in any simple group of non-prime order, or more generally any perfect group .     Examples   The alternating group     A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   has index 2 in the symmetric group      S  n   ,     subscript  S  n    S_{n},   and thus is normal.  The special orthogonal group  SO ( n ) has index 2 in the orthogonal group  O ( n ), and thus is normal.  The free abelian group  Z ‚äï Z has three subgroups of index 2, namely     \{(x,y) \mid x\text{ is even}\},\quad \{(x,y) \mid y\text{ is even}\},\quad\text{and}\quad     \{(x,y) \mid x+y\text{ is even}\}.   More generally, if p is prime then Z n has ( p n ‚àí¬†1) / ( p ‚àí¬†1) subgroups of index p , corresponding to the p n ‚àí¬†1 nontrivial homomorphisms  Z n ‚Üí Z / p Z .  Similarly, the free group  F n has p n ‚àí¬†1 subgroups of index p .  The infinite dihedral group has a cyclic subgroup of index 2, which is necessarily normal.   Infinite index  If H has an infinite number of cosets in G , then the index of H in G is said to be infinite. In this case, the index | G : H | is actually a cardinal number . For example, the index of H in G may be countable or uncountable , depending on whether H has a countable number of cosets in G . Note that the index of H is at most the order of G, which is realized for the trivial subgroup, or in fact any subgroup H of infinite cardinality less than that of G.  Finite index  An infinite group G may have subgroups H of finite index (for example, the even integers inside the group of integers). Such a subgroup always contains a normal subgroup  N (of G ), also of finite index. In fact, if H has index n , then the index of N can be taken as some factor of n !; indeed, N can be taken to be the kernel of the natural homomorphism from G to the permutation group of the left (or right) cosets of H .  A special case, n = 2, gives the general result that a subgroup of index 2 is a normal subgroup, because the normal group ( N above) must have index 2 and therefore be identical to the original subgroup. More generally, a subgroup of index p where p is the smallest prime factor of the order of G (if G is finite) is necessarily normal, as the index of N divides p ! and thus must equal p, having no other prime factors.  An alternative proof of the result that subgroup of index lowest prime p is normal, and other properties of subgroups of prime index are given in .  Examples  The above considerations are true for finite groups as well. For instance, the group O of chiral octahedral symmetry has 24 elements. It has a dihedral D 4 subgroup (in fact it has three such) of order 8, and thus of index 3 in O , which we shall call H . This dihedral group has a 4-member D 2 subgroup, which we may call A . Multiplying on the right any element of a right coset of H by an element of A gives a member of the same coset of H ( Hca = Hc ). A is normal in O . There are six cosets of A , corresponding to the six elements of the symmetric group S 3 . All elements from any particular coset of A perform the same permutation of the cosets of H .  On the other hand, the group T h of pyritohedral symmetry also has 24 members and a subgroup of index 3 (this time it is a D 2h  prismatic symmetry group, see point groups in three dimensions ), but in this case the whole subgroup is a normal subgroup. All members of a particular coset carry out the same permutation of these cosets, but in this case they represent only the 3-element alternating group in the 6-member S 3 symmetric group.  Normal subgroups of prime power index  Normal subgroups of prime power index are kernels of surjective maps to p -groups and have interesting structure, as described at Focal subgroup theorem: Subgroups and elaborated at focal subgroup theorem .  There are three important normal subgroups of prime power index, each being the smallest normal subgroup in a certain class:   E p ( G ) is the intersection of all index p normal subgroups; G / E p ( G ) is an elementary abelian group , and is the largest elementary abelian p -group onto which G surjects.  A p ( G ) is the intersection of all normal subgroups K such that G / K is an abelian p -group (i.e., K is an index    p  k     superscript  p  k    p^{k}   normal subgroup that contains the derived group    [  G  ,  G  ]     G  G    [G,G]   ): G / A p ( G ) is the largest abelian p -group (not necessarily elementary) onto which G surjects.  O p ( G ) is the intersection of all normal subgroups K of G such that G / K is a (possibly non-abelian) p -group (i.e., K is an index    p  k     superscript  p  k    p^{k}   normal subgroup): G / O p ( G ) is the largest p -group (not necessarily abelian) onto which G surjects. O p ( G ) is also known as the p -residual subgroup .   As these are weaker conditions on the groups K, one obtains the containments         ùêÑ  p    (  G  )    ‚äá    ùêÄ  p    (  G  )    ‚äá    ùêé  p    (  G  )     .       superset-of-or-equals     superscript  ùêÑ  p   G      superscript  ùêÄ  p   G     superset-of-or-equals       superscript  ùêé  p   G      \mathbf{E}^{p}(G)\supseteq\mathbf{A}^{p}(G)\supseteq\mathbf{O}^{p}(G).     These groups have important connections to the Sylow subgroups and the transfer homomorphism, as discussed there.  Geometric structure  An elementary observation is that one cannot have exactly 2 subgroups of index 2, as the complement of their symmetric difference yields a third. This is a simple corollary of the above discussion (namely the projectivization of the vector space structure of the elementary abelian group        G  /   ùêÑ  p     (  G  )    ‚âÖ    (   ùêô  /  p   )   k           G   superscript  ùêÑ  p    G    superscript    ùêô  p   k     G/\mathbf{E}^{p}(G)\cong(\mathbf{Z}/p)^{k}   ),  and further, G does not act on this geometry, nor does it reflect any of the non-abelian structure (in both cases because the quotient is abelian).  However, it is an elementary result, which can be seen concretely as follows: the set of normal subgroups of a given index p form a projective space , namely the projective space       ùêè   (   Hom   (  G  ,   ùêô  /  p   )    )    .      ùêè   Hom  G    ùêô  p      \mathbf{P}(\operatorname{Hom}(G,\mathbf{Z}/p)).     In detail, the space of homomorphisms from G to the (cyclic) group of order p,      Hom   (  G  ,   ùêô  /  p   )    ,     Hom  G    ùêô  p     \operatorname{Hom}(G,\mathbf{Z}/p),   is a vector space over the finite field       ùêÖ  p   =   ùêô  /  p    .       subscript  ùêÖ  p     ùêô  p     \mathbf{F}_{p}=\mathbf{Z}/p.   A non-trivial such map has as kernel a normal subgroup of index p, and multiplying the map by an element of     (   ùêô  /  p   )   √ó     superscript    ùêô  p      (\mathbf{Z}/p)^{\times}   (a non-zero number mod p ) does not change the kernel; thus one obtains a map from      ùêè   (  Hom   (  G  ,  ùêô  /  p  )   )   :=   (  Hom   (  G  ,  ùêô  /  p  )   )   ‚àñ   {  0  }   )  /  (  ùêô  /  p  )    √ó      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  Hom   fragments  normal-(  G  normal-,  Z   p  normal-)   normal-)   assign   fragments  normal-(  Hom   fragments  normal-(  G  normal-,  Z   p  normal-)   normal-)     fragments  normal-{  0  normal-}   normal-)   normal-(  Z   p  normal-)       \mathbf{P}(\operatorname{Hom}(G,\mathbf{Z}/p)):=(\operatorname{Hom}(G,\mathbf{%
 Z}/p))\setminus\{0\})/(\mathbf{Z}/p)^{\times}     to normal index p subgroups. Conversely, a normal subgroup of index p determines a non-trivial map to    ùêô  /  p      ùêô  p    \mathbf{Z}/p   up to a choice of "which coset maps to     1  ‚àà   ùêô  /  p    ,      1    ùêô  p     1\in\mathbf{Z}/p,   which shows that this map is a bijection.  As a consequence, the number of normal subgroups of index p is        (    p   k  +  1    -  1   )   /   (   p  -  1   )    =   1  +  p  +  ‚ãØ  +   p  k             superscript  p    k  1    1     p  1      1  p  normal-‚ãØ   superscript  p  k      (p^{k+1}-1)/(p-1)=1+p+\cdots+p^{k}     for some k;     k  =   -  1       k    1     k=-1   corresponds to no normal subgroups of index p . Further, given two distinct normal subgroups of index p, one obtains a projective line consisting of    p  +  1      p  1    p+1   such subgroups.  For     p  =  2   ,      p  2    p=2,   the symmetric difference of two distinct index 2 subgroups (which are necessarily normal) gives the third point on the projective line containing these subgroups, and a group must contain    0  ,  1  ,  3  ,  7  ,  15  ,  ‚Ä¶     0  1  3  7  15  normal-‚Ä¶    0,1,3,7,15,\ldots   index 2 subgroups ‚Äì it cannot contain exactly 2 or 4 index 2 subgroups, for instance.
