   Locally profinite group      Locally profinite group   In mathematics, a locally profinite group is a hausdorff topological group in which every neighborhood of the identity element contains a compact open subgroup. Equivalently, a locally profinite group is a topological group that is hausdorff locally compact and totally disconnected . Moreover, a locally profinite group is compact if and only if it is profinite ; this explains the terminology. Basic examples of locally profinite groups are discrete groups and p -adic Lie group . Non-examples are real Lie groups which have no small subgroup property .  In a locally profinite group, a closed subgroup is locally profinite, and every compact subgroup is contained in an open compact subgroup.  Examples  Important examples of locally profinite groups come from algebraic number theory. Let F be a non-archimedean local field. Then both F and    F  ×     superscript  F     F^{\times}   are locally profinite. More generally, the matrix ring     M  n    (  F  )       subscript  normal-M  n   F    \operatorname{M}_{n}(F)   and the general linear group     GL  n    (  F  )       subscript  GL  n   F    \operatorname{GL}_{n}(F)   are locally profinite. Another example of a locally profinite group is the absolute Weil group of a non-archimedean local field: this is in contrast to the fact that the absolute Galois group of such is profinite (in particular compact).  Representations of a locally profinite group  Let G be a locally profinite group. Then a group homomorphism    ψ  :   G  →   ℂ  ×       normal-:  ψ   normal-→  G   superscript  ℂ       \psi:G\to\mathbb{C}^{\times}   is continuous if and only if it has open kernel.  Let    (  ρ  ,  V  )     ρ  V    (\rho,V)   be a complex representation of G . 1    ρ   ρ   \rho   is said to be smooth if V is a union of    V  K     superscript  V  K    V^{K}   where K runs over all open compact subgroups K .   ρ   ρ   \rho   is said to be admissible if it is smooth and    V  K     superscript  V  K    V^{K}   is finite-dimensional for any open compact subgroup K .  We now make a blanket assumption that    G  /  K      G  K    G/K   is at most countable for all open compact subgroups K .  The dual space    V  *     superscript  V     V^{*}   carries the action    ρ  *     superscript  ρ     \rho^{*}   of G given by     ⟨    ρ  *    (  g  )   α   ,  v  ⟩   =   ⟨  α  ,    ρ  *    (   g   -  1    )   v   ⟩           superscript  ρ    g  α   v    α     superscript  ρ     superscript  g    1    v      \langle\rho^{*}(g)\alpha,v\rangle=\langle\alpha,\rho^{*}(g^{-1})v\rangle   . In general,    ρ  *     superscript  ρ     \rho^{*}   is not smooth. Thus, we set     V  ~   =    ⋃  K     (   V  *   )   K         normal-~  V     subscript   K    superscript   superscript  V    K      \widetilde{V}=\bigcup_{K}(V^{*})^{K}   where   K   K   K   is acting through    ρ  *     superscript  ρ     \rho^{*}   and set     ρ  ~   =   ρ  *        normal-~  ρ    superscript  ρ      \widetilde{\rho}=\rho^{*}   . The smooth representation    (   ρ  ~   ,   V  ~   )      normal-~  ρ    normal-~  V     (\widetilde{\rho},\widetilde{V})   is then called the contragredient or smooth dual of    (  ρ  ,  V  )     ρ  V    (\rho,V)   .  The contravariant functor       (  ρ  ,  V  )   ↦   (   ρ  ~   ,   V  ~   )      maps-to   ρ  V     normal-~  ρ    normal-~  V      (\rho,V)\mapsto(\widetilde{\rho},\widetilde{V})   from the category of smooth representations of G to itself is exact. Moreover, the following are equivalent.      ρ   ρ   \rho   is admissible.      ρ  ~     normal-~  ρ    \widetilde{\rho}   is admissible. 2  The canonical G -module map    ρ  →    ρ  ~   ~      normal-→  ρ   normal-~   normal-~  ρ      \rho\to\widetilde{\widetilde{\rho}}   is an isomorphism.   When   ρ   ρ   \rho   is admissible,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is irreducible if and only if    ρ  ~     normal-~  ρ    \widetilde{\rho}   is irreducible.  The countability assumption at the beginning is really necessary, for there exists a locally profinite group that admits an irreducible smooth representation   ρ   ρ   \rho   such that    ρ  ~     normal-~  ρ    \widetilde{\rho}   is not irreducible.  Hecke algebra of a locally profinite group      Let   G   G   G   be a unimodular locally profinite group such that    G  /  K      G  K    G/K   is at most countable for all open compact subgroups K , and   ρ   ρ   \rho   a left Haar measure on   G   G   G   . Let     C  c  ∞    (  G  )        subscript   superscript  C    c   G    C^{\infty}_{c}(G)   denote the space of locally constant functions on   G   G   G   with compact support. With the multiplicative structure given by        (   f  *  h   )    (  x  )    =    ∫  G    f   (  g  )   h   (    g   -  1    x   )   d  μ   (  g  )             f  h   x     subscript   G     f  g  h     superscript  g    1    x   d  μ  g      (f*h)(x)=\int_{G}f(g)h(g^{-1}x)d\mu(g)        C  c  ∞    (  G  )        subscript   superscript  C    c   G    C^{\infty}_{c}(G)   becomes not necessarily unital associative   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   -algebra. It is called the Hecke algebra of G and is denoted by    ℌ   (  G  )       ℌ  G    \mathfrak{H}(G)   . The algebra plays an important role in the study of smooth representations of locally profinite groups. Indeed, one has the following: given a smooth representation    (  ρ  ,  V  )     ρ  V    (\rho,V)   of G , we define a new action on V :        ρ   (  f  )    =    ∫  G    f   (  g  )   ρ   (  g  )   d  μ   (  g  )      .        ρ  f     subscript   G     f  g  ρ  g  d  μ  g      \rho(f)=\int_{G}f(g)\rho(g)d\mu(g).   Thus, we have the functor    ρ  ↦  ρ     maps-to  ρ  ρ    \rho\mapsto\rho   from the category of smooth representations of   G   G   G   to the category of non-degenerate    ℌ   (  G  )       ℌ  G    \mathfrak{H}(G)   -modules. Here, "non-degenerate" means     ρ   (   ℌ   (  G  )    )   V   =  V        ρ    ℌ  G   V   V    \rho(\mathfrak{H}(G))V=V   . Then the fact is that the functor is an equivalence. 3  Notes  References   Corinne Blondel, Basic representation theory of reductive p-adic groups 1     "  Category:Topological groups     We do not put a topology on V ; so there is no topological condition on the representation. ↩  Blondel, Corollary 2.8. ↩  Blondel, Proposition 2.16. ↩
