Flavonol 3-sulfotransferase




Flavonol 3-sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a flavonol 3-sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + flavonol
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + flavonol 3-sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and a flavonol, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and flavonol 3-sulfate. A specific examples of a flavonol that can act as a substrate is quercetin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases termed the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:flavonol 3-sulfotransferase.
