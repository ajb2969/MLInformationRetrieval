Bergman space

In complex analysis, functional analysis and operator theory, a Bergman space is a function space of holomorphic functions in a domain D of the complex plane that are sufficiently well-behaved at the boundary that they are absolutely integrable. Specifically, for 
 
 




The quantity 
 
 
 
  is called the norm of the function 
 
 
 
 ; it is a true norm if 
 
 
 
 . Thus  is the subspace of holomorphic functions that are in the space Lp(D). The Bergman spaces are Banach spaces, which is a consequence of the estimate, valid on compact subsets K of D:  Thus convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions in  implies also compact convergence, and so the limit function is also holomorphic.
If 
 
 
 
 , then  is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, whose kernel is given by the Bergman kernel.
Special cases and generalisations
If the domain 
 
 
 
  is bounded, then the norm is often given by



where 
 
 
 
  is a normalised Lebesgue measure of the complex plane, i.e. 
 
 
dz/π}}
is used, regardless of the area of 
 
 
 
 . The Bergman space is usually defined on the open unit disk

 
  of the complex plane, in which case 
 
 
 
 . In the Hilbert space case, given 
 
 
 
 , we have



that is,  is isometrically isomorphic to the weighted ℓp(1/(n+1)) space.1 In particular the polynomials are dense in . Similarly, if  ℂ+)}}, the right (or the upper) complex half-plane, then



where 
 
 
 
 , that is,  is isometrically isomorphic to the weighted Lp1/t (0,∞) space (via the Laplace transform).23
The weighted Bergman space  is defined in an analogous way,4 i.e.



provided that  is chosen in such way, that 
 
 
 
  is a Banach space (or a Hilbert space, if 
 
 
 
 ). In case where 
 
 
 
 , by a weighted Bergman space 
 
 
5 we mean the space of all analytic functions 
 
 
 
  such that



and similarly on the right half-plane (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ) we have6



and this space is isometrically isomorphic, via the Laplace transform, to the space 
 
 
 
 ,78 where



(here 
 
 
 
  denotes the Gamma function).
Further generalisations are sometimes considered, for example 
 
 
 
  denotes a weighted Bergman space (often called a Zen space9) with respect to a translation-invariant positive regular Borel measure

 
  on the closed right complex half-plane 
 
 
 
 , that is



Reproducing kernels
The reproducing kernel 
 
 
 
  of  at point 
 
 
 
  is given by10



and similarly for

In general, if 
 
 
 
  maps a domain 
 
 
 
  conformally onto a domain 
 
 
 
 , then12



In weighted case we have13

$$k_z^{A^2_\alpha(\mathbb{C}_+)} (\zeta) = \frac{2^\alpha(\alpha+1)}{(\overline{z}+\zeta)^{\alpha+2}} \; \; \; \; \; (z, \zeta \in \mathbb{C}_+).$$
