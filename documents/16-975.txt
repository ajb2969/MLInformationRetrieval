Potential predictability

The term potential predictability is used in the context of weather forecasting to describe the extent that the future weather can be predicted in principle, i.e., it describes the proportion of variance in the weather that arises from systematic factors rather than random noise.123
Mathematical formalization
Denote by 
 
 
 
  the standard deviation in weather outcomes, so that 
 
 
 
  is the variance in weather outcomes. Of this, denote by 
 
 
 
  the internally generated variance component and by 
 
 
 
  the unpredictable noise component. We have:4


The potential predictability variance fraction (ppvf) is defined as:



The signal to noise ratio is defined as:



 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be computed from each other:



We have 
 
 
 
 . Small values of 
 
 
 
  indicate that the signal is small, and that the weather is inherently unpredictable. Values of 
 
 
 
  close to 1 suggest that the weather is potentially predictable, even if current weather prediction methods do not predict it successfully.
Research
Potential predictabilities have been estimated for different aspects of the weather and climate system, including heat transport,5 the Madden-Julian oscillation,6 and precipitation.78
