   Sallen–Key topology      Sallen–Key topology  The '''Sallen–Key topology''' is an [[electronic filter topology]] used to implement [[Low-pass filter#Continuous-time low-pass filters|second-order]] [[active filter]]s that is particularly valued for its simplicity. [https://ccnet.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/course.cgi?cc=ee315a&action;=handout_download&handout;_id=ID126954294624704 "EE315A Course Notes - Chapter 2"-B. Murmann] It is a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] form of a '''voltage-controlled voltage-source''' ('''VCVS'' ') filter topology . A VCVS filter uses a super - unity - gain voltage amplifier with practically infinite input impedance and zero output impedance to implement a 2-pole (12 dB/octave) low-pass , high-pass , or bandpass  response . The super-unity-gain amplifier allows for very high Q factor and passband gain without the use of inductors . A Sallen–Key filter is a variation on a VCVS filter that uses a unity-gain amplifier (i.e., a pure buffer amplifier with 0 dB gain). It was introduced by R. P. Sallen and E. L. Key of MIT  Lincoln Laboratory in 1955. 1  Because of its high input impedance and easily selectable gain, an operational amplifier in a conventional non-inverting configuration is often used in VCVS implementations. Implementations of Sallen–Key filters often use an operational amplifier configured as a voltage follower ; however, emitter or source followers are other common choices for the buffer amplifier.  VCVS filters are relatively resilient to component tolerance , but obtaining high Q factor may require extreme component value spread or high amplifier gain. 2 Higher-order filters can be obtained by cascading two or more stages.  Generic Sallen–Key topology  The generic unity-gain Sallen–Key filter topology implemented with a unity-gain operational amplifier is shown in Figure 1. The following analysis is based on the assumption that the operational amplifier is ideal.  (Figure)  Figure 1: The generic Sallen–Key filter topology.   Because the operational amplifier (OA) is in a negative-feedback configuration, its v + and v - inputs must match (i.e., v + = v - ). However, the inverting input v - is connected directly to the output v out , and so          v  +   =   v  -   =   v  out    .         subscript  v     subscript  v          subscript  v  out      v_{+}=v_{-}=v_{\text{out}}.\,           (  1  )    1   (1)\,        By Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) applied at the v x node,            v  in   -   v  x     Z  1    =      v  x   -   v  out     Z  3    +     v  x   -   v  -     Z  2      .           subscript  v  in    subscript  v  x     subscript  Z  1           subscript  v  x    subscript  v  out     subscript  Z  3         subscript  v  x    subscript  v      subscript  Z  2       \frac{v_{\text{in}}-v_{x}}{Z_{1}}=\frac{v_{x}-v_{\text{out}}}{Z_{3}}+\frac{v_{%

 Z_{2})+Z_{3}Z_{4}},           (  5  )    5   (5)\,        which typically describes a second-order LTI system .  Interpretation  If the     Z  3      subscript  Z  3    Z_{3}\,   component were connected to ground, the filter would be a voltage divider composed of the     Z  1      subscript  Z  1    Z_{1}\,   and     Z  3      subscript  Z  3    Z_{3}\,   components cascaded with another voltage divider composed of the     Z  2      subscript  Z  2    Z_{2}\,   and     Z  4      subscript  Z  4    Z_{4}\,   components. The buffer bootstraps the "bottom" of the     Z  3      subscript  Z  3    Z_{3}\,   component to the output of the filter, which will improve upon the simple two divider case. This interpretation is the reason why Sallen–Key filters are often drawn with the operational amplifier's non-inverting input below the inverting input, thus emphasizing the similarity between the output and ground.  Branch impedances  By choosing different passive components (e.g., resistors and capacitors ) for     Z  1      subscript  Z  1    Z_{1}\,   ,     Z  2      subscript  Z  2    Z_{2}\,   ,     Z  4      subscript  Z  4    Z_{4}\,   , and     Z  3      subscript  Z  3    Z_{3}\,   , the filter can be made with low-pass , bandpass , and high-pass characteristics. In the examples below, recall that a resistor with resistance     R    R   R\,   has impedance      Z  R      subscript  Z  normal-R    Z_{\mathrm{R}}\,   of        Z  R   =   R    ,       subscript  Z  normal-R   R    Z_{\mathrm{R}}=R\,,   and a capacitor with capacitance     C    C   C\,   has impedance     Z  C      subscript  Z  normal-C    Z_{\mathrm{C}}\,   of        Z  C   =    1   s  C      ,       subscript  Z  normal-C     1    s  C      Z_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{sC}\,,   where    s  =   j  ω   =    (    -  1    )   2  π   f          s    j  ω              1    2  π  f      s=j\omega=\left(\sqrt{-1}\right)2\pi f\,   is the complex  angular frequency and    f    f   f\,   is the frequency of a pure sine wave input. That is, a capacitor's impedance is frequency dependent and a resistor's impedance is not.  Application: Low-pass filter  An example of a unity-gain low-pass configuration is shown in Figure 2.  (Figure)  Figure 2: A unity-gain low-pass filter implemented with a Sallen–Key topology.   An operational amplifier is used as the buffer here, although an emitter follower is also effective. This circuit is equivalent to the generic case above with         Z  1   =   R  1    ,     Z  2   =   R  2    ,     Z  3   =    1   s   C  1     ,  and      Z  4   =   1   s   C  2         .     formulae-sequence     subscript  Z  1    subscript  R  1     formulae-sequence     subscript  Z  2    subscript  R  2     formulae-sequence     subscript  Z  3      1    s   subscript  C  1     and       subscript  Z  4     1    s   subscript  C  2          Z_{1}=R_{1},\quad Z_{2}=R_{2},\quad Z_{3}=\frac{1}{sC_{1}},\quad\text{and}%
 \quad Z_{4}=\frac{1}{sC_{2}}.\,     The transfer function for this second-order unity-gain low-pass filter is       H   (  s  )    =    ω  0    2     s  2   +   2  α  s   +   ω  0    2           H  s      superscript   subscript  ω  0   2      superscript  s  2     2  α  s    superscript   subscript  ω  0   2       H(s)={{\omega_{0}}^{2}\over s^{2}+2\alpha s+{\omega_{0}}^{2}}     where the undamped natural frequency      f  0      subscript  f  0    f_{0}\,   , attenuation    α   α   \alpha   , and Q factor     Q    Q   Q\,   (i.e., damping ratio    ζ   ζ   \zeta   ) are given by       ω  0   =   2  π   f  0    =   1     R  1    R  2    C  1    C  2             subscript  ω  0     2  π   subscript  f  0           1       subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2         \omega_{0}=2\pi f_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}}}     and        2  α   =   2  ζ   ω  0    =    ω  0   Q   =    1   C  1     (    1   R  1    +   1   R  2     )    =    1   C  1     (     R  1   +   R  2      R  1    R  2     )     .          2  α     2  ζ   subscript  ω  0            subscript  ω  0   Q            1   subscript  C  1        1   subscript  R  1      1   subscript  R  2               1   subscript  C  1         subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2       subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2         2\alpha=2\zeta\omega_{0}=\frac{\omega_{0}}{Q}=\frac{1}{C_{1}}\left(\frac{1}{R_%
 {1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)={1\over C_{1}}\left({R_{1}+R_{2}\over R_{1}R_{2}}%
 \right).\,     So,       Q  =    ω  0    2  α    =      R  1    R  2    C  1    C  2       C  2    (    R  1   +   R  2    )            Q     subscript  ω  0     2  α                subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2    subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2        subscript  C  2      subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2         Q={\omega_{0}\over 2\alpha}=\frac{\sqrt{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}}}{C_{2}\left(R_{1%
 }+R_{2}\right)}\qquad     The    Q    Q   Q\,   factor determines the height and width of the peak of the frequency response of the filter. As this parameter increases, the filter will tend to "ring" at a single resonant  frequency near     f  0      subscript  f  0    f_{0}\,   (see " LC filter " for a related discussion).  Poles and zeros  This transfer function has no (finite) zeros and two poles located in the complex s -plane :      s  =    -  α   ±   j     α  2   -   ω  0    2           s   plus-or-minus    α     j       superscript  α  2    superscript   subscript  ω  0   2         s=-\alpha\pm j\sqrt{\alpha^{2}-{\omega_{0}}^{2}}     There are two zeros at infinity (the transfer function goes to zero for each of the s terms in the denominator)  Design choices  A designer must choose the    Q    Q   Q\,   and     f  0      subscript  f  0    f_{0}\,   appropriate for their application. The   Q   Q   Q   value is critical in determining the eventual shape. For example, a second-order Butterworth filter , which has maximally flat passband frequency response, has a    Q    Q   Q\,   of    1  /    2        1    2     1/\sqrt{2}\,   . By comparison, a value of    Q  =   1  /  2       Q    1  2     Q=1/2   corresponds to the series of two identical simple low-pass filters.  Because there are two parameters and four unknowns, the design procedure typically fixes one resistor as a ratio of the other resistor and one capacitor as a ratio of the other capacitor. One possibility is to set the ratio between     C  1      subscript  C  1    C_{1}\,   and     C  2      subscript  C  2    C_{2}\,   as    n    n   n\,   and the ratio between     R  1      subscript  R  1    R_{1}\,   and     R  2      subscript  R  2    R_{2}\,   as    m    m   m\,   . So,        R  1   =   m  R    ,       subscript  R  1     m  R     R_{1}=mR,\,           R  2   =  R   ,       subscript  R  2   R    R_{2}=R,\,           C  1   =   n  C    ,       subscript  C  1     n  C     C_{1}=nC,\,           C  2   =  C   .       subscript  C  2   C    C_{2}=C.\,     Therefore, the     f  0      subscript  f  0    f_{0}\,   and    Q    Q   Q\,   expressions are        ω  0   =   2  π   f  0    =   1   R  C    m  n       ,         subscript  ω  0     2  π   subscript  f  0           1    R  C      m  n         \omega_{0}=2\pi f_{0}=\frac{1}{RC\sqrt{mn}},\,     and       Q  =     m  n     m  +  1     .      Q        m  n      m  1      Q=\frac{\sqrt{mn}}{m+1}.     In practice, certain choices of component values will perform better than others due to the non-idealities of real operational amplifiers. 3  Example  For example, the circuit in Figure 3 has an     f  0      subscript  f  0    f_{0}\,   of     15.9    kHz       15.9  kHz    15.9\,\text{kHz}\,   and a    Q    Q   Q\,   of    0.5    0.5   0.5\,   . The transfer function is given by        H   (  s  )    =   1   1  +       C  2    (    R  1   +   R  2    )    ⏟      2  ζ    ω  0    =   1    ω  0   Q      s   +       C  1    C  2    R  1    R  2    ⏟    1   ω  0    2      s  2       ,        H  s     1    1     subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  C  2      subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2            2  ζ    subscript  ω  0      1     subscript  ω  0   Q      s      subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2    subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2       1   superscript   subscript  ω  0   2      superscript  s  2        H(s)=\frac{1}{1+\underbrace{C_{2}(R_{1}+R_{2})}_{\frac{2\zeta}{\omega_{0}}=%
 \frac{1}{\omega_{0}Q}}s+\underbrace{C_{1}C_{2}R_{1}R_{2}}_{\frac{1}{{\omega_{0%
 }}^{2}}}s^{2}},     and, after substitution, this expression is equal to       H   (  s  )    =   1   1  +      R  C   (   m  +  1   )    ⏟      2  ζ    ω  0    =   1    ω  0   Q      s   +      m  n   R  2    C  2    ⏟    1   ω  0    2      s  2            H  s     1    1     subscript   normal-⏟    R  C    m  1           2  ζ    subscript  ω  0      1     subscript  ω  0   Q      s      subscript   normal-⏟    m  n   superscript  R  2    superscript  C  2       1   superscript   subscript  ω  0   2      superscript  s  2        H(s)=\frac{1}{1+\underbrace{RC(m+1)}_{\frac{2\zeta}{\omega_{0}}=\frac{1}{%

A similar design approach is used for the other filters below.  Input Impedance  The input impedance of the second-order unity-gain Sallen-Key low-pass filter is also of interest to designers. It is given by Eq.

Furthermore, for    Q  >     1  -   k  2    2        Q        1   superscript  k  2    2      Q>\sqrt{\frac{1-k^{2}}{2}}   , there is a minimum value of the magnitude of the impedance, given by Eq. (16) of Cartwright and Kaminsky, 5 which states that        |   Z   (  s  )    |    m  i  n    =    R  1     1  -     (     2   Q  2    +   k  2    -  1   )   2     2   Q  4    +    k  2     (     2   Q  2    +   k  2    -  1   )   2    +   2   Q  2      Q  4   +    k  2    (     2   Q  2    +   k  2    -  1   )                 subscript      Z  s      m  i  n       subscript  R  1       1     superscript        2   superscript  Q  2     superscript  k  2    1   2       2   superscript  Q  4       superscript  k  2    superscript        2   superscript  Q  2     superscript  k  2    1   2      2   superscript  Q  2        superscript  Q  4      superscript  k  2         2   superscript  Q  2     superscript  k  2    1              |Z(s)|_{min}=R_{1}\sqrt{1-\frac{(2Q^{2}+k^{2}-1)^{2}}{2Q^{4}+k^{2}(2Q^{2}+k^{2%

For   k   k   k   values outside of this range, the 0.34 constant has to be modified for minimum error.  Also, the frequency at which the minimum impedance magnitude occurs is given by Eq.

Application: Bandpass filter  An example of a non-unity-gain bandpass filter implemented with a VCVS filter is shown in Figure 5. Although it uses a different topology and an operational amplifier configured to provide non-unity-gain, it can be analyzed using similar methods as with the generic Sallen–Key topology .
