   Rotational transition      Rotational transition   A rotational transition is an abrupt change in angular momentum in quantum physics . Like all other properties of a quantum particle , angular momentum is quantized , meaning it can only equal certain discrete values, which correspond to different rotational energy states. When a particle loses angular momentum, it is said to have transitioned to a lower rotational energy state. Likewise, when a particle gains angular momentum, a positive rotational transition is said to have occurred.  Rotational transitions are important in physics due to the unique spectral lines that result. Because there is a net gain or loss of energy during a transition, electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency must be absorbed or emitted. This forms spectral lines at that frequency which can be detected with a spectrometer , as in rotational spectroscopy or Raman spectroscopy .  Diatomic molecules  Molecules have rotational energy owing to rotational motion of the nuclei about their center of mass . Due to quantization , these energies can take only certain discrete values. Rotational transition thus corresponds to transition of the molecule from one rotational energy level to the other through gain or loss of a photon . Analysis is simple in the case of diatomic molecules .  Nuclear wave function  Quantum theoretical analysis of a molecule is simplified by use of Born–Oppenheimer approximation . Typically, rotational energies of molecules are smaller than electronic transition energies by a factor of m/M ≈ 10 −3 – 10 −5 , where m is electronic mass and M is typical nuclear mass. 1 From uncertainty principle , period of motion is of the order of Planck's constant  h divided by its energy. Hence nuclear rotational periods are much longer than the electronic periods. So electronic and nuclear motions can be treated separately. In the simple case of a diatomic molecule, the radial part of the Schrödinger Equation for a nuclear wave function F s ( R ), in an electronic state s, is written as (neglecting spin interactions)        [     -     ℏ  2    2  μ   R  2      ∂   ∂  R     (    R  2    ∂   ∂  R     )     +    ⟨   Φ  s   |   N  2   |   Φ  s   ⟩    2  μ   R  2     +    E  s    (  R  )     -  E   ]    F  s    (  𝐑  )    =  0         delimited-[]             superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  μ   superscript  R  2          R       superscript  R  2        R          quantum-operator-product   subscript  normal-Φ  s    superscript  N  2    subscript  normal-Φ  s      2  μ   superscript  R  2        subscript  E  s   R    E     subscript  F  s   𝐑   0    \left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2\mu R^{2}}\frac{\partial}{\partial R}\left(R^{2}\frac%

 \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\Phi^{2}}\right]   The total wave function for the molecule is       Ψ  s   =   F  s    (  𝐑  )    Φ  s    (  𝐑  ,   𝐫  1   ,   𝐫  2   ,  …  .  ,   𝐫  N   )      fragments   subscript  normal-Ψ  s     subscript  F  s    fragments  normal-(  R  normal-)    subscript  normal-Φ  s    fragments  normal-(  R  normal-,   subscript  𝐫  1   normal-,   subscript  𝐫  2   normal-,  normal-…  normal-.  normal-,   subscript  𝐫  N   normal-)     \Psi_{s}=F_{s}(\mathbf{R})\Phi_{s}(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{r}_{1},\mathbf{r}_{2},..%
 ..,\mathbf{r}_{N})   where r i are position vectors from center of mass of molecule to i th electron. As a consequence of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the electronic wave functions Φ s is considered to vary very slowly with R . Thus the Schrödinger equation for an electronic wave function is first solved to obtain E s (R) for different values of R. E s then plays role of a potential well in analysis of nuclear wave functions F s ( R ).  (Figure)  Vector addition triangle for orbital angular momentum of a diatomic molecule with components of orbital angular momentum of nuclei and orbital angular momentum of electrons, neglecting coupling between electron and nuclear orbital motion and spin-dependent coupling.Since angular momentum N of nuclei is perpendicular to internuclear vector R , components of electronic angular momentum L and total angular momentum J along R are equal.   Rotational energy levels  The first term in the above nuclear wave function equation corresponds to kinetic energy of nuclei due to their radial motion. Term s|N 2 |Φ s >/2μR 2 represents rotational kinetic energy of the two nuclei, about their center of mass, in a given electronic state Φ s . Possible values of the same are different rotational energy levels for the molecule.  Orbital angular momentum for the rotational motion of nuclei can be written as      𝐍  =   𝐉  -  𝐋       𝐍    𝐉  𝐋     \mathbf{N}=\mathbf{J}-\mathbf{L}   where J is the total orbital angular momentum of the whole molecule and L is the orbital angular momentum of the electrons. If internuclear vector R is taken along z-axis, component of N along z-axis - N z - becomes zero as      𝐍  =   𝐑  ×  𝐏       𝐍    𝐑  𝐏     \mathbf{N}=\mathbf{R}\times\mathbf{P}   Hence       J  z   =   L  z        subscript  J  z    subscript  L  z     J_{z}=L_{z}   Since molecular wave function Ψ s is a simultaneous eigenfunction of J 2 and J z ,        J  2    Ψ  s    =   J   (   J  +  1   )    ℏ  2    Ψ  s           superscript  J  2    subscript  normal-Ψ  s      J    J  1    superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2    subscript  normal-Ψ  s      J^{2}\Psi_{s}=J(J+1)\hbar^{2}\Psi_{s}   where J is called rotational quantum number and J can be a positive integer or zero.        J  z    Ψ  s    =    M  j   ℏ   Ψ  s           subscript  J  z    subscript  normal-Ψ  s       subscript  M  j   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  normal-Ψ  s      J_{z}\Psi_{s}=M_{j}\hbar\Psi_{s}   where -J ≤ M j ≤ J.  Also since electronic wave function Φ s is an eigenfunction of L z ,        L  z    Φ  s    =   ±   Λ  ℏ   Φ  s            subscript  L  z    subscript  normal-Φ  s     plus-or-minus    normal-Λ  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  normal-Φ  s       L_{z}\Phi_{s}=\pm\Lambda\hbar\Phi_{s}   Hence molecular wave function Ψ s is also an eigenfunction of L z with eigenvalue ±Λ ħ . Since L z and J z are equal, Ψ s is an eigenfunction of J z with same eigenvalue ±Λ ħ . As | J | ≥ J z , we have J ≥ Λ. So possible values of rotational quantum number are      J  =   Λ  ,   Λ  +  1   ,   Λ  +  2   ,   …  …        J   normal-Λ    normal-Λ  1     normal-Λ  2     normal-…  normal-…      J=\Lambda,\Lambda+1,\Lambda+2,......   Thus molecular wave function Ψ s is simultaneous eigenfunction of J 2 , J z and L z . Since molecule is in eigenstate of L z , expectation value of components perpendicular to the direction of z-axis (internuclear line) is zero. Hence       ⟨   Ψ  s   |   L  x   |   Ψ  s   ⟩   =   ⟨   L  x   ⟩   =  0         quantum-operator-product   subscript  normal-Ψ  s    subscript  L  x    subscript  normal-Ψ  s     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  L  x         0     \langle\Psi_{s}|L_{x}|\Psi_{s}\rangle=\langle L_{x}\rangle=0   and       ⟨   Ψ  s   |   L  y   |   Ψ  s   ⟩   =   ⟨   L  y   ⟩   =  0         quantum-operator-product   subscript  normal-Ψ  s    subscript  L  y    subscript  normal-Ψ  s     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  L  y         0     \langle\Psi_{s}|L_{y}|\Psi_{s}\rangle=\langle L_{y}\rangle=0   Thus       ⟨  𝐉  .

 2\mu R^{2}}\langle\Phi_{s}|{L_{x}}^{2}+{L_{y}}^{2}|\Phi_{s}\rangle   E' s now serves as effective potential in radial nuclear wave function equation.  Sigma states  Molecular states in which the total orbital momentum of electrons is zero are called sigma states . In sigma states Λ=0. Thus E' s (R) = E s (R). As nuclear motion for a stable molecule is generally confined to a small interval around R 0 where R 0 corresponds to internuclear distance for minimum value of potential E s (R 0 ), rotational energies are given by,       E  r   =     ℏ  2    2  μ   R  0    2     J   (   J  +  1   )    =     ℏ  2    2   I  0     J   (   J  +  1   )    =   B  J   (   J  +  1   )           subscript  E  r        superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  μ   superscript   subscript  R  0   2     J    J  1              superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2   subscript  I  0     J    J  1           B  J    J  1       E_{r}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2\mu{R_{0}}^{2}}J(J+1)=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2I_{0}}J(J+1)=%
 BJ(J+1)   with      J  =   Λ  ,   Λ  +  1   ,   Λ  +  2   ,   …  …        J   normal-Λ    normal-Λ  1     normal-Λ  2     normal-…  normal-…      J=\Lambda,\Lambda+1,\Lambda+2,......   I 0 is moment of inertia of the molecule corresponding to equilibrium distance R 0 and B is called rotational constant for a given electronic state Φ s . Since reduced mass μ is much greater than electronic mass, last two terms in the expression of E' s (R) are small compared to E s . Hence even for states other than sigma states, rotational energy is approximately given by above expression.  Rotational spectrum  When a rotational transition occurs, there is a change in the value of rotational quantum number J. Selection rules for rotational transition are, when Λ = 0, ΔJ = ±1 and when Λ ≠ 0, ΔJ = 0, ±1 as absorbed or emitted photon can make equal and opposite change in total nuclear angular momentum and total electronic angular momentum without changing value of J.  The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infrared or microwave region. The frequency of these lines is given by       ℏ  ω   =     E  r    (   J  +  1   )    -    E  r    (  J  )     =   2  B   (   J  +  1   )            Planck-constant-over-2-pi  ω        subscript  E  r     J  1       subscript  E  r   J           2  B    J  1       \hbar\omega=E_{r}(J+1)-E_{r}(J)=2B(J+1)   Thus values of B, I 0 and R 0 of a substance can be determined from observed rotational spectrum.
