Elongatedness

 In image processing, elongatedness for a region is the ratio between the length and width of the minimum bounding rectangle of the region. It is considered a  feature of the region. It can be evaluated as the ratio between the area of the region to its thickness squared:

 where the maximum thickness, 
 
 
 
 , of a holeless region is given by the number of times the region can be eroded before disappearing.1
