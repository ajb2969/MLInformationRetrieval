   Elongatedness      Elongatedness   In image processing , elongatedness for a region is the ratio between the length and width of the minimum bounding rectangle of the region. It is considered a feature of the region. It can be evaluated as the ratio between the area of the region to its thickness squared:       e  l  o  n  g  a  t  e  d  n  e  s  s   =    l  e  n  g  t  h    w  i  d  t  h    =    a  r  e  a     (   2  d   )   2            e  l  o  n  g  a  t  e  d  n  e  s  s       l  e  n  g  t  h     w  i  d  t  h             a  r  e  a    superscript    2  d   2       elongatedness=\frac{length}{width}=\frac{area}{(2d)^{2}}   .  where the maximum thickness,   d   d   d   , of a holeless region is given by the number of times the region can be eroded before disappearing. 1  References    "  Category:Image processing     Shape representation and description: Region-based shape representation and description â†©
