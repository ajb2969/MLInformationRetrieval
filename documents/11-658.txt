   Acetylornithine deacetylase      Acetylornithine deacetylase   In enzymology , an acetylornithine deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 2 -acetyl-L-ornithine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + L-ornithine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N2-acetyl-L-ornithine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acetate and L-ornithine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-acetyl-L-ornithine amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include acetylornithinase , N-acetylornithinase , and 2-N-acetyl-L-ornithine amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
