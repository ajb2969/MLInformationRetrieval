   Hybrid difference scheme      Hybrid difference scheme   The hybrid difference scheme 1 2 is a method used in the numerical solution for convection–diffusion problems. It was first introduces by Spalding (1970). It is a combination of central difference scheme and upwind difference scheme as it exploits the favorable properties of both of these schemes. 3 4  Introduction 5  Hybrid difference scheme is a method used in the numerical solution for convection-diffusion problems. These problems play important roles in computational fluid dynamics. It can be described by the general partial equation as follows: 6         ∂   ∂  t     (   ρ  ϕ   )    +   ∇   (   ρ  𝐮  ϕ   )     =    ∇   (   Γ  ⋅   grad  ϕ    )    +   S  ϕ                 t      ρ  ϕ     normal-∇    ρ  𝐮  ϕ        normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-Γ   grad  ϕ      subscript  S  ϕ      \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho\phi)+\nabla(\rho\mathbf{u}\phi)\,=\nabla(%
 \Gamma\cdot\operatorname{grad}\phi)+S_{\phi}        absent   \;   ( 1 )  Where,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is density,   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is the velocity vector,   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the diffusion coefficient and    S  ϕ     subscript  S  ϕ    S_{\phi}   is the source term. In this equation property,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   can be temperature, internal energy or component of velocity vector   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   in x, y and z directions.  For one-dimensional analysis of convection-diffusion problem in steady state and without the source the equation reduces to,       ϕ   (  0  )    =   ϕ  0         ϕ  0    subscript  ϕ  0     \phi(0)\,=\phi_{0}   ( 2 )  With boundary conditions,     ϕ   (  L  )    =   ϕ  L         ϕ  L    subscript  ϕ  L     \phi(L)\,=\phi_{L}   and    ϕ  0     subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}   , where L is the length,    ϕ  L     subscript  ϕ  L    \phi_{L}   and      ∫   C  V      ∇   (   ρ  𝐮  ϕ   )     d   V      =    ∫  A     𝐧  ⋅   (   ρ  𝐮  ϕ   )    d  A          subscript     C  V      normal-∇    ρ  𝐮  ϕ      d  V       subscript   A      normal-⋅  𝐧    ρ  𝐮  ϕ    d  A      \int_{CV}\nabla(\rho\mathbf{u}\phi)dV\,=\int_{A}\mathbf{n}\cdot(\rho\mathbf{u}%

The equation must also satisfy the continuity equation, i.e.,       absent   \;   = 0     F   =   ρ  u  A       F    ρ  u  A     F\,=\rho uA   ( 5 )  Now let us define variables F and D to represent the convection mass flux and diffusion conductance at cell faces,       absent   \;        absent   \;   and     D   =    Γ  A    δ  x        D      normal-Γ  A     δ  x      D\,=\frac{\Gamma A}{\delta x}        absent   \;          F  r    ϕ  r    -    F  l     ϕ  l      =     D  r    (    ϕ  R   -   ϕ  N    )    -    D  l    (    ϕ  N   -   ϕ  L    )              subscript  F  r    subscript  ϕ  r       subscript  F  l    subscript  ϕ  l          subscript  D  r      subscript  ϕ  R    subscript  ϕ  N        subscript  D  l      subscript  ϕ  N    subscript  ϕ  L        F_{r}\phi_{r}-F_{l}\phi_{l}\,=D_{r}(\phi_{R}-\phi_{N})-D_{l}(\phi_{N}-\phi_{L})   ( 6 )  Hence, equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) transform into the following equations:       absent   \;         F  r   -    F  l     =  0         subscript  F  r    subscript  F  l    0    F_{r}-F_{l}\,=0   ( 7 )       absent   \;        P   e    =    F  D    =    ρ  u     Γ  /  δ   x            P  e     F  D            ρ  u       normal-Γ  δ   x       Pe\,=\frac{F}{D}\,=\frac{\rho u}{\Gamma/\delta x}   ( 8 )  Where, the lower case letters denote the values at the faces and the upper case letters denote that at the nodes.

Hence approximations are required to fulfill this.

It makes use of the central difference scheme, which is second order accurate, for small Peclet numbers (|Pe|  2) it uses the Upwind difference scheme, which first order accurate but takes into account the convection of the fluid.  As it can be seen in figure 4 that for Pe = 0, it is a linear distribution and for high Pe it takes the upstream value depending on the flow direction. For example the value at the left face, in different circumstances is,       absent   \;        absent   \;   for     -  2   <   P   e  l    <  2          2     P   subscript  e  l         2     -2        absent   \;         ϕ  l    =   ϕ  L        subscript  ϕ  l    subscript  ϕ  L     \phi_{l}\,=\phi_{L}   ( 14 )       absent   \;        absent   \;   for    P   e  l   ≥  2      P   subscript  e  l   ≥  2    Pe_{l}\text{≥}2        absent   \;         ϕ  l    =   ϕ  N        subscript  ϕ  l    subscript  ϕ  N     \phi_{l}\,=\phi_{N}   ( 15 )       absent   \;        absent   \;   for     P   e  l   ≤   -  2        P   subscript  e  l   ≤   2    Pe_{l}\text{≤}-2        absent   \;       a  L     subscript  a  L    a_{L}   ( 16 )  Substituting these values in equation ( 7 ) we get the same equation ( 11 ) with the values of the coefficients as follows,            a  R     subscript  a  R    a_{R}          a  N     subscript  a  N    a_{N}          max   [   F  l   ,   (    D  l   +    F  l   2    )   ,  0  ]        subscript  F  l      subscript  D  l      subscript  F  l   2    0    \max\left[F_{l},\left(D_{l}+\frac{F_{l}}{2}\right),0\right]              max   [   F  r   ,   (    D  r   +    F  r   2    )   ,  0  ]        subscript  F  r      subscript  D  r      subscript  F  r   2    0    \max\left[F_{r},\left(D_{r}+\frac{F_{r}}{2}\right),0\right]           a  r   +   a  l   +   (    F  r   -   F  l    )        subscript  a  r    subscript  a  l      subscript  F  r    subscript  F  l      a_{r}+a_{l}+(F_{r}-F_{l})      $$a_{r} + a_{l} + (F_{r} - F_{l})$$       Advantages and disadvantages of the hybrid difference scheme  It exploits the favourable properties of the central difference and upwind scheme. It switches to upwind difference scheme when central difference scheme produces inaccurate results for high Peclet numbers. It produces physically realistic solution and has proved to be helpful in the prediction of practical flows.  The only disadvantage associated with hybrid difference scheme is that the accuracy in terms of Taylor series truncation error is only first order.
