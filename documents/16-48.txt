   (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene synthase ((2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing)      (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene synthase ((2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing)   (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene synthase ((2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing) (, SBS ) is an enzyme with system name (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate lyase (cyclizing; (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (-)-endo-alpha-bergamotene + diphosphate    The enzyme synthesizes a mixture of sesquiterpenoids from (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate.
