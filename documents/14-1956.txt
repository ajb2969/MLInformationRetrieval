   Dini–Lipschitz criterion      Dini–Lipschitz criterion   In mathematics, the Dini–Lipschitz criterion is a sufficient condition for the Fourier series of a periodic function to converge uniformly at all real numbers . It was introduced by , as a strengthening of a weaker criterion introduced by . The criterion states that the Fourier series of a periodic function f converges uniformly on the real line if        lim   δ  →   0  +      ω   (  δ  ,  f  )    log   (  δ  )      =  0        subscript    normal-→  δ   superscript  0        ω   δ  f     δ     0    \lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0^{+}}\omega(\delta,f)\log(\delta)=0   where ω is the modulus of continuity of f with respect to δ.
