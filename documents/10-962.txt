Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NAD+)

In enzymology, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NAD+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + NADH + H+

 
  acyl-CoA + NAD+


Thus, the three substrates of this enzyme are trans-didehydroacyl-CoA, NADH, and H+, whereas its two products are acyl-CoA and NAD+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:NAD+ trans-2-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NAD+). This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism.
