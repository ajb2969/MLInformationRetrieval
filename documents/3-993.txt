Gummel plot

In electronics, the Gummel plot is the combined plot of the base and collector electric currents, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , of a bipolar transistor vs. the base-emitter voltage, 
 
 
 
 , on a semi-logarithmic scale. This plot is very useful in device characterization because it reflects on the quality of the emitter-base junction while the base-collector bias, 
 
 
 
 , is kept at a constant.
A number of other device parameters can be garnered either quantitatively or qualitatively directly from the Gummel plot:1

the common-emitter current gain, 
 
 
 
 , and the common-base current gain, 
 
 

base and collector ideality factors, 
 
 

series resistances and leakage currents.

Sometimes the DC current gain, 
 
 
 
 , is plotted on the same figure as well.
