Methylphosphonate synthase (, mpnS (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate:O2 1,2-oxidoreductase (methylphosphonate forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-hydroxyethylphosphonate + O2

 
  methylphosphonate + HCO3−


Methylphosphonate synthase is isolated from the marine archaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus.
