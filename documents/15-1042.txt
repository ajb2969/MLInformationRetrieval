   Methylphosphonate synthase      Methylphosphonate synthase   Methylphosphonate synthase (, mpnS (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate:O 2 1,2-oxidoreductase (methylphosphonate forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2-hydroxyethylphosphonate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methylphosphonate + HCO 3−    Methylphosphonate synthase is isolated from the marine archaeon  Nitrosopumilus maritimus .
