Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase




Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase

In enzymology, a Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine + H2O 
 
 
 
  benzyl alcohol + CO2 + L-leucine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine and H2O, whereas its 3 products are benzyl alcohol, CO2, and L-leucine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine urethanehydrolase. Other names in common use include benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase, Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl amino acid urethane hydrolase IV, and alpha-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine urethanehydrolase.
