   Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase      Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase   In enzymology , a Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzyl alcohol + CO 2 + L-leucine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are benzyl alcohol , CO 2 , and L-leucine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine urethanehydrolase . Other names in common use include benzyloxycarbonylleucine hydrolase , Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl amino acid urethane hydrolase IV , and alpha-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-leucine urethanehydrolase .
