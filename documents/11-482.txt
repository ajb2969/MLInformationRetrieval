   Fusarinine-C ornithinesterase      Fusarinine-C ornithinesterase   In enzymology , a fusarinine-C ornithinesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 5 -acyl-L-ornithine ester + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N 5 -acyl-L-ornithine + an alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N5-acyl-L-ornithine ester and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N5-acyl-L-ornithine and alcohol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N5-acyl-L-ornithine-ester hydrolase . Other names in common use include ornithine esterase , and 5-N-acyl-L-ornithine-ester hydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
