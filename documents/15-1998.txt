   Tryptophan synthase (indole-salvaging)      Tryptophan synthase (indole-salvaging)   Tryptophan synthase (indole-salvaging) (, tryptophan synthase beta2 ) is an enzyme with system name L-serine hydro-lyase (adding indole, L-tryptophan-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   L- serine + indole    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L- tryptophan + H 2 O   This enzyme salvages the lost indole to L-tryptophan.
