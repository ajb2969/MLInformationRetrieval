Tryptophan synthase (indole-salvaging)

Tryptophan synthase (indole-salvaging) (, tryptophan synthase beta2) is an enzyme with system name L-serine hydro-lyase (adding indole, L-tryptophan-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-serine + indole

 
  L-tryptophan + H2O
 

This enzyme salvages the lost indole to L-tryptophan.
