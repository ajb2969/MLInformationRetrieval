   Phosphatidylcholine—dolichol O-acyltransferase      Phosphatidylcholine—dolichol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylcholine---dolichol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-sn-phosphatidylcholine + dolichol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + acyldolichol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine and dolichol , whereas its two products are 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and acyldolichol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine:dolichol O-acyltransferase .  References      "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
