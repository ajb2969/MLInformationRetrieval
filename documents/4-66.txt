   Hyperkähler manifold      Hyperkähler manifold   In differential geometry , a hyperkähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold of dimension 4 k and holonomy group contained in Sp( k ) (here Sp( k ) denotes a compact form of a symplectic group , identified with the group of quaternionic-linear unitary endomorphisms of a   k   k   k   -dimensional quaternionic Hermitian space). Hyperkähler manifolds are special classes of Kähler manifolds . They can be thought of as quaternionic analogues of Kähler manifolds. All hyperkähler manifolds are Ricci-flat and are thus Calabi–Yau manifolds (this can be easily seen by noting that Sp( k ) is a subgroup of SU(2 k ) ).  Hyperkähler manifolds were defined by E. Calabi in 1978.  Quaternionic structure  Every hyperkähler manifold M has a 2-sphere of complex structures (i.e. integrable almost complex structures ) with respect to which the metric is Kähler.  In particular, it is an almost quaternionic manifold, meaning that there are three distinct complex structures, I , J, and K, which satisfy the quaternion relations       I  2   =   J  2   =   K  2   =   I  J  K   =   -   1.           superscript  I  2    superscript  J  2         superscript  K  2          I  J  K          1.      I^{2}=J^{2}=K^{2}=IJK=-1.\,     Any linear combination       a  I   +   b  J   +   c   K          a  I     b  J     c  K     aI+bJ+cK\,     with    a  ,  b  ,  c     a  b  c    a,b,c   real numbers such that        a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2    =   1          superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2    1    a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=1\,     is also a complex structure on M . In particular, the tangent space T x M is a quaternionic vector space for each point x of M . Sp( k ) can be considered as the group of orthogonal transformations of     ℝ   4  k    =   ℍ  k        superscript  ℝ    4  k     superscript  ℍ  k     \mathbb{R}^{4k}=\mathbb{H}^{k}   which are linear with respect to I , J and K . From this it follows that the holonomy of the manifold is contained in Sp( k ). Conversely, if the holonomy group of the Riemannian manifold M is contained in Sp( k ), choose complex structures I x , J x and K x on T x M which make T x M into a quaternionic vector space. Parallel transport of these complex structures gives the required quaternionic structure on M .  Holomorphic symplectic form  A hyperkähler manifold (M,I,J,K) , considered as a complex manifold ( M , I ), is holomorphically symplectic (equipped with a holomorphic, non-degenerate 2-form). The converse is also true in the case of compact manifolds, due to Yau 's proof of the Calabi conjecture: Given a compact, Kähler, holomorphically symplectic manifold ( M , I ), it is always equipped with a compatible hyperkähler metric. Such a metric is unique in a given Kähler class. Compact hyperkähler manifolds have been extensively studied using techniques from algebraic geometry , sometimes under a name holomorphically symplectic manifolds . Due to Bogomolov 's decomposition theorem (1974), the holonomy group of a compact holomorphically symplectic manifold M is exactly Sp( k ) if and only if M is simply connected and any pair of holomorphic symplectic forms on M are scalar multiples of each other.  Examples  Due to Kodaira 's classification of complex surfaces, we know that any compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is either a K3 surface or a compact torus    T  4     superscript  T  4    T^{4}   . (Every Calabi–Yau manifold in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperkähler manifold, because SU(2) is isomorphic to Sp(1) .)  A Hilbert scheme of points on a compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is again hyperkähler. This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and generalized Kummer varieties .  Non-compact, complete, hyperkähler 4-manifolds which are asymptotic to H / G , where H denotes the quaternions and G is a finite subgroup of Sp(1), are known as asymptotically locally Euclidean , or ALE, spaces. These spaces, and various generalizations involving different asymptotic behaviors, are studied in physics under the name gravitational instantons . The Gibbons–Hawking ansatz gives examples invariant under a circle action.  Many examples of noncompact hyperkähler manifolds arise as moduli spaces of solutions to certain gauge theory equations which arise from the dimensional reduction of the anti-self dual Yang–Mills equations: instanton moduli spaces, monopole moduli spaces, spaces of solutions to Hitchin's self-duality equations on Riemann surfaces , space of solutions to Nahm's equations. Another class of examples are the Nakajima quiver varieties , which are of great importance in representation theory.
