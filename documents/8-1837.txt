   Convergence in measure      Convergence in measure   Convergence in measure can refer to two distinct mathematical concepts which both generalize the concept of convergence in probability .  Definitions  Let    f  ,    f  n     (  n  ∈  ℕ  )   :  X  →  ℝ     fragments  f  normal-,   subscript  f  n    fragments  normal-(  n   N  normal-)   normal-:  X  normal-→  R    f,f_{n}\ (n\in\mathbb{N}):X\to\mathbb{R}   be measurable functions on a measure space ( X ,Σ, μ ). The sequence ( f n ) is said to converge globally in measure to f if for every ε > 0,        lim   n  →  ∞     μ   (   {   x  ∈  X   :    |    f   (  x  )    -    f  n    (  x  )     |   ≥  ε   }   )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n       μ   conditional-set    x  X           f  x      subscript  f  n   x     ε      0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(\{x\in X:|f(x)-f_{n}(x)|\geq\varepsilon\})=0   ,  and to converge locally in measure to f if for every ε > 0 and every    F  ∈  Σ      F  normal-Σ    F\in\Sigma   with     μ   (  F  )    <  ∞        μ  F      \mu(F)<\infty   ,        lim   n  →  ∞     μ   (   {   x  ∈  F   :    |    f   (  x  )    -    f  n    (  x  )     |   ≥  ε   }   )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n       μ   conditional-set    x  F           f  x      subscript  f  n   x     ε      0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(\{x\in F:|f(x)-f_{n}(x)|\geq\varepsilon\})=0   .  Convergence in measure can refer to either global convergence in measure or local convergence in measure, depending on the author.  Properties  Throughout, f and f n ( n    ∈     \in    N ) are measurable functions X → R .   Global convergence in measure implies local convergence in measure. The converse, however, is false; i.e. , local convergence in measure is strictly weaker than global convergence in measure, in general.    If, however,     μ   (  X  )    <  ∞        μ  X      \mu(X)<\infty   or, more generally, if all the f n vanish outside some set of finite measure, then the distinction between local and global convergence in measure disappears.    If μ is σ -finite and ( f n ) converges (locally or globally) to f in measure, there is a subsequence converging to f  almost everywhere . The assumption of σ -finiteness is not necessary in the case of global convergence in measure.    If μ is σ -finite, ( f n ) converges to f locally in measure if and only if every subsequence has in turn a subsequence that converges to f almost everywhere.    In particular, if ( f n ) converges to f almost everywhere, then ( f n ) converges to f locally in measure. The converse is false.    Fatou's lemma and the monotone convergence theorem hold if almost everywhere convergence is replaced by (local or global) convergence in measure.    If μ is σ -finite, Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem also holds if almost everywhere convergence is replaced by (local or global) convergence in measure.    If X = [ a , b ] ⊆ R and μ is Lebesgue measure , there are sequences ( g n ) of step functions and ( h n ) of continuous functions converging globally in measure to f .    If f and f n ( n ∈ N ) are in L p ( μ ) for some p > 0 and ( f n ) converges to f in the p -norm, then ( f n ) converges to f globally in measure. The converse is false.    If f n converges to f in measure and g n converges to g in measure then f n + g n converges to f + g in measure. Additionally, if the measure space is finite, f n g n also converges to fg .   Counterexamples  Let    X  =  ℝ      X  ℝ    X=\mathbb{R}   , μ be Lebesgue measure, and f the constant function with value zero.   The sequence     f  n   =   χ   [  n  ,  ∞  )         subscript  f  n    subscript  χ   n       f_{n}=\chi_{[n,\infty)}   converges to f locally in measure, but does not converge to f globally in measure.    The sequence     f  n   =   χ   [   j   2  k    ,    j  +  1    2  k    ]         subscript  f  n    subscript  χ     j   superscript  2  k        j  1    superscript  2  k        f_{n}=\chi_{[\frac{j}{2^{k}},\frac{j+1}{2^{k}}]}   where    k  =   ⌊    log  2   n   ⌋       k      subscript   2   n      k=\lfloor\log_{2}n\rfloor   and    j  =   n  -   2  k        j    n   superscript  2  k      j=n-2^{k}      (The first five terms of which are     χ   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,   χ   [  0  ,   1  2   ]    ,   χ   [   1  2   ,  1  ]    ,   χ   [  0  ,   1  4   ]    ,   χ   [   1  4   ,   1  2   ]        subscript  χ   0  1     subscript  χ   0    1  2      subscript  χ     1  2   1     subscript  χ   0    1  4      subscript  χ     1  4     1  2       \chi_{\left[0,1\right]},\;\chi_{\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]},\;\chi_{\left[%
 \frac{1}{2},1\right]},\;\chi_{\left[0,\frac{1}{4}\right]},\;\chi_{\left[\frac{%
 1}{4},\frac{1}{2}\right]}   ) converges to 0 locally in measure; but for no x does f n (x) converge to zero. Hence (f n ) fails to converge to f almost everywhere.   The sequence     f  n   =   n   χ   [  0  ,   1  n   ]          subscript  f  n     n   subscript  χ   0    1  n        f_{n}=n\chi_{\left[0,\frac{1}{n}\right]}   converges to f almost everywhere (hence also locally in measure), but not in the p -norm for any    p  ≥  1      p  1    p\geq 1   .   Topology  There is a topology , called the topology of (local) convergence in measure , on the collection of measurable functions from X such that local convergence in measure corresponds to convergence on that topology. This topology is defined by the family of pseudometrics       {   ρ  F   :    F  ∈  Σ   ,    μ   (  F  )    <  ∞    }   ,     conditional-set   subscript  ρ  F    formulae-sequence    F  normal-Σ       μ  F        \{\rho_{F}:F\in\Sigma,\ \mu(F)<\infty\},   where        ρ  F    (  f  ,  g  )    =    ∫  F     min   {   |   f  -  g   |   ,  1  }    d  μ           subscript  ρ  F    f  g      subscript   F           f  g    1   d  μ      \rho_{F}(f,g)=\int_{F}\min\{|f-g|,1\}\,d\mu   . In general, one may restrict oneself to some subfamily of sets F (instead of all possible subsets of finite measure). It suffices that for each    G  ⊂  X      G  X    G\subset X   of finite measure and    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exists F in the family such that      μ   (   G  ∖  F   )    <  ε   .        μ    G  F    ε    \mu(G\setminus F)<\varepsilon.   When     μ   (  X  )    <  ∞        μ  X      \mu(X)<\infty   , we may consider only one metric    ρ  X     subscript  ρ  X    \rho_{X}   , so the topology of convergence in finite measure is metrizable. If   μ   μ   \mu   is an arbitrary measure finite or not, then      d   (  f  ,  g  )   :=   inf   δ  >  0    μ   (   {  |  f  -  g  |  ≥  δ  }   )   +  δ     fragments  d   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-,  g  normal-)   assign   subscript  infimum    δ  0    μ   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{  normal-|  f   g  normal-|   δ  normal-}   normal-)    δ    d(f,g):=\inf\limits_{\delta>0}\mu(\{|f-g|\geq\delta\})+\delta   still defines a metric that generates the global convergence in measure. 1  Because this topology is generated by a family of pseudometrics, it is uniformizable . Working with uniform structures instead of topologies allows us to formulate uniform properties such as Cauchyness .  References   D.H. Fremlin, 2000. Measure Theory . Torres Fremlin.  H.L.
