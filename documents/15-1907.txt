   Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (AMP-forming)      Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (AMP-forming)   Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (AMP-forming) (, hAps1 , NUDT11 (gene) , hAps2 , NUDT10 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name P1,P6-bis(5'-adenosyl)hexaphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (AMP-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) P1,P6-bis(5'-adenosyl)hexaphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 5'-pentaphosphate + AMP  (2) P1,P5-bis(5'-adenosyl)pentaphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate + AMP   A divalent cation is essential for activity.
