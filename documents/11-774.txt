   Pentanamidase      Pentanamidase   In enzymology , a pentanamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pentanamide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pentanoate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pentanamide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are valerate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pentanamide amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called valeramidase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
