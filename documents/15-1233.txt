   Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase      Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase   Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase (, RebM ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   4'-demethylrebeccamycin + S-adenosyl-L-methionine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    rebeccamycin + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine    Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin , an indolocarbazole  alkaloid produced by the Actinobacterium Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes.
