Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase

Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase (, RebM) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4'-demethylrebeccamycin + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

rebeccamycin + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine


Demethylrebeccamycin-D-glucose O-methyltransferase catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin, an indolocarbazole alkaloid produced by the Actinobacterium Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes.
