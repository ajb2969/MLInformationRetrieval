   4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase      4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + glyoxylate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate , and two products , pyruvate and glyoxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate glyoxylate-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include 2-oxo-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase , hydroxyketoglutaric aldolase , 4-hydroxy-2-ketoglutaric aldolase , 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutaric aldolase , 4-hydroxy-2-ketoglutarate aldolase , 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase , 2-oxo-4-hydroxyglutaric aldolase , DL-4-hydroxy-2-ketoglutarate aldolase , hydroxyketoglutarate aldolase , 2-keto-4-hydroxybutyrate aldolase , and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate glyoxylate-lyase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .  References      Boyer, P.D.
