   Adenosylmethionine cyclotransferase      Adenosylmethionine cyclotransferase   In enzymology , an adenosylmethionine cyclotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5'-methylthioadenosine + 2-aminobutan-4-olide   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , S-adenosyl-L-methionine , and two products , 5'-methylthioadenosine and 2-aminobutan-4-olide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine alkyltransferase (cyclizing) . This enzyme is also called adenosylmethioninase .
