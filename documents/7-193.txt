Teaching dimension

In computational learning theory, the teaching dimension1 of a concept class C is defined to be 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the minimum size of a witness set for c in C.
The teaching dimension of a finite concept class can be used to give a lower and an upper bound on the membership query cost of the concept class.
In Stasys Jukna's book "Extremal Combinatorics", a lower bound is given for the teaching dimension:
Let C be a concept class over a finite domain X. If the size of C is greater than


 
  then the teaching dimension of C is greater than k.
