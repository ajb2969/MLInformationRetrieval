   Teaching dimension      Teaching dimension   In computational learning theory , the teaching dimension 1 of a concept class  C is defined to be     max   c  ∈  C     {    w  C    (  c  )    }       subscript     c  C       subscript  w  C   c     \max_{c\in C}\{w_{C}(c)\}   , where     w  C    (  c  )        subscript  w  C   c    {w_{C}(c)}   is the minimum size of a witness set for c in C .  The teaching dimension of a finite concept class can be used to give a lower and an upper bound on the membership query cost of the concept class.  In Stasys Jukna 's book "Extremal Combinatorics", a lower bound is given for the teaching dimension:  Let C be a concept class over a finite domain X . If the size of C is greater than        2  k    (      |  X  |       k     )    ,       superscript  2  k    binomial    X   k     2^{k}{|X|\choose k},   then the teaching dimension of C is greater than k .
