3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring) kinase

(3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)) kinase (, BCK, BCKD kinase, BCODH kinase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase, branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase (phosphorylating), STK2) is an enzyme with system name ATP:(3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)) phosphotransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + [3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] 
 
 
 
  ADP + [3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] phosphate
 

The enzyme has no activating compound but is specific for its substrate.
