Mahler's inequality

In mathematics, Mahler's inequality, named after Kurt Mahler, states that the geometric mean of the term-by-term sum of two finite sequences of positive numbers is greater than or equal to the sum of their two separate geometric means:



when xk, yk > 0 for all k.
Proof
By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we have:



and



Hence,



Clearing denominators then gives the desired result.
