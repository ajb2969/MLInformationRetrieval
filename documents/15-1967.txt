Benzoyl-CoA-dihydrodiol lyase

Benzoyl-CoA-dihydrodiol lyase (, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA lyase/hydrolase (deformylating), BoxC, dihydrodiol transforming enzyme, benzoyl-CoA oxidation component C) is an enzyme with system name 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA 3,4-didehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde-lyase (formate-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  3,4-didehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde + formate


The enzyme is involved in the aerobic benzoyl-CoA catabolic pathway in Azoarcus evansii.
