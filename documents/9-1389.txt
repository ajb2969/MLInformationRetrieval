   Beverton–Holt model      Beverton–Holt model   The Beverton–Holt model is a classic discrete-time population model which gives the expected number n  t +1 (or density) of individuals in generation t + 1 as a function of the number of individuals in the previous generation,        n   t  +  1    =     R  0    n  t     1  +    n  t   /  M      .       subscript  n    t  1         subscript  R  0    subscript  n  t      1     subscript  n  t   M       n_{t+1}=\frac{R_{0}n_{t}}{1+n_{t}/M}.     Here R 0 is interpreted as the proliferation rate per generation and K = ( R 0 − 1) M is the carrying capacity of the environment. The Beverton–Holt model was introduced in the context of fisheries by Beverton & Holt (1957). Subsequent work has derived the model under other assumptions such as contest competition (Brännström & Sumpter 2005) or within-year resource limited competition (Geritz & Kisdi 2004). The Beverton–Holt model can be generalized to include scramble competition (see the Ricker model , the Hassell model and the Maynard Smith –Slatkin model). It is also possible to include a parameter reflecting the spatial clustering of individuals (see Brännström & Sumpter 2005).  Despite being nonlinear, the model can be solved explicitly, since it is in fact an inhomogeneous linear equation in 1/ n . The solution is        n  t   =    K   n  0      n  0   +    (   K  -   n  0    )    R  0   -  t        .       subscript  n  t       K   subscript  n  0       subscript  n  0       K   subscript  n  0     superscript   subscript  R  0     t         n_{t}=\frac{Kn_{0}}{n_{0}+(K-n_{0})R_{0}^{-t}}.     Because of this structure, the model can be considered as the discrete-time analogue of the continuous-time logistic equation for population growth introduced by Verhulst ; for comparison, the logistic equation is         d  N    d  t    =   r  N   (   1  -   N  K    )     ,          d  N     d  t      r  N    1    N  K       \frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right),     and its solution is        N   (  t  )    =    K  N   (  0  )      N   (  0  )    +    (   K  -   N   (  0  )     )    e   -   r  t         .        N  t       K  N  0       N  0       K    N  0     superscript  e      r  t          N(t)=\frac{KN(0)}{N(0)+(K-N(0))e^{-rt}}.
