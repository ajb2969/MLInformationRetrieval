   Tree spanner      Tree spanner   A tree k -spanner (or simply k -spanner ) of a graph G is a spanning subtree T of G in which the distance between every pair of vertices is at most k times their distance in G.  Known Results  There are several papers written on the subject of tree spanners. One of these was entitled Tree Spanners 1 written by mathematicians Leizhen Cai and Derek Corneil , which explored theoretical and algorithmic problems associated with tree spanners. Some of the conclusions from that paper are listed below:  (1) A tree 1-spanner, if it exists, is a minimum spanning tree and can be found in O(m log β (m,n))time (in terms of complexity) for a weighted graph, where β (m,n) = min{i| log^{t} n \leq m/n}.  (2) A tree 2-spanner can be constructed in linear time, and the tree t-spanner problem is NP-complete for any fixed integer    t  >  3      t  3    t>3   .  (3)The complexity for finding a minimum tree spanner in a digraph is O((m+n)α(m+n,n)) , where α(m+n,n) is a functional inverse of the Ackermann function , m is the number of vertices of the graph, and n is its number of edges.  (4) The minimum 1-spanner of a weighted graph can be found in    O   (    m  ×  n   +     n  2   ×  l   o  g   (  n  )     )       O      m  n        superscript  n  2   l   o  g  n      O(m\times n+n^{2}\times log(n))   time.  (5) For any fixed rational number    t  >  1      t  1    t>1   , it is NP-complete to determine whether a weighted graph contains a tree t-spanner, even if all edge weights are positive integers.  (6) A tree spanner (or a minimum tree spanner) of a digraph can be found in linear time.  (7) A digraph contains at most one tree spanner.  (8) The quasi-tree spanner of a weighted digraph can be found in O(m \times log β(m,n)) time.  (9) The tree 1-spanner of a weighted graph G is a minimum spanning tree. Furthermore, every tree 1-spanner admissible weighted graph contains a unique minimum spanning tree.  (10) A tree 2-spanner (if it exists) of a graph can be found in    O   (   m  +  n   )       O    m  n     O(m+n)   time.  References    .
