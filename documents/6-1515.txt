   Joseph Ludwig Raabe      Joseph Ludwig Raabe    Joseph Ludwig Raabe (15 May 1801 in Brody , Galicia – 22 January 1859 in Zürich , Switzerland) was a Swiss mathematician . 1  Life  As his parents were quite poor, Raabe was forced to earn his living from a very early age by giving private lessons. He began to study mathematics in 1820 at the Polytechnicum in Vienna , Austria. In autumn 1831, he moved to Zürich, where he became professor of mathematics in 1833. In 1855, he became professor at the newly founded Swiss Polytechnicum. 2  He is best known for Raabe's ratio test , an extension of d'Alembert's ratio test , which serves to determine the convergence or divergence of an infinite series . 3 He is also known for the Raabe integral of the gamma function 4         ∫  a   a  +  1      log  Γ    (  t  )   d  t    =       1  2     log   2  π     +   a   log  a     -  a    ,   a  ≥  0.      formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript   a     a  1        normal-Γ   t  normal-d  t            1  2       2  π       a    a     a      a  0.     \int\limits_{a}^{a+1}\log\Gamma(t)\,\mathrm{d}t=\tfrac{1}{2}\log 2\pi+a\log a-%
