   Robinson's joint consistency theorem      Robinson's joint consistency theorem   Robinson's joint consistency theorem is an important theorem of mathematical logic . It is related to Craig interpolation and Beth definability .  The classical formulation of Robinson's joint consistency theorem is as follows:  Let    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   be first-order theories. If    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   are consistent and the intersection     T  1   ∩   T  2        subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2     T_{1}\cap T_{2}   is complete (in the common language of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   ), then the union     T  1   ∪   T  2        subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2     T_{1}\cup T_{2}   is consistent. Note that a theory is complete if it decides every formula, i.e. either    T  ⊢  φ     proves  T  φ    T\vdash\varphi   or    T  ⊢   ¬  φ      proves  T     φ     T\vdash\neg\varphi   .  Since the completeness assumption is quite hard to fulfill, there is a variant of the theorem:  Let    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   be first-order theories. If    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   are consistent and if there is no formula   φ   φ   \varphi   in the common language of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   such that     T  1   ⊢  φ     proves   subscript  T  1   φ    T_{1}\vdash\varphi   and     T  2   ⊢   ¬  φ      proves   subscript  T  2      φ     T_{2}\vdash\neg\varphi   , then the union     T  1   ∪   T  2        subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2     T_{1}\cup T_{2}   is consistent.
