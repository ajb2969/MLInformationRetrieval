Robinson's joint consistency theorem

Robinson's joint consistency theorem is an important theorem of mathematical logic. It is related to Craig interpolation and Beth definability.
The classical formulation of Robinson's joint consistency theorem is as follows:
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be first-order theories. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are consistent and the intersection 
 
 
 
  is  complete (in the common language of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ), then the union 
 
 
 
  is consistent. Note that a theory is complete if it decides every formula, i.e. either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
Since the completeness assumption is quite hard to fulfill, there is a variant of the theorem:
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be first-order theories. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are consistent and if there is no formula 
 
 
 
  in the common language of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the union 
 
 
 
  is consistent.
