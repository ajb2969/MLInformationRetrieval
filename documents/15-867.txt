   Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)   Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP + ) (, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , succinyl semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , succinate semialdehyde:NADP + oxidoreductase , NADP-dependent succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase , GabD ) is an enzyme with system name succinate-semialdehyde:NADP + oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   succinate semialdehyde + NADP + + H2O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + NADPH + 2 H +    This enzyme participates in the degradation of glutamate and 4- aminobutyrate .
