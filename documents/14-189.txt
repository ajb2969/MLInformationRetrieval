   Tower of fields      Tower of fields   In mathematics , a tower of fields is a sequence of field extensions      The name comes from such sequences often being written in the form        ⋮      |       F  2       |       F  1       |        F  0   .         normal-⋮    normal-|     subscript  F  2     normal-|     subscript  F  1     normal-|     subscript  F  0      \begin{array}[]{c}\vdots\\
 |\\
 F_{2}\\

 F_{1}\\

 F_{0}.\end{array}   A tower of fields may be finite or infinite .  Examples    is a finite tower with rational, real and complex numbers.  The sequence obtained by letting F 0 be the rational numbers  Q , and letting          F   n  +  1    =    F  n    (   2   1  /   2  n     )         subscript  F    n  1       subscript  F  n    superscript  2    1   superscript  2  n        F_{n+1}=F_{n}\left(2^{1/2^{n}}\right)       (i.e. F n +1 is obtained from F n by adjoining a 2 n th root of 2) is an infinite tower.    If p is a prime number the p th cyclotomic tower of Q is obtained by letting F 0 = Q and F n be the field obtained by adjoining to Q the p n th roots of unity . This tower is of fundamental importance in Iwasawa theory .  The Golod–Shafarevich theorem shows that there are infinite towers obtained by iterating the Hilbert class field construction to a number field .
