Touchard polynomials

 
The Touchard polynomials, studied by , also called the exponential polynomials123 or Bell polynomials,4 comprise a polynomial sequence of binomial type defined by



where 
 
 
 
  is a Stirling number of the second kind, i.e., the number of partitions of a set of size n into k disjoint non-empty subsets.
Properties
The value at 1 of the nth Touchard polynomial is the nth Bell number, i.e., the number of partitions of a set of size n:



If X is a random variable with a Poisson distribution with expected value λ, then its nth moment is E(Xn) = Tn(λ), leading to the definition:



Using this fact one can quickly prove that this polynomial sequence is of binomial type, i.e., it satisfies the sequence of identities:



The Touchard polynomials constitute the only polynomial sequence of binomial type with the coefficient of x equal 1 in every polynomial.
The Touchard polynomials satisfy the Rodrigues-like formula:



The Touchard polynomials satisfy the recurrence relation



and



In the case x = 1, this reduces to the recurrence formula for the Bell numbers.
Using the umbral notation Tn(x)=Tn(x), these formulas become:






The generating function of the Touchard polynomials is



which corresponds to the generating function of Stirling numbers of the second kind.
Touchard polynomials have contour integral representation:



Generalizations

Complete Bell polynomial

 
  may be viewed as a multivariate generalization of Touchard polynomial 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 



The Touchard polynomials (and thereby the Bell numbers) can be generalized, using the real part of the above integral, to non-integer order:
