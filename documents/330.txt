   Alexander–Spanier cohomology      Alexander–Spanier cohomology   In mathematics , particularly in algebraic topology , Alexander–Spanier cohomology is a cohomology theory for topological spaces .  History  It was introduced by  for the special case of compact metric spaces , and by  for all topological spaces, based on a suggestion of A. D. Wallace.  Definition  If X is a topological space and G is an abelian group, then there is a complex C whose p th term C p is the set of all functions from X p +1 to G with differential d given by        d  f   (   x  0   ,  …  ,   x  p   )    =    ∑  i      (   -  1   )   i   f   (   x  0   ,  …  ,   x   i  -  1    ,   x   i  +  1    ,  …  ,   x  p   )      .        d  f    subscript  x  0   normal-…   subscript  x  p       subscript   i      superscript    1   i   f    subscript  x  0   normal-…   subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x    i  1    normal-…   subscript  x  p        df(x_{0},\ldots,x_{p})=\sum_{i}(-1)^{i}f(x_{0},\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x%
 _{p}).     It has a subcomplex C 0 of functions that vanish in a neighborhood of the diagonal. The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups H p ( X , G ) are defined to be the cohomology groups of the complex C / C 0 .  Variants  It is also possible to define Alexander–Spanier homology  and Alexander–Spanier cohomology with compact supports .  Connection to other cohomologies  The Alexander–Spanier cohomology groups coincide with Čech cohomology groups for compact Hausdorff spaces , and coincide with singular cohomology groups for locally finite complexes.
