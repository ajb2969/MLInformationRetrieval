   Insertion loss      Insertion loss   In telecommunications , insertion loss is the loss of signal  power resulting from the insertion of a device in a transmission line or optical fiber and is usually expressed in decibels (dB).  If the power transmitted to the load before insertion is P T and the power received by the load after insertion is P R , then the insertion loss in dB is given by,      10    log  10     P  T    P  R         10    subscript   10      subscript  P  normal-T    subscript  P  normal-R       10\log_{10}{P_{\mathrm{T}}\over P_{\mathrm{R}}}     Electronic filters  Insertion loss is a figure of merit for an electronic filter and this data is generally specified with a filter. Insertion loss is defined as a ratio of the signal level in a test configuration without the filter installed (| V 1 |) to the signal level with the filter installed (| V 2 |). This ratio is described in dB by the following equation:      Insertion loss (dB)  =   10    log  10      |   V  1   |   2     |   V  2   |   2      =   20    log  10     |   V  1   |    |   V  2   |            Insertion loss (dB)    10    subscript   10      superscript     subscript  V  1    2    superscript     subscript  V  2    2             20    subscript   10        subscript  V  1       subscript  V  2          \mbox{Insertion loss (dB)}=10\log_{10}{\left|V_{1}\right|^{2}\over\left|V_{2}%
 \right|^{2}}=20\log_{10}{\left|V_{1}\right|\over\left|V_{2}\right|}     Note that, for most filters, | V 2 | will be smaller than | V 1 |. In this case, the insertion loss is positive and measures how much smaller the signal is after adding the filter.  Link with Scattering parameters  In case the two measurement ports use the same reference impedance, the insertion loss (    I  L      I  L    IL   ) is defined as: 1 2       I  L   =   -   20    log  10     |   S  21   |   dB            I  L       20    subscript   10        subscript  S  21    dB        IL=-20\log_{10}\left|S_{21}\right|\,\text{dB}     and not, as often mistakenly thought, by:       I  L   =   10    log  10       |   S  21   |   2    1  -    |   S  11   |   2              I  L     10    subscript   10      superscript     subscript  S  21    2     1   superscript     subscript  S  11    2         IL=10\log_{10}\frac{\left|S_{21}\right|^{2}}{1-\left|S_{11}\right|^{2}}\,   dB.  Here    S  11     subscript  S  11    S_{11}   and    S  21     subscript  S  21    S_{21}   are two of the scattering parameters . It is the extra loss produced by the introduction of the DUT between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. The extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive.
