   Chain sequence      Chain sequence   In the analytic theory of continued fractions , a chain sequence is an infinite sequence { a n } of non-negative real numbers chained together with another sequence { g n } of non-negative real numbers by the equations        a  1   =    (   1  -   g  0    )    g  1        a  2   =    (   1  -   g  1    )    g  2       a  n   =    (   1  -   g   n  -  1     )    g  n         formulae-sequence     subscript  a  1       1   subscript  g  0     subscript  g  1      formulae-sequence     subscript  a  2       1   subscript  g  1     subscript  g  2        subscript  a  n       1   subscript  g    n  1      subscript  g  n        a_{1}=(1-g_{0})g_{1}\quad a_{2}=(1-g_{1})g_{2}\quad a_{n}=(1-g_{n-1})g_{n}     where either (a) 0 ≤ g n  n ≤ 1. Chain sequences arise in the study of the convergence problem – both in connection with the parabola theorem , and also as part of the theory of positive definite continued fractions.  The infinite continued fraction of Worpitzky's theorem contains a chain sequence. A closely related theorem 1 shows that       f   (  z  )    =      a  1   z    1  +      a  2   z    1  +      a  3   z    1  +      a  4   z   ⋱                   f  z    continued-fraction     subscript  a  1   z     1   continued-fraction     subscript  a  2   z     1   continued-fraction     subscript  a  3   z     1   continued-fraction     subscript  a  4   z   normal-⋱           f(z)=\cfrac{a_{1}z}{1+\cfrac{a_{2}z}{1+\cfrac{a_{3}z}{1+\cfrac{a_{4}z}{\ddots}%
 }}}\,     converges uniformly on the closed unit disk | z | ≤ 1 if the coefficients { a n } are a chain sequence.  An example  The sequence {¼, ¼, ¼, ...} appears as a limiting case in the statement of Worpitzky's theorem. Since this sequence is generated by setting g 0 = g 1 = g 2 = ...  = ½, it is clearly a chain sequence. This sequence has two important properties.   Since f ( x ) = x − x 2 is a maximum when x = ½, this example is the "biggest" chain sequence that can be generated with a single generating element; or, more precisely, if { g n } = { x }, and x  n } will be an endless repetition of a real number y that is less than ¼.    The choice g n = ½ is not the only set of generators for this particular chain sequence. Notice that setting          g_0 = 0 \quad g_1 = {\textstyle\frac{1}{4}} \quad g_2 = {\textstyle\frac{1}{3}} \quad g_3 = {\textstyle\frac{3}{8}} \;\dots   generates the same unending sequence {¼, ¼, ¼, ...}.
