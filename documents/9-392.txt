Chain sequence




Chain sequence

In the analytic theory of continued fractions, a chain sequence is an infinite sequence {an} of non-negative real numbers chained together with another sequence {gn} of non-negative real numbers by the equations



where either (a) 0 ≤ gn n ≤ 1. Chain sequences arise in the study of the convergence problem – both in connection with the parabola theorem, and also as part of the theory of positive definite continued fractions.
The infinite continued fraction of Worpitzky's theorem contains a chain sequence. A closely related theorem1 shows that



converges uniformly on the closed unit disk |z| ≤ 1 if the coefficients {an} are a chain sequence.
An example
The sequence {¼, ¼, ¼, ...} appears as a limiting case in the statement of Worpitzky's theorem. Since this sequence is generated by setting g0 = g1 = g2 = ...  = ½, it is clearly a chain sequence. This sequence has two important properties.

Since f(x) = x − x2 is a maximum when x = ½, this example is the "biggest" chain sequence that can be generated with a single generating element; or, more precisely, if {gn} = {x}, and x n} will be an endless repetition of a real number y that is less than ¼.


The choice gn = ½ is not the only set of generators for this particular chain sequence. Notice that setting







g_0 = 0 \quad g_1 = {\textstyle\frac{1}{4}} \quad g_2 = {\textstyle\frac{1}{3}} \quad g_3 = {\textstyle\frac{3}{8}} \;\dots 

generates the same unending sequence {¼, ¼, ¼, ...}.
