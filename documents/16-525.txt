Droplet-shaped wave

In physics, Droplet-shaped waves are casual localized solutions of the wave equation closely related to the X-shaped waves, but, in contrast, possessing a finite support.
A family of the droplet-shaped waves was obtained by extension of the "toy model" of X-wave generation by a superluminal point electric charge (tachyon) at infinite rectilinear motion E. Recami, M. Zamboni-Rached and C. Dartora,

 to the case of a line source pulse started at time $t = 0$. The pulse front is supposed to propagate with a constant superluminal velocity $v = βc$ (here $c$ is the speed of light, so $β > 1$).
In the cylindrical spacetime coordinate system $τ = ct, ρ, φ, z$, originated in the point of pulse generation and oriented along the (given) line of source propagation (direction z), the general expression for such a source pulse takes the form
$$s(\tau ,\rho ,z) = 
 \frac{\delta (\rho )} {2\pi \rho}
 J(\tau ,z) H(\beta \tau -z) H(z),$$
where $δ (•)$ and $H (•)$ are, correspondingly, the Dirac delta and Heaviside step functions while $J ( τ , z )$ is an arbitrary continuous function representing the pulse shape. Notably, $H ( βτ - z ) H ( z ) = 0$ for $τ , so $s ( τ , ρ , z ) = 0$ for $τ  as well.
As far as the wave source does not exist prior to the moment $τ = 0$, a one-time application of the causality principle implies zero wavefunction $ψ ( τ , ρ , z )$ for negative values of time.
As a consequence, $ψ$ is uniquely defined by the problem for the wave equation with the time-asymmetric homogeneous initial condition
$$\begin{align}
 & \left[
 {\partial _\tau ^2 - {\rho ^{-1}}{\partial _\rho }\left( {\rho {\partial _\rho }} \right) - \partial _z^2} 
 \right]
 \psi \left( \tau, \rho ,z \right) 
 = 
 s \left( \tau, \rho ,z \right)\\
 & \psi \left( \tau, \rho ,z \right) = 0 \quad \mathrm{for}  \quad \tau < 0
 \end{align}$$
The general integral solution for the resulting waves and the analytical description of their finite, droplet-shaped support can be obtained from the above problem using the STTD technique.123
