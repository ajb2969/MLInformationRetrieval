Alcohol by volume

 
Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as ABV, abv, or alc/vol) is a standard measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a volume percent).123 It is defined as the number of millilitres of pure ethanol present in 100 millilitres of solution at 20 °C.4 The number of millilitres of pure ethanol is the mass of the ethanol divided by its density at 20 °C, which is 0.78924 g/ml. The ABV standard is used worldwide.
In some countries, alcohol by volume is referred to as degrees Gay-Lussac (after the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac),5 although there is a slight difference since Gay-Lussac used 15 °C.
Mixing two solutions of alcohol of different strengths usually causes a change in volume. Mixing pure water with a solution less than 24% by mass causes a slight increase in total volume, whereas the mixing of two solutions above 24% causes a decrease in volume.6 More information on the phenomenon of volume changes due to mixing dissimilar solutions is discussed in the article on partial molar volume.
Typical levels
Details about typical amounts of alcohol contained in various beverages can be found in the articles about them.

Alcohol proof
Another way of specifying the amount of alcohol is alcohol proof, which in the United States is twice the alcohol-by-volume number, while in the United Kingdom it is 1.75 times the number (expressed as a percentage).910 For example, 40% abv is 80 proof in the US and 70 proof in the UK. However, since 1980, alcoholic proof in the UK has been replaced by abv as a measure of alcohol content.
Alcohol by volume and alcohol by weight
In the United States, a few states regulate and tax alcoholic beverages according to alcohol by weight (ABW), expressed as a percentage of total mass. Some brewers print the ABW (rather than the ABV) on beer containers, particularly on low-point versions of popular domestic beer brands.
One can use the following equation to convert between ABV and ABW:



At relatively low ABV, the alcohol percentage by weight is about 4/5 of the ABV (e.g., 3.2% ABW is about 4% ABV).11 However, because of the miscibility of alcohol and water, the conversion factor is not constant but rather depends upon the concentration of alcohol. 100% ABW, of course, is equivalent to 100% ABV.
Calculation of alcohol content
During the production of wine and beer, yeast is added to a sugary solution. During fermentation, the yeast organisms consume the sugars and produce alcohol. The density of sugar in water is greater than the density of alcohol in water. A hydrometer is used to measure the change in specific gravity (SG) of the solution before and after fermentation. The volume of alcohol in the solution can then be calculated.
Wine
The simplest method for wine has been described by English author C.J.J. Berry:12

Beer

The calculation for beer is:13{{}}
1.05 is the number of grams of CO2 produced for every gram of ethanol produced, and .79 is the density of ethanol,

However, many brewers use the following formula:15
