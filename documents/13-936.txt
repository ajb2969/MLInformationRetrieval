Icositetragon

In geometry, an icositetragon (or icosikaitetragon or tetracosagon) is a twenty-four-sided polygon. The sum of any icositetragon's interior angles is 3960 degrees.
The regular icositetragon is represented by Schläfli symbol {24} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated icosagon, t{12}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular icositetragon
One interior angle in a regular icositetragon is 165°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 15°.
The area of a regular icositetragon is: (with t = edge length)



The icositetragon appeared in Archimedes' polygon approximation of pi, along with the hexagon (6-gon), dodecagon (12-gon), 48-gon, and 96-gon.
Construction
A regular icositetragon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.1 As a truncated dodecagon, it can be constructed by an edge-bisection of a regular dodecagon.
Related polygons

 A regular triangle, octagon, and icositetragon can completely fill a plane vertex.
An icositetragram is a 24-sided star polygon. There are 3 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols: {24/5}, {24/7}, and {24/11}. There are also 7 regular star figures using the same vertex arrangement: 2{12}, 3{8}, 4{6}, 6{4}, 8{3}, 3{8/3}, and 2{12/5}.

There are also isogonal icositetragrams constructed as deeper truncations of the regular dodecagon {12} and dodecagram {12/5}. These also generate two quasitruncations: t{12/11}={24/11}, and t{12/7}={24/7}. 2
