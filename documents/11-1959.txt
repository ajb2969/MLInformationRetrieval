   Nonlinear eigenproblem      Nonlinear eigenproblem   A nonlinear eigenproblem is a generalization of an ordinary eigenproblem to equations that depend nonlinearly on the eigenvalue. Specifically, it refers to equations of the form:        A   (  λ  )   𝐱   =  0   ,        A  λ  𝐱   0    A(\lambda)\mathbf{x}=0,\,     where x is a vector (the nonlinear "eigenvector") and A is a matrix -valued function of the number   λ   λ   \lambda   (the nonlinear "eigenvalue"). (More generally,    A   (  λ  )       A  λ    A(\lambda)   could be a linear map , but most commonly it is a finite-dimensional, usually square, matrix.) A is usually required to be a holomorphic function of   λ   λ   \lambda   (in some domain ).  For example, an ordinary linear eigenproblem     B  𝐯   =   λ  𝐯         B  𝐯     λ  𝐯     B\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}   , where B is a square matrix, corresponds to     A   (  λ  )    =   B  -   λ  I          A  λ     B    λ  I      A(\lambda)=B-\lambda I   , where I is the identity matrix .  One common case is where A is a polynomial matrix , which is called a polynomial eigenvalue problem . In particular, the specific case where the polynomial has degree two is called a quadratic eigenvalue problem , and can be written in the form:        A   (  λ  )   𝐱   =    (     A  2    λ  2    +    A  1   λ   +   A  0    )   𝐱   =  0   ,          A  λ  𝐱          subscript  A  2    superscript  λ  2       subscript  A  1   λ    subscript  A  0    𝐱        0     A(\lambda)\mathbf{x}=(A_{2}\lambda^{2}+A_{1}\lambda+A_{0})\mathbf{x}=0,\,     in terms of the constant square matrices A 0,1,2 . This can be converted into an ordinary linear generalized eigenproblem of twice the size by defining a new vector    𝐲  =   λ  𝐱       𝐲    λ  𝐱     \mathbf{y}=\lambda\mathbf{x}   . In terms of x and y , the quadratic eigenvalue problem becomes:         (      -   A  0      0      0    I     )    (     𝐱      𝐲     )    =   λ   (      A  1      A  2       I    0     )    (     𝐱      𝐲     )     ,             subscript  A  0    0    0  I      𝐱    𝐲       λ     subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2     I  0      𝐱    𝐲       \begin{pmatrix}-A_{0}&0\\
 0&I\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{x}\\
 \mathbf{y}\end{pmatrix}=\lambda\begin{pmatrix}A_{1}&A_{2}\\
 I&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{x}\\
 \mathbf{y}\end{pmatrix},     where I is the identity matrix. More generally, if A is a matrix polynomial of degree d , then one can convert the nonlinear eigenproblem into a linear (generalized) eigenproblem of d times the size.  Besides converting them to ordinary eigenproblems, which only works if A is polynomial, there are other methods of solving nonlinear eigenproblems based on the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm or based on Newton's method (related to inverse iteration ).
