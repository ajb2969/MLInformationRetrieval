   Ricker model      Ricker model   The Ricker model , named after Bill Ricker , is a classic discrete population model which gives the expected number a  t +1 (or density) of individuals in generation t + 1 as a function of the number of individuals in the previous generation, 1        a   t  +  1    =    a  t    e   r   (   1  -    a  t   k    )       .       subscript  a    t  1       subscript  a  t    superscript  e    r    1     subscript  a  t   k         a_{t+1}=a_{t}e^{r\left(1-\frac{a_{t}}{k}\right)}.\,     Here r is interpreted as an intrinsic growth rate and k as the carrying capacity of the environment. The Ricker model was introduced in 1954 by Ricker in the context of stock and recruitment in fisheries .  The model can be used to predict the number of fish that will be present in a fishery. 2 3 Subsequent work has derived the model under other assumptions such as scramble competition 4 or within-year resource limited competition. 5 The Ricker model is a limiting case of the Hassell model 6 which takes the form        a   t  +  1    =    k  1     a  t     (   1  +    k  2    a  t     )   c      .       subscript  a    t  1       subscript  k  1      subscript  a  t    superscript    1     subscript  k  2    subscript  a  t     c       a_{t+1}=k_{1}\frac{a_{t}}{\left(1+k_{2}a_{t}\right)^{c}}.     When c = 1, the Hassell model is simply the Beverton–Holt model .
