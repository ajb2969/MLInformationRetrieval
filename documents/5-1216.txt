   Rate equation      Rate equation   The rate law or rate equation for a chemical reaction is an equation that links the reaction rate with concentrations or pressures of reactants and constant parameters (normally rate coefficients and partial reaction orders ). 1 For many reactions the rate is given by a power law such as       r   =   k    [  A  ]   x     [  B  ]   y        r    k   superscript   delimited-[]  normal-A   x    superscript   delimited-[]  normal-B   y      r\;=\;k[\mathrm{A}]^{x}[\mathrm{B}]^{y}   where [A] and [B] express the concentration of the species A and B, respectively (usually in moles per liter ( molarity , M)). The exponents x and y are the partial reaction orders and must be determined experimentally; they are often not equal to the stoichiometric coefficients . The constant k is the rate coefficient or rate constant of the reaction. The value of this coefficient k may depend on conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, surface area of an adsorbent or light irradiation.  For elementary reactions , which consist of a single step, the order equals the molecularity as predicted by collision theory . For example, a bimolecular elementary reaction A + B → products will be second order overall and first order in each reactant, with rate equation     r   =   k   [  A  ]    [  B  ]        r    k   delimited-[]  normal-A    delimited-[]  normal-B      r\;=\;k[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]   . For multistep reactions, the order of each step equals the molecularity, but this is not generally true for the overall rate.  The rate equation of a reaction with an assumed multi-step mechanism can often be derived theoretically using quasi-steady state assumptions from the underlying elementary reactions, and compared with the experimental rate equation as a test of the assumed mechanism. The equation may involve a fractional order , and may depend on the concentration of an intermediate species.  The rate equation is a differential equation , and it can be integrated to obtain an integrated rate equation that links concentrations of reactants or products with time.  Zero order reactions  A Zero order reaction has a rate that is independent of the concentration of the reactant(s). Increasing the concentration of the reacting species will not speed up the rate of the reaction i.e. the amount of substance reacted is proportional to the time. Zero order reactions are typically found when a material that is required for the reaction to proceed, such as a surface or a catalyst , is saturated by the reactants. The rate law for a zero order reaction is       r   =  k      r  k    \ r=k     where r is the reaction rate and k is the reaction rate coefficient with units of concentration or time. If, and only if, this zeroth order reaction 1) occurs in a closed system, 2) there is no net build-up of intermediates, and 3) there are no other reactions occurring, it can be shown by solving a mass balance equation for the system that:      r  =   -    d   [  A  ]     d  t     =  k        r        d   delimited-[]  A      d  t          k     r=-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=k     If this differential equation is integrated it gives an equation often called the integrated zero order rate law .        [  A  ]   t   =    -   k  t    +    [  A  ]   0         subscript   delimited-[]  A   t         k  t     subscript   delimited-[]  A   0      \ [A]_{t}=-kt+[A]_{0}     where     [  A  ]   t     subscript   delimited-[]  A   t    \ [A]_{t}   represents the concentration of the chemical of interest at a particular time, and     [  A  ]   0     subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    \ [A]_{0}   represents the initial concentration.  A reaction is zero order if concentration data are plotted versus time and the result is a straight line. A plot of     [  A  ]   t     subscript   delimited-[]  A   t    \ [A]_{t}   vs. time t gives a straight line with a slope of    -  k      k    -k   .  The half-life of a reaction describes the time needed for half of the reactant to be depleted (same as the half-life involved in nuclear decay , which is a first order reaction). For a zero order reaction the half-life is given by        t    1  2    =     [  A  ]   0    2  k         subscript  t    1  2       subscript   delimited-[]  A   0     2  k      \ t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{[A]_{0}}{2k}      Example of a zero order reaction    Reversed Haber process      2  N   H  3    (  g  )    →    3   H  2    (  g  )    +    N  2    (  g  )        normal-→    2  N   subscript  H  3   g       3   subscript  H  2   g      subscript  N  2   g      2NH_{3}(g)\rightarrow\;3H_{2}(g)+N_{2}(g)      The order of a reaction cannot be deduced from the chemical equation of the reaction.  First order reactions  A first order reaction depends on the concentration of only one reactant (a unimolecular reaction ). Other reactants can be present, but each will be zero order. The rate law for a reaction that is first order with respect to a reactant A is        -   d   [  A  ]      d  t    ≡  r  =   k   [  A  ]                d   delimited-[]  A       d  t    r         k   delimited-[]  A       \frac{-d[A]}{dt}\equiv r=k[A]     k is the first order rate constant, which has units of 1/s.  The integrated first order rate law is       ln    [  A  ]   =  -  k  t  +  ln    [  A  ]   0      fragments    fragments  normal-[  A  normal-]     k  t     subscript   fragments  normal-[  A  normal-]   0     \ \ln{[A]}=-kt+\ln{[A]_{0}}     A plot of    ln   [  A  ]       A    \ln{[A]}   vs. time t gives a straight line with a slope of    -  k      k    -k   .  The half-life of a first order reaction is independent of the starting concentration and is given by      t    1  2    =    ln   (  2  )    k        subscript  t    1  2        2   k     \ t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{\ln{(2)}}{k}   .  Examples of reactions that are first order with respect to the reactant:         H  2    O  2    (  l  )    →     H  2   O   (  l  )    +    1  2    O  2    (  g  )        normal-→     subscript  H  2    subscript  O  2   l        subscript  H  2   O  l       1  2    subscript  O  2   g      \mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}_{2}(l)\rightarrow\;\mbox{H}_{2}\mbox{O}(l)+\frac{1}{2}%

At the end of each time period, the fraction of the reactant population remaining relative to the amount present at the start of the time period,    f   R  P      subscript  f    R  P     f_{RP}   , will be:        A  n    A   n  -  1     =   f   R  P    =   e   -   k  Δ   t  p               subscript  A  n    subscript  A    n  1      subscript  f    R  P          superscript  e      k  normal-Δ   subscript  t  p         \frac{A_{n}}{A_{n-1}}=f_{RP}=e^{-k\Delta t_{p}}   Such that after   n   n   n   time periods, the fraction of the original reactant population will be:       A   A  0    ≡    A  n    A  0    =    (   e   -   k  Δ   t  p      )   n   =    (   f   R  P    )   n   =    (   1  -   f   B  P     )   n           A   subscript  A  0       subscript  A  n    subscript  A  0          superscript   superscript  e      k  normal-Δ   subscript  t  p      n         superscript   subscript  f    R  P    n         superscript    1   subscript  f    B  P     n      \frac{A}{A_{0}}\equiv\frac{A_{n}}{A_{0}}=\left(e^{-k\Delta t_{p}}\right)^{n}=%
 \left(f_{RP}\right)^{n}=\left(1-f_{BP}\right)^{n}   where    f   B  P      subscript  f    B  P     f_{BP}   corresponds to the fraction of the reactant population that will break down in each time period. This equation indicates that the fraction of the total amount of reactant population that will break down in each time period is independent of the initial amount present. When the chosen time period corresponds to     Δ   t  p    =    ln   (  2  )    k         normal-Δ   subscript  t  p        2   k     \Delta t_{p}=\frac{\ln\left(2\right)}{k}   , the fraction of the population that will break down in each time period will be exactly ½ the amount present at the start of the time period (i.e. the time period corresponds to the half-life of the first order reaction).  The average rate of the reaction for the n th time period is given by:       r    a  v  g   ,  n    =   -    Δ  A    Δ   t  p      =     A   n  -  1    -   A  n     Δ   t  p            subscript  r     a  v  g   n          normal-Δ  A     normal-Δ   subscript  t  p                subscript  A    n  1     subscript  A  n      normal-Δ   subscript  t  p        r_{avg,n}=-\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t_{p}}=\frac{A_{n-1}-A_{n}}{\Delta t_{p}}   Therefore, the amount remaining at the end of each time period will be related to the average rate of that time period and the reactant population at the start of the time period by:       A  n   =    A   n  -  1    -    r    a  v  g   ,  n    Δ   t  p          subscript  A  n      subscript  A    n  1       subscript  r     a  v  g   n    normal-Δ   subscript  t  p       A_{n}=A_{n-1}-r_{avg,n}\Delta t_{p}   Since the fraction of the reactant population that will break down in each time period can be expressed as:       f   B  P    =   1  -    A  n    A   n  -  1           subscript  f    B  P      1     subscript  A  n    subscript  A    n  1        f_{BP}=1-\frac{A_{n}}{A_{n-1}}   The amount of reactant that will break down in each time period can be related to the average rate over that time period by:       f   B  P    =     r    a  v  g   ,  n    Δ   t  p     A   n  -  1          subscript  f    B  P         subscript  r     a  v  g   n    normal-Δ   subscript  t  p     subscript  A    n  1       f_{BP}=\frac{r_{avg,n}\Delta t_{p}}{A_{n-1}}   Such that the amount that remains at the end of each time period will be related to the amount present at the start of the time period according to:       A  n   =    A   n  -  1     (   1  -     r    a  v  g   ,  n    Δ   t  p     A   n  -  1      )         subscript  A  n      subscript  A    n  1      1       subscript  r     a  v  g   n    normal-Δ   subscript  t  p     subscript  A    n  1         A_{n}=A_{n-1}\left(1-\frac{r_{avg,n}\Delta t_{p}}{A_{n-1}}\right)   This equation is a recursion allowing for the calculation of the amount present after any number of time periods, without need of the rate constant, provided that the average rate for each time period is known. 2  Second order reactions  A second order reaction depends on the concentrations of one second order reactant, or two first order reactants.  For a second order reaction, its reaction rate is given by:       -    d   [  A  ]     d  t     =   k    [  A  ]   2              d   delimited-[]  A      d  t       k   superscript   delimited-[]  A   2      \ -\frac{d[A]}{dt}=k[A]^{2}   or       -    d   [  A  ]     d  t     =   k   [  A  ]    [  B  ]              d   delimited-[]  A      d  t       k   delimited-[]  A    delimited-[]  B      \ -\frac{d[A]}{dt}=k[A][B]   or       -    d   [  A  ]     d  t     =   2  k    [  A  ]   2              d   delimited-[]  A      d  t       2  k   superscript   delimited-[]  A   2      \ -\frac{d[A]}{dt}=2k[A]^{2}     The integrated second order rate laws are respectively       1   [  A  ]    =    1    [  A  ]   0    +   k  t          1   delimited-[]  A        1   subscript   delimited-[]  A   0      k  t      \frac{1}{[A]}=\frac{1}{[A]_{0}}+kt     or        [  A  ]    [  B  ]    =      [  A  ]   0     [  B  ]   0     e    (     [  A  ]   0   -    [  B  ]   0    )   k  t            delimited-[]  A    delimited-[]  B         subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    subscript   delimited-[]  B   0     superscript  e       subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    subscript   delimited-[]  B   0    k  t       \frac{[A]}{[B]}=\frac{[A]_{0}}{[B]_{0}}e^{([A]_{0}-[B]_{0})kt}     [A] 0 and [B] 0 must be different to obtain that integrated equation.  The half-life equation for a second order reaction dependent on one second order reactant is      t    1  2    =   1   k    [  A  ]   0          subscript  t    1  2      1    k   subscript   delimited-[]  A   0       \ t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{k[A]_{0}}   . For such a reaction, the half-life progressively doubles as the concentration of the reactant falls to half its initial value.  Another way to present the above rate laws is to take the log of both sides:     ln  r   =    ln  k   +   2   ln   [  A  ]            r       k     2    A       \ln{}r=\ln{}k+2\ln\left[A\right]      Examples of a Second order reaction:         2   NO  2    (  g  )    →    2  NO   (  g  )    +    O  2    (  g  )        normal-→    2   subscript  NO  2   g       2  NO  g      subscript  O  2   g      2\mbox{NO}_{2}(g)\rightarrow\;2\mbox{NO}(g)+\mbox{O}_{2}(g)      Pseudo-first order  Measuring a second order reaction rate with reactants A and B can be problematic: The concentrations of the two reactants must be followed simultaneously, which is more difficult; or measure one of them and calculate the other as a difference, which is less precise. A common solution for that problem is the pseudo-first order approximation .  If the concentration of one of a reactants remains constant because it is supplied in great excess, its concentration can be absorbed within the rate constant, obtaining a pseudo first order reaction constant, because in fact, it depends on the concentration of only one reactant. If, for example, [B] remains constant, then:       r   =   k   [  A  ]    [  B  ]    =    k  ′    [  A  ]          r    k   delimited-[]  A    delimited-[]  B            superscript  k  normal-′    delimited-[]  A       \ r=k[A][B]=k^{\prime}[A]     where     k  ′   =   k    [  B  ]   0         superscript  k  normal-′     k   subscript   delimited-[]  B   0      k^{\prime}=k[B]_{0}   (k' or k obs with units s −1 ) and an expression is obtained identical to the first order expression above.  One way to obtain a pseudo-first order reaction is to use a large excess of one of the reactants ([B]>>[A]) would work for the previous example) so that, as the reaction progresses, only a small amount of the reactant is consumed, and its concentration can be considered to stay constant. By collecting    k  ′     superscript  k  normal-′    k^{\prime}   for many reactions with different (but excess) concentrations of [B], a plot of    k  ′     superscript  k  normal-′    k^{\prime}   versus [B] gives   k   k   k   (the regular second order rate constant) as the slope.  Example: The hydrolysis of esters by dilute mineral acids follows pseudo-first order kinetics where the concentration of water is present in large excess.   CH 3 COOCH 3 + H 2 O → CH 3 COOH + CH 3 OH   Summary for reaction orders 0, 1, 2, and n  Elementary reaction steps with order 3 (called ternary reactions ) are rare and unlikely to occur.

The half-life of a first order reaction is often expressed as t 1/2 = 0.693/ k (as ln2 = 0.693).  Equilibrium reactions or opposed reactions  A pair of forward and reverse reactions may define an equilibrium process. For example, A and B react into X and Y and vice versa (s, t, u, and v are the stoichiometric coefficients ):         s   A   +   t  B    ⇌    u  X   +   v  Y       normal-⇌      s  A     t  B        u  X     v  Y      \ sA+tB\rightleftharpoons uX+vY     The reaction rate expression for the above reactions (assuming each one is elementary) can be expressed as:      r  =     k  1     [  A  ]   s     [  B  ]   t    -    k  2     [  X  ]   u      [  Y  ]   v          r       subscript  k  1    superscript   delimited-[]  A   s    superscript   delimited-[]  B   t       subscript  k  2    superscript   delimited-[]  X   u    superscript   delimited-[]  Y   v       r={k_{1}[A]^{s}[B]^{t}}-{k_{2}[X]^{u}[Y]^{v}}\,     where: k 1 is the rate coefficient for the reaction that consumes A and B; k 2 is the rate coefficient for the backwards reaction, which consumes X and Y and produces A and B.  The constants k 1 and k 2 are related to the equilibrium coefficient for the reaction (K) by the following relationship (set r=0 in balance):        k  1     [  A  ]   s     [  B  ]   t    =    k  2     [  X  ]   u      [  Y  ]   v            subscript  k  1    superscript   delimited-[]  A   s    superscript   delimited-[]  B   t       subscript  k  2    superscript   delimited-[]  X   u    superscript   delimited-[]  Y   v      {k_{1}[A]^{s}[B]^{t}=k_{2}[X]^{u}[Y]^{v}}\,         K  =      [  X  ]   u     [  Y  ]   v       [  A  ]   s     [  B  ]   t     =    k  1    k  2          K       superscript   delimited-[]  X   u    superscript   delimited-[]  Y   v       superscript   delimited-[]  A   s    superscript   delimited-[]  B   t             subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2       K=\frac{[X]^{u}[Y]^{v}}{[A]^{s}[B]^{t}}=\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}     (Figure)  Concentration of A (A 0 = 0.25 mole/l) and B versus time reaching equilibrium k f = 2 min −1 and k r = 1 min −1   Simple example  In a simple equilibrium between two species:      A  ⇌  B     normal-⇌  A  B    A\rightleftharpoons B     Where the reactions starts with an initial concentration of A,     [  A  ]   0     subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    [A]_{0}   , with an initial concentration of 0 for B at time t=0.  Then the constant K at equilibrium is expressed as:       K     =  def      k  f    k  b    =     [  B  ]   e     [  A  ]   e          superscript   def   K     subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b            subscript   delimited-[]  B   e    subscript   delimited-[]  A   e       K\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{k_{f}}{k_{b}}=\frac{\left[B\right]_{e}}{%
 \left[A\right]_{e}}     Where     [  A  ]   e     subscript   delimited-[]  A   e    [A]_{e}   and     [  B  ]   e     subscript   delimited-[]  B   e    [B]_{e}   are the concentrations of A and B at equilibrium, respectively.  The concentration of A at time t,     [  A  ]   t     subscript   delimited-[]  A   t    [A]_{t}   , is related to the concentration of B at time t,     [  B  ]   t     subscript   delimited-[]  B   t    [B]_{t}   , by the equilibrium reaction equation:        [  A  ]   t   =     [  A  ]   0   -    [  B  ]   t         subscript   delimited-[]  A   t      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    subscript   delimited-[]  B   t      \ [A]_{t}=[A]_{0}-[B]_{t}     Note that the term     [  B  ]   0     subscript   delimited-[]  B   0    [B]_{0}   is not present because, in this simple example, the initial concentration of B is 0.  This applies even when time t is at infinity; i.e., equilibrium has been reached:        [  A  ]   e   =     [  A  ]   0   -    [  B  ]   e         subscript   delimited-[]  A   e      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    subscript   delimited-[]  B   e      \ [A]_{e}=[A]_{0}-[B]_{e}     then it follows, by the definition of K, that        [  B  ]   e   =  x  =     k  f     k  f   +   k  b       [  A  ]   0           subscript   delimited-[]  B   e   x            subscript  k  f      subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0       \ [B]_{e}=x=\frac{k_{f}}{k_{f}+k_{b}}[A]_{0}     and, therefore,        [  A  ]   e   =     [  A  ]   0   -  x   =     k  b     k  f   +   k  b       [  A  ]   0           subscript   delimited-[]  A   e      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0   x             subscript  k  b      subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0       \ [A]_{e}=[A]_{0}-x=\frac{k_{b}}{k_{f}+k_{b}}[A]_{0}     These equations allow us to uncouple the system of differential equations , and allow us to solve for the concentration of A alone.  The reaction equation, given previously as:      r  =     k  1     [  A  ]   s     [  B  ]   t    -    k  2     [  X  ]   u      [  Y  ]   v          r       subscript  k  1    superscript   delimited-[]  A   s    superscript   delimited-[]  B   t       subscript  k  2    superscript   delimited-[]  X   u    superscript   delimited-[]  Y   v       r={k_{1}[A]^{s}[B]^{t}}-{k_{2}[X]^{u}[Y]^{v}}\,          -    d   [  A  ]     d  t     =     k  f     [  A  ]   t    -    k  b      [  B  ]   t                d   delimited-[]  A      d  t          subscript  k  f    subscript   delimited-[]  A   t       subscript  k  b    subscript   delimited-[]  B   t       -\frac{d[A]}{dt}={k_{f}[A]_{t}}-{k_{b}[B]_{t}}\,     The derivative is negative because this is the rate of the reaction going from A to B, and therefore the concentration of A is decreasing. To simplify annotation, let x be     [  A  ]   t     subscript   delimited-[]  A   t    [A]_{t}   , the concentration of A at time t. Let    x  e     subscript  x  e    x_{e}   be the concentration of A at equilibrium. Then:       -    d   [  A  ]     d  t     =     k  f     [  A  ]   t    -    k  b      [  B  ]   t                d   delimited-[]  A      d  t          subscript  k  f    subscript   delimited-[]  A   t       subscript  k  b    subscript   delimited-[]  B   t       -\frac{d[A]}{dt}={k_{f}[A]_{t}}-{k_{b}[B]_{t}}\,          -    d  x    d  t     =     k  f   x   -    k  b      [  B  ]   t                d  x     d  t          subscript  k  f   x      subscript  k  b    subscript   delimited-[]  B   t       -\frac{dx}{dt}={k_{f}x}-{k_{b}[B]_{t}}\,          -    d  x    d  t     =     k  f   x   -    k  b    (     [  A  ]   0   -  x   )               d  x     d  t          subscript  k  f   x      subscript  k  b      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0   x       -\frac{dx}{dt}={k_{f}x}-{k_{b}([A]_{0}-x)}\,          -    d  x    d  t     =     (    k  f   +   k  b    )   x   -    k  b      [  A  ]   0                d  x     d  t            subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b    x      subscript  k  b    subscript   delimited-[]  A   0       -\frac{dx}{dt}={(k_{f}+k_{b})x}-{k_{b}[A]_{0}}\,     Since:        k  f   +   k  b    =    k  b      [  A  ]   0    x  e            subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b       subscript  k  b      subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    subscript  x  e       k_{f}+k_{b}={k_{b}\frac{[A]_{0}}{x_{e}}}     The reaction rate becomes:         d  x    d  t     =      k  b     [  A  ]   0     x  e     (    x  e   -  x   )            d  x     d  t           subscript  k  b    subscript   delimited-[]  A   0     subscript  x  e       subscript  x  e   x      \ \frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{k_{b}[A]_{0}}{x_{e}}(x_{e}-x)     which results in:       ln   (      [  A  ]   0   -    [  A  ]   e       [  A  ]   t   -    [  A  ]   e     )    =    (    k  f   +   k  b    )   t              subscript   delimited-[]  A   0    subscript   delimited-[]  A   e       subscript   delimited-[]  A   t    subscript   delimited-[]  A   e           subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b    t     \ln\left(\frac{[A]_{0}-[A]_{e}}{[A]_{t}-[A]_{e}}\right)=(k_{f}+k_{b})t     A plot of the negative natural logarithm of the concentration of A in time minus the concentration at equilibrium versus time t gives a straight line with slope k f + k b . By measurement of A e and B e the values of K and the two reaction rate constants will be known. 6  Generalization of simple example  If the concentration at the time t = 0 is different from above, the simplifications above are invalid, and a system of differential equations must be solved. However, this system can also be solved exactly to yield the following generalized expressions:       [  A  ]   =      [  A  ]   0    1    k  f   +   k  b      (    k  b   +    k  f    e   -    (    k  f   +   k  b    )   t       )    +     [  B  ]   0     k  b     k  f   +   k  b      (   1  -   e   -    (    k  f   +   k  b    )   t      )          delimited-[]  A        subscript   delimited-[]  A   0     1     subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b        subscript  k  b      subscript  k  f    superscript  e         subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b    t           subscript   delimited-[]  B   0      subscript  k  b      subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b       1   superscript  e         subscript  k  f    subscript  k  b    t          \left[A\right]=\left[A\right]_{0}\frac{1}{k_{f}+k_{b}}\left(k_{b}+k_{f}e^{-%

Note that this definition includes the elementary reactions :   zero order reactions   for which     s   z  j    =  0       subscript  s    z  j    0    s_{zj}=0   for all   z   z   z   ,   first order reactions   for which     s   z  j    =  1       subscript  s    z  j    1    s_{zj}=1   for a single   z   z   z   ,   second order reactions   for which     s   z  j    =  1       subscript  s    z  j    1    s_{zj}=1   for exactly two   z   z   z   , i.e., a bimolecular reaction, or     s   z  j    =  2       subscript  s    z  j    2    s_{zj}=2   for a single   z   z   z   , i.e., a dimerization reaction.  Each of which are discussed in detail below. One can define the stoichiometric matrix        S   i  j    =    r   i  j    -   s   i  j      ,       subscript  S    i  j       subscript  r    i  j     subscript  s    i  j       S_{ij}=r_{ij}-s_{ij},   denoting the net extend of molecules of   i   i   i   in reaction   j   j   j   . The reaction rate equations can then be written in the general form         d   [   X  i   ]     d  t    =    ∑   j  =  1   R     S   i  j     f  j    (   [   X  →   ]   )      .          d   delimited-[]   subscript  X  i       d  t      superscript   subscript     j  1    R      subscript  S    i  j     subscript  f  j    delimited-[]   normal-→  X        \frac{d[X_{i}]}{dt}=\sum_{j=1}^{R}S_{ij}f_{j}([\vec{X}]).     Note that this is the product of the stoichiometric matrix and the vector of reaction rate functions. Particular simple solutions exist in equilibrium,      d   [   X  i   ]     d  t    =  0          d   delimited-[]   subscript  X  i       d  t    0    \frac{d[X_{i}]}{dt}=0   , for systems composed of merely reversible reactions. In this case the rate of the forward and backward reactions are equal, a principle called detailed balance . Note that detailed balance is a property of the stoichiometric matrix    S   i  j      subscript  S    i  j     S_{ij}   alone and does not depend on the particular form of the rate functions    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   . All other cases where detailed balance is violated are commonly studied by flux balance analysis which has been developed to understand metabolic pathways . 10 11  General dynamics of unimolecular conversion  For a general unimolecular reaction involving interconversion of   N   N   N   different species, whose concentrations at time   t   t   t   are denoted by     X  1    (  t  )        subscript  X  1   t    X_{1}(t)   through     X  N    (  t  )        subscript  X  N   t    X_{N}(t)   , an analytic form for the time-evolution of the species can be found. Let the rate constant of conversion from species    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   to species    X  j     subscript  X  j    X_{j}   be denoted as    k   i  j      subscript  k    i  j     k_{ij}   , and construct a rate-constant matrix   K   K   K   whose entries are the    k   i  j      subscript  k    i  j     k_{ij}   .  Also, let     X   (  t  )    =    (    X  1    (  t  )    ,    X  2    (  t  )    ,  …  ,    X  N    (  t  )    )   T         X  t    superscript      subscript  X  1   t      subscript  X  2   t   normal-…     subscript  X  N   t    T     X(t)=(X_{1}(t),X_{2}(t),...,X_{N}(t))^{T}   be the vector of concentrations as a function of time.  Let    J  =    (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  …  ,  1  )   T       J   superscript   1  1  1  normal-…  1   T     J=(1,1,1,...,1)^{T}   be the vector of ones.  Let   I   I   I   be the   N   N   N   ×   N   N   N   identity matrix.  Let    D  i  a  g      D  i  a  g    Diag   be the function that takes a vector and constructs a diagonal matrix whose on-diagonal entries are those of the vector.  Let    ℒ   -  1      superscript  ℒ    1     \displaystyle\mathcal{L}^{-1}   be the inverse Laplace transform from   s   s   s   to   t   t   t   .  Then the time-evolved state    X   (  t  )       X  t    X(t)   is given by       X   (  t  )    =    ℒ   -  1     [     (     s  I   +   D  i  a  g   (   K  J   )     -   K  T    )    -  1    X   (  0  )    ]          X  t      superscript  ℒ    1     delimited-[]     superscript        s  I     D  i  a  g    K  J      superscript  K  T      1    X  0       X(t)=\displaystyle\mathcal{L}^{-1}[(sI+Diag(KJ)-K^{T})^{-1}X(0)]   , thus providing the relation between the initial conditions of the system and its state at time   t   t   t   .
