   Josephson energy      Josephson energy   In superconductivity , the Josephson energy is the potential energy accumulated in the Josephson junction when a supercurrent flows through it. One can think of a Josephson junction as a non-linear inductance which accumulates (magnetic field) energy when a current passes through it. In contrast to real inductance, no magnetic field is created by a supercurrent in Josephson junction —the accumulated energy is a Josephson energy.  Derivation  For the simplest case the current-phase relation (CPR) is given by (aka the first Josephson relation):        I  s   =    I  c    sin   (  ϕ  )      ,       subscript  I  s      subscript  I  c     ϕ      I_{s}=I_{c}\sin(\phi),   where     I  s      subscript  I  s    I_{s}\,   is the supercurrent flowing through the junction,     I  c      subscript  I  c    I_{c}\,   is the critical current, and    ϕ    ϕ   \phi\,   is the Josephson phase , see Josephson junction for details.  Imagine that initially at time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   the junction was in the ground state    ϕ  =  0      ϕ  0    \phi=0   and finally at time   t   t   t   the junction has the phase   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   . The work done on the junction (so the junction energy is increased by)       U  =    ∫  0  t     I  s    V   d  t    =     Φ  0    2  π      ∫  0  t     I  s      d  ϕ    d  t     d  t     =     Φ  0    2  π      ∫  0  ϕ     I  c    sin   (  ϕ  )    d  ϕ     =      Φ  0    I  c     2  π     (   1  -   cos  ϕ    )     .        U    superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  I  s   V  d  t              subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π      superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  I  s       d  ϕ     d  t    d  t               subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π      superscript   subscript   0   ϕ      subscript  I  c     ϕ   d  ϕ                 subscript  normal-Φ  0    subscript  I  c      2  π      1    ϕ        U=\int_{0}^{t}I_{s}V\,dt=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{t}I_{s}\frac{d\phi}{dt%
 }\,dt=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\phi}I_{c}\sin(\phi)\,d\phi=\frac{\Phi_{0%
 }I_{c}}{2\pi}(1-\cos\phi).     Here     E  J   =      Φ  0    I  c    /  2   π        subscript  E  J          subscript  normal-Φ  0    subscript  I  c    2   π     E_{J}={\Phi_{0}I_{c}}/{2\pi}   sets the characteristic scale of the Josephson energy, and    (   1  -   cos  ϕ    )      1    ϕ     (1-\cos\phi)   sets its dependence on the phase   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   . The energy    U   (  ϕ  )       U  ϕ    U(\phi)   accumulated inside the junction depends only on the current state of the junction, but not on history or velocities, i.e. it is a potential energy. Note, that    U   (  ϕ  )       U  ϕ    U(\phi)   has a minimum equal to zero for the ground state    ϕ  =   2  π  n       ϕ    2  π  n     \phi=2\pi n   ,   n   n   n   is any integer.  Josephson inductance  Imagine that the Josephson phase across the junction is     ϕ  0      subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}\,   and the supercurrent flowing through the junction is       I  0   =    I  c    sin    ϕ  0           subscript  I  0      subscript  I  c      subscript  ϕ  0       I_{0}=I_{c}\sin\phi_{0}\,   (This is the same equation as above, except now we will look at small variations in     I  s      subscript  I  s    I_{s}\,   and    ϕ    ϕ   \phi\,   around the values     I  0      subscript  I  0    I_{0}\,   and     ϕ  0      subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}\,   .)  Imagine that we add little extra current (dc or ac)     δ  I   (  t  )    ≪   I  c      much-less-than    δ  I  t    subscript  I  c     \delta I(t)\ll I_{c}   through JJ, and want to see how the junction reacts. The phase across the junction changes to become    ϕ  =    ϕ  0   +   δ   ϕ         ϕ     subscript  ϕ  0     δ  ϕ      \phi=\phi_{0}+\delta\phi\,   . One can write:        I  0   +   δ  I    =    I  c    sin   (    ϕ  0   +   δ  ϕ    )            subscript  I  0     δ  I       subscript  I  c        subscript  ϕ  0     δ  ϕ        I_{0}+\delta I=I_{c}\sin(\phi_{0}+\delta\phi)\,   Assuming that    δ   ϕ       δ  ϕ    \delta\phi\,   is small, we make a Taylor expansion in the right hand side to arrive at       δ  I   =    I  c    cos   (   ϕ  0   )    δ   ϕ          δ  I      subscript  I  c      subscript  ϕ  0    δ  ϕ     \delta I=I_{c}\cos(\phi_{0})\delta\phi\,   The voltage across the junction (we use the 2nd Josephson relation) is       V  =     Φ  0    2  π     ϕ  ˙    =     Φ  0    2  π     (      ϕ  0   ⏟  ˙     =  0    +    δ  ϕ   ˙    )    =     Φ  0    2  π       δ  I   ˙     I  c    cos   (   ϕ  0   )        .        V       subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π     normal-˙  ϕ              subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π       subscript   normal-⏟   normal-˙   subscript  ϕ  0       absent  0     normal-˙    δ  ϕ                subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π       normal-˙    δ  I       subscript  I  c      subscript  ϕ  0          V=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi}\dot{\phi}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi}(\underbrace{\dot{\phi_%
 {0}}}_{=0}+\dot{\delta\phi})=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi}\frac{\dot{\delta I}}{I_{c}%
 \cos(\phi_{0})}.   If we compare this expression with the expression for voltage across the conventional inductance      V  =   L    ∂  I    ∂  t         V    L      I     t       V=L\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}   ,  we can define the so-called Josephson inductance         L  J    (   ϕ  0   )    =    Φ  0    2  π   I  c    cos   (   ϕ  0   )      =     L  J    (  0  )     cos   (   ϕ  0   )      .           subscript  L  J    subscript  ϕ  0       subscript  normal-Φ  0     2  π   subscript  I  c      subscript  ϕ  0                subscript  L  J   0      subscript  ϕ  0        L_{J}(\phi_{0})=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi I_{c}\cos(\phi_{0})}=\frac{L_{J}(0)}{\cos%
 (\phi_{0})}.   One can see that this inductance is not constant, but depends on the phase    (   ϕ  0   )     subscript  ϕ  0    (\phi_{0})\,   across the junction. The typical value is given by     L  J    (  0  )        subscript  L  J   0    L_{J}(0)\,   and is determined only by the critical current     I  c      subscript  I  c    I_{c}\,   . Note that, according to definition, the Josephson inductance can even become infinite or negative (if     cos   (   ϕ  0   )    ≤   0          subscript  ϕ  0    0    \cos(\phi_{0})<=0\,   ).  One can also calculate the change in Josephson energy      δ  U   (   ϕ  0   )   =  U   (  ϕ  )   -  U   (   ϕ  0   )   =   E  J    (  cos   (   ϕ  0   )   -  cos   (   ϕ  0   +  δ  ϕ  )       fragments  δ  U   fragments  normal-(   subscript  ϕ  0   normal-)    U   fragments  normal-(  ϕ  normal-)    U   fragments  normal-(   subscript  ϕ  0   normal-)     subscript  E  J    fragments  normal-(    fragments  normal-(   subscript  ϕ  0   normal-)      fragments  normal-(   subscript  ϕ  0    δ  ϕ  normal-)      \delta U(\phi_{0})=U(\phi)-U(\phi_{0})=E_{J}(\cos(\phi_{0})-\cos(\phi_{0}+%
 \delta\phi)\,   Making Taylor expansion for small    δ   ϕ       δ  ϕ    \delta\phi\,   , we get       ≈    E  J    sin   (   ϕ  0   )    δ  ϕ   =      E  J    sin   (   ϕ  0   )       I  c    cos   ϕ  0      δ  I         absent     subscript  E  J      subscript  ϕ  0    δ  ϕ               subscript  E  J      subscript  ϕ  0        subscript  I  c      subscript  ϕ  0      δ  I      \approx E_{J}\sin(\phi_{0})\delta\phi=\frac{E_{J}\sin(\phi_{0})}{I_{c}\cos\phi%
 _{0}}\delta I   If we now compare this with the expression for increase of the inductance energy     d   E  L    =   L  I  δ   I          d   subscript  E  L      L  I  δ  I     dE_{L}=LI\delta I\,   , we again get the same expression for    L    L   L\,   .  Note, that although Josephson junction behaves like an inductance, there is no associated magnetic field. The corresponding energy is hidden inside the junction. The Josephson Inductance is also known as a Kinetic Inductance - the behaviour is derived from the kinetic energy of the charge carriers, not energy in a magnetic field.
