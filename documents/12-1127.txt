   Maximum-minimums identity      Maximum-minimums identity   In mathematics, the maximum-minimums identity is a relation between the maximum element of a set S of n numbers and the minima of the 2 n − 1 nonempty subsets of S .  Let S = { x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n }. The identity states that  $$\begin{align}
 \max\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n}\} 
 & = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i or conversely
 
 : \begin{align}
 \min\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n}\} 
 & = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i For a probabilistic proof, see the reference.
