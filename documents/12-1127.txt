Maximum-minimums identity

In mathematics, the maximum-minimums identity is a relation between the maximum element of a set S of n numbers and the minima of the 2n − 1 nonempty subsets of S.
Let S = {x1, x2, ..., xn}. The identity states that
$$\begin{align}
 \max\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n}\} 
 & = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i
 or conversely
