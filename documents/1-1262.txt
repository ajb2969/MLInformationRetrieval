   Closed-loop transfer function      Closed-loop transfer function   A closed-loop transfer function in control theory is a mathematical expression ( algorithm ) describing the net result of the effects of a closed ( feedback ) loop on the input signal to the circuits enclosed by the loop.  Overview  The closed-loop transfer function is measured at the output. The output signal waveform can be calculated from the closed-loop transfer function and the input signal waveform.  An example of a closed-loop transfer function is shown below:  The summing node and the G ( s ) and H ( s ) blocks can all be combined into one block, which would have the following transfer function:        Y   (  s  )     X   (  s  )     =    G   (  s  )     1  +   G   (  s  )   H   (  s  )              Y  s     X  s        G  s     1    G  s  H  s       \dfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\dfrac{G(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)}     Derivation  We define an intermediate signal Z shown as follows:  (Figure)  Closed Loop Block Deriv.png   Using this figure we write:       Y   (  s  )    =   Z   (  s  )   G   (  s  )          Y  s     Z  s  G  s     Y(s)=Z(s)G(s)          Z   (  s  )    =    X   (  s  )    -   Y   (  s  )   H   (  s  )           Z  s       X  s     Y  s  H  s      Z(s)=X(s)-Y(s)H(s)          X   (  s  )    =    Z   (  s  )    +   Y   (  s  )   H   (  s  )           X  s       Z  s     Y  s  H  s      X(s)=Z(s)+Y(s)H(s)          X   (  s  )    =    Z   (  s  )    +   Z   (  s  )   G   (  s  )   H   (  s  )           X  s       Z  s     Z  s  G  s  H  s      X(s)=Z(s)+Z(s)G(s)H(s)          ⇒    Y   (  s  )     X   (  s  )     =    Z   (  s  )   G   (  s  )      Z   (  s  )    +   Z   (  s  )   G   (  s  )   H   (  s  )           normal-⇒  absent      Y  s     X  s             Z  s  G  s       Z  s     Z  s  G  s  H  s        \Rightarrow\dfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\dfrac{Z(s)G(s)}{Z(s)+Z(s)G(s)H(s)}           Y   (  s  )     X   (  s  )     =    G   (  s  )     1  +   G   (  s  )   H   (  s  )              Y  s     X  s        G  s     1    G  s  H  s       \dfrac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\dfrac{G(s)}{1+G(s)H(s)}     See also   Federal Standard 1037C  Open-loop controller   References     "  Category:Control theory  Category:Cybernetics
