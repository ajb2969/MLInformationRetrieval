   2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate desulfinase      2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate desulfinase   In enzymology , a 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate desulfinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxybiphenyl + sulfite   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-hydroxybiphenyl and sulfite .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-sulfur bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate sulfohydrolase . Other names in common use include gene dszB-encoded hydrolase , 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzenesulfinate:H 2 O hydrolase , DszB , HBPSi desulfinase , 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzenesulfinate sulfohydrolase , HPBS desulfinase , 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzenesulfinate hydrolase , 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzenesulfinate desulfinase , and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzenesulfinate desulfinase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
