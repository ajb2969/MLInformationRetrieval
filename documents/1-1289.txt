   Equivalent noise resistance      Equivalent noise resistance   In telecommunication , an equivalent noise resistance is a quantitative representation in resistance units of the spectral density of a noise - voltage generator, given by     R  n   =    π   W  n     k   T  0          subscript  R  n       π   subscript  W  n      k   subscript  T  0       R_{n}=\frac{\pi W_{n}}{kT_{0}}   where    W  n     subscript  W  n    W_{n}   is the spectral density,   k   k   k   is the Boltzmann's constant ,    T  0     subscript  T  0    T_{0}   is the standard noise temperature (290 K), so     k   T  0    =    4.00  ×    10   -  21       [   W  s   ]          k   subscript  T  0        4.00   superscript  10    21      delimited-[]    W  s       kT_{0}=4.00\times 10^{-21}\,[Ws]   .  Note: The equivalent noise resistance in terms of the mean-square noise-generator voltage, e 2 , within a frequency increment, Δ f , is given by        R  n   =    e  2    4  k    T  0    Δ  f     .       subscript  R  n      superscript  e  2     4  k   subscript  T  0   normal-Δ  f      R_{n}=\frac{e^{2}}{4kT_{0}\,\Delta f}.
