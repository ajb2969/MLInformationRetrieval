Equivalent noise resistance

In telecommunication, an equivalent noise resistance is a quantitative representation in resistance units of the spectral density of a noise-voltage generator, given by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the spectral density, 
 
 
 
  is the Boltzmann's constant, 
 
 
 
  is the standard noise temperature (290 K), so 
 
 
 
 .
Note: The equivalent noise resistance in terms of the mean-square noise-generator voltage, e2, within a frequency increment, Δ f, is given by
