   Riemann–von Mangoldt formula      Riemann–von Mangoldt formula   In mathematics , the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula , named for Bernhard Riemann and Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt , describes the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function .  The formula states that the number N ( T ) of zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part greater than 0 and less than or equal to T satisfies        N   (  T  )    =      T   2  π     log   T   2  π      -   T   2  π     +   O   (   log  T   )      .        N  T           T    2  π        T    2  π        T    2  π       O    T       N(T)=\frac{T}{2\pi}\log{\frac{T}{2\pi}}-\frac{T}{2\pi}+O(\log{T}).     The formula was stated by Riemann in his notable paper On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude (1859) and was finally proved by Mangoldt in 1905.  Backlund gives an explicit form of the error for all T greater than 2:       |    N   (  T  )    -   (     T   2  π     log   T   2  π      -   T   2  π    -   7  8    )    |   <    0.137   log  T    +   0.443   log   log  T     +  4.350 .
