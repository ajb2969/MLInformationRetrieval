De Rham invariant

In geometric topology, the de Rham invariant is a mod 2 invariant of a (4k+1)-dimensional manifold, that is, an element of 
 
 
 
  – either 0 or 1. It can be thought of as the simply-connected symmetric L-group

 
  and thus analogous to the other invariants from L-theory: the signature, a 4k-dimensional invariant (either symmetric or quadratic, 
 
 
 
 ), and the Kervaire invariant, a (4k+2)-dimensional quadratic invariant 
 
 

It is named for Swiss mathematician Georges de Rham, and used in surgery theory.12
Definition
The de Rham invariant of a (4k+1)-dimensional manifold can be defined in various equivalent ways:3

the rank of the 2-torsion in 
 
 
 
  as an integer mod 2;
the Stiefel–Whitney number

 
 ;
the (squared) Wu number, 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Wu class of the normal bundle of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the Steenrod square ; formally, as with all characteristic numbers, this is evaluated on the fundamental class

 
 ;
in terms of a semicharacteristic.
