   Reaction–diffusion–advection equation      Reaction–diffusion–advection equation   The reaction–diffusion–advection equation is a partial differential equation that models the concentration of a chemical species in a classical reaction–diffusion–advection process. In that process, a chemical species undergoes a reaction , can diffuse in the solvent, and is transported by the bulk movement of the solvent ( advection ). The equation modeling the concentration    u   (  𝒙  ,  t  )       u   𝒙  t     u(\boldsymbol{x},t)   (units: M),    𝒙  ∈   ℝ  n       𝒙   superscript  ℝ  n     \boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   of the chemical species u is:          ∂  u    ∂  t    +   ∇  ⋅   (    𝒗  u   -   D   ∇  u     )     =  f   ,            u     t     normal-⋅  normal-∇      𝒗  u     D   normal-∇  u       f    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\left(\boldsymbol{v}u-D\nabla u\right%
 )=f,     where D is the diffusion coefficient (units: length 2 /time),    𝒗  ∈   ℝ  n       𝒗   superscript  ℝ  n     \boldsymbol{v}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   is the bulk velocity (units: length/time), and   f   f   f   (units: M/s) is the reaction term that models the generation or decay of the species u . In general, each     f  ,  D   ,     f  D    f,D,   and   𝒗   𝒗   \boldsymbol{v}   may depend on space, time, or the concentration of u itself. The equation above is a conservation of mass in a continuum model, where accumulation at a point is the next flux (rate in minus rate out) of a point plus the generation at that point (see continuity equation ).
