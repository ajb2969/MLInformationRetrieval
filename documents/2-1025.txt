Quotient rule

In calculus, the quotient rule is a method of finding the derivative of a function that is the quotient of two other functions for which derivatives exist.123
If the function one wishes to differentiate, 
 
 
 
 , can be written as



and 
 
 
 
 , then the rule states that the derivative of 
 
 
 
 
  is



More precisely, if all x in some open set containing the number a satisfy 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  both exist, then 
 
 
 
 
  exists as well and



And this can be extended to calculate the second derivative as well (one can prove this by taking the derivative of 
 
 
 
  twice). The result of this is:



The quotient rule formula can be derived from the product rule and chain rule.
Examples
The derivative of 
 
 
 
  is:



In the example above, the choices






were made. Analogously, the derivative of sin(x)/x2 (when x ≠ 0) is:



Proof

Let 
 
 



Then 
 
 











Alternative proof (logarithmic differentiation)

Let 
 
 





Differentiate both sides,
