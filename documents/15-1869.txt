Acyl-homoserine-lactone acylase

Acyl-homoserine-lactone acylase (, acyl-homoserine lactone acylase, AHL-acylase, AiiD, N-acyl-homoserine lactone acylase, PA2385 protein, quorum-quenching AHL acylase, quorum-quenching enzyme, PvdQ, QuiP) is an enzyme with system name N-acyl-L-homoserine-lactone amidohydrolase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

an N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-homoserine lactone + a carboxylate


Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species .
