   Recurrent point      Recurrent point   In mathematics , a recurrent point for a function f is a point that is in its own limit set by f . Any neighborhood containing the recurrent point will also contain (a countable number of) iterates of it as well.  Definition  Let   X   X   X   be a Hausdorff space and    f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f\colon X\to X   a function. A point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   is said to be recurrent (for   f   f   f   ) if    x  ∈   ω   (  x  )        x    ω  x     x\in\omega(x)   , i.e. if   x   x   x   belongs to its   ω   ω   \omega   - limit set . This means that for each neighborhood    U   U   U   of   x   x   x   there exists    n  >  0      n  0    n>0   such that      f  n    (  x  )    ∈  U         superscript  f  n   x   U    f^{n}(x)\in U   . 1  The set of recurrent points of   f   f   f   is often denoted    R   (  f  )       R  f    R(f)   and is called the recurrent set of   f   f   f   . Its closure is called the Birkhoff center of   f   f   f   , 2 and appears in the work of George David Birkhoff on dynamical systems . 3 4  Every recurrent point is a nonwandering point , 5 hence if   f   f   f   is a homeomorphism and   X   X   X   is compact , then    R   (  f  )       R  f    R(f)   is an invariant subset of the non-wandering set of   f   f   f   (and may be a proper subset ).
