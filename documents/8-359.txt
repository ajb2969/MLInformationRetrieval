Recurrent point

In mathematics, a recurrent point for a function f is a point that is in its own limit set by f. Any neighborhood containing the recurrent point will also contain (a countable number of) iterates of it as well.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Hausdorff space and 
 
 
 
  a function. A point 
 
 
 
  is said to be recurrent (for 
 
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
 , i.e. if 
 
 
 
  belongs to its 
 
 
 
 -limit set. This means that for each neighborhood

 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  such that

The set of recurrent points of 
 
 
 
  is often denoted 
 
 
 
  and is called the recurrent set of 
 
 
 
 
 . Its closure is called the Birkhoff center of 
 
 
 
 ,2 and appears in the work of George David Birkhoff on dynamical systems.34
Every recurrent point is a nonwandering point,5 hence if 
 
 
 
  is a homeomorphism and 
 
 
 
  is compact, then 
 
 
 
  is an invariant subset of the non-wandering set of 
 
 
 
 
  (and may be a proper subset).
