Bilunabirotunda

In geometry, the bilunabirotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J91). It is one of the elementary Johnson solids that do not arise from "cut and paste" manipulations of the Platonic and Archimedean solids.
Cartesian coordinates
The following define the vertices of a bilunabirotunda centered at the origin with edge length 1:

















where 
 
 
 
  is the golden ratio.

Six bilunabirotundae can be augmented around a cube with pyritohedral symmetry. B. M. Stewart labeled this 6 bilunabirotundae model as 6J91(P4).1
The bilunabirotunda can be used with the regular dodecahedron and cube as a space-filling honeycomb.
