Benzoylformate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a benzoylformate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the following chemical reaction:

benzoylformate + H+

 
  benzaldehyde + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, benzoylformate, and two products, benzaldehyde and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzoylformate carboxy-lyase (benzaldehyde-forming). Other names in common use include phenylglyoxylate decarboxylase, and benzoylformate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation and toluene and xylene degradation. It employs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate.
