Equivariant differential form

In differential geometry, an equivariant differential form on a manifold M acted by a Lie group G is a polynomial map


 
  from the Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  to the space of differential forms on M that is equivariant; i.e.,


 
  In other words, an equivariant differential form is an invariant element of

For an equivariant differential form

  of 
 
 
 
  is defined by


 
  where d is the usual exterior derivative and 
 
 
 
  is the interior product by the fundamental vector field generated by X. It is easy to see 
 
 
 
  (use the fact the Lie derivative of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
  is zero) and one then puts


 
 , which is called the equivariant cohomology of M (which coincides with the ordinary equivariant cohomology defined in terms of Borel construction.) The definition is due to H. Cartan. The notion has an application to the equivariant index theory.


 
 -closed or 
 
 
 
 -exact forms are called equivariantly closed or equivariantly exact.
The integral of an equivariantly closed form may be evaluated from its restriction to the fixed point by means of the localization formula.
