   Deligne cohomology      Deligne cohomology   In mathematics , Deligne cohomology is the hypercohomology of the Deligne complex of a complex manifold . It was introduced by Pierre Deligne in unpublished work in about 1972 as a cohomology theory for algebraic varieties that includes both ordinary cohomology and intermediate Jacobians .  For introductory accounts of Deligne cohomology see , , and .

Depending on the context,    Œ©  X  *     subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©    X    \Omega^{*}_{X}   is either the complex of smooth (i.e., C ‚àû ) differential forms or of holomorphic forms, respectively. The Deligne cohomology  is the q -th hypercohomology of the Deligne complex.  Properties  Deligne cohomology groups  can be described geometrically, especially in low degrees. For p = 0, it agrees with the q -th singular cohomology group (with Z -coefficients), by definition. For q = 2 and p = 1, it is isomorphic to the group of isomorphism classes of smooth (or holomorphic, depending on the context) principal C √ó -bundles over X . For p = q = 2, it is the group of isomorphism classes of C √ó -bundles with connection . For q = 3 and p = 2 or 3, descriptions in terms of gerbes are available (). This has been generalized to a description in higher degrees in terms of iterated classifying spaces and connections on them ().  Applications  Deligne cohomology is used to formulate Beilinson conjectures on special values of L-functions .
