   Difference polynomials      Difference polynomials   In mathematics , in the area of complex analysis , the general difference polynomials are a polynomial sequence , a certain subclass of the Sheffer polynomials , which include the Newton polynomials , Selberg's polynomials , and the Stirling interpolation polynomials as special cases.  Definition  The general difference polynomial sequence is given by        p  n    (  z  )    =    z  n    (      z  -   β  n   -  1        n  -  1      )           subscript  p  n   z       z  n    binomial    z    β  n   1     n  1       p_{n}(z)=\frac{z}{n}{{z-\beta n-1}\choose{n-1}}     where    (      z      n      )     binomial  z  n    {z\choose n}   is the binomial coefficient . For    β  =  0      β  0    \beta=0   , the generated polynomials     p  n    (  z  )        subscript  p  n   z    p_{n}(z)   are the Newton polynomials         p  n    (  z  )    =   (     z      n     )   =    z   (   z  -  1   )   ⋯   (    z  -  n   +  1   )     n  !     .           subscript  p  n   z    binomial  z  n            z    z  1   normal-⋯      z  n   1      n       p_{n}(z)={z\choose n}=\frac{z(z-1)\cdots(z-n+1)}{n!}.     The case of    β  =  1      β  1    \beta=1   generates Selberg's polynomials, and the case of    β  =   -   1  /  2        β      1  2      \beta=-1/2   generates Stirling's interpolation polynomials.  Moving differences  Given an analytic function     f   (  z  )       f  z    f(z)   , define the moving difference of f as        ℒ  n    (  f  )    =    Δ  n   f   (   β  n   )           subscript  ℒ  n   f      superscript  normal-Δ  n   f    β  n      \mathcal{L}_{n}(f)=\Delta^{n}f(\beta n)     where   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is the forward difference operator . Then, provided that f obeys certain summability conditions, then it may be represented in terms of these polynomials as        f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     p  n    (  z  )    ℒ  n    (  f  )      .        f  z     superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  p  n   z   subscript  ℒ  n   f      f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{n}(z)\mathcal{L}_{n}(f).     The conditions for summability (that is, convergence) for this sequence is a fairly complex topic; in general, one may say that a necessary condition is that the analytic function be of less than exponential type . Summability conditions are discussed in detail in Boas & Buck.  Generating function  The generating function for the general difference polynomials is given by        e   z  t    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     p  n    (  z  )     [    (    e  t   -  1   )    e   β  t     ]   n      .       superscript  e    z  t      superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  p  n   z   superscript   delimited-[]       superscript  e  t   1    superscript  e    β  t      n       e^{zt}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{n}(z)\left[\left(e^{t}-1\right)e^{\beta t}\right]%
 ^{n}.     This generating function can be brought into the form of the generalized Appell representation       K   (  z  ,  w  )    =   A   (  w  )   Ψ   (   z  g   (  w  )    )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     p  n    (  z  )    w  n             K   z  w      A  w  normal-Ψ    z  g  w           superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  p  n   z   superscript  w  n        K(z,w)=A(w)\Psi(zg(w))=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}p_{n}(z)w^{n}     by setting     A   (  w  )    =  1        A  w   1    A(w)=1   ,     Ψ   (  x  )    =   e  x         normal-Ψ  x    superscript  e  x     \Psi(x)=e^{x}   ,     g   (  w  )    =  t        g  w   t    g(w)=t   and    w  =    (    e  t   -  1   )    e   β  t         w       superscript  e  t   1    superscript  e    β  t       w=(e^{t}-1)e^{\beta t}   .
