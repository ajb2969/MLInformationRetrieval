Difference polynomials

In mathematics, in the area of complex analysis, the general difference polynomials are a polynomial sequence, a certain subclass of the Sheffer polynomials, which include the Newton polynomials, Selberg's polynomials, and the Stirling interpolation polynomials as special cases.
Definition
The general difference polynomial sequence is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the binomial coefficient. For 
 
 
 
 , the generated polynomials 
 
 
 
  are the Newton polynomials



The case of 
 
 
 
  generates Selberg's polynomials, and the case of 
 
 
 
  generates Stirling's interpolation polynomials.
Moving differences
Given an analytic function

 
 , define the moving difference of f as



where 
 
 
 
  is the forward difference operator. Then, provided that f obeys certain summability conditions, then it may be represented in terms of these polynomials as



The conditions for summability (that is, convergence) for this sequence is a fairly complex topic; in general, one may say that a necessary condition is that the analytic function be of less than exponential type. Summability conditions are discussed in detail in Boas & Buck.
Generating function
The generating function for the general difference polynomials is given by



This generating function can be brought into the form of the generalized Appell representation



by setting 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
