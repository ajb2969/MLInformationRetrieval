   Transition rate matrix      Transition rate matrix   In probability theory , a transition rate matrix (also known as an intensity matrix 1 2 or infinitesimal generator matrix 3 ) is an array of numbers describing the rate a continuous time Markov chain moves between states.  In a transition rate matrix Q (sometimes written A 4 ) element q ij (for i ≠ j ) denotes the rate departing from i and arriving in state j . Diagonal elements q ii are defined such that        q   i  i    =   -    ∑   j  ≠  i     q   j  i       .       subscript  q    i  i        subscript     j  i     subscript  q    j  i        q_{ii}=-\sum_{j\neq i}q_{ji}.   and therefore the rows of the matrix sum to zero.  Definition  A Q matrix ( q ij ) satisfies the following conditions 5   0 ≤ - q ii < ∞  0 ≤ q ij for all i ≠ j        ∑  j    q   i  j     =  0        subscript   j    subscript  q    i  j     0    \sum_{j}q_{ij}=0   for all i .   Example  An M/M/1 queue , a model which counts the number of jobs in a queueing system with arrivals at rate λ and services at rate μ, has transition rate matrix       Q  =    (      -  λ     λ      μ     -   (   μ  +  λ   )      λ         μ     -   (   μ  +  λ   )      λ            μ     -   (   μ  +  λ   )      λ                     ⋱     )   T    .
