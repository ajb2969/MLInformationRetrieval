   Pseudouridine kinase      Pseudouridine kinase   In enzymology , a pseudouridine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + pseudouridine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + pseudouridine 5'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and pseudouridine , whereas its two products are ADP and pseudouridine 5'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:pseudouridine 5'-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called pseudouridine kinase (phosphorylating) . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
