   Phylloquinone monooxygenase (2,3-epoxidizing)      Phylloquinone monooxygenase (2,3-epoxidizing)   In enzymology , a phylloquinone monooxygenase (2,3-epoxidizing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phylloquinone + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,3-epoxyphylloquinone + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are phylloquinone , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 2,3-epoxyphylloquinone , the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phylloquinone,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (2,3-epoxidizing) . Other names in common use include phylloquinone epoxidase , vitamin K 2,3-epoxidase , vitamin K epoxidase , and vitamin K 1 epoxidase .
