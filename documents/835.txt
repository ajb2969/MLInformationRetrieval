   Matrix-exponential distribution      Matrix-exponential distribution   In probability theory , the matrix-exponential distribution is an absolutely continuous distribution with rational Laplace–Stieltjes transform . 1 They were first introduced by David Cox in 1955 as distributions with rational Laplace–Stieltjes transforms . 2  The probability density function is       f   (  x  )    =   α   e    x   T    𝐬  for  x   ≥  0          f  x     α   superscript  e    x  T    𝐬  for  x        0     f(x)=\mathbf{\alpha}e^{x\,T}\mathbf{s}\text{ for }x\geq 0     (and 0 when x \begin{align} \alpha & \in \mathbb R^{1\times n}, \\ T & \in \mathbb R^{n\times n}, \\ s & \in \mathbb R^{n\times 1}. \end{align}  There are no restrictions on the parameters α , T , s other than that they correspond to a probability distribution. 3 There is no straightforward way to ascertain if a particular set of parameters form such a distribution. 4 The dimension of the matrix T is the order of the matrix-exponential representation. 5  The distribution is a generalisation of the phase type distribution .  Moments  If X has a matrix-exponential distribution then the k th moment is given by 6        𝔼   (   X  k   )    =     (   -  1   )    k  +  1     k  !   α   T   -   (   k  +  1   )     𝐬    .        𝔼   superscript  X  k       superscript    1     k  1      k   α   superscript  T      k  1     𝐬     \mathbb{E}(X^{k})=(-1)^{k+1}k!\mathbf{\alpha}T^{-(k+1)}\mathbf{s}.     Fitting  Matrix exponential distributions can be fitted using maximum likelihood estimation . 7  Software   BuTools a MATLAB and Mathematica script for fitting matrix-exponential distributions to three specified moments.
