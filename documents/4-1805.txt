   BIBO stability      BIBO stability   In signal processing , specifically control theory , bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stability is a form of stability for linear  signals and systems that take inputs. If a system is BIBO stable, then the output will be bounded for every input to the system that is bounded.  A signal is bounded if there is a finite value    B  >  0      B  0    B>0   such that the signal magnitude never exceeds   B   B   B   , that is        |   y   [  n  ]    |   ≤  B     ∀  n   ∈  ℤ      formulae-sequence        y   delimited-[]  n     B      for-all  n   ℤ     \ |y[n]|\leq B\quad\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}   for discrete-time signals, or        |   y   (  t  )    |   ≤  B     ∀  t   ∈  ℝ      formulae-sequence        y  t    B      for-all  t   ℝ     \ |y(t)|\leq B\quad\forall t\in\mathbb{R}   for continuous-time signals.  Time-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems  Continuous-time necessary and sufficient condition  For a continuous time  linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the condition for BIBO stability is that the impulse response be absolutely integrable , i.e., its L 1 norm exists.        ∫   -  ∞   ∞     |   h   (  t  )    |   d  t    =    ∥  h  ∥   1   <  ∞          superscript   subscript                h  t    normal-d  t     subscript   norm  h   1            \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|h(t)\right|\,\mathord{\operatorname{d}}t=\|h\|_{1%

Then it follows by the definition of convolution        y    [  n  ]    =    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    h   [  k  ]   x   [   n  -  k   ]           y   delimited-[]  n      superscript   subscript     k            h   delimited-[]  k   x   delimited-[]    n  k        \ y[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}h[k]x[n-k]     Let     ∥  x  ∥   ∞     subscript   norm  x      \|x\|_{\infty}   be the maximum value of    |   x   [  n  ]    |        x   delimited-[]  n      \ |x[n]|   , i.e., the     L  ∞     subscript  L     L_{\infty}   -norm .       |   y   [  n  ]    |   =   |    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    h   [   n  -  k   ]   x   [  k  ]     |           y   delimited-[]  n         superscript   subscript     k            h   delimited-[]    n  k    x   delimited-[]  k        \left|y[n]\right|=\left|\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}h[n-k]x[k]\right|            ≤    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞     |   h   [   n  -  k   ]    |    |   x   [  k  ]    |         absent    superscript   subscript     k                h   delimited-[]    n  k          x   delimited-[]  k         \leq\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|h[n-k]\right|\left|x[k]\right|   (by the triangle inequality )          ≤     ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞      |   h   [   n  -  k   ]    |     ∥  x  ∥   ∞         absent    superscript   subscript     k                h   delimited-[]    n  k       subscript   norm  x         \displaystyle\leq\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|h[n-k]\right|\|x\|_{\infty}     If    h   [  n  ]       h   delimited-[]  n     h[n]   is absolutely summable, then      ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    |   h   [  k  ]    |    =    ∥  h  ∥   1   <  ∞          superscript   subscript     k              h   delimited-[]  k       subscript   norm  h   1            \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{\left|h[k]\right|}=\|h\|_{1}<\infty   and         ∥  x  ∥   ∞     ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    |   h   [  k  ]    |     =     ∥  x  ∥   ∞     ∥  h  ∥   1           subscript   norm  x       superscript   subscript     k              h   delimited-[]  k          subscript   norm  x      subscript   norm  h   1      \|x\|_{\infty}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|h[k]\right|=\|x\|_{\infty}\|h\|_{1}     So if    h   [  n  ]       h   delimited-[]  n     h[n]   is absolutely summable and    |   x   [  n  ]    |        x   delimited-[]  n      \left|x[n]\right|   is bounded, then    |   y   [  n  ]    |        y   delimited-[]  n      \left|y[n]\right|   is bounded as well because       ∥  x  ∥   ∞     ∥  h  ∥   1    <  ∞         subscript   norm  x      subscript   norm  h   1       \|x\|_{\infty}\|h\|_{1}<\infty   .  The proof for continuous-time follows the same arguments.  Frequency-domain condition for linear time-invariant systems  Continuous-time signals  For a rational and continuous-time system , the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the Laplace transform includes the imaginary axis . When the system is causal , the ROC is the open region to the right of a vertical line whose abscissa is the real part of the "largest pole", or the pole that has the greatest real part of any pole in the system. The real part of the largest pole defining the ROC is called the abscissa of convergence . Therefore, all poles of the system must be in the strict left half of the s-plane for BIBO stability.  This stability condition can be derived from the above time-domain condition as follows:        ∫   -  ∞   ∞      |   h   (  t  )    |   dt       superscript   subscript                h  t    dt     \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|h(t)\right|\,\operatorname{dt}     where    s  =   σ  +   j  ω        s    σ    j  ω      s=\sigma+j\omega   and     Re   (  s  )    =  σ  =  0         Re  s   σ       0     \operatorname{Re}(s)=\sigma=0   .  The region of convergence must therefore include the imaginary axis .  Discrete-time signals  For a rational and discrete time system , the condition for stability is that the region of convergence (ROC) of the z-transform includes the unit circle . When the system is causal , the ROC is the open region outside a circle whose radius is the magnitude of the pole with largest magnitude. Therefore, all poles of the system must be inside the unit circle in the z-plane for BIBO stability.  This stability condition can be derived in a similar fashion to the continuous-time derivation:        ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     |   h   [  n  ]    |       superscript   subscript     n              h   delimited-[]  n       \displaystyle\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|h[n]\right|     where    z  =   r   e   j  ω         z    r   superscript  e    j  ω       z=re^{j\omega}   and    r  =   |  z  |   =  1        r    z        1     r=|z|=1   .  The region of convergence must therefore include the unit circle .
