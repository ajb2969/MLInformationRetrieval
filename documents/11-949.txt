Maltose O-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a maltose O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + maltose 
 
 
 
  CoA + 6-O-acetyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-D-glucose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and maltose, whereas its two products are CoA and 6-O-acetyl-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1->4)-D-glucose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:maltose O-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include maltose transacetylase, maltose O-acetyltransferase, and MAT.
Structural studies
