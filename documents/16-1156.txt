   Augmentation (algebra)      Augmentation (algebra)   In algebra, an augmentation of an associative algebra  A over a field  k is an algebra homomorphism     A  →  k     normal-→  A  k    A\to k   , typically denoted by ε. An algebra together with an augmentation is called an augmented algebra .  For example, if    A  =   k   [  G  ]        A    k   delimited-[]  G      A=k[G]   is the group algebra of a group G , then       A  →  k   ,    ∑    a  i    x  i     ↦   ∑   a  i        formulae-sequence   normal-→  A  k    maps-to       subscript  a  i    subscript  x  i        subscript  a  i       A\to k,\,\sum a_{i}x_{i}\mapsto\sum a_{i}   is an augmentation. The kernel is called the augmentation ideal of A .  References     "  Category:Algebras
