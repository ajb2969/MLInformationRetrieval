Augmentation (algebra)

In algebra, an augmentation of an associative algebra A over a field k is an algebra homomorphism

 
 , typically denoted by Îµ. An algebra together with an augmentation is called an augmented algebra.
For example, if 
 
 
 
  is the group algebra of a group G, then


 
  is an augmentation. The kernel is called the augmentation ideal of A.
