Shelling (topology)

In mathematics, a shelling of a simplicial complex is a way of gluing it together from its maximal simplices (simplices that are not a face of another simplex) in a well-behaved way. A complex admitting a shelling is called shellable.
Definition
A d-dimensional simplicial complex is called pure if its maximal simplices all have dimension d. Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite or countably infinite simplicial complex. An ordering 
 
 
 
  of the maximal simplices of 
 
 
 
  is a shelling if the complex 
 
 
 
 
  is pure and 
 
 
 
 -dimensional for all 
 
 
 
 . That is, the "new" simplex 
 
 
 
  meets the previous simplices along some union 
 
 
 
  of top-dimensional simplices of the boundary of 
 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the entire boundary of 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is called spanning.
For 
 
 
 
  not necessarily countable, one can define a shelling as a well-ordering of the maximal simplices of 
 
 
 
 
  having analogous properties.
Properties

A shellable complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres, one for each spanning simplex and of corresponding dimension.
A shellable complex may admit many different shellings, but the number of spanning simplices, and their dimensions, do not depend on the choice of shelling. This follows from the previous property.

Examples

Every Coxeter complex, and more generally every building, is shellable.1


There is an unshellable triangulation of the tetrahedron.2
