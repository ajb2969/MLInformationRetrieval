   Shelling (topology)      Shelling (topology)   In mathematics , a shelling of a simplicial complex is a way of gluing it together from its maximal simplices (simplices that are not a face of another simplex) in a well-behaved way. A complex admitting a shelling is called shellable .  Definition  A d -dimensional simplicial complex is called pure if its maximal simplices all have dimension d . Let   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   be a finite or countably infinite simplicial complex. An ordering     C  1   ,   C  2   ,  …      subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2   normal-…    C_{1},C_{2},\ldots   of the maximal simplices of   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is a shelling if the complex     B  k   :=    (    ⋃   i  =  1    k  -  1     C  i    )   ∩   C  k       assign   subscript  B  k       superscript   subscript     i  1      k  1     subscript  C  i     subscript  C  k      B_{k}:=\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k-1}C_{i}\right)\cap C_{k}   is pure and    (    dim   C  k    -  1   )       dimension   subscript  C  k    1    (\dim C_{k}-1)   -dimensional for all    k  =   2  ,  3  ,  …       k   2  3  normal-…     k=2,3,\ldots   . That is, the "new" simplex    C  k     subscript  C  k    C_{k}   meets the previous simplices along some union    B  k     subscript  B  k    B_{k}   of top-dimensional simplices of the boundary of    C  k     subscript  C  k    C_{k}   . If    B  k     subscript  B  k    B_{k}   is the entire boundary of    C  k     subscript  C  k    C_{k}   then    C  k     subscript  C  k    C_{k}   is called spanning .  For   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   not necessarily countable, one can define a shelling as a well-ordering of the maximal simplices of   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   having analogous properties.  Properties   A shellable complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres , one for each spanning simplex and of corresponding dimension.  A shellable complex may admit many different shellings, but the number of spanning simplices, and their dimensions, do not depend on the choice of shelling. This follows from the previous property.   Examples   Every Coxeter complex , and more generally every building , is shellable. 1    There is an unshellable triangulation of the tetrahedron . 2   References     "  Category:Topology  Category:Algebraic topology     ↩  ↩
