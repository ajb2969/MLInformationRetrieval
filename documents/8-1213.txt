   Modal companion      Modal companion   In logic , a modal companion of a superintuitionistic (intermediate) logic L is a normal  modal logic which interprets L by a certain canonical translation, described below. Modal companions share various properties of the original intermediate logic , which enables to study intermediate logics using tools developed for modal logic.  Gödel–McKinsey–Tarski translation  Let A be a propositional  intuitionistic formula. A modal formula T ( A ) is defined by induction on the complexity of A :       T   (  p  )    =   □  p         T  p     normal-□  p     T(p)=\Box p   for any propositional variable    p   p   p   ,        T   (  ⊥  )    =  ⊥   ,        T  bottom   bottom    T(\bot)=\bot,           T   (   A  ∧  B   )    =    T   (  A  )    ∧   T   (  B  )      ,        T    A  B        T  A     T  B      T(A\land B)=T(A)\land T(B),           T   (   A  ∨  B   )    =    T   (  A  )    ∨   T   (  B  )      ,        T    A  B        T  A     T  B      T(A\lor B)=T(A)\lor T(B),         T   (  A  →  B  )   =  □   (  T   (  A  )   →  T   (  B  )   )   .     fragments  T   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)    □   fragments  normal-(  T   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)   normal-→  T   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)   normal-)   normal-.    T(A\to B)=\Box(T(A)\to T(B)).   As negation is in intuitionistic logic defined by    A  →  ⊥     normal-→  A  bottom    A\to\bot   , we also have        T   (   ¬  A   )    =   □  ¬  T   (  A  )     .        T     A      normal-□   T  A     T(\neg A)=\Box\neg T(A).    T is called the Gödel translation or Gödel – McKinsey – Tarski translation . The translation is sometimes presented in slightly different ways: for example, one may insert   □   normal-□   \Box   before every subformula. All such variants are provably equivalent in S4 .  Modal companions  For any normal modal logic M which extends S4 , we define its si-fragment ρ M as        ρ  M   =   {  A  ∣   M  ⊢   T   (  A  )     }    .        ρ  M    conditional-set  A   proves  M    T  A       \rho M=\{A\mid M\vdash T(A)\}.   The si-fragment of any normal extension of S4 is a superintuitionistic logic. A modal logic M is a modal companion of a superintuitionistic logic L if    L  =   ρ  M       L    ρ  M     L=\rho M   .  Every superintuitionistic logic has modal companions. The smallest modal companion of L is        τ  L   =   𝐒𝟒  ⊕   {   T   (  A  )    ∣   L  ⊢  A   }     ,        τ  L    direct-sum  𝐒𝟒   conditional-set    T  A    proves  L  A       \tau L=\mathbf{S4}\oplus\{T(A)\mid L\vdash A\},   where   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   denotes normal closure. It can be shown that every superintuitionistic logic also has the largest modal companion , which is denoted by σ L . A modal logic M is a companion of L if and only if     τ  L   ⊆  M  ⊆   σ  L           τ  L   M         σ  L      \tau L\subseteq M\subseteq\sigma L   .  For example, S4 itself is the smallest modal companion of the intuitionistic logic ( IPC ). The largest modal companion of IPC is the Grzegorczyk logic Grz , axiomatized by the axiom      □   (  □   (  A  →  □  A  )   →  A  )   →  A     fragments  □   fragments  normal-(  □   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  □  A  normal-)   normal-→  A  normal-)   normal-→  A    \Box(\Box(A\to\Box A)\to A)\to A   over K . The smallest modal companion of the classical logic ( CPC ) is Lewis' S5 , whereas its largest modal companion is the logic      𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐯  =  𝐊  ⊕   (  A  ↔  □  A  )   .     fragments  Triv   K  direct-sum   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-↔  □  A  normal-)   normal-.    \mathbf{Triv}=\mathbf{K}\oplus(A\leftrightarrow\Box A).

CPC   S5   Triv   see below       Blok–Esakia isomorphism  The set of extensions of a superintuitionistic logic L ordered by inclusion forms a complete lattice , denoted Ext L . Similarly, the set of normal extensions of a modal logic M is a complete lattice NExt M . The companion operators ρ M , τ L , and σ L can be considered as mappings between the lattices Ext IPC and NExt S4 :       ρ  :     NExt   𝐒𝟒   →    Ext   𝐈𝐏𝐂     ,     normal-:  ρ   normal-→    NExt  𝐒𝟒     Ext  𝐈𝐏𝐂      \rho\colon\mathrm{NExt}\,\mathbf{S4}\to\mathrm{Ext}\,\mathbf{IPC},           τ  ,  σ   :     Ext   𝐈𝐏𝐂   →    NExt   𝐒𝟒     .     normal-:   τ  σ    normal-→    Ext  𝐈𝐏𝐂     NExt  𝐒𝟒      \tau,\sigma\colon\mathrm{Ext}\,\mathbf{IPC}\to\mathrm{NExt}\,\mathbf{S4}.   It is easy to see that all three are monotone , and     ρ  ∘  τ   =   ρ  ∘  σ         ρ  τ     ρ  σ     \rho\circ\tau=\rho\circ\sigma   is the identity function on Ext IPC . L. Maksimova and V. Rybakov have shown that ρ, τ, and σ are actually complete lattice homomorphisms . The cornerstone of the theory of modal companions is the Blok–Esakia theorem , proved independently by Wim Blok and Leo Esakia . It states   The mappings ρ and σ are mutually inverse lattice isomorphisms of Ext IPC  and NExt Grz .   Accordingly, σ and the restriction of ρ to NExt Grz are called the Blok–Esakia isomorphism . An important corollary to the Blok–Esakia theorem is a simple syntactic description of largest modal companions: for every superintuitionistic logic L ,        σ  L   =    τ  L   +  𝐆𝐫𝐳    .        σ  L       τ  L   𝐆𝐫𝐳     \sigma L=\tau L+\mathbf{Grz}.     Semantic description  The Gödel translation has a frame-theoretic counterpart. Let    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   be a transitive and reflexive modal general frame . The preorder  R induces the equivalence relation       x  ∼  y   ⇔     x    R   y   ∧    y    R   x       iff   similar-to  x  y       x  R  y     y  R  x      x\sim y\iff x\,R\,y\land y\,R\,x     on F , which identifies points belonging to the same cluster. Let     ⟨  ρ  F  ,  ≤  ⟩   =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ⟩   /  ∼     fragments   fragments  normal-⟨  ρ  F  normal-,   normal-⟩     fragments  normal-⟨  F  normal-,  R  normal-⟩    similar-to    \langle\rho F,\leq\rangle=\langle F,R\rangle/{\sim}   be the induced quotient  partial order (i.e., ρ F is the set of equivalence classes of   ∼   similar-to   \sim   ), and put      ρ  V  =   {  A  /  ∼  ∣  A  ∈  V  ,  A  =  □  A  }   .     fragments  ρ  V    fragments  normal-{  A   similar-to  normal-∣  A   V  normal-,  A   □  A  normal-}   normal-.    \rho V=\{A/{\sim}\mid A\in V,A=\Box A\}.   Then     ρ  𝐅   =   ⟨   ρ  F   ,  ≤  ,   ρ  V   ⟩         ρ  𝐅      ρ  F      ρ  V      \rho\mathbf{F}=\langle\rho F,\leq,\rho V\rangle   is an intuitionistic general frame, called the skeleton of F . The point of the skeleton construction is that it preserves validity modulo Gödel translation: for any intuitionistic formula A ,   A is valid in ρ F if and only if T ( A ) is valid in F .   Therefore the si-fragment of a modal logic M can be defined semantically: if M is complete with respect to a class C of transitive reflexive general frames, then ρ M is complete with respect to the class    {     ρ  𝐅   ;  𝐅   ∈  C   }          ρ  𝐅   𝐅   C     \{\rho\mathbf{F};\,\mathbf{F}\in C\}   .  The largest modal companions also have a semantic description. For any intuitionistic general frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  ≤  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F   V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,\leq,V\rangle   , let σ V be the closure of V under Boolean operations (binary intersection and complement ). It can be shown that σ V is closed under   □   normal-□   \Box   , thus     σ  𝐅   =   ⟨  F  ,  ≤  ,   σ  V   ⟩         σ  𝐅    F     σ  V      \sigma\mathbf{F}=\langle F,\leq,\sigma V\rangle   is a general modal frame. The skeleton of σ F is isomorphic to F . If L is a superintuitionistic logic complete with respect to a class C of general frames, then its largest modal companion σ L is complete with respect to    {     σ  𝐅   ;  𝐅   ∈  C   }          σ  𝐅   𝐅   C     \{\sigma\mathbf{F};\,\mathbf{F}\in C\}   .  The skeleton of a Kripke frame is itself a Kripke frame. On the other hand, σ F is never a Kripke frame if F is a Kripke frame of infinite depth.  Preservation theorems  The value of modal companions and the Blok–Esakia theorem as a tool for investigation of intermediate logics comes from the fact that many interesting properties of logics are preserved by some or all of the mappings ρ, σ, and τ. For example,   decidability is preserved by ρ, τ, and σ,  finite model property is preserved by ρ, τ, and σ,  tabularity is preserved by ρ and σ,  Kripke completeness is preserved by ρ and τ,  first-order definability on Kripke frames is preserved by ρ and τ.   Other properties  Every intermediate logic L has an infinite number of modal companions, and moreover, the set     ρ   -  1     (  L  )        superscript  ρ    1    L    \rho^{-1}(L)   of modal companions of L contains an infinite descending chain . For example,     ρ   -  1     (  𝐂𝐏𝐂  )        superscript  ρ    1    𝐂𝐏𝐂    \rho^{-1}(\mathbf{CPC})   consists of S5 , and the logics    L   (   C  n   )       L   subscript  C  n     L(C_{n})   for every positive integer n , where    C  n     subscript  C  n    C_{n}   is the n -element cluster. The set of modal companions of any L is either countable , or it has the cardinality of the continuum . Rybakov has shown that the lattice Ext L can be embedded in     ρ   -  1     (  L  )        superscript  ρ    1    L    \rho^{-1}(L)   ; in particular, a logic has a continuum of modal companions if it has a continuum of extensions (this holds, for instance, for all intermediate logics below KC ). It is unknown whether the converse is also true.  The Gödel translation can be applied to rules as well as formulas: the translation of a rule      R  =     A  1   ,  …  ,   A  n    B       R      subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  n    B     R=\frac{A_{1},\dots,A_{n}}{B}   is the rule        T   (  R  )    =     T   (   A  1   )    ,  …  ,   T   (   A  n   )      T   (  B  )      .        T  R        T   subscript  A  1    normal-…    T   subscript  A  n       T  B      T(R)=\frac{T(A_{1}),\dots,T(A_{n})}{T(B)}.   A rule R is admissible in a logic L if the set of theorems of L is closed under R . It is easy to see that R is admissible in a superintuitionistic logic L whenever T ( R ) is admissible in a modal companion of L . The converse is not true in general, but it holds for the largest modal companion of L .
