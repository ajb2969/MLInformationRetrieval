Subtract with carry

Subtract with carry is a pseudorandom number generator of the lagged Fibonacci type introduced by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman in 1991.1 It is one of three random number generator engines included in the standard C++11 library.
Subtract with carry generates a sequence of numbers using the recurrence relation:



where 
 
 
 
  has the value 1 if 
 
 
 
 , otherwise 
 
 
 
 . R and S are constants known as the long and short lags.2
