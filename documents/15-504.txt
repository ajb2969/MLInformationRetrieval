Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation

In fluid dynamics, the Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation (BBO equation) describes the motion of – and forces on – a small particle in unsteady flow at low Reynolds numbers. The equation is named after Joseph Valentin Boussinesq, Alfred Barnard Basset and Carl Wilhelm Oseen.
Formulation
One formulation of the BBO equation is the one given by , for a spherical particle of diameter 
 
 
 
 , position 
 
 
 
  and mean density

 
  moving with particle velocity 
 
 
 
  – in a fluid of density 
 
 
 
 , dynamic viscosity

 
  and with ambient (undisturbed local) flow velocity

This is Newton's second law, with in the left-hand side the particle's rate of change of linear momentum, and on the right-hand side the forces acting on the particle. The terms on the right-hand side are respectively due to the:2

Stokes' drag,
pressure gradient, with 
 
 
 
  the gradient operator,
added mass,
Basset force and
other forces on the particle, such as due to gravity, etc.

The particle Reynolds number 
 
 




has to be small, 
 
 
 
 , for the BBO equation to give an adequate representation of the forces on the particle.3
Also  suggest to estimate the pressure gradient from the Navier–Stokes equations:

  is the fluid velocity field, while in the BBO equation 
 
 
 
  is the undisturbed fluid velocity at the particle position
