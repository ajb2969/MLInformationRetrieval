   Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation      Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation   In fluid dynamics , the Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation ( BBO equation ) describes the motion of – and forces on – a small particle in unsteady flow at low Reynolds numbers . The equation is named after Joseph Valentin Boussinesq , Alfred Barnard Basset and Carl Wilhelm Oseen .  Formulation  One formulation of the BBO equation is the one given by , for a spherical particle of diameter    d  p     subscript  d  p    d_{p}   , position    𝒙  =    𝑿  p    (  t  )        𝒙     subscript  𝑿  p   t     \boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{X}_{p}(t)   and mean density     ρ  p     subscript  ρ  p    \rho_{p}   moving with particle velocity     𝑼  p   =     d   𝑿  p    /  d   t        subscript  𝑼  p         d   subscript  𝑿  p    d   t     \boldsymbol{U}_{p}=\text{d}\boldsymbol{X}_{p}/\text{d}t   – in a fluid of density    ρ  f     subscript  ρ  f    \rho_{f}   , dynamic viscosity    μ   μ   \mu   and with ambient (undisturbed local) flow velocity      𝑼  f   :      normal-:   subscript  𝑼  f   absent    \boldsymbol{U}_{f}:    1        π  6     ρ  p    d  p  3      d   𝑼  p     d  t           π  6    subscript  ρ  p    superscript   subscript  d  p   3       d   subscript  𝑼  p      d  t      \displaystyle\frac{\pi}{6}\rho_{p}d_{p}^{3}\frac{\text{d}\boldsymbol{U}_{p}}{%
 \text{d}t}     This is Newton's second law , with in the left-hand side the particle's rate of change of linear momentum , and on the right-hand side the forces acting on the particle. The terms on the right-hand side are respectively due to the: 2   Stokes' drag ,  pressure gradient , with   ∇   bold-∇   \boldsymbol{\nabla}   the gradient operator,  added mass ,  Basset force and  other forces on the particle, such as due to gravity , etc.   The particle Reynolds number     R  e   :      normal-:   subscript  R  e   absent    R_{e}:          R  e   =     max   {   |    𝑼  p   -   𝑼  f    |   }     d  p     μ  /   ρ  f          subscript  R  e              subscript  𝑼  p    subscript  𝑼  f       subscript  d  p      μ   subscript  ρ  f       R_{e}=\frac{\max\left\{\left|\boldsymbol{U}_{p}-\boldsymbol{U}_{f}\right|%
 \right\}\,d_{p}}{\mu/\rho_{f}}     has to be small,     R  e   <  1       subscript  R  e   1    R_{e}<1   , for the BBO equation to give an adequate representation of the forces on the particle. 3  Also  suggest to estimate the pressure gradient from the Navier–Stokes equations :        -   ∇  p    =     ρ  f     D   𝒖  f     D  t     -    μ  ∇   ⋅   ∇   𝒖  f       ,         bold-∇  p         subscript  ρ  f       D   subscript  𝒖  f      D  t      normal-⋅    μ  bold-∇    bold-∇   subscript  𝒖  f        -\boldsymbol{\nabla}p=\rho_{f}\frac{\text{D}\boldsymbol{u}_{f}}{\text{D}t}-\mu%

Note that in the Navier–Stokes equations     𝒖  f    (  𝒙  ,  t  )        subscript  𝒖  f    𝒙  t     \boldsymbol{u}_{f}(\boldsymbol{x},t)   is the fluid velocity field, while in the BBO equation    𝑼  f     subscript  𝑼  f    \boldsymbol{U}_{f}   is the undisturbed fluid velocity at the particle position       𝑼  f    (  t  )    =    𝒖  f    (    𝑿  p    (  t  )    ,  t  )     .         subscript  𝑼  f   t      subscript  𝒖  f       subscript  𝑿  p   t   t      \boldsymbol{U}_{f}(t)=\boldsymbol{u}_{f}(\boldsymbol{X}_{p}(t),t).
