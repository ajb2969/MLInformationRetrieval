   Eyring equation      Eyring equation   The Eyring equation (occasionally also known as Eyring–Polanyi equation ) is an equation used in chemical kinetics to describe the variance of the rate of a chemical reaction with temperature . It was developed almost simultaneously in 1935 by Henry Eyring , Meredith Gwynne Evans and Michael Polanyi . This equation follows from the transition state theory ( aka , activated-complex theory) and is trivially equivalent to the empirical  Arrhenius equation which are both readily derived from statistical thermodynamics in the kinetic theory of gases . 1  General form  The general form of the Eyring–Polanyi equation somewhat resembles the Arrhenius equation :       k   =      k  B   T   h    e   -    Δ   G   \Dagger      R  T           k         subscript  k  normal-B   T   h    superscript  normal-e        normal-Δ   superscript  G  \Dagger      R  T         \ k=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{h}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\Delta G^{\Dagger}}{RT}}     where Δ G ‡ is the Gibbs energy of activation, k B is Boltzmann's constant , and h is Planck's constant .  It can be rewritten as:      k  =      k  B   T   h    e    Δ   S  ‡    R     e   -    Δ   H  ‡     R  T           k         subscript  k  normal-B   T   h    superscript  normal-e      normal-Δ   superscript  S  normal-‡    R     superscript  normal-e        normal-Δ   superscript  H  normal-‡      R  T         k=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{h}\mathrm{e}^{\frac{\Delta S^{\ddagger}}{R}}\mathrm{e%
 }^{-\frac{\Delta H^{\ddagger}}{RT}}     To find the linear form of the Eyring-Polanyi equation:       ln   k  T    =      -   Δ   H  ‡     R   ⋅   1  T    +   ln    k  B   h    +    Δ   S  ‡    R            k  T       normal-⋅        normal-Δ   superscript  H  normal-‡     R     1  T         subscript  k  normal-B   h        normal-Δ   superscript  S  normal-‡    R      \ln\frac{k}{T}=\frac{-\Delta H^{\ddagger}}{R}\cdot\frac{1}{T}+\ln\frac{k_{%
 \mathrm{B}}}{h}+\frac{\Delta S^{\ddagger}}{R}     where:       k    k   \ k   = reaction rate constant      T    T   \ T   = absolute temperature       Δ    H  ‡       normal-Δ   superscript  H  normal-‡     \ \Delta H^{\ddagger}   = enthalpy of activation      R    R   \ R   = gas constant       k   B     subscript  k  normal-B    \ k_{\mathrm{B}}   = Boltzmann constant      h    h   \ h   = Planck's constant       Δ    S  ‡       normal-Δ   superscript  S  normal-‡     \ \Delta S^{\ddagger}   = entropy of activation   A certain chemical reaction is performed at different temperatures and the reaction rate is determined. The plot of     ln    (   k  /  T   )         k  T     \ \ln(k/T)   versus    1  /  T      1  T    \ 1/T   gives a straight line with slope    -    Δ   H  ‡    /  R           normal-Δ   superscript  H  normal-‡    R     \ -\Delta H^{\ddagger}/R   from which the enthalpy of activation can be derived and with intercept      ln    (    k  B   /  h   )    +    Δ   S  ‡    /  R            subscript  k  normal-B   h        normal-Δ   superscript  S  normal-‡    R     \ \ln(k_{\mathrm{B}}/h)+\Delta S^{\ddagger}/R   from which the entropy of activation is derived.  Accuracy  Transition state theory requires a value of a certain transmission coefficient , called    κ    κ   \ \kappa   in that theory, as an additional prefactor in the Eyring equation above. This value is usually taken to be unity (i.e., the transition state     A    B  ‡       A   superscript  B  normal-‡     \ AB^{\ddagger}   always proceeds to products     A   B      A  B    \ AB   and never reverts to reactants    A    A   \ A   and    B    B   \ B   ), and we have followed this convention above. Alternatively, to avoid specifying a value of    κ    κ   \ \kappa   , the ratios of rate constants can be compared to the value of a rate constant at some fixed reference temperature (i.e.,       k    (  T  )    /  k    (   T   R  e  f    )           k  T   k    subscript  T    R  e  f      \ k(T)/k(T_{Ref})   ) which eliminates the    κ    κ   \ \kappa   term in the resulting expression.
