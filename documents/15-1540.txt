All-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific)

All-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific) (, nonaprenyl diphosphate synthase, solanesyl diphosphate synthase, At-SPS2, At-SPS1, SPS1, SPS2) is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate transtransferase (adding 5 isopentenyl units).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranylgeranyl diphosphate + 5 isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  5 diphosphate + all-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate
 

Geranylgeranyl diphosphate is preferred over farnesyl diphosphate as allylic substrate.
