   Orthogonal complement      Orthogonal complement   In the mathematical fields of linear algebra and functional analysis , the orthogonal complement of a subspace  W of a vector space  V equipped with a bilinear form  B is the set W ⊥ of all vectors in V that are orthogonal to every vector in W . Informally, it is called the perp , short for perpendicular complement . It is a subspace of V .  General bilinear forms  Let   V   V   V   be a vector space over a field   F   F   F   equipped with a bilinear form    B   B   B   . We define   u   u   u   to be left-orthogonal to   v   v   v   , and   v   v   v   to be right-orthogonal to   u   u   u   , when     B   (  u  ,  v  )    =  0        B   u  v    0    B(u,v)=0   . For a subset   W   W   W   of   V   V   V   we define the left orthogonal complement    W  ⊥     superscript  W  bottom    W^{\bot}   to be        W  ⊥   =   {   x  ∈  V   :    B   (  x  ,  y  )    =   0  for all  y   ∈  W   }    .       superscript  W  bottom    conditional-set    x  V         B   x  y      0  for all  y        W       W^{\bot}=\left\{x\in V:B(x,y)=0\mbox{ for all }y\in W\right\}\,.     There is a corresponding definition of right orthogonal complement. For a reflexive bilinear form , where     B   (  u  ,  v  )    =  0        B   u  v    0    B(u,v)=0   implies     B   (  v  ,  u  )    =  0        B   v  u    0    B(v,u)=0   for all   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   in   V   V   V   , the left and right complements coincide. This will be the case if   B   B   B   is a symmetric or an alternating form .  The definition extends to a bilinear form on a free module over a commutative ring , and to a sesquilinear form extended to include any free module over a commutative ring with conjugation . 1  Properties   An orthogonal complement is a subspace of   V   V   V   ;  If then ;  The radical     V  ⊥     superscript  V  bottom    V^{\bot}   of   V   V   V   is a subspace of every orthogonal complement;      W  ⊂    (   W  ⊥   )   ⊥       W   superscript   superscript  W  bottom   bottom     W\subset(W^{\bot})^{\bot}   ;  If   B   B   B   is non-degenerate and   V   V   V   is finite-dimensional, then      dim   (  W  )    +   dim   (   W  ⊥   )     =   dim  V          dimension  W    dimension   superscript  W  bottom      dimension  V     \dim(W)+\dim(W^{\bot})=\dim V   .   Example  In special relativity the orthogonal complement is used to determine the simultaneous hyperplane at a point of a world line . The bilinear form η used in Minkowski space determines a pseudo-Euclidean space of events. The origin and all events on the light cone are self-orthogonal. When a time event and a space event evaluate to zero under the bilinear form, then they are hyperbolic-orthogonal . This terminology stems from the use of two conjugate hyperbolas in the pseudo-Euclidean plane: conjugate diameters of these hyperbolas are hyperbolic-orthogonal.  Inner product spaces  This section considers orthogonal complements in inner product spaces . 2  Properties  The orthogonal complement is always closed in the metric topology. In finite-dimensional spaces, that is merely an instance of the fact that all subspaces of a vector space are closed. In infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces , some subspaces are not closed, but all orthogonal complements are closed. In such spaces, the orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement of   W   W   W   is the closure of   W   W   W   , i.e.,        (   W  ⊥   )   ⊥   =   W  ¯        superscript   superscript  W  bottom   bottom    normal-¯  W     (W^{\bot})^{\bot}=\overline{W}   .  Some other useful properties that always hold are the following. Let   H   H   H   be a Hilbert space and let   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   be its linear subspaces. Then:        X  ⊥   =    X  ¯   ⊥        superscript  X  bottom    superscript   normal-¯  X   bottom     X^{\bot}=\overline{X}^{\bot}   ;  if    Y  ⊂  X      Y  X    Y\subset X   , then ;       X  ∩   X  ⊥    =   {  0  }         X   superscript  X  bottom     0     X\cap X^{\bot}=\{0\}   ;      X  ⊂    (   X  ⊥   )   ⊥       X   superscript   superscript  X  bottom   bottom     X\subset(X^{\bot})^{\bot}   ;  if   X   X   X   is a closed linear subspace of   H   H   H   , then ;  if   X   X   X   is a closed linear subspace of   H   H   H   , then , the (inner) direct sum .   The orthogonal complement generalizes to the annihilator , and gives a Galois connection on subsets of the inner product space, with associated closure operator the topological closure of the span.  Finite dimensions  For a finite-dimensional inner product space of dimension n , the orthogonal complement of a k -dimensional subspace is an -dimensional subspace, and the double orthogonal complement is the original subspace:   ( W ⊥ ) ⊥ = W .   If A is an  matrix, where , , and  refer to the row space , column space , and null space of A (respectively), we have   (Row A ) ⊥ = Null A   (Col A ) ⊥ = Null A T .   Banach spaces  There is a natural analog of this notion in general Banach spaces . In this case one defines the orthogonal complement of W to be a subspace of the dual of V defined similarly as the annihilator        W  ⊥   =   {   x  ∈   V  *    :     ∀  y   ∈  W   ,    x   (  y  )    =   0     }    .       superscript  W  bottom    conditional-set    x   superscript  V      formulae-sequence     for-all  y   W       x  y   0       W^{\bot}=\left\{\,x\in V^{*}:\forall y\in W,x(y)=0\,\right\}.\,     It is always a closed subspace of V ∗ . There is also an analog of the double complement property. W ⊥⊥ is now a subspace of V ∗∗ (which is not identical to V ). However, the reflexive spaces have a natural  isomorphism  i between V and V ∗∗ . In this case we have        i   W  ¯    =   W    ⊥  ⊥     .        i   normal-¯  W     superscript  W   bottom  absent  bottom      i\overline{W}=W^{\bot\,\bot}.     This is a rather straightforward consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem .
