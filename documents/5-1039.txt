   Direct comparison test      Direct comparison test   In mathematics , the comparison test , sometimes called the direct comparison test to distinguish it from similar related tests (especially the limit comparison test ), provides a way of deducing the convergence or divergence of an infinite series or an improper integral . In both cases, the test works by comparing the given series or integral to one whose convergence properties are known.  For series  In calculus , the comparison test for series typically consists of a pair of statements about infinite series with nonnegative ( real-valued ) terms: 1   If the infinite series    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   converges and    0  ≤   a  n   ≤   b  n         0   subscript  a  n         subscript  b  n      0\leq a_{n}\leq b_{n}   for all sufficiently large n (that is, for all    n  >  N      n  N    n>N   for some fixed value N ), then the infinite series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   also converges.  If the infinite series    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   diverges and    0  ≤   b  n   ≤   a  n         0   subscript  b  n         subscript  a  n      0\leq b_{n}\leq a_{n}   for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   also diverges.   Note that the series having larger terms is sometimes said to dominate (or eventually dominate ) the series with smaller terms. 2  Alternatively, the test may be stated in terms of absolute convergence , in which case it also applies to series with complex terms: 3   If the infinite series    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   is absolutely convergent and     |   a  n   |   ≤   |   b  n   |          subscript  a  n       subscript  b  n      |a_{n}|\leq|b_{n}|   for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   is also absolutely convergent.  If the infinite series    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   is not absolutely convergent and     |   b  n   |   ≤   |   a  n   |          subscript  b  n       subscript  a  n      |b_{n}|\leq|a_{n}|   for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   is also not absolutely convergent.   Note that in this last statement, the series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   could still be conditionally convergent ; for real-valued series, this could happen if the a n are not all nonnegative.  The second pair of statements are equivalent to the first in the case of real-valued series because    ∑   c  n        subscript  c  n     \sum c_{n}   converges absolutely if and only if    ∑   |   c  n   |          subscript  c  n      \sum|c_{n}|   , a series with nonnegative terms, converges.  Proof  The proofs of all the statements given above are similar. Here is a proof of the third statement.  Let    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   and    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   be infinite series such that    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   converges absolutely (thus    ∑   |   b  n   |          subscript  b  n      \sum|b_{n}|   converges), and without loss of generality assume that     |   a  n   |   ≤   |   b  n   |          subscript  a  n       subscript  b  n      |a_{n}|\leq|b_{n}|   for all positive integers n . Consider the partial sums         S  n   =    |   a  1   |   +   |   a  2   |   +  …  +   |   a  n   |     ,    T  n   =    |   b  1   |   +   |   b  2   |   +  …  +   |   b  n   |      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  S  n        subscript  a  1       subscript  a  2    normal-…     subscript  a  n         subscript  T  n        subscript  b  1       subscript  b  2    normal-…     subscript  b  n        S_{n}=|a_{1}|+|a_{2}|+\ldots+|a_{n}|,\ T_{n}=|b_{1}|+|b_{2}|+\ldots+|b_{n}|.   Since    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   converges absolutely,      lim   n  →  ∞     T  n    =  T        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  T  n    T    \lim_{n\to\infty}T_{n}=T   for some real number T . The sequence    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   is clearly nondecreasing, so     T  n   ≤  T       subscript  T  n   T    T_{n}\leq T   for all n . Thus for all n ,       0  ≤   S  n   =    |   a  1   |   +   |   a  2   |   +  …  +   |   a  n   |    ≤    |   b  1   |   +   |   b  2   |   +  …  +   |   b  n   |    ≤  T   .        0   subscript  S  n             subscript  a  1       subscript  a  2    normal-…     subscript  a  n               subscript  b  1       subscript  b  2    normal-…     subscript  b  n          T     0\leq S_{n}=|a_{1}|+|a_{2}|+\ldots+|a_{n}|\leq|b_{1}|+|b_{2}|+\ldots+|b_{n}|%
 \leq T.   This shows that    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   is a bounded monotonic sequence and so must converge to a limit. Therefore    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   is absolutely convergent.  For integrals  The comparison test for integrals may be stated as follows, assuming continuous real-valued functions f and g on    [  a  ,  b  )     a  b    [a,b)   with b either    +  ∞         +\infty   or a real number at which f and g each have a vertical asymptote: 4   If the improper integral     ∫  a  b    g   (  x  )   d  x       superscript   subscript   a   b     g  x  d  x     \int_{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx   converges and    0  ≤   f   (  x  )    ≤   g   (  x  )          0    f  x          g  x      0\leq f(x)\leq g(x)   for    a  ≤  x  <  b        a  x       b     a\leq x   , then the improper integral     ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x       superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx   also converges with       ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x    ≤    ∫  a  b    g   (  x  )   d  x     .        superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x      superscript   subscript   a   b     g  x  d  x      \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx\leq\int_{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx.     If the improper integral     ∫  a  b    g   (  x  )   d  x       superscript   subscript   a   b     g  x  d  x     \int_{a}^{b}g(x)\,dx   diverges and    0  ≤   g   (  x  )    ≤   f   (  x  )          0    g  x          f  x      0\leq g(x)\leq f(x)   for    a  ≤  x  <  b        a  x       b     a\leq x   , then the improper integral     ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x       superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx   also diverges.   Ratio comparison test  Another test for convergence of real-valued series, similar to both the direct comparison test above and the ratio test , is called the ratio comparison test : 5   If the infinite series    ∑   b  n        subscript  b  n     \sum b_{n}   converges and     a  n   >  0       subscript  a  n   0    a_{n}>0   ,     b  n   >  0       subscript  b  n   0    b_{n}>0   , and      a   n  +  1     a  n    ≤    b   n  +  1     b  n           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n       subscript  b    n  1     subscript  b  n      \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\leq\frac{b_{n+1}}{b_{n}}   for all sufficiently large n , then the infinite series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   also converges.
