(66063) 1998 RO1

(66063) 1998 RO1 is an Aten asteroid with a very eccentric orbit that was discovered September 14, 1998, by the LINEAR program.12 It is known to have a moon, S/2001 (66063) 1.
Interaction with Earth
1998 RO1's orbit is very eccentric, with an aphelion beyond the orbit of Mars and a perihelion inside the orbit of Mercury.3 It has an orbital period of 360.29 days (0.99 years) and makes close approaches to Earth.4 But 1998 RO1 makes closer approaches to other inner planets, especially Mars. Its closest approach to a planet between 1950–2200 was to Mars, as it passed  from Mars on March 19, 1964, and will pass  from Mars on October 12, 2065.5
Moon
 1998 RO1 has one moon, S/2001 (66063) 1.6 This moon was discovered from lightcurve observations going from September 13–28, 2013, and was confirmed by radar observations from the Arecibo Observatory one year later.78 It is in a very close orbit to 1998 RO1, with a semi-major axis of  and an eccentricity of 0.06,910 giving it a periapsis of  and an apoapsis of . S/2001 (66063) 1 takes 14.54 hours to complete one orbit around 1998 RO1.11 From the surface of 1998 RO1, S/2001 (66063) 1 would have an apparent diameter of roughly 41°.12 For comparison, the Sun appears to be 0.5° from Earth.
