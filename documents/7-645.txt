   Kynea number      Kynea number   A Kynea number is an integer of the form        4  n   +   2   n  +  1     -  1         superscript  4  n    superscript  2    n  1     1    4^{n}+2^{n+1}-1   .  An equivalent formula is        (    2  n   +  1   )   2   -  2       superscript     superscript  2  n   1   2   2    (2^{n}+1)^{2}-2   .  This indicates that a Kynea number is the n th power of 4 plus the ( n + 1)th Mersenne number . Kynea numbers were studied by Cletus Emmanuel who named them after a baby girl. 1  The sequence of Kynea numbers starts with:   7 , 23 , 79 , 287, 1087, 4223, 16639, 66047, 263167, 1050623, 4198399, 16785407, ... .   Properties  The binary representation of the n th Kynea number is a single leading one, followed by n - 1 consecutive zeroes, followed by n + 1 consecutive ones, or to put it algebraically:        4  n   +    ∑   i  =  0   n    2  i     .       superscript  4  n     superscript   subscript     i  0    n    superscript  2  i      4^{n}+\sum_{i=0}^{n}2^{i}.     So, for example, 23 is 10111 in binary, 79 is 1001111, etc. The difference between the n th Kynea number and the n th Carol number is the ( n + 2)th power of two .  Prime Kynea numbers      Kynea numbers     n     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     Starting with 7, every third Kynea number is a multiple of 7. Thus, for a Kynea number to be a prime number , its index n can not be of the form 3 x + 1 for x > 0. The first few Kynea numbers that are also prime are 7, 23, 79, 1087, 66047, 263167, 16785407 .  As of 2006, the largest known prime Kynea number has index n = 281621 and approximately equals 5.5×10 169552 . It was found by Cletus Emmanuel in November 2005, using k -Sieve from Phil Carmody and OpenPFGW. This is the 46th Kynea prime.
