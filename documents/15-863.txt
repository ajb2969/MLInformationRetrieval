Malonyl CoA reductase (malonate semialdehyde-forming)

Malonyl CoA reductase (malonate semialdehyde-forming) (, NADP-dependent malonyl CoA reductase, malonyl CoA reductase (NADP)) is an enzyme with system name malonate semialdehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (malonate semialdehyde-forming).1234 This enzyme catalyse the following chemical reaction

malonate semialdehyde + CoA + NADP+

 
  malonyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


Requires Mg2+. Catalyses the reduction of malonyl-CoA to malonate semialdehyde.
