   (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase      (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase   (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase (, BbsG , (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase ) is an enzyme with system name (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA:electron transfer flavoprotein oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (R)-2-benzylsuccinyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-2-benzylidenesuccinyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein    This enzyme requires FAD as prosthetic group .
