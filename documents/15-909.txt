(R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase

(R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase (, BbsG, (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA:electron transfer flavoprotein oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(R)-2-benzylsuccinyl-CoA + electron-transfer flavoprotein 
 
 
 
  (E)-2-benzylidenesuccinyl-CoA + reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein


This enzyme requires FAD as prosthetic group.
