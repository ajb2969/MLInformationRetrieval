Isotypic component

The Isotypic component of weight 
 
 
 
  of a Lie algebra module is the sum of all submodules which are isomorphic to the highest weight module with weight 
 
 
 
 .
Definition

A finite-dimensional module

 
  of a reductive Lie algebra

 
 
  (or of the corresponding Lie group) can be decomposed into irreducible submodules



 
 .

Each finite-dimensional irreducible representation of 
 
 
 
  is uniquely identified (up to isomorphism) by its highest weight



 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the highest weight module with highest weight 
 
 
 
 
 .

In the decomposition of 
 
 
 
 , a certain isomorphism class might appear more than once, hence



 
 .
This defines the isotypic component of weight 
 
 
 
  of V: 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is maximal.
