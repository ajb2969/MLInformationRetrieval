   Draft:Chow group      Draft:Chow group   The article mainly concerns a Chow group when it is not a Chow ring ; for example, it discusses the relation to homology ( Borel−Moore homology to be precise) instead of cohomology.  If X is a smooth algebraic variety of dimension d , then one sets        A  k    (  X  )    =    A   d  -  k     (  X  )           superscript  A  k   X      subscript  A    d  k    X     A^{k}(X)=A_{d-k}(X)   . The intersection product makes     ⊕  0  d     A  k    (  X  )        superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0   d      superscript  A  k   X     \oplus_{0}^{d}A^{k}(X)   a graded ring called the Chow ring of X .  Definition  Let X be an algebraic scheme , by which we mean a separated scheme of finite type over a field. Let     Z  k    (  X  )        subscript  Z  k   X    Z_{k}(X)   be the free abelian group generated by symbols [ V ] with closed subvarieties V of dimension k ; an element of the group is called a k -cycle on X . If W is a ( k +1)-dimensional subvariety of X , then each nonzero rational function f on W determines the k -cycle:       (  f  )   =    ∑   V  ⊂  W       ord  V    (  f  )     [  V  ]         f    subscript     V  W       subscript  ord  V   f   V      (f)=\sum_{V\subset W}\operatorname{ord}_{V}(f)[V]   where    ord  V     subscript  ord  V    \operatorname{ord}_{V}   is the order-of-vanishing function, just as in the definition of the principal Weil divisor . Next let      Rat  k    (  X  )    ⊂    Z  k    (  X  )          subscript  Rat  k   X      subscript  Z  k   X     \operatorname{Rat}_{k}(X)\subset Z_{k}(X)   be the subgroup generated by such cycles (with arbitary W ); thus explicitly, if x is in     Rat  k    (  X  )       subscript  Rat  k   X    \operatorname{Rat}_{k}(X)   , then it can be written as:      x  =   ∑   (   f  i   )        x     subscript  f  i      x=\sum(f_{i})   where    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   are nonzero rational functions on a ( k +1)-dimensional subvariety One then puts:         A  k    (  X  )    =     Z  k    (  X  )    /    Rat  k    (  X  )      ;         subscript  A  k   X        subscript  Z  k   X     subscript  Rat  k   X      A_{k}(X)=Z_{k}(X)/\operatorname{Rat}_{k}(X);   it is the k -th Chow group of X . Two k -cycles x , y on X are said to be rationally equivalent if they belong to the same class in     A  k    (  X  )        subscript  A  k   X    A_{k}(X)   and in such a case one writes    x  ∼  y     similar-to  x  y    x\sim y   .  Example : If X has pure dimension  k , then it determines the k -cycle       [  X  ]   =    ∑   V   \sub   X       length   𝒪  X     (   local ring at  V   )     [  V  ]          delimited-[]  X     subscript     V  \sub  X       subscript  length   subscript  𝒪  X      local ring at  V    V      [X]=\sum_{V\sub X}\operatorname{length}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}(\text{local ring at %
 }V)[V]   where V runs over all irreducible components of X . 1 It is called the fundamental class of X .  If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is a proper morphism between algebraic schemes, then define       f  *   :     Z  k    (  X  )    →    Z  k    (  Y  )        normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript  Z  k   X      subscript  Z  k   Y      f_{*}:Z_{k}(X)\to Z_{k}(Y)   by linearity and the requirement        f  *    [  V  ]    =    deg   (    f  |   V   )     [   f   (  V  )    ]           subscript  f     delimited-[]  V      deg   evaluated-at  f  V      f  V      f_{*}[V]=\operatorname{deg}(f|_{V})[f(V)]   where    deg   (    f  |   V   )      deg   evaluated-at  f  V     \operatorname{deg}(f|_{V})   is zero if the image    f   (  V  )       f  V    f(V)   has dimension smaller than that of V and is otherwise the degree of the finite field extension of the function field of V over the function field of f ( V ) (the degree of a finite morphism ). It turns out that the map respects a rational equivalence    x  ∼  y  ⇒    f  *    (  x  )    ∼    f  *    (  y  )         similar-to  x  y    normal-⇒       subscript  f    x     similar-to       subscript  f    y      x\sim y\Rightarrow f_{*}(x)\sim f_{*}(y)    2 and consequently it induces:        f  *   :     A  k    (  X  )    →    A  k    (  Y  )      .     normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript  A  k   X      subscript  A  k   Y      f_{*}:A_{k}(X)\to A_{k}(Y).   The upshot is that "    A  *     subscript  A     A_{*}   is a covariant functor from the category of algebraic schemes to the category of abelian groups."  Relation to Grothendieck groups of coherent sheaves  Let G ( X ) denote the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on an algebraic scheme X . It has a filtration     F  n   G   (  X  )   =   {   [  F  ]   |  dim  Supp  F  ≤  n  .  }      fragments   superscript  F  n   G   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-[  F  normal-]   normal-|  dimension  Supp  F   n  normal-.  normal-}     F^{n}G(X)=\{[F]|\dim\operatorname{Supp}F\leq n.\}   . With respect to this filtration one can form the associated graded group     gr  𝐆    (  X  )        gr  𝐆   X    \operatorname{gr}\mathbf{G}(X)   and then there is a natural transformation of (covariant) functors        A  *   →   gr  𝐆    ,    [  V  ]   ↦   [   𝒪  V   ]       formulae-sequence   normal-→   subscript  A     gr  𝐆     maps-to   delimited-[]  V    delimited-[]   subscript  𝒪  V       A_{*}\to\operatorname{gr}\mathbf{G},\,[V]\mapsto[\mathcal{O}_{V}]   which becomes an isomorphism after tensored with ℚ. 3 The fact suggests that one might develop the intersection theory with    𝒪  V     subscript  𝒪  V    \mathcal{O}_{V}   in place of V ; this is the starting point for Draft:Kleiman's intersection theory .  Basic properties  Let X be an algebraic scheme. ). |For any closed subscheme Z of X , there is the exact sequence:         A  k    (  Z  )    →    A  k    (  X  )    →    A  k    (   X  -  Z   )    →  0   ,       normal-→     subscript  A  k   Z      subscript  A  k   X     normal-→       subscript  A  k     X  Z      normal-→    0     A_{k}(Z)\to A_{k}(X)\to A_{k}(X-Z)\to 0,   which extends further to the left by means of " #higher Chow group ". |Let    i  :   Z  ↪  X      normal-:  i   normal-↪  Z  X     i:Z\hookrightarrow X   be a closed immersion and    p  :    X  ′   →  X      normal-:  p   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   X     p:X^{\prime}\to X   be a proper morphism such that    p  :     X  ′   -   Z  ′    →   X  -  Z       normal-:  p   normal-→     superscript  X  normal-′    superscript  Z  normal-′      X  Z      p:X^{\prime}-Z^{\prime}\to X-Z   is an isomorphism. Then there is the exact sequence:        A  k    (   Z  ′   )    →     A  k    (  Z  )    ⊕    A  k    (   X  ′   )     →    A  k    (  X  )    →  0       normal-→     subscript  A  k    superscript  Z  normal-′     direct-sum     subscript  A  k   Z      subscript  A  k    superscript  X  normal-′       normal-→       subscript  A  k   X     normal-→    0     A_{k}(Z^{\prime})\to A_{k}(Z)\oplus A_{k}(X^{\prime})\to A_{k}(X)\to 0   (as a special case, this gives the Mayer–Vietoris sequence .) |If    p  :   E  →  X      normal-:  p   normal-→  E  X     p:E\to X   is a vector bundle of rank r , then for all k       p  *   :     A   k  -  r     (  X  )    →    A  k    (  E  )        normal-:   superscript  p     normal-→     subscript  A    k  r    X      subscript  A  k   E      p^{*}:A_{k-r}(X)\to A_{k}(E)   is an isomorphism. |     i  t  *   :     A  k    (   X  ×   ℙ  1    )    →    A   k  -  1     (  X  )        normal-:   subscript   superscript  i    t    normal-→     subscript  A  k     X   superscript  ℙ  1        subscript  A    k  1    X      i^{*}_{t}:A_{k}(X\times\mathbb{P}^{1})\to A_{k-1}(X)   is independent of t .}} The last property is an instance of the " principle of continuity ":  Intersecting with Cartier divisors  Let X be an algebraic scheme. Then each Cartier divisor D on X and a k -dimensional closed subvariety V of X determines the class (the Weil divisor class)      D  ⋅  V     normal-⋅  D  V    D\cdot V   in     A   k  -  1     (    Supp   (  D  )    ∩  V   )        subscript  A    k  1       Supp  D   V     A_{k-1}(\operatorname{Supp}(D)\cap V)   as follows:   If    V  ⊄   Supp   (  D  )       not-subset-of  V   Supp  D     V\not\subset\operatorname{Supp}(D)   , then it is the Weil divisor class associated to the restriction of D to V (the Cartier divisor obtained by restricting the defining local equations to V .)  If    V  ⊂   Supp   (  D  )        V   Supp  D     V\subset\operatorname{Supp}(D)   , then it is the Weil divisor class of a Cartier divisor C on V such that      𝒪  V    (  C  )    ≃      𝒪  X    (  D  )    |   V      similar-to-or-equals     subscript  𝒪  V   C    evaluated-at     subscript  𝒪  X   D   V     \mathcal{O}_{V}(C)\simeq\mathcal{O}_{X}(D)|_{V}   .   By linearity, for any closed subscheme Y of X , the operation extends to the group homomorphism         Z  k    (  Y  )    →    A   k  -  1     (    Supp   (  D  )    ∩  Y   )     .     normal-→     subscript  Z  k   Y      subscript  A    k  1       Supp  D   Y      Z_{k}(Y)\to A_{k-1}(\operatorname{Supp}(D)\cap Y).   The image of a cycle x is denoted by    D  ⋅  x     normal-⋅  D  x    D\cdot x   and is called the intersection class of D and x . One can show that    x  ∼  0  ⇒   D  ⋅  x   =  0       similar-to  x  0    normal-⇒     normal-⋅  D  x        0     x\sim 0\Rightarrow D\cdot x=0   ; that is, the map induces      A  k    (  Y  )    →    A   k  -  1     (    Supp   (  D  )    ∩  Y   )       normal-→     subscript  A  k   Y      subscript  A    k  1       Supp  D   Y      A_{k}(Y)\to A_{k-1}(\operatorname{Supp}(D)\cap Y)   . As a special case, if D is an effective Cartier divisor on X (i.e., a closed subscheme of X ), then there is:         Z  k    (  X  )    →    A   k  -  1     (  D  )     ,   x  ↦   D  ⋅  x       formulae-sequence   normal-→     subscript  Z  k   X      subscript  A    k  1    D     maps-to  x   normal-⋅  D  x      Z_{k}(X)\to A_{k-1}(D),\,x\mapsto D\cdot x   which is called the Gysin homomorphism . One can show the associativity     D  ⋅   (    D  ′   ⋅  x   )    =    (   D  ⋅   D  ′    )   ⋅  X        normal-⋅  D   normal-⋅   superscript  D  normal-′   x     normal-⋅   normal-⋅  D   superscript  D  normal-′    X     D\cdot(D^{\prime}\cdot x)=(D\cdot D^{\prime})\cdot X   and thus the degree of     D  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   D  k   ⋅  x     normal-⋅   subscript  D  1   normal-…   subscript  D  k   x    D_{1}\cdot\dots\cdot D_{k}\cdot x   is an unambiguously determined integer called the intersection number , written as       (    D  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   D  k   ⋅  x   )   .     normal-⋅   subscript  D  1   normal-…   subscript  D  k   x    (D_{1}\cdot\dots\cdot D_{k}\cdot x).   If x is the fundamental class of X , then x is often dropped from the expression.  Cycle map  If X is (of finite type) over the field of complex numbers, there is a homomorphism      cl  :     A  *    (  X  )    →    H  *    (  X  )        normal-:  cl   normal-→     subscript  A    X     subscript  normal-H    X      \operatorname{cl}:A_{*}(X)\to\operatorname{H}_{*}(X)   .  The Chow group of a normal cone  Let    i  :   X  ↪  Y      normal-:  i   normal-↪  X  Y     i:X\hookrightarrow Y   be a closed immersion and C the associated normal cone    C  =   Spec   (    ⊕  0  ∞     I  n   /   I   n  +  1      )        C   Spec    superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0        superscript  I  n    superscript  I    n  1         C=\operatorname{Spec}(\oplus_{0}^{\infty}I^{n}/I^{n+1})   , which is the normal bundle to X if i is a regular embedding .  The Chow group of a toric variety  The bottom line: the smooth case is easy, the singular case is more difficult.  Relation to higher K -theory  The next theorem was introduced by Bloch, who also verified some cases.  For example,     Pic   (  X  )    =    H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  *   )    =    H  1    (  X  ,   𝒦  1   )    =    A   d  -  1     (  X  )           Pic  X     superscript  normal-H  1   X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X             superscript  normal-H  1   X   subscript  𝒦  1            subscript  A    d  1    X      \operatorname{Pic}(X)=\operatorname{H}^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*})=%
 \operatorname{H}^{1}(X,\mathcal{K}_{1})=A_{d-1}(X)   ,the last one being the divisor class group . (In particular, one expects some smoothness assumption is necessary for the truth of the theorem.)  The theorem suggests that one defines the Chow group of a singular variety X using the K -theory sheaf    𝒦  p     subscript  𝒦  p    \mathcal{K}_{p}   . (In fact, this is exactly what Gillet did.)
