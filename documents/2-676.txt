   Symplectic group      Symplectic group   In mathematics , the name symplectic group can refer to two different, but closely related, collections of mathematical groups , denoted    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   and    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   . The latter is sometimes called the compact symplectic group to distinguish it from the former. Many authors prefer slightly different notations, usually differing by factors of   2   2   2   . The notation used here is consistent with the size of the matrices used to represent the groups. In Cartan 's classification of the simple Lie algebras , the Lie algebra of the complex group    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})   is denoted , and    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is the compact real form of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})   . Note that when we refer to the (compact) symplectic group it is implied that we are talking about the collection of (compact) symplectic groups, indexed by their dimension   n   n   n   .  The name "symplectic group" is due to Hermann Weyl ( details ) as a replacement for the previous confusing names of ( line ) complex group and Abelian group , and is the Greek analog of "complex".      S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)     The symplectic group of degree    2  n      2  n    2n   over a field    F   F   F   , denoted    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   , is the group of    2  n  ×  2  n      2  n  normal-×  2  n    2n×2n    symplectic matrices with entries in   F   F   F   , and with the group operation that of matrix multiplication . Since all symplectic matrices have determinant    1   1   1   , the symplectic group is a subgroup of the special linear group     S  L   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  L     2  n   F     SL(2n,F)   .  More abstractly, the symplectic group can be defined as the set of linear transformations of a    2  n      2  n    2n   -dimensional vector space over   F   F   F   that preserve a non-degenerate , skew-symmetric , bilinear form , see classical group for this definition. Such a vector space is called a symplectic vector space . The symplectic group of an abstract symplectic vector space   V   V   V   is also denoted    S  p   (  V  )       S  p  V    Sp(V)   .  Typically, the field   F   F   F   is the field of real numbers ,   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   , or complex numbers ,   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . In this case    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   is a real/complex Lie group of real/complex dimension    n   (    2  n   +  1   )       n      2  n   1     n(2n+1)   . These groups are connected but non-compact .  The centre of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   consists of the matrices and as long as the characteristic of the field is not   2   2   2   . 1 Here denotes the    2  n  ×  2  n      2  n  normal-×  2  n    2n×2n   identity matrix. The non-triviality of the centre of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   and its relation to the simplicity of the group is discussed here .  The real rank of the Lie Algebra, and hence, the Lie Group for    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   is   n   n   n   .  The condition that a symplectic matrix preserves the symplectic form can be written as       S  ∈    Sp   (   2  n   ,  F  )    iff       S  T   Ω  S   =  Ω      formulae-sequence    S    Sp    2  n   F   iff         superscript  S  T   normal-Ω  S   normal-Ω     S\in\operatorname{Sp}(2n,F)\quad\text{iff}\quad S^{\text{T}}\Omega S=\Omega   where A T is the transpose of A and       Ω  =   (     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     )    .      normal-Ω    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0      \Omega=\begin{pmatrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\\
 \end{pmatrix}.     The Lie algebra of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   is given by the set of    2  n  ×  2  n      2  n  normal-×  2  n    2n×2n   matrices A (with entries in F ) that satisfy        Ω  A   +    A  T   Ω    =  0.          normal-Ω  A      superscript  A  normal-T   normal-Ω    0.    \Omega A+A^{\mathrm{T}}\Omega=0.     When    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , the symplectic condition on a matrix is satisfied if and only if the determinant is one, so that     S  p   (  2  ,  F  )    =   S  L   (  2  ,  F  )          S  p   2  F      S  L   2  F      Sp(2,F)=SL(2,F)   . For    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   , there are additional conditions, i.e.    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   is then a proper subgroup of    S  L   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  L     2  n   F     SL(2n,F)   .      S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})     The symplectic group over the field of complex numbers is a non-compact , simply connected , simple Lie group .      S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})         S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})   is the complexification of the real group    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   .    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   is a real, non-compact , connected , simple Lie group . 2 It has a fundamental group  isomorphic to the group of integers under addition. As the real form of a simple Lie group its Lie algebra is a splittable Lie algebra .  Some further properties of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   :   The exponential map from the Lie algebra     𝐬𝐩   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       𝐬𝐩     2  n   𝐑     \mathbf{sp}(2n,\mathbf{R})   to the group    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   is not surjective . However, any element of the group may be generated by the group multiplication of two elements. 3 In other words          ∀  S   ∈    Sp   (   2  n   ,  ℝ  )     ∃  X     ,   Y  ∈   𝔰  𝔭   (   2  n   ,  ℝ  )   such that  S   =    e  X    e  Y      .     formulae-sequence     for-all  S      Sp    2  n   ℝ     X         Y    𝔰  𝔭     2  n   ℝ   such that  S           superscript  e  X    superscript  e  Y        \forall\;S\in\operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})\;\exists\;X,Y\in\mathfrak{sp}(2n%

The set of such   Z   Z   Z   s forms a non-compact subgroup of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   whereas    U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)   forms a compact subgroup. This decomposition is known as 'Euler' or 'Bloch–Messiah' decomposition. 4 Further symplectic matrix properties can be found on that Wikipedia page.   As a Lie group ,    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   has a manifold structure. The manifold for    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   is diffeomorphic to the Cartesian product of the unitary group     U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)   with a vector space of dimension    n   (   n  +  1   )       n    n  1     n(n+1)   . 5   Infinitesimal generators  The members of the symplectic Lie algebra    𝐬𝐩   (   2  n   ,  𝐅  )       𝐬𝐩     2  n   𝐅     \mathbf{sp}(2n,\mathbf{F})   are the Hamiltonian matrices .  These are matrices,   Q   Q   Q   such that      Q  =   (     A    B      C     -   A  T       )       Q    A  B    C     superscript  A  normal-T        Q=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\

Example of symplectic matrices  For    S  p   (  2  ,  R  )       S  p   2  R     Sp(2,R)   , the group of    2  ×  2      2  normal-×  2    2×2   matrices with determinant   1   1   1   , the three symplectic    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   -matrices are: 6        (     1    0      0    1     )   ,   (     1    0      1    1     )   and   (     1    1      0    1     )    .       1  0    0  1      1  0    1  1    and    1  1    0  1      \begin{pmatrix}1&0\\

The tangent space at any point on a symplectic manifold is a symplectic vector space . 7 As noted earlier, structure preserving transformations of a symplectic vector space form a group and this group is    S  p   (   2  n   ,  F  )       S  p     2  n   F     Sp(2n,F)   , depending on the dimension of the space and the field over which it is defined.  A symplectic vector space is itself a symplectic manifold. A transformation under an action of the symplectic group is thus, in a sense, a linearised version of a symplectomorphism which is a more general structure preserving transformation on a symplectic manifold.      S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)     The compact symplectic group    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is often written as    U  S  p   (   2  n   )       U  S  p    2  n     USp(2n)   , indicating the fact that it is isomorphic to the group of unitary symplectic matrices,    S  p   (  n  )   ≅  U   (   2  n   )   ∩  S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p  n  normal-≅  U    2  n   normal-∩  S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(n)≅U(2n)∩Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})   . 8 Although the    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   notation is more common, and hence used here, it can be confusing in that the general idea of the symplectic group – including the compact, real and complex forms – can be represented as    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   . For example this is used in the sidebar at the top of this page in the list of classical groups .      S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is the subgroup of    G  L   (  n  ,  𝐇  )       G  L   n  𝐇     GL(n,\mathbf{H})   (invertible quaternionic matrices) that preserves the standard hermitian form on :       ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   =      x  ¯   1    y  1    +  ⋯  +     x  ¯   n    y  n          x  y        subscript   normal-¯  x   1    subscript  y  1    normal-⋯     subscript   normal-¯  x   n    subscript  y  n       \langle x,y\rangle=\bar{x}_{1}y_{1}+\cdots+\bar{x}_{n}y_{n}   That is,    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is just the quaternionic unitary group ,    U   (  n  ,  𝐇  )       U   n  𝐇     U(n,\mathbf{H})   . Indeed, it is sometimes called the hyperunitary group . Also Sp(1) is the group of quaternions of norm   1   1   1   , equivalent to     S  U   (  2  )       S  U  2    SU(2)    and topologically a    3   3   3   -sphere  .  Note that    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is not a symplectic group in the sense of the previous section—it does not preserve a non-degenerate skew-symmetric (   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   -bilinear) form on (in fact, the only skew-symmetric form is the zero form). Rather, it is isomorphic to a subgroup of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})   , and so does preserve a complex symplectic form in a vector space of dimension twice as high. As explained below, the Lie algebra of    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is a real form of the complex symplectic Lie algebra    𝐬𝐩   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       𝐬𝐩     2  n   𝐂     \mathbf{sp}(2n,\mathbf{C})   .      S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is a real Lie group with (real) dimension    n   (    2  n   +  1   )       n      2  n   1     n(2n+1)   . It is compact , connected , and simply connected .  The Lie algebra of    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   is given by the quaternionic skew-Hermitian matrices, the set of    n  -   b  y   -  n      n    b  y   n    n-by-n   quaternionic matrices that satisfy       A  +   A  †    =  0        A   superscript  A  normal-†    0    A+A^{\dagger}=0   where is the conjugate transpose of   A   A   A   (here one takes the quaternionic conjugate). The Lie bracket is given by the commutator.  Important subgroups  The compact symplectic group    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   comes up in quantum physics as a symmetry on Poisson brackets so it is important to understand its subgroups. Some main subgroups are:       Sp   (  n  )    ⊃   Sp   (   n  -  1   )         Sp    n  1     Sp  n     \operatorname{Sp}(n)\supset\operatorname{Sp}(n-1)          Sp   (  n  )    ⊃   U   (  n  )         normal-U  n    Sp  n     \operatorname{Sp}(n)\supset\operatorname{U}(n)          Sp   (  2  )    ⊃   O   (  4  )         normal-O  4    Sp  2     \operatorname{Sp}(2)\supset\operatorname{O}(4)   Conversely it is itself a subgroup of some other groups:       SU   (   2  n   )    ⊃   Sp   (  n  )         Sp  n    SU    2  n      \operatorname{SU}(2n)\supset\operatorname{Sp}(n)          F  4   ⊃   Sp   (  4  )         Sp  4    subscript  normal-F  4     \operatorname{F}_{4}\supset\operatorname{Sp}(4)          G  2   ⊃   Sp   (  1  )         Sp  1    subscript  normal-G  2     \operatorname{G}_{2}\supset\operatorname{Sp}(1)     There are also the isomorphisms of the Lie algebras      𝐬𝐩   (  2  )    =   𝐬𝐨   (  5  )          𝐬𝐩  2     𝐬𝐨  5     \mathbf{sp}(2)=\mathbf{so}(5)   and     𝐬𝐩   (  1  )    =   𝐬𝐨   (  3  )    =   𝐬𝐮   (  2  )            𝐬𝐩  1     𝐬𝐨  3          𝐬𝐮  2      \mathbf{sp}(1)=\mathbf{so}(3)=\mathbf{su}(2)   .  Relationship between the symplectic groups  Every complex, semisimple Lie algebra has a split real form and a compact real form ; the former is called a complexification of the latter two.  The Lie algebra of    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       S  p     2  n   𝐂     Sp(2n,\mathbf{C})   is semisimple and is denoted    𝐬𝐩   (   2  n   ,  𝐂  )       𝐬𝐩     2  n   𝐂     \mathbf{sp}(2n,\mathbf{C})   . Its split real form is    𝐬𝐩   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       𝐬𝐩     2  n   𝐑     \mathbf{sp}(2n,\mathbf{R})   and its compact real form is    𝐬𝐩   (  n  )       𝐬𝐩  n    \mathbf{sp}(n)   . These correspond to the Lie groups    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   and    S  p   (  n  )       S  p  n    Sp(n)   respectively.  The algebras,    𝐬𝐩   (  p  ,   n  −  p   )       𝐬𝐩   p    n  normal-−  p      \mathbf{sp}(p,n−p)   , which are the Lie algebras of    S  p   (  p  ,   n  −  p   )       S  p   p    n  normal-−  p      Sp(p,n−p)   , are the indefinite signature equivalent to the compact form.

The elements of the group    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   are, in a certain sense, canonical transformations on this vector, i.e. they preserve the form of Hamilton's equations . 9 If      𝐙  =   𝐙   (  𝐳  ,  t  )    =    (   Q  1   ,  …  ,   Q  n   ,   P  1   ,  …  ,   P  n   )   T         𝐙    𝐙   𝐳  t          superscript    subscript  Q  1   normal-…   subscript  Q  n    subscript  P  1   normal-…   subscript  P  n    T      \mathbf{Z}=\mathbf{Z}(\mathbf{z},t)=(Q_{1},\ldots,Q_{n},P_{1},\ldots,P_{n})^{T}     are new canonical coordinates, then, with a dot denoting time derivative,        𝐙  ˙   =   M   (  𝐳  ,  t  )    𝐳  ˙     ,       normal-˙  𝐙     M   𝐳  t    normal-˙  𝐳      \dot{\mathbf{Z}}=M(\mathbf{z},t)\dot{\mathbf{z}},     where       M   (  𝐳  ,  t  )    ∈   SL   (   2  n   ,  ℝ  )          M   𝐳  t      SL     2  n   ℝ      M(\mathbf{z},t)\in\mathrm{SL}(2n,\mathbb{R})     for all   t   t   t   and all   𝐳   𝐳   \mathbf{z}   in phase space. 10  Quantum mechanics  Consider a system of   n   n   n   particles whose quantum state encodes its position and momentum. These coordinates are continuous variables and hence the Hilbert space , in which the state lives, is infinite-dimensional. This often makes the analysis of this situation tricky. An alternative approach is to consider the evolution of the position and momentum operators under the Heisenberg equation in phase space .  Construct a vector of canonical coordinates ,        𝐳  ^   =    (    q  ^   1   ,  …  ,    q  ^   n   ,    p  ^   1   ,  …  ,    p  ^   n   )   T    .       normal-^  𝐳    superscript    subscript   normal-^  q   1   normal-…   subscript   normal-^  q   n    subscript   normal-^  p   1   normal-…   subscript   normal-^  p   n    T     \mathbf{\hat{z}}=(\hat{q}_{1},\ldots,\hat{q}_{n},\hat{p}_{1},\ldots,\hat{p}_{n%
 })^{T}.     The canonical commutation relation can be expressed simply as       [   𝐳  ^   ,    𝐳  ^   T   ]   =   i  ℏ  Ω         normal-^  𝐳    superscript   normal-^  𝐳   T      i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  normal-Ω     [\mathbf{\hat{z}},\mathbf{\hat{z}}^{T}]=i\hbar\Omega     where      Ω  =   (     𝟎     I  n        -   I  n      𝟎     )       normal-Ω    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0      \Omega=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{0}&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&\mathbf{0}\end{pmatrix}     and is the    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n   identity matrix.  Many physical situations only require quadratic Hamiltonians , i.e. Hamiltonians of the form       H  ^   =    1  2     𝐳  ^   T   K   𝐳  ^         normal-^  H       1  2    superscript   normal-^  𝐳   T   K   normal-^  𝐳      \hat{H}=\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{\hat{z}}^{T}K\mathbf{\hat{z}}     where   K   K   K   is a    2  n  ×  2  n      2  n  normal-×  2  n    2n×2n   real, symmetric matrix . This turns out to be a useful restriction and allows us to rewrite the Heisenberg equation as        d   𝐳  ^     d  t    =   Ω  K   𝐳  ^            d   normal-^  𝐳      d  t      normal-Ω  K   normal-^  𝐳      \frac{d\mathbf{\hat{z}}}{dt}=\Omega K\mathbf{\hat{z}}     The solution to this equation must preserve the canonical commutation relation . It can be shown that the time evolution of this system is equivalent to an action of the real symplectic group,    S  p   (   2  n   ,  𝐑  )       S  p     2  n   𝐑     Sp(2n,\mathbf{R})   , on the phase space.
