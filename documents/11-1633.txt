(tyrosine 3-monooxygenase) kinase

In enzymology, a [tyrosine 3-monooxygenase] kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + [tyrosine-3-monooxygenase] 
 
 
 
  ADP + phospho-[tyrosine-3-monooxygenase]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and tyrosine-3-monooxygenase, whereas its two products are ADP and phospho-[tyrosine-3-monooxygenase].
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in proteins (protein-serine/threonine kinases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[tyrosine-3-monoxygenase] phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include pheochromocytoma tyrosine hydroxylase-associated kinase, STK4, and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase kinase (phosphorylating). This enzyme participates in mapk signaling pathway and non-small cell lung cancer.
