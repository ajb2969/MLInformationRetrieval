   Step function      Step function   In mathematics , a function on the real numbers is called a step function (or staircase function ) if it can be written as a finite  linear combination of indicator functions of intervals . Informally speaking, a step function is a piecewise  constant function having only finitely many pieces.  Definition and first consequences  A function    f  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   is called a step function if it can be written as       f   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     α  i    χ   A  i     (  x  )           f  x     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  α  i    subscript  χ   subscript  A  i    x      f(x)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}\alpha_{i}\chi_{A_{i}}(x)\,   for all real numbers   x   x   x     where     n  ≥  0   ,      n  0    n\geq 0,       α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   are real numbers,    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   are intervals, and     χ  A      subscript  χ  A    \chi_{A}\,   (sometimes written as    1  A     subscript  1  A    1_{A}   ) is the indicator function of   A   A   A   :        χ  A    (  x  )    =   {     1       if  x   ∈  A   ,       0       if  x   ∉  A   .              subscript  χ  A   x    cases  1      if  x   A   0      if  x   A      \chi_{A}(x)=\begin{cases}1&\mbox{if }x\in A,\\
 0&\mbox{if }x\notin A.\\
 \end{cases}     In this definition, the intervals    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   can be assumed to have the following two properties:   The intervals are disjoint ,      A  i   ∩   A  j    =  ∅         subscript  A  i    subscript  A  j       A_{i}\cap A_{j}=\emptyset   for    i  ≠  j      i  j    i\neq j     The union of the intervals is the entire real line,       ∪   i  =  0   n    A  i    =  ℝ   .        superscript   subscript     i  0    n    subscript  A  i    ℝ    \cup_{i=0}^{n}A_{i}=\mathbb{R}.      Indeed, if that is not the case to start with, a different set of intervals can be picked for which these assumptions hold. For example, the step function      f  =    4   χ   [   -  5   ,  1  )     +   3    χ   (  0  ,  6  )           f      4   subscript  χ     5   1       3   subscript  χ   0  6        f=4\chi_{[-5,1)}+3\chi_{(0,6)}\,     can be written as       f  =    0   χ   (   -  ∞   ,   -  5   )     +   4   χ   [   -  5   ,  0  ]     +   7   χ   (  0  ,  1  )     +   3   χ   [  1  ,  6  )     +   0   χ   [  6  ,  ∞  )       .      f      0   subscript  χ         5        4   subscript  χ     5   0       7   subscript  χ   0  1       3   subscript  χ   1  6       0   subscript  χ   6         f=0\chi_{(-\infty,-5)}+4\chi_{[-5,0]}+7\chi_{(0,1)}+3\chi_{[1,6)}+0\chi_{[6,%
 \infty)}.\,     Examples  (Figure)  The Heaviside step function is an often used step function.    A constant function is a trivial example of a step function. Then there is only one interval,      A  0   =  ℝ   .       subscript  A  0   ℝ    A_{0}=\mathbb{R}.     The Heaviside function  H ( x ) is an important step function. It is the mathematical concept behind some test signals , such as those used to determine the step response of a dynamical system .   (Figure)  The rectangular function , the next simplest step function.    The rectangular function , the normalized boxcar function , is the next simplest step function, and is used to model a unit pulse.   Non-examples   The integer part function is not a step function according to the definition of this article, since it has an infinite number of intervals. However, some authors define step functions also with an infinite number of intervals. 1   Properties   The sum and product of two step functions is again a step function. The product of a step function with a number is also a step function. As such, the step functions form an algebra over the real numbers.  A step function takes only a finite number of values. If the intervals     A  i   ,     subscript  A  i    A_{i},        i  =   0  ,  1  ,  …  ,  n    ,      i   0  1  normal-…  n     i=0,1,\dots,n,   in the above definition of the step function are disjoint and their union is the real line, then     f   (  x  )    =    α  i          f  x    subscript  α  i     f(x)=\alpha_{i}\,   for all     x  ∈   A  i    .      x   subscript  A  i     x\in A_{i}.     The Lebesgue integral of a step function    f  =    ∑   i  =  0   n     α  i     χ   A  i           f    superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  α  i    subscript  χ   subscript  A  i        \textstyle f=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}\alpha_{i}\chi_{A_{i}}\,   is      ∫    f   d  x    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     α  i   ℓ   (   A  i   )      ,          f  d  x      superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  α  i   normal-ℓ   subscript  A  i       \textstyle\int\!f\,dx=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}\alpha_{i}\ell(A_{i}),\,   where    ℓ   (  A  )       normal-ℓ  A    \ell(A)   is the length of the interval    A  ,    A   A,   and it is assumed here that all intervals    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   have finite length. In fact, this equality (viewed as a definition) can be the first step in constructing the Lebesgue integral. 2   See also   Crenel function  Simple function  Piecewise defined function  Sigmoid function  Step detection   References  "  Category:Special functions     for example see: ↩  ↩
