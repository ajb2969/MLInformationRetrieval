   Projective hierarchy      Projective hierarchy   In the mathematical field of descriptive set theory , a subset   A   A   A   of a Polish space    X   X   X   is projective if it is    𝚺  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{n}   for some positive integer   n   n   n   . Here   A   A   A   is       𝚺  1  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   1    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{1}   if   A   A   A   is analytic      𝚷  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{n}   if the complement of   A   A   A   ,    X  ∖  A      X  A    X\setminus A   , is    𝚺  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{n}         𝚺   n  +  1   1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1     n  1     \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{n+1}   if there is a Polish space   Y   Y   Y   and a    𝚷  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{n}   subset    C  ⊆   X  ×  Y       C    X  Y     C\subseteq X\times Y   such that   A   A   A   is the projection of   C   C   C   ; that is,    A  =   {   x  ∈  X   ∣    ∃  y   ∈   Y   (  x  ,  y  )    ∈  C   }       A   conditional-set    x  X         y     Y   x  y         C       A=\{x\in X\mid\exists y\in Y(x,y)\in C\}      The choice of the Polish space   Y   Y   Y   in the third clause above is not very important; it could be replaced in the definition by a fixed uncountable Polish space, say Baire space or Cantor space or the real line .  Relationship to the analytical hierarchy  There is a close relationship between the relativized analytical hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by lightface letters   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   and   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   ) and the projective hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by boldface letters   𝚺   𝚺   \boldsymbol{\Sigma}   and   𝚷   𝚷   \boldsymbol{\Pi}   ). Not every    𝚺  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{n}   subset of Baire space is    Σ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Σ  1   n    \Sigma^{1}_{n}   . It is true, however, that if a subset X of Baire space is    𝚺  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{n}   then there is a set of natural numbers A such that X is    Σ  n   1  ,  A      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ   1  A    n    \Sigma^{1,A}_{n}   . A similar statement holds for    𝚷  n  1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1   n    \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{n}   sets. Thus the sets classified by the projective hierarchy are exactly the sets classified by the relativized version of the analytical hierarchy. This relationship is important in effective descriptive set theory .  A similar relationship between the projective hierarchy and the relativized analytical hierarchy holds for subsets of Cantor space and, more generally, subsets of any effective Polish space .
