Projective hierarchy

In the mathematical field of descriptive set theory, a subset 
 
 
 
  of a Polish space

 
  is projective if it is 
 
 
 
  for some positive integer 
 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  is



 
  if 
 
 
 
  is analytic


 
  if the complement of 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , is 
 
 



 
  if there is a Polish space 
 
 
 
  and a 
 
 
 
 
  subset 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the projection of 
 
 
 
 ; that is, 
 
 


The choice of the Polish space 
 
 
 
 
  in the third clause above is not very important; it could be replaced in the definition by a fixed uncountable Polish space, say Baire space or Cantor space or the real line.
Relationship to the analytical hierarchy
There is a close relationship between the relativized analytical hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by lightface letters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) and the projective hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by boldface letters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ). Not every 
 
 
 
 
  subset of Baire space is 
 
 
 
 . It is true, however, that if a subset X of Baire space is 
 
 
 
  then there is a set of natural numbers A such that X is 
 
 
 
 . A similar statement holds for 
 
 
 
  sets. Thus the sets classified by the projective hierarchy are exactly the sets classified by the relativized version of the analytical hierarchy. This relationship is important in effective descriptive set theory.
A similar relationship between the projective hierarchy and the relativized analytical hierarchy holds for subsets of Cantor space and, more generally, subsets of any effective Polish space.
