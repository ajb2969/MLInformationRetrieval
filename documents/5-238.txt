   Δ-hyperbolic space      Δ-hyperbolic space   In mathematics , a δ -hyperbolic space is a geodesic metric space in which every geodesic triangle is δ-thin .  There are many equivalent definitions of " δ -thin". A simple definition is as follows: pick three points and draw geodesic lines between them to make a geodesic triangle. Then any point on any of the edges of the triangle is within a distance of δ from one of the other two sides.  For example, trees are 0-hyperbolic: a geodesic triangle in a tree is just a subtree, so any point on a geodesic triangle is actually on two edges. Normal Euclidean space is ∞-hyperbolic; i.e. not hyperbolic. Generally, the higher δ has to be, the less curved the space is.  The definition of δ -hyperbolic space is generally credited to Eliyahu Rips . There is also a definition of δ -hyperbolicity due to Mikhail Gromov . A geodesic metric space is said to be a Gromov δ -hyperbolic space if, for all p , x , y and z in X ,         (  x  ,  z  )   p   ≥    min   {    (  x  ,  y  )   p   ,    (  y  ,  z  )   p   }    -  δ    ,       subscript   x  z   p        subscript   x  y   p    subscript   y  z   p    δ     (x,z)_{p}\geq\min\big\{(x,y)_{p},(y,z)_{p}\big\}-\delta,     where ( x , y ) p denotes the Gromov product of x and y at p . X is said to be simply Gromov hyperbolic if it is Gromov δ -hyperbolic for some δ ≥ 0.  See also   Negatively curved group   References    .   "  Delta-hyperbolic space
