   Stable ∞-category      Stable ∞-category   In category theory , a branch of mathematics, a stable ∞-category is an ∞-category such that 1   (i) It has a zero object .  (ii) Every morphism in it admits a fiber and cofiber.  (iii) A triangle in it is a fiber sequence if and only if it is a cofiber sequence .   The homotopy category of a stable ∞-category is triangulated . 2 A stable ∞-category admits finite limits and colimits . 3  Examples: the derived category of an abelian category and the ∞-category of spectra are both stable.  A stabilization of an ∞-category  C having finite limits and base point is a functor from the stable ∞-category S to C . It preserves limit. The objects in the image have the structure of infinite loop spaces; whence, the notion is a generalization of the corresponding notion ( stabilization (topology) ) in classical algebraic topology.  By definition, the t-structure of an stable ∞-category is the t-structure of its homotopy category. Let C be a stable ∞-category with a t-structure. Then every filtered object      X   (  i  )    ,  i   ∈  ℤ         X  i   i   ℤ    X(i),i\in\mathbb{Z}   in C gives rise to a spectral sequence     E  r   p  ,  q      subscript   superscript  E   p  q    r    E^{p,q}_{r}   , which, under some conditions, converges to      π   p  +  q     colim  X    (  i  )    .       subscript  π    p  q     colim  X   i    \pi_{p+q}\operatorname{colim}X(i).    4 By the Dold–Kan correspondence , this generalizes the construction of the spectral sequence associated to a filtered chain complex of abelian groups .
