   CM-field      CM-field   In mathematics , a CM-field is a particular type of number field , so named for a close connection to the theory of complex multiplication . Another name used is J-field .  The abbreviation "CM" was introduced by .  Formal definition  A number field K is a CM-field if it is a quadratic extension  K / F where the base field F is totally real but K is totally imaginary . I.e., every embedding of F into   ‚ÑÇ   ‚ÑÇ   \mathbb{C}   lies entirely within   ‚Ñù   ‚Ñù   \mathbb{R}   , but there is no embedding of K into   ‚Ñù   ‚Ñù   \mathbb{R}   .  In other words, there is a subfield F of K such that K is generated over F by a single square root of an element, say Œ≤ =    Œ±      Œ±    \sqrt{\alpha}   , in such a way that the minimal polynomial of Œ≤ over the rational number field    ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   has all its roots non-real complex numbers. For this Œ± should be chosen totally negative , so that for each embedding œÉ of    K  ‚Ä≤     superscript  K  normal-‚Ä≤    K^{\prime}   into the real number field, œÉ(Œ±) \mathbb C  induces an automorphism on the field which is independent of its embedding into   ‚ÑÇ   ‚ÑÇ   \mathbb{C}   . In the notation given, it must change the sign of Œ≤.  A number field K is a CM-field if and only if it has a "units defect", i.e. if it contains a proper subfield F whose unit group has the same   ‚Ñ§   ‚Ñ§   \mathbb{Z}   -rank as that of K . In fact, F is the totally real subfield of K mentioned above. This follows from Dirichlet's unit theorem .  Examples   The simplest, and motivating, example of a CM-field is an imaginary quadratic field , for which the totally real subfield is just the field of rationals  One of the most important examples of a CM-field is the cyclotomic field     ‚Ñö   (   Œ∂  n   )       ‚Ñö   subscript  Œ∂  n     \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n})   , which is generated by a primitive nth root of unity . It is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of the totally real field      ‚Ñö   (    Œ∂  n   +   Œ∂  n   -  1     )    .      ‚Ñö     subscript  Œ∂  n    superscript   subscript  Œ∂  n     1       \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n}+\zeta_{n}^{-1}).   The latter is the fixed field of complex conjugation , and    ‚Ñö   (   Œ∂  n   )       ‚Ñö   subscript  Œ∂  n     \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n})   is obtained from it by adjoining a square root of        Œ∂  n  2   +   Œ∂  n   -  2     -  2   =    (    Œ∂  n   -   Œ∂  n   -  1     )   2    .           superscript   subscript  Œ∂  n   2    superscript   subscript  Œ∂  n     2     2    superscript     subscript  Œ∂  n    superscript   subscript  Œ∂  n     1     2     \zeta_{n}^{2}+\zeta_{n}^{-2}-2=(\zeta_{n}-\zeta_{n}^{-1})^{2}.     The union Q CM of all CM fields is similar to a CM field except that it has infinite degree. It is a quadratic extension of the union of all totally real fields Q R . The absolute Galois group Gal(    ùêê  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  ùêê    \overline{\mathbf{Q}}   / Q R ) is generated (as a closed subgroup) by all elements of order 2 in Gal(    ùêê  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  ùêê    \overline{\mathbf{Q}}   / Q ), and Gal(    ùêê  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  ùêê    \overline{\mathbf{Q}}   / Q CM ) is a subgroup of index 2. The Galois group Gal( Q CM / Q ) has a center generated by an element of order 2 (complex conjugation) and the quotient by its center is the group Gal( Q R / Q ).  If V is a complex abelian variety of dimension n , then any abelian algebra F of endomorphisms of V has rank at most 2 n over Z . If it has rank 2 n and V is simple then F is an order in a CM-field. Conversely any CM field arises like this from some simple complex abelian variety, unique up to isogeny.   References        "  Category:Field theory  Category:Algebraic number theory
