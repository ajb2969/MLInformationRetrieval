3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue (2-methylpropanoyl)transferase] lipoyllysine 
 
 
 
  [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue (2-methylpropanoyl)transferase] S-(2-methylpropanoyl)dihydrolipoyllysine + CO2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue (2-methylpropanoyl)transferase, and lipoyllysine, whereas its 3 products are dihydrolipoyllysine-residue (2-methylpropanoyl)transferase, S-(2-methylpropanoyl)dihydrolipoyllysine, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with a disulfide as acceptor.
This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation. It employs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate.
