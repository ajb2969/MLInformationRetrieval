Sacks property

In mathematical set theory, the Sacks property holds between two models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory if they are not "too dissimilar" in the following sense.
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  transitive models of set theory, 
 
 
 
  is said to have the Sacks property over 
 
 
 
 
  if and only if for every function 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  diverges to infinity, and every function 
 
 
 
 
  mapping 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  there is a tree

 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
 
  level of 
 
 
 
  has cardinality at most 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a branch of

The Sacks property is used to control the value of certain cardinal invariants in forcing arguments. It is named for Gerald Enoch Sacks.
A forcing notion is said to have the Sacks property if and only if the forcing extension has the Sacks property over the ground model. Examples include Sacks forcing and Silver forcing.
Shelah proved that when proper forcings with the Sacks property are iterated using countable supports, the resulting forcing notion will have the Sacks property as well.23
The Sacks property is equivalent to the conjunction of the Laver property and the 
 
 
 
 
 -bounding property.
