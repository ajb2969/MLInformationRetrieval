   Strength (mathematical logic)      Strength (mathematical logic)   The relative strength of two systems of formal logic can be defined via model theory . Specifically, a logic   α   α   \alpha   is said to be as strong as a logic   β   β   \beta   if every elementary class in   β   β   \beta   is an elementary class in   α   α   \alpha   . 1  See also   Abstract logic  Lindström's theorem   References  "  Category:Model theory  Category:Mathematical logic  Category:Concepts in logic     Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus  Extended logics: the general framework in K.
