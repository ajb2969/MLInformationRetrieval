Nilpotent cone

In mathematics, the nilpotent cone

 
  of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra

 
  is the set of elements that act nilpotently in all representations of 
 
 
 
  In other words,



The nilpotent cone is an irreducible subvariety of

Example
The nilpotent cone of 
 
 
 
 , the Lie algebra of 2×2 matrices with vanishing trace, is the variety of all 2×2 traceless matrices with rank less than or equal to
