   Nilpotent cone      Nilpotent cone   In mathematics , the nilpotent cone    𝒩   𝒩   \mathcal{N}   of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the set of elements that act nilpotently in all representations of    𝔤  .    𝔤   \mathfrak{g}.   In other words,       𝒩  =   {   a  ∈  𝔤   :    ρ   (  a  )   is nilpotent for all representations  ρ   :   𝔤  →   End   (  V  )      }    .      𝒩   conditional-set    a  𝔤    normal-:    ρ  a  is nilpotent for all representations  ρ    normal-→  𝔤   End  V        \mathcal{N}=\{a\in\mathfrak{g}:\rho(a)\mbox{ is nilpotent for all %
 representations }\rho:\mathfrak{g}\to\operatorname{End}(V)\}.     The nilpotent cone is an irreducible subvariety of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   (considered as a   k   k   k   - vector space ).  Example  The nilpotent cone of    sl  2     subscript  sl  2    \operatorname{sl}_{2}   , the Lie algebra of 2×2 matrices with vanishing trace , is the variety of all 2×2 traceless matrices with rank less than or equal to   1.   1.   1.
