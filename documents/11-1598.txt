Ribose 1,5-bisphosphate phosphokinase

In enzymology, a ribose 1,5-bisphosphate phosphokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + ribose 1,5-bisphosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and ribose 1,5-bisphosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:ribose-1,5-bisphosphate phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase, and PhnN. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway.
