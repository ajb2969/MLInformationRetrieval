Self number

A self number, Colombian number or Devlali number is an integer that cannot be written as the sum of any other integer n and the individual digits of n. This property is specific to the base used to represent the integers. 20 is a self number (in base 10), because no such combination can be found (all n  20). 21 is not, because it can be written as 15 + 1 + 5 using n = 15.
These numbers were first described in 1949 by the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar.
The first few base 10 self numbers are:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31, 42, 53, 64, 75, 86, 97, 108, 110, 121, 132, 143, 154, 165, 176, 187, 198, 209, 211, 222, 233, 244, 255, 266, 277, 288, 299, 310, 312, 323, 334, 345, 356, 367, 378, 389, 400, 411, 413, 424, 435, 446, 457, 468, 479, 490, 501, 512, 514, 525 
 

A search for self numbers can turn up self-descriptive numbers, which are similar to self numbers in being base-dependent, but quite different in definition and much fewer in frequency.
Properties
In general, for even bases, all odd numbers below the base number are self numbers, since any number below such an odd number would have to also be a 1-digit number which when added to its digit would result in an even number. For odd bases, all odd numbers are self numbers.1
The set of self numbers in a given base q is infinite and has a positive asymptotic density: when q is odd, this density is 1/2.2
Recurrent formula
The following recurrence relation generates some base 10 self numbers:



(with C1 = 9)
And for binary numbers:



(where j stands for the number of digits) we can generalize a recurrence relation to generate self numbers in any base b:



in which C1 = b − 1 for even bases and C1 = b − 2 for odd bases.
The existence of these recurrence relations shows that for any base there are infinitely many self numbers.
Self primes
A self prime is a self number that is prime. The first few self primes are

3, 5, 7, 31, 53, 97, 211, 233, 277, 367, 389, ... 
 

In October 2006 Luke Pebody demonstrated that the largest known Mersenne prime that is at the same time a self number is 224036583−1. This is then the largest known self prime .
Selfness tests
Reduction tests
Luke Pebody showed (Oct 2006) that a link can be made between the self property of a large number n and a low-order portion of that number, adjusted for digit sums:
a) In general, n is self if and only if m = R(n)+SOD(R(n))-SOD(n) is self
Where:
R(n) is the smallest rightmost digits of n, greater than 9.d(n)
d(n) is the number of digits in n
SOD(x) is the sum of digits of x, the function S10(x) from above.
b) If n = a.10^b+c, c n \mbox{ is self if } [ n - DR*(n) - 9 \cdot i ] + SOD([ n - DR*(n) - 9 \cdot i ] ) \neq n \quad \forall i \in 0 \ldots d(n) 
Where:
