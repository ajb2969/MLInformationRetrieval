   Diffusing-wave spectroscopy      Diffusing-wave spectroscopy   Diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS) is an optical technique derived from dynamic light scattering (DLS) that studies the dynamics of scattered light in the limit of strong multiple scattering. 1 2 It has been widely used in the past to study colloidal suspensions , emulsions , foams , gels, biological media and other forms of soft matter . If carefully calibrated, DWS allows the quantitative measurement of microscopic motion in a soft material, from which the rheological properties of the complex medium can be extracted via the so-called microrheology approach.  One-speckle diffusing-wave spectroscopy  Laser light is sent to the sample and the outcoming transmitted or backscattered light is detected by an optoelectric sensor. The light intensity detected is the result of the interference of all the optical waves coming from the different light paths.  Image:figureDWS.png|Typical setup of diffusing-wave spectroscopy  The signal is analysed by calculating the intensity autocorrelation function called g 2 .      g  2    (  τ  )    =     ⟨   I   (  t  )   I   (   t  +  τ   )    ⟩   t     ⟨   I   (  t  )    ⟩   t  2           subscript  g  2   τ      subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    I  t  I    t  τ     t    superscript   subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    I  t    t   2      g_{2}(\tau)=\frac{\langle I(t)I(t+\tau)\rangle_{t}}{\langle I(t)\rangle_{t}^{2}}     For the case of non-interacting particles suspended in a (complex) fluid a direct relation between g 2 -1 and the mean squared displacement of the particles 2> can be established. Let's note P(s) the probability density function (PDF) of the photon path length s. The relation can be written as follows: 3      g  2    (  τ  )   -  1  =    [  ∫  d  s  P   (  s  )   exp   (  -   (  s  /  l  *  )    k  0  2    ⟨  Δ   r  2    (  τ  )   ⟩   )   ]   2      fragments   subscript  g  2    fragments  normal-(  τ  normal-)    1    superscript   fragments  normal-[   d  s  P   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)     fragments  normal-(    fragments  normal-(  s   l   normal-)    superscript   subscript  k  0   2    fragments  normal-⟨  Δ   superscript  r  2    fragments  normal-(  τ  normal-)   normal-⟩   normal-)   normal-]   2     g_{2}(\tau)-1=[\int{dsP(s)\exp(-(s/l*)k_{0}^{2}\langle\Delta r^{2}(\tau)%
 \rangle)}]^{2}     with     k  0   =    2  π  n   λ        subscript  k  0       2  π  n   λ     k_{0}=\frac{2\pi n}{\lambda}   and    l  *     fragments  l     l*   is the transport mean free path of scattered light.  For simple cell geometries, it is thus possible to calculate the mean squared displacement of the particles 2> from the measured g 2 -1 values analytically. For example, for the backscattering geometry, an infinitely thick cell, large laser spot illumination and detection of photons coming from the center of the spot, the relation ship between g 2 -1 and 2> is:         g  2    (  τ  )    -  1   =   exp   (   -   2  γ     ⟨   Δ   r  2    (  τ  )    ⟩    k  0  2       )             subscript  g  2   τ   1         2  γ       delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript  r  2   τ     superscript   subscript  k  0   2          g_{2}(\tau)-1=\exp\left(-2\gamma\sqrt{\langle\Delta r^{2}(\tau)\rangle k_{0}^{%
 2}}\right)   , γ value is around 2.  For less thick cells and in transmission, the relationship depends also on l* (the transport length). 4  Multispeckle Diffusing-Wave Spectroscopy (MSDWS)  This technique either uses a camera to detect many speckle grains (see speckle pattern ) or a ground glass to create a large number of speckle realizations (Echo-DWS 5 ). In both cases an average over a large number of statistically independent intensity values is obtained, allowing a much faster data acquisition time.

Echo-DWS allows seamless integration of MSDWS in a traditional DWS-scheme with superior temporal resolution down to 12 ns. 6 Camera based adaptive image processing allows online measurement of particle dynamics for example during drying. 7  References  External links   Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy Overview with video  Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy Overview with Animations  Particle Sizing using Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy   "  Category:Spectroscopy  Category:Soft matter     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  http://spie.org/x8591.xml?highlight=x2404&ArticleID; ;=x8591 ↩  ↩  ↩
