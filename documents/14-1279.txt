Potassium hexafluoronickelate(IV)

Potassium hexafluoronickelate(IV) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It can be produced through the reaction of potassium fluoride, nickel dichloride, and fluorine.
It reacts violently with water, releasing oxygen. It dissolves in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to produce a light-red solution. Potassium hexafluoronickelate(IV) decomposes at 350 °C, forming potassium hexafluoronickelate(III), nickel(II) fluoride, and fluorine:1



Potassium hexafluoronickelate is a strong oxidant. It can turn chlorine pentafluoride and bromine pentafluoride into  and , respectively:2




( X = Cl or Br , -60 °C , aHF = anhydrous hydrogen fluoride )
