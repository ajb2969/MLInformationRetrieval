   Gamma-terpinene synthase      Gamma-terpinene synthase   Gamma-terpinene synthase (, OvTPS2 , ClcTS ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, gamma-terpinene-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    gamma-terpinene + diphosphate    This enzyme is isolated from Thymus vulgaris ( thyme ), Citrus limon ( lemon ), Citrus unshiu ( satsuma ) and Origanum vulgare ( oregano ).
