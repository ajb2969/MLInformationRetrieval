Stufe (algebra)

In field theory, the Stufe (/ʃtuːfə/; German: level) s(F) of a field F is the least number of squares that sum to -1. If -1 cannot be written as a sum of squares, s(F)=
 
 
 
 . In this case, F is a formally real field. Albrecht Pfister proved that the Stufe, if finite, is always a power of 2, and that conversely every power of 2 occurs.1
Powers of 2
If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 .23
Proof: Let 
 
 
 
 
  be chosen such that 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . Then there are 
 
 
 
  elements 
 
 
 
  such that



Both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are sums of 
 
 
 
  squares, and 
 
 
 
 , since otherwise 
 
 
 
 
 , contrary to the assumption on 
 
 
 
 .
According to the theory of Pfister forms, the product 
 
 
 
  is itself a sum of 
 
 
 
  squares, that is, 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 
 . But since 
 
 
 
 , we also have 
 
 
 
 , and hence



and thus 
 
 
 
 .
Positive characteristic
The Stufe 
 
 
 
 
  for all fields 
 
 
 
  with positive characteristic.4
Proof: Let 
 
 
 
 . It suffices to prove the claim for 
 
 
 
  .
If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  consider the set 
 
 
 
  of squares. 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of index 
 
 
 
 
  in the cyclic group 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  elements. Thus 
 
 
 
  contains exactly 
 
 
 
  elements, and so does 
 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  only has 
 
 
 
  elements in total, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  cannot be disjoint, that is, there are 
 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
The Stufe s(F) is related to the Pythagoras number p(F) by p(F) ≤ s(F)+1.5 If F is not formally real then s(F) ≤ p(F) ≤ s(F)+1.67 The additive order of the form (1), and hence the exponent of the Witt group of F is equal to 2s(F).89
Examples

The Stufe of a quadratically closed field is 1.10
The Stufe of an algebraic number field is ∞, 1, 2 or 4 ("Siegel's theorem).11 Examples are Q, Q(√-1), Q(√-2) and Q(√-7).12
The Stufe of a finite field GF(q) is 1 if q ≡ 1 mod 4 and 2 if q ≡ 3 mod 4.131415
The Stufe of a local field of odd residue characteristic is equal to that of its residue field. The Stufe of the 2-adic field Q2 is 4.16
