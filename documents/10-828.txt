   RRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase      RRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a rRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + rRNA containing N 1 -methylguanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and rRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and rRNA containing N1-methyl guanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (guanine-N1-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include ribosomal ribonucleate guanine 1-methyltransferase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (guanine-1-N-)-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
