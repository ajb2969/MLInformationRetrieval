Rice–Shapiro theorem

In computability theory, the Rice–Shapiro theorem is a generalization of Rice's theorem, and is named after Henry Gordon Rice and Norman Shapiro.1
Informal statement
The statement can be expressed informally as follows: given that a computable function (viewed as a black-box) is an infinite object, and given that we cannot hope to develop a general algorithm for studying a property of the function on infinite input-output pairs, there is in general no truly better way than to apply the function on some inputs and hope to get their outputs.
Formal statement
Let A be a set of partial-recursive unary functions on the domain of natural numbers such that the set 
 
 
 
  is recursively enumerable, where 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
 
 -th partial-recursive function in a Gödel numbering.
Then for any unary partial-recursive function 

, we have:


 
  a finite function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

In the given statement, a finite function is a function with a finite domain 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  means that for every 
 
 
 
  it holds that 
 
 
 
  is defined and equal to 
 
 
 
 .
In general, one can obtain the following statement: The set 
 
 
 
  is recursively enumerable iff the following two conditions hold:
(a) 
 
 
 
  is recursively enumerable;
(b) 
 
 
 
  iff 
 
 
 
  a finite function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  extends 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the canonical index of 
 
 
 
 .
