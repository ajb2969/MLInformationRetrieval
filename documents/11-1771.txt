   Rice–Shapiro theorem      Rice–Shapiro theorem   In computability theory , the Rice–Shapiro theorem is a generalization of Rice's theorem , and is named after Henry Gordon Rice and Norman Shapiro . 1  Informal statement  The statement can be expressed informally as follows: given that a computable function (viewed as a black-box) is an infinite object, and given that we cannot hope to develop a general algorithm for studying a property of the function on infinite input-output pairs, there is in general no truly better way than to apply the function on some inputs and hope to get their outputs.  Formal statement  Let A be a set of partial-recursive unary functions on the domain of natural numbers such that the set    {  n  ∣    φ  n   ∈  A   }     conditional-set  n     subscript  φ  n   A     \{n\mid\varphi_{n}\in A\}   is recursively enumerable , where    φ  n     subscript  φ  n    \varphi_{n}   denotes the   n   n   n   -th partial-recursive function in a Gödel numbering .  Then for any unary partial-recursive function    ψ   ψ   \psi    , we have:       ψ  ∈  A   ⇔  ∃     normal-⇔    ψ  A      \psi\in A\Leftrightarrow\exists   a finite function    θ  ⊆  ψ      θ  ψ    \theta\subseteq\psi   such that     θ  ∈  A   .      θ  A    \theta\in A.     In the given statement, a finite function is a function with a finite domain     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}   and    θ  ⊆  ψ      θ  ψ    \theta\subseteq\psi   means that for every    x  ∈   {   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   }       x    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      x\in\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\}   it holds that    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    \psi(x)   is defined and equal to    θ   (  x  )       θ  x    \theta(x)   .  In general, one can obtain the following statement: The set    {  n  :    φ  n   ∈  A   }     conditional-set  n     subscript  φ  n   A     \{n:\varphi_{n}\in A\}   is recursively enumerable iff the following two conditions hold:  (a)    {  θ  :   θ  =    φ  n    ∀  n    ∈  A   }     conditional-set  θ      θ     subscript  φ  n    for-all  n         A      \{\theta:\theta=\varphi_{n}\forall n\in A\}   is recursively enumerable;  (b)    n  ∈  A      n  A    n\in A   iff   ∃     \exists   a finite function   θ   θ   \theta   such that    φ  n     subscript  φ  n    \varphi_{n}   extends     θ  ∧   c   (  θ  )     ∈  A        θ    c  θ    A    \theta\wedge c(\theta)\in A   where    c   (  θ  )       c  θ    c(\theta)   is the canonical index of   θ   θ   \theta   .
