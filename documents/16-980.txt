   Simpson's Rules (Ship Stability)      Simpson's Rules (Ship Stability)   Simpson's rules are a set of rules used in Ship Stability and naval architecture , to calculate the areas and volumes of irregular figures. 1  (Figure)  Simpson's First Rule   Simpson's 1st rule  Also known as the 1-4-1 rule (after the multipliers used ). 2      A  r  e  a   =    h  3    (   a  +   4  b   +   2  c   +   4  d   +   2  e   +   4  f   +  g   )          A  r  e  a       h  3     a    4  b     2  c     4  d     2  e     4  f   g      Area=\frac{h}{3}(a+4b+2c+4d+2e+4f+g)     Simpson's 2nd rule  Also known as the 1-3-3-1 rule, Simpson's second rule is a simplified version of Simpson's 3/8 rule . 3     A  r  e  a  =   3  8    (  s  u  m  .  .  o  f  .  .  p  r  o  d  u  c  t  s  )      fragments  A  r  e  a     3  8    fragments  normal-(  s  u  m  normal-.  normal-.  o  f  normal-.  normal-.  p  r  o  d  u  c  t  s  normal-)     Area=\frac{3}{8}(sum..of..products)     (Figure)  Simpson's Second Rule   Simpson's 3rd rule  Also known as the 5 - 8 -1 rule 4      A  r  e  a   =    h  12    (     5  a   +   8  b    -  c   )          A  r  e  a       h  12         5  a     8  b    c      Area=\frac{h}{12}(5a+8b-c)     Use of Simpsons rules  Simpson's rules are used to calculate the volume of lifeboats , 5 and by surveyors to calculate the volume of sludge in a ship's oil tanks. For instance, in the latter, Simpson's 3rd rule is used to find the volume between two co-ordinates. To calculate the entire area / volume, Simpson's first rule is used. 6  References  "  Category:Naval architecture     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
