Use of Simpsons rules
Simpson's rules are used to calculate the volume of lifeboats,5 and by surveyors to calculate the volume of sludge in a ship's oil tanks. For instance, in the latter, Simpson's 3rd rule is used to find the volume between two co-ordinates. To calculate the entire area / volume, Simpson's first rule is used.6
