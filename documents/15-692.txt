   Rank of a partition      Rank of a partition   In mathematics , particularly in the fields of number theory and combinatorics , the rank of a partition of a positive integer is a certain integer associated with the partition . In fact at least two different definitions of rank appear in the literature. The first definition, with which most of this article is concerned, is that the rank of a partition is the number obtained by subtracting the number of parts in the partition from the largest part in the partition. The concept was introduced by Freeman Dyson in a paper published in the journal Eureka . 1 It was presented in the context of a study of certain congruence properties of the partition function discovered by the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan . A different concept, sharing the same name, is used in combinatorics, where the rank is taken to be the size of the Durfee square of the partition.  Definition  By a partition of a positive integer n we mean a finite multiset λ = { λ k , λ k − 1 , . . . , λ 1 } of positive integers satisfying the following two conditions:   λ k ≥ . . . ≥ λ 2 ≥ λ 1 > 0.  λ k + . . . + λ 2 + λ 1 = n .   If λ k , . . . , λ 2 , λ 1 are distinct, that is, if   λ k > . . . > λ 2 > λ 1 > 0   the partition λ is called a strict partition of n . The integers λ k , λ k − 1 , ..., λ 1 are the parts of the partition. The number of parts in the partition λ is k and the largest part in the partition is λ k . The rank of the partition λ (whether ordinary or strict) is defined as λ k − k . 2  The ranks of the partitions of n take the following values and no others: 3   n − 1, n −3, n −4, . . . , 2, 1, 0, −1, −2, . . . , −( n − 4), −( n − 3), −( n − 1).   The following table gives the ranks of the various partitions of the number 5.

Let n , q be a positive integers and m be any integer.   The total number of partitions of n is denoted by p ( n ).  The number of partitions of n with rank m is denoted by N ( m , n ).  The number of partitions of n with rank congruent to m modulo q is denoted by N ( m , q , n ).  The number of strict partitions of n is denoted by Q ( n ).  The number of strict partitions of n with rank m is denoted by R ( m , n ).  The number of strict partitions of n with rank congruent to m modulo q is denoted by T ( m , q , n ).   For example,   p (5) = 7 , N (2, 5) = 1 , N (3, 5) = 0 , N (2, 2, 5) = 5 .  Q (5) = 3 , R (2, 5) = 1 , R (3, 5) = 0 , T (2, 2, 5) = 2.   Some basic results  Let n , q be a positive integers and m be any integer. 4        N   (  m  ,  n  )    =   N   (   -  m   ,  n  )          N   m  n      N     m   n      N(m,n)=N(-m,n)          N   (  m  ,  q  ,  n  )    =   N   (   q  -  m   ,  q  ,  n  )          N   m  q  n      N     q  m   q  n      N(m,q,n)=N(q-m,q,n)          N   (  m  ,  q  ,  n  )    =    ∑   r  =   -  ∞    ∞    N   (   m  +   r  q    ,  n  )           N   m  q  n      superscript   subscript     r            N     m    r  q    n       N(m,q,n)=\sum_{r=-\infty}^{\infty}N(m+rq,n)      Ramanujan's congruences and Dyson's conjecture  Srinivasa Ramanujan in a paper published in 1919 proved the following congruences involving the partition function p ( n ): 5   p (5 n + 4) ≡ 0 (mod 5)  p (7 n + 5) ≡ 0 (mod 7)  p (11 n + 6) ≡ 0 (mod 11)   In commenting on this result, Dyson noted that " . . . although we can prove that the partitions of 5 n + 4 can be divided into five equally numerous subclasses, it is unsatisfactory to receive from the proofs no concrete idea of how the division is to be made. We require a proof which will not appeal to generating functions, . . . ". 6 Dyson introduced the idea of rank of a partition to accomplish the task he set for himself. Using this new idea, he made the following conjectures:   N (0, 5, 5 n + 4) = N (1, 5, 5 n + 4) = N (2, 5, 5 n + 4) = N (3, 5, 5 n + 4) = N (4, 5, 5 n + 4)  N (0, 7, 7 n + 5) = N (1, 7, 7 n + 5) = N (2, 7, 7 n + 5) = . . . = N (6, 7, 7 n + 5)   These conjectures were proved by Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer in 1954. 7  The following tables show how the partitions of the integers 4 (5 × n + 4 with n = 0) and 9 (5 × n + 4 with n = 1 ) get divided into five equally numerous subclasses.

 {(1-zq)(1-zq^{2})\cdots(1-zq^{s})}        Alternate definition  In combinatorics, the phrase rank of a partition is sometimes used to describe a different concept: the rank of a partition λ is the largest integer i such that λ has at least i parts each of which is no smaller than i . 12 Equivalently, this is the length of the main diagonal in the Young diagram or Ferrers diagram for λ, or the side-length of the Durfee square of λ.
