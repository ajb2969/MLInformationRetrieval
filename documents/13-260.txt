Iterative refinement

Iterative refinement is an iterative method proposed by James H. Wilkinson to improve the accuracy of numerical solutions to systems of linear equations.
When solving a linear system  b}}, due to the presence of rounding errors, the computed solution  may sometimes deviate from the exact solution . Starting with  x̂}}, iterative refinement computes a sequence  which converges to  when certain assumptions are met.
Description
For  1,2,…}}, the 
 
 
 
 th iteration of iterative refinement consists of three steps:

Compute the residual
 b − Axm}}
Solve the system
 rm}}
Add the correction

Error analysis
As a rule of thumb, iterative refinement for Gaussian elimination produces a solution correct to working precision if double the working precision is used in the computation of , e.g. by using quad or double extended precision IEEE 754 floating point, and if  is not too ill-conditioned (and the iteration and the rate of convergence are determined by the condition number of ).1
More formally, assuming that each solve step is reasonably accurate, i.e., in mathematical terms, for every , we have

and implies that  and  are of order unity.
The distinction of  and  is intended to allow mixed-precision evaluation of  where intermediate results are computed with unit round-off  before the final result is rounded (or truncated) with unit round-off . All other computations are assumed to be carried out with unit round-off .
