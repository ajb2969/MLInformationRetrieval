   Iterative refinement      Iterative refinement   Iterative refinement is an iterative method proposed by James H. Wilkinson to improve the accuracy of numerical solutions to systems of linear equations .  When solving a linear system  b }} , due to the presence of rounding errors , the computed solution may sometimes deviate from the exact solution . Starting with  x ̂ }} , iterative refinement computes a sequence which converges to when certain assumptions are met.  Description  For 1,2,…}} , the   m   m   m   th iteration of iterative refinement consists of three steps:   Compute the residual   b − Ax m }}  Solve the system   r m }}  Add the correction   x m + d m }}   Error analysis  As a rule of thumb, iterative refinement for Gaussian elimination produces a solution correct to working precision if double the working precision is used in the computation of , e.g. by using quad or double extended precision IEEE 754  floating point , and if is not too ill-conditioned (and the iteration and the rate of convergence are determined by the condition number of ). 1  More formally, assuming that each solve step is reasonably accurate, i.e., in mathematical terms, for every , we have    r m }}    where , the relative error in the   m   m   m   th iterate of iterative refinement satisfies         ∥    𝒙  m   -   𝒙  ∗    ∥   ∞     ∥   𝒙  ∗   ∥   ∞    ≤     (   σ   κ  ∞    (  𝑨  )    ε  1    )   m   +    μ  1    ε  1    +    μ  2   n   κ  ∞    (  𝑨  )    ε  2            subscript   norm     subscript  𝒙  m    superscript  𝒙  normal-∗        subscript   norm   superscript  𝒙  normal-∗          superscript    σ   subscript  κ    𝑨   subscript  ε  1    m      subscript  μ  1    subscript  ε  1       subscript  μ  2   n   subscript  κ    𝑨   subscript  ε  2       \frac{\lVert\boldsymbol{x}_{m}-\boldsymbol{x}^{\ast}\rVert_{\infty}}{\lVert%

The distinction of and is intended to allow mixed-precision evaluation of where intermediate results are computed with unit round-off before the final result is rounded (or truncated) with unit round-off . All other computations are assumed to be carried out with unit round-off .  Notes  References      "  Category:Numerical linear algebra     ↩
