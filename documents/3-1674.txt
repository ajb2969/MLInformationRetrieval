Quasi-arithmetic mean




Quasi-arithmetic mean

In mathematics and statistics, the quasi-arithmetic mean or generalised f-mean is one generalisation of the more familiar means such as the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, using a function 
 
 
 
 . It is also called Kolmogorov mean after Russian scientist Andrey Kolmogorov.
Definition
If f is a function which maps an interval 
 
 
 
  of the real line to the real numbers, and is both continuous and injective then we can define the f-mean of two numbers


 
  as



For 
 
 
 
  numbers


 
 , the f-mean is



We require f to be injective in order for the inverse function

 
  to exist. Since 
 
 
 
 
  is defined over an interval, 
 
 
 
  lies within the domain of 
 
 
 
 .
Since f is injective and continuous, it follows that f is a strictly monotonic function, and therefore that the f-mean is neither larger than the largest number of the tuple 
 
 
 
  nor smaller than the smallest number in 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

If 
 
 
 
 
  = ℝ, the real line, and 
 
 
 
 , (or indeed any linear function 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  not equal to 0) then the f-mean corresponds to the arithmetic mean.


If 
 
 
 
  = ℝ+, the positive real numbers and 
 
 
 
 
 , then the f-mean corresponds to the geometric mean. According to the f-mean properties, the result does not depend on the base of the logarithm as long as it is positive and not 1.


If 
 
 
 
  = ℝ+ and 
 
 
 
 , then the f-mean corresponds to the harmonic mean.


If 
 
 
 
  = ℝ+ and 
 
 
 
 , then the f-mean corresponds to the power mean with exponent 
 
 
 
 
 .


If 
 
 
 
  = ℝ and 
 
 
 
 , then the f-mean is a constant shifted version of the LogSumExp (LSE) function, 
 
 
 
 . The LogSumExp function is used as a smooth approximation to the maximum function.

Properties

Partitioning: The computation of the mean can be split into computations of equal sized sub-blocks.







M_f(x_1,\dots,x_{n\cdot k}) =
 M_f(M_f(x_1,\dots,x_{k}),
     M_f(x_{k+1},\dots,x_{2\cdot k}),
     \dots,
     M_f(x_{(n-1)\cdot k + 1},\dots,x_{n\cdot k}))


Subsets of elements can be averaged a priori, without altering the mean, given that the multiplicity of elements is maintained.

The quasi-arithmetic mean is invariant with respect to offsets and scaling of

If 
 
 
 
  is monotonic, then 
 
 
 
  is monotonic.
Any quasi-arithmetic mean 
 
 
 
 
  of two variables has the mediality property

 
  and the self-distributivity property 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, any of those properties is essentially sufficient to characterize quasi-arithmetic means; see Aczél–Dhombres, Chapter 17.
Any quasi-arithmetic mean 
 
 
 
  of two variables has the balancing property

 
 . An interesting problem is whether this condition (together with fixed-point, symmetry, monotonicity and continuity properties) implies that the mean is quasi-arthmetic. Georg Aumann showed in the 1930s that the answer is no in general,1 but that if one additionally assumes 
 
 
 
 
  to be an analytic function then the answer is positive.2

Homogeneity
Means are usually homogeneous, but for most functions 
 
 
 
 , the f-mean is not. Indeed, the only homogeneous quasi-arithmetic means are the power means and the geometric mean; see Hardy–Littlewood–Pólya, page 68.
The homogeneity property can be achieved by normalizing the input values by some (homogeneous) mean 
 
 
 
 .


 
  However this modification may violate monotonicity and the partitioning property of the mean.
