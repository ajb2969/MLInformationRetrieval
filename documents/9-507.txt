Markov brothers' inequality
In [[mathematics]], the '''Markov brothers' inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] proved in the 1890s by [[Andrey Markov]] and [[Vladimir Andreevich Markov|Vladimir Markov]], two Russian mathematicians and brothers. This inequality bounds the maximum of the [[derivative]]s of a polynomial on an interval in terms of the maximum of the polynomial.{{cite book|last=A

The statement
Let P be a polynomial of degree â‰¤ n. Then



Equality is attained for Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.
