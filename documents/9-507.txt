   Markov brothers' inequality      Markov brothers' inequality  In [[mathematics]], the '''Markov brothers' inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] proved in the 1890s by [[Andrey Markov]] and [[Vladimir Andreevich Markov|Vladimir Markov]], two Russian mathematicians and brothers. This inequality bounds the maximum of the [[derivative]]s of a polynomial on an interval in terms of the maximum of the polynomial. {{cite book|last=A chiezer|first=N.I.|authorlink=Naum Akhiezer|title=Theory of approximation|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc.|location=New York|year=1992}} For k = 1 it was proved by Andrey Markov, 1 and for k = 2,3,... by his brother Vladimir Markov. 2  The statement  Let P be a polynomial of degree ≤ n . Then         max    -  1   ≤  x  ≤  1     |    P   (  k  )     (  x  )    |    ≤      n  2    (    n  2   -   1  2    )    (    n  2   -   2  2    )   ⋯   (    n  2   -    (   k  -  1   )   2    )      1  ⋅  3  ⋅  5   ⋯   (    2  k   -  1   )       max    -  1   ≤  x  ≤  1     |   P   (  x  )    |      .        subscript         1   x       1          superscript  P  k   x            superscript  n  2      superscript  n  2    superscript  1  2       superscript  n  2    superscript  2  2    normal-⋯     superscript  n  2    superscript    k  1   2        normal-⋅  1  3  5   normal-⋯      2  k   1       subscript         1   x       1         P  x        \max_{-1\leq x\leq 1}|P^{(k)}(x)|\leq\frac{n^{2}(n^{2}-1^{2})(n^{2}-2^{2})%
 \cdots(n^{2}-(k-1)^{2})}{1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdots(2k-1)}\max_{-1\leq x\leq 1}|P(x%
 )|.     Equality is attained for Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.
