   Representation of a Lie group      Representation of a Lie group   In mathematics and theoretical physics , the idea of a representation of a Lie group plays an important role in the study of continuous symmetry . A Lie group is defined in abstract terms as a group, which is also a differentiable manifold , 1 but in applications it's often more useful to have concrete objects, like matrices, that represent each element of the group. A representation is a map that maps each (abstract) element of the Lie group to a concrete object, like a matrix, that represents the object.  Representations on a complex finite-dimensional vector space  Let us first discuss representations acting on finite-dimensional complex vector spaces. A representation of a Lie group  G on a finite-dimensional complex vector space  V is a smooth group homomorphism Œ®: G ‚ÜíAut( V ) from G to the automorphism group of V .  For n -dimensional V , the automorphism group of V is identified with a subset of the complex square matrices of order n . The automorphism group of V is given the structure of a smooth manifold using this identification. The condition that Œ® is smooth, in the definition above, means that Œ® is a smooth map from the smooth manifold G to the smooth manifold Aut( V ).  If a basis for the complex vector space V is chosen, the representation can be expressed as a homomorphism into general linear group GL( n , C ). This is known as a matrix representation .  Representations on a finite-dimensional vector space over an arbitrary field  A representation of a Lie group  G on a vector space  V (over a field  K ) is a smooth (i.e. respecting the differential structure) group homomorphism  G ‚ÜíAut( V ) from G to the automorphism group of V . If a basis for the vector space V is chosen, the representation can be expressed as a homomorphism into general linear group GL( n , K ). This is known as a matrix representation . Two representations of G on vector spaces V , W are equivalent if they have the same matrix representations with respect to some choices of bases for V and W .  On the Lie algebra level, there is a corresponding linear mapping from the Lie algebra of G to End( V ) preserving the Lie bracket [¬†,¬†]. See representation of Lie algebras for the Lie algebra theory.  If the homomorphism is in fact a monomorphism , the representation is said to be faithful .  A unitary representation is defined in the same way, except that G maps to unitary matrices ; the Lie algebra will then map to skew-hermitian matrices.  If G is a compact Lie group , every finite-dimensional representation is equivalent to a unitary one.  Representations on Hilbert spaces  A representation of a Lie group  G on a complex Hilbert space  V is a group homomorphism Œ®: G ‚Üí B( V ) from G to B( V ), the group of bounded linear operators of V which have a bounded inverse, such that the map G √ó V ‚Üí V given by ( g , v ) ‚Üí Œ®( g ) v is continuous.  This definition can handle representations on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Such representations can be found in e.g. quantum mechanics , but also in Fourier analysis as shown in the following example.  Let G = R , and let the complex Hilbert space V be L 2 ( R ). We define the representation Œ®: R ‚Üí B( L 2 ( R )) by Œ®( r ){ f ( x )} ‚Üí f ( r ‚àí1 x ).  See also Wigner's classification for representations of the Poincar√© group .  Classification  If G is a semisimple group, its finite-dimensional representations can be decomposed as direct sums of irreducible representations . The irreducibles are indexed by highest weight ; the allowable ( dominant ) highest weights satisfy a suitable positivity condition. In particular, there exists a set of fundamental weights , indexed by the vertices of the Dynkin diagram of G, such that dominant weights are simply non-negative integer linear combinations of the fundamental weights. The characters of the irreducible representations are given by the Weyl character formula .  If G is a commutative Lie group , then its irreducible representations are simply the continuous characters of G: see Pontryagin duality for this case.  A quotient representation is a quotient module of the group ring .  Formulaic examples  Let F q be a finite field of order q and characteristic p . Let G be a finite group of Lie type, that is, G is the F q -rational points of a connected reductive group G defined over F q . For example, if n is a positive integer GL( n , F q ) and SL(n, F q ) are finite groups of Lie type. Let    J  =   [     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     ]       J   delimited-[]    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0       J=\left[\begin{smallmatrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\end{smallmatrix}\right]   , where I n is the n √ó n identity matrix. Let      S   p  2    (   ùîΩ  q   )   =   {  g  ‚àà  G   L   2  n     (   ùîΩ  q   )    ‚à£  t   g  J  g  =  J  }   .     fragments  S   subscript  p  2    fragments  normal-(   subscript  ùîΩ  q   normal-)     fragments  normal-{  g   G   subscript  L    2  n     fragments  normal-(   subscript  ùîΩ  q   normal-)    superscript  normal-‚à£  t   g  J  g   J  normal-}   normal-.    Sp_{2}(\mathbb{F}_{q})=\left\{g\in GL_{2n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})\mid^{t}gJg=J\right\}.     Then Sp(2, F q ) is a symplectic group of rank n and is a finite group of Lie type. For G = GL( n , F q ) or SL( n , F q ) (and some other examples), the standard Borel subgroup  B of G is the subgroup of G consisting of the upper triangular elements in G . A standard parabolic subgroup of G is a subgroup of G which contains the standard Borel subgroup B . If P is a standard parabolic subgroup of GL( n , F q ), then there exists a partition ( n 1 , ‚Ä¶, n r ) of n (a set of positive integers    n  j     subscript  n  j    n_{j}\,\!   such that      n  1   +  ‚Ä¶  +   n  r    =  n         subscript  n  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  n  r    n    n_{1}+\ldots+n_{r}=n\,\!   ) such that    P  =   P   (   n  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   n  r   )    =   M  √ó  N         P   subscript  P    subscript  n  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  n  r            M  N      P=P_{(n_{1},\ldots,n_{r})}=M\times N   , where    M  ‚âÉ     G   L   n  1     (   ùîΩ  q   )    √ó  ‚Ä¶  √ó  G    L   n  r     (   ùîΩ  q   )       similar-to-or-equals  M        G   subscript  L   subscript  n  1     subscript  ùîΩ  q    normal-‚Ä¶  G    subscript  L   subscript  n  r     subscript  ùîΩ  q      M\simeq GL_{n_{1}}(\mathbb{F}_{q})\times\ldots\times GL_{n_{r}}(\mathbb{F}_{q})   has the form       M  =   {   (      A  1     0    ‚ãØ    0      0     A  2     ‚ãØ    0      ‚ãÆ    ‚ã±    ‚ã±    ‚ãÆ      0    ‚ãØ    0     A  r      )   |     A  j   ‚àà   G   L   n  j     (   ùîΩ  q   )     ,   1  ‚â§  j  ‚â§  r    }    ,      M   conditional-set     subscript  A  1   0  normal-‚ãØ  0    0   subscript  A  2   normal-‚ãØ  0    normal-‚ãÆ  normal-‚ã±  normal-‚ã±  normal-‚ãÆ    0  normal-‚ãØ  0   subscript  A  r      formulae-sequence     subscript  A  j     G   subscript  L   subscript  n  j     subscript  ùîΩ  q         1  j       r        M=\left\{\left.\begin{pmatrix}A_{1}&0&\cdots&0\\
