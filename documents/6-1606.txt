   Hahn decomposition theorem      Hahn decomposition theorem   In mathematics , the Hahn decomposition theorem , named after the Austrian  mathematician  Hans Hahn , states that given a measurable space ( X ,Σ) and a signed measure  μ defined on the σ-algebra Σ, there exist two measurable sets P and N in Σ such that:   P ∪ N = X and P ∩ N = ∅.  For each E in Σ such that E ⊆ P one has μ ( E ) ≥ 0; that is, P is a positive set for μ .  For each E in Σ such that E ⊆ N one has μ ( E ) ≤ 0; that is, N is a negative set for μ .   Moreover, this decomposition is essentially unique , in the sense that for any other pair ( P ', N ') of measurable sets fulfilling the above three conditions, the symmetric differences  P Δ P ' and N Δ N ' are μ - null sets in the strong sense that every measurable subset of them has zero measure. The pair ( P , N ) is called a Hahn decomposition of the signed measure μ .  Jordan measure decomposition  A consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the Jordan decomposition theorem , which states that every signed measure μ has a unique decomposition into a difference μ = μ + − μ − of two positive measures μ + and μ − , at least one of which is finite, such that μ + (E) = 0 if E ⊆ N and μ − (E) = 0 if E ⊆ P for any Hahn decomposition (P,N) of μ. μ + and μ − are called the positive and negative part of μ , respectively. The pair ( μ + , μ − ) is called a Jordan decomposition (or sometimes Hahn–Jordan decomposition ) of μ . The two measures can be defined as        μ  +    (  E  )    :=   μ   (   E  ∩  P   )       assign     superscript  μ    E     μ    E  P      \mu^{+}(E):=\mu(E\cap P)\,   and        μ  -    (  E  )    :=   -   μ   (   E  ∩  N   )        assign     superscript  μ    E       μ    E  N       \mu^{-}(E):=-\mu(E\cap N)\,   for every E in Σ and any Hahn decomposition (P,N) of μ.  Note that the Jordan decomposition is unique, while the Hahn decomposition is only essentially unique.  The Jordan decomposition has the following corollary: Given a Jordan decomposition (μ + , μ − ) of a finite signed measure μ,        μ  +    (  E  )    =    sup    B  ∈  Σ   ,   B  ⊂  E      μ   (  B  )            superscript  μ    E     subscript  supremum   formulae-sequence    B  normal-Σ     B  E       μ  B      \mu^{+}(E)=\sup_{B\in\Sigma,B\subset E}\mu(B)   and        μ  -    (  E  )    =   -    inf    B  ∈  Σ   ,   B  ⊂  E      μ   (  B  )             superscript  μ    E       subscript  infimum   formulae-sequence    B  normal-Σ     B  E       μ  B       \mu^{-}(E)=-\inf_{B\in\Sigma,B\subset E}\mu(B)   for any E in Σ. Also, if μ = ν + − ν − for a pair of finite non-negative measures (ν + , ν − ), then        ν  +   ≥    μ  +   and   ν  -    ≥   μ  -    .         superscript  ν       superscript  μ    and   superscript  ν           superscript  μ       \nu^{+}\geq\mu^{+}\text{ and }\nu^{-}\geq\mu^{-}.   The last expression means that the Jordan decomposition is the minimal decomposition of μ into a difference of non-negative measures. This is the minimality property of the Jordan decomposition.  Proof of the Jordan decomposition: For an elementary proof of the existence, uniqueness, and minimality of the Jordan measure decomposition see Fischer (2012) .  Proof of the Hahn decomposition theorem  Preparation: Assume that μ does not take the value −∞ (otherwise decompose according to − μ ). As mentioned above, a negative set is a set A in Σ such that μ ( B ) ≤ 0 for every B in Σ which is a subset of A .  Claim: Suppose that a set D in Σ satisfies μ ( D ) ≤ 0. Then there is a negative set A ⊆ D such that μ ( A ) ≤ μ ( D ).  Proof of the claim: Define A 0 = D . Inductively assume for a natural number n that A n ⊆ D has been constructed. Let       t  n   =   sup   {   μ   (  B  )    :    B  ∈  Σ   ,   B  ⊂   A  n     }         subscript  t  n    supremum   conditional-set    μ  B    formulae-sequence    B  normal-Σ     B   subscript  A  n         t_{n}=\sup\{\mu(B):B\in\Sigma,\,B\subset A_{n}\}     denote the supremum of μ ( B ) for all the measurable subsets B of A n . This supremum might a priori be infinite. Since the empty set ∅ is a possible B in the definition of t n and μ (∅) = 0, we have t n ≥ 0. By definition of t n there exists a B n ⊆ A n in Σ satisfying        μ   (   B  n   )    ≥   min   {  1  ,    t  n   /  2   }     .        μ   subscript  B  n      1     subscript  t  n   2      \mu(B_{n})\geq\min\{1,t_{n}/2\}.     Set A n +1 = A n \ B n to finish the induction step. Define       A  =   D  ∖    ⋃   n  =  0   ∞    B  n      .      A    D    superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  B  n       A=D\setminus\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n}.     Since the sets ( B n ) n ≥0 are disjoint subsets of D , it follows from the sigma additivity of the signed measure μ that        μ   (  A  )    =    μ   (  D  )    -    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    μ   (   B  n   )      ≤    μ   (  D  )    -    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    min   {  1  ,    t  n   /  2   }       .          μ  A       μ  D     superscript   subscript     n  0        μ   subscript  B  n               μ  D     superscript   subscript     n  0        1     subscript  t  n   2         \mu(A)=\mu(D)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu(B_{n})\leq\mu(D)-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\min%
 \{1,t_{n}/2\}.     This shows that μ ( A ) ≤ μ ( D ). Assume A were not a negative set. That means there exists a B in Σ which is a subset of A and satisfies μ ( B ) > 0. Then t n ≥ μ ( B ) for every n , hence the series on the right has to diverge to +∞, which means μ ( A ) = –∞, which is not allowed. Therefore, A must be a negative set.  Construction of the decomposition: Set N 0 = ∅. Inductively, given N n , define        s  n   :=   inf   {   μ   (  D  )    :    D  ∈  Σ   ,   D  ⊂   X  ∖   N  n      }     .     assign   subscript  s  n    infimum   conditional-set    μ  D    formulae-sequence    D  normal-Σ     D    X   subscript  N  n          s_{n}:=\inf\{\mu(D):D\in\Sigma,\,D\subset X\setminus N_{n}\}.     as the infimum of μ ( D ) for all the measurable subsets D of X \ N n . This infimum might a priori be –∞. Since the empty set is a possible D and μ (∅) = 0, we have s n ≤ 0. Hence there exists a D n in Σ with D n ⊆ X \ N n and       μ   (   D  n   )    ≤   max   {    s  n   /  2   ,   -  1   }    ≤  0.          μ   subscript  D  n         subscript  s  n   2     1         0.     \mu(D_{n})\leq\max\{s_{n}/2,-1\}\leq 0.     By the claim above, there is a negative set A n ⊆ D n such that μ ( A n ) ≤ μ ( D n ). Define N n +1 = N n ∪ A n to finish the induction step.  Define       N  =    ⋃   n  =  0   ∞    A  n     .      N    superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  A  n      N=\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty}A_{n}.     Since the sets ( A n ) n ≥0 are disjoint, we have for every B ⊆ N in Σ that       μ   (  B  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    μ   (   B  ∩   A  n    )           μ  B     superscript   subscript     n  0        μ    B   subscript  A  n        \mu(B)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu(B\cap A_{n})     by the sigma additivity of μ . In particular, this shows that N is a negative set. Define P = X \ N . If P were not a positive set, there exists a D ⊆ P in Σ with μ ( D ) n'' ≤ μ ( D ) for all n and        μ   (  N  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    μ   (   A  n   )     ≤    ∑   n  =  0   ∞    max   {    s  n   /  2   ,   -  1   }     =   -  ∞    ,          μ  N     superscript   subscript     n  0        μ   subscript  A  n            superscript   subscript     n  0           subscript  s  n   2     1                 \mu(N)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\mu(A_{n})\leq\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\max\{s_{n}/2,-1\}=%
 -\infty,     which is not allowed for μ . Therefore, P is a positive set.  Proof of the uniqueness statement: Suppose that    (   N  ′   ,   P  ′   )      superscript  N  normal-′    superscript  P  normal-′     (N^{\prime},P^{\prime})   is another Hahn decomposition of   X   X   X   . Then    P  ∩   N  ′       P   superscript  N  normal-′     P\cap N^{\prime}   is a positive set and also a negative set. Therefore, every measurable subset of it has measure zero. The same applies to    N  ∩   P  ′       N   superscript  P  normal-′     N\cap P^{\prime}   . Since         P    △    P  ′    =    N    △    N  ′    =    (   P  ∩   N  ′    )   ∪   (   N  ∩   P  ′    )     ,          P  normal-△   superscript  P  normal-′      N  normal-△   superscript  N  normal-′             P   superscript  N  normal-′      N   superscript  P  normal-′        P\,\triangle\,P^{\prime}=N\,\triangle\,N^{\prime}=(P\cap N^{\prime})\cup(N\cap
