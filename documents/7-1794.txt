Banach function algebra

In functional analysis a Banach function algebra on a compact Hausdorff space X is unital subalgebra, A of the commutative C*-algebra C(X) of all continuous, complex valued functions from X, together with a norm on A which makes it a Banach algebra.
A function algebra is said to vanish at a point p if f(p) = 0 for all 
 
 
 
 . A function algebra separates points if for each distinct pair of points 
 
 
 
 , there is a function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
For every 
 
 
 
  define 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a non-zero homomorphism (character) on 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem: A Banach function algebra is semisimple (that is its Jacobson radical is equal to zero) and each commutative unital, semisimple Banach algebra is isomorphic (via the Gelfand transform) to a Banach function algebra on its character space (the space of algebra homomorphisms from A into the complex numbers given the relative weak* topology).
If the norm on 
 
 
 
  is the uniform norm (or sup-norm) on 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is called a uniform algebra. Uniform algebras are an important special case of Banach function algebras.
