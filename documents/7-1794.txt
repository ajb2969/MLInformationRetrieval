   Banach function algebra      Banach function algebra   In functional analysis a Banach function algebra on a compact  Hausdorff space  X is unital  subalgebra , A of the commutative  C*-algebra  C(X) of all continuous , complex valued functions from X , together with a norm on A which makes it a Banach algebra .  A function algebra is said to vanish at a point p if f(p) = 0 for all    (   f  ∈  A   )      f  A    (f\in A)   . A function algebra separates points if for each distinct pair of points    (    p  ,  q   ∈  X   )       p  q   X    (p,q\in X)   , there is a function    (   f  ∈  A   )      f  A    (f\in A)   such that     f   (  p  )    ≠   f   (  q  )          f  p     f  q     f(p)\neq f(q)   .  For every    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   define     ε  x    (  f  )   =  f   (  x  )    (  f  ∈  A  )      fragments   subscript  ε  x    fragments  normal-(  f  normal-)    f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  f   A  normal-)     \varepsilon_{x}(f)=f(x)\ (f\in A)   . Then    ε  x     subscript  ε  x    \varepsilon_{x}   is a non-zero homomorphism (character) on   A   A   A   .  Theorem: A Banach function algebra is semisimple (that is its Jacobson radical is equal to zero) and each commutative unital , semisimple Banach algebra is isomorphic (via the Gelfand transform ) to a Banach function algebra on its character space (the space of algebra homomorphisms from A into the complex numbers given the relative  weak* topology ).  If the norm on   A   A   A   is the uniform norm (or sup-norm) on   X   X   X   , then   A   A   A   is called a uniform algebra . Uniform algebras are an important special case of Banach function algebras.  References   H.G. Dales Banach algebras and automatic continuity   "  Category:Banach algebras
