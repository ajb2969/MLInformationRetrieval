   Method of distinguished element      Method of distinguished element   In enumerative combinatorial  mathematics , identities are sometimes established by arguments that rely on singling out one "distinguished element" of a set.  Definition  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be a family of subsets of the set   A   A   A   and let    x  ∈  A      x  A    x\in A   be a distinguished element of set   A   A   A   . Then suppose there is a predicate    P   (  X  ,  x  )       P   X  x     P(X,x)   that relates a subset    X  ⊆  A      X  A    X\subseteq A   to   x   x   x   . Denote    𝒜   (  x  )       𝒜  x    \mathcal{A}(x)   to be the set of subsets   X   X   X   from   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   for which    P   (  X  ,  x  )       P   X  x     P(X,x)   is true and    𝒜  -  x      𝒜  x    \mathcal{A}-x   to be the set of subsets   X   X   X   from   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   for which    P   (  X  ,  x  )       P   X  x     P(X,x)   is false, Then    𝒜   (  x  )       𝒜  x    \mathcal{A}(x)   and    𝒜  -  x      𝒜  x    \mathcal{A}-x   are disjoint sets, so by the method of summation, the cardinalities are additive 1       |  𝒜  |   =    |   𝒜   (  x  )    |   +   |   𝒜  -  x   |          𝒜         𝒜  x        𝒜  x       |\mathcal{A}|=|\mathcal{A}(x)|+|\mathcal{A}-x|     Thus the distinguished element allows for a decomposition according to a predicate that is a simple form of a divide and conquer algorithm . In combinatorics, this allows for the construction of recurrence relations . Examples are in the next section.  Examples   The binomial coefficient     (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   is the number of size- k subsets of a size- n set. A basic identity, one of whose consequences is that these are precisely the numbers appearing in Pascal's triangle , states that:            (      n       k  -  1       )   +   (      n      k      )    =   (       n  +  1       k      )    .         binomial  n    k  1     binomial  n  k     binomial    n  1   k     {n\choose k-1}+{n\choose k}={n+1\choose k}.         Proof: In a size-( n + 1) set, choose one distinguished element. The set of all size- k subsets contains: (1) all size- k subsets that do contain the distinguished element, and (2) all size- k subsets that do not contain the distinguished element. If a size- k subset of a size-( n + 1) set does contain the distinguished element, then its other k − 1 elements are chosen from among the other n elements of our size-( n + 1) set. The number of ways to choose those is therefore    (      n       k  -  1       )     binomial  n    k  1     {n\choose k-1}   . If a size- k subset does not contain the distinguished element, then all of its k members are chosen from among the other n "non-distinguished" elements. The number of ways to choose those is therefore    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   .    The number of subsets of any size- n set is 2 n .    Proof: We use mathematical induction . The basis for induction is the truth of this proposition in case n = 0. The empty set has 0 members and 1 subset, and 2 0 = 1. The induction hypothesis is the proposition in case n ; we use it to prove case n + 1. In a size-( n + 1) set, choose a distinguished element. Each subset either contains the distinguished element or does not. If a subset contains the distinguished element, then its remaining elements are chosen from among the other n elements. By the induction hypothesis, the number of ways to do that is 2 n . If a subset does not contain the distinguished element, then it is a subset of the set of all non-distinguished elements. By the induction hypothesis, the number of such subsets is 2 n . Finally, the whole list of subsets of our size-( n + 1) set contains 2 n + 2 n = 2 n +1 elements.    Let B n be the n th Bell number , i.e., the number of partitions of a set of n members. Let C n be the total number of "parts" (or "blocks", as combinatorialists often call them) among all partitions of that set. For example, the partitions of the size-3 set { a , b , c } may be written thus:            a  b  c         a  /  b   c         b  /  a   c         c  /  a   b        a  /  b  /  c           a  b  c         a  b   c         b  a   c         c  a   b       a  b  c      \begin{matrix}abc\\
 a/bc\\
 b/ac\\
 c/ab\\
 a/b/c\end{matrix}         We see 5 partitions, containing 10 blocks, so B 3 = 5 and C 3 = 10. An identity states:            B  n   +   C  n    =   B   n  +  1     .         subscript  B  n    subscript  C  n     subscript  B    n  1      B_{n}+C_{n}=B_{n+1}.\,         Proof: In a size-( n + 1) set, choose a distinguished element. In each partition of our size-( n + 1) set, either the distinguished element is a "singleton", i.e., the set containing only the distinguished element is one of the blocks, or the distinguished element belongs to a larger block. If the distinguished element is a singleton, then deletion of the distinguished element leaves a partition of the set containing the n non-distinguished elements. There are B n ways to do that. If the distinguished element belongs to a larger block, then its deletion leaves a block in a partition of the set containing the n non-distinguished elements. There are C n such blocks.
