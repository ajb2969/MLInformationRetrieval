   Least distance of distinct vision      Least distance of distinct vision   In optometry , the least distance of distinct vision (LDDV) or the reference seeing distance (RSD) is the closest someone with "normal" vision ( 20/20 vision ) can comfortably look at something. In other words LDDV is the minimum comfortable distance between the naked human eye and a visible object.  g power ( M ) of a lens with focal length ( f in millimeters) when viewed by the naked human eye:       M  =   250  f    .      M    250  f     {M}=\frac{250}{f}.     See also   Optometry  Far point  Snellen chart  Visual perception  Visual impairment   "  Category:Optometry
