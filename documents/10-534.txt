   Sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase      Sn-glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a sn -glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sn-glycerol 1-phosphate + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerone phosphate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycerol 1-phosphate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are glycerone phosphate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycerol-1-phosphate:NAD(P) + 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(P) + ] .  G-1-P dehydrogenase is responsible for the formation of sn -glycerol 1-phosphate, the backbone of the membrane phospholipids of Archaea. The gene encoding glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase has been detected in all the archaeal species and has not been found in any bacterial or eukaryal species. sn -glycerol 1-phosphate produced by this enzyme is the most fundamental difference by which Archaea and bacteria are discriminated.
