Antieigenvalue theory

In applied mathematics, antieigenvalue theory was developed by Karl Gustafson from 1966 to 1968. The theory is applicable to numerical analysis, wavelets, statistics, quantum mechanics, finance and optimization.
The antieigenvectors 
 
 
 
  are the vectors most turned by a matrix or operator 
 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding antieigenvalue 
 
 
 
  is the cosine of the maximal turning angle. The maximal turning angle is 
 
 
 
  and is called the angle of the operator. Just like the eigenvalues which may be ordered as a spectrum from smallest to largest, the theory of antieigenvalues orders the antieigenvalues of an operator A from the smallest to the largest turning angles.
The theory of antieigenvalues addresses the stability problem of eigenvalues.
