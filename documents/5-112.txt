   Trouton's ratio      Trouton's ratio   ==Physics== In physics , Trouton's ratio states that latent heat is connected to boiling point roughly by:        L   v  a  p     T   b  o  i  l  i  n  g     ≈   87  -   88   J   K  m  o  l             subscript  L    v  a  p     subscript  T    b  o  i  l  i  n  g       87    88    J    K  m  o  l        \frac{L_{vap}}{T_{boiling}}\approx 87-88\frac{J}{Kmol}   .  Rheology  In rheology , Trouton's ratio is the ratio of extensional viscosity to shear viscosity . 1 For a Newtonian fluid Trouton's ratio is 3. 2  See also   Frederick Thomas Trouton  Trouton's rule   References    "  Category:Thermodynamic properties  Category:Non-Newtonian fluids     http://web.mst.edu/~wlf/Mechanical/Trouton.html ↩  http://web.mit.edu/nnf/research/ere/ere.html ↩
