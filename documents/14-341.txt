Consistent pricing process

A consistent pricing process (CPP) is any representation of (frictionless) "prices" of assets in a market. It is a stochastic process in a filtered probability space

 
  such that at time 
 
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
  component can be thought of as a price for the 
 
 
 
  asset.
Mathematically, a CPP 
 
 
 
  in a market with d-assets is an adapted process in 
 
 
 
  if Z is a martingale with respect to the physical probability measure

 
 
 , and if 
 
 
 
  at all times 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the solvency cone for the market at time 
 
 
 
 .12
The CPP plays the role of an equivalent martingale measure in markets with transaction costs.3 In particular, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the CPP 
 
 
 
 
  and the EMM 
 
 
 
 .
