   Consistent pricing process      Consistent pricing process   A consistent pricing process (CPP) is any representation of ( frictionless ) "prices" of assets in a market. It is a stochastic process in a filtered probability space     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,    {   ℱ  t   }    t  =  0   T   ,  P  )     normal-Ω  ℱ   superscript   subscript    subscript  ℱ  t      t  0    T   P    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\{\mathcal{F}_{t}\}_{t=0}^{T},P)   such that at time   t   t   t   the    i   t  h      superscript  i    t  h     i^{th}   component can be thought of as a price for the    i   t  h      superscript  i    t  h     i^{th}   asset.  Mathematically, a CPP    Z  =    (   Z  t   )    t  =  0   T       Z   superscript   subscript   subscript  Z  t     t  0    T     Z=(Z_{t})_{t=0}^{T}   in a market with d-assets is an adapted process in    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   if Z is a martingale with respect to the physical probability measure    P   P   P   , and if     Z  t   ∈    K  t  +   \   {  0  }         subscript  Z  t    normal-\   superscript   subscript  K  t      0      Z_{t}\in K_{t}^{+}\backslash\{0\}   at all times   t   t   t   such that    K  t     subscript  K  t    K_{t}   is the solvency cone for the market at time   t   t   t   . 1 2  The CPP plays the role of an equivalent martingale measure in markets with transaction costs . 3 In particular, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the CPP   Z   Z   Z   and the EMM   Q   Q   Q   .
