   Dextransucrase      Dextransucrase   In enzymology , a dextransucrase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sucrose + (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose + (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sucrose and (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n , whereas its two products are D-fructose and (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sucrose:1,6-alpha-D-glucan 6-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include sucrose 6-glucosyltransferase , SGE , CEP , and sucrose-1,6-alpha-glucan glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism and two-component system - general .  References       "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
