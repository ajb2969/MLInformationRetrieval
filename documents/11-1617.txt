Tagatose-6-phosphate kinase

In enzymology, a tagatose-6-phosphate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + D-tagatose 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + D-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-tagatose 6-phosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and D-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-tagatose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism.
