   Regular ideal      Regular ideal   In mathematics , especially ring theory , a regular ideal can refer to multiple concepts.  In operator theory , a right ideal    ùî¶   ùî¶   \mathfrak{i}   in a (possibly) non-unital ring  A is said to be regular (or modular ) if there exists an element e in A such that      e  x   -  x   ‚àà  ùî¶          e  x   x   ùî¶    ex-x\in\mathfrak{i}   for every    x  ‚àà  A      x  A    x\in A   .  In commutative algebra a regular ideal refers to an ideal containing a non- zero divisor . 1 This article will use "regular element ideal" to help distinguish this type of ideal.  A two-sided ideal   ùî¶   ùî¶   \mathfrak{i}   of a ring R can also be called a (von Neumann) regular ideal if for each element x of   ùî¶   ùî¶   \mathfrak{i}   there exists a y in   ùî¶   ùî¶   \mathfrak{i}   such that xyx = x .  Finally, regular ideal has been used to refer to an ideal J of a ring R such that the quotient ring  R / J is von Neumann regular ring . 2 This article will use "quotient von Neumann regular" to refer to this type of regular ideal.  Since the adjective regular has been overloaded, this article adopts the alternative adjectives modular , regular element  von Neumann regular , and quotient von Neumann regular to distinguish between concepts.  Properties and examples  Modular ideals  The notion of modular ideals permits the generalization of various characterizations of ideals in a unital ring to non-unital settings.  A two-sided ideal   ùî¶   ùî¶   \mathfrak{i}   is modular if and only if    A  /  ùî¶      A  ùî¶    A/\mathfrak{i}   is unital. In a unital ring, every ideal is modular since choosing e =1 works for any right ideal. So, the notion is more interesting for non-unital rings such as Banach algebras . From the definition it is easy to see that an ideal containing a modular ideal is itself modular.  Somewhat surprisingly, it is possible to prove that even in rings without identity, a modular right ideal is contained in a maximal right ideal. However, it is possible for a ring without identity to lack modular right ideals entirely.  The intersection of all maximal right ideals which are modular is the Jacobson radical .   Examples    In the non-unital ring of even integers, (6) is regular (    e  =  4      e  4    e=4   ) while (4) is not.  Let M be a simple right A-module. If x is a nonzero element in M , then the annihilator of x is a regular maximal right ideal in A .  If A is a ring without maximal right ideals, then A cannot have even a single modular right ideal.   Regular element ideals  Every ring with unity has at least one regular element ideal: the trivial ideal R itself. Regular element ideals of commutative rings are essential ideals . In a semiprime right Goldie ring , the converse holds: essential ideals are all regular element ideals.  Since the product of two regular elements (=non-zerodivisors) of a commutative ring R is again a regular element, it is apparent that the product of two regular element ideals is again a regular element ideal. Clearly any ideal containing a regular element ideal is again a regular element ideal.   Examples    In an integral domain , every nonzero element is a regular element, and so every nonzero ideal is a regular element ideal.  The nilradical of a commutative ring is composed entirely of nilpotent elements , and therefore no element can be regular. This gives an example of an ideal which is not a regular element ideal.  In an Artinian ring , each element is either invertible or a zero divisor. Because of this, such a ring only has one regular element ideal: just R .   Von Neumann regular ideals  From the definition, it is clear that R is a von Neumann regular ring if and only if R is a von Neumann regular ideal. The following statement is a relevant lemma for von Neumann regular ideals:  Lemma : For a ring R and proper ideal J containing an element a , there exists and element y in J such that a = aya if and only if there exists an element r in R such that a = ara . Proof : The "only if" direction is a tautology. For the "if" direction, we have a = ara = arara . Since a is in J , so is rar , and so by setting y = rar we have the conclusion.  As a consequence of this lemma, it is apparent that every ideal of a von Neumann regular ring is a von Neumann regular ideal. Another consequence is that if J and K are two ideals of R such that J ‚äÜ K and K is a von Neumann regular ideal, then J is also a von Neumann regular ideal.  If J and K are two ideals of R , then K is von Neumann regular if and only if both J is a von Neumann regular ideal and K / J is a von Neumann regular ring.  Every ring has at least one von Neumann regular ideal, namely {0}. Furthermore, every ring has a maximal von Neumann regular ideal containing all other von Neumann regular ideals, and this ideal is given by      M  =   {   x  ‚àà  R   ‚à£   R  x  R  is a von Neumann regular ideal   }       M   conditional-set    x  R     R  x  R  is a von Neumann regular ideal      M=\{x\in R\mid RxR\text{ is a von Neumann regular ideal }\}   .   Examples    As noted above, every ideal of a von Neumann regular ring is a von Neumann regular ideal.  It is well known that a local ring which is also a von Neumann regular ring is a division ring . Let R Be a local ring which is not a division ring, and denote the unique maximal right ideal by J . Then R cannot be von Neumann regular, but R / J , being a division ring, is a von Neumann regular ring. Consequently, J cannot be a von Neumann regular ideal, even though it is maximal.  A simple  domain which is not a division ring has the minimum possible number of von Neumann regular ideals: only the {0} ideal.   Quotient von Neumann regular ideals  If J and K are quotient von Neumann regular ideals, then so is J ‚à© K .  If J ‚äÜ K are proper ideals of R and J is quotient von Neumann regular, then so is K . This is because quotients of R / J are all von Neumann regular rings, and an isomorphism theorem for rings establishing that R / K ‚âÖ( R / J )/( J / K ). In particular if A is any ideal in R the ideal A + J is quotient von Neumann regular if J is.   Examples    Every proper ideal of a von Neumann regular ring is quotient von Neumann regular.  Any maximal ideal in a commutative ring is a quotient von Neumann regular ideal since R / M is a field. This is not true in general because for noncommutative rings R / M may only be a simple ring, and may not be von Neumann regular.  Let R be a local ring which is not a division ring, and with maximal right ideal M . Then M is a quotient von Neumann regular ideal, since R / M is a division ring, but R is not a von Neumann regular ring.  More generally in any semilocal ring the Jacobson radical  J is quotient von Neumann regular, since R / J is a semisimple ring , hence a von Neumann regular ring.
