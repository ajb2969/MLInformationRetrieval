   4-trimethylammoniobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase      4-trimethylammoniobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 4-trimethylammoniobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-trimethylammoniobutanal + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-trimethylammoniobutanoate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-trimethylammoniobutanal , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-trimethylammoniobutanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-trimethylammoniobutanal:NAD+ 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase , and 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and carnitine biosynthesis .
