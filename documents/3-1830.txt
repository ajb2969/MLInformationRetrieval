   Quadratic Gauss sum      Quadratic Gauss sum   In number theory , quadratic Gauss sums are certain finite sums of roots of unity. A quadratic Gauss sum can be interpreted as a linear combination of the values of the complex exponential function with coefficients given by a quadratic character; for a general character, one obtains a more general Gauss sum . These objects are named after Carl Friedrich Gauss , who studied them extensively and applied them to quadratic , cubic , and biquadratic reciprocity laws.  Definition  Let p be an odd prime number and a an integer. Then the Gauss sum mod p , g ( a ; p ), is the following sum of the p th roots of unity :         g   (  a  ;  p  )    =    ∑   n  =  0    p  -  1     e    2  π  i  a   n  2    /  p     =    ∑   n  =  0    p  -  1     ζ  p   a   n  2       ,    ζ  p   =   e    2  π  i   /  p      .     formulae-sequence        g   a  p      superscript   subscript     n  0      p  1     superscript  e      2  π  i  a   superscript  n  2    p            superscript   subscript     n  0      p  1     superscript   subscript  ζ  p     a   superscript  n  2           subscript  ζ  p    superscript  e      2  π  i   p       g(a;p)=\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}e^{2{\pi}ian^{2}/p}=\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\zeta_{p}^{an^{2}},%
 \quad\zeta_{p}=e^{2{\pi}i/p}.     If a is not divisible by p , an alternative expression for the Gauss sum (with the same value) is        G   (  a  ,  χ  )    =    ∑   n  =  1    p  -  1      (   n  p   )    e    2  π  i  a  n   /  p       .        G   a  χ      superscript   subscript     n  1      p  1        n  p    superscript  e      2  π  i  a  n   p        G(a,\chi)=\sum_{n=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)e^{2{\pi}ian/p}.     Here     χ   (  n  )    =   (   n  p   )         χ  n     n  p     \chi(n)=\left(\frac{n}{p}\right)   is the Legendre symbol , which is a quadratic character mod p . An analogous formula with a general character χ in place of the Legendre symbol defines the Gauss sum  G ( χ ).  Properties   The value of the Gauss sum is an algebraic integer in the p th cyclotomic field  Q ( ζ p ).    The evaluation of the Gauss sum can be reduced to the case a = 1:         g   (  a  ;  p  )    =    (   a  p   )   g   (  1  ;  p  )     .        g   a  p        a  p   g   1  p      g(a;p)=\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)g(1;p).     (Caution, this is true for odd p.)   The exact value of the Gauss sum, computed by Gauss, is given by the formula     g(1;p) =\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}e^{2{\pi}in^2/p}=     \begin{cases} \sqrt{p} & p\equiv 1\mod 4 \\ i\sqrt{p} & p\equiv 3\mod 4 \end{cases}.   The fact that     g    (  a  ;  p  )   2    =    (    -  1   p   )   p         g   superscript   a  p   2          1   p   p     g(a;p)^{2}=\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)p   was easy to prove and led to one of Gauss's proofs of quadratic reciprocity . However, the determination of the sign of the Gauss sum turned out to be considerably more difficult: Gauss could only establish it after several years' work. Later, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet , Leopold Kronecker , Issai Schur and other mathematicians found different proofs.   Generalized quadratic Gauss sums  Let a , b , c be natural numbers . The generalized Gauss sum  G ( a , b , c ) is defined by        G   (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    =    ∑   n  =  0    c  -  1     e   (     a   n  2    +   b  n    c   )      ,        G   a  b  c      superscript   subscript     n  0      c  1      e        a   superscript  n  2      b  n    c       G(a,b,c)=\sum_{n=0}^{c-1}e\left(\frac{an^{2}+bn}{c}\right),     where e ( x ) is the exponential function exp(2πi x ). The classical Gauss sum is the sum     G   (  a  ,  c  )    =   G   (  a  ,  0  ,  c  )          G   a  c      G   a  0  c      G(a,c)=G(a,0,c)   .  Properties   The Gauss sum G ( a , b , c ) depends only on the residue class of a , b modulo c .    Gauss sums are multiplicative , i.e. given natural numbers a , b , c and d with gcd ( c , d ) =1 one has    G ( a , b , cd )= G ( ac , b , d ) G ( ad , b , c ).   This is a direct consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem .   One has G ( a , b , c )= 0 if gcd( a , c )>1 except if gcd( a , c ) divides b in which case one has        G   (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    =     gcd   (  a  ,  c  )    ⋅  G    (   a   gcd   (  a  ,  c  )     ,   b   gcd   (  a  ,  c  )     ,   c   gcd   (  a  ,  c  )     )          G   a  b  c       normal-⋅    a  c   G      a    a  c      b    a  c      c    a  c        G(a,b,c)=\gcd(a,c)\cdot G\left(\frac{a}{\gcd(a,c)},\frac{b}{\gcd(a,c)},\frac{c%
 }{\gcd(a,c)}\right)     Thus in the evaluation of quadratic Gauss sums one may always assume gcd( a , c )= 1 .   Let a , b and c be integers with     a  c   ≠  0        a  c   0    ac\neq 0   and ac+b even. One has the following analogue of the quadratic reciprocity law for (even more general) Gauss sums          ∑   n  =  0     |  c  |   -  1     e    π  i   (    a   n  2    +   b  n    )    /  c     =     |   c  /  a   |    1  /  2     e    π  i   (    |   a  c   |   -   b  2    )    /   (   4  a  c   )       ∑   n  =  0     |  a  |   -  1     e   -    π  i   (    c   n  2    +   b  n    )    /  a        .        superscript   subscript     n  0        c   1     superscript  e      π  i      a   superscript  n  2      b  n     c        superscript      c  a      1  2     superscript  e      π  i        a  c     superscript  b  2       4  a  c       superscript   subscript     n  0        a   1     superscript  e        π  i      c   superscript  n  2      b  n     a         \sum_{n=0}^{|c|-1}e^{\pi i(an^{2}+bn)/c}=|c/a|^{1/2}e^{\pi i(|ac|-b^{2})/(4ac)%
 }\sum_{n=0}^{|a|-1}e^{-\pi i(cn^{2}+bn)/a}.      Define     ε  m   =   {     1     m  ≡   1  mod  4        i     m  ≡   3  mod  4             subscript  ε  m    cases  1    m   modulo  1  4    i    m   modulo  3  4       \varepsilon_{m}=\begin{cases}1&m\equiv 1\mod 4\\
 i&m\equiv 3\mod 4\end{cases}   for every odd integer m .   The values of Gauss sums with b=0 and gcd( a , c )= 1 are explicitly given by       G   (  a  ,  c  )    =   G   (  a  ,  0  ,  c  )    =   {     0     c  ≡   2  mod  4          ε  c    c    (    a  c    )        c   odd         (   1  +  i   )    ε  a   -  1     c    (    c  a    )        a   odd  ,  4  ∣  c  .               G   a  c      G   a  0  c          cases  0    c   modulo  2  4       subscript  ε  c     c     a  c      c  odd       1  i    superscript   subscript  ε  a     1      c     c  a     fragments  a  odd  normal-,  4  normal-∣  c  normal-.       G(a,c)=G(a,0,c)=\begin{cases}0&c\equiv 2\mod 4\\
 \varepsilon_{c}\sqrt{c}\left(\frac{a}{c}\right)&c\ \text{odd}\\
 (1+i)\varepsilon_{a}^{-1}\sqrt{c}\left(\frac{c}{a}\right)&a\ \text{odd},4\mid c%
 .\end{cases}     Here    (   a  c   )      a  c    \left(\frac{a}{c}\right)   is the Jacobi symbol . This is the famous formula of Carl Friedrich Gauss .   For b > 0 the Gauss sums can easily be computed by completing the square in most cases. This fails however in some cases (for example c even and b odd) which can be computed relatively easy by other means. For example if c is odd and gcd( a , c )= 1 one has        G   (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )    =      ε  c    c    ⋅   (   a  c   )     e   -    2  π  i  ψ   (  a  )    b  2    /  c            G   a  b  c       normal-⋅     subscript  ε  c     c      a  c     superscript  e        2  π  i  ψ  a   superscript  b  2    c        G(a,b,c)=\varepsilon_{c}\sqrt{c}\cdot\left(\frac{a}{c}\right)e^{-2\pi i\psi(a)%
 b^{2}/c}     where    ψ   (  a  )       ψ  a    \psi(a)   is some number with     4  ψ   (  a  )   a   ≡    1    mod   c         4  ψ  a  a     1  mod  c     4\psi(a)a\equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ c   . As another example, if 4 divides c and b is odd and as always gcd( a , c )= 1 then G ( a , b , c )= 0 . This can, for example, be proven as follows: Because of the multiplicative property of Gauss sums we only have to show that     G   (  a  ,  b  ,   2  n   )    =  0        G   a  b   superscript  2  n     0    G(a,b,2^{n})=0   if n > 1 and a,b are odd with gcd( a , c )=1. If b is odd then     a   n  2    +   b  n         a   superscript  n  2      b  n     an^{2}+bn   is even for all    0  ≤  n  <   c  -  1         0  n         c  1      0\leq n   . By Hensel's lemma , for every q , the equation      a   n  2    +   b  n   +  q   =  0          a   superscript  n  2      b  n   q   0    an^{2}+bn+q=0   has at most two solutions in     ℤ  /   2  n    ℤ        ℤ   superscript  2  n    ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/2^{n}\mathbb{Z}   . Because of a counting argument     a   n  2    +   b  n         a   superscript  n  2      b  n     an^{2}+bn   runs through all even residue classes modulo c exactly two times. The geometric sum formula then shows that     G   (  a  ,  b  ,   2  n   )    =  0        G   a  b   superscript  2  n     0    G(a,b,2^{n})=0   .   If c is odd and squarefree and gcd( a , c )= 1 then         G   (  a  ,  0  ,  c  )    =    ∑   n  =  0    c  -  1      (   n  c   )    e    2  π  i  a  n   /  c       .        G   a  0  c      superscript   subscript     n  0      c  1        n  c    superscript  e      2  π  i  a  n   c        G(a,0,c)=\sum_{n=0}^{c-1}\left(\frac{n}{c}\right)e^{2\pi ian/c}.     If c is not squarefree then the right side vanishes while the left side does not. Often the right sum is also called a quadratic Gauss sum.   Another useful formula is    G ( n , p k )= pG ( n , p k -2 )   if k ≥2 and p is an odd prime number or if k ≥4 and p =2.
