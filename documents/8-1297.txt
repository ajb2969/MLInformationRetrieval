Matrix pencil

In linear algebra, if 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  complex matrices for some nonnegative integer 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  (the zero matrix), then the matrix pencil of degree 
 
 
 
  is the matrix-valued function defined on the complex numbers



A particular case is a linear matrix pencil


 
  with


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are complex (or real) 
 
 
 
  matrices.1 We denote it briefly with the notation 
 
 
 
 .
A pencil is called regular if there is at least one value of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . We call eigenvalues of a matrix pencil 
 
 
 
  all complex numbers 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  (see eigenvalue for comparison). The set of the eigenvalues is called the spectrum of the pencil and is written 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, the pencil is said to have one or more eigenvalues at infinity if 
 
 
 
  has one or more 0 eigenvalues.
Applications
Matrix pencils play an important role in numerical linear algebra. The problem of finding the eigenvalues of a pencil is called the generalized eigenvalue problem. The most popular algorithm for this task is the QZ algorithm, which is an implicit version of the QR algorithm to solve the associated eigenvalue problem 
 
 
 
  without forming explicitly the matrix 
 
 
 
  (which could be impossible or ill-conditioned if 
 
 
 
  is singular or near-singular)
Pencil generated by commuting matrices
If 
 
 
 
 , then the pencil generated by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (Marcus & Minc, 1969, p. 79):
1) consists only of matrices similar to a diagonal matrix
or
2) has no matrices in it similar to a diagonal matrix
or
3) has exactly one matrix in it similar to a diagonal matrix.
