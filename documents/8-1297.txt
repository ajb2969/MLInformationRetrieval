   Matrix pencil      Matrix pencil   In linear algebra , if     A  0   ,   A  1   ,  …  ,   A  l       subscript  A  0    subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  l     A_{0},A_{1},\dots,A_{l}   are    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   complex matrices for some nonnegative integer   l   l   l   , and     A  l   ≠  0       subscript  A  l   0    A_{l}\neq 0   (the zero matrix), then the matrix pencil of degree   l   l   l   is the matrix-valued function defined on the complex numbers        L   (  λ  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   l     λ  i    A  i      .        L  λ     superscript   subscript     i  0    l      superscript  λ  i    subscript  A  i       L(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^{l}\lambda^{i}A_{i}.     A particular case is a linear matrix pencil      A  -   λ   B        A    λ  B     A-\lambda B\,   with      λ  ∈   ℂ  (or  ℝ  ),       λ    ℂ  (or  ℝ  ),     \lambda\in\mathbb{C}\text{ (or }\mathbb{R}\text{),}   where   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are complex (or real)    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrices. 1 We denote it briefly with the notation    (  A  ,  B  )     A  B    (A,B)   .  A pencil is called regular if there is at least one value of   λ   λ   \lambda   such that     det   (   A  -   λ  B    )    ≠  0          A    λ  B     0    \det(A-\lambda B)\neq 0   . We call eigenvalues of a matrix pencil    (  A  ,  B  )     A  B    (A,B)   all complex numbers   λ   λ   \lambda   for which     det   (   A  -   λ  B    )    =  0          A    λ  B     0    \det(A-\lambda B)=0   (see eigenvalue for comparison). The set of the eigenvalues is called the spectrum of the pencil and is written    σ   (  A  ,  B  )       σ   A  B     \sigma(A,B)   . Moreover, the pencil is said to have one or more eigenvalues at infinity if   B   B   B   has one or more 0 eigenvalues.  Applications  Matrix pencils play an important role in numerical linear algebra . The problem of finding the eigenvalues of a pencil is called the generalized eigenvalue problem . The most popular algorithm for this task is the QZ algorithm , which is an implicit version of the QR algorithm to solve the associated eigenvalue problem      B   -  1    A  x   =   λ  x          superscript  B    1    A  x     λ  x     B^{-1}Ax=\lambda x   without forming explicitly the matrix     B   -  1    A       superscript  B    1    A    B^{-1}A   (which could be impossible or ill-conditioned if   B   B   B   is singular or near-singular)  Pencil generated by commuting matrices  If     A  B   =   B  A         A  B     B  A     AB=BA   , then the pencil generated by   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   (Marcus & Minc, 1969, p. 79):  1) consists only of matrices similar to a diagonal matrix  or  2) has no matrices in it similar to a diagonal matrix  or  3) has exactly one matrix in it similar to a diagonal matrix.
