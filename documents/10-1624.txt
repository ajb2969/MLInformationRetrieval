Bornyl diphosphate synthase




Bornyl diphosphate synthase

In enzymology, a bornyl diphosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-bornyl diphosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranyl diphosphate, and one product, (+)-bornyl diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-bornyl-diphosphate lyase (decyclizing). Other names in common use include bornyl pyrophosphate synthase, bornyl pyrophosphate synthetase, (+)-bornylpyrophosphate cyclase, and geranyl-diphosphate cyclase (ambiguous). This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis.
