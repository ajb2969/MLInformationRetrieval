It has 122 faces: 20 triangles, 60 squares, 12 pentagons, and 30 rhombs. The 120 vertices exist at two sets of 60, with a slightly different distance from its center.  It can also be constructed as a rectified  rhombicosidodecahedron .

If the central rhombic triacontahedron and the 30 rhombic prisms are removed, you can create a toroidal polyhedron with all regular polygon faces.
