   First-order reduction      First-order reduction   In computer science , a first-order reduction is a very weak type of reduction between two computational problems in computational complexity theory . A first-order reduction is a reduction where each component is restricted to be in the class FO of problems calculable in first-order logic .  Since we have    FO  âŠŠ  L      FO  L    \mbox{FO}\subsetneq\mbox{L}   , the first-order reductions are weaker reductions than the logspace reductions .  Many important complexity classes are closed under first-order reductions, and many of the traditional complete problems are first-order complete as well (Immerman 1999 p. 49-50). For example, ST-connectivity is FO-complete for NL , and NL is closed under FO reductions (Immerman 1999, p. 51) (as are P , NP , and most other "well-behaved" classes).
