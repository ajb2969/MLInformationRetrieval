Tower (mathematics)

In category theory, a branch of abstract mathematics, a tower is defined as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be the poset



of whole numbers in reverse order, regarded as a category. A (countable) tower of objects in a category 
 
 
 is a functor from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
In other words, a tower (of 
 
 
 
 ) is a family of objects 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  where there exists a map


 
  if 
 
 
 
  and the composition


 
  is the map 
 
 

Example
Let 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the identity map for 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  forms a tower of modules.
