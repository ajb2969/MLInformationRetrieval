Hausdorff completion

In algebra, the Hausdorff completion

 
  of a group G with filtration

 
  is the inverse limit

 
  of the discrete group

 
 . A basic example is a profinite completion. The image of the canonical map 
 
 
 
  is a Hausdorff topological group and its kernel is the intersection of all 
 
 
 
 : i.e., the closure of the identity element. The canonical homomorphism

 
  is an isomorphism, where 
 
 
 
  is a graded module associated to the filtration.
The concept is named after Felix Hausdorff.
