   Hausdorff completion      Hausdorff completion   In algebra, the Hausdorff completion     G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   of a group  G with filtration     G  n     subscript  G  n    G_{n}   is the inverse limit      lim  ←    G  /   G  n       projective-limit    G   subscript  G  n      \underleftarrow{\lim}G/G_{n}   of the discrete group     G  /   G  n       G   subscript  G  n     G/G_{n}   . A basic example is a profinite completion . The image of the canonical map    G  →   G  ^      normal-→  G   normal-^  G     G\to\widehat{G}   is a Hausdorff  topological group and its kernel is the intersection of all    G  n     subscript  G  n    G_{n}   : i.e., the closure of the identity element. The canonical homomorphism      gr   (  G  )    →   gr   (   G  ^   )       normal-→   gr  G    gr   normal-^  G      \operatorname{gr}(G)\to\operatorname{gr}(\widehat{G})   is an isomorphism , where    gr   (  G  )      gr  G    \operatorname{gr}(G)   is a graded module associated to the filtration.  The concept is named after Felix Hausdorff .  References   Nicolas Bourbaki , Commutative algebra   "  Category:Commutative algebra
