   Strong Subadditivity of Quantum Entropy      Strong Subadditivity of Quantum Entropy   Strong subadditivity of entropy (SSA) was long known and appreciated in classical probability theory and information theory. Its extension to quantum mechanical entropy (the von Neumann entropy ) was conjectured by D.W. Robinson and D. Ruelle 1 in 1966 and O. E. Lanford III and D. W. Robinson 2 in 1968 and proved in 1973 by E.H. Lieb and M.B. Ruskai. 3 It is a basic theorem in modern quantum information theory .  SSA concerns the relation between the entropies of various subsystems of a larger system consisting of three subsystems (or of one system with three degrees of freedom). The proof of this relation in the classical case is quite easy but the quantum case is difficult because of the non-commutativity of the density matrices describing the subsystems.  Some useful references here are. 4 5 6  Definitions  We will use the following notation throughout: A Hilbert space is denoted by   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , and    ℬ   (  ℋ  )       ℬ  ℋ    \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})   denotes the bounded linear operators on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   . Tensor products are denoted by superscripts, e.g.,     ℋ  12   =    ℋ  1   ⊗   ℋ  2         superscript  ℋ  12    tensor-product   superscript  ℋ  1    superscript  ℋ  2      \mathcal{H}^{12}=\mathcal{H}^{1}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{2}   . The trace is denoted by   Tr   Tr   {\rm Tr}   .  Density matrix  A density matrix is a Hermitian , positive semi-definite matrix of trace one. It allows for the description of a quantum system in a mixed state . Density matrices on a tensor product are denoted by superscripts, e.g.,    ρ  12     superscript  ρ  12    \rho^{12}   is a density matrix on    ℋ  12     superscript  ℋ  12    \mathcal{H}^{12}   .  Entropy  The von Neumann quantum entropy of a density matrix   ρ   ρ   \rho   is       S   (  ρ  )    :=   -   Tr   (   ρ   log  ρ    )        assign    S  ρ       Tr    ρ    ρ        S(\rho):=-{\rm Tr}(\rho\log\rho)   .  Relative entropy  Umegaki's 7  quantum relative entropy of two density matrices   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   σ   σ   \sigma   is      S   (  ρ  |  |  σ  )   =  Tr   (  ρ  log  ρ  -  ρ  log  σ  )   ≥  0     fragments  S   fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-|  normal-|  σ  normal-)    Tr   fragments  normal-(  ρ   ρ   ρ   σ  normal-)    0    S(\rho||\sigma)={\rm Tr}(\rho\log\rho-\rho\log\sigma)\geq 0   .  Joint concavity  A function   g   g   g   of two variables is said to be ' jointly concave ' if for any    0  ≤  λ  ≤  1        0  λ       1     0\leq\lambda\leq 1   the following holds        g   (    λ   A  1    +    (   1  -  λ   )    A  2     ,    λ   B  1    +    (   1  -  λ   )    B  2     )    ≥    λ  g   (   A  1   ,   B  1   )    +    (   1  -  λ   )   g   (   A  2   ,   B  2   )      .        g       λ   subscript  A  1        1  λ    subscript  A  2         λ   subscript  B  1        1  λ    subscript  B  2           λ  g    subscript  A  1    subscript  B  1         1  λ   g    subscript  A  2    subscript  B  2        g(\lambda A_{1}+(1-\lambda)A_{2},\lambda B_{1}+(1-\lambda)B_{2})\geq\lambda g(%
 A_{1},B_{1})+(1-\lambda)g(A_{2},B_{2}).     Subadditivity of entropy  Ordinary subadditivity 8 concerns only two spaces    ℋ  12     superscript  ℋ  12    \mathcal{H}^{12}   and a density matrix    ρ  12     superscript  ρ  12    \rho^{12}   . It states that       S   (   ρ  12   )    ≤    S   (   ρ  1   )    +   S   (   ρ  2   )           S   superscript  ρ  12        S   superscript  ρ  1      S   superscript  ρ  2       S(\rho^{12})\leq S(\rho^{1})+S(\rho^{2})   This inequality is true, of course, in classical probability theory, but the latter also contains the theorem that the conditional entropies     S   (   ρ  12   |   ρ  1   )   =  S   (   ρ  12   )   -  S   (   ρ  1   )      fragments  S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-|   superscript  ρ  1   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  1   normal-)     S(\rho^{12}|\rho^{1})=S(\rho^{12})-S(\rho^{1})   and    S   (   ρ  12   |   ρ  2   )   =  S   (   ρ  12   )   -  S   (   ρ  2   )      fragments  S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-|   superscript  ρ  2   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  2   normal-)     S(\rho^{12}|\rho^{2})=S(\rho^{12})-S(\rho^{2})   are both non-negative. In the quantum case, however, both can be negative, e.g.    S   (   ρ  12   )       S   superscript  ρ  12     S(\rho^{12})   can be zero while     S   (   ρ  1   )    =   S   (   ρ  12   )    >  0          S   superscript  ρ  1      S   superscript  ρ  12         0     S(\rho^{1})=S(\rho^{12})>0   . Nevertheless, the subadditivity upper bound on    S   (   ρ  12   )       S   superscript  ρ  12     S(\rho^{12})   continues to hold. The closest thing one has to      S   (   ρ  12   )    -   S   (   ρ  1   )     ≥  0          S   superscript  ρ  12      S   superscript  ρ  1     0    S(\rho^{12})-S(\rho^{1})\geq 0   is the Araki–Lieb triangle inequality 9       S   (   ρ  12   )    ≥   |    S   (   ρ  1   )    -   S   (   ρ  2   )     |         S   superscript  ρ  12          S   superscript  ρ  1      S   superscript  ρ  2        S(\rho^{12})\geq|S(\rho^{1})-S(\rho^{2})|   which is derived in 10 from subadditivity by a mathematical technique known as 'purification'.  Strong subadditivity (SSA)  Suppose that the Hilbert space of the system is a tensor product of three spaces     ℋ  =    ℋ  1   ⊗   ℋ  2   ⊗   ℋ  3     .      ℋ   tensor-product   superscript  ℋ  1    superscript  ℋ  2    superscript  ℋ  3      \mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^{1}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{2}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{3}.   . Physically, these three spaces can be interpreted as the space of three different systems, or else as three parts or three degrees of freedom of one physical system.  Given a density matrix    ρ  123     superscript  ρ  123    \rho^{123}   on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , we define a density matrix    ρ  12     superscript  ρ  12    \rho^{12}   on     ℋ  1   ⊗   ℋ  2      tensor-product   superscript  ℋ  1    superscript  ℋ  2     \mathcal{H}^{1}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{2}   as a partial trace :     ρ  12   =    Tr   ℋ  3     ρ  123         superscript  ρ  12      subscript  Tr   superscript  ℋ  3     superscript  ρ  123      \rho^{12}={\rm Tr}_{\mathcal{H}^{3}}\rho^{123}   . Similarly, we can define density matrices    ρ  23     superscript  ρ  23    \rho^{23}   ,    ρ  13     superscript  ρ  13    \rho^{13}   ,    ρ  1     superscript  ρ  1    \rho^{1}   ,    ρ  2     superscript  ρ  2    \rho^{2}   ,    ρ  3     superscript  ρ  3    \rho^{3}   .  Statement  For any tri-partite state    ρ  123     superscript  ρ  123    \rho^{123}   the following holds        S   (   ρ  123   )    +   S   (   ρ  2   )     ≤    S   (   ρ  12   )    +   S   (   ρ  23   )             S   superscript  ρ  123      S   superscript  ρ  2         S   superscript  ρ  12      S   superscript  ρ  23       S(\rho^{123})+S(\rho^{2})\leq S(\rho^{12})+S(\rho^{23})   , where     S   (   ρ  12   )    =   -    Tr   ℋ  12     ρ  12    log   ρ  12            S   superscript  ρ  12         subscript  Tr   superscript  ℋ  12     superscript  ρ  12      superscript  ρ  12        S(\rho^{12})=-{\rm Tr}_{\mathcal{H}^{12}}\rho^{12}\log\rho^{12}   , for example.  Equivalently, the statement can be recast in terms of conditional entropies to show that for tripartite state    ρ   A  B  C      superscript  ρ    A  B  C     \rho^{ABC}   ,      S   (  A  ∣  B  C  )   ≤  S   (  A  ∣  B  )      fragments  S   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-∣  B  C  normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-∣  B  normal-)     S(A\mid BC)\leq S(A\mid B)   . This can also be restated in terms of quantum mutual information ,      I   (  A  :  B  C  )   ≥  I   (  A  :  B  )      fragments  I   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-:  B  C  normal-)    I   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-:  B  normal-)     I(A:BC)\geq I(A:B)   . These statements run parallel to classical intuition, except that quantum conditional entropies can be negative, and quantum mutual informations can exceed the classical bound of the marginal entropy.  The strong subadditivity inequality was improved in the following way by Carlen and Lieb 11         S   (   ρ  12   )    +   S   (   ρ  23   )     -   S   (   ρ  123   )    -   S   (   ρ  2   )     ≥   2   max   {    S   (   ρ  1   )    -   S   (   ρ  12   )     ,    S   (   ρ  2   )    -   S   (   ρ  12   )     ,  0  }               S   superscript  ρ  12      S   superscript  ρ  23       S   superscript  ρ  123      S   superscript  ρ  2       2        S   superscript  ρ  1      S   superscript  ρ  12         S   superscript  ρ  2      S   superscript  ρ  12     0      S(\rho^{12})+S(\rho^{23})-S(\rho^{123})-S(\rho^{2})\geq 2\max\{S(\rho^{1})-S(%
 \rho^{12}),S(\rho^{2})-S(\rho^{12}),0\}   , with the optimal constant   2   2   2   .  As mentioned above, SSA was first proved by E.H.Lieb and M.B.Ruskai in, 12 using Lieb's theorem that was proved in. 13 The extension from a Hilbert space setting to a von Neumann algebra setting, where states are not given by density matrices, was done by Narnhofer and Thirring . 14  The theorem can also be obtained by proving numerous equivalent statements, some of which are summarized below.  Wigner–Yanase–Dyson conjecture  E. P. Wigner and M. M. Yanase 15 proposed a different definition of entropy, which was generalized by F.J. Dyson.  The Wigner–Yanase–Dyson p -skew information  The Wigner–Yanase–Dyson   p   p   p   -skew information of a density matrix   ρ   ρ   \rho   . with respect to an operator   K   K   K   is         I  p    (  ρ  ,  K  )    =    1  2   Tr   [   ρ  p   ,   K  *   ]    [   ρ   1  -  p    ,  K  ]     ,         subscript  I  p    ρ  K        1  2   Tr    superscript  ρ  p    superscript  K       superscript  ρ    1  p    K      I_{p}(\rho,K)=\frac{1}{2}{\rm Tr}[\rho^{p},K^{*}][\rho^{1-p},K],   where     [  A  ,  B  ]   =    A  B   -   B  A         A  B       A  B     B  A      [A,B]=AB-BA   is a commutator,    K  *     superscript  K     K^{*}   is the adjoint of   K   K   K   and    0  ≤  p  ≤  1        0  p       1     0\leq p\leq 1   is fixed.  Concavity of p -skew information  It was conjectured by E. P. Wigner and M. M. Yanase in 16 that   p   p   p   - skew information is concave as a function of a density matrix   ρ   ρ   \rho   for a fixed    0  ≤  p  ≤  1        0  p       1     0\leq p\leq 1   .  Since the term    -    1  2   Tr  ρ  K   K  *            1  2   Tr  ρ  K   superscript  K       -\tfrac{1}{2}{\rm Tr}\rho KK^{*}   is concave (it is linear), the conjecture reduces to the problem of concavity of    T  r   ρ  p    K  *    ρ   1  -  p    K      T  r   superscript  ρ  p    superscript  K     superscript  ρ    1  p    K    Tr\rho^{p}K^{*}\rho^{1-p}K   . As noted in, 17 this conjecture (for all    0  ≤  p  ≤  1        0  p       1     0\leq p\leq 1   ) implies SSA, and was proved for    p  =   1  2       p    1  2     p=\tfrac{1}{2}   in, 18 and for all    0  ≤  p  ≤  1        0  p       1     0\leq p\leq 1   in 19 in the following more general form: The function of two matrix variables  is jointly concave in   A   A   A   and    B  ,    B   B,   when    0  ≤  r  ≤  1        0  r       1     0\leq r\leq 1   and     p  +  r   ≤  1        p  r   1    p+r\leq 1   .  This theorem is an essential part of the proof of SSA in. 20  In their paper 21 E. P. Wigner and M. M. Yanase also conjectured the subadditivity of   p   p   p   -skew information for    p  =   1  2       p    1  2     p=\tfrac{1}{2}   , which was disproved by Hansen 22 by giving a counterexample.  First two statements equivalent to SSA  It was pointed out in 23 that the first statement below is equivalent to SSA and A. Ulhmann in 24 showed the equivalence between the second statement below and SSA.          S   (   ρ  1   )    +   S   (   ρ  3   )     -   S   (   ρ  12   )    -   S   (   ρ  23   )     ≤  0.            S   superscript  ρ  1      S   superscript  ρ  3       S   superscript  ρ  12      S   superscript  ρ  23     0.    S(\rho^{1})+S(\rho^{3})-S(\rho^{12})-S(\rho^{23})\leq 0.   Note that the conditional entropies    S   (   ρ  12   |   ρ  1   )      fragments  S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-|   superscript  ρ  1   normal-)     S(\rho^{12}|\rho^{1})   and    S   (   ρ  23   |   ρ  3   )      fragments  S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  23   normal-|   superscript  ρ  3   normal-)     S(\rho^{23}|\rho^{3})   do not have to be both non-negative.  The map     ρ  12   ↦    S   (   ρ  1   )    -   S   (   ρ  12   )        maps-to   superscript  ρ  12       S   superscript  ρ  1      S   superscript  ρ  12       \rho^{12}\mapsto S(\rho^{1})-S(\rho^{12})   is convex.   Both of these statements were proved directly in. 25  Joint convexity of relative entropy  As noted by Lindblad 26 and Uhlmann , 27 if, in equation (), one takes    K  =  1      K  1    K=1   and     r  =   1  -  p    ,   A  =  ρ      formulae-sequence    r    1  p      A  ρ     r=1-p,A=\rho   and    B  =  σ      B  σ    B=\sigma   and differentiates in   p   p   p   at    p  =  0      p  0    p=0   one obtains the '''Joint convexity of relative entropy ''': i.e., if    ρ  =    ∑  k     λ  k    ρ  k         ρ    subscript   k      subscript  λ  k    subscript  ρ  k       \rho=\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\rho_{k}   , and    σ  =    ∑  k     λ  k    σ  k         σ    subscript   k      subscript  λ  k    subscript  σ  k       \sigma=\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\sigma_{k}   , then where     λ  k   ≥  0       subscript  λ  k   0    \lambda_{k}\geq 0   with      ∑  k    λ  k    =  1        subscript   k    subscript  λ  k    1    \sum_{k}\lambda_{k}=1   .  Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy  The relative entropy decreases monotonically under certain operations on density matrices, the most important and basic of which is the following. Consider the map   T   T   T   from     ℬ   (   ℋ  12   )    →   ℬ   (   ℋ  12   )       normal-→    ℬ   superscript  ℋ  12      ℬ   superscript  ℋ  12      \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}^{12})\rightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}^{12})   given by    T  =     1   ℋ  1    ⊗  T    r   ℋ  2         T     tensor-product   subscript  1   superscript  ℋ  1    T    subscript  r   superscript  ℋ  2       T=1_{\mathcal{H}^{1}}\otimes Tr_{\mathcal{H}^{2}}   . Then   which is called Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy under partial trace .  To see how this follows from the joint convexity of relative entropy, observe that   T   T   T   can be written in Uhlmann's representation as        T   (   ρ  12   )    =    N   -  1      ∑   j  =  1   N     (    1   ℋ  1    ⊗   U  j    )    ρ  12    (    1   ℋ  1    ⊗   U  j  *    )       ,        T   superscript  ρ  12       superscript  N    1      superscript   subscript     j  1    N      tensor-product   subscript  1   superscript  ℋ  1     subscript  U  j     superscript  ρ  12    tensor-product   subscript  1   superscript  ℋ  1     superscript   subscript  U  j           T(\rho^{12})=N^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{N}(1_{\mathcal{H}^{1}}\otimes U_{j})\rho^{12}(1%
 _{\mathcal{H}^{1}}\otimes U_{j}^{*}),   for some finite   N   N   N   and some collection of unitary matrices on    ℋ  2     superscript  ℋ  2    \mathcal{H}^{2}   (alternatively, integrate over Haar measure ). Since the trace (and hence the relative entropy) is unitarily invariant, inequality () now follows from (). This theorem is due to Lindblad 28 and Uhlmann, 29 whose proof is the one given here.  SSA is obtained from () with    ℋ  1     superscript  ℋ  1    \mathcal{H}^{1}   replaced by    ℋ  12     superscript  ℋ  12    \mathcal{H}^{12}   and    ℋ  2     superscript  ℋ  2    \mathcal{H}^{2}   replaced    ℋ  3     superscript  ℋ  3    \mathcal{H}^{3}   . Take     ρ  =   ρ  123    ,    σ  =    ρ  1   ⊗   ρ  23     ,   T  =     1   ℋ  12    ⊗  T    r   ℋ  3          formulae-sequence    ρ   superscript  ρ  123     formulae-sequence    σ   tensor-product   superscript  ρ  1    superscript  ρ  23       T     tensor-product   subscript  1   superscript  ℋ  12    T    subscript  r   superscript  ℋ  3         \rho=\rho^{123},\sigma=\rho^{1}\otimes\rho^{23},T=1_{\mathcal{H}^{12}}\otimes

Therefore,      S   (   ρ  123   |  |   ρ  1   ⊗   ρ  23   )   -  S   (   ρ  12   |  |   ρ  1   ⊗   ρ  2   )   =  S   (   ρ  12   )   +  S   (   ρ  23   )   -  S   (   ρ  123   )   -  S   (   ρ  2   )   ≥  0  ,     fragments  S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  123   normal-|  normal-|   superscript  ρ  1   tensor-product   superscript  ρ  23   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-|  normal-|   superscript  ρ  1   tensor-product   superscript  ρ  2   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  12   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  23   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  123   normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ρ  2   normal-)    0  normal-,    S(\rho^{123}||\rho^{1}\otimes\rho^{23})-S(\rho^{12}||\rho^{1}\otimes\rho^{2})=%
 S(\rho^{12})+S(\rho^{23})-S(\rho^{123})-S(\rho^{2})\geq 0,   which is SSA. Thus, the monotonicity of quantum relative entropy (which follows from () implies SSA.  Owing to the Stinespring factorization theorem , equation () is valid not only for partial traces but also when   T   T   T   is a quantum operation, i.e., a completely positive, trace preserving map. In this general case the inequality is called Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy .  Relationship among inequalities  All of the above important inequalities are equivalent to each other, and can also be proved directly. The following are equivalent:   Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy (MONO);  Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy under partial trace (MPT);  Strong subadditivity (SSA);  Joint convexity of quantum relative entropy (JC);   The following implications show the equivalence between these inequalities.   MONO   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   MPT: follows since the MPT is a particular case of MONO;    MPT   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   MONO: was showed by Lindblad, 30 using a representation of stochastic maps as a partial trace over an auxiliary system;    MPT   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   SSA: follows by taking a particular choice of tri-partite states in MPT, described in the section above, "Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy";    SSA   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   MPT: by choosing    ρ  123     subscript  ρ  123    \rho_{123}   to be block diagonal, one can show that SSA implies that the map        ρ  12   ↦    S   (   ρ  1   )    -   S   (   ρ  12   )        maps-to   subscript  ρ  12       S   subscript  ρ  1      S   subscript  ρ  12       \rho_{12}\mapsto S(\rho_{1})-S(\rho_{12})   is convex. In 31 it was observed that this convexity yields MPT;   MPT   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   JC: as it was mentioned above, by choosing    ρ  12     subscript  ρ  12    \rho_{12}   (and similarly,    σ  12     subscript  σ  12    \sigma_{12}   ) to be block diagonal matrix with blocks     λ  k    ρ  k        subscript  λ  k    subscript  ρ  k     \lambda_{k}\rho_{k}   (and     λ  k    σ  k        subscript  λ  k    subscript  σ  k     \lambda_{k}\sigma_{k}   ), the partial trace is a sum over blocks so that    ρ  :=   ρ  2   =    ∑  k     λ  k    ρ  k          assign  ρ   subscript  ρ  2          subscript   k      subscript  λ  k    subscript  ρ  k        \rho:=\rho_{2}=\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\rho_{k}   , so from MPT one can obtain JC;    JC   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   SSA: using the 'purification process', Araki and Lieb, 32 33 observed that one could obtain new useful inequalities from the known ones. By purifying    ρ  123     subscript  ρ  123    \rho_{123}   to    ρ  1234     subscript  ρ  1234    \rho_{1234}   it can be shown that SSA is equivalent to          S   (   ρ  4   )    +   S   (   ρ  2   )     ≤    S   (   ρ  12   )    +   S   (   ρ  14   )      .          S   subscript  ρ  4      S   subscript  ρ  2         S   subscript  ρ  12      S   subscript  ρ  14       S(\rho_{4})+S(\rho_{2})\leq S(\rho_{12})+S(\rho_{14}).   Moreover, if    ρ  124     subscript  ρ  124    \rho_{124}   is pure, then     S   (   ρ  2   )    =   S   (   ρ  14   )          S   subscript  ρ  2      S   subscript  ρ  14      S(\rho_{2})=S(\rho_{14})   and     S   (   ρ  4   )    =   S   (   ρ  12   )          S   subscript  ρ  4      S   subscript  ρ  12      S(\rho_{4})=S(\rho_{12})   , so the equality holds in the above inequality. Since the extreme points of the convex set of density matrices are pure states, SSA follows from JC;  See, 34 35 for a discussion.  The case of equality  Equality in monotonicity of quantum relative entropy inequality  In, 36 37 D. Petz showed that the only case of equality in the monotonicity relation is to have a proper "recovery" channel:  For all states   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   σ   σ   \sigma   on a Hilbert space   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   and all quantum operators    T  :    ℬ   (  ℋ  )    →   ℬ   (  𝒦  )        normal-:  T   normal-→    ℬ  ℋ     ℬ  𝒦      T:\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})\rightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{K})   ,      S   (  T  ρ  |  |  T  σ  )   =  S   (  ρ  |  |  σ  )   ,     fragments  S   fragments  normal-(  T  ρ  normal-|  normal-|  T  σ  normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-|  normal-|  σ  normal-)   normal-,    S(T\rho||T\sigma)=S(\rho||\sigma),   if and only if there exists a quantum operator    T  ^     normal-^  T    \hat{T}   such that         T  ^   T  σ   =  σ   ,         normal-^  T   T  σ   σ    \hat{T}T\sigma=\sigma,   and       T  ^   T  ρ   =  ρ   .         normal-^  T   T  ρ   ρ    \hat{T}T\rho=\rho.   Moreover,    T  ^     normal-^  T    \hat{T}   can be given explicitly by the formula         T  ^   ω   =    σ   1  /  2     T  *    (     (   T  σ   )    -   1  /  2     ω    (   T  σ   )    -   1  /  2      )    σ   1  /  2      ,         normal-^  T   ω      superscript  σ    1  2     superscript  T       superscript    T  σ       1  2     ω   superscript    T  σ       1  2       superscript  σ    1  2       \hat{T}\omega=\sigma^{1/2}T^{*}\Bigl((T\sigma)^{-1/2}\omega(T\sigma)^{-1/2}%
 \Bigr)\sigma^{1/2},   where    T  *     superscript  T     T^{*}   is the adjoint map of   T   T   T   .  D. Petz also gave another condition 38 when the equality holds in Monotonicity of quantum relative entropy: the first statement in Theorem below. Differentiating it at    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   we have the second condition. Moreover, M.B. Ruskai gave another proof of the second statement.  For all states   ρ   ρ   \rho   and   σ   σ   \sigma   on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   and all quantum operators    T  :    ℬ   (  ℋ  )    →   ℬ   (  𝒦  )        normal-:  T   normal-→    ℬ  ℋ     ℬ  𝒦      T:\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})\rightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{K})   ,      S   (  T  ρ  |  |  T  σ  )   =  S   (  ρ  |  |  σ  )   ,     fragments  S   fragments  normal-(  T  ρ  normal-|  normal-|  T  σ  normal-)    S   fragments  normal-(  ρ  normal-|  normal-|  σ  normal-)   normal-,    S(T\rho||T\sigma)=S(\rho||\sigma),   if and only if the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:         T  *    (   T    (  ρ  )    i  t    T    (  σ  )    i  t     )    =    ρ   i  t     σ   -   i  t             superscript  T      T   superscript  ρ    i  t    T   superscript  σ    i  t         superscript  ρ    i  t     superscript  σ      i  t        T^{*}(T(\rho)^{it}T(\sigma)^{it})=\rho^{it}\sigma^{-it}   for all real   t   t   t   .         log  ρ   -   log  σ    =    T  *    (     log  T    (  ρ  )    -    log  T    (  σ  )     )     .          ρ     σ       superscript  T          T   ρ       T   σ       \log\rho-\log\sigma=T^{*}\Bigl(\log T(\rho)-\log T(\sigma)\Bigr).      where    T  *     superscript  T     T^{*}   is the adjoint map of   T   T   T   .  Equality in strong subadditivity inequality  P. Hayden, R. Jozsa, D. Petz and A.

Operator extension of strong subadditivity  In his paper 40 I. Kim studied an operator extension of strong subadditivity, proving the following inequality:  For a tri-partite state (density matrix)    ρ  123     superscript  ρ  123    \rho^{123}   on     ℋ  1   ⊗   ℋ  2   ⊗   ℋ  3      tensor-product   superscript  ℋ  1    superscript  ℋ  2    superscript  ℋ  3     \mathcal{H}^{1}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{2}\otimes\mathcal{H}^{3}   ,       T   r  12    (    ρ  123    (     -   log   (   ρ  12   )     -   log   (   ρ  23   )     +   log   (   ρ  2   )    +   log   (   ρ  123   )     )    )    ≥  0.        T   subscript  r  12      superscript  ρ  123            superscript  ρ  12        superscript  ρ  23        superscript  ρ  2       superscript  ρ  123       0.    Tr_{12}\Bigl(\rho^{123}(-\log(\rho^{12})-\log(\rho^{23})+\log(\rho^{2})+\log(%
 \rho^{123}))\Bigr)\geq 0.     The proof of this inequality is based on Effros's theorem , 41 for which particular functions and operators are chosen to derive the inequality above. M. B. Ruskai describes this work in details in 42 and discusses how to prove a large class of new matrix inequalities in the tri-partite and bi-partite cases by taking a partial trace over all but one of the spaces.
