Papyrus 114

Papyrus 114 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
114, is a copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Letter to the Hebrews, containing verses 1:7-12 in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript has been paleographically assigned by the INTF to the 3rd century CE. Papyrologist Philip Comfort dates the manuscript to Middle-Late 3rd century CE.1 The manuscript is currently housed in the Papyrology Rooms (P. Oxy. 4498) of the Sackler Library at Oxford.2
Description
The original manuscript would've been around 15cm x 25cm, with 27 lines per page. There is no extant writing on the opposite side, and so was either blank or contained the Title. The Greek text of this codex is too small to determine its textual character. The handwriting script is representative of the Reformed Documentary style.3
