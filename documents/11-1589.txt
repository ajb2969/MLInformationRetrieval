(protein-PII) uridylyltransferase

In enzymology, a [protein-PII] uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UTP + [protein-PII] 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + uridylyl-[protein-PII]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and protein-PII, whereas its two products are diphosphate and uridylyl-[protein-PII].
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UTP:[protein-PII] uridylyltransferase. Other names in common use include PII uridylyl-transferase, and uridyl removing enzyme. This enzyme participates in two-component system - general.
