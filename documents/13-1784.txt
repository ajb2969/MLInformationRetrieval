Beppo-Levi space

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a Beppo-Levi space, named after Beppo Levi, is a certain space of generalized functions.
In the following, 
 
 
 
  is the space of distributions, 
 
 
 
  is the space of tempered distributions in ,  the differentiation operator with 
 
 
 
  a multi-index, and 
 
 
 
  is the Fourier transform of 
 
 
 
 .
The Beppo-Levi space is



where ⋅{{!}}r,p}} denotes the Sobolev semi-norm.
An alternative definition is as follows: let 
 
 
 
  such that



and define:



Then  is the Beppo-Levi space.
