   Category of elements      Category of elements   In category theory , if C is a category and    F  :   C  →  𝐒𝐞𝐭      normal-:  F   normal-→  C  𝐒𝐞𝐭     F:C\to\mathbf{Set}   is a set-valued functor , the category of elements of F    el   (  F  )      el  F    \mathop{\rm el}(F)   (also denoted by ∫ C F) is the category defined as follows:   Objects are pairs    (  A  ,  a  )     A  a    (A,a)   where    A  ∈   Ob   (  C  )        A   Ob  C     A\in\mathop{\rm Ob}(C)   and    a  ∈   F  A       a    F  A     a\in FA   .  An arrow     (  A  ,  a  )   →   (  B  ,  b  )      normal-→   A  a    B  b     (A,a)\to(B,b)   is an arrow    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\to B   in C such that      (   F  f   )   a   =  b          F  f   a   b    (Ff)a=b   .   A more concise way to state this is that the category of elements of F is the comma category     ∗  ↓  F     fragments  normal-∗  normal-↓  F    \ast\downarrow F   , where   ∗   normal-∗   \ast   is a one-point set. The category of elements of F comes with a natural projection     el   (  F  )    →  C     normal-→   el  F   C    \mathop{\rm el}(F)\to C   that sends an object (A,a) to A, and an arrow     (  A  ,  a  )   →   (  B  ,  b  )      normal-→   A  a    B  b     (A,a)\to(B,b)   to its underlying arrow in C.  The category of elements of a presheaf  Somewhat confusingly in some texts (e.g. Mac Lane, Moerdijk), the category of elements for a presheaf is defined differently. If    P  ∈   C  ^   :=   𝐒𝐞𝐭   C   o  p           P   normal-^  C     assign     superscript  𝐒𝐞𝐭   superscript  C    o  p        P\in\hat{C}:=\mathbf{Set}^{C^{op}}   is a presheaf , the category of elements of P (again denoted by    el   (  P  )      el  P    \mathop{\rm el}(P)   , or, to make the distinction to the above definition clear, ∫ C P) is the category defined as follows:   Objects are pairs    (  A  ,  a  )     A  a    (A,a)   where    A  ∈   Ob   (  C  )        A   Ob  C     A\in\mathop{\rm Ob}(C)   and    a  ∈   P   (  A  )        a    P  A     a\in P(A)   .  An arrow     (  A  ,  a  )   →   (  B  ,  b  )      normal-→   A  a    B  b     (A,a)\to(B,b)   is an arrow    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\to B   in C such that      (   P  f   )   b   =  a          P  f   b   a    (Pf)b=a   .   As one sees, the direction of the arrows is reversed. One can, once again, state this definition in a more concise manner: the category just defined is nothing but     (  ∗  ↓  P  )   op     superscript   fragments  normal-(  normal-∗  normal-↓  P  normal-)   op    (\ast\downarrow P)^{\rm op}   . Consequentially, in the spirit of adding a "co" in front of the name for a construction to denote its opposite, one should rather call this category the category of coelements of P.  For C small , this construction can be extended into a functor ∫ C from    C  ^     normal-^  C    \hat{C}   to   𝐂𝐚𝐭   𝐂𝐚𝐭   \mathbf{Cat}   , the category of small categories . In fact, using the Yoneda lemma one can show that ∫ C P     ≅  𝐲  ↓  P        absent  y    normal-↓    P     \cong\mathop{\textbf{y}}\downarrow P   , where    𝐲  :   C  →   C  ^       normal-:  y   normal-→  C   normal-^  C      \mathop{\textbf{y}}:C\to\hat{C}   is the Yoneda embedding. This isomorphism is natural in P and thus the functor ∫ C is naturally isomorphic to    𝐲  ↓  -  :   C  ^   →  𝐂𝐚𝐭     fragments  y  normal-↓   normal-:   normal-^  C   normal-→  Cat    \mathop{\textbf{y}}\downarrow-:\hat{C}\to\textbf{Cat}   .
