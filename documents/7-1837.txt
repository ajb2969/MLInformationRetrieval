Category of elements

In category theory, if C is a category and 
 
 
 
  is a set-valued functor, the category of elements of F 
 
 
 
  (also denoted by ∫CF) is the category defined as follows:

Objects are pairs 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
An arrow 
 
 
 
  is an arrow 
 
 
 
  in C such that 
 
 
 
 .

A more concise way to state this is that the category of elements of F is the comma category

 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a one-point set. The category of elements of F comes with a natural projection 
 
 
 
  that sends an object (A,a) to A, and an arrow 
 
 
 
  to its underlying arrow in C.
The category of elements of a presheaf
Somewhat confusingly in some texts (e.g. Mac Lane, Moerdijk), the category of elements for a presheaf is defined differently. If 
 
 
 
  is a presheaf, the category of elements of P (again denoted by 
 
 
 
 
 , or, to make the distinction to the above definition clear, ∫C P) is the category defined as follows:

Objects are pairs 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
An arrow 
 
 
 
  is an arrow 
 
 
 
 
  in C such that 
 
 
 
 .

As one sees, the direction of the arrows is reversed. One can, once again, state this definition in a more concise manner: the category just defined is nothing but 
 
 
 
 . Consequentially, in the spirit of adding a "co" in front of the name for a construction to denote its opposite, one should rather call this category the category of coelements of P.
For C small, this construction can be extended into a functor ∫C from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , the category of small categories. In fact, using the Yoneda lemma one can show that ∫CP 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Yoneda embedding. This isomorphism is natural in P and thus the functor ∫C is naturally isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
