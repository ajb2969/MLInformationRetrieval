Boole's inequality

In probability theory, Boole's inequality, also known as the union bound, says that for any finite or countable set of events, the probability that at least one of the events happens is no greater than the sum of the probabilities of the individual events. Boole's inequality is named after George Boole.
Formally, for a countable set of events A1, A2, A3, ..., we have



In measure-theoretic terms, Boole's inequality follows from the fact that a measure (and certainly any probability measure) is σ-sub-additive.
Proof
Boole's inequality may be proved for finite collections of events using the method of induction.
For the 
 
 
 
  case, it follows that



For the case 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Since 
 
 
 
  and because the union operation is associative, we have


 
  Since


 
  by the first axiom of probability, we have


 
 , and therefore


 
 .
Bonferroni inequalities
Boole's inequality may be generalised to find upper and lower bounds on the probability of finite unions of events. These bounds are known as Bonferroni inequalities, after Carlo Emilio Bonferroni, see .
Define


 
  and


 
  and for even k in {2, ..., n},
$${\mathbb P}\biggl( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \biggr) \ge \sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{j-1} S_j.$$
Boole's inequality is recovered by setting k = 1. When k = n, then equality holds and the resulting identity is the inclusion–exclusion principle.
