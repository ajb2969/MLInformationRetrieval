Taurocyamine kinase

In enzymology, a taurocyamine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + taurocyamine 
 
 
 
  ADP + N-phosphotaurocyamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and taurocyamine, whereas its two products are ADP and N-phosphotaurocyamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:taurocyamine N-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include taurocyamine phosphotransferase, and ATP:taurocyamine phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.
