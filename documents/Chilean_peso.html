<h1>Chilean peso</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>peso</strong> is the currency of <a class="uri" href="Chile" title="wikilink">Chile</a>. The current peso has circulated since 1975, with a previous version circulating between 1817 and 1960. The symbol used locally for it is <a href="Dollar_sign" title="wikilink">$</a>. The <a href="ISO_4217" title="wikilink">ISO 4217</a> code for the present peso is <strong>CLP</strong>. It is subdivided into 100 <em>centavos</em>, although no centavo denominated coins remain in circulation. The exchange rate was around 600 Chilean pesos to 1 U.S. dollar at the end of 2014.</p>
<h2 id="first-peso-18171960">First peso, 1817–1960</h2>

<p>The first Chilean peso was introduced in 1817, at a value of 8 <a href="Spanish_colonial_real" title="wikilink">Spanish colonial reales</a>. Until 1851, the peso was subdivided into 8 reales, with the <a href="Chilean_escudo" title="wikilink">escudo</a> worth 2 pesos. In 1835, copper coins denominated in <em>centavos</em> were introduced but it was not until 1851 that the real and escudo denominations ceased to be issued and further issues in centavos and <em>décimos</em> (worth 10 centavos) commenced. Also in 1851, the peso was set equal 5 <a href="French_franc" title="wikilink">French francs</a> on the sild, 22.5 grams pure silver. However, gold coins were issued to a different standard to that of France, with 1 peso = 1.37 grams gold (5 francs equalled 1.45 grams gold). In 1885, a gold standard was adopted, pegging the peso to the <a href="British_pound" title="wikilink">British pound</a> at a rate of 13⅓ pesos = 1 pound (1 peso = 1 <a class="uri" href="shilling" title="wikilink">shilling</a> 6 <a href="penny" title="wikilink">pence</a>). This was reduced in 1926 to 40 pesos = 1 pound (1 peso = 6 pence). From 1925, coins and banknotes were issued denominated in <em>cóndores</em>, worth 10 pesos. The gold standard was suspended in 1932 and the peso's value fell further. The <em><a href="Chilean_escudo" title="wikilink">escudo</a></em> replaced the peso on 1 January 1960 at a rate 1 escudo = 1000 pesos.</p>
<h3 id="coins">Coins</h3>

<p>Between 1817 and 1851, silver coins were issued in denominations of ¼, ½, 1 and 2 reales and 1 peso (also denominated 8 reales), with gold coins for 1, 2, 4 and 8 escudos. In 1835, copper ½ and 1 centavo coins were issued. A full decimal coinage was introduced between 1851 and 1853, consisting of copper ½ and 1 centavo, silver ½ and 1 décimo, 20 and 50 centavos, and 1 peso, and gold 5 and 10 pesos. In 1860, gold 1 peso coins were introduced, followed by <a class="uri" href="cupro-nickel" title="wikilink">cupro-nickel</a> ½, 1 and 2 centavos between 1870 and 1871. Copper coins for these denominations were reintroduced between 1878 and 1883, with copper 2½ centavos added in 1886. A new gold coinage was introduced in 1895, reflecting the lower gold standard, with coins for 2, 5, 10 and 20 pesos. In 1896, the ½ and 1 décimo were replaced by 5 and 10 centavo coins.</p>

<p>In 1907, a short-lived, silver 40 centavo coin was introduced following cessation of production of the 50 centavo coin. In 1919, the last of the copper coins (1 and 2 centavos) were issued. The following year, cu pro-nickel replaced silver in the 5, 10 and 20 centavo coins. A final gold coinage was introduced in 1926, in denominations of 20, 50 and 100 pesos. In 1927, silver 2 and 5 peso coins were issued. Cu pro-nickel 1 peso coins were introduced in 1933, replacing the last of the silver coins. In 1942, copper 20 and 50 centavos and 1 peso coins were introduced. The last coins of the first peso were issued between 1954 and 1959. These were aluminum 1, 5 and 10 pesos.</p>
<h3 id="banknotes">Banknotes</h3>

<p>The first Chilean paper money was issued between 1840 and 1844 by the treasury of the Province of Valdivia, in denominations of 4 and 8 reales. In the 1870s, a number of private banks began issuing paper money, including the <em>Banco Agrícola</em>, the <em>Banco de la Alianza</em>, the <em>Banco de Concepción</em>, the <em>Banco Consolidado de Chile</em>, the <em>Banco de A. Edwards y Cía.</em>, the <em>Banco de Escobar, Ossa y Cía.</em>, the <em>Banco Mobiliario</em>, the <em>Banco Nacional de Chile</em>, the <em>Banco del Pobre</em>, the <em>Banco Sud Americano</em>, the <em>Banco del Sur</em>, the <em>Banco de la Unión</em> and the <em>Banco de Valparaíso</em>. Others followed in the 1880s and 1890s. Denominations included 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 pesos. One bank, the Banco de A. Edwards y Cía., also issued notes denominated in <a href="pounds_sterling" title="wikilink">pounds sterling</a> (<em>libra esterlina</em>).</p>

<p>In 1881, the government issued paper money convertible into silver or gold, in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000 pesos. 50 centavo notes were added in 1891 and 500 pesos in 1912. In 1898, provisional issues were made by the government, consisting of private bank notes overprinted with the words "Emisión Fiscal". This marked the end of the production of private paper money.</p>

<p>In 1925, the <em><a href="Banco_Central_de_Chile" title="wikilink">Banco Central de Chile</a></em> began issuing notes. The first, in denominations of 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000 pesos, were overprints on government notes. In 1927, notes marked as "Billete Provisional" were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 pesos. Regular were introduced between 1931 and 1933, in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 pesos. The 1 and 20 peso notes stopped production in 1943 and 1947, respectively. The remaining denominations continued production until 1959, with a 50,000 peso note added in 1958.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The current peso was introduced on 29 September 1975 by <a class="uri" href="decree" title="wikilink">decree</a> 1,123, replacing the <a href="Chilean_escudo" title="wikilink">escudo</a> at a rate of 1 peso for 1,000 escudos. This peso was subdivided into 100 <a href="centavo" title="wikilink">centavos</a> until 1984.</p>
<h3 id="coins-1">Coins</h3>

<p>In 1975, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 50 centavos and 1 peso. The 1-, 5-, and 10-centavo coins were very similar to the 10-, 50-, and 100-escudo coins they replaced. Since 1983, inflation has left the centavo coins obsolete. Five- and 10-peso coins were introduced in 1976, followed by 50- and 100-peso coins in 1981 and by a 500-peso coin in 2000. Coins currently in circulation are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 pesos; however, most retailers tend to round the prices to the nearest 10 pesos.</p>

<p>Right after the <a href="Government_Junta_of_Chile_(1973)" title="wikilink">military dictatorship</a> in Chile (1973–1990) ended, the obverse designs of the 5- and 10-peso coins were changed. Those coins had born the image of a winged female figure wearing a classical robe and portrayed as if she had just broken a chain binding her two hands together (a length of chain could be seen depending from each of her wrists); beside her appear the date of the <a href="1973_Chilean_coup_d'état" title="wikilink">coup d'état</a> Roman numerals and the word <em></em> (Spanish for "liberty"). After the return of democracy, a design with the portrait of <a href="Bernardo_O'Higgins" title="wikilink">Bernardo O'Higgins</a> was adopted.</p>

<p>In 2001, a newly redesigned 100-peso coin bearing the image of a <a class="uri" href="Mapuche" title="wikilink">Mapuche</a> woman began to circulate. In February, 2010, it was discovered that on the 2008 series of the 50-peso coins the country name "CHILE" had been misspelled as "". The national mint said that it did not plan to recall the coins. Worth about 9 cents (US) each at the time, the faulty coins became collectors' items.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="banknotes-1">Banknotes</h3>

<p>In 1976, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 pesos with the reverses of the three lowest denominations resembling those of the Eº 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 notes they replaced. Inflation has since led to the issue of much higher denominations. Five-hundred-peso notes were introduced in May, 1977, followed by thousand-peso (in June, 1978), 5,000-peso (June, 1981), 10,000-peso (June, 1989), 2,000-peso (December, 1997), and 20,000-peso (December, 1998) notes. The 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-peso banknotes have been replaced by coins, leaving only the 1,000-, 2,000-, 5,000-, 10,000-, and 20,000-peso notes in circulation. Redesigned versions of the four highest denominations were emitted in 2009 and 2010. The popular new 1,000-peso banknote was issued on 11 May 2011.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Since September 2004, the 2,000-peso note has been emitted only as a <a href="polymer_banknote" title="wikilink">polymer banknote</a>; the 5,000-peso note began emission in polymer in September, 2009; and the 1,000-peso note was switched to polymer in May, 2011. This was the first time in Chilean history that a new family of banknotes was put into circulation for other cause than the effects of inflation. , only the 10,000- and 20,000-peso notes are still printed on <a href="cotton_paper" title="wikilink">cotton paper</a>. All new notes have the same 70-mm height, while their length varies in 7-mm steps according to their values: the shortest is the 1,000-peso note and the longest is the 20,000-peso.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The new notes are substantially more difficult to falsify because of new security measures.</p>

<p>The design and production of the whole new family of banknotes was assigned to the Australian company Note Printing Australia Ltd for the 1,000-, 2,000- and 5,000-peso notes. and the Swedish company Crane AB for the 10,000- and 20,000-peso notes <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="in-popular-culture">In popular culture</h2>

<p>Colloquial <a href="Chilean_Spanish" title="wikilink">Chilean Spanish</a> has informal names for some banknotes and coins. These include <em>luca</em> for a thousand pesos, <em>quina</em> for five hundred pesos (<em>quinientos</em> is Spanish for "five hundred"), and <em>gamba</em> for one hundred pesos (can also apply to 100 000 pesos). These names are old: for example gamba and luca applied to 100 and 1000 escudos before 1975.</p>

<p>Also, some banknotes are called informally by the name of the notable citizen printed on it. For example, the five thousand-peso banknote is sometimes called a <em>gabriela</em> (for <a href="Gabriela_Mistral" title="wikilink">Gabriela Mistral</a>), the ten thousand-peso banknote <em>arturo</em> or <em>arturito</em> (for <a href="Arturo_Prat" title="wikilink">Arturo Prat</a>, <em>arturito</em> meaning "little Arturo"); the one thousand-peso note is frequently referred as <em>luca</em>, meaning <em>a thousand</em>, therefore, the two thousand-peso note can be referred as two <em>lucas</em> note, five thousand-peso note as five <em>lucas</em> note, ten thousand as ten <em>lucas</em> note, 1 million pesos as a <em>guatón</em> (fat or pot-bellied man) or <em>palo</em> (stick), and so on.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, depending on context, a <em>gamba</em> might mean one hundred pesos or one hundred thousand pesos. For instance a new computer might be said to cost two <em>gambas</em>. It is obvious that this means two hundred thousand pesos. Less commonly, this applies to <em>luca</em>, taken to mean one million.</p>

<p>Between 1974 and 1979, the Chilean peso was allowed to float within a <a href="Exchange-rate_regime#Pegged_float" title="wikilink">crawling band</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> From June 1979 to 1982 the peso was pegged to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> In June 1982 —during <a href="Crisis_of_1982" title="wikilink">that year's economic crisis</a>— the peso was devalued and different exchange rate regimes were used.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> In August 1984 the peso returned to a system of crawling bands, which were periodically adjusted to reflect differences between external and internal inflation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
