   Gale–Ryser theorem      Gale–Ryser theorem   The Gale–Ryser theorem is a result in graph theory and combinatorial matrix theory , two branches of combinatorics . It provides one of two known approaches solving the bipartite realization problem , i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for two finite sequences of natural numbers to be the degree sequence of a labeled simple  bipartite graph ;a sequence obeying these conditions is called "bigraphic". It is an analog of the Erdős–Gallai theorem for simple graphs. The theorem was published in 1957 by H. J. Ryser and also by David Gale .  Theorem statement  A pair of sequences of nonnegative integers     (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )      subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     (a_{1},\ldots,a_{n})   and    (   b  1   ,  …  ,   b  n   )      subscript  b  1   normal-…   subscript  b  n     (b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})   with     a  1   ≥  ⋯  ≥   a  n          subscript  a  1   normal-⋯        subscript  a  n      a_{1}\geq\cdots\geq a_{n}   is bigraphic if and only if      ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i    =    ∑   i  =  1   n    b  i          superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  a  i      superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  b  i      \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}   and the following inequality holds for k such that    1  ≤  k  ≤  n        1  k       n     1\leq k\leq n   :         ∑   i  =  1   k    a  i    ≤    ∑   i  =  1   n    min   (   b  i   ,  k  )      .        subscript   superscript   k     i  1     subscript  a  i      subscript   superscript   n     i  1       subscript  b  i   k      \sum^{k}_{i=1}a_{i}\leq\sum^{n}_{i=1}\min(b_{i},k).     Remark  Sometimes this theorem is stated with the additional constraint     b  1   ≥  ⋯  ≥   b  n          subscript  b  1   normal-⋯        subscript  b  n      b_{1}\geq\cdots\geq b_{n}   . This condition is not necessary, because the labels of vertices of one partite set in a bipartite graph can be switched arbitrarily. In 1962 Ford and Fulkerson 1 gave a different but equivalent formulation for the theorem.  Other notations  The theorem can also be stated in terms of zero-one matrices . The connection can be seen if one realizes that each bipartite graph has a biadjacency matrix where the column sums and row sums correspond to    (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )      subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     (a_{1},\ldots,a_{n})   and    (   b  1   ,  …  ,   b  n   )      subscript  b  1   normal-…   subscript  b  n     (b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})   . Each sequence can also be considered as a partition of the same number    m  =    ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i        m    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  a  i      m=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}   . It turns out that partition    (   a  1  *   ,  …  ,   a  n  *   )      subscript   superscript  a    1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  a    n     (a^{*}_{1},\ldots,a^{*}_{n})   where     a  k  *   :=   |   {   b  i   |    b  i   ≥  k   }   |      assign   subscript   superscript  a    k      conditional-set   subscript  b  i      subscript  b  i   k       a^{*}_{k}:=|\{b_{i}|b_{i}\geq k\}|   is the conjugate partition of    (   b  1   ,  …  ,   b  n   )      subscript  b  1   normal-…   subscript  b  n     (b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})   . The conjugate partition can be determined by a Ferrers diagram . Moreover, there is a connection to the relation majorization . Consider sequences    (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )      subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     (a_{1},\ldots,a_{n})   ,    (   b  1   ,  …  ,   b  n   )      subscript  b  1   normal-…   subscript  b  n     (b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})   and    (   a  1  *   ,  …  ,   a  n  *   )      subscript   superscript  a    1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  a    n     (a^{*}_{1},\ldots,a^{*}_{n})   as   n   n   n   -dimensional vectors   a   a   a   ,   b   b   b   and    a  *     superscript  a     a^{*}   . Since      ∑   i  =  1   k    a  i  *    =    ∑   i  =  1   n    min   (   b  i   ,  k  )           superscript   subscript     i  1    k    subscript   superscript  a    i      subscript   superscript   n     i  1       subscript  b  i   k      \sum_{i=1}^{k}a^{*}_{i}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\min(b_{i},k)   , the theorem above states that a pair of nonnegative integer sequences a and b with nonincreasing a is bigraphic if and only if the conjugate partition    a  *     superscript  a     a^{*}   of   b   b   b   majorizes   a   a   a   . A third formulation is in terms of degree sequences of simple directed graphs with at most one loop per vertex . In this case the matrix is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of such a directed graph. When are pairs of nonnegative integers     (   (   a  1   ,   b  1   )   ,  …  ,   (   a  n   ,   b  n   )   )       subscript  a  1    subscript  b  1    normal-…    subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n      ((a_{1},b_{1}),...,(a_{n},b_{n}))   the indegree - outdegree pairs of a labeled directed graph with at most one loop per vertex? The theorem can easily be adapted to this formulation, because there does not exist a special order of b.  Proofs  The proof is composed of two parts: the necessity of the condition and its sufficiency. We outline the proof of both parts in the language of matrices. To see that the condition in the theorem is necessary, consider a the adjacency matrix of a bigraphic realization with row sums    (   b  1   ,  …  ,   b  n   )      subscript  b  1   normal-…   subscript  b  n     (b_{1},\ldots,b_{n})   and column sums    (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   )      subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     (a_{1},\ldots,a_{n})   , and shift all ones in the matrix to the left. The row sums remain, while the column sums are now    a  *     superscript  a     a^{*}   . The operation of shifting all ones to the left increases a partition in majorization order, and so    a  *     superscript  a     a^{*}   majorizes   a   a   a   . The original proof of sufficiency of the condition was rather complicated.  gave a simple algorithmic proof. The idea is to start with the Ferrers diagram of   b   b   b   and shift ones to the right until the column sums are   a   a   a   . The algorithm runs in at most   n   n   n   steps, in each of which a single one entry is moved to the right.  Stronger version  Berger 2 proved that it suffices to consider those   k   k   k   th inequalities such that    1  ≤  k  <  n        1  k       n     1\leq k   with     a  k   >   a   k  +  1         subscript  a  k    subscript  a    k  1      a_{k}>a_{k+1}   and the inequality for    k  =  n      k  n    k=n   .  Generalization  A pair of finite sequences of nonnegative integers    a   a   a   and   b   b   b   with nonincreasing   a   a   a   is bigraphic if and only if      ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i    =    ∑   i  =  1   n    b  i          superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  a  i      superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  b  i      \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}   and there exists a sequence   c   c   c   such that the pair    c  ,  b     c  b    c,b   is bigraphic and   c   c   c   majorizes   a   a   a   . 3  Characterizations for similar problems  Similar theorems describe the degree sequences of simple graphs and simple directed graphs. The first problem is characterized by the Erdős–Gallai theorem . The latter case is characterized by the Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem .  Notes  References          .   .
