Glutamine N-acyltransferase




Glutamine N-acyltransferase

In enzymology, a glutamine N-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + L-glutamine 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-acyl-L-glutamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and L-glutamine, whereas its two products are CoA and N-acyl-L-glutamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:L-glutamine N-acyltransferase.
