   Block reflector      Block reflector   "A block reflector is an orthogonal, symmetric matrix that reverses a subspace whose dimension may be greater than one."   see abstract here http://locus.siam.org/SINUM/volume-25/art_0725014.html   It is built out of many elementary reflectors .  It is also referred to as a triangular factor , and is a triangular matrix and they are used in the Householder transformation .  A reflector   Q   Q   Q   belonging to     ‚Ñ≥  n    (   \R   )        subscript  ‚Ñ≥  n   \R    \mathcal{M}_{n}(\R)   can be written in the form :    Q  =   I  -   a  u   u  T         Q    I    a  u   superscript  u  T       Q=I-auu^{T}   where   I   I   I   is the identity matrix for     ‚Ñ≥  n    (   \R   )        subscript  ‚Ñ≥  n   \R    \mathcal{M}_{n}(\R)   ,   a   a   a   is a scalar and   u   u   u   belongs to     \R   ùìÉ     superscript  \R  ùìÉ    \mathcal{\R^{n}}   .  LAPACK routines  Here are some of the LAPACK routines that apply to block reflectors   "*larft" forms the triangular vector T of a block reflector H=I-VTVH.  "*larzb" applies a block reflector or its transpose / conjugate transpose as returned by "*tzrzf" to a general matrix .  "*larzt" forms the triangular vector T of a block reflector H=I-VTVH as returned by "*tzrzf".  "*larfb" applies a block reflector or its transpose / conjugate transpose to a general rectangular matrix.
