   Lyman–Werner photons      Lyman–Werner photons   A Lyman-Werner photon is an ultraviolet  photon with an energy in the range of 11.2 to 13.6 eV , corresponding to the energy range in which the Lyman and Werner absorption bands of molecular hydrogen (H     2     2    {}_{2}   ) are found. A photon in this energy range with a frequency that coincides with that of one of the lines in the Lyman or Werner bands can be absorbed by H     2     2    {}_{2}   , placing the molecule in an excited electronic state. Radiative decay from this excited state occurs rapidly, with roughly 15% of these decays occurring into the vibrational continuum of the molecule, resulting in its dissociation. 1 This two-step photodissociation process, known as the Solomon process, is one of the main mechanisms by which molecular hydrogen is destroyed in the interstellar medium .
