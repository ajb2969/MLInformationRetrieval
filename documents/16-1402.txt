   Shoolery's rule      Shoolery's rule   Shoolery's rule , which is named after James Nelson Shoolery , is a good approximation about Chemical shift  δ of Methylene group in Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy . We can calculate shift of A and B (A–CH 2 –B) .      δ  =     0.23   ppm   +   S  A   +   S  B        δ      0.23  ppm    subscript  S  normal-A    subscript  S  normal-B      \delta=0.23\,\mathrm{ppm}+S_{\mathrm{A}}+S_{\mathrm{B}}   The increments S is calculated by empirical ways.
