   Sphinganine-1-phosphate aldolase      Sphinganine-1-phosphate aldolase   In enzymology , a sphinganine-1-phosphate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sphinganine 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphoethanolamine + palmitaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , sphinganine 1-phosphate , and two products , phosphoethanolamine and palmitaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sphinganine-1-phosphate palmitaldehyde-lyase (phosphoethanolamine-forming) . Other names in common use include dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate aldolase , sphinganine-1-phosphate alkanal-lyase , sphinganine-1-phosphate lyase , and sphinganine-1-phosphate palmitaldehyde-lyase . This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
