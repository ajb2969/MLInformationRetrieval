Maass wave form

In mathematics, a Maass wave form or Maass form is a function on the upper half plane that transforms like a modular form but need not be holomorphic. They were first studied by Hans Maass in .
Definition
Let k be a half-integer, s be a complex number, and Γ be a discrete subgroup of SL2(R). A Maass form of weight k for Γ with Laplace eigenvalue s is a smooth function from the upper half-plane to the complex numbers satisfying the following conditions:

For all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 .
We have 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the weight k hyperbolic laplacian defined as 

-y^{2} \left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}\right) i k y \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right).

The function f is of at most polynomial growth at cusps.

A weak Maass wave form is defined similarly but with the third condition replaced by "The function f has at most linear exponential growth at cusps". Moreover, f is said to be harmonic if it is annihilated by the Laplacian operator.
