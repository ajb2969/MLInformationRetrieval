   Maass wave form      Maass wave form   In mathematics, a Maass wave form or Maass form is a function on the upper half plane that transforms like a modular form but need not be holomorphic . They were first studied by Hans Maass in .  Definition  Let k be a half-integer , s be a complex number, and Γ be a discrete subgroup of SL 2 ( R ) . A Maass form of weight k for Γ with Laplace eigenvalue s is a smooth function from the upper half-plane to the complex numbers satisfying the following conditions:   For all    γ  =   (     a    b      c    d     )   ∈  Γ        γ    a  b    c  d         normal-Γ     \gamma=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{smallmatrix}\right)\in\Gamma   and all    τ  ∈  ℍ      τ  ℍ    \tau\in\mathbb{H}   , we have     f   (     a  τ   +  b     c  τ   +  d    )    =     (    c  τ   +  d   )   k   f   (  τ  )          f        a  τ   b       c  τ   d        superscript      c  τ   d   k   f  τ     f\left(\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)=(c\tau+d)^{k}f(\tau)   .  We have      Δ  k   f   =   s  f          subscript  normal-Δ  k   f     s  f     \Delta_{k}f=sf   , where    Δ  k     subscript  normal-Δ  k    \Delta_{k}   is the weight k hyperbolic laplacian defined as \Delta_{k} =   -y^{2} \left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}\right) i k y \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right).   The function f is of at most polynomial growth at cusps .   A weak Maass wave form is defined similarly but with the third condition replaced by "The function f has at most linear exponential growth at cusps". Moreover, f is said to be harmonic if it is annihilated by the Laplacian operator.  See also   Mock modular form  Real analytic Eisenstein series   References     K. Bringmann, A.
