   Truncation      Truncation   In mathematics and computer science , truncation is limiting the number of digits right of the decimal point .  Truncation and floor function  Truncation of positive real numbers can be done using the floor function . Given a number    x  ∈   ℝ  +       x   subscript  ℝ      x\in\mathbb{R}_{+}   to be truncated and    n  ∈   ℕ  0       n   subscript  ℕ  0     n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}   , the number of elements to be kept behind the decimal point, the truncated value of x is        trunc   (  x  ,  n  )    =    ⌊    10  n   ⋅  x   ⌋    10  n     .       trunc  x  n        normal-⋅   superscript  10  n   x     superscript  10  n      \operatorname{trunc}(x,n)=\frac{\lfloor 10^{n}\cdot x\rfloor}{10^{n}}.     However, for negative numbers truncation does not round in the same direction as the floor function: truncation always rounds toward zero, the floor function rounds towards negative infinity.  Causes of truncation  With computers, truncation can occur when a decimal number is typecast as an integer ; it is truncated to zero decimal digits because integers cannot store real numbers (that are not themselves integers).  In algebra  An analogue of truncation can be applied to polynomials . In this case, the truncation of a polynomial P to degree n can be defined as the sum of all terms of P of degree n or less. Polynomial truncations arise in the study of Taylor polynomials , for example. 1  See also   Arithmetic precision  Floor function  Quantization (signal processing)  Precision (computer science)  Truncation (statistics)   References  External links   Wall paper applet that visualizes errors due to finite precision   ja:端数処理 "  Category:Numerical analysis     ↩
