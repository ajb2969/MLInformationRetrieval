   Saccharopine dehydrogenase (NAD+, L-glutamate-forming)      Saccharopine dehydrogenase (NAD+, L-glutamate-forming)   In enzymology , a saccharopine dehydrogenase (NAD+, L-glutamate-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 6 -(L-1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-glutamate + 2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N6-(L-1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are L-glutamate , 2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6-(L-1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (L-glutamate-forming) . Other names in common use include dehydrogenase, saccharopine (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, , glutamate-forming) , saccharopin dehydrogenase , NAD+ oxidoreductase (L-2-aminoadipic-delta-semialdehyde and , glutamate forming) , aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase , saccharopine dehydrogenase (NAD+, L-glutamate-forming) , 6-N-(L-1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-L-lysine:NAD+ oxidoreductase , and (L-glutamate-forming) . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 1.5.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
