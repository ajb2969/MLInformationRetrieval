   Diagonal matrix      Diagonal matrix   In linear algebra , a diagonal matrix is a matrix (usually a square matrix ) in which the entries outside the main diagonal (‚Üò) are all zero. The diagonal entries themselves may or may not be zero. Thus, the matrix with n columns and n rows is diagonal if:        d   i  ,  j    =   0  if  i   ‚â†    j    ‚àÄ  i     ,   j  ‚àà   {  1  ,  2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  n  }       formulae-sequence       subscript  d   i  j      0  if  i          j   for-all  i        j   1  2  normal-‚Ä¶  n      d_{i,j}=0\text{ if }i\neq j\ \forall i,j\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}     For example, the following matrix is diagonal:      [     1    0    0      0    4    0      0    0     -  2      ]      1  0  0    0  4  0    0  0    2      \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\
 0&4&0\\
 0&0&-2\end{bmatrix}     The term diagonal matrix may sometimes refer to a rectangular diagonal matrix , which is an m -by- n matrix with all the entries not of the form d i , i being zero. For example:      [     1    0    0      0    4    0      0    0     -  3       0    0    0     ]      1  0  0    0  4  0    0  0    3     0  0  0     \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\
 0&4&0\\
 0&0&-3\\
 0&0&0\\
 \end{bmatrix}   or    [     1    0    0    0    0      0    4    0    0    0      0    0     -  3     0    0     ]      1  0  0  0  0    0  4  0  0  0    0  0    3   0  0     \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0&0\\
 0&4&0&0&0\\
 0&0&-3&0&0\end{bmatrix}     However, in the remainder of this article we will consider only square matrices. Any square diagonal matrix is also a symmetric matrix . Also, if the entries come from the field  R or C , then it is a normal matrix as well. Equivalently, we can define a diagonal matrix as a matrix that is both upper- and lower-triangular . The identity matrix  I n and any square zero matrix are diagonal. A one-dimensional matrix is always diagonal.  Scalar matrix  A diagonal matrix with all its main diagonal entries equal is a scalar matrix , that is, a scalar multiple ŒªI of the identity matrix  I . Its effect on a vector is scalar multiplication by Œª . For example, a 3√ó3 scalar matrix has the form:       [     Œª    0    0      0    Œª    0      0    0    Œª     ]   ‚â°   Œª   ùë∞  3          Œª  0  0    0  Œª  0    0  0  Œª      Œª   subscript  ùë∞  3      \begin{bmatrix}\lambda&0&0\\
 0&\lambda&0\\
 0&0&\lambda\end{bmatrix}\equiv\lambda\boldsymbol{I}_{3}     The scalar matrices are the center of the algebra of matrices: that is, they are precisely the matrices that commute with all other square matrices of the same size.  For an abstract vector space V (rather than the concrete vector space    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   ), or more generally a module  M over a ring  R , with the endomorphism algebra End( M ) (algebra of linear operators on M ) replacing the algebra of matrices, the analog of scalar matrices are scalar transformations . Formally, scalar multiplication is a linear map, inducing a map     R  ‚Üí   End   (  M  )     ,     normal-‚Üí  R   End  M     R\to\operatorname{End}(M),   (send a scalar Œª to the corresponding scalar transformation, multiplication by Œª ) exhibiting End( M ) as a R - algebra . For vector spaces, or more generally free modules     M  ‚âÖ   R  n       M   superscript  R  n     M\cong R^{n}   , for which the endomorphism algebra is isomorphic to a matrix algebra, the scalar transforms are exactly the center of the endomorphism algebra, and similarly invertible transforms are the center of the general linear group GL( V ), where they are denoted by Z( V ), follow the usual notation for the center.  Matrix operations  The operations of matrix addition and matrix multiplication are especially simple for diagonal matrices. Write for a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries starting in the upper left corner are a 1 , ..., a n . Then, for addition, we have   + =    and for matrix multiplication ,   ¬∑ = .   The diagonal matrix is invertible  if and only if the entries a 1 , ..., a n are all non-zero. In this case, we have   = .   In particular, the diagonal matrices form a subring of the ring of all n -by- n matrices.  Multiplying an n -by- n matrix A from the left with amounts to multiplying the i th row of A by a i for all i ; multiplying the matrix A from the right with amounts to multiplying the i th column of A by a i for all i .  Operator matrix in eigenbasis  As explained in determining coefficients of operator matrix , there is a special basis, e 1 , ..., e n , for which the matrix takes the diagonal form. Being diagonal means that all coefficients    a   i  ,  j      subscript  a   i  j     a_{i,j}   but    a   i  ,  i      subscript  a   i  i     a_{i,i}   are zeros in the defining equation     A    e  ‚Üí   j    =   ‚àë    a   i  ,  j      e  ‚Üí   i           A   subscript   normal-‚Üí  e   j         subscript  a   i  j     subscript   normal-‚Üí  e   i       A\vec{e}_{j}=\sum a_{i,j}\vec{e}_{i}   , leaving only one term per sum. The surviving diagonal elements,    a   i  ,  i      subscript  a   i  i     a_{i,i}   , are known as eigenvalues and designated with    Œª  i     subscript  Œª  i    \lambda_{i}   in the equation, which reduces to     A    e  ‚Üí   i    =    Œª  i     e  ‚Üí   i          A   subscript   normal-‚Üí  e   i       subscript  Œª  i    subscript   normal-‚Üí  e   i      A\vec{e}_{i}=\lambda_{i}\vec{e}_{i}   . The resulting equation is known as eigenvalue equation 1 and used to derive the characteristic polynomial and, further, eigenvalues and eigenvectors .  In other words, the eigenvalues of are Œª 1 , ..., Œª n with associated eigenvectors of e 1 , ..., e n .  Other properties  The determinant of is the product a 1 ... a n .  The adjugate of a diagonal matrix is again diagonal.  A square matrix is diagonal if and only if it is triangular and normal .  Uses  Diagonal matrices occur in many areas of linear algebra. Because of the simple description of the matrix operation and eigenvalues/eigenvectors given above, it is always desirable to represent a given matrix or linear map by a diagonal matrix.  In fact, a given n -by- n matrix A is similar to a diagonal matrix (meaning that there is a matrix X such that X ‚àí1 AX is diagonal) if and only if it has n  linearly independent eigenvectors. Such matrices are said to be diagonalizable .  Over the field of real or complex numbers, more is true. The spectral theorem says that every normal matrix is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix (if AA ‚àó = A ‚àó A then there exists a unitary matrix  U such that UAU ‚àó is diagonal). Furthermore, the singular value decomposition implies that for any matrix A , there exist unitary matrices U and V such that UAV ‚àó is diagonal with positive entries.  Operator theory  In operator theory , particularly the study of PDEs , operators are particularly easy to understand and PDEs easy to solve if the operator is diagonal with respect to the basis with which one is working; this corresponds to a separable partial differential equation . Therefore, a key technique to understanding operators is a change of coordinates ‚Äì in the language of operators, an integral transform ‚Äì which changes the basis to an eigenbasis of eigenfunctions : which makes the equation separable. An important example of this is the Fourier transform , which diagonalizes constant coefficient differentiation operators (or more generally translation invariant operators), such as the Laplacian operator, say, in the heat equation .  Especially easy are multiplication operators , which are defined as multiplication by (the values of) a fixed function ‚Äì the values of the function at each point correspond to the diagonal entries of a matrix.
