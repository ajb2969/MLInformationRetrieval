Hectogon

In geometry, a hectogon or hecatontagon12 is a hundred-sided polygon.34 The sum of any hectogon's interior angles is 17640 degrees.
A regular hectogon is represented by Schl채fli symbol {100} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated pentacontagon, t{50}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular hectogon properties
One interior angle in a regular hectogon is 176.4째, meaning that one exterior angle would be 3.6째.
The area of a regular hectogon is (with )



and its inradius is



The circumradius of a regular hectogon is



A regular hectogon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge,5 and is not constructible even if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.6
Hectogram
A hectogram is an 100-sided star polygon. There are 19 regular forms7 given by Schl채fli symbols {100/3}, {100/7}, {100/9}, {100/11}, {100/13}, {100/17}, {100/19}, {100/21}, {100/23}, {100/27}, {100/29}, {100/31}, {100/33}, {100/37}, {100/39}, {100/41}, {100/43}, {100/47}, and {100/49}, as well as 30 regular star figures with the same vertex configuration.
