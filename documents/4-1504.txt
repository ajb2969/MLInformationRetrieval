   Laver table      Laver table   In mathematics , Laver tables (named after Richard Laver , who discovered them towards the end of the 1980s in connection with his works on set theory ) are tables of numbers that have certain properties.  Definition  For a given a natural number  n , one can define the n -th Laver table (with 2 n rows and columns) by setting        L  n    (  p  ,  q  )    :=   p  ⋆  q      assign     subscript  L  n    p  q     normal-⋆  p  q     L_{n}(p,q):=p\star q   ,  where p denotes the row and q denotes the column of the entry. Define       p  ⋆  1   :=    p  +  1   mod   2  n       assign   normal-⋆  p  1    modulo    p  1    superscript  2  n      p\star 1:=p+1\mod 2^{n}     and then calculate the remaining entries of each row from the m -th to the first using the equation       p  ⋆   (   q  ⋆  r   )    :=    (   p  ⋆  q   )   ⋆   (   p  ⋆  r   )       assign   normal-⋆  p   normal-⋆  q  r     normal-⋆   normal-⋆  p  q    normal-⋆  p  r      p\star(q\star r):=(p\star q)\star(p\star r)     The resulting table is then called the n -th Laver table; for example, for n = 2, we have:       1   2   3   4     1   2   4   2   4     2   3   4   3   4     3   4   4   4   4     4   1   2   3   4     There is no known closed-form expression to calculate the entries of a Laver table directly. 1  Periodicity  When looking at the first row of entries in a Laver table, it can be seen that the entries repeat with a certain periodicity m . This periodicity is always a power of 2; the first few periodicities are 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 16, 16, ... . The sequence is increasing, and it was proved in 1995 by Richard Laver that under the assumption that there exists a rank-into-rank (a large cardinal ), it actually increases without bound. 2 Nevertheless, it grows extremely slowly; Randall Dougherty showed that the first n for which the table entries' period can possibly be 32 is A(9,A(8,A(8,255))), where A denotes the Ackermann function . 3  References  Further reading   Patrick Dehornoy, " Das Unendliche als Quelle der Erkenntnis ", in: Spektrum der Wissenschaft Spezial 1/2001, pp. 86–90  Patrick Dehornoy, Diagrams colourings and applications , Proceedings of the East Asian School of Knots, Links and Related Topics, 2004 ( online )   "  Category:Mathematical logic  Category:Combinatorics     .
