Unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase

Unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase (, YteR, YesR) is an enzyme with system name 2-O-(4-deoxy-beta-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose hydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-O-(4-deoxy-beta-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose + H2O 
 
 
 
  5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate + L-rhamnopyranose


The enzyme is part of the degradation system for rhamnogalacturonan I in Bacillus subtilis strain 168.
