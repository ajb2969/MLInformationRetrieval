   Unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase      Unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase   Unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase (, YteR , YesR ) is an enzyme with system name 2-O-(4-deoxy-beta-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose hydrolase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2-O-(4-deoxy-beta-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate + L- rhamnopyranose    The enzyme is part of the degradation system for rhamnogalacturonan I in Bacillus subtilis strain 168.
