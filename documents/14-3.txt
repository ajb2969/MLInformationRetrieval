Cartan's lemma

In mathematics, Cartan's lemma refers to a number of results named after either Élie Cartan or his son Henri Cartan:

In exterior algebra:1 Suppose that v1, ..., vp are linearly independent elements of a vector space V and w1, ..., wp are such that








in ΛV. Then there are scalars hij = hji such that
 
 





In several complex variables:2 Let  and  and define rectangles in the complex plane C by







K_1 &= \{ z_1=x_1+iy_1 | a_2 

so that 
 
 
 
 . Let K2, ..., Kn be simply connected domains in C and let
 
 :


K &= K_1\times K_2\times\cdots \times K_n\\ K' &= K_1'\times K_2\times\cdots \times K_n\\ K'' &= K_1''\times K_2\times\cdots \times K_n \end{align}

so that again 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that F(z) is a complex analytic matrix-valued function on a rectangle K in Cn such that F(z) is an invertible matrix for each z in K. Then there exist analytic functions 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that
 
 



in K.
 


In potential theory, a result that estimates the Hausdorff measure of the set on which a logarithmic Newtonian potential is small. See Cartan's lemma (potential theory).
