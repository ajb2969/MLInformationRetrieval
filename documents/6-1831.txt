   Mean time between coincidences      Mean time between coincidences   The mean time between coincidences ( MTBC ) is used in safety engineering and is defined as the reciprocal of the average frequency of dangerous coincidences :       M  T  B  C   =   1    λ   d    =   2    λ    μ    τ             M  T  B  C     1   subscript  λ  d           2    λ  μ  τ       MTBC=\frac{1}{\lambda\ _{d}}=\frac{2}{\lambda\ \mu\ \tau\ }     "  Category:Safety engineering  Category:Reliability engineering
