   3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase      3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase () also known as β-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase or 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (HIBADH) is an enzyme 1 that in humans is encoded by the HIBADH  gene . 2  3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase catalyzes the chemical reaction :   3-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation .  Function  3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase is a tetrameric mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the NAD + -dependent, reversible oxidation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, an intermediate of valine catabolism, to methylmalonate semialdehyde. 3  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
