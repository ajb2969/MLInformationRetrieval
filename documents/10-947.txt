Pimeloyl-CoA dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a pimeloyl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

pimeloyl-CoA + NAD+

 
  6-carboxyhex-2-enoyl-CoA + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pimeloyl-CoA and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 6-carboxyhex-2-enoyl-CoA, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pimeloyl-CoA:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
