   Bernstein polynomial      Bernstein polynomial   In the mathematical field of numerical analysis , a Bernstein polynomial , named after Sergei Natanovich Bernstein , is a polynomial in the Bernstein form , that is a linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials .  A numerically stable way to evaluate polynomials in Bernstein form is de Casteljau's algorithm .  Polynomials in Bernstein form were first used by Bernstein in a constructive proof for the Stone–Weierstrass approximation theorem . With the advent of computer graphics, Bernstein polynomials, restricted to the interval x ∈ [0, 1], became important in the form of Bézier curves .  Definition  The n + 1 Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n are defined as          b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )    =    (     n      ν     )    x  ν     (   1  -  x   )    n  -  ν      ,   ν  =   0  ,  …  ,  n     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  b   ν  n    x      binomial  n  ν    superscript  x  ν    superscript    1  x     n  ν        ν   0  normal-…  n      b_{\nu,n}(x)={n\choose\nu}x^{\nu}\left(1-x\right)^{n-\nu},\quad\nu=0,\ldots,n.     where    (      n      ν      )     binomial  n  ν    {n\choose\nu}   is a binomial coefficient .  The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree n form a basis for the vector space Π n of polynomials of degree at most n .  A linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials        B  n    (  x  )    =    ∑   ν  =  0   n     β  ν    b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )            subscript  B  n   x     superscript   subscript     ν  0    n      subscript  β  ν    subscript  b   ν  n    x      B_{n}(x)=\sum_{\nu=0}^{n}\beta_{\nu}b_{\nu,n}(x)     is called a Bernstein polynomial or polynomial in Bernstein form of degree n . The coefficients    β  ν     subscript  β  ν    \beta_{\nu}   are called Bernstein coefficients or Bézier coefficients .  Example  The first few Bernstein basis polynomials are:       b   0  ,  0     (  x  )        subscript  b   0  0    x    \displaystyle b_{0,0}(x)     Properties  The Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties:         b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )    =  0         subscript  b   ν  n    x   0    b_{\nu,n}(x)=0   , if    ν  <  0      ν  0    \nu<0   or    ν  >  n      ν  n    \nu>n   .        b   ν  ,  n     (  0  )    =   δ   ν  ,  0           subscript  b   ν  n    0    subscript  δ   ν  0      b_{\nu,n}(0)=\delta_{\nu,0}   and      b   ν  ,  n     (  1  )    =   δ   ν  ,  n           subscript  b   ν  n    1    subscript  δ   ν  n      b_{\nu,n}(1)=\delta_{\nu,n}   where   δ   δ   \delta   is the Kronecker delta function.       b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )        subscript  b   ν  n    x    b_{\nu,n}(x)   has a root with multiplicity   ν   ν   \nu   at point    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   (note: if    ν  =  0      ν  0    \nu=0   , there is no root at 0).       b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )        subscript  b   ν  n    x    b_{\nu,n}(x)   has a root with multiplicity    (   n  -  ν   )      n  ν    \left(n-\nu\right)   at point    x  =  1      x  1    x=1   (note: if    ν  =  n      ν  n    \nu=n   , there is no root at 1).        b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )    ≥  0         subscript  b   ν  n    x   0    b_{\nu,n}(x)\geq 0   for    x  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       x   0  1     x\in[0,\ 1]   .        b   ν  ,  n     (   1  -  x   )    =    b    n  -  ν   ,  n     (  x  )           subscript  b   ν  n      1  x       subscript  b     n  ν   n    x     b_{\nu,n}\left(1-x\right)=b_{n-\nu,n}(x)   .    The derivative can be written as a combination of two polynomials of lower degree:        b   ν  ,  n   ′    (  x  )    =   n   (     b    ν  -  1   ,   n  -  1      (  x  )    -    b   ν  ,   n  -  1      (  x  )     )     .         subscript   superscript  b  normal-′    ν  n    x     n       subscript  b     ν  1     n  1     x      subscript  b   ν    n  1     x       b^{\prime}_{\nu,n}(x)=n\left(b_{\nu-1,n-1}(x)-b_{\nu,n-1}(x)\right).       The integral is constant for a given   n   n   n           ∫  0  1     b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )   d  x    =   1   n  +  1     ;    ∀  ν   =   0  ,   1  …  n        formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript   0   1      subscript  b   ν  n    x  d  x      1    n  1        for-all  ν    0    1  normal-…  n       \int_{0}^{1}b_{\nu,n}(x)dx=\frac{1}{n+1};\forall\nu=0,1\dots n       If    n  ≠  0      n  0    n\neq 0   , then     b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )        subscript  b   ν  n    x    b_{\nu,n}(x)   has a unique local maximum on the interval    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,\ 1]   at    x  =   ν  n       x    ν  n     x=\frac{\nu}{n}   . This maximum takes the value:       ν  ν    n   -  n      (   n  -  ν   )    n  -  ν     (     n      ν     )    .       superscript  ν  ν    superscript  n    n     superscript    n  ν     n  ν     binomial  n  ν     \nu^{\nu}n^{-n}\left(n-\nu\right)^{n-\nu}{n\choose\nu}.       The Bernstein basis polynomials of degree   n   n   n   form a partition of unity :       ∑   ν  =  0   n     b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )     =    ∑   ν  =  0   n     (     n      ν     )    x  ν     (   1  -  x   )    n  -  ν      =    (   x  +   (   1  -  x   )    )   n   =  1.          superscript   subscript     ν  0    n      subscript  b   ν  n    x      superscript   subscript     ν  0    n      binomial  n  ν    superscript  x  ν    superscript    1  x     n  ν            superscript    x    1  x    n        1.     \sum_{\nu=0}^{n}b_{\nu,n}(x)=\sum_{\nu=0}^{n}{n\choose\nu}x^{\nu}\left(1-x%

Approximating continuous functions  Let ƒ be a continuous function on the interval [0, 1]. Consider the Bernstein polynomial         B  n    (  f  )    (  x  )    =    ∑   ν  =  0   n    f   (   ν  n   )    b   ν  ,  n     (  x  )      .         subscript  B  n   f  x     superscript   subscript     ν  0    n     f    ν  n    subscript  b   ν  n    x      B_{n}(f)(x)=\sum_{\nu=0}^{n}f\left(\frac{\nu}{n}\right)b_{\nu,n}(x).     It can be shown that        lim   n  →  ∞      B  n    (  f  )    (  x  )     =   f   (  x  )          subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  B  n   f  x      f  x     \lim_{n\to\infty}{B_{n}(f)(x)}=f(x)\,     uniformly on the interval [0, 1]. 1 This is a stronger statement than the proposition that the limit holds for each value of x separately; that would be pointwise convergence rather than uniform convergence . Specifically, the word uniformly signifies that        lim   n  →  ∞     sup   {   |    f   (  x  )    -    B  n    (  f  )    (  x  )     |   :   0  ≤  x  ≤   1    }     =  0.        subscript    normal-→  n      supremum   conditional-set        f  x      subscript  B  n   f  x         0  x       1       0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup\left\{\,\left|f(x)-B_{n}(f)(x)\right|\,:\,0\leq x\leq 1%
 \,\right\}=0.     Bernstein polynomials thus afford one way to prove the Weierstrass approximation theorem that every real-valued continuous function on a real interval [ a , b ] can be uniformly approximated by polynomial functions over R . 2  A more general statement for a function with continuous k th derivative is        ∥    B  n     (  f  )    (  k  )     ∥   ∞   ≤      (  n  )   k    n  k      ∥   f   (  k  )    ∥   ∞   and    ∥    f   (  k  )    -    B  n     (  f  )    (  k  )      ∥   ∞    →  0         subscript   norm     subscript  B  n    superscript  f  k            subscript  n  k    superscript  n  k     subscript   norm   superscript  f  k      and   subscript   norm     superscript  f  k      subscript  B  n    superscript  f  k           normal-→    0     {\left\|B_{n}(f)^{(k)}\right\|}_{\infty}\leq\frac{(n)_{k}}{n^{k}}\left\|f^{(k)%
 }\right\|_{\infty}\text{ and }\left\|f^{(k)}-B_{n}(f)^{(k)}\right\|_{\infty}\to
 0     where additionally         (  n  )   k    n  k    =    (   1  -   0  n    )    (   1  -   1  n    )   ⋯   (   1  -    k  -  1   n    )           subscript  n  k    superscript  n  k        1    0  n      1    1  n    normal-⋯    1      k  1   n       \frac{(n)_{k}}{n^{k}}=\left(1-\frac{0}{n}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)%
 \cdots\left(1-\frac{k-1}{n}\right)     is an eigenvalue of B n ; the corresponding eigenfunction is a polynomial of degree k .  Proof  Suppose K is a random variable distributed as the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with probability x of success on each trial; in other words, K has a binomial distribution with parameters n and x . Then we have the expected value E( K / n ) = x .  By the weak law of large numbers of probability theory ,       lim   n  →  ∞    P   (  |   K  n   -  x  |  >  δ  )   =  0     fragments   subscript    normal-→  n     P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|    K  n    x  normal-|   δ  normal-)    0    \lim_{n\to\infty}{P\left(\left|\frac{K}{n}-x\right|>\delta\right)}=0   for every δ > 0. Moreover, this relation holds uniformly in x , which can be seen from its proof via Chebyshev's inequality , taking into account that the variance of K / n , equal to x (1- x )/ n , is bounded from above by 1/(4 n ) irrespective of x .  Because ƒ , being continuous on a closed bounded interval, must be uniformly continuous on that interval, one infers a statement of the form       lim   n  →  ∞    P   (  |  f   (   K  n   )   -  f   (  x  )   |  >  ε  )   =  0     fragments   subscript    normal-→  n     P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  f   fragments  normal-(    K  n   normal-)    f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-|   ε  normal-)    0    \lim_{n\to\infty}{P\left(\left|f\left(\frac{K}{n}\right)-f\left(x\right)\right%
 |>\varepsilon\right)}=0   uniformly in x . Taking into account that ƒ is bounded (on the given interval) one gets for the expectation        lim   n  →  ∞     E   (   |    f   (   K  n   )    -   f   (  x  )     |   )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n       E        f    K  n      f  x       0    \lim_{n\to\infty}{E\left(\left|f\left(\frac{K}{n}\right)-f\left(x\right)\right%
 |\right)}=0   uniformly in x . To this end one splits the sum for the expectation in two parts. On one part the difference does not exceed ε; this part cannot contribute more than ε. On the other part the difference exceeds ε, but does not exceed 2 M , where M is an upper bound for | ƒ (x)|; this part cannot contribute more than 2 M times the small probability that the difference exceeds ε.  Finally, one observes that the absolute value of the difference between expectations never exceeds the expectation of the absolute value of the difference, and that E( ƒ ( K / n )) is just the Bernstein polynomial B n ( ƒ , x ).
