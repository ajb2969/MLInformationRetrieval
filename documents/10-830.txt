   (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline N-methyltransferase      (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline N-methyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction : 1    S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methyl-(RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline   This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis .  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(RS)-1-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline N-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called norreticuline N-methyltransferase .
