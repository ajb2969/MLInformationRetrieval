Coreflexive relation

In mathematics, a coreflexive relation is a binary relation that is a subset of the identity relation.1 Thus if a is related to b (aRb) then a is equal to b (a = b), but if c is equal to d (c = d) it does not necessarily hold that c is related to d (cRd).
In mathematical notation, this is:



The identity relation is coreflexive by definition. Any relation that is coreflexive is thus a subset of the identity relation.
For example, consider the relation R as "equal to and odd". Over the set of positive integers, the relationship R holds over the pairs {(1, 1), (3, 3), ...} but does not hold over {(2, 2), (4, 4), ...}.
