The first six triangular numbers

A triangular number or triangle number counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle, as in the diagram on the right. The nth triangle number is the number of dots composing a triangle with 
 
 
 
  dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the 
 
 
natural numbers from 1 to 
 
 
 
 . The sequence of triangular numbers , starting at the 0th triangular number, is:

0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406 …
 

The triangle numbers are given by the following explicit formulas:



where 
 
 
 
  is a binomial coefficient. It represents the number of distinct pairs that can be selected from n + 1 objects, and it is read aloud as "n plus one choose two".
Carl Friedrich Gauss is said to have discovered this relationship early on in his youth,1 though some find it likely that its origin goes back to the Pythagoreans 5th century BC.2 It was not, however, until 1496 the formula was documented. This was in the book Elementa Arithmetica that contains the sequence 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 (the sums: 1, 1+2,...,1+2+3+4+5+6+7). Title : Elementa arithmetica... ([Reprod.])

The triangular number  solves the "handshake problem" of counting the number of handshakes if each person in a room with n + 1 people shakes hands once with each person. In other words, the solution to the handshake problem of n people is Tn−1.3 The function 
 
 
 
  is the additive analog of the factorial function, which is the products of integers from 1 to n.
The number of line segments between closest pairs of dots in the triangle can be represented in terms of the number of dots or with a recurrence relation:



In the limit, the ratio between the two numbers, dots and line segments is



Relations to other figurate numbers
Triangular numbers have a wide variety of relations to other figurate numbers.
Most simply, the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers is a square number, with the sum being the square of the difference between the two (and thus the difference of the two being the square root of the sum). Algebraically,



Alternatively, the same fact can be demonstrated graphically:




6 + 10 = 16

10 + 15 = 25

There are infinitely many triangular numbers that are also square numbers; e.g., 1, 36. Some of them can be generated by a simple recursive formula:


 
  with 
 
 

All square triangular numbers are found from the recursion


 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Also, the square of the nth triangular number is the same as the sum of the cubes of the integers 1 to n.
The sum of the all triangular numbers up to the nth triangular number is the nth tetrahedral number,



More generally, the difference between the nth m-gonal number and the nth 
 
 
 
 -gonal number is the 
 
 
 
 th triangular number. For example, the sixth heptagonal number (81) minus the sixth hexagonal number (66) equals the fifth triangular number, 15. Every other triangular number is a hexagonal number. Knowing the triangular numbers, one can reckon any centered polygonal number: the nth centered k-gonal number is obtained by the formula



where 
 
 
 
  is a triangular number.
The positive difference of two triangular numbers is a trapezoidal number.
Other properties
Triangular numbers correspond to the first-degree case of Faulhaber's formula.
Every even perfect number is triangular, given by the formula


 
  where 



 is a Mersenne prime. No odd perfect numbers are known, hence all known perfect numbers are triangular.
For example, the third triangular number is (3 × 2 =) 6, the seventh is (7 × 4 =) 28, the 31st is (31 × 16 =) 496, and the 127th is (127 × 64 =) 8128.
In base 10, the digital root of a nonzero triangular number is always 1, 3, 6, or 9. Hence every triangular number is either divisible by three or has a remainder of 1 when divided by nine:

0 = 9 × 0
 
1 = 9 × 0 + 1
 
3 = 9 × 0 + 3
 
6 = 9 × 0 + 6
 
10 = 9 × 1 + 1
 
15 = 9 × 1 + 6
 
21 = 9 × 2 + 3
 
28 = 9 × 3 + 1
 
36 = 9 × 4
 
45 = 9 × 5
 
55 = 9 × 6 + 1
 
66 = 9 × 7 + 3
 
78 = 9 × 8 + 6
 
91 = 9 × 10 + 1
 
…
 

The digital root pattern for triangular numbers, repeating every nine terms, as shown above, is "1, 3, 6, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 9".
The converse of the statement above is, however, not always true. For example, the digital root of 12, which is not a triangular number, is 3 and divisible by three.
If 
 
 
 
  is a triangular number, then 
 
 
 
  is also a triangular number, given 
 
 
 
  is an odd square and 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 

Note that 
 
 
 
  will always be a triangular number, because , which yields all the odd squares are revealed by multiplying a triangular number by 8 and adding 1, and the process for 
 
 
 
  given a is an odd square is the inverse of this operation.
The first several pairs of this form (not counting 
 
 
 
 ) are: 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , … etc. Given 
 
 
 
  is equal to , these formulas yield , , , , and so on.
The sum of the reciprocals of all the nonzero triangular numbers is:



This can be shown by using the basic sum of a telescoping series:



Two other interesting formulas regarding triangular numbers are:



and


 
  both of which can easily be established either by looking at dot patterns (see above) or with some simple algebra.
In 1796, German mathematician and scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three triangular numbers, writing in his diary his famous words, "EΥΡHKA! num = Δ + Δ + Δ". Note that this theorem does not imply that the triangular numbers are different (as in the case of 20 = 10 + 10), nor that a solution with exactly three nonzero triangular numbers must exist. This is a special case of Fermat's Polygonal Number Theorem.
The largest triangular number of the form  is 4095 (see Ramanujan–Nagell equation).
Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński posed the question as to the existence of four distinct triangular numbers in geometric progression. It was conjectured by Polish mathematician Kazimierz Szymiczek to be impossible. This conjecture was proven by Fang and Chen in 2007.45
Applications
A fully connected network of 
 
 
 
  computing devices requires the presence of  cables or other connections; this is equivalent to the handshake problem mentioned above.
In a tournament format that uses a round-robin group stage, the number of matches that need to be played between n teams is equal to the triangular number . For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches. This is also equivalent to the handshake problem and fully connected network problems.
One way of calculating the depreciation of an asset is the sum-of-years' digits method, which involves finding , where 
 
 
 
  is the length in years of the asset's useful life. Each year, the item loses , where 
 
 
 
  is the item's beginning value (in units of currency), 
 
 
 
  is its final salvage value, 
 
 
 
  is the total number of years the item is usable, and 
 
 
 
  the current year in the depreciation schedule. Under this method, an item with a usable life of 
 
 
 
  = 4 years would lose 4/10 of its "losable" value in the first year, 3/10 in the second, 2/10 in the third, and 1/10 in the fourth, accumulating a total depreciation of 10/10 (the whole) of the losable value.
Triangular roots and tests for triangular numbers
By analogy with the square root of 
 
 
 
 , one can define the (positive) triangular root of 
 
 
 
  as the number n such that :6



which follows immediately from the quadratic formula. So an integer 
 
 
 
  is triangular if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a square. Equivalently, if the positive triangular root 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is an integer, then 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 th triangular number.7
