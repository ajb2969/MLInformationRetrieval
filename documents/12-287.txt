   Hartree equation      Hartree equation   In 1927, a year after the publication of the Schrödinger equation , Hartree formulated what are now known as the Hartree equations for atoms, using the concept of self-consistency that Lindsay had introduced in his study of many electron systems in the context of Bohr theory . Hartree assumed that the nucleus together with the electrons formed a spherically symmetric field. The charge distribution of each electron was the solution of the Schrödinger equation for an electron in a potential    v   (  r  )       v  r    v(r)   , derived from the field. Self-consistency required that the final field, computed from the solutions was self-consistent with the initial field and he called his method the self-consistent field method.  In order to solve the equation of an electron in a spherical potential, Hartree first introduced atomic units to eliminate physical constants. Then he converted the Laplacian from Cartesian to spherical coordinates to show that the solution was a product of a radial function     P   (  r  )    /  r        P  r   r    P(r)/r   and a spherical harmonic with an angular quantum number   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   , namely    ψ  =    (   1  /  r   )   P   (  r  )    S  ℓ    (  θ  ,  ϕ  )        ψ      1  r   P  r   subscript  S  normal-ℓ    θ  ϕ      \psi=(1/r)P(r)S_{\ell}(\theta,\phi)   . The equation for the radial function was           d  2   P   (  r  )    /  d    r  2    +    [    2   (   E  -   v   (  r  )     )    -    ℓ   (   ℓ  +  1   )    /   r  2     ]   P   (  r  )     =  0.               superscript  d  2   P  r   d    superscript  r  2       delimited-[]      2    E    v  r         normal-ℓ    normal-ℓ  1     superscript  r  2      P  r    0.    d^{2}P(r)/dr^{2}+[2(E-v(r))-\ell(\ell+1)/r^{2}]P(r)=0.     In mathematics, the Hartree equation , named after Douglas Hartree , is         i     ∂  t   u    +    ∇  2   u    =   V   (  u  )   u           i    subscript   t   u      superscript  normal-∇  2   u      V  u  u     i\,\partial_{t}u+\nabla^{2}u=V(u)u     in    ℝ   d  +  1      superscript  ℝ    d  1     \mathbb{R}^{d+1}   where       V   (  u  )    =   ±     |  x  |    -  n    *    |  u  |   2           V  u    plus-or-minus     superscript    x     n     superscript    u   2       V(u)=\pm|x|^{-n}*|u|^{2}     and      0  <  n  <  d        0  n       d     0     The non-linear Schrödinger equation is in some sense a limiting case .
