4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate 
 
 
 
  4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and two products, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate carboxy-lyase (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde-forming). This enzyme is also called 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate carboxy-lyase.
