   Ineffable cardinal      Ineffable cardinal   In the mathematics of transfinite numbers , an ineffable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number, introduced by .  A cardinal number    κ   κ   \kappa   is called almost ineffable if for every    f  :   κ  →   𝒫   (  κ  )        normal-:  f   normal-→  κ    𝒫  κ      f:\kappa\to\mathcal{P}(\kappa)   (where    𝒫   (  κ  )       𝒫  κ    \mathcal{P}(\kappa)   is the powerset of   κ   κ   \kappa   ) with the property that    f   (  δ  )       f  δ    f(\delta)   is a subset of   δ   δ   \delta   for all ordinals    δ  <  κ      δ  κ    \delta<\kappa   , there is a subset   S   S   S   of   κ   κ   \kappa   having cardinal   κ   κ   \kappa   and homogeneous for   f   f   f   , in the sense that for any     δ  1   <   δ  2        subscript  δ  1    subscript  δ  2     \delta_{1}<\delta_{2}   in   S   S   S   ,     f   (   δ  1   )    =    f   (   δ  2   )    ∩   δ  1          f   subscript  δ  1        f   subscript  δ  2     subscript  δ  1      f(\delta_{1})=f(\delta_{2})\cap\delta_{1}   .  A cardinal number    κ   κ   \kappa   is called ineffable if for every binary-valued function    f  :     𝒫    =  2     (  κ  )    →   {  0  ,  1  }       normal-:  f   normal-→     subscript  𝒫    absent  2    κ    0  1      f:\mathcal{P}_{=2}(\kappa)\to\{0,1\}   , there is a stationary subset of   κ   κ   \kappa   on which   f   f   f   is homogeneous : that is, either   f   f   f   maps all unordered pairs of elements drawn from that subset to zero, or it maps all such unordered pairs to one.  More generally,   κ   κ   \kappa   is called    n   n   n   -ineffable (for a positive integer   n   n   n   ) if for every    f  :     𝒫    =  n     (  κ  )    →   {  0  ,  1  }       normal-:  f   normal-→     subscript  𝒫    absent  n    κ    0  1      f:\mathcal{P}_{=n}(\kappa)\to\{0,1\}   there is a stationary subset of   κ   κ   \kappa   on which   f   f   f   is    n   n   n   - homogeneous (takes the same value for all unordered   n   n   n   -tuples drawn from the subset). Thus, it is ineffable if and only if it is 2-ineffable.  A totally ineffable cardinal is a cardinal that is   n   n   n   -ineffable for every    2  ≤  n  <   ℵ  0         2  n        subscript  normal-ℵ  0      2\leq n<\aleph_{0}   . If   κ   κ   \kappa   is    (   n  +  1   )      n  1    (n+1)   -ineffable, then the set of   n   n   n   -ineffable cardinals below   κ   κ   \kappa   is a stationary subset of   κ   κ   \kappa   .  Totally ineffable cardinals are of greater consistency strength than subtle cardinals and of lesser consistency strength than remarkable cardinals .
