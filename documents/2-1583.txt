Ineffable cardinal

In the mathematics of transfinite numbers, an ineffable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number, introduced by .
A cardinal number

 
  is called almost ineffable if for every 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the powerset of 
 
 
 
 ) with the property that 
 
 
 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
  for all ordinals 
 
 
 
 , there is a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  having cardinal 
 
 
 
  and homogeneous for 
 
 
 
 , in the sense that for any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
A cardinal number

 
  is called ineffable if for every binary-valued function 
 
 
 
 , there is a stationary subset of 
 
 
 
  on which 
 
 
 
  is homogeneous: that is, either 
 
 
 
  maps all unordered pairs of elements drawn from that subset to zero, or it maps all such unordered pairs to one.
More generally, 
 
 
 
  is called 

 
 -ineffable (for a positive integer 
 
 
 
 ) if for every 
 
 
 
  there is a stationary subset of 
 
 
 
  on which 
 
 
 
  is 

 
 -homogeneous (takes the same value for all unordered 
 
 
 
 -tuples drawn from the subset). Thus, it is ineffable if and only if it is 2-ineffable.
A totally ineffable cardinal is a cardinal that is 
 
 
 
 -ineffable for every 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -ineffable, then the set of 
 
 
 
 -ineffable cardinals below 
 
 
 
  is a stationary subset of 
 
 
 
 .
Totally ineffable cardinals are of greater consistency strength than subtle cardinals and of lesser consistency strength than remarkable cardinals. A list of large cardinal axioms by consistency strength is available  here.
