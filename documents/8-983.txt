   Borel–Moore homology      Borel–Moore homology   In topology , Borel−Moore homology or homology with closed support is a homology theory for locally compact spaces , introduced by .  For reasonable compact spaces , Borel−Moore homology coincides with the usual singular homology . For non-compact spaces, each theory has its own advantages. In particular, a closed submanifold defines a class in Borel–Moore homology, but not in ordinary homology unless the submanifold is compact.  Note: The equivariant cohomology theory for spaces with an action of a group G is sometimes called Borel cohomology; it is defined as H * G ( X ) = H *(( EG × X )/ G ). That is not related to the subject of this article.  Definition  There are several ways to define Borel−Moore homology. They all coincide for reasonable spaces such as manifolds and CW complexes .  Definition via sheaf cohomology  For any locally compact space X , Borel-Moore homology with integral coefficients is defined as the cohomology of the dual of the chain complex which computes sheaf cohomology with compact support. 1 As a result, there is a short exact sequence analogous to the universal coefficient theorem :    0  →    Ext  𝐙  1    (    H  c   i  +  1     (  X  ,  𝐙  )    ,  𝐙  )    →    H  i   B  M     (  X  ,  𝐙  )    →   Hom   (    H  c  i    (  X  ,  𝐙  )    ,  𝐙  )    →  0.       normal-→  0     subscript   superscript  Ext  1   𝐙       subscript   superscript  H    i  1    c    X  𝐙    𝐙      normal-→       superscript   subscript  H  i     B  M     X  𝐙      normal-→      Hom      subscript   superscript  H  i   c    X  𝐙    𝐙      normal-→    0.     0\to\text{Ext}^{1}_{\mathbf{Z}}(H^{i+1}_{c}(X,\mathbf{Z}),\mathbf{Z})\to H_{i}%
 ^{BM}(X,\mathbf{Z})\to\text{Hom}(H^{i}_{c}(X,\mathbf{Z}),\mathbf{Z})\to 0.     In what follows, the coefficients Z are not written.  Definition via locally finite chains  The singular homology of a topological space X is defined as the homology of the chain complex of singular chains, that is, finite linear combinations of continuous maps from the simplex to X . The Borel−Moore homology of a reasonable locally compact space X , on the other hand, is isomorphic to the homology of the chain complex of locally finite singular chains. "Reasonable" means here that X is locally contractible, σ-compact , and of finite dimension. 2  In more detail, let C i BM ( X ) be the abelian group of formal (infinite) sums       u  =    ∑  σ     a  σ   σ     ,      u    subscript   σ      subscript  a  σ   σ      u=\sum_{\sigma}a_{\sigma}\sigma,   where σ runs over the set of all continuous maps from the standard i -simplex Δ i to X and each a σ is an integer, such that for each compact subset S of X , only finitely many maps σ whose image meets S have nonzero coefficient in u . Then the usual definition of the boundary ∂ of a singular chain makes these abelian groups into a chain complex:      ⋯  →    C  2   B  M     (  X  )    →    C  1   B  M     (  X  )    →    C  0   B  M     (  X  )    →  0.       normal-→  normal-⋯     superscript   subscript  C  2     B  M    X     normal-→       superscript   subscript  C  1     B  M    X     normal-→       superscript   subscript  C  0     B  M    X     normal-→    0.     \cdots\to C_{2}^{BM}(X)\to C_{1}^{BM}(X)\to C_{0}^{BM}(X)\to 0.   The Borel−Moore homology groups H i BM (X) are the homology groups of this chain complex. That is,       H  i   B  M     (  X  )   =  ker   (  ∂  :   C  i   B  M     (  X  )   →   C   i  -  1    B  M     (  X  )   )   /  im   (  ∂  :   C   i  +  1    B  M     (  X  )   →   C  i   B  M     (  X  )   )   .     fragments   subscript   superscript  H    B  M    i    fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)    kernel   fragments  normal-(   normal-:   superscript   subscript  C  i     B  M     fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)   normal-→   superscript   subscript  C    i  1      B  M     fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)   normal-)    im   fragments  normal-(   normal-:   superscript   subscript  C    i  1      B  M     fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)   normal-→   superscript   subscript  C  i     B  M     fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)   normal-)   normal-.    H^{BM}_{i}(X)=\ker\left(\partial:C_{i}^{BM}(X)\to C_{i-1}^{BM}(X)\right)/\text%
 {im}\left(\partial:C_{i+1}^{BM}(X)\to C_{i}^{BM}(X)\right).     If X is compact, then every locally finite chain is in fact finite. So, given that X is "reasonable" in the sense above, Borel−Moore homology H i BM (X) coincides with the usual singular homology H i (X) for X compact.  Definition via compactifications  Suppose that X is homeomorphic to the complement of a closed subcomplex S in a finite CW complex Y . Then Borel–Moore homology H i BM (X) is isomorphic to the relative homology  H i ( Y , S ). Under the same assumption on X , the one-point compactification of X is homeomorphic to a finite CW complex. As a result, Borel–Moore homology can be viewed as the relative homology of the one-point compactification with respect to the added point.  Definition via Poincaré duality  Let X be any locally compact space with a closed embedding into an oriented manifold  M of dimension m . Then         H  i   B  M     (  X  )    =    H   m  -  i     (  M  ,   M  ∖  X   )     ,         subscript   superscript  H    B  M    i   X      superscript  H    m  i     M    M  X       H^{BM}_{i}(X)=H^{m-i}(M,M\setminus X),     where in the right hand side, the usual relative cohomology is meant. 3  Definition via the dualizing complex  For any locally compact space X of finite dimension, let be the dualizing complex of   X   X   X   . Then         H  i   B  M     (  X  )    =    H   -  i     (  X  ,   D  X   )     ,         subscript   superscript  H    B  M    i   X      superscript  H    i     X   subscript  D  X       H^{BM}_{i}(X)=H^{-i}(X,D_{X}),     where in the right hand side, hypercohomology is meant. 4  Example  Let X = R 2 − 0, the plane minus the origin. The usual homology of X is Z in degrees 0 and 1 (and zero otherwise), while the Borel−Moore homology of X is Z in degrees 1 and 2 (and zero otherwise). In this example, the natural homomorphism H i ( X ) → H i BM ( X ) is zero for all integers i . For example, the usual homology H 1 ( X ) is generated by a circle around the origin, but this maps to zero in Borel–Moore homology, because a finite 1-chain representing the circle is the boundary of a locally finite 2-chain whose image is the region inside the circle. The Borel–Moore homology H 1 BM ( X ) is generated by a locally finite 1-chain whose image is (for example) the ray from 0 to ∞ in the real line R inside R 2 .  Properties   Borel−Moore homology is a covariant functor with respect to proper maps . That is, a proper map f : X → Y induces a pushforward homomorphism H i BM ( X ) → H i BM ( Y ) for all integers i . In contrast to ordinary homology, there is no pushforward on Borel−Moore homology for an arbitrary continuous map f . As a counterexample, one can consider the non-proper inclusion R 2 − 0 → R 2 .    Borel−Moore homology is a contravariant functor with respect to inclusions of open subsets. That is, for U open in X , there is a natural pullback or restriction homomorphism H i BM ( X ) → H i BM ( U ).    For any locally compact space X and any closed subset F , with U = X − F the complement, there is a long exact localization sequence: 5       ⋯  →    H  i   B  M     (  F  )    →    H  i   B  M     (  X  )    →    H  i   B  M     (  U  )    →    H   i  -  1    B  M     (  F  )    →  ⋯       normal-→  normal-⋯     subscript   superscript  H    B  M    i   F     normal-→       subscript   superscript  H    B  M    i   X     normal-→       subscript   superscript  H    B  M    i   U     normal-→       subscript   superscript  H    B  M      i  1    F     normal-→    normal-⋯     \cdots\to H^{BM}_{i}(F)\to H^{BM}_{i}(X)\to H^{BM}_{i}(U)\to H^{BM}_{i-1}(F)\to\cdots      Borel−Moore homology is homotopy invariant in the sense that for any space X , there is an isomorphism H i BM ( X ) → H i+1 BM ( X × R ). The shift in dimension means that Borel−Moore homology is not homotopy invariant in the naive sense. For example, the Borel−Moore homology of Euclidean space R n is isomorphic to Z in degree n and is otherwise zero.    Poincaré duality extends to non-compact manifolds using Borel–Moore homology. Namely, for an oriented n -manifold X , Poincaré duality is an isomorphism           H  i    (  X  )    →    H   n  -  i    B  M     (  X  )       normal-→     superscript  H  i   X      superscript   subscript  H    n  i      B  M    X     H^{i}(X)\to H_{n-i}^{BM}(X)        for all integers i . A different version of Poincaré duality for non-compact manifolds is the isomorphism from cohomology with compact support to usual homology:           H  c  i    (  X  )    →    H   n  -  i     (  X  )     .     normal-→     subscript   superscript  H  i   c   X      subscript  H    n  i    X     H^{i}_{c}(X)\to H_{n-i}(X).         A key advantage of Borel−Moore homology is that every oriented manifold  M of dimension n (in particular, every smooth complex algebraic variety ), not necessarily compact, has a fundamental class [ M ] ∈ H n BM ( M ). This is just the sum of all top dimensional simplices in a specific triangulation. In fact, in Borel−Moore homology, one can define a fundamental class for arbitrary (possibly singular) complex varieties. In this case the set of smooth points has complement of (real) codimension at least 2, and by the long exact sequence above the top dimensional homologies of   M   M   M   and are canonically isomorphic. The fundamental class of   M   M   M   is then defined to be the fundamental class of . 6   Notes  References        "  Category:Homology theory  Category:Sheaf theory     B. Iversen.
