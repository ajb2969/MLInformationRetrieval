   Dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NAD+)      Dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NAD+)   In enzymology , a dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NAD+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,6-dihydrouracil + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6-dihydrouracil and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are uracil , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6-dihydrouracil:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include dehydrogenase, dihydrouracil , dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , dihydrothymine dehydrogenase , pyrimidine reductase , thymine reductase , uracil reductase , and dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NAD+) . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : pyrimidine metabolism , beta-alanine metabolism , and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .
