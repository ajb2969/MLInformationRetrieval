   Adenosylmethionine—8-amino-7-oxononanoate transaminase      Adenosylmethionine—8-amino-7-oxononanoate transaminase   In enzymology , an adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 8-amino-7-oxononanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate + 7,8-diaminononanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate , whereas its two products are S-adenosyl-4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate and 7,8-diaminononanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include 7,8-diaminonanoate transaminase , 7,8-diaminononanoate transaminase , DAPA transaminase , 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase , DAPA aminotransferase , 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid , diaminopelargonate synthase , and 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and .
