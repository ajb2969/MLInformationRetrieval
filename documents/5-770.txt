   Hyperbolic motion (relativity)      Hyperbolic motion (relativity)   Hyperbolic motion is the motion of an object with constant proper acceleration in special relativity . It is called hyperbolic motion because the equation describing the path of the object through spacetime is a hyperbola , as can be seen when graphed on a Minkowski diagram .  The proper acceleration of a particle is defined as the acceleration that a particle "feels" as it accelerates from one inertial reference frame to another. This can be derived mathematically as      α  =    1    (   1  -    u  2   /   c  2     )    3  /  2       d  u    d  t         α      1   superscript    1     superscript  u  2    superscript  c  2       3  2         d  u     d  t       \alpha=\frac{1}{\left(1-u^{2}/c^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\frac{du}{dt}   ,  where   u   u   u   is the instantaneous speed of the particle. Solving for the equation of motion results in        x  2   -    c  2    t  2     =    c  4   /   α  2           superscript  x  2      superscript  c  2    superscript  t  2        superscript  c  4    superscript  α  2      x^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}=c^{4}/\alpha^{2}   ,  which is a hyperbola.  Hyperbolic motion is easily visualized on a Minkowski diagram, where the motion of the accelerating particle is along the   x   x   x   -axis. Each hyperbola is defined by      X  =    c  2   /  α       X     superscript  c  2   α     X=c^{2}/\alpha   .
