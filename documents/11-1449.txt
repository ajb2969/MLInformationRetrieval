   CDP-diacylglycerol—glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase      CDP-diacylglycerol—glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase   In enzymology , a CDP-diacylglycerol—glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-diacylglycerol + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + 3(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-diacylglycerol and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , whereas its two products are CMP and 3(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-diacylglycerol:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase . Other names in common use include glycerophosphate phosphatidyltransferase , 3-phosphatidyl-1'-glycerol-3'-phosphate synthase , CDPdiacylglycerol:glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase , cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol , (CDPdiglyceride):sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase , phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase , phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase , PGP synthase , CDPdiacylglycerol-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyltransferase , CDPdiacylglycerol:sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase , glycerol phosphate phosphatidyltransferase , glycerol 3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase , phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase , phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthetase , phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthetase , and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.7.8  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
