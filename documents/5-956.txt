   Todd class      Todd class   In mathematics , the Todd class is a certain construction now considered a part of the theory in algebraic topology of characteristic classes . The Todd class of a vector bundle can be defined by means of the theory of Chern classes , and is encountered where Chern classes exist — most notably in differential topology , the theory of complex manifolds and algebraic geometry . In rough terms, a Todd class acts like a reciprocal of a Chern class, or stands in relation to it as a conormal bundle does to a normal bundle .  The Todd class plays a fundamental role in generalising the classical Riemann-Roch theorem to higher dimensions, in the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem and Grothendieck-Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem .  History  It is named for J. A. Todd , who introduced a special case of the concept in algebraic geometry in 1937, before the Chern classes were defined. The geometric idea involved is sometimes called the Todd-Eger class . The general definition in higher dimensions is due to Hirzebruch .  Definition  To define the Todd class td ( E ) where E is a complex vector bundle on a topological space  X , it is usually possible to limit the definition to the case of a Whitney sum of line bundles , by means of a general device of characteristic class theory, the use of Chern roots (aka, the splitting principle ). For the definition, let         Q   (  x  )    =   x   1  -   e   -  x      =    ∑   i  =  0   ∞        (   -  1   )   i    B  i     i  !     x  i     =     1  +    x  2    +     x  2   12     -     x  4   720     +  ⋯           Q  x     x    1   superscript  e    x             superscript   subscript     i  0             superscript    1   i    subscript  B  i      i     superscript  x  i                1    x  2      superscript  x  2   12       superscript  x  4   720    normal-⋯      Q(x)=\frac{x}{1-e^{-x}}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{i}B_{i}}{i!}x^{i}=1+%
 \dfrac{x}{2}+\dfrac{x^{2}}{12}-\dfrac{x^{4}}{720}+\cdots        be the formal power series with the property that the coefficient of x n in Q ( x ) n +1 is 1 (where the B i are Bernoulli numbers ). Consider the coefficient of x j in the product       ∏   i  =  1   m    Q   (    β  i   x   )        superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m     Q     subscript  β  i   x      \prod_{i=1}^{m}Q(\beta_{i}x)     for any m > j . This is symmetric in the β i and homogeneous of weight j : so can be expressed as a polynomial td j ( p 1 ,... p j ) in the elementary symmetric functions  p of the β. Then td j defines the Todd polynomials : they form a multiplicative sequence with Q as characteristic power series.  If E has the α i as its Chern roots , then the Todd class       t  d   (  E  )    =   ∏   Q   (   α  i   )           t  d  E    product    Q   subscript  α  i       td(E)=\prod Q(\alpha_{i})     which is to be computed in the cohomology ring of X (or in its completion if one wants to consider infinite-dimensional manifolds).  The Todd class can be given explicitly as a formal power series in the Chern classes as follows:   td ( E ) = 1 + c 1 /2 + ( c 1 2 + c 2 )/12 + c 1 c 2 /24 + (− c 1 4 + 4 c 1 2 c 2 + c 1 c 3 + 3 c 2 2 − c 4 )/720 + ...   where the cohomology classes c i are the Chern classes of E , and lie in the cohomology group H 2 i ( X ). If X is finite-dimensional then most terms vanish and td ( E ) is a polynomial in the Chern classes.  Properties of Todd class  The Todd class is multiplicative:          T   d  *    (   E  ⊕  F   )    =     T   d  *    (  E  )    ⋅  T    d  *    (  F  )     .
