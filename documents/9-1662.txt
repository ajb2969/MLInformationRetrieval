   Fourier algebra      Fourier algebra   Fourier and related algebras occur naturally in the harmonic analysis of locally compact  groups . They play an important role in the duality theories of these groups. The Fourier–Stieltjes algebra and the Fourier–Stieltjes transform on the Fourier algebra of a locally compact group were introduced by Pierre Eymard in 1964.  Definition  Informal  Let G be a locally compact abelian group, and Ĝ the dual group of G. Then the Fourier transform of functions in     L  1    (   G  ^   )        subscript  L  1    normal-^  G     L_{1}(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   , the group algebra of    (   G  ^   )     normal-^  G    (\widehat{\mathit{G}})   , is a sub-algebra A(G) of CB(G), the space of bounded continuous complex-valued functions on G with pointwise multiplication called the Fourier algebra of G, and the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of measures in    M   (   G  ^   )       M   normal-^  G     M(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   , the measure algebra of    (   G  ^   )     normal-^  G    (\widehat{\mathit{G}})   , also a subalgebra of CB(G), called the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra of G.  Formal  Let    B   (  G  )       B  G    B(\mathit{G})   be a Fourier–Stieltjes algebra and    A   (  G  )       A  G    A(\mathit{G})   be a Fourier algebra such that the locally compact group   G   G   \mathit{G}   is abelian . Let    M   (   G  ^   )       M   normal-^  G     M(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   be the measure algebra of finite measures on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   and let     L  1    (   G  ^   )        subscript  L  1    normal-^  G     L_{1}(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   be the convolution algebra of integrable  functions on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   , where    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{\mathit{G}}   is the character group of the Abelian group   G   G   \mathit{G}   .  The Fourier–Stieltjes transform of a finite measure   μ   μ   \mu   on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{\mathit{G}}   is the function    μ  ^     normal-^  μ    \widehat{\mu}   on   G   G   \mathit{G}   defined by         μ  ^    (  x  )    =    ∫   G  ^        X   (  x  )    ¯    d  μ   (  X  )      ,   x  ∈  G      formulae-sequence       normal-^  μ   x     subscript    normal-^  G       normal-¯    X  x    d  μ  X       x  G     \widehat{\mu}(x)=\int_{\widehat{G}}\overline{X(x)}\,d\mu(X),\quad x\in G     The space    B   (  G  )       B  G    B(\mathit{G})   of these functions is an algebra under pointwise multiplication is isomorphic to the measure algebra    M   (   G  ^   )       M   normal-^  G     M(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   . Restricted to     L  1    (   G  ^   )        subscript  L  1    normal-^  G     L_{1}(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   , viewed as a subspace of    M   (   G  ^   )       M   normal-^  G     M(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   , the Fourier–Stieltjes transform is the Fourier transform on     L  1    (   G  ^   )        subscript  L  1    normal-^  G     L_{1}(\widehat{\mathit{G}})   and its image is, by definition, the Fourier algebra    A   (  G  )       A  G    A(\mathit{G})   . The generalized Bochner theorem states that a measurable function on   G   G   \mathit{G}   is equal, almost everywhere , to the Fourier–Stieltjes transform of a non-negative finite measure on    G  ^     normal-^  G    \widehat{G}   if and only if it is positive definite. Thus,    B   (  G  )       B  G    B(\mathit{G})   can be defined as the linear span of the set of continuous positive-definite functions on   G   G   \mathit{G}   . This definition is still valid when   G   G   \mathit{G}   is not Abelian.  Helson–Kahane–Katznelson–Rudin theorem  Let A(G) be the Fourier algebra of a compact group G. Building upon the work of Wiener , Lévy , Gelfand , and Beurling , in 1959 Helson , Kahane , Katznelson , and Rudin proved that, when G is compact and abelian, a function f defined on a closed convex subset of the plane operates in A(G) if and only if f is real analytic. 1 In 1969 Dunkl proved the result holds when G is compact and contains an infinite abelian subgroup.
