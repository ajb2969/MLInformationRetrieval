   Wijsman convergence      Wijsman convergence   Wijsman convergence is a variation of Hausdorff convergence suitable for work with unbounded sets . Intuitively, Wijsman convergence is to convergence in the Hausdorff metric as pointwise convergence is to uniform convergence .  History  The convergence was defined by Robert Wijsman . 1 The same definition was used earlier by Zdeněk Frolík . 2 Yet earlier, Hausdorff in in his book Grundzüge der Mengenlehre defined so called closed limits ; for proper metric spaces it is the same as Wijsman convergence.  Definition  Let ( X , d ) be a metric space and let Cl( X ) denote the collection of all d -closed subsets of X . For a point x ∈ X and a set A ∈ Cl( X ), set        d   (  x  ,  A  )    =    inf   a  ∈  A     d   (  x  ,  a  )      .        d   x  A      subscript  infimum    a  A      d   x  a       d(x,A)=\inf_{a\in A}d(x,a).     A sequence (or net) of sets A i ∈ Cl( X ) is said to be Wijsman convergent to A ∈ Cl( X ) if, for each x ∈ X ,        d   (  x  ,   A  i   )    →   d   (  x  ,  A  )     .     normal-→    d   x   subscript  A  i       d   x  A      d(x,A_{i})\to d(x,A).     Wijsman convergence induces a topology on Cl( X ), known as the Wijsman topology .  Properties   The Wijsman topology depends very strongly on the metric d . Even if two metrics are uniformly equivalent, they may generate different Wijsman topologies.    Beer's theorem : if ( X , d ) is a complete , separable metric space, then Cl( X ) with the Wijsman topology is a Polish space , i.e. it is separable and metrizable with a complete metric.    Cl( X ) with the Wijsman topology is always a Tychonoff space . Moreover, one has the Levi-Lechicki theorem : ( X , d ) is separable if and only if Cl( X ) is either metrizable, first-countable or second-countable .    If the pointwise convergence of Wijsman convergence is replaced by uniform convergence (uniformly in x ), then one obtains Hausdorff convergence, where the Hausdorff metric is given by            d  H    (  A  ,  B  )    =    sup   x  ∈  X     |    d   (  x  ,  A  )    -   d   (  x  ,  B  )     |     .         subscript  d  normal-H    A  B      subscript  supremum    x  X          d   x  A      d   x  B         d_{\mathrm{H}}(A,B)=\sup_{x\in X}\big|d(x,A)-d(x,B)\big|.         The Hausdorff and Wijsman topologies on Cl( X ) coincide if and only if ( X , d ) is a totally bounded space .   References          External links     "  Category:Metric geometry      ↩  Z.
