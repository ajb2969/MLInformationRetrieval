Rosati involution

In mathematics, a Rosati involution, named after Carlo Rosati, is an involution of the rational endomorphism ring of an abelian variety induced by a polarization.
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abelian variety, let 
 
 
 
  be the dual abelian variety, and for 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the translation-by-
 
 
 
  map, 
 
 
 
 . Then each divisor 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  defines a map 
 
 
 
  via 
 
 
 
 . The map 
 
 
 
  is a polarization, i.e., has finite kernel, if and only if 
 
 
 
  is ample. The Rosati involution of 
 
 
 
  relative to the polarization 
 
 
 
  sends a map 
 
 
 
  to the map 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the dual map induced by the action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the Néron–Severi group of 
 
 
 
 . The polarization 
 
 
 
  also induces an inclusion 
 
 
 
  via 
 
 
 
 . The image of 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 , i.e., the set of endomorphisms fixed by the Rosati involution. The operation 
 
 
 
  then gives 
 
 
 
  the structure of a formally real Jordan algebra.
