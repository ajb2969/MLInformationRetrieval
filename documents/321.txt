   Size functor      Size functor   Given a size pair     (  M  ,  f  )     M  f    (M,f)   where   M   M   M   is a manifold of dimension   n   n   n   and   f   f   f   is an arbitrary real continuous function defined on it, the   i   i   i   -th '' size functor'', 1 with    i  =   0  ,  …  ,  n       i   0  normal-…  n     i=0,\ldots,n   , denoted by    F  i     subscript  F  i    F_{i}   , is the functor in    F  u  n   (  Rord  ,  Ab  )       F  u  n   Rord  Ab     Fun(\mathrm{Rord},\mathrm{Ab})   , where   Rord   Rord   \mathrm{Rord}   is the category of ordered real numbers, and   Ab   Ab   \mathrm{Ab}   is the category of Abelian groups , defined in the following way. For    x  ≤  y      x  y    x\leq y   , setting     M  x   =   {   p  ∈  M   :    f   (  p  )    ≤  x   }        subscript  M  x    conditional-set    p  M       f  p   x      M_{x}=\{p\in M:f(p)\leq x\}   ,     M  y   =   {   p  ∈  M   :    f   (  p  )    ≤  y   }        subscript  M  y    conditional-set    p  M       f  p   y      M_{y}=\{p\in M:f(p)\leq y\}   ,    j   x  y      subscript  j    x  y     j_{xy}   equal to the inclusion from    M  x     subscript  M  x    M_{x}   into    M  y     subscript  M  y    M_{y}   , and    k   x  y      subscript  k    x  y     k_{xy}   equal to the morphism in   Rord   Rord   \mathrm{Rord}   from   x   x   x   to   y   y   y   ,   for each    x  ∈   \R       x  \R    x\in\R   ,       F  i    (  x  )    =    H  i    (   M  x   )     ;         subscript  F  i   x      subscript  H  i    subscript  M  x      F_{i}(x)=H_{i}(M_{x});            F  i    (   k   x  y    )    =    H  i    (   j   x  y    )     .         subscript  F  i    subscript  k    x  y        subscript  H  i    subscript  j    x  y       F_{i}(k_{xy})=H_{i}(j_{xy}).      In other words, the size functor studies the process of the birth and death of homology classes as the lower level set changes. When   M   M   M   is smooth and compact and   f   f   f   is a Morse function, the functor    F  0     subscript  F  0    F_{0}   can be described by oriented trees, called    H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   − trees.  The concept of size functor was introduced as an extension to homology theory and category theory of the idea of size function . The main motivation for introducing the size functor originated by the observation that the size function      ℓ   (  M  ,  f  )     (  x  ,  y  )        subscript  normal-ℓ   M  f     x  y     \ell_{(M,f)}(x,y)   can be seen as the rank of the image of      H  0    (   j   x  y    )    :     H  0    (   M  x   )    →    H  0    (   M  y   )        normal-:     subscript  H  0    subscript  j    x  y      normal-→     subscript  H  0    subscript  M  x       subscript  H  0    subscript  M  y       H_{0}(j_{xy}):H_{0}(M_{x})\rightarrow H_{0}(M_{y})   .  The concept of size functor is strictly related to the concept of persistent homology group , 2 studied in persistent homology . It is worth to point out that the   i   i   i   -th persistent homology group coincides with the image of the homomorphism        F  i    (   k   x  y    )    =    H  i    (   j   x  y    )     :     H  i    (   M  x   )    →    H  i    (   M  y   )        normal-:       subscript  F  i    subscript  k    x  y        subscript  H  i    subscript  j    x  y       normal-→     subscript  H  i    subscript  M  x       subscript  H  i    subscript  M  y       F_{i}(k_{xy})=H_{i}(j_{xy}):H_{i}(M_{x})\rightarrow H_{i}(M_{y})   .
