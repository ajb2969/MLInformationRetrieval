Scymnol sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a scymnol sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate + 5beta-scymnol 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + 5beta-scymnol sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate and 5beta-scymnol, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and 5beta-scymnol sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate:5beta-scymnol sulfotransferase.
