Crocetin glucosyltransferase

Crocetin glucosyltransferase (, crocetin GTase, UGTCs2) is an enzyme with system name UDP-glucose:crocetin 8-O-D-glucosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) UDP-glucose + crocetin 
 
 
 
  UDP + beta-D-glucosyl crocetin
 
(2) UDP-glucose + beta-D-glucosyl crocetin 
 
 
 
  UDP + bis(beta-D-glucosyl) crocetin
 
(3) UDP-glucose + beta-D-gentiobiosyl crocetin 
 
 
 
  UDP + beta-D-gentiobiosyl beta-D-glucosyl crocetin
 

In Crocus sativus this enzyme esterifies a free carboxyl group of crocetin or crocetin glycosyl ester.
