   Vitali–Carathéodory theorem      Vitali–Carathéodory theorem   In mathematics , the Vitali–Carathéodory theorem is a result in real analysis that shows that, under the conditions stated below, integrable functions can be approximated in L 1 from above and below by lower- and upper-semicontinuous functions, respectively. It is named after Giuseppe Vitali and Constantin Carathéodory .  Statement of the theorem  Let X be a locally compact  Hausdorff space equipped with a Borel measure , µ, that is finite on every compact set , outer regular , and tight when restricted to any Borel set that is open or of finite mass. If f is an element of L 1 (µ) then, for every ε > 0, there are functions u and v on X such that u ≤ f ≤ v , u is upper-semicontinuous and bounded above, v is lower-semicontinuous and bounded below, and         ∫  X     (   v  -  u   )   d  μ    <  ε   .        subscript   X       v  u   normal-d  μ    ε    \int_{X}(v-u)\,\mathrm{d}\mu<\varepsilon.
