Cyanuric acid amidohydrolase

In enzymology, a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cyanuric acid + H2O 
 
 
 
  biuret + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyanuric acid and H2O, whereas its two products are biuret and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyanuric acid amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in atrazine degradation.
