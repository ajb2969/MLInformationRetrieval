   Cyanuric acid amidohydrolase      Cyanuric acid amidohydrolase   In enzymology , a cyanuric acid amidohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cyanuric acid + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   biuret + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cyanuric acid and H 2 O , whereas its two products are biuret and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyanuric acid amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in atrazine degradation .
