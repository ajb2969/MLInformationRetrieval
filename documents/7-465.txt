   Source field      Source field   In theoretical physics , a source field is a field   J   J   J   whose multiple       S   s  o  u  r  c  e    =   J  Φ        subscript  S    s  o  u  r  c  e      J  normal-Φ     S_{source}=J\Phi   appears in the action, multiplied by the original field   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   . Consequently, the source field appears on the right-hand side of the equations of motion (usually second-order partial differential equations ) for   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   . When the field   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is the electromagnetic potential or the metric tensor , the source field is the electric current or the stress–energy tensor , respectively.  All Green's functions (correlators) may be formally found via Taylor expansion of the partition sum considered as a function of the source fields. This method is commonly used in the path integral formulation of quantum field theory . The general method by which such source fields can be utilized to obtain propagators in both quantum, statistical-mechanics and other systems is outlined in the article on the partition function .
