Regarding Work and Heat:  Note that work and heat above are listed as process quantities: They are not thermodynamic properties, but flows of energy across a system boundary. Systems do not contain work, but can perform work, and likewise, in formal thermodynamics, systems do not contain heat, but can transfer heat. Informally, however, a difference in the energy of a system that occurs solely because of a difference in its temperature is commonly called heat , and the energy that flows across a boundary as a result of a temperature difference is "heat".
