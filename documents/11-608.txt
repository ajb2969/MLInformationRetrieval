Beta-apiosyl-beta-glucosidase




Beta-apiosyl-beta-glucosidase

In enzymology, a beta-apiosyl-beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

7-[beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy]isoflavonoid + H2O 
 
 
 
  a 7-hydroxyisoflavonoid + beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1->6)-D-glucose
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 7-[beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-, [[glucopyranosyloxy]isoflavonoid]], and H2O, whereas its two products are 7-hydroxyisoflavonoid and beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1->6)-D-glucose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7-[beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy]isoflavonoid beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1->6)-D-glucohydrolase. Other names in common use include isoflavonoid-7-O-beta[D-apiosyl-(1->6)-beta-D-glucoside], disaccharidase, isoflavonoid 7-O-beta-apiosyl-glucoside beta-glucosidase, and furcatin hydrolase.
