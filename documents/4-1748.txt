Triangular cupola

In geometry, the triangular cupola is one of the Johnson solids (J3). It can be seen as half a cuboctahedron.
Formulae
The following formulae for the volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1



Dual polyhedron
The dual of the triangular cupola has 6 triangular and 3 kite faces:

The triangular cupola can be augmented by 3 square pyramids, leaving adjacent coplanar faces. This isn't a Johnson solid because of its coplanar faces. Merging those coplanar triangles into larger ones, topologically this is another triangular cupola with isosceles trapezoidal side faces. If all the triangle are retained and the base hexagon is replaced by 6 triangles, it generates a coplanar deltahedron with 22 faces.




The Triangular cupola fill the space with either or combination of(Square pyramid(Johnson solid No.1), Octahedron).2
The family of cupolae with regular polygons exists up to 5-sides, and higher for isosceles triangle version.
