   Triangular cupola      Triangular cupola   In geometry , the triangular cupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 3 ). It can be seen as half a cuboctahedron .  Formulae  The following formulae for the volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (   5   3   2     )    a  3    ≈   1.17851...   a  3          V      5    3    2      superscript  a  3           1.17851...   superscript  a  3       V=(\frac{5}{3\sqrt{2}})a^{3}\approx 1.17851...a^{3}       A  =    (   3  +    5   3    2    )    a  2    ≈   7.33013...   a  2          A      3      5    3    2     superscript  a  2           7.33013...   superscript  a  2       A=(3+\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2})a^{2}\approx 7.33013...a^{2}     Dual polyhedron  The dual of the triangular cupola has 6 triangular and 3 kite faces:      Dual triangular cupola   Net of dual      (Figure)  Dual triangular cupola.png   (Figure)  Dual triangular cupola net.png      Related polyhedra and honeycombs  The triangular cupola can be augmented by 3 square pyramids , leaving adjacent coplanar faces. This isn't a Johnson solid because of its coplanar faces. Merging those coplanar triangles into larger ones, topologically this is another triangular cupola with isosceles trapezoidal side faces. If all the triangle are retained and the base hexagon is replaced by 6 triangles, it generates a coplanar deltahedron with 22 faces.      The Triangular cupola fill the space with either or combination of( Square pyramid (Johnson solid No.1), Octahedron ). 2  The family of cupolae with regular polygons exists up to 5-sides, and higher for isosceles triangle version.
