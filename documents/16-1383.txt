   Link-centric preferential attachment      Link-centric preferential attachment   In mathematical modeling of social networks, link-centric preferential attachment 1 2 describes a node's propensity to re-establish links to nodes it has previously been in contact with in time-varying networks . 3 This preferential attachment model relies on nodes keeping memory of previous neighbors up to the current time. 4 5  Background  In real social networks individuals exhibit a tendency to re-connect with past contacts (ex. family, friends, co-workers, etc.) rather than strangers. In 1970, Mark Granovetter examined this behaviour in the social networks of a group of workers and identified tie strength, a characteristic of social ties describing the frequency of contact between two individuals. From this comes the idea of strong and weak ties, 6 where an individual's strong ties are those she has come into frequent contact with. Link-centric preferential attachment aims to explain the mechanism behind strong and weak ties as a stochastic reinforcement process for old ties in agent-based modeling where nodes have long-term memory.  Examples  In a simple model for this mechanism, a node's propensity to establish a new link can be characterized solely by   n   n   n   , the number of contacts it has had in the past. The probability for a node with n social ties to establish a new social tie could then be simply given by 7       P   (  n  )    =    c   n  +  c           P  n     c    n  c      P(n)={c\over n+c}\,     where c is an offset constant. The probability for a node to re-connect with old ties is then        1  -   P   (  n  )     =   n   n  +  c     .        1    P  n      n    n  c      1-P(n)={n\over n+c}.   Figure 1. shows an example of this process: in the first step nodes A and C connect to node B, giving B a total of two social ties. With c = 1, in the next step B has a probability P (2) = 1/(2 + 1) = 1/3 to create a new tie with D, whereas the probability to reconnect with A or C is twice that at 2/3.  More complex models may take into account other variables, such as frequency of contact, contact and intercontact duration, as well as short term memory effects. 8  Effects on the spreading of contagions / weakness of strong ties  Understanding the evolution of a network's structure and how it can influence dynamical processes has become an important part of modeling the spreading of contagions. 9 10 In models of social and biological contagion spreading on time-varying networks link-centric preferential attachment can alter the spread of the contagion to the entire population. Compared to the classic rumour spreading process where nodes are memory-less, link-centric preferential attachment can cause not only a slower spread of the contagion but also one less diffuse. In these models an infected node's chances of connecting to new contacts diminishes as their size of their social circle   n   n   n   grows leading to a limiting effect on the growth of n. The result is strong ties with a node's early contacts and consequently the weakening of the diffusion of the contagion. 11 12  See also   BA model  Network science  Interpersonal tie   References  "  Category:Network theory  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩
