   Alexiewicz norm      Alexiewicz norm   In mathematics — specifically, in integration theory — the Alexiewicz norm is an integral norm associated to the Henstock–Kurzweil integral . The Alexiewicz norm turns the space of Henstock–Kurzweil integrable functions into a topological vector space that is barrelled but not complete . The Alexiewicz norm is named after the Polish mathematician Andrzej Alexiewicz , who introduced it in 1948.  Definition  Let HK( R ) denote the space of all functions f : R → R that have finite Henstock–Kurzweil integral. Define the Alexiewicz semi-norm of f ∈ HK( R ) by        ∥  f  ∥   :=   sup   {   |    ∫  I   f   |   :   I  ⊆   ℝ  is an interval    }     .     assign   norm  f    supremum   conditional-set      subscript   I   f      I    ℝ  is an interval        \|f\|:=\sup\left\{\left|\int_{I}f\right|:I\subseteq\mathbb{R}\text{ is an %
 interval}\right\}.   This defines a semi-norm on HK( R ); if functions that are equal Lebesgue - almost everywhere are identified, then this procedure defines a bona fide norm on the quotient of HK( R ) by the equivalence relation of equality almost everywhere. (Note that the only constant function f : R → R that is integrable is the one with constant value zero.)  Properties   The Alexiewicz norm endows HK( R ) with a topology that is barrelled but incomplete.  The Alexiewicz norm as defined above is equivalent to the norm defined by            ∥  f  ∥   ′   :=    sup   x  ∈  ℝ     |    ∫   -  ∞   x   f   |     .     assign   superscript   norm  f   normal-′     subscript  supremum    x  ℝ        superscript   subscript        x   f       \|f\|^{\prime}:=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\left|\int_{-\infty}^{x}f\right|.         The completion of HK( R ) with respect to the Alexiewicz norm is often denoted A( R ) and is a subspace of the space of tempered distributions , the dual of Schwartz space . More precisely, A( R ) consists of those tempered distributions that are distributional derivatives of functions in the collection          {  F  :  ℝ  →   ℝ   |  F  is continuous,   lim   x  →   -  ∞     F   (  x  )   =  0  ,   lim   x  →   +  ∞     F   (  x  )   ∈  ℝ  }   .     fragments   fragments  normal-{  F  normal-:  R  normal-→  R  normal-|  F  is continuous,   subscript    normal-→  x        F   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    0  normal-,   subscript    normal-→  x        F   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    R  normal-}   normal-.    \left\{F\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\,\left|\,F\text{ is continuous, }\lim_{x%
 \to-\infty}F(x)=0,\lim_{x\to+\infty}F(x)\in\mathbb{R}\right.\right\}.       Therefore, if f ∈ A( R ), then f is a tempered distribution and there exists a continuous function F in the above collection such that      ⟨   F  ′   ,  φ  ⟩   =   -   ⟨  F  ,   φ  ′   ⟩    =   -    ∫   -  ∞    +  ∞     F   φ  ′      =   ⟨  f  ,  φ  ⟩           superscript  F  normal-′   φ      F   superscript  φ  normal-′              superscript   subscript               F   superscript  φ  normal-′            f  φ      \langle F^{\prime},\varphi\rangle=-\langle F,\varphi^{\prime}\rangle=-\int_{-%
 \infty}^{+\infty}F\varphi^{\prime}=\langle f,\varphi\rangle      for every compactly supported  C ∞  test function  φ : R → R . In this case, it holds that        ∥  f  ∥   ′   =    sup   x  ∈  ℝ     |   F   (  x  )    |    =    ∥  F  ∥   ∞    .         superscript   norm  f   normal-′     subscript  supremum    x  ℝ        F  x           subscript   norm  F        \|f\|^{\prime}=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}|F(x)|=\|F\|_{\infty}.        The translation operator is continuous with respect to the Alexiewicz norm. That is, if for f ∈ HK( R ) and x ∈ R the translation T x f of f by x is defined by            (    T  x   f   )    (  y  )    :=   f   (   y  -  x   )     ,     assign       subscript  T  x   f   y     f    y  x      (T_{x}f)(y):=f(y-x),       then      ∥     T  x   f   -  f   ∥   →   0  as  x   →  0.       normal-→   norm       subscript  T  x   f   f      0  as  x     normal-→    0.     \|T_{x}f-f\|\to 0\text{ as }x\to 0.
