   Matter collineation      Matter collineation   A matter collineation (sometimes matter symmetry and abbreviated to MC ) is a vector field that satisfies the condition,        ℒ  X    T   a  b     =  0         subscript  ℒ  X    subscript  T    a  b     0    \mathcal{L}_{X}T_{ab}=0     where    T   a  b      subscript  T    a  b     T_{ab}   are the energy-momentum tensor components. The intimate relation between geometry and physics may be highlighted here, as the vector field   X   X   X   is regarded as preserving certain physical quantities along the flow lines of   X   X   X   , this being true for any two observers. In connection with this, it may be shown that every Killing vector field is a matter collineation (by the Einstein field equations (EFE), with or without cosmological constant ). Thus, given a solution of the EFE, a vector field that preserves the metric necessarily preserves the corresponding energy-momentum tensor . When the energy-momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid, every Killing vector field preserves the energy density, pressure and the fluid flow vector field. When the energy-momentum tensor represents an electromagnetic field , a Killing vector field does not necessarily preserve the electric and magnetic fields.
