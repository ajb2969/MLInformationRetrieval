   Aryldialkylphosphatase      Aryldialkylphosphatase   Aryldialkylphosphatase () (also known as organophosphorus hydrolase , phosphotriesterase , and paraoxon hydrolase ) is an enzyme that hydrolyse  organophosphates :   an aryl dialkyl phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dialkyl phosphate + an aryl alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are aryldialkylphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dialkylphosphate and aryl alcohol .  Organophosphate is the general name for esters of phosphoric acid and is one of the organophosphorus compounds . They can be found as part of insecticides , herbicides , and nerve gases , amongst others. Some less-toxic organophosphates can be used as solvents , plasticizers , and EP additives .  Function  Bacteria such as Pseudomonas diminuta harbor a plasmid that carries the gene for aryldialkylphosphatase (). This enzyme has attracted interest because of its potential use in the detoxification of chemical waste and warfare agents and its ability to degrade agricultural pesticides such as parathion . It acts specifically on synthetic organophosphate triesters and phosphorofluoridates . It does not seem to have a natural occurring substrate and may thus have optimally evolved for utilizing paraoxon .  Structure  Aryldialkylphosphatase belongs to a family 1 2 of enzymes that possess a binuclear zinc metal centre at their active site. The two zinc ions are coordinated by six different residues, six of which being histidines.  References  Further reading        "  Category:EC 3.1.8  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩  ↩
