   Chlorophyll synthase      Chlorophyll synthase   In enzymology , a chlorophyll synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   chlorophyllide a + phytyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   chlorophyll a + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chlorophyllide a and phytyl diphosphate , whereas its two products are chlorophyll a and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorophyllide-a:phytyl-diphosphate phytyltransferase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .
