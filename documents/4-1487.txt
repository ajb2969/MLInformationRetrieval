   Projection-valued measure      Projection-valued measure   In mathematics , particularly in functional analysis , a projection-valued measure (PVM) is a function defined on certain subsets of a fixed set and whose values are self-adjoint  projections on a fixed Hilbert space . Projection-valued measures are formally similar to real-valued measures , except that their values are self-adjoint projections rather than real numbers. As in the case of ordinary measures, it is possible to integrate complex-valued functions with respect to a PVM; the result of such an integration is a linear operator on the given Hilbert space.  Projection-valued measures are used to express results in spectral theory , such as the important spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators . The Borel functional calculus for self-adjoint operators is constructed using integrals with respect to PVMs. In quantum mechanics , PVMs are the mathematical description of projective measurements . They are generalized by positive operator valued measures (POVMs) in the same sense that a mixed state or density matrix generalizes the notion of a pure state .  Formal definition  A projection-valued measure on a measurable space ( X , M ), where M is a σ-algebra of subsets of X , is a mapping π from M to the set of self-adjoint  projections on a Hilbert space  H such that        π   (  X  )    =   id  H          π  X    subscript  id  H     \pi(X)=\operatorname{id}_{H}\quad     and for every ξ, η ∈ H , the set-function      E  ↦   ⟨   π   (  E  )   ξ   ∣  η  ⟩      maps-to  E   inner-product    π  E  ξ   η     E\mapsto\langle\pi(E)\xi\mid\eta\rangle     is a complex measure on M (that is, a complex-valued countably additive function). We denote this measure by     S  π    (  ξ  ,  η  )       subscript  normal-S  π   ξ  η    \operatorname{S}_{\pi}(\xi,\eta)   . Note that     S  π    (  ξ  ,  ξ  )       subscript  normal-S  π   ξ  ξ    \operatorname{S}_{\pi}(\xi,\xi)   is a real-valued measure, and a probability measure when   ξ   ξ   \xi   has length one.  If π is a projection-valued measure and        E  ∩  F   =  ∅   ,        E  F      E\cap F=\emptyset,     then π( E ), π( F ) are orthogonal projections . From this follows that in general,        π   (  E  )   π   (  F  )    =   π   (   E  ∩  F   )    =   π   (  F  )   π   (  E  )     ,          π  E  π  F     π    E  F           π  F  π  E      \pi(E)\pi(F)=\pi(E\cap F)=\pi(F)\pi(E),     and they commute.  Example . Suppose ( X , M , μ) is a measure space. Let π( E ) be the operator of multiplication by the indicator function 1 E on L 2 ( X ) . Then π is a projection-valued measure.  Extensions of projection-valued measures, integrals and the spectral theorem  If π is a projection-valued measure on ( X , M ), then the map       𝟏  E   ↦   π   (  E  )       maps-to   subscript  1  E     π  E     \mathbf{1}_{E}\mapsto\pi(E)     extends to a linear map on the vector space of step functions on X . In fact, it is easy to check that this map is a ring homomorphism . This map extends in a canonical way to all bounded complex-valued measurable functions on X , and we have the following.  Theorem . For any bounded M -measurable function f on X , there is a unique bounded linear operator T π ( f ) such that       ⟨     T  π    (  f  )    ξ   ∣  η  ⟩   =    ∫  X    f   (  x  )   d    S  π    (  ξ  ,  η  )     (  x  )          inner-product     subscript  normal-T  π   f   ξ   η     subscript   X     f  x  d    subscript  normal-S  π   ξ  η   x      \langle\operatorname{T}_{\pi}(f)\xi\mid\eta\rangle=\int_{X}f(x)d\operatorname{%
 S}_{\pi}(\xi,\eta)(x)     for all ξ, η ∈ H . Here,     S  π    (  ξ  ,  η  )       subscript  normal-S  π   ξ  η    \operatorname{S}_{\pi}(\xi,\eta)   denotes the complex measure    E  ↦   ⟨   π   (  E  )   ξ   ∣  η  ⟩      maps-to  E   inner-product    π  E  ξ   η     E\mapsto\langle\pi(E)\xi\mid\eta\rangle   from the definition of   π   π   \pi   . The map      f  ↦    T  π    (  f  )       maps-to  f    subscript  normal-T  π   f     f\mapsto\operatorname{T}_{\pi}(f)     is a homomorphism of rings . An integral notation is often used for     T  π    (  f  )       subscript  normal-T  π   f    \operatorname{T}_{\pi}(f)   , as in         T  π    (  f  )    =    ∫  X    f   (  x  )   d  π   (  x  )     =    ∫  X    f  d  π     .          subscript  normal-T  π   f     subscript   X     f  x  d  π  x           subscript   X     f  d  π       \operatorname{T}_{\pi}(f)=\int_{X}f(x)d\pi(x)=\int_{X}fd\pi.     The theorem is also correct for unbounded measurable functions f , but then     T  π    (  f  )       subscript  normal-T  π   f    \operatorname{T}_{\pi}(f)   will be an unbounded linear operator on the Hilbert space H .  The spectral theorem says that every self-adjoint operator     A  :   H  →  H      normal-:  A   normal-→  H  H     A:H\to H   has an associated projection-valued measure    π  A     subscript  π  A    \pi_{A}   defined on the real axis, such that       A  =    ∫  ℝ    x  d   π  A    (  x  )      .      A    subscript   ℝ     x  d   subscript  π  A   x      A=\int_{\mathbb{R}}xd\pi_{A}(x).   This allows to define the Borel functional calculus for such operators: if    g  :   ℝ  →  ℂ      normal-:  g   normal-→  ℝ  ℂ     g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}   is a measurable function, we set        g   (  A  )    :=    ∫  ℝ    g   (  x  )   d   π  A    (  x  )      .     assign    g  A     subscript   ℝ     g  x  d   subscript  π  A   x      g(A):=\int_{\mathbb{R}}g(x)d\pi_{A}(x).     Structure of projection-valued measures  First we provide a general example of projection-valued measure based on direct integrals . Suppose ( X , M , μ) is a measure space and let { H x } x ∈ X be a μ-measurable family of separable Hilbert spaces. For every E ∈ M , let π( E ) be the operator of multiplication by 1 E on the Hilbert space        ∫  X  ⊕      H  x    d  μ   (  x  )     .      superscript   subscript   X   direct-sum      subscript  H  x   d  μ  x     \int_{X}^{\oplus}H_{x}\ d\mu(x).     Then π is a projection-valued measure on ( X , M ).  Suppose π, ρ are projection-valued measures on ( X , M ) with values in the projections of H , K . π, ρ are unitarily equivalent  if and only if there is a unitary operator U : H → K such that        π   (  E  )    =    U  *   ρ   (  E  )   U          π  E      superscript  U    ρ  E  U     \pi(E)=U^{*}\rho(E)U\quad     for every E ∈ M .  Theorem . If ( X , M ) is a standard Borel space , then for every projection-valued measure π on ( X , M ) taking values in the projections of a separable Hilbert space, there is a Borel measure μ and a μ-measurable family of Hilbert spaces { H x } x ∈ X , such that π is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by 1 E on the Hilbert space        ∫  X  ⊕      H  x    d  μ   (  x  )     .      superscript   subscript   X   direct-sum      subscript  H  x   d  μ  x     \int_{X}^{\oplus}H_{x}\ d\mu(x).     The measure class of μ and the measure equivalence class of the multiplicity function x → dim H x completely characterize the projection-valued measure up to unitary equivalence.  A projection-valued measure π is homogeneous of multiplicity  n if and only if the multiplicity function has constant value n . Clearly,  Theorem . Any projection-valued measure π taking values in the projections of a separable Hilbert space is an orthogonal direct sum of homogeneous projection-valued measures:      π  =   ⊕   1  ≤  n  ≤  ω     (  π  |   H  n   )      fragments  π    subscript  direct-sum      1  n       ω      fragments  normal-(  π  normal-|   subscript  H  n   normal-)     \pi=\bigoplus_{1\leq n\leq\omega}(\pi|H_{n})     where       H  n   =   ∫   X  n   ⊕     H  x    d   (  μ  |   X  n   )    (  x  )      fragments   subscript  H  n     superscript   subscript    subscript  X  n    direct-sum    subscript  H  x   d   fragments  normal-(  μ  normal-|   subscript  X  n   normal-)    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     H_{n}=\int_{X_{n}}^{\oplus}H_{x}\ d(\mu|X_{n})(x)     and        X  n   =   {   x  ∈  X   :    dim   H  x    =  n   }    .       subscript  X  n    conditional-set    x  X      dim   subscript  H  x    n      X_{n}=\{x\in X:\operatorname{dim}H_{x}=n\}.     Application in quantum mechanics  In quantum mechanics, the unit sphere of the Hilbert space H is interpreted as the set of possible states Φ of a quantum system, the measurable space X is the value space for some quantum property of the system (an "observable"), and the projection-valued measure π expresses the probability that the observable takes on various values.  A common choice for X is the real numbers, but it may also be R 3 (for position or momentum), a discrete set (for angular momentum, energy of a bound state, etc), or the 2-point set "true" and "false" for the truth-value of an arbitrary proposition about Φ.  Let E be a measurable subset of X and Φ a state in H , so that |Φ|=1. The probability that the observable takes its value in E given the system in state Φ is       P  =   ⟨  ϕ  ,   π   (  E  )    (  ϕ  )    ⟩   =   ⟨  ϕ  |   π   (  E  )    |  ϕ  ⟩    ,        P   ϕ    π  E  ϕ          quantum-operator-product  ϕ    π  E   ϕ      P=\langle\phi,\pi(E)(\phi)\rangle=\langle\phi|\pi(E)|\phi\rangle,     where the latter notation is preferred in physics. We can parse this in two ways. First, for each fixed E , the projection π( E ) is a self-adjoint operator on H whose 1-eigenspace is the states Φ for which the value of the observable always lies in E , and whose 0-eigenspace is the states Φ for which the value of the observable never lies in E . Second, for each fixed Φ, the association E ↦ ⟨Φ,π(⋅)Φ⟩ is a probability measure on X making the values of the observable into a random variable.  A measurement that can be performed by a projection-valued measure π is called a projective measurement . If X is the real numbers, there is associated to π a Hermitian operator A defined on H by        A   (  ϕ  )    =    ∫  ℝ     λ   d  π   (  λ  )    (  ϕ  )      ,        A  ϕ     subscript   ℝ     λ  d  π  λ  ϕ      A(\phi)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\lambda\,d\pi(\lambda)(\phi),     which takes the more readable form       A   (  ϕ  )    =    ∑  i     λ  i   π   (   λ  i   )    (  ϕ  )           A  ϕ     subscript   i      subscript  λ  i   π   subscript  λ  i   ϕ      A(\phi)=\sum_{i}\lambda_{i}\pi({\lambda_{i}})(\phi)     if the support of π is a discrete subset of R . This operator is called an observable in quantum mechanics.  Generalizations  The idea of a projection-valued measure is generalized by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM), where the need for the orthogonality implied by projection operators is replaced by the idea of a set of operators that are a non-orthogonal partition of unity. This generalization is motivated by applications to quantum information theory .  References   G. W. Mackey, The Theory of Unitary Group Representations , The University of Chicago Press, 1976  M.
