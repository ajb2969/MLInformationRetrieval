   Process function      Process function   In thermodynamics, a quantity that is well defined so as to describe the path of a process through the equilibrium state space of a thermodynamic system is termed a process function , 1 or, alternatively, a process quantity , or a path function . As an example, mechanical work and heat are process functions because they describe quantitatively the transition between equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system.  Path functions depend on the path taken to reach one state from another. Different routes give different quantities. Examples of path functions include work , heat and arc length . In contrast to path functions, state functions are independent of the path taken.  Infinitesimal changes in a process function X are often indicated by    δ  X      δ  X    \delta X   to distinguish them from infinitesimal changes in a state function Y which is written    d  Y      d  Y    dY   . The quantity    d  Y      d  Y    dY   is an exact differential , while    δ  X      δ  X    \delta X   is not, it is an inexact differential . Infinitesimal changes in a process function may be integrated, but the integral between two states depends on the particular path taken between the two states, whereas the integral of a state function is simply the difference of the state functions at the two points, independent of the path taken.  In general, a process function X may be either holonomic or non-holonomic. For a holonomic process function, an auxiliary state function (or integrating factor)   λ   λ   \lambda   may be defined such that    Y  =   λ  X       Y    λ  X     Y=\lambda X   is a state function. For a non-holonomic process function, no such function may be defined. In other words, for a holonomic process function,   λ   λ   \lambda   may be defined such that     d  Y   =   λ  δ  X         d  Y     λ  δ  X     dY=\lambda\delta X   is an exact differential. For example, thermodynamic work is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor    λ  =   1  /  p       λ    1  p     \lambda=1/p   (where p is pressure) will yield exact differential of the volume state function     d  V   =    δ  W   /  p         d  V       δ  W   p     dV=\delta W/p   . The second law of thermodynamics as stated by Carathéodory essentially amounts to the statement that heat is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor    λ  =   1  /  T       λ    1  T     \lambda=1/T   (where T is temperature) will yield the exact differential of an entropy state function     d  S   =    δ  Q   /  T         d  S       δ  Q   T     dS=\delta Q/T   . 2  References    See also   Thermodynamics   "  Category:Thermodynamics     ↩
