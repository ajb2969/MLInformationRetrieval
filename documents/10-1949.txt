   Benzoin aldolase      Benzoin aldolase   In enzymology , a benzoin aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 benzaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone , and one product , benzaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone benzaldehyde-lyase (benzaldehyde-forming) . Other names in common use include benzaldehyde lyase , and 2-hydroxy-1,2-diphenylethanone benzaldehyde-lyase . It employs one cofactor , thiamin diphosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
