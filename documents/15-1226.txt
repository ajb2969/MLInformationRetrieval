Template:Ket/doc

This is for producing quantum state vectors in bra–ket notation, using wikicode, ideally with , as an alternative to LaTeX in  mode.
This template uses .
Application
There is one parameter, which is the text to be displayed as the ket label.
Examples
A ket can be written: $| Ψ \rangle$, that is $| Ψ \rangle$.
Using , a ket can be written: $| Ψ \rangle$, that is $| Ψ \rangle$.

Schrödinger equation:

In wiki-markup rather than LaTeX:

$ iħ \frac{d}{dt} | ψ ( t ) \rangle = Ĥ | ψ ( t ) \rangle$


that is,

$ iħ \frac{d}{dt} | ψ ( t ) \rangle = Ĥ | ψ ( t ) \rangle$
