Poly-Bernoulli number

In mathematics, poly-Bernoulli numbers, denoted as 
 
 
 
 , were defined by M. Kaneko as



where Li is the polylogarithm. The 
 
 
 
  are the usual Bernoulli numbers.
Moreover, the Generalization of Poly-Bernoulli numbers with a,b,c parameters defined by Hassan Jolany as follows



where Li is the polylogarithm.
Kaneko also gave two combinatorial formulas:






where 
 
 
 
  is the number of ways to partition a size 
 
 
 
  set into 
 
 
 
  non-empty subsets (the Stirling number of the second kind).
A combinatorial interpretation is that the poly-Bernoulli numbers of negative index enumerate the set of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
(0,1)-matrices uniquely reconstructible from their row and column sums.
For a positive integer n and a prime number p, the poly-Bernoulli numbers satisfy



which can be seen as an analog of Fermat's little theorem. Further, the equation



has no solution for integers x, y, z, n > 2; an analog of Fermat's last theorem. Moreover, there is an analogue of Poly-Bernoulli numbers (like Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers) which is known as Poly-Euler numbers
