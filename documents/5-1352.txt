Atom economy

Atom economy (atom efficiency) is the conversion efficiency of a chemical process in terms of all atoms involved (desired products produced). In an ideal chemical process, the amount of starting materials or reactants equals the amount of all products generated (see stoichiometry) and no atom is wasted. Recent developments like high raw material (such as petrochemicals) costs and increased sensitivity to environmental concerns have made atom economical approaches more popular. Atom economy is an important concept of green chemistry philosophy,123 and one of the most widely used ways to measure the "greenness" of a process or synthesis.
Atom economy can be written as: 
 
 
 
  noting that the total molecular mass of the reactants is the same as the total molecular mass of the products.
Note that atom economy can be poor even when chemical yield is near 100%, see for instance the Cannizzaro reaction or the Wittig reaction. If the desired product has an enantiomer the reaction needs to be sufficiently stereoselective even when atom economy is 100%. A Diels-Alder reaction is an example of a potentially very atom efficient reaction that also can be chemo-, regio-, diastereo- and enantioselective. Catalytic hydrogenation comes the closest to being an ideal reaction that is extensively practiced both industrially and academically.4 The Gabriel synthesis of amines is an example of extremely low atom economy, as stoichiometric quantities of phthalic acid derivatives are formed. In most cases, the atom economy of the Gabriel synthesis is
