Multiplexed binary offset carrier

Multiplexed binary offset carrier (MBOC) modulation 123 is a modulation proposed for Galileo4 and modernized GPS signals, which combines a sine binary offset carrier SinBOC(1,1) signal with a SinBOC(6,1) signal, either via weighted sum/difference (the CBOC implementation) or via time-multiplexing (the TMBOC implementation).
The main objective of the common GPS and Galileo signal design activity was that the power spectral density (PSD) of the proposed solution would be identical for GPS L1C and Galileo E1 OS when the pilot and data components are computed together.5 This assures high interoperability between both signals. Its power spectral density
