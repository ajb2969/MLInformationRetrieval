   Multiplexed binary offset carrier      Multiplexed binary offset carrier   Multiplexed binary offset carrier ( MBOC ) modulation 1 2 3 is a modulation proposed for Galileo 4 and modernized GPS signals, which combines a sine binary offset carrier SinBOC(1,1) signal with a SinBOC(6,1) signal, either via weighted sum/difference (the CBOC implementation) or via time-multiplexing (the TMBOC implementation).  The main objective of the common GPS and Galileo signal design activity was that the power spectral density (PSD) of the proposed solution would be identical for GPS L1C and Galileo E1 OS when the pilot and data components are computed together. 5 This assures high interoperability between both signals. Its power spectral density     Φ   (  f  )       normal-Φ  f    \Phi(f)   is defined by 6      Φ   (  f  )    =     10  11   B  O  C   (  1  ,  1  )    +    1  11   B  O  C   (  6  ,  1  )           normal-Φ  f         10  11   B  O  C   1  1        1  11   B  O  C   6  1       \Phi(f)=\frac{10}{11}BOC(1,1)+\frac{1}{11}BOC(6,1)     References  de:Binary Offset Carrier#Multiplexed Binary Offset Carrier "  Category:Quantized radio modulation modes     Navipedia information on MBCO Modulation ↩  Galileo Open Service Signal In Space Interface Control Document (OS SIS ICD) , GSA, Issue 1.1, September 2010 ↩  [Hoult, N.; Aguado, L.
