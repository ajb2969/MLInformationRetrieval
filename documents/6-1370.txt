   Conjugate points      Conjugate points   In differential geometry , conjugate points are, roughly, points that can almost be joined by a 1-parameter family of geodesics . For example, on a sphere , the north-pole and south-pole are connected by any meridian .  Definition  Suppose p and q are points on a Riemannian manifold , and   γ   γ   \gamma   is a geodesic that connects p and q . Then p and q are conjugate points along   γ   γ   \gamma    if there exists a non-zero Jacobi field along   γ   γ   \gamma   that vanishes at p and q .  Recall that any Jacobi field can be written as the derivative of a geodesic variation (see the article on Jacobi fields ). Therefore, if p and q are conjugate along   γ   γ   \gamma   , one can construct a family of geodesics that start at p and almost end at q . In particular, if     γ  s    (  t  )        subscript  γ  s   t    \gamma_{s}(t)   is the family of geodesics whose derivative in s at    s  =  0      s  0    s=0   generates the Jacobi field J , then the end point of the variation, namely     γ  s    (  1  )        subscript  γ  s   1    \gamma_{s}(1)   , is the point q only up to first order in s . Therefore, if two points are conjugate, it is not necessary that there exist two distinct geodesics joining them.  Examples   On the sphere    S  2     superscript  S  2    S^{2}   , antipodal points are conjugate.  On    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , there are no conjugate points.  On Riemannian manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature , there are no conjugate points.   See also   Cut locus  Jacobi field   "  Category:Riemannian geometry
