   Progesterone monooxygenase      Progesterone monooxygenase   In enzymology , a progesterone monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   progesterone + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   testosterone acetate + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are progesterone , AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are testosterone acetate , A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is progesterone,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called progesterone hydroxylase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
