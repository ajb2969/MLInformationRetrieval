   ADP-glyceromanno-heptose 6-epimerase      ADP-glyceromanno-heptose 6-epimerase   In enzymology , an ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose 6-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , ADP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose , and one product , ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose 6-epimerase . This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , NADP+ in a direct oxidation mechanism.  Structural studies  As of 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
