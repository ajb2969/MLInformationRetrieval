   Glucose-1-phospho-D-mannosylglycoprotein phosphodiesterase      Glucose-1-phospho-D-mannosylglycoprotein phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a glucose-1-phospho-D-mannosylglycoprotein phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-(D-glucose-1-phospho)-D-mannosylglycoprotein + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate + D-mannosylglycoprotein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-(D-glucose-1-phospho)-D-mannosylglycoprotein and H 2 O , whereas its two products are alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate and D-mannosylglycoprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-(D-glucose-1-phospho)-D-mannosylglycoprotein glucose-1-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called alpha-glucose-1-phosphate phosphodiesterase .
