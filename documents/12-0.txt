   Dividend discount model      Dividend discount model  The '''dividend discount model''' ('''DDM''') is a method of valuing a company's stock price based on the theory that its [[stock]] is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments, discounted back to their present value. [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/04/041404.asp Investopedia – Digging Into The Dividend Discount Model]  In other words, it is used to value stocks based on the net present value of the future dividends . The equation most widely used is called the Gordon growth model . It is named after Myron J. Gordon of the University of Toronto , who originally published it along with Eli Shapiro in 1956 and made reference to it in 1959. 1 2 Their work borrowed heavily from the theoretical and mathematical ideas found in John Burr Williams 1938 book " The Theory of Investment Value ."  The variables are   P   P   P   is the current stock price.   g   g   g   is the constant growth rate in perpetuity expected for the dividends.   r   r   r   is the constant cost of equity capital for that company.    D  1     subscript  D  1    D_{1}   is the value of the next year's dividends .      P  =    D  1    r  -  g        P     subscript  D  1     r  g      P=\frac{D_{1}}{r-g}     Derivation of equation  The model uses the fact that the current value of the dividend payment     D  0     (   1  +  g   )   t        subscript  D  0    superscript    1  g   t     D_{0}(1+g)^{t}   at (discrete ) time   t   t   t   is      D  0     (   1  +  g   )   t      (   1  +  r   )   t          subscript  D  0    superscript    1  g   t     superscript    1  r   t     \frac{D_{0}(1+g)^{t}}{{(1+r)}^{t}}   , and so the current value of all the future dividend payments, which is the current price   P   P   P   , is the sum of the infinite series      P  =    ∑   t  =  1   ∞     D  0      (   1  +  g   )   t     (   1  +  r   )   t          P    superscript   subscript     t  1         subscript  D  0      superscript    1  g   t    superscript    1  r   t        P=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}{D_{0}}\frac{(1+g)^{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}   This summation can be rewritten as      P  =   D  0    r  ′    (  1  +   r  ′   +   r   ′   2   +   r   ′   3   +  …  .  )      fragments  P    subscript  D  0    superscript  r  normal-′    fragments  normal-(  1    superscript  r  normal-′     superscript   superscript  r  normal-′   2     superscript   superscript  r  normal-′   3    normal-…  normal-.  normal-)     P={D_{0}}r^{\prime}(1+r^{\prime}+{r^{\prime}}^{2}+{r^{\prime}}^{3}+....)     where        r  ′   =    (   1  +  g   )    (   1  +  r   )     .       superscript  r  normal-′       1  g     1  r      r^{\prime}=\frac{(1+g)}{(1+r)}.     Clearly, the series in parenthesis is the geometric series with common ratio    r  ′     superscript  r  normal-′    r^{\prime}   so it sums to    1   1  -   r  ′        1    1   superscript  r  normal-′      \frac{1}{1-r^{\prime}}   if     r  ′   <  1       superscript  r  normal-′   1    r^{\prime}<1   . Thus,      P  =     D  0    r  ′     1  -   r  ′         P       subscript  D  0    superscript  r  normal-′      1   superscript  r  normal-′       P=\frac{D_{0}r^{\prime}}{1-r^{\prime}}     Substituting the value for    r  ′     superscript  r  normal-′    r^{\prime}   leads to      P  =      D  0    (   1  +  g   )     (   1  +  r   )     1  -    1  +  g    1  +  r          P         subscript  D  0     1  g      1  r      1      1  g     1  r        P=\frac{\frac{{D_{0}}(1+g)}{(1+r)}}{1-\frac{1+g}{1+r}}   , which is simplified by multiplying by     1  +  r    1  +  r         1  r     1  r     \frac{1+r}{1+r}   , so that      P  =     D  0    (   1  +  g   )     r  -  g        P       subscript  D  0     1  g      r  g      P=\frac{D_{0}(1+g)}{r-g}     Income plus capital gains equals total return  The equation can also be understood to compute the value of a stock such that the sum of its dividend yield (income) plus its growth (capital gains) equals the investor's required total return. Consider the dividend growth rate as a proxy for the growth of earnings and by extension the stock price and capital gains. Consider the company's cost of equity capital as a proxy for the investor's required total return. 3       Income  +  Capital Gain   =  Total Return        Income  Capital Gain   Total Return    \text{Income}+\text{Capital Gain}=\text{Total Return}          Dividend Yield  +  Growth   =  Cost Of Equity        Dividend Yield  Growth   Cost Of Equity    \text{Dividend Yield}+\text{Growth}=\text{Cost Of Equity}           D  P   +  g   =  r          D  P   g   r    \frac{D}{P}+g=r          D  P   =   r  -  g         D  P     r  g     \frac{D}{P}=r-g          D   r  -  g    =  P        D    r  g    P    \frac{D}{r-g}=P     Growth cannot exceed cost of equity  From the first equation, one might notice that    r  -  g      r  g    r-g   cannot be negative. When growth is expected to exceed the cost of equity in the short run, then usually a two-stage DDM is used:      P  =     ∑   t  =  1   N      D  0     (   1  +  g   )   t      (   1  +  r   )   t     +    P  N     (   1  +  r   )   N         P      superscript   subscript     t  1    N        subscript  D  0    superscript    1  g   t     superscript    1  r   t        subscript  P  N    superscript    1  r   N       P=\sum_{t=1}^{N}\frac{D_{0}\left(1+g\right)^{t}}{\left(1+r\right)^{t}}+\frac{P%
 _{N}}{\left(1+r\right)^{N}}     Therefore,       P  =       D  0    (   1  +  g   )     r  -  g     [   1  -     (   1  +  g   )   N     (   1  +  r   )   N     ]    +     D  0     (   1  +  g   )   N    (   1  +   g  ∞    )       (   1  +  r   )   N    (   r  -   g  ∞    )       ,      P           subscript  D  0     1  g      r  g     delimited-[]    1     superscript    1  g   N    superscript    1  r   N            subscript  D  0    superscript    1  g   N     1   subscript  g         superscript    1  r   N     r   subscript  g          P=\frac{D_{0}\left(1+g\right)}{r-g}\left[1-\frac{\left(1+g\right)^{N}}{\left(1%
 +r\right)^{N}}\right]+\frac{D_{0}\left(1+g\right)^{N}\left(1+g_{\infty}\right)%
 }{\left(1+r\right)^{N}\left(r-g_{\infty}\right)},     where   g   g   g   denotes the short-run expected growth rate,    g  ∞     subscript  g     g_{\infty}   denotes the long-run growth rate, and   N   N   N   is the period (number of years), over which the short-run growth rate is applied.  Even when g is very close to r , P approaches infinity, so the model becomes meaningless.  Some properties of the model  ' a) ' When the growth g is zero the dividend is capitalized.       P  0   =    D  1   r        subscript  P  0      subscript  D  1   r     P_{0}=\frac{D_{1}}{r}   .  ' b) ' This equation is also used to estimate cost of capital by solving for   r   r   r   .       r  =     D  1    P  0    +  g    .      r       subscript  D  1    subscript  P  0    g     r=\frac{D_{1}}{P_{0}}+g.     Problems with the model  ' a) ' The presumption of a steady and perpetual growth rate less than the cost of capital may not be reasonable.  b) If the stock does not currently pay a dividend, like many growth stocks , more general versions of the discounted dividend model must be used to value the stock. One common technique is to assume that the Modigliani-Miller hypothesis of dividend irrelevance is true, and therefore replace the stocks's dividend D with E earnings per share. However, this requires the use of earnings growth rather than dividend growth, which might be different. This approach is especially useful for computing a residual value of future periods.  c) The stock price resulting from the Gordon model is hyper-sensitive to the growth rate   g   g   g   chosen.  Related methods  The dividend discount model is closely related to both discounted earnings and discounted cashflow models. In either of the latter two, the value of a company is based on how much money is made by the company. For example, if a company consistently paid out 50% of earnings as dividends, then the discounted dividends would be worth 50% of the discounted earnings. Also, in the dividend discount model, a company that does not pay dividends is worth nothing.
