   Benzene 1,2-dioxygenase      Benzene 1,2-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a benzene 1,2-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction  (Figure)  Benzene 1,2-dioxygenase.svg    benzene + NADH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cis-cyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol + NAD +   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are benzene , NADH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its two products are cis-cyclohexa-3,5-diene-1,2-diol and NAD + .  Classification  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of two atoms o oxygen into the other donor.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzene,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (1,2-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include benzene hydroxylase , and benzene dioxygenase .  Biological role  This enzyme participates in naphthalene and anthracene degradation . It has 4 cofactors : FAD , Iron , Sulfur , and Iron-sulfur .
