K-convex function




K-convex function

K-convex functions, first introduced by Scarf,1 are a special weakening of the concept of convex function which is crucial in the proof of the optimality of the 
 
 
 
  policy in inventory control theory. The policy is characterized by two numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , such that when the inventory level falls below level 
 
 
 
 , an order is issued for a quantity that brings the inventory up to level 
 
 
 
 , and nothing is ordered otherwise.
Definition
Two equivalent definitions are as follows:
Definition 1 (The original definition)
A function 
 
 
 
  is K-convex if


 
  for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Definition 2 (Definition with geometric interpretation)
A function 
 
 
 
  is K-convex if


 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 .
This definition admits a simple geometric interpretation related to the concept of visibility.2 Let 
 
 
 
 . A point 
 
 
 
  is said to be visible from 
 
 
 
  if all intermediate points 
 
 
 
  lie below the line segment joining these two points. Then the geometric characterization of K-convexity can be obtain as:

A function 
 
 
 
  is K-convex if and only if 
 
 
 
  is visible from 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
 

Proof of Equivalence
It is sufficient to prove that the above definitions can be transformed to each other. This can be seen by using the transformation



Properties
Property 1
If 
 
 
 
  is K-convex, then it is L-convex for any 
 
 
 
 . In particular, if 
 
 
 
  is convex, then it is also K-convex for any 
 
 
 
 .
Property 2
If 
 
 
 
  is K-convex and 
 
 
 
  is L-convex, then for 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -convex.
Property 3
If 
 
 
 
  is K-convex and 
 
 
 
  is a random variable such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is also K-convex.
Property 4
If 
 
 
 
  is a continuous K-convex function and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , then there exit scalars 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  such that



 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 ;



 
  is a decreasing function on 
 
 
 
 ;


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
