Spitzer resistivity

Spitzer resistivity is a classical model of electrical resistivity, 
 
 
 
 , that is based upon electron ion collisions.12 It is given by



where Z is the ionization of nuclei, m is the electron mass, ε0 is the electric permittivity of free space, lnΛ is the Coulomb logarithm, kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in kelvins.
This resistivity model was proposed by Lyman Spitzer.3
Spitzer resistivity is commonly used in plasma physics.4
