   Spitzer resistivity      Spitzer resistivity   Spitzer resistivity is a classical model of electrical resistivity ,   η   η   \eta   , that is based upon electron ion collisions. 1 2 It is given by      η  =     π  Z   e  2    m   1  /  2     ln  Λ       (   4  π   ε  0    )   2     (    k  B   T   )    3  /  2           η      π  Z   superscript  e  2    superscript  m    1  2      normal-Λ       superscript    4  π   subscript  ε  0    2    superscript     subscript  k  B   T     3  2        \eta=\dfrac{\pi Ze^{2}m^{1/2}\ln\Lambda}{\left(4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\right)^{2}%
 \left(k_{B}T\right)^{3/2}}     where Z is the ionization of nuclei, m is the electron mass, ε 0 is the electric permittivity of free space, lnΛ is the Coulomb logarithm , k B is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in kelvins.  This resistivity model was proposed by Lyman Spitzer . 3  Spitzer resistivity is commonly used in plasma physics. 4  References  External links   http://people.duke.edu/~ad159/files/p142/25.pdf   "  Category:Electronics     ↩  ↩  ↩
