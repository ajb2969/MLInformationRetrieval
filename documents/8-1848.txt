   Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers      Generalizations of Fibonacci numbers   In mathematics , the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence defined recursively by:   F (0) = 0  F (1) = 1  F ( n ) = F ( n -1) + F ( n -2), for integer  n > 1.   That is, after two starting values, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.  The Fibonacci sequence has been studied extensively and generalized in many ways, for example, by starting with other numbers than 0 and 1, by adding more than two numbers to generate the next number, or by adding objects other than numbers.  Extension to negative integers  Using F n -2 = F n - F n -1 , one can extend the Fibonacci numbers to negative integers. So we get: ... -8, 5, -3, 2, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... and F -n = -(-1) n F n .  See also Negafibonacci .  Extension to all real or complex numbers  There are a number of possible generalizations of the Fibonacci numbers which include the real numbers (and sometimes the complex numbers ) in their domain. These each involve the golden ratio    φ   φ   \varphi   , and are based on Binet's formula        F  n   =     φ  n   -    (   -  φ   )    -  n      5     .       subscript  F  n        superscript  φ  n    superscript    φ     n       5      F_{n}=\frac{\varphi^{n}-(-\varphi)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}.     The analytic function       F  e   (  x  )    =     φ  x   -   φ   -  x      5          F  e  x        superscript  φ  x    superscript  φ    x       5      Fe(x)=\frac{\varphi^{x}-\varphi^{-x}}{\sqrt{5}}     has the property that Fe ( n ) = F n for even integers n . 1 Similarly, the analytic function:       F  o   (  x  )    =     φ  x   +   φ   -  x      5          F  o  x        superscript  φ  x    superscript  φ    x       5      Fo(x)=\frac{\varphi^{x}+\varphi^{-x}}{\sqrt{5}}     satisfies Fo ( n ) = F n for odd integers n .  Finally, putting these together, the analytic function       F  i  b   (  x  )    =     φ  x   -    cos   (   x  π   )     φ   -  x       5          F  i  b  x        superscript  φ  x         x  π     superscript  φ    x        5      Fib(x)=\frac{\varphi^{x}-\cos(x\pi)\varphi^{-x}}{\sqrt{5}}     satisfies Fib ( n )= F n for all integers n . 2  Since Fib ( x+2 ) = Fib ( x+1 ) + Fib ( x ) for all complex numbers x , this function also provides an extension of the Fibonacci sequence to the entire complex plane. Hence we can calculate the generalized Fibonacci function of a complex variable, for example,       F  i  b   (   3  +   4  i    )    ≈    -  5248.5   -   14195.9  i          F  i  b    3    4  i         5248.5     14195.9  i      Fib(3+4i)\approx-5248.5-14195.9i     Vector space  The term Fibonacci sequence is also applied more generally to any function  g from the integers to a field for which g ( n +2) = g ( n ) + g ( n +1). These functions are precisely those of the form g ( n ) = F ( n ) g (1) + F ( n -1) g (0), so the Fibonacci sequences form a vector space with the functions F ( n ) and F ( n -1) as a basis.  More generally, the range of g may be taken to be any abelian group (regarded as a Z-module ). Then the Fibonacci sequences form a 2-dimensional Z-module in the same way.  Similar integer sequences  Fibonacci integer sequences  The 2-dimensional Z-module of Fibonacci integer sequences consists of all integer sequences satisfying g ( n +2) = g ( n ) + g ( n +1). Expressed in terms of two initial values we have:   g ( n ) = F ( n ) g (1) + F ( n -1) g (0) =      g   (  1  )      φ  n   -    (   -  φ   )    -  n      5     +   g   (  0  )       φ   n  -  1    -    (   -  φ   )    1  -  n      5       ,        g  1       superscript  φ  n    superscript    φ     n       5       g  0       superscript  φ    n  1     superscript    φ     1  n       5       g(1){{\varphi^{n}-(-\varphi)^{-n}}\over{\sqrt{5}}}+g(0){{\varphi^{n-1}-(-%
 \varphi)^{1-n}}\over{\sqrt{5}}}\,,      where   φ   φ   \varphi   is the golden ratio.  Written in the form       a   φ  n    +   b    (   -  φ   )    -  n           a   superscript  φ  n      b   superscript    φ     n       a\varphi^{n}+b(-\varphi)^{-n}     a = 0 if and only if b = 0.  Thus the ratio between two consecutive elements converges to the golden ratio, except in the case of the sequence which is constantly zero.  Written in this form the simplest non-trivial example ( a = b = 1) is the sequence of Lucas numbers :       L  n   =    φ  n   +    (   -  φ   )    -  n          subscript  L  n      superscript  φ  n    superscript    φ     n       L_{n}=\varphi^{n}+(-\varphi)^{-n}     We have L (1) = 1 and L (2) = 3. The properties include:        φ  n   =    (    1  2    (   1  +   5    )    )   n   =    1  2    (    L   (  n  )    +   F   (  n  )    5     )     .         superscript  φ  n    superscript      1  2     1    5     n            1  2       L  n     F  n    5         \varphi^{n}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\sqrt{5}\right)\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{2}%
 \left(L(n)+F(n)\sqrt{5}\right).           L   (  n  )    =    F   (   n  -  1   )    +   F   (   n  +  1   )      .        L  n       F    n  1      F    n  1       L\left(n\right)=F\left(n-1\right)+F\left(n+1\right).\,     Every nontrivial Fibonacci integer sequence appears (possibly after a shift by a finite number of positions) as one of the rows of the Wythoff array . The Fibonacci sequence itself is the first row, and a shift of the Lucas sequence is the second row. 3  See also Fibonacci integer sequences modulo n .  Lucas sequences  A generalization of the Fibonacci sequence are the Lucas sequences of the kind defined as follows:   U (0) = 0  U (1) = 1  U ( n + 2) = PU ( n + 1) − QU ( n )   where the normal Fibonacci sequence is the special case of P = 1 and Q = −1. Another kind of Lucas sequence begins with V (0) = 2, V (1) = P . Such sequences have applications in number theory and primality proving.  When Q = -1, this sequence is called P -Fibonacci sequence , for example, Pell sequence is also called 2-Fibonacci sequence .  The 3-Fibonacci sequence is   0, 1, 3, 10, 33, 109, 360, 1189, 3927, 12970, 42837, 141481, 467280, 1543321, 5097243, 16835050, 55602393, 183642229, 606529080, ...   The 4-Fibonacci sequence is   0, 1, 4, 17, 72, 305, 1292, 5473, 23184, 98209, 416020, 1762289, 7465176, 31622993, 133957148, 567451585, 2403763488, ...

The 6-Fibonacci sequence is   0, 1, 6, 37, 228, 1405, 8658, 53353, 328776, 2026009, 12484830, 76934989, 474094764, 2921503573, 18003116202, ...   The n-Fibonacci constant is the ratio toward which adjacent n-Fibonacci numbers tend, it is also called the n-th expensive metal ratio , and it is the only positive root of x 2 - n x-1=0, for example, the case of n = 1 is     1  +   5    2        1    5    2    \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}   or the golden ratio , and the case of n = 2 is    1  +   2       1    2     1+\sqrt{2}   or the silver ratio , generally, the case of n is     n  +     n  2   +  4     2        n       superscript  n  2   4     2    \frac{n+\sqrt{n^{2}+4}}{2}   .  Generally, U (n) can be called ( P , -Q )-Fibonacci sequence , and V (n) can be called ( P , -Q )-Lucas sequence .  The (1,2)-Fibonacci sequence is   0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, 2731, 5461, 10923, 21845, 43691, 87381, 174763, 349525, 699051, 1398101, 2796203, 5592405, 11184811, 22369621, 44739243, 89478485, ...   The (1,3)-Fibonacci sequence is   1, 1, 4, 7, 19, 40, 97, 217, 508, 1159, 2683, 6160, 14209, 32689, 75316, 173383, 399331, 919480, 2117473, 4875913, 11228332, 25856071, 59541067, ...   The (2,2)-Fibonacci sequence is   0, 1, 2, 6, 16, 44, 120, 328, 896, 2448, 6688, 18272, 49920, 136384, 372608, 1017984, 2781184, 7598336, 20759040, 56714752, ...   The (3,3)-Fibonacci sequence is   0, 1, 3, 12, 45, 171, 648, 2457, 9315, 35316, 133893, 507627, 1924560, 7296561, 27663363, 104879772, 397629405, 1507527531, 5715470808, ...   Fibonacci numbers of higher order  A Fibonacci sequence of order n is an integer sequence in which each sequence element is the sum of the previous n elements (with the exception of the first n elements in the sequence). The usual Fibonacci numbers are a Fibonacci sequence of order 2. The cases n =3 and n =4 have been thoroughly investigated. The number of compositions of nonnegative integers into parts that are at most n is a Fibonacci sequence of order n . The sequence of the number of strings of 0s and 1s of length m that contain at most n consecutive 0s is also a Fibonacci sequence of order n .  Tribonacci numbers  The tribonacci numbers are like the Fibonacci numbers, but instead of starting with two predetermined terms, the sequence starts with three predetermined terms and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding three terms. The first few tribonacci numbers are:   0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 13 , 24 , 44 , 81 , 149 , 274, 504, 927, 1705, 3136, 5768, 10609, 19513, 35890, 66012, …   The tribonacci constant      1  +    19  +   3   33     3   +    19  -   3   33     3    3        1     3     19    3    33         3     19    3    33       3    \tfrac{1+\sqrt[3]{19+3\sqrt{33}}+\sqrt[3]{19-3\sqrt{33}}}{3}   is the ratio toward which adjacent tribonacci numbers tend. It is a root of the polynomial x 3 − x 2 − x − 1, approximately 1.83929 , and also satisfies the equation x + x −3 = 2. It is important in the study of the snub cube .  The tribonacci numbers are also given by 4      T   (  n  )   =   ⌊   3   b     (    1  3    (    a  +   +   a  -   +  1   )    )   n      b  2   -   2  b    +  4    ⌉      fragments  T   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)     fragments  normal-⌊  3  b     superscript      1  3      subscript  a     subscript  a    1    n        superscript  b  2     2  b    4    normal-⌉     T(n)=\left\lfloor 3\,b\frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}\left(a_{+}+a_{-}+1\right)\right)%
 ^{n}}{b^{2}-2b+4}\right\rceil     where    ⌊  ⋅  ⌉     delimited-⌊⌉  normal-⋅    \lfloor\cdot\rceil   denote the nearest integer function and       a  ±   =    (   19  ±   3   33     )    1  /  3         subscript  a  plus-or-minus    superscript   plus-or-minus  19    3    33       1  3      a_{\pm}=\left(19\pm 3\sqrt{33}\right)^{1/3}         b  =    (   586  +   102   33     )    1  /  3        b   superscript    586    102    33       1  3      b=\left(586+102\sqrt{33}\right)^{1/3}   .  Tetranacci numbers  The tetranacci numbers start with four predetermined terms, each term afterwards being the sum of the preceding four terms. The first few tetranacci numbers are:   0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 , 29 , 56 , 108 , 208, 401, 773, 1490, 2872, 5536, 10671, 20569, 39648, 76424, 147312, 283953, 547337, …   The tetranacci constant is the ratio toward which adjacent tetranacci numbers tend. It is a root of the polynomial x 4 − x 3 − x 2 − x − 1, approximately 1.92756 , and also satisfies the equation x + x −4 = 2.  Higher orders  Pentanacci, hexanacci, and heptanacci numbers have been computed. The pentanacci numbers are:   0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 61, 120, 236, 464, 912, 1793, 3525, 6930, 13624, …   Hexanacci numbers:   0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 63, 125, 248, 492, 976, 1936, 3840, 7617, 15109, …   Heptanacci numbers:   0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 127, 253, 504, 1004, 2000, 3984, 7936, 15808, …   Octanacci numbers:   0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 255, 509, 1016, 2028, 4048, 8080, 16128, ...   Nonacci numbers:   0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 511, 1021, 2040, 4076, 8144, 16272, ...   The limit of the ratio of successive terms of an n -nacci series tends to a root of the equation     x  +   x   -  n     =   2         x   superscript  x    n     2    x+x^{-n}=2\,   (, , ).  An alternate recursive formula for the limit of ratio r of two consecutive n-nacci numbers can be expressed as    r  =    ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1     r   -  k         r    superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1     superscript  r    k       r=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}r^{-k}   .  The special case n=2 is the traditional Fibonacci series yielding the golden section    ϕ  =   1  +   1  ϕ        ϕ    1    1  ϕ      \phi=1+\frac{1}{\phi}   .  The above formulas for the ratio hold even for n-nacci series generated from arbitrary numbers. The limit of this ratio is 2 as n increases. A 'polynacci' sequence, if one could be described, would after an infinite number of zeroes yield the sequence   [..., 0, 0, 1,] 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, …   which are simply powers of 2.  And the k th element of the n -nacci sequence is given by       F  k   (  n  )    =   [     r   k  -  1     (   r  -  1   )       (   n  +  1   )   r   -   2  n     ]        superscript   subscript  F  k   n    delimited-[]       superscript  r    k  1      r  1          n  1   r     2  n        F_{k}^{(n)}=\left[\frac{r^{k-1}(r-1)}{(n+1)r-2n}\right]   where the outer brackets denote the nearest integer function and r is the n -nacci constant which is the root of     x  +   x   -  n     =  2        x   superscript  x    n     2    x+x^{-n}=2   near to 2. 5  A Coin Tossing Problem is related to the n -nacci sequence. The probability that no n consecutive tails will occur in m tosses of an idealized coin is     F   m  +  2    (  n  )     2  m        superscript   subscript  F    m  2    n    superscript  2  m     \frac{F_{m+2}^{(n)}}{2^{m}}   . 6  Fibonacci word  In analogy to its numerical counterpart, the Fibonacci word is defined by:       F  n   :=   F   (  n  )    :=   {     b       if  n   =  0   ;       a       if  n   =  1   ;         F   (   n  -  1   )    +   F   (   n  -  2   )         if  n   >  1.            assign   subscript  F  n     F  n     assign     cases  b      if  n   0   a      if  n   1       F    n  1      F    n  2         if  n   1.       F_{n}:=F(n):=\begin{cases}b&\mbox{if }n=0;\\
 a&\mbox{if }n=1;\\
 F(n-1)+F(n-2)&\mbox{if }n>1.\\
 \end{cases}   where + denotes the concatenation of two strings. The sequence of Fibonacci strings starts:   b, a, ab, aba, abaab, abaababa, abaababaabaab, …   The length of each Fibonacci string is a Fibonacci number, and similarly there exists a corresponding Fibonacci string for each Fibonacci number.  Fibonacci strings appear as inputs for the worst case in some computer algorithms .  If "a" and "b" represent two different materials or atomic bond lengths, the structure corresponding to a Fibonacci string is a Fibonacci quasicrystal , an aperiodic quasicrystal structure with unusual spectral properties.  Convolved Fibonacci sequences  A convolved Fibonacci sequence is obtained applying a convolution operation to the Fibonacci sequence one or more times. Specifically, define 7       F  n   (  0  )    =   F  n        superscript   subscript  F  n   0    subscript  F  n     F_{n}^{(0)}=F_{n}   and       F  n   (   r  +  1   )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     F  i    F   n  -  i    (  r  )           superscript   subscript  F  n     r  1      superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  F  i    superscript   subscript  F    n  i    r       F_{n}^{(r+1)}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}F_{i}F_{n-i}^{(r)}     The first few sequences are   ( r =1): 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 38, 71, … .  ( r =2): 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 9, 22, 51, 111, … .  ( r =3): 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 14, 40, 105, … .   The sequences can be calculated using the recurrence       F   n  +  1    (   r  +  1   )    =    F  n   (   r  +  1   )    +   F   n  -  1    (   r  +  1   )    +   F  n   (  r  )          superscript   subscript  F    n  1      r  1       superscript   subscript  F  n     r  1     superscript   subscript  F    n  1      r  1     superscript   subscript  F  n   r      F_{n+1}^{(r+1)}=F_{n}^{(r+1)}+F_{n-1}^{(r+1)}+F_{n}^{(r)}     The generating function of the r -th convolution is         s   (  r  )     (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     F  n   (  r  )     x  n     =    (   x   1  -  x  -   x  2     )   r    .           superscript  s  r   x     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript   superscript  F  r   n    superscript  x  n           superscript    x    1  x   superscript  x  2     r      s^{(r)}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}F^{(r)}_{n}x^{n}=\left(\frac{x}{1-x-x^{2}}\right%
 )^{r}.     The sequences are related to the sequence of Fibonacci polynomials by the relation       F  n   (  r  )    =    r  !    F  n   (  r  )     (  1  )         superscript   subscript  F  n   r       r    superscript   subscript  F  n   r   1     F_{n}^{(r)}=r!F_{n}^{(r)}(1)   where F n (r) ( x ) is the r -th derivative of F n ( x ). Equivalently, F n (r) is the coefficient of ( x −1) r when F n ( x ) is expanded in powers of ( x −1).  The first convolution, F n (1) can be written in terms of the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers as       F  n   (  1  )    =    (    n   L  n    -   F  n    )   /  5        superscript   subscript  F  n   1         n   subscript  L  n     subscript  F  n    5     F_{n}^{(1)}=(nL_{n}-F_{n})/5   and follows the recurrence        F   n  +  1    (  1  )    =     2   F  n   (  1  )     +   F   n  -  1    (  1  )     -   2   F   n  -  2    (  1  )     -   F   n  -  3    (  1  )      .       superscript   subscript  F    n  1    1         2   superscript   subscript  F  n   1     superscript   subscript  F    n  1    1      2   superscript   subscript  F    n  2    1     superscript   subscript  F    n  3    1      F_{n+1}^{(1)}=2F_{n}^{(1)}+F_{n-1}^{(1)}-2F_{n-2}^{(1)}-F_{n-3}^{(1)}.   Similar expressions can be found for r >1 with increasing complexity as r increases. The numbers F n (1) are the row sums of Hosoya's triangle .  As with Fibonacci numbers, there are several combinatorial interpretations of these sequences. For example F n (1) is the number of ways n −2 can be written as an ordered sum involving only 0, 1, and 2 with 0 used exactly once. In particular F 4 (1) =5 and 2 can be written 0+1+1, 0+2, 1+0+1, 1+1+0, 2+0. 8  Other generalizations  The Fibonacci polynomials are another generalization of Fibonacci numbers.  The Padovan sequence is generated by the recurrence P ( n ) = P ( n − 2) + P ( n − 3).  A random Fibonacci sequence can be defined by tossing a coin for each position n of the sequence and taking F ( n )= F ( n −1)+ F ( n −2) if it lands heads and F ( n )= F ( n −1)− F ( n −2) if it lands tails. Work by Furstenburg and Kesten guarantees that this sequence almost surely grows exponentially at a constant rate: the constant is independent of the coin tosses and was computed in 1999 by Divakar Viswanath . It is now known as Viswanath's constant .  A repfigit , or Keith number , is an integer such that, when its digits start a Fibonacci sequence with that number of digits, the original number is eventually reached. An example is 47, because the Fibonacci sequence starting with 4 and 7 (4,7,11,18,29,47) reaches 47. A repfigit can be a tribonacci sequence if there are 3 digits in the number, a tetranacci number if the number has four digits, etc. The first few repfigits are:   14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 742, 1104, 1537, 2208, 2580, 3684, 4788, 7385, 7647, 7909, …   Since the set of sequences satisfying the relation S ( n ) = S ( n −1) + S ( n −2) is closed under termwise addition and under termwise multiplication by a constant, it can be viewed as a vector space . Any such sequence is uniquely determined by a choice of two elements, so the vector space is two-dimensional. If we abbreviate such a sequence as ( S (0), S (1)), the Fibonacci sequence F ( n ) = (0, 1) and the shifted Fibonacci sequence F ( n −1) = (1, 0) are seen to form a canonical basis for this space, yielding the identity:   S ( n ) = S (0) F ( n −1) + S (1) F ( n )   for all such sequences S . For example, if S is the Lucas sequence 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11…, then we obtain     L   (  n  )    =    2  F   (   n  -  1   )    +   F   (  n  )           L  n       2  F    n  1      F  n      L(n)=2F(n-1)+F(n)   .
