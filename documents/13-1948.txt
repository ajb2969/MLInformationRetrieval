Method of quantum characteristics

Quantum characteristics are phase-space trajectories that arise in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics through the Wigner transform of Heisenberg operators of canonical coordinates and momenta. These trajectories obey the Hamilton equations in quantum form and play the role of characteristics in terms of which time-dependent Weyl's symbols of quantum operators can be expressed. In the classical limit, quantum characteristics reduce to classical trajectories. The knowledge of quantum characteristics is equivalent to the knowledge of quantum dynamics.
Weyl-Wigner association rule
In Hamiltonian dynamics, classical systems with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom are described by 
 
 
 
  canonical coordinates and momenta


 
  that form a coordinate system in the phase space. These variables satisfy the Poisson bracket relations


 
  The skew-symmetric matrix 
 
 
 
 ,



where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
  identity matrix, defines nondegenerate 2-form in the phase space. The phase space acquires thereby the structure of a symplectic manifold. The phase space is not metric space, so distance between two points is not defined. The Poisson bracket of two functions can be interpreted as the oriented area of a parallelogram whose adjacent sides are gradients of these functions. Rotations in Euclidean space leave the distance between two points invariant. Canonical transformations in symplectic manifold leave the areas invariant.
In quantum mechanics, the canonical variables 
 
 
 
  are associated to operators of canonical coordinates and momenta



These operators act in Hilbert space and obey commutation relations



Weyl’s association rule1 extends the correspondence 
 
 
 
  to arbitrary phase-space functions and operators.
Taylor expansion
A one-sided association rule 
 
 
 
  was formulated by Weyl initially with the help of Taylor expansion of functions of operators of the canonical variables



The operators 
 
 
 
  do not commute, so the Taylor expansion is not defined uniquely. The above prescription uses the symmetrized products of the operators. The real functions correspond to the Hermitian operators. The function 
 
 
 
  is called Weyl's symbol of operator 
 
 
 
 .
Under the reverse association 
 
 
 
 , the density matrix turns to the Wigner function.2 Wigner functions have numerous applications in quantum many-body physics, kinetic theory, collision theory, quantum chemistry.
A refined version of the Weyl-Wigner association rule is proposed by Groenewold3 and Stratonovich.4
Groenewold-Stratonovich basis
The set of operators acting in the Hilbert space is closed under multiplication of operators by 
 
 
 
 -numbers and summation. Such a set constitutes a vector space 
 
 
 
 . The association rule formulated with the use of the Taylor expansion preserves operations on the operators. The correspondence can be illustrated with the following diagram:






\left. \begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{c} \left. \begin{array}{ccc} f(\xi ) & \longleftrightarrow & \hat{f} \\ g(\xi ) & \longleftrightarrow & \hat{g} \\ c\times f(\xi ) & \longleftrightarrow & c \times \hat{f} \\ f(\xi )+g(\xi ) & \longleftrightarrow & \hat{f} + \hat{g} \end{array} \right\} \;\text{vector space}\;\; \mathbb{V} \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{ccc} { f(\xi )\star g(\xi )} & {\longleftrightarrow} & \;\; { \hat{f}\hat{g} } \end{array} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \end{array} \right\} {\text{algebra}}  Here, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are functions and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the associated operators.
The elements of basis of 
 
 
 
  are labelled by canonical variables 
 
 
 
 . The commonly used Stratonovich basis looks like



The Weyl-Wigner two-sided association rule for function 
 
 
 
  and operator 
 
 
 
  has the form






The function 
 
 
 
  provides coordinates of the operator 
 
 
 
  in the basis 
 
 
 
 . The basis is complete and orthogonal:






Alternative operator bases are discussed also.5 The freedom in choice of the operator basis is better known as the operator ordering problem.
Star-product
The set of operators 
 
 
 
  is closed under the multiplication of operators. The vector space 
 
 
 
  is endowed thereby with an associative algebra structure. Given two functions


 
  one can construct a third function



called 
 
 
 
 -product 6 or Moyal product. It is given explicitly by



where


 
  is the Poisson operator. The 
 
 
 
 -product splits into symmetric and skew-symmetric parts



The 
 
 
 
 -product is not associative. In the classical limit 
 
 
 
 -product becomes the dot-product. The skew-symmetric part 
 
 
 
  is known under the name of Moyal bracket. This is the Weyl's symbol of commutator. In the classical limit Moyal bracket becomes Poisson bracket. Moyal bracket is quantum deformation of Poisson bracket.
Quantum characteristics
The correspondence 
 
 
 
  shows that coordinate transformations in the phase space are accompanied by transformations of operators of the canonical coordinates and momenta and vice versa. Let 
 
 
 
  be the evolution operator,


 
  and 
 
 
 
  is Hamiltonian. Consider the following scheme:














Quantum evolution transforms vectors in the Hilbert space and, upon the Wigner association rule, coordinates in the phase space. In Heisenberg representation, the operators of the canonical variables are transformed as


 
  The phase-space coordinates 
 
 
 
  that correspond to new operators 
 
 
 
  in the old basis 
 
 
 
  are given by


 
  with the initial conditions


 
  The functions 
 
 
 
  define quantum phase flow. In the general case, it is canonical to first order in 
 
 
 
 .7
Star-function
The set of operators of canonical variables is complete in the sense that any operator can be represented as a function of operators 
 
 
 
 . Transformations


 
  induce under the Wigner association rule transformations of phase-space functions:














Using the Taylor expansion, the transformation of function 
 
 
 
  under the evolution can be found to be



Composite function defined in such a way is called 
 
 
 
 -function. The composition law differs from the classical one. However, semiclassical expansion of 
 
 
 
  around 
 
 
 
 
  is formally well defined and involves even powers of 
 
 
 
  only. This equation shows that, given quantum characteristics are constructed, physical observables can be found without further addressing to Hamiltonian. The functions 
 
 
 
  play the role of characteristics8 similarly to classical characteristics used to solve classical Liouville equation.
Quantum Liouville equation
The Wigner transform of the evolution equation for the density matrix in the Schrödinger representation leads to a quantum Liouville equation for the Wigner function. The Wigner transform of the evolution equation for operators in the Heisenberg representation,


 
  leads to the same equation with the opposite (plus) sign in the right-hand side:



 
 
 -function solves this equation in terms of quantum characteristics:


 
  Similarly, the evolution of the Wigner function in the Schrödinger representation is given by


 
  The Liouville theorem of classical mechanics fails, to the extent that, locally, the "probability" density in phase space is not preserved in time.
Quantum Hamilton's equations
Quantum Hamilton's equations can be obtained applying the Wigner transform to the evolution equations for Heisenberg operators of canonical coordinates and momenta



The right-hand side is calculated like in the classical mechanics. The composite function is, however, 
 
 
 
 -function. The 
 
 
 
 
 -product violates canonicity of the phase flow beyond the first order in 
 
 
 
 .
Conservation of Moyal bracket
The antisymmetrized products of even number of operators of canonical variables are c-numbers as a consequence of the commutation relations. These products are left invariant by unitary transformations and, in particular,



Phase-space transformations induced by the evolution operator preserve the Moyal bracket and do not preserve the Poisson bracket, so the evolution map


 
  is not canonical.9 Transformation properties of canonical variables and phase-space functions under unitary transformations in the Hilbert space have important distinctions from the case of canonical transformations in the phase space:
Composition law
Quantum characteristics can hardly be treated visually as trajectories along which physical particles move. The reason lies in the star-composition law


 
  which is non-local and is distinct from the dot-composition law of classical mechanics.
Energy conservation
The energy conservation implies


 
 , where


 
  is Hamilton's function. In the usual geometric sense, 
 
 
 
  is not conserved along quantum characteristics.
Summary
The origin of the method of characteristics can be traced back to Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics. Suppose that we have solved in the matrix mechanics the evolution equations for the operators of the canonical coordinates and momenta in the Heisenberg representation. These operators evolve according to


 
  It is known that for any operator 
 
 
 
  one can find a function f(ξ) through which 
 
 
 
 
  is represented in the form 
 
 
 
 . The same operator 
 
 
 
  at time τ is equal to


 
  This equation shows that 
 
 
 
  are characteristics that determine the evolution for all of the operators in Op(L2(Rn)). This property is fully transferred to the phase space upon deformation quantization and, in the limit of ħ → 0, to the classical mechanics.

Table compares properties of characteristics in classical and quantum mechanics. PDE and ODE are partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations, respectively. The quantum Liouville equation is the Weyl-Wigner transform of the von Neumann evolution equation for the density matrix in Schrödinger representation. The quantum Hamilton equations are the Weyl-Wigner transforms of the evolution equations for operators of the canonical coordinates and momenta in Heisenberg representation.
In classical systems, characteristics 
 
 
 
  satisfy usually first-order ODE, e.g., classical Hamilton's equations, and solve first-order PDE, e.g., classical Liouville equation. Functions 
 
 
 
  are characteristics also, despite both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  obey infinite-order PDE.
The quantum phase flow contains entire information on the quantum evolution. Semiclassical expansion of quantum characteristics and 
 
 
 
 -functions of quantum characteristics in power series in 
 
 
 
  allows calculation of the average values of time-dependent physical observables by solving a finite-order coupled system of ODE for phase space trajectories and Jacobi fields.1011 The order of the system of ODE depends on truncation of the power series. The tunneling effect is nonperturbative in 
 
 
 
  and is not captured by the expansion. The density of the quantum probability fluid is not preserved in phase-space, and there is no unambiguously defined notion of trajectories for quantum systems, as the quantum fluid "diffuses".12 Quantum characteristics must therefore be distinguished from both the trajectories of the de Broglie - Bohm theory 13 and the trajectories of the path-integral method in phase space for the amplitudes 14 and the Wigner function. 1516 So far, only a few quantum systems have been explicitly solved using the method of quantum characteristics. 17
