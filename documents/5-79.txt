   Cohomology operation      Cohomology operation   In mathematics , the cohomology operation concept became central to algebraic topology , particularly homotopy theory , from the 1950s onwards, in the shape of the simple definition that if F is a functor defining a cohomology theory , then a cohomology operation should be a natural transformation from F to itself. Throughout there have been two basic points:   the operations can be studied by combinatorial means; and  the effect of the operations is to yield an interesting bicommutant theory.   The origin of these studies was the work of Pontryagin, Postnikov, and Norman Steenrod , who first defined the Pontryagin square , Postnikov square , and Steenrod square operations for singular cohomology , in the case of mod 2 coefficients. The combinatorial aspect there arises as a formulation of the failure of a natural diagonal map, at cochain level. The general theory of the Steenrod algebra of operations has been brought into close relation with that of the symmetric group .  In the Adams spectral sequence the bicommutant aspect is implicit in the use of Ext functors , the derived functors of Hom-functors; if there is a bicommutant aspect, taken over the Steenrod algebra acting, it is only at a derived level. The convergence is to groups in stable homotopy theory , about which information is hard to come by. This connection established the deep interest of the cohomology operations for homotopy theory , and has been a research topic ever since. An extraordinary cohomology theory has its own cohomology operations, and these may exhibit a richer set on constraints.  Formal definition  A cohomology operation    θ   θ   \theta   of type      (  n  ,  q  ,  π  ,  G  )     n  q  π  G    (n,q,\pi,G)\,     is a natural transformation of functors      θ  :     H  n    (  -  ,  π  )    →    H  q    (  -  ,  G  )        normal-:  θ   normal-→     superscript  H  n     π       superscript  H  q     G       \theta:H^{n}(-,\pi)\to H^{q}(-,G)\,     defined on CW complexes .  Relation to Eilenberg-MacLane spaces  Cohomology of CW complexes is representable by an Eilenberg-MacLane space , so by the Yoneda lemma a cohomology operation of type    (  n  ,  q  ,  π  ,  G  )     n  q  π  G    (n,q,\pi,G)   is given by a homotopy class of maps     K   (  π  ,  n  )    →   K   (  G  ,  q  )       normal-→    K   π  n      K   G  q      K(\pi,n)\to K(G,q)   . Using representability once again, the cohomology operation is given by an element of     H  q    (   K   (  π  ,  n  )    ,  G  )        superscript  H  q      K   π  n    G     H^{q}(K(\pi,n),G)   .  Symbolically, letting    [  A  ,  B  ]     A  B    [A,B]   denote the set of homotopy classes of maps from   A   A   A   to   B   B   B   ,           Nat   (    H  n    (  -  ,  π  )    ,    H  q    (  -  ,  G  )    )        =   Nat   (   [  -  ,   K   (  π  ,  n  )    ]   ,   [  -  ,   K   (  G  ,  q  )    ]   )            =   [   K   (  π  ,  n  )    ,   K   (  G  ,  q  )    ]            =    H  q    (   K   (  π  ,  n  )    ;  G  )     .
