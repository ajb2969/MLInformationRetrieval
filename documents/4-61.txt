   Dilation (morphology)      Dilation (morphology)   Dilation is one of the basic operations in mathematical morphology . Originally developed for binary images , it has been expanded first to grayscale images, and then to complete lattices . The dilation operation usually uses a structuring element for probing and expanding the shapes contained in the input image.  Binary operator  (Figure)  The dilation of dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square with rounded corners.   In binary morphology, dilation is a shift-invariant ( translation invariant ) operator, strongly related to the Minkowski addition .  A binary image is viewed in mathematical morphology as a subset of a Euclidean space  R d or the integer grid Z d , for some dimension d . Let E be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, A a binary image in E , and B a structuring element.  The dilation of A by B is defined by:          A  ⊕  B   =    ⋃   b  ∈  B     A  b     .       direct-sum  A  B     subscript     b  B     subscript  A  b      A\oplus B=\bigcup_{b\in B}A_{b}.        [where A b is what??]  Dilation is commutative, also given by     A  ⊕  B   =   B  ⊕  A   =    ⋃   a  ∈  A     B  a           direct-sum  A  B    direct-sum  B  A          subscript     a  A     subscript  B  a       A\oplus B=B\oplus A=\bigcup_{a\in A}B_{a}   .  If B has a center on the origin, then the dilation of A by B can be understood as the locus of the points covered by B when the center of B moves inside A . The dilation of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disk of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2.  The dilation can also be obtained by     A  ⊕  B   =   {   z  ∈  E   ∣      (   B  s   )   z   ∩  A   ≠  ∅   }        direct-sum  A  B    conditional-set    z  E        subscript   superscript  B  s   z   A        A\oplus B=\{z\in E\mid(B^{s})_{z}\cap A\neq\varnothing\}   , where B s denotes the symmetric of B , that is,     B  s   =   {   x  ∈  E   ∣    -  x   ∈  B   }        superscript  B  s    conditional-set    x  E       x   B      B^{s}=\{x\in E\mid-x\in B\}   .  Properties of binary dilation  Here are some properties of the binary dilation operator   It is translation invariant .  It is increasing , that is, if    A  ⊆  C      A  C    A\subseteq C   , then     A  ⊕  B   ⊆   C  ⊕  B        direct-sum  A  B    direct-sum  C  B     A\oplus B\subseteq C\oplus B   .  It is commutative .  If the origin of E belongs to the structuring element B , then it is extensive , i.e.,    A  ⊆   A  ⊕  B       A   direct-sum  A  B     A\subseteq A\oplus B   .  It is associative , i.e.,      (   A  ⊕  B   )   ⊕  C   =   A  ⊕   (   B  ⊕  C   )         direct-sum   direct-sum  A  B   C    direct-sum  A   direct-sum  B  C      (A\oplus B)\oplus C=A\oplus(B\oplus C)   .  It is distributive over set union   Grayscale dilation  In grayscale morphology, images are functions mapping a Euclidean space or grid  E into    ℝ  ∪   {  ∞  ,   -  ∞   }       ℝ           \mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}   , where   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is the set of reals ,   ∞     \infty   is an element larger than any real number, and    -  ∞         -\infty   is an element smaller than any real number.  Grayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called "structuring functions".  Denoting an image by f ( x ) and the structuring function by b ( x ), the grayscale dilation of f by b is given by           (   f  ⊕  b   )    (  x  )    =    sup   y  ∈  E     [    f   (  y  )    +   b   (   x  -  y   )     ]     ,         direct-sum  f  b   x     subscript  supremum    y  E     delimited-[]      f  y     b    x  y         (f\oplus b)(x)=\sup_{y\in E}[f(y)+b(x-y)],        where "sup" denotes the supremum .  Flat structuring functions  It is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions b ( x ) in the form         b   (  x  )    =   {      0  ,      x  ;  ∈  B  ,         -  ∞   ,      otherwise  ,              b  x    cases    0   fragments  x  normal-;   B  normal-,         otherwise       b(x)=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}0,&x\in B,\\
 -\infty,&\text{otherwise},\end{array}\right.        where    B  ⊆  E      B  E    B\subseteq E   .  In this case, the dilation is greatly simplified, and given by           (   f  ⊕  b   )    (  x  )    =    sup   y  ∈  E     [    f   (  y  )    +   b   (   x  -  y   )     ]    =    sup   z  ∈  E     [    f   (   x  -  z   )    +   b   (  z  )     ]    =    sup   z  ∈  B     [   f   (   x  -  z   )    ]     .           direct-sum  f  b   x     subscript  supremum    y  E     delimited-[]      f  y     b    x  y              subscript  supremum    z  E     delimited-[]      f    x  z      b  z             subscript  supremum    z  B     delimited-[]    f    x  z         (f\oplus b)(x)=\sup_{y\in E}[f(y)+b(x-y)]=\sup_{z\in E}[f(x-z)+b(z)]=\sup_{z%
 \in B}[f(x-z)].        (Suppose x = ( px , qx ), z = ( pz , qz ), then x − z = ( px − pz , qx − qz ).)  In the bounded, discrete case ( E is a grid and B is bounded), the supremum operator can be replaced by the maximum . Thus, dilation is a particular case of order statistics filters, returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support B ).  Dilation on complete lattices  Complete lattices are partially ordered sets , where every subset has an infimum and a supremum . In particular, it contains a least element and a greatest element (also denoted "universe").  Let    (  L  ,  ≤  )     L     (L,\leq)   be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by   ∧     \wedge   and   ∨     \vee   , respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by U and   ∅     \varnothing   , respectively. Moreover, let    {   X  i   }      subscript  X  i     \{X_{i}\}   be a collection of elements from L .  A dilation is any operator    δ  :   L  →  L      normal-:  δ   normal-→  L  L     \delta:L\rightarrow L   that distributes over the supremum, and preserves the least element. I.e.:          ⋁  i    δ   (   X  i   )     =   δ   (    ⋁  i    X  i    )     ,        subscript   i     δ   subscript  X  i       δ    subscript   i    subscript  X  i       \bigvee_{i}\delta(X_{i})=\delta\left(\bigvee_{i}X_{i}\right),           δ   (  ∅  )    =  ∅   .        δ       \delta(\varnothing)=\varnothing.
