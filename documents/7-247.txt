   ISO 31-5      ISO 31-5   ISO 31-5 is the part of international standard  ISO 31 that defines names and symbols for quantities and units related to electricity and magnetism . It is superseded by ISO 80000-6 .  Some of its definitions are below, with values taken from NIST values of the constants :      Name   Symbol   Definition   Value       Speed of light in vacuum   c 0   299 792 458 m s −1   299 792 458 m s −1     Magnetic constant   μ 0   4π × 10 −7 N A −2   12.566 370 614... x 10 −7 N A −2     Electric constant   ε 0          1    μ  0    c  0    2             1     subscript  μ  0    superscript   subscript  c  0   2        \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{\mu_{0}{c_{0}}^{2}}\end{matrix}      8.854 187 817... x 10 −12 F m −1     Characteristic impedance of vacuum   Z 0   μ 0  c 0   376.730 313 461...Ω     "  #00031-05
