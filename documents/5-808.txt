   Palladium-hydrogen electrode      Palladium-hydrogen electrode   The palladium-hydrogen electrode (abbreviation: Pd/H 2 ) is one of the common reference electrodes used in electrochemical study . 1 Most of its characteristics are similar to the standard hydrogen electrode (with platinum ). But palladium has one significant feature—the capability to absorb (dissolve into itself) molecular hydrogen . 2 3  Electrode operation  Two phases can coexist in palladium when hydrogen is absorbed:   alpha-phase at hydrogen concentration less than 0.025 atoms per atom of palladium  beta-phase at hydrogen concentration corresponding to the non-stoichiometric formula PdH 0.6   The electrochemical behaviour of a palladium electrode in equilibrium with H 3 O + ions in solution parallels the behaviour of palladium with molecular hydrogen         1  2     H  2    =   H   a  d  s    =   H   a  b  s              1  2    subscript  normal-H  2     subscript  normal-H    a  d  s          subscript  normal-H    a  b  s       \tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{H}_{2}=\mathrm{H}_{ads}=\mathrm{H}_{abs}     Thus the equilibrium is controlled in one case by the partial pressure or fugacity of molecular hydrogen and in other case—by activity of H + -ions in solution.

 {1/2}}     When palladium is electrochemically charged by hydrogen, the existence of two phases is manifested by a constant potential of approximately +50 mV compared to the reversible hydrogen electrode . This potential is independent of the amount of hydrogen absorbed over a wide range. This property has been utilized in the construction of a palladium/hydrogen reference electrode . The main feature of such electrode is an absence of non-stop bubbling of molecular hydrogen through the solution as it is absolutely necessary for the standard hydrogen electrode .
