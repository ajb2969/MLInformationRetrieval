   Primorial      Primorial     In mathematics , and more particularly in number theory , primorial is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers similar to the factorial function, but rather than successively multiplying positive integers, only prime numbers are multiplied.  There are two conflicting definitions that differ in the interpretation of the argument: the first interprets the argument as an index into the sequence of prime numbers (so that the function is strictly increasing ), while the second interprets the argument as a bound on the prime numbers to be multiplied (so that the function value at any composite number is the same as at its predecessor). The rest of this article uses the latter interpretation.  The name "primorial", attributed to Harvey Dubner , draws an analogy to primes the same way the name "factorial" relates to factors .  Definition for Primorial numbers  For the n th prime number p n the primorial p n # is defined as the product of the first n primes: 1 2        p  n   #   =    ∏   k  =  1   n    p  k           subscript  p  n   normal-#     superscript   subscript  product    k  1    n    subscript  p  k      p_{n}\#=\prod_{k=1}^{n}p_{k}     where p k is the k th prime number.  For instance, p 5 # signifies the product of the first 5 primes:        p  5   #   =   2  ×  3  ×  5  ×  7  ×  11   =  2310.           subscript  p  5   normal-#     2  3  5  7  11        2310.     p_{5}\#=2\times 3\times 5\times 7\times 11=2310.     The first six primorials p n # are:   1 , 2 , 6 , 30 , 210 , 2310.   The sequence also includes p 0 # = 1 as empty product .  Asymptotically, primorials p n # grow according to:         p  n   #   =   e    (   1  +   o   (  1  )     )   n   log  n      ,         subscript  p  n   normal-#    superscript  e      1    o  1    n    n       p_{n}\#=e^{(1+o(1))n\log n},     where    o   (  ⋅  )       o  normal-⋅    o(\cdot)   is the little-o notation . 3  Definition for natural numbers  In general, for a positive integer n such a primorial n# can also be defined, namely as the product of those primes ≤ n : 4 5       n  #   =    ∏   i  =  1    π   (  n  )      p  i    =    p   π   (  n  )     #           n  normal-#     superscript   subscript  product    i  1      π  n     subscript  p  i            subscript  p    π  n    normal-#      n\#=\prod_{i=1}^{\pi(n)}p_{i}=p_{\pi(n)}\#     where,    π   (  n  )       π  n    \scriptstyle\pi(n)   is the prime-counting function , giving the number of primes ≤ n .  This is equivalent to:       n  #   =   {     1      if  n   =  1        n  ×   (    (   n  -  1   )   #   )        if  n   >    1   &   n  is prime           (   n  -  1   )   #        if  n   >    1   &   n  is composite     .             n  normal-#    cases  1      if  n   1     n      n  1   normal-#        if  n     1    n  is prime         n  1   normal-#       if  n     1    n  is composite        n\#=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }n=1\\
 n\times((n-1)\#)&\text{if }n>1\ \And\ n\text{ is prime}\\
 (n-1)\#&\text{if }n>1\ \And\ n\text{ is composite}.\end{cases}     For example, 12# represents the product of those primes ≤ 12:       12  #   =   2  ×  3  ×  5  ×  7  ×  11   =  2310.          12  normal-#     2  3  5  7  11        2310.     12\#=2\times 3\times 5\times 7\times 11=2310.     Since     π   (  12  )    =  5        π  12   5    \scriptstyle\pi(12)=5   , this can be calculated as:       12  #   =    p   π   (  12  )     #   =    p  5   #   =  2310.          12  normal-#      subscript  p    π  12    normal-#           subscript  p  5   normal-#        2310.     12\#=p_{\pi(12)}\#=p_{5}\#=2310.     Consider the first 12 primorials n #:   1, 2, 6, 6, 30, 30, 210, 210, 210, 210, 2310, 2310.   We see that for composite n every term n# simply duplicates the preceding term ( n − 1)#, as given in the definition. In the above example we have that 12# = p 5 # = 11#, since 12 is a composite number.  The natural logarithm of n # is the first Chebyshev function , written    θ   (  n  )       θ  n    \theta(n)   or     \thetasym    (  n  )       \thetasym  n    \thetasym(n)   , which approaches the linear n for large n . 6  Primorials n # grow according to:        ln   (   n  #   )    ∼  n   .     similar-to      n  normal-#    n    \ln(n\#)\sim n.     The idea of multiplying all known primes occurs in some proofs of the infinitude of the prime numbers , where it is used to derive the existence of another prime.  Applications and properties  Primorials play a role in the search for prime numbers in additive arithmetic progressions . For instance, 2236133941 + 23# results in a prime, beginning a sequence of thirteen primes found by repeatedly adding 23#, and ending with 5136341251. 23# is also the common difference in arithmetic progressions of fifteen and sixteen primes.  Every highly composite number is a product of primorials (e.g. 360 = 2·6·30). 7  Primorials are all square-free integers , and each one has more distinct prime factors than any number smaller than it. For each primorial n , the fraction     ϕ   (  n  )    /  n        ϕ  n   n    \phi(n)/n   is smaller than for any lesser integer, where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the Euler totient function .  Any completely multiplicative function is defined by its values at primorials, since it is defined by its values at primes, which can be recovered by division of adjacent values.  Base systems corresponding to primorials (such as base 30, not to be confused with the primorial number system ) have a lower proportion of repeating fractions than any smaller base.  Every primorial is a sparsely totient number . 8  Appearance  The Riemann zeta function at positive integers greater than one can be expressed 9 by using the primorial and the     J  k    (  n  )        subscript  J  k   n    J_{k}(n)    Jordan's totient function :        ζ   (  k  )    =     2  k     2  k   -  1    +    ∑   r  =  2   ∞      (    p   r  -  1    #   )   k     J  k    (    p  r   #   )        ,   k  =   2  ,  3  ,  …       formulae-sequence      ζ  k        superscript  2  k      superscript  2  k   1      superscript   subscript     r  2         superscript     subscript  p    r  1    normal-#   k      subscript  J  k      subscript  p  r   normal-#          k   2  3  normal-…      \zeta(k)=\frac{2^{k}}{2^{k}-1}+\sum_{r=2}^{\infty}\frac{(p_{r-1}\#)^{k}}{J_{k}%
