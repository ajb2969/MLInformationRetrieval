   Thomas Banchoff      Thomas Banchoff    Thomas Francis Banchoff (born 1938) is an American  mathematician specializing in geometry . He is a professor at Brown University , where he has taught since 1967. He is known for his research in differential geometry in three and four dimensions, for his efforts to develop methods of computer graphics in the early 1990s, and most recently for his pioneering work in methods of undergraduate education utilizing online resources.  Banchoff attended the University of Notre Dame and received his Ph.D from UC Berkeley in 1964, where he was a student of Shiing-Shen Chern . 1 Before going to Brown he taught at Harvard University and the University of Amsterdam . In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 2 He was a president of the Mathematical Association of America . 3  Selected works   with Stephen Lovett: Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, A.
