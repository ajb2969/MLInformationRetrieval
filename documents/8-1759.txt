   Polyphase matrix      Polyphase matrix   In signal processing , a polyphase matrix is a matrix whose elements are filter masks . It represents a filter bank as it is used in sub-band coders alias discrete wavelet transforms . 1  If    h  ,  g     h  g    \scriptstyle h,\,g   are two filters, then one level the traditional wavelet transform maps an input signal    a  0     subscript  a  0    \scriptstyle a_{0}   to two output signals     a  1   ,   d  1       subscript  a  1    subscript  d  1     \scriptstyle a_{1},\,d_{1}   , each of the half length:      a  1     subscript  a  1    \displaystyle a_{1}     Note, that the dot means polynomial multiplication ; i.e., convolution and   ↓   normal-↓   \scriptstyle\downarrow   means downsampling .  If the above formula is implemented directly, you will compute values that are subsequently flushed by the down-sampling. You can avoid that by splitting the filters and the signal into even and odd indexed values before the transformation.         h  e     =     h  ↓  2       a   0  ,  e      =      a  0   ↓  2        h  o     =      (  h  ←  1  )   ↓  2       a   0  ,  o      =      (   a  0   ←  1  )   ↓  2          subscript  h  e     normal-↓  h  2    missing-subexpression    subscript  a   0  e      normal-↓   subscript  a  0   2      subscript  h  o     fragments   fragments  normal-(  h  normal-←  1  normal-)   normal-↓  2    missing-subexpression    subscript  a   0  o      fragments   fragments  normal-(   subscript  a  0   normal-←  1  normal-)   normal-↓  2      \begin{array}[]{rclcrcl}h_{\mbox{e}}&=&h\downarrow 2&&a_{0,\mbox{e}}&=&a_{0}%
 \downarrow 2\\
 h_{\mbox{o}}&=&(h\leftarrow 1)\downarrow 2&&a_{0,\mbox{o}}&=&(a_{0}\leftarrow 1%
 )\downarrow 2\end{array}     The arrows   ←   normal-←   \scriptstyle\leftarrow   and   →   normal-→   \scriptstyle\rightarrow   denote left and right shifting, respectively. They shall have the same precedence like convolution, because they are in fact convolutions with a shifted discrete delta impulse .      δ  =   (  …  ,  0  ,  0  ,   1   0  -  th position    ,  0  ,  0  ,  …  )       δ   normal-…  0  0     0  th position   1   0  0  normal-…     \delta=(\dots,0,0,\underset{0-\mbox{th position}}{1},0,0,\dots)     The wavelet transformation reformulated to the split filters is:      a  1     subscript  a  1    \displaystyle a_{1}     This can be written as matrix-vector-multiplication     P   P   \displaystyle P     This matrix   P   P   \scriptstyle P   is the polyphase matrix.  Of course, a polyphase matrix can have any size, it need not to have square shape. That is, the principle scales well to any filterbanks , multiwavelets , wavelet transforms based on fractional refinements .  Properties  The representation of sub-band coding by the polyphase matrix is more than about write simplification. It allows the adaptation of many results from matrix theory and module theory . The following properties are explained for a     2   ×  2      2  2    \scriptstyle 2\,\times\,2   matrix, but they scale equally to higher dimensions.  Invertibility/perfect reconstruction  The case that a polyphase matrix allows reconstruction of a processed signal from the filtered data, is called perfect reconstruction property. Mathematically this is equivalent to invertibility. According to the theorem of invertibility of a matrix over a ring, the polyphase matrix is invertible if and only if the determinant of the polyphase matrix is a Kronecker delta , which is zero everywhere except for one value.      det  P      P    \displaystyle\det P     By Cramer's rule the inverse of   P   P   \scriptstyle P   can be given immediately.        P   -  1    ⋅   det  P    =   (       g  o   →  1       -   h  o    →  1        -   g  e       h  e      )        normal-⋅   superscript  P    1      P       normal-→   subscript  g  o   1    normal-→     subscript  h  o    1        subscript  g  e     subscript  h  e       P^{-1}\cdot\det P=\begin{pmatrix}g_{\mbox{o}}\rightarrow 1&-h_{\mbox{o}}%
 \rightarrow 1\\
 -g_{\mbox{e}}&h_{\mbox{e}}\end{pmatrix}     Orthogonality  Orthogonality means that the adjoint matrix     P  *     superscript  P     \scriptstyle P^{*}   is also the inverse matrix of   P   P   \scriptstyle P   . The adjoint matrix is the transposed matrix with adjoint filters .       P  *   =   (      h  e  *      g  e  *         h  o  *   ←  1       g  o  *   ←  1      )        superscript  P       superscript   subscript  h  e      superscript   subscript  g  e        normal-←   superscript   subscript  h  o     1    normal-←   superscript   subscript  g  o     1       P^{*}=\begin{pmatrix}h_{\mbox{e}}^{*}&g_{\mbox{e}}^{*}\\
 h_{\mbox{o}}^{*}\leftarrow 1&g_{\mbox{o}}^{*}\leftarrow 1\end{pmatrix}     It implies, that the Euclidean norm of the input signals is preserved. That is, the according wavelet transform is an isometry .         ||   a  1   ||   2  2   +    ||   d  1   ||   2  2    =    ||   a  0   ||   2  2          superscript   subscript   norm   subscript  a  1    2   2    superscript   subscript   norm   subscript  d  1    2   2     superscript   subscript   norm   subscript  a  0    2   2     ||a_{1}||_{2}^{2}+||d_{1}||_{2}^{2}=||a_{0}||_{2}^{2}     The orthogonality condition       P  ⋅   P  *    =  I       normal-⋅  P   superscript  P     I    P\cdot P^{*}=I     can be written out        h  e  *   ⋅   h  e    +    h  o  *   ⋅   h  o         normal-⋅   superscript   subscript  h  e      subscript  h  e     normal-⋅   superscript   subscript  h  o      subscript  h  o      \displaystyle h_{\mbox{e}}^{*}\cdot h_{\mbox{e}}+h_{\mbox{o}}^{*}\cdot h_{%
 \mbox{o}}     Operator norm  For non-orthogonal polyphase matrices the question arises what Euclidean norms the output can assume. This can be bounded by the help of the operator norm .       ∀    x     ∥   P  ⋅  x   ∥   2     ∈   [     ∥   P   -  1    ∥   2   -  1    ⋅    ∥  x  ∥   2    ,     ∥  P  ∥   2   ⋅    ∥  x  ∥   2    ]        for-all    x   subscript   norm   normal-⋅  P  x    2       normal-⋅   superscript   subscript   norm   superscript  P    1     2     1     subscript   norm  x   2     normal-⋅   subscript   norm  P   2    subscript   norm  x   2       \forall x\ \|P\cdot x\|_{2}\in\left[\|P^{-1}\|_{2}^{-1}\cdot\|x\|_{2},\|P\|_{2%
 }\cdot\|x\|_{2}\right]     For the     2   ×  2      2  2    \scriptstyle 2\,\times\,2   polyphase matrix the Euclidean operator norm can be given explicitly using the Frobenius norm     ∥  ⋅   ∥  F      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  F     \scriptstyle\|\cdot\|_{F}   and the z transform    Z   Z   \scriptstyle Z   : 2      p   (  z  )       p  z    \displaystyle p(z)     This is a special case of the    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrix where the operator norm can be obtained via z transform and the spectral radius of a matrix or the according spectral norm .       ∥  P  ∥   2     subscript   norm  P   2    \displaystyle\|P\|_{2}     A signal, where these bounds are assumed can be derived from the eigenvector corresponding to the maximizing and minimizing eigenvalue.  Lifting scheme  The concept of the polyphase matrix allows matrix decomposition . For instance the decomposition into addition matrices leads to the lifting scheme . 3 However, classical matrix decompositions like LU and QR decomposition cannot be applied immediately, because the filters form a ring with respect to convolution, not a field .
