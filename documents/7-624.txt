   Nilmanifold      Nilmanifold   In mathematics , a nilmanifold is a differentiable manifold which has a transitive nilpotent group of diffeomorphisms acting on it. As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a homogeneous space and is diffeomorphic to the quotient space     N  /  H      N  H    N/H   , the quotient of a nilpotent Lie group  N modulo a closed  subgroup  H . This notion was introduced by A. Mal'cev in 1951.  In the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold. A Riemannian manifold is called a homogeneous nilmanifold if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it. The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson 1 ).  Nilmanifolds are important geometric objects and often arise as concrete examples with interesting properties; in Riemannian geometry these spaces always have mixed curvature, 2  almost flat spaces arise as quotients of nilmanifolds, 3 and compact nilmanifolds have been used to construct elementary examples of collapse of Riemannian metrics under the Ricci flow. 4  In addition to their role in geometry, nilmanifolds are increasingly being seen as having a role in arithmetic combinatorics (see Green–Tao 5 ) and ergodic theory (see, e.g., Host–Kra 6 ).  Compact nilmanifolds  A compact nilmanifold is a nilmanifold which is compact. One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N and a discrete subgroup    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   . If the subgroup   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on N , then the quotient manifold    N  /  Γ      N  normal-Γ    N/\Gamma   will be a compact nilmanifold. As Mal'cev has shown, every compact nilmanifold is obtained this way. 7  Such a subgroup   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   as above is called a lattice in N . It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational structure constants : this is Malcev's criterion . Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also Raghunathan. 8  A compact Riemannian nilmanifold is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric. These spaces are constructed as follows. Let   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group N , as above. Endow N with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric. Then the subgroup   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   acts by isometries on N via left-multiplication. Thus the quotient    Γ  \  N     normal-\  normal-Γ  N    \Gamma\backslash N   is a compact space locally isometric to N . Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to    N  /  Γ      N  normal-Γ    N/\Gamma   .  Compact nilmanifolds also arise as principal bundles . For example, consider a 2-step nilpotent Lie group  N which admits a lattice (see above). Let    Z  =   [  N  ,  N  ]       Z   N  N     Z=[N,N]   be the commutator subgroup of N . Denote by p the dimension of Z and by q the codimension of Z ; i.e. the dimension of N is p+q. It is known (see Raghunathan) that    Z  ∩  Γ      Z  normal-Γ    Z\cap\Gamma   is a lattice in Z . Hence,    G  =   Z  /   (   Z  ∩  Γ   )        G    Z    Z  normal-Γ      G=Z/(Z\cap\Gamma)   is a p -dimensional compact torus. Since Z is central in N , the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold    P  =   N  /  Γ       P    N  normal-Γ     P=N/\Gamma   with quotient space    M  =   P  /  G       M    P  G     M=P/G   . This base manifold M is a q -dimensional compact torus. It has been shown that ever principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see. 9 More generally, a compact nilmanifold is torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus.  As mentioned above, almost flat manifolds are intimately compact nilmanifolds. See that article for more information.  Complex nilmanifolds  Historically, a complex nilmanifold meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over a cocompact lattice . An example of such a nilmanifold is an Iwasawa manifold . From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one.  An almost complex structure on a real Lie algebra g is an endomorphism    I  :   g  →  g      normal-:  I   normal-→  g  g     I:\;g\rightarrow g   which squares to −Id g . This operator is called a complex structure if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues    ±    -  1       plus-or-minus      1      \pm\sqrt{-1}   , are subalgebras in    g  ⊗  ℂ     tensor-product  g  ℂ    g\otimes{\mathbb{C}}   . In this case, I defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold ( G , I ) is called a complex group manifold . It is easy to see that every connected complex homogeneous manifold equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way.  Let G be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A complex nilmanifold is a quotient of a complex group manifold ( G , I ), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right.  Complex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties.  In complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a Kodaira surface . 10  Properties  Compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never homotopy formal . 11 This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot admit a Kähler structure (see also 12 ).  Topologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained as iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by ascending central series . 13  Examples  Nilpotent Lie groups  From the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold. The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros.  For example, the Heisenberg group is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group. This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient. The group   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients. The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional. One possible fundamental domain is (isomorphic to) [0,1] 3 with the faces identified in a suitable way. This is because an element     (     1    x    z         1    y            1     )   Γ        1  x  z    absent  1  y    absent  absent  1    normal-Γ    \begin{pmatrix}1&x&z\\
 &1&y\\
 &&1\end{pmatrix}\Gamma   of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element    (     1     {  x  }      {   z  -   x   ⌊  y  ⌋     }          1     {  y  }             1     )      1   x      z    x    y        absent  1   y     absent  absent  1     \begin{pmatrix}1&\{x\}&\{z-x\lfloor y\rfloor\}\\
 &1&\{y\}\\
 &&1\end{pmatrix}   in the fundamental domain. Here    ⌊  x  ⌋      x    \lfloor x\rfloor   denotes the floor function of x , and    {  x  }     x    \{x\}   the fractional part . The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher-order Fourier analysis. 14  Abelian Lie groups  A simpler example would be any abelian Lie group. This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group. For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers. The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle    ℝ  /  ℤ      ℝ  ℤ    \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}   . Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.  Generalizations  A parallel construction based on solvable Lie groups produces a class of spaces called solvmanifolds . An important example of a solvmanifolds are Inoue surfaces , known in complex geometry .  References    "  Category:Homogeneous spaces  Category:Smooth manifolds  Category:Lie groups     E.
