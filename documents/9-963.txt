   Algebraic character      Algebraic character   Algebraic character is a formal expression attached to a module in representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras that generalizes the character of a finite-dimensional representation and is analogous to the Harish-Chandra character of the representations of semisimple Lie groups .  Definition  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a semisimple Lie algebra with a fixed Cartan subalgebra     𝔥  ,    𝔥   \mathfrak{h},   and let the abelian group    A  =   ℤ   [   [   𝔥  *   ]   ]        A    ℤ   delimited-[]   delimited-[]   superscript  𝔥         A=\mathbb{Z}[[\mathfrak{h}^{*}]]   consist of the (possibly infinite) formal integral linear combinations of    e  μ     superscript  e  μ    e^{\mu}   , where    μ  ∈   𝔥  *       μ   superscript  𝔥      \mu\in\mathfrak{h}^{*}   , the (complex) vector space of weights. Suppose that   V   V   V   is a locally-finite weight module . Then the algebraic character of   V   V   V   is an element of   A   A   A   defined by the formula:        c  h   (  V  )    =    ∑  μ    dim    V  μ    e  μ       ,        c  h  V     subscript   μ    dimension     subscript  V  μ    superscript  e  μ        ch(V)=\sum_{\mu}\dim V_{\mu}e^{\mu},   where the sum is taken over all weight spaces of the module    V  .    V   V.     Example  The algebraic character of the Verma module     M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   with the highest weight   λ   λ   \lambda   is given by the formula        c  h   (   M  λ   )    =    e  λ     ∏   α  >  0     (   1  -   e   -  α     )      ,        c  h   subscript  M  λ       superscript  e  λ     subscript  product    α  0      1   superscript  e    α         ch(M_{\lambda})=\frac{e^{\lambda}}{\prod_{\alpha>0}(1-e^{-\alpha})},     with the product taken over the set of positive roots.  Properties  Algebraic characters are defined for locally-finite weight modules and are additive , i.e. the character of a direct sum of modules is the sum of their characters. On the other hand, although one can define multiplication of the formal exponents by the formula      e  μ   ⋅   e  ν    =   e   μ  +  ν         normal-⋅   superscript  e  μ    superscript  e  ν     superscript  e    μ  ν      e^{\mu}\cdot e^{\nu}=e^{\mu+\nu}   and extend it to their finite linear combinations by linearity, this does not make   A   A   A   into a ring, because of the possibility of formal infinite sums. Thus the product of algebraic characters is well defined only in restricted situations; for example, for the case of a highest weight module , or a finite-dimensional module. In good situations, the algebraic character is multiplicative , i.e., the character of the tensor product of two weight modules is the product of their characters.  Generalization  Characters also can be defined almost verbatim for weight modules over a Kac–Moody or generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra.
