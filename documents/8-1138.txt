Pointwise mutual information

Pointwise mutual information (PMI),1 or point mutual information, is a measure of association used in information theory and statistics. In contrast to mutual information (MI) which builds upon PMI, it refers to single events, whereas MI refers to the average of all possible events.
Definition
The PMI of a pair of outcomes x and y belonging to discrete random variables X and Y quantifies the discrepancy between the probability of their coincidence given their joint distribution and their individual distributions, assuming independence. Mathematically:



The mutual information (MI) of the random variables X and Y is the expected value of the PMI over all possible outcomes (with respect to the joint distribution 
 
 
 
 ).
The measure is symmetric (
 
 
 
 ). It can take positive or negative values, but is zero if X and Y are independent. Note that even though PMI may be negative or positive, its expected outcome over all joint events (MI) is positive. PMI maximizes when X and Y are perfectly associated (i.e. 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ), yielding the following bounds:



Finally, 
 
 
 
  will increase if 
 
 
 
  is fixed but 
 
 
 
 decreases.
Here is an example to illustrate:

Using this table we can marginalize to get the following additional table for the individual distributions:





p(x)

p(y)

0.8

0.25

0.2

0.75



With this example, we can compute four values for 
 
 
 
 . Using base-2 logarithms:




pmi(x=0;y=0)

=

−1



pmi(x=0;y=1)

=

0.222392421



pmi(x=1;y=0)

=

1.584962501



pmi(x=1;y=1)

=

−1.584962501





(For reference, the mutual information

 
  would then be 0.214170945)
Similarities to mutual information
Pointwise Mutual Information has many of the same relationships as the mutual information. In particular,



Where 
 
 
 
  is the self-information, or 
 
 
 
 .
Normalized pointwise mutual information (npmi)
Pointwise mutual information can be normalized between [-1,+1] resulting in -1 (in the limit) for never occurring together, 0 for independence, and +1 for complete co-occurrence.2


Chain-rule for pmi
Like MI,3 PMI follows the chain rule, that is,



This is easily proven by:
