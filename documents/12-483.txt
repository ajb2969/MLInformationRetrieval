   Aerodynamic potential-flow code      Aerodynamic potential-flow code   In fluid dynamics , aerodynamic potential flow codes or panel codes are used to determine the fluid velocity, and subsequently the pressure distribution, on an object. This may be a simple two-dimensional object, such as a circle or wing, or it may be a three-dimensional vehicle.  A series of singularities as sources, sinks, vortex points and doublets are used to model the panels and wakes. These codes may be valid at subsonic and supersonic speeds.  History  Early panel codes were developed in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Advanced panel codes, such as Panair (developed by Boeing), were first introduced in the late 1970s, and gained popularity as computing speed increased. Over time, panel codes were replaced with higher order panel methods and subsequently CFD ( Computational Fluid Dynamics ). However, panel codes are still used for preliminary aerodynamic analysis as the time required for an analysis run is significantly less due to a decreased number of elements.  Assumptions  These are the various assumptions that go into developing potential flow panel methods:   Inviscid  Incompressible     ∇  ⋅  V   =  0       normal-⋅  normal-∇  V   0    \nabla\cdot V=0     Irrotational     ∇  ×  V   =  0        normal-∇  V   0    \nabla\times V=0     Steady     ∂   ∂  t    =  0           t    0    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}=0      However, the incompressible flow assumption may be removed from the potential flow derivation leaving:   Potential Flow (inviscid, irrotational, steady)      ∇  2   ϕ   =  0        superscript  normal-∇  2   ϕ   0    \nabla^{2}\phi=0      Derivation of panel method solution to potential flow problem   From Small Disturbances          (   1  -   M  ∞  2    )    ϕ   x  x     +   ϕ   y  y    +   ϕ   z  z     =  0            1   superscript   subscript  M    2     subscript  ϕ    x  x      subscript  ϕ    y  y     subscript  ϕ    z  z     0    (1-M_{\infty}^{2})\phi_{xx}+\phi_{yy}+\phi_{zz}=0   (subsonic)   From Divergence Theorem         ∭  V     (   ∇  ⋅  𝐅   )   d  V    =    ∬  S     𝐅  ⋅   𝐧    d  S          subscript  triple-integral  V      normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐅   d  V      subscript  double-integral  S      normal-⋅  𝐅  𝐧   d  S      \iiint\limits_{V}\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}\right)dV=\iint\limits_{S}\mathbf{%

 \right)dS_{Q}     This equation can be broken down into both a source term and a doublet term.  The Source Strength at an arbitrary point Q is:      σ  =    ∇  𝐧    (    ∇   ϕ  U    -   ∇   ϕ  L     )        σ     normal-∇  𝐧      normal-∇   subscript  ϕ  U     normal-∇   subscript  ϕ  L        \sigma=\nabla\mathbf{n}(\nabla\phi_{U}-\nabla\phi_{L})     The Doublet Strength at an arbitrary point Q is:      μ  =    ϕ  U   -   ϕ  L        μ     subscript  ϕ  U    subscript  ϕ  L      \mu=\phi_{U}-\phi_{L}     The simplified potential flow equation is:       ϕ  p   =   -    1   4  π      ∬  S     (    σ  R   -   μ  ⋅  𝐧  ⋅   ∇   1  R      )   d  S           subscript  ϕ  p         1    4  π      subscript  double-integral  S         σ  R    normal-⋅  μ  𝐧   normal-∇    1  R      d  S        \phi_{p}=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\iint\limits_{S}\left(\frac{\sigma}{R}-\mu\cdot\mathbf%
 {n}\cdot\nabla\frac{1}{R}\right)dS     With this equation, along with applicable boundary conditions, the potential flow problem may be solved.  Required boundary conditions  The velocity potential on the internal surface and all points inside V (or on the lower surface S) is 0.       ϕ  L   =  0       subscript  ϕ  L   0    \phi_{L}=0     The Doublet Strength is:      μ  =    ϕ  U   -   ϕ  L        μ     subscript  ϕ  U    subscript  ϕ  L      \mu=\phi_{U}-\phi_{L}         μ  =   ϕ  U       μ   subscript  ϕ  U     \mu=\phi_{U}     The velocity potential on the outer surface is normal to the surface and is equal to the freestream velocity.       ϕ  U   =   -    V  ∞   ⋅  𝐧         subscript  ϕ  U      normal-⋅   subscript  V    𝐧      \phi_{U}=-V_{\infty}\cdot\mathbf{n}     These basic equations are satisfied when the geometry is a 'watertight' geometry. If it is watertight, it is a well-posed problem. If it is not, it is an ill-posed problem.  Discretization of Potential Flow Equation  The potential flow equation with well-posed boundary conditions applied is:       μ  P   =     1   4  π      ∬  S     (     V  ∞   ⋅  𝐧   R   )   d   S  U      +    1   4  π      ∬  S     (   μ  ⋅  𝐧  ⋅   ∇   1  R     )   d  S           subscript  μ  P         1    4  π      subscript  double-integral  S        normal-⋅   subscript  V    𝐧   R   d   subscript  S  U          1    4  π      subscript  double-integral  S      normal-⋅  μ  𝐧   normal-∇    1  R     d  S        \mu_{P}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\iint\limits_{S}\left(\frac{V_{\infty}\cdot\mathbf{n}}{R%

 \nabla\frac{1}{R}\right)dS      Note that the    d   S  U       d   subscript  S  U     dS_{U}   integration term is evaluated only on the upper surface, while th    d  S      d  S    dS   integral term is evaluated on the upper and lower surfaces.   The continuous surface S may now be discretized into discrete panels. These panels will approximate the shape of the actual surface. This value of the various source and doublet terms may be evaluated at a convenient point (such as the centroid of the panel). Some assumed distribution of the source and doublet strengths (typically constant or linear) are used at points other than the centroid. A single source term s of unknown strength   λ   λ   \lambda   and a single doublet term m of unknown strength   λ   λ   \lambda   are defined at a given point.       σ  Q   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     λ  i    s  i    (  Q  )     =  0         subscript  σ  Q     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  λ  i    subscript  s  i   Q         0     \sigma_{Q}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}s_{i}(Q)=0          μ  Q   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     λ  i    m  i    (  Q  )          subscript  μ  Q     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  λ  i    subscript  m  i   Q      \mu_{Q}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}m_{i}(Q)     where:       s  i   =   l  n   (  r  )         subscript  s  i     l  n  r     s_{i}=ln(r)          m  i   =        subscript  m  i   absent    m_{i}=     These terms can be used to create a system of linear equations which can be solved for all the unknown values of   λ   λ   \lambda   .  Methods for Discretizing Panels   constant strength - simple, large number of panels required  linear varying strength - reasonable answer, little difficulty in creating well-posed problems  quadratic varying strength - accurate, more difficult to create a well-posed problem   Some techniques are commonly used to model surfaces. 1   Body Thickness by line sources  Body Lift by line doublets  Wing Thickness by constant source panels  Wing Lift by constant pressure panels  Wing-Body Interface by constant pressure panels   Methods of determining pressure  Once the Velocity at every point is determined, the pressure can be determined by using one of the following formulas. All various Pressure coefficient methods produce results that are similar and are commonly used to identify regions where the results are invalid.  Pressure Coefficient is defined as:       C  p   =    p  -   p  ∞     q  ∞    =    p  -   p  ∞      1  2    ρ  ∞    V  ∞  2     =    p  -   p  ∞      γ  2    p  ∞    M  ∞  2            subscript  C  p       p   subscript  p      subscript  q              p   subscript  p         1  2    subscript  ρ     superscript   subscript  V    2              p   subscript  p         γ  2    subscript  p     superscript   subscript  M    2        C_{p}=\frac{p-p_{\infty}}{q_{\infty}}=\frac{p-p_{\infty}}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{%

You will not capture viscous effects except via user "modeling" by changing the geometry.
