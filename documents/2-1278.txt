List of integrals of exponential functions

The following is a list of integrals of exponential functions. For a complete list of Integral functions, please see the list of integrals.
Indefinite integral
Indefinite integrals are antiderivative functions. A constant (the constant of integration) may be added to the right hand side of any of these formulas, but has been suppressed here in the interest of brevity.
Integrals involving only exponential functions
