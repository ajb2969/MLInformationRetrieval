   Homoisocitrate dehydrogenase      Homoisocitrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a homoisocitrate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoadipate + CO 2 + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate and NAD + , whereas its 4 products are 2-oxoadipate , CO 2 , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1R,2S)-1-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate:NAD + oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include 2-hydroxy-3-carboxyadipate dehydrogenase , 3-carboxy-2-hydroxyadipate dehydrogenase , homoisocitric dehydrogenase , (−)-1-hydroxy-1,2,4-butanetricarboxylate:NAD + oxidoreductase , (decarboxylating) , 3-carboxy-2-hydroxyadipate:NAD + oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) , and HICDH . This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
