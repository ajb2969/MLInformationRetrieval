Trans-L-3-hydroxyproline dehydratase




Trans-L-3-hydroxyproline dehydratase

In enzymology, a trans-L-3-hydroxyproline dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

trans-L-3-hydroxyproline 
 
 
 
  Delta1-pyrroline 2-carboxylate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, trans-L-3-hydroxyproline, and two products, Delta1-pyrroline 2-carboxylate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans-L-3-hydroxyproline hydro-lyase (Delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate-forming). This enzyme is also called trans-L-3-hydroxyproline hydro-lyase.
