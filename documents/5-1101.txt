   Topness      Topness   Topness (also called truth ), a flavour  quantum number , represents the difference between the number of top quarks (t) and number of top antiquarks (    t  ¯     normal-¯  t    \overline{t}   ) that are present in a particle:      T  =    n  t   -   n   t  ¯         T     subscript  n  t    subscript  n   normal-¯  t       T=n_{\text{t}}-n_{\bar{\text{t}}}     By convention, top quarks have a topness of +1 and top antiquarks have a topness of −1.The term "topness" is rarely used; most physicists simply refer to "the number of top quarks" and "the number of top antiquarks".  Conservation  Like all flavour quantum numbers , topness is preserved under strong and electromagnetic interactions , but not under weak interaction . However the top quark is extremely unstable, with a half-life under 10 −23 s, which is the required time for the strong interaction to take place. For that reason the top quark does not hadronize , that is it never forms any meson or baryon , so the topness of a meson or a baryon is every time equal at zero. By the time it can interact strongly it has already decayed to another flavour of quark (usually to a bottom quark ).
