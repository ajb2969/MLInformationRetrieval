Slow strain rate testing




Slow strain rate testing
'''Slow strain rate testing''' (SSRT), also called '''constant extension rate tensile testing''' (CERT), is a standardStandard ASTM G129-00 (2006), "Standard Practice for Slow Strain Rate Testing to Evaluate the Susceptibility of Metallic Materials to Environmentally Assisted Cracking", [[ASTM International]], 2006.Standard ISO 7539-7:2005, "Corrosion of metals and alloys -
 - Stress corrosion testing -- Part 7: Method for slow strain rate testing", International Organization for Standardization. method of testing of materials, often metals, in which the specimen is subjected to elongation at a constant rate. The load is varied to maintain the constant extension rate. While extended, the material is exposed to an environment (temperature, specific fluid, etc.). The method evaluates the corrosion behaviour of the material in the given environment, often the environmental effects on the material fracture or stress-corrosion cracking susceptibility.1
Effect of strain rate
The important characteristic of these tests is that the strain rate is low, for example extension rates selected in the range from 10−8 to 10−3 s−1. The selection of the strain rate is very important because the susceptibility to cracking may not be evident from result of tests at too low or too high strain rate.2 For numerous material-environment systems, strain rates in range 10−5 - 10−6 s−1 are used; however, the observed absence of cracking at a given strain rate should not be taken as a proof of immunity to cracking. There are known cases wherein the susceptibility to stress-corrosion cracking only became evident at strain rates as low as 10−8 or 10−9 s−1. The fastest strain rate that will still promote SCC for a given environment-material system is called "critical strain rate", some values are given in the table:3




Critical strain rates

Metal-environment system

Critical strain rate, s−1



Aluminium alloys - aqueous chloride solutions

10−4 to 10−7



Copper alloys - ammonia/nitrite solutions

10−6



Titanium alloys - chloride solutions

10−5



Steels - solutions of carbonates, hydroxides, or nitrates, or liquid ammonia

10−6



Magnesium alloys - chromate/chloride solutions

10−5



Stainless steel - chloride solutions

10−6



Stainless steel - high temperature water solutions

10−7



Nevertheless, the method is very suitable for mechanistic studies, as well as for relative ranking of susceptibility to cracking of different alloys, or aggressiveness of environments.4
The evaluation of the results
The evaluated parameters are:5

time to specimen failure (e.g., breakage, or from other "failure" criteria)
ductility (by elongation to fracture or the reduction of the area)
ultimate tensile strength (from the maximum load)
area under the elongation - load curve (which represents the fracture energy)
percent of ductile/brittle fracture on the fracture surface
threshold stress for cracking (e.g., by potential drop technique6).

The results of the SSRT tests are evaluated using the ratio:



The departure of the ratio below unity quantifies the increased susceptibility to cracking.
