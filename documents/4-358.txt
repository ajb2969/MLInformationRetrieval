   Structural rule      Structural rule   In proof theory , a structural rule is an inference rule that does not refer to any logical connective , but instead operates on the judgment or sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics .  Common structural rules  Three common structural rules are:    Weakening , where the hypotheses or conclusion of a sequent may be extended with additional members. In symbolic form weakening rules can be written as     Γ  ⊢  Σ     Γ  ,  A   ⊢  Σ        proves  normal-Γ  normal-Σ    proves   normal-Γ  A   normal-Σ     \frac{\Gamma\vdash\Sigma}{\Gamma,A\vdash\Sigma}   on the left of the turnstile , and     Γ  ⊢  Σ    Γ  ⊢   A  ,  Σ         proves  normal-Γ  normal-Σ    proves  normal-Γ   A  normal-Σ      \frac{\Gamma\vdash\Sigma}{\Gamma\vdash A,\Sigma}   on the right.  Contraction , where two equal (or unifiable) members on the same side of a sequent may be replaced by a single member (or common instance). Symbolically      Γ  ,  A  ,  A   ⊢  Σ     Γ  ,  A   ⊢  Σ        proves   normal-Γ  A  A   normal-Σ    proves   normal-Γ  A   normal-Σ     \frac{\Gamma,A,A\vdash\Sigma}{\Gamma,A\vdash\Sigma}   and     Γ  ⊢   A  ,  A  ,  Σ     Γ  ⊢   A  ,  Σ         proves  normal-Γ   A  A  normal-Σ     proves  normal-Γ   A  normal-Σ      \frac{\Gamma\vdash A,A,\Sigma}{\Gamma\vdash A,\Sigma}   . Also known as factoring in automated theorem proving systems using resolution .  Exchange , where two members on the same side of a sequent may be swapped. Symbolically       Γ  1   ,  A  ,   Γ  2   ,  B  ,   Γ  3    ⊢  Σ      Γ  1   ,  B  ,   Γ  2   ,  A  ,   Γ  3    ⊢  Σ        proves    subscript  normal-Γ  1   A   subscript  normal-Γ  2   B   subscript  normal-Γ  3    normal-Σ    proves    subscript  normal-Γ  1   B   subscript  normal-Γ  2   A   subscript  normal-Γ  3    normal-Σ     \frac{\Gamma_{1},A,\Gamma_{2},B,\Gamma_{3}\vdash\Sigma}{\Gamma_{1},B,\Gamma_{2%
 },A,\Gamma_{3}\vdash\Sigma}   and     Γ  ⊢    Σ  1   ,  A  ,   Σ  2   ,  B  ,   Σ  3      Γ  ⊢    Σ  1   ,  B  ,   Σ  2   ,  A  ,   Σ  3          proves  normal-Γ    subscript  normal-Σ  1   A   subscript  normal-Σ  2   B   subscript  normal-Σ  3      proves  normal-Γ    subscript  normal-Σ  1   B   subscript  normal-Σ  2   A   subscript  normal-Σ  3       \frac{\Gamma\vdash\Sigma_{1},A,\Sigma_{2},B,\Sigma_{3}}{\Gamma\vdash\Sigma_{1}%
 ,B,\Sigma_{2},A,\Sigma_{3}}   . (This is also known as the permutation rule .)   A logic without any of the above structural rules would interpret the sides of a sequent as pure sequences ; with exchange, they are multisets ; and with both contraction and exchange they are sets .  These are not the only possible structural rules. A famous structural rule is known as cut . Considerable effort is spent by proof theorists in showing that cut rules are superfluous in various logics. More precisely, what is shown is that cut is only (in a sense) a tool for abbreviating proofs, and does not add to the theorems that can be proved. The successful 'removal' of cut rules, known as cut elimination , is directly related to the philosophy of computation as normalization (see Curry–Howard correspondence ); it often gives a good indication of the complexity of deciding a given logic.
