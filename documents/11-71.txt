   Dethiobiotin synthase      Dethiobiotin synthase   In enzymology , a dethiobiotin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 7,8-diaminononanoate + CO 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + dethiobiotin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , 7,8-diaminononanoate , and CO 2 , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and dethiobiotin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically the cyclo-ligases, which form carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7,8-diaminononanoate:carbon-dioxide cyclo-ligase (ADP-forming) . This enzyme is also called desthiobiotin synthase . This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 14 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
