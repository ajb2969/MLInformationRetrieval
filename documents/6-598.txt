   Giant component      Giant component   In network theory , a giant component is a connected component of a given random graph that contains a constant fraction of the entire graph's vertices .  Giant components are a prominent feature of the Erdős–Rényi model of random graphs, in which each possible edge connecting pairs of a given set of   n   n   n   vertices is present, independently of the other edges, with probability   p   p   p   . In this model, if    p  ≤    1  -  ϵ   n       p      1  ϵ   n     p\leq\frac{1-\epsilon}{n}   for any constant    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   , then with high probability all connected components of the graph have size    O   (   l  o  g  n   )       O    l  o  g  n     O(logn)   , and there is no giant component. However, for    p  ≥    1  +  ϵ   n       p      1  ϵ   n     p\geq\frac{1+\epsilon}{n}   there is with high probability a single giant component, with all other components having size    O   (   l  o  g  n   )       O    l  o  g  n     O(logn)   . For    p  =   1  n       p    1  n     p=\frac{1}{n}   , intermediate between these two possibilities, the number of vertices in the largest component of the graph is with high probability proportional to    n   2  /  3      superscript  n    2  3     n^{2/3}   . 1  Alternatively, if one adds randomly selected edges one at a time, starting with an empty graph , then it is not until approximately    n  /  2      n  2    n/2   edges have been added that the graph contains a large component, and soon after that the component becomes giant. More precisely, when   t   t   t   edges have been added, for values of   t   t   t   close to but larger than    n  /  2      n  2    n/2   , the size of the giant component is approximately     4  t   -   2  n         4  t     2  n     4t-2n   . 2 However, according to the coupon collector's problem ,    Θ   (   n   log  n    )       normal-Θ    n    n      \Theta(n\log n)   edges are needed in order to have high probability that the whole random graph is connected.  A similar sharp threshold between parameters that lead to graphs with all components small and parameters that lead to a giant component also occurs in random graphs with non-uniform degree distributions . 3  References  "  Category:Graph connectivity  Category:Random graphs     . ↩   . ↩
