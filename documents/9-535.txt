   Radical of a module      Radical of a module   In mathematics , in the theory of modules , the radical of a module is a component in the theory of structure and classification. It is a generalization of the Jacobson radical for rings . In many ways, it is the dual notion to that of the socle soc( M ) of M .  Definition  Let R be a ring and M a left R -module. A submodule N of M is called maximal or cosimple if the quotient M / N is a simple module . The radical of the module M is the intersection of all maximal submodules of M ,       rad   (  M  )    =   ⋂   {  N  ∣   N  is a maximal submodule of M   }          rad  M      conditional-set  N    N  is a maximal submodule of M       \mathrm{rad}(M)=\bigcap\{N\mid N\mbox{ is a maximal submodule of M}\}\,   Equivalently,       rad   (  M  )    =   ∑   {  S  ∣   S  is a superfluous submodule of M   }          rad  M      conditional-set  S    S  is a superfluous submodule of M       \mathrm{rad}(M)=\sum\{S\mid S\mbox{ is a superfluous submodule of M}\}\,   These definitions have direct dual analogues for soc( M ).  Properties   In addition to the fact rad( M ) is the sum of superfluous submodules, in a Noetherian module rad( M ) itself is a superfluous submodule .  A ring for which rad( M ) ={0} for every right R module M is called a right V-ring.  For any module M , rad( M /rad( M )) is zero.  M is a finitely generated module if and only if M /rad( M ) is finitely generated and rad( M ) is a superfluous submodule of M .
