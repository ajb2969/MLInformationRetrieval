   Chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase      Chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase   In enzymology , a chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + beta-1,4-D-mannosylchitobiosyldiphosphodolichol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol , whereas its two products are GDP and beta-1,4-D-mannosylchitobiosyldiphosphodolichol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose:chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-D-mannosyltransferase . Other names in common use include guanosine diphosphomannose-dolichol diphosphochitobiose , mannosyltransferase , and GDP-mannose-dolichol diphosphochitobiose mannosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
