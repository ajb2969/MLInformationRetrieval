   Cystathionine gamma-synthase      Cystathionine gamma-synthase   In enzymology , a cystathionine gamma-synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   O 4 -succinyl-L-homoserine + L-cysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-cystathionine + succinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are O4-succinyl-L-homoserine and L-cysteine , whereas its two products are L-cystathionine and succinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O4-succinyl-L-homoserine:L-cysteine S-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)transferase . Other names in common use include O-succinyl-L-homoserine succinate-lyase (adding cysteine) , O-succinylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase , homoserine O-transsuccinylase , O-succinylhomoserine synthase , O-succinylhomoserine synthetase , cystathionine synthase , cystathionine synthetase , homoserine transsuccinylase , 4-O-succinyl-L-homoserine:L-cysteine , and S-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)transferase . This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways : methionine metabolism , cysteine metabolism , selenoamino acid metabolism , and sulfur metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
