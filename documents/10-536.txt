   Glycerol-3-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Glycerol-3-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NADP + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include glycerol phosphate (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , dehydrogenase , L-glycerol 3-phosphate:NADP + oxidoreductase , glycerin-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , NADPH-dependent glycerin-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , and glycerol-3-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (NADP + ) .
