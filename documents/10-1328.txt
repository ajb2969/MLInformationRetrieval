Arsenate reductase (donor)

Arsenate reductase (donor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

arsenite + acceptor 
 
 
 
  arsenate + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arsenite and an acceptor, whereas its two products are arsenate and a reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is arsenate:acceptor oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called arsenate:(acceptor) oxidoreductase.
