   Light cone gauge      Light cone gauge   In theoretical physics , light cone gauge is an approach to remove the ambiguities arising from a gauge symmetry . While the term refers to several situations, a null component of a field A is set to zero (or a simple function of other variables) in all cases. 1 2  Gauge theory  In gauge theory , light-cone gauge refers to the condition     A  +   =  0       superscript  A    0    A^{+}=0   where        A  +    (   x  0   ,   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =     A  0    (   x  0   ,   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    +    A  3    (   x  0   ,   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )            superscript  A      superscript  x  0    superscript  x  1    superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3          superscript  A  0     superscript  x  0    superscript  x  1    superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3        superscript  A  3     superscript  x  0    superscript  x  1    superscript  x  2    superscript  x  3        A^{+}(x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})=A^{0}(x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})+A^{3}(x^{0},x^{1%
 },x^{2},x^{3})   It is a method to get rid of the redundancies implied by Yang–Mills symmetry.  String theory  In string theory , light-cone gauge fixes the reparameterization invariance on the world sheet by        X  +    (  σ  ,  τ  )    =    p  +   τ          superscript  X     σ  τ       superscript  p    τ     X^{+}(\sigma,\tau)=p^{+}\tau   where    p  +     superscript  p     p^{+}   is a constant and   τ   τ   \tau   is the worldsheet time.  The advantage of light-cone gauge is that all ghosts and other unphysical degrees of freedom can be eliminated. The disadvantage is that some symmetries such as Lorentz symmetry become obscured (they become non-manifest, i.e. hard to prove).
