Light cone gauge

In theoretical physics, light cone gauge is an approach to remove the ambiguities arising from a gauge symmetry. While the term refers to several situations, a null component of a field A is set to zero (or a simple function of other variables) in all cases.12
Gauge theory
In gauge theory, light-cone gauge refers to the condition 
 
 
 
  where


 
  It is a method to get rid of the redundancies implied by Yang–Mills symmetry.
String theory
In string theory, light-cone gauge fixes the reparameterization invariance on the world sheet by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a constant and 
 
 
 
  is the worldsheet time.
The advantage of light-cone gauge is that all ghosts and other unphysical degrees of freedom can be eliminated. The disadvantage is that some symmetries such as Lorentz symmetry become obscured (they become non-manifest, i.e. hard to prove).
