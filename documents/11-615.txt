   Endoglycosylceramidase      Endoglycosylceramidase   In enzymology , an endoglycosylceramidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   oligoglycosylglucosylceramide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ceramide + oligoglycosylglucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are oligoglycosylglucosylceramide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ceramide and oligoglycosylglucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oligoglycosylglucosylceramide glycohydrolase . Other names in common use include endoglycoceramidase , EGCase , and glycosyl-N-acetyl-sphingosine 1,1-beta-D-glucanohydrolase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
