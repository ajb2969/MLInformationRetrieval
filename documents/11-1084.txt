   DTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose transaminase      DTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose transaminase   In enzymology , a dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucose:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include thymidine diphospho-4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose aminotransferase , thymidine diphospho-4-amino-6-deoxyglucose aminotransferase , thymidine diphospho-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose transaminase , thymidine diphospho-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose-glutamic transaminase , and TDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose transaminase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
