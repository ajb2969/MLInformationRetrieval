   N-sphere      N-sphere   In mathematics , the n -sphere is the generalization of the ordinary sphere to spaces of arbitrary dimension . For any natural number  n , an n -sphere of radius r is defined as the set of points in ( n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space which are at distance r from a central point, where the radius r may be any positive  real number . Thus, the n -sphere centred at the origin is defined by:        S  n   =   {   x  ∈   ℝ   n  +  1     :    ∥  x  ∥   =  r   }    .       superscript  S  n    conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ    n  1        norm  x   r      S^{n}=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}:\left\|x\right\|=r\right\}.   It is an n -dimensional manifold in Euclidean ( n + 1)-space.  In particular:   a 0-sphere is the pair of points at the ends of a (one-dimensional) line segment ,  a 1-sphere is the circle , which is the one-dimensional circumference of a (two-dimensional) disk in the plane,  a 2-sphere is the two-dimensional surface of a (three-dimensional) ball in three-dimensional space.   Spheres of dimension  are sometimes called hyperspheres , with a 3-sphere sometimes known as a glome . The n -sphere of unit radius centered at the origin is called the unit n -sphere , denoted S n . The unit n -sphere is often referred to as the  n -sphere.  An n -sphere is the surface or boundary of an -dimensional ball , and is an n -dimensional manifold . For , the n -spheres are the simply connected  n -dimensional manifolds of constant, positive curvature . The n -spheres admit several other topological descriptions: for example, they can be constructed by gluing two n -dimensional Euclidean spaces together, by identifying the boundary of an n -cube with a point, or (inductively) by forming the suspension of an -sphere.  Description  For any natural number  n , an n -sphere of radius r is defined as the set of points in ( n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space that are at distance r from some fixed point c , where r may be any positive  real number and where c may be any point in ( n + 1)-dimensional space. In particular:   a 0-sphere is a pair of points { c − r , c + r }, and is the boundary of a line segment (1-ball).  a 1-sphere is a circle of radius r centered at c , and is the boundary of a disk (2-ball).  a 2-sphere is an ordinary 2-dimensional sphere in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and is the boundary of an ordinary ball (3-ball).  a 3-sphere is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.   Euclidean coordinates in ( n + 1)-space  The set of points in ( n + 1)-space: ( x 1 , x 2 ,…, x n +1 ) that define an n -sphere, ( S n  ) is represented by the equation:        r  2   =    ∑   i  =  1    n  +  1      (    x  i   -   c  i    )   2     .       superscript  r  2     superscript   subscript     i  1      n  1     superscript     subscript  x  i    subscript  c  i    2      r^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(x_{i}-c_{i})^{2}.\,     where c is a center point, and r is the radius.  The above n -sphere exists in ( n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space and is an example of an n - manifold . The volume form ω of an n -sphere of radius r is given by      ω  =   1  r    ∑   j  =  1    n  +  1      (  -  1  )    j  -  1      x  j    d   x  1   ∧  ⋯  ∧  d   x   j  -  1    ∧  d   x   j  +  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧  d   x   n  +  1    =  *  d  r     fragments  ω     1  r    superscript   subscript     j  1      n  1     superscript   fragments  normal-(   1  normal-)     j  1     subscript  x  j   d   subscript  x  1    normal-⋯   d   subscript  x    j  1     d   subscript  x    j  1     normal-⋯   d   subscript  x    n  1      d  r    \omega={1\over r}\sum_{j=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{j-1}x_{j}\,dx_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx_%
 {j-1}\wedge dx_{j+1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx_{n+1}=*dr     where * is the Hodge star operator ; see  for a discussion and proof of this formula in the case r = 1. As a result,       d  r   ∧  ω   =    d   x  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   d   x   n  +  1       .          d  r   ω       d   subscript  x  1    normal-⋯    d   subscript  x    n  1        \scriptstyle{dr\wedge\omega=dx_{1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx_{n+1}}.     n -ball      The space enclosed by an n -sphere is called an ( n + 1)- ball . An ( n + 1)-ball is closed if it includes the n -sphere, and it is open if it does not include the n -sphere.  Specifically:   A 1- ball , a line segment , is the interior of a (0-sphere).  A 2- ball , a disk , is the interior of a circle (1-sphere).  A 3- ball , an ordinary ball , is the interior of a sphere (2-sphere).  A 4- ball is the interior of a 3-sphere , etc.   Topological description  Topologically , an n -sphere can be constructed as a one-point compactification of n -dimensional Euclidean space. Briefly, the n -sphere can be described as     𝕊  n   =    ℝ  n   ∪   {  ∞  }         superscript  𝕊  n      superscript  ℝ  n         \mathbb{S}^{n}=\mathbb{R}^{n}\cup\{\infty\}   , which is n -dimensional Euclidean space plus a single point representing infinity in all directions. In particular, if a single point is removed from an n -sphere, it becomes homeomorphic to    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . This forms the basis for stereographic projection . 1  Volume and surface area        V  n    (  R  )        subscript  V  n   R    V_{n}(R)   and     S  n    (  R  )        subscript  S  n   R    S_{n}(R)   are the n -dimensional volume and surface area of the n -ball and n -sphere of radius   R   R   R   , respectively.  The constants    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   and    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   (for the unit ball and sphere) are related by the recurrences:        V  0   =  1     V   n  +  1    =    S  n   /   (   n  +  1   )        formulae-sequence     subscript  V  0   1      subscript  V    n  1       subscript  S  n     n  1       V_{0}=1\qquad V_{n+1}=S_{n}/(n+1)           S  0   =  2     S   n  +  1    =   2  π   V  n        formulae-sequence     subscript  S  0   2      subscript  S    n  1      2  π   subscript  V  n       S_{0}=2\qquad S_{n+1}=2\pi V_{n}     The surfaces and volumes can also be given in closed form:          S   n  -  1     (  R  )        =     n   π   n  /  2      Γ   (    n  2   +  1   )      R   n  -  1            V  n    (  R  )        =     π   n  /  2     Γ   (    n  2   +  1   )      R  n              subscript  S    n  1    R     absent        n   superscript  π    n  2       normal-Γ      n  2   1      superscript  R    n  1           subscript  V  n   R     absent       superscript  π    n  2      normal-Γ      n  2   1      superscript  R  n        \begin{array}[]{ll}S_{n-1}(R)&=\displaystyle{\frac{n\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}%
 {2}+1)}R^{n-1}}\\
 V_{n}(R)&=\displaystyle{\frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}}R^{n}\end{array}     where    Γ    normal-Γ   \Gamma\,   is the gamma function . Derivations of these equations are given in this section.   In general, the volumes of the n -ball in n -dimensional Euclidean space, and the n -sphere in ( n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean, of radius R , are proportional to the n th power of the radius, R . We write      V  n    (  R  )    =    V  n    R  n           subscript  V  n   R      subscript  V  n    superscript  R  n      V_{n}(R)=V_{n}R^{n}   for the volume of the n -ball and      S  n    (  R  )    =    S  n    R  n           subscript  S  n   R      subscript  S  n    superscript  R  n      S_{n}(R)=S_{n}R^{n}   for the surface of the n -sphere, both of radius   R   R   R   .  Examples  The 0-ball consists of a single point. The 0-dimensional Hausdorff measure is the number of points in a set, so       V  0   =  1       subscript  V  0   1    V_{0}=1   . The unit 1-ball is the interval    [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   of length 2. So,       V  1   =  2.       subscript  V  1   2.    V_{1}=2.   The 0-sphere consists of its two end-points,    {   -  1   ,  1  }       1   1    \{-1,1\}   . So       S  0   =  2       subscript  S  0   2    S_{0}=2   . The unit 1-sphere is the unit circle in the Euclidean plane, and this has circumference (1-dimensional measure)        S  1   =   2  π    .       subscript  S  1     2  π     S_{1}=2\pi.\,   The region enclosed by the unit 1-sphere is the 2-ball, or unit disc, and this has area (2-dimensional measure)        V  2   =  π   .       subscript  V  2   π    V_{2}=\pi.\,   Analogously, in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the surface area (2-dimensional measure) of the unit 2-sphere is given by       S  2   =   4   π         subscript  S  2     4  π     S_{2}=4\pi\,   and the volume enclosed is the volume (3-dimensional measure) of the unit 3-ball, given by        V  3   =    4  3   π    .       subscript  V  3       4  3   π     V_{3}=\frac{4}{3}\pi.\,     Recurrences  The surface area , or properly the n -dimensional volume, of the n -sphere at the boundary of the ( n + 1)-ball of radius   R   R   R   is related to the volume of the ball by the differential equation        S  n    R  n    =    d   V   n  +  1     R   n  +  1      d  R    =    (   n  +  1   )    V   n  +  1     R  n             subscript  S  n    superscript  R  n        d   subscript  V    n  1     superscript  R    n  1       d  R             n  1    subscript  V    n  1     superscript  R  n       S_{n}R^{n}=\frac{dV_{n+1}R^{n+1}}{dR}={(n+1)V_{n+1}R^{n}}   , or, equivalently, representing the unit n -ball as a union of concentric ( n − 1)-sphere shells ,       V   n  +  1    =    ∫  0  1     S  n     r  n    d  r         subscript  V    n  1      superscript   subscript   0   1      subscript  S  n    superscript  r  n   d  r      V_{n+1}=\int_{0}^{1}S_{n}r^{n}\,dr   So,       V   n  +  1    =    S  n    n  +  1         subscript  V    n  1       subscript  S  n     n  1      V_{n+1}=\frac{S_{n}}{n+1}   .  We can also represent the unit ( n + 2)-sphere as a union of tori, each the product of a circle (1-sphere) with an n -sphere. Let    r  =   cos  θ       r    θ     r=\cos\theta   and      r  2   +   R  2    =  1         superscript  r  2    superscript  R  2    1    r^{2}+R^{2}=1   , so that    R  =   sin  θ       R    θ     R=\sin\theta   and     d  R   =   cos    θ   d  θ          d  R       θ  d  θ      dR=\cos\theta\,d\theta   . Then,      S   n  +  2      subscript  S    n  2     \displaystyle S_{n+2}   Since     S  1   =   2  π   V  0         subscript  S  1     2  π   subscript  V  0      S_{1}=2\pi V_{0}   , the equation     S   n  +  1    =   2  π   V  n         subscript  S    n  1      2  π   subscript  V  n      S_{n+1}=2\pi V_{n}   holds for all n .  This completes our derivation of the recurrences:        V  0   =  1     V   n  +  1    =    S  n   /   (   n  +  1   )        formulae-sequence     subscript  V  0   1      subscript  V    n  1       subscript  S  n     n  1       V_{0}=1\qquad V_{n+1}=S_{n}/(n+1)           S  0   =  2     S   n  +  1    =   2  π   V  n        formulae-sequence     subscript  S  0   2      subscript  S    n  1      2  π   subscript  V  n       S_{0}=2\qquad S_{n+1}=2\pi V_{n}     Closed forms  Combining the recurrences, we see that     V   n  +  2    =    2  π   V  n    /   (   n  +  2   )         subscript  V    n  2        2  π   subscript  V  n      n  2      V_{n+2}=2\pi V_{n}/(n+2)   . So it is simple to show by induction on k that,       V   2  k    =    π  k    k  !         subscript  V    2  k       superscript  π  k     k      V_{2k}=\frac{\pi^{k}}{k!}          V    2  k   +  1    =    2    (   2  π   )   k       (    2  k   +  1   )   !   !    =    2   k  !     (   4  π   )   k      (    2  k   +  1   )   !           subscript  V      2  k   1        2   superscript    2  π   k            2  k   1               2    k    superscript    4  π   k          2  k   1        V_{2k+1}=\frac{2(2\pi)^{k}}{(2k+1)!!}=\frac{2k!(4\pi)^{k}}{(2k+1)!}   where    !  !     fragments      !!   denotes the double factorial , defined for odd integers  by .  In general, the volume, in n -dimensional Euclidean space, of the unit n -ball, is given by       V  n   =    π   n  2     Γ   (    n  2   +  1   )          subscript  V  n      superscript  π    n  2      normal-Γ      n  2   1       V_{n}=\frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}     where    Γ    normal-Γ   \Gamma\,   is the gamma function , which satisfies      Γ   (   1  /  2   )    =   π    ;     Γ   (  1  )    =  1   ;    Γ   (   x  +  1   )    =   x  Γ   (  x  )         formulae-sequence      normal-Γ    1  2      π     formulae-sequence      normal-Γ  1   1       normal-Γ    x  1      x  normal-Γ  x       \Gamma(1/2)=\sqrt{\pi};\Gamma(1)=1;\Gamma(x+1)=x\Gamma(x)   .  By multiplying    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   by    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   , differentiating with respect to   R   R   R   , and then setting    R  =  1      R  1    R=1   , we get the closed form       S   n  -  1    =    2   π   n  2      Γ   (   n  2   )          subscript  S    n  1        2   superscript  π    n  2       normal-Γ    n  2       S_{n-1}=\frac{2\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2})}   .  Other relations  The recurrences can be combined to give a "reverse-direction" recurrence relation for surface area, as depicted in the diagram:       S   n  -  1    =    n   2  π     S    n  -  1   +  2          subscript  S    n  1        n    2  π     subscript  S      n  1   2       S_{n-1}=\frac{n}{2\pi}S_{n-1+2}     (Figure)  (Note that n refers to the dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, which is also the intrinsic dimension of the solid whose volume is listed here, but which is 1 more than the intrinsic dimension of the sphere whose surface area is listed here.) The curved red arrows show the relationship between formulas for different n . The formula coefficient at each arrow's tip equals the formula coefficient at that arrow's tail times the factor in the arrowhead. If the direction of the bottom arrows were reversed, their arrowheads would say to multiply by . Alternatively said, the surface area S n +1 of the sphere in  dimensions is exactly 2π times the volume V n enclosed by the sphere in n dimensions.   Index-shifting n to  then yields the recurrence relations:       V  n   =     2  π   n    V   n  -  2          subscript  V  n         2  π   n    subscript  V    n  2       V_{n}=\frac{2\pi}{n}V_{n-2}          S   n  -  1    =     2  π    n  -  2     S   n  -  1  -  2          subscript  S    n  1          2  π     n  2     subscript  S    n  1  2       S_{n-1}=\frac{2\pi}{n-2}S_{n-1-2}     where S 0 = 2, V 1 = 2, S 1 = 2   π   π   \pi   and V 2 =   π   π   \pi   .  The recurrence relation for    V  n     subscript  V  n    V_{n}   can also be proved via integration with 2-dimensional polar coordinates :      V  n     subscript  V  n    \displaystyle V_{n}     Spherical coordinates  We may define a coordinate system in an n -dimensional Euclidean space which is analogous to the spherical coordinate system defined for 3-dimensional Euclidean space, in which the coordinates consist of a radial coordinate,     r  ,     r   r\,,   and n − 1 angular coordinates     ϕ  1   ,   ϕ  2   ,  …  ,    ϕ   n  -  1         subscript  ϕ  1    subscript  ϕ  2   normal-…   subscript  ϕ    n  1      \phi_{1},\phi_{2},\dots,\phi_{n-1}\,   where     ϕ   n  -  1       subscript  ϕ    n  1     \phi_{n-1}\,   ranges over    [  0  ,   2  π   )     0    2  π     [0,2\pi)\,   radians (or over [0, 360) degrees) and the other angles range over    [  0  ,  π  ]     0  π    [0,\pi]\,   radians (or over [0, 180] degrees). If     x   i     subscript  x  i    \ x_{i}   are the Cartesian coordinates, then we may compute     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}   from    r  ,   ϕ  1   ,  …  ,   ϕ   n  -  1       r   subscript  ϕ  1   normal-…   subscript  ϕ    n  1      r,\phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{n-1}   with:      x  1     subscript  x  1    \displaystyle x_{1}     Except in the special cases described below, the inverse transformation is unique:     r   r   \displaystyle r     where if     x  k   ≠  0       subscript  x  k   0    x_{k}\neq 0   for some   k   k   k   but all of     x   k  +  1    ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x    k  1    normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{k+1},\ldots,x_{n}   are zero then     ϕ  k   =  0       subscript  ϕ  k   0    \phi_{k}=0   when     x  k   >  0       subscript  x  k   0    x_{k}>0   , and     ϕ  k   =  π       subscript  ϕ  k   π    \phi_{k}=\pi   radians (180 degrees) when     x  k   <  0       subscript  x  k   0    x_{k}<0   .  There are some special cases where the inverse transform is not unique;    ϕ  k     subscript  ϕ  k    \phi_{k}   for any   k   k   k   will be ambiguous whenever all of     x  k   ,   x   k  +  1    ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  k    subscript  x    k  1    normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{k},x_{k+1},\ldots,x_{n}   are zero; in this case    ϕ  k     subscript  ϕ  k    \phi_{k}   may be chosen to be zero.  Spherical volume element  Expressing the angular measures in radians, the volume element in n -dimensional Euclidean space will be found from the Jacobian of the transformation:       d  n   V       superscript  d  n   V    \displaystyle d^{n}V     and the above equation for the volume of the n -ball can be recovered by integrating:        V  n   =    ∫    ϕ   n  -  1    =  0    2  π      ∫    ϕ   n  -  2    =  0   π    ⋯    ∫    ϕ  1   =  0   π     ∫   r  =  0   R     d  n   V         .       subscript  V  n     superscript   subscript      subscript  ϕ    n  1    0      2  π      superscript   subscript      subscript  ϕ    n  2    0    π     normal-⋯    superscript   subscript      subscript  ϕ  1   0    π     superscript   subscript     r  0    R      superscript  d  n   V          V_{n}=\int_{\phi_{n-1}=0}^{2\pi}\int_{\phi_{n-2}=0}^{\pi}\cdots\int_{\phi_{1}=%

The natural choice of an orthogonal basis over the angular coordinates is a product of ultraspherical polynomials ,        ∫  0  π       sin   n  -  j  -  1     (   ϕ  j   )     C  s   (    (   n  -  j  -  1   )   /  2   )     (   cos   ϕ  j    )    C   s  ′    (    (   n  -  j  -  1   )   /  2   )     (   cos   ϕ  j    )   d   ϕ  j        superscript   subscript   0   π       superscript     n  j  1     subscript  ϕ  j     superscript   subscript  C  s       n  j  1   2       subscript  ϕ  j     superscript   subscript  C   superscript  s  normal-′        n  j  1   2       subscript  ϕ  j    d   subscript  ϕ  j      \displaystyle{}\quad\int_{0}^{\pi}\sin^{n-j-1}(\phi_{j})C_{s}^{((n-j-1)/2)}(%

Stereographic projection      Just as a two-dimensional sphere embedded in three dimensions can be mapped onto a two-dimensional plane by a stereographic projection , an n -sphere can be mapped onto an n -dimensional hyperplane by the n -dimensional version of the stereographic projection. For example, the point    [  x  ,  y  ,  z  ]     x  y  z    \ [x,y,z]   on a two-dimensional sphere of radius 1 maps to the point    [   x   1  -  z    ,   y   1  -  z    ]       x    1  z      y    1  z      \left[\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}\right]   on the     x   y      x  y    \ xy   plane. In other words,        [  x  ,  y  ,  z  ]   ↦   [   x   1  -  z    ,   y   1  -  z    ]    .     maps-to   x  y  z      x    1  z      y    1  z       \ [x,y,z]\mapsto\left[\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}\right].     Likewise, the stereographic projection of an n -sphere    𝐒   n  -  1      superscript  𝐒    n  1     \mathbf{S}^{n-1}   of radius 1 will map to the    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   dimensional hyperplane    𝐑   n  -  1      superscript  𝐑    n  1     \mathbf{R}^{n-1}   perpendicular to the     x   n     subscript  x  n    \ x_{n}   axis as        [   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]   ↦   [    x  1    1  -   x  n     ,    x  2    1  -   x  n     ,  …  ,    x   n  -  1     1  -   x  n     ]    .     maps-to    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n        subscript  x  1     1   subscript  x  n        subscript  x  2     1   subscript  x  n     normal-…     subscript  x    n  1      1   subscript  x  n        [x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}]\mapsto\left[\frac{x_{1}}{1-x_{n}},\frac{x_{2}}{1-x_%
 {n}},\ldots,\frac{x_{n-1}}{1-x_{n}}\right].     Generating random points  Uniformly at random from the ( n − 1)-sphere  To generate uniformly distributed random points on the ( n − 1)-sphere ( i.e. , the surface of the n -ball),  gives the following algorithm.  Generate an n -dimensional vector of normal deviates (it suffices to use N(0, 1), although in fact the choice of the variance is arbitrary),    𝐱  =   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       𝐱    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \mathbf{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})   .  Now calculate the "radius" of this point,     r  =     x  1  2   +   x  2  2   +  ⋯  +   x  n  2      .      r       superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n   2       r=\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}}.     The vector     1  r   𝐱        1  r   𝐱    \frac{1}{r}\mathbf{x}   is uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit n -ball.  Examples  For example, when n = 2 the normal distribution exp(− x 1 2 ) when expanded over another axis exp(− x 2 2 ) after multiplication takes the form exp(− x 1 2 − x 2 2 ) or exp(− r 2 ) and so is only dependent on distance from the origin.  Alternatives  Another way to generate a random distribution on a hypersphere is to make a uniform distribution over a hypercube that includes the unit hyperball, exclude those points that are outside the hyperball, then project the remaining interior points outward from the origin onto the surface. This will give a uniform distribution, but it is necessary to remove the exterior points. As the relative volume of the hyperball to the hypercube decreases very rapidly with dimension, this procedure will succeed with high probability only for fairly small numbers of dimensions.  Wendel's theorem gives the probability that all of the points generated will lie in the same half of the hypersphere.  Uniformly at random from the n -ball  With a point selected from the surface of the n -ball uniformly at random, one needs only a radius to obtain a point uniformly at random within the n -ball. If u is a number generated uniformly at random from the interval [0, 1] and x is a point selected uniformly at random from the surface of the n -ball then u 1/n x is uniformly distributed over the entire unit n -ball.
