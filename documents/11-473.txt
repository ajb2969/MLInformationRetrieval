   Dodecanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) hydrolase      Dodecanoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) hydrolase   In enzymology , a dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [acyl-carrier-protein] + dodecanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acyl-carrier-protein and dodecanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase . Other names in common use include lauryl-acyl-carrier-protein hydrolase , dodecanoyl-acyl-carrier-protein hydrolase , dodecyl-acyl-carrier protein hydrolase , and dodecanoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] hydrolase .
