Fourier coordinates

If the given directed graph with boundary is rotation invariant then its hitting matrix is diagonal in Fourier coordinates. Let



be the N'th root of unity or any other root of unity not equal to 1.


 
 . We consider the following symmetric Vandermonde matrix:



For example,



The square of the Fourier transform is the flip permutation matrix:



The fourth power of the Fourier transform is the identity:



Exercise: Proof that for any
