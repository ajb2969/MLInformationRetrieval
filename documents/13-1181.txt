   Matching polynomial      Matching polynomial   In the mathematical fields of graph theory and combinatorics , a matching polynomial (sometimes called an acyclic polynomial ) is a generating function of the numbers of matchings of various sizes in a graph.  Definition  Several different types of matching polynomials have been defined. Let G be a graph with n vertices and let m k be the number of k -edge matchings.  One matching polynomial of G is         m  G    (  x  )    :=    ∑   k  ≥  0      m  k    x  k      .     assign     subscript  m  G   x     subscript     k  0       subscript  m  k    superscript  x  k       m_{G}(x):=\sum_{k\geq 0}m_{k}x^{k}.     Another definition gives the matching polynomial as         M  G    (  x  )    :=    ∑   k  ≥  0       (   -  1   )   k    m  k    x   n  -   2  k        .     assign     subscript  M  G   x     subscript     k  0       superscript    1   k    subscript  m  k    superscript  x    n    2  k         M_{G}(x):=\sum_{k\geq 0}(-1)^{k}m_{k}x^{n-2k}.     A third definition is the polynomial         μ  G    (  x  ,  y  )    :=    ∑   k  ≥  0      m  k    x  k    y   n  -   2  k        .     assign     subscript  μ  G    x  y      subscript     k  0       subscript  m  k    superscript  x  k    superscript  y    n    2  k         \mu_{G}(x,y):=\sum_{k\geq 0}m_{k}x^{k}y^{n-2k}.     Each type has its uses, and all are equivalent by simple transformations. For instance,        M  G    (  x  )    =    x  n    m  G    (   -   x   -  2     )           subscript  M  G   x      superscript  x  n    subscript  m  G      superscript  x    2        M_{G}(x)=x^{n}m_{G}(-x^{-2})   and         μ  G    (  x  ,  y  )    =    y  n    m  G    (   x  /   y  2    )     .         subscript  μ  G    x  y       superscript  y  n    subscript  m  G     x   superscript  y  2       \mu_{G}(x,y)=y^{n}m_{G}(x/y^{2}).     Connections to other polynomials  The first type of matching polynomial is a direct generalization of the rook polynomial .  The second type of matching polynomial has remarkable connections with orthogonal polynomials . For instance, if G = K m , n , the complete bipartite graph , then the second type of matching polynomial is related to the generalized Laguerre polynomial  L n α ( x ) by the identity:         M   K   m  ,  n      (  x  )    =    n  !    L  n   (   m  -  n   )     (   x  2   )     .         subscript  M   subscript  K   m  n     x       n    superscript   subscript  L  n     m  n     superscript  x  2      M_{K_{m,n}}(x)=n!L_{n}^{(m-n)}(x^{2}).\,     If G is the complete graph  K n , then M G ( x ) is an Hermite polynomial:         M   K  n     (  x  )    =    H  n    (  x  )     ,         subscript  M   subscript  K  n    x      subscript  H  n   x     M_{K_{n}}(x)=H_{n}(x),\,   where H n ( x ) is the "probabilist's Hermite polynomial" (1) in the definition of Hermite polynomials . These facts were observed by .  If G is a forest , then its matching polynomial is equal to its characteristic polynomial .  If G is a path or a cycle , then M G ( x ) is a Chebyshev polynomial . In this case μ G (1, x ) is a Fibonacci polynomial or Lucas polynomial respectively.  Complementation  The matching polynomial of a graph G with n vertices is related to that of its complement by a pair of (equivalent) formulas. One of them is a simple combinatorial identity due to . The other is an integral identity due to .  There is a similar relation for a subgraph G of K m , n and its complement in K m , n . This relation, due to Riordan (1958), was known in the context of non-attacking rook placements and rook polynomials.  Applications in chemical informatics  The Hosoya index of a graph G , its number of matchings, is used in chemoinformatics as a structural descriptor of a molecular graph. It may be evaluated as m G (1) .  The third type of matching polynomial was introduced by  as a version of the "acyclic polynomial" used in chemistry .  Computational complexity  On arbitrary graphs, or even planar graphs , computing the matching polynomial is #P-complete . However, it can be computed more efficiently when additional structure about the graph is known. In particular, computing the matching polynomial on n -vertex graphs of treewidth  k is fixed-parameter tractable : there exists an algorithm whose running time, for any fixed constant k , is a polynomial in n with an exponent that does not depend on k . The matching polynomial of a graph with n vertices and clique-width  k may be computed in time n O( k )   References    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
