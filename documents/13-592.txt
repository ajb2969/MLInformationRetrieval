   Omega and agemo subgroup      Omega and agemo subgroup   In mathematics , or more specifically group theory , the omega and agemo  subgroups described the so-called "power structure" of a finite  p -group . They were introduced in  where they were used to describe a class of finite p -groups whose structure was sufficiently similar to that of finite abelian  p -groups, the so-called, regular p-groups . The relationship between power and commutator structure forms a central theme in the modern study of p -groups, as exemplified in the work on uniformly powerful p-groups .  The word "agemo" is just "omega" spelled backwards, and the agemo subgroup is denoted by an upside-down omega.  Definition  The omega subgroups are the series of subgroups of a finite p-group, G , indexed by the natural numbers:         Ω  i    (  G  )    =   ⟨   {  g  :    g   p  i    =  1   }   ⟩    .         subscript  normal-Ω  i   G    delimited-⟨⟩   conditional-set  g     superscript  g   superscript  p  i    1       \Omega_{i}(G)=\langle\{g:g^{p^{i}}=1\}\rangle.     The agemo subgroups are the series of subgroups:         ℧  i    (  G  )    =   ⟨   {   g   p  i    :   g  ∈  G   }   ⟩    .         superscript  normal-℧  i   G    delimited-⟨⟩   conditional-set   superscript  g   superscript  p  i      g  G       \mho^{i}(G)=\langle\{g^{p^{i}}:g\in G\}\rangle.     When i = 1 and p is odd, then i is normally omitted from the definition. When p is even, an omitted i may mean either i = 1 or i = 2 depending on local convention. In this article, we use the convention that an omitted i always indicates i = 1.  Examples  The dihedral group of order 8 , G , satisfies: ℧( G ) = Z( G ) = [ G , G ] = Φ( G ) = Soc( G ) is the unique normal subgroup of order 2, typically realized as the subgroup containing the identity and a 180° rotation. However Ω( G ) = G is the entire group, since G is generated by reflections. This shows that Ω( G ) need not be the set of elements of order p .  The quaternion group of order 8 , H , satisfies Ω( H ) = ℧( H ) = Z( H ) = [ H , H ] = Φ( H ) = Soc( H ) is the unique subgroup of order 2, normally realized as the subgroup containing only 1 and −1.  The Sylow p -subgroup , P , of the symmetric group on p 2 points is the wreath product of two cyclic groups of prime order. When p = 2, this is just the dihedral group of order 8. It too satisfies Ω( P ) = P . Again ℧( P ) = Z( P ) = Soc( P ) is cyclic of order p , but [ P , P ] = Φ( G ) is elementary abelian of order p p −1 .  The semidirect product of a cyclic group of order 4 acting non-trivially on a cyclic group of order 4,      K  =   ⟨  a  ,  b  :   a  4   =   b  4   =  1  ,  b  a  =  a   b  3   ⟩   ,     fragments  K    fragments  normal-⟨  a  normal-,  b  normal-:   superscript  a  4     superscript  b  4    1  normal-,  b  a   a   superscript  b  3   normal-⟩   normal-,    K=\langle a,b:a^{4}=b^{4}=1,ba=ab^{3}\rangle,   has ℧( K ) elementary abelian of order 4, but the set of squares is simply { 1, aa , bb }. Here the element aabb of ℧( K ) is not a square, showing that ℧ is not simply the set of squares.  Properties  In this section, let G be a finite p -group of order | G | = p n and exponent exp( G ) = p k have a number of useful properties.   General properties:    Both Ω i ( G ) and ℧ i ( G ) are characteristic subgroups of G for all natural numbers, i .  The omega and agemo subgroups form two normal series :     G = ℧ 0 ( G ) ≥ ℧ 1 ( G ) ≥ ℧ 2 ( G ) ≥ ... ≥ ℧ k −2 ( G ) ≥ ℧ k −1 ( G ) > ℧ k ( G ) = 1  G = Ω k ( G ) ≥ Ω k −1 ( G ) ≥ Ω k −2 ( G ) ≥ ... ≥ Ω 2 ( G ) ≥ Ω 1 ( G ) > Ω 0 ( G ) = 1    and the series are loosely intertwined: For all i between 1 and k :  ℧ i ( G ) ≤ Ω k − i ( G ), but  ℧ i −1 ( G ) is not contained in Ω k − i ( G ).      Behavior under quotients and subgroups:   If H ≤ G is a subgroup of G and N ⊲ G is a normal subgroup of G , then:   ℧ i ( H ) ≤ H ∩ ℧ i ( G )  Ω i ( H ) = H ∩ Ω i ( G )  ℧ i ( N ) ⊲ G  Ω i ( N ) ⊲ G  ℧ i ( G / N ) = ℧ i ( G ) N / N  Ω i ( G / N ) ≥ Ω i ( G ) N / N    Relation to other important subgroups:    Soc( G ) = Ω(Z( G )), the subgroup consisting of central elements of order p is the socle , Soc( G ), of G  Φ ( G ) = ℧( G )[ G , G ], the subgroup generated by all p th powers and commutators is the Frattini subgroup , Φ( G ), of G .    Relations in special classes of groups:    In an abelian p -group, or more generally in a regular p -group:     |℧ i ( G )|⋅|Ω i ( G )| = | G |  [℧ i ( G ):℧ i +1 ( G )] = [Ω i ( G ):Ω i +1 ( G )],    where | H | is the order of H and [ H : K ] = | H |/| K | denotes the index of the subgroups K ≤ H .   Applications  The first application of the omega and agemo subgroups was to draw out the analogy of regular  p -groups with abelian  p -groups in .  Groups in which Ω( G ) ≤ Z( G ) were studied by John G. Thompson and have seen several more recent applications.  The dual notion, groups with [ G , G ] ≤ ℧( G ) are called powerful p-groups and were introduced by Avinoam Mann . These groups were critical for the proof of the coclass conjectures which introduced an important way to understand the structure and classification of finite p -groups.
