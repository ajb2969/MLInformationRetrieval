2-phosphosulfolactate phosphatase

In enzymology, a 2-phosphosulfolactate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(2R)-2-phospho-3-sulfolactate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (2R)-3-sulfolactate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (2R)-2-phospho-3-sulfolactate and H2O, whereas its two products are (2R)-3-sulfolactate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-2-phospho-3-sulfolactate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include (2R)-phosphosulfolactate phosphohydrolase, and ComB phosphatase.
Structural studies
