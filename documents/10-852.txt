TRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a tRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing N6-methyladenine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing N6-methyladenine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine-6-N-)-methyltransferase.
