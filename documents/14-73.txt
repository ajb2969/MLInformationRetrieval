   Thirring–Wess model      Thirring–Wess model   The Thirring–Wess model or Vector Meson model is an exactly solvable quantum field theory describing the interaction of a Dirac field with a vector field in dimension two.  Definition  The Lagrangian density is made of three terms:  the free vector field    A  μ     superscript  A  μ    A^{\mu}   is described by         (   F   μ  ν    )   2   4   +     μ  2   2     (   A  μ   )   2           superscript   superscript  F    μ  ν    2   4        superscript  μ  2   2    superscript   superscript  A  μ   2      {(F^{\mu\nu})^{2}\over 4}+{\mu^{2}\over 2}(A^{\mu})^{2}     for     F   μ  ν    =     ∂  μ    A  ν    -    ∂  ν    A  μ          superscript  F    μ  ν        superscript   μ    superscript  A  ν      superscript   ν    superscript  A  μ       F^{\mu\nu}=\partial^{\mu}A^{\nu}-\partial^{\nu}A^{\mu}   and the boson mass   μ   μ   \mu   must be strictly positive; the free fermion field   ψ   ψ   \psi   is described by       ψ  ¯    (  i  ∂  /  -  m  )   ψ     fragments   normal-¯  ψ    fragments  normal-(  i     m  normal-)   ψ    \overline{\psi}(i\partial\!\!\!/-m)\psi     where the fermion mass   m   m   m   can be positive or zero. And the interaction term is      q   A  μ    (    ψ  ¯    γ  μ   ψ   )       q   superscript  A  μ      normal-¯  ψ    superscript  γ  μ   ψ     qA^{\mu}(\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi)     Although not required to define the massive vector field, there can be also a gauge-fixing term       α  2     (    ∂  μ    A  μ    )   2         α  2    superscript    superscript   μ    superscript  A  μ    2     {\alpha\over 2}(\partial^{\mu}A^{\mu})^{2}   for    α  ≥  0      α  0    \alpha\geq 0     There is a remarkable difference between the case    α  >  0      α  0    \alpha>0   and the case    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   : the latter requires a field renormalization to absorb divergences of the two point correlation.  History  This model was introduced by Thirring and Wess as a version of the Schwinger model with a vector mass term in the Lagrangian .  When the fermion is massless (    m  =  0      m  0    m=0   ), the model is exactly solvable. One solution was found, for    α  =  1      α  1    \alpha=1   , by Thirring and Wess 1 using a method introduced by Johnson for the Thirring model ; and, for    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   , two different solutions were given by Brown 2 and Sommerfield. 3 Subsequently Hagen 4 showed (for    α  =  0      α  0    \alpha=0   , but it turns out to be true for    α  ≥  0      α  0    \alpha\geq 0   ) that there is a one parameter family of solutions.
