Thirring–Wess model

The Thirring–Wess model or Vector Meson model is an exactly solvable quantum field theory describing the interaction of a Dirac field with a vector field in dimension two.
Definition
The Lagrangian density is made of three terms:
the free vector field 
 
 
 
  is described by



for 
 
 
 
  and the boson mass 
 
 
 
  must be strictly positive; the free fermion field 
 
 
 
  is described by



where the fermion mass 
 
 
 
 
  can be positive or zero. And the interaction term is



Although not required to define the massive vector field, there can be also a gauge-fixing term


 
  for 
 
 

There is a remarkable difference between the case 
 
 
 
  and the case 
 
 
 
 
 : the latter requires a field renormalization to absorb divergences of the two point correlation.
History
This model was introduced by Thirring and Wess as a version of the Schwinger model with a vector mass term in the Lagrangian .
When the fermion is massless (
 
 
 
 ), the model is exactly solvable. One solution was found, for 
 
 
 
 , by Thirring and Wess 1 using a method introduced by Johnson for the Thirring model; and, for 
 
 
 
 , two different solutions were given by Brown2 and Sommerfield.3 Subsequently Hagen 4 showed (for 
 
 
 
 , but it turns out to be true for 
 
 
 
 
 ) that there is a one parameter family of solutions.
