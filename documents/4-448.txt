   Quantale      Quantale   In mathematics , quantales are certain partially ordered  algebraic structures that generalize locales ( point free topologies ) as well as various multiplicative lattices of ideals from ring theory and functional analysis ( C*-algebras , von Neumann algebras ). Quantales are sometimes referred to as complete residuated semigroups .  A quantale is a complete lattice  Q with an associative  binary operation ∗ : Q × Q → Q , called its multiplication , satisfying       x  *   (    ⋁   i  ∈  I     y  i    )    =    ⋁   i  ∈  I     (   x  *   y  i    )          x    subscript     i  I     subscript  y  i       subscript     i  I      x   subscript  y  i       x*(\bigvee_{i\in I}{y_{i}})=\bigvee_{i\in I}(x*y_{i})     and        (    ⋁   i  ∈  I     y  i    )   *  x   =    ⋁   i  ∈  I     (    y  i   *  x   )            subscript     i  I     subscript  y  i    x     subscript     i  I       subscript  y  i   x      (\bigvee_{i\in I}{y_{i}})*{x}=\bigvee_{i\in I}(y_{i}*x)     for all x , y i in Q , i in I (here I is any index set ).  The quantale is unital if it has an identity element  e for its multiplication:   x ∗ e = x = e ∗ x    for all x in Q . In this case, the quantale is naturally a monoid with respect to its multiplication ∗.  A unital quantale may be defined equivalently as a monoid in the category Sup of complete join semi-lattices.  A unital quantale is an idempotent semiring , or dioid, under join and multiplication.  A unital quantale in which the identity is the top element of the underlying lattice, is said to be strictly two-sided (or simply integral ).  A commutative quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is commutative . A frame , with its multiplication given by the meet operation, is a typical example of a strictly two-sided commutative quantale. Another simple example is provided by the unit interval together with its usual multiplication .  An idempotent quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is idempotent . A frame is the same as an idempotent strictly two-sided quantale.  An involutive quantale is a quantale with an involution:        (   x  y   )   ∘   =    y  ∘    x  ∘         superscript    x  y        superscript  y     superscript  x       (xy)^{\circ}=y^{\circ}x^{\circ}   that preserves joins:         (    ⋁   i  ∈  I     x  i    )   ∘   =    ⋁   i  ∈  I     (   x  i  ∘   )     .       superscript    subscript     i  I     subscript  x  i        subscript     i  I     superscript   subscript  x  i        \biggl(\bigvee_{i\in I}{x_{i}}\biggr)^{\circ}=\bigvee_{i\in I}(x_{i}^{\circ}).     A quantale homomorphism is a map f : Q 1 → Q 2 that preserves joins and multiplication for all x , y , x i in Q , i in I :       f   (   x  y   )    =   f   (  x  )   f   (  y  )          f    x  y      f  x  f  y     f(xy)=f(x)f(y)         f   (   ⋁   i  ∈  I     x  i    )  =   ⋁   i  ∈  I    f   (   x  i   )        fragments  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript     i  I     subscript  x  i    fragments  normal-)    subscript     i  I    f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  i   normal-)       f\biggl(\bigvee_{i\in I}{x_{i}}\biggl)=\bigvee_{i\in I}f(x_{i})     See also   relation algebra   References    [ http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Quantale&oldid; ;=17639]  J.
