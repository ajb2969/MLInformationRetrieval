Bilirubin-glucuronoside glucuronosyltransferase

In enzymology, a bilirubin-glucuronoside glucuronosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 bilirubin-glucuronoside 
 
 
 
  bilirubin + bilirubin-bisglucuronoside
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, bilirubin-glucuronoside, and two products, bilirubin and bilirubin-bisglucuronoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is bilirubin-glucuronoside:bilirubin-glucuronoside D-glucuronosyltransferase. Other names in common use include bilirubin monoglucuronide transglucuronidase, and bilirubin glucuronoside glucuronosyltransferase.
