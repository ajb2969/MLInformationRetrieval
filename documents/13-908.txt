   Levitzky's theorem      Levitzky's theorem   In mathematics , more specifically ring theory and the theory of nil ideals , Levitzky's theorem , named after Jacob Levitzki , states that in a right Noetherian ring , every nil one-sided ideal is necessarily nilpotent . 1 2 Levitzky's theorem is one of the many results suggesting the veracity of the Köthe conjecture , and indeed provided a solution to one of Köthe's questions as described in . The result was originally submitted in 1939 as , and a particularly simple proof was given in .  Proof  This is Utumi's argument as it appears in   Lemma   Assume that R satisfies the ascending chain condition on annihilators of the form    {   r  ∈  R   ∣    a  r   =  0   }     conditional-set    r  R       a  r   0     \{r\in R\mid ar=0\}   where a is in R . Then   Any nil one-sided ideal is contained in the lower nil radical Nil * ( R );  Every nonzero nil right ideal contains a nonzero nilpotent right ideal.  Every nonzero nil left ideal contains a nonzero nilpotent left ideal.    Levitzki's Theorem   Let R be a right Noetherian ring. Then every nil one-sided ideal of R is nilpotent. In this case, the upper and lower nilradicals are equal, and moreover this ideal is the largest nilpotent ideal among nilpotent right ideals and among nilpotent left ideals.  Proof : In view of the previous lemma, it is sufficient to show that the lower nilradical of R is nilpotent. Because R is right Noetherian, a maximal nilpotent ideal N exists. By maximality of N , the quotient ring R / N has no nonzero nilpotent ideals, so R / N is a semiprime ring . As a result, N contains the lower nilradical of R . Since the lower nilradical contains all nilpotent ideals, it also contains N , and so N is equal to the lower nilradical. Q.E.D.
