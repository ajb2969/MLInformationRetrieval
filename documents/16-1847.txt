   Global mode      Global mode   In mathematics and physics, a global mode of a system is one in which the system executes coherent oscillations in time. Suppose a quantity    y   (  x  ,  t  )       y   x  t     y(x,t)   which depends on space   x   x   x   and time   t   t   t   is governed by some partial differential equation which does not have an explicit dependence on   t   t   t   . Then a global mode is a solution of this PDE of the form     y   (  x  ,  t  )    =    y  ^    (  x  )    e   i  ω  t           y   x  t       normal-^  y   x   superscript  e    i  ω  t       y(x,t)=\hat{y}(x)e^{i\omega t}   , for some frequency    ω   ω   \omega   . If   ω   ω   \omega   is complex, then the imaginary part corresponds to the mode exhibiting exponential growth or exponential decay .  The concept of a global mode can be compared to that of a normal mode ; the PDE may be thought of as a dynamical system of infinitely many equations coupled together. Global modes are used in the stability analysis of hydrodynamical systems . Philip Drazin introduced the concept of a global mode in his 1974 paper, and gave a technique for finding the normal modes of a linear PDE problem in which the coefficients or geometry vary slowly in   x   x   x   . This technique is based on the WKBJ approximation , which is a special case of multiple-scale analysis . 1 His method extends the Briggs–Bers technique , which gives a stability analysis for linear PDEs with constant coefficients. 2  In practice  Since Drazin's 1974 paper, other authors have studied more realistic problems in fluid dynamics using a global mode analysis. Such problems are often highly nonlinear , and attempts to analyse them have often relied on laboratory or numerical experiment. 3 Examples of global modes in practice include the oscillatory wakes produced when fluid flows past an object, such as a vortex street .
