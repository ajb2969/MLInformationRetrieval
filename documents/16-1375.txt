   Severity factor      Severity factor   A severity factor is established as a coefficient to assess the dielectric severity supported by a transformer winding considering the incoming transient overvoltage ( voltage spike ). It determines the safety margin regarding to the standard acceptance tests either in the frequency or time domain .  Severity factors are a newly concept for analyzing the dielectric severity supported along transformer windings when a transformer is submitted to a non-standardized transient voltage  waveform  induced from the power system .  Two are the new factors considered for evaluating the severity supported by the insulation windings both in factory and in service. One factor is called Time Domain Severity Factor ( TDSF ) and another one is the Frequency Domain Severity Factor ( FDSF ).  Background  One first approach to the concept of severity factor was made by Malewski et al. 1 Later, Asano et al. applied the Malewski’s idea for further analysis but including the concept of Energy Spectral Density (ESD) associated to the transient voltage wave. 2 A step forward was given by Rocha et al., whom introduced a new coefficient called Frequency Domain Severity Factor ( FDSF ). 3 4 For those situations where an internal assessment is necessary a new coefficient named Time Domain Severity Factor ( TDSF ) was proposed by Casimiro Alvarez-Mariño & Xose M. Lopez-Fernandez. 5 6 7  Frequency Domain Severity Factor (FDSF)  The FDSF is calculated at transformer terminals and it is mathematically defined as       𝐅𝐃𝐒𝐅   (  ω  )    =     𝐄𝐒𝐃  𝐧𝐨𝐒𝐭𝐝    (  ω  )      𝐄𝐒𝐃  𝐞𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥    (  ω  )           𝐅𝐃𝐒𝐅  ω        subscript  𝐄𝐒𝐃  𝐧𝐨𝐒𝐭𝐝   ω      subscript  𝐄𝐒𝐃  𝐞𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥   ω      \mathbf{FDSF(\omega)}=\frac{\mathbf{{{ESD}}_{noStd}}(\omega)}{\mathbf{{{ESD}}_%
 {envol}}(\omega)}     where ω is the angular frequency , ESD noStd ( ω ) is the maximum energy  spectral density of the input no-standard transient voltage applied at transformer terminals and ESD envol ( ω ) is the energy spectral density envelope for all standards dielectric tests at terminals.  Time Domain Severity Factor (TDSF)  The TDSF gives further detailed information on the severity supported by the transformer windings due to the transient event coming from the power system, regarding to the internal transient response due to dielectric tests in the time domain. The mathematical expression of this factor is       𝐓𝐃𝐒𝐅   (  𝐢  )    =    𝚫   𝐕  𝐧𝐨𝐒𝐭𝐝    (  i  )     𝚫   𝐕  𝐞𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥    (  i  )           𝐓𝐃𝐒𝐅  𝐢       𝚫   subscript  𝐕  𝐧𝐨𝐒𝐭𝐝   i     𝚫   subscript  𝐕  𝐞𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥   i      \mathbf{TDSF(i)}=\frac{\mathbf{{{\Delta V}}_{noStd}}(i)}{\mathbf{{{\Delta V}}_%
 {envol}}(i)}     where ∆V noStd ( i ) is the maximum voltage drop along the i th dielectric path due to the no-standard transient events and ∆V envol ( i ) is the maximum voltage drop along the same i th dielectric path for all standards dielectric tests.
