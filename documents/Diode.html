<h1>Diode</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, a <strong>diode</strong> is a two-<a href="Terminal_(electronics)" title="wikilink">terminal</a> <a href="electronic_component" title="wikilink">electronic component</a> with asymmetric <a href="electrical_conductance" title="wikilink">conductance</a>; it has low (ideally zero) <a href="electrical_resistance_and_conductance" title="wikilink">resistance</a> to <a href="Electric_current" title="wikilink">current</a> in one direction, and high (ideally <a href="Infinity" title="wikilink">infinite</a>) resistance in the other. A <strong>semiconductor diode</strong>, the most common type today, is a <a href="Crystallinity" title="wikilink">crystalline</a> piece of <a class="uri" href="semiconductor" title="wikilink">semiconductor</a> material with a <a href="p–n_junction" title="wikilink">p–n junction</a> connected to two electrical terminals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> A <a href="vacuum_tube" title="wikilink">vacuum tube</a> diode has two <a href="electrode" title="wikilink">electrodes</a>, a <a href="Plate_electrode" title="wikilink">plate</a> (anode) and a <a href="hot_cathode" title="wikilink">heated cathode</a>. Semiconductor diodes were the first <a href="Semiconductor_device" title="wikilink">semiconductor electronic devices</a>. The discovery of <a href="crystal" title="wikilink">crystals</a>' <a href="Rectification_(electricity)" title="wikilink">rectifying</a> abilities was made by German physicist <a href="Ferdinand_Braun" title="wikilink">Ferdinand Braun</a> in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called <a href="cat's_whisker_diode" title="wikilink">cat's whisker diodes</a>, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as <a class="uri" href="galena" title="wikilink">galena</a>. Today, most diodes are made of <a class="uri" href="silicon" title="wikilink">silicon</a>, but other semiconductors such as <a class="uri" href="selenium" title="wikilink">selenium</a> or <a class="uri" href="germanium" title="wikilink">germanium</a> are sometimes used.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="main-functions">Main functions</h2>

<p>The most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the diode's <em>forward</em> direction), while blocking current in the opposite direction (the <em>reverse</em> direction). Thus, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a <a href="check_valve" title="wikilink">check valve</a>. This unidirectional behavior is called <a href="rectification_(electricity)" title="wikilink">rectification</a>, and is used to convert <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">alternating current</a> to <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">direct current</a>, including extraction of <a class="uri" href="modulation" title="wikilink">modulation</a> from radio signals in radio receivers—these diodes are forms of <a href="rectifier" title="wikilink">rectifiers</a>.</p>

<p>However, diodes can have more complicated behavior than this simple on–off action, due to their <a href="linear_circuit" title="wikilink">nonlinear</a> current-voltage characteristics. Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold voltage or cut-in voltage is present in the forward direction (a state in which the diode is said to be <em><a href="p–n_junction#Forward_bias" title="wikilink">forward-biased</a></em>). The voltage drop across a forward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect can be used as a <a href="#Temperature_measurements" title="wikilink">temperature sensor</a> or <a href="voltage_reference" title="wikilink">voltage reference</a>.</p>

<p>Semiconductor diodes' current–voltage characteristic can be tailored by varying the <a href="semiconductor_materials" title="wikilink">semiconductor materials</a> and <a href="doping_(semiconductor)" title="wikilink">doping</a>, introducing impurities into the materials. These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions. For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage (<a href="Zener_diode" title="wikilink">Zener diodes</a>), to protect circuits from high voltage surges (<a href="avalanche_diode" title="wikilink">avalanche diodes</a>), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers (<a href="varactor_diode" title="wikilink">varactor diodes</a>), to generate <a href="radio_frequency" title="wikilink">radio-frequency</a> <a href="oscillation" title="wikilink">oscillations</a> (<a href="tunnel_diode" title="wikilink">tunnel diodes</a>, <a href="Gunn_diode" title="wikilink">Gunn diodes</a>, <a href="IMPATT_diode" title="wikilink">IMPATT diodes</a>), and to produce light (<a href="light-emitting_diode" title="wikilink">light-emitting diodes</a>). Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT diodes exhibit <a href="negative_resistance" title="wikilink">negative resistance</a>, which is useful in <a class="uri" href="microwave" title="wikilink">microwave</a> and switching circuits.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Thermionic (<a href="vacuum_tube" title="wikilink">vacuum tube</a>) diodes and <a href="solid_state_(electronics)" title="wikilink">solid state</a> (semiconductor) diodes were developed separately, at approximately the same time, in the early 1900s, as radio receiver <a href="detector_(radio)" title="wikilink">detectors</a>. Until the 1950s <a href="vacuum_tube" title="wikilink">vacuum tube</a> diodes were more often used in radios because the early point-contact type semiconductor diodes were less stable, and because most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for amplification that could easily have diodes included in the tube (for example the <a class="uri" href="12SQ7" title="wikilink">12SQ7</a> <a href="double_diode_triode" title="wikilink">double diode triode</a>), and vacuum tube rectifiers and gas-filled rectifiers handled some high voltage/high current rectification tasks beyond the capabilities of semiconductor diodes (such as <a href="metal_rectifier" title="wikilink">selenium rectifiers</a>) available at the time.</p>
<h3 id="vacuum-tube-diodes">Vacuum tube diodes</h3>

<p>In 1873, <a href="Frederick_Guthrie" title="wikilink">Frederick Guthrie</a> discovered the basic principle of operation of thermionic diodes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Guthrie discovered that a positively charged <a class="uri" href="electroscope" title="wikilink">electroscope</a> could be discharged by bringing a <a href="Ground_(electricity)" title="wikilink">grounded</a> piece of white-hot metal close to it (but not actually touching it). The same did not apply to a negatively charged electroscope, indicating that the current flow was only possible in one direction.</p>

<p><a href="Thomas_Edison" title="wikilink">Thomas Edison</a> independently rediscovered the principle on February 13, 1880. At the time, Edison was investigating why the filaments of his carbon-filament light bulbs nearly always burned out at the positive-connected end. He had a special bulb made with a metal plate sealed into the glass envelope. Using this device, he confirmed that an invisible current flowed from the glowing filament through the <a class="uri" href="vacuum" title="wikilink">vacuum</a> to the metal plate, but only when the plate was connected to the positive supply.</p>

<p>Edison devised a circuit where his modified light bulb effectively replaced the resistor in a <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">DC</a> <a class="uri" href="voltmeter" title="wikilink">voltmeter</a>. Edison was awarded a patent for this invention in 1884.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Since there was no apparent practical use for such a device at the time, the patent application was most likely simply a precaution in case someone else did find a use for the so-called <a href="Edison_effect" title="wikilink">Edison effect</a>.</p>

<p>About 20 years later, <a href="John_Ambrose_Fleming" title="wikilink">John Ambrose Fleming</a> (scientific adviser to the <a href="Marconi_Company" title="wikilink">Marconi Company</a> and former Edison employee) realized that the Edison effect could be used as a precision <a href="Detector_(radio)" title="wikilink">radio detector</a>. Fleming patented the first true thermionic diode, the <a href="Fleming_valve" title="wikilink">Fleming valve</a>, in Britain on November 16, 1904<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> (followed by  in November 1905).</p>
<h3 id="solid-state-diodes">Solid-state diodes</h3>

<p>In 1874 German scientist <a href="Karl_Ferdinand_Braun" title="wikilink">Karl Ferdinand Braun</a> discovered the "unilateral conduction" of crystals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Braun patented the crystal rectifier in 1899.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> <a href="Copper(I)_oxide" title="wikilink">Copper oxide</a> and <a href="selenium_rectifier" title="wikilink">selenium rectifiers</a> were developed for power applications in the 1930s.</p>

<p>Indian scientist <a href="Jagadish_Chandra_Bose" title="wikilink">Jagadish Chandra Bose</a> was the first to use a crystal for detecting radio waves in 1894.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The <a href="crystal_detector" title="wikilink">crystal detector</a> was developed into a practical device for <a href="wireless_telegraphy" title="wikilink">wireless telegraphy</a> by <a href="Greenleaf_Whittier_Pickard" title="wikilink">Greenleaf Whittier Pickard</a>, who invented a <a class="uri" href="silicon" title="wikilink">silicon</a> crystal detector in 1903 and received a patent for it on November 20, 1906.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Other experimenters tried a variety of other substances, of which the most widely used was the mineral <a class="uri" href="galena" title="wikilink">galena</a> (<a href="Galena" title="wikilink">lead sulfide</a>). Other substances offered slightly better performance, but galena was most widely used because it had the advantage of being cheap and easy to obtain. The crystal detector in these early <a href="crystal_radio" title="wikilink">crystal radio</a> sets consisted of an adjustable wire point-contact (the so-called "cat's whisker"), which could be manually moved over the face of the crystal in order to obtain optimum signal. This troublesome device was superseded by thermionic diodes by the 1920s, but after high purity semiconductor materials became available, the crystal detector returned to dominant use with the advent of inexpensive fixed-<a class="uri" href="germanium" title="wikilink">germanium</a> diodes in the 1950s. <a href="Bell_Labs" title="wikilink">Bell Labs</a> also developed a germanium diode for microwave reception, and AT&amp;T; used these in their microwave towers that criss-crossed the nation starting in the late 1940s, carrying telephone and network television signals. <a href="Bell_Labs" title="wikilink">Bell Labs</a> did not develop a satisfactory thermionic diode for microwave reception.</p>
<h3 id="etymology">Etymology</h3>

<p>At the time of their invention, such devices were known as <a href="rectifier" title="wikilink">rectifiers</a>. In 1919, the year <a href="tetrode" title="wikilink">tetrodes</a> were invented, <a href="William_Henry_Eccles" title="wikilink">William Henry Eccles</a> coined the term <strong><em>diode</em></strong> from the <a href="Greek_and_Latin_roots" title="wikilink">Greek roots</a> <em>di</em> (from <em>δί</em>), meaning "two", and <em>ode</em> (from <em>ὁδός</em>), meaning "path". (However, the word <em>diode</em> itself, as well as <em><a class="uri" href="triode" title="wikilink">triode</a>, <a class="uri" href="tetrode" title="wikilink">tetrode</a>, <a class="uri" href="pentode" title="wikilink">pentode</a>, <a class="uri" href="hexode" title="wikilink">hexode</a></em>, was already in use as a term of <a href="Time-division_multiplexing" title="wikilink">multiplex</a> <a class="uri" href="telegraphy" title="wikilink">telegraphy</a>; see, for example, <em>The telegraphic journal and electrical review</em>, September 10, 1886, p. 252).</p>
<h4 id="rectifiers">Rectifiers</h4>

<p>Although all diodes <em>rectify</em>, the term '<a class="uri" href="rectifier" title="wikilink">rectifier</a>' is normally reserved for higher currents and voltages than would normally be found in the rectification of lower power <a href="Signal_(electrical_engineering)" title="wikilink">signals</a>; examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Power_supply" title="wikilink">Power supply</a> rectifiers (<em><a href="Half-wave_rectifier#Half-wave_rectification" title="wikilink">half-wave</a></em>, <em>full-wave</em>, <em><a href="Bridge_rectifiers" title="wikilink">bridge</a></em>)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="thermionic-diodes">Thermionic diodes</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>A thermionic diode is a <a href="thermionic_valve" title="wikilink">thermionic-valve</a> device (also known as a <a href="vacuum_tube" title="wikilink">vacuum tube</a>, tube, or valve), consisting of a sealed evacuated glass envelope containing two <a href="electrode" title="wikilink">electrodes</a>: a <a href="thermionic_cathode" title="wikilink">cathode</a> heated by a <a href="electrical_filament" title="wikilink">filament</a>, and a <a href="plate_electrode" title="wikilink">plate</a> (<a class="uri" href="anode" title="wikilink">anode</a>). Early examples were fairly similar in appearance to <a href="incandescent_light_bulb" title="wikilink">incandescent light bulbs</a>.</p>

<p>In operation, a separate current through the filament (heater), a high resistance wire made of <a class="uri" href="nichrome" title="wikilink">nichrome</a>, heats the cathode red hot (800–1000 °C), causing it to release <a href="electron" title="wikilink">electrons</a> into the vacuum, a process called <a href="thermionic_emission" title="wikilink">thermionic emission</a>. The cathode is coated with <a href="oxide" title="wikilink">oxides</a> of <a href="alkaline_earth_metal" title="wikilink">alkaline earth metals</a> such as <a class="uri" href="barium" title="wikilink">barium</a> and <a class="uri" href="strontium" title="wikilink">strontium</a> <a href="oxide" title="wikilink">oxides</a>, which have a low <a href="work_function" title="wikilink">work function</a>, to increase the number of electrons emitted. (Some valves use <em>direct heating</em>, in which a tungsten filament acts as both heater and cathode.) The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric plate electrode. When the plate has a positive voltage with respect to the cathode, it <a href="electrostatics" title="wikilink">electrostatically</a> attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. However when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a negative voltage, no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it. The unheated plate does not emit any electrons itself. So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from cathode to plate.</p>

<p>In a <a href="mercury-arc_valve" title="wikilink">mercury-arc valve</a>, an arc forms between a refractory conductive anode and a pool of liquid mercury acting as cathode. Such units were made with ratings up to hundreds of kilowatts, and were important in the development of <a href="High-voltage_direct_current" title="wikilink">HVDC</a> power transmission. Some types of smaller thermionic rectifiers sometimes had mercury vapor fill to reduce their forward voltage drop and to increase current rating over thermionic hard-vacuum devices.</p>

<p>Throughout the vacuum tube era, valve diodes were used in analog signal applications and as rectifiers in DC power supplies in consumer electronics such as radios, televisions, and sound systems. They were replaced in power supplies beginning in the 1940s by <a href="selenium_rectifier" title="wikilink">selenium rectifiers</a> and then by semiconductor diodes by the 1960s. Today they are still used in a few high power applications where their ability to withstand transients and their robustness gives them an advantage over semiconductor devices. The recent (2012) resurgence of interest among <a href="audiophile" title="wikilink">audiophiles</a> and recording studios in old valve audio gear such as <a href="guitar_amplifier" title="wikilink">guitar amplifiers</a> and home audio systems has provided a market for the legacy consumer diode valves.</p>

<p>The symbol used for a semiconductor diode in a <a href="circuit_diagram" title="wikilink">circuit diagram</a> specifies the type of diode. There are alternative symbols for some types of diodes, though the differences are minor.</p>

<h3 id="point-contact-diodes">Point-contact diodes</h3>

<p>A <strong>point-contact diode</strong> works the same as the junction diodes described below, but its construction is simpler. A pointed metal wire is placed in contact with an n-type semiconductor. Some metal migrates into the semiconductor to make a small p-type region around the contact. The 1N34 germanium version is still used in radio receivers as a detector and occasionally in specialized analog electronics.</p>
<h3 id="junction-diodes">Junction diodes</h3>
<h4 id="pn-junction-diode">p–n junction diode</h4>

<p>A p–n junction diode is made of a crystal of <a class="uri" href="semiconductor" title="wikilink">semiconductor</a>, usually silicon, but <a class="uri" href="germanium" title="wikilink">germanium</a> and <a href="gallium_arsenide" title="wikilink">gallium arsenide</a> are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative <a href="charge_carrier" title="wikilink">charge carriers</a> (electrons), called <a href="n-type_semiconductor" title="wikilink">n-type semiconductor</a>, and a region on the other side that contains positive charge carriers (<a href="Electron_hole" title="wikilink">holes</a>), called <a href="p-type_semiconductor" title="wikilink">p-type semiconductor</a>. When two materials i.e. n-type and p-type are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from n to p side resulting in a third region where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the <a href="depletion_region" title="wikilink">depletion region</a> due to the absence of charge carriers (electrons and holes in this case). The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a <a href="p–n_junction" title="wikilink">p–n junction</a>, is where the action of the diode takes place. The crystal allows electrons to flow from the N-type side (called the <a class="uri" href="cathode" title="wikilink">cathode</a>) to the P-type side (called the <a class="uri" href="anode" title="wikilink">anode</a>), but not in the opposite direction.</p>
<h4 id="schottky-diode">Schottky diode</h4>

<p>Another type of junction diode, the <a href="Schottky_diode" title="wikilink">Schottky diode</a>, is formed from a <a href="metal–semiconductor_junction" title="wikilink">metal–semiconductor junction</a> rather than a p–n junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.</p>
<h3 id="currentvoltage-characteristic">Current–voltage characteristic</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>I–V (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a p–n junction diode</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its <a href="current–voltage_characteristic" title="wikilink">current–voltage characteristic</a>, or I–V graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve is determined by the transport of charge carriers through the so-called <em><a href="depletion_zone" title="wikilink">depletion layer</a></em> or <em><a href="depletion_region" title="wikilink">depletion region</a></em> that exists at the <a href="p–n_junction" title="wikilink">p–n junction</a> between differing semiconductors. When a p–n junction is first created, conduction-band (mobile) electrons from the N-<a href="dopant" title="wikilink">doped</a> region diffuse into the P-<a href="dopant" title="wikilink">doped</a> region where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with which the electrons "recombine". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side. The region around the p–n junction becomes depleted of <a href="charge_carrier" title="wikilink">charge carriers</a> and thus behaves as an <a href="nonconductor" title="wikilink">insulator</a>.</p>

<p>However, the width of the depletion region (called the <a href="depletion_width" title="wikilink">depletion width</a>) cannot grow without limit. For each <a href="electron–hole_pair" title="wikilink">electron–hole pair</a> that recombines, a positively charged <a class="uri" href="dopant" title="wikilink">dopant</a> ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a negatively charged dopant ion is left behind in the P-doped region. As recombination proceeds more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a "built-in" potential across the depletion zone.</p>

<p>If an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless <a href="electron–hole_pair" title="wikilink">electron–hole pairs</a> are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see <a class="uri" href="photodiode" title="wikilink">photodiode</a>). This is the <em><a href="reverse_bias" title="wikilink">reverse bias</a></em> phenomenon. However, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in substantial electric current through the p–n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external current passes through the diode, the voltage across the diode increases logarithmic with the current such that the P-doped region is positive with respect to the N-doped region and the diode is said to be "turned on" as it has a <em><a href="p–n_junction#Forward_bias" title="wikilink">forward bias</a></em>. The diode is commonly said to have a forward "threshold" voltage, which it conducts above and is cutoff below. However, this is only an approximation as the forward characteristic is according to the Shockley equation absolutely smooth (see graph below).</p>

<p>A diode's <a href="I–V_characteristic" title="wikilink">I–V characteristic</a> can be approximated by four regions of operation:</p>
<ol>
<li>At very large reverse bias, beyond the <a href="peak_inverse_voltage" title="wikilink">peak inverse voltage</a> or PIV, a process called reverse <a href="avalanche_breakdown" title="wikilink">breakdown</a> occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., a large number of electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The <a href="avalanche_diode" title="wikilink">avalanche diode</a> is deliberately designed for use in the avalanche region. In the <a href="Zener_diode" title="wikilink">Zener diode</a>, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is "clamped" to a known value (called the <em>Zener voltage</em>), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.</li>
<li>At reverse biases more positive than the PIV, has only a very small reverse saturation current. In the reverse bias region for a normal P–N rectifier diode, the current through the device is very low (in the µA range). However, this is temperature dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, a substantial amount of reverse current can be observed (mA or more).</li>
<li>With a small forward bias, where only a small forward current is conducted, the current–voltage curve is <a href="Exponential_function" title="wikilink">exponential</a> in accordance with the ideal diode equation. There is a definite forward voltage at which the diode starts to conduct significantly. This is called the <em>knee voltage</em> or <em>cut-in voltage</em> and is equal to the <a href="p–n_junction#Properties_of_a_p–n_junction" title="wikilink">barrier potential</a> of the p-n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and is seen more prominently on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram here.</li>
<li>At larger forward currents the current-voltage curve starts to be dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor. The curve is no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is the bulk resistance. This region is particularly important for power diodes. The effect can be modeled as an ideal diode in series with a fixed resistor.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a small silicon diode at rated currents, the voltage drop is about 0.6 to 0.7 <a href="volt" title="wikilink">volts</a>. The value is different for other diode types—<a href="Schottky_diode" title="wikilink">Schottky diodes</a> can be rated as low as 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue <a href="light-emitting_diode" title="wikilink">light-emitting diodes</a> (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.</p>

<p>At higher currents the forward voltage drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1 V to 1.5 V is typical at full rated current for power diodes.</p>
<h3 id="shockley-diode-equation">Shockley diode equation</h3>

<p>The <em>Shockley ideal diode equation</em> or the <em>diode law</em> (named after <a class="uri" href="transistor" title="wikilink">transistor</a> co-inventor <a href="William_Shockley" title="wikilink">William Bradford Shockley</a>) gives the I–V characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no bias). The following equation is called the <em>Shockley ideal diode equation</em> when <em>n</em>, the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :</p>

<h3 id="small-signal-behavior">Small-signal behavior</h3>

<p>For circuit design, a small-signal model of the diode behavior often proves useful. A specific example of diode modeling is discussed in the article on <a href="small-signal_model" title="wikilink">small-signal circuits</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-recovery-effect">Reverse-recovery effect</h3>

<p>Following the end of forward conduction in a p–n type diode, a reverse current can flow for a short time. The device does not attain its blocking capability until the mobile charge in the junction is depleted.</p>

<p>The effect can be significant when switching large currents very quickly.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> A certain amount of "reverse recovery time" t<sub>r</sub> (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) may be required to remove the reverse recovery charge Q<sub>r</sub> from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short period of time and while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is called to be in the storage-phase.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> In certain real-world cases it can be important to consider the losses incurred by this non-ideal diode effect.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> However, when the <a href="slew_rate" title="wikilink">slew rate</a> of the current is not so severe (e.g. Line frequency) the effect can be safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for <a href="Schottky_diode" title="wikilink">Schottky diodes</a>.</p>

<p>The reverse current ceases abruptly when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in <a href="step_recovery_diode" title="wikilink">step recovery diodes</a> for generation of extremely short pulses.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-semiconductor-diode">Types of semiconductor diode</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>There are several types of <a href="p–n_diode" title="wikilink">p–n junction diodes</a>, which emphasize either a different physical aspect of a diode often by geometric scaling, doping level, choosing the right electrodes, are just an application of a diode in a special circuit, or are really different devices like the Gunn and laser diode and the <a class="uri" href="MOSFET" title="wikilink">MOSFET</a>:</p>

<p>Normal (p–n) diodes, which operate as described above, are usually made of doped <a class="uri" href="silicon" title="wikilink">silicon</a> or, more rarely, <a class="uri" href="germanium" title="wikilink">germanium</a>. Before the development of silicon power rectifier diodes, <a href="cuprous_oxide" title="wikilink">cuprous oxide</a> and later <a class="uri" href="selenium" title="wikilink">selenium</a> was used; its low efficiency gave it a much higher forward voltage drop (typically 1.4 to 1.7 V per "cell", with multiple cells stacked to increase the peak inverse voltage rating in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often an extension of the diode's metal <a href="Substrate_(semiconductor)" title="wikilink">substrate</a>), much larger than a silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p–n diodes found in <a class="uri" href="CMOS" title="wikilink">CMOS</a> <a href="integrated_circuits" title="wikilink">integrated circuits</a>, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.</p>

<p><a href="Avalanche_diode" title="wikilink">Avalanche diodes</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>These are diodes that conduct in the reverse direction when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically very similar to Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the <em>avalanche effect</em>. This occurs when the reverse electric field across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2 V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, so there are collisions between them on the way out. The only practical difference is that the two types have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.

Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or <a class="uri" href="Transorb" title="wikilink">Transorb</a>, a registered trademark). The Zener diode is named for Dr. <a href="Clarence_Melvin_Zener" title="wikilink">Clarence Melvin Zener</a> of Carnegie Mellon University, inventor of the device.

<p>Other uses for semiconductor diodes include sensing temperature, and computing analog <a href="logarithm" title="wikilink">logarithms</a> (see <a href="Operational_amplifier_applications#Logarithmic_output" title="wikilink">Operational amplifier applications#Logarithmic output</a>).</p>
<h2 id="numbering-and-coding-schemes">Numbering and coding schemes</h2>

<p>There are a number of common, standard and manufacturer-driven numbering and coding schemes for diodes; the two most common being the <a href="Electronic_Industries_Alliance" title="wikilink">EIA</a>/<a class="uri" href="JEDEC" title="wikilink">JEDEC</a> standard and the European <a href="Pro_Electron" title="wikilink">Pro Electron</a> standard:</p>
<h3 id="eiajedec">EIA/JEDEC</h3>

<p>The standardized 1N-series numbering <em><a href="JEDEC#Origins" title="wikilink">EIA370</a></em> system was introduced in the US by EIA/JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) about 1960. Most diodes have a 1-prefix designation (e.g., 1N4003). Among the most popular in this series were: 1N34A/1N270 (germanium signal), 1N914/<a class="uri" href="1N4148" title="wikilink">1N4148</a> (silicon signal), <a class="uri" href="1N4001" title="wikilink">1N4001</a>-1N4007 (silicon 1A power rectifier) and 1N54xx (silicon 3A power rectifier)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="jis">JIS</h3>

<p>The <a href="JIS_semiconductor_designation" title="wikilink">JIS semiconductor designation</a> system has all semiconductor diode designations starting with "1S".</p>
<h3 id="pro-electron">Pro Electron</h3>

<p>The European <a href="Pro_Electron" title="wikilink">Pro Electron</a> coding system for <a href="active_component" title="wikilink">active components</a> was introduced in 1966 and comprises two letters followed by the part code. The first letter represents the semiconductor material used for the component (A = germanium and B = silicon) and the second letter represents the general function of the part (for diodes: A = low-power/signal, B = variable capacitance, X = multiplier, Y = rectifier and Z = voltage reference), for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>AA-series germanium low-power/signal diodes (e.g.: AA119)</li>
<li>BA-series silicon low-power/signal diodes (e.g.: BAT18 silicon RF switching diode)</li>
<li>BY-series silicon rectifier diodes (e.g.: BY127 1250V, 1A rectifier diode)</li>
<li>BZ-series silicon Zener diodes (e.g.: BZY88C4V7 4.7V Zener diode)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other common numbering / coding systems (generally manufacturer-driven) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GD-series germanium diodes (e.g.: GD9)this is a very old coding system</li>
<li>OA-series germanium diodes (e.g.: OA47)a <a href="Mullard–Philips_tube_designation" title="wikilink">coding sequence</a> developed by <a class="uri" href="Mullard" title="wikilink">Mullard</a>, a UK company</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as these common codes, many manufacturers or organisations have their own systems toofor example:</p>
<ul>
<li>HP diode 1901-0044 = JEDEC 1N4148</li>
<li>UK military diode CV448 = Mullard type OA81 = <a href="General_Electric_Company_plc" title="wikilink">GEC</a> type GEX23</li>
</ul>

<p>In optics, an equivalent device for the diode but with laser light would be the <a href="Optical_isolator" title="wikilink">Optical isolator</a>, also known as an Optical Diode, that allows light to only pass in one direction. It uses a <a href="Faraday_rotator" title="wikilink">Faraday rotator</a> as the main component.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<h3 id="radio-demodulation">Radio demodulation</h3>

<p>The first use for the diode was the demodulation of <a href="amplitude_modulation" title="wikilink">amplitude modulated</a> (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the <a class="uri" href="radio" title="wikilink">radio</a> article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose <a class="uri" href="amplitude" title="wikilink">amplitude</a> or <a href="Envelope_detector" title="wikilink">envelope</a> is proportional to the original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) <a href="rectifier" title="wikilink">rectifies</a> the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple <a href="electronic_filter" title="wikilink">filter</a> and fed into an audio amplifier or <a class="uri" href="transducer" title="wikilink">transducer</a>, which generates sound waves.</p>
<h3 id="power-conversion">Power conversion</h3>

<p><a href="Rectifier" title="wikilink">Rectifiers</a> are constructed from diodes, where they are used to convert <a href="alternating_current" title="wikilink">alternating current</a> (AC) electricity into <a href="direct_current" title="wikilink">direct current</a> (DC). Automotive <a href="alternator_(auto)" title="wikilink">alternators</a> are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into DC, provides better performance than the <a href="Commutator_(electric)" title="wikilink">commutator</a> or earlier, <a href="electrical_generator" title="wikilink">dynamo</a>. Similarly, diodes are also used in <em><a href="Cockcroft-Walton_generator" title="wikilink">Cockcroft–Walton</a> <a href="voltage_multiplier" title="wikilink">voltage multipliers</a></em> to convert AC into higher DC voltages.</p>
<h3 id="over-voltage-protection">Over-voltage protection</h3>

<p>Diodes are frequently used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage rises above the normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (<a href="stepper_motor" title="wikilink">stepper motor</a> and <a class="uri" href="H-bridge" title="wikilink">H-bridge</a>) <a href="motor_controller" title="wikilink">motor controller</a> and <a class="uri" href="relay" title="wikilink">relay</a> circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging <a href="voltage_spike" title="wikilink">voltage spikes</a> that would otherwise occur. (Any diode used in such an application is called a <a href="flyback_diode" title="wikilink">flyback diode</a>). Many <a href="integrated_circuits" title="wikilink">integrated circuits</a> also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive <a class="uri" href="transistors" title="wikilink">transistors</a>. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see <a href="#Types_of_semiconductor_diode" title="wikilink">Diode types</a> above).</p>
<h3 id="logic-gates">Logic gates</h3>

<p>Diodes can be combined with other components to construct <a href="logical_conjunction" title="wikilink">AND</a> and <a href="logical_disjunction" title="wikilink">OR</a> <a href="logic_gate" title="wikilink">logic gates</a>. This is referred to as <a href="diode_logic" title="wikilink">diode logic</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ionizing-radiation-detectors">Ionizing radiation detectors</h3>

<p>In addition to light, mentioned above, <a class="uri" href="semiconductor" title="wikilink">semiconductor</a> diodes are sensitive to more <a href="energy" title="wikilink">energetic</a> radiation. In <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, <a href="cosmic_ray" title="wikilink">cosmic rays</a> and other sources of ionizing radiation cause <a class="uri" href="noise" title="wikilink">noise</a> <a href="pulse" title="wikilink">pulses</a> and single and multiple bit errors. This effect is sometimes exploited by <a href="particle_detector" title="wikilink">particle detectors</a> to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of <a href="electron_volt" title="wikilink">electron volts</a> of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc. These semiconductor radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by <a href="liquid_nitrogen" title="wikilink">liquid nitrogen</a>. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy. They have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles, because of radiation damage. Silicon and germanium are quite different in their ability to convert <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma rays</a> to electron showers.</p>

<p><a href="Semiconductor_detector" title="wikilink">Semiconductor detectors</a> for high-energy particles are used in large numbers. Because of energy loss fluctuations, accurate measurement of the energy deposited is of less use.</p>
<h3 id="temperature-measurements">Temperature measurements</h3>

<p>A diode can be used as a <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a> measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a <a href="silicon_bandgap_temperature_sensor" title="wikilink">silicon bandgap temperature sensor</a>. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might <em>appear</em> that the voltage has a <em>positive</em> temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the <a href="Saturation_current" title="wikilink">reverse saturation current</a> term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a <em>negative</em> temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 <a href="kelvin" title="wikilink">kelvins</a>. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="current-steering">Current steering</h3>

<p>Diodes will prevent currents in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a <a href="Battery_(electricity)" title="wikilink">battery</a>. An <a href="uninterruptible_power_supply" title="wikilink">uninterruptible power supply</a> may use diodes in this way to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.</p>

<p>Diodes are also used in <a href="electronic_keyboards" title="wikilink">electronic musical keyboards</a>. To reduce the amount of wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use <a href="keyboard_matrix_(music)" title="wikilink">keyboard matrix</a> circuits. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger "<a href="Keyboard_(computing)#Control_processor" title="wikilink">phantom keys</a>" that cause "ghost" notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the <a href="musical_keyboard" title="wikilink">musical keyboard</a>. The same principle is also used for the switch matrix in solid-state <a href="pinball_machine" title="wikilink">pinball machines</a>.</p>
<h3 id="waveform-clipper">Waveform Clipper</h3>

<p>Diodes can be used to limit the positive or negative excursion of a signal to a prescribed voltage.</p>
<h3 id="clamper">Clamper</h3>

<p> A diode <a href="Clamper_(electronics)" title="wikilink">clamp circuit</a> can take a periodic alternating current signal that oscillates between positive and negative values, and vertically displace it such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level.</p>
<h2 id="abbreviations">Abbreviations</h2>

<p>Diodes are usually referred to as <em>D</em> for diode on <a href="printed_circuit_board" title="wikilink">PCBs</a>. Sometimes the abbreviation <em>CR</em> for <em>crystal rectifier</em> is used.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
