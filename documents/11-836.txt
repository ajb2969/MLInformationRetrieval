8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase

In enzymology, a 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA + L-alanine 
 
 
 
  8-amino-7-oxononanoate + CoA + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA and L-alanine, whereas its 3 products are 8-amino-7-oxononanoate, CoA, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA:L-alanine C-carboxyhexanoyltransferase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthetase, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic synthetase, and 8-amino-7-oxopelargonate synthase. This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
