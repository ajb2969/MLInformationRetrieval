   Planck mass      Planck mass   In physics , the Planck mass , denoted by m P , is the unit of mass in the system of natural units known as Planck units . It is defined so that       m  P   =     ‚Ñè  c   G         subscript  m  P         Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c   G      m_{\text{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}   ‚âà =  =  = , 1  where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, G is the gravitational constant , and ƒß is the reduced Planck constant .  Particle physicists and cosmologists often use an alternative normalization with the reduced Planck mass , which is        ‚Ñè  c    8  œÄ  G            Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c     8  œÄ  G      \sqrt{\frac{\hbar{}c}{8\pi G}}   ‚âà  = 2.435 √ó 10 18  GeV /c 2 . The factor of    1  /    8  œÄ        1      8  œÄ      1/\sqrt{8\pi}   simplifies a number of equations in general relativity .  Significance  The Planck mass is nature‚Äôs maximum allowed mass for point-masses ( quanta ) ‚Äì in other words, a mass capable of holding a single elementary charge . If two quanta of the Planck mass or greater met, they could spontaneously form a black hole whose Schwarzschild radius equals their Compton wavelength . Once such a hole formed, other particles would fall in, and the black hole would experience runaway, explosive growth (assuming it did not evaporate via Hawking radiation ). Nature‚Äôs stable point-mass particles, such as electrons and quarks , are many, many orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck mass and cannot form black holes in this manner. On the other hand, extended objects (as opposed to point-masses) can have any mass.  Unlike all other Planck base units and most Planck derived units, the Planck mass has a scale more or less conceivable to humans . It is traditionally said to be about the mass of a flea , but more accurately it is about the mass of a flea egg.  Derivations  Dimensional analysis  The formula for the Planck mass can be derived by dimensional analysis . In this approach, one starts with the three physical constants  ƒß , c , and G , and attempt to combine them to get a quantity with units of mass. The expected formula is of the form        m  P   =    c   n  1     G   n  2     ‚Ñè   n  3      ,       subscript  m  P      superscript  c   subscript  n  1     superscript  G   subscript  n  2     superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  n  3       m_{\text{P}}=c^{n_{1}}G^{n_{2}}\hbar^{n_{3}},   where     n  1   ,   n  2   ,   n  3       subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2    subscript  n  3     n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}   are constants to be determined by matching the dimensions of both sides. Using the symbol L for length, T for time, M for mass, and writing "[x]" for the dimensions of some physical quantity x, we have the following:       [  c  ]   =   ùñ´ùñ≥   -  1         delimited-[]  c    superscript  ùñ´ùñ≥    1      [c]=\mathsf{LT}^{-1}          [  G  ]   =    ùñ¨   -  1     ùñ´  3    ùñ≥   -  2          delimited-[]  G      superscript  ùñ¨    1     superscript  ùñ´  3    superscript  ùñ≥    2       [G]=\mathsf{M}^{-1}\mathsf{L}^{3}\mathsf{T}^{-2}          [  ‚Ñè  ]   =    ùñ¨  1    ùñ´  2    ùñ≥   -  1          delimited-[]  Planck-constant-over-2-pi      superscript  ùñ¨  1    superscript  ùñ´  2    superscript  ùñ≥    1       [\hbar]=\mathsf{M}^{1}\mathsf{L}^{2}\mathsf{T}^{-1}   . Therefore,       [    c   n  1     G   n  2     ‚Ñè   n  3     ]   =    ùñ¨    -   n  2    +   n  3      ùñ´    n  1   +   3   n  2    +   2   n  3       ùñ≥    -   n  1    -   2   n  2    -   n  3           delimited-[]     superscript  c   subscript  n  1     superscript  G   subscript  n  2     superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  n  3         superscript  ùñ¨       subscript  n  2     subscript  n  3      superscript  ùñ´     subscript  n  1     3   subscript  n  2      2   subscript  n  3       superscript  ùñ≥       subscript  n  1      2   subscript  n  2     subscript  n  3        [c^{n_{1}}G^{n_{2}}\hbar^{n_{3}}]=\mathsf{M}^{-n_{2}+n_{3}}\mathsf{L}^{n_{1}+3%
 n_{2}+2n_{3}}\mathsf{T}^{-n_{1}-2n_{2}-n_{3}}   If one wants dimensions of mass, the following equations must hold:        -   n  2    +   n  3    =  1           subscript  n  2     subscript  n  3    1    -n_{2}+n_{3}=1           n  1   +   3   n  2    +   2   n  3     =  0         subscript  n  1     3   subscript  n  2      2   subscript  n  3     0    n_{1}+3n_{2}+2n_{3}=0           -   n  1    -   2   n  2    -   n  3    =  0           subscript  n  1      2   subscript  n  2     subscript  n  3    0    -n_{1}-2n_{2}-n_{3}=0   . The solution of this system is:        n  1   =   1  /  2    ,     n  2   =   -   1  /  2     ,    n  3   =   1  /  2.        formulae-sequence     subscript  n  1     1  2     formulae-sequence     subscript  n  2       1  2        subscript  n  3     1  2.       n_{1}=1/2,n_{2}=-1/2,n_{3}=1/2.   Thus, the Planck mass is:        m  P   =    c   1  /  2     G   -   1  /  2      ‚Ñè   1  /  2     =     c  ‚Ñè   G     .         subscript  m  P      superscript  c    1  2     superscript  G      1  2      superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi    1  2                c  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   G       m_{\text{P}}=c^{1/2}G^{-1/2}\hbar^{1/2}=\sqrt{\frac{c\hbar}{G}}.     Elimination of a coupling constant  Equivalently, the Planck mass is defined such that the gravitational potential energy between two masses m P of separation r is equal to the energy of a photon (or graviton) of angular wavelength r (see the Planck relation ), or that their ratio equals one.       E  =    G   m  P  2    r   =    ‚Ñè  c   r    .        E      G   superscript   subscript  m  P   2    r            Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c   r      E=\frac{Gm_{\text{P}}^{2}}{r}=\frac{\hbar c}{r}.   Isolating m P , we get that       m  P   =     ‚Ñè  c   G         subscript  m  P         Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c   G      m_{\text{P}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}   Note that if, instead of planck masses, the electron mass were used, the equation would require a gravitational coupling constant , analogous to how the equation of the fine-structure constant relates the elementary charge and the Planck charge . The planck mass is an attempt to absorb the gravitational coupling constant into the unit of mass (and those of distance/time as well), as the planck charge does for the fine-structure constant; it is impossible to truly set either of these dimensionless numbers to one.  Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius  The Planck mass can be derived approximately by setting it as the mass whose Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius are equal. 2 The Compton wavelength is, loosely speaking, the length-scale where quantum effects start to become important for a particle; the heavier the particle, the smaller the Compton wavelength. The Schwarzschild radius is the radius in which a mass, if it were a black hole, would have its event horizon located; the heavier the particle, the larger the Schwarzschild radius. If a particle were massive enough that its Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius were approximately equal, its dynamics would be strongly affected by quantum gravity . This mass is (approximately) the Planck mass.  The Compton wavelength is       Œª  c   =   h   m  c         subscript  Œª  c     h    m  c      \lambda_{c}=\frac{h}{mc}   and the Schwarzschild radius is       r  s   =    2  G  m    c  2         subscript  r  s       2  G  m    superscript  c  2      r_{s}=\frac{2Gm}{c^{2}}   Setting them equal:      m  =     h  c    2  G     =     œÄ  c  ‚Ñè   G          m        h  c     2  G                œÄ  c  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   G       m=\sqrt{\frac{hc}{2G}}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi c\hbar}{G}}   This is not quite the Planck mass: It is a factor of    œÄ      œÄ    \sqrt{\pi}   larger. However, this is a heuristic derivation, only intended to get the right order of magnitude. On the other hand, the previous "derivation" of the Planck mass should have had a proportional sign in the initial expression rather than an equal sign. Therefore, the extra factor might be the correct one.
