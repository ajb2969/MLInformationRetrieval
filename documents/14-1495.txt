Good–deal bounds

Good–deal bounds are price bounds for a financial portfolio which depends on an individual trader's preferences. Mathematically, if 
 
 
 
  is a set of portfolios with future outcomes which are "acceptable" to the trader, then define the function 
 
 
 
  by


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the set of final values for self-financing trading strategies. Then any price in the range 
 
 
 
  does not provide a good deal for this trader, and this range is called the "no good-deal price bounds."12
If 
 
 
 
  then the good-deal price bounds are the no-arbitrage price bounds, and correspond to the subhedging and superhedging prices. The no-arbitrage bounds are the greatest extremes that good-deal bounds can take.34
If 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a utility function, then the good-deal price bounds correspond to the indifference price bounds.5
