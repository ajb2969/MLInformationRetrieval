   Prime gap      Prime gap   A prime gap is the difference between two successive prime numbers . The n -th prime gap, denoted g n or g ( p n ) is the difference between the ( n + 1)-th and the n -th prime numbers, i.e.        g  n   =    p   n  +  1    -   p  n     .       subscript  g  n      subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n      g_{n}=p_{n+1}-p_{n}.     We have g 1 = 1, g 2 = g 3 = 2, and g 4 = 4. The sequence ( g n ) of prime gaps has been extensively studied, however many questions and conjectures remain unanswered.  The first 60 prime gaps are:   1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 8, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 14, 4, 6, 2, 10, 2, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 2, 10, 2, 4, 2, 12, 12, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 10, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, ... .   By the definition of g n the following sum can be stated as       p   n  +  1    =   2  +    ∑   i  =  1   n    g  i          subscript  p    n  1      2    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  g  i       p_{n+1}=2+\sum_{i=1}^{n}g_{i}   .  Simple observations  The first, smallest, and only odd prime gap is 1 between the only even prime number, 2, and the first odd prime, 3. All other prime gaps are even. There is only one pair of gaps between three consecutive odd natural numbers for which all are prime. These gaps are g 2 and g 3 between the primes 3, 5, and 7.  For any prime number P , we write P # for P primorial , that is, the product of all prime numbers up to and including P . If Q is the prime number following P , then the sequence        P  #   +  2   ,    P  #   +  3   ,  …  ,    P  #   +   (   Q  -  1   )           P  normal-#   2       P  normal-#   3   normal-…      P  normal-#     Q  1      P\#+2,P\#+3,\ldots,P\#+(Q-1)     is a sequence of Q − 2 consecutive composite integers, so here there is a prime gap of at least length Q − 1. Therefore, there exist gaps between primes which are arbitrarily large, i.e., for any prime number P , there is an integer n with g n ≥ P . (This is seen by choosing n so that p n is the greatest prime number less than P # + 2.) Another way to see that arbitrarily large prime gaps must exist is the fact that the density of primes approaches zero, according to the prime number theorem . In fact, by this theorem, P # is very roughly a number the size of exp( P ), and near exp( P ) the average distance between consecutive primes is P .  In reality, prime gaps of P numbers can occur at numbers much smaller than P #. For instance, the smallest sequence of 71 consecutive composite numbers occurs between 31398 and 31468, whereas 71# has twenty-seven digits – its full decimal expansion being 557940830126698960967415390.  Although the average gap between primes increases as the natural logarithm of the integer, the ratio of the maximum prime gap to the integers involved also increases as larger and larger numbers and gaps are encountered.  In the opposite direction, the twin prime conjecture asserts that for infinitely many integers n .  Numerical results  the largest known prime gap with identified probable prime gap ends has length 3311852, with 97953-digit probable primes found by M. Jansen and J. K. Andersen. 1 2 The largest known prime gap with identified proven primes as gap ends has length 1113106, with 18662-digit primes found by P. Cami, M. Jansen and J. K. Andersen. 3 4  We say that g n is a maximal gap if g m  n for all m  Maximal Prime Gaps Other record maximal gap terms can be found at .  Usually the ratio of g n / ln( p n ) is called the merit of the gap g n . In 1931, E. Westzynthius proved that prime gaps grow more than logarithmically. That is, 5         lim sup   n  →  ∞      g  n    log   p  n      =  ∞   .        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  g  n      subscript  p  n         \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_{n}}{\log p_{n}}=\infty.   As of January 2012, the largest known merit value, as discovered by M. Jansen, is 66520 / ln(1931*1933#/7230 - 30244) ≈ 35.4244594 where 1933# indicates the primorial of 1933. This number, 1931*1933#/7230 - 30244, is an 816-digit prime. The next largest known merit value is 1476 / ln(1425172824437699411) ≈ 35.31. 6 7 This prime with the gap of 1476 is also the 75th maximal gap (the last one in the table below). Other record merit terms can be found at .  The Cramer-Shanks-Granville ratio is the ratio of g n / (ln( p n ))^2. 8 The greatest known value of this ratio is 0.9206386 for the prime 1693182318746371. Other record terms can be found at .

The prime number theorem says that the "average length" of the gap between a prime p and the next prime is ln p . The actual length of the gap might be much more or less than this. However, from the prime number theorem one can also deduce an upper bound on the length of prime gaps: for every ε > 0, there is a number N such that g n  n for all n > N .  One can deduce that the gaps get arbitrarily smaller in proportion to the primes: the quotient        lim   n  →  ∞      g  n    p  n     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  g  n    subscript  p  n     0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_{n}}{p_{n}}=0   .  Hoheisel was the first to show 9 that there exists a constant θ \pi(x + x^\theta) - \pi(x) \sim \frac{x^\theta}{\log(x)}\text{ as }x\text{ tends to infinity,}  hence showing that        π   (   x  +   x  θ    )    -   π   (  x  )     ∼    x  θ    log   (  x  )        similar-to      π    x   superscript  x  θ       π  x       superscript  x  θ     x      \pi(x+x^{\theta})-\pi(x)\sim\frac{x^{\theta}}{\log(x)}     for some positive constant c , where O refers to the big O notation , then        lim inf   n  →  ∞      g  n    log   p  n      =  0        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n        subscript  g  n      subscript  p  n      0    \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_{n}}{\log p_{n}}=0     for any θ > (1 + 4 c )/(2 + 4 c ). Here, as usual, ζ denotes the Riemann zeta function and π the prime-counting function . Knowing that any c > 1/6 is admissible, one obtains that θ may be any number greater than 5/8.  An immediate consequence of Ingham's result is that there is always a prime number between n 3 and ( n + 1) 3 if n is sufficiently large. 10 The Lindelöf hypothesis would imply that Ingham's formula holds for c any positive number: but even this would not be enough to imply that there is a prime number between n 2 and ( n + 1) 2 for n sufficiently large (see Legendre's conjecture ). To verify this, a stronger result such as Cramér's conjecture would be needed.  Huxley showed that one may choose θ = 7/12. 11  A result, due to Baker, Harman and Pintz in 2001, shows that θ may be taken to be 0.525. 12  In 2005, Daniel Goldston , János Pintz and Cem Yıldırım proved that         lim inf   n  →  ∞      g  n      log   p  n       (   log   log   p  n     )   2      <  ∞   .        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n        subscript  g  n          subscript  p  n      superscript       subscript  p  n     2         \liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_{n}}{\sqrt{\log p_{n}}(\log\log p_{n})^{2}}<\infty.     and later improved it 13 to        lim inf   n  →  ∞     g  n    <   7  ⋅   10  7          subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      subscript  g  n     normal-⋅  7   superscript  10  7      \liminf_{n\to\infty}g_{n}<7\cdot 10^{7}     In 2013, Yitang Zhang proved that       g  n   >    c   log   n   log   log   n   log   log   log   log  n              (   log   log   log  n     )   2         subscript  g  n       c      n        n          n             superscript        n     2      g_{n}>\frac{c\log n\log\log n\log\log\log\log n}{(\log\log\log n)^{2}}   ,  meaning that there are infinitely many gaps that do not exceed 70 million. 14 A Polymath Project collaborative effort to optimize Zhang’s bound managed to lower the bound to 4680 on July 20, 2013. 15 In November 2013, James Maynard introduced a new refinement of the GPY sieve, allowing him to reduce the bound to 600 and show that for any m there exists a bounded interval containing m prime numbers. 16 Using Maynard's ideas, the Polymath project has since improved the bound to 246. 17 18 Further, assuming the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture and its generalized form, the Polymath project wiki states that N has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively. 19  Lower bounds  Robert Rankin , improving results by Erik Westzynthius and Paul Erdős , proved the existence of a constant c > 0 such that the inequality       g  n   ≫    log   n   log   log   n   log   log   log   log  n            log   log   log  n         much-greater-than   subscript  g  n         n        n          n                 n        g_{n}\gg\frac{\log n\log\log n\log\log\log\log n}{\log\log\log n}     holds for infinitely many values n : he showed that one can take any constant c γ, where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant . The value of the constant c was later improved to any constant c γ. 20  Paul Erdős offered a $5,000 prize for a proof or disproof that the constant c in the above inequality may be taken arbitrarily large. 21 This was proved independently by Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao and James Maynard, in the positive, by two papers respectively sent to arXiv in 2014. 22 23  The result was further improved to        g  n   =   O   (     p  n     ln   p  n     )     ,       subscript  g  n     O       subscript  p  n       subscript  p  n        g_{n}=O(\sqrt{p_{n}}\ln p_{n}),     (for infinitely many values of n ) by Ford-Green-Konyagin-Maynard-Tao. 24  Conjectures about gaps between primes  Even better results are possible if it is assumed that the Riemann hypothesis is true. Harald Cramér proved that, under this assumption, the gap g n satisfies        g  n   =   O   (    (   ln   p  n    )   2   )     .       subscript  g  n     O   superscript     subscript  p  n    2      g_{n}=O\left((\ln p_{n})^{2}\right).   using the big O notation . Later, he conjectured that the gaps are even smaller. Roughly speaking he conjectured that       p  n   1  /  n       superscript   subscript  p  n     1  n     p_{n}^{1/n}\,   At the moment, the numerical evidence seems to point in this direction. See Cramér's conjecture for more details.  Firoozbakht's conjecture states that     p  n      subscript  p  n    p_{n}\,   (where     p   n  +  1    1  /   (   n  +  1   )     <    p  n   1  /  n    for all  n   ≥  1.         superscript   subscript  p    n  1      1    n  1        superscript   subscript  p  n     1  n    for all  n        1.     p_{n+1}^{1/(n+1)}   is the n th prime) is a strictly decreasing function of n , i.e.,       g  n   =    p   n  +  1    -   p  n         subscript  g  n      subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n      g_{n}=p_{n+1}-p_{n}     If this conjecture is true, then the function     g  n    <     (   log   p  n    )   2   -   log    p  n   for all  n     >   4.       subscript  g  n    expectation     superscript     subscript  p  n    2        subscript  p  n   for all  n      4.    g_{n}<(\log p_{n})^{2}-\log p_{n}\text{ for all }n>4.   satisfies     ×    10  1   8       absent     superscript  10  1   8     \times 10^{1}8    25  This is one of the strongest upper bound ever conjectured for prime gaps. Moreover, this conjecture implies Cramér's conjecture in a strong form and would be consistent with Daniel Shanks conjectured asymptotic equality of record gaps. 26  By using tables of maximal gaps, Firoozbakht's conjecture has been verified for all primes below 4     g  n   <     p  n          subscript  g  n      subscript  p  n      g_{n}<\sqrt{p_{n}}\,   . 27  Mean while, the Oppermann's conjecture is a conjecture which is weaker than Cramér's conjecture. The expected gap size with Oppermann's conjecture is       g  n   <    2    p  n     +   1.         subscript  g  n       2     subscript  p  n     1.     g_{n}<2\sqrt{p_{n}}+1.\,   .  Andrica's conjecture , which is a weaker conjecture to Oppermann's, states that 28  $$g_n < 2\sqrt{p_n} + 1.\,$$  This is a slight strengthening of Legendre's conjecture that between successive square numbers there is always a prime.  As an arithmetic function  The gap g n between the n th and ( n + 1)st prime numbers is an example of an arithmetic function . In this context it is usually denoted d n and called the prime difference function. 29 The function is neither multiplicative nor additive .
