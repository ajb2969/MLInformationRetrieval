   Roger Dashen      Roger Dashen   Roger Frederick Dashen (May 5, 1938 in Grand Junction, Colorado - May 25, 1995 in La Jolla ) was an American theoretical physicist who studied particle physics and quantum field theory .  Dashen studied physics at the Harvard University (where he also played in the football team), where he matriculated "summa cum laude" in 1960. Then he went to Caltech , where he earned his PhD in 1964. After that, he was a professor at Caltech in 1967 and the Institute for Advanced Study in 1969. In 1986 he became a professor at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1988 was Head of Faculty. He played a leading role in the establishment of a supercomputer center at UCSD and in the establishment of the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the National Science Foundation at the University of California, Santa Barbara .  In the 1960s he worked partly in collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann with current algebras of particle physics and models with chiral symmetry. With Steven Frautschi he tried 1964 Calculation of the mass difference of protons and neutrons within the S-matrix - theory, which is attributed to electromagnetic interactions. 1 In the 1970s, he studied with Brosl Hasslacher and André Neveu quantum field theoretical model theories (such as the Sine-Gordon model and the Gross-Neveu model) for extended particles and semiclassical approximations ([WKB approximation] []) for their analysis. 2 They developed the Dashen-Hasslacher-Neveu method (DHN) for quantization of solitons using path integrals . After the discovery of instantons in the quantum (QCD) by Polyakov , he examined it with David Gross and Curtis Callan . 3 In the 1980s, he worked with lattice gauge theory s and found with Neuberger (regardless of Giorgio Parisi ) is an upper bound for the Higgs Boson - mass. 4  Dashen was also involved in sound propagation in the ocean (with military applications in mind), where he applied quantum field theoretical methods (such as path integrals and the renormalization group ) on the problem of random scattering of sound in the ocean. He worked with his JASON colleagues Kenneth Watson and Frederik Zachariason . 5 Dashen was senior scientific adviser to the US Navy , including the committee on the safety of SSBNs , the rocket-carrying submarines, and matters relating to submarine warfare. He was a member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group .  Dashen was a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1984.  He was married and had two daughters.
