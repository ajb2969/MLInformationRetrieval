Volume operator

A quantum field theory of General Relativity provides operators that measure the geometry of space time. The volume operator 
 
 
 
  of a region 
 
 
 
  is defined as the operator that yields the expectation value of a volume measurement of the region 
 
 
 
 , given a state 
 
 
 
  of quantum General Relativity. I.e.
 
 
 
  is the expectation value for the volume of 
 
 
 
 . Loop Quantum Gravity, for example, provides volume operators, area operators and length operators for regions, surfaces and path respectively.
