   Volume operator      Volume operator   A quantum field theory of General Relativity provides operators that measure the geometry of space time . The volume operator    V   (  R  )       V  R    V(R)   of a region   R   R   R   is defined as the operator that yields the expectation value of a volume measurement of the region   R   R   R   , given a state   ψ   ψ   \psi   of quantum General Relativity. I.e.      \lang   ψ   ,   V   (  R  )   ψ   \rang         \lang  ψ     V  R  ψ  \rang     \lang\psi,V(R)\psi\rang   is the expectation value for the volume of   R   R   R   . Loop Quantum Gravity , for example, provides volume operators, area operators and length operators for regions, surfaces and path respectively.
