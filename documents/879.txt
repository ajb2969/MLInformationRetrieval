   Graphical unitary group approach      Graphical unitary group approach   Graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) is a technique used to construct Configuration state functions (CSFs) in computational quantum chemistry . As reflected in its name, the method uses the mathematical properties of the unitary group .  The foundation of the unitary group approach (UGA) can be traced to the work of Moshinsky. 1 Later, Shavitt 2 3 introduced the graphical aspect (GUGA) drawing on the earlier work of Paldus. 4  Computer programs based on the GUGA method have been shown to be highly efficient. 5  6 offering certain performance advantages over the older, sometimes called traditional, techniques for CSF construction. However traditional methods can offer other advantages 7 such as the ability to handle degenerate symmetry point groups, such as    C   ∞  v      subscript  C     v     C_{\infty v}   .
