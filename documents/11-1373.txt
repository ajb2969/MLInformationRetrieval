   Sucrose—1,6-alpha-glucan 3(6)-alpha-glucosyltransferase      Sucrose—1,6-alpha-glucan 3(6)-alpha-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a sucrose-1,6-alpha-glucan 3(6)-alpha-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sucrose + (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose + (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sucrose and (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n , whereas its two products are D-fructose and (1,6-alpha-D-glucosyl)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sucrose:1,6-alpha-D-glucan 3(6)-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include water-soluble-glucan synthase , GTF-S , sucrose-1,6-alpha-glucan 3(6)-alpha-glucosyltransferase , sucrose:1,6-alpha-D-glucan 3-alpha- and 6-alpha-glucosyltransferase , sucrose:1,6-, 1,3-alpha-D-glucan 3-alpha- and , and 6-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase .
