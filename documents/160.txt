   Wiener sausage      Wiener sausage    For the food sometimes called a Wiener (sausage), see hot dog or Vienna sausage .    In the mathematical field of probability , the Wiener sausage is a neighborhood of the trace of a Brownian motion up to a time t , given by taking all points within a fixed distance of Brownian motion. It can be visualized as a sausage of fixed radius whose centerline is Brownian motion. The Wiener sausage was named after Norbert Wiener by  because of its relation to the Wiener process ; the name is also a pun on Vienna sausage , as "Wiener" means "Viennese" in German .  The Wiener sausage is one of the simplest non-Markovian functionals of Brownian motion. Its applications include stochastic phenomena including heat conduction . It was first described by , and it was used by  to explain results of a Bose–Einstein condensate , with proofs published by .  Definitions  The Wiener sausage W δ ( t ) of radius δ and length t is the set-valued random variable on Brownian paths  b (in some Euclidean space) defined by       W  δ    (  t  )    (  b  )        subscript  W  δ   t  b    W_{\delta}(t)({b})   is the set of points within a distance δ of some point b ( x ) of the path b with 0≤ x ≤ t .  The volume of the Wiener sausage  There has been a lot of work on the behavior of the volume ( Lebesgue measure ) | W δ ( t )| of the Wiener sausage as it becomes thin (δ→0); by rescaling, this is essentially equivalent to studying the volume as the sausage becomes long ( t →∞).  showed that in 3 dimensions the expected value of the volume of the sausage is       E   (   |    W  δ    (  t  )    |   )    =    2  π  δ  t   +   4   δ  2     2  π  t     +    4  π   δ  3    /  3.          E       subscript  W  δ   t         2  π  δ  t     4   superscript  δ  2       2  π  t         4  π   superscript  δ  3    3.      E(|W_{\delta}(t)|)=2\pi\delta t+4\delta^{2}\sqrt{2\pi t}+4\pi\delta^{3}/3.   In dimension d at least 3 the volume of the Wiener sausage is asymptotic to         δ   d  -  2     π   d  /  2    2  t   /  Γ    (    (   d  -  2   )   /  2   )            superscript  δ    d  2     superscript  π    d  2    2  t   normal-Γ       d  2   2     \delta^{d-2}\pi^{d/2}2t/\Gamma((d-2)/2)   as t tends to infinity. In dimensions 1 and 2 this formula gets replaced by      8  t   /  π           8  t   π     \sqrt{8t/\pi}   and     2  π  t   /   log   (  t  )          2  π  t     t     2{\pi}t/\log(t)   respectively. , a student of Spitzer, proved similar results for generalizations of Wiener sausages with cross sections given by more general compact sets than balls .
