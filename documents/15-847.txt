Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (coenzyme-F420)

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (coenzyme-F420) (, coenzyme F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, FGD1, Rv0407, F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 1) is an enzyme with system name D-glucose-6-phosphate:F420 1-oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-glucose 6-phosphate + oxidized coenzyme F420 
 
 
 
  6-phospho-D-glucono-1,5-lactone + reduced coenzyme F420
 

Thus enzyme is specific for D-glucose 6-phosphate.
