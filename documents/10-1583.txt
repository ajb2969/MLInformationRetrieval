Schuette–Nesbitt formula

In mathematics, the Schuette–Nesbitt formula is a generalization of the inclusion–exclusion principle. It is named after Donald R. Schuette and Cecil J. Nesbitt.
The probabilistic version of the Schuette–Nesbitt formula has practical applications in actuarial science, where it is used to calculate the net single premium for life annuities and life insurances based on the general symmetric status.
Combinatorial versions
Consider a set

 
  and subsets . Let
denote the number of subsets to which 
 
 
 
  belongs, where we use the indicator functions of the sets . Furthermore, for each 
 
 
 
 , let
denote the number of intersections of exactly 
 
 
 
  sets out of , to which 
 
 
 
  belongs, where the intersection over the empty index set is defined as 
 
 
 
 , hence  1Ω}}. Let 
 
 
 
  denote a vector space over a field

 
  such as the real or complex numbers (or more generally a module over a ring

 
  with multiplicative identity). Then, for every choice of ,
c_n = \sum_{k=0}^m N_k\sum_{l=0}^k (-1)^{k-l}\binom klc_l,|3}}
where }} denotes the indicator function of the set of all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a binomial coefficient. Equality () says that the two 
 
 
 
 -valued functions defined on 
 
 
 
  are the same.


Proof of ()


We prove that () holds pointwise. Take 
 
 
 
  and define 
 
 
 
 . Then the left-hand side of () equals . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of all those indices 
 
 
 
  such that , hence 
 
 
 
  contains exactly 
 
 
 
  indices. Given 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  elements, then 
 
 
 
  belongs to the intersection  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
 . By the combinatorial interpretation of the binomial coefficient, there are }}

 
  such subsets (the binomial coefficient is zero for 
 
 
 
 ). Therefore the right-hand side of () evaluated at 
 
 
 
  equals



where we used that the first binomial coefficient is zero for 
 
 
 
 . Note that the sum (*) is empty and therefore defined as zero for 
 
 



 
  Rewriting (**) with the summation index 
 
 
 
 
  und using the binomial formula for the third equality shows that


 
  which is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this result into the above formula and noting that 
 
 
 
  choose 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , it follows that the right-hand side of () evaluated at 
 
 
 
  also reduces to .


Representation in the polynomial ring
As a special case, take for 
 
 
 
  the polynomial ring

 
  with the indeterminate

 
 . Then () can be rewritten in a more compact way as
x^n = \sum_{k=0}^m N_k(x-1)^k.|4}}
This is an identity for two polynomials whose coefficients depend on 
 
 
 
 , which is implicit in the notation.


Proof of () using ()


Substituting  xn}} for 
 
 
 
  into () and using the binomial formula shows that


 
  which proves ().


Representation with shift and difference operators
Consider the linear shift operator

 
  and the linear difference operator

 
 , which we define here on the sequence space of 
 
 
 
 
  by



and



Substituting 
 
 
 
  in () shows that
E^n = \sum_{k=0}^m N_k\Delta^k,|5}}
where we used that 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  denoting the identity operator. Note that  and  equal the identity operator 
 
 
 
  on the sequence space,  and  denote the 
 
 
 
 -fold composition.


Direct proof of () by the operator method


To prove (), we first want to verify the equation E^n=\prod_{j=1}^m(1_{A_j^{\mathrm c}}I+1_{A_j}E)|*}}
involving indicator functions of the sets  and their complements with respect to 
 
 
 
 . Suppose an 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  belongs to exactly 
 
 
 
  sets out of , where 
 
 
 
 , for simplicity of notation say that 
 
 
 
  only belongs to . Then the left-hand side of () is . On the right-hand side of (), the first 
 
 
 
  factors equal 
 
 
 
 , the remaining ones equal 
 
 
 
 
 , their product is also , hence the formula () is true.
Note that



Inserting this result into equation () and expanding the product gives



because the product of indicator functions is the indicator function of the intersection. Using the definition (), the result () follows.


Let  denote the 0th component of the 
 
 
 
 -fold composition  applied to  (c0, c1, ..., cm, ...)}}, where  denotes the identity. Then () can be rewritten in a more compact way as
c_n = \sum_{k=0}^m N_k(\Delta^k c)_0.|6}}
Probabilistic versions
Consider arbitrary events  in a probability space

 
  and let 
 
 
 
  denote the expectation operator. Then 
 
 
 
 
  from () is the random number of these events which occur simultaneously. Using  from (), define
where the intersection over the empty index set is again defined as 
 
 
 
 , hence  1}}. If the ring 
 
 
 
  is also an algebra over the real or complex numbers, then taking the expectation of the coefficients in () and using the notation from (),
in 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the field of real numbers, then this is the probability-generating function of the probability distribution of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, () and () yield
and, for every sequence  (c0, c1, c2, c3, ..., cm, ...)}},
The quantity on the left-hand side of () is the expected value of .
Remarks

In actuarial science, the name Schuette–Nesbitt formula refers to equation (), where 
 
 
 
  denotes the set of real numbers.
The left-hand side of equation () is a convex combination of the powers of the shift operator 
 
 
 
 , it can be seen as the expected value of random operator . Accordingly, the left-hand side of equation () is the expected value of random component . Note that both have a discrete probability distribution with finite support, hence expectations are just the well-defined finite sums.
The probabilistic version of the inclusion–exclusion principle can be derived from equation () by choosing the sequence 
 
 
 
 : the left-hand side reduces to the probability of the event 
 
 
 
 , which is the union of , and the right-hand side is , because  0}} and  –(–1)k}} for 
 
 
 
 
 .
Equations (), (), () and () are also true when the shift operator and the difference operator are considered on a subspace like the  spaces.
If desired, the formulae (), (), () and () can be considered in finite dimensions, because only the first 
 
 
 
  components of the sequences matter. Hence, represent the linear shift operator 
 
 
 
  and the linear difference opertor 
 
 
 
  as mappings of the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space into itself, given by the 
 
 
 
 
 -matrices







0&1&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&1&\ddots&\vdots\\ \vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&0&1\\ 0&\cdots&0&0&0 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \Delta=\begin{pmatrix} -1&1&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&-1&1&\ddots&\vdots\\ \vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&-1&1\\ 0&\cdots&0&0&-1 \end{pmatrix}, 


and let 
 
 
 
  denote the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional identity matrix. Then () and () hold for every vector  (c0, c1, ..., cm)T}} in 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space, where the exponent 
 
 
 
  in the definition of 
 
 
 
 
  denotes the transpose.
 




Equations () and () hold for an arbitrary linear operator 
 
 
 
  as long as 
 
 
 
  is the difference of 
 
 
 
  and the identity operator 
 
 
 
 .
The probabilistic versions (), () and () can be generalized to every finite measure space.

History
For independent events, the formula () appeared in a discussion of Robert P. White and T.N.E. Greville's paper by Donald R. Schuette and Cecil J. Nesbitt, see . In the two-page note , Hans U. Gerber, called it Schuette–Nesbitt formula and generalized it to arbitrary events. Christian Buchta, see , noticed the combinatorial nature of the formula and published the elementary combinatorial proof of ().
Cecil J. Nesbitt, PhD, F.S.A., M.A.A.A., received his mathematical education at the University of Toronto and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He taught actuarial mathematics at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1980. He served the Society of Actuaries from 1985 to 1987 as Vice-President for Research and Studies. Professor Nesbitt died in 2001. (Short CV taken from , page xv.)
Donald Richard Schuette was a PhD student of C. Nesbitt, he later became professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
The probabilistic version of the Schuette–Nesbitt formula () generalizes much older formulae of Waring, which express the probability of the events 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in terms of , , ..., . More precisely, with 
 
 
 
  denoting the binomial coefficient,
and
see , Sections IV.3 and IV.5, respectively.
To see that these formulae are special cases of the probabilistic version of the Schuette–Nesbitt formula, note that by the binomial theorem



Applying this operator identity to the sequence 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  leading zeros and noting that  1}} if 
 
 
 
  and  0}} otherwise, the formula () for 
 
 
 
  follows from ().
Applying the identity to 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  leading zeros and noting that  1}} if 
 
 
 
  and  0}} otherwise, equation () implies that



Expanding  using the binomial theorem and using equation (11) of the formulas involving binomial coefficients, we obtain



Hence, we have the formula () for 
 
 
 
 .
An application in actuarial science
Problem: Suppose there are 
 
 
 
  persons aged  with remaining random (but independent) lifetimes . Suppose the group signs a life insurance contract which pays them after 
 
 
 
  years the amount  if exactly 
 
 
 
  persons out of 
 
 
 
  are still alive after 
 
 
 
  years. How high is the expected payout of this insurance contract in 
 
 
 
  years?
Solution: Let  denote the event that person 
 
 
 
  survives 
 
 
 
  years, which means that  }}. In actuarial notation the probability of this event is denoted by  and can be taken from a life table. Use independence to calculate the probability of intersections. Calculate  and use the probabilistic version of the Schuette–Nesbitt formula () to calculate the expected value of .
An application in probability theory
Let 
 
 
 
  be a random permutation of the set 
 
 
 
  and let  denote the event that 
 
 
 
  is a fixed point of 
 
 
 
 , meaning that  j}}}}. When the numbers in 
 
 
 
 , which is a subset of 
 
 
 
 , are fixed points, then there are 
 
 
 
  ways to permute the remaining 
 
 
 
  numbers, hence



By the combinatorical interpretation of the binomial coefficient, there are 
 
 
 
  different choices of a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  elements, hence () simplifies to



Therefore, using (), the probability-generating function of the number 
 
 
 
  of fixed points is given by



This is the partial sum of the infinite series giving the exponential function at 
 
 
 
 , which in turn is the probability-generating function of the Poisson distribution with parameter 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, as 
 
 
 
  tends to infinity, the distribution of 
 
 
converges to the Poisson distribution with parameter $1$.
