   Going up and going down      Going up and going down   In commutative algebra , a branch of mathematics , going up and going down are terms which refer to certain properties of chains of prime ideals in integral extensions .  The phrase going up refers to the case when a chain can be extended by "upward inclusion ", while going down refers to the case when a chain can be extended by "downward inclusion".  The major results are the Cohen–Seidenberg theorems , which were proved by Irvin S. Cohen and Abraham Seidenberg . These are known as the going-up and going-down theorems .  Going up and going down  Let A ⊆ B be an extension of commutative rings.  The going-up and going-down theorems give sufficient conditions for a chain of prime ideals in B , each member of which lies over members of a longer chain of prime ideals in A , to be able to be extended to the length of the chain of prime ideals in A .  Lying over and incomparability  First, we fix some terminology. If   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   and   𝔮   𝔮   \mathfrak{q}   are prime ideals of A and B , respectively, such that       𝔮  ∩  A   =  𝔭        𝔮  A   𝔭    \mathfrak{q}\cap A=\mathfrak{p}     (note that    𝔮  ∩  A      𝔮  A    \mathfrak{q}\cap A   is automatically a prime ideal of A ) then we say that   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}    lies under    𝔮   𝔮   \mathfrak{q}   and that   𝔮   𝔮   \mathfrak{q}    lies over    𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   . In general, a ring extension A ⊆ B of commutative rings is said to satisfy the lying over property if every prime ideal P of A lies under some prime ideal Q of B .  The extension A ⊆ B is said to satisfy the incomparability property if whenever Q and ''Q' '' are distinct primes of B lying over prime P in A , then Q ⊈''Q' '' and ''Q' ⊈ Q''.  Going-up  The ring extension A ⊆ B is said to satisfy the going-up property if whenever       𝔭  1   ⊆   𝔭  2   ⊆  ⋯  ⊆   𝔭  n          subscript  𝔭  1    subscript  𝔭  2        normal-⋯        subscript  𝔭  n      \mathfrak{p}_{1}\subseteq\mathfrak{p}_{2}\subseteq\cdots\subseteq\mathfrak{p}_%
 {n}     is a chain of prime ideals of A and       𝔮  1   ⊆   𝔮  2   ⊆  ⋯  ⊆   𝔮  m          subscript  𝔮  1    subscript  𝔮  2        normal-⋯        subscript  𝔮  m      \mathfrak{q}_{1}\subseteq\mathfrak{q}_{2}\subseteq\cdots\subseteq\mathfrak{q}_%
 {m}     ( m \mathfrak{q}_i lies over    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   , then the latter chain can be extended to a chain       𝔮  1   ⊆   𝔮  2   ⊆  ⋯  ⊆   𝔮  n          subscript  𝔮  1    subscript  𝔮  2        normal-⋯        subscript  𝔮  n      \mathfrak{q}_{1}\subseteq\mathfrak{q}_{2}\subseteq\cdots\subseteq\mathfrak{q}_%
 {n}     such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n ,    𝔮  i     subscript  𝔮  i    \mathfrak{q}_{i}   lies over    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   .  In  it is shown that if an extension A ⊆ B satisfies the going-up property, then it also satisfies the lying-over property.  Going down  The ring extension A ⊆ B is said to satisfy the going-down property if whenever       𝔭  1   ⊇   𝔭  2   ⊇  ⋯  ⊇   𝔭  n        superset-of-or-equals   subscript  𝔭  1    subscript  𝔭  2     superset-of-or-equals    normal-⋯    superset-of-or-equals     subscript  𝔭  n      \mathfrak{p}_{1}\supseteq\mathfrak{p}_{2}\supseteq\cdots\supseteq\mathfrak{p}_%
 {n}     is a chain of prime ideals of A and       𝔮  1   ⊇   𝔮  2   ⊇  ⋯  ⊇   𝔮  m        superset-of-or-equals   subscript  𝔮  1    subscript  𝔮  2     superset-of-or-equals    normal-⋯    superset-of-or-equals     subscript  𝔮  m      \mathfrak{q}_{1}\supseteq\mathfrak{q}_{2}\supseteq\cdots\supseteq\mathfrak{q}_%
 {m}     ( m \mathfrak{q}_i lies over    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   , then the latter chain can be extended to a chain       𝔮  1   ⊇   𝔮  2   ⊇  ⋯  ⊇   𝔮  n        superset-of-or-equals   subscript  𝔮  1    subscript  𝔮  2     superset-of-or-equals    normal-⋯    superset-of-or-equals     subscript  𝔮  n      \mathfrak{q}_{1}\supseteq\mathfrak{q}_{2}\supseteq\cdots\supseteq\mathfrak{q}_%
 {n}     such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n ,    𝔮  i     subscript  𝔮  i    \mathfrak{q}_{i}   lies over    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   .  There is a generalization of the ring extension case with ring morphisms. Let f : A → B be a (unital) ring homomorphism so that B is a ring extension of f ( A ). Then f is said to satisfy the going-up property if the going-up property holds for f ( A ) in B .  Similarly, if f ( A ) is a ring extension, then f is said to satisfy the going-down property if the going-down property holds for f ( A ) in B .  In the case of ordinary ring extensions such as A ⊆ B , the inclusion map is the pertinent map.  Going-up and going-down theorems  The usual statements of going-up and going-down theorems refer to a ring extension A ⊆ B :   (Going up) If B is an integral extension of A , then the extension satisfies the going-up property (and hence the lying over property), and the incomparability property.  (Going down) If B is an integral extension of A , and B is a domain, and A is integrally closed in its field of fractions, then the extension (in addition to going-up, lying-over and incomparability) satisfies the going-down property.   There is another sufficient condition for the going-down property:   If A ⊆ B is a flat extension of commutative rings, then the going-down property holds. 1   Proof : 2 Let p 1 ⊆ p 2 be prime ideals of A and let q 2 be a prime ideal of B such that q 2 ∩ A = p 2 . We wish to prove that there is a prime ideal q 1 of B contained in q 2 such that q 1 ∩ A = p 1 . Since A ⊆ B is a flat extension of rings, it follows that A p 2 ⊆ B q 2 is a flat extension of rings. In fact, A p 2 ⊆ B q 2 is a faithfully flat extension of rings since the inclusion map A p 2 → B q 2 is a local homomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on spectra Spec( B q 2 ) → Spec( A p 2 ) is surjective and there exists a prime ideal of B q 2 that contracts to the prime ideal p 1 A p 2 of A p 2 . The contraction of this prime ideal of B q 2 to B is a prime ideal q 1 of B contained in q 2 that contracts to p 1 . The proof is complete. Q.E.D.  References   Atiyah, M. F. , and I. G.
