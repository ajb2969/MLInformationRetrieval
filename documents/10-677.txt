3-methylbutanal reductase

In enzymology, a 3-methylbutanal reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-methylbutanol + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  3-methylbutanal + NAD(P)H + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 3-methylbutanol, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are 3-methylbutanal, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-methylbutanol:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.
