Nilpotent algebra (ring theory)

In mathematics, specifically in ring theory, a nilpotent algebra over a commutative ring is an algebra over a commutative ring, in which for some positive integer n every product containing at least n elements of the algebra is zero. The concept of a nilpotent Lie algebra has a different definition, which depends upon the Lie bracket. (There is no Lie bracket for many algebras over commutative rings; a Lie algebra involves its Lie bracket, whereas, there is no Lie bracket defined in the general case of an algebra over a commutative ring.) Another possible source of confusion in terminology is the quantum nilpotent algebra,1 a concept related to quantum groups and Hopf algebras.
Formal definition
An associative algebra

 
  over a commutative ring 
 
 
 
  is defined to be a nilpotent algebra if and only if there exists some positive integer 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in the algebra 
 
 
 
 . The smallest such 
 
 
 
  is called the index of the algebra 
 
 
 
 .2 In the case of a non-associative algebra, the definition is that every different multiplicative association of the 
 
 
 
 
  elements is zero.
Nil algebra
An algebra in which every element of the algebra is nilpotent is called a nil algebra.3
