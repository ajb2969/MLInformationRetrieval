   Nilpotent algebra (ring theory)      Nilpotent algebra (ring theory)   In mathematics , specifically in ring theory , a nilpotent algebra over a commutative ring is an algebra over a commutative ring , in which for some positive integer n every product containing at least n elements of the algebra is zero. The concept of a nilpotent Lie algebra has a different definition, which depends upon the Lie bracket . (There is no Lie bracket for many algebras over commutative rings; a Lie algebra involves its Lie bracket, whereas, there is no Lie bracket defined in the general case of an algebra over a commutative ring.) Another possible source of confusion in terminology is the quantum nilpotent algebra , 1 a concept related to quantum groups and Hopf algebras .  Formal definition  An associative algebra    A   A   A   over a commutative ring   R   R   R   is defined to be a nilpotent algebra if and only if there exists some positive integer   n   n   n   such that    0  =     y  1      y  2     ⋯    y  n        0     subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-⋯   subscript  y  n      0=y_{1}\ y_{2}\ \cdots\ y_{n}   for all     y  1   ,   y  2   ,  …  ,   y  n       subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-…   subscript  y  n     y_{1},\ y_{2},\ \ldots,\ y_{n}   in the algebra   A   A   A   . The smallest such   n   n   n   is called the index of the algebra   A   A   A   . 2 In the case of a non-associative algebra , the definition is that every different multiplicative association of the   n   n   n   elements is zero.  Nil algebra  An algebra in which every element of the algebra is nilpotent is called a nil algebra . 3  See also   Algebraic structure (a much more general term)  nil-Coxeter algebra  Lie algebra  Example of a non-associative algebra   References     External links   Nilpotent algebra – Encyclopedia of Mathematics   "    Category:Ring theory     ↩  ↩  Nil algebra – Encyclopedia of Mathematics ↩
