   Q-Vectors      Q-Vectors   Q-vectors are used in atmospheric dynamics to understand physical processes such as vertical motion and frontogenesis . Q-vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the quasi-geostrophic equations and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations. On meteorological charts, Q-vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion. Q-vectors are an alternative to the omega equation for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi-geostrophic equations.  Derivation  First derived in 1978, 1 Q-vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes, using the midlatitude β-plane quasi-geostrophic prediction equations: 2           D  g    u  g     D  t    -    f  0    v  a    -   β  y   v  g     =  0             subscript  D  g    subscript  u  g      D  t       subscript  f  0    subscript  v  a      β  y   subscript  v  g     0    \frac{D_{g}u_{g}}{Dt}-f_{0}v_{a}-\beta yv_{g}=0   (x component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)          D  g    v  g     D  t    +    f  0    u  a    +   β  y   u  g     =  0             subscript  D  g    subscript  v  g      D  t       subscript  f  0    subscript  u  a      β  y   subscript  u  g     0    \frac{D_{g}v_{g}}{Dt}+f_{0}u_{a}+\beta yu_{g}=0   (y component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)          D  g   T    D  t    -     σ  p   R   ω    =   J   c  p               subscript  D  g   T     D  t          σ  p   R   ω      J   subscript  c  p      \frac{D_{g}T}{Dt}-\frac{\sigma p}{R}\omega=\frac{J}{c_{p}}   (quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation)   And the thermal wind equations:        f  0     ∂   u  g     ∂  p     =    R  p     ∂  T    ∂  y            subscript  f  0        subscript  u  g      p         R  p       T     y       f_{0}\frac{\partial u_{g}}{\partial p}=\frac{R}{p}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}   (x component of thermal wind equation)        f  0     ∂   v  g     ∂  p     =   -    R  p     ∂  T    ∂  x             subscript  f  0        subscript  v  g      p           R  p       T     x        f_{0}\frac{\partial v_{g}}{\partial p}=-\frac{R}{p}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}   (y component of thermal wind equation)  where    f  0     subscript  f  0    f_{0}   is the Coriolis parameter , approximated by the constant 1e −4 s −1 ;   R   R   R   is the atmospheric ideal gas constant ;   β   β   \beta   is the latitudinal change in the Coriolis parameter    β  =    ∂  f    ∂  y        β      f     y      \beta=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}   ;   σ   σ   \sigma   is a static stability parameter;    c  p     subscript  c  p    c_{p}   is the specific heat at constant pressure;   p   p   p   is pressure;   T   T   T   is temperature; anything with a subscript   g   g   g   indicates geostrophic ; anything with a subscript   a   a   a   indicates ageostrophic ;   J   J   J   is a diabatic heating rate; and   ω   ω   \omega   is the Lagrangian rate change of pressure with time.    ω  =    D  p    D  t        ω      D  p     D  t      \omega=\frac{Dp}{Dt}   . Note that because pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere, a    -  ω      ω    -\omega   is upward vertical motion, analogous to     +  w   =    D  z    D  t          w       D  z     D  t      +w=\frac{Dz}{Dt}   .  From these equations we can get expressions for the Q-vector:       Q  1   =   -    R  p    [      ∂   u  g     ∂  x      ∂  T    ∂  x     +     ∂   v  g     ∂  x      ∂  T    ∂  y      ]          subscript  Q  1         R  p    delimited-[]           subscript  u  g      x        T     x            subscript  v  g      x        T     y           Q_{1}=-\frac{R}{p}\left[\frac{\partial u_{g}}{\partial x}\frac{\partial T}{%
 \partial x}+\frac{\partial v_{g}}{\partial x}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right]        Q  2   =   -    R  p    [      ∂   u  g     ∂  y      ∂  T    ∂  x     +     ∂   v  g     ∂  y      ∂  T    ∂  y      ]          subscript  Q  2         R  p    delimited-[]           subscript  u  g      y        T     x            subscript  v  g      y        T     y           Q_{2}=-\frac{R}{p}\left[\frac{\partial u_{g}}{\partial y}\frac{\partial T}{%
 \partial x}+\frac{\partial v_{g}}{\partial y}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right]     And in vector form:       Q  1   =   -      R  p     ∂    V  g   →     ∂  x     ⋅   ∇  →    T         subscript  Q  1        normal-⋅      R  p        normal-→   subscript  V  g       x      normal-→  normal-∇    T      Q_{1}=-\frac{R}{p}\frac{\partial\vec{V_{g}}}{\partial x}\cdot\vec{\nabla}T        Q  2   =   -      R  p     ∂    V  g   →     ∂  y     ⋅   ∇  →    T         subscript  Q  2        normal-⋅      R  p        normal-→   subscript  V  g       y      normal-→  normal-∇    T      Q_{2}=-\frac{R}{p}\frac{\partial\vec{V_{g}}}{\partial y}\cdot\vec{\nabla}T     Plugging these Q-vector equations into the quasi-geostrophic omega equation gives:        (    σ    ∇  2   →    +    f  ∘  2     ∂  2    ∂   p  2       )   ω   =     -    2   ∇  →    ⋅   Q  →     +    f  ∘   β    ∂   v  g     ∂  p      -    κ  p     ∇  2   →   J              σ   normal-→   superscript  normal-∇  2        superscript   subscript  f    2      superscript   2      superscript  p  2       ω          normal-⋅    2   normal-→  normal-∇     normal-→  Q        subscript  f    β       subscript  v  g      p          κ  p    normal-→   superscript  normal-∇  2    J      \left(\sigma\overrightarrow{\nabla^{2}}+f_{\circ}^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}}{%
 \partial p^{2}}\right)\omega=-2\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{Q}+f_{\circ}\beta\frac{%
 \partial v_{g}}{\partial p}-\frac{\kappa}{p}\overrightarrow{\nabla^{2}}J     Which in an adiabatic setting gives:       -  ω   ∝   -    2   ∇  →    ⋅   Q  →        proportional-to    ω      normal-⋅    2   normal-→  normal-∇     normal-→  Q       -\omega\propto-2\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{Q}     Expanding the left-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation in a Fourier Series gives the    -  ω      ω    -\omega   above, implying that a    -  ω      ω    -\omega   relationship with the right-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation can be assumed.  This expression shows that the divergence of the Q-vector (     ∇  →   ⋅   Q  →      normal-⋅   normal-→  normal-∇    normal-→  Q     \vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{Q}   ) is associated with downward motion. Therefore, convergent    Q  →     normal-→  Q    \vec{Q}   forces ascend and divergent    Q  →     normal-→  Q    \vec{Q}   forces descend. 3 Q-vectors and all ageostrophic flow exist to preserve thermal wind balance. Therefore, low level Q-vectors tend to point in the direction of low-level ageostrophic winds. 4  Applications  Q-vectors can be determined wholly with: geopotential height (   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   ) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where      ∂  T    ∂  y    <  0          T     y    0    \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}<0   ), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind. 5 This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.  In frontogenesis , temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients. 6 In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created. 7  References  "  Category:Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena  Category:Synoptic meteorology and weather  Category:Atmospheric dynamics  Category:Fluid dynamics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
