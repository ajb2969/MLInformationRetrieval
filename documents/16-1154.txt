   Milnor–Moore theorem      Milnor–Moore theorem   In algebra , the Milnor–Moore theorem , introduced in , states: given a connected graded cocommutative  Hopf algebra  A over a field of characteristic zero with     dim   A  n    <  ∞       dimension   subscript  A  n       \dim A_{n}<\infty   , the natural Hopf algebra homomorphism       U   (   P   (  A  )    )    →  A     normal-→    U    P  A    A    U(P(A))\to A   from the universal enveloping algebra of the "graded" Lie algebra     P   (  A  )       P  A    P(A)   of primitive elements of A to A is an isomorphism. (The universal enveloping algebra of a graded Lie algebra L is the quotient of the tensor algebra of L by the two-sided ideal generated by elements xy - (-1) | x || y | [ x , y ].)
