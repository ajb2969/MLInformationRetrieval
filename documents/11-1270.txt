   Glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase      Glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase   In enzymology , a glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP-glucose + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + ADP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP-glucose and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , whereas its two products are 2-(beta-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and ADP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-glucose:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 2-beta-D-glucosyltransferase .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
