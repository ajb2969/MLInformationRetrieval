   Catalan surface      Catalan surface   (Figure)  A Catalan surface.   In geometry , a Catalan surface , named after the Belgian mathematician  Eug√®ne Charles Catalan , is a ruled surface all of whose rulings are parallel to a fixed plane . The vector equation of a Catalan surface is given by   r = s ( u ) + v  L ( u ),   where r = s ( u ) is the space curve and L ( u ) is the unit vector of the ruling at u = u . All the vectors L ( u'') are parallel to the same plane, called the directrix plane of the surface. This can be characterized by the condition: the mixed product [ L ( u''), ' L' '( u ), ' L" '( u )] = 0.[ http://books.google.com/books?id=K31Nzi_xhoQC&pg; ;=PA279&dq;=catalan+surface&ei;=7GFySs2CN5qIlQTCsvSDAQ#v=onepage&q;=catalan%20surface&f;=false]  The parametric equations of the Catalan surface are 1       x  =    f   (  u  )    +   v  i   (  u  )      ,    y  =    g   (  u  )    +   v  j   (  u  )      ,   z  =    h   (  u  )    +   v  k   (  u  )          formulae-sequence    x      f  u     v  i  u      formulae-sequence    y      g  u     v  j  u       z      h  u     v  k  u        x=f(u)+vi(u),\quad y=g(u)+vj(u),\quad z=h(u)+vk(u)\,     If all the rulings of a Catalan surface intersect a fixed line , then the surface is called a conoid .  Catalan proved that the helicoid and the plane were the only ruled  minimal surfaces .  See also   Ruled surface  Conoid   References   A. Gray, E. Abbena, S.
