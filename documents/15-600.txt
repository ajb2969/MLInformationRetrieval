   Linearised polynomial      Linearised polynomial   In mathematics, a linearised polynomial (or q - polynomial) is a polynomial for which the exponents of all the constituent monomials are powers of q and the coefficients come from some extension field of the finite field of order q .  We write a typical example as        L   (  x  )    =     ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    x   q  i      ,   where each   a  i   is in   F   q  m     (   =  G  F   (   q  m   )    )   for some fixed positive integer  m     .        L  x      superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  x   superscript  q  i        where each   subscript  a  i   is in   subscript  F   superscript  q  m      =  G  F   superscript  q  m    for some fixed positive integer  m      L(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{q^{i}},\text{ where each }a_{i}\text{ is in }F_{q^{%
 m}}(\text{ = }GF(q^{m}))\text{ for some fixed positive integer }m.     This special class of polynomials is important from both a theoretical and an applications viewpoint. 1 The highly structured nature of their roots makes these roots easy to determine.  Properties   The map x → L ( x ) is a linear map over any field containing F q  The set of roots of L is an F q -vector space and is closed under the q - Frobenius map  Conversely, if U is any F q -linear subspace of some finite field containing F q , then the polynomial that vanishes exactly on U is a linearised polynomial.  The set of linearised polynomials over a given field is closed under addition and composition of polynomials.  If L is a nonzero linearised polynomial over    F   q  n      subscript  F   superscript  q  n     F_{q^{n}}   with all of its roots lying in the field    F   q  s      subscript  F   superscript  q  s     F_{q^{s}}   an extension field of    F   q  n      subscript  F   superscript  q  n     F_{q^{n}}   , then each root of L has the same multiplicity, which is either 1, or a positive power of q . 2   Symbolic multiplication  In general, the product of two linearised polynomials will not be a linearized polynomial, but since the composition of two linearised polynomials results in a linearised polynomial, composition may be used as a replacement for multiplication and, for this reason, composition is often called symbolic multiplication in this setting. Notationally, if L 1 ( x ) and L 2 ( x ) are linearised polynomials we define            L  1    (  x  )    ⊗   L  2     (  x  )    =    L  1    (    L  2    (  x  )    )           tensor-product     subscript  L  1   x    subscript  L  2    x      subscript  L  1      subscript  L  2   x      L_{1}(x)\otimes L_{2}(x)=L_{1}(L_{2}(x))        when this point of view is being taken.  Associated polynomials  The polynomials L ( x ) and       l   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i    x  i           l  x     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  x  i       l(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{i}     are q - associates (note: the exponents " q i " of L ( x ) have been replaced by " i " in l ( x )). More specifically, l(x} is called the conventional q-associate of L(x) , and L(x) is the linearised q-associate of l(x) .  q-polynomials over F q  Linearised polynomials with coefficients in F q have additional properties which make it possible to define symbolic division, symbolic reducibility and symbolic factorizaton. Two important examples of this type of linearised polynomial are the Frobenius automorphism    x  ↦   x  q      maps-to  x   superscript  x  q     x\mapsto x^{q}   and the trace function     Tr   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1     x   q  i          Tr  x     superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1     superscript  x   superscript  q  i       \operatorname{Tr}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x^{q^{i}}   .  In this special case it can be shown that, as an operation , symbolic multiplication is commutative , associative and distributes over ordinary addition. 3 Also, in this special case, we can define the operation of symbolic division . If L ( x ) and L 1 ( x ) are linearised polynomials over F q , we say that L 1 ( x ) symbolically divides  L ( x ) if there exists a linearised polynomial L 2 ( x ) over F q for which:        L   (  x  )    =      L  1    (  x  )    ⊗   L  2     (  x  )     .        L  x      tensor-product     subscript  L  1   x    subscript  L  2    x     L(x)=L_{1}(x)\otimes L_{2}(x).     If L 1 ( x ) and L 2 ( x ) are linearised polynomials over F q with conventional q-associates l 1 ( x ) and l 2 ( x ) respectively, then L 1 ( x ) symbolically divides L 2 ( x ) if and only if l 1 ( x ) divides l 2 ( x ). 4 Furthermore, L 1 ( x ) divides L 2 ( x ) in the ordinary sense in this case. 5  A linearised polynomial L ( x ) over F q of degree > 1 is symbolically irreducible over F q if the only symbolic decompositions          L   (  x  )    =      L  1    (  x  )    ⊗   L  2     (  x  )     ,        L  x      tensor-product     subscript  L  1   x    subscript  L  2    x     L(x)=L_{1}(x)\otimes L_{2}(x),        with L i over F q are those for which one of the factors has degree 1. Note that a symbolically irreducible polynomial is always reducible in the ordinary sense since any linearised polynomial of degree > 1 has the nontrivial factor x . A linearised polynomial L ( x ) over F q is symbolically irreducible if and only if its conventional q -associate l ( x ) is irreducible over F q .  Every q -polynomial L ( x ) over F q of degree > 1 has a symbolic factorization into symbolically irreducible polynomials over F q and this factorization is essentially unique (up to rearranging factors and multiplying by nonzero elements of F q .)  For example, 6 consider the 2-polynomial L ( x ) = x 16 + x 8 + x 2 + x over F 2 and its conventional 2-associate l ( x ) = x 4 + x 3 + x + 1. The factorization into irreducibles of l ( x ) = ( x 2 + x + 1)( x + 1) 2 in F 2 [ x ], gives the symbolic factorization          L   (  x  )    =    (    x  4   +   x  2   +  x   )   ⊗   (    x  2   +  x   )   ⊗   (    x  2   +  x   )     .        L  x    tensor-product     superscript  x  4    superscript  x  2   x      superscript  x  2   x      superscript  x  2   x      L(x)=(x^{4}+x^{2}+x)\otimes(x^{2}+x)\otimes(x^{2}+x).        Affine polynomials  Let L be a linearised polynomial over    F   q  n      subscript  F   superscript  q  n     F_{q^{n}}   . A polynomial of the form      A   (  x  )    =    L   (  x  )    -   α  for  α    ∈   F   q  n     ,          A  x       L  x     α  for  α          subscript  F   superscript  q  n       A(x)=L(x)-\alpha\text{ for }\alpha\in F_{q^{n}},   is an affine polynomial over    F   q  n      subscript  F   superscript  q  n     F_{q^{n}}   .  Theorem: If A is a nonzero affine polynomial over    F   q  n      subscript  F   superscript  q  n     F_{q^{n}}   with all of its roots lying in the field    F   q  s      subscript  F   superscript  q  s     F_{q^{s}}   an extension field of    F   q  n      subscript  F   superscript  q  n     F_{q^{n}}   , then each root of A has the same multiplicity, which is either 1, or a positive power of q . 7  Notes  References      "  Category:Polynomials     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
