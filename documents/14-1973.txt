   Eta invariant      Eta invariant   In mathematics, the eta invariant of a self-adjoint elliptic  differential operator on a compact manifold is formally the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of negative eigenvalues. In practice both numbers are often infinite so are defined using zeta function regularization . It was introduced by  who used it to extend the Hirzebruch signature theorem to manifolds with boundary.  They also later used the eta invariant of a self-adjoint operator to define the eta invariant of a compact odd-dimensional smooth manifold.  defined the signature defect of the boundary of a manifold as the eta invariant, and used this to show that Hirzebruch's signature defect of a cusp of a Hilbert modular surface can be expressed in terms of the value at s =0 or 1 of a Shimizu L-function .  Definition  The eta invariant of self-adjoint operator A is given by η A (0), where η is the analytic continuation of       η   (  s  )    =    ∑   λ  ≠  0      sign   (  λ  )      |  λ  |   s           η  s     subscript     λ  0       sign  λ    superscript    λ   s       \eta(s)=\sum_{\lambda\neq 0}\frac{\operatorname{sign}(\lambda)}{|\lambda|^{s}}     and the sum is over the nonzero eigenvalues λ of A .
