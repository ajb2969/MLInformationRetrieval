Autoregressive conditional duration

In financial econometrics, an autoregressive conditional duration (ACD, Engle and Russell (1998)) model considers irregularly spaced and autocorrelated intertrade durations. ACD is analogous to GARCH. Indeed, in a continuous double auction (a common trading mechanism in many financial markets) waiting times between two consecutive trades vary at random.
Definition
Specifically, let 
 
 
 
  denote the duration (the waiting time between consecutive trades) and assume that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  are independent and identically distributed random variables, positive and with 
 
 
 
 
  and where the series 
 
 
 
  is given by
