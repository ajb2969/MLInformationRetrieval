   D-proline reductase (dithiol)      D-proline reductase (dithiol)   In enzymology , a D-proline reductase (dithiol) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-aminopentanoate + lipoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-proline + dihydrolipoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-aminopentanoate and lipoate , whereas its two products are D-proline and dihydrolipoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-aminopentanoate:lipoate oxidoreductase (cyclizing) . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyruvate .
