   Piecewise syndetic set      Piecewise syndetic set   In mathematics , piecewise syndeticity is a notion of largeness of subsets of the natural numbers .  A set    S   \sub   ℕ      S  \sub  ℕ    S\sub\mathbb{N}   is called piecewise syndetic if there exists a finite subset G of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   such that for every finite subset F of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   there exists an    x  ∈  ℕ      x  ℕ    x\in\mathbb{N}   such that       x  +  F   ⊂    ⋃   n  ∈  G     (   S  -  n   )          x  F     subscript     n  G      S  n      x+F\subset\bigcup_{n\in G}(S-n)     where     S  -  n   =   {   m  ∈  ℕ   :    m  +  n   ∈  S   }         S  n    conditional-set    m  ℕ       m  n   S      S-n=\{m\in\mathbb{N}:m+n\in S\}   . Equivalently, S is piecewise syndetic if there are arbitrarily long intervals of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   where the gaps in S are bounded by some constant b .  Properties   A set is piecewise syndetic if and only if it is the intersection of a syndetic set and a thick set .    If S is piecewise syndetic then S contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.    A set S is piecewise syndetic if and only if there exists some ultrafilter U which contains S and U is in the smallest two-sided ideal of    β  ℕ      β  ℕ    \beta\mathbb{N}   , the Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers.    Partition regularity : if   S   S   S   is piecewise syndetic and    S  =    C  1   ∪   C  2   ∪  …  ∪   C  n        S     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2   normal-…   subscript  C  n      S=C_{1}\cup C_{2}\cup...\cup C_{n}   , then for some    i  ≤  n      i  n    i\leq n   ,    C  i     subscript  C  i    C_{i}   contains a piecewise syndetic set. (Brown, 1968)    If A and B are subsets of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   , and A and B have positive upper Banach density , then     A  +  B   =   {   a  +  b   :    a  ∈  A   ,   b  ∈  B    }         A  B    conditional-set    a  b    formulae-sequence    a  A     b  B       A+B=\{a+b:a\in A,b\in B\}   is piecewise syndetic 1  .   Other Notions of Largeness  There are many alternative definitions of largeness that also usefully distinguish subsets of natural numbers:   Cofiniteness  IP set  member of a nonprincipal ultrafilter  positive upper density  syndetic set  thick set   See also   Ergodic Ramsey theory   Notes  References   J.
