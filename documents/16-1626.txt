   Draft:Functorial point      Draft:Functorial point   (What is the best article title?)  By definition, if X and Y are schemes, a Y -point of X is a morphism of schemes X ‚Üí Y . If Y = Spec( R ), then a Y -point is also called an R -point. The set of R -points of X is denoted by X ( R ). If R ‚Üí R' is a ring homorphism, then it induces the " function " X ( R ) ‚Üí X ( R' ) that is compatible with compositions. Thus, one has the functor    R  ‚Ü¶   X   (  R  )       maps-to  R    X  R     R\mapsto X(R)   from the category of rings to the category of sets.  Yoneda's lemma says that a scheme X determines and is determined by its (functorial) points. 1  The above definitions and remark extend to a relative setting: that is, if there is a fixed base ring B (e.g., a field or Z ), then one considers schemes and morphisms over Spec( B ) and the same statements continue to hold.  The important special case is when R is a topological ring ; in this case X ( R ) inherits the topology of R (cf. Proposition 2.1. of 1 )  Motivation: systems of polynomial equations  The notion of functorial points, among others, generalizes the notion of the solutions of a system of polynomial equations in classical algebraic geometry. Indeed, let f i 's be finitely many polynomials over a ring B in several variables and X their zero-locus in an affine space over B . So, we have X = Spec( A ) with    A  =    B   [   t  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   t  n   ]    /   (   f  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   f  m   )        A      B    subscript  t  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  t  n       subscript  f  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  f  m       A=B[t_{1},\dots,t_{n}]/(f_{1},\dots,f_{m})   . For a B -algebra R , to give an R -point of X is to give an algebra homomorphism A ‚Üí R , which in turn amounts to giving a homomorphism        B   [   t  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   t  n   ]    ‚Üí  R   ,    t  i   ‚Ü¶   r  i       formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí    B    subscript  t  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  t  n     R    maps-to   subscript  t  i    subscript  r  i      B[t_{1},\dots,t_{n}]\to R,\,t_{i}\mapsto r_{i}   that kills f i 's. Thus, there is a natural identification:       X   (  R  )    =   {    (   r  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   r  n   )   ‚àà   R  n    |     f  1    (   r  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   r  n   )    =  ‚ãØ  =    f  m    (   r  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   r  n   )    =  0   }         X  R    conditional-set      subscript  r  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  r  n     superscript  R  n           subscript  f  1     subscript  r  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  r  n     normal-‚ãØ          subscript  f  m     subscript  r  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  r  n          0       X(R)=\{(r_{1},\dots,r_{n})\in R^{n}|f_{1}(r_{1},\dots,r_{n})=\cdots=f_{m}(r_{1%
 },\dots,r_{n})=0\}   .  The projective case is slightly more complicated. As before,  (discuss M. Artin's approach to systems of algebraic equations.)  Points as characters  Let X be a scheme over the base ring B . If x is a set-theoretic point of X , then the residue field of x is the residue field of the local ring     ùí™   X  ,  x      subscript  ùí™   X  x     \mathcal{O}_{X,x}   (i.e., the quotient by the maximal ideal). For example, if X is an affine scheme Spec( A ) and x is a prime ideal   ùî≠   ùî≠   \mathfrak{p}   , then the residue field of x is the function field of the closed subscheme    Spec   (   A  /  ùî≠   )      Spec    A  ùî≠     \operatorname{Spec}(A/\mathfrak{p})   .  For simplicity, suppose    X  =   Spec   (  A  )        X   Spec  A     X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)   . Then the inclusion of a set-theoretic point x into X corresponds to the ring homomorphism:      A  ‚Üí   k   (  x  )       normal-‚Üí  A    k  x     A\to k(x)   (which is    A  ‚Üí   A  ùî≠   ‚Üí   k   (  ùî≠  )         normal-‚Üí  A   subscript  A  ùî≠     normal-‚Üí      k  ùî≠      A\to A_{\mathfrak{p}}\to k(\mathfrak{p})   if    x  =  ùî≠      x  ùî≠    x=\mathfrak{p}   .) This homomorphism is the "evaluation" of f at x in the following sense:  See also: Berkovich spectrum .  Points as sections  By the universal property of fiber product , each R -point of a scheme X determines a morphism of R -schemes       Spec   (  R  )    ‚Üí     X  R    =  def   X    √ó   Spec   (  B  )      Spec   (  R  )        normal-‚Üí   Spec  R     subscript    Spec  B       subscript  X  R    def    X    Spec  R      \operatorname{Spec}(R)\to X_{R}\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}X\times_{\operatorname%
 {Spec}(B)}\operatorname{Spec}(R)   ; i.e., a section of the projection     X  R   ‚Üí   Spec   (  R  )       normal-‚Üí   subscript  X  R    Spec  R     X_{R}\to\operatorname{Spec}(R)   . If S is a subset of X ( R ), then one writes     |  S  |   ‚äÇ   X  R         S    subscript  X  R     |S|\subset X_{R}   for the set of the images of the sections determined by elements in S . 2  (Mention Lang's theorem and a rational point of an elliptic curve.)  See also: level structure (algebraic geometry) .  Spec of the ring of dual numbers  The identity map as a point  If X is a scheme, by definition, one can consider an X -point of X ; in particular,  Rational points  Points of a proper scheme  The valuation criterion says that, if X is a proper scheme (over some fixed base ring B ), and R is a valuation ring of a field K that is an algebra over the base ring, then any K -point of X extends to an R -point of X .  Points of a projective space  Galois action  Any ring homorphism R ‚Üí R' induces the function X ( R ) ‚Üí X ( R' ). In particular, this applies to automorphisms of a field and so the Galois group G of a field extension K of F acts on the set X ( F ).  (mention Frobenius endomorphism )  Points with symmetries  The natural thing to do is to replace a set of points by a category of points: the result is known as "stack".
