Constant factor rule in integration

The constant factor rule in integration is a dual of the constant factor rule in differentiation, and is a consequence of the linearity of integration. It states that a constant factor within an integrand can be separated from the integrand and instead multiplied by the integral. For example, where k is a constant:



Proof
Start by noticing that, from the definition of integration as the inverse process of differentiation:



Now multiply both sides by a constant k. Since k is a constant it is not dependent on x:



Take the constant factor rule in differentiation:



Integrate with respect to x:



Now from (1) and (2) we have:






Therefore:



Now make a new differentiable function:



Substitute in (3):



Now we can re-substitute y for something different from what it was originally:



So:



This is the constant factor rule in integration.
A special case of this, with k=-1, yields:
