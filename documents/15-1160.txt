4-(Gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-(BtrI acyl-carrier protein) monooxygenase

4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-(BtrI acyl-carrier protein) monooxygenase (, btrO (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-(BtrI acyl-carrier protein),FMN:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein] + FMNH2 + O2

 
  4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)-(2S)-2-hydroxybutanoyl-[BtrI acyl-carrier protein] + FMN + H2O
 

4-(gamma-L-glutamylamino)butanoyl-(BtrI acyl-carrier protein) monooxygenase catalyses a step in the biosynthesis of the side chain of the aminoglycoside antibiotics of the butirosin family.
